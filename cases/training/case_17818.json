    "summary": "<p>On June 26, 2020, in the midst of widespread racial justice protests challenging police conduct, President Trump signed Executive Order 13933, entitled Protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues and Combating Recent Criminal Violence. Days later, Acting Security of Homeland Security Chad Wolf began implementing this Executive Order by deploying federal law enforcement agents &mdash; including agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. Marshals Service, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection &mdash; to Portland as part of &ldquo;Operation Diligent Valor.&rdquo; The city of Portland did not invite or consent to the presence of federal law enforcement.</p>\r\n<p>The cities of Portland, OR and Oakland, CA brought this lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on October 14, 2020, challenging the federal government&rsquo;s new policy that expanded the jurisdiction of federal law enforcement. Plaintiffs asserted that the federal agents deployed during &ldquo;Operation Diligent Valor&rdquo; acted beyond the purpose of protecting federal persons or property. The cities, represented by their respective city attorneys and Public Rights Project, brought the suit under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging that the actions taken by the defendants were not in accordance with the law, were arbitrary and capricious, and were in excess of federal authority. In addition, the plaintiffs alleged that Chad Wolf was not legally authorized to hold the position of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and the Homeland Security Act and therefore any actions he took to enact, enforce, or contribute to the policy must be held unlawful and set aside. Finally, plaintiffs alleged that the federal government acted in violation of the Tenth Amendment by commandeering the Portland Police Bureau and interfering with Portland&rsquo;s police powers as designated to it by the State of Oregon.</p>\r\n<p>The case was initially assigned to Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim on October 14, 2020. Plaintiffs declined to proceed before a Magistrate Judge and the case was reassigned to Judge Edward M. Chen. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction or in the alternative to transfer venue on December 21, 2020. In light of the amended complaint, which Plaintiffs filed on January 21, 2021, the court dismissed the defendants' motion to dismiss as moot. The amended complaint added allegations that the defendants&rsquo; actions targeted progressive cities and included facts that contrasted the government&rsquo;s actions in these cities against the government&rsquo;s nonresponse to gatherings on monuments during the January 6 Capitol riots and encouragement of protests at state capitols against Covid-19 quarantine measures. Shortly after the amended complaint was filed and prompted by the change in leadership at the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice, the parties began discussing whether they could resolve the case without further litigation. On May 14, 2021, President Biden <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/14/executive-order-on-the-revocation-of-certain-presidential-actions-and-technical-amendment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">revoked</a> Executive Order 13933. On October 15, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation to dismiss the matter without prejudice. As a result, the case was closed.</p>",

    "summary_short": "On October 14, 2020, the cities of Portland, OR and Oakland, CA sued the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice alleging that the federal government violated the Administrative Procedure Act by setting federal law enforcement policy in excess of statutory authority and deploying federal law enforcement agents outside of their jurisdiction during \"Operation Diligent Valor\" in response to the 2020 racial justice protests. They further alleged that Chad Wolf was not legally authorized to perform the duties and functions of the Secretary of Homeland Security. Finally, the suit alleged that the federal government violated the Tenth Amendment by commandeering the Portland Police Bureau. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. After new leadership took over at the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice, the parties began negotiating a possible resolution to the case without further litigation. On October 15, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation to dismiss the matter without prejudice.",

This lawsuit challenges the unlawful and unconstitutional overreach of federal law \n3  enforcement in response to and in anticipation of protests for racial justice in progressive United \n4  States cities. In particular, the lawsuit challenges the federal government’s new policy authorizing \n5  the expanded and unbounded jurisdiction of federal law enforcement under the guise of protecting \n6  federal  property,  and  the  federal  government’s  related  and  unconstitutional  practice  of \n7  commandeering local law enforcement officers for similar ends.   \n8  2.  Plaintiffs are the cities of Portland, Oregon, and Oakland, California—cities that, \n9  like others across the United States, have primary responsibility for the health, safety, and welfare \n10  of their residents, including the protection and oversight of general public safety during protests. \n11  Plaintiffs have police departments, fire departments, and other local governmental departments \n12  whose purposes and responsibilities are to reduce and address violence and/or support public safety \n13  in their communities. In conducting these important functions, Plaintiffs aim to respect, honor, and \n14  protect the First Amendment rights, among other rights, of their residents and visitors, so that those \n15  residents and visitors can demonstrate, march, and protest. Plaintiffs also have obligations under \n16  local and state law to respond, as necessary, to threats of violence and community harm. Outside \n17  of the exceptional actions taken by Defendants as described in this First Amended Complaint, \n18  Plaintiffs have long operated with this understanding of their duties and authority.  \n19  3.  Defendants are the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the United States \n20  Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), and the new acting leaders of both departments. In \n21  response to directives from President Donald J. Trump beginning in or around June 2020, \n22  Defendants  unilaterally,  unlawfully,  and  unconstitutionally  began  developing  a  policy  that \n23  authorized the deployment and operation of federal agents in U.S. cities under the pretext of \n24  protecting federal property but for the actual purpose of quelling protests with which President \n25  Trump disagreed (the “Policy”). \n26  4.  The full scope and parameters of the Policy authorizing these actions are currently \n27  unknown, as no ordinary public process was followed in its creation.  \n28 \n- 2 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 3 of 66\n \n \n1  5.  Upon information and belief, the Policy is a response to, incorporates, and/or is \n2  guided  by,  the  June  26,  2020  Executive  Order  13,933,  Protecting  American  Monuments, \n3  Memorials, and Statues and Combating Recent Criminal Violence (the “Executive Order”), signed \n4  by President  Trump following nationwide protests—quite possibly the largest social justice \n5  protests in our nation’s history—against police brutality and systemic racism. The Executive Order \n6  prescribes a set of directives aimed at punishing and responding to “State and local governments” \n7  that had allegedly “lost the ability to distinguish between the lawful exercise of rights to free speech \n8  and assembly and unvarnished vandalism,” or otherwise “failed to protect public monuments, \n9  memorials, and statues.” \n10  6.   Upon information and belief, following the issuance of the Executive Order, \n11  Defendants implemented the new Policy which authorizes the cross-designation of federal agents \n12  purportedly under 40 U.S.C. § 1315 to protect and defend all monuments, memorials, and statues, \n13  irrespective of their connection or proximity to federal property. Given the widespread existence \n14  of such objects in public places throughout U.S. cities, the Policy effectively creates blanket \n15  authorization for the deployment of a federal police presence in almost every corner of urban \n16  America.  \n17  7.  The Policy meaningfully and illegally expands the jurisdiction granted by statute.  \n18  40 U.S.C. § 1315 solely permits designation of DHS employees to protect federal property owned \n19  or leased by the General Services Administration (“GSA”), or to engage in activity off such GSA-\n20  owned or -leased property specifically in furtherance of their duty to protect that property.  \n21  8.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  are  now  permitted  to  protect  any \n22  monument, memorial, or statue, irrespective of whether they are owned or leased by the GSA or \n23  on land owned or leased by the GSA, and to engage in activity under the pretext of protecting such \n24  objects under the Policy. \n25  9.  Federal law enforcement agents have, under the Policy, been deployed to U.S. \n26  cities, either secretly or with little warning, under at least three separate operations or programs: \n27  Operation Legend; Operation Diligent Valor, which includes the deployment of agents in Portland, \n28 \n- 3 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 4 of 66\n \n \n1  Oregon during the summer of 2020; and the Protecting American Communities Task Force \n2  (“PACT”).  \n3  10.  Although Defendants and/or their agents or employees have publicly claimed that \n4  certain operations are for the purpose of protecting federal property under 40 U.S.C. § 1315, \n5  internal memoranda, internal email communications, internal policies, various public statements, \n6  and activities or failures to act in cities such as Portland and Washington, D.C. instead reveal a \n7  distinct and meaningful policy shift to use federal law enforcement to unilaterally step in or replace \n8  local law enforcement departments that do not subscribe to President Trump’s view of domestic \n9  “law and order” and to quell viewpoints, speech, or protests with which President Trump disagrees. \n10  These interventions also are intended to pressure local officials and police departments to react \n11  more aggressively to stop or thwart racial justice protests.  \n12  11.  The animating intent of the Policy was to use property protection as the pretextual \n13  justification for viewpoint discrimination. Although Defendants have broad discretion about how \n14  they direct resources to protect approximately 9,000 GSA-owned or -leased properties, that \n15  discretion does not include general enforcement activity on state and local land or making \n16  enforcement decisions based on viewpoint. Yet that undergirds the Policy: animus toward certain \n17  political  views,  whether  those  views  are  expressed  by  protesters,  municipal  leaders,  or \n18  municipalities themselves.   \n19  12.  In 2020, the Policy was implemented to suppress protests or other activities in \n20  progressive, Democratic-controlled cities where protestors expressed support for Black Lives \n21  Matter or other racial justice actions, causes that President Trump and his administration did not \n22  support, under the pretext of protecting federal property. The Policy was implemented either \n23  through direct intervention in, and deployment of federal law enforcement to, cities, such as \n24  Defendants did in Portland in July 2020, or via threats to do so in order to pressure state and local \n25  law enforcement to shut down or severely limit the extent of such protests as quickly as possible, \n26  including through the use of racially discriminatory tactics and excessive use of force. In this \n27  manner, the Policy has been the source of over-policing progressive cities and progressive \n28  viewpoints. \n- 4 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 5 of 66\n \n \n1  13.  Although the Policy is not public, there is considerable evidence of its existence. \n2  Among other things, reported non-public memos from DHS reveal that, under the Policy and in \n3  response to the Executive Order, federal law enforcement agents are authorized to engage in \n4  surveillance activities for threats to any public monument, memorial, or statue (whether under \n5  federal, state, or local control)—which in major cities like Plaintiff jurisdictions, could constitute \n6  surveillance within the entire jurisdiction regardless of federal interests or harms at stake.  \n7  14.  As  detailed  further below,  in  developing  and implementing  the Policy,  DHS \n8  officials engaged in extensive communication regarding the Executive Order. Defendants also \n9  issued several new documents that incorporated or responded to the Executive Order and prepared \n10  to explain to members of Congress why they were now invoking 40 U.S.C. § 1315 to perform the \n11  activities under the Policy. \n12  15.  In addition, DOJ and/or DHS have engaged in a variety of unauthorized activities \n13  under the Policy. Such activities in Portland have included surveilling the text messages of \n14  protesters and building a fence that blocks the right-of-way on City property and refusing to \n15  remove it upon request of City officials. DHS’s inspector general also concluded recently that \n16  memoranda issued in June and July 2020 by the Director of the Federal Protective Services \n17  (“FPS”), a component of DHS, acted unlawfully by failing to identify specific officers and agents \n18  from other components of DHS as well as the U.S. Secret Service that were cross designated under \n19  40 U.S.C. § 1315 to deploy under the Policy. \n20  16.  Even after the significant deployment of federal agents into Portland as well as \n21  smaller operations in other U.S. cities, President Trump expressed an intent to expand or at least \n22  continue the Policy. President Trump stated: “We’re going to have more federal law enforcement. \n23  That I can tell you.”—while threatening to send federal agents into major cities “run by liberal \n24  Democrats.”  For  instance,  he  said:  “We’re  not  going  to  let  New  York  and  Chicago,  and \n25  Philadelphia and Detroit and Baltimore and all of these—Oakland is a mess. We’re not going to \n26  let this happen in our country.”  \n27  17.  These threats were not new. President Trump has long threatened American cities \n28  led by Democrats. But as recently as April 2020, Defendants did not purport to have, or act in \n- 5 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 6 of 66\n \n \n1  accordance with, the authority they now assert under the Policy. In April, numerous public \n2  monuments, memorials, and statues were under equal or greater threat from armed and uncivil \n3  protesters  who  opposed  public  health  measures  to  control  COVID-19.  But  those protesters \n4  expressed a different set of political views than the majority of those protesting after May 25, 2020 \n5  and before the events of January 6, 2021, and no policy was then in effect to allow or require the \n6  type of federal decisions and operations now occurring or allowed to occur under the Policy. \n7  18.  Importantly, events in Washington, D.C., both in Lafayette Square Park on June 1, \n8  2020 and around the U.S. Capitol on and around January 6, 2021, shed further light on the \n9  pretextual nature of the Policy’s purported “federal property preservation” rationale.  \n10  19.  In June 2020, federal agents, including Defendants, used overwhelming force \n11  (including tear gas, batons, chemical irritants, projectiles, and flash grenades) to quell a largely \n12  peaceful protest supporting Black Lives Matter on or near federal property in Lafayette Square \n13  Park.  On  information  and  belief,  those  federal  agents,  including  Defendants,  did  not  have \n14  information or intelligence suggesting that there were significant, credible threats to federal \n15  property prior to these protests. \n16  20.  In January 2021, federal agents, including Defendants, did not similarly respond to \n17  significant information (including internal intelligence assessments, reports, and official warnings) \n18  that extremists were traveling to Washington, D.C., the site of numerous federal properties under \n19  Defendants’ protection per 40 U.S.C. § 1315 and home to innumerable federal monuments, \n20  memorials, and statues, to commit violence, attack federal properties and people within them, and \n21  engage in “war.” Through their non-response, a riotous and insurrectionist mob comprised mostly \n22  of White people and supporting President Trump’s dangerous election conspiracy theories was \n23  able to gather on and travel across federal properties and by many monuments, memorials, and \n24  statues unmolested; breach the Capitol; and pose a direct threat to a joint session of Congress.    \n25  21.  When these two situations are compared, it is clear that Defendants and other \n26  federal agencies and components did not respond based the level of threat to federal property or \n27  personnel, or the violence that occurred.  \n28 \n- 6 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 7 of 66\n \n \n1  22.  It is also clear that Defendants’ Policy for responding to threats to and violence on \n2  or around federal property cannot merely be the facially neutral standards of 40 U.S.C. § 1315. \n3  Nor can Defendants’ Policy be attributed merely to law enforcement discretion, as any ordinary \n4  and constitutional exercise of such discretion would lead to a reasonably proportionate response \n5  based on the level of threat to federal property. As this First Amended Complaint details here and \n6  below, there is no consistently and reasonably discernable connection between threats to federal \n7  property and Defendants’ responses to those threats.     \n8  23.  Due to both its overreach and pretextual nature, the Policy threatens to upend the \n9  current federalism structure and working relationships between local and federal law enforcement \n10  agencies. Section 1315 has never before been interpreted to permit the actions taken by Defendants \n11  under its auspices. Since June 2020, Plaintiffs have had and continue to have ongoing and \n12  significant uncertainty about how and whether Defendants will respond to certain types of threats, \n13  violence, or protests, depending on the viewpoint expressed by those issuing threats, committing \n14  violence, or engaging in protest. \n15  24.  Defendants have not and did not publicly rely on any of the limited authorities, as \n16  described below, that would lawfully allow deployments of federal agents within the parameters \n17  defined in such laws.  \n18  25.  The Policy is not merely a change in Defendants’ interpretation of their own \n19  enforcement authority. The Policy is based on a misunderstanding, misinterpretation, error, and/or \n20  disregard for the scope of Defendants’ legal authority. \n21  26.  Defendants have sought to cloak this final agency action as being merely a series \n22  of enforcement decisions. While the Policy relates to and influences enforcement choices, it is \n23  nevertheless a Policy. It is a Policy that lacks transparent or non-invidious guidelines on the \n24  deployment of federal personnel. It is a Policy that is in excess of the authority provided in the \n25  statute used to justify federal deployments. And it does not establish a viewpoint-neutral standard \n26  for when intervention by federal agents is appropriate. Instead, the Policy allows cross-designation \n27  and deployment irrespective of the actual or understood threat posed to federal property and based \n28  instead on impermissible viewpoint discrimination. \n- 7 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 8 of 66\n \n \n1  27.  Using the purported authority under the Policy or other, unknown authorities, \n2  Defendants have also instituted an unlawful practice in Portland of commandeering control of local \n3  law enforcement officers in direct contravention of the City’s express revocation of consent, and \n4  for unknown or pretextual ends (the “Practice”). \n5  28.  Based  on  information  and  belief,  the  Practice  is  similarly  in  response  to, \n6  incorporates, and/or is guided by, the Executive Order. \n7  29.  In addition, no constitutional authority has been offered for the related Practice of \n8  commandeering Portland’s law enforcement by refusing to release Portland law enforcement \n9  officers from their temporary deputation as federal agents, conscripting them without consent and \n10  against Portland’s express wishes.   \n11  30.  This monumental policy change and new commandeering practice harms Plaintiffs’ \n12  and other cities’ abilities to safely govern and police in ways aligned with and responsive to \n13  community goals and racial equity reforms. As local governments, Plaintiffs have independent \n14  police forces; community relationships; and locally determined policing policies, practices, and \n15  procedures. Plaintiffs’ police forces have always been able to expect when and how federal law \n16  enforcement agents could assert federal powers within their jurisdictions. The use of deployments \n17  and operations violating established constitutional parameters, politically motivated interventions, \n18  and lawless commandeering of local law enforcement are unconstitutional and unauthorized in \n19  part because of the havoc such actions impose on local jurisdictions and the innumerable ways in \n20  which these deployments run roughshod over the longstanding federalist balance of the general \n21  policing power.    \n22  31.  Plaintiffs are further harmed by the Policy and Practice because they threaten, \n23  intimidate, chill and/or discourage the exercise of constitutional or civil rights of their residents, \n24  leaders, and/or the jurisdictions themselves.  \n25  32.  The Policy and Practice also harm Plaintiffs to the extent they have and will \n26  continue to incite violence and make it more difficult for Plaintiffs to fulfill their core public safety \n27  missions.  \n28 \n- 8 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 9 of 66\n \n \n1  33.  Plaintiffs  are  additionally  harmed  by  their  increased  costs,  expenditures,  and \n2  resources devoted to responding to actions taken by Defendants under the Policy and Practice. \n3  34.  Harm to the Plaintiffs remains ongoing, because the Policy remains in place and \n4  leaves significant questions around and uncertainty about Defendants’ response to protests, civil \n5  unrest, and potential violence depending on the viewpoint of the individuals and governments \n6  involved. As of January 20, 2021, one day before the filing of this Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs \n7  were actively monitoring, among other things, potential threats of violence by a variety of groups \n8  in and around the inauguration of President Joseph R. Biden and related threats across the nation.    \n9  35.  In fact, on January  20, 2021, ostensibly to protect the federally owned U.S. \n10  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) facility in Portland, federal law enforcement \n11  officers declared an unlawful assembly with respect to hundreds of individuals gathered near, but \n12  largely not on, the federal property. Federal law enforcement used tear gas and other munitions to \n13  disperse the crowd for two blocks beyond the federal building.   \n14  36.  Plaintiffs therefore bring this action to enjoin Defendants’ new Policy and new \n15  Practice, which are unconstitutional, arbitrary and capricious, in excess of Defendants’ legal \n16  authority, and/or wholly pretextual.  \n17  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n18  37.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this is a civil action \n19  arising under the United States Constitution; the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. \n20  §§ 701-706; and other federal statutes. \n21  38.  This Court has the authority to issue declaratory and injunctive relief under the \n22  Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202, and the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n23  39.   Venue is proper in this judicial district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1). \n24  Defendants are United States officers or agencies sued in their official capacities, a substantial part \n25  of the events or omissions giving rise to this action have occurred or will occur in this district, and \n26  one Plaintiff resides in this district. \n27  // \n28  // \n- 9 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 10 of 66\n \n \n1  INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n2  40.  Pursuant to the Northern District Civil Local Rule 3-2(c)-(d), the intradistrict \n3  assignment should be to the Oakland or San Francisco Division because a substantial part of the \n4  acts or omissions that give rise to this action are occurring in the County of Alameda. \n5  PARTIES \n6  41.  The CITY OF PORTLAND is a municipal corporation governed by charter, located \n7  in the District of Oregon, and existing under the laws and constitution of the State of Oregon.  \n8  Portland is home to more than 650,000 residents, and the City’s leadership has committed to \n9  significant reforms to local policing and other policies, with an aim toward promoting racial \n10  justice. \n11  42.  The CITY of OAKLAND is a municipal corporation and charter city located in the \n12  Northern District of California, organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State \n13  of California. The City of Oakland is home to over 420,000 people and consistently ranks as one \n14  of the most ethnically and racially diverse major cities in the United States. Approximately 23% \n15  of Oakland’s residents identify as Black or African American, 26% as Hispanic or Latinx, 15% as \n16  Asian or Asian-American, and 5.5% as multi-racial. The City’s leadership is engaged in significant \n17  reforms to local policing and other policies, with an aim toward promoting racial justice. \n18  43.  Plaintiffs are aggrieved by Defendants’ actions and have standing to bring this \n19  action because the Policy and its implementation and the Practice harm Plaintiffs’ independent and \n20  constitutionally recognized economic, dignitary, and proprietary interests and will continue to \n21  cause injury unless and until the Policy is vacated and Defendants’ practices are permanently \n22  enjoined.  \n23  44.  ROBERT M. WILKINSON is the Acting United States Attorney General. He is \n24  sued in his official capacity.1  \n25   \n1 Per Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d): “An action does not abate when a public officer who \n26 \nis a party in an official capacity dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold office while the action is \npending. The officer’s successor is automatically substituted as a party. Later proceedings should \n27 \nbe in the substituted party’s name.” As such, Acting United States Attorney General Robert M. \n28  Wilkinson is automatically substituted for William Barr, and Acting Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity David P. Pekoske is automatically substituted for Chad Wolf. \n- 10 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 11 of 66\n \n \n1  45.  The UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE is a cabinet agency within \n2  the executive branch of the United States government and is an agency within the meaning of 5 \n3  U.S.C. § 552(f).  \n4  46.  DAVID P. PEKOSKE is the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security. He is sued in \n5  his official capacity.  \n6  47.  The  UNITED  STATES  DEPARTMENT  OF  HOMELAND  SECURITY  is  a \n7  cabinet agency within the executive branch of the United States government and is an agency \n8  within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f). Its stated missions involve anti-terrorism, border security, \n9  immigration and customs. It was created in 2002 by combining 22 different federal departments \n10  and agencies into a single Cabinet agency.  \n11  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n12  Background \n13  48.  Adherence to the Constitution is the bedrock of American democracy. Regardless \n14  of any changes to the interpretation of the Constitution over time, certain structures endure.  \n15  49.  One such foundational structure is the separation of federal powers: the division of \n16  authority and responsibility that guides all legal action taken in the United States. Under the \n17  separation of powers, the Congress makes law, the Executive Branch implements that law, and the \n18  Judiciary assesses the legality of those laws and actions. \n19  50.  Another foundational structure is federalism: the division or sharing of legal power \n20  between the national government and other government units, including states, counties, cities, \n21  parishes, commonwealths, territories, and tribal governments (hereafter “other governments”). \n22  Other governments, including cities, “ensure[] that powers which ‘in the ordinary course of affairs, \n23  concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people’ [are] held by governments more local and \n24  more accountable than a distant federal bureaucracy.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 \n25  U.S. 519, 536 (2012) (quoting The Federalist No. 45 at 293 (J. Madison)). \n26  51.  A federalist system’s division of power evolves, but in expected ways, such as \n27  through Congress passing new laws to further regulate other governments, or other governments \n28  using the courts to push back on laws or rules made by the Congress or the Executive Branch.  \n- 11 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 12 of 66\n \n \n1  52.  Within this federalism framework and under the Tenth Amendment to the United \n2  States Constitution, the general police powers are left to the states, who in turn often delegate such \n3  plenary authority to cities like Plaintiffs. See, e.g., Cal. Const., art. 11, § 7; Or. Const., art XI, § 2. \n4  As the Supreme Court has long held, “the facets of governing that touch on citizens’ daily lives \n5  are normally administered by smaller governments closer to the governed.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. \n6  Bus., 567 U.S. at 536.   \n7  53.  Accordingly, the federal government has never created a federal domestic police \n8  force with broad powers. The general policing power, including over most violent crime, is left to \n9  other governments. As courts have repeatedly held, “We can think of no better example of the \n10  police power, which the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States, than \n11  the suppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims.” United States v. Morrison, 529 \n12  U.S. 598, 618 (2000). \n13  54.  Instead, where Congress has authorized, the Executive Branch has executed, and \n14  the Judiciary approved, the federal government has created a constellation of different law \n15  enforcement agencies, each of which has a specific domain of authority as defined by federal \n16  statutes. For the most part, those domains of authority are not coextensive with other governments’ \n17  general policing power. \n18  55.  Within the scope of those federal statutes, such federal law enforcement activities \n19  have been limited to: (a) the enforcement of a direct federal interest (e.g., enforcement of a federal \n20  law); or (b) assisting other governments, which constitutes the enforcement of an indirect federal \n21  interest. \n22  56.  Whether enforcing a direct federal interest or assisting other governments, federal \n23  law enforcement acts within prescribed legal bounds. Either federal law enforcement is invited by \n24  other governments to participate in any number of lawful collaborative activities or federal law \n25  enforcement may intervene without invitation in the circumstances where federal law permits. \n26  57.  In the former category of invited collaboration, Plaintiffs have, like many other \n27  cities, frequently engaged in lawful partnerships with federal law enforcement. From subject-\n28  specific task forces to investigating borderless crimes, other governments often depend on and \n- 12 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 13 of 66\n \n \n1  engage with federal law enforcement to help protect residents and visitors. Plaintiffs have, for \n2  example, partnered with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on child exploitation task forces; with \n3  the Drug Enforcement Administration to combat illegal drug trafficking; with the Bureau of \n4  Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to proactively identify the source of guns used for \n5  crimes; with the United States Marshals Service (“USMS”) to apprehend those fleeing the justice \n6  system; and with the Secret Service to tackle identity theft.  \n7  58.  These past and present local-federal relationships are voluntary and consensual. \n8  Federal law enforcement and local law enforcement agencies generally work together in Plaintiffs’ \n9  communities with a mutual understanding of the mission, clear directives regarding jurisdictional \n10  functions, and specific agreements (e.g., via Memoranda of Understanding or Agreement) that \n11  inform both sides of their respective obligations. Such partnerships were and are authorized by \n12  law, typically memorialized by mutual agreement, and not the subject of this lawsuit. \n13  59.  In the latter category of uninvited intervention, the federal government has certain \n14  powers that are superior to those of other governments, made so by the Supremacy Clause.  \n15  60.  Such powers include federal enforcement of crucial fundamental federal rights, \n16  including civil rights. Throughout the nation’s history, federal enforcement authorities have at \n17  times  overridden  other  governments’  ignorant  or  bigoted  refusals  to  grant  or  defend \n18  constitutionally protected rights. Whether desegregating schools or extending the voting franchise \n19  to Black people, federal enforcement—without invitation or local approval—has been at times \n20  both lawful and vital. \n21  61.  Such intervention powers may also, in extraordinary circumstances, permit the \n22  deployment of federal forces domestically, in which federal law enforcement temporarily takes \n23  over the general police powers otherwise reserved to other governments. Such circumstances are \n24  constitutionally delineated by Article I, Section 8, one of the Militia Clauses (allowing Congress \n25  to “call[] forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union”) and by Article IV, Section 4 (the \n26  obligation to protect the states against invasion and against “domestic violence”).  \n27  62.  The Constitution reserves both of those described powers for the Legislative \n28  Branch, either exclusively or principally. The cited Militia Clause only gives power to Congress. \n- 13 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 14 of 66\n \n \n1  The Article IV Republican Form of Government Clause gives power first to the Legislature, and \n2  then only to the Executive “when the Legislature cannot be convened.” \n3  63.  Under these authorities, Congress has, among other things, passed the Insurrection \n4  Act of 1807, now codified as amended at 10 U.S.C. §§ 251-255, which allows domestic military \n5  intervention when circumstances make it impracticable to enforce the law by any other means, and \n6  the complementary Posse Comitatus Act of 1876, now codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1385, eliminating \n7  virtually any use of the military to regulate American civilians. \n8  64.  These laws represent some key legal guardrails constitutionally implemented by \n9  the Legislative Branch to limit and define where the Executive Branch may, without permission \n10  and while overriding other governments’ prerogatives, nonetheless enforce federal law. \n11  65.  Specifically, the Insurrection Act empowers the President to call into service the \n12  United States Armed Forces and the National Guard: (a) when formally requested by a state; (b) \n13  to address an insurrection in any state, when that insurrection makes it impracticable to otherwise \n14  enforce the law; or (c) to address an insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination or \n15  conspiracy, in any state, which results in the deprivation of constitutionally secured rights, and \n16  where the state is unable, fails, or refuses to protect those rights. 10 U.S.C. §§ 251-253. \n17  66.  There is a set legal process for invoking the Insurrection Act that is neither \n18  clandestine nor equivocal. To invoke the Act, a president must issue a “proclamation to disperse”: \n19  that is, “by proclamation, immediately order the insurgents to disperse and retire peaceably to their \n20  abodes within a limited time.” 10 U.S.C. § 254. Such proclamations have been issued as Executive \n21  Orders and/or as Proclamations published in the Federal Register.  \n22  67.  The Insurrection Act has never been invoked in the 21st century. In its limited usage \n23  in  the  20th  century,  the  federal  government  often  invoked  the  Act  to  protect  civil  rights, \n24  particularly the rights of Black children to attend desegregated schools.  \n25  68.  When the Act was most recently invoked, in 1992, then-President George H.W. \n26  Bush issued a general Proclamation and an operationalizing Executive Order. See Proclamation \n27  No. 6427, 57 Fed. Reg. 19,359 (May 1, 1992); Exec. Order No. 12804, 57 Fed. Reg. 19,361 (May \n28  1, 1992). Executive Order 12804 provided detailed instructions for Cabinet officials to respond to \n- 14 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 15 of 66\n \n \n1  the alleged insurrection in California. Among other things, it directed the Attorney General: “(1) \n2  to coordinate the activities of all Federal agencies assisting in the suppression of violence and in \n3  the administration of justice in and about the City and County of Los Angeles, and other districts \n4  of California, and (2) to coordinate the activities of all such agencies with those of State and local \n5  agencies similarly engaged.” \n6  69.  DOJ is aware of the legal process for invoking the Insurrection Act. As an agency, \n7  DOJ has typically been involved when the Insurrection Act is invoked.  \n8  70.  The Executive Branch’s authority under the Act, or under other such extraordinary \n9  emergency powers, does not undergird the Policy.  \n10  71.  Any invocations of emergency powers or interventions under those powers are rare, \n11  reserved for extraordinary circumstances, and are not the subject of this lawsuit. \n12  72.  Finally, Executive Branch agencies, endowed by Congress or the Constitution with \n13  particular powers, must, per Article II, Section 3, “take care” to execute their duties under those \n14  authorities. Sometimes, those authorities are clearly defined by statute or a provision of the \n15  Constitution. At other times, those authorities are further crystalized and concretized by Executive \n16  Branch interpretations of the authority so granted. Those interpretations come in forms such as \n17  regulations, rules, and myriad types of sub-regulatory guidance.  \n18  73.  The legality of such Executive Branch interpretations of its authority is easily \n19  tested, commonly through the APA, which governs how the Executive Branch creates and acts on \n20  those interpretations, and what those interpretations are. Stated simply, the APA is a key method \n21  by which the Judiciary may assess the legality of the Executive Branch’s interpretation of its \n22  powers,  including  whether  such  interpretations  are  “arbitrary  and  capricious,”  “contrary  to \n23  constitutional right[s],” or “in excess of statutory authority.” 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n24  74.  Such Executive Branch interpretations of its authority may also be tested through \n25  other legal means, such as by questioning their constitutionality directly in federal court. \n26  75.  Such Executive Branch interpretations are the subject of this lawsuit. \n27  76.  As these recitations reflect, the federal government has lawful tools to intervene— \n28 \n- 15 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 16 of 66\n \n \n1  voluntarily  or  involuntarily—in  other  governments’  exercise  of  their  police  powers.  These \n2  recitations also reflect that those tools are either used with mutual agreement, or without agreement \n3  in circumstances, such as those enumerated, rooted in the Constitution. Finally, these recitations \n4  reflect that the federal government follows lawful and expected paths to exercise authority over \n5  other governments. \n6  Policy Change Regarding Deployment and Operation of Federal Forces  \n7  77.  Consistent with the above framework, until recently, Plaintiffs believed that they \n8  understood the structure, procedures, and basis for both the invited and the uninvited deployment \n9  and operations of federal law enforcement agents into their communities.  \n10  78.  However,  in  2020,  following  the  direction  of  President  Trump,  Defendants \n11  instituted this new Policy, the full parameters of which are unknown, but that, at minimum, \n12  unlawfully expands the unilateral deployment, cross-designation, and operations of federal law \n13  enforcement to broadly assert general police powers in U.S. cities based on the viewpoints of the \n14  protesters, municipal leaders, or municipalities themselves.  \n15  79.  The Policy and each and every instance where Defendants, through their officers, \n16  employees, and/or agents, unlawfully deployed, cross-designated, or commanded federal law \n17  enforcement to act in excess of or contrary to 40 U.S.C. § 1315 or the Constitution constitute “final \n18  agency action” under the APA.  \n19  Prior Status Quo \n20  80.  President Trump long issued threats against cities he views as progressive or \n21  racially diverse, including Plaintiffs. In 2017, he threatened to “send in the feds” to Chicago if \n22  their mayor did not fix the “carnage,” and compared the city unfavorably to Afghanistan. In 2019, \n23  in describing Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco, he referred to these “sanctuary cities \n24  run by liberal people” as places where “people living there are living in hell,” and threatened that \n25  he might “intercede” or “may do something to get that whole thing cleaned up.” In 2020, he \n26  repeatedly threatened Plaintiffs Portland and Oakland. \n27  81.  Separately, after President Trump took office, Americans engaged in some of the \n28  largest peaceful protests in our nation’s history. The day after his inauguration, between 3.2 million \n- 16 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 17 of 66\n \n \n1  and 5.2 million people marched in the streets to protest for women’s rights and against the \n2  President. Hundreds of thousands protested again for the same reason on the same day in the \n3  following years. Since January 2017, millions of people have participated in protests across the \n4  country, including protests at federal property, monuments, memorials, and statues, as well as at \n5  state and local property, monuments, memorials, and statues. \n6  82.  Despite President Trump’s repeated threats, and despite thousands of protests by \n7  millions of Americans, Defendants never previously asserted or exercised the authority they are \n8  now asserting and exercising under the Policy, nor, on information and belief, engaged in the \n9  related Practice.  \n10  83.  An alleged source of the authority for the Policy is 40 U.S.C. § 1315. Under \n11  subsection (a) of that statute, the Secretary of Homeland Security protects the buildings, grounds, \n12  and property that are owned, occupied, or secured by the federal government.  \n13  84.  Although FPS, a division of DHS, is typically the main provider of security and \n14  law enforcement services at federal government facilities, the Secretary of Homeland Security may \n15  transfer DHS officers or agents specifically “for duty in connection with the protection of” that \n16  federal property. 40 U.S.C. § 1315(b)(1).  \n17  85.  The scope of 40 U.S.C. § 1315 is clear. The statute states that the Secretary of \n18  Homeland Security: “shall protect the buildings, grounds, and property that are owned, occupied, \n19  or secured by the Federal Government (including any agency, instrumentality, or wholly owned \n20  or mixed-ownership corporation thereof) and the persons on the property.” Id. § 1315(a).  \n21  86.  Based on information and belief and on publicly available facts such as those \n22  recited here, until as recently as May 2020, there had been no policy or practice through which \n23  Defendants unilaterally deployed or commanded federal law enforcement under 40 U.S.C. § 1315 \n24  for general police purposes; to respond to or quash civil protests; to protect and surveil non-federal \n25  property, monuments, memorials, or statues; or to unilaterally take over non-federal property.  \n26  87.  Based on information and belief and on publicly available facts such as those \n27  recited here, until as recently as May 2020, there had been no policy or practice through which \n28  Defendants unilaterally deployed or commanded federal law enforcement to quell civil protests \n- 17 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 18 of 66\n \n \n1  expressing a viewpoint with which the President disagreed based on the pretext of protecting \n2  federal property. \n3  88.  For example, as recently as April 2020, hundreds of protesters gathered at the \n4  Michigan State Capitol in Lansing to protest executive orders and shelter-in-place orders in light \n5  of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n6  89.  The Michigan State Capitol was completed in 1878, has been listed on the National \n7  Register of Historic Places since 1971, and was designated as a National Historic Landmark in \n8  1992. The Capitol and its grounds contain at least one monument, three memorials, and several \n9  statues. The Capitol is 0.1 miles from the Charles E. Chamberlain Federal Building and Post \n10  Office. \n11  90.  During  these  so-called  “lockdown  protests,”  many  protesters  openly  carried \n12  firearms in or around the Capitol, forcibly entered the Michigan State Capitol, issued threats \n13  against Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and verbally assaulted Michigan state police. \n14  91.   When these armed protesters objecting to COVID-19 quarantine measures rallied \n15  in the Michigan Capitol, President Trump called them “very good people” and urged Governor \n16  Whitmer to “give a little” in response to the protesters’ objections.   \n17  92.  Earlier, in the spring, President Trump had encouraged his supporter to “liberate” \n18  Michigan as well as Minnesota in response to strict restrictions responding aimed to stop the spread \n19  of COVID-19.  \n20  93.  As another example, in both April and May 2020, hundreds of protesters gathering \n21  at the Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg to protest executive orders and shelter-in-place \n22  orders in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n23  94.  The Pennsylvania State Capitol was built in 1906, has been listed on the National \n24  Register of Historic Places since 1977, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2006. \n25  The Capitol and its grounds contain at least three monuments and several statues. The Capitol is \n26  approximately 0.2 miles from the Ronald Reagan Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse. \n27  95.  During  these  so-called  “lockdown  protests,”  some  protesters  openly  carried \n28  firearms in or around the Pennsylvania State Capitol. \n- 18 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 19 of 66\n \n \n1  96.  As  another  example,  in  April  2020,  hundreds  of  protesters  gathered  at  the \n2  Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison to protest executive orders and shelter-in-place orders in light \n3  of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n4  97.  The Wisconsin State Capitol was completed in 1917 and was designated a National \n5  Historic Landmark in 2001. The Capitol is approximately 0.4 miles from the U.S. Courthouse in \n6  Madison.  \n7  98.  During  these  so-called  “lockdown  protests,”  some  protesters  openly  carried \n8  firearms, including long guns, in or around the Wisconsin State Capitol. \n9  99.  As another example, as recently as May 2020, hundreds of protesters gathered at \n10  the California State Capitol in Sacramento to protest executive orders and shelter-in-place orders \n11  in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n12  100.  The California State Capitol was completed in 1874, has been listed on the National \n13  Register of Historic Places since 1973, and was designated as a California Historical Landmark in \n14  1974. The Capitol and its park are home to numerous monuments, memorials, and statues, \n15  including the World Peace Rose Garden, the California Peace Officers’ Memorial, the Vietnam \n16  Veterans Memorial, and the Thomas Starr King Memorial. The Capitol is one mile from the local \n17  federal courthouse and under one mile from the local DHS office. \n18  101.  During these so-called “lockdown protests,” protesters gathered at the Capitol in \n19  violation of stay-at-home orders, confronted California Highway Patrol officers, and displayed \n20  depictions of California Governor Gavin Newsom as a Nazi in front of a Swastika banner.  \n21  102.  In April and May, protesters also gathered outside the State Capitol in Salem, \n22  Oregon. At least one protester appears to be open carrying a rifle in news footage. Members of the \n23  far-right militia groups the “Three Percenters” and “Proud Boys” also attended the protests. \n24  Several of the protests were allegedly organized by militia groups in violation of Oregon Governor \n25  Kate Brown’s stay-at-home orders.  \n26  103.  In December, protesters carrying firearms and bear spray, including members of \n27  the far-right group Patriot Prayer, gathered at the Oregon State Capitol in Salem to protest COVID-\n28 \n- 19 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 20 of 66\n \n \n1  19 restrictions. Members of this group stormed the Oregon statehouse, broke windows, and \n2  attempted to gain access to the building.  \n3  104.  Based  on  information  and  belief,  federal  law  enforcement  officers  were  not \n4  deployed in response to any of these so-called “lockdown protests”; were not directed to surveil \n5  the protesters or public officials; did not to assess threats to public buildings, monuments, \n6  memorials, or statues; did not to protect against civil unrest; and were not to otherwise engaged in \n7  general policing. \n8  105.  In fact, in many instances, President Trump and his administration encouraged and \n9  emboldened supporters to protest against these COVID-19 restrictions, including through the \n10  display of weapons and other threats of force and violence.  \n11  Existing Framework for Local Law Enforcement Mutual Aid or Cross Designation with Other \nGovernment Agencies \n12 \n13  106.  As described above, there are numerous examples of how local law enforcement, \n14  including Plaintiffs’ police departments, collaborate with or receive assistance from other law \n15  enforcement agencies, including federal law enforcement agencies such as Defendants and their \n16  subcomponents.  \n17  107.  Coordinating with local law enforcement has, outside of the Policy and Practice, \n18  been fundamental to how federal law enforcement agencies interact with their local counterparts. \n19  108.  Even in circumstances where the local jurisdiction has policies that are directly in \n20  opposition to the federal law enforcement agency’s activities, the federal agencies, including \n21  Defendants,  have  nonetheless  coordinated  with  local  agencies  in  some  fashion,  given  the \n22  longstanding recognition of the importance of such coordination. \n23  109.  For example, 28 C.F.R. § 0.112 governs special deputation powers of the USMS, \n24  which is a bureau within DOJ. Pursuant to this section, the USMS Director is authorized to \n25  deputize, in relevant part, “[s]elected federal, state, or local law enforcement officers whenever the \n26  law enforcement needs of the U.S. Marshals Service so require.” 28 C.F.R. § 0.112(b).  \n27 \n28 \n- 20 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 21 of 66\n \n \n1  110.  The duties of the USMS include protecting the federal judiciary, apprehending \n2  federal fugitives, managing and selling seized assets illegally acquired by criminals, housing and \n3  transporting federal prisoners, and operating the Witness Security Program.  \n4  111.  Separately, Plaintiffs have also long entered into and relied on “mutual aid” \n5  agreements with fellow local governments, such as other city and county governments. These \n6  mutual aid agreements set forth the circumstances under which mutual aid partners will come to \n7  the assistance of a member of the agreement. For example, Oakland has requested assistance from \n8  its mutual aid partners, such as Alameda County and surrounding cities, in responding to natural \n9  disasters or to certain violent “Occupy” protests a decade ago. It is not uncommon for mutual aid \n10  partners to request dozens or even hundreds of officers to assist with significant needs. Indeed, in \n11  response to the recent demonstrations, Portland has sought and received mutual aid from numerous \n12  other local law enforcement agencies. \n13  112.  No matter the originating source of the mutual aid, Plaintiffs’ police departments \n14  follow specific procedures when any outside law enforcement participate in their operations, or \n15  when outside law enforcement perform operations in their cities. \n16  113.  Those procedures typically include that, when any outside law enforcement agency \n17  comes to assist Plaintiffs’ police departments, those outside agents or officers first check in at the \n18  local staging center or emergency operations center, learn of the operation plan, and are connected \n19  in some manner to the department’s communications systems. These universal steps are designed \n20  to protect all law enforcement officers and ensure they are operating with similar information and \n21  shared means of communication. \n22  Nationwide Protests for Racial Justice and Police Reform  \n23  114.  On May 25, 2020, George Floyd was tragically killed by Minneapolis police and a \n24  video of his death was widely circulated in the media. On May 26, 2020, people gathered in \n25  Minneapolis in protest. Shortly thereafter, people gathered throughout the nation, including in \n26  Plaintiffs’ jurisdictions, to advocate for police reform and racial justice.  \n27 \n28 \n- 21 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 22 of 66\n \n \n1  115.  Polls have suggested that between 15 million and 26 million people participated in \n2  these protests, making them the largest demonstrations in American history. Between May 22 and \n3  August 22, approximately 93% of protests were peaceful. \n4  116.  Incidents of property damage and violence, however, were  reported in many \n5  jurisdictions in the country. Incidents of property damage occurred in suburban California, and \n6  armed civilians and other non-state actors committed acts of violence in states including Florida, \n7  Indiana, and Tennessee. \n8  117.  People  began  to  gather  in  Downtown Portland  on  or  around  May  29,  2020, \n9  including at an event titled “A Eulogy for Black America” organized by the Portland chapter of \n10  the NAACP. \n11  118.  On May 29, 2020, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler issued a statement that he stood \n12  “in solidarity with those who grieve for the senseless death of George Floyd” and committed to \n13  standing alongside “our black community and not just call out racism when we see it, but \n14  meaningfully take a stand against it.” \n15  119.  In Portland, protests continued in June. The first few days of June were identified \n16  as having the largest crowds of the Portland George Floyd protests, with numbers exceeding \n17  10,000 people each day. During this time, a much smaller group of people engaged in significant \n18  property damage and violence directed at police. Notwithstanding some criminal activity, the \n19  majority of the protests remained peaceful, and toward the end of June, the scale of protests began \n20  to decrease. The focal points of protests during June were the Justice Center (which houses the \n21  Portland  Police  Bureau’s  (“PPB’s”)  Central  Precinct  and  primary  offices,  as  well  as  the \n22  Multnomah County Detention Center) and other PPB and Multnomah County buildings. At times \n23  these protests occurred at or near the Hatfield Federal Courthouse, which is across the street from \n24  Justice Center.  \n25  120.  Portland was not alone in experiencing protests, nor alone in experiencing major or \n26  minor threats to federal property. According to FPS officials, between May 28, 2020 and June 10, \n27  2020, FPS responded to “168 protests and more than 168 attacks at federal facilities,” including in \n28 \n- 22 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 23 of 66\n \n \n1  places ranging from Concord, New Hampshire to Dallas, Texas to Fort Lauderdale, Florida to \n2  Phoenix, Arizona.  \n3  121.  Further, FPS officials reported that, in that timeframe, “133 Federal facilities . . . \n4  sustained vandalism/damage,” including in Dallas, where “FPS Officers discovered what appears \n5  to be bullet holes in windows on floors 9-13 at the Earl[e] Cabel[l] Federal Building and US \n6  Courthouse.” In other communications, FPS officials reported vandalism, graffiti, damage, and \n7  broken windows at the U.S. Courthouse in Las Vegas, as well as multiple threats to the Richmond \n8  Federal Courthouse in Richmond, Virginia, including vandalism from spray paint and individuals \n9  discussing “burning down” the courthouse. \n10  122.  Yet despite those significant threats and actual damage to federal property, most of \n11  those cities were not subject to direct threats of intervention by President Trump, and only \n12  progressive cities like Portland were subject to deployments under the Policy. \n13  123.  At this time, President Trump continued his past practice of frequent and repeated \n14  threats to deploy uninvited federal law enforcement and/or military power to progressive cities.   \n15  124.  Protests continued nationally throughout June 2020, along with the President’s \n16  threatening rhetoric. \n17  President Trump Responds to Protests and Issues the Executive Order; Defendants Institute the \nPolicy \n18 \n \n19  125.  On May 29, 2020, three days after protests began in Minneapolis in response to the \n20  killing of George Floyd, President Trump threatened unilateral intervention and stated: “Either the \n21  very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, \n22  or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right.” \n23  126.  Three days later, during an address to the nation on June 1, 2020, President Trump \n24  stated: “I am your President of law and order . . . . If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that \n25  are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States \n26  military and quickly solve the problem for them.” \n27  127.  After the speech, federal law enforcement and the D.C. National Guard forcibly \n28  removed thousands of peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square Park with pepper-spray balls, \n- 23 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 24 of 66\n \n \n1  smoke canisters, flash-bang grenades, shields, and horses. After the protesters were cleared, \n2  President Trump, then-Attorney General William Barr, then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, and \n3  others walked from the White House through Lafayette Square for a photo opportunity at St. John’s \n4  Episcopal Church. \n5  128.  On June 5, 2020, President Trump criticized Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel \n6  Bowser  for  her  city’s  treatment  of  protesters.  President  Trump  called  the  mayor  “grossly \n7  incompetent, and in no way qualified to be running an important city like Washington, D.C. If the \n8  great men and women of the National Guard didn’t step forward, she would have looked no better \n9  than her counterpart Mayor in Minneapolis!” \n10  129.  On June 11, 2020, President Trump set his sights on Seattle, Washington where \n11  protests were ongoing. President Trump criticized both Governor Jay Inslee as well as Mayor \n12  Jenny Durkan: “[They] are being taunted and played at a level that our great Country has never \n13  seen before. Take back your city NOW. If you don’t do it, I will. This is not a game. These ugly \n14  Anarchists must be stopped IMMEDIATELY. MOVE FAST!” \n15  130.  One day later, President Trump attempted to increase the pressure by stating: \n16  “These Liberal Dems don’t have a clue. The terrorists burn and pillage our cities, and they think it \n17  is just wonderful, even the death. Must end this Seattle takeover now!” \n18  131.  Repeatedly and with great frequency during the month of June 2020, President \n19  Trump expressed disapproval about the response of local officials in Democratic-run cities to \n20  Black Lives Matter protests following the killing of George Floyd. President Trump sought to \n21  portray the largely peaceful protests as violent and dangerous and to characterize the cities’ \n22  response as weak and inadequate. \n23  132.  On information and belief, despite President Trump’s rhetoric and the rhetoric of \n24  others in his administration, at that time, there was no publicly available intelligence that there \n25  were credible and uniquely serious threats to federal property in any of the jurisdictions named by \n26  the President, nor were there any media or other reports of such intelligence or threats. Instead, as \n27  detailed above, numerous federal facilities in other cities were threatened or damaged in May and \n28  June 2020.  \n- 24 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 25 of 66\n \n \n1  133.  President Trump’s repeated public statements were part of the pretext for the \n2  issuance of Executive Order 13,933 and Defendants’ actions that followed. \n3  134.  Also during the month of June, President Trump expressed significant concern \n4  about progressive efforts to tear down and/or remove statutes and memorials dedicated to the racist \n5  and violent legacy of the Confederacy. \n6  135.  On June 24, 2020, the White House issued an official statement that: “We must \n7  build upon our heritage—not tear it down.”  One day later, President Trump added: “Very sad to \n8  see States allowing roving gangs of wise guys, anarchists & looters, many of them having no idea \n9  what they are doing, indiscriminately ripping down our statues and monuments to the past. Some \n10  are great works of art, but all represent our History & Heritage.” \n11  136.  None of the statues, memorials, or monuments referenced in these and other \n12  statements by the President or the White House were on federal property as defined by 40 U.S.C. \n13  § 1315. \n14  137.  On  June  26,  2020,  President  Trump  signed  Executive  Order  13,933,  entitled \n15  Protecting  American  Monuments,  Memorials,  and  Statues  and  Combating  Recent  Criminal \n16  Violence. \n17  138.  The Executive Order announced that the federal government would: (a) prosecute \n18  anyone  vandalizing  or  desecrating  public  monuments,  memorials,  and  statues;  government \n19  property; or religious property; (b) prosecute anyone inciting related violence; and (c) withhold \n20  federal support from local and state governments that failed to protect such structures from \n21  vandalism.  \n22  139.  The Executive Order further stated that if the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary \n23  of Homeland Security, or the Administrator of General Services requested federal personnel “to \n24  assist with the protection of Federal monuments, memorials, statues, or property,” they “shall” be \n25  provided by the Department of Defense, DOJ, and/or DHS.  \n26  140.  Defendants rapidly began to implement this Executive Order, consistent with \n27  President Trump’s motivation of quelling Black Lives Matter protests, targeting Democratic cities, \n28 \n- 25 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 26 of 66\n \n \n1  and establishing broad federal police presence in certain cities. These actions were taken pursuant \n2  to the Policy and are further evidence of the existence of the Policy. \n3  141.  First, on or around June 30, then-Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad \n4  Wolf (acting without proper authority) issued a memorandum to CBP, ICE, the Transportation \n5  Security Administration (“TSA”), Secret Service, FPS, I&A, and other subcomponents of DHS \n6  entitled “DHS Support to Protect Federal Facilities and Property,” in which Mr. Wolf stated that \n7  his memo and other actions were “in furtherance of” the Executive Order, and that DHS was \n8  coordinating  with  Defendant  DOJ  as  well  as  the  Department  of  the  Interior  “to  establish \n9  information/intelligence sharing and resource coordination.”  \n10  142.  In that memorandum, Mr. Wolf also announced the formal formation of PACT \n11  within DHS. PACT was charged with “conduct[ing] ongoing assessments of potential civil unrest \n12  or destruction and allocat[ing] resources to protect people and property,” including “potential surge \n13  activity to ensure the continuing protection of critical locations.”  \n14  143.  Second,  on  or  around  July  1,  2020,  leadership  (the  Office  of  the  Executive \n15  Secretariat) of FPS, a subcomponent of DHS, circulated a draft Education and Training Bulletin, \n16  ETB 20-0004, to the DHS Office of General Counsel (“OGC”) and the Office of Operations \n17  Coordination, requesting comments and “clearance” (i.e., high-level government approval) of the \n18  document. The contents of ETB 20-0004 are unknown, but its existence was revealed in response \n19  to a Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request for documents, including those created by \n20  Defendant DHS in response to the Executive Order.  \n21  144.  Third, and potentially as an element or component of ETB 20-0004, Defendants \n22  began changing or continuing to change guidance regarding the lawful scope of federal activity \n23  under 40 U.S.C. § 1315. Rather than limiting federal involvement under that statute to federal laws \n24  or property, Defendants expanded the ability of federal agents to address threats to any public \n25  monument, memorial, or statue, regardless of its federal nature.  \n26  145.  As another example, a July 2020 leaked, unclassified document entitled “Job Aid: \n27  DHS Office of Intelligence & Analysis (I&A) Activities in Furtherance of Protecting American \n28  Monuments, Memorials, Statues, and Combatting Recent Criminal Violence” (“Job Aid”) shows \n- 26 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 27 of 66\n \n \n1  that parts of the Defendants’ intelligence community were now authorized to monitor and collect \n2  information regarding protest activities beyond suspected or planned attacks on federal facilities, \n3  including threats to damage or destroy any public monument, memorial, or statue. \n4  146.  The “Job Aid” was intended to “expand[] intelligence activities necessary to \n5  mitigate the significant threat to homeland security articulated in the President’s executive order \n6  of June 26, 2020.” \n7  147.  At this time, emails produced in response to FOIA requests to Defendants show \n8  that FPS developed a “priority list of at-risk federal facilities, monuments and statues,” a list it \n9  began or continued to refine under the Policy. \n10  148.  At this time, DHS also began to develop rationales and justifications for the Policy. \n11  For instance, a Senior Legislative Affairs Advisor in Defendant DHS’ Office of Legislative Affairs \n12  (“OLA”) communicated to their OGC that someone(s) “will have questions on authorities” \n13  regarding FPS’ role in effectuating the Executive Order. Another member of the OLA team \n14  requested that a DHS official responsible for coordinating with Congress “be alerted” “when 40 \n15  U.S.C. § 1315 is being used in the protection of monuments, statues, etc.,” a request framed as \n16  necessary “given Members [of Congress] will likely have questions.” Such requests suggest that \n17  invocation of 40 U.S.C. § 1315 for this purpose was atypical or new. \n18  149.  Finally,  Defendants  began  deploying,  cross-designating,  and/or  commanding \n19  federal law enforcement agents pursuant to the Executive Order and the Policy.  \n20  150.  Specifically,  Mr.  Wolf  announced  the  deployment  and  pre-position  of  Rapid \n21  Deployment Teams across the country ahead of the July 4th holiday. Mr. Wolf stated that PACT \n22  would not “stand idly by while violent anarchists and rioters seek not only to vandalize and destroy \n23  the symbols of our nation, but to disrupt law and order and sow chaos in our communities.” \n24  151.  Defendants DHS and DOJ engaged in extensive communication, planning, requests \n25  for guidance, and other activity regarding deployments under the Policy, including possible \n26  deployments to several cities, as well as discussion of protecting various monuments in those \n27  locations.  \n28   \n- 27 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 28 of 66\n \n \n1  Deployment and Other Activities in Portland  \n2  152.  The following recitations are merely limited examples of why the Policy and/or \n3  specific acts in furtherance of the Policy constitute final agency action under which rights and \n4  obligations have been determined and from which legal consequences have flowed. \n5  153.  It is unclear how many deployments of federal agents were made pursuant to the \n6  Policy. In addition to the deployment to Portland described below, Defendants sent personnel to \n7  Seattle in advance of the July 4th holiday as well.   \n8  154.  In the days before Defendants deployed federal personnel to Portland, the crowds \n9  attending demonstrations had shrunk. By early July 2020, only about 150 people could be seen \n10  gathering in downtown Portland on any given night. \n11  155.  On or about July 2, 2020, Mr. Wolf ordered the deployment of DHS, USMS, U.S. \n12  Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), and the FPS to Portland in response to civil protests as \n13  part of Operation Diligent Valor. \n14  156.  Mr. Wolf purportedly designated approximately 114 ICE and CBP agents as FPS \n15  agents for purposes of Operation Diligent Valor \n16  157.  Defendants did not seek Portland’s consent. Defendants did not act at the direction \n17  of PPB incident command that had been policing nightly protests for over a month. \n18  158.  The federal forces deployed to Portland from CBP included members of BORTAC, \n19  a paramilitary unit of the United States Border Patrol. BORTAC troops wear military-type \n20  uniforms and armament, are trained for tactical raids on organized gangs smuggling persons or \n21  drugs into the United States, and have in the past been deployed to such places as Afghanistan and \n22  Iraq.  \n23  159.  On information and belief, BORTAC troops have no training in civilian crowd \n24  control or protection of First Amendment activities. \n25  160.  Through Operation Diligent Valor, Defendants sent teams of agents—untrained in \n26  crowd control and wearing military fatigues—onto Portland’s streets. Their uniforms bore no \n27  governmental, administrative or personal names, just the word “police” in tape. Federal agents \n28  used tactics and munitions that escalated violence in Portland. \n- 28 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 29 of 66\n \n \n1  161.  On or about July 11, 2020, federal agents allegedly fired impact munitions into an \n2  unarmed crowd. One of the bullets struck a protester and fractured his skull. \n3  162.  Starting  on  or  about  July  14,  2020,  federal  agents  drove around  Portland  in \n4  unmarked  vans  and  detained  individuals  associated  with  the  protests.  Federal  agents  were \n5  patrolling and detaining individuals far beyond the immediate vicinity of the federal courthouse. \n6  Agents allegedly seized at least one individual who was more than two blocks from the courthouse \n7  and not engaged in any activity related to federal property.  \n8  163.  Upon information and belief, federal agents seized multiple protesters and held \n9  them for hours before releasing them for lack of probable cause. The federal agents gave no \n10  justification for why they detained particular residents, searched their belongings, and placed \n11  residents in cells for hours before reading them their Miranda rights.  \n12  164.  Far from imposing peace in the City’s streets, the tactics and munitions used by \n13  federal agents antagonized demonstrators, escalated the protests, and caused further unrest.  \n14  165.  On July 22, 2020, federal agents fired tear gas into a crowd that included Portland \n15  Mayor Wheeler.  \n16  166.  Later  reports  of  internal  DHS  documents  showed  that  the  DHS’  Office  of \n17  Intelligence  Analysis  also  collected  and  analyzed  messages  between  protesters  in  Portland, \n18  specifically surveilling protesters’ communications via the Telegram messaging app, discussing \n19  where to take the protests and how to avoid officers. The purpose of this monitoring is still \n20  unknown. It is also unknown whether the surveillance was limited to the protection of federal \n21  property or gathered on federal property.  \n22  167.  On July 29, 2020, Governor Brown reached a negotiated agreement with the federal \n23  government. Defendants agreed to withdraw federal agents from Portland with assurance that \n24  Oregon State Police would take on additional duties guarding the safety of the federal courthouse \n25  in Portland.  \n26  168.  According to a November 2, 2020 report from the Office of the Inspector General \n27  of DHS (“OIG”), the Director of FPS issued memoranda in June and July 2020 that sought to \n28 \n- 29 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 30 of 66\n \n \n1  designate personnel from CBP, ICE, TSA, and Secret Service, pursuant to 40 U.S.C. § 1315(b)(1), \n2  including to Portland. \n3  169.  Those memoranda which sought to cross-designate federal agents to exercise \n4  authority under 40 U.S.C. § 1315 failed to specifically name the agents being so designated and \n5  failed to comply with the requirements of the statute. As a result of that shortcoming, the OIG \n6  could not confirm that all federal agents deployed pursuant to 40 U.S.C. § 1315 had received \n7  training about the scope of the statute.  \n8  170.  Such training and instruction were necessary for many of these cross-designated \n9  agents because “[l]aw enforcement officers from CBP, ICE, TSA, and Secret Service typically \n10  lack this precise scope of authority.” Some of these agents, the OIG concluded, used force during \n11  their deployment to Portland.  \n12  171.  Such  findings  from  the  OIG  contravene  Defendants’  statements  provided  to \n13  Congress in mid-2020 in a document entitled “Responses to the House Appropriations Committee \n14  Staff Questions Regarding the DHS Protecting American Communities Task Force (PACT),” \n15  which includes the statement that “[t]he [rapid deployment] teams consist of personnel who have \n16  requisite training to support security operations and respond to civil disturbances.”  \n17  172.  In sum, in furtherance of Executive Order 13,933 and at the direction of President \n18  Trump, Defendants established the Policy to police and suppress certain viewpoints, including \n19  support of the Black Lives Matter movement, through a number of means including those \n20  described above, all under the guise of protecting federal property. \n21  173.  U.S. Marshals Service officers were also present in Portland, operating side-by-side \n22  with DHS agents. Upon information and belief, then-Attorney General William Barr, acting in his \n23  official capacity, directed USMS agents to follow the Policy. \n24  Justifications for the Policy Are Pretextual \n25  174.  The purported purpose of the Portland deployment described above, an example of \n26  an act taken in furtherance of the Policy, was to protect federal property that had been vandalized \n27  or threatened during protests.  \n28 \n- 30 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 31 of 66\n \n \n1  175.  Anonymous  statements  from  White  House  Officials,  however,  indicate  such \n2  purpose was mere pretext. The sources alleged that President Trump became interested in federal \n3  operations against protesters in Portland as a way to convey a “law-and-order message” and to \n4  “amplify strife in cities.” \n5  176.  As stated above, DHS has cited 40 U.S.C. § 1315 as the legal basis for Operation \n6  Diligent Valor and the general practice of deploying federal agents to Portland and other locations, \n7  despite the observed scope and operations of agents being well beyond the purpose or function of \n8  protecting federal property or persons. \n9  177.  The  U.S.  Crisis  Monitor  found  that  prior  to  that  deployment,  “over  83%  of \n10  demonstrations  in  Oregon  were  non-violent.  Post-deployment,  the  percentage  of  violent \n11  demonstrations  [rose]  from  under  17%  to  over  42%  [in  Oregon],  suggesting that  the \n12  federal response has only aggravated unrest.” \n13  178.  Despite statements justifying deployments as responses to crime or “anarchy,” \n14  crime rates in Plaintiffs’ communities have been decreasing overall; neither city is in the list of top \n15  10 United States cities with the largest number of violent crimes per 100,000 residents. Moreover, \n16  Plaintiffs’ crime rates do not differ dramatically from those in other, Republican-run cities. For \n17  example, violent crime rates in Fresno, Jacksonville, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa—cities with \n18  Republican mayors—far exceed the violent crime rates in Portland. These cities also have murder \n19  rates at twice that of Portland.    \n20  179.  As stated above, Portland was also not alone in experiencing threats or harm to \n21  federal property. Instead, per FPS officials, at least 168 federal facilities contemporaneously \n22  experienced threats or harm, including in places such as Dallas, Richmond, and Phoenix. Some of \n23  those threats were serious, such as threats to burn down a federal courthouse. Yet Portland, not \n24  Dallas, Phoenix, Richmond, or other such cities, was a key city targeted for deployments under \n25  the Policy. \n26  180.  A  comprehensive  review  by  the  Armed  Conflict  Location  and  Event  Data \n27  (“ACLED”) Project and the Princeton University Bridging Divides Initiative underscores the \n28  overall peaceful nature of the social justice-related protests in summer 2020. Between May 25, \n- 31 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 32 of 66\n \n \n1  2020, and August 22, 2020, there were 7,750 Black Lives Matter-related demonstrations in 2,440 \n2  locations in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Overall, in summer 2020, there were at least 10,600 \n3  demonstrations across the United States. Of those, more than 93% involved only peaceful protests. \n4  And according to ACLED, violence occurred at around 220 locations. \n5  181.  President Trump and Defendants have repeatedly made public comments revealing \n6  that the officially stated goal of operations such as those in Portland was not protecting federal \n7  property. Instead, their statements suggest that the animating and invidious purpose for these \n8  actions—that is, for the Policy—is to punish progressive cities and leaders and violently quell the \n9  exercise of constitutionally protected activity. Specifically, the President’s, Defendants’, and \n10  Policy’s purpose is to further the view that diverse and/or progressive cities and their leaders, as \n11  well as movements for racial justice and police reform, are dangerous and should be suppressed. \n12  182.  At a White House event on July 13, 2020, President Trump claimed that “[f]ar-left \n13  mayors are escalating the anti-cop crusade, and violent crime is spiraling in their cities.” He \n14  pledged to be “very strong on law enforcement” by sending federal officers to “liberally run” \n15  jurisdictions—“even if we have to go in and take over cities.” \n16  183.   President  Trump  admitted  that  federal  agents  were  deployed  to  Portland \n17  specifically to quell protests: “We’ve done a great job in Portland. Portland was totally out of \n18  control, and they went in and, I guess, we have many people right now in jail. And we very much \n19  quelled it. And if it starts again, we’ll quell it again very easily. It’s not hard to do, if you know \n20  what you’re doing.”  \n21  184.  President Trump has also repeatedly falsely characterized the protesters as violent \n22  and dangerous. He stated that the goal was to “clean out this beehive of terrorists.” President Trump \n23  also stated that protesters are “anarchists” who “hate our country.”  \n24  185.  In addition, Mr. Wolf affirmed that actions taken under the Policy were without \n25  other governments’ consent, asserting: “The city of Portland has been under siege for 47 straight \n26  days by a violent mob while local political leaders refuse to restore order to protect their city . . . . \n27  I reiterate the Department’s offer to assist local and state leaders to bring an end to the violence \n28  perpetuated by anarchists.” \n- 32 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 33 of 66\n \n \n1  186.  Local and state leaders did not accept that offer.  \n2  187.  Local and state officials have repeatedly and vehemently stated their opposition to \n3  the federal deployment in Portland. Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum filed a lawsuit \n4  against the federal government to stop its deployment and tactics. Oregon Governor Brown stated: \n5  “This political theater from President Trump has nothing to do with public safety. The President \n6  is failing to lead this nation. Now he is deploying federal officers to patrol the streets of Portland \n7  in a blatant abuse of power by the federal government.”  \n8  188.  From the outset, the City of Portland expressed its opposition to the deployment of \n9  federal agents under Operation Diligent Valor without its consent.   \n10  189.  Only a few days after the federal agents were deployed, on July 8, 2020, Portland’s \n11  Deputy Police Chief Chris Davis made a public statement that the presence of federal agents, who \n12  are “governed by their own policies and procedures,” only “complicates things” for PPB.   \n13  190.  On July 19, 2020, Mayor Wheeler stated the following: \n14  What’s  happening  here  is,  we  have  dozens,  if  not  hundreds  of  federal  troops \ndescending upon our city. And what they’re doing is, they are sharply escalating the \n15 \nsituation . . . our local and state law enforcement officials had contained the situation \n. . . The tactics that the Trump administration are using on the streets of Portland are \n16 \nabhorrent . . . this is completely unconstitutional. \n17   \n18  191.  In response to the tactics and munitions used by federal agents, and consequent \n19  public outcry, on July 22, 2020, Portland’s City Council adopted Resolution 37496, which \n20  prohibits PPB cooperation with any federal agents deployed to Portland under an executive order. \n21  In response to Defendants’ actions under the Policy, on July 28, 2020, Oakland’s City Council \n22  adopted Resolution No. 88276 (“Directing And Authorizing The City Attorney And The City \n23  Administrator To Take Any And All Lawful Necessary Steps To Protect The Rights Of The People \n24  And The City Of Oakland Against President Trump’s Threats To Take Actions That Result In \n25  Harm To The People Of Oakland Or The City Of Oakland, And Against Any Related Actions \n26  Federal Officers Take That Result In Harm To The People Of Oakland Or The City Of Oakland”).     \n27  192.  The actions taken by Defendants in Portland under the Policy were not taken \n28  pursuant to any known lawful federal authority.  \n- 33 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 34 of 66\n \n \n1  193.  Further, as described above, Defendants’ failure to respond to the clear, imminent, \n2  extensive, and serious threats to Washington, D.C. on or around January 6, 2021, suggest that mere \n3  protection of federal property cannot be the justification for the Policy: if it were, Defendants \n4  would  have  responded  in  some  significant  fashion  based  on  threats  known  beforehand  by \n5  Defendants  and  other  federal  agencies  and  reportedly  described  by  the  Federal  Bureau  of \n6  Investigation (“FBI”), a subcomponent of Defendant DOJ, as individuals preparing for “war.” \n7  These are threats that Defendants and other federal agencies were well aware of before the January \n8  6 attack. \n9  194.  Upon information and belief, the administrative record will reveal that Defendants’ \n10  explanation  of  agency  action  is  incongruent  with  Defendants’  nonpublic  positions  and \n11  explanations. \n12  Plaintiffs Remain at Risk Under the Policy \n13 \n195.  Rather than retreat from the activities in Portland, Defendants expressed an intent \n14 \nto expand the presence of federal law enforcement throughout the United States. \n15 \n196.  President Trump indicated that, under the Policy, Defendants would continue to \n16 \ntarget cities he views as progressive, stating in early September: “They’ll make every city look \n17 \nlike frankly, a Portland, or you look at other Democrat-run cities. Look at what’s happened in New \n18 \nYork, as high as 300% increase in crime. Chicago, Baltimore, take a look at Oakland. All \n19 \nDemocrat-run top 10 cities in the country and long beyond that, all Democrat-run.”  \n20 \n197.  As recently as September 21, 2020, President Trump continued to propagate \n21 \ndisinformation about Plaintiffs. He stated: “What they’re talking about, you look at Portland, you \n22 \nlook at Chicago, you look at New York, you look at Baltimore and Oakland and all—these are \n23 \nDemocrat-run cities that are horrible on crime, there’s no law and order, no cash bail, no anything.” \n24 \n198.  Though most federal agents were temporarily pulled out of Portland, President \n25  Trump threatened that they could return at any time. President Trump also has stated the federal \n26 \ngovernment  would  further  escalate  any  conflict  if  local  law  enforcement  does  not  rein  in \n27 \n“anarchists and agitators.” He has consistently stated that he will not hesitate to send in federal \n28 \nauthorities if the local government could not stop “crime and violence” from breaking out. \n- 34 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 35 of 66\n \n \n1  199.  President Trump’s threats and warnings were not limited to federal property. He \n2  announced a plan to send law enforcement to polling places on election day, stating: “We’re going \n3  to have sheriffs, and we’re going to have law enforcement. And we’re going to have hopefully \n4  U.S. attorneys, and we’re going to have everybody and attorney generals.” \n5  200.  President  Trump’s  provocations  continued  throughout  the  remainder  of  his \n6  administration. He issued a memorandum purporting to direct Defendants to review federal \n7  funding provided to “anarchist” cities, including Portland, and to withdraw such funding to punish \n8  these cities. \n9  201.  Defendants continue to take unlawful actions under the Policy. For instance, FPS \n10  erected and refused to remove a fence and barriers around the Hatfield Federal Courthouse in \n11  Portland, which are in the City-controlled public right-of-way. The fence and barriers, which \n12  extended into adjacent Main Street, effectively blocked an entire bike lane without Portland’s \n13  permission. The fence and barriers also extended onto Third Avenue and effectively blocked \n14  vehicular travel in one lane. \n15  202.  The only statutory authority FPS has offered to Portland to justify the fence is 40 \n16  U.S.C. § 1315. \n17  203.   The fence was first erected by FPS on July 18, 2020. According to a statement \n18  from U.S. Attorney Billy J. Williams, the federal government’s stated purpose of the fence was \n19  “to de-escalate tensions between protesters and federal law enforcement officers, and to allow \n20  much-needed building repairs to begin.” \n21  204.  The fence is not on federal property, and FPS did not seek permission before \n22  erecting the fence. In order to lawfully erect the fence, Portland City Code Chapter 17.24 requires \n23  a permit to be obtained from the Portland Bureau of Transportation (“PBOT”). FPS obtained no \n24  such permit. \n25  205.  Portland has asked FPS multiple times to move its fence out of the right-of-way \n26  and onto the sidewalk adjacent to the Courthouse. FPS has not yet done so and has taken the \n27  position that they are permitted to install the fence and associated barriers pursuant to 40 U.S.C. \n28  § 1315.  \n- 35 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 36 of 66\n \n \n1  206.  In an October 7, 2020 email to Portland officials, FPS indicated its contractor had \n2  moved the fence to allow access to the storm drain and expected to move the fence back from the \n3  bike lane “in the next few weeks.” This is merely the latest assurance by FPS that it will move its \n4  fence. \n5  207.  Portland has implored FPS to remove the fence from the City-controlled right-of-\n6  way for six months. While FPS has removed the fence from the right-of-way on certain streets, as \n7  of January 19, 2021, the fence continues to block the public right-of-way on SW 3rd Avenue.  \n8  208.  Upon information and belief, Defendants either continue to have a presence in \n9  Portland or could be deployed to Portland on short notice, and there is a continued dispute \n10  regarding the scope of their authority under 40 U.S.C. § 1315, including the ability to unilaterally \n11  take over City-controlled or -owned property under a pretext of securing federal property. \n12  President Trump’s Incitement, Riot at U.S. Capitol, and Ongoing Threats to U.S. Cities \n13  209.   Following the Presidential election on November 3, 2020, President Trump began \n14  an unprecedented and dangerous attempt to overturn the outcome of the election through a variety \n15  of means, including the incitement of violence at the U.S. Capitol. \n16  210.  President Trump repeatedly stated that he had won in a landslide, that there was \n17  massive voter fraud, and that the results could not be trusted. He directed the DOJ to investigate \n18  allegations of voter fraud, even though there were no substantiated claims, and authorized his \n19  private legal team to file dozens of frivolous lawsuits around the country, virtually all of which \n20  were completely unsuccessful. \n21  211.  President Trump also explored other efforts to pressure election officials and others \n22  to overturn the election results. Those attempts included a lengthy January 2, 2021 telephone call \n23  to the Georgia Secretary of State, where President Trump asked the Secretary to “find” enough \n24  votes to overturn the election results. \n25  212.  President Trump also focused his efforts on the certification of the Electoral \n26  College vote during a joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021. In advance, President Trump \n27  promoted a rally among his supporters: “Come to D.C. January 6th to ‘StopTheSteal.’” \n28 \n- 36 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 37 of 66\n \n \n1  213.  On  January  1,  2021,  President  Trump  tweeted:  “The  BIG  Protest  Rally  in \n2  Washington, D.C. will take place at 11:00 A.M. on January 6th. Locational details to follow. \n3  StopTheSteal!” He also confirmed that he would be in attendance.  \n4  214.  Bolstered by President Trump’s invitation as well as continued allegations of \n5  election  fraud,  thousands  of  supporters  of  President  Trump  traveled  to  and  assembled  in \n6  Washington, D.C. on January 6. Many came with firearms, weapons, body armor, and/or other \n7  devices with the intention to cause damage to property, overcome federal law enforcement, and \n8  breach the U.S. Capitol. The FBI and other federal agencies issued nonpublic warnings prior to \n9  January 6 that these activities posed significant and serious threats to Washington, D.C., which \n10  contains large swathes of federal property under Defendants’ protection under the auspices of 40 \n11  U.S.C. § 1315. \n12  215.  During the January 6 rally, President Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani \n13  urged the crowd to engage in “trial by combat” while President Trump’s son Donald, Jr. warned \n14  unsupportive members of Congress “we’re coming for you.”  \n15  216.  While on stage at the rally, President Trump falsely insisted that Democrats had \n16  “stolen” the election, and that his supporters instead should “fight much harder” to “stop the steal” \n17  and “take back our country” at the Capitol. President Trump also falsely asserted that Vice \n18  President Mike Pence had the authority to reject the results of the Electoral College. \n19  217.  At the conclusion of the rally at the Ellipse near the White House, and following \n20  the direction of President Trump, the agitated crowd of violent supporters marched to the U.S. \n21  Capitol and breached the security perimeter, gained entry to the building, and interrupted the joint \n22  session for several hours. \n23  218.  In  addition,  extremists  placed  several  improvised  explosive  devices  in  other \n24  locations in Washington, D.C., including at the headquarters of both the Democratic National \n25  Committee and Republican National Committee. \n26  219.  A massive law enforcement effort is underway to identify, locate, and charge \n27  hundreds of individuals for the myriad crimes committed in connection with the threats to and \n28  violence in Washington, D.C., including the breach of the U.S. Capitol. \n- 37 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 38 of 66\n \n \n1  220.  Many components of law enforcement had intelligence that President Trump’s \n2  supporters were planning to engage in violent acts in advance of January 6. For example, the New \n3  York Police Department sent a packet of material to Capitol Police and the FBI including raw \n4  intelligence data, which indicated that there would likely be violence at the Capitol. In addition, \n5  the FBI’s Norfolk, Virginia Field Office found specific threats against members of Congress, an \n6  exchange of maps of the tunnel system under the Capitol complex, and gathering places in \n7  Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina where extremists were meeting before convoying up \n8  to Washington, D.C. Other federal law enforcement agencies reported on numerous plans to gather \n9  and commit violent acts in various locations in Washington, D.C. \n10  221.  In addition, many of the most extreme and violent organizers discussed their plans \n11  in the open through the use of social media and other online forums.  \n12  222.  Despite all of the information gathered and all of the reasons to believe that events \n13  at and around the U.S. Capitol on January 6 were likely to include violence, federal officials were \n14  not sufficiently prepared for the violence of the pro-Trump mob.  \n15  223.  In contrast to efforts in Washington, D.C. in June 2020 or in Portland in July 2020, \n16  federal officials did not prepare for or arrive at the scene of potentially threatened federal property \n17  equipped to deploy an aggressive display of force. \n18  224.  In contrast to its efforts in Portland during the summer of 2020, on information and \n19  belief, DHS’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis did not produce any threat assessment about the \n20  possibility of violence on January 6 at the U.S. Capitol, though some attackers used the same \n21  messaging platform, Telegram, that was allegedly used by protesters in Portland and was allegedly \n22  the subject of the surveillance described by I&A. \n23  225.  Some others in federal law enforcement have speculated that DHS did not produce \n24  a bulletin out of concern that doing so might run afoul of First Amendment free speech protections \n25  that allow people to protest and assemble peacefully. Such considerations were not similarly made \n26  in 2020 for protesters expressing support for Black Lives Matter. \n27 \n28 \n- 38 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 39 of 66\n \n \n1  226.  Upon information and belief, Defendants did not deploy or cross-designate agents \n2  pursuant to the Policy for January 6. Washington, D.C. is home to extensive amounts of federal \n3  property covered by 40 U.S.C. § 1315. \n4  227.  After the January 6 attack, in advance of Inauguration Day, federal agencies warned \n5  cities across the country about the possibility of further violence. For example, the FBI stood up a \n6  command post in Portland in anticipation of violent activities by right-wing groups and supporters \n7  of President Trump. \n8  228.  Plaintiffs have expended considerable resources planning for potential unrest.  \n9  229.  Because of Defendants inconsistent treatment of the mostly peaceful Black Lives \n10  Matter protesters of the summer of 2020 as compared to the pro-Trump violent mob on January 6, \n11  Plaintiffs have continued uncertainty about the degree to which they may expect future federal \n12  intervention should unrest unfold in their cities, and the terms under which such intervention would \n13  occur.      \n14  Mr. Wolf Was Unlawfully Acting as Secretary of Homeland Security, and Any Aspects of the \nPolicy Promulgated or Implemented Under His Purported Authority Must Be Set Aside \n15 \n16  230.  Federal service for positions which require Presidential appointment and Senate \n17  confirmation is governed by the Appointments Clause, U.S. Const. art. 2, § 2, cl. 2, and, among \n18  other statutes, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (“FVRA”), 5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq. When such \n19  a position becomes vacant, the FVRA sets default rules for who may serve as an acting official \n20  until an appointed nominee can be confirmed. Id. § 3345.  \n21  231.  However, these default rules do not apply if an agency-specific statute expressly \n22  designates who can serve in an acting capacity to lead the agency. Id. § 3347(a)(1)(B); 6 U.S.C.  § \n23  113(a)(1)(A), (g).   \n24  232.  The Homeland Security Act (“HSA”) is one such statute: in 6 U.S.C. § 113(g), the \n25  statute sets forth the agency-specific rules for filling vacancies and for succession. \n26  233.  Subsection (g)(1) of that statute has limits: it only explicitly states the order of \n27  succession through three roles (the Secretary, followed by the Deputy Secretary, followed by the \n28  Under Secretary for Management). 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(1). \n- 39 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 40 of 66\n \n \n1  234.  To establish a further order of succession beyond those three roles, “the Secretary \n2  may designate such other officers of the Department in further order of succession to serve as \n3  Acting Secretary.” Id. at (g)(2). Such further designation is explicitly contemplated in the FVRA. \n4  5 U.S.C. § 3347(a)(1)(A). \n5  235.  In the past, DHS Secretaries have exercised this authority to record orders of \n6  succession.  These  lawful  orders  are  broadly  contained  in  DHS  Orders  of  Succession  and \n7  Delegation of Authorities for Named Positions, Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Delegation No. 00106, \n8  Revision No. 08.5 (Dec. 15, 2016) (“DHS Orders”).  \n9  236.  From 2016 into 2019, the DHS Orders stated, “In case of the Secretary’s death, \n10  resignation, or inability to perform the functions of the Office, the orderly succession of officials \n11  is governed by Executive Order 13,753, amended on December 9, 2016.”  \n12  237.  Executive Order 13,753 (“E.O. 13,753”) set the following order of succession: (1) \n13  Deputy  Secretary;  (2)  Under  Secretary  for  Management;  (3)  Administrator  of  the  Federal \n14  Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”); (4) Under Secretary for National Protection and \n15  Programs (which was renamed the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security \n16  Agency in 2018); (5) Under Secretary for Science and Technology; (6) Under Secretary for \n17  Intelligence and Analysis; (6) Commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection; and so \n18  on. \n19  238.  In the same timeframe, the DHS Orders also included an “Annex A,” an order of \n20  temporary succession “in the event [the Secretary is] unavailable to act during a disaster or \n21  catastrophic emergency. DHS Orders at § II.B. Annex A, by its own terms, solely applied \n22  unavailability during disasters or emergencies. \n23  239.  As the last Senate-confirmed DHS Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, prepared to resign \n24  on April 10, 2019, she issued a new version of Annex A, purporting to revise the order of \n25  delegation of authority in that Annex.  \n26  240.  Again, by its own terms, this version of Annex A applied only to temporary \n27  unavailability during a disaster or emergency. It did not purport to apply to the order of succession \n28  in the case of resignation: that order was still governed by E.O. 13,753. \n- 40 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 41 of 66\n \n \n1  241.  Despite this, after Secretary Nielsen’s  resignation, CBP  Commissioner Kevin \n2  McAleenan  purported  to  serve  as  Acting  Secretary,  skipping  two  other  Senate-confirmed \n3  individuals in the lawful line of succession. \n4  242.  Mr. McAleenan’s purported succession was unlawful under the HSA and its related \n5  orders.  \n6  243.  Nevertheless, on November 8, 2019, Mr. McAleenan purported to revise the DHS \n7  Orders, attempting to (a) wholly replace E.O. 13,753’s order of succession with Annex A and (b) \n8  change the order of delegation of authority in Annex A.  \n9  244.  Were Mr. McAleenan’s actions lawful, E.O. 13,753’s order of succession in the \n10  event of resignation would be moot, and Annex A’s new order of delegation of authority would \n11  govern both in the event of unavailability due to disaster or emergency and in the event of \n12  resignation (or death or inability to perform the duties of the office). \n13  245.  Under the purported new DHS Orders incorporating the purported new Annex A, \n14  Mr. McAleenan resigned, and Mr. Wolf, who was the Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and \n15  Plans, assumed the position of Acting Secretary, his Under Secretary role having been purportedly \n16  pushed up the line of delegation of authority by Mr. McAleenan’s November 8, 2019 action.  \n17  246.  But Mr. Wolf was not lawfully serving in that role. Mr. McAleenan invalidly \n18  amended the line of succession, as he was not serving lawfully in the first instance (having \n19  unlawfully skipped two individuals in the line of lawfully promulgated succession under the \n20  original DHS Orders and E.O. 13,753). Because Mr. McAleenan’s attempted amendments were \n21  invalid, Mr. Wolf himself skipped an individual in the line of lawfully promulgated succession \n22  under the original DHS Orders and E.O. 13,753. \n23  247.  As explained above, the HSA governs who may lawfully serve as acting secretary \n24  of Homeland Security. However, the FVRA, not the HSA, defines when a “vacancy” occurs at \n25  the principal officer level, and controls what happens during a vacancy. 5 U.S.C. §§ 3346, 3348. \n26  248.  Specifically, the FVRA states that acting officers may serve for no longer than \n27  210 days starting the date the vacancy occurs or while the person’s nomination is pending in the \n28 \n- 41 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 42 of 66\n \n \n1  Senate, and that, after 210 days, unless there is someone lawfully in an acting role, the office \n2  “shall remain vacant” until the president submits a nominee for that role. Id.  \n3  249.  On or around April 10, 2019, Secretary Nielsen resigned. 210 days later, on \n4  November 6, 2019, no one had been lawfully serving as acting secretary and the president had \n5  not submitted a new nominee for the role. Nonetheless, Mr. Wolf took over that role.  \n6  250.  Because he was not lawfully serving under either the FVRA or HSA, actions \n7  taken by Mr. Wolf were “without force and effect.” 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(1). Actions promulgated \n8  “without force and effect” “may not be ratified.” Id. § 3348(d)(2).  \n9  251.  Mr. Wolf’s nomination to the role of DHS Secretary on September 10, 2020, did \n10  not automatically cure or ratify his past actions. \n11  252.  At least six federal district courts agree, wholly or in part, and have set aside DHS \n12  actions because Mr. McAleenan or Mr. Wolf (or both) unlawfully assumed the role of Acting DHS \n13  Secretary. See, e.g., Pangea Legal Services v. U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, et al., consolidated \n14  with Immigration Equality v. U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, et al., Nos. 20-CV-09253 and 20-\n15  CV-09258 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 8, 2021); Batalla Vidal v. Wolf, No. 16CV4756NGGVMS, 2020 WL \n16  6695076, at *9 (E.D.N.Y.

Mont. 2020) (holding that William Perry Pendley, \n22  the person exercising authority of the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, served \n23  unlawfully for 424 days and enjoining him from exercising that authority); L.M.-M., v. Cuccinelli, \n24  442 F.Supp.3d 1, 29, 34 (D.D.C. 2020) (holding that Acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \n25  Services (“USCIS”) Director Cuccinelli “was designated to serve as the acting Director of USCIS \n26  in violation of the FVRA” and “because Cuccinelli was exercising the authority of the USCIS \n27  Director in violation of the FVRA, the directives were not issued ‘in accordance with law,’ and \n28  must, accordingly, be set aside under the APA”). \n- 42 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 43 of 66\n \n \n1  253.  These FVRA and HSA lawsuits generally ask courts to set aside and/or enjoin \n2  actions by officials acting unlawfully in federal agency roles, because those actions are “without \n3  force and effect,” 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(1), “may not be ratified,” id. § 3348(d)(2), and were therefore \n4  promulgated “in excess of statutory authority” and not “in accordance with law,” id. §§ 706(2)(C), \n5  (2)(A).  \n6  254.  In addition to court review of agency action, the U.S. Government Accountability \n7  Office (“GAO”) likewise found Mr. Wolf to be acting ultra vires. Congress has delegated the GAO \n8  to play a core role in FVRA compliance: namely, per the FVRA, the GAO must collect information \n9  about vacancies, and if the GAO “makes a determination that an officer is serving longer than the \n10  210-day period including the applicable exceptions to such period under section 3346 or section \n11  3349a,  the  Comptroller  General  shall  report  such  determination  immediately”  to  various \n12  authorities, including Congress. 5 U.S.C. § 3349. \n13  255.  On August 14, 2020, the GAO issued a report under its FVRA duties and authority, \n14  entitled  “Department  of  Homeland  Security—Legality  of  Service  of  Acting  Secretary  of \n15  Homeland Security and Service of Senior Official Performing the Duties of Deputy Secretary of \n16  Homeland Security.” In sum, the report finds that Acting Secretaries “Wolf and [Ken] Cuccinelli \n17  were named to their respective positions of Acting Secretary and Senior Official Performing the \n18  Duties of Deputy Secretary by reference to an invalid order of succession” and that “[b]ecause Mr. \n19  Wolf draws his authority to serve as Acting Secretary from [an invalid] Delegation, Mr. Wolf \n20  cannot, therefore, rely upon it to serve as the Acting Secretary.”  \n21  256.  The GAO report also analyzed whether Mr. Wolf could be lawfully serving under \n22  the succession provisions of the HSA and found that he could not.  \n23  257.  Mr. Wolf has twice attempted to ratify his ultra vires actions as Acting DHS \n24  Secretary. Neither attempt has cured his unlawful exercise of authority.  \n25  258.  First,  while  Mr.  Wolf  was  purportedly  Acting  DHS  Secretary,  then-FEMA \n26  Administrator Peter Gaynor also used “any authority vested in [him] as Acting Secretary of \n27  Homeland Security” to revise and/or ratify the actions by Mr. McAleenan to replace the original \n28  DHS Orders with the new Orders overriding E.O. 13,753 with new Annex A (emphasis added). \n- 43 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 44 of 66\n \n \n1  259.  One federal district court characterized the “two acting secretaries” maneuver as \n2  the government’s attempt to “allow a government official to take administrative action in the \n3  alternative,” further holding that “DHS cannot recognize [Mr. Gaynor’s] authority only for the \n4  sham purpose of abdicating his authority to DHS’s preferred choice, and only in the alternative.” \n5  Batalla, 2020 WL 6695076 at *9.  \n6  260.  Later, Defendants abandoned the “two acting secretaries” theory and agreed that \n7  FEMA Administrator Gaynor was “never” Acting DHS Secretary. Pangea Legal Services, 2021 \n8  WL 75756, at *5. \n9  261.  In addition to the “two acting secretaries” theory, DHS also attempted another form \n10  of ratification that is of no legal consequence. In the past two weeks, Mr. Wolf has seen his \n11  September 10, 2020 nomination for DHS Secretary withdrawn (January 7); resigned from the role \n12  of Acting Secretary (January 11); returned to his prior position as Under Secretary for Strategy, \n13  Policy, and Plans (January 11); allegedly been delegated the authority to ratify his own past actions \n14  by the new Acting Secretary, FEMA Administrator Gaynor (January 12); and used this new \n15  purported delegated authority to ratify “any and all prior regulatory actions involving delegable \n16  duties that [he had] taken from November 13, 2019 through January 11, 2021” (Chad F. Wolf, \n17  Signed Ratification of Delegable Prior Action as AS 01.13.21, U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security) \n18  (January 14).  \n19  262.  Courts do not have to accept at face value agencies’ blanket ratifications of past \n20  actions. Instead, they examine whether “a properly appointed official has the power to conduct an \n21  independent evaluation [of the past actions] of the merits and does so,” Wilkes-Barre Hospital \n22  Company, LLC v. N.L.R.B., 857 F.3d 364, 371 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (citation omitted), and whether the \n23  ratifier was exercising “independent judgment” in doing so, Jooce v. Food & Drug Admin., 2020 \n24  WL 680143, at *5 (D.D.C. Feb. 11, 2020), aff'd, 981 F.3d 26 (D.C. Cir. 2020). \n25  263.  It is unlikely, given the recitation of events above, that any properly appointed \n26  official conducted an independent evaluation of past actions, or that any official who conducted \n27  such an evaluation exercised independent judgment.  \n28 \n- 44 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 45 of 66\n \n \n1  264.  On information and belief, Mr. Wolf promulgated and/or implemented all, some, \n2  or part of the Policy challenged in this lawsuit, and any aspects of the Policy promulgated and/or \n3  implemented under his authority must be set aside and/or enjoined.  \n4  265.  On  information  and  belief,  as  of  this  filing,  no  lawfully  acting  Secretary  of \n5  Homeland Security has taken the necessary steps that could possibly serve to properly ratify the \n6  Policy. \n7  Related Practice of Unlawfully Commandeering Portland’s Law Enforcement Officers \n8 \n266.  In addition and related to the Policy, Defendants continue to engage in a related \n9 \nPractice that also asserts authority not delegated to them under the Constitution or under other \n10 \nlegal authority. \n11 \n267.  On or about September 21, 2020, the City of Portland, Oregon State Police, and \n12 \nseveral federal law enforcement agencies, including the USMS, began logistics planning for an \n13 \nanticipated rally of the Proud Boys in Portland on Saturday, September 26, 2020. \n14 \n268.  The Proud Boys are an extremist pro-White hate group. Members of the Proud \n15 \nBoys, which appeared at the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, “regularly \n16 \nspout white nationalist memes and maintain affiliations with known extremists” and “are known \n17 \nfor anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric.” \n18 \n269.  In anticipation of the Proud Boys rally, on September 25, 2020, Governor Brown \n19 \ndeclared a state of emergency and issued an executive order for the purpose of implementing a \n20 \ncoordinated law enforcement response. As part of the order, Governor Brown temporarily assumed \n21 \ncontrol of local law enforcement, including PPB, the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office, the \n22 \nGresham Police Department, and the Port of Portland Police. \n23 \n270.  Governor Brown appointed Multnomah County Sheriff Michael Reese and Oregon \n24 \nState  Police  Superintendent  Travis  Hampton  to  serve  as  incident  commanders  in  the  law \n25 \nenforcement coordination area, and they therefore assumed control of PPB, Multnomah County \n26 \nSheriff’s Office, Gresham Police Department, and Port of Portland Police.  \n27 \n271.  The Governor’s executive order, by its own terms, became effective at 12:01 A.M. \n28 \nPacific Time on Saturday, September 26, 2020, and expired at 12:01 AM Pacific Time on Monday, \n- 45 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 46 of 66\n \n \n1  September 28, 2020. Governor Brown’s executive order and state of emergency were then \n2  terminated at 6:00 AM on September 27, 2020. \n3  272.  Pursuant to a direction given by Superintendent Hampton, on September 25, 2020, \n4  PPB Chief Charles Lovell authorized fifty-six officers, sergeants, and lieutenants from PPB’s \n5  Rapid Response Team, which typically handles protests, to be deputized as federal agents for the \n6  purposes of tactical response to the anticipated rally and disturbance of the peace caused by the \n7  Proud Boys. \n8  273.  Because of the Governor’s executive order and over the course of dealing with \n9  Oregon State Police, PPB anticipated that the deputation would be limited to the weekend \n10  surrounding the Proud Boys hate-related event or so long as the state of emergency remained in \n11  effect. \n12  274.  After the expiration of the state executive order, the federal deputation was in fact \n13  no longer needed. \n14  275.  Deputations must be voluntary and consensual. \n15  276.  On September 29, 2020, Portland City Attorney Tracy Reeve wrote to the U.S. \n16  Attorney’s Office in Portland to clearly and expressly communicate the City’s withdrawal of \n17  consent to the federal deputation of the fifty-six PPB officers.  \n18  277.  City Attorney Reeve explained that the Governor’s executive order had terminated, \n19  and PPB “was back under the control and direction of the City of Portland, and specifically Police \n20  Commissioner and Mayor Ted Wheeler and the Portland City Council.” Because the executive \n21  order terminated, “[t]he City of Portland [did] not consent to the continuing federal deputization \n22  of PPB officers and hereby formally withdr[e]w[] its consent  to this deputization effective \n23  immediately.” \n24  278.  As of September 29, 2020, the deputation stopped being voluntary and consensual \n25  because Portland withdrew its consent; therefore, the deputations were of no further legal effect \n26  on and after that date. \n27  279.  Neither the U.S. Attorney’s Office nor any other federal agency, including the \n28  USMS, responded to City Attorney Reeve’s communication. \n- 46 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 47 of 66\n \n \n1  280.  Instead, on September 30, 2020, U.S. Attorney Williams and United States Marshal \n2  for the District of Oregon Russ Burger issued a press release regarding the deputation of the PPB \n3  officers. \n4  281.  The release stated that the “U.S. Marshal will not cancel the cross-deputation of \n5  local and state law enforcement officers.” In defense of their decision to commandeer Portland’s \n6  police force, U.S. Attorney Williams and United States Marshal for the District of Oregon Burger \n7  stated that continued deputation would provide “accountability and deterrence” for “criminal acts” \n8  and would support “front line law enforcement officers and their families in a way that they have \n9  not seen from City Hall.”   \n10  282.  Despite Defendant agencies’ purported desire to hold individuals accountable for \n11  and deter criminal acts, it is the responsibility of PPB and other local law enforcement to generally \n12  address criminal activity in Portland. It is the responsibility of the State of Oregon and City of \n13  Portland to enact laws and enforce laws that strike the proper balance between deterring criminal \n14  activity and supporting First Amendment expression. And it is the responsibility of Portland, as \n15  the employer of PPB officers, to support and protect local law enforcement. \n16  283.  On October 2, 2020, Mayor Wheeler, as Police Commissioner, directed PPB \n17  officers to take no further action of any kind pursuant to the federal deputation, including the \n18  enforcement of any federal law. \n19  284.  On December 31, 2020, the deputations from September 26, 2020 expired by their \n20  terms. However, Portland continues to voluntarily deputize PPB officers as U.S. Marshals, and \n21  with other federal agencies, to advance important law enforcement goals. \n22  285.  Nonetheless, because the federal government has previously refused to recognize \n23  Portland’s withdrawal of consent to deputation, Portland remains concerned about current and \n24  future deputation of PPB officers and Portland’s ability to terminate such relationships and ensure \n25  that PPB officers are acting consistent with their obligations to Portland.  \n26  286.  The practice of refusing to terminate the deputation of Portland’s officers limits the \n27  City’s law enforcement discretion, creates potential conflict between Defendants and Portland over \n28 \n- 47 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 48 of 66\n \n \n1  the use and tactics of Portland’s own officers and other law enforcement personnel, and unlawfully \n2  usurps the legislative and governance prerogative of local officials. \n3  287.  The  Practice  of  continued,  non-consensual  deputation  of  Portland’s  law \n4  enforcement officers unconstitutionally infringes on Portland’s authority to end the deputation and \n5  unconstitutionally compels local officers to continue to serve as federal law enforcement officials, \n6  whether in name or in scope of authority.    \n7  Harm to Plaintiffs  \n8    Economic Injury \n9  288.  Plaintiffs have already suffered economic harms and will continue to suffer such \n10  harms under the Policy and Practice. \n11    Portland’s Economic Harms \n12  289.  At the time of the federal government’s deployment into Portland, protests in the \n13  City were growing more peaceful and were more easily managed on a day-to-day basis by PPB. \n14  290.  As a direct result of the unlawful intervention by Defendants, Portland experienced \n15  a significant increase in violent protests and civil disturbance. Dr. Robert Pape and his team of \n16  researchers at the University of Chicago examined 122 protest events in Portland between May \n17  28, 2020, and August 6, 2020, and found that violence behavior increased and peaceful protests \n18  decreased during the 25 days when federal agents were present.   \n19  291.  Following the removal of federal agents from the streets of Portland, PPB was \n20  required to expend additional resources on crowd management and maintaining peace.  \n21  292.  As a direct result of the unlawful intervention of Defendants, PPB was required to \n22  spend additional money on overtime for patrol officers and other resources in response to the \n23  heightened tensions within Portland.   \n24  293.  Since July 2020 and continuing to the present, Portland’s elected leadership and \n25  other city officials have spent hundreds of hours in meetings, discussions, and other planning \n26  efforts to respond to the presence of federal agents and to plan for possible additional federal \n27  intervention under the Policy. \n28 \n- 48 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 49 of 66\n \n \n1  294.  In January 2021, Portland’s elected leadership and other city officials have spent \n2  hours in discussions and other planning efforts to prepare for potential violent protests by pro-\n3  Trump supporters. \n4    Oakland’s Economic Harms \n5  295.  Although Plaintiff City of Oakland has not yet been subject to direct federal \n6  intervention under the Policy, it has nonetheless already suffered and will continue to suffer \n7  economic harms. \n8  296.  In response to the Policy, Oakland has also engaged in new outreach through the \n9  departments that are members of its Emergency Operations Center, activities that would not have \n10  been necessary and resources that would not have been required but for the Policy.  \n11  297.  Oakland’s elected leadership has devoted time since  July 2020 preparing for \n12  possible federal intervention under the Policy. Due to the uncertainty caused by the Policy, city \n13  officials had to return to such preparations after January 6, 2021. \n14  298.  Oakland’s economic harms will significantly increase if the City becomes a target \n15  of deployment under the Policy, for many reasons. One such reason is the City’s “mutual aid” \n16  agreements, as described above. The City’s mutual aid agreements with other governments have \n17  never contemplated coming to the assistance of a sister government in the event of unprecedented \n18  federal intervention, such as the interventions that have occurred and may occur under the Policy. \n19  299.  Oakland has had mutual aid requests rejected when the aid sought does not comport \n20  with the agreements or conflicts with their partners’ policies.  \n21  300.  Oakland will suffer significant economic harm if it cannot rely on mutual aid. In \n22  the limited instances in which mutual aid has been unavailable, for instance, the Oakland Police \n23  Department has been forced to cancel days off, pay substantial additional overtime, and divert \n24  officers from their assigned duties. \n25  301.  Defendants did not take either Portland or Oakland’s economic harms into account \n26  in enacting the Policy. \n27   \n28   \n- 49 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 50 of 66\n \n \n1    Budgetary and Other Uncertainty; Impairment of Ability to Provide Services \n2  302.  Plaintiffs depend on the clear delineation of and communication about federal, \n3  state, and local police authority to safely govern and police their communities.  \n4  303.  Plaintiffs must know or reasonably expect when federal law enforcement agents \n5  will be or could be deployed in their cities, both as a constitutional and safety matter.  \n6  304.  Plaintiffs have historically worked closely with Defendants’ local representatives \n7  to ensure the safety of the federal property Defendants have authority to protect. \n8  305.  Even when the federal government has, in the past, intervened involuntarily in \n9  cities, counties, or states, it has done so using lawful processes, such as by filing enforcement \n10  actions in court or, in extreme and rare circumstances, formally invoking powers such as the \n11  Insurrection Act and following such statutes’ requirements for a declaration. The Act is not \n12  invoked secretly or ambiguously. 10 U.S.C. § 254. \n13  306.  The current Policy represents an entirely new process by which cities may find \n14  federal law enforcement in the midst of civil protests, throughout their jurisdictions, and surveilling \n15  their residents well beyond federal crimes or properties. \n16  307.  Plaintiffs’ uncertainty about whether, when, and with what parameters federal \n17  agents may be deployed to their cities under the Policy prevents them from appropriately advising \n18  their police departments and fire departments, among others, and from fully planning their budgets.  \n19  308.  Further, Plaintiffs’ police departments, among other departments, have a strong and \n20  abiding interest in the community relationships they have formed, often over many years, with \n21  advocates, faith leaders, youth groups, and others in their jurisdictions. These relationships are \n22  crucial to addressing racial justice issues, de-escalating and interrupting violence, and engaging in \n23  successful long-term reform efforts. These relationships are also premised on Plaintiffs’ police \n24  departments being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements, both formal and informal, with their \n25  community partners. Uncertainty regarding whether, when, and why federal law enforcement \n26  authorities,  who  lack  any  knowledge  of  these  crucial  agreements  and  understandings,  may \n27  intervene in Plaintiffs’ streets, harms Plaintiffs’ capacity to honor their commitments to their \n28  residents and reduce violence in their communities. \n- 50 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 51 of 66\n \n \n1  309.  Finally, because the full scope of the Policy is vague and unknown, Plaintiffs’ city \n2  officials have no certainty about whether any particular decision they might make will lead to \n3  federal intervention under the Policy. \n4  310.  Recent events also made clear that this harm is ongoing. Defendants’ intervention \n5  to quell Black Lives Matter protests in Portland as well as their deployment to other Democrat-run \n6  cities during the summer of 2020 contrast sharply with the preparation for and response to the \n7  January 6, 2021 pro-Trump siege on the U.S. Capitol. The wide variation in response cannot be \n8  explained  by  difference  in  threat  levels  to  federal  property.  Accordingly,  the  pretextual \n9  explanations  for the Policy have created confusion and sowed doubt about  when and how \n10  Defendants will respond to protests, unrest, or violence in Plaintiff cities. \n11  311.  Plaintiffs continue to respond to Black Lives Matter protests, as well as protests by \n12  groups on both the left and the right, without the ability to anticipate or predict how Defendants \n13  will respond under the Policy. This uncertainty makes responding to and policing these protests \n14  more challenging and costly.  \n15  312.  Together, these injuries perceptibly impair Plaintiffs’ ability to provide the services \n16  they were formed to provide and frustrate Plaintiffs’ goals and values. \n17  313.  Under the Policy, federal enforcement actions are likely to violate or contravene \n18  Plaintiffs’ otherwise lawful policies and values.  \n19    Activity Considered Impermissible by Local Policy Permitted Under the Policy  \n20  314.  Plaintiffs have specific policies, practices, and procedures for activities such as the \n21  use of force or use of surveillance by law enforcement authorities. \n22  315.  The City of Portland has a use of force policy, Directive 1010.00, and a crowd \n23  control policy, Directive 0635.10. These policies govern a number of PPB policies, practices, and \n24  procedures  in  responding  to  demonstrations,  including  PPB’s  use  of impact  munitions  and \n25  chemical agents. The use of chemical agents has been further restricted by order of Portland’s \n26  Police Commissioner, consistent with the City’s values on policing.  \n27  316.  The City of Oakland has a use of force policy, DGO K-3, and a crowd control \n28  policy, Training Bulletin III-G. Those documents govern a number of Oakland Police Department \n- 51 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 52 of 66\n \n \n1  policies, practices, and procedures, including its use of nonlethal impact weapons and chemical \n2  agents, as well as video and photographic recording of protesters engaged in protected First \n3  Amendment activity.  \n4  317.  These policies and trainings are intended to govern Plaintiffs’ police departments’ \n5  interactions  with  their  communities.  Based  on  those  policies  and  trainings,  in  Plaintiffs’ \n6  communities,  residents  have expectations  for  their  interactions  with  local  law  enforcement.  \n7  Federal law enforcement officers have not been trained in municipal community policing, critical \n8  civilian crowd management, and/or de-escalation techniques. The unconstrained actions of federal \n9  forces undermine the work of local law enforcement, including ongoing violence prevention \n10  programs and community engagement.  \n11  318.  Under the Policy, Plaintiff City of Portland has been unable to adhere to its local \n12  policies favoring de-escalation of potentially volatile situations because Defendants’ actions under \n13  the Policy have inflamed local passions, encouraged violence, and generated the need for PPB \n14  response where it otherwise would not have been needed. \n15    Frustration of Federal Court Orders; Separation of Powers \n16  319.  Plaintiffs are each, separately, under federal court orders that govern the activities \n17  of their police departments in various ways.  \n18  320.  Plaintiff City of Portland’s police department operates in part under a Negotiated \n19  Settlement Agreement in United States v. City of Portland, Case No. 3:12-cv-02265-SI (D. Or. \n20  2012), as well as recent injunctions in Don’t Shoot Portland v. City of Portland, Case No. 3:20-\n21  cv-00917-HZ (D. Or. 2020) and Index Newspapers LLC v. City of Portland, Case No. 3:20-cv-\n22  01035-SI (D. Or. 2020). \n23  321.  Plaintiff  City  of  Oakland’s  police  department  operates  under  a  longstanding \n24  Negotiated Settlement Agreement in Delphine Allen. v. City of Oakland, Master Case File No. \n25  C00-4599-TEH (N.D. Cal. 2012), as well as under a recent injunction in Anti Police-Terror Project \n26  v. City of Oakland, Case No. 20-cv-03866-JCS (N.D. Cal. 2020). \n27 \n28 \n- 52 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 53 of 66\n \n \n1  322.  Collectively,  these  various  court  orders  bind  Plaintiffs’  police  departments’ \n2  activities, including governing many of their policies, practices, and procedures, and limiting their \n3  use of various forms of force.  \n4  323.  Under the Policy, as carried out in, at a minimum, Portland, Defendants used arrest \n5  techniques, force, and surveillance that would facially violate Plaintiffs’ federal court orders. \n6  324.  Plaintiff City of Oakland would face the same bind if any deployments are sent to \n7  Oakland under the Policy.   \n8    Loss of Use and Enjoyment of Public Facilities \n9  325.  Portland has provided bike and vehicle lanes in its right-of-way on Main Street and \n10  Southwest 3rd Avenue. \n11  326.  FPS’s fence and barriers, erected without permission, prevent the use of enjoyment \n12  of this public land by Portland and its residents. See Gingery v. City of Glendale, 831 F.3d 1222, \n13  1227 (9th Cir. 2016).  \n14    Loss of Legislative Prerogative \n15  327.  Plaintiff City of Portland shares in Oregon’s sovereign general police power to \n16  provide for the health and safety of its residents. \n17  328.  The federal government’s commandeering of Portland law enforcement, complete \n18  once Defendant DOJ and then-Attorney General Barr refused to cancel the deputation of the PPB \n19  officers,  pressed  these  officers  into  service  in  disregard  of  the  City’s  own  legislative  and \n20  enforcement priorities.  \n21     \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n- 53 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 54 of 66\n \n \n1  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n2  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n3  (Administrative Procedure Act—Action Not in Accordance with the Law)  \n4  (Against All Defendants) \n5  (5 U.S.C. § 706) \n6  329.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \n7  paragraphs of this First Amended Complaint.  \n8  330.  Under the APA, courts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is not \n9  in accordance with law, in excess of statutory authority, contrary to constitutional right, or without \n10  observance of procedure required by law. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n11  331.  Defendants may only exercise authority conferred by statute. City of Arlington v. \n12  FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 297-98 (2013).  \n13  332.  Defendants’ Policy is “final agency action” under the APA because it is fairly \n14  characterized as Defendants’ final word on the matter and has legal consequences for Plaintiffs’ \n15  resident protesters during civil protests, as well as, independently, for Plaintiffs facing economic \n16  harms and federal encroachment on police powers and the “take over” of their jurisdictions. See \n17  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., Inc., 136 S. Ct. 1807, 1813 (2016) (quoting Bennett \n18  v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997)); see also New York v. U.S. Immigration & Customs \n19  Enforcement, 431 F. Supp. 3d 377, 386-88 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). \n20  333.  Agency action need not be in writing, or ever known to the public, to be judicially \n21  reviewable as “final” action. See Aracely, R. v. Nielsen, 319 F. Supp. 3d 110, 138-39 (D.D.C. \n22  2018); Wagafe v. Trump, 2017 WL 2671254, at *1, *10 (W.D. Wash. 2017); Venetian Casino \n23  Resort, LLC v. EEOC, 530 F.3d 925, 931 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (concluding that “the record” as a whole \n24  “leaves no doubt” that a policy exists, even though “the details ... are still unclear”).  \n25  334.  Furthermore, each instance where Defendants, through their officers, employees, \n26  and  agents,  directly  or  constructively,  unlawfully  deployed  or  commanded  federal  law \n27  enforcement to act in excess of or contrary to law constitutes “final agency action” under the APA. \n28 \n- 54 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 55 of 66\n \n \n1  335.  40 U.S.C. § 1315(b)(1) allows the Secretary of DHS to designate certain federal \n2  employees “as officers and agents for duty in connection with the protection of property owned or \n3  occupied by the Federal Government and persons on the property, including duty in areas outside \n4  the property to the extent necessary to protect the property and persons on the property.” These \n5  authorized duties include enforcing federal laws, making arrests if federal crimes are committed \n6  in the presence of an officer, and conducting investigations on and off the property for crimes \n7  against the property or persons on the property.  \n8  336.  40 U.S.C. § 1315(d)(3) further allows the Secretary to “utilize the facilities and \n9  services of Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies, with the consent of the agencies.” \n10  337.  40 U.S.C. § 1315(e) also allows the Secretary to “enter into agreements with \n11  Federal agencies and with State and local governments to obtain authority for officers and agents \n12  designated under this section to enforce Federal laws and State and local laws concurrently with \n13  other Federal law enforcement officers and with State and local law enforcement officers” “[]for \n14  the protection of property owned or occupied by the Federal Government and persons on the \n15  property.”  \n16  338.  These statutory provisions do not authorize the designation of employees for \n17  general law enforcement purposes in United States cities where the intent, mission, and purpose \n18  of the designation is not reasonably connected to such federally stated interests. Significantly, 40 \n19  U.S.C. § 1315 does not represent Congressional authorization to suppress insurrections under the \n20  Militia Clause.  See U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 15. \n21  339.  Further,  these  statutory  provisions  do  not  authorize  the  expansion  of  federal \n22  property into City- or State-owned rights-of-way, or the takeover of City property for federal \n23  purposes, without the consent of the non-federal agencies, as Defendants assert.  \n24  340.  The Policy therefore oversteps the constitutional limitations on the federal police \n25  powers, including as enumerated in the Militia Clause, the Republican Form of Government \n26  Clause, and the Tenth Amendment, and is not in accordance with and exceeds Defendants’ \n27  authority under 40 U.S.C. § 1315 because it (a) authorizes the designation of such agents to quell \n28  civil protests and surveil and engage with threats to damage or destroy any public monument, \n- 55 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 56 of 66\n \n \n1  memorial, or statue, regardless of whether they are owned or leased by the GSA or on land owned \n2  or leased by the GSA, and to engage in activity under the pretext of protecting such objects for the \n3  purposes  of  viewpoint  discrimination  and  (b)  authorizes  the  expansion  of  federal  physical \n4  boundaries and the take-over of City rights-of-way for the purposes of securing federal property, \n5  without the express consent of the City.  \n6  341.  Internal memoranda, internal email communications, internal policies, various \n7  public statements, and activities or failures to act in cities such as Portland and Washington, D.C. \n8  reveal a distinct and meaningful policy shift to use federal law enforcement to unilaterally step in \n9  or replace local law enforcement departments that do not subscribe to President Trump’s view of \n10  domestic “law and order” and to quell viewpoints, speech, or protests with which President Trump \n11  disagrees. These interventions were intended to pressure local officials and police departments to \n12  react more aggressively to stop or thwart racial justice protests.  \n13  342.  The animating intent of the Policy was to use property protection as the pretextual \n14  justification for viewpoint discrimination.  \n15  343.  The Policy was implemented to suppress protests or other activities in progressive, \n16  Democratic-controlled cities where protestors expressed support for Black Lives Matter or other \n17  racial justice actions, causes that President Trump and his administration did not support, under \n18  the pretext of protecting federal property. The Policy was implemented either through direct \n19  intervention in, and deployment of federal law enforcement to, cities, such as Defendants did in \n20  Portland in July 2020, or via threats to do so in order to pressure state and local law enforcement \n21  to shut down or severely limit the extent of such protests as quickly as possible, including through \n22  the use of racially discriminatory tactics and excessive use of force. \n23  344.  Pursuant to the Policy, Defendants improperly designated and deployed “officers \n24  and agents” to Portland, which constitutes a final agency action subject to review under the APA. \n25  As a result, all of the DHS personnel purporting to be designated FPS agents under 40 U.S.C. § \n26  1315 were unlawfully deployed and unable to exercise any authority under the statute whatsoever. \n27  345.  Only the Secretary of DHS or someone exercising his lawfully delegated authority \n28  may delegate DHS employees to guard federal property. 40 U.S.C. § 1315(b)(1); 6 U.S.C. § \n- 56 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 57 of 66\n \n \n1  112(b)(1) (“[t]he Secretary . . . may delegate any of the Secretary’s functions to any officer, \n2  employee, or organizational unit of the Department”). According to the OIG Report, the Acting \n3  Secretary  delegated  the  authority  to  designate  FPS  officers  to  the  Under  Secretary  for \n4  Management, who in turn further delegated this authority to the FPS Director. That second \n5  delegation to the FPS Director was not authorized by law and not properly delegated. \n6  346.  The FPS Director did not properly designate any DHS employees to be deployed \n7  to Portland. Designation requires specifically identifying employees for deployment. 40 U.S.C. § \n8  1315(b)(1). The FPS Director did not designate any specific employees for deployment, but rather \n9  circulated broadly worded designation memoranda to leadership in various DHS components. The \n10  memoranda reference an attached distribution list of personnel to be deployed, but at the time they \n11  were distributed, there were no such lists attached. As a result, Defendants’ deployment of federal \n12  agents to Portland supposedly pursuant to 40 U.S.C. § 1315 was unlawful. \n13  347.  Defendants’ unlawful actions have caused, are causing, and will continue to cause \n14  harm to Plaintiffs as alleged above, and there is a substantial likelihood that the requested relief \n15  will redress this harm. \n16  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n17  (Administrative Procedure Act—Arbitrary and Capricious) \n18  (Against All Defendants) \n19  (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)) \n20  348.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \n21  paragraphs of this First Amended Complaint.  \n22  349.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) provides that a court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency \n23  action found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \n24  law. \n25  350.  Long-established principles of federalism, paired with congressional limitations, \n26  restrict the ability of the federal government to unilaterally deploy domestic military or police \n27  interventions.  \n28 \n- 57 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 58 of 66\n \n \n1  351.  Defendants have adopted a Policy to circumvent these limitations and deploy \n2  federal  agents  using  property  protection  as  the  pretextual  justification  for  viewpoint \n3  discrimination.  \n4  352.  The Policy was implemented to suppress protests or other activities in progressive, \n5  Democratic-controlled cities where protestors expressed support for Black Lives Matter or other \n6  racial justice actions, causes that President Trump and his administration did not support, under \n7  the pretext of protecting federal property. \n8  353.  The contours of the Policy are not reasonably connected to the facially neutral \n9  standards  of 40  U.S.C. § 1315. As  detailed above, there is no consistently and reasonably \n10  discernable connection between threats to federal property and Defendants’ responses to those \n11  threats.     \n12  354.  Accordingly, Defendants’ purported justification for the Policy is pretextual and, \n13  thus, arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. \n14  355.  In enacting the Policy, Defendants have also acted arbitrarily and capriciously \n15  because Defendants did not fully consider the foreseeable harms of their policy and did not \n16  adequately explain the decision-making rationale behind the policy change, beyond a pretextual \n17  rationale.  \n18  356.  In implementing the Policy, Defendants failed to consider, among many things, \n19  the direct and destructive impacts on local governments in their administration of general public \n20  safety, and the aforementioned harms that have and will flow to Plaintiffs.   \n21  357.  Defendants’ unlawful action has caused, is causing, and will continue to cause \n22  harm to Plaintiffs as alleged above, and there is a substantial likelihood that the requested relief \n23  will redress this harm. \n24     \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n- 58 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 59 of 66\n \n \n1  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2  (Federal Vacancies Reform Act; Homeland Security Act) \n3  (Against Defendants Pekoske and DHS) \n4  (5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq.; 6 U.S.C. § 113) \n5  358.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \n6  paragraphs of this First Amended Complaint.  \n7  359.  The Secretary of Homeland Security may be appointed by the President only with \n8  the advice and consent of the Senate, 6 U.S.C. § 112(a)(1), and when the Office of the Secretary \n9  is vacant, the order of succession is governed by the FVRA and/or the HSA. \n10  360.  Under those authorities, Mr. Wolf was not legally authorized to hold the position \n11  of Acting Secretary. \n12  361.  Under those authorities, Mr. Wolf was not legally authorized to perform the duties \n13  and functions of the Secretary of Homeland Security. \n14  362.  Because Mr. Wolf was without legal authority to hold his position or to perform its \n15  duties or functions, any contributions he made to the Policy or steps he took or is taking to enact \n16  or enforce the Policy, or later to ratify the Policy, “shall have no force or effect,” 5 U.S.C. \n17  § 3348(d)(1), “may not be ratified,” id. § 3348(d)(2), and must be set aside. \n18  363.  Because no lawfully acting Secretary of Homeland Security has taken the necessary \n19  steps to properly ratify the Policy, its legal status remains unchanged. \n20  FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n21  (Administrative Procedure Act—In Excess of Authority) \n22  (Against Defendants Pekoske and DHS) \n23  (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)) \n24  364.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \n25  paragraphs of this First Amended Complaint.  \n26  365.  Because Mr. Wolf was not legally authorized to hold the position of Acting \n27  Secretary, any action he took to contribute to, direct, revise, promulgate, enact, or enforce the \n28 \n- 59 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 60 of 66\n \n \n1  Policy, or later to ratify the Policy, is “in excess of authority” under the APA and therefore must \n2  be held to be unlawful and set aside. \n3  366.  Because no lawfully acting Secretary of Homeland Security has taken the necessary \n4  steps to properly ratify the Policy, its legal status remains unchanged. \n5  FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n6  (Administrative Procedure Act—Not in Accordance with Law) \n7  (Against Defendants Pekoske and DHS) \n8  (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)) \n9  367.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \n10  paragraphs of this First Amended Complaint.  \n11  368.  Because Mr. Wolf was not legally authorized to hold the position of Acting \n12  Secretary, any action he took to contribute to, direct, revise, promulgate, enact, or enforce the \n13  Policy, or later to ratify the Policy, is “not in accordance with law” under the APA and therefore \n14  must be held to be unlawful and set aside. \n15 \n369.  Because no lawfully acting Secretary of Homeland Security has taken the necessary \n16 \nsteps to properly ratify the Policy, its legal status remains unchanged. \n17 \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n18 \n(Anti-Commandeering) \n19 \n(Plaintiff City of Portland Against Defendants Wilkinson and DOJ) \n20 \n(U.S. Const., amend. X) \n21 \n370.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \n22 \nparagraphs of this First Amended Complaint. \n23 \n371.  The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution preserves the states’ \n24 \nhistoric,  sovereign,  and  fundamental  autonomy  to  regulate their  own  affairs,  including  and \n25 \nespecially the operations of their state and local governments.   \n26 \n372.  General police powers are among those reserved to the States. “A state’s ability to \n27 \nregulate its internal law enforcement activities is a quintessential police power.”  United States v. \n28 \n- 60 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 61 of 66\n \n \n1  California, 921 F.3d 865, 887 n.11 (9th Cir. 2019), cert. denied, 2020 WL 3146844 (June 15, \n2  2020). \n3  373.  States are permitted to delegate their police powers to their municipalities. “[T]he \n4  delegated power of municipalities is as broad as the police power of the state, except as that power \n5  may be restricted by terms of the grant or by the state constitution.” D.C. v. John R. Thompson \n6  Co., 346 U.S. 100, 109 (1953). \n7  374.  Oregon has so delegated its police power to its municipalities, which include the \n8  City of Portland. Article XI, section 2 of the Oregon Constitution grants the “legal voters of every \n9  city and town . . . power to enact and amend their municipal charter, subject to the Constitution \n10  and criminal laws of the State of Oregon.” Portland’s charter identifies its power and authority to \n11  exercise within the City and City-owned property “all the powers commonly known as the police \n12  power to the same extent as the State of Oregon has or could exercise said power within said areas, \n13  and to make and enforce within said areas all necessary or appropriate . . . police . . . and safety \n14  laws and regulations.”  Portland City Charter § 2-105. \n15  375.  The USMS’s refusal to honor the cancellation of the deputation of PPB’s officers, \n16  by  and  through  then-Attorney  General  Barr  and  DOJ,  commandeered  a  key  Portland  law \n17  enforcement agency and unduly interferes with Portland’s police functions as delegated to it by \n18  the State of Oregon, in violation of the Tenth Amendment. This Practice unconstitutionally \n19  infringed on Portland’s authority to determine the status and deputation of PPB’s officers, and \n20  unconstitutionally compelled PPB’s officers to continue to serve under the force and guise of \n21  federal law.  \n22  376.  Defendants DOJ and Wilkinson have violated the authority of Portland to control \n23  and direct its own police officers and, in doing so, caused confusion regarding the role and \n24  authority of deputized PPB officers and any legal obligations of these officers to execute orders \n25  issued under the authority of the United States. \n26  377.  Portland continues to work with the federal government to deputize PPB officers.  \n27  There is ongoing uncertainty about Portland’s ability to terminate such relationships, if desired, \n28  going forward and ensure that PPB officers are acting consistent with their obligations to Portland \n- 61 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 62 of 66\n \n \n1  378.   The violation caused by Defendants DOJ and Wilkinson causes ongoing harm to \n2  Portland and its residents. \n3  SEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n4  (Declaratory Judgment Act) \n5  (Against All Defendants) \n6  (28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202) \n7  379.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \n8  paragraphs of this First Amended Complaint. \n9  380.  The Policy therefore oversteps the constitutional limitations on the federal police \n10  powers, including as enumerated in the Militia Clause, the Republican Form of Government \n11  Clause, and the Tenth Amendment, and is not in accordance with and exceeds Defendants’ \n12  authority under 40 U.S.C. § 1315 because it (a) authorizes the designation of such agents to quell \n13  civil protests and surveil and engage with threats to damage or destroy any public monument, \n14  memorial, or statue, regardless of whether they are owned or leased by the GSA or on land owned \n15  or leased by the GSA, and to engage in activity under the pretext of protecting such objects for the \n16  purposes  of  viewpoint  discrimination  and  (b)  authorizes  the  expansion  of  federal  physical \n17  boundaries and the take-over of City rights-of-way for the purposes of securing federal property, \n18  without the express consent of the City.  \n19  381.  Defendants’ purported justification for the Policy is wholly pretextual and, thus, \n20  arbitrary and capricious under the APA. \n21  382.  In enacting the Policy, Defendants have also acted arbitrarily and capriciously \n22  because Defendants did not fully consider the foreseeable harms of their policy and did not \n23  adequately explain the decision-making rationale behind the policy change, beyond a pretextual \n24  rationale.  \n25  383.  Because Mr. Wolf was without legal authority to hold his position or to perform its \n26  duties or functions, any contributions he made to the Policy or steps he took or is taking to enact \n27  or enforce the Policy “shall have no force or effect,” 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(1), “may not be ratified,” \n28  id. § 3348(d)(2), and must be set aside. \n- 62 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 63 of 66\n \n \n1  384.  Because Mr. Wolf was not legally authorized to hold the position of Acting \n2  Secretary, any action he took to contribute to, direct, revise, promulgate, enact, or enforce the \n3  Policy, or later to ratify the Policy, is “in excess of authority” under the APA and therefore must \n4  be held to be unlawful and set aside. \n5  385.  Because Mr. Wolf was not legally authorized to hold the position of Acting \n6  Secretary, any action he took to contribute to, direct, revise, promulgate, enact, or enforce the \n7  Policy, or later to ratify the Policy, is “not in accordance with law” under the APA and therefore \n8  must be held to be unlawful and set aside. \n9  386.  Because no lawfully acting Secretary of Homeland Security has taken the necessary \n10  steps to properly ratify the Policy, its legal status remains unchanged. \n11  387.  An  actual,  present,  and  justiciable  controversy  exists  between  Plaintiffs  and \n12  Defendants concerning the legality of the Policy and regarding whether Mr. Wolf had legal \n13  authority to hold his position or perform its duties or functions.  \n14  388.  Plaintiffs seeks a declaratory judgment from this Court that the Policy is not in \n15  accordance with law, in excess of statutory authority, contrary to constitutional right, or without \n16  observance of procedure required by law pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2); that the Policy is arbitrary, \n17  capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law within the meaning of \n18  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); that Mr. Wolf is without legal authority to hold his position or to perform \n19  its duties or functions; and that aspects of the Policy promulgated under the purported authority of \n20  Mr. Wolf must be set aside and/or enjoined. \n21  389.  Defendants DOJ and Wilkinson have unduly interfered with Portland’s police \n22  functions as delegated to it by the State of Oregon, in violation of the Tenth Amendment, by \n23  refusing to cancel the deputation of the PPB officers at Portland’s request. \n24  390.  An  actual,  present,  and  justiciable  controversy  exists  between  Portland  and \n25  Defendants DOJ and Wilkinson concerning the constitutionality of Defendants’ refusal to cancel \n26  the deputation. \n27 \n28 \n- 63 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 64 of 66\n \n \n1  391.  Portland seeks a declaratory judgment from this Court that Defendant DOJ’s and \n2  Defendant Wilkinson’s refusal to cancel the deputation of PPB officers is violative of the Tenth \n3  Amendment and the anti-commandeering doctrine. \n4   \n5  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n6    Wherefore, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \n7  1.  Issue an order holding unlawful, vacating, and setting aside Defendants’ Policy;   \n8  2.  Declare that the Policy is not in accordance with law, in excess of statutory \n9  authority, contrary to constitutional right, or without observance of procedure \n10  required by law pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2); \n11  3.  Declare that the Policy is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n12  otherwise not in accordance with law within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); \n13  4.  Declare that the cross-designation of federal agents in June and July 2020 as well \n14  as their deployment to Portland pursuant to the Policy was unlawful;  \n15  5.  Declare that aspects of the Policy promulgated under the purported authority of \n16  Mr. Wolf must be set aside and/or enjoined; \n17  6.  Declare that Defendant DOJ’s and Defendant Wilkinson’s commandeering of \n18  local law enforcement is unlawful under the Tenth Amendment and order them to \n19  immediately cancel the at-issue deputation of PPB officers; \n20  7.  Award Plaintiffs costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees; and \n21  8.  Award any other relief the Court deems just and proper.\n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n- 64 - \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-EMC   Document 42   Filed 01/21/21   Page 65 of 66\n \n \n11   DATED:  January 21, 2021      Respectfully submitted, \n22   OFFICE OF THE CITY ATTORNEY \nCITY OF OAKLAND \n33  \n \nBy: /s/ Barbara J.

WOLF, in his official capacity as   \n2266   Acting Secretary of Homeland Security; and \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF \n2277   HOMELAND SECURITY,  \n \n2288  \n  Defendants. \n   \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 2 of 48\n \n \n1  INTRODUCTION \n2  1.  This lawsuit challenges the unlawful and unconstitutional overreach of federal law \n3  enforcement in response to and in anticipation of civil protests in progressive United States cities. \n4  In particular, the lawsuit challenges the federal government’s new policy authorizing the expanded \n5  and unbounded jurisdiction of federal law enforcement under the guise of protecting federal \n6  property, and the federal government’s related and unconstitutional practice of commandeering \n7  local law enforcement officers for similar ends.   \n8  2.  Plaintiffs are the cities of Portland, Oregon, and Oakland, California—cities that, \n9  like others across the United States, have primary responsibility for the health, safety, and welfare \n10  of their residents, including the protection and oversight of general public safety during protests. \n11  Plaintiffs have police departments, fire departments, and other local governmental departments \n12  whose purposes and responsibilities are to reduce and address violence and/or support public safety \n13  in their communities. In conducting these important functions, Plaintiffs aim to respect, honor, and \n14  protect the First Amendment rights, among other rights, of their residents and visitors, so that those \n15  residents and visitors can demonstrate, march, and protest. Plaintiffs also have obligations under \n16  local and state law to respond, as necessary, to threats of violence and community harm. Outside \n17  of the exceptional actions taken by Defendants as described in this Complaint, Plaintiffs have long \n18  operated with this understanding of their duties and authority.  \n19  3.  Defendants  are  the  Department  of  Justice  (“DOJ”)  and  the  United  States \n20  Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), and the leaders of both departments. In response to \n21  directives  from  President  Donald  J.  Trump  beginning  in  or  around  June  2020,  Defendants \n22  unilaterally, unlawfully, and unconstitutionally began instituting a policy that authorized the \n23  deployment and operation of federal agents in United States cities, allegedly for the purpose of \n24  assuring domestic “law and order” and “tak[ing] over cities.” \n25  4.  The full scope and parameters of the policy authorizing these actions are currently \n26  unknown, as no ordinary public process was followed in its creation. However, for the first known \n27  time, Defendants are using 40 U.S.C. § 1315—a statute which authorizes federal agents to protect \n28  federal property and personnel—as the basis for, at a minimum: (a) deploying federal law \n- 2 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 3 of 48\n \n \n1  enforcement to quash civil protests in United States cities; (b) authorizing the engagement, \n2  surveillance, and operations of these deployments to include non-federal property and virtually \n3  limitless jurisdiction; and (c) erecting a fence around the Hatfield Federal Courthouse in Portland, \n4  without a permit or City consent, that encroaches on the City’s right-of-way (the “Policy”).  \n5  5.  Using that authority or other, unknown authorities, Defendants have also instituted \n6  an unlawful practice in Portland of commandeering control of local law enforcement officers in \n7  direct contravention of the City’s express revocation of consent, and for unknown or pretextual \n8  ends (the “Practice”). \n9  6.  Based on information and belief, the Policy is a response to, incorporates, and/or is \n10  guided  by,  the  June  26,  2020  Executive  Order  13933,  Protecting  American  Monuments, \n11  Memorials, and Statues and Combating Recent Criminal Violence (the “Executive Order”), signed \n12  by President  Trump  following nationwide protests—quite possibly the largest social justice \n13  protests in our nation’s history—over police brutality and systemic racism. The Executive Order \n14  prescribes a set of directives aimed at punishing and responding to “State and local governments” \n15  that had allegedly “lost the ability to distinguish between the lawful exercise of rights to free speech \n16  and assembly and unvarnished vandalism,” or otherwise “failed to protect public monuments, \n17  memorials, and statues.”   \n18  7.  Based  on  information  and  belief,  the  Practice  is  similarly  in  response  to, \n19  incorporates, and/or is guided by, the Executive Order. \n20  8.  Armed with this Executive Order, Defendants instituted and/or continued refining \n21  and executing the Policy, which concerns the broad deployment and operation of federal law \n22  enforcement in United States cities without the consent, request, or authorization from the states \n23  or local leaders; without using any known and non-pretextual legal authority to do so; and with the \n24  purpose  and/or  effect  of  taking  on  quintessential  general  policing  powers  granted  to  other \n25  governments.  \n26  9.  Federal law enforcement agents have, under the Policy, been deployed to United \n27  States cities, either secretly or with little warning, under at least three separate operations or \n28 \n- 3 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 4 of 48\n \n \n1  programs: Operation Legend; Operation Diligent Valor, which includes the recent deployment of \n2  agents in Portland, Oregon; and the Protecting American Communities Task Force (“PACT”).  \n3  10.  Although Defendants and/or their agents or employees have publicly claimed that \n4  certain operations are for the purpose of protecting federal property under 40 U.S.C. § 1315, \n5  internal memoranda, continuing public statements, and activities in cities such as Portland instead \n6  reveal a distinct and meaningful policy shift to use federal law enforcement to unilaterally step in \n7  or replace local law enforcement departments that do not subscribe to the President’s view of \n8  domestic “law and order.”   \n9  11.  Among other things, reported non-public memos from DHS reveal that, under the \n10  Policy and in response to the Executive Order, federal law enforcement agents are now authorized \n11  to engage in surveillance activities for threats to any public monument, memorial, or statue—\n12  which in major cities like Plaintiff jurisdictions, could constitute surveillance within the entire \n13  jurisdiction regardless of federal interests or harms at stake.  \n14  12.  In addition, DOJ and/or DHS have engaged in a variety of unauthorized activities \n15  under the Policy. Such activities in Portland have included surveilling the text messages of \n16  protesters and building a fence that blocks the right-of-way on City property and refusing to \n17  remove it upon request of City officials.  \n18  13.  Defendants, as well as President Trump, have expressed an intent to expand or at \n19  least continue the Policy. President Trump has stated: “We’re going to have more federal law \n20  enforcement. That I can tell you.”—while threatening to send federal agents into major cities “run \n21  by liberal Democrats.” For instance, he said: “We’re not going to let New York and Chicago, and \n22  Philadelphia and Detroit and Baltimore and all of these—Oakland is a mess. We’re not going to \n23  let this happen in our country.”  \n24  14.  These threats are not new. President Trump has long threatened American cities led \n25  by Democrats. But as recently as April 2020, Defendants did not purport to have, or act in \n26  accordance with, the authority they now assert under the Policy. In April, numerous public \n27  monuments, memorials, and statues were equally or more under threat from armed and uncivil \n28  protesters  who  opposed  public  health  measures  to  control  COVID-19.  But  those  protesters \n- 4 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 5 of 48\n \n \n1  expressed a different set of political views than the majority of those protesting after May 25, 2020, \n2  and no policy was then in effect to allow or require the type of federal operations now occurring \n3  or allowed to occur under the Policy. \n4  15.  The  Policy  threatens  to  upend  the  current  federalism  structure  and  working \n5  relationships between local and federal law enforcement agencies. Section 1315 has never before \n6  been interpreted to permit the actions taken by Defendants under its auspices. \n7  16.  Defendants have not and did not publicly rely on any of the limited authorities, as \n8  described below, that would lawfully allow deployments of federal agents within the parameters \n9  defined in such laws.  \n10  17.  The Policy is not merely a change in Defendants’ interpretation of their own \n11  enforcement authority. The Policy is based on a misunderstanding, misinterpretation, error, and/or \n12  disregard for the scope of Defendants’ legal authority. \n13  18.  In addition, no constitutional authority has been offered for the related Practice of \n14  commandeering Portland’s law enforcement by refusing to release Portland law enforcement \n15  officers from their temporary deputation as federal agents, conscripting them without consent and \n16  against Portland’s express wishes into ongoing deputation.   \n17  19.  This monumental policy change and new commandeering practice harms Plaintiffs’ \n18  and other cities’ abilities to safely govern and police in ways aligned with and responsive to \n19  community goals and racial equity reforms. As local governments, Plaintiffs have independent \n20  police forces; community relationships; and locally-determined policing policies, practices, and \n21  procedures. Plaintiffs’ police forces have always been able to expect when and how federal law \n22  enforcement agents could assert federal powers within their jurisdictions. The use of deployments \n23  and operations violating established constitutional parameters, politically motivated interventions, \n24  and lawless commandeering of local law enforcement are unconstitutional and unauthorized in \n25  part because of the havoc such actions impose on local jurisdictions and the innumerable ways in \n26  which these deployments run roughshod over the longstanding federalist balance of the general \n27  policing power.    \n28 \n- 5 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 6 of 48\n \n \n1  20.  Plaintiffs are further harmed by the Policy and Practice because they threaten, \n2  intimidate, chill and/or discourage the exercise of constitutional or civil rights of their residents, \n3  leaders, and/or the jurisdictions themselves.  \n4  21.  The Policy and Practice also harm Plaintiffs to the extent they have and will \n5  continue to incite violence and make it more difficult for Plaintiffs to fulfill their core public safety \n6  missions.  \n7  22.  Plaintiffs  are  additionally  harmed  by  their  increased  costs,  expenditures,  and \n8  resources devoted to responding to actions taken by Defendants under the Policy and Practice. \n9  23.  Plaintiffs therefore bring this action to enjoin Defendants’ new Policy and new \n10  Practice, which are unconstitutional, arbitrary and capricious, in excess of Defendants’ legal \n11  authority, and/or wholly pretextual.  \n12  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n13 \n24.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this is a civil action \n14 \narising under the United States Constitution; the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. \n15 \n§§ 701-706; and other federal statutes. \n16 \n25.  This Court has the authority to issue declaratory and injunctive relief under the \n17 \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202, and the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n18 \n26.   Venue is proper in this judicial district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1). \n19 \nDefendants are United States officers or agencies sued in their official capacities, a substantial part \n20 \nof the events or omissions giving rise to this action have occurred or will occur in this district, and \n21 \none Plaintiff resides in this district. \n22 \nINTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n23 \n27.  Pursuant to the Northern District Civil Local Rule 3-2(c)-(d), the intradistrict \n24 \nassignment should be to the Oakland or San Francisco Division because a substantial part of the \n25 \nacts or omissions that give rise to this action are occurring in the County of Alameda. \n26 \nPARTIES \n27 \n28.  The CITY OF PORTLAND is a municipal corporation governed by charter, located \n28 \nin the District of Oregon, and existing under the laws and constitution of the State of Oregon.  \n- 6 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 7 of 48\n \n \n1  Portland is home to more than 650,000 residents, and the City’s leadership has committed to \n2  significant reforms to local policing and other policies, with an aim toward promoting racial \n3  justice. \n4  29.  The CITY of OAKLAND is a municipal corporation and charter city located in the \n5  Northern District of California, organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State \n6  of California. The City of Oakland is home to over 420,000 people and consistently ranks as one \n7  of the most ethnically and racially diverse major cities in the United States. Approximately 23% \n8  of Oakland’s residents identify as Black or African American, 26% as Hispanic or Latinx, 15% as \n9  Asian or Asian-American, and 5.5% as multi-racial. The City’s leadership is engaged in significant \n10  reforms to local policing and other policies, with an aim toward promoting racial justice. \n11  30.  Plaintiffs are aggrieved by Defendants’ actions and have standing to bring this \n12  action because the Policy and its implementation and the Practice harm Plaintiffs’ independent and \n13  constitutionally recognized economic, dignitary, and proprietary interests and will continue to \n14  cause injury unless and until the Policy is vacated and Defendants’ practices are permanently \n15  enjoined.  \n16  31.  WILLIAM BARR is the United States Attorney General. He is sued in his official \n17  capacity.  \n18  32.  The UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE is a cabinet agency within \n19  the executive branch of the United States government and is an agency within the meaning of 5 \n20  U.S.C. § 552(f).  \n21  33.  CHAD F. WOLF is the purported Acting Secretary of Homeland Security. He is \n22  sued in his official capacity.  \n23  34.  The  UNITED  STATES  DEPARTMENT  OF  HOMELAND  SECURITY  is  a \n24  cabinet agency within the executive branch of the United States government and is an agency \n25  within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f). Its stated missions involve anti-terrorism, border security, \n26  immigration and customs. It was created in 2002 by combining 22 different federal departments \n27  and agencies into a single Cabinet agency.  \n28   \n- 7 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 8 of 48\n \n \n1  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n2  Background \n3  35.  Adherence to the Constitution is the bedrock of American democracy. Regardless \n4  of any changes to the interpretation of the Constitution over time, certain structures endure.  \n5  36.  One such foundational structure is the separation of federal powers: the division of \n6  authority and responsibility that guides all legal action taken in the United States. Under the \n7  separation of powers, the Congress makes law, the Executive Branch implements that law, and the \n8  Judiciary assesses the legality of those laws and actions. \n9  37.  Another foundational structure is federalism: the division or sharing of legal power \n10  between the national government and other government units, including states, counties, cities, \n11  parishes, commonwealths, territories, and tribal governments (hereafter “other governments”). \n12  Other governments, including cities, “ensure[] that powers which ‘in the ordinary course of affairs, \n13  concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people’ [are] held by governments more local and \n14  more accountable than a distant federal bureaucracy.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 \n15  U.S. 519, 536 (2012) (quoting The Federalist No. 45 at 293 (J. Madison)). \n16  38.  A federalist system’s division of power evolves, but in expected ways, such as \n17  through Congress passing new laws to further regulate other governments, or other governments \n18  using the courts to push back on laws or rules made by the Congress or the Executive Branch.  \n19  39.  Within this federalism framework and under the Tenth Amendment to the United \n20  States Constitution, the general police powers are left to the states, who in turn often delegate such \n21  plenary authority to cities like Plaintiffs. See, e.g., Cal. Const., art. 11, § 7; Or. Const., art XI, § 2. \n22  As the Supreme Court has long held, “the facets of governing that touch on citizens’ daily lives \n23  are normally administered by smaller governments closer to the governed.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. \n24  Bus., 567 U.S. at 536.   \n25  40.  Accordingly, the federal government has never created a federal domestic police \n26  force with broad powers. The general policing power, including over most violent crime, is left to \n27  other governments. As courts have repeatedly held, “We can think of no better example of the \n28  police power, which the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States, than \n- 8 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 9 of 48\n \n \n1  the suppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims.” United States v. Morrison, 529 \n2  U.S. 598, 618 (2000). \n3  41.  Instead, where Congress has authorized, the Executive Branch has executed, and \n4  the Judiciary approved, the federal  government has created  a constellation of different law \n5  enforcement agencies, each of which has a specific domain of authority as defined by federal \n6  statutes. For the most part, those domains of authority are not coextensive with other governments’ \n7  general policing power. \n8  42.  Within the scope of those federal statutes, such federal law enforcement activities \n9  have been limited to: (a) the enforcement of a direct federal interest (e.g., enforcement of a federal \n10  law); or (b) assisting other governments, which constitutes the enforcement of an indirect federal \n11  interest. \n12  43.  Whether enforcing a direct federal interest or assisting other governments, federal \n13  law enforcement acts within prescribed legal bounds. Either federal law enforcement is invited by \n14  other governments to participate in any number of lawful collaborative activities or federal law \n15  enforcement may intervene without invitation in the circumstances where federal law permits. \n16  44.  In the former category of invited collaboration, Plaintiffs have, like many other \n17  cities, frequently engaged in lawful partnerships with federal law enforcement. From subject-\n18  specific task forces to investigating borderless crimes, other governments often depend on and \n19  engage with federal law enforcement to help protect residents and visitors. Plaintiffs have, for \n20  example, partnered with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on child exploitation task forces; with \n21  the Drug Enforcement Administration to combat illegal drug trafficking; with the Bureau of \n22  Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to proactively identify the source of guns used for \n23  crimes; with the United States Marshals Service (“USMS”) to apprehend those fleeing the justice \n24  system; and with the United States Secret Service to tackle identity theft.  \n25  45.  These past and present local-federal relationships are voluntary and consensual. \n26  Federal law enforcement and local law enforcement agencies generally work together in Plaintiffs’ \n27  communities with a mutual understanding of the mission, clear directives regarding jurisdictional \n28  functions, and specific agreements (e.g., via Memoranda of Understanding or Agreement) that \n- 9 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 10 of 48\n \n \n1  inform both sides of their respective obligations. Such partnerships were and are authorized by \n2  law, typically memorialized by mutual agreement, and not the subject of this lawsuit. \n3  46.  In the latter category of uninvited intervention, the federal government has certain \n4  powers that are superior to those of other governments, made so by the Supremacy Clause.  \n5  47.  Such powers include federal enforcement of crucial fundamental federal rights, \n6  including civil rights. Throughout the nation’s history, federal enforcement authorities have at \n7  times  overridden  other  governments’  ignorant  or  bigoted  refusals  to  grant  or  defend \n8  constitutionally protected rights. Whether desegregating schools or extending the voting franchise \n9  to Black people, federal enforcement—without invitation or local approval—has been at times \n10  both lawful and vital. \n11  48.  Such intervention powers may also, in extraordinary circumstances, permit the \n12  deployment of federal forces domestically, in which federal law enforcement temporarily takes \n13  over the general police powers otherwise reserved to other governments. Such circumstances are \n14  constitutionally delineated by Article I, Section 8, one of the Militia Clauses (allowing Congress \n15  to “call[] forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union”) and by Article IV, Section 4 (the \n16  obligation to protect the states against invasion and against “domestic violence”).  \n17  49.  The Constitution reserves both  of those described powers for the  Legislative \n18  Branch, either exclusively or principally. The cited Militia Clause only gives power to Congress. \n19  The Article IV Republican Form of Government Clause gives power first to the Legislature, and \n20  then only to the Executive “when the Legislature cannot be convened.” \n21  50.  Under these authorities, Congress has, among other things, passed the Insurrection \n22  Act of 1807, now codified as amended at 10 U.S.C. §§ 251-255, which allows domestic military \n23  intervention when circumstances make it impracticable to enforce the law by any other means, and \n24  the complementary Posse Comitatus Act of 1876, now codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1385, eliminating \n25  virtually any use of the military to regulate American civilians. \n26  51.  These laws represent some key legal guardrails constitutionally implemented by \n27  the Legislative Branch to limit and define where the Executive Branch may, without permission \n28  and while overriding other governments’ prerogatives, nonetheless enforce federal law. \n- 10 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 11 of 48\n \n \n1  52.  Specifically, the Insurrection Act empowers the President to call into service the \n2  United States Armed Forces and the National Guard: (a) when formally requested by a state; (b) \n3  to address an insurrection in any state, when that insurrection makes it impracticable to otherwise \n4  enforce the law; or (c) to address an insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination or \n5  conspiracy, in any state, which results in the deprivation of constitutionally secured rights, and \n6  where the state is unable, fails, or refuses to protect those rights. 10 U.S.C. §§ 251-253. \n7  53.  There is a set legal process for invoking the Insurrection Act that is neither \n8  clandestine nor equivocal. To invoke the Act, a president must issue a “proclamation to disperse”: \n9  that is, “by proclamation, immediately order the insurgents to disperse and retire peaceably to their \n10  abodes within a limited time.” 10 U.S.C. § 254. Such proclamations have been issued as Executive \n11  Orders and/or as Proclamations published in the Federal Register.  \n12  54.  The Insurrection Act has never been invoked in the 21st century. In its limited usage \n13  in  the  20th  century,  the  federal  government  often  invoked  the  Act  to  protect  civil  rights, \n14  particularly the rights of Black children to attend desegregated schools.  \n15  55.  When the Act was most recently invoked, in 1992, then-President George H.W. \n16  Bush issued a general Proclamation and an operationalizing Executive Order. See Proclamation \n17  No. 6427, 57 Fed. Reg. 19,359 (May 1, 1992); Exec. Order No. 12804, 57 Fed. Reg. 19,361 (May \n18  1, 1992). Executive Order 12804 provided detailed instructions for Cabinet officials to respond to \n19  the alleged insurrection in California. Among other things, it directed the Attorney General: “(1) \n20  to coordinate the activities of all Federal agencies assisting in the suppression of violence and in \n21  the administration of justice in and about the City and County of Los Angeles, and other districts \n22  of California, and (2) to coordinate the activities of all such agencies with those of State and local \n23  agencies similarly engaged.” \n24  56.  DOJ  and  Defendant  Barr  are  aware  of  the  legal  process  for  invoking  the \n25  Insurrection Act. As an agency, DOJ has typically been involved when the Insurrection Act is \n26  invoked. As an individual, Defendant Barr was serving in an official capacity as Attorney General \n27  in 1992. \n28 \n- 11 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 12 of 48\n \n \n1  57.  The Executive Branch’s authority under the Act, or under other such extraordinary \n2  emergency powers, does not undergird the Policy.  \n3  58.  Any invocations of emergency powers or interventions under those powers are rare, \n4  reserved for extraordinary circumstances, and are not the subject of this lawsuit. \n5  59.  Finally, Executive Branch agencies, endowed by Congress or the Constitution with \n6  particular powers, must, per Article II, Section 3, “take care” to execute their duties under those \n7  authorities. Sometimes, those authorities are clearly defined by statute or a provision of the \n8  Constitution. At other times, those authorities are further crystalized and concretized by Executive \n9  Branch interpretations of the authority so granted. Those interpretations come in forms such as \n10  regulations, rules, and myriad types of sub-regulatory guidance.  \n11  60.  The legality of such Executive Branch interpretations of its authority is easily \n12  tested, commonly through the APA, which governs how the Executive Branch creates and acts on \n13  those interpretations, and what those interpretations are. Stated simply, the APA is a key method \n14  by which the Judiciary may assess the legality of the Executive Branch’s interpretation of its \n15  powers,  including  whether  such  interpretations  are  “arbitrary  and  capricious,”  “contrary  to \n16  constitutional right[s],” or “in excess of statutory authority.” 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n17  61.  Such Executive Branch interpretations of its authority may also be tested through \n18  other legal means, such as by questioning their constitutionality directly in federal court. \n19  62.  Such Executive Branch interpretations are or may be the subject of this lawsuit. \n20  63.  As these recitations reflect, the federal government has lawful tools to intervene— \n21  voluntarily  or  involuntarily—in  other  governments’  exercise  of  their  police  powers.  These \n22  recitations also reflect that those tools are either used with mutual agreement, or without agreement \n23  in circumstances, such as those enumerated, rooted in the Constitution. Finally, these recitations \n24  reflect that the federal government follows lawful and expected paths to exercise authority over \n25  other governments. \n26  // \n27  // \n28  // \n- 12 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 13 of 48\n \n \n1  Policy Change Regarding Deployment and Operation of Federal Forces  \n2  64.  Consistent with the above framework, until recently, Plaintiffs believed that they \n3  understood the structure, procedures, and basis for both the invited and the uninvited deployment \n4  and operations of federal law enforcement agents into their communities.  \n5  65.  However, in recent months, following the direction of President Trump, Defendants \n6  have instituted this new Policy, whose full parameters are unknown, but that, at minimum, \n7  unlawfully expands the unilateral deployment and operations of federal law enforcement to quell \n8  protests and broadly assert general police powers.  \n9  66.  The Policy and each and every instance where Defendants, through their officers, \n10  employees, and/or agents, unlawfully deployed or commanded federal law enforcement to act in \n11  excess of or contrary to 40 U.S.C. § 1315 or the Constitution constitutes “final agency action” \n12  under the APA.  \n13  Prior Status Quo \n14  67.  President Trump has long issued threats against cities he views as progressive or \n15  racially diverse, including Plaintiffs. In 2017, he threatened to “send in the feds” to Chicago if \n16  their mayor did not fix the “carnage,” and compared the city unfavorably to Afghanistan. In 2019, \n17  in describing Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco, he referred to these “sanctuary cities \n18  run by liberal people” as places where “people living there are living in hell,” and threatened that \n19  he might “intercede” or “may do something to get that whole thing cleaned up.” In 2020, he \n20  repeatedly threatened Plaintiffs Portland and Oakland. \n21  68.  Separately, since President Trump took office, Americans have engaged in some of \n22  the largest protests in our nation’s history. The day after his inauguration, between 3.2 million and \n23  5.2 million people marched in the streets to protest for women’s rights and against the President. \n24  Hundreds of thousands protested again for the same reason on the same day in the following years. \n25  Since January 2017, millions of people have participated in protests across the country, including \n26  protests at federal property, monuments, memorials, and statues, as well as at state and local \n27  property, monuments, memorials, and statues. \n28 \n- 13 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 14 of 48\n \n \n1  69.  Despite President Trump’s repeated threats, and despite thousands of protests by \n2  millions of Americans, Defendants never previously asserted or exercised the authority they are \n3  now asserting and exercising under the Policy, nor, on information and belief, engaged in the \n4  related Practice.  \n5  70.  An alleged source of the authority for the Policy is 40 U.S.C. § 1315. Under \n6  subsection (a) of that statute, the Secretary of Homeland Security protects the buildings, grounds, \n7  and property that are owned, occupied, or secured by the federal government.  \n8  71.  Although the Federal Protective Service (“FPS”), a division of DHS, is typically \n9  the main provider of security and law enforcement services at federal government facilities, the \n10  Secretary of Homeland Security may transfer DHS officers or agents specifically “for duty in \n11  connection with the protection of” that federal property. 40 U.S.C. § 1315(b)(1).  \n12  72.  The scope of 40 U.S.C. § 1315 is clear. The statute states that the Secretary of \n13  Homeland Security: “shall protect the buildings, grounds, and property that are owned, occupied, \n14  or secured by the Federal Government (including any agency, instrumentality, or wholly owned \n15  or mixed-ownership corporation thereof) and the persons on the property.” Id. § 1315(a).  \n16  73.  The authority granted off federal property is limited—section 1315 only allows \n17  designated employees to perform authorized duties outside of federal property “to the extent \n18  necessary to protect the property and persons on the property.” Id. § 1315(b)(1). Further, in the \n19  statute’s six specifically enumerated powers, only one power, § 1315(b)(2)(E), allows for activity \n20  “on and off the property in question.” Per the canon of expressio unius est exclusio alterius, \n21  including that these powers extend “on and off” federal property in one subsection implies that the \n22  five other enumerated powers do not likewise extend “on and off” the property, unless they are to \n23  advance the specific goal articulated in subsection (b)(1). \n24  74.  Outside of federal property, the Secretary of Homeland Security may enter into \n25  agreements with federal agencies and with state and local governments for officers and agents \n26  designated under section 1315 “to enforce Federal laws and State and local laws concurrently with \n27  other Federal law enforcement officers and with State and local law enforcement officers.” Id. \n28  § 1315(e). Similarly, the Secretary “may utilize the facilities and services of Federal, State, and \n- 14 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 15 of 48\n \n \n1  local law enforcement agencies, with the consent of the agencies.” Id. § 1315(d)(3)(emphasis \n2  added). \n3  75.  Based on information and belief and on publicly available facts such as those \n4  recited here, until as recently as May 2020, there had been no policy or practice through which \n5  Defendants unilaterally deployed or commanded federal law enforcement under 40 U.S.C. § 1315 \n6  for general police purposes; to respond to or quash civil protests; to protect and surveil non-federal \n7  property, monuments, memorials, or statues; or to unilaterally take over non-federal property.  \n8  76.  For example, as recently as April 2020, hundreds of protestors gathered at the \n9  Michigan State Capitol in Lansing to protest executive orders and shelter-in-place orders in light \n10  of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n11  77.  The Michigan State Capitol was completed in 1878, has been listed on the National \n12  Register of Historic Places since 1971, and was designated as a National Historic Landmark in \n13  1992. The Capitol and its grounds contain at least one monument, three memorials, and several \n14  statues. The Capitol is 0.1 miles from the Charles E. Chamberlain Federal Building and Post \n15  Office. \n16  78.  During  these  so-called  “lockdown  protests,”  many  protestors  openly  carried \n17  firearms in or around the Capitol, forcibly entered the Michigan State Capitol, issued threats \n18  against Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and verbally assaulted Michigan state police.  \n19  79.  As another example, as recently as May 2020, hundreds of protesters gathered at \n20  the California State Capitol in Sacramento to protest executive orders and shelter-in-place orders \n21  in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n22  80.  The California State Capitol was completed in 1874, has been listed on the National \n23  Register of Historic Places since 1973, and was designated as a California Historical Landmark in \n24  1974. The Capitol and its park are home to numerous monuments, memorials, and statues, \n25  including the World Peace Rose Garden, the California Peace Officers’ Memorial, the Vietnam \n26  Veterans Memorial, and the Thomas Starr King Memorial. The Capitol is one mile from the local \n27  federal courthouse and under one mile from the local DHS office. \n28 \n- 15 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 16 of 48\n \n \n1  81.  During these so-called “lockdown protests,” protesters gathered at the Capitol in \n2  violation of stay-at-home orders, confronted California Highway Patrol officers, and displayed \n3  depictions of California Governor Gavin Newsom as a Nazi in front of a Swastika banner.  \n4  82.  In April and May, protestors also gathered outside the State Capitol in Salem, \n5  Oregon. At least one protestor appears to be open carrying a rifle in news footage. Members of the \n6  far-right militia groups the “Three Percenters” and “Proud Boys” also attended the protests. \n7  Several of the protests were allegedly organized by militia groups in violation of Oregon Governor \n8  Kate Brown’s stay-at-home orders.  \n9  83.  Based  on  information  and  belief,  federal  law  enforcement  officers  were  not \n10  deployed in response to any of these so-called “lockdown protests”; not to surveil the protestors \n11  or public officials; not to assess threats to public buildings, monuments, memorials, or statues; not \n12  to protect against civil unrest; and not to otherwise engage in general policing. \n13  Existing Framework for Local Law Enforcement Mutual Aid or Cross Designation with Other \nGovernment Agencies \n14   \n15  84.  As described above, there are numerous examples of how local law enforcement, \n16  including Plaintiffs’ police departments, collaborate with or receive assistance from other law \n17  enforcement agencies, including federal law enforcement agencies such as Defendants and their \n18  subcomponents.  \n19  85.  Coordinating with local law enforcement has, outside of the Policy and Practice, \n20  been fundamental to how federal law enforcement agencies interact with their local counterparts. \n21  86.  Even in circumstances where the local jurisdiction has policies that are directly in \n22  opposition to the federal law enforcement agency’s activities, the federal agencies, including \n23  Defendants,  have  nonetheless  coordinated  with  local  agencies  in  some  fashion,  given  the \n24  longstanding recognition of the importance of such coordination. \n25  87.  For example, 28 C.F.R. § 0.112 governs special deputation powers of the USMS, \n26  which is a bureau within DOJ. Pursuant to this section, the USMS Director is authorized to \n27  deputize, in relevant part, “[s]elected federal, state, or local law enforcement officers whenever the \n28  law enforcement needs of the U.S. Marshals Service so require.” 28 C.F.R. § 0.112(b).   \n- 16 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 17 of 48\n \n \n1  88.  The duties of the USMS include protecting the federal judiciary, apprehending \n2  federal fugitives, managing and selling seized assets illegally acquired by criminals, housing and \n3  transporting federal prisoners, and operating the Witness Security Program.  \n4  89.  Separately, Plaintiffs have also  long entered into  and relied on “mutual  aid” \n5  agreements with fellow local governments, such as other city and county governments. These \n6  mutual aid agreements set forth the circumstances under which mutual aid partners will come to \n7  the assistance of a member of the agreement. For example, Oakland has requested assistance from \n8  its mutual aid partners, such as Alameda County and surrounding cities, in responding to natural \n9  disasters or to certain violent “Occupy” protests a decade ago. It is not uncommon for mutual aid \n10  partners to request dozens or even hundreds of officers to assist with significant needs. Indeed, in \n11  response to the recent demonstrations, Portland has sought and received mutual aid from numerous \n12  other local law enforcement agencies. \n13  90.  No matter the originating source of the mutual aid, Plaintiffs’ police departments \n14  follow specific procedures when any outside law enforcement participate in their operations, or \n15  when outside law enforcement perform operations in their cities. \n16  91.  Those procedures typically include that, when any outside law enforcement agency \n17  comes to assist Plaintiffs’ police departments, those outside agents or officers first check in at the \n18  local staging center or emergency operations center, learn of the operation plan, and are connected \n19  in some manner to the department’s communications systems. These universal steps are designed \n20  to protect all law enforcement officers and ensure they are operating with similar information and \n21  shared means of communication. \n22  Nationwide Protests for Racial Justice and Police Reform  \n23  92.  On May 25, 2020, George Floyd was tragically killed by Minneapolis police and a \n24  video of his death was widely circulated in the media. On May 26, 2020, people gathered in \n25  Minneapolis in protest. Shortly thereafter, people gathered throughout the nation, including in \n26  Plaintiffs’ jurisdictions, to advocate for police reform and racial justice.  \n27 \n28 \n- 17 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 18 of 48\n \n \n1  93.  Polls have suggested that between 15 million and 26 million people participated in \n2  these protests, making them the largest demonstrations in American history. Between May 22 and \n3  August 22, approximately 93% of protests were peaceful. \n4  94.  Incidents of property  damage and violence, however, were reported in  many \n5  jurisdictions in the country. Incidents of property damage occurred in suburban California, and \n6  armed civilians and other non-state actors committed acts of violence in states including Florida, \n7  Indiana, and Tennessee. \n8  95.  People  began  to  gather  in  Downtown Portland  on  or  around  May  29,  2020, \n9  including at an event titled “A Eulogy for Black America” organized by the Portland chapter of \n10  the NAACP. \n11  96.  On May 29, 2020, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler issued a statement that he stood \n12  “in solidarity with those who grieve for the senseless death of George Floyd” and committed to \n13  standing alongside “our black community and not just call out racism when we see it, but \n14  meaningfully take a stand against it.” \n15  97.  In Portland, protests continued in June. The first few days of June were identified \n16  as having the largest crowds of the Portland George Floyd protests, with numbers exceeding \n17  10,000 people each day. During this time, a much smaller group of people engaged in significant \n18  property damage and violence directed at police. Notwithstanding some criminal activity, the \n19  majority of the protests remained peaceful, and toward the end of June, the scale of protests began \n20  to decrease. The focal points of protests during June were the Justice Center (which houses the \n21  Portland  Police  Bureau’s  (“PPB’s”)  Central  Precinct  and  primary  offices,  as  well  as  the \n22  Multnomah County Detention Center) and other PPB and Multnomah County buildings.  \n23  98.   At this time, President Trump continued his past practice of frequent and repeated \n24  threats to deploy uninvited federal law enforcement and/or military power to progressive cities.   \n25  99.  Protests continued nationally throughout June 2020, along with the President’s \n26  threatening rhetoric. \n27  // \n28 \n// \n- 18 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 19 of 48\n \n \n1  President Trump Issues the Executive Order; Defendants Institute the Policy \n2  100.  On  June  26,  2020,  President  Trump  signed  Executive  Order  13933,  entitled \n3  Protecting  American  Monuments,  Memorials,  and  Statues  and  Combating  Recent  Criminal \n4  Violence. \n5  101.  The Executive Order announced that the federal government would: (a) prosecute \n6  anyone  vandalizing  or  desecrating  public  monuments,  memorials,  and  statues;  government \n7  property; or religious property; (b) prosecute anyone inciting related violence; and (c) withhold \n8  federal support from local and state governments that failed to protect such structures from \n9  vandalism.  \n10  102.  The Executive Order further stated that if the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary \n11  of Homeland Security, or the Administrator of General Services requested federal personnel “to \n12  assist with the protection of Federal monuments, memorials, statues, or property,” they shall be \n13  provided by the Department of Defense, DOJ, and/or DHS.  \n14  103.  Defendants  rapidly began to  implement  this Executive Order, in light of the \n15  President’s perceived motivation of quelling protests, targeting Democratic cities, and establishing \n16  broad federal police presence in certain cities.  \n17  104.  Based on information and belief, such implementation constitutes all of or is a \n18  substantial part of the Policy. \n19  105.  First, on July 1, 2020, Defendant Wolf announced—pursuant to the Executive \n20  Order—the formation of PACT within DHS. PACT was charged with “conduct[ing] ongoing \n21  assessments of potential civil unrest or destruction and allocat[ing] resources to protect people and \n22  property,” including “potential surge  activity to ensure the continuing protection of critical \n23  locations.” \n24  106.  Second, Defendants began changing or continuing to change guidance regarding \n25  the  lawful  scope  of  federal  activity  under  40  U.S.C.  §  1315.  Rather  than  limiting  federal \n26  involvement under that statute to federal laws or property, Defendants expanded the ability of \n27  federal agents to address threats to any public monument, memorial, or statue, regardless of its \n28  federal nature.  \n- 19 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 20 of 48\n \n \n1  107.  For example, a July 2020 leaked, unclassified document entitled “Job Aid: DHS \n2  Office  of  Intelligence  &  Analysis  (I&A)  Activities  in  Furtherance  of  Protecting  American \n3  Monuments, Memorials, Statues, and Combatting Recent Criminal Violence” (“Job Aid”) shows \n4  that parts of the Defendants’ intelligence community were now authorized to monitor and collect \n5  information regarding protest activities beyond suspected or planned attacks on federal facilities, \n6  including threats to damage or destroy any public monument, memorial, or statue. \n7  108.  The “Job Aid” was intended to  “expand[] intelligence activities necessary to \n8  mitigate the significant threat to homeland security articulated in the President’s executive order \n9  of June 26, 2020.” \n10  109.  Finally,  Defendants  began  deploying,  cross-designating,  and/or  commanding \n11  federal law enforcement agents pursuant to the Executive Order and the Policy.  \n12  110.  Specifically, Defendant Wolf announced the deployment and pre-position of Rapid \n13  Deployment Teams across the country ahead of the July 4th holiday. Defendant Wolf stated that \n14  the task force would not “stand idly by while violent anarchists and rioters seek not only to \n15  vandalize and destroy the symbols of our nation, but to disrupt law and order and sow chaos in our \n16  communities.” \n17  111.  Taken  together,  the  Executive  Order,  the  creation  or  amendment  of  internal \n18  guidance documents, the creation of the PACT, the creation of other cross-designated federal law \n19  enforcement teams, and the deployment and operations of such teams, are, form part of, or are \n20  results of, the Policy.  \n21  112.  The Policy constitutes “final agency action.” \n22  Deployment and Other Activities in Portland  \n23  113.  The following recitations are merely limited examples of why the Policy and/or \n24  specific acts in furtherance of the Policy constitute final agency action under which rights and \n25  obligations have been determined and from which legal consequences have flowed. \n26  114.  It is unclear how many deployments of federal agents were made in July pursuant \n27  to the Policy.  \n28 \n- 20 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 21 of 48\n \n \n1  115.  In the days before Defendants deployed federal personnel to Portland, the crowds \n2  attending demonstrations had shrunk. By early July 2020, only about 150 people could be seen \n3  gathering in downtown Portland on any given night. \n4  116.  On or about July 2, 2020, Defendant Wolf ordered the deployment of DHS, USMS, \n5  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), and the FPS to Portland in response to civil protests \n6  as part of Operation Diligent Valor. \n7  117.  Defendants did not seek Portland’s consent. Defendants did not act at the direction \n8  of PPB incident command that had been policing nightly protests for over a month. \n9  118.  The federal forces deployed to Portland from CBP included members of BORTAC, \n10  a paramilitary unit of the United States Border Patrol. BORTAC  troops wear military-type \n11  uniforms and armament, are trained for tactical raids on organized gangs smuggling persons or \n12  drugs into the United States, and have in the past been deployed to such places as Afghanistan and \n13  Iraq.  \n14  119.  On information and belief, BORTAC troops have no training in civilian crowd \n15  control.  \n16  120.  Through Operation Diligent Valor, Defendants sent teams of agents—untrained in \n17  crowd control and wearing military fatigues—onto Portland’s streets. Their uniforms bore no \n18  governmental, administrative or personal names, just the word “police” in tape. Federal agents \n19  used tactics and munitions that escalated violence in Portland. \n20  121.  On or about July 11, 2020, federal agents allegedly fired impact munitions into an \n21  unarmed crowd. One of the bullets struck a protestor and fractured his skull. \n22  122.  Starting  on  or  about  July  14,  2020,  federal  agents  drove  around  Portland  in \n23  unmarked  vans  and  detained  individuals  associated  with  the  protests.  Federal  agents  were \n24  patrolling and detaining individuals far beyond the immediate vicinity of the federal courthouse. \n25  Agents allegedly seized at least one individual who was more than two blocks from the courthouse \n26  and not engaged in any activity related to federal property.  \n27  123.  Upon information and belief, federal agents seized multiple protestors and held \n28  them for hours before releasing them for lack of probable cause. The federal agents gave no \n- 21 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 22 of 48\n \n \n1  justification for why they detained particular residents, searched their belongings, and placed \n2  residents in cells for hours before reading them their Miranda rights.  \n3  124.  Far from imposing peace in the City’s streets, the tactics and munitions used by \n4  federal agents antagonized demonstrators, escalated the protests, and caused further unrest.  \n5  125.  On July 22, 2020, federal agents fired tear gas into a crowd that included Portland \n6  Mayor Wheeler.  \n7  126.  Later reports of internal DHS documents showed that the Office of Intelligence \n8  Analysis  also  collected  and  analyzed  messages  between  protesters  in  Portland,  specifically \n9  surveilling protesters’ communications via the Telegram messaging app, discussing where to take \n10  the protests and how to avoid officers. The purpose of this monitoring is still unknown. It is also \n11  unknown whether the surveillance was limited to the protection of federal property or gathered on \n12  federal property.  \n13  127.  On July 29, 2020, the Governor Brown reached a negotiated agreement with the \n14  federal government. Defendants agreed to withdraw federal agents from Portland with assurance \n15  that Oregon State Police would take on additional duties guarding the safety of the federal \n16  courthouse in Portland.  \n17  Justifications for the Policy Are Pretextual \n18  128.  Although the purported purpose of the deployment was to protect federal property \n19  that had been vandalized or threatened during protests, anonymous statements from White House \n20  Officials indicate such purpose was mere pretext. The sources alleged that President Trump \n21  became interested in federal operations against protestors in Portland as a way to convey a “law-\n22  and-order message” and to “amplify strife in cities.” \n23  129.  As stated above, DHS has cited 40 U.S.C. § 1315 as the legal basis for Operation \n24  Diligent Valor and the general practice of deploying federal troops to Portland, despite the \n25  observed scope and operations of agents being well beyond the purpose or function of protecting \n26  federal persons or property. \n27  130.  The  U.S.  Crisis  Monitor  found  that  prior  to  that  deployment,  “over  83%  of \n28  demonstrations  in  Oregon  were  non-violent.  Post-deployment,  the  percentage  of  violent \n- 22 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 23 of 48\n \n \n1  demonstrations  [rose]  from  under  17%  to  over  42%  [in  Oregon],  suggesting that  the \n2  federal response has only aggravated unrest.” \n3  131.  Despite statements justifying deployments as responses to crime or “anarchy,” \n4  crime rates in Plaintiffs’ communities have been decreasing overall; neither city is in the list of top \n5  10 United States cities with the largest number of violent crimes per 100,000 residents. Moreover, \n6  Plaintiffs’ crime rates do not differ dramatically from those in other, Republican-run cities. For \n7  example, violent crime rates in Fresno, Jacksonville, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa—cities with \n8  Republican mayors—far exceed the violent crime rates in Portland. These cities also have murder \n9  rates at twice that of Portland.    \n10  132.  A  comprehensive  review  by  the  Armed  Conflict  Location  and  Event  Data \n11  (“ACLED”) Project and the Princeton University Bridging Divides Initiative underscores the \n12  overall peaceful nature of the social justice-related protests in summer 2020. Between May 25, \n13  2020, and August 22, 2020, there were 7,750 Black Lives Matter-related demonstrations in 2,440 \n14  locations in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Overall, in summer 2020, there were at least 10,600 \n15  demonstrations across the United States. Of those, more than 93% involved only peaceful protests. \n16  And according to ACLED, violence occurred at around 220 locations. \n17  133.  President Trump and Defendants have repeatedly made public comments revealing \n18  that the officially stated goal of operations such as those in Portland is not protecting federal \n19  property. Instead, their statements suggest that the animating and invidious purpose for these \n20  actions—that is, for the Policy—is to punish progressive cities and leaders and violently quell the \n21  exercise of constitutionally protected activity. Specifically, the President’s, Defendants’, and \n22  Policy’s purpose is to further the view that diverse and/or progressive cities and their leaders, and \n23  movements for racial justice and police reform, are dangerous and extreme circumstances that \n24  should be suppressed. \n25  134.  President Trump has also repeatedly commented that the purpose of deployment \n26  under the Policy of federal agents to Portland was to “quell” the protests, and that the goal was to \n27  “clean out this beehive of terrorists.” He has stated that protesters are “anarchists” who “hate our \n28  country.” And in describing the deployment to Portland under the Policy, President Trump stated: \n- 23 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 24 of 48\n \n \n1  “We’ve done a great job in Portland . . . . Portland was totally out of control, and they went in, and \n2  I guess we have many people right now in jail. We very much quelled it, and if it starts again, we’ll \n3  quell it again very easily. It’s not hard to do, if you know what you’re doing.” \n4  135.  In addition, Defendant Wolf affirmed that actions taken under the Policy were \n5  without other governments’ consent, asserting: “The city of Portland has been under siege for 47 \n6  straight days by a violent mob while local political leaders refuse to restore order to protect their \n7  city . . . . I reiterate the Department’s offer to assist local and state leaders to bring an end to the \n8  violence perpetuated by anarchists.” \n9  136.  Local and state leaders have not accepted that offer.  \n10  137.  Local and state officials have repeatedly and vehemently stated their opposition to \n11  the federal deployment in Portland. Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum filed a lawsuit \n12  against the federal government to stop its deployment and tactics. Oregon Governor Brown stated: \n13  “This political theater from President Trump has nothing to do with public safety. The President \n14  is failing to lead this nation. Now he is deploying federal officers to patrol the streets of Portland \n15  in a blatant abuse of power by the federal government.”  \n16  138.  From the outset, the City of Portland has expressed its opposition to the deployment \n17  of federal agents under Operation Diligent Valor without its consent.   \n18  139.  Only a few days after the federal agents were deployed, on July 8, 2020, Portland’s \n19  Deputy Police Chief Chris Davis made a public statement that the presence of federal agents, who \n20  are “governed by their own policies and procedures,” only “complicates things” for PPB.   \n21  140.  On July 19, 2020, Mayor Wheeler stated the following: \n22  What’s  happening  here  is,  we  have  dozens,  if  not  hundreds  of  federal  troops \ndescending upon our city. And what they’re doing is, they are sharply escalating the \n23 \nsituation . . . our local and state law enforcement officials had contained the situation \n. . . The tactics that the Trump administration are using on the streets of Portland are \n24 \nabhorrent . . . this is completely unconstitutional. \n25   \n26  141.  In response to the tactics and munitions used by federal agents, and consequent \n27  public outcry, on July 22, 2020, Portland’s City Council adopted Resolution 37496, which \n28  prohibits PPB cooperation with any federal agents deployed to Portland under an executive order. \n- 24 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 25 of 48\n \n \n1  In response to Defendants’ actions under the Policy, on July 28, 2020, Oakland’s City Council \n2  adopted Resolution No. 88276 (“Directing And Authorizing The City Attorney And The City \n3  Administrator To Take Any And All Lawful Necessary Steps To Protect The Rights Of The People \n4  And The City Of Oakland Against President Trump’s Threats To Take Actions That Result In \n5  Harm To The People Of Oakland Or The City Of Oakland, And Against Any Related Actions \n6  Federal Officers Take That Result In Harm To The People Of Oakland Or The City Of Oakland”).     \n7  142.  The actions taken by Defendants in Portland under the Policy were and are not \n8  taken pursuant to any known lawful federal authority.  \n9  Plaintiffs Remain at Risk Under the Policy \n10 \n143.  Rather than retreat from the activities in Portland, Defendants have expressed an \n11 \nintent to expand the presence of federal law enforcement throughout the United States. \n12 \n144.  President Trump has indicated that, under the Policy, Defendants will continue to \n13 \ntarget cities he views as progressive, stating in early September: “They’ll make every city look \n14 \nlike frankly, a Portland, or you look at other Democrat-run cities. Look at what’s happened in New \n15 \nYork, as high as 300% increase in crime. Chicago, Baltimore, take a look at Oakland. All \n16 \nDemocrat-run top 10 cities in the country and long beyond that, all Democrat-run.”  \n17 \n145.  As recently  as September 21, 2020, President Trump  continued to  propagate \n18 \ndisinformation about Plaintiffs. He stated: “What they’re talking about, you look at Portland, you \n19 \nlook at Chicago, you look at New York, you look at Baltimore and Oakland and all—these are \n20 \nDemocrat-run cities that are horrible on crime, there’s no law and order, no cash bail, no anything.” \n21 \n146.  Though most federal agents were temporarily pulled out of Portland, President \n22  Trump has threatened that they can return at any time. The President also has stated the federal \n23 \ngovernment will further escalate any conflict if local law enforcement does not rein in “anarchists \n24 \nand agitators.” He has consistently stated that he will not hesitate to send in federal authorities if \n25 \nthe local government could not stop “crime and violence” from breaking out. \n26 \n147.  The President’s threats and warnings are not limited to federal property. He recently \n27 \nannounced a plan to send law enforcement to polling places on election day, stating: “We’re going \n28 \n- 25 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 26 of 48\n \n \n1  to have sheriffs, and we’re going to have law enforcement. And we’re going to have hopefully \n2  U.S. attorneys, and we’re going to have everybody and attorney generals.” \n3  148.  The  President’s  provocations  continue.  He  recently  issued  a  memorandum \n4  purporting to direct Defendants to review federal funding provided to “anarchist” cities, including \n5  Portland, and to withdraw such funding to punish these cities. \n6  149.  Defendants continue to take new or continuing unlawful actions under the Policy. \n7  For instance, DHS has erected and refused to remove a fence and barriers around the Hatfield \n8  Federal Courthouse in Portland, which are in the City-controlled public right-of-way. The fence \n9  and barriers, which extend into adjacent Main Street, effectively block an entire bike lane without \n10  Portland’s permission. The fence and barriers also extend onto Third Avenue and effectively block \n11  vehicular travel in one lane. \n12  150.  The only statutory authority DHS has offered to Portland to justify the fence is 40 \n13  U.S.C. § 1315. \n14  151.   The fence was first erected by FPS on July 18, 2020. According to a statement \n15  from U.S. Attorney Billy J. Williams, the federal government’s stated purpose of the fence was \n16  “to de-escalate tensions between protesters and federal law enforcement officers, and to allow \n17  much-needed building repairs to begin.” \n18  152.  The fence is not on federal property, and FPS did not seek permission before \n19  erecting the fence. In order to lawfully erect the fence, Portland City Code Chapter 17.24 requires \n20  a permit to be obtained from the Portland Bureau of Transportation (“PBOT”). FPS obtained no \n21  such permit. \n22  153.  Portland has asked FPS multiple times to move its fence out of the right-of-way \n23  and onto the sidewalk adjacent to the Courthouse. FPS has not yet done so and has taken the \n24  position that they are permitted to install the fence and associated barriers pursuant to 40 U.S.C. \n25  § 1315.  \n26  154.  In an October 7, 2020, email to Portland officials, FPS indicated its contractor had \n27  moved the fence to allow access to the storm drain and expected to move the fence back from the \n28 \n- 26 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 27 of 48\n \n \n1  bike lane “in the next few weeks.” This is merely the latest assurance by FPS that it will move its \n2  fence. \n3  155.  A July 14, 2020, document obtained by Oregon Public Broadcasting indicated that \n4  the federal government intended to rent the fence from its contractor for three to six months. \n5  156.  Defendants continue to have a presence and activities in Portland, and there is a \n6  continued dispute regarding the scope of their authority under 40 U.S.C. § 1315, including the \n7  ability to unilaterally take over City-controlled or -owned property under a pretext of securing \n8  federal property.  \n9  Defendant Wolf Was and Is Unlawfully Acting as Secretary of Homeland Security, and Any \nAspects of the Policy Promulgated or Implemented Under His Purported Authority Must Be Set \n10 \nAside \n11  157.  Federal service in Senate-confirmed positions is governed by, among other statutes, \n12  the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (“FVRA”), 5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq. If a person is acting \n13  unlawfully under the FVRA, their actions and their policies are “without force and effect.” 5 U.S.C. \n14  § 3348(d)(1). An action promulgated “without force and effect” “may not be ratified.”  Id. \n15  § 3348(d)(2). \n16  158.  Congress has delegated the U.S. Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) to \n17  play a core role in FVRA compliance: namely, per the FVRA, the GAO must collect information \n18  about vacancies, and if the GAO “makes a determination that an officer is serving longer than the \n19  210-day period including the applicable exceptions to such period under section 3346 or section \n20  3349a,  the  Comptroller  General  shall  report  such  determination  immediately”  to  various \n21  authorities, including Congress. 5 U.S.C. § 3349. \n22  159.  On August 14, 2020, the GAO issued a report under its FVRA duties and authority, \n23  entitled  “Department  of  Homeland  Security—Legality  of  Service  of  Acting  Secretary  of \n24  Homeland Security and Service of Senior Official Performing the Duties of Deputy Secretary of \n25  Homeland Security.” In sum, the report finds that Acting Secretaries “Wolf and [Ken] Cuccinelli \n26  were named to their respective positions of Acting Secretary and Senior Official Performing the \n27  Duties of Deputy Secretary by reference to an invalid order of succession” and that “[b]ecause Mr. \n28 \n- 27 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 28 of 48\n \n \n1  Wolf draws his authority to serve as Acting Secretary from [an invalid] Delegation, Mr. Wolf \n2  cannot, therefore, rely upon it to serve as the Acting Secretary.”  \n3  160.  The GAO report also analyzed whether Defendant Wolf could be lawfully serving \n4  under the succession provisions of the Homeland Security Act (“HSA”), 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2), and \n5  found that he could not.  \n6  161.  In addition to these findings from the GAO, numerous lawsuits have raised the \n7  same or similar questions about Defendant Wolf’s authority, and have asked courts—under the \n8  FVRA,  the  HSA,  or  other  laws  regarding  agency  authority—to  set  aside  various  policies \n9  promulgated under that purported authority. See, e.g., Immigrant Legal Resource Ctr. v. Wolf, \n10  2020 WL 5798269, at *9 (N.D. Cal. 2020) (holding that “[p]laintiffs have shown that they are \n11  likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that Mr. Wolf was not validly serving in office” and \n12  enjoining enforcement of the challenged rule); Casa de Maryland, Inc. v. Wolf, 2020 WL 5500165, \n13  at *23 (D. Md. 2020) (holding that “because Wolf filled the role of Acting Secretary without \n14  authority, he promulgated the challenged rules also ‘in excess of . . . authority’” and enjoining the \n15  rules’ enforcement); see also Bullock v. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 2020 WL 5746836 (D. Mont. \n16  2020) (holding that William Perry Pendley, the person exercising authority of the Director of the \n17  Bureau of Land Management, served unlawfully for 424 days and enjoining him from exercising \n18  that authority); L.M.-M., v. Cuccinelli, 442 F.Supp.3d 1, 29, 34 (D.D.C. 2020) (holding that Acting \n19  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) Director Cuccinelli “was designated to \n20  serve as the acting Director of USCIS in violation of the FVRA” and “because Cuccinelli was \n21  exercising the authority of the USCIS Director in violation of the FVRA, the directives were not \n22  issued ‘in accordance with law,’ and must, accordingly, be set aside under the APA”). \n23  162.  The lawsuits, like the GAO report, generally explain that because the FVRA \n24  generally bars acting officials from serving for more than 210 days in a position that requires \n25  Presidential appointment and Senate confirmation, 5 U.S.C. § 3346, and because the last Senate-\n26  confirmed DHS Secretary resigned on April 10, 2019, no one could have lawfully acted in that \n27  role under the FVRA, without appointment and confirmation, after November 6, 2019. Defendant \n28  Wolf assumed his office on November 13, 2019.  \n- 28 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 29 of 48\n \n \n1  163.  The lawsuits, also like the GAO report, generally further explain that the HSA sets \n2  an order of succession in the event of a vacancy, 6 U.S.C. §§ 113(a)(1)(A), (a)(1)(F) and (g)(1), \n3  and if certain enumerated positions are vacant, the Secretary may designate a “further order of \n4  succession,” id. § 113(g)(2), but that because the Acting DHS Secretary prior to Defendant Wolf \n5  unlawfully changed the order of DHS succession, Defendant Wolf cannot lawfully serve in his \n6  role. \n7  164.  Finally, the lawsuits generally ask courts to set aside and/or enjoin actions by \n8  officials acting unlawfully in federal agency roles, because those actions are “without force and \n9  effect,” 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(1), “may not be ratified,” id. § 3348(d)(2), and were therefore \n10  promulgated “in excess of statutory authority” and not “in accordance with law,” id. §§ 706(2)(C), \n11  (2)(A). \n12  165.  These lawsuits have been largely successful. \n13  166.  On information and belief, Defendant Wolf promulgated and/or implemented all, \n14  some, or part of the Policy challenged in this lawsuit, and any aspects of the Policy promulgated \n15  and/or implemented under his authority must be set aside and/or enjoined. \n16  Related Practice of Unlawfully Commandeering Portland’s Law Enforcement Officers \n17 \n167.  In addition and related to the Policy, Defendants continue to engage in a related \n18 \nPractice that also asserts authority not delegated to them under the Constitution or under other \n19 \nlegal authority. \n20 \n168.  On or about September 21, 2020, the City of Portland, Oregon State Police, and \n21 \nseveral federal law enforcement agencies, including the USMS, began logistics planning for an \n22 \nanticipated rally of the Proud Boys in Portland on Saturday, September 26, 2020. \n23 \n169.  The Proud Boys are an extremist pro-White hate group. Members of the Proud \n24 \nBoys, which appeared at the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, “regularly \n25 \nspout white nationalist memes and maintain affiliations with known extremists” and “are known \n26 \nfor anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric.” \n27 \n170.  In anticipation of the Proud Boys rally, on September 25, 2020, Governor Brown \n28 \ndeclared a state of emergency and issued an executive order for the purpose of implementing a \n- 29 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 30 of 48\n \n \n1  coordinated law enforcement response. As part of the order, Governor Brown temporarily assumed \n2  control of local law enforcement, including PPB, the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office, the \n3  Gresham Police Department, and the Port of Portland Police. \n4  171.  Governor Brown appointed Multnomah County Sheriff Michael Reese and Oregon \n5  State  Police  Superintendent  Travis  Hampton  to  serve  as  incident  commanders  in  the  law \n6  enforcement coordination area, and they therefore assumed control of PPB, Multnomah County \n7  Sheriff’s Office, Gresham Police Department, and Port of Portland Police.  \n8  172.  The Governor’s executive order, by its own terms, became effective at 12:01 A.M. \n9  Pacific Time on Saturday, September 26, 2020, and expired at 12:01 AM Pacific Time on Monday, \n10  September 28, 2020. Governor Brown’s executive order and state of emergency were then \n11  terminated at 6:00 AM on September 27, 2020. \n12  173.  Pursuant to a direction given by Superintendent Hampton, on September 25, 2020, \n13  PPB Chief Charles Lovell authorized fifty-six officers, sergeants, and lieutenants from PPB’s \n14  Rapid Response Team, which typically handles protests, to be deputized as federal agents for the \n15  purposes of tactical response to the anticipated rally and disturbance of the peace caused by the \n16  Proud Boys. \n17  174.  Because of the Governor’s executive order and over the course of dealing with \n18  Oregon State Police, PPB anticipated that the deputation would be limited to the weekend \n19  surrounding the Proud Boys hate-related event or so long as the state of emergency remained in \n20  effect. \n21  175.  After the expiration of the state executive order, the federal deputation was in fact \n22  no longer needed. \n23  176.  On September 29, 2020, Portland City Attorney Tracy Reeve wrote to the U.S. \n24  Attorney’s Office in Portland to clearly and expressly communicate the City’s withdrawal of \n25  consent to the federal deputation of the fifty-six PPB officers.  \n26  177.  City Attorney Reeve explained that the Governor’s executive order had terminated, \n27  and PPB “was back under the control and direction of the City of Portland, and specifically Police \n28  Commissioner and Mayor Ted Wheeler and the Portland City Council.” Because the executive \n- 30 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 31 of 48\n \n \n1  order terminated, “[t]he City of Portland [did] not consent to the continuing federal deputization \n2  of PPB officers and hereby  formally  withdr[e]w[] its consent to  this deputization effective \n3  immediately.” \n4  178.  Neither the U.S. Attorney’s Office nor any other federal agency, including the \n5  USMS, responded to City Attorney Reeve’s communication. \n6  179.  Instead, on September 30, 2020, U.S. Attorney Williams and United States Marshal \n7  for the District of Oregon Russ Burger issued a press release regarding the deputation of the PPB \n8  officers. \n9  180.  The release stated that the “U.S. Marshal will not cancel the cross-deputation of \n10  local and state law enforcement officers.” In defense of their decision to commandeer Portland’s \n11  police force, U.S. Attorney Williams and United States Marshal for the District of Oregon Burger \n12  stated that continued deputation would provide “accountability and deterrence” for “criminal acts” \n13  and would support “front line law enforcement officers and their families in a way that they have \n14  not seen from City Hall.”   \n15  181.  Despite Defendant agencies’ purported desire to hold individuals accountable for \n16  and deter criminal acts, it is the responsibility of PPB and other local law enforcement to generally \n17  address criminal activity in Portland. It is the responsibility of the State of Oregon and City of \n18  Portland to enact laws and enforce laws that strike the proper balance between deterring criminal \n19  activity and supporting First Amendment expression. And it is the responsibility of Portland, as \n20  the employer of PPB officers, to support and protect local law enforcement. \n21  182.  On October 2, 2020, Mayor Wheeler, as Police Commissioner, directed PPB \n22  officers to take no further action of any kind pursuant to the federal deputation, including the \n23  enforcement of any federal law. \n24  183.  Nonetheless, because the federal government has refused to recognize Portland’s \n25  withdrawal of consent to deputation, Portland remains concerned about public confusion over the \n26  chain of command for the deputized PPB officers and the appearance that the officers could be \n27  ordered to respond to a federal chain of command, including by being ordered to enforce federal \n28  law.  \n- 31 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 32 of 48\n \n \n1  184.  The practice of continued deputation of Portland’s officers limits the City’s law \n2  enforcement discretion, creates potential conflict between Defendants and Portland over the use \n3  and tactics of Portland’s own officers and other law enforcement personnel, and unlawfully usurps \n4  the legislative and governance prerogative of local officials. \n5  185.  The  Practice  of  continued,  non-consensual  deputation  of  Portland’s  law \n6  enforcement officers unconstitutionally infringes on Portland’s authority to end the deputation and \n7  unconstitutionally compels local officers to continue to serve as federal law enforcement officials, \n8  whether in name or in scope of authority.    \n9  Harm to Plaintiffs  \n10    Economic Injury \n11  186.  Plaintiffs have already suffered economic harms and will continue to suffer such \n12  harms under the Policy and Practice. \n13    Portland’s Economic Harms \n14  187.  At the time of the federal government’s deployment into Portland, protests in the \n15  City were growing more peaceful and were more easily managed on a day-to-day basis by PPB. \n16  188.  As a direct result of the unlawful intervention by Defendants, Portland experienced \n17  a significant increase in violent protests and civil disturbance. Dr. Robert Pape and his team of \n18  researchers at the University of Chicago examined 122 protest events in Portland between May \n19  28, 2020, and August 6, 2020, and found that violence behavior increased and peaceful protests \n20  decreased during the 25 days when federal agents were present.   \n21  189.  Following the removal of federal agents from the streets of Portland, PPB was \n22  required to expend additional resources on crowd management and maintaining peace.  \n23  190.  As a direct result of the unlawful intervention of Defendants, PPB was required to \n24  spend additional money on overtime for patrol officers and other resources in response to the \n25  heightened tensions within Portland.   \n26  191.  Since July 2020 and continuing to the present, Portland’s elected leadership and \n27  other city officials have spent hundreds of hours in meetings, discussions, and other planning \n28 \n- 32 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 33 of 48\n \n \n1  efforts to respond to the presence of federal agents and to plan for possible additional federal \n2  intervention under the Policy. \n3    Oakland’s Economic Harms \n4  192.  Although Plaintiff City of Oakland has not yet been subject to direct federal \n5  intervention under the Policy, it has nonetheless already suffered and will continue to suffer \n6  economic harms. \n7  193.  In response to the Policy, Oakland has also engaged in new outreach through the \n8  departments that are members of its Emergency Operations Center, activities that would not have \n9  been necessary and resources that would not have been required but for the Policy.  \n10  194.  Oakland’s elected leadership has  devoted time since July 2020 preparing for \n11  possible federal intervention under the Policy.  \n12  195.  Oakland’s economic harms will significantly increase if the City becomes a target \n13  of deployment under the Policy, for many reasons. One such reason is the City’s “mutual aid” \n14  agreements, as described above. The City’s mutual aid agreements with other governments have \n15  never contemplated coming to the assistance of a sister government in the event of unprecedented \n16  federal intervention, such as the interventions that have occurred and may occur under the Policy. \n17  196.  Oakland has had mutual aid requests rejected when the aid sought does not comport \n18  with the agreements or conflicts with their partners’ policies.  \n19  197.  Oakland will suffer significant economic harm if it cannot rely on mutual aid. In \n20  the limited instances in which mutual aid has been unavailable, for instance, the Oakland Police \n21  Department has been forced to cancel days off, pay substantial additional overtime, and divert \n22  officers from their assigned duties. \n23  198.  Defendants did not take either Portland or Oakland’s economic harms into account \n24  in enacting the Policy. \n25  // \n26  // \n27  // \n28  // \n- 33 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 34 of 48\n \n \n1    Budgetary and Other Uncertainty; Impairment of Ability to Provide Services \n2  199.  Plaintiffs depend on the clear delineation of and communication about federal, \n3  state, and local police authority to safely govern and police their communities.  \n4  200.  Plaintiffs must know or reasonably expect when federal law enforcement agents \n5  will be or could be deployed in their cities, both as a constitutional and safety matter.  \n6  201.  Plaintiffs have historically worked closely with Defendants’ local representatives \n7  to ensure the safety of the federal property Defendants have authority to protect. \n8  202.  Even when the federal government has, in the past, intervened involuntarily in \n9  cities, counties, or states, it has done so using lawful processes, such as by filing enforcement \n10  actions in court or, in extreme and rare circumstances, formally invoking powers such as the \n11  Insurrection Act and following such statutes’ requirements for a declaration. The Act is not \n12  invoked secretly or ambiguously. 10 U.S.C. § 254. \n13  203.  The current Policy represents an entirely new process by which cities may find \n14  federal law enforcement in the midst of civil protests, throughout their jurisdictions, and surveilling \n15  their residents well beyond federal crimes or properties. \n16  204.  Plaintiffs’ uncertainty about whether, when, and with what parameters federal \n17  agents may be deployed to their cities under the Policy prevents them from appropriately advising \n18  their police departments and fire departments, among others, and from fully planning their budgets.  \n19  205.  Further, Plaintiffs’ police departments, among other departments, have a strong and \n20  abiding interest in the community relationships they have formed, often over many years, with \n21  advocates, faith leaders, youth groups, and others in their jurisdictions. These relationships are \n22  crucial to addressing racial justice issues, de-escalating and interrupting violence, and engaging in \n23  successful long-term reform efforts. These relationships are also premised on Plaintiffs’ police \n24  departments being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements, both formal and informal, with their \n25  community partners. Uncertainty regarding whether, when, and why federal law enforcement \n26  authorities,  who  lack  any  knowledge  of  these  crucial  agreements  and  understandings,  may \n27  intervene in Plaintiffs’ streets, harms Plaintiffs’ capacity to honor their commitments to their \n28  residents and reduce violence in their communities. \n- 34 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 35 of 48\n \n \n1  206.  Finally, because the full scope of the Policy is vague and unknown, Plaintiffs’ city \n2  officials have no certainty about whether any particular decision they might make will lead to \n3  federal intervention under the Policy. \n4  207.  Together, these injuries perceptibly impair Plaintiffs’ ability to provide the services \n5  they were formed to provide, and frustrate Plaintiffs’ goals and values. \n6  208.  Under the Policy, federal enforcement actions are likely to violate or contravene \n7  Plaintiffs’ otherwise lawful policies and values.  \n8    Activity Considered Impermissible by Local Policy Permitted Under the Policy  \n9  209.  Plaintiffs have specific policies, practices, and procedures for activities such as the \n10  use of force or use of surveillance by law enforcement authorities. \n11  210.  The City of Portland has a use of force policy, Directive 1010.00, and a crowd \n12  control policy, Directive 0635.10. These policies govern a number of PPB policies, practices, and \n13  procedures  in  responding  to  demonstrations,  including  PPB’s  use  of  impact  munitions  and \n14  chemical agents. The use of chemical agents has been further restricted by order of Portland’s \n15  Police Commissioner, consistent with the City’s values on policing.  \n16  211.  The City of Oakland has a use of force policy, DGO K-3, and a crowd control \n17  policy, Training Bulletin III-G. Those documents govern a number of Oakland Police Department \n18  policies, practices, and procedures, including its use of nonlethal impact weapons and chemical \n19  agents, as well as video and photographic recording of protesters engaged in protected First \n20  Amendment activity.  \n21  212.  These policies and trainings are intended to govern Plaintiffs’ police departments’ \n22  interactions  with  their  communities.  Based  on  those  policies  and  trainings,  in  Plaintiffs’ \n23  communities,  residents  have  expectations  for  their  interactions  with  local  law  enforcement.  \n24  Federal law enforcement officers have not been trained in municipal community policing, critical \n25  civilian crowd management, and/or de-escalation techniques. The unconstrained actions of federal \n26  forces undermine the work of local law enforcement, including ongoing violence prevention \n27  programs and community engagement.  \n28 \n- 35 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 36 of 48\n \n \n1  213.  Under the Policy, Plaintiff City of Portland has been unable to adhere to its local \n2  policies favoring de-escalation of potentially volatile situations because Defendants’ actions under \n3  the Policy have inflamed local passions, encouraged violence, and generated the need for PPB \n4  response where it otherwise would not have been needed. \n5  214.  Under  the  Practice,  PPB  officers  have  a  reasonable  likelihood  of  being \n6  commandeered into engaging in activity that violates their local policies via their unconsented-to \n7  deputation by Defendants. Defendants’ unlawful deputation of PPB officers also presently harms \n8  the City’s public-accountability and community-engagement policies by propagating the false \n9  narrative that City police are operating under Defendants’ authority and not under the direction \n10  and control of the City of Portland’s elected officials.  \n11    Frustration of Federal Court Orders; Separation of Powers \n12  215.  Plaintiffs are each, separately, under federal court orders that govern the activities \n13  of their police departments in various ways.  \n14  216.  Plaintiff City of Portland’s police department operates in part under a Negotiated \n15  Settlement Agreement in United States v. City of Portland, Case No. 3:12-cv-02265-SI (D. Or. \n16  2012), as well as recent injunctions in Don’t Shoot Portland v. City of Portland, Case No. 3:20-\n17  cv-00917-HZ (D. Or. 2020) and Index Newspapers LLC v. City of Portland, Case No. 3:20-cv-\n18  01035-SI (D. Or. 2020). \n19  217.  Plaintiff  City  of  Oakland’s  police  department  operates  under  a  longstanding \n20  Negotiated Settlement Agreement in Delphine Allen. v. City of Oakland, Master Case File No. \n21  C00-4599-TEH (N.D. Cal. 2012), as well as under a recent injunction in Anti Police-Terror Project \n22  v. City of Oakland, Case No. 20-cv-03866-JCS (N.D. Cal. 2020). \n23  218.  Collectively,  these  various  court  orders  bind  Plaintiffs’  police  departments’ \n24  activities, including governing many of their policies, practices, and procedures, and limiting their \n25  use of various forms of force.  \n26  219.  Under the Policy, as carried out in, at a minimum, Portland, Defendants used arrest \n27  techniques, force, and surveillance that would facially violate Plaintiffs’ federal court orders. \n28 \n- 36 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 37 of 48\n \n \n1  220.  Plaintiff City of Oakland would face the same bind if any deployments are sent to \n2  Oakland under the Policy.   \n3  221.  There is a reasonable likelihood that Defendants will, under the Policy, deploy \n4  federal agents to Plaintiff Cities, either for the first known time or again to Plaintiffs already having \n5  experienced or experiencing such deployments, as Defendants and President Trump continue and \n6  are increasing such threats. \n7    Loss of Use and Enjoyment of Public Facilities \n8  222.  Portland has provided bike and vehicle lanes in its right-of-way on Main Street. \n9  223.  FPS’s fence and barriers, erected without permission, prevent the use of enjoyment \n10  of this public land by Portland and its residents. See Gingery v. City of Glendale, 831 F.3d 1222, \n11  1227 (9th Cir. 2016).  \n12    Loss of Legislative Prerogative \n13  224.  Plaintiff City of Portland shares in Oregon’s sovereign general police power to \n14  provide for the health and safety of its residents. \n15  225.  The federal government’s commandeering of Portland law enforcement, complete \n16  once Defendants DOJ and Barr refused to cancel the deputation of the PPB officers, presses these \n17  officers into service in disregard of the City’s own legislative and enforcement priorities.  \n18  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n19  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n20  (Administrative Procedure Act—Action Not in Accordance with the Law)  \n21  (Against All Defendants) \n22  (5 U.S.C. § 706) \n23  226.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \n24  paragraphs of this Complaint.  \n25  227.  Under the APA, courts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is not \n26  in accordance with law, in excess of statutory authority, contrary to constitutional right, or without \n27  observance of procedure required by law. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n28 \n- 37 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 38 of 48\n \n \n1  228.  Defendants may only exercise authority conferred by statute. City of Arlington v. \n2  FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 297-98 (2013).  \n3  229.  Defendants’ Policy is “final agency action” under the APA because it is fairly \n4  characterized as Defendants’ final word on the matter and has legal consequences for Plaintiffs’ \n5  resident protestors during civil protests, as well as, independently, for Plaintiffs facing economic \n6  harms and federal encroachment on police powers and the “take over” of their jurisdictions. See \n7  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., Inc., 136 S. Ct. 1807, 1813 (2016) (quoting Bennett \n8  v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997)); see also New York v. U.S. Immigration & Customs \n9  Enforcement, 431 F. Supp. 3d 377, 386-88 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). \n10  230.  Agency action need not be in writing, or ever known to the public, to be judicially \n11  reviewable as “final” action. See Aracely, R. v. Nielsen, 319 F. Supp. 3d 110, 138-39 (D.D.C. \n12  2018); Wagafe v. Trump, 2017 WL 2671254, at *1, *10 (W.D. Wash. 2017); Venetian Casino \n13  Resort, LLC v. EEOC, 530 F.3d 925, 931 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (concluding that “the record” as a whole \n14  “leaves no doubt” that a policy exists, even though “the details ... are still unclear”).  \n15  231.  Furthermore, each instance where Defendants, through their officers, employees, \n16  and  agents,  directly  or  constructively,  unlawfully  deployed  or  commanded  federal  law \n17  enforcement to act in excess of or contrary to law constitutes “final agency action” under the APA. \n18  232.  40 U.S.C. § 1315(b)(1) allows the Secretary of DHS to designate certain federal \n19  employees “as officers and agents for duty in connection with the protection of property owned or \n20  occupied by the Federal Government and persons on the property, including duty in areas outside \n21  the property to the extent necessary to protect the property and persons on the property.” These \n22  authorized duties include enforcing federal laws, making arrests if federal crimes are committed \n23  in the presence of an officer, and conducting investigations on and off the property for crimes \n24  against the property or persons on the property.  \n25  233.  40 U.S.C. § 1315(d)(3) further allows the Secretary to “utilize the facilities and \n26  services of Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies, with the consent of the agencies.” \n27  234.  40 U.S.C. § 1315(e) also allows the Secretary to “enter into agreements with \n28  Federal agencies and with State and local governments to obtain authority for officers and agents \n- 38 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 39 of 48\n \n \n1  designated under this section to enforce Federal laws and State and local laws concurrently with \n2  other Federal law enforcement officers and with State and local law enforcement officers” “[]for \n3  the protection of property owned or occupied by the Federal Government and persons on the \n4  property.”  \n5  235.  These statutory provisions do not authorize the designation of  employees for \n6  general law enforcement purposes in domestic United States cities where the intent, mission, and \n7  purpose  of  the  designation  is  not  reasonably  connected  to  such  federally  stated  interests. \n8  Significantly, 40 U.S.C. § 1315 does not represent Congressional authorization to suppress \n9  insurrections under the Militia Clause.  See U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 15. \n10  236.  Further,  these  statutory  provisions  do  not  authorize  the  expansion  of  federal \n11  property into City- or State-owned rights-of-way, or the takeover of City property for federal \n12  purposes, without the consent of the non-federal agencies, as Defendants assert.  \n13  237.  The Policy therefore oversteps the constitutional limitations on the federal police \n14  powers, including as enumerated in the Militia Clause, the Republican Form of Government \n15  Clause, and the Tenth Amendment, and is not in accordance with and exceeds Defendants’ \n16  authority under 40 U.S.C. § 1315 because it (a) authorizes the designation of such agents to quell \n17  civil protests and surveil and engage with threats to damage or destroy any public monument, \n18  memorial, or statue, and (b) authorizes the expansion of federal physical boundaries and the take-\n19  over of City rights-of-way for the purposes of securing federal property, without the express \n20  consent of the City. \n21  238.  Defendants’ unlawful actions have caused, are causing, and will continue to cause \n22  harm to Plaintiffs as alleged above, and there is a substantial likelihood that the requested relief \n23  will redress this harm. \n24  // \n25  // \n26  // \n27  // \n28  // \n- 39 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 40 of 48\n \n \n1  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2  (Administrative Procedure Act—Arbitrary and Capricious) \n3  (Against All Defendants) \n4  (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)) \n5  239.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \n6  paragraphs of this Complaint.  \n7  240.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) provides that a court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency \n8  action found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \n9  law. \n10  241.  Long-established principles of federalism, paired with congressional limitations, \n11  restrict the ability of the federal government to unilaterally deploy domestic military or police \n12  interventions.  \n13  242.  Defendants have adopted a Policy to circumvent these limitations and deploy \n14  federal agents to quash civil protests, while publicly justifying the actions in the name of federal \n15  property protection. The motivation animating Defendants’ Policy is the “takeover” of City police \n16  forces and powers, and is untethered to strictly federal interests or activities.   \n17  243.  Defendants’ purported justification for the Policy is wholly pretextual and, thus, \n18  arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. \n19  244.  In enacting the Policy, Defendants have also acted arbitrarily and capriciously \n20  because Defendants did not fully consider the foreseeable harms of their policy and did not \n21  adequately explain the decision-making rationale behind the policy change, beyond a pretextual \n22  rationale.  \n23  245.  In implementing the Policy, Defendants failed to consider, among many things, \n24  the direct and destructive impacts on local governments in their administration of general public \n25  safety, and the aforementioned harms that have and will flow to Plaintiffs.   \n26  246.  Defendants’ unlawful action has caused, is causing, and will continue to cause \n27  harm to Plaintiffs as alleged above, and there is a substantial likelihood that the requested relief \n28  will redress this harm. \n- 40 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 41 of 48\n \n \n1  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2  (Federal Vacancies Reform Act; Homeland Security Act) \n3  (Against Defendant Wolf) \n4  (5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq.; 6 U.S.C. § 113) \n5  247.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \n6  paragraphs of this Complaint.  \n7  248.  The Secretary of Homeland Security may be appointed by the President only with \n8  the advice and consent of the Senate, 6 U.S.C. § 112(a)(1), and when the Office of the Secretary \n9  is vacant, the order of succession is governed by the FVRA and/or the HSA. \n10  249.  Under those authorities, Defendant Wolf is not legally authorized to hold the \n11  position of Acting Secretary. \n12  250.  Under those authorities, Defendant Wolf is not legally authorized to perform the \n13  duties and functions of the Secretary of Homeland Security. \n14  251.  Because Defendant Wolf is without legal authority to hold his position or to \n15  perform its duties or functions, any contributions he made to the Policy or steps he took or is taking \n16  to enact or enforce the Policy “shall have no force or effect,” 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(1), “may not be \n17  ratified,” id. § 3348(d)(2), and must be set aside. \n18  FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n19  (Administrative Procedure Act—In Excess of Authority) \n20  (Against Defendant Wolf) \n21  (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)) \n22  252.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \n23  paragraphs of this Complaint.  \n24  253.  Because Defendant Wolf is not legally authorized to hold the position of Acting \n25  Secretary, any action he took to contribute to, direct, revise, promulgate, enact, or enforce the \n26  Policy is “in excess of authority” under the APA and therefore must be held to be unlawful and set \n27  aside. \n28  // \n- 41 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 42 of 48\n \n \n1  FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2  (Administrative Procedure Act—Not in Accordance with Law) \n3  (Against Defendant Wolf) \n4  (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)) \n5  254.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \n6  paragraphs of this Complaint.  \n7  255.  Because Defendant Wolf is not legally authorized to hold the position of Acting \n8  Secretary, any action he took to contribute to, direct, revise, promulgate, enact, or enforce the \n9  Policy is “not in accordance with law” under the APA and therefore must be held to be unlawful \n10  and set aside. \n11  SIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n12  (Anti-Commandeering) \n13  (Plaintiff City of Portland Against Defendants Barr and DOJ) \n14  (U.S. Const., amend. X) \n15  256.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \n16  paragraphs of this Complaint. \n17  257.  The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution preserves the states’ \n18  historic,  sovereign,  and  fundamental  autonomy  to  regulate  their  own  affairs,  including  and \n19  especially the operations of their state and local governments.   \n20  258.  General police powers are among those reserved to the States. “A state’s ability to \n21  regulate its internal law enforcement activities is a quintessential police power.”  United States v. \n22  California, 921 F.3d 865, 887 n.11 (9th Cir. 2019), cert. denied, 2020 WL 3146844 (June 15, \n23  2020). \n24  259.  States are permitted to delegate their police powers to their municipalities. “[T]he \n25  delegated power of municipalities is as broad as the police power of the state, except as that power \n26  may be restricted by terms of the grant or by the state constitution.” D.C. v. John R. Thompson \n27  Co., 346 U.S. 100, 109 (1953). \n28 \n- 42 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 43 of 48\n \n \n1  260.  Oregon has so delegated its police power to its municipalities, which include the \n2  City of Portland. Article XI, section 2 of the Oregon Constitution grants the “legal voters of every \n3  city and town . . . power to enact and amend their municipal charter, subject to the Constitution \n4  and criminal laws of the State of Oregon.” Portland’s charter identifies its power and authority to \n5  exercise within the City and City-owned property “all the powers commonly known as the police \n6  power to the same extent as the State of Oregon has or could exercise said power within said areas, \n7  and to make and enforce within said areas all necessary or appropriate . . . police . . . and safety \n8  laws and regulations.”  Portland City Charter § 2-105. \n9  261.  The USMS’s refusal to honor the cancellation of the deputation of PPB’s officers, \n10  by and through Defendants Barr and DOJ, commandeers a key Portland law enforcement agency \n11  and unduly interferes with Portland’s police functions as delegated to it by the State of Oregon, in \n12  violation of the Tenth Amendment. This Practice unconstitutionally infringes on Portland’s \n13  authority to determine the status and deputation of PPB’s officers, and unconstitutionally compels \n14  PPB’s officers to continue to serve under the force and guise of federal law.  \n15  262.  Defendants DOJ and Barr have violated the authority of Portland to control and \n16  direct its own police officers and, in doing so, have caused confusion regarding the role and \n17  authority of deputized PPB officers and any legal obligations of these officers to execute orders \n18  issued under the authority of the United States. \n19  263.  The violation caused by Defendants DOJ and Barr causes ongoing harm to Portland \n20  and its residents. \n21  SEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n22  (Declaratory Judgment Act) \n23  (Against All Defendants) \n24  (28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202) \n25  264.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the preceding \n26  paragraphs of this Complaint. \n27  265.  The Policy oversteps the constitutional limitations on the federal police powers, \n28  including as enumerated in the Militia Clause, the Republican Form of Government Clause, and \n- 43 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 44 of 48\n \n \n1  the Tenth Amendment, and is not in accordance with and exceeds Defendants’ authority under 40 \n2  U.S.C. § 1315 because it: (a) authorizes the designation of such agents to quell civil protests and \n3  surveil and engage with threats to damage or destroy any public monument, memorial, or statue; \n4  and (b) authorizes the expansion of federal physical boundaries and the take-over of City rights-\n5  of-way for the purposes of securing federal property, without the express consent of the City. \n6  266.  Defendants’ purported justification for the Policy is wholly pretextual and, thus, \n7  arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. \n8  267.  In enacting the Policy, Defendants have also acted arbitrarily and capriciously \n9  because Defendants did not fully consider the foreseeable harms of their policy and did not \n10  adequately explain the decision-making rationale behind the policy change, beyond a pretextual \n11  rationale.  \n12  268.  Because Defendant Wolf is without legal authority to hold his position or to \n13  perform its duties or functions, any contributions he made to the Policy or steps he took or is taking \n14  to enact or enforce the Policy “shall have no force or effect,” 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(1), “may not be \n15  ratified,” id. § 3348(d)(2), and must be set aside. \n16  269.  Because Defendant Wolf is not legally authorized to hold the position of Acting \n17  Secretary, any action he took to contribute to, direct, revise, promulgate, enact, or enforce the \n18  Policy is “in excess of authority” under the APA and therefore must be held to be unlawful and set \n19  aside. \n20  270.  Because Defendant Wolf is not legally authorized to hold the position of Acting \n21  Secretary, any action he took to contribute to, direct, revise, promulgate, enact, or enforce the \n22  Policy is “not in accordance with law” under the APA and therefore must be held to be unlawful \n23  and set aside. \n24  271.  An  actual,  present,  and  justiciable  controversy  exists  between  Plaintiffs  and \n25  Defendants concerning the legality of the Policy and regarding whether Defendant Wolf has legal \n26  authority to hold his position or perform its duties or functions.  \n27  272.  Plaintiffs seeks a declaratory judgment from this Court that the Policy is not in \n28  accordance with law, in excess of statutory authority, contrary to constitutional right, or without \n- 44 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 45 of 48\n \n \n1  observance of procedure required by law pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2); that the Policy is arbitrary, \n2  capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law within the meaning of \n3  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); that Defendant Wolf is without legal authority to hold his position or to \n4  perform its duties or functions; and that aspects of the Policy promulgated under the purported \n5  authority of Defendant Wolf must be set aside and/or enjoined. \n6  273.  Defendants DOJ and Barr have unduly interfered with Portland’s police functions \n7  as delegated to it by the State of Oregon, in violation of the Tenth Amendment, by refusing to \n8  cancel the deputation of the PPB officers at Portland’s request. \n9  274.  An  actual,  present,  and  justiciable  controversy  exists  between  Portland  and \n10  Defendants DOJ and Barr concerning the constitutionality of Defendants’ refusal to cancel the \n11  deputation. \n12  275.  Portland seeks a declaratory judgment from this Court that Defendant DOJ’s and \n13  Defendant Barr’s refusal to cancel the deputation of PPB officers is violative of the Tenth \n14  Amendment and the anti-commandeering doctrine. \n15   \n16  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n17    Wherefore, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \n18  1.  Issue an order holding unlawful, vacating, and setting aside Defendants’ Policy;   \n19  2.  Declare that the Policy is not in accordance with law, in excess of statutory \n20  authority, contrary to constitutional right, or without observance of procedure required by law \n21  pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2); \n22  3.  Declare that the Policy is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n23  otherwise not in accordance with law within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A);  \n24  4.  Declare that aspects of the Policy promulgated under the purported authority of \n25  Defendant Wolf must be set aside and/or enjoined; \n26  5.  Declare that Defendant DOJ’s and Defendant Barr’s commandeering of local law \n27  enforcement is unlawful under the Tenth Amendment and order them to immediately \n28  cancel the at-issue deputation of PPB officers; \n- 45 - \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:20-cv-07184-SK   Document 1   Filed 10/14/20   Page 46 of 48\n \n \n1  6.
