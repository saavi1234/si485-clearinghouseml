    "summary": "<p>On September 7, 2016, the <i>New York Times</i> and one of its reporters specializing in national security issues filed a complaint under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552 (the Freedom of Information Act) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The complaint alleged that the reporter properly filed Freedom of Information (FOIA) requests with the DOJ for three documents related to counterterrorism issues, that the DOJ had not provided the requested documents in a timely manner, and that the Court should compel the DOJ to release the records at issue. Judge Lewis Kaplan presided over the case.</p><p>The documents that the reporter sought and the status of the requests at the time of complaint are below: <ul> <li>the reporter initially submitted a FOIA request for the final reports by the Special Interagency Task Force on Detainee Disposition established by Executive Order 13,493 and the Special Interagency Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer Policies established by Executive Order 13,491 to the DOJ on October 28, 2015.</li> <li>the reporter initially submitted a FOIA request for a May 4, 2005 memo on discovery issues presented by the Stellarwind warrantless wiretapping and bulk data collection program on January 7, 2016.</li> <li>the reporter initially submitted an identical FOIA request to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the DOJ for unreleased documents from Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) Judge John Bates' redacted docket that yielded publicized opinions on October 3 and November 3 of 2011 on May 10, 2016 (the original case is available in <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14043\">this Clearinghouse</a>). These requests sought information on the widely-cited statistics on the National Security Agency's (NSA) upstream internet surveillance program, and the 2008 version of the FBI's standard minimization procedures for data collection.</li> </ul>The government filed a response acknowledging receipt of the brief and the various FOIA requests, but alleged that the government was cooperating in the FOIA records request and no legal action was necessary on October 11, 2016.</p><p>Outside of the court, the parties agreed to a document release schedule, and submitted a schedule for document release on March 1, 2017. The schedule was not publicized, though the docket shows that release dates for a few of the documents were slightly altered over the course of the year. On October 11, 2017, the plaintiffs submitted a status report to the court showing that the parties cooperated in releasing the requested documents. Judge Kaplan dismissed the case on October 26, 2017; it is now closed.</p><p>The released documents provided important context to frequently cited surveillance and interrogation information, while leaving other important questions unanswered. A brief summary of the collected documents is available below:<ul> <li>For the Special Interagency Task Force on Interrogation reports, the reporter found examples of three new areas of information not previously publicized. The first noted that Obama-era officials asked the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) if it wanted to use anything other than the Army Field Manual detention policies, and the CIA did not suggest an alternative. Second, it added that the CIA maintained a policy of transferring detainees to countries where they might be abused on a case-by-case basis. Third, it noted that the CIA maintained policies allowing for prisoner separation in detention centers, which previously had been used to authorize torture techniques like sleep deprivation.</li><li>For the Stellarwind bulk collection discovery memo, the unredacted sections of the documents did not provide a clear policy for when the Justice Department needs to turn over classified information to a defendant in a terrorism case, in line with <i>Brady</i> prosecutorial standards. However, the memo did note that this is an issue that the DOJ needs to grapple with in the future.</li> <li>For the 2008 FBI Standard Minimization Procedures, the reporter found that it allowed the FBI to search for evidence of an ordinary crime in the warrantless surveillance repository.</li> <li>Finally, the 2011 FISC documents confirmed that Judge Bates' frequently cited statistic that nine percent of all internet communications picked up by the NSA came through the upstream surveillance program, which pulled its information from internet switchboards rather than email accounts, may be misleading. The released documents showed that the NSA referred to \"communication\" and \"transaction\" interchangeably, and that one transaction can contain multiple internet communications, like emails. As a result, the nine percent provided by Judge Bates could be a larger or smaller percentage depending on how many bits of internet communication were picked up in each \"transaction.\" The released documents demonstrated that some of these upstream communications contained information from purely domestic servers, though it was a small percentage.</li> </ul></p>",

The parties amicably agreed to a document release schedule, and the case closed on October 26, 2017. Of interest in the released documents is the revelation that the government may have been collecting different percentages of communications through upstream surveillance than previously believed.",

      "title": "Report of the Special Task Force of Interrogation and Transfer Policies",
      "text": "REPORT OF THE SPECIAL TASK FORCE \n\nON INTERROGATION AND TRANSFER POLICIES \n\n\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY \nExecutive Order 13491 directed the Special Task Force on Interrogation and \nTransfer Policies to undertake two missions: (1) \"to study and evaluate whether the \ninterrogation practices and techniques in Army Field Manual 2-22.3, when employed by \ndepartments and agencies outside the military, provide an appropriate means of acquiring \nthe intelligence necessary to protect the Nation, and, if warranted, to recommend any \nadditional or different guidance for other departments or agencies\"; and (2) \"to study and \nevaluate the practices of transferring individuals to other nations in order to ensure that \nsuch practices comply with the domestic laws, international obligations, and policies of \nthe United States and do not result in the transfer of individuals to other nations to face \ntorture or otherwise for the purpose, or with the effect, of undermining or circumventing \nthe commitments or obligations of the United States to ensure the humane treatment of \nindividuals in its custody and control.\" 1 \nThe Task Force established an Interrogation Working Group to address the first \nmission, and a Transfer Working Group to address the second mission.  After meeting \nwith agencies of the United States government, foreign officials, and representatives of \nnon-governmental organizations, the Task Force reached a series of conclusions and \nformulated a set of recommendations relating to interrogation and transfer policy.  These \nrecommendations should be coordinated and integrated with those ofthe Detention \nPolicy Task Force. \nInterrogation: \nGeneral Conclusions \nThe Task Force's mission was to determine whether any agency other than the \nmilitary should be authorized to use any interrogation practice or technique not listed in \nArmy Field Manual 2-22.3 (the \"Army Field Manual\" or \"Manual\") in order to protect \nnational security.  The Task Force could not undertake that task in a vacuum, however, \nand therefore asked federal law enforcement and Intelligence Community agencies to \nnominate interrogation practices and techniques for consideration.  No federal agency \ninformed the Task Force that it believed that it was necessary or appropriate to national \nsecurity to use any interrogation practice or technique not listed in the Army Field \nManual or currently used by law enforcement.  ill particular, the Central Intelligence \nAgency (CIA) informed the Task Force that it did not seek to use the enhanced \ninterrogation techniques it had developed after September 11, 2001, to question highยญ\nvalue detainees.  The President has also announced that the United States would no \nlonger use those techniques.  Accordingly, although there may be some lawful and \neffective interrogation practices and techniques that are not listed in the Army Field \nManual or currently used by law enforcement agencies, the Task Force did not consider \nwhether it was appropriate or legal for any agency of the federal government to use any \nspecific technique not contained in the Army Field Manual. \n1 Executive Order 13491 is attached as Appendix A. \n\nNevertheless, the Task Force studied U.S. interrogation practices as extensively as \ntime would allow.  Based on that study, it reached the following conclusions: \nโข \t The Army Field Manual's description ofpermissible interrogation \n\npractices and techniques provides appropriate guidance to both \n\ninexperienced and experienced military interrogators. \n\nโข \t Experienced intelligence and law enforcement interrogators do not rely \nsolely on particular interrogation techniques but instead develop lawful \ninterrogation strategies based on extensive knowledge of the detainee and \nhis organization, guile and deception, the use of incentives, and other \nfactors. \nโข \t Experienced interrogators believe that the separation of a high-value \ndetainee from other detainees is often essential to effective interrogation \nand that the U.S. government should maintain a detention capability that \nallows control of the detention environment to support intelligence \ncollection.  The legal, policy, and oversight questions raised by the \nestablishment of a detention facility in the U.S. or abroad are beyond the \nTask Force's mandate, however, and are currently under consideration by \nthe Detention Policy Task Force. \nโข \t To train effective interrogators, the United States must give its \n\ninterrogators opportunities and incentives to gain experience in \n\ninterrogation, not simply train them in interrogation techniques. \n\nโข \t The Army Field Manual imposes appropriate limits on interrogation. \nAmong other things, the Manual bans cruel, inhuman, or degrading \ntreatment, outlaws several specific interrogation practices, and bars \ninterrogators from using any interrogation technique that they would not \nwish to see used on a United States citizen. \nโข \t Additional research is needed on the science of interrogation and the \npotential to develop new and more effective lawful interrogation practices, \napproaches, and strategies, particularly interrogation techniques that have \nthe potential to obtain information as efficiently as possible in situations \nposing the greatest threats to national security. \nRecommendations \nThe Task Force also formulated four specific recommendations: \n1.  Create a High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group (HIG): The \nTask Force recommends the creation of an interagency group that would deploy \ninterrogation teams composed of interrogators, subject matter experts, analysts, \nbehavioral specialists, and linguists to conduct interrogations of high-value \n2 \n\n\nterrorist detainees.  The HIG's primary goal would be the collection of \nintelligence to protect national security.  Where possible and consistent with this \nobjective, it should collect intelligence in a manner that allows it to be used as \nevidence in a criminal prosecution. \n2.  Increase Intelligence Community and Law Enforcement \nCooperation: Determining whether any given interrogation should seek only the \ncollection of intelligence or a statement that could potentially be used against the \ndetainee in a criminal prosecution should be a pragmatic decision based on the \nneeds of national security, and not the interests or goals of a particular agency. \nOne purpose of the HIG would be to ensure that that decision is made pursuant to \nsettled, consistently applied criteria.  Those criteria would make clear that an \ninterrogation of a high-value detainee would be primarily to collect intelligence \nnecessary to protect national security and, where possible and consistent with this \nobjective, to gather information to be used in a criminal prosecution.  Of course, \nthose goals are not mutually exclusive and should be pursued in tandem whenever \npossible. \n3.  Establish and Disseminate Best Practices: Ifcreated, a High-Value \nDetainee Interrogation Group will develop a set of best practices for interrogation. \nThe HIG should identify and disseminate those best practices and use them to \nconduct training for other agencies engaged in interrogation. \n4.  Establish a Scientific Research Program for Interrogation: Prior to \nthe September 11 attacks, the United States had not engaged in a systematic effort \nto study and improve interrogation techniques in nearly 50 years.  Although some \nresources have been devoted to studying interrogation since September 11, the \nUnited States should engage in a concerted effort to study the effectiveness and \npropriety of existing interrogation practices, techniques, and strategies and should \ntry to develop new ones that meet the requirements of domestic law and the \nUnited States obligations under international law.  Resources should be devoted \nboth within the U.S. government and in academic and research institutions to \nfurther this goal. \n3 \n\n\nTransfer: \nGeneral Conclusions \nThe Task Force identified and considered seven types oftransfers conducted by \nthe U.S. government:2  (1) extradition, (2) transfers pursuant to immigration proceedings, \n(3) transfers pursuant to the Geneva Conventions, (4 ) transfers from the Guantanamo Bay \ndetention facility, (5) military transfers within or from Afghanistan, (6) military transfers \nwithin or from Iraq, and (7) transfers pursuant to intelligence authorities.  The Task Force \ndid not consider transfers into U.S. custody or transfers within U.S. custody to be part of \nits mandate under the Executive Order. \nThe Task Force began by identifying the legal and policy framework within \nwhich the seven categories oftransfers take place.  As a legal matter, the United States \nhas taken the view that it is barred from transferring an individual from its territory where \nit is more likely than not that the person will be tortured by the country to which he is \ntransferred.  As a policy matter, the United States has applied the same standard to \nwholly extraterritorial transfers.  The Task Force also examined U.S. policies and \npractices with respect to obtaining and evaluating assurances from other countries that \nthey will not torture a person transferred from the United States. \nThe Task Force carefully considered the key criticisms of U.S. transfer practices, \nas well as the operational and policy interests that are served by existing practices.  The \nTask Force concluded that, while the seven identified transfer scenarios present strikingly \ndifferent considerations, important U.S. national security interests are at stake in all of \nthem.  Particularly (but not exclusively) in the area of counterterrorism, transfers are an \nimportant tool for the United States in situations where U.S. prosecution or detention is \nnot available, but where an individual may present a real danger or have significant \nintelligence value.  Accordingly, proposed changes to existing practice must be \ndeveloped in a manner that permits the continued use oftransfers consistent with relevant \nhumanitarian considerations.  Operating within the framework ofthis general conclusion, \nthe Task Force considered what steps could be taken to better ensure that U.S. transfer \npractices comply with all relevant domestic laws and policies and all relevant \ninternational obligations. \nRecommendations \nThe Task Force formulated a number ofrecommendations, some ofwhich apply \nto all of the transfer scenarios and some of which are specific to particular transfer \nscenarios: \n2 In this report, the Task Force has used the term \"transfer\" to describe a variety of different scenarios in \nwhich the United States moves or facilitates the movement of a person from one country to another or from \nU.S. custody to the custody of another country.  The report does not use the term \"rendition\" because that \nterm has no generally agreed-upon meaning. \n4 \n\n\n1.  Improving Assurances:  The Task Force makes several \nrecommendations aimed at clarifying and strengthening U.S. procedures for \nobtaining and evaluating assurances and increasing the use of monitoring \nmechanisms to implement assurances. \n2.  Improving partner nation detention facilities and capabilities:  In \nconsidering recommendations on correctional assistance, the Detention Policy \nTask Force should take into account that the potential for transfers is increased by \nbetter facilities in partner nations, particularly in the Middle East and South and \nSoutheast Asia. \n3.  Amending Department ofHomeland Security regulations:  The \nTask Force recommends changes to the applicable regulations to reflect the shift \nin responsibility for evaluating diplomatic assurances from the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service under the Department of Justice to the Department of \nHomeland Security. \n4.  Monitoring ISAF detainees in Afghanistan:  The Task Force \nrecommends that the U.S. Embassy in Kabul should develop a risk mitigation \nplan to improve monitoring of the treatment of detainees transferred by U.S. \nmembers of the International Security Assistance Force to the Islamic Republic of \nAfghanistan, taking into account resource and other practical concerns. \n5.  Providing comprehensive assistance to develop detention facilities \nin areas where large numbers ofdetainee transfers are expected:  The Task Force \nrecommends using certain aspects of the U.S. experience with the Afghan \nNational Detention Facility as a model in current and future conflicts where the \nUnited States expects to capture a significant number of detainees, and plans \neventually to transfer them to the host government. \n6.  Negotiating assurances with host governments in future conflicts: \nThe Task Force recommends that, in the future, where it appears likely that the \nDepartment of Defense will hold and ultimately seek to transfer significant \nnumbers of detainees to a host state, the Department of Defense, in cooperation \nwith the Department of State, should negotiate assurances with the host \ngovernment to govern the treatment of transferred detainees at as early a stage in \nthe process as possible. \n7.  Establishing Department ofDefense policies or directives:  The \nTask Force recommends that the Department of Defense should adopt policies or \ndirectives governing transfers consistent with the policy statement in section \n2242(a) of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (codified at \n8 U.S.C. ยง 1231 note) (\"FARRA\"). \n8.  Establishing Intelligence Community policies or directives:  The \nTask Force recommends that elements of the Intelligence Community that may be \ncalled upon to conduct or participate in transfers should adopt policies or \n5 \n\n\ndirectives governing transfers consistent with the policy statement in section \n2242(a) of the FARRA. \n9.  Additional recommendations applicable to the Intelligence Community: \nThe Task Force formulated three additional recommendations applicable to \npotential transfers conducted pursuant to intelligence authorities that are \ncontained in a classified annex to the Task Force's report. \nINTERROGATION \nIn light of the President's decision to prohibit the use of enhanced or coercive \n\ninterrogation techniques used by the CIA, the Task Force broadened its mission to focus \n\non ways to improve the United States' ability to interrogate high-value detainees.  The \n\nTask Force's recommendations are as follows: \n\n1.  Establish a High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group \nThe United States government should establish and maintain a High-Value \nDetainee Interrogation Group for intelligence collection, bringing together the best \ninterrogators and support personnel from the Intelligence Community, the Department of \nDefense, and law enforcement. \nTo ensure that the best available interrogation resources are directed against the \nnation's most high-value counterterrorism detainees, the Task Force proposes \nestablishing a multi-agency High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group (RIG) that would \nuse the best capabilities of intelligence and law enforcement, as well as allied military \nand civilian interrogation operations, with a focus on those interrogation practices and \nprocedures that produce timely, reliable, and actionable results.  The RIG would be a \njoint intelligence and law enforcement entity under the administrative control of the FBI. \nSubject to guidance from the Counterterrorism Security Group and based on pre-existing \ncriteria, as well as information obtained from the Intelligence Community, the RIG \nwould prepare to conduct interrogations by identifying individuals who should be the \nsubjects of a specialized interrogation capability if detained by the U.S. government or \notherwise become available for interrogation.  Using the same process, the RIG would \nprepare to interrogate currently unknown members of specific terrorist organizations if \nthey become available for interrogation.  The RIG would coordinate the creation, and \nsupervise the training, of Mobile Interrogation Teams (MITs) to conduct interrogations of \nthe identified individuals, members of terrorist groups, or others who met its deployment \ncriteria.  The MITs would consist of experienced interrogators, subject matter experts, \nanalysts, behavioral specialists, linguists, and others.  The MITs would ordinarily deploy \n. when the U.S. government detained or otherwise obtained the ability to interrogate a \nperson who met the HIG's deployment criteria, subject to limitations described in the \nclassified annex to this report.  The deployment of a MIT would be subject to the \napproval of the Chief of Mission for the country in which the MIT would deploy and, \nwhen the detainee is in Department of Defense custody, the approval of the responsible \ngeographic combatant commander.  The RIG would also supervise the development of \nnew methodologies for effective interrogation. \n6 \n\n\nThe HIG's priority would be intelligence collection to prevent terrorist attacks on \nthe United States and its allies and otherwise protect national security.  Evidence \ncollection for prosecution (which may also protect national security) would remain an \nimportant consideration, and steps should be taken to ensure that intelligence collection \nproceeds in a manner that does not limit future law enforcement options.  In cases where \nthe interests of intelligence collection and preservation of evidence diverge, collecting \nintelligence,to prevent a future attack would take precedence.  Accordingly, use ofthe \nMITs would not carry a presumption that the detainee should be prosecuted in a criminal \ncourt in the United States or that Miranda warnings should be given during the \ninterrogation. \nOrganization: The Task Force considered three organizational models for the \nHIG: ( 1) a free-standing interrogation capability; (2) a \"federated\" model in which the \nHIG would be organized with resources from across the U.S. government on a case-byยญ\ncase basis; and (3) a \"hybrid\" model involving a small permanent nucleus of people \nmodeled on the Foreign Emergency Support Team (FEST) and augmented on a case-byยญ\ncase basis for individual deployments.  The Task Force recommends the third, or hybrid, \nmodel.  This small group would be drawn from agencies in the Intelligence Community \nand would be responsible for maintaining training and exercise programs, the \nadministrative aspects of deployments, and managing an overall research program.  This \napproach should provide greater stability and clarity of operational authority than the \nfederated model, while maintaining flexibility by keeping resources in individual \nagencies. \nUnder the hybrid model, individual agencies would be expected to establish and \nmaintain minimum standards of training for individuals who are serving in the HIG or \nwho are identified to deploy in a MIT.  Agencies would also be expected to participate \nfully in the development and implementation of the HIG concept.  The HIG \nadministrative office would be responsible for the following activities with guidance and \ndirection from the National Security Council's Counterterrorism Security Group: \nโข \t Managing the MIT interrogation program; \nโข \t Establishing interrogation priorities for the MITs; \nโข \t Developing policy, doctrine, and procedures for interrogations of high-value \ndetainees; \nโข \t Based on information obtained from the Intelligence Community, identifying \nhigh-value detainees subject to interrogation if detained by the U.S. \ngovernment or otherwise available for interrogation; \nโข \t Deploying MITs to interrogate high-value detainees who are on the HIG list \nor meet the HIG's criteria; \n7 \n\n\nโข \t Ensuring that a participant in the interrogation is prepared to testify if a \ndetermination is made that United States prosecution is a possible objective \nfor disposition ofthe detainee; \nโข \t Setting and enforcing interrogation and training standards for the MITs; \nโข \t Conducting exercises to strengthen HIG collaboration and cooperation and \nensure smooth support to future operations; \nโข \t Sponsoring and coordinating interrogation research activities; and \nโข \t Disseminating research results to the U.S. government interrogation \ncommunity. \nWhile the HIG would provide the strategic and administrative backbone for the effort, \nother Intelligence Community and law enforcement agencies would provide operational \ncapability, training, and research support. \nGovernance: The Task Force recommends that the HIG be subject to the \nadministrative supervision and control of a single agency.  After evaluating potential \nagencies, the Task Force recommends that the FBI serve as the administrative \nheadquarters for this multi-agency effort.  Although other agencies also have existing \ninterrogation capabilities, logistical support for communications and transportation, or \noperational and analytical programs focused on terrorism, the Task Force concluded that \nputting the HIG within the FBI will strengthen the public perception of legal oversight of \nthe activity and dovetail with the FBI's existing intelligence and law enforcement \nprograms focused on terrorism suspects.  The recommendation is intended to align the \nHIG with the FBI's intelligence functions; it is not intended to make the FBI's law \nenforcement function the primary purpose of the HIG.  As set forth above, the HI G's \npriority would be intelligence collection to prevent terrorist attacks on the United States \nand its allies and otherwise to protect national security. \nAs an entity within the FBI, the HIG would have a chief drawn from that agency \nwho would have over-all command of the HIG and supervision of the composition, \ntraining, and deployment of the MITs.  To ensure input into the governance of the HIG \nfrom other components of the Intelligence Community, the Task Force recommends that \nits deputy should be drawn from another Intelligence Community agency.  In addition, \nthe HIG would be subject to oversight, as discussed below. \nOversight: The Task Force agreed that the HIG should be subject to oversight to \nensure appropriate policy guidance, effective interagency coordination, and compliance \nwith the rule oflaw.  The Task Force recommends that this policy and coordination \noversight should be exercised by the Counterterrorism Security Group (CSG) of the \nNational Security Council and by the NSC Deputies and Principals Committees, as \nnecessary and appropriate.  Legal issues that arise concerning compliance with U.S. \ndomestic law and international legal obligations regarding the interrogation and treatment \n8 \n\n\nof detainees will be evaluated by the Department of Justice, in coordination with \nattorneys at the relevant agencies and the NSC/White House. \nMobile Interrogation Teams: A key element ofthe HIG is the establishment of \nMobile Interrogation Teams (MITs) that would deploy to conduct interrogations ofhighยญ\nvalue detainees.  A presumption would exist that the MITs would deploy to conduct the \ninterrogation of a high-value detainee previously identified by the HIG, or who met the \nRIG's criteria, if the U.S. government detained or obtained the ability to interrogate the \nindividual.  The MITs would consist of interrogators, subject matter experts, analysts, \nbehavioral specialists, and linguists drawn from existing programs, as needed.  MIT \ninterrogators would be U.S. government employees, would have specific expertise in \ninterrogation, and would train to hone these skills and maintain current knowledge of \nterrorist groups, geographic regions, and relevant intelligence requirements.  MIT subject \nmatter experts, including law enforcement case agents and intelligence analysts with the \ngreatest knowledge of a specific detainee or a specific subject matter, and others as \nneeded, would provide detainee-specific and group-specific knowledge to the MIT during \ninterrogation.  The HIG would determine MIT membership for individual deployments \nbased on available personnel from Intelligence Community and law enforcement \nagencies. \nIndividual agencies participating in high-value detainee interrogation operations \nwould be required to: \nโข \t Establish and maintain current capabilities for interrogation; \nโข \t Train to standards set by the RIG; \nโข \t Maintain readiness to respond to RIG deployments; \nโข \t Participate fully in exercises, both operationally and administratively, as \nnecessary; \nโข \t Provide onsite command and control where required; and \nโข \t Deploy and operate in accordance with guidance and objectives set by the \nHIG and the CSG consistent with existing laws, executive orders, directives, \nand interagency agreements that govern deployment and activities of the U.~. \ngovernment executive branch employees overseas. \nThe Task Force concluded that the MITs must train and exercise together \nfrequently to be effective.  Several experienced interrogators told the Task Force that \ninterrogation is less likely to succeed when an interrogator meets a supporting analyst or \nthe interpreter immediately before an interrogation.  Training should facilitate long-term \nworking relationships and allow a MIT to develop interrogators who can work effectively \nwith an interpreter and who know they can rely on the supporting subject-matter experts \nand analysts.  In addition, by training and deploying together, MITs would develop the \n9 \n\n\nmost effective approaches to interrogation and be in the best position to provide input to \nresearchers studying ways to improve interrogation. \nThe Task Force also considered whether the HIG could operate domestically by, \nfor example, deploying an MIT to interrogate a high-value detainee or terrorism suspect \ncaptured in-the United States.  In the end, the Task Force concluded that the question \nwhether the HIG would operate domestically was outside its mission, although it believes \nthe question of domestic deployment warrants further consideration. \nLogistical and Administrative Issues: The Task Force discussed several \nother administrative and logistical issues relating to the creation ofthe HIG and \ndeployment ofMITs.  The Task Force determined, however, that these details were more \nappropriately addressed in an implementation plan. \n2. \t Increase Intelligence Community and Law Enforcement \nCooperation and Collaboration Against High-Value Detainees. \nLeverage relevant authorities and capabilities to maximize both intelligence \ncollection and potential criminal prosecution. \nWhen the U.S. government detains or obtains access to a high-value detainee, it \nmust often decide whether or not an interrogation ofthat detainee will have as an \nobjective eliciting a statement that can be used against the detainee in a criminal \nprosecution in the United States or another country.  The objectives of an interrogation \nmay affect the course ofthe interrogation and the identity ofthe interrogator.  Creating a \nconsolidated team of interrogators with a variety ofinterrogation styles and experiences \nunder unified leadership would make it possible to employ the most effective \ninterrogation strategy for individual high-value detainees.  Ideally, the MITs will know, \nin advance of deployment, the desired disposition of the detainee developed in the \ninteragency planning process - U.S. or foreign prosecution, release, long-term detention, \nor deportation - and develop an interrogation plan that is tailored to the particular \ndetainee and the desired disposition.  By evaluating the potential for and possible interest \nin criminal prosecution prior to an interrogation, the HIG, with policy guidance from the \nCSG, can make appropriate decisions regarding the composition ofthe team, the strategy \nand sequence ofthe interrogation, and other issues that may affect the ability to prosecute \nthe detainee.  All planning and training should retain a significant degree of flexibility to \naccount for the possibility of unforeseen developments in any capture and interrogation \nof a high-value detainee. \n3. \t Establish Best Practices and Disseminate Them to the \nInterrogation Community \nThe HIG should continue to develop concepts ofbest practices and disseminate \nthese to agencies that conduct interrogations. \n10 \n\n\nThe MITs will develop a set of best practices for interrogation.  Those practices \nwill include improved interrogation strategies, training regimes, and methods of \norganizing interrogation teams.  In particular, because the MITs will be on the front lines \nof interrogation and will confront some ofthe most hardened and resistant terrorist \nsuspects, they will be in the best position to develop new and effective interrogation \npractices as necessary. \nFor these reasons, the Task Force recommends that the HIG create a process for \nidentifying and cataloging best practices.  In addition, processes should be established for \ndisseminating the fruits ofthe HIG's experience to other agencies that conduct \ninterrogation.  For example, the HIG could conduct regular training for other agencies. \nThat kind of training would also allow for a healthy exchange ofideas between the HIG \nand other agencies, including law enforcement agencies. \n4. \t Establish a Scientific Research Program to Develop Improved \nTechniques and Methodologies for Interrogation \nEstablish a program and corresponding budget to oversee a comprehensive \nscientific study to research and develop more effective interrogation methodologies. \nThere is little existing scientific research assessing current interrogation \napproaches, including those listed in the Army Field Manual.  Although some research \nhas addressed the effectiveness of interviewing and interrogation techniques used by law \nenforcement agencies, the conclusions of those studies are not necessarily applicable to \nthe interrogation of high-value detainees.  Nor does the United States have a systematic \nmechanism to capture lessons learned and develop case studies on interrogation. \nTo remedy these deficiencies, a long-term research program should be established \nto develop and oversee research on interrogation.  Most Task Force members agree that \nthe HIG would be the most effective entity to manage such a program, as the HIG would \nhave the most significant substantive experience.  It would house experts dedicated to \nensuring that research is relevant and applicable to real-world interrogation.  The research \nitself would be conducted by Intelligence Community members and academic and \nresearch institutions.  The HIG should manage the study of foreign civilian and military \nintelligence and law enforcement methodologies to learn from the experience of foreign \ngovernments.  The HIG should also ensure that the research would focus on the most \ndifficult cases and issues. \nAny such program would adhere to all applicable U.S. government guidelines for \nscientific experimentation and research.  Topics of research could include the following: \nโข \t The standards and assumptions inherent in the Anny Field Manual and law \nenforcement communities; \nโข \t The comparative effectiveness of interrogation approaches and techniques, with \nthe goal of identifying the existing techniques that are most effective and \ndeveloping new lawful techniques to improve intelligence interrogations; and \n11 \n\n\nโข \t Identification of additional lawful methods of obtaining information from an \nindividual in the truncated timeframe that the United States may face in a crisis. \nResearch methods could involve the following: \nโข \t Substantive exchanges between practitioners on what worked and what did not, to \ndocument lessons learned and capture actual interrogation experiences.  Research \nshould study both successes and failures; \nโข \t Developing case studies and teaching tools for continuing education of current \ninterrogators, as well as to train new interrogators; and \nโข \t Applying social science theories to interrogation.  Studies ofrelevant subjects \nsuch as persuasion, sources ofpower, interests and identities, stress, resistances, \nand memory were identified by the Intelligence Science Board as being extremely \nrelevant to interrogation. \nDeveloping a research program and its corresponding budget would require \nsignificant resources.  The Task Force recommends that as part of the creation ofthe \nHIG, funding for such a research program should be included for future budget requests. \nTRANSFER \nTransfers ofpeople from U.S. custody to the custody of another government arise \nin a variety of contexts.  Some of these transfers arise in contexts in which the \ninternational and domestic legal framework is well-established - such as extradition. \nOther transfers, though lawful, take place in contexts in which the legal framework is less \nwell-defined.  All ofthese transfers can raise important legal and policy issues.  These \nissues relate primarily to the treatment of the person who is being transferred, but in some \nsituations also include other issues such as whether the sovereignty of the country from \nwhich or through which a transfer takes place has been respected.  Furthermore, U.S. \npolicies on transfers must be developed in conjunction with U.S. policies on \napprehension and detention, as these are inter-related elements of our counterterrorism \nefforts. \nCritics of U.S. transfer practices have expressed a number of concerns.  Some of \nthese concerns have been focused primarily on transfers reportedly conducted or \nfacilitated by elements of the Intelligence Community.  For example, some have argued \nthat the apparent lack ofprocedural protections involved in any secret transfer inevitably \nleads to cases ofmistaken identity, resulting in the transfer of innocent people against \ntheir will.  Others have expressed concerns about the lack of legal process for the \nindividuals in the host or receiving state and about the implications for the sovereign \n3 \nrights of countries from which or through which secret transfers may take place.\n3 See, e.g., \"Rendition and Secret Detention: A Global System of Human Rights Violations.\" Amnesty \nInternational.  (January 1, 2006), available at www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/po130/003/2006.  See also \nEuropean Commission for Democracy Through Law (Venice Commission) Opinion on the International \nLegal Obligations of Council ofEurope Member States in Respect of Secret Detention Facilities and Interยญ\nState Transport of Prisoners.  (March 2006). \n12 \n\n\nOne concern that has been expressed about U.S. transfer practices across the full \nrange of scenarios is whether the United States has taken adequate steps to protect against \ntorture or other forms of mistreatment after the transfer has taken place.  In particular, \none aspect of U.S. transfer practice that has come under particular scrutiny is the use of \nassurances obtained from the receiving country as a safeguard against post-transfer \nmistreatment.  Many groups have argued that assurances should never be used for this \npurpose.  Others have adv_ocated the imposition of controls on the use of assurances to \nmake them more reliable.  The groups that have taken these positions have expressed a \nnumber of concerns about the use of assurances to prevent mistreatment after transfer. \nFirst, critics of assurances point to a number of cases in which assurances appear to have \nfailed to protect individuals who have been transferred.  The Maher Arar case is \nfrequently cited by critics of U.S. transfer practices, as are a handful of Guantanamo \ntransfer cases involving Tunisia and Russia.  Such critics argue that neither the \ntransferring nor the receiving state has an incentive to report publicly that the receiving \nstate has failed to respect the assurances it provided. \nSecond, some argue that assurances are inherently untrustworthy, because a \ntransferring state would only seek assurances in cases in which it had some concern that \nthe receiving state would engage in torture.  A related point is that many of the countries \nwhere torture is a problem may be sincere in making a commitment not to torture but \nmay lack the ability to follow through on the assurance.  Third, torture is inherently \ndifficult to discover because it is almost always done in secret.  Those who engage in \ntorture may be skilled at using techniques that do not leave visible marks, and a victim of \ntorture may be afraid to report it, even if there is some monitoring of his or her case. \nAssurances, it is argued, do nothing to alleviate these problems, even if they include \nsome kind of monitoring mechanism. \nThese criticisms about U.S. transfer practices, and in particular about the use of \nassurances, raise a number of significant concerns that need to be taken into account in \nshaping U.S. policy.  However, they should be considered in light of several additional \nimportant points.  First, while concerns about assurances not being respected must be \ntaken seriously, the Task Force is unaware of any comprehensive study on state practice \nregarding implementation of and compliance with assurances.  There have also been \ncases where assurances have been used successfully.  For example, ofthe more than 550 \ndetainees transferred or released from Guantanamo, there have been only a very few \ncomplaints about treatment that violated the assurances obtained by the USG.  Thus the \nTask Force believes that the facts point toward the need for careful case-by-case \nassessments of assurances, rather than a blanket rejection of the practice.4 \n4 See also, for example, the conclusion of the UK Special Immigration Appeals Commission that, with \nregard to Algerians returned to Algeria, the \"Algerian State has fulfilled to the letter, those parts of its \nassurances to the British Government which can be conclusively verified.\" U v. SSHD 37, available at \nhttp://www.siac.tribunals.gov.uk/outcomes.htm. \n13 \n\n\nSecond, the criticism that countries willing to violate their binding obligations not \nto torture will by definition be willing to violate any non-binding bilateral assurances \nassumes that a generalized multilateral commitment is no different than a case-specific \nbilateral commitment.  This assumption does not hold true in all cases.  Particularly in ~he \ncontext of a multi-faceted bilateral relationship, a country may have a far greater \nincentive to live up to a specific bilateral assurance than to its obligations under the CAT \ngenerally.  This is particularly true where a case-specific monitoring mechanism is part of \nthe assurance. \nSome ยทhave argued that the United States should never transfer someone who \nalleges any kind of fear ofmistreatment in the receiving state.  The Task Force concluded \nthat this position was unworkable.  Without undermining credible concerns about torture \nand United States' legal obligations with respect to transfers, transfers and assurances \nmust be considered in the context of the practical reality in which transfers take place. \nMany ofthe detainees held by the United States would pose a significant threat if \nreleased into the United States, and many would be considered dangerous even if released \ninto other countries. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, only a small percentage of these \ndetainees held by the United States in recent years have been or can be prosecuted. \nThe United States also has a strong interest in transferring people in other \ncircumstances, such as in the traditional extradition or deportation contexts.  These types \nof transfers can raise many of the same issues as transfers that take place in the context of \narmed conflicts.  Furthermore, even where U.S. prosecution is an available option, this \nonly serves to delay the issue of transfer in many situations, rather than removing the \nneed to consider it altogether.  Unless prosecution results in the death penalty or life in \nprison, there is a strong chance that the United States will have an interest in transferring \nthe person after he has completed his sentence (or if found not guilty, after trial) in order \nto avoid releasing a dangerous person into the United States.  In fact, maintaining a \nrobust transfer option may actually facilitate prosecutions in the sense that the USG may \notherwise be reluctant to take custody of a person for prosecution if the expected result is \nthat the United States will be unable to remove the person from the country after \ncompletion of his sentence. \nGiven the importance of transfers to the national security interests of the United \nStates, while the use of assurances raises difficult questions, it will often be an important \ntool available to help balance competing considerations.  In other words, transfers \nfacilitated by credible assurances may be preferable to the other options available to the \nUnited States - releasing potentially dangerous people (or declining to capture them in \nthe first place), returning people to foreign governments without assurances against \nmistreatment, or trying to detain them indefinitely.  In this context, the Task Force has \nconcluded that assurances are a tool that needs to be retained to facilitate necessary \ntransfers while minimizing the chances of mistreatment. \n14 \n\n\nI. \t General recommendations applicable to all types of transfers \nA. \t Strengthening U.S. procedures for preventing transfers where torture is \nmore likely than not \n1. \t Clarify and strengthen procedures for obtaining assurances. \nRecommendation:  In situations where the appropriate entity within the USG \ndecides that assurances should be obtained prior to conducting a transfer, the Task Force \nrecommends that U.S. practice should at a minimum include the following requirements,: \n-- The Executive Branch should seek a specific commitment from the receiving \nstate that it will not torture the individual. \n-- The assurances should refer to the receiving state's obligations under the \nConvention Against Torture (CAT) or comparable international obligations and, \nwhere appropriate, to the receiving state's domestic law (including relevant \nprovisions criminalizing torture). \n-- Ifan individual has raised a particularized, reasonable, and credible concern \nabout torture (by a specific agency in the receiving state, for example), assurances \nshould address that concern (for example, by having the receiving state agree that \nthe individual will not be held by the agency of concern). \n2.  Improve USG capabilities to evaluate assurances \nRecommendations: \n-- Ifthe agency responsible for making the transfer decision is not the Department \nof State, it should be required to consult with the Department of State or the Chief \nof Mission at an appropriate embassy in assessing the reliability and credibility of \nall assurances obtained, regardless of which agency obtained the assurances.  (The \nonly exception to this rule would be for military-to-military agreements for the \ntransfer of detainees under the laws of war pursuant to coalition and bilateral \noperations.)  While this evaluation may slow the process in some cases, the Task \nForce believes that the costs of such a delay are outweighed by the benefit of \nbringing the Department of State's expertise into the process of evaluating postยญ\ntransfer treatment.  The Department of State's involvement has a number of \npotential advantages.  First, the Department has the most expertise within the \nUSG on human rights conditions in other countries.  Second, the Department has \nthe broadest perspective on U.S. relations with other countries, which is useful in \nevaluating the context in which assurances may be given.  Third, having one \ngovernment agency evaluate all assurances would be beneficial insofar as the \nagency would develop a body of experience relevant to the evaluation of future \nassurances. \n15 \n\n-- While the Task Force recognizes that using diplomatic channels to obtain \nassurances is not always the most effective approach and should not be used in \nevery case (except in extradition cases), it has concluded that the State \nDepartment should be involved in evaluating assurances in all cases. \n-- The Department of State should provide adequate guidance to Chiefs of \nMission to ensure that they coordinate their involvement in these issues with \nDepartment of State headquarters.  State also should ensure that it can provide \nrapid assistance to other agencies when it receives an urgent request to evaluate \nassurances. \n-- The Executive Branch should strengthen its internal structures for evaluating \nassurances by developing effective interagency information-sharing mechanisms, \nin order to ensure that all relevant agencies have timely access to available \ninformation about U.S. transfer experiences with the receiving states, including \nany available information on the implementation and monitoring of assurances. \n-- The final decision on whether to transfer someone in reliance on an assurance \nprovided by the receiving state should be made by the head or deputy head of the \nagency responsible for the transfer or an appropriately senior designee or a \nDeputies Committee or Principals Committee. \n-- Factors that the United States should consider in evaluating the credibility and \nreliability of assurances include: (1) information concerning the judicial and penal \nconditions and practices of the country providing assurances; (2) U.S. relations \nwith the receiving country, including diplomatic relations as well as military, \nintelligence, or law enforcement relations as appropriate; (3) the receiving state's \ncapacity and incentives to fulfill its assurances; ( 4) political or legal developments \nin that country that would provide context for the assurances; ( 5) that country's \nrecord in complying with similar assurances previously provided to the United \nStates or another country; (6) any information on the identity, position, or other \nrelevant facts concerning the person providing the assurances that bear on the \nreliability of those assurances; and (7) the relationship between that person and \nthe entity that will detain the person or otherwise monitor his activity. \n-- The Inspectors General of the Department of State, the Department of Defense, \nand the Department of Homeland Security should prepare annually a coordinated \nreport on transfers conducted by each of their agencies in reliance on assurances. \nThe report should, with due regard for confidentiality and classification of \ninformation, address the process for obtaining the assurances, the content of the \nassurances, the implementation and monitoring of the assurances, and the postยญ\ntransfer treatment of the person transferred. \n16 \n\n\n3.  Increased use of monitoring mechanisms to implement assurances. \nRecommendations: \n-- In all cases in which the United States obtains assurances, the agency or \ndepartment obtaining the assurances should insist on the inclusion of a monitoring \nmechanism in the assurances it seeks or otherwise establish a monitoring \nmechanism, unless there is a compelling reason not to do so.  In general, such \nmonitoring mechanisms should provide for consistent, private access to the \nindividual who has been transferred, with minimal advance notice to the detaining \ngovernment. \n-- The specific form of monitoring may depend on the circumstances.  For \nexample, in some cases, monitoring may be more appropriately done by the USG, \nalthough the appropriate agency to conduct the monitoring may vary based on the \ncircumstances.  In other cases, monitoring by an outside group may be more \neffective.  Where appropriate, the agency obtaining the assurances should \nconsider whether other countries have monitoring mechanisms in place that the \nUSG could employ or use as a model.  In some cases, it may be possible to work \nwith another country to jointly use the same monitoring mechanism.  The \npossibility of seeking intelligence to assist in monitoring should also be \nconsidered. \n-- Agencies involved in obtaining and evaluating assurances should work together \nto develop guidelines for how to deal with countries that have failed to live up to \ntheir assurances, including when and how changes in circumstance should affect \nthe USG's view ofpast failures to abide by assurances.  This process should be \ncoordinated by the National Security Council as necessary. \nThe three sets ofrecommendations set forth above related to Executive Branch \nprocesses for obtaining, evaluating and monitoring assurances are particularly important \nin light of the fact that, in some contexts, assurances have been held to not be subject to \njudicial review.  See Ahmad v.  Wigen, 910 F.2d 1063 (2d Cir. 1990), and Kiyemba v. \nObama 561 F.3d 509 (D.C. Cir. 2009).  But see Khouzam v. Attorney General, 549 F.3d \n235 (3d Cir. 2008). \nB.  Maintain the standard for evaluating transfers \nRecommendation: The United States should maintain its current legal and policy \nrestrictions on transferring anyone from U.S. custody where it is more likely than \nnot that the person will be tortured. \nStates traditionally have had broad latitude to craft their immigration policies, but \nthey have accepted certain legal limitations regarding when they may deport or expel \npeople from their territories.  In particular, states such as the United States that are parties \nto the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees or its Protocol generally may not \n17 \n\n\nforcibly return a refugee to a place where his life or freedom would be threatened because \nof his race, religion, or political opinions, among other reasons.  Similarly, the United \nStates is a party to the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \nDegrading Treatment or Punishment (the \"CAT\").  Article 3 ofthe CAT states: \n\"l. No State Party shall expel, return ('refouler') or extradite a person to another \nState where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger \nof being subjected to torture. \n2. For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds, the competent \nauthorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including, where \napplicable, the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, \nflagrant or mass violations ofhuman rights.\"5 \nPursuant to the treaty understanding approved by the U.S. Senate and included in \nthe U.S. instrument of ratification, the United States interprets the phrase \"where there \nare substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger ofbeing subject to \ntorture,\" as used in Article 3 of the CAT, to mean \"if it is more likely than not that he \nwould be tortured.\"6  The Article 3 prohibition is absolute.  Unlike non-refoulement in \nthe refugee context, a potential transferee, no matter how dangerous, cannot be sent from \nthe United States to another country if it is more likely than not that he or she will face \ntorture there.  These prohibitions on transferring a person to a foreign country based on \nthe likelihood that the person would be subject to a specific harm in that country often are \nreferred to collectively as the principle of \"non-refoulement.\" \nThe United States has previously interpreted Article 3 to impose legal obligations \non the U.S. only with respect to individuals who are transferred from the territory of the \nUnited States. 7  In light of the United States' stated policy commitment not to send any \nperson, no matter where located, to a country in which it is more likely than not that the \nperson would be subject to torture, this report does not address the legal question whether \n5 Convention Against Torture, Article 3. \n6 Sen. Exec. Rpt. 101-30, Resolution of Advice and Consent to Ratification, (1990) at II.(2). \n7 The United States has argued that this interpretation is consistent with the text of the Convention itself, \nthe negotiating history, and the U.S. record of ratification, as well as the U.S. Supreme Court's \ninterpretation of similar language in the Refugee Convention.  See Sale v. Haitian Ctrs. Council, 509 U.S. \n153 (1993).  Other states and international bodies, however, assert that Article 3 of the CAT applies to \nwholly extraterritorial transfers.  Some take a broad view of the situations in which non-refoulement \nobligations legally attach - not just to expulsions, returns, or extraditions, but to any transfers of people \nfrom the custody of one state to another, wherever located.  Yet others argue that, as a matter of customary \nlaw or by operation of Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, nonยญ\nrefoulement obligations extend to situations in which the sending state believes that the person may face \ncruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or an unfair trial.  (Article 7 of the ICCPR states, in part, that '[n]o \none shall be subject to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\" The U.S. has \nnot agreed with the view that this text contains an implicit non-refoulement obligation nor with the view \nthat the covenant applies extraterritorially.) \n18 \n\n\nArticle 3 applies to transfers conducted by the United States that are initiated outside of \nU.S. territory. \nThe Task Force considered whether, as a policy matter, the United States should \nadopt a different standard than the \"more likely than not to be tortured\" standard in \nevaluating potential transfers.  In particular, the Task Force considered whether to \nrecommend that the United States adopt a \"cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment\" or \n\"humane treatment\" standard.  However, the Task Force ultimately decided against \nrecommending such a change in standard for several reasons.  First, changing the \nstandard would not respond to the criticism that the U.S. has failed effectively to enforce \nthe existing standard.  Second, such a change would create significant complications.in at \nleast some areas of U.S. transfer practice, such as extradition and immigration removal \ncases, where U.S. practice is subject to a complex and long-standing framework of \ninternational and domestic law and practice.  _Third, the Task Force concluded that the \nadoption of a new standard could have uncertain operational consequences.  Accordingly, \nand in light of the other recommendations in this report and the understanding of the Task \nForce that agencies that conduct transfers have a practice of looking beyond the narrow, \nlegal definition of torture in evaluating whether to transfer a person or in obtaining \nassurances, the Task Force concluded that a change of standard or practice is not \nwarranted. \nC.  Improve partner nation detention facilities and capabilities \nRecommendations: \n-- In considering recommendations on correctional assistance, the Detention \nPolicy Task Force should take into account that the potential ability to transfer is \nincreased by better facilities in partner nations, particularly in the Middle East and \nSouth and Southeast Asia.  In considering additional assistance in this area, the \nUnited States should consider whether other partner states are engaged in similar \nactivities and ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that it works cooperatively \nwith those states to avoid duplication ofeffort. \nPerhaps the most important way to minimize U.S. concerns about transfers to \nforeign states is for those states of concern to develop safe and humane detention or \nprison facilities and a work force for these facilities that is well trained, adequately paid, \nand subject to appropriate oversight.  Helping foreign governments - particularly in \ncountries where it is reasonably likely that the United States will wish to transfer \nindividuals in the future - improve their detention capabilities consistent with their \nhuman rights obligations is a worthwhile, albeit long-term, goal.  Current U.S. law \nimposes certain limitations on the USG's ability to provide foreign assistance to support \nforeign police and prisons, but such assistance is not barred. \n19 \n\n\nD.  Create a list of countries to which transfers are barred \nRecommendation:  The United States should not create a list of countries to which \ntransfers will be barred. \nThe Task Force also considered whether the USG should create a list of countries \nwith the worst records on treatment of detainees or a history of failing to honor \nassurances that the United States or other governments have obtained.  Transfers to \ncountries on this list would be barred.  Such an approach would respond directly to the \ncriticism that some countries' human rights records render their assurances inherently \nuntrustworthy.  It would also be a way to demonstrate that the United States takes the \nassurances process seriously and establish consequences for countries that violate \nassurances they have given. \nHowever, this \"black-listing\" approach also has a number of disadvantages.  First, \nthe credibility and reliability of assurances is inherently context-specific.  The person to \nbe transferred, the government entity to which he is to be transferred, the prevailing \npolitical circumstances, and other factors all play critical roles in determining likely \ntreatment after transfer.  A black list is not well-suited to making such context-specific \njudgments.  In addition, such a list may be difficult to alter and may not reflect the most \nup-to-date assessment by the USG of the likelihood that the country will live up to its \nassurances in future cases.  For example, a change in the government of a country could \nincrease confidence in that country's willingness to adhere to its assurances, but it may be \npolitically impossible to remove the country from the list - thereby unnecessarily \nhampering the USG's ability to transfer to that country. \nEven without such a blacklist approach, as a practical matter, if a country is found \nto have violated assurances it has given in connection with transfers, and no change in \ncircumstance intervenes, the USG is unlikely to be able to rely on assurances to transfer \nanyone to that country again. \nII.  Specific recommendation for immigration proceedings \nA.  Update applicable regulations \nRecommendation:  Current regulations pertaining to the treatment of aliens \nentitled to protection under the CAT were implemented in 1999, before the \nDepartment of Homeland Security was created.8  The Task Force recommends \nchanges to the applicable regulations to reflect the shift in responsibility for \nevaluating diplomatic assurances from the Immigration and Naturalization \nService under the Department of Justice to Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.  The Department of Justice continues to \nadjudicate claims for CAT protection in formal removal proceedings through the \nExecutive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), a Department of Justice entity. \n8 These regulations appear at 8 CFR 208.16 -208.18 and 1208.16- 1208.18. \n20 \n\n\nClarifying the decision-making roles ofthe different agencies is important to \nmaintaining an open and transparent process. \nIII. \t Specific recommendations for military transfer scenarios \nA. \t Improved monitoring of detainees transferred from ISAF to the Islamic \nRepublic ofAfghanistan. \nRecommendation:  The U.S. Embassy in Kabul should develop a risk mitigation \nplan to improve monitoring of the treatment of detainees transferred by U.S. \nforces acting under International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to the Islamic \nRepublic of Afghanistan (IROA), taking into account resource and other practical \nconcerns. \nThe United States and ISAF partners concluded an agreement with the IROA that \ngives extensive access to detainees whom ISAF forces have transferred to the IROA. \nHowever, the U.S. government has yet to implement processes as robust as those the \nUSG's ISAF partners have implemented with respect to the access provided by this \nagreement.  The Task Force notes that in other military situations, the Department of \nDefense may be better situated to undertake monitoring in future conflicts. \nB. \t Consider comprehensive training and infrastructure assistance projects to \ndevelop adequate detention facilities in areas where large numbers of \ndetainee transfers are expected. \nRecommendation:  The Task Force recommends using elements ofthe USG \nexperience with the Afghan National Detention Facility (\"ANDF\") as a model in \ncurrent and future conflicts where the United States expects to capture significant \nnumbers of detainees and eventually to transfer them to the host government. \nIn April 2007, the ANDF began operating near Kabul.  The facility was renovated \nby the United States to assist Afghanistan in holding and prosecuting former Guantanamo \nand Bagram detainees.  The USG also trained the guard force, and maintains a presence \nat the facility.  On the whole, the Task Force believes that this facility has been quite \nsuccessful in handling detainees without serious allegations of abusive treatment.9  A \nsimilar approach, particularly with respect to the training of the guard force and the U.S. \npresence at the facility intended to prevent abusive treatment, may facilitate transfers in \nother conflicts. \n9 \"It should be noted that at this writing, Human Rights First is aware of no evidence that Guantanamo or \nBagram returnees in Block Dare being mistreated by the Afghan government.\"  Human Rights First, \n\"Arbitrary Justice - Trials of Guantanamo and Bagram Detainees in Afghanistan.\"  (April 2008), available \nat www.humanrightsfirst.org/us law/detainees/reports/arbitrary-justice/exec sum.html. \n21 \n\n\nC. \t Negotiate assurances with host governments as early as possible in future \nconflicts. \nRecommendation:  The Task Force recommends that, in the future, where it \nappears likely that the Department of Defense will hold and ultimately seek to \ntransfer a significant numbers of detainees in a situation where no other specific \nlegal framework governing transfers applies (such as applicable provisions of the \nGeneva Conventions or a United Nations Security Council Resolution), the \nDepartment of Defense, in cooperation with the State Department, should \nnegotiate assurances with the host government, ifpossible, at an early stage in the \nprocess to govern treatment of transferred detainees. \nWhile concerns about torture usually arise in individualized contexts, there are \nsituations in which the U.S. government may have serious concerns about whether a \ngroup of detainees captured during an armed conflict m~ybe tortured, treated \ninhumanely, or otherwise mistreated if transferred to a particular government's detention \nsystem.  In these situations, there may be a tension between the limitations imposed on \nthe U.S. military presence in another country where that presence depends on the \ncountry's consent (including consent to detain), and the U.S. commitment to avoid \ntransfers where it is more likely than not that the person to be transferred will be tortured. \nTo address this problem, the Task Force believes that the issue of transfers should be \nconfronted at an early stage in the military deployment. \nD. \t Department of Defense policies or directives \nRecommendation:  The Department of Defense should promulgate policies or \ndirectives consistent with the policy statement in Section 2242(a) of the 1998 \nForeign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act.  Such policies or directives should \ninclude an express statement that the Department of Defense may not transfer any \nperson to a foreign entity where it is more likely than not that the person will be \ntortured. \nAs a matter of U.S. domestic law, Section 2242(b) of the 1998 Foreign Affairs \nReform and Restructuring Act directed the heads ofthe appropriate agencies to prescribe \nregulations to implement the U.S. obligations under CAT Article 3. 10  The Justice and \nState Departments promulgated regulations to implement these obligations in the \n11 \nimmigration and extradition contexts, respectively.  Immigration and extradition are the \ntwo contexts in which the U.S. obligations under the CAT are engaged directly, as they \ninvolve transfers from U.S. territory to another state.  Section 2242 also contains a policy \n10 8 U.S.C. ยง 1231 note. \n11 See 8 C.F.R. ยง 208.17 et seq. and 8 C.F.R. ยง 1208.17 et seq.  (Department ofJustice (and now \nDepartment of Homeland Security) regulations); 22 C.F.R. ยง 95.2 (Department of State regulations).  (Note \nthat the degree ofprocedural protection afforded in the immigration context is considerably greater than in \nthe extradition context.) \n22 \n\n\nstatement that asserts, \"[I]t shall be the policy of the United States not to expel, extradite, \nor otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are \nsubstantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to \ntorture, regardless of whether the person is physically present in the United States.\"  This \nrecommendation is to implement this policy directive. \nIV. \t Specific recommendations for any transfers that may take place by or with \nthe support of elements of the Intelligence Community \nThe Task Force formulated a number ofrecommendations that would apply to \ntransfers conducted pursuant to intelligence authorities.  With the exception ofthe \nrecommendation that follows immediately below, these recommendations are found in \nthe classified annex. \nA. \t Intelligence Community policies or directives \nRecommendations: \n-- The Director ofNational Intelligence, in consultation with the relevant elements \nof the Intelligence Community, and subject to the direction and approval of the \nNational Security Adviser, should draft and promulgate general policy guidance \nto the Intelligence Community concerning transfers.  This guidance should be \npublic and should be consistent with Section 2242(a) of the 1998 Foreign Affairs \nReform and Restructuring Act. \n-- Elements ofthe Intelligence Community that may be called upon to conduct or \nparticipate in transfers should adopt implementing regulations or directives for \ntheir conduct, including standards for secure and humane treatment of detainees. \nduring transportation, and an express statement that the Intelligence Community \nelement may not transfer any person to a foreign entity where it is more likely \nthan not that the person will be tortured and a requirement that the element will \ntake appropriate steps to investigate any credible allegations that a transferred \nperson has been subjected to torture by a foreign entity.  The regulations or \ndirectives should make clear that these considerations are an express part of the \nreview process required before approving a transfer conducted or facilitated by an \nelement of the Intelligence Community. \n23 \n\n\nAPPENDIX A \nExecutive Order 13491 \nTHE  WHITE  HOUSE \n\nOffice  of  the  Press  Secretary \nFor  Immediate  Release  January  22, \n2009 \nEXECUTIVE  ORDER \nENSURING  LAWFUL  INTERROGATIONS \nBy  the  authority vested  in me  by  the  Constitution and \nthe  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  in  order  to \nimprove  the  effectiveness  of  human  intelligence-gathering, \nto  promote  the  safe,  lawful,  and  humane  treatment  of \nindividuals  in United  States  custody  and  of  United  States \npersonnel  who  are  detained  in armed  conflicts,  to  ensure \ncompliance  with  the  treaty obligations  of  the \nUnited  States,  including  the  Geneva  Conventions,  and  to \ntake  care  that  the  laws  of  the  United  States  are  faithfully \nexecuted,  I  hereby  order  as  follows: \nSection  1.

Extradition \nIn the extradition process, the Secretary of State is the U.S. official responsible for \ndetermining whether to surrender a fugitive to a foreign country to face prosecution or to \nserve a sentence.  Decisions on extradition where there is a potential issue oftorture are \npresented to the Secretary (or by delegation, to the Deputy Secretary) pursuant to \nregulations at 22 C.F.R. Part 95. \nIn making the determination whether to surrender, the Secretary or Deputy \nSecretary considers whether a person facing extradition from the United States is \"more \nlikely than not\" to be tortured in the state requesting extradition.  Where allegations \nrelating to torture are made or the issue is otherwise brought to the Department's \nattention, appropriate policy and legal offices review and analyze information relevant to \nthe case in preparing a recommendation to the Secretary or Deputy Secretary on whether \nto sign the surrender warrant.  The regulations provide that the Secretary or Deputy \nSecretary's decision is not subject to judicial review.  This regulatory bar currently is \nbeing challenged in litigation in Califomia. 12 \nSurrender may be conditioned on the requesting state's provision of specific \nassurances relating to torture or to aspects of the requesting state's criminal justice \nsystem that protect against mistreatment.  Assurances of the latter kind may include, for \nexample, commitments that the fugitive will have regular access to counsel and the full \nprotections afforded under that State's constitution or laws. \nAssurances against torture have been sought in only a small number of extradition \ncases.  These assurances are generally in writing, explicit as to protection against torture, \ninclude a monitoring mechanism, and are from a ministerial level official or above. Ifthat \nofficial is the Minister of Foreign Affairs -- the normal channel for extradition -- they \ngenerally will not be acted upon until it has been directly confirmed with the officials \nwho will be responsible for the individual while in custody that they are aware of the \nassurances provided and committed to complying with them. \nPrior to negotiating a new extradition treaty, the United States undertakes a \nreview ofthe potential treaty partner's human rights record to determine if it will respect \nboth the rule oflaw and an extradited individual's human rights, including protections \nagainst torture.  (It is in the U.S. Government's interest to do so, as most of its modem \nextradition treaties envision that the United States will extradite U.S. nationals pursuant \nto appropriate extradition requests.)  Although some extradition treaties predate this \npractice, in most cases there is thus a built-in screening mechanism in place in the \n12 Trinidad v. Benov, CV 08-7719 (C.D. CA February 13, 2009). \n30 \n\n\nextradition context that reduces the likelihood that questions about torture in the \nrequesting country will arise in the extradition context. \nThe Executive Branch acknowledges that it occasionally seeks assurances in \nextradition cases but typically declines to disclose whether it has sought assurances in \nspecific cases and rarely reveals the contents of any assurances in the extradition context. \nUnder the rule ofnon-inquiry, courts will generally not examine the fairness of the \nsystem to which the person will be extradited, and the United States has taken the \nposition that its decisions in extradition cases involving torture allegations, including the \nexistence and nature of assurances, are similarly non-justiciable. \n2.  Immigration proceedings \nAs with extradition, the CAT is the primary source on the limitation of removals \nwhere it is more likely than not that the transferee will face torture.  In the immigration \ncontext, regulations codified at 8 C.F.R. ยง 208.18(c) and 1208.18(c) specifically \ncontemplate that the United States may use diplomatic assurances where the person \nsubject to removal raises a claim under the CAT.  Those regulations provide that the \nSecretary of State may forward to the Secretary of Homeland Security assurances that the \nSecretary of State has obtained from the government of a specific country that an alien \nwould not be tortured there if the alien were removed to that country. \nIn practice, the Department of State seeks assurances upon the request of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") and exercises discretion in deciding in \nparticular cases whether to seek assurances upon receiving such a request.  Ifthe \nSecretary of State obtains and forwards such assurances to the Secretary of DHS, the \nSecretary of DHS determines, in consultation with the Secretary of State, whether the \nassurances are sufficiently reliable to allow the alien's removal to that country consistent \nwith Article 3 of the CAT.  Under the regulation, if the assurances are determined to be \nsufficiently reliable, the Secretary of DHS may then terminate any deferral of removal the \nalien had been granted as to that country and the alien's torture claim may not be \nconsidered further by an immigration judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals, or an \nasylum officer. \nSince implementation of the regulations in 1999, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service and DHS have relied on diplomatic assurances to remove only \nthree people.  In contrast, approximately five thousand individuals have enjoyed \nprotection in immigration proceedings through the withholding or deferral of removal on \ngrounds that it was more likely than not that they would be tortured. \nWhile assurances are tailored to the specific case, in general in the immigration \ncontext, they are in writing from the official or officials at the ministerial level (or above) \nwho will be directly responsible for the individual while in the custody of that country, \nexplicit as to protection against torture, and include a monitoring mechanism. \n31 \n\n\nA recent case involving the removal of an Egyptian is worth noting.  In this case, \na Third Circuit panel held that due process under the Fifth Amendment requires that, to \nterminate an alien's deferral of removal on the basis of assurances, the alien must be \ngiven (1) notice and an opportunity to test the reliability ofthe assurances; (2) an \nopportunity to present before a neutral and impartial decision-maker evidence and an \nargument to make his case; and (3} an individual determination based on the record \ndisclosed to the alien. 13  The Third Circuit declined rehearing en bane; the U.S. \nGovernment decided against seeking certioriari. \nAnother high profile removal case is the case of Maher Arar.  The Office of the \nInspector General of DHS issued a report in March 2008 on the removal of Arar from the \nUnited States to Syria, where Arar claims to have been tortured.  A brief discussion of \nthis report is included in the classified annex. \n3.  Transfers pursuant to the Geneva Conventions \nArmed conflicts present another scenario in which the United States may find \nitself in a position ofwanting to transfer or repatriate people to other states.  In \ninternational armed conflicts in which the 1949 Geneva Conventions apply, those treaties \ncontain rules governing the transfer ofparticular categories ofpeople between states. \nThe Third Geneva Convention contains two provisions relevant to transfers of \nprisoners of war (\"POWs \").  Article 118 provides, \"Prisoners of war shall be released and \nrepatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities.\"  The article is silent \nabout what should happen to a POW who genuinely fears repatriation.  During the \nConvention's negotiations, no state condemned the notion of forced repatriation. 14 \nNevertheless, state practice related to Article 118 suggests a policy evolution in the \nmeaning of the provision.  After the Korean War, North Korea, China, and the USSR \ncontended that the obligation to repatriate prisoners under Article 118 was absolute.  In \ncontrast, the UN Command (led by the United States) argued that forcible repatriation \n\"was inconsistent with the  ... spirit of the Geneva Conventions.\"15  The issue also arose \nin the first Gulf War, where the United States and Saudi Arabia granted refugee status to \nsome Iraqi POWs who opted not to return to Iraq.  States thus appear increasingly willing \nto respect the concerns of POW s who fear returning to their states ofnationality, though \nthe issue has not arisen in about twenty years. 16 \n13 Khouzam v. Attorney General, 549 F.3d 235 (3d Cir. 2008). \n14 J.P. Channatz & Harold M. Witt, Repatriation ofPrisoners ofWar and the 1949 Geneva Convention, 62 \n\nYale L. J. 391, 401 (1953). \n\n15 Theodor Meron, The Humanization ofHumanitarian Law, 94 Am. J. Int'l L. 239, 255; Christiane \n\nShields-Delessert, Release and Repatriation ofPrisoners of War at the End ofActive Hostilities (1977). \n\n16 It is worth noting that there are likely to be more options available for relocating a POW, particularly one \nwhose conduct conformed to the laws and customs of warfare, than for relocating an unprivileged \nbelligerent, whom many states will consider a security risk. \n32 \n\nArticle 12 of the Third Geneva Convention also is relevant to transfers.  That \narticle states, \"Prisoners of war may only be transferred by the Detaining Power to a \nPower which is a party to the Convention and after the Detaining Power has satisfied \nitself of the willingness and ability of such transferee Power to apply the Convention.\" \nWhen pursuing resettlement or transfer options to third countries, the United States has \nsometimes concluded POW agreements pursuant to Article 12.  These agreements often \nset forth the type of treatment the transferred POW will receive (i.e., treatment consistent \nwith the Third Geneva Convention); grant the transferring state and the International \nCommittee of the Red Cross (\"ICRC\") access to the transferred detainee; and contain \nprovisions governing the detainee's repatriation or further transfer. \nThe Fourth Geneva Convention offers greater specific protections against \"nonยญ\nrefoulement.\"  For individual \"protected persons\" in the territory of a party to the \nconflict, the Convention states, \"In no circumstances shall a protected person be \ntransferred to a country where he or she may have reason to fear persecution for his or \nher political opinions or religious beliefs. \" 17 \nIn the cases of U.S. transfers under the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions, the \nUnited States transfer policies to date have, to the Task Force's knowledge, met or \nexceeded the relevant U.S. treaty obligations. \n4.  Transfers from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility \nTo date, the United States has transferred more than 500 detainees from \nGuantanamo to their states ofnationality or to third states.  U.S. policy has been to seek \nhumane treatment assurances with respect to all Guantanamo transfers in which it \nforesees that the receiving government will take post-transfer security measures to \nmitigate the threat a detainee poses. 18  In situations in which the United States expects the \ndetainee to be released after his transfer, fewer issues arise with respect to humane \ntreatment.  Accordingly, the United States has not always sought assurances in those \ncases. \nThe USG's practice with regard to Guantanamo assurances has evolved over the \nyears.  The current practice is wherever possible to negotiate a \"framework\" document \nwith each country that has a national at Guantanamo, and then to seek specific assurances \nprior to each individual transfer to which the framework will apply.  The USG has \nnegotiated framework assurances with every major country that has a detainee remaining \nat Guantanamo and where repatriation is seen as a possibility.  Therefore, at this time, \nthere is no expectation that new framework assurance negotiations will be required. \n17 Fourth Geneva Convention, art. 45. \n18 This paper considers \"'releases\" to mean the full release without conditions of an individual.  In contrast, \nthe paper considers \"transfers\" to mean the transfer of an individual from the custody ofthe U.S. \nGovernment to the custody or control of a foreign government, whether for continued detention, the \nimposition of security measures, or other similar oversight. \n33 \n\n\nAlthough the content ofthose assurances varies somewhat, to take into account \nthe particular circumstances of the receiving countries (such as variable treaty \nobligations, or the absence or existence of ICRC access arrangements to detention \nfacilities), they generally include: (1) an assurance that the transferee will be treated \nhumanely and in accordance with the receiving country's obligations under the CAT (or \nunder comparable international obligations when the receiving country is not a party to \nthe CAT); and (2) an assurance that either the USG or a mutually-agreed third party will \nenjoy post-transfer access to the transferees to monitor their treatment.  While the USG \nrequests humane treatment and access assurances as a general rule, it insists on lessยญ\nextensive assurances in cases where it determines that the risk of inhumane treatment, \nwith or without assurances, is negligible. \nThe Department of State has taken the lead in bilateral negotiations to obtain \nassurances for Guantanamo transfers and in evaluating the sufficiency of the assurances \nobtained.  In many cases, the United States has obtained assurances by means of an \nexchange of diplomatic notes or letters between senior government officials, but in other \ncircumstances, the State Department has found assuranc~s to be adequate when stated \norally and reported by the receiving U.S. Embassy in an official cable or reduced to \nwriting in the form of an agreed minutes of a conversation between meeting participants. \nIn addition, the ICRC has the opportunity to conduct exit interviews with \ndetainees being transferred from Guantanamo.  This process provides a further \nopportunity to explore possible concerns about post-transfer treatment. \nThere have been few complaints about mistreatment of Guantanamo detainees \nwho have been transferred to their home states or third states.  However, hum.an rights \ngroups have alleged that a few Guantanamo transferees sustained abuse after being \ntransferred. 19 \nAs in extradition and (to date) im.migration cases, the U.S. policy has been that \nthe United States will not unilaterally make public the contents of the assurances it has \nsought in the Guantanamo context.  As explained in several sworn declarations filed in \nvarious federal courts, this policy is designed to help \"avoid the chilling effects of \nmaking such discussions public and the possible damage to our ability to conduct foreign \nrelations ...  There also m.ay be circumstances where it may be important to protect \nsources of information (such as sources within a foreign government) about a \n19 \"Ill-Fated Homecomings\" Human Rights Watch (September 2007) (making allegations with regard to the \npost-transfer treatment of Abdullah al-Hajji Ben Amor and Lotfi Lagha, who were transferred to Tunisia \nfrom Guantanamo on June 17, 2007), available at www.hrw.org/en/reports/2007/09/04/ill-fatedยญ\nhomecomings.  \"The 'Stamp of Guantanamo.'  The Story of Seven Men Betrayed by Russia's Diplomatic \nAssurances to the U.S,\" Human Rights Watch (March 2007), available at \nwww.hrw.om/reports/2007 /russia0307. \n34 \n\n\ngovernment's willingness or capability to abide by assurances concerning humane \ntreatment or relevant international obligations. \"20 \n5.  Military transfers within or from Afghanistan \nDuring the conflict in Afghanistan, the United States - as part of both Operation \nEnduring Freedom (\"OEF\") and the International Security Assistance Force (\"ISAF\"}ยญ\nhas detained large numbers ofpeople.  It has released some quickly; has held others in its \ndetention facilities in Afghanistan; has transferred some to Guantanamo Bay; has \ntransferred some to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (\"IROA\"); and has transferred \nsome to their states ofnationality. \nTransfers within Afghanistan:  In 2005, the USG negotiated a transfer framework \nwith the IROA for transfers of detainees to the IROA for continued detention and \nprosecution.  As part of this framework, the USG obtained humane treatment assurances, \nassurances against the use of torture, and assurances of U.S. or third party access.  The \nUSG considers the 2005 assurances to apply both to the transfer of individuals detained \nby U.S. forces as part of OEF and to the transfer of individuals detained by U.S. forces \noperating within the ISAF coalition.  In 2007, the United States, with other ISAF \npartners, concluded a subsequent arrangement with the IROA that gives ISAF even \ngreater access to detainees whom ISAF has transferred.21  The 2007 arrangement \nprovides that officials from each signatory government will \"enjoy access to Afghan \ndetention facilities to the extent necessary to ascertain the location and treatment of any \ndetainee transferred by that government toยทthe Government of Afghanistan.\"  It also gives \nISAF governments the opportunity to conduct private interviews with transferred \ndetainees, and permits the ICRC and the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission \nto gain access to IROA facilities.  However, as a practical matter, USG monitoring of \nISAF detainees transferred to the IROA has been far less robust than USG monitoring of \nOEF detainees transferred to the IROA because of the regular U.S. presence in the \nfacilities to which OEF detainees are transferred. \nTransfers from Afghanistan.  Where the U.S. military detains third country \nnationals in the Afghanistan conflict and seeks to transfer those individuals to their home \nstates, it applies the same non-refoulement policy that it applies to Guantanamo transfers, \nand where appropriate seeks third-country assurances prior to such transfers. \n6.  Military transfers within or from Iraq \nThe USG has not sought assurances from the Government of Iraq (\"GOI\") \nconcerning release within Iraq or transfer to Iraqi custody of Iraqi nationals detained by \n20 Declaration of Ambassador Clint Williamson, para. 6 (June 8, 2007), available at \nhttp://www.state.gov/documents/organizations/116359.pdf.  Declaration of Pierre-Richard Prosper, para. 9 \n(March 5, 2005), available at http://www.state.gov/documents/organizations/45849.pdf. \n21 Available at http://www.afghanistan.gc.ca/canada -afghanistan/documents/detaineeยญ\ndetenu.aspx?lang=eng. \n35 \n\nthe multinational force in Iraq (\"MNF-I\").  In December 2008, the United States \nconcluded a new framework arrangement with the GOI pursuant to which the United \nStates now conducts detentions in Iraq. \nTransfers within Iraq.  U.S. forces in Iraq currently operate under a Security \nAgreement (\"SA\") that the USG concluded with the GOI in late 2008.  The SA provides \nthat \"[i]n the event the United States Forces detain or arrest persons as authorized by this \nAgreement or Iraqi law, such persons must be handed over to competent Iraqi authorities \nwithin 24 hours from the time of their detention or arrest.\"  With regard to detainees who \nwere being held by U.S. Forces on the date the SA entered into force, January 1, 2009, \nthe SA provides: \"Competent Iraqi authorities shall issue arrest warrants for [such] \npersons who are wanted by them.  The United States Forces shall act in full and effective \ncoordination with the Government of Iraq to tum over custody of such wanted detainees \nto Iraqi authorities pursuant to a valid Iraqi arrest warrant and shall release all ofthe \nremaining detainees in a safe and orderly manner, unless otherwise requested by the \nGovernment of Iraq and in accordance with Article 4 of this agreement.\" \nAlthough it would be politically difficult to refuse an Iraqi request for transfer, if \nthe USG were to conclude that there was reason to believe that such a detainee was more \nlikely than not to be tortured if he or she were transferred to Iraq, the matter could raised \nwith the GOI at the diplomatic level.  Moreover, the Solicitor General in the USG's \nMuna/and Omar briefs to the Supreme Court stated (prior to entry into force of the SA, \nbut nevertheless still relevant to the above discussion), \"The United States would object \nto the MNF-I's transfer of Omar or Munafto Iraqi custody ifit believed they would \nlikely be tortured.\"  Although the Supreme Court in Muna/held that it would not block \nthe decision to transfer, the decision in Munafreserved the \"more extreme case in which \nthe Executive has determined that a detainee is likely to be tortured but decides to \ntransfer him anyway.\"22 \nTransfers from Iraq.  To date, MNF-I has not released or transferred large \nnumbers of third country national detainees.  Third country nationals detained by MNF-I \nwere provided an opportunity (by way of a questionnaire) to express to the USG fears of \npersecution or mistreatment if transferred.  An interagency group, including the U.S. \nEmbassy and the Department of Defense, evaluated the detainees' responses and made a \nrecommendation to the Commander, who decided whether to transfer each individual.  If \nappropriate, relevant assurances would be sought from the receiving country, although \nthe Task Force is not aware of a case to date where this happened.  Additionally, MNF-I \nnotified the ICRC ofthe potential transfer and offered the ICRC the opportunity to \nconduct an exit interview in which the ICRC could explore the detainee' s possible fears \nof torture or persecution.  However, the ICRC did not always avail itself of this \nopportunity to conduct exit interviews.  Lack of an ICRC exit interview did not preclude \nthe transfer of these detainees to the GOI or other states. \nThese types of transfers were suspended at the request of the GOI, which \nexpressed a desire to prosecute all such third country nationals.  Recently, the GOI has \n22 Munafv. Geren, 128 S. Ct. 2207 (2008). \n36 \n\nissued arrest warrants for all third country nationals in MNF-I custody.  MNF-I has \nstarted turning these third-country nationals over to the Iraqi Ministry ofJustice pursuant \nto the SA. \n7.  Transfers of individuals from one country to another under intelligence authorities \nThere has been much public speculation regarding alleged transfers by elements \nofthe Intelligence Community pursuant to intelligence authorities.  The Joint Inquiry Into \nIntelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September \n11, 2001 (hereinafter the \"Joint Inquiry\") found that such transfers, also referred to as \n\"renditions,\" were an important tool against terrorism.23  In a 2002 written statement to \nthe Joint Inquiry, then-CIA Director George Tenet reported that, prior to September 11, \n2001, the \"CIA (in many cases with the FBI) had rendered 70 terrorists to justice around \nthe world.\" \nA transfer under intelligence authorities would occur under Section 503 of the \nNational Security Act of 1947, as amended, which provides that the President may \nauthorize \"covert action\" when \"necessary to support identifiable policy objectives ofthe \nUnited States\" and when \"important to the national security of the United States.\"24  A \ncritical aspect of these covert action activities is that the role of the United States will not \nbe apparent or acknowledged publicly.  Because, by definition, covert action is not \nsubject to public scrutiny, the National Security Act contains requirements for \ncongressional notification.  Furthermore, section 503(a)(5) specifies that the President \n\"may not authorize any action that would violate the Constitution or any statute of the \nUnited States. \"25 \n23 S. Rep. No. 107-351, H.R. Rep No. 107-792, Report of the Joint Inquiry Into Intelligence Community \nActivities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, at 225 (December 2002). \n24 50 u.s.c. ยง 413b. \n25 Id. ยง 413b(a)(5).  See also S. Rep.

In addition, U.S. agencies involved in intelligence \nactivities have extensive internal regulations and procedures governing appropriate levels of approval and \nauthorization depending on the nature of such activities ...  It is important that the Intelligence Community \nbe able to look at this clear and precise body of U.S. domestic law, regulation and procedures as the \ncontrolling source of authority for its activities.\" To do otherwise would restrict \"intelligence activities that \nare otherwise entirely consistent with U.S. law and policy.\"). \n37 ",

We are withholding the records in part \npursuant to one or more of the following FOIA exemptions set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(b): \n(I) which permits the withholding of information properly classified pursuant to \nExecutive Order No. 13526; \n(3) which permits the withholding of information specifically exempted from disclosure \nby statute, including but not limited to Section 1 02(d  )(3) of the National Security Act of 1947; \n( 6) which permits the withholding of information when the disclosure of such \ninformation \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"; and \n(7)(C) which permits the withholding of records or information compiled for law \nenforcement purposes the release of which could \"could reasonably be expected to constitute an \nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" \nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories oflaw enforcement \ninformation and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \nยง552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the \n\nFOIA.  This is standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as \nan indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \nAlthough this request is now the subject oflitigation, we are including the following \ninformation on FOIA mediation and administrative appeals. \nYou may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National \nArchives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer. \nThe contact information for OGIS is: Office of Government Information Services, National \nArchives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-\n6001, or at ogis@nara.gov, or 202-741-5770, or toll free at 1-877-684-6448, or facsimile at 202-\n741-5769.

On October 3, 2011, this Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order \nconcerning the following matters: (1) the \"Government's Ex Parte Submission of \nReauthorization Certification and Related Procedures, Ex Parte Submission of \nAmended Certifications, ~d Request for an Order Approving Such Certification and \nAmendedยท Certifications\" for DNI/A  G 702(g) Certifications \nSEC:RET//ORCON/NOFORN \n:4(c)-\n5 October 2036 \nNYT v.

The Court's Order granted in part and denied in part .the Government's \nrequest for the Court to approve DNI/AG 702(g) Certifica \nOrder at 2.  In particular, the Court found that the certifications contained all of \nthe required elements. See ~d. at 2-3. The Court further found that with respect to one \naspect of the proposed collection-the \"upstream collection\" of Internet transactions \ncontaining multiple communications (MCTs)-NSA's minimization.p rocedures, as the \ngovernmen~ proposes to apply th~m to MCTs as to which the \"active user\" is not \nknown to be a tasked selector, do not meet the requirements of theยทAct with respect to \nretention.  See id. at 3. The Court further found that NSA' s targeting ancJ minimization \nprocedures, as the government :proposes to apply them to MCTs as to wruChme \"acnve \nuser\" is not known to be a tasked selector, are inconsistent with the requ.irements of the \nSECRETHORCON/NOFORN \nz \nNYT v.

The government previously indicated to the Court that it lacked the capacity to conduct some \nof the activities that are now required by the amended NSA minimization procedures.  Please \nconfirm that the NSA is fully complying with those procedures. \n2.  The Court's Memorandum Opinion defined \"active user\" to be \"the individual using the \nelectronic communications account/address/identifier to interact with his/her Internet service \nprovider.\"  See Oct. 3, 2011 Memorandum Opinion at 35 n. 34 (emphasis added).  However, the \namended minimization procedures state that NSA will identify and segregate through technical \nmeans MCTs where \"the active user of the transaction (i.e., the electronic communications \naccount/address/identifier used to send or receive the Internet transaction to or from a service \nprovider) is reasonably believed to be located in the United States; or the location of the active \nuser is unknown.\"  See Section 3(b)(5)(a). Please confirm that NSA's \"technical means\" for \nidentification and segregation will focus on the location of the individual using the account. \n3.  Section 3(b)(5)(a)(!)(a) prohibits NSA from using a segregated Internet transaction \"for \nforeign intelligence purposes\" unless it has been determined that the transaction does not contain \nany wholly domestic communications.  It is the Court's understanding that segregated Internet \ntransactions may be used only for the purpose of determining whether any communication within \nthe transaction is wholly domestic.  Is this understanding correct? If not, please fully describe \nany other uses. \n4.  What circumstances will trigger review by a specially-trained NSA analyst to determine \nwhether a particular Internet transaction contains a discrete wholly domestic communication?  It \nis the Court's understanding that such review occurs only when a segregated Internet transaction \nis responsive to a query designed to elicit foreign intelligence information.  Is this understanding \ncorrect? \n5.  Please confirm that any transactions reviewed under Section 3(b)(5)(b)(l) will be destroyed if \nthe analyst determines that the transaction contains a wholly domestic communication. \n6.  Section 3(b)(5)(b)(2)(c) indicates that NSA analysts will document certain determinations \"if \ntechnically possible or reasonably feasible.\"  Please explain under what circumstances \ndocumentation would be considered technically possible but not reasonably feasible. \n7.  Section 3(c)(2) states, in the context of destruction of raw data: \"[t]he internet transactions \nthat may be retained include those that were acquired because oflimitations on NSA's ability to \nfilter communications.\" Please explain the meaning of this statement? \n--ยทยท-ยทยท--ยท ยท---&.-Pleaseexplain-whetheF,-and-if.so..under-what-eircumstances,NSA-will-share-unrninimized-ยทยท--ยท------ \ncommunications acquired through its upstream collection under Section 6(c) (sharing with CIA \nTOP SECREF/fCOMIN'I'lfNOFORN \n-- ---..-  -ยทยท \n~. \nNYT v.

Section 3(b)(5)(b)(4) of the amended NSA minimization procedures allows NSA to use \nmetadata extracted from Internet transactions without first determining whether the metadata was \nextracted from a wholly domestic communication or a non-target communication. Please fully \ndescribe what constitutes \"metadata\" within the meaning of this provision. \n10.  It is the Court's understanding that metadata extracted in accordance with Section \n3(b)(5)(b)(4) may otherwise be retained, used, and disseminated in accordance with the other \nprovisions of the amended NSA minimization procedures.  Is this understanding correct? \na.  For example, is metadata that has been extracted from Internet transactions pursuant to \nSection 3(b)(5)(b)(4) subject to the two-year retention limit set forth in Section 3(c) of the \namended NSA minimization procedures? If not, how long is such metadata retained?  If such \nmetadata (including metadata extracted from discrete, non-target communications) is retained \nfor longer than two years, how is Section 3(b)(5)(b)(4) consistent with the requirements of 50 \nU.S.C. ยง 1801(h)(1)? \nb.  Is metadata consisting of U.S. person information disseminated only if such information \nconstitutes foreign intelligence information or is necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation or assess its importance?  If not, how is Section 3(b)(5)(b)(4) consistent with the \nrequirements of 50 U.S.C. ยง 1801(h)(1)-(2)? \n11. Under Section 3(b)(5)(b)(4), NSA will not extract or use metadata from segregated Internet \ntransactions.  Will this limitation impair NSA's ability to determine when the users of targeted \nfacilities have entered the United States? \nTOP SJSCR:ET//CO:P.H:NT/INOFORN  Page2 \nNYT v.

This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. ยง 552 \n(โFOIAโ), to obtain an order for the production of agency records from Defendant in response to \nthree FOIA requests properly made by Plaintiffs.   \n2.  In the aftermath of September 11, Defendant U.S. Department of Justice \n(โDOJโ) played a key role in establishing new counterterrorism legal policies.  The policies, \nwhich dealt with such subjects as the detention and interrogation of terrorism suspects and the \nexpanded use of surveillance, are of significant public interest because they attempt to balance \nnational security with the protection of civil liberties and compliance with the law.   \n3.  The three requests at issue in this action, all brought by Plaintiffs in the \nlast year, all address post-September 11 counterterrorism policies.  In each instance, DOJ failed \n    1 \n60624   \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-07020   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 2 of 8\n \nto respond to the request in twenty business days as required under FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \nยง552(a)(6)(A).  \nPARTIES \n4.  Plaintiff The New York Times Company publishes The New York Times \nnewspaper and www.nytimes.com.  The New York Times Company is headquartered in this \njudicial district at 620 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York. \n5.  Plaintiff Charlie Savage is a reporter for The New York Times and an \nemployee of The New York Times Company. \n6.  Defendant U.S. Department of Justice (โDOJโ) is an agency of the federal \ngovernment that has possession and control of the records that Plaintiffs seek.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. ยง 1331 and 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(B).  \n8.  Venue is premised on the place of business of Plaintiffs and is proper in \nthis district under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(B). \n9.  Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies available in regard to \nthe three requests at issue.  In each of them, Defendant has failed to make an initial \ndetermination within the time frame set by FOIA, and therefore Plaintiffs are deemed to have \nexhausted all administrative remedies pursuant to 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(6)(C). \nFACTS \n10.  The documents sought by the three FOIA requests at issue all relate to \nPlaintiffsโ ongoing reporting on DOJโs counterterrorism legal policies developed in the aftermath \nof September 11.  \n    2 \n60624   \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-07020   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 3 of 8\n \nA.  The Task Force Request \n11.  On October 28, 2015, Plaintiffs submitted a FOIA Request to DOJ (the \nโTask Force Requestโ) seeking โthe final reports by the Special Interagency Task Force on \nDetainee Disposition established by Executive Order 13,493 and the Special Interagency Task \nForce on Interrogation and Transfer Policies established by Executive Order 13,491.โ \n12.  Because of a typographical error in the original Task Force Request, \nPlaintiffs initially listed that the Special Interagency Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer \nPolicies was established by Executive Order 13,493.  Plaintiffs corrected the error for DOJ on \nJanuary 15, 2016. \n13.  DOJ acknowledged the Task Force Request on January 15, 2016.   \n14.  Also on January 15, 2016, DOJ informed Plaintiffs that DOJ was engaged \nin litigation with the International Counsel Bureau (โICBโ) over FOIA requests submitted by \nICB (the โICB Litigationโ) and that the reports at issue in Plaintiffsโ Task Force Request were \nresponsive to the FOIA requests in the ICB Litigation (Intโl Counsel Bureau v. U.S. Depโt of \nDef. et al., 13-cv-01591 (JDB) (D.D.C. 2013)).   \n15.  A representative for DOJโs FOIA Office told Plaintiffs that, as a result, he \nthought DOJ would be able to respond to the Task Force Request by the end of January 2016.  \n16.  In February 2016, ICB voluntarily dismissed its claims against DOJ.  \n17.  On August 8, 2016, DOJ informed Plaintiffs that its Office of Information \nPolicy was still processing the Task Force Request.   \n18.  DOJ has failed to issue a response to the Task Force Request within 20 \nbusiness days as required under FOIA.  \n \n    3 \n60624   \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-07020   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 4 of 8\n \nB.  The Rowan Memo Request \n19.  On January 7, 2016, Plaintiffs submitted a FOIA Request to DOJ (the \nโRowan Memo Requestโ), seeking โthe memo on discovery issues raised by Stellarwind written \nby Pat Rowan and dated May 4, 2005.โ   \n20.  โStellarwindโ is the code name for the U.S. Governmentโs warrantless \nwiretapping and bulk data collection program that President George W.
