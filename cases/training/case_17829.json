          "description": "Minute Entry for proceedings held with chambers of Magistrate Judge Bernard G. Skomal: Plaintiff's counsel contacted Judge Skomal's chambers regarding the filing of a motion for expedited discovery on January 14, 2021. Before any briefing may be filed, the parties must meet and confer. If the parties can agree on a proposal, they may file a joint motion with their proposal. If they do not agree after meeting and conferring, they may file a joint statement setting forth each parties' position on the issue. The parties must meet and confer by January 27, 2021 and file either a joint motion or a joint statement by February 8, 2021. It must include the parties' proposed date to file their Rule 26(f) report and proposed deadlines for completion of fact and expert discovery. Additionally, if either party seeks discovery related to any particular topics on an expedited basis the scope of that discovery should be specifically identified. If a joint statement is filed, it is limited to five pages each with any exhibits summarized or quoted within the briefing. Because joint statements must include not only each parties' position, but a parties' response to the opposing party, the parties must exchange their briefing in advance of the deadline to submit a joint statement to allow each party to respond to the other's arguments.(no document attached) (rxa) (Entered: 01/15/2021)"

    "summary": "<p>On November 2, 2020, asylum seekers with disabilities and health conditions filed this putative class-action suit against the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection in the Southern District of California. The suit alleged that defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by forcibly returning plaintiffs to Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols (the &ldquo;MPP&rdquo;). Under the MPP, asylum seekers entering the United States from Mexico were returned to Mexico and forced to wait outside of the U.S. for the duration of their immigration proceedings. The plaintiffs stated that MPP conflicted with CBP&rsquo;s own procedure at the time that asylum seekers with &ldquo;known physical or mental health issues&rdquo; could not be sent to Mexico. They alleged that DHS failed to put in place effective methods to ensure that people with known physical or mental health conditions were exempt from MPP and to identify and assess, for accommodations, immigrants with disabilities. The plaintiffs sought an order enjoining the defendants from continuing forcible removal of class members under MPP and requiring the defendants to put in place practices and procedures in compliance with Section 504. They also requested attorneys&rsquo; fees. The plaintiffs were represented by the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center, Texas Civil Rights Project, and private counsel. The case was assigned to Judge Todd W. Robinson and Magistrate Judge Bernard G. Skomal.</p>\r\n<p>On November 3, 2020, the case was related to<em> <a href=\"../../../../case/17356/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Doe v. McAleenan</a></em>, which&nbsp;similarly challenged deportation under MPP.</p>\r\n<p>On December 22, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to stay pending the appeal of <em><a href=\"../../../../case/17118/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Innovation Law Lab v. Nielson</a></em>. The judge denied the motion on February 19, 2021. There were joint motions to continue on March 2, 2021.</p>\r\n<p>On December 23, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. They requested that defendants stop subjecting members of the putative class to the MPP. They further requested that defendants put in place mechanisms ensuring execution of CBP&rsquo;s protocols of exempting those with known physical or mental health issues, that family members of the putative class be excluded pursuant to the Family Unit Policy, and that defendants put in place practices and policies to identify immigrants with disabilities and provide accommodations necessary for those with disabilities to prepare for their asylum proceedings. On the same day, the plaintiffs also filed a motion requesting class certification for asylum seekers with disabilities and their family members.</p>\r\n<p>On February 22, 2021, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. Before the court had a chance to rule on this motion, however, the parties notified the court that they had reached a settlement in principle. The parties notified the court on June 17 and requested the court to vacate all pending dates and to set a settlement conference. The parties exchanged drafts of the settlement for several weeks, but ongoing uncertainty in the Biden administration's immigration policies, including the MPP, delayed the process. On March 29, 2022, the court dismissed all outstanding motions as moot, including plaintiffs' motions for preliminary judgment and to certify the class as well as defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. On April 28, the court stayed the proceedings for 90 days.</p>\r\n<p>This case is on-going pending resumption of settlement discussions and the stay's expiration in July of 2022.</p>",

MORGAN, Acting \nCommissioner of U.S. Customs and \n6  Border Protection, in his official \ncapacity, \n7 \nDefendants. \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n    \n  \n\n \n \n1  1.  Named Plaintiffs1 are men, women, and children who represent putative \n2  classes of migrants with disabilities and health conditions and their family members \n3  whom  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (“DHS”)  and  its  sub-component \n4  Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) have forcibly returned to Mexico under the \n5  so-called  Migrant  Protection  Protocols  (the  “MPP”).  Defendants’  own  policies \n6  categorically prohibit placing people with “mental or physical health issues in the \n7  MPP.” This is far from accidental. Instead, the brutal practice of ignoring this policy, \n8  refusing disability accommodations, and sending people with disabilities to survive \n9  in makeshift refugee camps and shelters in Mexico is widespread. The risk of harm \n10  to people with disabilities in this program is imminent, substantial, and irreparable. \n11  Countless individuals have tried and failed to overcome the everyday deprivations of \n12  water, sanitation, medicine, and reasonable aids in order to prepare and present their \n13  cases in inaccessible courts without basic accommodations. \n14  2.  Prior  to  being  placed  in  the  MPP,  CBP  takes  a  recently  arrived \n15  immigrant into custody and detains them in a CBP processing center. As a result of \n16  this process, Defendants knew or should have known during Plaintiffs’ time in CBP \n17  custody  that  Plaintiffs  or  their  family  member  had  physical  or  mental  health \n18   \n1 A motion to proceed under anonymity is forthcoming. In this case, Plaintiffs assert \n19  multiple  facts  that  support proceeding with  anonymity.  They  (1) face imminent \nthreats from anti-immigrant groups in Northern Mexico; (2) disclose information of \n20  the utmost intimacy about the physical abuse and discrimination that could subject \nthem to being ostracized; and (3) face potential retaliation from port officials, who \n21  have threatened to label as “terrorists” other migrants who peacefully raised public \nawareness of their plight, an action that would bar that person from receiving asylum. \n22  These factors counsel in favor of proceeding anonymously. Does I thru XXIII v. \nAdvanced Textile Corp., 214 F.3d 1058, 1067-68 (9th Cir. 2000) (party may preserve \n23  anonymity  in  judicial  proceedings  when  “special  circumstances  justify”  this \ntreatment – i.e., when the plaintiff’s need for anonymity outweighs prejudice to the \n24  [Defendants] and the public’s interest in knowing [Plaintiff’s] identity”); see also Al \nOtro Lado, Inc. v. Nielsen, No. 17-cv-02366-BAS-KSC, 2017 WL 6541446, at *1 \n25  (S.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 2017) (granting anonymity to asylum seekers who brought suit \nagainst the government for denying them access to the U.S. asylum system through \n26  unlawful policies and practices). Moreover, ten of the plaintiffs are minor children \nand the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require redaction of the names of minor \n27  children. Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 5.2(a) (“In an electronic or paper filing with the court \nthat contains . . . the name of an individual known to be a minor, . . . the filing may \n28  include only . . . the minor’s initials”). Plaintiffs will disclose their identities to the \nrepresentatives of Defendants.  \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n1 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  conditions, including disabilities. Plaintiffs’ conditions are open and obvious, well \n2  documented, and/or were repeatedly reported to CBP agents. Further, Defendants are \n3  obligated to put in place screening procedures to identify people with disabilities.  \n4  3.  Defendants have utterly failed to establish mechanisms to ensure that its \n5  agents follow Defendants’ policies, including exempting migrants with physical or \n6  mental health conditions from the MPP. As a result, Defendants’ employees or agents \n7  subjected Plaintiffs to the MPP, forcing them to return to Mexico pending their \n8  immigration proceedings and any appeals. \n9  4.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiffs and putative class members \n10  in Mexico do not have sufficient shelter, are denied essential medical equipment and \n11  care, and/or face barriers such as inaccessible buildings and facilities, a lack of sign \n12  language  interpreters,  and  a  lack  of  effective  communication,  all  of  which \n13  substantially affect their ability to prepare for and adequately aid in their defense in \n14  removal proceedings.  \n15  5.  Further,  Defendants  send  Plaintiffs  and  members  of  the  class—\n16  sometimes  completely  without  warning—to  areas  in  Mexico  for  which  the \n17  Department of State has given the highest travel warning due to rampant murder, \n18  armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, extortion, and sexual assault, and to some \n19  areas where the Department of State warns U.S. citizens that local law enforcement \n20  is not capable of protecting them. This is particularly harmful to Plaintiffs and \n21  members of the putative class, who are especially vulnerable to persecution, torture, \n22  and human trafficking in Mexico.  \n23  6.  As a result of these conditions, Plaintiffs and putative class members \n24  cannot meaningfully prepare for or participate in removal proceedings, including \n25  asserting any defenses to removal to another country claims. For example, Plaintiffs \n26  are forced to divert their time, energy, and resources to attempt to obtain—sometimes \n27  unsuccessfully—basic medical equipment and care, making it virtually impossible \n28  for them to meaningfully assert defenses to removal or otherwise prepare for removal \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n2 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  proceedings.  \n2  7.  Despite repeated pleas from Plaintiffs and advocates, and despite clear \n3  evidence of harm, Defendants continue to refuse to exempt Plaintiffs and members \n4  of the class from the MPP notwithstanding that their own policies and applicable laws \n5  require them to do so.  \n6  8.  Plaintiffs  seek  a  declaration  that  Defendants’  actions  violate  the \n7  Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., and Section 504 of \n8  the  Rehabilitation  Act  of  1973,  29  U.S.C.  § 794,  and  seek  an  order  enjoining \n9  Defendants from continuing to subject Plaintiffs and putative class members to the \n10  MPP, and requiring Defendants to put in place practices and procedures to satisfy \n11  their obligations under Section 504. \n12  I.

Plaintiff N.R.R. is a forty-four-year-old woman and the wife of a person \n27  with disabilities (D.G.M.). Since on or about July 28, 2019, Defendants have forced \n28  her and her family to remain in Mexico under the MPP. \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n5 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  27.  Plaintiff H.H.M. is a twenty-year-old man and is a qualified individual \n2  with a disability. He is deaf and does not communicate through any standardized sign \n3  language. He relies on his sister, E.H.M., almost exclusively for communication. \n4  Since on or about March 21, 2020, Defendants have forced him and his family to \n5  remain in Mexico under the MPP. \n6  28.  Plaintiff E.H.M. is a twenty-two-year-old woman and is the sister of \n7  person with disabilities (H.H.M.). Since on or about March 21, 2020, Defendants \n8  have forced her, her child, and her brother to remain in Mexico under the MPP. \n9  29.  Plaintiff  C.J.V.C.  is  a  fourteen-year-old  child  and  is  a  qualified \n10  individual with a disability. He has an amputated leg.

Plaintiff La.V.S.O. is a one-year-old baby and is a qualified individual \n14  with a disability. She was born with congenital hydrocephalus, which causes a \n15  buildup of fluid around her brain and spinal cord and requires specialized medical \n16  treatment. Since on or about February 27, 2020, Defendants have forced her and her \n17  family, including her mother A.A.F.S.O., to remain in Mexico under the MPP. \n18  31.  Al Otro Lado is a non-profit, binational legal services organization \n19  incorporated  in  California.  Al  Otro  Lado  serves  indigent  deportees,  migrants, \n20  refugees and their families, principally in Los Angeles, California and Tijuana, \n21  Mexico. In both locations, the populations that Al Otro Lado serves includes many \n22  individuals with disabilities or who are seriously ill, as well as their families. The \n23  volume of individuals with disabilities or medical conditions subjected to the MPP \n24  requiring Al Otro Lado’s assistance has forced Al Otro Lado to expend significant \n25  additional  time  and  effort,  affecting  the  organization’s  activities  and  staffing, \n26  frustrating its mission, and requiring it to divert its resources.  \n27  B.  The Defendants \n28  32.  Defendant  U.S.  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (“DHS”)  is  a \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n6 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  Department within the Executive Branch tasked with enforcing the immigration laws \n2  of the United States. \n3  33.  Defendant Chad Wolf is or was the purported Acting Secretary of DHS \n4  at all times relevant to this suit and is sued in his official capacity. Defendant Wolf \n5  is  responsible  for  the  administration,  implementation,  and  enforcement  of  U.S. \n6  immigration laws and policies pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a), including policies \n7  related to the forcible return of asylum-seekers to Mexico at the U.S. southern border. \n8  34.  Defendant U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) is the sub-\n9  agency of DHS that is responsible for enforcement operations along the borders of \n10  the United States, including the U.S. southern border. \n11  35.  Defendant Mark A. Morgan is the Acting Commissioner of CBP and is \n12  sued in his official capacity. Defendant Morgan oversees the apprehension and \n13  detention of individuals, including asylum seekers, who enter the United States at or \n14  near the U.S. border. \n15  II.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n16  36.  This case arises under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 \n17  U.S.C. § 701 et seq., and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \n18  § 794. \n19  37.  The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343, 1346, \n20  2201-2202; 29 U.S.C. § 794a; and 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n21  38.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because a substantial part of \n22  the acts or omissions occurred in the Southern District of California.  \n23  III.  LEGAL FRAMEWORK \n24  A.  Section 240 Proceedings  \n25  39.  The Immigration and Naturalization Act (“INA”) provides different \n26  proceedings for different categories of individuals to determine their admissibility to \n27  the United States. \n28  40.  The proceedings relevant to this case are set forth in section 240 of the \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n7 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  INA, as well as any appeals as of right therefrom including petitions for review, \n2  collectively referred to herein as “Section 240 proceedings.” Section 240 is codified \n3  at 8 U.S.C. § 1229a. Appeals as of right from those proceedings are discussed in 8 \n4  C.F.R. § 1003.1. Petitions for review to Circuit Court of Appeals (included in the \n5  term “appeals as of right” for the purposes of this complaint) are discussed in 8 U.S.C. \n6  § 1252. \n7  41.   Section 240 proceedings are evidentiary hearings presided over by an \n8  immigration judge. \n9  42.  Through this, individuals, who are respondents in these proceedings, are \n10  given the opportunity to examine evidence brought against them, to present evidence, \n11  and to cross-examine witnesses. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4). \n12  43.  The  respondent  has  the  burden  of  proof  on  most  issues,  and  in \n13  determining whether that burden has been met, an immigration judge focuses on \n14  whether the respondent has submitted credible, persuasive, specific facts. 8 U.S.C. § \n15  1229a(c)(2). Any evidence submitted by the noncitizen must comply with applicable \n16  requirements. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3). \n17  44.  A  respondent  who  does  not  appear  for  a  scheduled  Section  240 \n18  proceeding  faces  a  significant  risk  that  the  immigration  judge  will  order  their \n19  removal. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5). \n20  45.  Appeals as of right, which include appeals to the Board of Immigration \n21  Appeals and petitions for review for the purposes of this complaint as indicated \n22  above, involve review of the factual and legal findings of the agency through briefs, \n23  occasionally including oral argument. A respondent who does not file briefs on \n24  appeal faces a significant risk of having an appeal as of right dismissed. \n25  B.   The Migrant Protection Protocols \n26  46.  The MPP, introduced in December 2018, is a policy of the Trump \n27  administration that purports to grant CBP officers the authority to return to Mexico \n28  people  seeking  admission  to  the  United  States,  pending  their  Section  240 \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n8 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  proceedings.2 \n2  47.  As of March 2020, Defendants had forcibly returned more than 60,000 \n3  people to Mexico pursuant to the MPP. Approximately 25,000 of these individuals \n4  live in makeshift camps and shelters in Mexican border towns.  \n5  48.  Individuals placed in the MPP are in Section 240 proceedings. The \n6  process of pursuing Section 240 proceedings under the MPP is itself a grueling \n7  exercise. Immigration court respondents who are set for morning proceedings must \n8  travel through extremely dangerous, sometimes cartel-controlled areas, to present \n9  themselves to CBP agents at the Port of Entry before sunrise. Those set for the \n10  afternoon docket often are not released back into Mexico until late in the evening, \n11  often  after  sunset.  Section  240  proceedings  usually  entail  a  series  of  court \n12  appearances, culminating in a final merits hearing. As a result, prior to receiving an \n13  immigration judge’s determination on the merits of their cases, Plaintiffs and others \n14  in the MPP must often present themselves for court many times. \n15  49.  Respondents in MPP proceedings must first pass a medical inspection \n16  before being permitted to enter immigration court. Some individuals have been \n17  turned away and rescheduled because, for example, abysmal living conditions have \n18  caused them to have lice. After their belongings are inspected, individuals often wait \n19  hours in holding areas before being called for their proceedings.  \n20  50.  At San Diego and El Paso, MPP court proceedings are held in the San \n21  Diego and El Paso immigration courts in person, where asylum-seekers interact with \n22  court staff or officials and, when possible, submit documents in person. Once an \n23  asylum seeker is permitted to enter the court, that person is prohibited from exercising \n24  any freedom of movement.  \n25  51.  At  Brownsville  and  Laredo,  Texas,  MPP  court  proceedings  are \n26 \n \n2 Plaintiffs, including members of the putative class, who entered the United States \n27 \nwithout inspection and were apprehended by CBP agents thereafter, do not \nconcede that the INA permits CBP to return them to a contiguous country \n28 \npending removal proceedings by filing this suit.    \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n9 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  conducted in temporary “tent” facilities erected on federal property near the ports of \n2  entry.  These  facilities  are  not  easily  accessible  for  individuals  with  mobility \n3  disabilities, such as C.V.J.C. Those who attend courts at these facilities do not come \n4  face-to-face with any court staff or officials; instead, asylum-seekers interact with the \n5  immigration judge and government attorneys entirely over televideo. Individuals \n6  who have documents to submit to the court must hand the documents to a security \n7  guard  to  scan.  While  waiting  for  others  to  finish  proceedings  with  the  judge, \n8  immigrants are not given any freedom of movement and must ask for and be granted \n9  permission to use restroom facilities. When appearing for the merits portion of their \n10  immigration proceeding, individuals are placed into a repurposed shipping container \n11  that is barely big enough to hold three people. Interpreters are not physically present \n12  for the interviews. Instead, if interpretation is needed, respondents speak through an \n13  interpreter over the phone. \n14  52.  After  proceedings  are  concluded,  depending  on  several  factors, \n15  including whether someone has been granted a non-refoulement interview, people \n16  can wait another several hours, incommunicado, before being returned to Mexico. \n17  53.  The heightened risk of abuse or crimes and the conditions that people \n18  with disabilities face in Mexico—including lack of medical care, medical equipment, \n19  accessible housing and buildings, sign language interpreters, and other necessary \n20  supports—are appalling. \n21  54.  As a result, people with disabilities that Defendants force to return to \n22  Mexico  often  must  focus  all  their  efforts  on  simply  surviving.  They  have  no \n23  meaningful opportunity to prepare for their Section 240 proceedings. In fact, people \n24  with disabilities run the risk of not even being able to appear at their 240 proceedings \n25  because of their disabilities.  \n26  55.  DHS, apparently recognizing that the MPP should not be applied to \n27  people with disabilities, has expressly excluded people with known physical or \n28  mental health issues from the MPP in its policies (the “Physical/Mental Health \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n10 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  Exclusion”). \n2  56.  Among other places, the Physical/Mental Health Exclusion is set forth \n3  on a DHS webpage entitled “Migrant Protection Protocols,” last published on August \n4  10, 2020. In a section of this webpage entitled “Are there any exclusions to who is \n5  subject to MPP?” DHS explicitly states that people with “[k]nown physical/mental \n6  health issues” are excluded from the MPP.3 \n7  57.  On several other occasions—including in a brief to the Ninth Circuit4 \n8  and a statement of “Guiding Principles” applicable to the MPP at all ports of entry5—\n9  DHS and CBP have made it clear that the MPP should not be applied to people with \n10  known physical or mental health issues. \n11  58.  Notwithstanding DHS and CBP’s stated policy that the MPP should not \n12  apply to people with known physical or mental health issues, CBP continues to apply \n13  the MPP to such people, returning Plaintiffs and numerous other people with physical \n14  or mental health conditions, including people with disabilities, to Mexico. \n15  59.  On  information  and  belief,  DHS  has  not  put  in  place  effective \n16  mechanisms to ensure that CBP employees implement its policy exempting people \n17  with known physical or mental health conditions from the MPP, and has failed to put \n18  in  place  mechanisms  to  identify  or  assess,  for  purposes  of  accommodations, \n19  immigrants with disabilities. \n20 \n \n3 Migrant Protection Protocols, DEP’T OF HOMELAND SEC., \n21 \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/migrant-protection-protocols (last visited Nov. 2, 2020). \n22  4 See Br. for Appellants at 13, Innovation Law Lab v.

Defendants similarly refuse to allow Plaintiffs’ family members to \n2  accompany them into the United States or to assist Plaintiffs in preparing for and \n3  participating in their 240 Proceedings. Defendants have a policy of maintaining \n4  family unity “to the greatest extent operationally feasible, absent a legal requirement \n5  or an articulable safety or security concern that require separation” (the “Family Unit \n6  Policy”).6 Defendants have been enjoined from separating parents from their minor \n7  children when in detention or upon release from detention, for example, through \n8  continuing to detain the minor children while releasing the parents, or vice versa.

Conditions that People with Disabilities Face When Placed in the MPP \nand Returned to Mexico \n13   \nDefendants place persons with known physical or mental health issues and/or \n14  disabilities in the MPP \n15  61.  Defendants  routinely  place  persons  with  known  physical  or  mental \n16  health issues, including qualified individuals with disabilities, in the MPP.  Yet, \n17  Defendants have no mechanism to properly screen individuals with disabilities and \n18  exempt them from the program. \n19  62.  Defendants’ practice has been widely reported.8 For example, six people \n20  with physical and/or mental health disabilities, including four children, were placed \n21  in the MPP and sent to Ciudad Juárez.

In Matamoros, Mexico, across the border from Brownsville, Texas, \n3  attorneys with the organization Lawyers for Good Government have confirmed that \n4  children with disabilities were being placed in the MPP, which included at least two \n5  children with Down Syndrome.10  \n6  64.  A 2019 article by The Guardian details the story of José, an asylum \n7  seeker with a severe cognitive disability who sought asylum. When José and his \n8  family arrived at the U.S. border, they provided officials with a written statement \n9  from his doctor affirming that he had the cognitive age of a four-year-old child. \n10  Nevertheless, Defendants separated him from his caretaker, detained him in an El \n11  Paso  detention  facility  for  two  weeks,  and  then  bused  him  to  Ciudad  Juárez, \n12  Chihuahua, Mexico, and placed him in the MPP.11 \n13  65.  José was unable to provide basic information such as his date of birth or \n14  age, and immigration advocates informed government officials of his condition. \n15  Nevertheless, he was sent back to Ciudad Juárez, where he stayed without any \n16  support for nearly three months.12 \n17  66.  Immigration advocates arranged for José to undergo another cognitive \n18  assessment, which confirmed the earlier diagnosis, including the fact that Jose had \n19  no concept of time or space, and no real idea of where he was. Despite this evidence, \n20  CBP insisted on retesting him and held him in a detention center for three days. CBP \n21  then inexplicably sent Jose back to Mexico, where he remained at the time of the \n22  article.13  \n23  67.

The  living  environment  for  those  returned  to  Mexico,  including  in \n7  overcrowded  shelters  or  makeshift  tent  encampments,  exacerbates  any  existing \n8  health  conditions  and  puts  these  individuals  at  risk  for  developing  infectious \n9  diseases.15 There is heightened inaccessibility to health care due to the violence in \n10  northern  Mexico  border  cities  and  a  lack  of  basic  services,  including  medical \n11  supplies. Basic care is in general provided by over-burdened and under-funded non-\n12  governmental organizations.16  \n13  69.  Most of the shelters and facilities available to those returned to Mexico \n14  are inaccessible to persons with disabilities and lack the necessary resources for \n15  persons with physical and mental disabilities. Many individuals are fearful of leaving \n16  to seek care.17 \n17  70.  Apart from these shelters and facilities, those who must live in tent \n18  encampments  face  even  more  inaccessibility  issues.  For  example,  at  the  tent \n19  encampment in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico, which at its height held 2,500 \n20  people, there are only a handful of outdoor showers. There is also a limited number \n21  of portable toilets, which at times have overflowed with human waste.

Existing disabilities and chronic health conditions are exacerbated by \n3  the routine confiscation of medications by CBP agents.19 It can take weeks to secure \n4  new prescriptions in Mexico. Those held in CBP custody also commonly report \n5  chronic conditions being undiagnosed and left untreated, as well as inconsistent \n6  initial  medical  screening  protocols  performed  by  the  Mexican  government.  In \n7  particular, the Mexican government has provided insufficient information to people \n8  with disabilities and chronic health conditions regarding how they could access \n9  healthcare.20  \n10  72.  Being returned to Mexico can be a “catastrophic stressor on health” for \n11  these individuals due to the stress from waiting in a dangerous living environment \n12  and trauma from their experiences in migration.21 \n13  73.  Minors are especially vulnerable to exacerbated mental health issues. \n14  Due to the high need for mental health and psychosocial services for those placed in \n15  the MPP, those with psychiatric disabilities face a lack of care.22  \n16  74.  Generally,  Mexico  does  not  have  enough  health  care  resources, \n17  particularly in the border cities where Defendants have forcibly sent Plaintiffs. In \n18  three Mexican border states, the physician to population ratio is approximately 0.6 to \n19  1,000, and compared to other nations, Mexico exhibits poor performance on quality \n20  of care indicators, including amputations on diabetic patients and avoidable hospital \n21  admission.

Researchers in December 2018 in Tijuana identified many barriers that \n3  those migrating through Mexico face—and since the MPP began to be administered \n4  in January 2019, conditions have not improved. Due to the number of migrants \n5  arriving in Tijuana in 2018, Mexican officials used a sports stadium as a shelter. After \n6  the stadium flooded during a storm, many migrants were forced to move into the \n7  streets.24  \n8  76.  The sports stadium used as a shelter does not have any bathrooms, \n9  forcing migrants to walk outside and pay for the use of a public restroom. Moreover, \n10  those with disabilities are unable to access the available restrooms outside of the \n11  stadium and, for example, some have required someone to push their wheelchair in \n12  order to access the restroom.25 \n13  77.  While other shelters do have bathrooms on site, these facilities are filthy \n14  and have puddles of water on the floor. For instance, at the “El Barretal” shelter, \n15  beyond basic hygiene concerns, the slippery floor makes it impossible for wheelchair \n16  users to even enter and dangerous for people with physical disabilities to use,  as was \n17  the case for a migrant named Rafael who uses crutches. To avoid the inaccessible El \n18  Barretal bathrooms, Rafael relieves himself in a plastic can and sometimes goes five \n19  days without bathing. When he does finally bathe, he pays to use a private bathroom \n20  outside of El Barretal.26 \n21  78.  Migrants  have  reported  being  turned  away  from  local  clinics  and \n22  hospitals, which can be deadly for those with serious chronic health conditions.27 \n23  79.

None of the four shelters in Ciudad Juárez, even the newly built ones, \n8  are fully accessible to persons with disabilities returned to Mexico by Defendants. \n9  The government-run Leona Vicario National Integration Center, which has a capacity \n10  for 3,000 people, originally had no beds, leaving people to sleep on the floor, \n11  including persons with disabilities. The shelter also has no accessible bathrooms for \n12  persons with physical disabilities and no accessible transportation nearby.29  \n13  81.  Some individuals with disabilities reported that neither American nor \n14  Mexican  government  officials  provide  them  sufficient  information  or  otherwise \n15  facilitate access to health care. Although a state health insurance program exists for \n16  low-income migrants, many were not told of its existence. For example, a woman \n17  with high blood pressure and a man with a prosthetic eye were deprived of critical \n18  health care because they were not informed of the state health insurance.30  \n19  82.  Limited food options at many shelters results in an inability to provide \n20  appropriate dietary accommodations for persons with certain disabilities and chronic \n21  illnesses, which can lead to a deterioration in their health.31 \n22  83.

Numerous sources point to Mexico as being unsafe and unsupportive to \n5  deaf or hard-of-hearing persons.  \n6  85.  There is a lack of sign language interpreters for the most basic services, \n7  especially in health care. In a survey regarding accessibility, a mother in the MPP \n8  with a deaf child stated that there are no sign interpreters in Mexican hospitals and \n9  that  sometimes  hospitals  would  not  allow  her  to  accompany  her  deaf  child  to \n10  appointments.33 \n11  86.  Advocates for individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing in Mexico \n12  often speak to the constant discrimination and societal and institutional barriers that \n13  deaf persons face in Mexico.34  \n14  Blindness \n15  87.  People who are visually impaired face architectural barriers as a major \n16  obstacle to accessing rehabilitation services in Mexico.35 \n17  88.

Heightened Risks to People with Disabilities of Kidnapping, Abuse, and \nHospitalization in the Informal Refugee Camps \n10 \n11  90.  By placing individuals with disabilities and medical conditions and their \n12  families in  the MPP,  Defendants  force them to  live  in Mexico where they are \n13  particularly vulnerable to criminal activity. Plaintiffs and putative class members \n14  stand out within their Mexican surroundings because they live in the camps, speak \n15  with non-Mexican accents (or do not speak Spanish at all), or because of their \n16  disability. Criminals often assume people in the MPP have U.S. relatives who can be \n17  extorted for large sums of money.  \n18  91.  From November 2019 to January 2020, criminal organizations in the \n19  Mexican state of Tamaulipas kidnapped at least 80 migrants and attempted to kidnap \n20  an additional 19 people who were in the MPP.39 The organization Doctors Without \n21  Borders reported that between June 2018 and July 2019, 45% of the 2,315 people \n22  (migrant, asylum seekers, refugees, or returnees) treated by their mental health teams \n23 \n \n36 Mario Mora Legaspi, Lamentan que Haya Discriminación Hacia Personas \n24 \nInvidentes, FUNDACIÓN ONCE AMÉRICA LATINA (Oct. 7, 2014), \nhttps://www.foal.es/es/noticias/lamentan-que-haya-discriminaci%C3%B3n-\n25 \nhacia-personas-invidentes.  \n26  37 U.S. DEP’T OF STATE, COUNTRY REPORTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES FOR 2019: \nMEXICO 25 (2019), https://www.state.gov/reports/2019-country-reports-on-human-\n27  rights-practices/mexico/. \n38 Id. \n28  39 US: Investigate ‘Remain in Mexico’ Program, HUM.

In line with these larger trends, Plaintiffs have suffered under the poor \n4  health conditions, disability discrimination, and crime they experience in Mexico. \n5  Many have ended up being hospitalized in Mexico or have had their conditions \n6  deteriorate, resulting from lack of access to the medical care that would have kept \n7  Plaintiffs healthy. For example, in January 2020, while Plaintiff D.Y.S. and his \n8  mother were staying in a shelter in Matamoros as a result of Defendants actions, he \n9  was sexually assaulted. D.Y.S.’s health deteriorated in the weeks following the \n10  sexual assault: He began having seizures and was eventually hospitalized. Similarly, \n11  Plaintiff S.M.A. and her mother ran out of medicine for S.M.A.’s brain disorder, \n12  lissencephaly, after being sent to a makeshift migrant camp in Matamoros, Mexico. \n13  Her  mother  had  no  way  of  replacing  the  medicine,  resulting  in  S.M.A’s \n14  hospitalization.  \n15  93.  Apart from issues of crime and health, conditions in the camp lack the \n16  basic safeguards to make life stable and secure for Plaintiffs and class members.  \n17  94.  In addition to the above-mentioned risks, the COVID-19 pandemic has \n18  made the situation for individuals with disabilities and medical conditions in the MPP \n19  more dire. On July 17, 2020, DHS and DOJ postponed Section 240 proceedings for \n20  people in the MPP until the completion of certain public health criteria, which caused \n21  additional backlog in court proceedings.  \n22  95.  Nonetheless, Defendants are still issuing new hearing dates for people \n23  in  the  MPP.  Plaintiffs  who  have  been  given  updated  court  hearing  dates  have \n24  attempted to prepare for their claims despite the limitations and lack of access noted \n25  above, only to have the court dates postponed yet again each time.

If they leave and are forced to give up their space in a shelter or a \n5  refugee camp, where access is restricted, some people risk losing access to even these \n6  minimal protections of the tent camp or shelter.     \n7  96.  In addition to the crime and poor health conditions that Plaintiffs have \n8  experienced in Mexico, they now face another layer of threat due to COVID-19 \n9  exposure. The informal refugee camps force people to live within arm’s reach of \n10  other tents. These overcrowded conditions are ripe for the spread of COVID-19.41 \n11  Named Plaintiffs and other similarly situated individuals have medical conditions \n12  and/or disabilities that put them at high risk of serious, potentially life-threatening \n13  outcomes from COVID-19.  \n14  C.   The Named Plaintiffs’ Experiences \n15  1., 2., & 3.  E.A.R.R., G.S.E.R., and B.A.E.R. \n16  97.  Defendants  forcibly  sent  E.A.R.R.  and  her  two  sons,  G.S.E.R.  and \n17  B.A.E.R., to Mexicali, Mexico pursuant to the MPP.  \n18  98.  E.A.R.R. is a person with disabilities: She has a pituitary tumor that \n19  presses against her brain and causes severe headaches, dizziness, and fainting spells. \n20  Doctors diagnosed the tumor about three years ago, but E.A.R.R. was unable to \n21  undergo  the  necessary  procedures  to  manage  her  condition.  Her  condition \n22  substantially limits her ability to care for herself, think, concentrate, and work, and \n23  impairs her neurological and brain functions.  \n24  99.  E.A.R.R.’s son, G.S.E.R., is also a person with a disability: he has only \n25  one  functioning  lung.  This  substantially  impairs  his  respiratory  and  immune \n26  functions. For example, when exposed to cold temperatures, he suffers from a severe \n27   \n41 Ashoka Mukpo, Asylum Seekers Stranded in Mexico Face a New Danger: \n28  COVID-19, ACLU (Mar. 26, 2020), https://www.aclu.org/news/immigrants-\nrights/asylum-seekers-stranded-in-mexico-face-a-new-danger-covid-19/.  \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n21 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  cough.  \n2  100.  On or around May 17, 2019, Defendants apprehended E.A.R.R. and her \n3  children and took them into custody. Defendants detained E.A.R.R. and her sons for \n4  five days, including time in a hielera (a Spanish-language term immigrants use to \n5  refer to certain border detention facilities). \n6  101.  Defendants  knew  about  E.A.R.R.’s  and  G.S.E.R.’s  physical  health \n7  conditions because these conditions worsened in the hielera. At the hielera, G.S.E.R. \n8  developed a severe cough due to the cold temperature’s impact on his lung condition. \n9  E.A.R.R. battled an incapacitating headache caused by her tumor. After making her \n10  wait for several hours, Defendants’ guards gave her medication that alleviated some \n11  of the pain.  \n12  102.  On information and belief, sometime during the family’s detention, \n13  Defendants placed E.A.R.R., G.S.E.R., and B.A.E.R. in the MPP. They did not \n14  receive interviews or an opportunity to discuss their medical concerns about being \n15  returned  to  Mexico.  The  family  was  never  given  a  chance  to  understand  the \n16  determination, appeal the decision, or contact a lawyer. Instead, Defendants forcibly \n17  sent them to Mexico. \n18  103.  Since being sent to Mexicali, E.A.R.R. and her sons have struggled. \n19  E.A.R.R. is very worried about not being able to afford treatment if she or her sons \n20  get ill. She has been unable to work as she has no-one to care for her sons and is \n21  afraid for her and her sons’ safety.  \n22  104.  Because  of  this  stress  and  instability,  E.A.R.R.’s  headaches  have \n23  worsened: The pain now spreads down her arms and hands and she is barely able to \n24  sleep due to the pain. She has dizzy spells that impair her ability to function. \n25  105.  Within the past couple of months, E.A.R.R. went to get medicine for her \n26  headaches at a pharmacy. The medical personnel referred her to a specialist for \n27  several tests. Based on her blood test, the specialist told her that, due to her pituitary \n28  tumor, she had extremely high levels of the hormone prolactin in her blood—the \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n22 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  healthy level being around 20 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) and hers being \n2  around 150 ng/mL. She had a follow-up appointment, but despite receiving medicine, \n3  E.A.R.R.’s condition has not improved and suffers from severe headaches, pain in \n4  both arms, and dizziness. She was told that she now needs surgery. \n5  106.  E.A.R.R. struggles to perform everyday tasks because of her severe \n6  headaches and she is worried her family is even more vulnerable in Mexico because \n7  of her medical condition. As she struggles due to her medical condition, she will be \n8  unable to meaningfully participate in her and her sons’ removal proceedings. Her \n9  severe headaches and difficulty sleeping impact her ability, on behalf of herself and \n10  her children, to (i) focus on and understand what is asked of her to participate in \n11  immigration proceedings on behalf of herself and her children; (ii) provide accurate, \n12  relevant, helpful responses to questions in court or on necessary forms; and (iii) \n13  collect and provide required information and documents. \n14  107.  E.A.R.R. is very worried that her son, G.S.E.R., will contract COVID-\n15  19. She knows that he is more vulnerable due to his lung disorder.  \n16  108.  As G.S.E.R. is thirteen years old and B.A.E.R. is twelve years old, \n17  E.A.R.R. prepares their cases and presents their claims in conjunction with her own. \n18  Because of this, E.A.R.R.’s disability significantly impedes her participation in her \n19  immigration court proceedings, and E.A.R.R. must spend significant resources in \n20  caring for G.S.E.R. due to his medical condition. As a result, although he does not \n21  have a disability or medical condition, B.A.E.R. cannot receive proper assistance \n22  from his mother in the preparation of his case. \n23  109.  When she appeared for a hearing, E.A.R.R. tried to tell the judge that \n24  she and her son experience severe health issues and that they felt unsafe returning to \n25  Mexico. The judge suggested E.A.R.R. talk with immigration officers about this, but \n26  Defendants’ employees never gave her the chance to do so before forcibly sending \n27  her back to Mexico.  \n28  110.  E.A.R.R.  and  her  children  were  denied  relief  in  immigration  court \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n23 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  proceedings and her case is now on petition for review before the Ninth Circuit Court \n2  of Appeals. She and her children face obstacles along the appeal process as well. \n3  4.  L.Y.G.  \n4  111.  Defendants  forcibly  sent  L.Y.G.  and  her  two  children  to  Tijuana, \n5  Mexico pursuant to the MPP.  \n6  112.  L.Y.G. has multiple physical and mental disabilities and disorders: She \n7  has  hypertension  (high  blood  pressure),  hyperglycemia  (high  glucose  levels), \n8  scoliosis, kidney stones so severe that she needs surgery, Post-Traumatic Stress \n9  Disorder (PTSD), and panic attacks. Four years ago, doctors diagnosed her with \n10  scoliosis. On a daily basis, L.Y.G.’s scoliosis substantially impairs her ability to \n11  walk, stand, lift, bend, and care for herself. Additionally, her chronic conditions—\n12  hyperglycemia and hypertension—impairs her immune and circulatory function. Her \n13  PTSD and panic attacks impair her ability to think, concentrate, and communicate. \n14  113.  Defendants detained L.Y.G. and her children in the in the hielera for \n15  four days. Defendants were aware of L.Y.G.’s physical disabilities because they \n16  performed a medical examination on her. In addition to her disabilities, Defendants’ \n17  medical  staff  diagnosed  L.Y.G.  with  an  additional  physical  health  condition: \n18  influenza. Every day, the officers brought L.Y.G. medicine, but she did not know \n19  what type of medicine they were bringing her. L.Y.G. remembers having a fever and \n20  her daughter telling her that her skin was hot to the touch.  \n21  114.  Upon information and belief, Defendants decided to place L.Y.G. and \n22  her family into the MPP. They did not receive interviews or an opportunity to discuss \n23  their medical concerns about being returned to Mexico. The family was never given \n24  a chance to understand the determination, appeal the decision, or contact a lawyer. \n25  Instead, Defendants’ employees forcibly sent them to Mexico. Indeed, Defendants \n26  sent L.Y.G. to Mexico even when she had not recovered fully from the flu. L.Y.G. \n27  was not able to explain why she could not return to Mexico. \n28  115.  L.Y.G. has experienced numerous barriers to medical treatment. Since \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n24 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  March 2020, L.Y.G. has not been able to get free medications for her panic attacks; \n2  therefore, she cannot manage her conditions. L.Y.G. is afraid to have surgery because \n3  she has heard that her operation is serious and she is concerned about what will \n4  happen to her children if she were to die.  \n5  116.  Given L.Y.G.’s ongoing weakness and her mental health deterioration, \n6  L.Y.G. struggles to participate fully in the family’s removal proceedings. Due to her \n7  physical and mental health limitations, L.Y.G. is struggling for the survival of herself \n8  and her children. She does not have the mental or physical ability to complete all \n9  tasks necessary in between court hearings: preparing documents, compiling evidence, \n10  and  communicating  with  attorneys.  Furthermore,  the  limitations  posed  by  her \n11  disabilities will prevent L.Y.G. from fully understanding and communicating at long \n12  and exhausting removal proceedings. \n13  5.   H.A.H.G.  \n14  117.  Defendants forcibly sent H.A.H.G. and his family to Tijuana, Mexico \n15  pursuant to the MPP.  \n16  118.   Due to a brutal physical attack, H.A.H.G. has permanent hearing loss, \n17  an inguinal hernia, kidney cyst, and physical impairments. H.A.H.G. has severe, \n18  chronic pain in his back, neck, head, and left eye. As a result, this pain causes \n19  headaches, burning sensations around his eye, and inability to breathe well through \n20  his nose, substantially impairing his respiratory functions and limiting his ability to \n21  think, concentrate, and care for himself. H.A.H.G. has a dislocated disc in his spine \n22  and struggles to move his left arm and leg, which impairs his ability to walk, lift, \n23  bend, stand, and perform manual tasks. His disabilities are easily observable. \n24  119.  On  or  about  on  June  18,  2019,  H.A.H.G.  and  his  two  sons  were \n25  apprehended. His wife entered the day before them on June 17, 2019, with their other \n26  children. His wife and three of their children are currently in the United States, while \n27  he and their two sons remain in Mexico.   \n28  120.  Defendants detained H.A.H.G. and his sons in a hielera for four days. \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n25 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  Defendants  were  aware  of  H.A.H.G.’s  disabilities.  Upon  arrival  at  the  hielera, \n2  H.A.H.G. asked to speak with a doctor and for medicine because he was experiencing \n3  severe  pain.  H.A.H.G.  repeatedly  requested  medical  attention  for  his  pain,  but \n4  Defendants repeatedly denied or ignored his requests. At one point, Defendants told \n5  H.A.H.G. that only children were entitled to medical attention. H.A.H.G. struggled \n6  to sleep because of the pain.  \n7  121.  During  his  detention,  H.A.H.G.  was  interviewed  by  Defendants’ \n8  employees.  H.A.H.G. explained the attack and his resulting limitations, pointing to \n9  places on his body where he had been injured. \n10  122.  Upon information and belief, Defendants decided to place H.A.H.G. \n11  into the MPP. He was never given a chance to understand the determination, appeal \n12  the decision, or contact a lawyer. Instead, Defendants forcibly sent him and his sons \n13  to Mexico.  \n14  123.  H.A.H.G.  continues  to  endure  severe  pain  from  his  disabilities.  In \n15  Mexico, there are many days where H.A.H.G. is unable to walk or do anything \n16  because of the pain he is experiencing. Sometimes, he is unable to even put his foot \n17  on the floor to get out of bed because he is in so much pain. H.A.H.G. has been taking \n18  over-the-counter painkillers like ibuprofen for over two years, but the medication is \n19  insufficient to address the resulting limitations. Doctors have told H.A.H.G. that he \n20  needs a neurologist, a pain management specialist, a kidney specialist, and a spinal \n21  column specialist to address his physical limitations—medical treatment unavailable \n22  in Mexico. \n23  124.  Because H.A.H.G. is not a Mexican citizen, he faces barriers to access \n24  health care in Mexico that prevent him from receiving such specialized medical \n25  treatment. This makes it very hard for him to take care of his children and himself, \n26  let  alone  work  on  their  asylum  case.  He  and  his  sons  therefore  face  obstacles \n27  preparing  for  and  participating  in  their  immigration  proceedings  because  of \n28  H.A.H.G.’s disability. His sons help him as much as they can, but they are too young \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n26 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  to prepare court filings, compile evidence, consult with attorneys, and represent the \n2  family in removal proceedings.  \n3  125.  H.A.H.G. struggles to complete ordinary, day-to-day tasks. Due to the \n4  physical limitations, his lack of hearing aid, his headaches, and his chronic pain, he \n5  believes his conditions will interfere with his ability to travel to court, sit through \n6  hours of proceedings, understand the judge, and adequately present his family’s \n7  asylum case. Furthermore, he finds it challenging to go to court, especially due to the \n8  long wait involved in waiting for transportation to court hearings in MPP. \n9  6. & 7. Y.J.C.E. and J.A.E.M. \n10  126.  Defendants forcibly sent a child with disabilities, Y.J.C.E., his mother \n11  J.A.E.M., and the rest of his family to Mexicali, Mexico pursuant to the MPP.  \n12  127.  Y.J.C.E. has a physical health condition: a heart murmur that causes \n13  chest pain. This congenital heart defect substantially limits his respiratory function, \n14  causing him to struggle to breathe at times. Y.J.C.E.’s heart veins are smaller than \n15  normal, so doctors recommend that he needs to be under medical surveillance at all \n16  times  and  cannot  do  any  strenuous  activities.  Additionally,  Y.J.C.E.’s  immune \n17  system is substantially impaired, meaning that he may not survive medical events \n18  such as a fever, a cold, or COVID-19. \n19  128.  On or around October 26, 2019, Defendants took Y.J.C.E. and his \n20  family into custody. The agents separated Y.J.C.E. and his father from J.A.E.M. and \n21  sister.  \n22  129.  Defendants detained Y.J.C.E. and his family for three days. Defendants \n23  were aware of Y.J.C.E.’s medical condition. While detained, Y.J.C.E. was examined \n24  by a doctor who told his mother, J.A.E.M., that her son had a heart murmur and that \n25  his condition could worsen in the future. J.A.E.M. immediately grew concerned that \n26  the hielera’s cold temperatures would worsen her son’s condition. \n27  130.   Defendants placed Y.J.C.E. into the MPP with his mother J.A.E.M, his \n28  sister  and  his father.  His parents were  never given  a  chance  to  understand  the \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n27 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  determination,  appeal  the  decision,  or  contact  a  lawyer.  Instead,  Defendants’ \n2  employees forcibly sent them to Mexicali, Mexico in a small bus. Given the doctor’s \n3  recent prognosis, his mother, J.A.E.M., was terrified for her son’s health. \n4  131.  J.A.E.M. and her husband struggle to care for him in Mexico. Their \n5  housing  will  soon  end,  placing  them  at  risk  of  becoming  homeless.  Y.J.C.E.’s \n6  medical insurance has ended, so his mother worries that he will not be able to receive \n7  adequate medical care for his condition. In particular, J.A.E.M. is worried that \n8  Y.J.C.E. will be exposed to COVID-19 and she will not be able to afford a doctor \n9  visit or the necessary medicine. \n10  132.  Y.J.C.E. and his family have had three immigration court hearings. \n11  Their individual court proceeding was set for April 2020, but because of COVID-19, \n12  it has been delayed and they have stayed much longer in Mexico. \n13  133.  Given their circumstances in Mexico and Y.J.C.E.’s need for constant \n14  supervision,  J.A.E.M.  uses  a  substantial  amount  of  time,  energy,  and  focus  to \n15  concentrate  on  overcoming  daily  obstacles,  such  as  ensuring  Y.J.C.E.  remains \n16  healthy. Thus, it is difficult for J.A.E.M. to concentrate on preparing for their asylum \n17  claim. This affects Y.J.C.E. who is a minor and relies on his parents to represent his \n18  interests in court. \n19  8. & 9. S.F.L. and C.J.M.L.  \n20  134.  Defendants forcibly sent S.F.L. and her eight-year old son, C.J.M.L., to \n21  Tijuana, Mexico pursuant to the MPP.  \n22  135.  S.F.L. has multiple medical conditions: diabetes, cataracts, and severe \n23  depression.  Doctors  diagnosed  her  diabetes  fourteen  years  ago.  This  condition \n24  substantially limits her ability to care for herself and sleep. For example, she wakes \n25  up regularly at night when her blood sugar level drops dangerously low. When this \n26  happens, S.F.L. is unable to help herself; instead, she relies on C.J.M.L. to bring her \n27  food or something to drink to increase her blood sugar levels. S.F.L.’s cataracts are \n28  a result of her diabetes. The cataracts impair her ability to see and cause pain in her \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n28 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  head, which limits her ability to read and think. She has had surgery but still has \n2  vision problems. Lastly, her depression interferes with her ability to focus and care \n3  for herself, causing her to have suicidal thoughts.  \n4  136.  S.F.L.’s eight-year-old son, C.J.M.L., was born with a closed urethra, \n5  which required surgery when he was just three months old. Although he needs \n6  another surgery, he must first see an endocrinologist because he is also prone to low \n7  blood sugar. S.F.L. already struggles due to her own health, and at times must rely \n8  on her son. As a result, having to care for C.J.M.L.  further aggravates S.F.L.’s \n9  circumstances. \n10  137.  Defendants detained S.F.L. and her son. Defendants were aware of \n11  S.F.L.’s disabilities because, on the third day in the hielera, S.F.L. told Defendants’ \n12  agents that she and her son were ill and informed the agents that she was diabetic and \n13  that her son’s symptoms are likely indicative of low blood sugar. S.F.L. also informed \n14  the agents that she had been told that C.J.M.L. needs to see a specialist related to his \n15  blood sugar issues. \n16  138.  The agents took S.F.L. and her son to the hospital for a check-up. During \n17  the check-up, S.F.L. told the doctor about her cataracts. The doctor then gave S.F.L. \n18  diabetes medicine and sent her and C.J.M.L. back to the hielera.  \n19  139.  On information and belief, around that time, Defendants placed S.F.L \n20  and  C.J.M.L.  into  the  MPP.  She  was  never  given  a  chance  to  understand  the \n21  determination, appeal the decision, or contact a lawyer. Instead, Defendants forcibly \n22  sent them to Mexico.  \n23  140.  In Mexico, S.F.L. cannot access the food and medical care necessary to \n24  manage her disabilities. S.F.L. is unable to afford to see the specialists she and \n25  C.J.M.L. so desperately need in order to improve their health. The conditions have \n26  worsened her depression. S.F.L. often struggles to find enough food to sustain them, \n27  further exacerbating their low blood sugar issues.  \n28  141.  At S.F.L.’s first court hearing in the United States, she informed the \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n29 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  judge that she needed emergency surgery for her eyes because her cataracts made it \n2  increasingly difficult to see. The judge told S.F.L. that she needed to find an attorney \n3  and to inform immigration officers. S.F.L. informed the officers but was still sent \n4  back to Mexico. \n5  142.  S.F.L.’s limitations have already almost forced her and C.J.M.L. to lose \n6  their immigration proceedings. In Mexico, S.F.L.’s eyesight rapidly degraded. After \n7  she was nearly run over by a car, she became fearful for her life and for what would \n8  happen to C.J.M.L. if she died. S.F.L. underwent emergency surgery. Because of \n9  complications from this surgery, S.F.L. was forced to miss her last court date. She \n10  was informed that the court terminated their case due to her absence. Their case was \n11  appealed and remanded to the immigration court. However, due to her limitations, \n12  S.F.L. still faces challenges to prepare for and attend her hearings with C.J.M.L. Her \n13  cataracts, for example, may severely impede her ability to read, review, and present \n14  documents in hearings that rely on written documents. Her depression can affect her \n15  motivation and focus on preparation and participation. \n16  10. & 11. Y.M.M. and J.C.M.M. \n17  143.  On or around March 27, 2020, Defendants forcibly sent Y.M.M. and her \n18  daughter J.C.M.M. to Matamoros, Mexico under the MPP. They were then taken to \n19  Tijuana, Baja California by the Mexican government. \n20  144.  Y.M.M. suffers from a trauma-related disorder consistent with PTSD. \n21  Her condition substantially interferes with her ability to think, communicate, and care \n22  for herself and for J.C.M.M. While trauma-related disorders are not visible to the eye, \n23  Y.M.M. had an interview with an official, and her cognitive issues would become \n24  apparent upon an interview with her. At the time of her detention in CBP custody, \n25  Y.M.M. also had a severely infected foot that limited her ability to walk, of which \n26  Defendants were also aware. \n27  145.  J.C.M.M. has epilepsy, a mild intellectual disability, severe asthma, \n28  frequent  urinary  tract  infections,  and  a  bleeding  condition  for  which  she  has \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n30 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  undergone testing due to the possibility that it is tumor-related. J.C.M.M.’s medical \n2  conditions substantially interfere with her cognitive abilities and her awareness and \n3  physical safety, as well as her bladder and immune functions. As she suffered a \n4  seizure in detention, her epilepsy was or should have been open and obvious to \n5  Defendants.  J.C.M.M.’s uncontrolled asthma was or should have been also open and \n6  obvious to Defendants, as the asthma attack she suffered in their custody caused her \n7  to appear purple all over at times when she was in detention. \n8  146.  Defendants detained Y.M.M. and J.C.M.M. Defendants knew about \n9  their medical conditions. While detained, Y.M.M. asked Defendants’ for medical \n10  help for J.C.M.M. \n11  147.  Defendants decided to place Y.M.M. and J.C.M.M. into the MPP. They \n12  were never given a chance to understand the determination, appeal the decision, or \n13  contact a lawyer. Instead, Defendants’ employees forcibly sent them to Mexico.  \n14  148.  The conditions in Mexico have exacerbated the limitations arising from \n15  both Y.M.M.’s and J.C.M.M.’s medical conditions. J.C.M.M. requires significant \n16  medical care, chiefly for her epilepsy and intellectual impairment, as well as for her \n17  urinary condition. Due to the strain of trying to find the medical care that J.C.M.M. \n18  needs and the stress of the conditions in which they are living, Y.M.M.’s mental \n19  health condition has deteriorated, affecting her ability to think, concentrate, focus, \n20  and communicate. Y.M.M. has a traumatic disorder that is being diagnosed, which \n21  causes her to experience scattered thinking. These limitations mean that Y.M.M. is \n22  struggling to understand and prepare for her immigration case.  \n23  149.  Furthermore,  as  Defendants  placed  them  into  separate  removal \n24  proceedings, J.C.M.M., as a six-year old with uncontrolled epilepsy and asthma, will \n25  likely  be  forced  to  attend  any  hearing  alone,  without  the  support  of  Y.M.M. \n26  J.C.M.M.’s seizure condition is currently poorly controlled, creating a risk that she \n27  will have a seizure while waiting for a hearing, on the way to a hearing, or during a \n28  hearing.  This  would  preclude  meaningful  participation  in  their  case  and  puts \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n31 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  J.C.M.M.’s health in grave danger.   \n2  12.   G.F.F. \n3  150.  Since around July 2019, Defendants have forcibly kept G.F.F., a thirty-\n4  eight-year-old man, in Tijuana, Mexico under the MPP. \n5  151.  G.F.F. is a victim of torture, which occurred while in his home country. \n6  He has been diagnosed with depression and suffers from insomnia and traumatic \n7  nightmares. These conditions significantly impair his ability to think, concentrate, \n8  and sleep. \n9  152.  In or around July 2019, Defendants detained G.F.F. His initial detention \n10  by Defendants resurfaced the trauma of his past torture.  \n11  153.  Defendants placed G.F.F. into the MPP. He was never given a chance \n12  to understand the determination, appeal the decision, or contact a lawyer. \n13  154.  G.F.F. attended one court hearing for his immigration case.  For his \n14  following hearing, he was not given special transport instructions needed to be \n15  transported to his hearing, so he was not allowed to enter the United States to attend \n16  court. In his absence, he was ordered removed. This led to his detention by Mexican \n17  authorities. \n18  155.  On or around February 25, 2020, G.F.F. was re-detained by Mexican \n19  officials and held for about twenty-five days.  Because he had been tortured in \n20  detention by his home country’s government, this experience again traumatized him. \n21  He asked to see a physician and tried to show his documentation for his prescriptions \n22  and diagnoses unsuccessfully. G.F.F. was seen by a physician only towards the end \n23  of his detention, around the twenty-third or twenty-fourth day of detention. The \n24  physician referred him to a psychiatrist, but G.F.F. was released before he could see \n25  a psychiatrist in detention. \n26  156.  G.F.F.’s  disability,  known  to  the  Defendants,  prevents  him  from \n27  meaningfully participating in his immigration proceedings because the trauma of his \n28  torture in detention by government officials is aggravated by the repeated detention \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n32 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  and interaction with CBP officers that the MPP court involves.  \n2  13.   M.Y.J.L. \n3  157.  Since on or around March 13, 2020, Defendants have forcibly kept \n4  M.Y.J.L., a thirty-four-year-old woman, in Tijuana, Mexico, with her husband under \n5  the MPP. \n6  158.  She  suffers  from  fibroids  and  endometriosis.  Her  fibroids  and \n7  endometriosis cause her debilitating pain and protracted menstrual bleeding. Her \n8  condition is worsening and, in transit to the border with the United States, Mexican \n9  agency workers referred her to specialist care.  However, she has not been able to \n10  pursue this or obtain the care that she needs.  \n11  159.  On or around March 13, 2020, M.Y.J.L. and her husband were detained \n12  by the Defendants.  M.Y.J.L., who is only fluent in Spanish, tried to make Defendants \n13  aware of her disability but Defendant did not provide a Spanish-fluent agent nor an \n14  interpreter.  Defendants did not otherwise seek to engage meaningfully with M.Y.J.L. \n15  in discussing her disability.  \n16  160.   Defendants placed M.Y.J.L. into the MPP. She was never given a \n17  chance to understand the determination, appeal the decision, or contact a lawyer. \n18  Nevertheless, Defendants forcibly returned M.Y.J.L. and her husband to Mexico.  \n19  161.  M.Y.J.L. has been unable to obtain the care she needs since she was \n20  placed in MPP and her condition is getting worse. The protracted bleeding makes her \n21  feel weak and her pain is debilitating and worsening. This pain is such that it would \n22  prevent her from being able to prepare for her hearings or participate in them while \n23  she is suffering such pain. Her weakness from her bleeding prevents her from being \n24  able to take the steps she needs to prepare for her hearings or proceedings or take \n25  steps in her case at times that she is not feeling pain.  \n26  14. M.M.G.  \n27  162.  Since on or about September 26, 2019, Defendants have forced M.M.G. \n28  and his mother, father, and sister, to remain in Mexico under the MPP. \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n33 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  163.  Plaintiff M.M.G. is a 16-year-old boy, suffering from a brain injury \n2  following  surgery  to  reconstruct  a  brain  blood  vessel.  He  experiences  painful \n3  headaches, impaired memory, and confusion. M.M.G.’s brain injury significantly \n4  impairs his ability to think, communicate, and focus as well as his brain functions.  \n5  164.  On or around September 19, 2019, Defendants took him and his family, \n6  his mother, father, and sister, into detention. While in detention, his mother, V.A.G., \n7  notified Defendants of M.M.G.’s brain condition and his need for medical care. \n8  165.  Defendants placed M.M.G. and his family into the MPP. They were \n9  never given a chance to understand the determination, appeal the decision, or contact \n10  a lawyer. Defendants forcibly returned the family to Mexico. \n11  166.  M.M.G. may be sixteen-years old, but his family has to watch him \n12  closely due to his condition: he is easily confused, experiences headaches, and has \n13  memory problems. Caring for M.M.G. in MPP takes up much of the family’s time \n14  and attention, making it difficult to concentrate on his, and their own, claims before \n15  the immigration court. \n16  15.   D.Y.S. \n17  167.  Since November 2019, Defendants have forcibly kept D.Y.S., a nine-\n18  year-old  indigenous  child,  and  his  mother,  M.S.S.,  in  the  MPP  in  Matamoros, \n19  Mexico.  \n20  168.  D.Y.S. has three long-diagnosed disabilities: epilepsy, autism spectrum \n21  disorder, and hyperactivity. D.Y.S.’s disabilities substantially impair his ability to \n22  learn, and he depends heavily on his mother even for daily life tasks. D.Y.S. needs \n23  M.S.S.’s support to care for himself and eat. These disabilities also severely affect \n24  D.Y.S.’s immune system. His disabilities are documented and easily observable. \n25  169.  Defendants took M.S.S. and D.Y.S. into custody sometime in August \n26  2019. Defendants were aware of D.Y.S.’s disability. While in CBP custody, M.S.S. \n27  told CBP agents that D.Y.S. had a medical condition and that he needed medicine. \n28  She provided medical documentation that explained D.Y.S.’s diagnosed disabilities \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n34 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  and resulting medical needs.  \n2  170.  Instead of providing medical assistance, CBP agents said that D.Y.S. \n3  was “special” and instructed other people not to touch him. While detained in the \n4  hielera and without adequate care, D.Y.S.’s health rapidly deteriorated so that D.Y.S. \n5  had a severe seizure and had to be hospitalized. Nevertheless, agents returned D.Y.S. \n6  to  the  same  conditions  that  caused  his  hospitalization  and  failed  to  provide \n7  medication as directed by doctors. \n8  171.  Prior to returning them to Mexico, an officer interviewed M.S.S. over \n9  the telephone. She discussed her fear of returning to Mexico and D.Y.S.’s medical \n10  conditions. Despite medical documentation, the officer refused to believe that D.Y.S. \n11  had medical conditions. On or around the time of this interview, officials decided to \n12  place M.S.S. and D.Y.S. in the MPP and return them to Mexico. M.S.S. was never \n13  given a chance to understand the determination, appeal the decision, or contact a \n14  lawyer. \n15  172.  Upon seeing the bridge, M.S.S. frantically begged the officers not to \n16  return her, saying that she was afraid to go to Mexico, especially due to the violence \n17  and D.Y.S.’s recent hospitalization and poor health. Despite this, agents forcibly sent \n18  M.S.S. and D.Y.S. to Mexico pursuant to the MPP. \n19  173.  On the day after their first immigration court hearing, D.Y.S. was again \n20  hospitalized. The doctors gave D.Y.S. some medicine and released him. Soon after \n21  his release, M.S.S. approached the international bridge and asked CBP to re-assess \n22  their placement in the MPP. D.Y.S. was weak from his hospitalization and needed \n23  help walking. Without providing paperwork or a reason for the decision, the agent \n24  told M.S.S. that D.Y.S. was fine, implying that the agent was refusing the request for \n25  redetermination. The agent never informed M.S.S. or D.Y.S. about any right to \n26  appeal the determination.  \n27  174.  M.S.S.  and  D.Y.S.,  along  with  an  attorney,  made  two  additional \n28  attempts to request parole but were denied in the same manner: without a record of \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n35 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  the denial or any information about the reason for the denial or appeals process. \n2  175.  D.Y.S.’s  limitations  affect  M.S.S.’s  ability  to  prepare  for  their \n3  immigration hearing. The medical support that D.Y.S. needs for any type of stability \n4  is completely out of reach while M.S.S. and D.Y.S. are in the MPP. Without stability, \n5  M.S.S. must constantly attend to D.Y.S.’s health and safety; she has no time or \n6  resources to work on their asylum case. Despite M.S.S.’s best efforts, every day poses \n7  risks to D.Y.S.’s health. \n8  176.  D.Y.S.’s  limitations  impact  M.S.S.’s  ability  to  participate  in  their \n9  immigration hearings. At the tent court, Defendants employees or subcontractors \n10  refuse to take care of D.Y.S. due to his disability, telling M.S.S. that she had best \n11  keep him. Defendants’ employees do not make accommodations for food appropriate \n12  for D.Y.S.’s dietary needs, causing D.Y.S. to further struggle. During court hearings, \n13  M.S.S. must pay attention to managing D.Y.S. while trying to answer the judge, \n14  which can cause her to struggle to speak with the judge and makes her feel flustered. \n15  16.   S.M.A. \n16  177.  Defendants forcibly returned a child with disabilities, S.M.A., and her \n17  mother to Matamoros, Mexico pursuant to the MPP.  \n18  178.  S.M.A. has lissencephaly, a condition caused by the brain’s failing to \n19  develop normal deep grooves and ridges, which means that she will likely live to be \n20  only ten years old. As a result, S.M.A. has seizures and is severely developmentally \n21  impaired. This disability substantially impairs major life activities, such as caring for \n22  herself, eating, speaking, learning, concentrating, and communicating. Her disability \n23  affects major bodily functions such as bowel and bladder functions, as well as \n24  neurological, brain, and respiratory functions. S.M.A.’s mother, K.A.M., provides \n25  S.M.A. with constant assistance and care. \n26  179.  On  or  about  August  2019,  S.M.A.  and  her  mother  K.A.M.  were \n27  apprehended by Defendants, who sent them to a hielera. \n28  180.  Defendants are aware of S.M.A.’s disability. Immediately after being \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n36 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  apprehended,  K.A.M.  told  CBP  agents  about  S.M.A.’s  disability  and  need  for \n2  medication, showing them her medical documentation and medication. At that time, \n3  CBP refused to provide S.M.A. with the necessary medical care or treatment. \n4  181.  While at the hielera, K.A.M. repeatedly told Defendants about S.M.A.’s \n5  condition and need for medication. Although Defendants finally brought medicine, \n6  K.A.M. later discovered that agents were providing medication to S.M.A. were not \n7  in  accordance  with  the  medical  documentation  and  inappropriate  for  S.M.A.’s \n8  condition. In these conditions, S.M.A.’s health deteriorated.  \n9  182.  Although aware of S.M.A.’s disability, Defendants placed K.A.M. and \n10  her daughter to the MPP. On information and belief, Defendants never asked, or in \n11  any way investigated, if K.A.M. or her daughter were afraid to be sent to Mexico.  \n12  183.  Defendants provided no notice of decision, opportunity to appeal the \n13  decision, or chance to speak with a lawyer. Indeed, K.A.M. did not realize she and \n14  her daughter were being sent to Mexico until the bus arrived at the Brownsville-\n15  Matamoros bridge. K.A.M. repeatedly explained to CBP officers about S.M.A.’s \n16  conditions and the need for proper medication and their fear of Mexico. Instead of \n17  providing any process for appeal, or re-determination, the CBP officers answered that \n18  they did not care and that K.A.M. and S.M.A. were not welcome in the United States. \n19  184.  While living in Mexico under the MPP, S.M.A.’s health has further \n20  deteriorated,  causing  her  be  hospitalized.  K.A.M.  often  cannot  obtain  S.M.A.’s \n21  necessary  medications  on  time  or,  sometimes,  at  all.  Due  to  S.M.A.’s  medical \n22  conditions, K.A.M. does not believe her daughter would survive contracting COVID-\n23  19.  \n24  185.  CBP agents refused to re-evaluate S.M.A.’s placement in the MPP. \n25  K.A.M. and S.M.A. have gone twice to the Brownsville-Matamoros Bridge with \n26  documentation of S.M.A.’s medical condition. Although they waited hours each time \n27  for a decision, Defendants’ employees returned them without providing notice or a \n28  rationale for the decision or an opportunity to appeal the decision. \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n37 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  186.  Due to S.M.A.’s need for care in the conditions of Matamoros, K.A.M. \n2  has struggled to prepare for their immigration proceedings. She cannot leave S.M.A. \n3  alone and must continuously worry about S.M.A.’s medication. This interferes with \n4  K.A.M.’s time and focus to work on their immigration case, like focusing on tasks \n5  such as compiling evidence, completing paperwork, and consulting with her attorney.  \n6  187.  S.M.A.’s  disability  has  severely  impacted  K.A.M.’s  ability  to \n7  participate in their immigration proceedings. As K.A.M. cannot find anyone who can \n8  properly care for S.M.A. due to her disabilities, K.A.M. has had to take S.M.A. to \n9  their immigration court hearing all three times. When K.A.M. tries to speak with the \n10  judge, S.M.A. yells, tries to get up, or talks about random things, including to the \n11  judge, distracting K.A.M. and the judge. During the most recent hearing, S.M.A. had \n12  a seizure as they waited for the court. Right after S.M.A. regained consciousness, \n13  K.A.M. was forced to enter the room for her immigration hearing. She was so worried \n14  about S.M.A. that she could not answer the judge’s questions. \n15  17 & 18. D.G.M. and N.R.R. \n16  188.  Defendants forcibly sent D.G.M. and his family, including wife N.R.R., \n17  to Matamoros, Mexico pursuant to the MPP.  \n18  189.  D.G.M. has two heart conditions, including hypertension and a growth \n19  on his heart. D.G.M.’s medical conditions cause extreme spikes in his blood pressure \n20  that sometimes require hospitalization. These conditions substantially limit major life \n21  activities, such as breathing, performing manual tasks, and working, and major bodily \n22  functions, such as respiratory and circulatory functions. \n23  190.  On July 26, 2019, Defendants took D.G.M. and his family into custody. \n24  191.  Defendants knew of D.G.M.’s disability because he was hospitalized in \n25  custody when his blood pressure spiked dangerously high on July 27, 2019. \n26  192.  Despite  D.G.M.’s  disability,  Defendants  subjected  D.G.M.  and  his \n27  family in the MPP. When he came back from the hospital, Defendants’ employees \n28  handed  D.G.M.  and  his  family  documents  in  English,  even  though  no  one  in \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n38 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  D.G.M.’s family is able to read or speak English. Defendants did not read or explain \n2  the paperwork or the family’s rights. Instead, without explanation, they demanded \n3  that the family sign the documents.  \n4  193.  D.G.M. pleaded with the agents that he could not go back to Mexico due \n5  to his health issues. Instead of providing a process for appeal, or re-determination, \n6  the agents returned D.G.M. and his family to Mexico. \n7  194.  In the MPP, D.G.M.’s health continues to worsen. He now regularly has \n8  dangerously elevated blood pressure and difficulty breathing. D.G.M. has needed \n9  medical attention multiple times. On one occasion, the entire left side of his body \n10  went numb and he fainted; nevertheless, the hospital refused to treat him. Given his \n11  current heart issues, his doctor has informed D.G.M. that his health is at greater risk \n12  of severe complications and possible death from COVID-19. \n13  195.  D.G.M.’s heart conditions interfere with his ability to prepare for his \n14  immigration case. Due to the severity of his impairments and limits of treatment, he \n15  must monitor and care for his health. Therefore, he cannot devote sufficient efforts \n16  to  such  matters  such  as  gathering  information,  compiling  evidence,  filling  out \n17  documents, and consulting with attorneys. \n18  196.  D.G.M.’s heart conditions interfere with his ability to participate in his \n19  immigration case. While in the MPP, D.G.M. and his family have attended five \n20  immigration hearings. Each time they attend court, a doctor checks the blood pressure \n21  of each family member. D.G.M. often has chest pains on days he has a hearing. The \n22  doctor informs D.G.M. each time that, if his blood pressure is too high, he will not \n23  be permitted to attend the hearing, and his court hearing will be rescheduled for a \n24  later date. As D.G.M.’s health worsens, the chances increase that he will have high \n25  blood pressure on a court date and be forced to wait for months longer for the next \n26  stage in his proceedings. \n27  197.  N.R.R. is impacted by her husband’s disability. She must devote time \n28  and energy to caring for D.G.M.’s deteriorating health, leaving her with little time or \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n39 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  energy to prepare the entire family’s immigration claims. Furthermore, every time \n2  they attend court, N.R.R. worries both about her husband’s health and that the \n3  family’s hearing will be re-set due to D.G.M.’s conditions. This distracts her from \n4  meaningfully participating in the proceedings.   \n5  19 & 20. H.H.M. and E.H.M. \n6  198.  Defendants forcibly sent H.H.M., his older sister E.H.M., and his niece \n7  to Matamoros, Mexico pursuant to the MPP.  \n8  199.  H.H.M. is a twenty-year-old individual who is Deaf. H.H.M. does not \n9  know standard sign language, but communicates in “home sign,” meaning a sign \n10  language that he and E.H.M. have developed together. As a result, H.H.M. relies \n11  entirely on his sister to translate what other people say to him and to relay his thoughts \n12  to other hearing people. H.H.M. is therefore substantially limited in his ability to \n13  communicate. H.H.M.’s Deafness is apparent to anyone who interacts with him.  \n14  200.  On or around March 17, 2020, H.H.M., his sister and niece were taken \n15  into custody by Defendants.  \n16  201.  Defendants knew of H.H.M.’s disability. As they were being taken into \n17  custody, one of the agents asked E.H.M. why H.H.M. came to the United States if he \n18  could not communicate with anyone. \n19  202.  At the hielera, agents separated H.H.M. from E.H.M—the only person \n20  with whom he could communicate. E.H.M. explained three times to officers that \n21  H.H.M.  could  not  hear  or  speak  and  that  she  was  the  only  person  that  could \n22  communicate with him. One agent responded that, if that was the case, H.H.M. \n23  should not have come to the United States, effectively denying E.H.M.’s request for \n24  an accommodation. Instead, federal officials kept H.H.M. separated from the sole \n25  person with whom he could communicate for days. E.H.M. was extremely worried \n26  about her brother the entire time that she was detained. \n27  203.  After about two days, agents decided to place E.H.M. and her daughter, \n28  H.H.M.’s niece in the MPP and return them to Mexico. They never permitted H.H.M. \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n40 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  to see his sister or communicate about what was happening prior to forcibly returning \n2  E.H.M. to Mexico. E.H.M. was never given an interview or a notification that she \n3  had been placed in MPP, let alone a chance to appeal. \n4  204.  Although Defendants knew H.H.M. was deaf, they never provided an \n5  interpreter  and  did  not  inquire  if  he  had  any  needs  that  he  could  not  verbally \n6  communicate to them. They never even permitted E.H.M. to be present or translate \n7  in any interview.  \n8  205.  On information and belief, without using an interpreter to determine \n9  H.H.M.’s fears about return to his home country or Mexico, Defendants decided to \n10  place H.H.M. in the MPP and forcibly returned him to Mexico. Defendants never \n11  provided chance to understand the determination, appeal the decision, or contact a \n12  lawyer. \n13  206.  E.H.M. was also forcibly returned to MPP, and was able to find and \n14  reunite  with  H.H.M.  because  she  repeatedly  spoke  with  Mexican  immigration \n15  officers to see if he had been returned. She found out that H.H.M. had initially been \n16  bused to southern Mexico, hours by bus from where E.H.M. was forced to stay. Only \n17  after the intervention of private Mexican citizens, the two were able to reunite. \n18  207.  H.H.M. cannot effectively prepare for his immigration proceedings in \n19  Matamoros,  Mexico.  H.H.M.  is  overwhelmed,  stressed,  and  worried  about  the \n20  dangers and difficulties posed by his disability in Matamoros, ranging from difficulty \n21  communicating with aid providers to high risk of being kidnapped. H.H.M. worries \n22  that, if anything were to happen to E.H.M., he would be unable to communicate with \n23  the world. If H.H.M. were kidnapped—a common occurrence for those Defendant \n24  has returned to Mexico—he would not be able to provide even basic information to \n25  possible kidnappers for his ransom. Especially with the risks of COVID-19, without \n26  E.H.M., H.H.M. will struggle to communicate if he has any medical issues. As his \n27  time and energy is focused on survival, he is not able to adequately focus on tasks \n28  such as collecting information and preparing documents.  \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n41 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  208.  After seven months, H.H.M. has not yet had a first immigration court \n2  hearing. However, his case is separate from that of his sister. There is no indication \n3  that Defendants will provide an interpreter or other effective form of communication \n4  as part of that hearing, at the bridge, or in any interactions while he is present in the \n5  United  States  for  court.  Absent  such  assistance,  H.H.M.  will  not  be  able  to \n6  meaningfully participate in his court hearings and will be denied the opportunity to \n7  communicate his fears of returning to his home country or remaining in Mexico. \n8  209.  E.H.M. is constantly worried about her brother. She must constantly stay \n9  close to H.H.M. to ensure that he is not attacked or otherwise harmed. In order for \n10  him to communicate with anyone, even the humanitarian organizations, she must be \n11  present to translate for him. E.H.M. has spent most of her time and energy ensuring \n12  that H.H.M. and her child are safe and cared for. She has tried to help with her \n13  brother’s immigration case, but she is unsure whether she will be able to attend his \n14  hearing to translate. Due to the energy that she spends on her brother’s care and case, \n15  E.H.M. does not have sufficient time or energy to prepare for her own case.  \n16  21. C.J.V.C. \n17  210.  Defendants  forcibly  sent  a  child  with  disabilities,  C.J.V.C,  and  his \n18  mother, to Matamoros, Mexico pursuant to the MPP.  \n19  211.  At thirteen-years old, C.J.V.C. was in a major accident and doctors had \n20  to amputate his left leg above the knee. As a result, C.J.V.C.’s mobility impairment \n21  substantially limits his ability to perform major life activities, including caring for \n22  himself, performing manual tasks, walking, standing, lifting, and bending.  \n23  212.  In September 2019, Defendants took C.J.V.C. and his mother. M.C., \n24  into custody. \n25  213.  Defendants detained them in a hielera for about a week. Defendants \n26  knew about C.J.V.C.’S disability because M.C. made multiple requests that agents \n27  provide C.J.V.C. with medical attention due to pain associated with his amputation. \n28  However, agents refused to provide him with any assistance. \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n42 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  214.  Despite C.J.V.C.’s disability, Defendants placed C.J.V.C. and M.C. in \n2  the MPP. Neither received interviews. They were never given a chance to understand \n3  the determination, appeal the decision, or contact a lawyer. Indeed, neither knew that \n4  they would be returned to Mexico until Defendants’ employees walked them up to \n5  the bridge to Mexico. \n6  215.  Since CBP agents sent them to Mexico, C.J.V.C. and M.C. are forced to \n7  live in a crowded shelter with limited access to sufficient food and resources.  \n8  216.  C.J.V.C.’s mobility impairments also impact he and his mother’s ability \n9  to prepare for immigration hearings. For example, C.V.J.C. and M.C. depend on a \n10  volunteer lawyer to prepare their case. However, the only lawyer they can find does \n11  not have accessible facilities. Therefore, it is difficult for C.V.J.C. to be in a private \n12  space to privately consult with the attorney.  \n13  217.  C.J.V.C.’s mobility impairments also impact their ability to participate \n14  in immigration hearings. It is difficult for C.J.V.C. to travel to hearings. As his only \n15  set of crutches are currently broken, M.C. is unsure how they will even make it to \n16  court hearings. They have attended court hearings twice in a makeshift tent court. It \n17  is dangerous for C.J.V.C. to maneuver the court in his crutches due to uneven floors \n18  and inclines. Therefore, M.C. arrives at the hearing only after spending the entire trip \n19  worrying about whether her son will be hurt because the trip to and the hearing rooms \n20  themselves are inaccessible for him. In one hearing, after expressing her concern for \n21  her son, M.C. has broken down crying when trying to discuss her son’s disability \n22  with the judge, which interferes with her ability to discuss her case. \n23  22.  La.V.S.O. \n24  218.  Defendants forcibly sent La.V.S.O., a child with disabilities, and her \n25  family to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico pursuant to the MPP. \n26  219.  La.V.S.O. has congenital hydrocephalus, which causes a build-up of \n27  fluid around her brain and spinal cord and requires continuous, specialized medical \n28  treatment. This condition causes her to have to seizures, developmental delay, and \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n43 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  brain damage. These impairments substantially limit major life functions, such as \n2  caring for herself and thinking, and major bodily functions, including neurological \n3  and brain functions. \n4  220.  In February 2020, Defendants took La.V.S.O., her mother, and her \n5  siblings into custody.  \n6  221.  Defendants  were  aware  of  La.V.S.O.’s  disabilities,  as  her  mother, \n7  A.A.F.S.O. repeatedly attempted to show La.V.S.O.’s medical documentation to \n8  Defendants. Defendants’ medical personnel also diagnosed La.V.S.O.’s condition. A \n9  doctor placed a bracelet on her showing that she had a special condition. Defendants’ \n10  agents saw the bracelet and made A.A.F.S.O. remove the medical bracelet. CBP \n11  agents knew La.V.S.O. needed medication but threw away both the prescriptions and \n12  the medications. \n13  222.  On information or belief, around this time, Defendants decided to place \n14  La.V.S.O. and her family in the MPP. They did not receive interviews. The family \n15  was never given a chance to understand the determination, appeal the decision, or \n16  contact a lawyer. \n17  223.  Instead, after a few weeks in the hielera, agents placed the family on a \n18  bus. Once boarded, agents told the family that they were going to be sent back to \n19  Mexico. They were not given an opportunity to explain why they could not return to \n20  Mexico.  \n21  224.  La.V.S.O.  and  her  family  have  twice  approached  the  international \n22  bridge in Juarez to try to explain to agents that they cannot be in Mexico. On one \n23  occasion, a doctor at the bridge examined La.V.S.O. and determined that she required \n24  special medical treatment. Officers still sent the family back to Mexico. Due to their \n25  treatment, the children have become so scared of the immigration officers, causing \n26  them to beg A.A.F.S.O. not to go to the bridge.  \n27  225.  A.A.F.S.O. is forced to live with her children in a crowded shelter with \n28  little in the way of precautionary measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n44 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  including to La.V.S.O., who could face dire consequences if infected. Without a \n2  support system in Mexico, and due to La.V.S.O.’s medical condition, A.A.F.S.O. \n3  must spend a significant amount of time watching over La.V.S.O. and her siblings. \n4  A.A.F.S.O. reports that she must keep constant watch over La.V.S.O. for fear that \n5  she will fall due to issues with her coordination caused by her brain condition. \n6  A.A.F.S.O. is left with little time or energy to focus on activities such as reviewing \n7  documents or consulting with her attorney, making her unable to properly prepare for \n8  the entire family’s immigration case. \n9  23. Plaintiff Al Otro Lado \n10  226.  Al Otro Lado is a binational immigrants’ rights advocacy nonprofit \n11  organization. Al Otro Lado provides legal orientation and other services to large \n12  numbers of migrants at the border between the United States and Mexico, including \n13  individuals with disabilities subjected to the MPP. Al Otro Lado advocates for such \n14  disabled individuals by giving them legal orientation and, in certain cases, direct \n15  representation, as well as by making parole requests on their behalf or otherwise \n16  advocating for them to be taken out of the MPP and paroled into the United States. \n17  Al Otro Lado was incorporated at 4843 Slauson Ave., Maywood, California 90270-\n18  3018, and has offices in Los Angeles, San Diego, and Tijuana. \n19  227.  The Defendants’ actions in failing to follow the law and their own \n20  internal guidelines to exempt the Plaintiffs and their families from MPP has diverted \n21  the organization’s time and resources. Al Otro Lado has needed to engage workers \n22  to assist with social care and provide special assistance for particularly vulnerable \n23  individuals who often face more problems in their immigration proceedings because \n24  of their vulnerability, whether it is due to inability to obtain or prepare documents, or \n25  a higher likelihood of being kidnapped or missing court hearings. This means that Al \n26  Otro Lado’s ability to carry out its organizational mission to provide assistance to \n27  indigent individuals on both sides of the border between Mexico and the United \n28  States  is  undermined  by  Defendants’  placing  avoidable  obstacles  in  their  path, \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n45 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  limiting the amount of time and resources that could otherwise go to serving a wider \n2  population better and with more services.  \n3  V.  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n4  228.  The named Plaintiffs seek certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the \n5  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure of the following three classes:  \n6  The “Accardi class,” consisting of all people (1) who have been or will be \nplaced in the Migrant Protection Protocols program, and (2) who have known \n7  physical or mental health issues for purposes of the Physical/Mental Health \nExclusion;  \n8   \nThe “Section 504 class,” consisting of all qualified people with a disability \n9  under the Rehabilitation Act who have been, or will be, denied meaningful \nparticipation in Section 240 proceedings, properly initiated or not, because \n10  they are placed in the MPP; and \n \n11  The “Family Member class,” consisting of the members of the family unit of \neach Section 504 class member, who are also seeking admission from CBP \n12  and who are placed in Section 240 proceedings, properly initiated or not. \n13  229.  All three putative classes seek certification of claims for declaratory \n14  relief and injunctive relief. \n15  230.  Named  Plaintiffs  E.A.R.R.,  G.S.E.R.,  L.Y.G.,  H.A.H.G.,  Y.J.C.E., \n16  S.F.L., C.J.M.L., Y.M.M., J.C.M.M., G.F.F., M.Y.J.L., M.M.G., D.Y.S., S.M.A., \n17  D.G.M., H.H.M., C.J.V.C., La.V.S.O. are representatives of the Accardi and Section \n18  504 classes (the “Accardi/Section 504 class representatives”) and Named Plaintiffs \n19  B.A.E.R., J.A.E.M., N.R.R., and E.H.M. are representatives of the Family Member \n20  class (the “Family Member class representatives”).  \n21  231.  The Accardi class, the Section 504 class, and the Family Member class \n22  are each so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. The exact number \n23  of people with disabilities or physical and mental health issues who have, or will be, \n24  returned to Mexico pursuant to the MPP is unknown because Defendants do not \n25  adequately screen and track such individuals with disabilities. Based on estimates \n26  from service organizations that assist asylum-seekers along the U.S.-Mexico border, \n27  Plaintiffs reasonably believe there are at least hundreds of individuals in the classes. \n28  Plaintiff Al Otro Lado alone currently serves more than forty individuals who are \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n46 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  themselves disabled or seriously ill, approximately, and more than twenty individuals \n2  who are family members or care for disabled or seriously ill individuals.  \n3  232.  Other factors establish the numerosity requirement, including that the \n4  classes consist of numerous individuals who are geographically diverse and who are \n5  unlikely to be able to bring individual suits, and that the classes include future, \n6  unknowable class members. \n7  233.  There are questions of law and fact common to the members of the \n8  Accardi Class. Such questions include, but are not limited to:  \n9  a.  Whether  Defendants  have  a  policy  the  Physical/Mental  Health \n10  Exclusion pursuant to which people with known physical or mental \n11  health  issues  are  supposed  to  be  excluded  from  the  MPP  and  not \n12  returned to Mexico; \n13  b.  What mechanisms, if any, Defendants have in place to ensure that the \n14  Physical/Mental Health Exclusion is carried out on the ground; \n15  c.  Whether people with known physical or mental health issues have been \n16  returned  to  Mexico  pursuant  to  the  MPP  notwithstanding  the \n17  Physical/Mental Health Exclusion;  \n18  d.  If so, whether this violates the Accardi doctrine; and \n19  e.  Whether, if members of the Accardi class prevail on their claim, the \n20  relief should include requiring Defendants to admit members of the \n21  family unit of each class member pursuant to the Family Unit Policy and \n22  relevant injunctions. \n23  234.  There are questions of law and fact common to the members of the \n24  Section 504 class. These questions include, but are not limited to: \n25  a.  Whether Section 240 proceedings constitute a program or activity of the \n26  federal government; \n27  b.  Whether Section 504 obligates Defendants to put in place practices and \n28  procedures to identify members of the Section 504 class, and to assess \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n47 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  those people as to the need for accommodations in order to meaningfully \n2  participate in Section 240 proceedings;  \n3  c.  Whether placing members of the Section 504 class in the MPP, and \n4  returning them to Mexico, violates DHS regulations by affording such \n5  class members an opportunity to participate in or benefit from Section \n6  240 proceedings that is not equal to that afforded to others; \n7  d.  Whether placing members of the Section 504 class in the MPP, and \n8  returning them to Mexico, violates DHS regulations by providing those \n9  class  members  with  a  benefit  or  service  that  is  not  as  effective  in \n10  affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result as that provided to \n11  others;  \n12  e.  Whether Defendants violate DHS regulations by utilizing criteria or \n13  methods of administration the purpose or effect of which is to subject \n14  members of the Section 504 class to discrimination, or that defeat or \n15  substantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of Section 240 \n16  proceedings;  \n17  f.  Whether placing members of the Section 504 class in the MPP and \n18  returning  them  to  Mexico  denies  them  meaningful  participation  in \n19  Section 240 proceedings; and \n20  g.  Whether excluding people with disabilities from the MPP, which would \n21  be  in  keeping  with  Defendants’  Physical/Mental  Health  Exclusion, \n22  constitutes a reasonable accommodation. \n23  235.  There are questions of law and fact common to the members of the \n24  Family Member Class. Such questions include, but are not limited to: \n25  a.  Whether people with an association to a person with a disability, and \n26  who are injured based on discrimination against that person with a \n27  disability, have a claim under the Rehabilitation Act; \n28  b.  Whether family members have been injured based on their association \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n48 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  with members of the Section 504 class; and \n2  c.  If so, what is the appropriate relief. \n3  236.  Defendants are expected to raise common defenses to the claims of each \n4  class, including denying that their actions violate the law. \n5  237.  The claims of the Accardi/Section 504 class representatives are typical \n6  of those of the Accardi Class, as each Accardi/Section 504 class representative, like \n7  each member of the proposed Accardi class, has a known physical or mental health \n8  issue; each Accardi/Section 504 class representative’s claim arises from the same \n9  policies, practices, or courses of conduct as those of the class; and their claims are \n10  based on the same theory of law as the class’s claims. \n11  238.  The claims of the Accardi/Section 504 are typical of those of the Section \n12  504  class, as each Accardi/Section 504  class  representative  has  a disability  for \n13  purposes of the Rehabilitation Act; each Accardi/Section 504 class representative’s \n14  claim arises from the same policies, practices, or courses of conduct as those of the \n15  class; and their claims are based on the same theory of law as the Section 504 class’s \n16  claims. \n17  239.  The claims of the Family Member class representatives are typical of \n18  those of the Family Member class, as each Family Member class representative has \n19  an  association  with  a  person  with  a  disability;  each  Family  Member  class \n20  representative’s claim arises from the same policies, practices, or courses of conduct \n21  as those of the class; and their claims are based on the same theory of law as the \n22  Family Member class’s claims. \n23  240.  The representative Plaintiffs for each putative class are capable of fairly \n24  and adequately protecting the interests of the members of each class because the \n25  representative  Plaintiffs  do  not  have  any  interests  antagonistic  to  the  classes. \n26  Plaintiffs, as well as the members of the classes, seek to enjoin the unlawful acts and \n27  omissions of Defendants. Finally, Plaintiffs are represented by counsel experienced \n28  in civil rights litigation, litigation regarding the rights of detained individuals and \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n49 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  individuals  with  disabilities,  working  with  individuals  placed  in  the  MPP,  and \n2  complex class action litigation. \n3  241.  This action is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n4  23(b)(2) because Defendants’ policies, practices, actions, and omissions that form \n5  the basis of this Complaint are common to and apply generally to all members of \n6  each putative class, and the injunctive and declaratory relief sought is appropriate \n7  and will apply to all members of the respective class(es). Defendants’ MPP policies \n8  are  centrally  promulgated,  disseminated,  and  enforced.  The  injunctive  and \n9  declaratory  relief  sought  is  appropriate  and  will  apply  to  all  members  of  the \n10  respective class(es). \n11  VI.  CAUSES OF ACTION \n12  COUNT I \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act/Accardi Doctrine on behalf of \n13  the Accardi class) \n14  242.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though \n15  fully set forth herein. \n16  243.  The APA provides that courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside \n17  agency action” that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not \n18  in accordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), or “without observance of procedure \n19  required by law,” id. § 706(2)(D). The Accardi doctrine requires that agencies follow \n20  their own regulations, policies, and procedures. See United States ex rel. Accardi v. \n21  Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954). \n22  244.  Defendants’ Physical/Mental Health Exclusion policy exempts people \n23  with known physical or mental health issues from the MPP.  \n24  245.  In spite of this, Defendants placed, and continue to place, individuals \n25  with known physical or mental health issues in the MPP.  \n26  246.  Defendants placed the Accardi/Section 504 class representatives in the \n27  MPP even though Defendants knew of those representatives' medical issues. For \n28  example, Defendants were aware of D.Y.S. and D.G.M.’s medical issues because \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n50 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  each of these individuals was hospitalized due to these known medical issues while \n2  in Defendants’ custody. Regardless, Defendants placed each individual in the MPP \n3  shortly after their release from the hospital.  \n4  247.  Similarly, Defendants were also aware of other Accardi/Section 504 \n5  class representatives’ various medical issues because each provided Defendants with \n6  proof of these medical issues. Plaintiffs presented medical records and prescribed \n7  medications, explained their disabilities, and asked for medical attention for their \n8  deteriorating condition while in Defendants’ custody. Defendants’ own medical team \n9  corroborated many of Plaintiffs’ medical issues and required Defendants to allow the \n10  Plaintiffs access to prescribed medications. Despite this, Defendants placed Plaintiffs \n11  in the MPP.  \n12  248.  By placing the Accardi/Section 504 class representatives and members \n13  of the Accardi class in the MPP, Defendants have violated their own policy, and thus \n14  run afoul of the Accardi doctrine, by not following their own policy. \n15  249.  As a result, Accardi/Section 504 class representatives and members of \n16  the Accardi class have been injured, and in the absence of judicial relief, this injury \n17  is ongoing and will continue. \nCOUNT II \n18  (Violation of the Rehabilitation Act on behalf of the Section 504 class) \n19  250.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though \n20  fully set forth herein. \n21  251.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”) provides that “no \n22  otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of his or \n23  her disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \n24  subjected to discrimination under . . . any program or activity conducted by any \n25  Executive agency . . . .” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n26  252.  Section  504  requires  covered  entities  to  provide  reasonable \n27  accommodations to qualified disabled individuals so that they can have meaningful \n28  access to programs and benefits provided by executive agencies.  \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n51 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  253.  DHS has promulgated regulations implementing the requirements of \n2  Section 504. These regulations prohibit, among other things, DHS and CBP from: \n3  affording a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity to participate in or \n4  benefit from a benefit or service “that is not equal to that afforded to others;” \n5  providing a qualified individual with a disability with a benefit or service “that is not \n6  as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result as that provided \n7  to others”; or utilizing criteria or methods of administration the purpose or effect of \n8  which would subject qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination or defeat \n9  or substantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity.” 6 \n10  C.F.R. § 15.30. \n11  254.  Section 240 proceedings, and determinations by DHS/CBP as to who \n12  will be returned to Mexico pending those proceedings, constitute a program, activity \n13  or benefit of the federal government. \n14  255.  Each of the Accardi/Section 504 class representatives is a qualified \n15  person with a disability for purposes of Section 504. \n16  256.  Defendants  have  violated  Section  504  by  returning  people  with \n17  disabilities  to  Mexico  pending  or  after  the  conclusion  of  their  Section  240 \n18  proceedings, whether or not properly initiated, because doing so: (i) denies people \n19  with disabilities meaningful access to those proceedings; (ii) does not afford them \n20  with an opportunity to participate in Section 240 proceedings that is equal to that \n21  afforded others; (iii) does not provide them with an opportunity to achieve the same \n22  result as others; and (iv) utilizes criteria or methods of administration the purpose or \n23  effect of which subject qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination and, \n24  thus, defeat or substantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of Section 240 \n25  proceedings.  \n26  257.  Defendants’  actions  are  also  contrary  to  Defendants’  own \n27  Physical/Mental Health Exclusion policy.  \n28  258.  As a result of Defendants’ actions as described herein, members of the \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n52 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  Section 504 class have been, and in the absence of judicial relief will continue to be, \n2  injured. \n3  259.  Putting in place mechanisms to ensure that Defendants follows their \n4  own Physical/Mental Health Exclusion policy and admit members of the Section 504 \n5  class into the United States who are currently in Mexico pursuant to the MPP, and in \n6  the future to not return Section 504 class members to Mexico, would constitute a \n7  reasonable accommodation, and is otherwise required by Section 504. \n8  260.  Similarly,  exempting  people  with  disabilities  from  the  MPP  and \n9  allowing those currently in Mexico to pursue their Section 240 proceedings from the \n10  United  States  would  constitute  a  reasonable  accommodation,  and  is  otherwise \n11  required by Section 504.  \n12  261.  Further,  in  accordance  with  CBP’s  Family  Unit  policy,  admitting \n13  members of the Family Member class, who provide support to Section 504 class \n14  members and allow such class members to meaningfully participate in Section 240 \n15  proceedings, is also a reasonable accommodation, and is otherwise required by \n16  Section 504. \n17  COUNT III \n(Violation of Rehabilitation Act on behalf of the Family Member class) \n18 \n19  262.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though \n20  fully set forth herein. \n21  263.  Each member of the Family Member class has an association with a \n22  person  with  a  disability  who  has  suffered  discrimination  in  violation  of  the \n23  Rehabilitation Act, as described above. \n24  264.  As  a  result  of  the  discrimination  suffered  by  their  disabled  family \n25  member, each member of the Family Member class has been injured because, for \n26  example and without limitation, rather than being able to prepare for their own \n27  Section 240 proceedings, they have had to focus on assisting and supporting their \n28  disabled family member and thus have not been able to meaningfully participate in \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n53 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  Section 240 proceedings. \n2  265.  If members of the Section 504 class are allowed to pursue their Section \n3  240 proceedings from the United States pursuant either to the Rehabilitation Act or \n4  in  compliance  with  Defendants’  Physical/Mental  Health  Exclusion  policy,  any \n5  Family Member class member who is forced to remain in Mexico will be unable to \n6  assist and support their disabled family member. Furthermore, a disabled family \n7  member may be essential to the proper development of a family member’s claim, \n8  leaving them unable to fully develop their claim if forced to remain in the MPP.   As \n9  a result, they will continue to suffer mental trauma and will be unable to meaningfully \n10  participate in Section 240 proceedings. \n11  266.  In the absence of judicial relief, this injury to Family Member class \n12  members is ongoing and will continue. \n13  V.  APPLICATION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n14 \n15  267.  Plaintiffs intend to file an Application for Temporary Restraining Order \n16  and Injunctive Relief and Brief in Support, requesting that the court provide relief \n17  consistent with the claims set forth above. \n18  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n19  Plaintiffs  respectfully  request  that  the  Court  enter  a  judgment  against \n20  Defendants and award the following relief:  \n21  1.  Issue a temporary restraining order, pending a hearing on the request for a \n22  preliminary injunction, that provides relief that will be identified in Plaintiffs’ \n23  briefing and will be consistent with the claims set forth above;  \n24  2.  Declare that the suit is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule \n25  of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2); \n26  3.  Adjudge  and  declare  that  the  acts,  omissions,  policies,  and  practices  of \n27  Defendants, and their agents, employees and officials, described herein, are in \n28  violation of the rights of Plaintiffs and the class members they seek to represent \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n54 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n1  under the Rehabilitation Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act/Accardi \n2  doctrine; \n3  4.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants, their agents, employees, \n4  and officials from subjecting Plaintiffs and the class members they seek to \n5  represent  to  the  illegal  and  unconstitutional  conditions,  acts,  omissions, \n6  policies, and practices set forth above; \n7  5.  Issue  an  injunction  requiring  Defendants,  without  limitation,  to:  stop \n8  subjecting members of the Accardi class to the MPP, and to put in place \n9  mechanisms to ensure that their Physical/Mental Health Exclusion policy is \n10  carried out on the ground; to admit family members of Accardi  class members \n11  pursuant to the Family Unit Policy; put in place practices and policies to \n12  identify  immigrants  with  disabilities,  and  to  assess  those  immigrants  for \n13  accommodations necessary to meaningfully prepare for and participate in \n14  Section  240  proceedings  from  the  United  States;  as  part  of  this \n15  accommodations assessment process, determine whether the immigrant with a \n16  disability and their families should be admitted into the United States to pursue \n17  their Section 240 proceedings, either as an accommodation or in compliance \n18  with Defendants’ Physical/Mental Health Exclusion policy; \n19  6.  Require Defendants to pay Plaintiff’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, \n20  pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 794(a)(b) and 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d); and \n21  7.  Grant all other relief that is just and proper. \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n    \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR \n55 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  \n\n \n \n1  Date:  November 2, 2020  Respectfully Submitted, \n \n2   \n/s/ Robert S.
