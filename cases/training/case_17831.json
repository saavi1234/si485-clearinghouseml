    "summary": "<p>This case involved allegations that local, state, and federal law enforcement failed to accommodate people with disabilities during public assemblies and protests.</p>\r\n<p>On November 1, 2020, four Portland, Oregon residents with disabilities, along with Disability Rights Oregon, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon (Portland). Defendants included the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Director of the U.S. Marshals, the Superintendent of the Oregon State Police, the City of Portland, the Mayor of Portland, Portland&rsquo;s Chief of Police, Multnomah County, and the Multnomah County Sheriff. The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel, the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center, and the Disability Rights Legal Center. The plaintiffs brought their claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 12101; the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &sect; 701; and 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. The plaintiffs also cited Bivens, which allows a lawsuit for damages when a federal officer violates the U.S. Constitution within their official capacity. The case was initially assigned to Judge Anna Brown but was reassigned to Judge Michael Simon the following day on November 3, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs had participated in or been present for racial justice protests that took place in Portland as part of the nationwide racial justice movement following the murder of George Floyd. They presented four central allegations. First, law enforcement harassed and retaliated against people with disabilities for exercising their constitutional rights. Second, law enforcement failed to make reasonable accommodations for those with sight, hearing, mobility, or other disabilities when dispersing a crowd. Third, people with disabilities were not given the opportunity to comply with law enforcement orders before being subject to force. Fourth, law enforcement discriminated against gender-nonconforming protestors, by both misgendering individuals and refusing to house protesters in law enforcement custody according to their gender identity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants&rsquo; actions (1) chilled the exercise of their First Amendment rights to assembly and protest, (2) violated Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and (3) violated their rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution by subjecting them to unnecessary harm and discrimination, abridging their freedom of speech, subjecting them to excessive force, and denying them due process and equal protection of the law. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and injunctive relief to modify police practices to address the needs of people with disabilities. The plaintiffs also sought compensatory and punitive damages for physical and mental injuries sustained while at protests dispersed by police.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on February 8, 2021, claiming those with disabilities needed both immediate protection against excessive force and modifications to police policies to protect people with disabilities at protests. They sought to have police provide American Sign Language interpreters and visual messaging systems; cease aggressive tactics like &ldquo;bull rushes&rdquo; against protestors; cease using chemical munitions; cease using strobe lights; cease separating people with disabilities from their assistants or service animals; and provide and inform protesters of alternative paths of escape before dispersing crowds.</p>\r\n<p>On March 15, 2021, the defendants filed multiple motions to dismiss. Two motions were filed by the U.S. Marshals and DHS. The first motion was for failure to state a claim, with the defendants arguing that they were entitled to qualified immunity and that the plaintiffs had alternative remedies that precluded Bivens remedies. The second motion was for a lack of jurisdiction, arguing that the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were moot as the U.S. Marshals and DHS were not involved in the Portland protests. The next three motions to dismiss were filed by the Oregon State Police, Multnomah County, and the City of Portland. They all presented similar arguments, namely that the plaintiffs failed to plead specific enough facts to allege systemic or specific instances of discrimination against the disabled.</p>\r\n<p>A hearing on the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a preliminary injunction was held on July 13, 2021.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 8, 2021, Judge Simon granted the defendants' motions to dismiss and denied the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. In granting the motions to dismiss, Judge Simon found that the plaintiffs did not have standing for two key reasons. First, the nightly protests in Portland that gave rise to the case were no longer ongoing. As a result, any alleged &ldquo;chilling effect&rdquo; on the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights would be based on a fear of future harm that was too speculative. Second, a recent change in Oregon law required police to take reasonable actions to accommodate disabilities when issuing or enforcing dispersal orders. Much of the relief sought by the plaintiffs had therefore already been enacted into law in Oregon. The court also found that, with respect to their ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, the plaintiffs had not alleged that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference. Additionally, the mayor and chief of police could not be held liable in their official capacities under &sect; 1983, and the plaintiffs failed to state a claim for municipal liability or against the county and county sheriff under &sect; 1983. Because the court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss, the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction was denied as moot. 566 F.Supp.3d 1069.</p>\r\n<p>Two of the original named plaintiffs, joined by a third individual who acted as a guide for one of the plaintiffs, filed an amended complaint on December 10, 2021 against only the City of Portland and Multnomah County and reasserted their Title II and Section 504 claims.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 10, 2022, both defendants moved separately to dismiss the complaint. The City moved to dismiss the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims for injunctive relief for lack of standing, while the County moved to dismiss them for lack of standing or mootness. Both defendants moved to dismiss the claims for compensatory damages on the ground that the plaintiffs failed to sufficiently allege deliberate indifference. Both defendants also argued that the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim. The plaintiffs, for their part, argued that they had sufficiently alleged injury under the &ldquo;deterrent effect doctrine,&rdquo; under which injury in fact can be satisfied in ADA cases by showing that the plaintiff was deterred from attempting to visit a location or use a service because of alleged ADA noncompliance.</p>\r\n<p>On June 10, 2022, the court granted the motions to dismiss and dismissed the case with prejudice. In granting the motions, the court disagreed with the plaintiffs that the deterrent effect doctrine was applicable in this case. The court found that the plaintiffs had failed to allege the existence of any barrier that would likely cause the plaintiffs injury upon their return to the facility or reasonably deter them from returning. The court dismissed the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims for compensatory and punitive damages because they failed to allege deliberate indifference, the Ninth Circuit standard for proving the requisite intentional discrimination to recover monetary damages under the ADA. 2022 WL 2105979.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs appealed the district court&rsquo;s order granting the defendants&rsquo; motions to dismiss to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on July 5, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>On August 30, 2023, a Ninth Circuit panel, consisting of Circuit Judge Mark J. Bennett, Circuit Judge Lawrence VanDyke, and Circuit Judge Holly A. Thomas, found that District Court correctly concluded that the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims for declaratory and injunctive relief were mooted by intervening events and that their claims for Rehabilitation Act and ADA compensatory damages insufficiently pleaded deliberate indifference. 2023 WL 5608993 (2023).</p>\r\n<p>This case is closed.</p>",

The plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on February 8, 2021, ordering the defendants to modify their practices. On October 8, 2021, the court denied their motion for a preliminary injunction and granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss, citing the lack of ongoing protests in Portland and recent changes to Oregon law that require police to accommodate disabilities when handling protests. In December 2021, three plaintiffs filed an amended complaint against the the City of Portland and Multnomah County. On June 10, 2022, the court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss and dismisssed the case with prejudice, holding that the defendants failed to state a claim and that their claims for injunctive relief were moot.

No. 3:20-cv-01882-SI  \n          Plaintiffs-Appellants,     \n     \n   v.   MEMORANDUM*  \n  \nCITY OF PORTLAND, an Oregon \nmunicipal corporation; and COUNTY OF \nMULTNOMAH, a political subdivision of \nthe State of Oregon, et al.,  \n  \n          Defendants-Appellees. \n \nAppeal from the United States District Court \nfor the District of Oregon \nMichael H. Simon, District Judge, Presiding \n \nArgued and Submitted August 23, 2023  \nPortland, Oregon \n \nBefore:  BENNETT, VANDYKE, and H.A. THOMAS, Circuit Judges. \n \n  Appellants are individuals with disabilities and an associate: Philip Wolfe is \ndeaf, Katalina Durden is blind, and Jackson Tudela is Durden’s sighted guide.  They \nallege they were injured when police broke up unlawful assemblies or riots in \n \n*  This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as \nprovided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3. \n        \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 163    Filed 08/30/23    Page 2 of 4\n \nPortland in 2020 by deploying crowd-control measures before Appellants could \nleave the vicinity.  Appellants filed suit against the City of Portland and the County \nof Multnomah, asking the district court (1) to declare that Portland’s crowd-control \npolicies violate Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (ADA); (2) to issue preliminary and permanent injunctions \nmandating modifications to those policies; and (3) to award them compensatory \ndamages.  \nThe district court dismissed their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief \nas moot, dismissed their claims for damages as insufficiently alleged under Rule \n12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and dismissed their suit with \nprejudice.  Appellants appeal dismissal.  We review both dismissals for mootness \nand  dismissals  under  Rule  12(b)(6)  de  novo.    Dep’t  of  Fish  &  Game  v.  Fed. \nSubsistence Bd., 62 F.4th 1177, 1179 (9th Cir. 2023); Disability Rts. Mont., Inc. v. \nBatista, 930 F.3d 1090, 1096 (9th Cir. 2019). \n“Dismissal on mootness grounds is ‘justified only if it [is] absolutely clear \nthat the litigant no longer ha[s] any need of the judicial protection that it sought.’”  \nPizzuto v. Tewalt, 997 F.3d 893, 903 (9th Cir. 2021) (alterations in original) (quoting \nCouncil of Ins. Agents & Brokers v. Molasky-Arman, 522 F.3d 925, 933 (9th Cir. \n2008)).  Appellees have identified significant intervening changes in state law and \nPortland police crowd-control procedures that collectively provide accommodations \n2 \n      \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 163    Filed 08/30/23    Page 3 of 4\n \nthat match and exceed the ones Appellants sought with respect to communication of \norders to disperse and allowance of enough time for disabled protesters to evacuate \nthe vicinity of the riots or unlawful assemblies.  See Or. Rev. Stat. §§ 131.675, \n162.247(3), 181A.708; Portland Police Bureau Internal Directive 635.10 §§ 5.7–.8, \n8.4.2.2.  And they chronicled the precipitous decrease in violent protests in Portland, \nas well as the cessation of police interventions akin to those alleged in Appellants’ \ncomplaint in any protest, since Appellants filed their complaint.  Appellants no \nlonger have any need of judicial protection, as they already have obtained the relief \nthey sought. \nTo defeat Appellees’ motions to dismiss their damages claims, Appellants \nneeded to plead facts that would allow a court to reasonably infer that each Appellee \nengaged in the injurious conduct they challenge.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n678 (2009); accord Weston Fam. P’ship LLLP v. Twitter, Inc., 29 F.4th 611, 617 \n(9th Cir. 2022).  For damages under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act or Title II \nof the ADA, Appellants had to allege nonspeculative facts that each Appellee was \non notice of Appellants’ need for reasonable accommodations to equally participate \nin protests, but was deliberately indifferent to that need.  Bax v. Drs. Med. Ctr. of \nModesto, Inc., 52 F.4th 858, 865–68 (9th Cir. 2022) (Section 504); Csutoras v. \nParadise High Sch., 12 F.4th 960, 969 (9th Cir. 2021) (Title II). \n3 \n      \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 163    Filed 08/30/23    Page 4 of 4\n \nAppellants reference pages in their complaint where they claim they did so \nwith respect to each Appellee.  But those pages do not plead any facts specific to the \ncounty: they merely make undifferentiated allegations that lump together the city \nand county Appellees, which does not satisfy the requirement that a complaint \ncontain “clear and concise averments stating which defendants are liable to plaintiffs \nfor which wrongs.”  McHenry v. Renne, 84 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir. 1996).  Nor \ndid Appellants offer sufficient facts with respect to the City of Portland.  The pages \nof their complaint that they purport contain specific and detailed allegations that the \ncity should have known that its crowd-control policies and procedures were not \neffective at communicating with Appellants, contain only generic allegations and \nbald legal conclusions.  And the pages Appellants point to as evidence that they \nmade specific and detailed factual allegations about their unsuccessful attempts to \nobtain specific types of relief from the city do not mention making such attempts.   \n  Accordingly, the district court correctly concluded that Appellants’ claims for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief were mooted by intervening events and that their \nclaims  for  Rehabilitation  Act  and  ADA  compensatory  damages  insufficiently \npleaded deliberate indifference.  The district court properly granted Appellees’ \nmotions to dismiss.   \n  AFFIRMED. \n4 \n      ",

Simon, District Judge. \n \nPlaintiffs Philip Wolfe and Katalina (Katie) Durden are individuals with disabilities, and \nPlaintiff Jackson (Jack) Tudela is an individual associated with Plaintiff Durden, their sighted \nPAGE 1 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 159    Filed 06/10/22    Page 2 of 13\n \nguide. Plaintiffs filed the First Amended Complaint (FAC), after the Court granted motions to \ndismiss filed by the state and federal defendants challenging the original complaint. The FAC \nbrings claims only against the City of Portland (City) and Multnomah County (County). \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants violated Plaintiffs’ rights as persons with disabilities or \nassociated with persons with disabilities in Defendants’ responses to social justice protests in \nPortland. Plaintiffs allege that the City and County violated Title II (Section 202) of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \n(Rehabilitation Act) in responding to protests and dispersing crowds. Plaintiffs request injunctive \nand declaratory relief and money damages. \nIn resolving the first motions to dismiss, the Court assumed that Plaintiffs had standing as \nof the commencement of this litigation on November 1, 2020. The Court found, however, that \nPlaintiffs’ claims for injunctive and declaratory relief were moot because Plaintiffs no longer \ncould show the requisite legally cognizable interest—certainly impending injury—to support \nequitable relief. See Wolfe v. City of Portland, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2021 WL 4713237, at *6-11 \n(D. Or. Oct. 8, 2021). The Court focused on the changed circumstances with the protests in \nPortland, particularly in the months of May, June, July, and August, 2021. Id. at *9-11. The \nCourt also found that with respect to Plaintiffs’ claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct, Plaintiffs did not allege deliberate indifference. Id. at *15, 17. \nIn the pending motions to dismiss, the City and County each argue that Plaintiffs fail to \ncure the deficiencies the Court identified in dismissing the original complaint. Defendants argue \nthat Plaintiffs’ lack standing or the case is moot because Plaintiffs fail sufficiently to allege the \nrequired injury for future injunctive relief. Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs fail sufficiently \nto allege deliberate indifference to recover monetary relief and, alternatively, fail to allege facts \nPAGE 2 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 159    Filed 06/10/22    Page 3 of 13\n \nsufficient to support a claim for relief on the merits. For the reasons discussed below, the Court \ngrants Defendants’ motions and dismisses this case with prejudice. \nSTANDARDS \nA.  Rule 12(b)(6)  \nA motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim may be granted only when there is no \ncognizable legal theory to support the claim or when the complaint lacks sufficient factual \nallegations to state a facially plausible claim for relief. Shroyer v. New Cingular Wireless Servs., \nInc., 622 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir. 2010). In evaluating the sufficiency of a complaint’s factual \nallegations, the court must accept as true all well-pleaded material facts alleged in the complaint \nand construe them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Wilson v. Hewlett-\nPackard Co., 668 F.3d 1136, 1140 (9th Cir. 2012); Daniels-Hall v. Nat’l Educ. Ass’n, 629 \nF.3d 992, 998 (9th Cir. 2010). To be entitled to a presumption of truth, allegations in a complaint \n“may not simply recite the elements of a cause of action, but must contain sufficient allegations \nof underlying facts to give fair notice and to enable the opposing party to defend itself \neffectively.” Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011). The court must draw all \nreasonable inferences from the factual allegations in favor of the plaintiff. Newcal Indus. v. Ikon \nOffice Sol., 513 F.3d 1038, 1043 n.2 (9th Cir. 2008). The court need not, however, credit a \nplaintiff’s legal conclusions that are couched as factual allegations. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. 662, 678-79 (2009). \nA complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations to “plausibly suggest an \nentitlement to relief, such that it is not unfair to require the opposing party to be subjected to the \nexpense of discovery and continued litigation.” Starr, 652 F.3d at 1216. “A claim has facial \nplausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citing \nPAGE 3 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 159    Filed 06/10/22    Page 4 of 13\n \nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556 (2007)). “The plausibility standard is not akin to a \nprobability requirement, but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted \nunlawfully.” Mashiri v. Epstein Grinnell & Howell, 845 F.3d 984, 988 (9th Cir. 2017) (quotation \nmarks omitted). \nB.  Rule 12(b)(1)  \nThe U.S. Constitution confers limited authority on the federal courts to hear only active \ncases or controversies brought by persons who show standing. See Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. \nCt. 1540, 1546-47 (2016); Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 89-90 (2013). Standing \n“limits the category of litigants empowered to maintain a lawsuit in federal court to seek redress \nfor a legal wrong.” Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1547. A plaintiff’s standing under Article III of the \nUnited States Constitution is a component of subject matter jurisdiction properly challenged \nunder Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Chandler v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \nIns. Co., 598 F.3d 1115, 1121 (9th Cir. 2010); see also White v. Lee, 227 F.3d 1214, 1242 (9th \nCir. 2000) (“Because standing and mootness both pertain to a federal court’s subject-matter \njurisdiction under Article III, they are properly raised in a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), not Rule 12(b)(6).”). On a motion to dismiss for lack of subject \nmatter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1), it is the plaintiff’s burden to establish the existence of \nsubject matter jurisdiction. Chandler, 598 F.3d at 1122; see also Kingman Reef Atoll Invs., LLC \nv. United States, 541 F.3d 1189, 1197 (9th Cir. 2008). \nA motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be \neither “facial” or “factual.” See Safe Air for Everyone v. Meyer, 373 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir. \n2004). A facial attack on subject matter jurisdiction is based on the assertion that the allegations \nin the complaint are insufficient to invoke federal jurisdiction. Id. “A jurisdictional challenge is \nfactual where ‘the challenger disputes the truth of the allegations that, by themselves, would \nPAGE 4 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 159    Filed 06/10/22    Page 5 of 13\n \notherwise invoke federal jurisdiction.’” Pride v. Correa, 719 F.3d 1130, 1133 n.6 (9th Cir. 2013) \n(quoting Safe Air for Everyone, 373 F.3d at 1039). When a defendant factually challenges the \nplaintiff’s assertion of jurisdiction, a court does not presume the truthfulness of the plaintiff’s \nallegations and may consider evidence extrinsic to the complaint. See Terenkian v. Republic of \nIraq, 694 F.3d 1122, 1131 (9th Cir. 2012); Safe Air for Everyone, 373 F.3d at 1039. A factual \nchallenge “can attack the substance of a complaint’s jurisdictional allegations despite their \nformal sufficiency.” Dreier v. United States, 106 F.3d 844, 847 (9th Cir. 1996) (citation and \nquotation marks omitted). \nC.  Standing  \nTo have standing, a plaintiff must have a “personal interest . . . at the commencement of \nthe litigation.” Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 \n(2000). The required personal interest must satisfy three elements throughout the litigation: \n(1) an injury in fact, i.e., an invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and \nparticularized, as well as actual or imminent; (2) a causal connection between the injury-in-fact \nand the defendant’s challenged behavior; and (3) likelihood that the injury-in-fact will be \nredressed by a favorable ruling. Id. at 180-81, 189; see also Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1547 \n(reiterating that the “irreducible constitutional minimum” of standing consists of “an injury in \nfact . . . fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and . . . likely to be redressed \nby a favorable judicial decision”). \nAn injury is “particularized” if it “affect[s] the plaintiff in a personal and individual \nway.” Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1548 (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 n.1 \n(1992)). An injury is “concrete” if it is “‘de facto’; that is it must actually exist,” meaning that it \nis “‘real’ and not ‘abstract.’” Id. “‘Concrete’ is not, however, necessarily synonymous with \n‘tangible.’ Although tangible injuries are perhaps easier to recognize, [the Supreme Court has] \nPAGE 5 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 159    Filed 06/10/22    Page 6 of 13\n \nconfirmed in many . . . previous cases that intangible injuries can nevertheless be concrete.” Id. \nat 1549. \nA plaintiff “must show standing with respect to each form of relief sought.” Ellis v. \nCostco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 978 (9th Cir. 2011). To establish Article III standing to \nseek injunctive relief, a plaintiff must “allege either ‘continuing, present adverse effects’” of a \ndefendant’s past illegal conduct, “or ‘a sufficient likelihood that [he] will again be wronged in a \nsimilar way.’” Villa v. Maricopa Cnty., 865 F.3d 1224, 1229 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting O’Shea v. \nLittleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495-96 (1974), and City of L.A. v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111 (1983)). \nAdditionally, standing to seek equitable relief requires “a showing of an inadequate remedy at \nlaw and . . . a serious risk of irreparable harm.” Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U.S. 522, 537 (1984); see \nalso O’Shea, 414 U.S. at 499. \nWhen a plaintiff seeks prospective injunctive relief, threat of repeated future injury may \nsuffice to provide standing. See Nordstrom v. Ryan, 762 F.3d 903, 911 (9th Cir. 2014). As \nexplained by the Ninth Circuit: \nA plaintiff seeking prospective injunctive relief “must demonstrate \n‘that he is realistically threatened by a repetition of [the \nviolation].’” Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 860-61 (9th \nCir. 2001) (alteration in original) (quoting City of L.A. v. Lyons, \n461 U.S. 95, 109 (1983)), abrogated on other grounds by Johnson \nv. California, 543 U.S. 499, 504-05 (2005). A threat of repetition \ncan be shown “at least two ways.” Id. at 861. “First, a plaintiff may \nshow that the defendant had, at the time of the injury, a written \npolicy, and that the injury ‘stems from’ that policy.” Id. “Second, \nthe plaintiff may demonstrate that the harm is part of a ‘pattern of \nofficially sanctioned . . . behavior, violative of the plaintiffs’ \n[federal] rights.’” Id. (alterations in original) (quoting LaDuke v. \nNelson, 762 F.2d 1318, 1324 (9th Cir. 1985)). \nId. (emphasis and alterations in original). The threat of repeated future injury, however, may not \nbe “conjectural or hypothetical.” O’Shea, 414 U.S. at 494 (quotation marks omitted). \nPAGE 6 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 159    Filed 06/10/22    Page 7 of 13\n \nFurther, concerns about separation of powers counsel careful scrutiny of a plaintiff’s \nstanding to seek injunctive relief against government officials. As the Supreme Court cautioned:  \nWhen transported into the Art. III context, [the principle that the \nGovernment has traditionally been granted the widest latitude in \nconducting its own internal affairs], grounded as it is in the idea of \nseparation of powers, counsels against recognizing standing in a \ncase brought, not to enforce specific legal obligations whose \nviolation works a direct harm, but to seek a restructuring of the \napparatus established by the Executive Branch to fulfill its legal \nduties. The Constitution, after all, assigns to the Executive Branch, \nand not to the Judicial Branch, the duty to “take Care that the Laws \nbe faithfully executed.” \nAllen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 761 (1984), abrogated on other grounds by Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. \nStatic Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118 (2014); see also Lyons, 461 U.S. at 112 (“We \ndecline the invitation to slight the preconditions for equitable relief [irreparable injury]; for as we \nhave held, recognition of the need for a proper balance between state and federal authority \ncounsels restraint in the issuance of injunctions against state officers engaged in the \nadministration of the states’ criminal laws in the absence of irreparable injury which is both great \nand immediate.”). \nDISCUSSION \nThe City moves to dismiss Plaintiffs’ equitable claims for lack of standing. The County \nmoves to dismiss for lack of standing or mootness. Both Defendants move to dismiss the claims \nfor compensatory damages because Plaintiffs fail sufficiently to allege deliberate indifference. \nBoth Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim on the merits for several reasons. \nBecause the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ claims for equitable relief are moot and their claims for \nmoney damages fail because Plaintiffs do not sufficiently allege deliberate indifference, the \nCourt declines to reach Defendants’ remaining arguments. \nPAGE 7 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 159    Filed 06/10/22    Page 8 of 13\n \nA.  Standing and Mootness—Claims for Equitable Relief \nDefendants raise factual challenges to the Court’s jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1). Thus, \nthe Court considers documents and evidence outside the pleadings. See Robinson v. United \nStates, 586 F.3d 683, 685 (9th Cir. 2009) (stating that in a 12(b)(1) motion “[a] district court may \nhear evidence regarding jurisdiction and resolve factual disputes where necessary” (simplified)); \nFarr v. United States, 990 F.2d 451, 454 (9th Cir. 1993) (stating that “it is proper for the district \ncourt to consider evidence outside of the pleadings for the purpose of deciding a jurisdictional \nissue (emphasis in original)); McCarthy v. United States, 850 F.2d 558, 560 (9th Cir. 1988) \n(“[W]hen considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) the district court is not \nrestricted to the face of the pleadings, but may review any evidence, such as affidavits and \ntestimony, to resolve factual disputes concerning the existence of jurisdiction.”).  \n1.  Standing \nDefendants and Plaintiffs focus on standing, apparently considering standing as of the \ndate the FAC was filed. Standing, however, is considered as of the date the case was commenced \n(November 1, 2020), and not the date the FAC was filed (December 10, 2021). See, e.g., Focus \non the Family v. Pinellas Suncoast Transit Auth., 344 F.3d 1263, 1275 (11th Cir. 2003) \n(“Importantly, in reaching this [standing] determination, we note that Article III standing must be \ndetermined as of the time at which the plaintiff’s complaint is filed.”); Cleveland Branch, \nNAACP v. City of Parma, 263 F.3d 513, 524 (6th Cir. 2001) (“[S]tanding does not have to be \nmaintained throughout all stages of litigation. Instead it is to be determined as of the time the \ncomplaint is filed.”); White v. Lee, 227 F.3d 1214, 1243 (9th Cir. 2000) (“Standing is examined \nat ‘the commencement of the litigation.’”); McFalls v. Purdue, 2018 WL 785866, at *8 (D. Or. \nFeb. 8, 2018) (rejecting the argument that standing is considered at the time of the filing of the \nsecond amended complaint, considering standing as of the commencement of the litigation, and \nPAGE 8 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 159    Filed 06/10/22    Page 9 of 13\n \nevaluating the case for mootness); Nw. Envtl. Def. Ctr. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 2013 \nWL 1294647, at *7-8 (D. Or. Mar. 27, 2013) (rejecting the defendant’s arguments that standing \nshould be considered based on the facts at the time of the second amended complaint when the \ngovernment had voluntarily disbanded the challenged conduct and discussing the difference \nbetween standing and mootness). \nThe Court previously assumed without deciding that Plaintiffs had standing as of the \ncommencement of this litigation. See Wolfe, 2021 WL 471323, at *5. The Court does so again \nfor purposes of this motion, and evaluates whether the case is moot based on the record evidence \nand new allegations in the FAC. \n2.  Mootness \nAs the Court emphasized in resolving the first motions to dismiss, “[a] case is moot when \nthe issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the \noutcome.” Clark v. City of Lakewood, 259 F.3d 996, 1011 (9th Cir. 2001), as amended (Aug. 15, \n2001) (quotation marks omitted). “The phrase ‘legally cognizable interest’ is often used to \ndescribe Article III’s case or controversy requirements when mootness is at issue, while the \nphrase ‘injury in fact’ is often used to discuss these requirements when standing is at issue.” Id. \nat 1011 n.7. In considering the injury requirement and mootness when a plaintiff requests future \ninjunctive relief, courts must consider whether the plaintiff’s “future injuries are now too \nconjectural or hypothetical to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement allowing [the plaintiff] to \npursue injunctive relief.” Id. at 1012. “A plaintiff may not rely ‘on mere conjecture about \npossible governmental actions’ to demonstrate injury, and must instead present ‘concrete \nevidence to substantiate their fears.’” Index Newspapers LLC v. United States Marshals \nServ., 977 F.3d 817, 825 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, \n420 (2013).  \nPAGE 9 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 159    Filed 06/10/22    Page 10 of 13\n \nPlaintiffs’ allegations regarding the protests and law enforcement response by Defendants \nare not meaningfully different from the allegations and record facts the Court considered in \npreviously holding that the facts were insufficient to show impending injury sufficient to claim \nfuture injunctive relief. Plaintiffs now argue that they sufficiently allege injury under the \n“deterrent effect doctrine” to seek future injunctive relief under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. \nUnder this doctrine, “[t]he first element of the Article III standing analysis—injury in fact—can \nbe satisfied in ADA cases by showing that the plaintiff was deterred from attempting to visit a \nlocation or use a service because of alleged ADA noncompliance.” Namisnak v. Uber Techs., \nInc., 971 F.3d 1088, 1092 (9th Cir. 2020). The plaintiff must encounter a barrier that interferes \nwith the plaintiff’s full and equal enjoyment of the facility on account of the plaintiff’s disability. \nChapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.) Inc., 631 F.3d 939, 947 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc).  \nThe Ninth Circuit further explained that under this doctrine \na plaintiff can demonstrate sufficient injury to pursue injunctive \nrelief when discriminatory architectural barriers deter him from \nreturning to a noncompliant accommodation. Just as a disabled \nindividual who intends to return to a noncompliant facility suffers \nan imminent injury from the facility’s “existing or imminently \nthreatened noncompliance with the ADA,” a plaintiff who is \ndeterred from patronizing a store suffers the ongoing “actual \ninjury” of lack of access to the store. \nId. at 950; see also Doran v. 7–Eleven, Inc., 524 F.3d 1034, 1040-41 (9th Cir. 2008) (applying \nthe deterrent effect doctrine when the plaintiff had visited the 7-11 store, encountered its \naccessibility barriers, been deterred from visiting further because of the accessibility barriers \neven though the store was conveniently located and the plaintiff’s preferred store, and thus \nconcluding there was “an actual or imminent threat that, during his planned future visits to \nAnaheim, [he] will suffer harm as a result of the alleged barriers”). \nPAGE 10 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 159    Filed 06/10/22    Page 11 of 13\n \nAdditionally, “an ADA plaintiff demonstrates a sufficient likelihood of future harm to \nestablish standing to sue for an injunction when he intends to return to a noncompliant place of \npublic accommodation where he will likely suffer repeated injury.” Chapman, 631 F.3d at 948. \nThis is a second way in which an ADA plaintiff may show standing (or that a case is not moot), \nand Plaintiffs also argue that it applies. \nPlaintiffs’ arguments that these two methods of showing a live case or controversy apply \nhere are unavailing. Plaintiffs allege that they are deterred from attending protests and that they \nwould like to return to protesting but are concerned that they would suffer injury if they do. Such \nconclusory allegations of elements of a claim, however, are not accepted as true in considering a \nmotion to dismiss. This case is not like the cases applying the deterrent effect doctrine or injury \nfrom an intent to return to a place with barriers because Plaintiffs do not allege a permanent \narchitectural barrier or anything similar. Plaintiffs do not allege an existing or imminent barrier. \nThe “barrier” alleged by Plaintiffs only occurs if there is a protest that is declared an unlawful \nassembly, that unlawful assembly results in police action, that police action results in excessive \nforce, and that excessive force is directed at or near Plaintiffs. The string of events that must \noccur is too speculative at this point, when protests are sporadic, of those sporadic protests the \nones declared unlawful assemblies are minimal, and of those few declared unlawful assemblies \nthere are no allegations that any in the last several months involved excessive force. Thus, \nPlaintiffs fail to allege a barrier that will “likely” cause Plaintiffs to suffer injury upon their \nreturn, see Chapman, 631 F.3d at 948, or facts that show reasonable deterrence because Plaintiffs \nface “an actual or imminent threat” that during a future protest Plaintiffs “will suffer harm as a \nresult of the alleged barriers.” Doran, 524 F.3d at 1041; see also Chapman, 631 F.3d at 950. \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs’ claims for equitable relief are dismissed. \nPAGE 11 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 159    Filed 06/10/22    Page 12 of 13\n \nB.  Claims for Monetary Damages \n1.  Legal Standards for a Damages Claim by a Private Plaintiff \nThe Ninth Circuit held in Ferguson v. City of Phoenix, that “compensatory damages are \nnot available under Title II . . . absent a showing of discriminatory intent.” 157 F.3d 668, 674 \n(9th Cir. 1998). The panel declined to establish a standard for showing discriminatory intent, \nleaving open whether “deliberate indifference” or “discriminatory animus” could make the \nrequisite showing. Id. at 675.  \nIn Duvall v. County of Kitsap, the Ninth Circuit resolved that open issue and held that the \n“deliberate indifference” standard applies to prove the requisite intentional discrimination to \n“recover monetary damages under Title II of the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.” 260 F.3d 1124, \n1138-39 (9th Cir. 2001). “Deliberate indifference requires both knowledge that a harm to a \nfederally protected right is substantially likely, and a failure to act upon that the likelihood.” Id. \nat 1139. The plaintiff must also “identify ‘specific reasonable’ and ‘necessary’ accommodations \nthat the defendant failed to provide.” Id. \nA recent decision by the Supreme Court forecloses emotional distress damages under the \nRehabilitation Act and thus likely also under the ADA, for which remedies are construed \ncoextensively with the Rehabilitation Act. See Cummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 142 \nS. Ct. 1562 (2022). This decision reiterated that other compensatory damages and injunctive \nrelief are available and that punitive damages are unavailable. See id. at 1571. \n2.  Whether Plaintiffs Allege Such a Claim \nNo Plaintiff sufficiently alleges deliberate indifference. Plaintiffs’ allegations do not \nshow that the City or County knew that their law enforcement policies and procedures with \nrespect to protests were substantially likely to harm a federally protected right. Regarding \nPlaintiff Durden, who is blind, and their sighted guide Plaintiff Tudela, Defendants’ procedures \nPAGE 12 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 159    Filed 06/10/22    Page 13 of 13\n \ninvolve making many audio announcements (sometimes for hours) before any further action is \ntaken. Plaintiffs do not explain how the many audio announcements are not sufficient for \nPlaintiffs Durden and Tudela to reach safety before further police action. \nAs for Plaintiff Wolfe, who is deaf, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants could implement \naccommodations such as a live ASL interpreter or mobile video boards. Plaintiffs allege that \nDefendants have done nothing other than implement a Twitter account that posts notifications. \nThe Twitter account, however, is a visual medium that is accessible to deaf persons. Plaintiffs \nalso fail to allege that their proposed accommodations are reasonable and necessary. See \nDuvall, 260 F.3d at 1139. As Defendants have explained, given the volatile and sometimes \ndangerous nature of protests, adding a live ASL translator is not safe and given the attacks on \npolice vehicles and other property, having a mobile video screen was also considered and \nrejected. Because Plaintiffs fail to allege deliberate indifference, their claims for money damages \nare dismissed. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court GRANTS the motions to dismiss filed by Defendants Multnomah County \n(ECF 152) and the City of Portland (ECF 153). Because Plaintiffs previously had a chance to \namend and could not state a claim, this case is dismissed with prejudice.   \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \nDATED this 10th day of June, 2022. \n   \n              /s/ Michael H.

This lawsuit seeks preliminary and permanent relief to stop local, state, and \nfederal law enforcement from assaulting, brutalizing, and failing to reasonably accommodate \npeople with disabilities during assemblies and protests.  \n2.  In the wake of the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and many \nother Black, Indigenous, or people of color by law enforcement, protesters have assembled in \nPortland, Oregon nearly every day for several months to demand police accountability and an \nend to systemic racism and other forms of oppression that Black, Indigenous, and people of color \nface in our country.  Law enforcement has reacted to these protests with repeated and \ndisproportionate displays of brute force, including disregarding the rights of people with \ndisabilities.   \n3.  In their attempts to disperse protests, law enforcement has deployed \nindiscriminate crowd control mechanisms, blanketing Portland’s parks and streets with tear gas \nwhile discharging thousands of flashbang grenades, pepper balls, and rubber bullets, as well as \nusing their batons and fists to beat protesters and throw them to the ground.  The burden of these \ntactics has fallen disproportionately on protesters and others with disabilities, who receive little \nor no notice or opportunity to comply before law enforcement uses overwhelming force.  In fact, \nprotesters are often brutalized even as they attempt to comply with police instructions while \ninforming officers of their disabilities.   \n4.  Defendants have often targeted people with disabilities for harassment and \nviolence in retaliation for exercising their constitutional rights. They have told people with \ndisabilities that they should not attend protests at all.   \n5.  Local, state, and federal law enforcement have failed to establish policies \ndesigned to afford people with disabilities the same opportunity to avoid law enforcement harm \nas those without disabilities, including, for example adequately warning protesters before \nattempting to take actions to disperse a crowd, making sure that there are clear routes of escape \nPage 3 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

The Portland Police Bureau, Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office, Oregon \nState Police, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Marshals Service, and the individual \ndefendants (collectively, “Defendants”) have violated the rights of people with disabilities in \ntheir responses to protests against police brutality, chilling the exercise of their constitutional \nright to assemble and protest.  Defendants’ actions violate the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(“ADA”), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution, subjecting them to unnecessary harm and discrimination, \nabridging their freedom of speech, subjecting them to excessive force, and denying them due \nprocess and equal protection of the law.  \n7.  Plaintiffs bring this action to vindicate the fundamental rights of people \nwith disabilities. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331(a) and 1343 because Plaintiffs allege violation of rights guaranteed by the \nU.S. Constitution, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADA.  This Court has \njurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n2201 and 2202 and Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n9.

Plaintiff Philip Wolfe1 has been a resident of Portland, Oregon since 2010, \nincluding at all times relevant to this lawsuit.  Philip has been Deaf since birth and communicates \nthrough American Sign Language (ASL).  Philip is a qualified person with a disability within the \nmeaning of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  Philip has a lengthy history of activism, \nincluding participation in demonstrations for the Me Too movement, the March for Our Lives, \nactions for climate change, and opposing war, chairing Portland’s Community Oversight \nAdvisory Board (COAB), and running for Portland City Council to represent the needs of the \nentire community, including people who are Deaf or hard of hearing.  Philip regularly attends the \nprotests against police brutality and continues to be subject to discrimination and harm by \nDefendants.   \n11.  Plaintiff Katalina (“Katie”) Durden has been a resident of Portland, \nOregon, since 2008, including at all times relevant to this lawsuit.  Katie lost her vision when she \nwas four years old from optic nerve damage and is legally blind.  She is a qualified person with a \ndisability within the meaning of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  She initially monitored the \nprotests online out of fear of harm stemming from Defendants’ treatment of people with \ndisabilities, particularly their use of excessive force; however, she has attended protests regularly \nsince late July as an independent member of the press who records the protests in 360° sound for \npeople with low vision and others.  She typically uses a guide dog to navigate, but has instead \nused a reflective red and white cane at protests for fear of harm to her service dog.  She continues \nto be subject to discrimination and harm by Defendants. \n12.  Plaintiff Melissa Lewis has been a resident of Portland, Oregon, nearly her \nentire life, including at all times relevant to this lawsuit.  She is a person with both photosensitive \n                                                 \n1 Philip Wolfe’s gender identity is non-binary and Philip does not use pronouns.

The Murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Countless Others Led \nto Protests Against Racism and Police Brutality. \n26.  On March 13, 2020, Louisville police officers Jonathan Mattingly, Brett \nHankison and Myles Cosgrove killed Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, after \nmistakenly raiding her apartment.  Only one officer, Brett Hankison, was fired as a result of the \nincident.  Ms. Taylor’s death led to large-scale demonstrations in the spring and summer of 2020 \nas the case drew more attention. \n27.  On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a white police officer with the \nMinneapolis Police Department, killed George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, after responding \nto a report that Mr. Floyd bought cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill.  Officer Chauvin knelt on \nGeorge Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes; this brutal act was captured on video and widely \ndisseminated.  During those eight minutes, Mr. Floyd repeated what has become a shockingly \nfamiliar phrase uttered by far too many people of color, including Eric Garner, Javier Ambler, \nManuel Ellis, and Elijah McClain: “I can’t breathe.”  Officer Chauvin and his fellow officers \nignored his pleas.   \n28.  In response to the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd and the \nhistoric and continued police brutality and violence against Black people, Indigenous people, and \nother people of color, protests have erupted across the country demanding accountability and \neven a complete reimagining of the community approach to public safety.  These protests have \ntoo often been met with their own wave of brutality, including the use of tear gas, flashbang \ngrenades, pepper balls, and rubber bullets.   \n \n \nPage 9 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W. FIFTH AVENUE \nPORTLAND, OREGON  97204 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-BR    Document 1    Filed 11/01/20    Page 10 of 66\n   \n \nB.  Defendants Routinely Utilize Brutal Tactics Against Portland Protesters  \n29.  The use of these weapons and other brutal tactics have been on full display \nin Portland, Oregon, where Defendants have used them to disperse groups of largely peaceful \nprotesters, legal observers, and members of the press.  Defendants’ actions have already deprived \npeople of their rights, caused countless injuries, and sparked multiple state and federal lawsuits \nand court-ordered injunctions. \n30.  Protesters in Portland have assembled almost every day since May 29, \n2020 to protest the systemic use of violence against people of color, including at the hands of \nPPB and other law enforcement agencies in Oregon.  As a matter of public record, Portland \nPolice have killed, among others, Quanice Hayes, Terrell Johnson, Aaron Campbell, Patrick \nKimmons, Darris Johnson, Kendra James, and Koben Henriksen.  Mr. Henriksen was the fifth \nperson in a mental health crisis killed by officers of the PPB in 2019 alone. \n31.  During these protests, people with disabilities have been routinely \ndiscriminated against, targeted, brutalized with excessive force, and denied their freedom of \nspeech and right to due process and equal protection of the law. \nC.    Defendants Discriminate Against People Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing. \n32.  Defendants discriminate against people who are Deaf or hard of hearing at \nprotests, including by failing to provide effective communication to protesters and others.   \n33.  Defendants have failed to provide effective and accessible \ncommunications about law enforcement or other activities at protests.  Defendants have routinely \nfailed to communicate orders to disperse, including instructions for doing so, warnings about \nimminent use of force, and declarations of unlawful assemblies and riots.  When Defendants \nhave communicated orders, they have only done so orally.  As a result, people who are Deaf or \nhard of hearing have been subjected to egregious uses of force for failing to comply with orders \nand warnings they never received. \nPage 10 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W. FIFTH AVENUE \nPORTLAND, OREGON  97204 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-BR    Document 1    Filed 11/01/20    Page 11 of 66\n   \n \n34.  This is true for members of DRO and Philip.  Philip has been subjected to \nthis use of force on numerous occasions.  On May 31, 2020, at around 10:30 or 11:00 pm, PPB \nofficers fired flashbang grenades into a crowd of thousands of people without any warning \naccessible to people who are Deaf or hard of hearing.   \n35.  Flashbang grenades emit an extremely loud noise and bright lights aimed \nat disorienting people.  For people who are Deaf or hard of hearing, flashbang grenades are \nparticularly disorienting and can cause additional hearing damage.  Deaf and hard of hearing \npeople often rely heavily on their vision, along with residual hearing if applicable, to access and \nmove through the world around them.  Flashbang grenades can cause Deaf and hard of hearing \npeople to lose their residual hearing temporarily or permanently, and to experience a temporary \nbut devastating impact on their ability to see and maintain physical balance.  They may also \nexperience severe ringing in their ears.  The combination of these various factors leads to \nextreme disorientation and an unsafe situation for Deaf and hard of hearing people.  \n36.  The PPB’s use of flashbang grenades and other force that evening caused \na stampede in the crowd, putting Philip and others, including those with disabilities that impact \nmobility, at significant risk of injury.  Philip and Philip’s friends, who are also Deaf, desperately \ntried to hold hands and stay together amid the chaos.  PPB officers then fired tear gas into the \ncrowd, causing Philip and others to cough and Philip’s eyes to burn and water profusely.  As a \nresult, Philip was unable to see or hear what was happening in an already chaotic environment.  \nPhilip was fortunate to have escaped the crowd without significant physical injury, although \nPhilip was left dizzy, nauseous, lethargic, and dazed from the exposure to tear gas and overall \nexperience. \n37.  Philip was not so fortunate on other occasions.  On June 19, 2020, for \nexample, Philip, like many others, attended a protest at the Multnomah County, Oregon Justice \nPage 11 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W. FIFTH AVENUE \nPORTLAND, OREGON  97204 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-BR    Document 1    Filed 11/01/20    Page 12 of 66\n   \n \nCenter in downtown Portland.  That evening, as on other occasions, PPB officers shot tear gas \ncanisters and flashbang grenades indiscriminately into the crowd.   \n38.  No accessible warnings were ever given to persons with disabilities.  \nPhilip perceived that officers began to fire out of nowhere, and then Philip felt a sharp, searing \npain as a flashbang grenade hit Philip in the back.  Officers shouted at protesters as they \ncontinued to fire indiscriminately into the crowd and strike protesters with batons, even as the \ncrowd began to disperse.  Philip was unable to understand what the officers were saying.  It felt \nlike a war zone to Philip. \n39.  On July 22, 2020, after DHS agents established a presence in the City, \nPhilip attended a rally a few blocks away from the Justice Center and, later on, another event \nhappening on 4th Street.  Philip observed PPB officers and federal agents work in tandem to \ndisperse the large group with both agencies firing tear gas and flashbang grenades into the \ncrowd.   \n40.  Neither PPB nor DHS gave any accessible warning to Philip.  Philip \nbrought an interpreter that evening, who informed Philip that the authorities gave an oral \nwarning that the event was becoming unlawful.  However, PPB and DHS did not give Philip \nsufficient time to disperse before using force.  Philip could not avoid exposure to the tear gas, \ncoughed and became dizzy.  A friend who is Deaf/blind and who accompanied Philip that \nevening was terrified. \n41.  On other occasions, Philip was forced to leave protests far earlier than \nPhilip would have chosen because Defendants’ communication was inaccessible to Philip, \ncausing an unavoidable risk of violence and arrest by Defendants.   \n42.  When Philip articulated concerns about accessibility to PPB officers, the \nofficers told Philip not to attend protests because the inaccessibility made it unsafe.  As discussed \nPage 12 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W. FIFTH AVENUE \nPORTLAND, OREGON  97204 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-BR    Document 1    Filed 11/01/20    Page 13 of 66\n   \n \nbelow, Philip also brought those concerns directly to Mayor Wheeler, who also failed to make \nreasonable accommodations available.   \n43.  PPB’s use of teargas on Philip should have been avoided through effective \ncommunication.  Philip has had recurring headaches since mid-August because of the teargas.  \nPhilip’s existing PTSD has been exacerbated as a result of the war zone-like environment and \nhas experienced severe anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, hypervigilance, night terrors, and other \nsymptoms.  \n44.  Philip has attempted to meaningfully address PPB’s disability \ndiscrimination through the years.  In 2012, Philip filed a lawsuit challenging PPB’s failure to \nprovide accommodations to people who are Deaf or hard of hearing when responding to calls for \nservice.  When Philip reported a domestic violence situation and requested an interpreter, the \npolice responded without an interpreter, refused to get one, spoke only to Philip’s partner, and, as \na result, did nothing.  \n45.  After the lawsuit settled, Philip served as a role player for the Department \nof Public Safety Standards and Training, attempting to train PPB officers on how to effectively \nwork with and serve people who are Deaf or hard of hearing.  During the six months Philip \nworked in that capacity, Philip saw firsthand PPB’s resistance to change and to accommodating \npeople with disabilities—a resistance that continues to this day and makes this lawsuit necessary. \n46.  At no time did Philip observe any discussion of the need to provide \nAmerican Sign Language (“ASL”) interpreters, nor did Philip see any real efforts by PPB and the \nCity to otherwise implement the settlement.  In September 2020, City officials informed \nPlaintiffs’ counsel that a policy on effective communication has been in draft form for the last \ntwo years.   \n \n \n \nPage 13 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

Defendants Discriminate Against People Who Are Blind and Low Vision. \n47.  Defendants discriminate against people who are blind or low vision at \nprotests, including by subjecting them to excessive force and by failing to provide clear and \nconsistent directions, such as orders to disperse, and sufficient opportunity to comply.   \n48.  Plaintiff Durden primarily reads Braille and primarily uses a guide dog for \nmobility.  Katie has concerns about tear gas and other forms of indiscriminate violence by law \nenforcement, and she is concerned that her guide dog would be injured if she brought the dog to \na protest.  When she attends protests, Katie relies on her cane and a sighted guide, i.e., a sighted \nindividual who can safely lead her through crowds and over uneven ground. \n49.  Katie is an independent journalist and attends protests with sound \nrecording equipment to develop 360-degree audio recordings that she edits and publishes on \nSoundcloud.  When attending a protest as a member of the press, Katie wears a press badge and a \nhelmet with “PRESS” written on it. \n50.  On Friday, July 24, 2020, Katie attended a nighttime march with her \nfriend Jacob Hanning, another journalist who also served as her sighted guide for the evening.  \nKatie and Jacob both wore full-face gas masks and helmets.  Jacob’s helmet also had the word \n“PRESS” written on it in block letters. As an independent journalist, Jacob was live streaming \nthe events of the evening on Periscope. \n51.  During the course of the evening, Katie and Jacob were tear-gassed \nseveral times, but thanks to their gas masks, they suffered only minor irritation. \n52.  Katie and Jacob spent the majority of the evening near the fence \nsurrounding the Justice Center.  At no point were Katie and Jacob within fifteen feet of the fence.  \nLocal and federal agents were stationed on the other side of the fence firing tear gas and \nflashbangs into the crowd.  \nPage 14 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

At approximately 1:58 am, Katie and Jacob were standing approximately \nthirty feet from the fence while Jacob filmed the protesters standing between them and the fence.  \nThey were standing still, and Katie had her cane visible in front of her. \n54.  Katie and Jacob heard a series of loud pops and felt several objects hit \nthem hard in the side and legs.  Jacob led Katie away from the area as quickly as he could, and \nthey moved to the next street corner.  Once there, they examined their clothing and realized that \nlaw enforcement had shot them with “pepper balls” – paintball-sized pellets filled with oleoresin \ncapsicum (OC), the same substance as pepper spray.  The impacts were hard enough to leave a \nlarge welt just below Katie’s hip. \n55.  On August 6, 2020, Katie was attending another nighttime protest with her \ncane and sighted guides, this time in Southeast Portland.  PPB declared an unlawful assembly \nwithin fifteen minutes of Katie’s arrival and quickly declared the assembly a riot shortly \nthereafter. \n56.  PPB bull rushed the protesters, shoving them and hitting them with their \nbatons to drive them in a chosen direction while yelling at them to run. \n57.  Katie, led by her sighted guides, was moving as fast as she could, but she \nwas shoved in the back by the police, lost her balance, and skidded on her knees. \n58.  To get away from the crush of people, Katie’s guides led her up a flight of \nstairs.  It was narrow enough that they had to move single-file; without her guides to help her, \nKatie ran face-first into a metal pole. \n59.  Katie has suffered persistent knee pain since the incident on August 5, \n2020.  \n60.  On August 7, 2020, Katie attended a nighttime protest outside the Kelly \nBuilding in Southeast Portland, together with three sighted guides. \nPage 15 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W. FIFTH AVENUE \nPORTLAND, OREGON  97204 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-BR    Document 1    Filed 11/01/20    Page 16 of 66\n   \n \n61.  After approximately three hours, PPB declared an unlawful assembly. At \napproximately 12:30 a.m., the police bull rushed the protesters.  Police shoved Katie while \nyelling at her to move.  Only after she identified herself as a member of the press and informed \nthe police that they were being recorded did officers stop actively pushing her. \n62.  At the same time as the bull rush, officers using the Long-Range Acoustic \nDevice (“LRAD”) orally instructed protesters to disperse to the East.  Over the next twenty \nminutes, the LRAD instructions changed several times.  Protesters were instructed to disperse to \nthe East, then to the East or South, then solely to the South, and then finally to the West.  Even \nthe officers making the announcements seemed confused about the directions they were \nproviding. \n63.  On September 18, 2020, Katie attended a nighttime protest in downtown \nPortland with two sighted guides.  Between 200 and 300 protesters were gathered approximately \ntwo blocks from the ICE detention facility to protest the forced sterilization of women in ICE \ncustody. \n64.  Katie normally wears a full-face gas mask to protests.  On this particular \nnight, however, she had traded masks with a sighted guide whose goggles were broken.  Katie \nwas left with only a respirator and very little eye protection. Katie believed that because of the \nban on CS gas that Mayor Wheeler had issued on September 10, 2020, the chances of tear gas \nexposure were lower than they had been previously. \n65.  When Katie and her guides arrived at the protest, DHS agents were in a \nriot line in front of the protesters.  Federal agents attempted to push the crowd back several times \nwithout significant success. \n66.  While DHS agents formed a riot line to the South, PPB officers arrived, \ndeclared an unlawful assembly, and swept from the West to the North, blocking egress for \nprotesters in multiple directions.  \nPage 16 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

Mayor Wheeler’s ban on CS gas only applies to the PPB and not to federal \nagencies.  Thus, DHS agents were free to use tear gas to disperse the crowd, and they did so \nvigorously, firing numerous canisters of tear gas into the crowd along with hundreds of rounds of \npepper balls and other munitions. \n68.  Interspersed with the tear gas canisters were numerous flashbangs.  One of \nthese flashbangs went off so close to Katie that she saw the flash with her limited vision through \nclosed eyes and she felt acute pain and ringing in her ears. \n69.  As federal agents blocked her path from the South and PPB pushed in \nfrom the North and West, officers from different agencies ordered Katie to disperse in different \ndirections. \n70.  Katie’s air was saturated with tear gas and OC powder, and it was nearly \nimpossible to escape the protest area without being affected.  The tear gas and pepper spray \ncaused Katie significant discomfort and pain.  Katie had her eyes rinsed three times that night, \nonly to be re-affected by tear gas and OC powder each time. \n71.  Dispersal orders and excessive force are often disorienting for Katie, who \ncannot read street signs without assistance.  Katie, like many blind people, navigates primarily \nusing cardinal directions such as north, south, east, or west.  Cardinal directions, however, are \nnot useful to Katie after she becomes disoriented by law enforcement’s use of force.  \n72.  On Saturday, September 26, 2020, Katie attended a daytime “Proud Boys” \nrally to record speeches and a nighttime protest at the Justice Center.  At both events, Katie’s \ncompanion Jackson (“Jack”) Tudela was her primary sighted guide.  Their friend “Declan Hood” \nserved as an additional sighted guide at the nighttime protest.  Katie also had her cane with her. \n73.  Katie, Jack, and Declan Hood walked arm-in-arm through the nighttime \nprotest while Jack took video and Katie made audio recordings.  Jack was wearing a yellow \nhigh-visibility jacket, and Katie wore her bright blue helmet labeled “Press.” \nPage 17 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

Around midnight, PPB declared an unlawful assembly and rushed the \nprotesters.  As the crowd moved backwards with their hands up, police shoved people to the \nground and beat them with batons.  The retreat became a stampede as people tried to escape the \npolice. \n75.  Katie, Jack, and Declan Hood were caught in the crowd moving \nbackwards.  Katie and Jack repeatedly and loudly stated that Katie was blind and a member of \nthe press.  As Jack and Declan Hood turned around to help move Katie backwards, officers \nshoved them, knocking all three of them to the ground. \n76.  Officers surrounded and arrested Jack while others continued to strike \nKatie and Declan Hood with their batons.  Through the limited vision in her left eye, Katie saw \nthe batons, which hit her in the helmet, chest, and shoulders.  Declan Hood dragged Katie away \nto prevent her from being injured, and Katie heard Jack screaming her name.  Katie has relied on \nJack as her primary sighted guide at recent protests and the two have formed a close bond.  Thus, \nJack’s arrest was particularly traumatic for Katie. \n77.  Declan Hood and Katie escaped the stampede and were able to locate a \ngroup of their friends.  Katie and the group of friends waited for Jack to get released from \ncustody at 5:00 am.  When their personal effects were returned to Jack, everything, including all \nof their and Katie’s electronic equipment, had been doused in hand sanitizer. \n78.  Katie suffered numerous physical injuries from her experiences at the \nPortland protests, including heavy bruising and pain across her body.  \n79.  Repeated exposure to physical violence at the hands of state and federal \nlaw enforcement has taken a severe emotional toll on Katie.  Katie’s therapist of eight years \nindicates that she is displaying symptoms of active trauma and PTSD:  she is barely sleeping, has \npersistent nightmares, and experiences brief but repeated dissociative episodes.  \nPage 18 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W. FIFTH AVENUE \nPORTLAND, OREGON  97204 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-BR    Document 1    Filed 11/01/20    Page 19 of 66\n   \n \n80.  Katie’s job and classwork have suffered because she has found it \nincreasingly difficult to concentrate.  Katie knows the toll that attending the protests is taking on \nher, but she has no intention of quitting. \nE.  Defendants Discriminate Against People with Mobility Disabilities.  \n81.  Defendants have systematically discriminated against protesters, members \nof the press, and others with mobility disabilities at protests.  Defendants and their officers and \nagents routinely use force against people at protests, even those who are attempting to comply \nwith law enforcement orders, fail to ensure that people with mobility disabilities have safe routes \nof egress from protests, and even block persons with mobility disabilities from leaving. \n82.  For example, because of Melissa’s connective tissue disorder, Ehlers-\nDanlos syndrome, she is unable to run without risking severe injury and lasting pain.  Like \ncountless others, as a result of her disability and Defendants’ failures to accommodate, Melissa \nhas been subjected to tear gas, flashbang grenades, baton strikes, rubber bullets, pepper balls, \nshoving, and other unnecessary uses of force by Defendants on numerous occasions, simply \nbecause her disability prevents from her from complying as quickly as demanded by Defendants.   \n83.  The first time Melissa was subjected to use of force on account of her \ndisability was May 31, 2020.   \n84.  On May 31, 2020, Melissa was in a crowd of protesters when she saw PPB \nofficers in full riot gear use indiscriminate force against protesters for behavior as minor as \nshaking the fence around the Justice Center.   \n85.  PPB provided verbal warnings before using force, but the crowd was so \ntightly packed that Melissa was physically unable to leave before police fired tear gas and \nflashbang grenades into the crowd.  Unable to run or see because of the burning pain from the \ngas, Melissa stumbled home. \nPage 19 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W. FIFTH AVENUE \nPORTLAND, OREGON  97204 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-BR    Document 1    Filed 11/01/20    Page 20 of 66\n   \n \n86.  On June 12, 2020, Melissa was in the crowd again when PPB officers \nreacted to shaking of the fence around the Justice Center with overwhelming force without \nproviding sufficient notice for her to disperse.  Although Melissa was not shaking the fence, her \nhands were raised, and she posed no threat to officers, PPB officers shot Melissa in the leg from \nless than three feet away with a foam baton.   \n87.  In severe pain, Melissa went to the emergency room.  As a result of the \nunnecessary use of force and Melissa’s susceptibility to injury, she was diagnosed with IT band \nsyndrome, a syndrome affecting the ligaments that connect the hip to the shin.  Afterwards, she \nhad to take opiates to control the pain, and her leg could not bear weight.  She needed to use \ncrutches for two weeks, and, later, a cane.  Even now, Melissa must wear leg braces every day; \nbefore, she only required them occasionally.   \n88.  Melissa was unable to attend protests for weeks after her injury, but she \ncontinued to monitor the protests online via livestream.  On June 19, 2020, for example, Melissa \nobserved Defendants bull rush protesters without warning. \n89.  By mid-July, Melissa had recovered enough to start attending the protests \nfour days a week.  On or about July 16, 2020, Melissa observed BORTAC and other federal \nDefendants working in tandem with PPB officers.  BORTAC agents fired teargas and flashbang \ngrenades into a group of protesters assembled at Chapman Square Park before rushing protesters \nin an effort that appeared to be coordinated with PPB.  PPB officers and federal agents stood \nshoulder to shoulder as they dispersed the crowd.  Melissa received only seconds of notice before \nthe rush.  She was forced to run for several blocks, resulting in shin splints and enormous \nongoing pain. \n90.  Melissa’s experiences have led her to feel fear of law enforcement \nviolence resulting from Defendants’ failure to accommodate her disability by giving sufficient \nnotice. On many occasions, this fear has caused Melissa to leave protests earlier than she wished.  \nPage 20 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W. FIFTH AVENUE \nPORTLAND, OREGON  97204 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-BR    Document 1    Filed 11/01/20    Page 21 of 66\n   \n \nOn or about July 19, 2020, Melissa left the protest early rather than face violence and law \nenforcement bull rushes.  After Melissa left, DHS agents gave only a minute’s notice before \nchasing protesters from 3rd to 14th Street.   \n91.  On August 7, 2020, Melissa attended a protest at the Multnomah County \nSheriff’s office.  Melissa was conspicuously marked with her press credentials and helmet \nlabeled “press.”  That evening, PPB officers declared an unlawful assembly and bull rushed the \ngathered protesters, striking them with batons and fists.   \n92.  Although Melissa was lawfully on the sidewalk with a group of eight to \nten other members of the press, police yelled at the group to move. As Melissa attempted to \ncomply, an officer struck her with a baton in the back of her head just below her helmet, where \nher neck and head meet.  The officer shoved Melissa hard for not moving quickly enough.  \nMelissa went to the hospital the next day and received a cervical collar neck brace.  Her CT scan \nrevealed inflammation and a hematoma.   \n93.  On or about August 9, 2020, Melissa attended a protest at the Justice \nCenter.  Multnomah County Sheriffs’ deputies forcibly removed her from the area, along with \nother press and protesters, so officers would have a clear path to the parking lot.  The deputies \nprovided no warning before they began screaming at the group to move, striking them, and \npushing them hard with batons.   \n94.  Melissa complied with the deputies’ directions, and she was on the \nsidewalk, where a temporary restraining order said she had a right to be.  Nonetheless, the \ndeputies pulled Melissa by her backpack, shoved her shoulders, and struck her ribs with a baton \nfor not moving quickly enough.  But Melissa feared that she might twist her ankle or worse if she \nmoved any faster.  When Melissa told the deputies she was complying, they told her to turn \naround and stop filming.  At no time did the deputies communicate to Melissa, other members of \nPage 21 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W. FIFTH AVENUE \nPORTLAND, OREGON  97204 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-BR    Document 1    Filed 11/01/20    Page 22 of 66\n   \n \nthe press, or the protesters where they should be; instead, the deputies pushed, pulled, and jabbed \nthem with batons.   \n95.  On or about August 21, 2020, Melissa was at an action in front of the ICE \ndetention center in Portland when DHS and other federal agents fired teargas, flashbang \ngrenades, and pepper balls at peaceful protesters. Melissa was conspicuously marked as a \nmember of the press and had no one in her immediate vicinity.  Nevertheless, DHS agents \nintentionally threw a teargas canister at her, hitting her in the head.  Melissa went to the \nemergency room where she was diagnosed with a concussion and a large hematoma.   \n96.  On September 6, 2020, Melissa was present on the 100th night of protests \nin Portland.  She saw law enforcement, including PPB and OSP, act in concert to quash a protest \nin Ventura Park before it even began.   \n97.  Protesters planned to march from Ventura Park, to PPB’s East Precinct, \nand back to the park.  Some of the protesters then planned to return to the precinct for a separate \ndirect action later that night.  However, PPB and OSP announced that the protesters were not \nallowed to leave the park.  A single person in the crowd—suspected to have been a right-wing \nagitator—then threw Molotov cocktails, which struck protesters and journalists over 100 feet \naway from the line of riot police that had already formed.  They landed nowhere near the police. \n98.  In response to the single person’s actions, PPB and OSP launched a flurry \nof tear gas canisters at the crowd in the park.  For several hours, officers repeatedly prevented \nprotesters from dispersing.  \n99.  At approximately 1:15 a.m., PPB announced that the park had closed at \n10:00 p.m.  The police charged, taking down protesters, medics, and members of the press at a \nfull sprint.  Melissa maneuvered behind the riot line, where she filmed the police tackling a \nprotester. \nPage 22 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W. FIFTH AVENUE \nPORTLAND, OREGON  97204 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-BR    Document 1    Filed 11/01/20    Page 23 of 66\n   \n \n100.  Melissa heard another officer yell that the park was closed.  As Melissa \nbegan to leave, an officer tackled her.  Melissa attempted to pick up her camera and other \nbelongings, politely telling the officer that she was moving as quickly as she could.   \n101.  Melissa was only three feet away when the officer tackled her again.  She \nfinally made it back to the press line, dazed and winded after being knocked down twice.  \nAnother journalist saw her and said, “he just kept pushing you over.”   \n102.  Melissa went to the ER.  She was diagnosed with whiplash and contusions \non her left shoulder blade, knees, and thorax.   \n103.  On September 18, 2020, Melissa attended a protest near ICE headquarters.  \nDHS agents fired a barrage of teargas, hundreds of pepper balls, and stingers.  Melissa used a \ndoor to shield herself, but she was shot in the leg seven times.   \n104.  Later that night, PPB officers and DHS agents coordinated to surround \nprotesters, and Melissa stood on the tailgate of a truck to film them.  DHS and BORTAC agents \nused more tear gas than Melissa had ever seen, blanketing several blocks, and PPB officers \nbegan making arrests.  One officer grabbed Melissa by her backpack and threw her off the truck, \nknocking the wind out of her and causing severe pain as her back and hips hit the curb. \n105.  Melissa went to the emergency room and was prescribed oxycodone for \nher continuing pain.   \n106.  On September 23, 2020, PPB declared a riot after someone set a small fire.  \nOfficers pushed protesters from the Multnomah County Detention Center to Broadway Street.  \nPPB officers harassed protesters who tried to leave, and Melissa filmed them.   \n107.  A person of color approached to ask the police to let the protesters out.  \nMelissa and Scott, another journalist, stepped up to film the interaction.  Melissa and Scott were \nin the crosswalk and were not interfering with police.   \nPage 23 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W. FIFTH AVENUE \nPORTLAND, OREGON  97204 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-BR    Document 1    Filed 11/01/20    Page 24 of 66\n   \n \n108.  PPB Officer #148051, ignoring the protesters, approached aggressively \nand screamed at Scott to move back and get on the sidewalk.  Scott and Melissa immediately \nbegan backing up.  They were only feet from the sidewalk.  Melissa told the officer that she was \ntrying to comply, but the officer shoved her forcefully.  Melissa stumbled, her foot caught the \ncurb, and she fell hard.   \n109.  Melissa felt a snap and pop inside her ankle.  The intense pain stole her \nbreath.  She thought that the officer had torn the stitching surrounding the internal brace that \nprevents her tendons and ligaments from tearing.  Medics arrived, bracing her foot and ankle, \nand calling for an evacuation team to take her to the emergency room. \n110.  At the emergency room, Melissa learned that she had likely torn tendons \nand ligaments in the lateral or posterior ankle, where she had previously had multiple surgeries.  \nShe received a referral to an orthopedic surgeon.  Although Melissa was in agonizing pain, the \nemergency room could not provide pain medication because of strict opioid restrictions.  \nAfterwards, Melissa had to wear a walking boot and an air cast. \n111.  The constant stress and fear has taken an emotional toll on Melissa.  Since \nshe began attending protests regularly, Melissa has lost approximately thirty pounds. \nF.   Defendants Discriminate Against People with Photosensitive Epilepsy. \n112.  Defendants discriminate against people with epilepsy at protests.  \nDefendants’ use of strobe lights is a significant trigger for people with photosensitive epilepsy.  \nUse of strobes disorients protesters and stymies identification of police involved in brutal \nactions. \n113.  In addition to EDS, Melissa also has photosensitive epilepsy.  Law \nenforcement has subjected her repeatedly to strobe lights, many times intentionally and after she \ntold the officers about her epilepsy.   \nPage 24 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W. FIFTH AVENUE \nPORTLAND, OREGON  97204 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-BR    Document 1    Filed 11/01/20    Page 25 of 66\n   \n \n114.  When Melissa is confronted with a strobe light, she must turn around, find \na dark corner, and put her head down to avert a grand mal or petit mal seizure.  Even brief \nexposures to strobe lights can induce a petit mal, or absence, seizure.  When confronted with a \nstrobe light, Melissa becomes impossibly tired, loses time, and can become stuck, so that she has \nto be pulled away by her companions before a grand mal seizure occurs.  A friend must tell her \nwhen the strobe has stopped and it is safe to turn around.   \n115.  Melissa’s worst possible fear is having a grand mal seizure at a protest.  A \npetit mal seizure would cause her to briefly lose consciousness.  A grand mal seizure would \ncause her to lose consciousness, collapse, and experience muscle spasms.   \n116.  Melissa normally has two petit mal seizures per month.  After persistent \nexposure to the use of strobe lights by law enforcement, Melissa experienced two grand mal \nseizures in the month of July in addition to absence seizures.    \n117.  Although Defendants have used strobe lights pervasively, one officer has \nrepeatedly gone out of his way to use strobe lights against Melissa specifically after Melissa and \nothers repeatedly told him that she has photosensitive epilepsy.  The officer, PPB Officer \n#1004013 with helmet number 22, is so notorious for brute force that a parody account was \ncreated for him on Twitter.  He only appears to use the strobe on Melissa, targeting her \nspecifically because of her known epilepsy.   \n118.  PPB Officer #1004013 has used a strobe against Melissa on more than \neight separate occasions, despite being well aware of her epilepsy.  When Melissa told him about \nher disability, he told her “well, then go away” and continued using the strobe against her. \nG.  Defendants Discriminate Against People with Psychiatric Disabilities and \nService Animals. \n119.  The PPB has a well-documented history of brutality and discrimination \nagainst people with psychiatric disabilities. \nPage 25 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

In 2012, the United States Department of Justice found that PPB “engages \nin a pattern or practice of unnecessary or unreasonable force during interactions with people who \nhave or are perceived to have psychiatric disabilities.”3  The DOJ found “a pattern of dangerous \nuses of force against persons who posed little or no threat and who could not, as a result of their \npsychiatric disabilities, comply with officers’ commands,” including “practices that escalate the \nuse of force where there were clear earlier junctures when the force could have been avoided or \nminimized.”4  These practices, the DOJ concluded, resulted from “deficiencies in policy, \ntraining, and supervision.”5   \n121.  As recently as early 2020, then-police Chief Jami Resch acknowledged \nthat the DOJ’s consent decree would not stop police from shooting suspects with psychiatric \ndisabilities.6  In 2019, fatal police shootings of suspects with mental health disabilities actually \nincreased.7  Indeed, as City Commissioner JoAnn Hardesty remarked, “We’re killing more \npeople today with mental-health issues by the Portland Police than we did before the DOJ came \nto town.”8   \n                                                 \n3 Portland Police Bureau Findings Letter at 1.   \n4 Id. at 2 \n5 Id. at 3.  \n6 Maxine Bernstein, Justice Department Finds Portland Police in ‘Substantial Compliance’ with \nRequired Reforms, The Oregonian, Jan. 24, 2020, available at \nhttps://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2020/01/justice-department-finds-portland-police-in-\nsubstantial-compliance-with-required-reforms.html (quoting then-Chief Resch that belief that \nsettlement would end fatal shootings of people in crisis was a “common misconception”).  \n7 Maxine Bernstein, New Portland Police Chief Jami Resch talks officer shortages, protests and \npeople in crisis, available at: https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2020/01/new-portland-police-\nchief-jami-resch-talks-officer-shortages-protests-and-people-in-crisis.html \n8 Tim Dickinson, Progressive City, Brutal Police, available at: \nhttps://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/portand-oregon-police-brutality-history-\n1027677/ \nPage 26 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W. FIFTH AVENUE \nPORTLAND, OREGON  97204 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-BR    Document 1    Filed 11/01/20    Page 27 of 66\n   \n \n122.  Juniper is a person with a psychiatric disability:  complex PTSD.  The \nsymptoms of PTSD differ between individuals; for Juniper, it manifests as obsessive-compulsive \ntendencies, hypervigilance, panic attacks, and dissociative episodes.  Being in crowds or \notherwise surrounded by people often exacerbates these symptoms, as does being touched or \nstartled by strangers.  As a result, it is nearly impossible for Juniper to go out in public or interact \nwith others for any significant length of time.  Despite this, Juniper protests to express their \npolitical beliefs. \n123.  In order to manage and mitigate their symptoms, Juniper relies on \nWallace, a trained service dog.  Juniper and Wallace have been working together since 2016.  \nWallace has been trained as a service animal by Kayse Fletcher of Compass Key Service Dog \nTraining.  Kayse continues to train Wallace as needed.  Wallace wears a yellow service dog vest \nwhen out with Juniper. \n124.  Wallace performs a variety of tasks to assist with Juniper’s disability, \nincluding but not limited to: accompanying Juniper in public; being vigilant of Juniper’s \nsurroundings and “alert barking,” (i.e., barking to notify Juniper that someone is approaching \nthem); and providing physical contact with Juniper when they experience a heightened emotional \nresponse.  As part of his training, and to further mitigate Juniper’s anxiety, Wallace is taught to \nbe unflappable and minimally responsive to outside stimuli.  Wallace is also trained to not \nescalate a confrontation or physically defend Juniper. \n125.  Because of Wallace’s presence, Juniper has been able to attend protests in \ndowntown Portland several nights a week since June.  Because of Defendants’ pervasive use of \nchemical agents at protests, Juniper must engage in substantial planning to protect themselves \nand Wallace, including bringing their car and buying plastic drop cloths to scoop up Wallace in \ncase of chemical exposure. \nPage 27 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W. FIFTH AVENUE \nPORTLAND, OREGON  97204 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-BR    Document 1    Filed 11/01/20    Page 28 of 66\n   \n \n126.  On July 7, 2020, Juniper was attending a protest with Wallace when \nfederal officers began swarming protesters, throwing flashbangs, and firing tear gas. One \nflashbang exploded about twenty feet from Wallace and startled him. \n127.  Since then, Wallace has become hyperaware of and easily startled by loud \nnoises.  He also refuses to walk through any kind of smoke, including wafting barbecue smoke. \n128.  On July 9, 2020, Juniper was on the sidewalk at SW 2nd and Jefferson \nbehind the Wyatt Building in downtown Portland, marking the property line with surveyor’s \nchalk.  Wallace was with them.  Although the Wyatt Building is federal property, most of the \nsidewalk is City property.  Juniper was marking the line to prevent fellow protesters from \ninadvertently trespassing and risking arrest by federal officers.   \n129.  Federal officers approached from the Wyatt Building and surrounded \nJuniper.  Juniper was concerned that the officers would arrest them.  Juniper stated that they had \nPTSD, that Wallace was their service dog, and that officers should not unexpectedly surround \nthem in that manner.  The officers withdrew without taking further action. \n130.  The next night, July 10, 2020, Juniper and Wallace went back to the Wyatt \nBuilding to mark the property line again.  Juniper tethered Wallace to a large water bottle; this is \na standard practice for them. \n131.  Without any prior warning, federal officers emerged from the Wyatt \nBuilding.  They attempted to grab Juniper and triggered an immediate panic response.  Juniper \ndove towards Wallace, who was standing still and “alert barking.”  More officers arrived, \nsurrounded Juniper, and tackled them to the ground.  These were the same officers who had \nsurrounded Juniper the night before and learned that doing so exacerbates Juniper’s PTSD. \n132.  The officers’ behavior triggered a dissociative panic attack.  Juniper’s \nbody locked up and they started screaming in anticipation of the brutal assault that they believed \nwas coming.  During such panic attacks, physical touch with Wallace is incredibly important for \nPage 28 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W. FIFTH AVENUE \nPORTLAND, OREGON  97204 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-BR    Document 1    Filed 11/01/20    Page 29 of 66\n   \n \nJuniper, as Wallace’s presence helps emotionally ground them.  Juniper was also worried that the \nofficers would see Wallace as a threat and hurt him, so they reached for Wallace to protect him.  \nJuniper put their arms around Wallace, but the officers grabbed Wallace and pulled him out of \nJuniper’s grasp.  The officers squeezed Wallace so hard that he defecated, then yanked him away \nby his collar. \n133.  After removing Wallace, the officers sprayed Juniper with pepper-spray at \npoint-blank range and put them in metal handcuffs.  Within minutes, Juniper’s left pinky began \nto go numb.  Juniper notified the agents, but they did not loosen the handcuffs. Six officers lifted \nJuniper, whose entire body was now rigid, and carried them into the Wyatt Building while \napproximately nine other officers formed a perimeter around them.  In total, fifteen officers, all \nfully armed, surrounded Juniper before dragging them from city property into the Wyatt \nBuilding. \n134.  Juniper was covered with mace and having a dissociative panic attack.  \nNormally, this was when Wallace could ease Juniper’s anxiety through physical contact.  \nInstead, the officers needlessly separated Juniper and Wallace for the next nine hours. \n135.  Juniper told the officers that they were a woman and that their pronouns \nwere they/them.  But throughout the night, federal officers repeatedly misgendered Juniper, \nsuggesting that the officers would only treat Juniper as a woman if they “looked like it” and \nrefusing Juniper’s requests to be searched by a female officer, stating “we don’t do that here.”  \nDHS officers looked through Juniper’s money clip and removed their US Passport ID card, \nwhich indicated Juniper is legally female.  Regardless, the officers continued to misgender \nJuniper throughout their detainment.  Given that Juniper’s PTSD is rooted in years of gender \ndysphoria and transphobic assaults, this persistent denial of their gender identity only served to \nworsen Juniper’s mental health crisis. \nPage 29 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

The officers seated Juniper on the floor in the foyer of the Wyatt Building \nwith pepper-spray covering their face and clothes.  A burning sensation had spread through \nJuniper’s face, lungs, nose, and mouth, and their heart rate was continually elevated as a result of \nboth the mace and the continuing panic attack.  The officers refused to call medical personnel to \nflush Juniper’s eyes or nose, leaving them the choice of continuing to burn or having untrained \nofficers attempt to do so.  Juniper again told the officers that they had a disability and were in \ncrisis; the officers told them to “buck up” and to “relax and breathe.”  Juniper again notified the \nofficers that their hands were going numb, but the officers did not adjust the metal handcuffs. \n137.  Officers attempted to question Juniper about their activities that evening.  \nJuniper repeatedly requested a lawyer and medical attention.  Neither were provided.  Juniper \nrecognized the badge number of the officer questioning them and knew the officer had been \npresent the night before when they disclosed their PTSD. \n138.  Eventually, the officers carried Juniper to the basement garage of the \nWyatt Building, Mirandized them, and told them that they were being arrested for spray-painting \nfederal property.  After about half an hour in the garage, Portland Fire and Rescue arrived and \nattempted, unsuccessfully, to flush out Juniper’s eyes and nose.  This exacerbated Juniper’s \nsymptoms and made them feel as though they were drowning. Fire and Rescue refused to remove \nJuniper’s contacts. \n139.  Throughout their two-hour detention at the Wyatt Building, the officers \nrefused to release Juniper from handcuffs or reposition them, even though they repeatedly \ninsisted that the cuffs were unnecessarily tight and that their hands were going numb.  Much of \nthe time, Juniper was laying on their side with their hands cuffed behind their back. \n140.  After the Wyatt Building, the officers used an unmarked SUV to transfer \nJuniper and Wallace to the custody of the U.S. Marshals at the federal courthouse.  Before, \nduring, and after transport, the officers put a spit hood on Juniper’s head.  The hood trapped the \nPage 30 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

Juniper could hear Wallace in the back of the car, but they only made brief physical \ncontact. \n141.  At the courthouse, the Marshals took Juniper out of wrist cuffs and placed \nthem in a holding cell for six hours in leg cuffs.  They took Wallace to the courthouse garage and \ntethered him to a truck.  Throughout Juniper’s detention, Wallace did not receive food, water or \nany opportunity to relieve himself.  Juniper’s cell had no potable water, soap, or hand sanitizer.  \n142.  While Juniper was in the holding cell, their mental state continued to \ndeteriorate.  They began to dissociate, talking to themselves, scratching themselves, and tapping \ntheir head against the wall.  They experienced minor convulsions down the left side of their \nbody.  At one point a Marshal came and asked Juniper if they were okay.  Juniper said, “No.”  \nThe Marshal told Juniper that their dog was still in the garage and walked away.  It is difficult to \nknow when precisely in the detention this was, as Juniper’s mental health crisis had warped their \nsense of linear time.  Juniper told the Marshals or officers that they needed to take medication at \nregular times throughout the day, and that the medication was with their personal effects.  The \nMarshals or officers withheld Juniper’s medication.   \n143.  DHS officials came and informed Juniper that they were being charged \nwith refusing to comply, resisting arrest, and assaulting an officer.  They also told Juniper that \nthey would be transferred to Multnomah County Jail, a facility that would not accept Wallace. \n144.  The officials told Juniper that if no one came to pick up Wallace, Wallace \nwould go to a shelter, and that “he won’t be there when you get out.”  Juniper understood this as \na threat to euthanize Wallace while Juniper was detained.  Juniper reiterated their request for a \nlawyer and said that they did not consent to Wallace’s removal from them.   \n145.  After several hours, during which Juniper made multiple requests for her \nservice animal and a lawyer, DHS officials told Juniper that they were going to “cut them a \nPage 31 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W. FIFTH AVENUE \nPORTLAND, OREGON  97204 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-BR    Document 1    Filed 11/01/20    Page 32 of 66\n   \n \nbreak.”   The officials said they would release Juniper with a citation and a future court date \nbecause the County Jail could not be made accessible for them.  The officials returned most of \nJuniper’s possessions and unceremoniously released them and Wallace outside the Courthouse in \nthe middle of the night.  Notably missing from the possessions returned to Juniper was their 2019 \nWomen’s Flat Track Derby Association World Championship medal, which they were wearing \nwhen detained. The medal has not yet been returned to Juniper. \n146.  Since July 10, 2020, Juniper has struggled with neuropathy in their hands \nafter spending hours in handcuffs.  This makes it extremely difficult for them to perform their \njob duties, most of which involve using a computer.  Juniper has experienced heightened \nhypervigilance, especially about police cars, trucks, and cars with tinted windows.  Juniper has \nexperienced bouts of depression and mania, cycling between periods of complete inaction and \ninsomnia-fueled overwork.  In general, Juniper’s social anxiety and agoraphobia are also \nheightened; this makes it challenging for Juniper to engage in ordinary interactions, like \nnecessary shopping trips.  Juniper’s social interaction has decreased, and their withdrawal has \nincreased.  \n147.  Service dogs like Wallace rely on a strong bond with their owner to be \neffective.  Prolonged separation from their owner, especially in high-stress situations, can have a \nnegative impact on a service dog’s psychology and efficacy.  Since being separated, Wallace has \nshown symptoms of elevated attachment, including not staying outside to go to the bathroom by \nhimself, but requiring Juniper to accompany him. \n148.  Since July 10, 2020, Wallace has suffered a marked regression in his \ntraining and behavior.  Wallace has returned to Casey for supplemental training, and Juniper has \nresorted to using rewards to incentivize behaviors that had been deeply ingrained for years.  \nWallace is now concerned for his own safety as well as Juniper’s; that is unusual and, for a \npsychiatric service dog, counterproductive. \nPage 32 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

Wallace’s regression has made it much more difficult for Juniper to attend \nprotests as they once did.  Wallace will not leave Juniper’s car in downtown Portland.  Since \nJuniper cannot go far from Wallace without adverse health consequences for both of them, they \nare essentially tethered to the car.  Juniper’s participation in the protests has predominantly been \nlimited to support work at off-site locations. \n150.  Defendants’ incessant use of tear gas, flashbang grenades, and other \nmunitions pose a significant, continued threat to both Wallace and Juniper’s wellbeing by \nexacerbating Juniper’s PTSD and preventing Wallace from effectively mitigating Juniper’s \nsymptoms.   \n151.  The presence of heavily armed police officers, in particular those who \nwear riot gear and camouflage and appear without warning, puts Juniper and Wallace into states \nof hypervigilance that prevent normal social functioning and create physical symptoms. On \nmultiple occasions, during protests and at other times of day, merely arriving downtown triggers \nanxiety attacks in Juniper that manifest in elevated heart rate, sweating, convulsions like those \nexperienced while in custody, and hyperventilation.  \n152.  Use of chemical weapons without proper cleanup have also rendered the \nground and air physically unsafe for Wallace and other service animals, as many of the weapons \nare exceptionally toxic to dogs. \nH.  Defendants’ Use of Tear Gas and Other Chemical Agents Threatens the \nLives of People with Disabilities. \n153.  Defendants’ use of chemical agents, including those in tear gas, smoke \ngrenades, mace, and pepper balls, poses an extraordinary risk to the health and safety of people \nwith disabilities.  People with disabilities that involve respiratory functions or inflammatory \nconditions (such as endometriosis) are at significant risk of exacerbated symptoms, long term \ndamage, and even death.   \nPage 33 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

Chemical agents like tear gas are so noxious that they were banned in war \nunder the 1928 Geneva Protocol.9  The CDC’s own website labels these agents as poison, \nreferring to exposure as “poisoning” for which “no antidote exists.”10  Yet, as detailed above, \nDefendants have regularly employed these agents against those who attend protests in Portland, \nand they have saturated the City with toxic chemicals. \n155.  Exposure to substances like tear gas immediately causes the following \nsymptoms:  excessive tearing, burning, blurred vision, and reddened eyes; runny nose, burning, \nand nasal swelling; burning and irritated mouth, difficulty swallowing, and drooling; chest \ntightness, coughing, a choking sensation, wheezing, and shortness of breath; skin burns and \nrashes; and nausea and vomiting.11  Significant exposure can cause blindness, glaucoma, and \ncataracts, as well as severe chemical burns to the throat and lungs and respiratory failure, which \ncan result in death.12   \n156.  Tear gas and other inhaled chemicals are especially harmful for people \nwith asthma, emphysema, bronchitis, and other respiratory illnesses.  The chemicals significantly \nexacerbate these conditions, triggering asthma attacks and other forms of severe respiratory \ndistress, as well as long term damage.13   \n                                                 \n9 https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~hsp/1925.html \n10 CDC, Facts About Riot Control Agents Interim document, available at: \nhttps://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/riotcontrol/factsheet.asp \n11 Id. \n12 Id.  \n13 Morman, et al., Riot Control Agents: Systemic Reassessment of Adverse effects on Health, \nMental Stability, and Social Inequities, available at: https://www.dontshootpdx.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/06/DSPFinal-RCAreport4SocialChange-AM.AR_.ZW_.DS-.pdf \nPage 34 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

Some activists in Portland have reported to DRO and Plaintiffs’ counsel \nthat tear gas and other chemicals significantly aggravate their inflammatory conditions, like \nendometriosis and fibromyalgia, causing intense and more frequent pain.   \n158.  The effect on people with endometriosis, a painful inflammatory condition \nin which uterine tissue grows outside the uterus, is particularly marked.  Tear gas has been linked \nwith increased bleeding, severe cramping, more frequent and disrupted menstruation cycles and \neven miscarriages in people whose uteruses are otherwise healthy.14  The impact on those with \nendometriosis is even more severe, given the extreme pain that accompanies menstruation.   \n159.  Defendants use tear gas and other chemicals indiscriminately and \nvoluminously in Portland, blanketing a wide swath of the City sometimes dozens of times each \nnight.15  The chemicals do not simply blow away in the wind.  They leave behind a residue that \nlingers for weeks16 and can continue to cause deleterious health effects long after.17  People \nrepresented by DRO have reported that their asthma is triggered by simply walking into a park or \nother areas of the City the day after tear gas has been used.   \n160.  When dispersed in aerosolized form, tear gas and other chemicals do not \nisolate themselves to the immediate vicinity in which they are used.  They adhere to surfaces \n                                                 \n14 Catherine Ryan Gregory, Tear Gaslighting: Is There a Link Between Protesting and Messed \nUp Periods?, available at: https://www.marieclaire.com/health-fitness/a33648135/tear-gas-\neffects-reproductive-system/ \n15 According to research from the University of Portland, the City was gassed at least 181 times \nbetween May 29, 2020, and July 15, 2020 alone, id., before some of the most egregious incidents \ndetailed in this Complaint.  \n16 Id.  \n17 Lisa Song, Tear Gas Is Way More Dangerous Than Police Let On — Especially During the \nCoronavirus Pandemic, available at: https://www.propublica.org/article/tear-gas-is-way-more-\ndangerous-than-police-let-on-especially-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic \nPage 35 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

We are now in the midst of the horrifying COVID-19 pandemic, which is \nspread through respiratory droplets and which has already caused the deaths of over 200,000 \npeople.  But tear gas and other chemical agents cause coughing and choking, which create \nrespiratory droplets and contribute to the spread of COVID-19.  For this reason, the use of \nchemical agents is particularly concerning for people with compromised immune systems who \nare at a heightened risk of severe complications from COVID-19. \n162.  For these reasons, 1,288 public health professionals signed an open letter \n“Oppos[ing] any use of tear gas, smoke, or other respiratory irritants, which could increase risk \nfor COVID-19 by making the respiratory tract more susceptible to infection, exacerbating \nexisting inflammation, and inducing coughing.”21 \nI.  Defendants Are Well Aware of the Need for Reasonable Modifications and \nEffective Communication but Refuse to Act. \n163.  It is obvious that people with disabilities require reasonable modifications \nand effective communication at protests.  Defendants have an affirmative obligation to make \ntheir programs and services accessible, including programs and services related to law \nenforcement.  Failing to provide accessible services related to law enforcement at protests \neffectively denies equal access to the right to protest and creates immeasurable dangers for \n                                                 \n18 Tear Gaslighting, supra, at 15. \n19 Latisha Jensen, Portland Settles With Downtown Resident Whose Apartment Filled With Tear \nGas, available at: https://www.wweek.com/news/courts/2020/07/26/portland-settles-with-\ndowntown-resident-whose-apartment-filled-with-tear-gas/ \n20 Maxine Bernstein, Downtown jail inmates hitting panic buttons due to tear gas wafting into \ncells, lawyers say, available at: https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2020/07/downtown-jail-\ninmates-hitting-panic-buttons-due-to-tear-gas-wafting-into-cells-lawyers-say.html \n21 Available at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jyfn4Wd2i6bRi12ePghMHtX3ys1b7K1A/view \nPage 36 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

Defendants should provide reasonable modifications and effective \ncommunication to protesters with disabilities as a matter of course. \n164.  The PPB has enacted policies to allow protesters without disabilities to \navoid harm by police officers. For example, PPB Directive 0635.10, entitled “Crowd \nManagement/Crowd Control,”22 provides that when feasible, police should make “loud, \nintelligible and consistent announcements and warnings to the crowd […] to allow the crowd \ntime to comply with orders given from police members.”  Before taking action to disperse a \ncrowd, the police should order the crowd to disperse, and should only use riot control agents \n(such as teargas) “when avenues of escape (i.e., clear path or route) are available to the crowd.” \nPolice can detain protesters after “providing a lawful order to disperse followed by a reasonable \nopportunity to comply with that order.” \n165.  Upon information and belief, PPB has not enacted any similar policies to \nprovide protesters with disabilities an equal opportunity to avoid harm by police officers. Upon \ninformation and belief, there are no directives requiring sign language interpreters to \ncommunicate dispersal warnings or other orders, providing people with mobility disabilities an \naccessible route to escape teargas, or otherwise providing modifications to ensure that people \nwith disabilities have a reasonable opportunity to comply with dispersal orders. \n166.  Before filing suit, Plaintiffs and others have repeatedly notified Defendants \nthat they have an obligation to provide modifications and make law enforcement actions at \nprotests accessible to people with disabilities.  Defendants have been notified of the need for \nmodifications by numerous people on a variety of social media platforms, including Twitter, \n                                                 \n22 https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/649358. According to the website, this \nDirective is \"currently under review.” Plaintiffs will pay attention to any changes made in the \nfuture. \nPage 37 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

In response, Defendants have done nothing.   \n167.  On July 23, 2020, Philip informed Mayor Wheeler directly of the need for \nmodifications for persons with disabilities, including people who are Deaf or hard of hearing.23  \nEarlier in the day, Philip asked Wheeler on Twitter whether he would be providing any \naccommodations; after receiving no response, Philip addressed Wheeler at the protest and \ninformed him directly of the need for modifications.  In response, Wheeler indicated that an ASL \ninterpreter had accompanied him that evening.  Unbeknownst to Wheeler, however, Philip had \narranged for and hired the interpreter.  When Philip informed Wheeler of this fact, Wheeler \ncould only move on to the next protester’s question in embarrassment.  Philip and the interpreter \nthen left. \n168.  Similarly, Melissa e-mailed Wheeler and the City’s ADA coordinator \ndirectly, and notified numerous law enforcement officers and agents, about the impact that strobe \nlights have on her epilepsy.  Neither Wheeler nor the ADA coordinator responded.  On the other \nhand, multiple officers told her that, if she was so affected, she should not be protesting.  In fact, \nPPB Officer #1004013, a Doe Defendant, has repeatedly gone out of his way to strobe Melissa \nafter being notified of Melissa’s epilepsy.   \n169.  Officers have told other protesters with disabilities that they should not be \nout protesting.   After officers shoved the protesters and told them to move faster, the protesters \ntold officers of their mobility related disabilities.  The officers, faced with these pleas, told the \nprotesters they did not belong and continued to shove and scream at them.24 \n                                                 \n23 Wheeler and others were tear gassed by Department of Homeland Security agents later that \nevening. \n24 See, e.g., https://mobile.twitter.com/griffinmalone6/status/1291644306323673090?s=21 \nPage 38 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

In addition to the efforts of individual Plaintiffs and other community \nmembers, DRO sent letters detailing the need for accommodations to Chief Lovell, Mayor Ted \nWheeler, the City’s ADA coordinator, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon, and Acting \nSecretary Wolfe in late July and early August of 2020.  DRO sent a similar letter to \nSuperintendent Hampton and Sheriff Reese in early September.   \n171.  DRO’s letters explained the issues that impact people who use service \ndogs, are Deaf or hard of hearing, are blind or low vision, have asthma, mobility-based \ndisabilities, and epilepsy, and who have inflammatory conditions.  The letters explicitly \nrequested reasonable accommodations and modifications of tactics on behalf of protesters with \ndisabilities.    \n172.  To date, only PPB and the City have responded to those letters. On \nSeptember 17, 2020, DRO and Plaintiffs’ counsel met with PPB and the City to discuss the \nongoing issues regarding the lack of reasonable modifications for protesters with disabilities and \ncontinuing violence at the hands of PPB. During those discussions, PPB and the City \nacknowledged that they do not have any policies governing police interactions with protesters \nwith disabilities.  \n173.  On October 8, 2020 via email communication, the City stated that it could \nnot provide ASL interpreters onsite at demonstrations to communicate PPB instructions to Deaf \nand hard of hearing protesters.  \n174.  On October 14, 2020, DRO and Plaintiffs’ counsel met for a second time \nwith PPB and the City to discuss their concerns. PPB and the City would not provide any \nconcrete steps, plans, or timelines to ensure that protesters with disabilities are afforded their \nconstitutional rights and to prevent undue force and discrimination against them.  Indeed, PPB \nmade clear that any potential steps they could take would be subject to a lengthy bureaucratic \napproval process that could take weeks or even months.     \nPage 39 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

Acting Director Wolfe has repeatedly and publicly justified the actions of \nDHS agents while ignoring Plaintiffs’ requests for modifications.   \n176.  Rather than showing any inclination to provide reasonable modifications to \nor respect the constitutional rights of people with disabilities, the prevailing sentiment from \nDefendants has been that protesting is only for people who do not have disabilities.   \n177.  The PPB, DHS, U.S. Marshals, OSP, and MCSO have all responded with \nforce to various protests in the City of Portland since May 2020. Defendants have often \ncollaborated and worked jointly in devising responses to specific protests.  \n178.  For instance, in September 2020, federal authorities deputized dozens of \nmembers of both PPB and MCSO to serve as federal deputies in responding to these protests. \nFifty OSP troopers were federally deputized in August 2020 for the purpose of allowing joint \noperations between OSP and the federal authorities. Oregon Governor Kate Brown has on some \noccasions created a unified command allowing joint command and control for OSP and MCSO \nin responding to protests. Protesters have witnessed obviously coordinated action between \nfederal and local authorities in responding to the protests. \n179.  Each Defendant has coordinated its response to the protests with other \nagencies.  Each Defendant has individually and jointly failed to provide reasonable modifications \nto protesters with disabilities.  None of the agencies communicate reasonably accessible notice to \nprotesters who are Deaf or hard of hearing before using force or making arrests.  None of the \nagencies appropriately restrict the use of tear gas, bull rush charges, strobes, or other force \nagainst protesters with disabilities.  After DRO submitted requests for modifications to the \nagencies, none of the agencies adopted reasonable modifications that would adequately provide \nequal access to protesters with disabilities. \n180.  Plaintiffs have made every effort to resolve these issues short of litigation.  \nUnfortunately, Defendants’ refusals to act have forced Plaintiffs to file this lawsuit to vindicate \nPage 40 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each of the allegations in \nParagraphs 1 through 180 of this Complaint as if fully set forth here.  \n182.  The ADA and its implementing regulations provide that “no qualified \nindividual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in \nor be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected \nto discrimination by any such entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132; 28 C.F.R. § 35.149.  Title II’s \nrequirements extend to “anything a public entity does,” including arrests and other law \nenforcement interactions.  8 C.F.R. § 35, app. B.  Despite these requirements, Defendants violate \nthe ADA and its implementing regulations in multiple ways.   \n183.  Defendants have an affirmative obligation to make benefits, services, and \nprograms accessible to people with disabilities.  § 35.150.  “The general regulatory obligation to \nmodify policies, practices, or procedures requires law enforcement to make changes in policies \nthat result in discriminatory arrests or abuse of individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. pt. 35, \napp. B.  Defendants, however, have failed to make reasonable modifications that will make law \nenforcement’s actions equally accessible to people with disabilities; indeed, their responses to \nprotests actively deny people with disabilities their rights at protests.   \n184.  The obligation to provide reasonable modifications requires covered \nentities to provide effective communication to people with communication disabilities. \n185.  Defendants fail to provide reasonable modifications, including effective \ncommunication, for people with disabilities at protests.  For Philip and others who are Deaf or \nPage 41 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

To that end, Defendants are \nrequired to “furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to afford individuals \nwith disabilities . . . an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a service, \nprogram, or activity of a public entity.”  § 35.160(b)(1).   \n186.  Defendants make no efforts whatsoever to communicate with protesters \nwho are Deaf or hard of hearing, including when they declare unlawful assemblies and riots and \nissue orders to disperse.  In the same way, Defendants discriminate against Plaintiffs by \ncommunicating about their activities at protests only to protesters who are hearing persons.  \nDefendants’ use of bull rushes and other forms of force violate the rights of people with a variety \nof disabilities, including those with mobility disabilities and those who are blind or low vision.  \nUnlike people without disabilities, Plaintiffs are unable to disperse quickly or respond in the \nsame way to other police commands, putting them at significant risk of violence from \nDefendants.  Use of force by Defendants also has a disproportionate effect on people with \ndisabilities, many of whom heal more slowly and are more susceptible to long-term damage. \n187.  Defendants’ use of strobe lights induces seizures in Melissa and others \nwith epilepsy.  The use of strobes, however, serves no purpose that is not equally served by other \nforms of lighting other than to disorient protesters and stymie efforts to identify officers.   \n188.  Defendants’ use of flashbang grenades, tear gas, and other riot control \nagents, and their separation of people from their service animals, denies people who use service \nanimals the equal opportunity to participate in protests by restricting their ability to attend \nprotests with their animals. \n189.  Defendants’ use of teargas, pepper balls, and other chemical irritants poses \na significant risk of harm or death for people with respiratory and inflammatory conditions.   \nPage 42 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

The lack of clear egress routes for dispersal, and barriers to egress erected \nby Defendants, violate the rights of people with disabilities who are forced to risk stampedes and \ntrampling from other protesters, law enforcement force, and other grievous harm. \n191.  The lack of clear and consistent directions likewise puts Plaintiffs, \nincluding those who are blind and low vision, at significant risk of harm, arrest, and violence.  \n192.  Defendants subject Plaintiffs to use of force and arrest because they \nmistake Plaintiffs’ inaction, delayed action, or slowed action in response to orders to disperse \nand other commands as a refusal to comply.   \n193.  Further, Defendants’ crowd management directives and other measures \nconstitute programs and/or activities under the ADA.  By failing to establish crowd management \nmeasures that permit protesters with disabilities an opportunity to avoid harm by police, \nDefendants have denied those people with disabilities meaningful access to their crowd \nmanagement program/activity. \n194.  Reasonable modifications and effective communication measures are \nreadily available.  For communications with Deaf or hard of hearing protesters, for example, \nASL interpreters and visual messaging systems of the sort already used on the roadside to \ncommunicate closed exits could be effectively employed to notify protesters who are Deaf or \nhard of hearing when an unlawful assembly is declared.  Reasonable modifications might also \ninclude ceasing the use of certain less-lethal weapons and tactics entirely, using them only in \ncircumstances designed to minimize risk to protesters with disabilities, or providing substantial \nverbal and visual warning before using the less-lethal weapons and tactics.  Likewise, \nDefendants can identify and inform protesters of accessible avenues of egress before using force \nor other tactics that may harm people with mobility disabilities. \n195.  Nor would the requested modifications require a fundamental alteration of \nDefendants’ programs and services.  For example, Defendants are already constitutionally \nPage 43 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

As set forth above, Defendants have failed to satisfy their affirmative \nobligation to provide reasonable modifications and auxiliary aids and services that provide equal \naccess, with or without a specific request from a person with a disability.  Defendants have also \nfailed to response to requests for modifications and auxiliary aids and services by individual \nPlaintiffs and others.  \n197.  Defendants failure to provide reasonable modifications and auxiliary aids \nand services was (and continues to be) with deliberate indifference and reckless disregard to the \nrights of people with disabilities.  \n198.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C § 12133, Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory and \ninjunctive relief as well as damages and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. \n \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n (Violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act) \n29 U.S.C. §§ 794 et seq. \nAgainst Defendants City of Portland, Multnomah County, Ted Wheeler, Chuck Lovell, \nMichael Reese, Travis Hampton, Chad Wolfe, and Donald Washington (All in Their \nOfficial Capacities) \n199.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each of the allegations in \nParagraphs 1 through 198 of this Complaint as if fully set forth here.  \n200.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”) and its \nimplementing regulations provide that “[N]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . \nshall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied \nthe benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal \nPage 44 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

Despite these requirements, Defendants violate \nSection 504 in multiple ways.   \n201.  A “program or activity” means “all of the operations of a department, \nagency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or of a local government, or \nthe entity of such State or local government that distributes such assistance and each such \ndepartment or agency (and each other State or local government entity) to which the assistance is \nextended, in the case of assistance to a State or local government.”  29 U.S.C. 794(b)(1)(A), (B). \n202.  Section 504 regulations prohibit discrimination by a recipient of federal \nfunds by denying a qualified person with a disability the opportunity to participate in or benefit \nfrom the aid, benefit, or service.  34 C.F.R. § 104.4(1)(i). \n203.  Section 504 regulations prohibit discrimination by a recipient of federal \nfunds by affording a qualified person with a disability an opportunity to participate in and benefit \nfrom the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others.  34 C.F.R. § \n104.4.(1)(ii). \n204.  Section 504 regulations prohibit discrimination by a recipient of federal \nfunds by affording a qualified person with a disability an opportunity to participate in and benefit \nfrom the aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective as that provided others.  34 C.F.R. § \n104.4.(1)(iii). \n205.  Section 504 regulations prohibit discrimination by a recipient of federal \nfunds by “providing significant assistance to an agency, organization, or person that \ndiscriminates on the basis of [disability] in providing any aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries \nof the recipients’ program or activity.”  34 C.F.R. § 104.4(1)(v). \n206.

Section 504 regulations require that recipients of federal financial \nassistance “shall take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with their . . . beneficiaries \nare available to persons with impaired vision and hearing.”  28 C.F.R. § 41.51(e). \n208.  Plaintiffs are otherwise qualified to participate in the services, programs, \nor activities that are provided to individuals by Defendants.  29 U.S.C. § 794(b).  \n209.  Defendants all receive federal financial assistance. \n210.  Through the acts and omissions described above, Defendants and their \nagents and employees have and continue to violate the Rehabilitation Act and the regulations \npromulgated thereunder by excluding Plaintiffs from participation in, denying Plaintiffs the \nbenefits of, and subjecting Plaintiffs based solely by reason of their disability to, discrimination \nin Defendants’ services and activities in managing and regulating protests in Portland. \n211.  Defendants make no efforts whatsoever to communicate with protesters \nwho are Deaf or hard of hearing, including when they declare unlawful assemblies and riots and \nissue orders to disperse.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each of the allegations in \nParagraphs 1 through 223 of this Complaint as if fully set forth here. \n225.  People with disabilities in Portland, including Plaintiffs, have participated \nas attendees, medics, and journalists in protests against police violence, racism, and against other \nforms of discrimination since the protests began on May 28, 2020.   \n226.  Plaintiffs’ protest-related activities constitute constitutionally protected \nspeech and/or conduct.  The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects Plaintiffs’ right \nto engage in their protest-related activities free of federal government suppression or retaliation.  \nThe First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution protect Plaintiffs’ right to engage \nin their protest-related activities free from state and local government suppression or retaliation. \n227.  As described in this Complaint, Defendants (a) fail to provide reasonable \nmodifications to law enforcement practices at protests to ensure equal access by and equal \ntreatment of Plaintiffs as people with disabilities during protest-related activity.  Defendants, for \nexample, regularly fail to communicate orders to disperse from protest-related activity in a \nmanner that people with disabilities can readily understand, and regularly fail to provide \nsufficient time or means for people with disabilities to comply with orders to disperse from \nprotest-related activity.  Furthermore, Defendants (b) treat Plaintiffs less favorably than others \nbecause they are people with disabilities who dare to engage in protest-related activity and \nrequest reasonable modifications, and (c) routinely use excessive force against people with and \nwithout disabilities, including Plaintiffs, who engage in protest-related activity, thus creating a \nfrightening and dangerous “war zone” environment that presents heightened danger for people \nwith disabilities.     \nPage 49 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

Defendants’ actions would deter a reasonable person of ordinary firmness \nfrom participating in protest-related activity.  Defendants’ actions have in fact deterred \nparticipation in protest-related activity by Plaintiffs and others.  While some people with \ndisabilities continue to regularly engage in protest-related activity, others have stopped going and \nothers have been too fearful to engage at all because of police violence.   \n229.  Defendants’ actions are, at least substantially, in retaliation for Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutionally protected participation in protest-related activity, including for their involvement \nin protests challenging law enforcement violence, discrimination, and other misconduct, and for \ntheir requests for reasonable modifications.      \n230.  Defendants’ actions have chilled Plaintiffs’ exercise of their First and \nFourteenth Amendment rights to engage in protest-related activity. \n231.  Defendants’ actions also violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments \nbecause they suppress constitutionally protected protest-related activity but are not narrowly \ntailored to any compelling government interest.  Defendants do not enhance Plaintiffs’ \ncompliance with dispersal orders or promote public safety when they fail to provide reasonable \nmodifications that would allow Plaintiffs to understand and comply; instead, they only increase \nconfusion and disorder when Plaintiffs are unable to comply.  Defendants’ use of excessive force \nagainst people who are protesting police brutality only fuels public anger, intensifies the need for \nprotests, and makes the public less safe.  And Defendants’ disparate treatment of people with \ndisabilities who engage in protests does not even have a lawful and rational basis.  \n232.  The federal courts have inherent authority to grant injunctive relief to \ndirect compliance of the federal government and individual federal officials with the First \nAmendment.  \n \n \n \nPage 50 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each of the allegations in \nParagraphs 1 through 232 of this Complaint as if fully set forth here.    \n234.  The Local Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of the First and \nFourteenth Amendment violations described in this Complaint.  The policy, practice, and custom \nis so widespread that officials at all levels of the Local Defendant agencies (including the \nindividual Local Defendants) were aware of and deliberately indifferent to the violations, and/or \nratified the violations, and/or actively participated in the violations, and/or ordered others to \nparticipate in the violations.   \n235.  Plaintiffs and others repeatedly provided the Local Defendants direct \nnotice of the First and Fourteenth Amendment violations and the harm they were causing.  \nBecause of this notice, and because of the widespread nature of the violations, and the \nobviousness of the resulting harm, Local Defendant officials at all levels (including the \nindividual Local Defendants) knew or should have known of the need to train and supervise \nthose under their control to prevent the violations, but they repeatedly failed to provide such \ntraining or supervision.     \n236.

Plaintiffs’ claims against the Individual Federal Defendants arise under \nBivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). \n244.  The Individual Federal Defendants, acting under color of federal authority, \nactively participated in the First Amendment violations described in this Complaint, and/or were \naware of and deliberately indifferent to the violations, and/or ratified the violations, actively \nparticipated, and/or ordered others to participate in the violations.     \n245.  The violations are so widespread and the resultant harm so obvious that \nthe Individual Federal Defendants who supervise others, including Defendants Wolfe and \nWashington, knew or should have known of the need to train and supervise those under their \ncontrol to prevent the violations, but they repeatedly failed to provide such training or \nsupervision.     \n246.  Without altering the burden of proof on any claim or defense, Plaintiffs \nallege that the actions of the Individual Federal Defendants were objectively unreasonable in \nlight of clearly established law.   \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n (Violation of Plaintiffs’ Right to Be Free from Unlawful Seizures and Excessive Force \nUnder the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution)  \n247.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each of the allegations in \nParagraphs 1 through 246 of this Complaint as if fully set forth here. \n248.  The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects Plaintiffs’ right \nto be free from unlawful seizures and use of excessive force by the federal government.  The \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution protect Plaintiffs’ right to be free \nfrom unlawful seizures and use of excessive force by state and local governments. \n249.  Defendants have routinely used excessive force and unreasonably seized \npeople with disabilities, including Plaintiffs, at protests.   \nPage 53 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

For example, Defendants have repeatedly subjected Plaintiffs to bull \nrushes, use of batons, tear gas, pepper balls, rubber bullets, and other crowd control munitions \neven though Plaintiffs pose no threat whatsoever, are suspected of no crime or an extremely \nminor offense, and are not resisting lawful orders or fleeing; indeed, many are actively trying to \ncomply.   \n251.  Likewise, Defendants’ use of strobe lights triggers epileptic seizures in \nthose with photosensitive epilepsy but serves no law enforcement purpose other than to disorient \nprotesters and stymie identification of officers.   \n252.  Defendants also subject people with disabilities to unreasonable seizures \nby, for example, traumatically separating people with disabilities from their service animals \nwithout cause, using unnecessarily tight handcuffs, failing to provide needed care while in \ncustody, and other discriminatory practices. \n253.  Defendants specifically target people with disabilities for violence in \nretaliation for exercising their First Amendment right to free speech, including for requesting \nreasonable accommodations.  Defendants’ overwhelming use of force against and refusal to \naccommodate people with disabilities during seizures is unreasonable.   \n254.  The federal courts have inherent authority to grant injunctive relief to \ndirect compliance of the federal government and individual federal officials with the Fourth \nAmendment. \nCount One: 42 U.S.C. § 1983 / Monell \nAgainst Defendants City of Portland, Ted Wheeler, Chuck Lovell,  \nMultnomah County, Michael Reese, and Local Doe Defendants (“Local Defendants”) \n255.

The Local Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of the Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendment violations described in this Complaint.

Plaintiffs and others repeatedly provided the Local Defendants direct \nnotice of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations and the harm they were causing.  \nBecause of this notice, and because of the widespread nature of the violations, and the \nobviousness of the resulting harm, Local Defendant officials at all levels (including the \nindividual Local Defendants) knew or should have known of the need to train and supervise \nthose under their control to prevent the violations, but they repeatedly failed to provide such \ntraining or supervision.     \n258.

Plaintiffs’ claims against the Individual Federal Defendants arise under \nBivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). \n266.  The Individual Federal Defendants, acting under color of federal authority, \nactively participated in the Fourth Amendment violations described in this Complaint, and/or \nwere aware of and deliberately indifferent to the violations, and/or ratified the violations, and/or \nordered others to participate in the violations.     \n267.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each of the allegations in \nParagraphs 1 through 267 of this Complaint as if fully set forth here. \n269.  The U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment, which applies to claims against \nfederal defendants, and the Fourteenth Amendment, which applies to claims against state and \nlocal defendants, both provide for due process of law.  Fundamental due process principles \nrequire that people receive fair notice that certain conduct is forbidden or required so that they \nmay conform their conduct to the law.   \n270.  Defendants systematically deny due process to people with disabilities, \nincluding Plaintiffs and others.  Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of not providing \nsufficient notice to people with disabilities to allow them to disperse or an opportunity to \notherwise comply with lawful police orders before subjecting them to violence and arrest.  For \nexample, Defendants do not give people with mobility-based disabilities adequate time to \ndisperse, and Defendants do not give people who are Deaf or hard of hearing any notice of the \nneed to disperse. \n271.  Defendants’ failure to provide due process is not narrowly tailored to any \ncompelling government interest.  Failing to notify people of the need to disperse, not providing \nsufficient time to do so, and then brutalizing people for their failure to comply only fuels public \nanger, intensifies the need for protests, and makes the public less safe. \n272.  Federal courts have inherent authority to grant injunctive relief to direct \ncompliance of the federal government and individual federal officials with the Fifth Amendment.  \n \nPage 57 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each of the allegations in \nParagraphs 1 through 272 of this Complaint as if fully set forth here.    \n274.  The Local Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of the \nFourteenth Amendment violations described in this Complaint.  The policy, practice, and custom \nis so widespread that officials at all levels of the Local Defendant agencies (including the \nindividual Local Defendants) were aware of and deliberately indifferent to the violations, and/or \nratified the violations, and/or actively participated in the violations, and/or ordered others to \nparticipate in the violations.   \n275.  Plaintiffs and others repeatedly provided the Local Defendants direct \nnotice of the Fourteenth Amendment violations and the harm they were causing.  Because of this \nnotice, and because of the widespread nature of the violations, and the obviousness of the \nresulting harm, Local Defendant officials at all levels (including the individual Local \nDefendants) knew or should have known of the need to train and supervise those under their \ncontrol to prevent the violations, but they repeatedly failed to provide such training or \nsupervision.     \nCount Two: 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \nAgainst Defendant Travis Hampton (for Injunctive Relief Only) and  \nIndividual State Doe Defendants  \n276.

Without altering the burden of proof on any claim or defense, Plaintiffs \nallege that the actions of the Individual Federal Defendants were objectively unreasonable in \nlight of clearly established law.   \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(Violation of Plaintiffs’ Right to Equal Protection  \nUnder the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution) \n286.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each of the allegations in \nParagraphs 1 through 285 of this Complaint as if fully set forth here. \n287.  The U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment, which applies to claims against \nfederal Defendants, and the Fourteenth Amendment, which applies to claims against state and \nlocal government Defendants, guarantee equal protection of the law.  Where policies, practices, \nand customs burden the fundamental rights of particular classes of persons, equal protection \nprinciples require government practices to survive strict scrutiny or cease. \n288.  Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs substantially burden people \nwith disabilities in the exercise of their fundamental rights to freedom of speech, to be free from \nunreasonable seizures and excessive force, and to procedural due process. \n289.  For example, Defendants communicate orders to disperse and declarations \nof unlawful assembly or riot only to people who hear, denying protesters who are Deaf or hard of \nhearing the ability to comply with Defendants’ orders before being subjected to force or arrest.  \nUnlike people who hear, people who are Deaf or hard of hearing are, therefore, not provided the \nnotice required by the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and are subjected to uses \nof force and unreasonable seizures to which people who hear are not subjected. \n290.  Defendants know that people with disabilities are participating in the on-\ngoing protests as members of the community, medics and press.  Defendants know that their \nPage 60 -  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,  \nAND DAMAGES \n4825-1016-161 6.1   MILLER NASATHT OGRNREAYSH AAT MLA W&  DUNN LLP \nTELEPHONE: 503.224.5858 \n3400 U.S. BANCORP TOWER \n111 S.W.

They have been told too many \ntimes by too many people to claim otherwise.  Their response has evinced a callous disregard for \nthe rights of people with disabilities, consistently telling people with disabilities that if they \ncannot handle law enforcement tactics, including violence, then they should not be out protesting \nat all.  This indicates institutional animus towards people with disabilities. \n291.  Moreover, Defendants have specifically targeted people with disabilities \nfor violence in retaliation for their exercising their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, \nincluding exercising the right to free speech by requesting reasonable accommodations, further \ndemonstrating animus against people with disabilities.  \n292.  Defendants’ actions do not survive strict scrutiny because they are not \nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.  Defendants have no interest in \ndiscriminating against people with disabilities, targeting them, and denying them their \nconstitutionally protected rights.   \n293.  Federal courts have inherent authority to grant injunctive relief to direct \ncompliance of the federal government and individual federal officials with the Fifth Amendment.  \n \nCount One: 42 U.S.C. § 1983 / Monell \n \nAgainst Defendants City of Portland, Ted Wheeler, Chuck Lovell,  \nMultnomah County, Michael Reese, and Local Doe Defendants (“Local Defendants”) \n294.

The Local Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of the Equal \nProtection violations described in this Complaint.

Also pending before the Court is \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, which is opposed by all Defendants. The Court \nheld oral argument on the motions on July 13, 2021. The Court allowed all parties to submit \nsimultaneous supplemental briefs on August 13, 2021 and supplemental response briefs on \nAugust 27, 2021. After considering all the materials in the record and arguments of counsel, and \nfor the following reasons, the Court grants Defendants’ motions to dismiss and denies Plaintiff’s \nmotion for a preliminary injunction as moot. \nSTANDARDS \nA.  Rule 12(b)(6)  \nA motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim may be granted only when there is no \ncognizable legal theory to support the claim or when the complaint lacks sufficient factual \nallegations to state a facially plausible claim for relief. Shroyer v. New Cingular Wireless Servs., \nInc., 622 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir. 2010). In evaluating the sufficiency of a complaint’s factual \nallegations, the court must accept as true all well-pleaded material facts alleged in the complaint \nand construe them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Wilson v. Hewlett-\nPackard Co., 668 F.3d 1136, 1140 (9th Cir. 2012); Daniels-Hall v. Nat’l Educ. Ass’n, 629 \nF.3d 992, 998 (9th Cir. 2010). To be entitled to a presumption of truth, allegations in a complaint \n“may not simply recite the elements of a cause of action, but must contain sufficient allegations \nof underlying facts to give fair notice and to enable the opposing party to defend itself \neffectively.” Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011). The court must draw all \nreasonable inferences from the factual allegations in favor of the plaintiff. Newcal Indus. v. Ikon \nOffice Solution, 513 F.3d 1038, 1043 n.2 (9th Cir. 2008). The court need not, however, credit a \nplaintiff’s legal conclusions that are couched as factual allegations. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. 662, 678-79 (2009). \nPAGE 4 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 5 of 34\n \nA complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations to “plausibly suggest an \nentitlement to relief, such that it is not unfair to require the opposing party to be subjected to the \nexpense of discovery and continued litigation.” Starr, 652 F.3d at 1216. “A claim has facial \nplausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citing \nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556 (2007)). “The plausibility standard is not akin to a \nprobability requirement, but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted \nunlawfully.” Mashiri v. Epstein Grinnell & Howell, 845 F.3d 984, 988 (9th Cir. 2017) (quotation \nmarks omitted). \nB.  Rule 12(b)(1)  \nThe U.S. Constitution confers limited authority on the federal courts to hear only active \ncases or controversies brought by persons who demonstrate standing. See Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, \n136 S. Ct. 1540, 1546-47 (2016); Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 89-90 (2013). \nStanding “limits the category of litigants empowered to maintain a lawsuit in federal court to \nseek redress for a legal wrong.” Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1547. A plaintiff’s standing under \nArticle III of the United States Constitution is a component of subject matter jurisdiction \nproperly challenged under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Chandler v. \nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 598 F.3d 1115, 1121 (9th Cir. 2010); see also White v. Lee, 227 \nF.3d 1214, 1242 (9th Cir. 2000) (“Because standing and mootness both pertain to a federal \ncourt’s subject-matter jurisdiction under Article III, they are properly raised in a motion to \ndismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), not Rule 12(b)(6).”). On a motion to \ndismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1), it is the plaintiff’s burden to \nestablish the existence of subject matter jurisdiction. Chandler, 598 F.3d at 1122; see also \nKingman Reef Atoll Invs., LLC v. United States, 541 F.3d 1189, 1197 (9th Cir. 2008). \nPAGE 5 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 6 of 34\n \nA motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be \neither “facial” or “factual.” See Safe Air for Everyone v. Meyer, 373 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir. \n2004). A facial attack on subject matter jurisdiction is based on the assertion that the allegations \ncontained in the complaint are insufficient to invoke federal jurisdiction. Id. “A jurisdictional \nchallenge is factual where ‘the challenger disputes the truth of the allegations that, by \nthemselves, would otherwise invoke federal jurisdiction.’” Pride v. Correa, 719 F.3d 1130, 1133 \nn.6 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Safe Air for Everyone, 373 F.3d at 1039). When a defendant \nfactually challenges the plaintiff’s assertion of jurisdiction, a court does not presume the \ntruthfulness of the plaintiff’s allegations and may consider evidence extrinsic to the complaint. \nSee Terenkian v. Republic of Iraq, 694 F.3d 1122, 1131 (9th Cir. 2012); Safe Air for Everyone, \n373 F.3d at 1039. A factual challenge “can attack the substance of a complaint’s jurisdictional \nallegations despite their formal sufficiency.” Dreier v. United States, 106 F.3d 844, 847 (9th Cir. \n1996) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \nC.  Standing  \nTo have standing, a plaintiff must have a “personal interest . . . at the commencement of \nthe litigation.” Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 \n(2000). The required personal interest must satisfy three elements throughout the litigation: \n(1) an injury in fact, i.e., an invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and \nparticularized, as well as actual or imminent; (2) a causal connection between the injury-in-fact \nand the defendant’s challenged behavior; and (3) likelihood that the injury-in-fact will be \nredressed by a favorable ruling. Id. at 180-81, 189; see also Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1547 \n(reiterating that the “irreducible constitutional minimum” of standing consists of “an injury in \nfact . . . fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and . . . likely to be redressed \nby a favorable judicial decision”). \nPAGE 6 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 7 of 34\n \nAn injury is “particularized” if it “affect[s] the plaintiff in a personal and individual \nway.” Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1548 (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 n.1 \n(1992)). An injury is “concrete” if it is “‘de facto’; that is it must actually exist,” meaning that it \nis “‘real’ and not ‘abstract.’” Id. “‘Concrete’ is not, however, necessarily synonymous with \n‘tangible.’ Although tangible injuries are perhaps easier to recognize, [the Supreme Court has] \nconfirmed in many . . . previous cases that intangible injuries can nevertheless be concrete.” Id. \nat 1549. \nA plaintiff “must show standing with respect to each form of relief sought.” Ellis v. \nCostco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 978 (9th Cir. 2011). To establish Article III standing to \nseek injunctive relief, a plaintiff must “allege either ‘continuing, present adverse effects’” of a \ndefendant’s past illegal conduct, “or ‘a sufficient likelihood that [he] will again be wronged in a \nsimilar way.’” Villa v. Maricopa Cnty., 865 F.3d 1224, 1229 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting O’Shea v. \nLittleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495-96 (1974), and City of L.A. v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111 (1983)). \nAdditionally, standing to seek equitable relief requires “a showing of an inadequate remedy at \nlaw and . . . a serious risk of irreparable harm.” Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U.S. 522, 537 (1984); see \nalso O’Shea, 414 U.S. at 499. \nWhen a plaintiff seeks prospective injunctive relief, threat of repeated future injury may \nsuffice to provide standing. See Nordstrom v. Ryan, 762 F.3d 903, 911 (9th Cir. 2014). As \nexplained by the Ninth Circuit: \nA plaintiff seeking prospective injunctive relief “must demonstrate \n‘that he is realistically threatened by a repetition of [the \nviolation].’” Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 860-61 (9th \nCir. 2001) (alteration in original) (quoting City of L.A. v. Lyons, \n461 U.S. 95, 109 (1983)), abrogated on other grounds by Johnson \nv. California, 543 U.S. 499, 504-05 (2005). A threat of repetition \ncan be shown “at least two ways.” Id. at 861. “First, a plaintiff may \nshow that the defendant had, at the time of the injury, a written \nPAGE 7 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 8 of 34\n \npolicy, and that the injury ‘stems from’ that policy.” Id. “Second, \nthe plaintiff may demonstrate that the harm is part of a ‘pattern of \nofficially sanctioned . . . behavior, violative of the plaintiffs’ \n[federal] rights.’” Id. (alterations in original) (quoting LaDuke v. \nNelson, 762 F.2d 1318, 1324 (9th Cir. 1985)). \nId. (emphasis and alterations in original). The threat of repeated future injury, however, may not \nbe “conjectural or hypothetical.” O’Shea, 414 U.S. at 494 (quotation marks omitted). \nFurther, concerns about separation of powers counsel careful scrutiny of a plaintiff’s \nstanding to seek injunctive relief against government officials. As the Supreme Court cautioned:  \nWhen transported into the Art. III context, [the principle that the \nGovernment has traditionally been granted the widest latitude in \nconducting its own internal affairs], grounded as it is in the idea of \nseparation of powers, counsels against recognizing standing in a \ncase brought, not to enforce specific legal obligations whose \nviolation works a direct harm, but to seek a restructuring of the \napparatus established by the Executive Branch to fulfill its legal \nduties. The Constitution, after all, assigns to the Executive Branch, \nand not to the Judicial Branch, the duty to “take Care that the Laws \nbe faithfully executed.” \nAllen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 761 (1984), abrogated on other grounds by Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. \nStatic Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118 (2014); see also Lyons, 461 U.S. at 112 (“We \ndecline the invitation to slight the preconditions for equitable relief [irreparable injury]; for as we \nhave held, recognition of the need for a proper balance between state and federal authority \ncounsels restraint in the issuance of injunctions against state officers engaged in the \nadministration of the states’ criminal laws in the absence of irreparable injury which is both great \nand immediate.”). \nD.  Preliminary Injunction \nA preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a \nclear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Defense Council, \nInc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008). A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction generally must show \nPAGE 8 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 9 of 34\n \nthat: (1) the plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) the plaintiff is likely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in favor of \nthe plaintiff; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest. Id. at 20 (rejecting the Ninth \nCircuit’s earlier rule that the mere “possibility” of irreparable harm, as opposed to its likelihood, \nwas sufficient, in some circumstances, to justify a preliminary injunction). \nThe Supreme Court’s decision in Winter, however, did not disturb the Ninth Circuit’s \nalternative “serious questions” test. See All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, \n1131-32 (9th Cir. 2011). Under this test, “‘serious questions going to the merits’ and a hardship \nbalance that tips sharply toward the plaintiff can support issuance of an injunction, assuming the \nother two elements of the Winter test are also met.” Id. at 1132. Thus, a preliminary injunction \nmay be granted “if there is a likelihood of irreparable injury to plaintiff; there are serious \nquestions going to the merits; the balance of hardships tips sharply in favor of the plaintiff; and \nthe injunction is in the public interest.” M.R. v. Dreyfus, 697 F.3d 706, 725 (9th Cir. 2012). \nThe already high standard for granting a preliminary injunction is further heightened \nwhen the type of injunction sought is a “mandatory injunction.” Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 \nF.3d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 2015) (noting that the burden is “doubly demanding” for a mandatory \ninjunction). To obtain a mandatory injunction, a plaintiff must “establish that the law and facts \nclearly favor her position, not simply that she is likely to succeed.” Id. (emphasis in original). As \nexplained by the Ninth Circuit: \nA preliminary injunction can take two forms. A prohibitory \ninjunction prohibits a party from taking action and “preserve[s] the \nstatus quo pending a determination of the action on the merits.” \nChalk v. U.S. Dist. Court, 840 F.2d 701, 704 (9th Cir. 1988); see \nalso Heckler v. Lopez, 463 U.S. 1328, 1333 (1983) (a prohibitory \ninjunction “freezes the positions of the parties until the court can \nhear the case on the merits”). A mandatory injunction orders a \nresponsible party to take action. A mandatory injunction goes well \nPAGE 9 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 10 of 34\n \nbeyond simply maintaining the status quo [p]endente lite [and] is \nparticularly disfavored. In general, mandatory injunctions are not \ngranted unless extreme or very serious damage will result and are \nnot issued in doubtful cases or where the injury complained of is \ncapable of compensation in damages.  \n \nThe status quo ante litem referenced in Chalk means the last, \nuncontested status which preceded the pending controversy. \nMarlyn Nutraceuticals, Inc. v. Mucos Pharma GmbH & Co., 571 F.3d 873, 878-79 (9th \nCir. 2009) (quotation marks and citation omitted) (alterations in original). \nDISCUSSION \nThe arguments raised in Defendants’ various motions to dismiss overlap, particularly \nrelating to standing. Although only the Official Federal Defendants raised mootness in the \noriginal briefing, joined by the City Defendants, courts “have an independent obligation to \ndetermine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even in the absence of a challenge from any \nparty.” Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 513-14 (2006). At oral argument the Court \ndiscussed mootness generally, and in supplemental briefing the City Defendants and the County \nDefendants further briefed the issue. The Court, therefore, applies its standing and mootness \nanalyses to Plaintiffs’ claims for equitable relief against all Defendants, even those who did not \nraise similar specific arguments. The Court next analyzes Plaintiffs’ claims for money damages \nand each group of Defendants’ arguments challenging those claims. Finally, the Court addresses \nPlaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. \nA.  Standing and Mootness—Claims for Equitable Relief \nDefendants raise factual challenges to the Court’s jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1). Thus, \nthe Court considers documents and evidence outside of the pleadings. See Robinson v. United \nStates, 586 F.3d 683, 685 (9th Cir. 2009) (stating that in a 12(b)(1) motion “[a] district court may \nhear evidence regarding jurisdiction and resolve factual disputes where necessary” (simplified)); \nPAGE 10 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 11 of 34\n \nFarr v. United States, 990 F.2d 451, 454 (9th Cir. 1993) (stating that “it is proper for the district \ncourt to consider evidence outside of the pleadings for the purpose of deciding a jurisdictional \nissue (emphasis in original)); McCarthy v. United States, 850 F.2d 558, 560 (9th Cir. 1988) \n(“[W]hen considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) the district court is not \nrestricted to the face of the pleadings, but may review any evidence, such as affidavits and \ntestimony, to resolve factual disputes concerning the existence of jurisdiction.”).  \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs did not have standing to bring their claims for equitable \nrelief when they filed the Complaint on November 1, 2020. The City Defendants state that near \ndaily protests occurred in Portland through November 17, 2020. The Federal Defendants explain \nthat the heightened federal presence decreased after November 9, 2020, and generally describe a \ndecrease in protest activity after November 1, 2020, without specifically describing the \ncircumstances as of November 1, 2020. The Court assumes without deciding that Plaintiffs had \nstanding as of November 1, 2020 to bring their claims, and the Court next analyzes mootness. \nSee Arizonans for Off. Eng. v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 66–67, 117 (1997) (describing, despite \n“grave doubts” about standing, how courts may assume that standing exists in order to analyze \nmootness, because both questions “go[] to the Article III jurisdiction of th[e Supreme] Court and \nthe courts below”).4 \nWhether standing and the other requirements for a live case or controversy exists \nthroughout the entirety of a case is considered under the doctrine of mootness. “The requisite \npersonal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue \n \n4 The Court has doubts about Plaintiffs’ standing to request equitable relief with respect \nto several Defendants, particularly the USMS, County Defendants, and Davie. The Court, \nhowever, need not separately analyze standing for each Defendant because of the Court’s \nconclusion regarding mootness. \nPAGE 11 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 12 of 34\n \nthroughout its existence (mootness).” United States Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, \n396 (1980) (quotation marks omitted); see also Vasquez v. Los Angeles Cnty., 487 F.3d 1246, \n1253 (9th Cir. 2007) (noting that mootness is the doctrine under which courts ensure that “a live \ncontroversy [exists] at all stages of the litigation, not simply at the time plaintiff filed the \ncomplaint”). The doctrine of mootness is more complex, however, than simply “standing set in a \ntime frame,” because it has exceptions that do not apply to standing and because there may \ncircumstances in which certain factors are viewed more flexibly in considering mootness than \nthey would be in considering standing. Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 189-192; see also Karuk Tribe of \nCal. v. U.S. Forest Serv., 681 F.3d 1006, 1017 (9th Cir. 2012) (noting that “[t]he Supreme Court \nhas emphasized that the doctrine of mootness is more flexible than other strands of justiciability \ndoctrine” (quotation marks omitted)). \nThe Supreme Court emphasized that one of the purposes of retaining flexibility in the \nmootness doctrine is the “sunk costs to the judicial system” and that “[t]o abandon the case at an \nadvanced stage may prove more wasteful than frugal.” Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 191-92 & n.5. The \nSupreme Court also has repeatedly emphasized the “heavy burden” on a defendant required to \nshow that its voluntary cessation of conduct has mooted a case—it must be “absolutely clear that \nthe allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.” Id. at 189 (quotation \nmarks omitted). \n Neither of these considerations apply in this case. First, there have been no significant \njudicial resources expended by the Court in this case until consideration of the pending motions. \nThe case has been active for less than one year, without any motion or other practice before the \nPAGE 12 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 13 of 34\n \nCourt. Second, Defendants’ mootness arguments are not based on the voluntary cessation \ndoctrine.5 \nAlthough the mootness doctrine has some flexibility, “[a] case is moot when the issues \npresented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.” \nClark v. City of Lakewood, 259 F.3d 996, 1011 (9th Cir. 2001), as amended (Aug. 15, 2001) \n(quotation marks omitted). “The phrase ‘legally cognizable interest’ is often used to describe \nArticle III’s case or controversy requirements when mootness is at issue, while the phrase ‘injury \nin fact’ is often used to discuss these requirements when standing is at issue.” Id. at 1011 n.7. In \nconsidering the injury requirement and mootness when a plaintiff requests future injunctive \nrelief, courts must consider whether the plaintiff’s “future injuries are now too conjectural or \nhypothetical to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement allowing [the plaintiff] to pursue injunctive \nrelief.” Id. at 1012. “A plaintiff may not rely ‘on mere conjecture about possible governmental \nactions’ to demonstrate injury, and must instead present ‘concrete evidence to substantiate their \nfears.’” Index Newspapers LLC v. United States Marshals Serv., 977 F.3d 817, 825 (9th \nCir. 2020) (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 420 (2013). There may be \ncircumstances, however, “in which the prospect that a defendant will engage in (or resume) \nharmful conduct may be too speculative to support standing, but not too speculative to overcome \n \n5 Many of Plaintiffs’ arguments relating to mootness focus on standards relating to the \nvoluntary cessation doctrine and whether the Court can issue an effective remedy. Whether the \nCourt can issue an effective remedy is not the dispositive issue—the issue is whether Plaintiffs \ncan continue to show the requisite injury, a different standing requirement. The voluntary \ncessation doctrine does not apply because the changed circumstances in this case, discussed in \ndetail below, are not simply a voluntary cessation of conduct by Defendants in response to the \nsame circumstances. They primarily are changed circumstances outside the control of \nDefendants, including significantly fewer and more sporadic protests with fewer participants. See \nWise v. City of Portland, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2021 WL 1950016, at *11 (D. Or. May 15, 2021).  \nPAGE 13 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 14 of 34\n \nmootness.” Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 190. Plaintiffs also must continue to show “a serious risk of \nirreparable harm.” Pulliam, 466 U.S. at 537.  \nPlaintiffs cite this Court’s decision in Index Newspapers LLC v. City of Portland, 480 F. \nSupp. 3d 1120 (D. Or. 2020), stating that a case is not moot simply because “the precise relief \nsought at the time the application for an injunction was filed” is no longer available. Id. at 1140. \nPlaintiffs argue that a case is moot “only when it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual \nrelief whatever to the prevailing party.” Knox v. Serv. Emps. Int’l Union, Loc., 1000, 567 \nU.S. 298, 307 (2012) (quotation marks omitted). The mootness issues discussed in those cases, \nhowever, did not relate to whether the Plaintiffs could still demonstrate the requisite injury after \nchanged circumstances. Rather, the issues addressed in those cases involved whether a court \ncould still provide a remedy to the claimed injury or whether the defendants’ voluntary cessation \nof conduct mooted claims. \nThe Federal Defendants describe the significant change in protest activity in Portland \nfrom last summer to the present as it relates to federal buildings. The protests have largely \nmoved from the downtown federal courthouse to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n(ICE) building two miles away, and focus more on “anti-government sentiment” than social \njustice. See Index Newspapers LLC v. City of Portland, Case No. 3:20-cv-1035-SI, ECF 205 \nat 3.6 The protests generally involve fewer than 200 people and some involve less than a dozen. \nId. From November 1, 2020 to August 13, 2021 (more than 9 months), there were 23 protests \n \n6 As previously discussed with the parties, Court takes judicial notice of the declarations \nfiled in the Index Newspapers case describing the state of the protests in Portland and the Federal \nresponse to the protests. References to ECF numbers in the Index Newspapers case will have a \npreceding case number or “Id.” References to ECF numbers without a preceding case number are \nto the case docket in the pending action. Page number citations are to ECF pagination, not the \ninternal pagination of the documents. \nPAGE 14 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 15 of 34\n \ninvolving federal property that were declared unlawful assemblies. Id. (describing protests \nthrough June 11, 2021); see also ECF 127 at 2 (describing protests from June 11, 2021 through \nAugust 13, 2021). Those protests resulted in the arrest of approximately 35 individuals for \nmisdemeanor offenses and about 35 federal law enforcement officers sustaining injuries. \nBecause there have been no protests that were declared unlawful assemblies by Federal \nProtective Services (FPS) from June 11 to August 13, 2021,7 the more recent protests involving \nunlawful behavior at federal buildings include a protest by seven persons on the evening of \nJune 1, which dwindled to three persons by the early morning of June 2 and a protest by 12 \npersons on May 29. By comparison, from May 26, 2020 through October 31, 2020 (slightly more \nthan five months), there were protests that were declared unlawful assemblies daily, which \nresulted in the arrest of more than 1,000 people and the injury of 219 federal law enforcement \nofficers. Index Newspapers, Case No. 3:20-cv-1035-SI, ECF 205 at 3. These protests also \ninvolved much larger crowd sizes.  \nThe federal government’s changed deployment in Portland also relates to the reduction in \nthe protests. On May 2, 2021, FPS terminated Operation Diligent Valor, the augmented response \nin Portland. Id. at 3-4. As of June 11, 2021, FPS had less than 12 officers from outside \nRegion 108 deployed in Portland, and FPS was no longer being augmented by other law \nenforcement agencies. Id. at 4. By August 13, 2021, “the FPS presence in Portland ha[d] mostly \nreturned to [a] steady state, with only those officers normally assigned to Portland.” ECF 127 \nat 2. \n \n7 See ECF 127, ¶ 4 (Declaration of Patrick J. Zitny). \n8 Region 10 of FPS includes the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Alaska. \nPAGE 15 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 16 of 34\n \nAs of November 9, 2020, the USMS in Portland was no longer being augmented by \nadditional staff. Additionally, the USMS officially shut down operations related to protest \nactivity on November 15, 2020, and is no longer responding to protests. ECF 60 at 2. Even when \nthe federal courthouse had a renewed attack against it on March 11, 2021 after its protective \nfencing was temporarily removed, the USMS did not respond. Id. at 3. Instead, only FPS and \nPortland Police Bureau (PPB) responded. The last time the USMS exited the federal courthouse \nto respond to a protest was July 30, 2020, more than a year ago. Index Newspapers, Case \nNo. 3:20-cv-1035-SI, ECF 204 at 2. \nOther federal law enforcement agencies that were once augmenting the federal forces in \nPortland are no longer deployed in the City. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection, U.S. Border Patrol Special Operations Group has not been \ndeployed in Portland since January 24, 2021. Id., ECF 206 at 2. DHS ICE Enforcement and \nRemoval Operations Special Response Team members have not been deployed in Portland since \nMarch 21, 2021. Id., ECF 207 at 6. DHS ICE Homeland Security Investigations Special \nResponse Team members have not been deployed in Portland since about March 30, 2021. Id., \nECF 208 at 4.  \nFurther, the federal government’s approach to protests has changed at the highest levels \nfrom summer 2020. Then-President Donald Trump had issued Executive Order 13,933 \n(“Protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues and Combating Recent Criminal \nViolence”), which focused on enforcing laws prohibiting the “desecration of public monuments” \nand “the vandalism of government property.” Exec. Order No. 13933, 85 Fed. Reg. 40,081, \n40,083 (June 26, 2020). That Executive Order directed the United States “to prosecute to the \nfullest extent permitted under Federal law, and as appropriate,” persons who destroy or vandalize \nPAGE 16 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 17 of 34\n \nmonuments, memorials, statues, or religious property, and “to withhold Federal support” from \nState and local governments and law enforcement agencies “that have failed to protect public \nmonuments, memorials, and statues from destruction or vandalism” Id. It also contained a \nprovision allowing DHS to provide additional “personnel to assist with the protection of Federal \nmonuments, memorials, statues, or property.” Id. This latter provision expired by its own terms \non December 26, 2020. President Biden revoked the Executive Order in its entirety on May 14, \n2021.9 Additionally, former Acting Secretary Chad Wolf, who Plaintiffs allege made public \ncomments that “justified the actions of DHS agents” in Portland, has been replaced by Secretary \nMayorkas. Plaintiffs allege no similar comments by Secretary Mayorkas. \nSimilarly, the situation in Portland has changed with respect to protests involving state \nproperty and the state and local law enforcement response. The more recent protest activity \ninvolves “drastically reduced numbers of participants.” ECF 110 at 2. There have been more \nthan 100 protests in Portland since January 1, 2021 that have resulted in no response by the PPB. \nSee id.; ECF 129 at 2. From April through early August 2021, PPB responded to protests on 27 \ndays, and declared a riot or unlawful assembly only nine times. ECF 110 at 2; ECF 129 at 2. Of \nthose nine times, PPB deployed less lethal munitions during three events, deployed pepper spray \nduring five events, and deployed Saf-Smoke during one event. ECF 110 at 2; ECF 129 at 2. \nCraig Dobson, a Commander in the PPB, describes many protests, even those with some \n \n9 The Court takes judicial notice of President Biden’s “Executive Order on the \nRevocation of Certain Presidential Actions and Technical Amendment” pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 201(c)(1). See White House Briefing Room, Executive Order on the Revocation of Certain \nPresidential Actions and Technical Amendment (May 14, 2021), https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \nbriefing-room/presidentialactions/2021/05/14/executive-order-on-the-revocation-of-certain-\npresidential-actions-andtechnical-amendment/. \nPAGE 17 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 18 of 34\n \ncriminal activity and that included a few arrests, in which PPB did not use any munitions or \nforce. ECF 110 at 2-8; ECF 129 at 3.  \nThe OSP Mobile Response Team (MRT) has deployed in Portland only a handful of \ntimes from November 2, 2020 through August 27, 2021. ECF 137 at 2. None of these \ndeployments involved the use of chemical agents or projectiles and for only one deployment did \nany officer report a use of force. The MRT deployed in Portland from November 2, 2020 through \nNovember 6, 2020, to support local law enforcement during the presidential election. Officers \nreported uses of force on November 4, 2020. The MRT also deployed on April 17, 2021 and \nApril 20-21, 2021. \nUnder the specific facts of this case, considering the significantly reduced number of \nprotests, protest crowd size, police response to protests, and deployment of less lethal munitions \nand aerosol restraints, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ alleged future injury is now too speculative \nand conjectural to provide Plaintiffs with the legally cognizable interest necessary to support \nongoing claims for future injunctive relief. Clark, 259 F.3d at 1012; see also Index \nNewspapers, 977 F.3d at 825 (noting that for future injunctive relief, the injury must be \n“certainly impending, or there is a substantial risk the harm will occur” (quoting In re \nZappos.com, Inc., 888 F.3d 1020, 1024 (9th Cir. 2018)). The current situation in Portland is that \nthere are intermittent protests of reduced size. In some circumstances these protests are declared \nan unlawful assembly, and in only some of those instances might a law enforcement response \nresult in the alleged injury-producing police conduct. Almost no such conduct, however, \noccurred in June, July, or August, 2021. By contrast, the Complaint involved protests that were \nalmost daily declared unlawful assemblies with a law enforcement response that included \nallegedly injury-producing conduct.  \nPAGE 18 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 19 of 34\n \nPlaintiffs’ supplemental declarations do not support a different finding. Plaintiff Philip \nWolfe describes one protest in April 2021 (April 11), when he left early because there was a \nlarge police presence and he feared for his safety. He states that he attended “several marches \nand rallies in March and in April [2021] where there was limited or no police involvement.” \nECF 94 at 5. Plaintiff Wolfe no longer attends protests or rallies with a law enforcement \npresence because he does not feel safe. He explains that he would like to attend such protests and \nwould do so if law enforcement provided accommodations for deaf or hard of hearing protesters. \nPlaintiff Juniper Simonis describes two protests in April 2021 (16th and 17th) and two protests in \nMay 2021 (1st and 28th) in which they experienced use of force by law enforcement. Plaintiff \nSimonis also describes one night in June 2021 (24th) in which they viewed force by law \nenforcement on video. Plaintiff Melissa Lewis describes three protests in April 2021 (April 12th, \n20th, and 26th) where law enforcement used force, a protest on May 1st where she witnessed law \nenforcement with “cars screeching” and “weapons drawn,” and no other protests for the \nremainder of May, June, July, or August this year. She also explains that she has “noticed that \nlaw enforcement has decreased its use of less lethal chemical munitions.” ECF 124 at 5. Plaintiff \nKatalina Durden explains that she has not participated in protests since the summer of 2020 \nbecause she does not feel safe, although she would like to participate in protests if law \nenforcement would be more accommodating to blind persons. These declarations do not describe \nlaw enforcement activity in May, June, July, or August this year that shows a realistic threat of \nrepeated injury. \nPlaintiffs also request that the Court take judicial notice of the declarations filed by the \nplaintiffs in Index Newspapers describing the more recent protest conditions and law \nenforcement response in Portland, because the Court is taking judicial notice of the Federal \nPAGE 19 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 20 of 34\n \nDefendants’ declarations in that case. Those declarations, however, do not paint a materially \ndifferent picture than Plaintiffs’ own declarations. Kat Mahoney describes no protests or law \nenforcement conduct after March 2021. Index Newspapers, Case No. 3:20-cv-1035-SI, ECF 221. \nJohn Rudoff describes a protest and law enforcement response on May 1, 2021, just as some \nPlaintiffs here describe. Id., ECF 222. Caitlin Wong describes no protests after January 27, 2021. \nId., ECF 223. Justin Yau describes protests and law enforcement response on March 11th into \nMarch 12th and April 13th into April 14th. Id., ECF 224. None of the Index Newspapers \nplaintiffs describe any protest or law enforcement activity after May 1, 2021. \nPlaintiffs’ supplemental declarations are consistent with the information in Defendants’ \nsupplemental declarations—that recent protests triggering a law enforcement response involving \nforce are sporadic and nearly nonexistent after May 2021. Plaintiffs desire to attend any social \njustice protests that might occur in Portland in the future. For their alleged injury to occur, \nhowever, requires “attempting to anticipate whether and when these” Plaintiffs might attend a \nsocial justice protest that is then declared an unlawful assembly. See O’Shea, 414 U.S. at 497. \nThen if such a protest is declared an unlawful assembly, it must result in a law enforcement \nresponse that includes the alleged excessive force, failure to accommodate, or other misconduct. \nFinally, the Plaintiffs must be harmed by that alleged misconduct. All of these steps must occur \ndespite the currently reduced crowd size and protest circumstances in Portland. This “takes us \ninto the area of speculation and conjecture.” Id. For Plaintiffs’ alleged injury to occur requires \ntoo speculative of a chain of possibilities. See Clapper, 568 U.S. at 410. \nThe circumstances now are not the same as “the time the preliminary injunction [in Index \nNewspapers] was entered, [when this] court found that the Federal Defendants had engaged in a \npattern of conduct that had persisted for weeks and was ongoing.” Index Newspapers, 977 F.3d \nPAGE 20 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 21 of 34\n \nat 826. Neither federal nor state law enforcement officers have been responding to protests \nnightly for weeks. Plaintiffs fail to provide “concrete evidence to substantiate their fear” of \nfuture injury by Defendants. Id. at 825 (quoting Clapper, 568 U.S. at 420). Although Plaintiffs \ndo not have to “await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventative relief,” they \nmust plausibly show “that based on their course of conduct, there is a ‘realistic danger’ or \n‘credible threat’” that “a probabilistic harm will materialize.” Doe #1 v. Trump, 335 F.R.D. 416, \n429-30 (D. Or. 2020) (quoting Valle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 732 F.3d 1006, 1015 (9th Cir. 2013) \nand Nat. Res. Def. Council v. EPA, 735 F.3d 873, 878 (9th Cir. 2013)). Under the changed \ncircumstances, Plaintiffs are unable to do so.10 \nNor does the fact that the individual Plaintiffs allege that their First Amendment rights \nhave been chilled suffice to allege injury to avoid mootness. “A chilling of First Amendment \nrights can constitute a cognizable injury, so long as the chilling effect is not ‘based on a fear of \nfuture injury that itself [is] too speculative to confer standing.’” Index Newspapers, 977 F.3d at \n826 (quoting Munns v. Kerry, 782 F.3d 402, 410 (9th Cir. 2015)). As discussed above, Plaintiffs’ \nfear of future injury is too speculative. Clapper, 568 U.S. at 416 (“[Plaintiffs] cannot \nmanufacture standing merely by inflicting harm on themselves based on their fears of \nhypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending.”). \n \n10 Plaintiff DRO argues that it has direct organizational standing. “[A]n organization has \ndirect standing to sue when it show[s] a drain on its resources from both a diversion of its \nresources and frustration of its mission.” Fair Hous. Council of San Fernando Valley v. \nRoommate.com, LLC, 666 F.3d 1216, 1219 (9th Cir. 2012) (simplified). Plaintiffs contend that \nDRO has standing because “DRO has been contacted by several people with disabilities who \nhave been harmed by law enforcement while peacefully protesting” and thus “DRO has devoted \nand must continue to devote considerable resources to investigating and advocating to resolve \nthis critical problem.” ECF 119 at 9. DRO’s direct organization standing, therefore, is tied to the \nsame underlying conduct—protesters being harmed by law enforcement’s excessive force in \nresponding to protests—that the Court has found is too speculative to support standing based on \nthe changed circumstances. \nPAGE 21 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 22 of 34\n \nFurther, there is also a change in Oregon law. Oregon Governor Kate Brown signed into \nlaw HB 2928, which defines the circumstances under which law enforcement may use less lethal \nmunitions and chemical agents on a crowd. ECF 131 at 3-5. It requires law enforcement agencies \nto “provide announcements for purposes of crowd control both audibly and visually” whenever \npossible. Id. at 4. It also requires law enforcement agencies to “take reasonable action to \naccommodate disabilities when issuing or enforcing orders to disperse” when using less lethal \nmunitions, chemical agents, or sound devices. Id. Thus, much of the remedy Plaintiffs seek in \nthis case has now been enacted into law in Oregon. \nFor all of these reasons, Plaintiffs fail to show that they have certainly impending injury \nfor purposes of requesting future injunctive and declaratory relief. Accordingly, Plaintiffs claims \nfor equitable relief are dismissed. \nB.  Claims for Money Damages11 \n1.  Defendant Wolf \na.  Bivens \nWolf contends that Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims are not cognizable under Bivens v. Six \nUnknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). Wolf argues that a \nBivens remedy is not available to Plaintiffs because separation of powers principles caution \nagainst extending a Bivens remedy to this new context, particularly considering the numerous \nspecial factors that weigh against extending the remedy. Wolf further asserts that even if the \nCourt were to find that Wolf could be held liable under Bivens, the Court should dismiss \nPlaintiffs’ claims against Wolf because he is entitled to qualified immunity.  \n \n11 Plaintiffs seek money damages only against Defendant Wolf, the County Defendants, \nand the City Defendants.  \nPAGE 22 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 23 of 34\n \nThe Supreme Court “has made clear that expanding the Bivens remedy is now a \n‘disfavored’ judicial activity.” Ziglar v. Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1857 (2017). Extending Bivens  \n“is a significant step under separation-of-powers principles,” and Congress is the branch of \ngovernment with the “substantial responsibility to determine whether, and the extent to which, \nmonetary and other liabilities should be imposed upon individual officers and employees of the \nFederal Government.” Id. at 1856. The Supreme Court “has ‘consistently refused to extend \nBivens [liability] to any new context or new category of defendants.’ . . . for the past 30 years.” \nId. at 1857 (quoting Corr. Svcs. Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 68 (2001) (alteration text in \nMalesko, omitted in Abbasi)). “The [Supreme] Court’s precedents now make clear that a Bivens \nremedy will not be available if there are ‘special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of \naffirmative action by Congress.’” Id. (quoting Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 18 (1980)). Thus, \nin considering possible extensions of Bivens, courts “engage in a two-step inquiry.” Hernandez v. \nMesa, 140 S. Ct. 735, 743 (2020). The first step is to “inquire whether the request involves a \nclaim that arises in a ‘new context’ or involves a ‘new category of defendants.’” Id. (quoting \nMalesko, 534 U.S. at 68). If so, the second step is to “ask whether there are any special factors \nthat counsel hesitation about granting the extension.” Id. (simplified).  \nDefendant Wolf argues that Plaintiffs’ claims seek to extend Bivens to both a new context \nand new category of defendants. What constitutes a new context for purposes of Bivens is \n“broad.” Id. A context is “‘new’ if it is ‘different in a meaningful way from previous Bivens \ncases decided by [the Supreme] Court.’” Id. (quoting Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1859).  \nThe Court agrees with Wolf that Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims against Wolf present a \nnew Bivens context. Plaintiffs do not allege that Wolf personally engaged in excessive force or \notherwise violated Plaintiffs rights. Plaintiffs instead allege that Wolf essentially implemented a \nPAGE 23 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 24 of 34\n \nfederal policy and knew about and made comments in support of the conduct of line-level \nofficers. These allegations are dissimilar from the types of direct and supervisory conduct \naccepted in Bivens and its progeny. Instead, they are analogous to the allegations rejected by the \nSupreme Court in Abbasi, a case in which the plaintiffs sued high-level executive branch \nemployees. In that case, the Supreme Court declined to extend Bivens in part because “a Bivens \naction is not ‘a proper vehicle for altering an entity’s policy.’” Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1860 \n(quoting Malesko, 534 U.S. at 74).   \nBecause Plaintiffs’ claims arise in a new context, the Court considers whether any special \nfactors counsel hesitation. The Court finds persuasive the special factors described in Wolf’s \nmotion. ECF 54 at 26-40. These factors include: (1) Plaintiffs are challenging a high-level \nexecutive policy, raising separation of powers concerns; (2) this lawsuit invites intrusive \ndiscovery to high-ranking and formerly high-ranking government officials; and (3) Plaintiffs \nhave many alternatives to a Bivens claim to remedy their alleged harm. Accordingly, the Court \ndeclines to extend Bivens to this context. See Clark v. Wolf, 2021 WL 2386115, at *5 (D. Or. \nJune 10, 2021) (declining to extend Bivens to Wolf’s conduct in responding to the 2020 Portland \nprotests). The Court grants Wolf’s motion to dismiss on this ground. The Court thus declines to \nreach Wolf’s argument on qualified immunity. \nb.  Section 1983 \nPlaintiffs allege in a conclusory fashion that Wolf is liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Wolf \nmoved against this claim in his motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs did not respond to this argument in \ntheir response brief.12 A plaintiff who “makes a claim” in a complaint “but fails to raise the issue \n \n12 Plaintiffs’ response brief suffers from the same problem as Plaintiffs’ Complaint—\nlumping all Defendants together. For example, in discussing their § 1983 claims, Plaintiffs list all \nthe individual defendants and then state: “Plaintiffs’ complaint sufficiently alleges that \nDefendants’ policies, practices or customs of [sic] plausibly violate Plaintiffs’ constitutional \nPAGE 24 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 25 of 34\n \nin response to a defendant’s motion to dismiss” that claim, “has effectively abandoned [that] \nclaim.” Walsh v. Nevada Dep’t of Hum. Res., 471 F.3d 1033, 1037 (9th Cir. 2006); see also \nMaldonado v. City of Ripon, 2021 WL 2682163, at *8 (E.D. Cal. June 30, 2021) (“Plaintiff does \nnot address Defendants’ arguments regarding punitive damages in his opposition to the motion to \ndismiss and therefore concedes the arguments.”); Kerrigan v. Allstate Ins. Co., --- F. Supp.  \n3d ---, 2021 WL 2389644, at *1 (C.D. Cal. June 10, 2021) (“Plaintiff also did not oppose and, \nthus, concedes, Defendants’ argument that because Allstate Insurance was not a party to the \ninsurance policy at issue in this action it was improperly named and should be dismissed.”). \nAccordingly, the Court grants this portion of Wolf’s motion. \n \nrights under [the] U.S. Constitution, therefore, dismissal is not appropriate.” ECF 97 at 31. \nWhether a federal official is liable as a state actor under § 1983, however, involves a specific \nanalysis that Plaintiffs do not address. Nor do Plaintiffs address the County Defendants’ \narguments about whether Plaintiffs alleged specific facts relating to the County Defendants, as \nopposed to just alleging that “Defendants” engaged in conduct. Although Plaintiffs allege that \n“[e]ach Defendant has coordinated its responses to the protests with other agencies,” ECF 1 at \n40, to the extent Plaintiffs intend to allege that Defendants are agents of one another or engaged \nin a joint venture, the Court does not accept this legal conclusion. Allegations are factually \ndeficient when a “complaint lumps defendants together and fails to adequately distinguish claims \nand alleged wrongs among defendants. . . . Plaintiffs must allege more than generic and \nconclusory allegations demonstrating that ‘Defendants’ collectively engaged in [misconduct] and \nallege with at least some degree of specificity the acts which each defendant is alleged to have \nengaged in which support Plaintiff’s claims.” McKeon v. Cent. Valley Cmty. Sports Found., 2018 \nWL 6436256, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 7, 2018) (citing cases); see also Karkanen v. \nCalifornia, 2018 WL 3820916 at * 7 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 10, 2018) (dismissing complaint where \n“plaintiff repeatedly lumps defendants together in her allegations,” because “a complaint which \nlumps together multiple defendants in one broad allegation fails to satisfy the notice requirement \nof Rule 8(a)(2)” (simplified) (citing cases)); In re Nexus 6P Prod. Liab. Litig., 293 F. Supp. 3d \n888, 908 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (“Plaintiffs must identify what action each Defendant took that caused \nPlaintiffs’ harm, without resort to generalized allegations against Defendants as a whole.” \n(quotation marks and citation omitted)); Sheffield v. Orius Corp., 211 F.R.D. 411, 415 (D. \nOr. 2002) (“Broad allegations against numerous defendants are not specific enough to provide \nthe defendants with notice of the plaintiffs’ allegations.”); accord Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 676 (stating \nthat the plaintiffs “must plead that each Government-official defendant, through [the official’s] \nown individual actions, has violated the Constitution”). \nPAGE 25 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 26 of 34\n \n2.  The City Defendants \nPlaintiffs currently are suing the City, along with Mayor Wheeler and Police Chief Lovell \nonly in their official capacities.13 The City Defendants move to dismiss Mayor Wheeler and \nChief Lovell as redundant defendants, because the City also is named as a defendant. See Ctr. for \nBio-Ethical Reform, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cnty. Sheriff Dep’t, 533 F.3d 780, 799 (9th Cir. 2008) \n(“An official capacity suit against a municipal officer is equivalent to a suit against the entity. \nWhen both a municipal officer and a local government entity are named, and the officer is named \nonly in an official capacity, the court may dismiss the officer as a redundant defendant. (citation \nomitted)); Updike v. Clackamas Cnty., 2015 WL 7722410, at *4 (D. Or. Nov. 30, 2015) \n(“Updike’s claims against Sheriff Roberts in his official capacity, and through him against the \nClackamas County Sheriff’s Office, are redundant with Updike’s claims against Clackamas \nCounty. The Court dismisses Updike’s claims against Sheriff Roberts. (footnote omitted)). \nPlaintiffs did not respond to this argument in their response brief, and at oral argument conceded \nthese claims. Accordingly, the Court dismisses the claims against Mayor Wheeler and Chief \nLovell as redundant.  \nThe City Defendants also move to dismiss the claims for money damages against the City \non various grounds. Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs fail to allege Monell14 liability, the \nCourt does not reach the City’s remaining arguments. The City argues that “Plaintiffs cannot \nshow that the City’s alleged excessive force was the product of a custom or policy of the City \nand was the moving force behind [Plaintiffs’] alleged injury.” ECF 77 at 23.  \n \n13 Plaintiffs have not named and served any individual police officer, despite identifying \nsome of the alleged officers by badge number. \n14 The Supreme Court established the test for municipal liability in Monell v. Department \nof Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978). \nPAGE 26 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 27 of 34\n \na.  Standards under Monell \nA municipality “may not be sued under § 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its \nemployees or agents.” Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978). “Instead, a \nmunicipality is subject to suit under § 1983 only ‘if it is alleged to have caused a constitutional \ntort through a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and \npromulgated by that body’s officers.’” Gravelet-Blondin v. Shelton, 728 F.3d 1086, 1096-97 (9th \nCir. 2013) (quoting City of St. Louis v. Parprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 121 (1988)). Municipal \nliability may exist without any formal policy permitting the challenged conduct where the \nmunicipality has a “longstanding practice or custom which constitutes the standard operating \nprocedure of the local government entity.” Trevino v. Gates, 99 F.3d 911, 918 (9th Cir. 1996) \n(quoting Gillette v. Delmore, 979 F.3d 1342, 1346 (9th Cir. 1992); see also Gordon v. Cnty. of \nOrange, 6 F.4th 961, 973 (9th Cir. 2021) (noting that a plaintiff can show a policy or practice \nthrough “a longstanding practice or custom” in addition to “an expressly adopted official \npolicy”). \nIn narrow circumstances, a municipality’s failure to train its employees may be \nconsidered a policy or custom. City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 389 (1989) (“Only where \na municipality’s failure to train its employees in a relevant respect evidences a deliberate \nindifference to the rights of its inhabitants can such a shortcoming be properly thought of as a \ncity policy or custom that is actionable under § 1983.”). Indeed, “a pattern of similar \nconstitutional violations by untrained employees is ordinarily necessary to demonstrate \ndeliberate indifference.” Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51, 62 (2011) (simplified). In still rarer \ninstances, however, the duties of a specific employee make the need for certain training obvious. \nCity of Canton, 489 U.S. at 390. The classic example being that the duties of police officers to \nPAGE 27 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 28 of 34\n \nchase fleeing felons makes the need for training on constitutional use of force by officers \nobvious. Id. at 390 n.10. \nFinally, a municipality may be liable “when the individual who committed the \nconstitutional tort was an official with final policy-making authority or such an official ratified a \nsubordinate’s unconstitutional decision or action and the basis for it.” Gordon, 6 F.4th at 974 \n(quotation marks omitted). To prevail on a ratification theory, a plaintiff must show both that \nwrongdoer’s decision was “cast in the form of a policy statement” and that a supervisor with \npolicy making authority expressly approved of the decision. Gillette, 979 F.3d at 1348. \n“A defendant may be held liable as a supervisor under § 1983 ‘if there exists either \n(1) his or her personal involvement in the constitutional deprivation, or (2) a sufficient causal \nconnection between the supervisor’s wrongful conduct and the constitutional violation.’” \nStarr, 652 F.3d at 1207 (quoting Hansen v. Black, 885 F.2d 642, 646 (9th Cir. 1989)). The \nrequisite showing can be established by demonstrating that the supervisor: (1) set in motion a \nseries of acts by others or knowingly refused to terminate a series of acts by others, which the \nsupervisor knew or reasonably should have known would cause others to inflict constitutional \ninjury; (2) had his or her own culpable action or inaction in the training, supervision, or control \nof his or her subordinates; (3) acquiesced in the constitutional deprivation by subordinates; or \n(4) engaged in conduct that shows reckless or callous indifference to the rights of others. Id. \nat 1207-08. “A plaintiff must allege facts, not simply conclusions, that show that an individual \nwas personally involved in the deprivation of [the plaintiff’s] civil rights.” Barren v. \nHarrington, 152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir. 1998). A supervisor might be liable despite not \npersonally participating in the alleged deprivation if the supervisor “implement[ed] a policy so \nPAGE 28 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 29 of 34\n \ndeficient that the policy itself is a repudiation of constitutional rights and is the moving force of a \nconstitutional violation.” Crowley v. Bannister, 734 F.3d 967, 977 (9th Cir. 2013) (simplified). \nb.  Analysis \nPlaintiffs allege in a conclusory manner that the City has a policy, practice, and custom of \nviolating the constitutional rights of persons as described in the Complaint. Plaintiffs argue that \nbecause they allege several specific instances of alleged violations, that is sufficient to allege a \npolicy, custom, and practice.  \nBecause Plaintiffs allege that the City has an official policy that violates their rights, the \nCourt considers the City’s official policies, provided by the City, regarding use of force and \nresponding to protests as submitted by the City. See Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc., 899 \nF.3d 988, 1002 (9th Cir. 2018) (discussing that documents that are not mentioned in a complaint \nmay be incorporated by reference “when assessing the sufficiency of a claim requires that the \ndocument at issue be reviewed”). These policies do not support Plaintiffs’ assertion that the City \nhas an official policy to violate Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.  \nRegarding custom or practice, the facts alleged by Plaintiffs, even taking all well-pleaded \nfactual allegations as true, do not show that in responding to protests the City has a practice or \ncustom of violating the constitutional rights of persons with disabilities. Plaintiffs argue that in \nthis Circuit, a claim of municipal liability under § 1983 is sufficient to withstand a motion to \ndismiss “even if the claim is based on nothing more than a bare allegation that the individual \nofficers’ conduct conformed to official policy, custom, or practice.” Shah v. County of Los \nAngeles, 797 F.2d 743, 747 (9th Cir. 1986). Shah, however, was issued before the Supreme \nCourt’s decisions in Iqbal and Twombly. In Starr, the Ninth Circuit clarified post-Iqbal that a \ncomplaint “may not simply recite the elements of a cause of action” and must contain sufficient \nfactual allegations to “plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.” Starr, 652 F.3d at 1216. Starr \nPAGE 29 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 30 of 34\n \nexplained that supervisor liability requires factual allegations plausibly showing the supervisor’s \n“own culpable action or inaction in the training, supervision, or control of his subordinates, his \nacquiescence in the constitutional deprivations of which the complaint is made, or conduct that \nshowed a reckless or callous indifference to the rights of others.” Id. at 1205-06 (quotation marks \nomitted). Plaintiffs do not allege facts showing such conduct by any City decisionmaker. \nPlaintiffs asserted at oral argument that the absence of a policy to accommodate persons \nwith disabilities in responding to protests or in the City’s use of force policy is sufficient to show \na policy, custom, or practice under Monell. The Court requested supplemental briefing on this \nargument, but Plaintiffs did not provide any briefing in support of their argument. The City, \nhowever, responded that Monell liability cannot be premised on an omission. That is a \nmisunderstanding of the circumstances under which liability may attach to a local government \nunder Monell. \nThe Ninth Circuit has explained that a municipality may be liable for policies that are \n“through omission” and result in liability for a constitutional violation “even though the \nmunicipality’s policies were facially constitutional, the municipality did not direct the employee \nto take the unconstitutional action, and the municipality did not have the state of mind required \nto prove the underlying violation.” Tsao v. Desert Palace, Inc., 698 F.3d 1128, 1143 (9th \nCir. 2012) (quoting Gibson v. Cnty of Washoe, 290 F.3d 1175, 1185-86 (9th Cir. 2002)). \nA policy of inaction or omission may be based on failure to \nimplement procedural safeguards to prevent constitutional \nviolations. Oviatt v. Pearce, 954 F.2d 1470, 1477 (9th Cir. 1992). \nTo establish that there is a policy based on a failure to preserve \nconstitutional rights, a plaintiff must show, in addition to a \nconstitutional violation, “that this policy ‘amounts to deliberate \nindifference’ to the plaintiff’s constitutional right[,]” Id. at 1474 \n(quoting Canton, 489 U.S. at 389, 109 S. Ct. 1197), and that the \npolicy caused the violation, “in the sense that the [municipality] \nPAGE 30 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 31 of 34\n \ncould have prevented the violation with an appropriate policy.” \nGibson, 290 F.3d at 1194. \nThe Supreme Court has explained that these heightened \nrequirements for establishing responsibility for a policy of \nomission are necessary to avoid imposing respondeat superior \nliability, which would run afoul of Monell. See Bd. of Cnty. \nComm’rs v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 403-04, 117 S. Ct. 1382 (1997). \nAfter all, when a municipal employee commits a constitutional \ntort, it could always be alleged that the municipality failed to enact \na policy that would have prevented the tort. Without the rigorous \nstate of mind requirements set out in Canton and subsequent cases, \nthere would be nothing left of Monell ‘s rule against respondeat \nsuperior liability. See Connick v. Thompson, --- U.S. ---, 131 S. Ct. \n1350, 1359-60 (2011); Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs, 520 U.S. at 406-07, \n117 S. Ct. 1382. Canton’s standards thus ensure that, even if the \nalleged defect in the municipality’s policy is one of omission, the \nacts of constitutional tortfeasors can still “fairly be said to be those \nof the municipality.” Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs, 520 U.S. at 404, 117 \nS. Ct. 1382. \nId. at 1143-44. This doctrine, however, is not at issue in this case because Plaintiffs did not argue \nthat the City’s conduct amounted to deliberate indifference. Indeed, Plaintiffs argue that they are \nnot required to allege deliberate indifference to succeed on their ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims. See ECF 90 at 35 (“Plaintiffs Are Not Required to Show a Policy, Custom, or Practice of \nDiscrimination or Deliberate Indifference.”). In arguing their constitutional claims, Plaintiffs also \ndo not assert deliberate indifference.15 Id. at 36-42. \n \n15 Although Plaintiffs allege “deliberate indifference” in their Complaint in alleging the \nelements of their causes of action under Monell, the ADA, and the Rehabilitation Act, Plaintiffs \neither ignore arguments challenging deliberate indifference (such as raised by the County \nDefendants in their supplemental briefing on Monell) or deny that they need allege facts \ndemonstrating deliberate indifference (such as in addressing deliberate indifference with respect \nto their ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims). Thus, the bare allegation in the Complaint does not \nserve to save any omission-based Monell claim. See, e.g., Walsh v. Nevada Dep’t of Hum. \nRes., 471 F.3d 1033, 1037 (9th Cir. 2006) (stating that a plaintiff who “makes a claim” in a \ncomplaint “but fails to raise the issue in response to a defendant’s motion to dismiss” that claim, \n“has effectively abandoned [that] claim”); accord Starr, 652 F.3d at 1216 (stating that a \ncomplaint may not simply allege the elements of a cause of action). \nPAGE 31 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 32 of 34\n \n3.  The County Defendants \nThe County Defendants argue that Plaintiffs do not allege sufficient facts to state a claim \nagainst the County Defendants under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The County Defendants assert that \nPlaintiffs Phillip Wolfe, Katalina Durden, and Juniper Simonis do not allege any facts \nspecifically against the County Defendants. Plaintiffs do not respond to this argument. Plaintiffs’ \nresponse brief combines the conduct of all Defendants in arguing that Plaintiffs’ adequately \nallege sufficient harm. The Court agrees that Plaintiffs Wolfe, Durden, and Simonis do not allege \nfacts regarding the conduct of any Multnomah County personnel and the Court grants this aspect \nof the County Defendants’ motion. \nThe County Defendants argue that only Plaintiff Melissa Lewis alleges facts against the \nCounty Defendants, which she does in paragraphs 93-94 of the Complaint. Those paragraphs \nallege as follows: \n93. On or about August 9, 2020, Melissa attended a protest at the \nJustice Center. Multnomah County Sheriffs’ deputies forcibly \nremoved her from the area, along with other press and protesters, \nso officers would have a clear path to the parking lot. The deputies \nprovided no warning before they began screaming at the group to \nmove, striking them, and pushing them hard with batons. \n94. Melissa complied with the deputies’ directions, and she was on \nthe sidewalk, where a temporary restraining order said she had a \nright to be. Nonetheless, the deputies pulled Melissa by her \nbackpack, shoved her shoulders, and struck her ribs with a baton \nfor not moving quickly enough. But Melissa feared that she might \ntwist her ankle or worse if she moved any faster. When Melissa \ntold the deputies she was complying, they told her to turn around \nand stop filming. At no time did the deputies communicate to \nMelissa, other members of the press, or the protesters where they \nshould be; instead, the deputies pushed, pulled, and jabbed them \nwith batons. \nECF 1 at 21-22. \nPAGE 32 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 33 of 34\n \nAfter oral argument, the County Defendants agreed not to assert in this motion that these \nallegations fail to allege excessive force. In their supplemental briefing, however, they argue that \nMs. Lewis fails to allege a claim against Sheriff Michael Reese in his official capacity or against \nthe County for Monell liability.   \nThe County Defendants argue that the allegations regarding Melissa Lewis’s alleged \nharm only involve deputies and not any decisionmaker, Sheriff Reese, or any official policy or \nlongstanding custom or practice. Thus, argue the County Defendants, Ms. Lewis fails to state a \nclaim under Monell. The County Defendants also argue that under Ninth Circuit precedent, a \nsingle instance such as Ms. Lewis experienced cannot support a Monell claim. Davis v. City of \nEllensburg, 869 F.2d 1230, 1233 (9th Cir. 1989) (“A plaintiff cannot prove the existence of a \nmunicipal policy or custom based solely on the occurrence of a single incident of \nunconstitutional action by a non-policymaking employee.” (emphasis in original)).  \nThe County Defendants also argue that the Complaint is deficient to the extent it intends \nto assert a claim for an absence of a policy. The County Defendants contend that the Complaint \nfails to allege facts supporting deliberate indifference. Deliberate indifference occurs when the \nneed for more or different action “is so obvious, and the inadequacy [of the current procedure] so \nlikely to result in the violation of constitutional rights, that the policymakers . . . can reasonably \nbe said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.” Canton, 489 U.S. at 390. The County \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs could have alleged facts such as describing a policy that should \nbe implemented or the policy of other jurisdictions that should be emulated. Plaintiffs did not \nrespond to the County Defendants’ arguments regarding Plaintiffs insufficient allegations under \nMonell or for supervisor liability for Sheriff Reese. \nPAGE 33 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 143    Filed 10/08/21    Page 34 of 34\n \nThe Court agrees with the County Defendants that Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding \nMs. Lewis’s encounter fail to state a claim against Sheriff Reese for supervisor liability or \nagainst the County under Monell. For the reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs’ allegations also fail \nto state a claim against the County Defendants for a custom or practice based on the failure to \nadopt a policy. Plaintiffs fail to allege facts showing that a policy of the County Defendants \namounts to deliberate indifference to any specific Plaintiff’s constitutional rights. Thus, \nPlaintiffs’ claims for money damages against the County Defendants are dismissed.  \nC.  Preliminary Injunction \nBecause the Court grants the pending motions to dismiss, the Court denies Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for preliminary injunction as moot. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court GRANTS the motions to dismiss filed by Defendants Chad Wolf and Donald \nWashington, in their personal capacities (ECF 54), Defendants Donald Washington and \nSecretary Alejandro Mayorkas in their official capacities (ECF 65), Defendant Terri Davie \n(ECF 55), Defendants the City of Portland, Mayor Ted Wheeler, and Police Chief Chuck Lovell \n(ECF 77), and Defendants Multnomah County and Sheriff Michael Reese (ECF 66). The Court \nDENIES AS MOOT Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \nDATED this 8th day of October, 2021. \n \n              /s/ Michael H. Simon     \nMichael H.

Americans with Disabilities \nCITY OF PORTLAND, an Oregon  Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 12131–12134) \nmunicipal corporation; and  2.  Section 504 of the \nMULTNOMAH COUNTY, a political  Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \nsubdivision of the State of Oregon, and  §§ 794, 794a) \nDOES 1-100,   \n \nDefendants.    \n \n   \n \nPage 1 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 2 of 65\n     \n \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  This amended action seeks to protect the rights of Oregonians with \ndisabilities who exercise their fundamental constitutional rights to assemble and \nfreely speak in protest, in an effort to hold their government and its leaders \naccountable. Plaintiffs’ causes of action arise under two laws that exist for the \npurpose of ensuring that people with disabilities do not have to suffer the \nparticularly biting form of indignity that results when their own governments and \npublic servants discriminate against them (or worse, act as if they don’t exist at all). \nThose civil rights laws are Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and its \nimplementing regulations, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131–12134; 28 C.F.R. part 35 (the \n“ADA”), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and its implementing \nregulations, 29 U.S.C. §§ 794–794a; 28 C.F.R. part 41 (“Section 504”).  \n2.  As part of their causes of action, Plaintiffs seek damages for past \nharm, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief, to remedy the ongoing failures of \nthe City of Portland, through the Portland Police Bureau (“PPB”), and Multnomah \nCounty, through the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office (“the Sheriffs”), to fulfill \ntheir decades-old legal duties to ensure that Plaintiffs Philip Wolfe, Katalina \n(“Katie”) Durden, Jackson (“Jack”) Tudela,1 and the many other Oregonians with \n \n1 Plaintiff Philip Wolfe’s gender identity is nonbinary and Philip does not use \npronouns. Philip will be referred to as Philip. Plaintiffs Katie Durden and Jack \nTudela’s gender identities are also nonbinary and they use they/them pronouns. \nPlaintiffs’ counsel have identified each of their respective pronouns in the \ncaption. Plaintiffs request that counsel and the Court make every effort to use \nplaintiffs’ and counsel’s correct pronouns in all court filings, in- and out-of-court \nproceedings, and correspondence. \nPage 2 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 3 of 65\n     \n \ndisabilities and their aides, have equal access to, and the ability to safely to \nparticipate in, the protests that have proven integral to our nation’s, state’s, and \ncity’s systems of democratic representation.  \n3.  Indeed, the two laws on which Plaintiffs’ suit is based are the direct \nresult of protest. In 1977, although the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 had already been \nin place for several years, the federal government had made no effort to implement \nthe requirement under Section 504 that its buildings be accessible to those with \ndisabilities. Tired of waiting, people with disabilities organized nationwide protests \nin federal offices, with disabled protesters occupying the federal buildings that our \ngovernment refused to make accessible to them. Some protesters lasted a few days, \nbut more than 100 protesters in San Francisco—including disabled protesters, \ninterpreters, and personal care aides—occupied the Secretary of Health, Education, \nand Welfare offices for a month. The federal government tried cutting off their \naccess to phone lines and water supply, but they did not leave. Instead, members of \nthe Black Panther Party and the Gray Panthers brought them food and supplies. \nThe result was the federal government finally implementing the Section 504 \nregulations.2   \n4.  Just under 15 years later, people with disabilities were again driven to \nprotest when Congress stalled passage of the ADA. Having had enough, hundreds of \nprotesters with mobility disabilities left their mobility devices—wheelchairs, canes, \n \n2 Julia Carmel, Before the ADA, There Was Section 504, N.Y. TIMES (July 22, 2020), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/504-sit-in-disability-rights.html.  \nPage 3 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 4 of 65\n     \n \nwalkers, crutches—at the bottom of the steps of the U.S. Capitol Building and \ncrawled up its marble steps on March 12, 1990. Many of the protesters were \narrested (not a new experience for many of them, in their work to protest and \ndisrupt systems of power). But, just as with the Section 504 Sit-Ins, the Capitol \nCrawl proved effective—then-President George H.W. Bush signed the ADA into law \njust over a month later, on July 26, 1990.3 \n5.  Plaintiffs are all Oregonians who, for years, have dedicated their time \nand energy to raise awareness of and advance causes that make Portland a more \nsocially just and equitable place for everyone to live. Their work in that space has \ntaken many forms, including, as relevant to this lawsuit, by participating in the \nprotests and political demonstrations that began in May 2020—demonstrations \nprimarily focused on opposing police violence that systemically and \ndisproportionately hurts marginalized people. In a development that proved ironic \nbut surprising to no one, PPB and the Sheriffs, through their words and conduct, \nconveyed definitively the following message to Plaintiffs and others: Disabled \npeople, and those associated with them, do not belong at a protest.  \n6.  This Court is well aware of the tactics that Defendants have used to \npolice these protests. Plaintiffs bring this Amended Complaint to focus the Court on \nhow the burden of those tactics has fallen disproportionately on them and other \nprotesters with disabilities, effectively chilling the free speech rights of that entire \n \n3 Julia Carmel, ‘Nothing About Us Without Us’: 16 Moments in the Fight for \nDisability Rights, N.Y. TIMES (July 22, 2020), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/us/ada-disabilities-act-history.html.  \nPage 4 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 5 of 65\n     \n \npopulation. When Defendants refuse to give orders to disperse at protests using \nclear audible and visual cues, it is essentially impossible for people in Plaintiffs’ \nposition to comply with those orders.4 Indeed, from Plaintiffs’ vantage points, \nDefendants’ means of issuing announcements are no more effective than someone \nwhispering the warning Fire! in a death metal concert or sending a fax to warn of \nan active shooter. Defendants’ announcements are all the more useless when, as \nhere, Defendants deprive Plaintiffs of any opportunity meaningfully to comply with \nwhat little of their announcements they can make out—Defendants wait, at best, a \nfew minutes before they unloose all manner of crowd control tactics on anyone and \neveryone in their path, resulting in chaos and pandemonium. In fact, protesters \nwith disabilities and their aides are often brutalized even as they do everything \nwithin their ability to comply with Defendants’ instructions, at every step informing \nofficers of their disabilities. \n7.  Simply put, Defendants have failed to establish policies, procedures, \nand officer training for policing protests and implementing crowd control and public \nsafety measures that afford people with disabilities the same opportunity to engage \nin protest-related activities as non-disabled protesters. As a result of Defendants’ \n \n4 Providing both visual and audible warnings multiple times before using crowd \ncontrol tactics is neither a new nor novel concept. Police in Hong Kong have been \nusing a combination of verbal announcements and colored flags with written \nannouncements to issue their warnings for years. See, Hong Kong Police tactics \nagainst citywide protests, SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST (Aug. 16, 2019), \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7Yr1hYcrp0 (showing footage of Hong Kong \nPolice color-coded flag system).  \nPage 5 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 6 of 65\n     \n \npast and ongoing failures, Plaintiffs and other people with disabilities are subjected \nto use of force and are chilled from participating in protest.  \n8.  For example, Defendants have failed to communicate dispersal orders \nin a manner that people who are Deaf or hard of hearing can understand. For \nPlaintiff Philip Wolfe, who is Deaf, Defendants’ failure to provide effective \ncommunication of police orders puts Philip at great risk of being perceived by \nDefendants as defying their orders, which Defendants will then use as justification \nfor subjecting Philip to use of force. Effective communication from Defendants is \nessential to ensure Philip and others who are Deaf or hard of hearing can safely \nexercise their constitutional rights to peacefully protest.  \n9.  Additionally, verbal orders provided by Defendants are often \ncontradictory, ever-changing, and confusing, making it difficult for anyone, and \nessentially impossible for people who are blind or low vision or who have mobility \nimpairments, to comply with those orders. Those individuals also typically may \nneed additional time to comply with orders because they often must first orient \nthemselves before navigating or move more slowly than others. Plaintiff Katie \nDurden, who is blind, requires these policy modifications to be able to maneuver \nsafely in protests and respond to orders issued by law enforcement.  \n10.  Plaintiff Jack Tudela works as a sighted guide for Katie. Like other \npersons with disabilities who rely on assistants, it is imperative that Katie remain \nin close physical contact with Jack to maneuver complex and chaotic environments \nsafely. When Defendants use violence and excessive force to separate people with \nPage 6 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 7 of 65\n     \n \ndisabilities, like Katie, from their guides, like Jack, it becomes impossible for them \nto comply with orders in a safe way, subjecting the disabled protester to further \nharm.  \n11.  Defendants’ officers have also too often targeted people with \ndisabilities for harassment and violence in retaliation for participating in protests. \nThey have stood in their riot lines and pointed and laughed at Katie, their smiles \ntaking on a more sheepish character when they realized that those standing next to \nKatie were perfectly capable of seeing what they did.  Most tellingly, they have told \npeople with disabilities that they should not be attending protests at all.  \n12.  Defendants’ actions and inaction violate the ADA and Section 504. \nDefendants lack proper policies, procedures, and officer training to ensure effective \ncommunication and other reasonable accommodations and modifications for \nprotesters with disabilities. The lack of proper policies and training have denied, \nand continue to deny, Plaintiffs and others equal access and opportunity to be non-\nviolent participants in protests.  \n13.  As a result, Plaintiffs have been physically and psychologically harmed \nand deterred from attending protests or otherwise forced to curtail the exercise of \ntheir First Amendment rights due to risk of violence and undue harm. Plaintiffs \nseek damages, declaratory, and injunctive relief to compensate them for past harm \nand to ensure that the City of Portland and Multnomah County comply with the \nADA and Section 504 so that Plaintiffs and other disabled protesters can safely \nattend demonstrations in the future. \nPage 7 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 8 of 65\n     \n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n14.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331(a) and 1343 because Plaintiffs allege violations of the \nADA and Section 504, which are both federal laws. This Court has jurisdiction over \nPlaintiffs’ claims for injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 \nand 2202 and Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n15.  Venue is proper in the District of Oregon pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1391(b) because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nPlaintiffs’ claims occurred in the District of Oregon and because Defendants are \nsubject to personal jurisdiction in the District of Oregon. \nPARTIES \n \n16.  Plaintiff Philip Wolfe has been a resident of Portland, Oregon, since \n2010, including at all times relevant to this lawsuit. Philip has been Deaf since \nbirth and communicates through American Sign Language (ASL). Philip is a \nqualified person with a disability within the meaning of the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act. Philip has a lengthy history of activism and involvement in the \nPortland social justice community. Philip has served as Chair of Portland’s \nCommunity Oversight Advisory Board (COAB) and ran for Portland City Council in \n2018 and 2020 to represent the needs of all Portlanders, with the benefit of the \ninsight and perspective that runs attendant to Philip’s own lived experience as a \nDeaf person. Philip also has a long history of exercising First Amendment rights \nthrough protest. Philip has participated in various social justice protests in \nPage 8 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 9 of 65\n     \n \nPortland since 2014, including demonstrations for the #MeToo, March for Our \nLives, and Black Lives Matter movements, as well as for climate change and \nopposing war. Philip continues regularly to attend protests for racial and social \njustice issues but is limited to attending those events in which PPB, the Sheriffs, or \nboth, are not expected to be present at all—for fear that those law enforcement \nagencies will discriminate against and not even attempt to fulfill their legal duties \nto accommodate Philip, putting Philip at risk of severe harm. Philip is forced to \nleave some demonstrations early and, as a result of Defendants’ demonstrated \nconduct, is left with no choice but to avoid others altogether. \n17.  Plaintiff Katie Durden has been a resident of the Portland \nmetropolitan area since 2008, including at all times relevant to this lawsuit. When \nKatie was four years old, they contracted an illness that damaged the optic nerve in \nboth of their eyes, rendering them legally blind. They are a qualified person with a \ndisability within the meaning of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Katie uses a \nvariety of tools to navigate daily life: their service dog, a Black Labrador named \nBetsy, guides them as they walk, often with a reflective red and white cane in their \nother hand; screen readers verbally announce text written on screens; Braille \nprovides a tactile replacement for hard-copy text; and, of course, Katie’s hearing \ngives them sensory feedback about the context of their surroundings. Katie’s own \nlived experiences—not just as a blind person, but also as someone who is xicanx, \nneurodivergent, genderqueer, and, simply, human—have informed their beliefs \nabout social justice. For years, Katie participated in protest demonstrations largely \nPage 9 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 10 of 65\n     \n \nin the background, helping independent journalists disseminate their protest \ncoverage online. Katie made the choice to participate that way because they were \ndissuaded from attending protests in person, given Defendants’ disregard of—and \nsometimes outright disdain for—people with disabilities at the protests. In June \n2020, however, Katie decided to begin attending protests as an independent \nmember of the press who records the protests in binaural, 360° sound, to give people \n(including those with low or no vision) a different way to experience protest \ncoverage.5 When attending the protests, Katie did not feel safe bringing Betsy to \nguide them, for fear that Defendants’ crowd control measures would put their \ninvaluable service dog in harm’s way. So, Katie undertook substantial efforts to find \nand train people to serve as their sighted guides—one of whom was Plaintiff Jack \nTudela—to assist them with avoiding curbs, poles, and other physical hazards as \nthey move quickly to comply with Defendants’ orders to disperse. Katie was also \nsure to always have their reflective red and white cane in their hand to help them \nnavigate and to communicate to officers, via that universally recognized mobility \ndevice, that Katie was blind. In spite of the burdens that Katie undertook themself \nto account for Defendants’ lack of any meaningful efforts to accommodate people \nwith disabilities, Katie eventually had to cease attending protests in person \nbecause, as this Amended Complaint will describe in detail, Defendants went out of \n \n5 Katie’s binaural audio coverage of the 2020 protests is available online via \nSoundCloud here: https://soundcloud.com/user-426859291, and via YouTube here: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC38WDr3vztj6sI0Dz3g3nvg.  \nPage 10 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 11 of 65\n     \n \ntheir way to thwart the self-accommodations that Katie had arranged to protect \ntheir personal safety.  \n18.  Plaintiff Jack Tudela has resided in the Portland metropolitan area \nsince 2014, including at all times relevant to this lawsuit. Jack attended their first \nprotest at age twelve and over the last several years has attended at least 2-3 \nprotests per year. In the summer of 2020, Jack began attending protests almost \nnightly. Jack began assisting Katie as a sighted guide in August 2020 and has \nserved as Katie’s primary sighted guide since that time. As a sighted guide, Jack \naccompanies Katie to assist with navigating safely in the crowd and around \nobstacles, as well as with directions and compliance with police orders. As Katie’s \nsighted guide, Jack is an individual associated with an individual with a known \ndisability within the meaning of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. 28 C.F.R.  \n§ 35.130(g); 29 U.S.C. §§ 794(a), 794a(a)(2).  Jack is also an independent member of \nthe press who assists Katie’s journalism to document protest activity. By virtue of \nJack’s association with Katie as a sighted guide, Jack has been subject to \ndiscrimination and harm by Defendants and is deterred along with Katie from \nattending protests due to the discrimination and harm by Defendants. \n19.  Defendant City of Portland (the “City”) is a municipality located in \nMultnomah County in the State of Oregon. As a local governmental entity receiving \nfederal funds, the City is subject to suit under the ADA and Section 504. 42 U.S.C. § \n12131(1); 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  \nPage 11 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 12 of 65\n     \n \n20.  Defendant Multnomah County (“the County”) is a political subdivision \nof the State of Oregon. As a local governmental entity receiving federal funds, the \nCounty, too, is subject to suit under the ADA and Section 504. 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1); \n29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  \n21.  Defendants Does 1-100 are other government agencies and individual \nofficers, agents, and employees of Defendants who violated Plaintiffs’ rights, but \nwhose identities are unknown at this time. This Complaint will be amended with \nleave of the Court after they are identified in discovery. \n22.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and therefore allege that each of \nthe Defendants is the agent, ostensible agent, alter ego, master, servant, trustor, \ntrustee, employer, employee, representative, affiliate, partner, associate, or similar \nlegal capacity of each of the other Defendants and that, at all times, they acted and \nperformed (or omitted to act or perform) within the course and scope of each \ncapacity, and with the authorization, consent, permission or ratification of each of \nthe other Defendants. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nPortland’s Enduring History of Protest \n23.  Even before Oregon entered Statehood in 1859, Portland was a city of \nprotest. Indeed, since at least 1857, Portlanders have a documented history of \ntaking to the streets to demand change in, and raise awareness of, issues central to \nour lives: equity in education, press freedom, women’s suffrage, immigrant rights, \nlabor rights, socioeconomic inequality, environmental justice, war and other foreign \nPage 12 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 13 of 65\n     \n \npolicy, police accountability, LGBTQ+ rights, Indigenous Peoples’ rights, and racial \njustice, among other things. In other words, before Portland was known for its \ndonuts, or its airport carpet, or its food-cart pods, or for “putting a bird on it,” it was \nknown for being home to active, engaged citizens, who make use of their First \nAmendment rights to effect lasting democratic change.  \n24.  Portlanders remain true to their tradition of protest to this day. \nAccording to Portland’s current mayor during an interview with CNN in 2019, \nPortland is the site of around 200 demonstrations per year.6 Portland’s identity is so \nassociated with protest that former President George H.W. Bush called Portland \n“Little Beirut” during anti-war protests in the 1990s.7 And in 2020, the \nU.S. Department of Justice, under former President Donald J. Trump, attempted to \ndesignate Portland (along with New York City and Seattle) as a different \njurisdiction altogether, wholly separate from the rest of the country.8  \n25.  Indeed, the past decade in Portland has been characterized by nearly \nceaseless protest in some form or another. In May 2011, we had Hands Across \nHawthorne, in response to a group of five men following and attacking a gay couple \n \n6 Jason Kravarik & Sara Snider, Why Portland? The city’s history of protest takes an \nexceptional turn, CNN (July 26, 2020), https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/26/us/portland-\nprotest-history-federal-police/index.html. \n7 Ken Boddie, Surprised about Portland protest? ‘You don’t know Portland’, KOIN 6 \nNEWS (May 13, 2021), https://www.koin.com/is-portland-over/surprised-about-\nportland-protests-you-dont-know-portland/.  \n8 Rebecca Ellis, Justice Department labels Portland ‘anarchist jurisdiction,’ \nthreatens cuts to federal funding, OPB (Sep. 21, 2020), \nhttps://www.opb.org/article/2020/09/21/justice-department-labels-portland-\nanarchist-jurisdiction-threatens-to-cuts-federal-funding/.  \nPage 13 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 14 of 65\n     \n \nwho held hands while they walked across the Hawthorne Bridge. In October 2011, \nfollowing Occupy Wall Street, we saw the start of Occupy Portland, protests that \ncontinued through 2015. In 2016, Portlanders protested the election of Donald J. \nTrump as United States President. In 2017, Portland joined in hosting the Women’s \nMarch. In 2018, Portland youth led 12,000 people in March for Our Lives Portland, \nto demonstrate against the lack of political response to school shootings. And in \n2019, Proud Boys protested all the protests in Portland during their End Domestic \nTerrorism Rally (also known as the “Better Dead than Red Rally”).  \n26.  That brings us to 2020, and through today. The most nationally \npublicized protests began in May 2020, when Portlanders yet again filled the streets \nalmost every day and night to protest police violence against Black people. Just two \nmonths before those protests erupted, Louisville Metro Police Department officers \nburst through Breonna Taylor’s door in the middle of the night and murdered her in \nher own bed. Then in May, Minneapolis Police Department officer Derek Chauvin \ndug his knee into George Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. Mr. Floyd’s last \nwords reminded our nation of the same anguished words another Black man, Eric \nGarner, had uttered only six years earlier when pleading with New York Police \nDepartment officer Daniel Pantaleo to release him from the chokehold that was \nkilling him: “I can’t breathe.” “I can’t breathe.” “I can’t breathe.” “I can’t breathe.” \nMr. Floyd and Mr. Garner were not alone in spending their last gasps on those \nthree words, only to be ignored by the police officers who had hogtied them, or \ncovered their heads with mesh hoods, or Tased them multiple times, or put them in \nPage 14 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 15 of 65\n     \n \na chokehold, or knelt on their necks, or told them that they were lying because, “if \nyou can talk then you obviously can [expletive] breathe.”9  \n27.  The Black Lives Matter movement cannot be isolated from the \ndisability rights movement. Freddie Gray, Laquan MacDonald, Kevin Matthews, \nTamir Rice, Eric Garner, Elijah McClain, Charleena Lyles, Sandra Bland, \nQuintonio LeGrier, Stephon Watts, Korryn Gains, Natasha McKenna, Eric Smith \nand Daniel Prude were all Black, disabled victims of state violence. These names \nserve as a strong reminder that the combination of disability and skin color \ncontinues to be stigmatized by law enforcement. While there is no reliable national \ndatabase tracking how many Black people with disabilities are shot by police each \nyear, media sources have reported that since the beginning of January 2015, 244 \nBlack people, who carried a mental disability, have been fatally shot by law \nenforcement.10 Despite the startling statistics, these media findings only scratch the \nsurface. The death toll that stems from law enforcement’s reaction to the \nintersectionality of both race and disability remains unknown. \n28.  These protests that erupted in the summer of 2020 have continued, \nthough they have often taken on additional meaning—meaning not separate from, \nbut inextricably intertwined with, the issues surrounding State-sanctioned violence \nand systemic marginalization of whole groups of people—as different events have \n \n9 Mike Baker et al., Three Words. 70 Cases.

Those events, each of which drew protest \nresponse in Portland, include:   \n•  July 4, 2020: After the nightly protests in downtown Portland had \ndwindled into smaller and smaller numbers and nearly ceased \naltogether, federal agents breathed new life into the protests after \nimplementing Operation Diligent Valor.11 \n•  August 23–25, 2020: Kenosha Police Department officers shot \nJacob Blake seven times in the back. In the ensuing protests, 17-\nyear-old Kyle Rittenhouse traveled from Illinois and patrolled the \nprotests with an AR-15, killing two people and severely wounding a \nthird. In stark contrast to how Kenosha police officers treated Jacob \nBlake just two days earlier, they saw Mr. Rittenhouse with an AR-\n15 early in the evening of protests and threw him a bottle of water \nas they drove by in their armored vehicle; and after Mr. \nRittenhouse had fired shots, the police let him safely walk away \nfrom the protest with his rifle slung across his body and his arms \nraised. \n•  September 18, 2020: A nurse who worked at ICE filed a \nwhistleblower complaint, reporting that an ICE doctor—referred to \n \n11 Shawn Boburg et al., Swept up in the federal response to Portland protests: ‘I \ndidn’t know if I was going to be seen again’, THE WASHINGTON POST (Sept. 10, 2020), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/investigations/portland-protesters-\nfederal-response-trump/. \nPage 16 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 17 of 65\n     \n \nby the immigrant women detained in that facility as the “uterus \ncollector”—was sterilizing immigrant women detainees with no \nmedical basis for doing so.12  \n•  April 16, 2021: Portland Police officer Zachary DeLong shot and \nkilled Robert Delgado in Lents Park. Mr. Delgado was experiencing \na mental health crisis at the time. After Officer DeLong shot Mr. \nDelgado, police continued shouting directions at Mr. Delgado for 9 \nminutes as he lay motionless in the grass, believing (no doubt due \nto the common stereotype that people with mental illness are \n“manipulative” and “dangerous”) that he was merely pretending to \nbe injured.13 \n•  June 24, 2021: Portland Police officer Curtis Brown shot and killed \nMichael Ray Townsend, who was sitting outside a Motel 6 in the \nLloyd Center. Mr. Townsend, who lived with mental illness, had \ncalled 911 himself, to ask for help because he was having suicidal \nideations.14  \n \n12 Jacob Soboroff et al., Lawyers allege abuse of migrant women by gynecologist for \nGeorgia ICE detention center, NBC NEWS (Sept. 15, 2020), \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/nurse-questions-medical-care-operations-\ndetainees-immigration-jail-georgia-n1240110. \n13 Jonathan Levinson & Conrad Wilson, Grand jury declines to charge officer who \nkilled Robert Delgado in Portland park, OPB (Sept. 24, 2021), \nhttps://www.opb.org/article/2021/09/24/multnomah-county-grand-jury-declines-\ncharge-police-officer-who-killed-robert-delgado-in-lents-park/. \n14 Jonathan Levinson, Man killed by Portland police called 911 himself, seeking \nmental health care, OPB (June 28, 2021), \n \nPage 17 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 18 of 65\n     \n \n29.  Protests are still happening in relation to those and current events. In \nSeptember of this year, a grand jury declined to indict Portland Police Officer \nDeLong for any crime associated with shooting Mr. Delgado. In November of this \nyear, a jury acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse. Portland protests followed, demonstrating \nthat this community’s protests are far from over, but Plaintiffs continue to be \ndeterred from participating.  \n30.  Over these past 18 months, Portland protest attendees have been met \nwith officers clad in riot gear nearly every night—no matter whether the protesters \nare breaking windows or spray-painting buildings (true, that has happened); or \ndrawing on a public street with sidewalk chalk (that, too); or holding a solemn \ncandlelight vigil for a protester who was killed by a Seattle driver who blasted his \ncar through the crowd of protesters; or linking arms and singing.  \n31.  No matter how protesters protest, all protest attendees find \nthemselves being told they are not complying with the officers’ orders correctly. \nThen, as they choke on clouds of tear gas or other noxious fumes, or reorient \nthemselves after officers threw a flash bang grenade right next to them, Defendants \nkettle and bull-rush them, shove them in the back with billy clubs, throw and tackle \nthem to the ground, hold them down and empty an entire can of mace in their eyes, \n \nhttps://www.opb.org/article/2021/06/28/man-killed-by-portland-police-called-911-\nhimself-seeking-mental-health-care/. \nPage 18 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 19 of 65\n     \n \nnose, and mouth, and then sometimes—just in case that’s all not enough—deliver \nblow after blow with closed fist to the face.15   \n32.  This police response is not tied to probable cause or reasonable \nsuspicion by any definition of those legal standards; instead, it’s tied to the officers’ \nown definition of “refusing to obey lawful orders”—a definition that, upon \nexamination, includes persons failing to hear or perceive the officers’ orders in the \nfirst place, or failing to understand the orders because they are confusing and often \nconflicting, or failing to move as quickly as officers want them to. And then, for good \nmeasure, the officers hop 12-deep onto the runner boards of riot vans, searching for \nand arresting protest attendees who could not keep up with the rest of the crowd.  \n33.  It should be no surprise that this “culture of compliance,” if left \nentirely to the officers’ own discretion, serves disproportionately to penalize people \nwith disabilities, including Plaintiffs. It was, and remains, essential that police \nofficers have clear direction and training for interacting with protesters with \nvarious disabilities—for, just like Robert Delgado, and Michael Ray Townsend, and \nElijah McClain, protest attendees who cannot comply with police orders because \nthey cannot hear them, or do not understand them, or simply do not have the \ncapacity to comply exactly as officers want them to, is not defiance by any means; it \n \n15 See, Conrad Wilson, 3rd active duty Portland police officer possibly facing protest-\nrelated charges, OPB (June 25, 2021), \nhttps://www.opb.org/article/2021/06/25/portland-police-possible-charges-3rd-officer-\nprotest-enforcement/ (embedding and describing video footage in which PPB Officer \nThomas Clark tackled a protest medic and then punched him in the face repeatedly, \nleaving the medic, himself a Neurotrauma Intensive Care Unit nurse, with a \ntraumatic brain injury).  \nPage 19 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 20 of 65\n     \n \nis simply the reality of what their bodies are capable of doing in that moment. When \npolice interpret disabilities as threats or defiance, we see the result:  It is, too often, \na death sentence. No more. \nDefendants’ Response to the 2020 Protests \n34.  As explained above, Defendants met the protests that started in May \n2020 with brutal crowd control tactics, including the use of force and “less-lethal” \nmunitions, such as tear gas, flashbang grenades, pepper balls, and rubber bullets. \nSince then, the Courts (including this one), the United States Attorney’s Office for \nthe District of Oregon, and the press have condemned that Defendants failed to use \ntheir training as police officers to evaluate the difference between people engaged in \ncriminal conduct (who may be subject to an appropriate level of force) and people \nwho pose no threat to officer or public safety (who should not be shot with crowd \ncontrol munitions, arrested, or otherwise singled out for physical force). \n35.  For example, on June 9, 2020, the Honorable Marco A. Hernández, \nUnited States District Judge for the District of Oregon, issued a temporary \nrestraining order restricting use of tear gas and other crowd control tactics, except \nwhere live or safety of the public or police were at risk.16 Judge Hernández’ order \nwas based on evidence (including testimony from PPB officers) that PPB had \nindiscriminately used tear gas during protests, at times without any evidence that \nwould support officers’ decision to use such a blanket measure that, by its nature, \naffects anyone who is nearby, including protesters engaged in only peaceful non-\n \n16 Don't Shoot Portland v.

According to PPB’s own data, self-reported by officers present at \nprotests and collected by PPB’s audit team, PPB used force over 2,378 times in the \nfirst month of the 2020 protests alone—tripling, in just 30 days, the number of force \nincidents PPB had used during the combined four years leading up to then.20  \n \n17 Id. at 1155. \n18 Don't Shoot Portland v.

Mayor Wheeler’s apology came shortly \nafter he decided to go to a protest himself, when DHS Operation Diligent Valor was \nin full effect. He got tear gassed that night, apparently experiencing for the first \ntime what that’s like. That he was tear gassed (likely by federal agents) made \nnational headlines.

Wheeler’s \napology rang fairly hollow to many in Portland, given that he had already earned \nthe nicknames “Tear Gas Teddy” and “War Crimes Wheeler”, for his ratification of \nPPB’s decision to deploy tear gas over 200 times on his watch as Portland Police \nCommissioner—well before the federal agents had started responding to the \nprotests.  \n20 Alex Zielinski, Portland Police Used Force Against Protestors 2,378 Times During \nFirst Month of 2020 Protests, PORTLAND MERCURY (Nov. 13, 2020), \n \nPage 21 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 22 of 65\n     \n \n37.  Defendants’ approach to policing the 2020 protests has also raised \nflags with civil rights attorneys for the U.S. government. As this Court knows, the \nUnited States Attorney’s Office for the District of Oregon and the United States \nDepartment of Justice, Civil Rights Division, have been aware of the City’s and \nPPB’s propensity to resort to excessive force—especially when it comes to policing \npeople with disabilities—since at least 2012.21 DOJ has been monitoring, and \ncontinues to monitor, the City’s and PPB’s use of force and related conduct under \nthe parties’ Settlement Agreement. As part of the DOJ’s monitoring role, it released \nits Fifth Periodic Compliance Assessment Report, which covered a review of PPB’s \nconduct during the 2020 protests.22 The DOJ’s findings in that Report confirm that \nPPB officers believe—and their senior supervisors affirm them in believing—that \npeople at a protest who walk slowly or fail to disperse are engaged in “active \naggression” and are thus fair game for being subjected to physical force.23  The DOJ \nalso included in its Report that PPB officers and their supervisors relied on \nannouncements broadcast over the LRAD as a “de-escalation” technique. The DOJ \ntook that opportunity to remind the City and PPB that making LRAD \n \nhttps://www.portlandmercury.com/blogtown/2020/11/13/30444612/portland-police-\nused-force-against-protesters-2378-times-during-the-police-used-force-2378-times-\nduring-first-month-of-2020-protests. \n21 Complaint, United States v. City of Portland, No. 3:12-cv-02265-SI (D. Or. Dec. \n17, 2012), ECF No. 1.  \n22 DOJ’s Fifth Periodic Compliance Assessment Report, United States v. City of \nPortland, No. 3:12-cv-02265-SI (D. Or. Feb. 10, 2021), ECF No. 236-1. \n23 Id. at 8–9.  \nPage 22 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 23 of 65\n     \n \nannouncements “may be valid warnings to the crowd generally,” but officers “should \nnot assume that subjects heard the LRAD.”24  \n38.  Plaintiffs are informed, believe, and thereupon allege that the City and \nPPB often enlist other law enforcement agencies to provide assistance or backup in \ncrowd control during protests. Plaintiffs are further informed, believe, and \nthereupon allege that the City and PPB typically coordinate with the County and \nthe Sheriff’s deputies to be present at protests and to provide assistance or backup \nin implementing crowd control measures.  \n39.  Plaintiffs are informed, believe, and thereupon allege that, both PPB \nand the Sheriffs work in tandem to respond to protests in Portland and, as a result, \neach agency is liable for failing to provide reasonable accommodations to Plaintiffs \nand other protesters with disabilities and the resulting harm.   \n40.  Additionally, at times, State, County, or City officials, or some \ncombination of them, have used the power of their respective offices to authorize \nand provide structure for law enforcement agencies to share authority and \nresponsibility in policing protests. For example, on September 25, 2020, in \npreparation for the Proud Boys rally and demonstrations, Oregon Governor Kate \nBrown issued Executive Order 20-54, which established a unified incident \ncommand, mobilizing Sheriffs and other local law enforcement agencies to work \nwith PPB in a collaborative, structured joint command. Likewise, in early \nNovember 2020, Governor Brown issued similar Executive Orders 20-61, 20-62, 20-\n \n24 Id. at 9. \nPage 23 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 24 of 65\n     \n \n63 and 20-64, which established and extended the unified incident command of PPB \nand MCSO, among other agencies. \nDefendants’ Law Enforcement Response Disproportionately and \nDiscriminatorily Subjects Persons with Disabilities to Unjustified Police \nViolence \n41.  Persons with disabilities were disproportionately and discriminatorily \nsubjected to unnecessary and unreasonable use of force by Defendants due to their \nfailure to adopt and implement protest crowd control and public safety policies and \nprocedures that afford persons with disabilities equal opportunity to safely engage \nin protests. \n42.  In response to protests, Defendants’ issue declarations of unlawful \nassembly and orders demanding that protesters disperse from the area. Defendants \nprovided those dispersal orders only orally, and often with confusing and \ncontradictory directions as to how one can appropriately comply. Pursuant to \nDefendant PPB’s own internal policy, those who do not comply with dispersal \norders, or who comply with them too slowly, are “active aggressors” and thus subject \nto the use of force. The result of Defendants’ policy is to disproportionately affect \npeople with disabilities—like Philip, who is Deaf and cannot hear the dispersal \norders as PPB chooses to deliver them, or like Katie, who is blind and needs more \ntime to both decipher where Defendants want them to go and to navigate safely in \nthat direction.  \n43.  As described above, in 2012, the DOJ found that PPB engages in a \npattern or practice of unnecessary or unreasonable force during interactions with \nPage 24 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 25 of 65\n     \n \npeople who have or are perceived to have psychiatric disabilities.25 The DOJ found a \npattern of dangerous uses of force against persons who posed little or no threat and \nwho could not, as a result of their psychiatric disabilities, comply with officers’ \ncommands, including practices that escalate the use of force where there were clear \nearlier junctures when the force could have been avoided or minimized.26  These \npractices, the DOJ concluded, resulted from deficiencies in policy, training, and \nsupervision.27 \n44.  The DOJ’s findings, as part of its ongoing monitoring of PPB’s conduct \nduring the protests, confirm that PPB still does not have appropriate policies, \npractices, training, or supervision, to ensure that officers understand how to \nidentify and respond to the needs of people with disabilities. “Slow walking,” failing \nto disperse, and failing to hear an announcement over the LRAD are not the stuff of \n“active aggression,” as Defendants have so interpreted. In fact, “slow walking,” \nstaying in an area longer than PPB wants, or undertaking no action at all due to an \ninability to hear PPB’s announcements are things often associated with people with \ndisabilities. But where most people see that for what it is, Defendants see it as \n“active aggression,” and behave accordingly. \n45.  Because dispersal orders are often contradictory, confusing, and \nlacking orienting information, people who are Blind who rely on cardinal directions, \n \n25 Letter from Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, \nto Honorable Sam Adams, Mayor of City of Portland (September 12, 2012), at 1, \nhttps://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/469399.  \n26 Id. at 2.  \n27 Id. at 3. \nPage 25 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 26 of 65\n     \n \nlike Katie Durden, are unable to fully understand the directions to comply with the \norder before they are subjected to use of force. Defendants have also separated \npeople with disabilities from their guides and sighted aids, making it impossible for \nthem to safely comply with dispersal orders. \n46.  Defendants also fail to provide reasonable accommodations as required \nby the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act in their crowd dispersal methods. \nIndividuals with mobility impairments require additional time to be physically able \nto comply with dispersal orders, but Defendants rarely provide them with any \ntime—much less additional time—to comply before Defendants use force against \nthem. \n47.  Defendants’ failure to provide effective communication and reasonable \naccommodations denies people with disabilities full and equal access to the police \nservices they provide—services ostensibly intended to promote public safety—and  \ntherefore, violates the ADA and Section 504. \nDefendants Fail to Provide Effective Communication and Reasonable \nAccommodation to People who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing  \n48.  Defendants discriminate against people who are Deaf or hard of \nhearing at protests, including by failing to properly plan, modify standard policies, \nand otherwise provide reasonable accommodations and effective communication to \nprotesters and others. \n49.  Defendants have failed to provide effective and accessible \ncommunications in multiple formats regarding law enforcement or other activities \nat protests. Defendants have routinely failed to communicate orders to disperse, \nPage 26 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 27 of 65\n     \n \ninstructions for doing so, warnings about imminent use of force, and declarations of \nunlawful assemblies and riots. When Defendants have communicated orders at the \nprotests, they have done so only orally. As a result, people who are Deaf or hard of \nhearing are subjected to egregious uses of force for failing to comply with orders and \nwarnings that, for all practical purposes, were never issued to them. \n50.  Philip has been subjected to use of force on numerous occasions after \nbeing unable to understand a verbal dispersal order Defendants issued to the \ncrowd. For example, in 2014 during a Black Lives Matter Protest, Philip recalls \nbeing confronted by police and could see them attempting to communicate with \nPhilip. But, because no accommodations or interpretive services were provided, \nPhilip could not understand what the officers were trying to say. Then, suddenly, \npolice threw flashbang grenades and chaos ensued. Philip had no idea what was \nhappening or why officers were launching grenades. Philip had to flee for safety \namid the pandemonium.  \n51.  Another more recent example occurred on May 31, 2020, at around \n10:30 or 11:00 pm, when PPB officers again fired flashbang grenades into a crowd of \nthousands of people without any warning accessible to people who are Deaf or hard \nof hearing.  \n52.  Flashbang grenades, like their name suggests, simultaneously emit an \nextremely loud noise and a bright flash of light, specifically designed to disorient \npeople. For people who are Deaf or hard of hearing, flashbang grenades are \nparticularly disorienting and can cause additional hearing damage. Deaf and hard \nPage 27 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 28 of 65\n     \n \nof hearing people often rely heavily on their vision, along with residual hearing if \napplicable, to access and move through the world around them. Flashbang grenades \ncan cause Deaf and hard of hearing people to lose their residual hearing \ntemporarily or permanently, and to experience a temporary but devastating impact \non their ability to see and maintain physical balance. They may also experience \nsevere ringing in their ears. The combination of these various factors leads to \nextreme disorientation and an unsafe situation for Deaf and hard of hearing people. \nThis is especially true when Deaf or hard of hearing people are being commanded to \ndisperse an area within a specific, short time frame.  \n53.  Additionally, PPB frequently uses bright flood lights and the LRAD at \nextremely high volumes, both of which are disorientating for persons who are Deaf \nor hard of hearing. As Philip primarily relies on vision to determine what law \nenforcement officers are doing and whether they are giving orders or starting to \nclear protesters from the streets, very bright, disorienting lights obscure Philip’s \nability to see police and determine if it is time to disperse. Additionally, at very high \nvolumes, the LRAD can be disorienting by affecting the residual hearing for persons \nwho are hard of hearing, and for persons who are Deaf, like Philip, the vibrations of \nthe high volume reverberate throughout one’s body and can cause pressure in one’s \nhead, which is disorienting.  \n54.  PPB’s use of flashbang grenades and other force that evening caused a \nstampede in the crowd, putting Philip and others, including those with disabilities \nthat impact mobility, at significant risk of injury. Philip and Philip’s friends, who \nPage 28 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 29 of 65\n     \n \nare also Deaf, desperately tried to hold hands and stay together amid the chaos. \nPPB officers then fired tear gas into the crowd, causing Philip and others to cough \nand Philip’s eyes to burn and water profusely. As a result, Philip was unable to see \nor hear what was happening in an already chaotic environment. Philip was \nfortunate to have escaped the crowd without significant physical injury, although \nPhilip was left dizzy, nauseous, lethargic, and dazed from the exposure to tear gas \nand overall experience. \n55.  Philip was not so fortunate on other occasions. On June 19, 2020, for \nexample, Philip, like many others, attended a protest at the Multnomah County \nJustice Center in downtown Portland. That evening, as on other occasions, PPB \nofficers shot tear gas canisters and flashbang grenades indiscriminately into the \ncrowd. \n56.  No accessible warnings were ever given to persons with disabilities. \nPhilip perceived that officers began to fire out of nowhere, and then Philip felt a \nsharp, searing pain as a flashbang grenade hit Philip in the back. Officers shouted \nat protesters as they continued to fire indiscriminately into the crowd and strike \nprotesters with batons, even as the crowd began to disperse. Without effective \ncommunication, Philip was unable to understand what the officers were saying. It \nfelt like a war zone to Philip. \n57.  On July 22, 2020, after federal agents established a presence in the \nCity, Philip attended a rally a few blocks away from the Justice Center and, later \non, another event happening on Fourth Avenue. Philip observed PPB officers and \nPage 29 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 30 of 65\n     \n \nfederal agents work in tandem to disperse the large group with both agencies firing \ntear gas and flashbang grenades into the crowd. \n58.  Because warnings and dispersal orders were again provided only \norally, Philip was unable to independently understand or comply with the demands \nof law enforcement. Philip brought an interpreter that evening, who informed Philip \nthat the authorities gave an oral warning that the event was becoming unlawful. \nHowever, PPB and federal agents did not give Philip sufficient time to disperse \nbefore using force, and Philip could not avoid exposure to the tear gas, coughed and \nbecame dizzy. A friend who is Deaf/blind and who accompanied Philip that evening \nwas terrified. \n59.  Additionally, like other Deaf or hard of hearing protesters, Philip must \nbe extremely careful that the police do not misperceive a lack of response from \nPhilip as non-compliance, which can result in use of force that is unnecessary, \nviolent, and possibly deadly.  \n60.  For example, Magdiel Sanchez, a deaf man, was shot and killed by \npolice in Oklahoma City in September 2017, when Mr. Sanchez failed to comply \nwith officers’ verbal orders that he could not understand.28 \n61.  Similarly, like other Deaf or hard of hearing protesters, Philip must be \nextremely careful when using sign language, which to an untrained officer could be \n \n28 Ken Miller & Tim Talley, Police Chief: ‘A Lot of Concerns’ After Shooting of Deaf \nMan, ASSOCIATED PRESS (September 21, 2017), \nhttps://apnews.com/article/1850623653aa4658a49281f5d6685922.  \nPage 30 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 31 of 65\n     \n \nmisinterpreted as non-compliance or even a threatening gesture, which can result \nin the use of force that is unnecessary, violent, and possibly deadly.  \n62.  For example, during the Summer of 2020, Philip was put in fear of \nPhilip’s own life when attending a protest at the ICE building. Philip brought an \ninterpreter to the protest and approached the officers to inform them that Philip \nwas Deaf and needed an accommodation. In response, officers surrounded Philip, \nseparated Philip from the interpreter, and aimed their weapons at Philip’s chest. \nPhilip was afraid to use sign language to communicate with officers because any \nmiscommunication between Philip and the officers could have resulted in Philip \nbeing shot. It was only after Philip’s interpreter was able to carefully navigate the \ndynamic and explain to officers that Philip was Deaf that the officers lowered their \nweapons. \n63.  Similarly, during the Summer of 2020, Philip witnessed a PPB officer \npointing a gun in Philip’s direction. When Philip attempted to wave to obtain the \nofficer’s attention, the officer continued pointing the gun at Philip. Only by \nproviding the officer a message via phone explaining Philip is Deaf did the officer \nbegin communicating with Philip.  \n64.  It is not uncommon for officers to misinterpret sign language as a \nthreat. For example, in February 2013, Jonathan Meister was severely beaten by \nPage 31 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 32 of 65\n     \n \npolice in Hawthorne, California, after officers misinterpreted his use of ASL as \nthreatening behavior.29  \n65.  When Philip articulated concerns about accessibility to PPB officers, \nthe officers told Philip not to attend protests because the inaccessibility made it \nunsafe. As discussed below, Philip brought those concerns directly to Mayor Ted \nWheeler, who also failed to make reasonable accommodations available. \n66.  PPB’s use of tear gas on Philip could and should have been avoided \nthrough effective communication. Philip has had recurring headaches and other \nmedical complications since mid-August because of the tear gas. Philip’s existing \nPTSD has been exacerbated as a result of the war zone-like environment and Philip \nhas experienced severe anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, hypervigilance, night terrors, \nand other symptoms. \n67.  In spite of all that, Philip has continued to engage in protest \nthroughout 2021, attending many marches and rallies for racial justice and other \nsocial justice issues that were smaller community events that were unlikely to draw \na significant police presence.  For example, on March 13, 2021, Philip attended a \nrally in downtown Portland to honor Breonna Taylor. As another example, on \nMarch 20, 2021, Philip attended an organized event to protest violence against the \nAsian community.  \n \n29 Hawthorne Police Accused of Beating Deaf Man, NBC LOS ANGELES (Feb. 18, \n2014), https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/lawsuit-hawthorne-police-\nallegedly-beat-deaf-man/2089920/.  \nPage 32 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 33 of 65\n     \n \n68.  Philip has regularly attended marches to protest PPB’s killing of \nPatrick Kimmons on September 30, 2018. Those protests are organized by \nKimmons’ mother, with support from local racial justice groups, and have been held \nweekly on Thursdays and Sundays over the last two years. During 2021, Philip has \nregularly attended these marches, which are peaceful events that usually draw no \npolice response or only a limited police presence. \n69.  Over the last several months, Philip has specifically avoided large \nprotests where police are more likely to be present and use crowd control measures, \nincluding force. Without effective communication or accommodations, Philip is \ndeterred from attending larger protest events or demonstrations in certain locations \nin Portland that are more likely to draw a significant presence and response from \nDefendants. In Philip’s experience, protests with a significant presence from PPB or \nSheriffs are unsafe for persons with disabilities, given that Defendants do not have \nproper policies, practices, or officer training to accommodate persons with \ndisabilities and provide effective communication. Defendants’ have meaningfully \ncurtailed Philip’s engagement in First Amendment activity. \n70.  For example, on April 11, 2021, Philip attended a public vigil for the \npolice killing of Daunte Wright that was held in Chapman Park. The crowd had \ngathered to peacefully to honor and pay respects to Daunte Wright and mourn his \npassing. Eventually, PPB arrived and Philip decided to leave because it would no \nlonger be safe to stay without effective communication or accommodations. \nPage 33 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 34 of 65\n     \n \n71.  Another example occurred on November 19, 2021, when Philip \nattended a protest in response to the Kyle Rittenhouse acquittal decision near the \nJustice Center. The crowd began to grow in size and, fearful that law enforcement \nwould show up, Philip left the protest earlier than initially intended. Instead of \nfeeling that Defendants’ presence at the protest would ensure public safety and \nallow people with disabilities to be able to continue peacefully engaging in First \nAmendment activity, Philip knew the police presence would increase the risk of \nbeing caught up in police violence without effective communication or \naccommodations. This turned out to be the right decision because, later that same \nevening, Defendants shoved a protester in a wheelchair, causing both her and her \nwheelchair to crash to the ground.  \n72.  Philip has attempted to meaningfully address PPB’s disability \ndiscrimination through the years. In 2012, Philip filed a lawsuit challenging PPB’s \nfailure to provide accommodations to people who are Deaf or hard of hearing when \nresponding to calls for service. When Philip reported a domestic violence situation \nand requested an interpreter, the police responded without an interpreter, refused \nto get one, spoke only to Philip’s partner, and, as a result, did nothing. \n73.  After the lawsuit settled, Philip served as a role player for the State’s \nDepartment of Public Safety Standards and Training (“DPSST”), attempting to \ntrain PPB officers on how to effectively work with and serve people who are Deaf or \nhard of hearing. During the six months Philip worked in that capacity, Philip saw \nfirsthand PPB’s resistance to change and to accommodating people with \nPage 34 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 35 of 65\n     \n \ndisabilities—a resistance that continues to this day and makes this lawsuit \nnecessary. \n74.  Philip intends to continue to engage in peaceful First Amendment \nprotest activity. But Philip has to choose carefully which protests to attend, taking \ninto account the protest’s location, time of day, anticipated size and social makeup \nof the crowd, along with other factors. In other words, Defendants have effectively \nplaced indefinite time, place, and manner restrictions on Philip’s participation in \nFirst Amendment–protected events, for no reason other than Defendants’ own \nfailure to fulfill their legal obligations under the ADA and Section 504 to adopt and \nimplement proper policies, procedures, and officer training for interactions with \npersons with disabilities, accommodations, and effective communication. \nDefendants pose a threat to Deaf and hard of hearing peaceful protesters, like \nPhilip, instead of providing for greater public safety in protected First Amendment \nactivity. In fact, Defendants have basically offloaded their legal requirements onto \nPhilip, shifting the burden to Philip to accommodate officers’ lack of any modicum of \nunderstanding for how to interact with Deaf or hard of hearing people—by \nobserving when officers seem spooked by Philip using ASL and de-escalating that \ntension immediately, or by being hypervigilant in finding ways to communicate with \nofficers in a way the officers will both understand and interpret as nonthreatening. \nYet, Defendants still find ways to hurt Philip and exclude Philip from peacefully \nparticipating in demonstrations. \nPage 35 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 36 of 65\n     \n \nDefendants Fail to Provide Effective Communication and Reasonable \nAccommodations to People who are Blind or Low Vision \n75.  Defendants discriminate against people who are blind or low vision at \nprotests, including by subjecting them to excessive force and by failing to provide \nclear and consistent directions, such as orders to disperse, with sufficient \nopportunity to comply. \n76.  Plaintiff Katie Durden reads Braille, uses a screen reader, and \nprimarily relies on their service dog Betsy to assist with navigation. Katie is \nconcerned that Betsy would be injured by law enforcement if they brought her to a \nprotest. When they attend protests, Katie therefore relies on their cane and one or \nmore sighted guides, i.e., a sighted individual who can safely lead them through \ncrowds and over uneven ground. \n77.  A sighted guide can be used by individuals who are blind or visually \nimpaired, to help them travel safely in any environment. Using a sighted guide \nallows individuals who are blind or low-vision a comfortable way to travel safely in \nany environment. The sighted guide technique can be the most efficient way for a \nperson who is blind or low-vision to travel with a sighted person.30 \n78.  Generally, if Katie needs a sighted guide at all (apart from Betsy), they \nneed just one to assist them through crowds or other unusual circumstances. But \nKatie had observed how Defendants were responding to the protests—and in \n \n30 Mark Wilkinson, OD, FAAO, Guiding the Blind or Visually Impaired: Techniques \nfor Sighted Guides, UNIVERSITY OF IOWA CARVER COLLEGE OF MEDICINE \nEYEROUNDS.ORG (March 14, 2017),  \nhttps://webeye.ophth.uiowa.edu/eyeforum/tutorials/sighted-guide-technique.htm. \nPage 36 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 37 of 65\n     \n \nparticular, how they were treating people with disabilities at the protests—they \nsought additional sighted guides for their safety. There has been no other situation \nwhere Katie felt it was necessary to have more than one sighted guide. \n79.  Since August of 2020, Plaintiff Jackson (“Jack”) Tudela has served as \nKatie’s primary sighted guide at protests—or, as Katie affectionately has \nnicknamed their cohort of sighted guides, “eyeballs.” As Katie’s primary “eyeball,” \nJack links arms with Katie on their left side, and through spoken communication \nand nonverbal cues through their linked arms, helps Katie navigate safely through \nthe crowd and around obstacles, as well as providing them with directions and \ninformation necessary to comply with police orders. As a sighted guide, Jack’s \nprimary responsibility, behind ensuring Katie’s safety, is to narrate the scene \nenough so that Katie has the information they need to exercise their own autonomy \nin deciding where to go.  \n80.  Katie is an independent journalist and attends protests with sound \nrecording equipment to develop 360° binaural audio recordings that they then edit \nand publish on Soundcloud and share on Twitter under the moniker “Paradoxical \nMedia.”31 When attending a protest as a member of the press, Katie wears a press \nbadge and a helmet with “PRESS” emblazoned across the front and back in big \nreflective stickers that are visible (to the sighted officers) from all angles. Along \nwith their role as a sighted guide, Jack also assists Katie with their journalism \n \n31 Paradoxical Media’s Twitter profile, which has links to the referenced audio \ncoverage, as well as updates and commentary on issues relating to accessibility, can \nbe accessed here: https://twitter.com/Paradoxical9999?s=20. \nPage 37 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 38 of 65\n     \n \nwork by describing for Katie the different “mini scenes”—drummers, chanters, \nspeakers, police lines, and the like—that Katie might want to capture a little more \nclosely with their recording equipment. Jack also takes photos and videos to \nsupplement Katie’s audio recordings. \n81.  On Friday, July 24, 2020, Katie attended a nighttime march with \nJacob Hanning, another journalist who also served as Katie’s sighted guide for the \nevening. Katie and Jacob both wore full-face gas masks and helmets. Jacob’s helmet also \nhad the word “PRESS” written on it in block letters. As an independent journalist, Jacob \nwas live streaming the events of the evening on Periscope. \n82.  During the course of the evening, Katie and Jacob were tear-gassed \nseveral times, but thanks to their gas masks, they suffered only minor irritation. \n83.  Katie and Jacob spent the majority of the evening near the fence \nsurrounding the Justice Center. At no point were Katie and Jacob within fifteen feet \nof the fence. PPB, the Sheriffs, and other law enforcement agencies were stationed \non the other side of the fence firing tear gas and flashbangs into the crowd. \n84.  At approximately 1:58 am, Katie and Jacob were standing around \nthirty feet from the fence while Jacob filmed the protesters standing between them \nand the fence. They were standing still, and Katie had their cane visible in front of \nthem. \n85.  Katie and Jacob heard a series of loud pops and felt several objects hit \nthem hard in the side and legs. Jacob led Katie away from the area as quickly as he \ncould, and they moved to the next street corner. Once there, they examined their \nPage 38 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 39 of 65\n     \n \nclothing and realized that they had been shot with “pepper balls” – paintball-sized \npellets filled with oleoresin capsicum (OC), the same substance as pepper spray. The \nimpacts were hard enough to leave a large welt just below Katie’s hip. \n86.  On August 6, 2020, Katie was attending another nighttime protest \nwith their cane and sighted guides, this time in Southeast Portland. PPB declared \nan unlawful assembly within fifteen minutes of their arrival and quickly declared \nthe assembly a riot shortly thereafter. \n87.  PPB bull rushed the protesters, shoving them and hitting them with \ntheir batons to drive them in a chosen direction while yelling at them to run. \n88.  Katie, led by their sighted guides, was moving as fast as they could, \nbut was shoved in the back by the police, lost their balance, and skidded on their \nknees. \n89.  To get away from the crush of people, Katie’s guides led them up a \nflight of stairs. It was narrow enough that they had to move single-file; without \ntheir guides to help them, Katie ran face-first into a metal pole. \n90.  Katie has suffered occasional knee pain since the incident on August 6, \n2020. \n91.  On August 7, 2020, Katie attended a nighttime protest outside the \nPenumbra Kelly Building in Southeast Portland, together with three sighted guides. \n92.  After approximately three hours, PPB declared an unlawful assembly. \nAt around 12:30 a.m., the police bull rushed the protesters. Police shoved Katie \nwhile yelling at them to move. Only after Katie identified themself as a member of \nPage 39 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 40 of 65\n     \n \nthe press and informed the police that they were being recorded did officers stop \nactively pushing them. \n93.  At the same time as the bull rush, officers using the LRAD orally \ninstructed protesters to disperse to the East. Over the next twenty minutes, the \nLRAD instructions changed several times. Protesters were instructed to disperse to \nthe East, then to the East or South, then solely to the South, and then finally to the \nWest, but in no event were protesters to enter private property or they would be \narrested. Even the officers making the announcements seemed confused about the \ndirections they were providing.32 \n94.  In addition to the changing LRAD directions, officers also deployed \nmultiple flashbang grenades as well as some form of chemical irritant, possibly OC. \nThe feeling of having no escape route and the chaos of this night affected Katie’s \nmental health greatly. \n95.  On September 18, 2020, Katie attended a nighttime protest in  with \nPlaintiff Jack and another sighted guide. Between 200 and 300 protesters were \ngathered approximately two blocks from the ICE detention facility near the \nSouthwest Waterfront to protest the forced sterilization of women in ICE custody. \n96.  Katie normally wears a full-face gas mask to protests. On this \nparticular night, however, they had traded masks with a sighted guide whose \ngoggles were broken. Katie was left with only a respirator and very little eye \n \n32 Katie’s recording of that is here: https://soundcloud.com/user-426859291/dispurse-\nwhich-way-dj-lrad.  \nPage 40 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 41 of 65\n     \n \nprotection. Katie believed that because of the ban on CS gas that Mayor Wheeler \nhad issued on September 10, 2020, the chances of tear gas exposure were lower \nthan they had been previously. \n97.  When Katie, Jack, and the other guides arrived at the protest, federal \nagents were in a riot line in front of the protesters. Federal agents attempted to \npush the crowd back several times without significant success. \n98.  While federal agents formed a riot line to the South, PPB officers \narrived, declared an unlawful assembly, and swept from the West to the North, \nblocking egress for protesters in multiple directions. \n99.  Mayor Wheeler’s ban on CS gas applies only to PPB and not to federal \nagencies. Thus, federal agents were free to use tear gas to disperse the crowd, and \nthey did so vigorously, firing numerous canisters of tear gas into the crowd along \nwith hundreds of rounds of pepper balls and other munitions. \n100.  Interspersed with the tear gas canisters were numerous flashbangs. \nOne of these flashbangs went off so close to Katie that they saw the flash with their \nlimited vision through closed eyes and they felt acute pain and ringing in their ears. \n101.  As federal agents blocked their path from the South and PPB pushed \nin from the North and West, officers from different agencies ordered Katie to \ndisperse in opposing directions. \n102.  Katie’s air was saturated with tear gas and OC powder, and it was \nnearly impossible to escape the protest area without being affected. The tear gas \nand pepper spray caused Katie significant discomfort and pain. Katie had their eyes \nPage 41 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 42 of 65\n     \n \nrinsed three times that night, only to be re-affected by tear gas and OC powder each \ntime. \n103.  Dispersal orders and excessive force are often disorienting for Katie, \nwho cannot read street signs without assistance. Katie, like many blind people, \nnavigates primarily using cardinal directions such as north, south, east, or west. \nCardinal directions, however, are not useful to Katie after they become disoriented \nby law enforcement’s use of force so quickly after dispersal orders are given. \n104.  On Saturday, September 26, 2020, Katie attended a daytime “Proud \nBoys” rally to record speeches and a nighttime protest at the Justice Center. At both \nevents, Plaintiff Jack served as Katie’s primary sighted guide. Their friend Kevin \nCook served as an additional sighted guide at the nighttime protest. Katie also had \ntheir cane with them.  \n105.  Katie, Jack, and Kevin walked arm-in-arm through the nighttime \nprotest while Jack took video and Katie made audio recordings. Jack was wearing a \nyellow high-visibility jacket, and Katie wore their bright blue helmet labeled \n“Press.” Katie additionally was carrying their red and white reflective cane. \n106.  Around midnight, PPB declared an unlawful assembly and law \nenforcement officers rushed the protesters. As the crowd moved backwards with \ntheir hands up, police shoved people to the ground and beat them with batons. The \nretreat became a stampede as people tried to escape the police. \n107.  Plaintiffs are informed, believe, and thereupon allege that law \nenforcement officers from both PPB and the Sheriffs were present as a unified \nPage 42 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 43 of 65\n     \n \ncommand and actively policing the demonstration and engaged in crowd control \nprocedures. \n108.  Katie, Jack, and Kevin were caught in the crowd moving backwards. \nKatie and Jack repeatedly and loudly stated that Katie was blind and a member of \nthe press. As Jack and Kevin turned around to help move Katie backwards, \nDefendants’ officers shoved them, knocking all three of them to the ground. \n109.  Plaintiffs Katie and Jack are informed, believe, and thereupon allege \nthat Defendants targeted them precisely because they were working together as \npaired blind person and sighted guide, including but not limited to walking with \nlinked arms, which is a typical method for a sighted guide to assist someone who is \nblind or low vision in navigating. \n110.  Defendants’ officers surrounded Jack, who was unable to quickly get \nup after being shoved to the ground, and proceeded to violently arrest Jack. The \narresting Sheriff’s deputy grabbed Jack by the hair and slammed their face into the \nground, which busted their lip. Additionally, the arresting Sheriff’s deputy, along \nwith other of Defendants’ officers, lifted Jack by their arm with a bad shoulder in a \nstress position and slammed Jack against a vehicle so hard that the car alarm went \noff. As all of this was happening, Jack repeated, with an increasing sense of \nurgency, that they were serving as a sighted guide to a disabled member of the \npress. Police responded by ripping off the press pass hanging from Jack’s neck, \nmaking some kind of comment to the effect that Katie and Jack weren’t “real press.” \nPage 43 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 44 of 65\n     \n \n111.  While Jack was being arrested, other officers continued to strike Katie \nand Kevin with their batons. Through the limited vision in their left eye, Katie saw \nthe batons, which hit them in the helmet, chest, and shoulders. Jack was extremely \ndistressed to witness the police baton Katie and to not be able to do anything to \nassist them. Kevin eventually was able to drag Katie away to prevent them from \nbeing injured, and Katie heard Jack screaming their name as they were separated.  \n112.  Jack was stressed and distraught that in being arrested, they had been \nseparated from Katie. No longer fulfilling their role as Katie’s sighted guide, Jack \nwas worried for Katie’s safety. \n113.  Katie has relied on Jack as their primary sighted guide since August \n2020, and the two have grown close and now share a life together as romantic and \nlife partners. Thus, Jack’s arrest was traumatic for Katie on multiple levels.  \n114.  After being separated from Jack, Kevin and Katie escaped the \nstampede and were able to locate a group of their friends. Katie and the group of \nfriends waited for Jack to be released from custody at 5:00 am. When their personal \neffects were returned to Jack, everything, including all of Jack and Katie’s \nelectronic recording equipment, had been destroyed. \n115.  Plaintiffs Katie and Jack are informed, believe, and thereupon allege \nthat Jack was targeted for arrest due to their actions as a sighted guide to assist \nKatie. As of November 29, 2021, the District Attorney voluntarily summarily \ndismissed all charges that were pending against Jack. \nPage 44 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 45 of 65\n     \n \n116.  Katie suffered numerous physical injuries from her experiences at the \nPortland protests, including heavy bruising and pain across their body. \n117.  Repeated exposure to physical violence at the hands of law \nenforcement has taken a severe emotional toll on Katie. Katie’s therapist of eight \nyears indicates that they are displaying symptoms of active trauma and PTSD: they \nare barely sleeping, has persistent nightmares, hypervigilance, and experiences \nbrief but repeated dissociative episodes.  \n118.  As a result of the repeated exposure to physical violence at the hands \nof law enforcement, Katie has had to receive treatment from a specialized therapist \nfrom January 2021 to present. \n119.  Katie’s job and classwork have suffered because they have found it \nincreasingly difficult to concentrate. Katie was forced to withdraw from classes and \nput their education on hold to concentrate on their mental health. Similarly, Katie \nhad to take a month's worth of FMLA leave at their job and now can only work a \nreduced number of hours.  \n120.  This experience has also caused Jack severe psychological harm and \ntrauma. For over a year, before all charges were summarily dismissed, Jack was \nseverely restricted in their ability to make basic life changes, such as switching \nemployment or residences, resulting in a great financial stress and struggle. As a \nresult of being arrested and beaten by Defendants’ officers, while at the same time \nwatching their blind partner be beaten by Defendants’ officers, Jack is fearful of law \nenforcement and now avoids attending any protest.  \nPage 45 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 46 of 65\n     \n \n121.  As a result of the Defendants’ discriminatory and violent treatment of \nKatie and Jack, they are both deterred from attending protests. Without proper \npolicies, procedures, and officer training in place to ensure that officers do not \ntarget persons with disabilities and their assistants and provide accommodations \nand modified policies to ensure that persons with disabilities have an equal \nopportunity to comply with police orders and public safety measures, Katie and \nJack will continue to be deterred from engaging in protest activity for fear of being \nsubjected to additional unwarranted violence and baseless criminal charges. Their \nFirst Amendment rights to engage in peaceful protest have been chilled. \nDefendants Are Aware of the Need to Provide Reasonable \nAccommodations and Effective Communication But Refuse to Do So \n122.   The ADA and Rehabilitation Act have required for more than 30 years \nthat public entities and recipients of federal funding, such as Defendants, ensure \nthat their programs and services are accessible to persons with disabilities and \nprovide equal benefits, services and advantages to persons with disabilities as those \nprovided to persons without disabilities. The ADA and Rehabilitation Act both \nrequire that public entities undertake a self-evaluation of its policies, practices and \nprocedures to ensure program accessibility and compliance with these laws. 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.105; 28 C.F.R. § 42.505(c). Despite these requirements, Defendants have \nfailed for over 30 years to ensure that their services to ensure safe protests are \naccessible and provide equal benefit to protesters with disabilities. \nPage 46 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 47 of 65\n     \n \n123.  Plaintiffs Philip Wolfe and Katie Durden are people with disabilities \nand require reasonable modifications and effective communication at protests. \nDefendants have an affirmative obligation to make their programs and services \naccessible, including programs and services related to law enforcement. Failing to \nprovide accessible services related to law enforcement at protests effectively denies \nequal access to the City and County’s public spaces to exercise the right to protest \nand creates immeasurable dangers for people with disabilities. Defendants must \nprovide reasonable modifications and effective communication to protesters with \ndisabilities as a matter of course. \n124.  Additionally, Defendants must cease targeting persons with \ndisabilities and their assistants, including sighted guides, like Plaintiff Jack \nTudela, for use of unnecessary and unreasonable force, when they are merely \npeacefully protesting. To the extent Defendants’ officers erroneously perceive typical \nconduct by persons with disabilities (and their aides to accommodate the disability) \nas threatening or noncompliant with crowd control procedures, Defendants’ officers \nrequire policies, procedures, and training to recognize how to identify persons with \ndisabilities, their assistants, and behaviors they engage in as part of their \nexperience (using ASL, linking arms, carrying a cane, or the like) to ensure their \nsafety in protests. \n125.  The PPB has enacted policies to allow protesters without disabilities to \navoid harm by police officers. For example, PPB Directive 0635.10, entitled “Crowd \nPage 47 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 48 of 65\n     \n \n33 \nManagement/Crowd Control,” provides that when feasible, police should make \n“loud, intelligible and consistent announcements and warnings to the crowd […] to \nallow the crowd time to comply with orders given from police members.” Before \ntaking action to disperse a crowd, the police should order the crowd to disperse, and \nshould only use riot control agents (such as teargas) “when avenues of escape (i.e., \nclear path or route) are available to the crowd.” Police can detain protesters after \n“providing a lawful order to disperse followed by a reasonable opportunity to comply \nwith that order.” \n126.  Additionally, recently enacted Oregon House Bill 2928 regulates the \nuse of sound devices by law enforcement agencies.34 Specifically, Section 2(2)(c) \nstates: “Whenever possible, a law enforcement agency shall provide announcements \nfor purposes of crowd control both audibility and visually.” This provision fails to \nprotect Plaintiffs’ rights under the ADA and Section 504, because both require more \nthan just audible and visual communication. Both the ADA and Section 504 require \neffective communication, which, in the context of orders of dispersal, requires \ncommunication in multiple formats discernible by all persons, more than merely an \nannouncement from a sound truck or a social media post. \n \n33 https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/649358. According to the \nwebsite, this Directive is \"currently under review.” Plaintiffs will pay attention \nto any changes made in the future. \n34 HB 2928 (2021), has not yet been included in the Oregon Revised Statutes. A copy \nof the bill as enrolled is available here: \nhttps://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2021R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB2928/\nEnrolled.   \nPage 48 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 49 of 65\n     \n \n127.  Moreover, Section 2(3)(c) states that law enforcement “shall take \nreasonable action to accommodate disabilities when issuing or enforcing orders to \ndisperse,” yet no regulations or guidance have been provided as to what a \nreasonable accommodation is, leaving the decision as to how to interact with \nPlaintiffs and others with disabilities entirely up to the untrained responding \nofficers. Without any additional guidance, HB 2928 falls short of the protections \nguaranteed by the ADA and Section 504 and is, therefore, insufficient to protect the \nrights of protesters with disabilities.   \n128.  Plaintiffs are informed, believe, and thereupon allege that Defendants \nhave not enacted any similar policies, procedures, or training to provide protesters \nwith disabilities an equal opportunity to avoid harm by police officers.  Plaintiffs are \nfurther informed, believe, and thereupon allege that there are no directives \nrequiring sign language interpreters (or interpretive technology) to communicate \ndispersal warnings or other orders, providing people with mobility disabilities an \naccessible route to escape teargas, or otherwise providing modifications to ensure \nthat people with disabilities have a reasonable opportunity to comply with dispersal \norders.  \n129.  Before filing suit, Plaintiffs and others have repeatedly notified \nDefendants that they have an obligation to provide modifications and make law \nenforcement actions at protests accessible to people with disabilities. \n130.  Defendants have been notified of the need for modifications by \nnumerous people on a variety of social media platforms, including Twitter, \nPage 49 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 50 of 65\n     \n \nFacebook, and Instagram, through messages and posts directed at or tagging the \nagencies or their officials.  In response, Defendants did nothing. \n131.  In addition to the efforts of individual Plaintiffs and other community \nmembers, Disability Rights Oregon (DRO), the federally funded not-for-profit \norganization that provides advocacy and assistance to Oregonians with disabilities,  \nsent letters detailing the need for accommodations to PPB Police Chief PPB Chuck \nLovell, Portland Mayor and PPB Police Commissioner Ted Wheeler, the City of \nPortland’s ADA coordinator, Multnomah County Sheriff Michael Reese, the U.S. \nAttorney for the District of Oregon, the Superintendent of the Oregon State Police \nTravis Hampton, and Acting Secretary for the U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity Chad Wolfe between July and September of 2020.  \n132.   DRO’s letters explained the issues that impact people who use service \ndogs, are Deaf or hard of hearing, are blind or low vision, have asthma, mobility-\nbased disabilities, and epilepsy, and who have inflammatory conditions.  The letters \nexplicitly requested reasonable accommodations and modifications of tactics on \nbehalf of protesters with disabilities.    \n133.   To date, only PPB and the City have responded to those letters. On \nSeptember 17, 2020, during discussions with DRO and Plaintiffs’ counsel, PPB and \nthe City acknowledged that they do not have any policies governing police \ninteractions with protesters with disabilities.  \n134.  On October 8, 2020, via email communication, the City stated that it \ncould not provide ASL interpreters onsite at demonstrations to communicate PPB \nPage 50 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 51 of 65\n     \n \ninstructions to Deaf and hard of hearing protesters. No other options or technologies \nwere either offered or discussed.  \n135.  On October 14, 2020, PPB informed Plaintiffs’ counsel that the City \nwould not provide any concrete steps, plans, or timelines to ensure that protesters \nwith disabilities are afforded their constitutional rights and to prevent undue force \nand discrimination against them.  Indeed, PPB made clear that any potential steps \nthey could take would be subject to a lengthy bureaucratic approval process that \ncould take weeks or even months.     \n136.  In response to the various efforts, previous notifications, and requests, \nand this lawsuit, Defendants have done little to nothing beyond setting up a Twitter \naccount that inconsistently announces police actions at certain protest events. \n137.  Rather than showing any inclination to self-review, contract with \ndisability experts, and provide reasonable accommodations to -- or respect the \nconstitutional rights of -- people with disabilities, the prevailing sentiment from \nDefendants has been that protesting is only for people who do not have disabilities.   \n138.  The City and County have coordinated their response to the protests \nwith each other. Each Defendant has individually and jointly failed to provide \nreasonable accommodations to protesters with disabilities. Neither PPB nor the \nCounty communicate reasonably accessible notice to protesters who are Deaf or \nhard of hearing before using force or making arrests. Neither PPB nor the County \nappropriately restrict the use of tear gas, bull rush charges, strobes, or other force \nagainst protesters with disabilities.  After DRO submitted requests for \nPage 51 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 52 of 65\n     \n \naccommodation to the agencies, neither PPB nor the County adopted reasonable \naccommodations that would adequately provide equal access to protesters with \ndisabilities. \nFirst Claim for Relief \n(Violation of Title II of the ADA) \n42 U.S.C. §§ 12131 et seq. \nAgainst All Defendants \n139.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each of the allegations \nin all other paragraphs of this Complaint as fully set forth here. \n140.  Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations provide that “no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded \nfrom participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or \nactivities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 12132; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130. Title II’s requirements extend to “anything a \npublic entity does,” including arrests and other law enforcement interactions. 28 \nC.F.R. § 35, app. B. Despite these requirements, Defendants violate the ADA and its \nimplementing regulations in multiple ways. \n141.  Both PPB and the County have an affirmative obligation to make \nbenefits, services, and programs accessible to people with disabilities, including \nmaking reasonable modifications in policies, practices or procedures when the \nmodification are necessary to avoid discrimination of the basis of disability. 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7)(i). “The general regulatory obligation to modify policies, \nPage 52 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 53 of 65\n     \n \npractices, or procedures requires law enforcement to make changes in policies that \nresult in discriminatory arrests or abuse of individuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. \npt. 35, app. B. Defendants, however, have failed to make reasonable modifications \nthat will make law enforcement’s actions equally accessible to people with \ndisabilities; indeed, their responses to protests actively deny people with disabilities \ntheir rights at protests. \n142.  The obligation to provide reasonable modifications requires covered \nentities to provide effective communication to people with communication \ndisabilities. 28 C.F.R. § 35.160. \n143.  Additionally, the ADA and it’s implementing regulations prohibit \nDefendants from: \na.  Denying a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to \nparticipate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service (28 C.F.R. § \n35.130(b)(1)(i)); \nb.  Affording a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity to \nparticipate in or benefit from the aid, service, or benefit that is not \nequal to that afforded others (28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(ii)); \nc.  Providing a qualified individual with a disability with an aid, benefit, \nor service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to \nobtain the same result to gain the same benefit as that provided to \nothers (28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(iii)); \nPage 53 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 54 of 65\n     \n \nd.  Aiding or perpetuating discrimination against a qualified individual \nwith a disability by providing significant assistance to an agency, \norganization, or person that discriminates on the basis of disability in \nproviding any aid, benefit, or services to beneficiaries of the public \nentity’s program (28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(v)); \ne.  Utilizing criteria or methods of administration that have the effect of \nsubjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination of \nthe basis of disability, or that have the purpose or effect of defeating or \nsubstantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the public \nentity’s program with respect to individuals with disabilities (28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.130(b)(3)(i) and (ii)); or \nf.  Otherwise limiting a qualified individual with a disability in the \nenjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by \nothers receiving the aid, benefit, or service of a public entity (28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.130(b)(1)(vii)); \n144.  The ADA further prohibits exclusion or denial of equal services, \nprograms, or activities to an individual because of the known disability of an \nindividuals with whom the individual is known to have a relationship or \nassociation. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(g). \n145.  Defendants fail to provide reasonable modifications, including effective \ncommunication, for people with disabilities at protests.  For Philip and others who \nare Deaf or hard of hearing, for example, Defendants have failed to take \nPage 54 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 55 of 65\n     \n \n“appropriate steps to ensure that communications with . . . participants, members of \nthe public, and companions with disabilities are as effective as communications \nwith others.” § 35.160(a)(1). To that end, Defendants are required to “furnish \nappropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to afford individuals with \ndisabilities . . . an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a \nservice, program, or activity of a public entity.”  § 35.160(b)(1). \n146.  Defendants make no efforts whatsoever to communicate with \nprotesters who are Deaf or hard of hearing, including when they declare unlawful \nassemblies and riots and issue orders to disperse. In the same way, Defendants \ndiscriminate against Plaintiffs by communicating about their activities at protests \nonly to protesters who are hearing persons. Defendants’ use of bull rushes and other \nforms of force violate the rights of people with a variety of disabilities, including \nthose with mobility disabilities and those who are blind or low vision. Unlike people \nwithout disabilities, Plaintiffs are unable to disperse quickly or respond in the same \nway to other police commands, putting them at significant risk of violence from \nDefendants. Use of force by Defendants also has a disproportionate effect on people \nwith disabilities, many of whom heal more slowly and are more susceptible to long-\nterm damage. \n147.  Defendants’ use of flashbang grenades, tear gas, and other riot control \nagents, and their separation of people from their service animals or sighted guides, \ndenies people who use service animals or guides the equal opportunity to participate \nin protests by restricting their ability to attend protests with needed assistance. \nPage 55 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 56 of 65\n     \n \n148.  The lack of clear egress routes for dispersal, and barriers to egress \nerected by Defendants, violate the rights of people with disabilities who are forced \nto risk stampedes and trampling from other protesters, law enforcement force, and \nother grievous harm. \n149.  The lack of clear and consistent directions likewise puts Plaintiffs, \nincluding those who are blind and low vision, at significant risk of harm, arrest, and \nviolence. \n150.  Defendants subject Plaintiffs to use of force and arrest because they \nmistake Plaintiffs’ inaction, delayed action, or slowed action in response to orders to \ndisperse and other commands as a refusal to comply. \n151.  Further, Defendants’ crowd management directives and other \nmeasures constitute programs and/or activities under the ADA. By failing to \nestablish crowd management measures that permit protesters with disabilities an \nopportunity to avoid harm by police, Defendants have denied those people with \ndisabilities meaningful access to their crowd management program/activity. \n152.  Reasonable modifications and effective communication measures are \nreadily available.  For communications with Deaf or hard of hearing protesters, for \nexample, ASL interpreters and visual messaging systems of the sort already used \non the roadside to communicate closed exits could be effectively employed to notify \nprotesters who are Deaf or hard of hearing when an unlawful assembly is declared. \nReasonable modifications might also include ceasing the use of certain less-lethal \nweapons and tactics entirely, using them only in circumstances designed to \nPage 56 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 57 of 65\n     \n \nminimize risk to protesters with disabilities, or providing substantial verbal and \nvisual warning before using the less-lethal weapons and tactics.  Likewise, \nDefendants can identify and inform protesters of accessible avenues of egress before \nusing force or other tactics that may harm people with mobility disabilities. \n153.  Nor would the requested modifications require a fundamental \nalteration of Defendants’ programs and services.  For example, Defendants are \nalready constitutionally required to provide adequate notice and an opportunity to \ncomply before dispersing crowds; PPB’s own policies already require the same, yet \nthey have made no attempt to provide adequate and timely notice to people who are \nDeaf or hard of hearing, denying them the benefits of these policies. \n154.  As set forth above, Defendants have failed to satisfy their affirmative \nobligation to provide reasonable modifications and auxiliary aids and services that \nprovide equal access, with or without a specific request from a person with a \ndisability. Defendants have also failed to response to requests for modifications and \nauxiliary aids and services by individual Plaintiff. \n155.  Defendants’ failure to provide reasonable modifications and auxiliary \naids and services was (and continues to be) with deliberate indifference and reckless \ndisregard to the rights of people with disabilities. \n156.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C §§ 12133 and 12205, Plaintiffs are entitled to \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages and reasonable attorneys’ fees \nand costs. \n \n \nPage 57 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 58 of 65\n     \n \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act) \n29 U.S.C. §§ 794 et seq. \nAgainst All Defendants \n157.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each of the allegations \nin all other paragraphs of this Complaint as fully set forth here. \n158.  Section  504  and  its  implementing  regulations  provide  that  “[N]o \notherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or \nhis disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial \nassistance . . .” 29 U.S.C. § 794. Despite these requirements, Defendants violate \nSection 504 in multiple ways. \n159.  A “program or activity” means “all of the operations of a department, \nagency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or of a local \ngovernment, or the entity of such State or local government that distributes such \nassistance  and  each  such  department  or  agency  (and  each  other  State  or  local \ngovernment entity) to which the assistance is extended, in the case of assistance to a \nState or local government.”  29 U.S.C. 794(b)(1)(A), (B). \n160.  Section 504 regulations prohibit discrimination by a recipient of federal \nfunds by denying a qualified person with a disability the opportunity to participate \nin or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service.  28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(1)(i).35 \n \n35 References to the C.F.R. constitute examples of applicable regulations and are \nnon-exhaustive. \nPage 58 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 59 of 65\n     \n \n161.  Section 504 regulations prohibit discrimination by a recipient of federal \nfunds by affording a qualified person with a disability an opportunity to participate \nin and benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others.  \n28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(1)((ii). \n162.  Section 504 regulations prohibit discrimination by a recipient of federal \nfunds by affording a qualified person with a disability an opportunity to participate \nin and benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording the \nopportunity to obtain the same result or to gain the same benefit as that provided to \nothers. 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(1)(iii). \n163.  Section 504 regulations prohibit aiding or perpetuating discrimination \nby a recipient of federal funds by providing significant assistance to an agency, \norganization, or person that discriminates on the basis of disability in providing any \naid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the recipients’ program or activity. 28 C.F.R. \n§ 41.51(b)(1)(v). \n164.  Section 504 regulations prohibit otherwise limiting a qualified person \nwith a disability in the enjoyment or any rights, privilege, advantage, or opportunity \nenjoyed by others receiving the aid, benefit, or service. 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(1)(vii). \n165.  Section 504 regulations prohibit discrimination by a recipient of federal \nfunds  by  utilizing  criteria  or  methods  of  administration  that  have  the  effect  of \nsubjecting  qualified  persons  with  disabilities  to  discrimination  on  the  basis  of \ndisability or have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the \naccomplishment of the objectives of the recipient’s programs with respect to persons \nPage 59 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 60 of 65\n     \n \nwith disabilities. 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3)(i) and (ii). \n166.  Section  504  regulations  require  that  recipients  of  federal  financial \nassistance “shall take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with their . . . \nbeneficiaries  are  available  to  persons  with  impaired  vision  and  hearing.” \n28 C.F.R. § 41.51(e). \n167.  Plaintiffs Philip Wolfe and Katie Durden are otherwise qualified to \nparticipate in the services, programs, or activities that are provided to individuals by \nDefendants.  29 U.S.C. § 794(b). \n168.  Plaintiff Jack Tudela is subject to the protections of Section 504 by \nvirtue of their association with a person with a disability, as Katie Durden’s sighted \nguide. 29 U.S.C. § 794a(a)(2). \n169.  Defendants receive federal assistance.  \n170.  Defendants make no efforts whatsoever to communicate with protesters \nwho are Deaf or hard of hearing, including when they declare unlawful assemblies \nand riots and issue orders to disperse. In the same way, Defendants discriminate \nagainst  Plaintiffs  by  communicating  about  their  activities  at  protests  only  to \nprotesters who are hearing persons. Defendants’ use of bull rushes and other forms \nof force violate the rights of people with a variety of disabilities, including those with \nmobility disabilities and those who are blind or low vision. Unlike people without \ndisabilities, Plaintiffs are unable to disperse quickly or respond in the same way to \nother police commands, putting them at significant risk of violence from Defendants. \nUse  of  force  by  Defendants  also  has  a  disproportionate  effect  on  people  with \nPage 60 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 61 of 65\n     \n \ndisabilities, many of whom heal more slowly and are more susceptible to long-term \ndamage. \n171.  Through the acts and omissions described above, Defendants and their \nagents and employees have and continue to violate the Rehabilitation Act and the \nregulations promulgated thereunder by excluding Plaintiffs from participation in, \ndenying Plaintiffs the benefits of, and subjecting Plaintiffs based solely by reason of \ntheir disability to, discrimination in Defendants’ services and activities in managing \nand regulating protests in Portland. \n172.  Defendants’ use of flashbang grenades, tear gas, and other riot control \nagents, and their separation of people from their service animals, denies people who \nuse service animals the equal opportunity to participate in protests by restricting \ntheir ability to attend protests with their animals. \n173.  Defendants’ use of teargas, pepper balls, and other chemical irritants \nposes a significant risk of harm or death for people with respiratory and inflammatory \nconditions. \n174.  The lack of clear egress routes for dispersal, and barriers to egress \nerected by Defendants, violate the rights of people with disabilities who are forced to \nrisk stampedes and trampling from other protesters, law enforcement force, and other \ngrievous harm. \n175.  The  lack  of  clear  and  consistent  directions  likewise  puts  Plaintiffs, \nincluding those who are blind and low vision, at significant risk of harm, arrest, and \nviolence. \nPage 61 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 62 of 65\n     \n \n176.  Defendants subject Plaintiffs to use of force and arrest because they \nmistake Plaintiffs’ inaction, delayed action, or slowed action in response to orders to \ndisperse and other commands as a refusal to comply. \n177.  Further, Defendants’ crowd management directives and other measures \nconstitute programs and/or activities. By failing to establish crowd management \nmeasures that permit protesters with disabilities an opportunity to avoid harm by \npolice, Defendants have denied those people with disabilities meaningful access to \ntheir crowd management program/activity. \n178.  Reasonable modifications and effective communication measures are \nreadily  available.  For  example,  Defendants  could  provide  additional  orienting \ninformation  on  how  to  comply  with  dispersal  orders  beyond  simple  cardinal \ndirections, training on identifying service dogs and sighted guides assisting a person \nwith a disability, changes in policy to allow sighted guides to physically assist people \nwho are Blind or low vision during protests without harassment, additional time for \npeople who are Blind or low vision to comply with orders of dispersal prior to using \nforce  or  issuing  arrests,  and  ceasing  the  use  of  flashbangs  or  other  non-lethal \nmunitions that result in disorientation. \n179.  Reasonable  accommodations  might  also  include  ceasing  the  use  of \ncertain less-lethal weapons and tactics entirely, using them only in circumstances \ndesigned to minimize risk to protesters with disabilities, or providing substantial \nverbal and visual warning before using the less-lethal weapons and tactics. Likewise, \nDefendants can identify and inform protesters of accessible avenues of egress before \nPage 62 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 63 of 65\n     \n \nusing force or other tactics that may harm people with mobility disabilities. \n180.  Nor would the requested modifications require a fundamental alteration \nof  Defendants’  programs  and  services.  For  example,  Defendants  are  already \nconstitutionally required to provide adequate notice and an opportunity to comply \nbefore dispersing crowds; PPB’s own policies already require the same, yet they have \nmade no attempt to provide adequate and timely notice to people who are blind, \ndenying them the benefits of these policies. \n181.  As set forth above, Defendants have failed to satisfy their affirmative \nobligation to provide reasonable modifications and auxiliary aids and services that \nprovide equal  access,  with  or  without  a  specific  request  from  a  person  with  a \ndisability.  \n182.  Defendants’ failure to provide reasonable modifications and auxiliary \naids and services was and continues to be with deliberate indifference and reckless \ndisregard for the rights of people with disabilities. \n183.  Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory and \ninjunctive relief as well as damages and reasonable attorney fees and costs.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for the following relief:  \n184.  A  declaration  that  Defendants’  alleged  conduct  has  violated  and \ncontinues to violate Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations, and Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act and its implementing regulations.  \nPage 63 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 64 of 65\n     \n \n185.  Preliminary and permanent orders enjoining Defendants, their agents, \nemployees, successors, and all other persons acting in active concert or participation \nwith Defendants from violating Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations, \nand Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and its implementing regulations.  The \norders shall mandate a comprehensive self-review utilizing disability accommodation \nexperts and consultants knowledgeable on the needs of, and  auxiliary aids and \nservices available for, people with various physical and intellectual disabilities. \n186.  Preliminary  and  permanent  orders  requiring  Defendants  to  cease \ndiscriminatory practices against individuals with disabilities at protests and provide \nreasonable modifications, including, but not limited to:  \na.  Modify policies to address the needs of people with disabilities and/or \ntheir auxiliary aids including service animals, including but not limited \nto: ceasing use of impact munitions, flashbang grenades, batons, shoving \nand other types of force and tactics unless necessary for officer safety \nbased on an immediate threat of serious harm from an individual; \nb.  Use  the  least  amount  of  force  possible  against  the  disabled,  their \nassistants, interpreters, sighted guides and/or service animals; \nc.  Provide ASL interpreters either in person or via technology, and visual \nand other alternative messaging systems, to convey all law enforcement \norders and other directions and instructions at protests; \nd.  Provide  adequate  time  and  clear  and  consistent  directions  for \nindividuals with disabilities to comply with lawful orders; \nPage 64 – FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 150    Filed 12/10/21    Page 65 of 65\n     \n \ne.  Provide additional orienting information for individual with disabilities \nto comply with lawful orders; \nf.  Before dispersing a crowd or taking other actions that may place persons \nwith disabilities in danger, identify and inform protesters and others of \naccessible avenues of escape; \ng.  Stop separating people with disabilities from their assistants, devices, \ninterpreters, sighted guides and/or service animals; \n187.  Award compensatory damages as provided by the laws set forth above; \n188.  An order awarding Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees, expenses, and costs as \nprovided by law; and \n189.

As a result the First Amended Complaint should be dismissed as to \nDefendant Multnomah County. \nMEMORANDUM \nA.  NATURE OF THE CASE \nThis case alleges violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation \nAct against the City of Portland and Multnomah County “for failing to establish policies, \nprocedures, and officer training for policing protests and implementing crowd control and public \nsafety measures that afford people with disabilities the same opportunity to engage in protest-\nrelated activities as non-disabled protesters.”  (First Amended Complaint, ¶ 7).  Plaintiffs are \ndisabled or, in the case of Jackson Tudela, associated with a person who is disabled.  (First \nAmended Complaint, ¶ 10). \nThe specific systemic allegations are that Defendants failed to provide effective \ncommunication for people with disabilities during protests. This failure results in force prior to \ngiving persons with disabilities a reasonable opportunity to disperse effectively preventing them \nfrom participating in the protests.  (First Amended Complaint, ¶¶145-155).  Plaintiffs allege that \nDefendant Multnomah County is jointly liable for this failure because they actively coordinate \nwith the City of Portland on a regular basis in providing crowd control.  (First Amended \nPage 2 – DEFENDANT MULTNOMAH COUNTY’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \nMultnomah County Attorney \n501 S.E. Hawthorne Blvd., Ste. 500 \nPortland, Oregon 97214 \n(503) 988-3138 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 152    Filed 01/10/22    Page 3 of 7\nComplaint, ¶138).  Plaintiffs assert the same or similar allegations under the Rehabilitation Act. \n(First Amended Complaint, ¶¶140-155). \nThe relief requested includes declaratory and injunctive relief as well as compensatory \ndamages and attorney fees. \nB.  MATERIALS FACTS \n  The factual allegations against Defendant Multnomah County fall into two categories: (1) \nconclusory allegations of joint liability relating to systemic violations, and (2) specific factual \nallegations relating to an incident that occurred on September 26, 2020. \n1.  Joint Liability \nPlaintiffs assert joint liability in this case as follows: \n“Plaintiffs are informed, believe, and thereupon allege that the City \nand PPB often enlist other law enforcement agencies to provide \nassistance or backup in crowd control during protests. Plaintiffs are \nfurther informed, believe, and thereupon allege that the City and \nPPB  typically  coordinate  with  the  County  and  the  Sheriff’s \ndeputies  to  be  present  at  protests  and  to  provide  assistance  or \nbackup in implementing crowd control measures.” \n \n(First Amended Complaint, ¶38).  Plaintiffs further allege: \n“Plaintiffs are informed, believe, and thereupon allege that, both \nPPB and the Sheriffs work in tandem to respond to protests in \nPortland and, as a result, each agency is liable for failing to provide \nreasonable accommodations to Plaintiffs and other protesters with \ndisabilities and the resulting harm.” \n \n(First Amended Complaint, ¶ 39).  In support of these conclusory allegations, Plaintiffs identify \nExecutive Orders issued by Governor Kate Brown that authorized unified command between the \nState of Oregon and Multnomah County on specific dates. (First Amended Complaint, ¶ 40). \n/// /// /// \n/// /// /// \nPage 3 – DEFENDANT MULTNOMAH COUNTY’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \nMultnomah County Attorney \n501 S.E. Hawthorne Blvd., Ste. 500 \nPortland, Oregon 97214 \n(503) 988-3138 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 152    Filed 01/10/22    Page 4 of 7\n2.  September 26, 2020 \nIn addition to the conclusory statements of joint liability, Plaintiffs offer a single instance \nof force used on September 26, 2020.  On that night, the Portland Police Bureau declared a riot. \n(First Amended Complaint, ¶ 106).  The crowd began moving backwards.  (First Amended \nComplaint, ¶ 106).  Police pushed the crowd and hit them with batons.  (First Amended \nComplaint, ¶ 106).  The crowd turned into a stampede.  (First Amended Complaint, ¶ 106). \nPlaintiffs, Katalina Durden and Jackson Tudela, were caught up in the crowd.  (First Amended \nComplaint, ¶ 108).  They were knocked down by the police. (First Amended Complaint, ¶ 108). \nDuring the arrest, Plaintiffs allege: \n“Defendants’ officers surrounded Jack, who was unable to quickly \nget up after being shoved to the ground, and proceeded to violently \narrest Jack. The arresting Sheriff’s deputy grabbed Jack by the hair \nand slammed their face into the ground, which busted their lip. \nAdditionally, the arresting Sheriff’s deputy, along with other of \nDefendants’ officers, lifted Jack by their arm with a bad shoulder \nin a stress position and slammed Jack against a vehicle so hard that \nthe car alarm went off.” \n \n(First Amended Complaint, ¶ 110). \nC.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n \n  Defendant Multnomah County accepts this Court’s statement of the standard of review \nunder FRCP 12(b)(1) and (6) as stated on pages 4-6 of the Opinion and Order, Docket #143. \nBecause the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act follow the same analysis no distinction is made \nbetween the two claims in the following arguments. Vos v. City of Newport Beach, 892 F.3d \n  \n1024, 1036 (9th Cir. 2018). \n/// /// /// \n/// /// /// \n/// /// /// \nPage 4 – DEFENDANT MULTNOMAH COUNTY’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \nMultnomah County Attorney \n501 S.E. Hawthorne Blvd., Ste. 500 \nPortland, Oregon 97214 \n(503) 988-3138 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 152    Filed 01/10/22    Page 5 of 7\nD.  EQUITABLE RELIEF \n \n  After briefing and oral argument on the question of standing and mootness under the \noriginal Complaint this Court ruled as follows: \n“Under the specific facts of this case, considering the significantly \nreduced number of protests, protest crowd size, police response to \nprotests,  and  deployment  of  less  lethal  munitions  and  aerosol \nrestraints, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ alleged future injury is \nnow too speculative and conjectural to provide Plaintiffs with the \nlegally cognizable interest necessary to support ongoing claims for \nfuture injunctive relief. Clark, 259 F.3d at 1012; see also Index \nNewspapers, 977 F.3d at 825 (noting that  for future injunctive \nrelief,  the  injury  must  be  “certainly  impending,  or  there  is  a \nsubstantial risk the harm will occur” (quoting In re Zappos.com, \nInc., 888 F.3d 1020, 1024 (9th Cir. 2018)).” \n \n(Opinion and Order, p. 18, Docket #143).  Plaintiffs fail to allege additional facts in support of \nthe claim for injunctive relief. The only difference between the Complaint and the First \nAmended Complaint is the absence of Melissa Lewis and Juniper Simonis and the addition of \nJackson Tudela.  Evidence of the number of protests remains substantially unchanged.  As a \nresult, dismissal is warranted as to Defendant Multnomah County. \nThe attempts at establishing joint liability are not well taken. There is no “team theory” of \njoint liability under the ADA.  Jones v. Williams, 297 F.3d 930, 936 (9th Cir. 2002) (“* * * the \ncourt examines each officer's conduct rather than employing a “team effort” approach that \nsimply “lump[s] all the defendants together.”).  Other cases support this conclusion.  See Ivey v. \nBd. of Regents of the Univ. of Alaska, 673 F.2d 266, 268 (9th Cir.1982) (vague and conclusory \nallegations of official participation in civil rights violations are not sufficient to withstand \ndismissal); Bermudez v. Ada, 944 F.2d 908 (9th Cir. 1991) (no abuse of discretion in denying \npreliminary injunction where claims were based on vague and conclusory allegations) and \nPage 5 – DEFENDANT MULTNOMAH COUNTY’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \nMultnomah County Attorney \n501 S.E. Hawthorne Blvd., Ste. 500 \nPortland, Oregon 97214 \n(503) 988-3138 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 152    Filed 01/10/22    Page 6 of 7\nKarim-Panahi v. California Dep't of Transp., 996 F.2d 1225 (9th Cir. 1993) (numerous \nconclusory allegations insufficient to support preliminary injunction). \n  E.  PHILIP WOLFE AND KATALINA DURDEN FAIL TO STATE A CLAIM \nThis Court ruled as follows on the original Complaint: \n“Plaintiffs Phillip Wolfe, Katalina Durden, and Juniper Simonis do \nnot allege any facts specifically against the County Defendants. \nPlaintiffs do not respond to this argument. Plaintiffs’ response brief \ncombines the conduct of all Defendants in arguing that Plaintiffs’ \nadequately allege sufficient harm. The Court agrees that Plaintiffs \nWolfe,  Durden,  and  Simonis  do  not  allege  facts  regarding  the \nconduct of any Multnomah County personnel and the Court grants \nthis aspect of the County Defendants’ motion.” \n \nThere are no additional facts in the First Amended Complaint alleging conduct by a Multnomah \nCounty Defendant as it relates to Phillip Wolfe and Katalina Durden.  As a result, the First \nAmended Complaint should be dismissed as to those two Plaintiffs. \n  F.  SINGLE ISOLATED CLAIM IS NOT ENOUGH \n  The only remaining claim in support of Plaintiffs’ request for systemic relief is the \nassociation claim of Jackson Tudela. The isolated incident pled in the First Amended Complaint \nis not sufficient to rise to the level of a pattern and practice supporting a theory of systemic \nviolations.  International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 336, 97 S.Ct. \n1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977) (Plaintiff must prove more than the mere occurrence of isolated or \n“accidental” or sporadic discriminatory acts).  As a result the First Amended Complaint should \nbe dismissed. \nG.  COMPENSATORY RELIEF \n  Finally “compensatory damages are not available under Title II or § 504 absent a \nshowing of discriminatory intent.”  Ferguson v. City of Phoenix, 157 F.3d 668, 674 (9th Cir. \n1998).  Deliberate indifference standard governs showing of intentional discrimination. Duvall v. \nPage 6 – DEFENDANT MULTNOMAH COUNTY’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n \nMultnomah County Attorney \n501 S.E. Hawthorne Blvd., Ste. 500 \nPortland, Oregon 97214 \n(503) 988-3138 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01882-SI    Document 152    Filed 01/10/22    Page 7 of 7\nCty. of Kitsap, 260 F.3d 1124 (9th Cir. 2001), as amended on denial of reh'g (Oct. 11, 2001). \nThis requires both knowledge that a harm to a federally protected right is substantially likely, and \na failure to act upon that likelihood.  Id.  Mere negligence is not enough; there must be an \nelement of deliberateness.  Duvall at 1124 (9th Cir. 2001). \n  The Court on the original Complaint ruled: \n“* * * the facts alleged by Plaintiffs, even taking all well-pleaded \nfactual  allegations  as  true,  do  not  show  that  in  responding  to \nprotests  the  City  has  a  practice  or  custom  of  violating  the \nconstitutional rights of persons with disabilities.” \n \n(Opinion & Order, p. 29).  The same applies to any argument in turn that the County had a \npractice or custom of violating the constitutional rights of persons with disabilities.  See Opinion \n& Order, p. 34: “Plaintiffs fail to allege facts showing that a policy of the County Defendants \namounts to deliberate indifference to any specific Plaintiff’s constitutional rights.” The First \nAmended Complaint fails to address this deficiency and as such dismissal of the compensatory \nclaims is warranted. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons set forth above the First Amended Complaint should be dismissed as to \nDefendant Multnomah County. \nDATED this 10th day of January, 2022. \n        Respectfully submitted,  \n        JENNY M.
