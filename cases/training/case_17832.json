          "description": "Judge Allison D. Burroughs: ELECTRONIC ORDER entered. For the reasons set forth below, Respondent's motion to dismiss, [ECF No. 21 ], is DENIED. The Court will first address Respondent's challenge to the Court's habeas jurisdiction. It is without question that habeas relief is available to Petitioners who seek release from their confinement. Gonzalez- Fuentes v. Molina, 607 F.3d 864, 873 (1st Cir. 2010) (stating that relief under § 2241 is available \"[i]f the prisoner is seeking what can be fairly described as a quantum change in the level of custody\" such as release or freedom subject to the constraints of bond or parole (quoting Graham v. Broglin, 922 F.2d 379, 381 (7th Cir. 1991))). Less clear is whether an individual may challenge the conditions of their confinementrather than the legality or duration of their confinementthrough a habeas petition. See Wilborn v. Mansukhani, 795 F. App'x 157, 163 (4th Cir. 2019) (discussing circuit split on the issue). Although many courts are reluctant to proceed on a conditions of confinement petition, the First Circuit has repeatedly stated in dicta that such petitions are not automatically barred from consideration. United States v. DeLeon, 444 F.3d 41, 59 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"If the conditions of incarceration raise Eighth Amendment concerns, habeas corpus is available.\"); Brennan v. Cunningham, 813 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"In Preiser, 411 U.S. at 499-500, the Court explicitly left open the possibility that a challenge to prison conditions, cognizable under § 1983, might also be brought as a habeas corpus claim.\"); Miller v. United States, 564 F.2d 103, 105 (1st Cir. 1977) (\"Section 2241 provides a remedy for a federal prisoner who contests the conditions of his confinement....\"). Although Respondent frames Petitioners' request as one that solely challenges the conditions of their confinement in light of the risks of COVID-19, [ECF No. 22 at 16-18], the Court notes that Petitioners have asked for several forms of relief, including release. See [ECF No. 1 ]; see also Verma v. Doll, No. 4:20-CV-00014, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62429, at *9 (M.D. Pa. Apr. 9, 2020) (\"[Petitioner] requests immediate release from custody based on what he perceives to be constitutionally deficient conditions of confinement that threaten his health and life. This is a habeas remedy.\"). Because Petitioners seek release as well as changes to the conditions of their confinement, the Court will exercise jurisdiction over their petition. Respondent next challenges the petition as failing to state a claim on which relief may be granted. [ECF No. 22 at 18]. In reviewing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must accept as true all well- pleaded facts, analyze those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and draw all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the plaintiff. See Gilbert v. City of Chicopee, 915 F.3d 74, 80 (1st Cir. 2019). In light of the current pandemic and their continued detention, Petitioners have alleged facts sufficient to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); [ECF No. 1 ]. Although the parties have filed declarations in support of their respective positions on the motion to dismiss, additional discovery is necessary to determine whether the measures the Plymouth County Correctional Facility is taking are adequate to reasonably protect Petitioners based on the allegations raised in their petition. Lastly, the Court will not address Petitioners' standing, as Respondent has withdrawn this as a basis for dismissal. See [ECF No. 61 -1 at 2]. (McDonagh, Christina) (Entered: 05/05/2020)"

Respondent is ordered not to remove any Petitioners from this jurisdiction until further notice.

Petitioners' emergency motion for an order to halt transfer of class members out of the district, [ECF No. 138 ], is DENIED as moot in light of the Court's June 8, 2020 Order allowing the transfer of three Petitioners, [ECF No. 142 ], and Respondent's recent filing indicating that he does not intend to transfer any member of the Augusto class to Etowah, Alabama at this time, [ECF No. 161 ]. In addition, the Court's June 8, 2020 Order which prohibits the removal of any Petitioner from this jurisdiction until further notice, [ECF No. 139 ], is lifted as Respondent is now required to provide the Court with 48 hours' advance notice prior to any transfers, [ECF No. 144 ]. In light of the potential for release or transfer of additional Petitioners, each time Respondent files a notice of intent to transfer or notice of release, Respondent shall also file a list of the names of those Petitioners who remain in Unit C-3.

That being said, assuming that Respondent confirms on the record what he has represented in emails, the Court is likely to allow the three being transferred to facilitate immediate removal to be removed from Plymouth.

In addition, the Court's June 8, 2020 Order which prohibits the removal of any Petitioner from this jurisdiction until further notice, [ECF No. 139 ], is lifted as Respondent is now required to provide the Court with 48 hours' advance notice prior to any transfers, [ECF No. 144 ]. In light of the potential for release or transfer of additional Petitioners, each time Respondent files a notice of intent to transfer or notice of release, Respondent shall also file a list of the names of those Petitioners who remain in Unit C-3.

          "description": "Judge Allison D. Burroughs: ELECTRONIC ORDER entered. For the reasons set forth below, Respondent's motion to dismiss, [ECF No. 21 ], is DENIED. The Court will first address Respondent's challenge to the Court's habeas jurisdiction. It is without question that habeas relief is available to Petitioners who seek release from their confinement. Gonzalez-Fuentes v. Molina, 607 F.3d 864, 873 (1st Cir. 2010) (stating that relief under ยง 2241 is available \"[i]f the prisoner is seeking what can be fairly described as a quantum change in the level of custody\" such as release or freedom subject to the constraints of bond or parole (quoting Graham v. Broglin, 922 F.2d 379, 381 (7th Cir. 1991))). Less clear is whether an individual may challenge the conditions of their confinementrather than the legality or duration of their confinementthrough a habeas petition. See Wilborn v. Mansukhani, 795 F. App'x 157, 163 (4th Cir. 2019) (discussing circuit split on the issue). Although many courts are reluctant to proceed on a conditions of confinement petition, the First Circuit has repeatedly stated in dicta that such petitions are not automatically barred from consideration. United States v. DeLeon, 444 F.3d 41, 59 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"If the conditions of incarceration raise Eighth Amendment concerns, habeas corpus is available.\"); Brennan v. Cunningham, 813 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"In Preiser, 411 U.S. at 499-500, the Court explicitly left open the possibility that a challenge to prison conditions, cognizable under ยง 1983, might also be brought as a habeas corpus claim.\"); Miller v. United States, 564 F.2d 103, 105 (1st Cir. 1977) (\"Section 2241 provides a remedy for a federal prisoner who contests the conditions of his confinement....\"). Although Respondent frames Petitioners' request as one that solely challenges the conditions of their confinement in light of the risks of COVID-19, [ECF No. 22 at 16-18], the Court notes that Petitioners have asked for several forms of relief, including release. See [ECF No. 1 ]; see also Verma v. Doll, No. 4:20-CV-00014, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62429, at *9 (M.D. Pa. Apr. 9, 2020) (\"[Petitioner] requests immediate release from custody based on what he perceives to be constitutionally deficient conditions of confinement that threaten his health and life. This is a habeas remedy.\"). Because Petitioners seek release as well as changes to the conditions of their confinement, the Court will exercise jurisdiction over their petition. Respondent next challenges the petition as failing to state a claim on which relief may be granted. [ECF No. 22 at 18]. In reviewing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must accept as true all well-pleaded facts, analyze those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and draw all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the plaintiff. See Gilbert v. City of Chicopee, 915 F.3d 74, 80 (1st Cir. 2019). In light of the current pandemic and their continued detention, Petitioners have alleged facts sufficient to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); [ECF No. 1 ]. Although the parties have filed declarations in support of their respective positions on the motion to dismiss, additional discovery is necessary to determine whether the measures the Plymouth County Correctional Facility is taking are adequate to reasonably protect Petitioners based on the allegations raised in their petition. Lastly, the Court will not address Petitioners' standing, as Respondent has withdrawn this as a basis for dismissal. See [ECF No. 61 -1 at 2]. (McDonagh, Christina) (Entered: 05/05/2020)"

    "summary": "<p>On April 7, 2020, 65 individuals detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the Plymouth County Correctional Facility (ICE) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Superintendent of the Plymouth County Correctional Facility (PCCF). The plaintiffs claimed that the health and safety measures being taken by PCCF were insufficient to curb the spread of the virus and protect the health and safety of detainees within the facility. Initially the lawsuit was filed pro se, and plaintiffs sought emergency release under under 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1226. The plaintiffs were later represented as a putative class by the ACLU National Prison Project, the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project, Boston University School of Law's Immigrants' Rights and Human Trafficking Program, and private counsel, plaintiffs sued under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1331 (federal question), 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241 (habeas jurisdiction), and Article I, Section 9, clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution (the Suspension Clause) for habeas, injunctive, and declaratory relief, including release from custody. Judge Allison D. Burroughs was assigned to the case.</p>\r\n<p>An emergency amended petition was filed on April 13 by the ACLU on behalf of only one of the plaintiffs, Wilmer Ruben Espinal Alvarado, however ACLU counsel stated in a notice that the legal evidence and argument submitted could aid in the court's consideration of the other 64 claims. The defendant filed motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim for both petitions on April 15 and 16.</p>\r\n<p>In a separate action, on April 29, Espinal Alvarado was ordered to be released unless he received a bond hearing in seven days. Docket No. 1:20-cv-10309-PBS. Espinal Alvarado subsequently filed a stipulation of dismissal for his individual claims.</p>\r\n<p>On May 5, Judge Burroughs dismissed 20 plaintiffs from the action and denied defendant's motion to dismiss, finding that habeas relief was available to plaintiffs because they were seeking release from confinement. On May 5, plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the petition and to certify the class. The following day, Judge Burroughs issued an order that required defendants to notify the court when a named plaintiffs was removed, transferred, or released from PCCF.</p>\r\n<p>On May 26, the ACLU filed an amended class action complaint on behalf of a putative class requesting habeas and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs alleged that the conditions of civil detention during COVID-19 at PCCF exposed them to a substantial risk of serious harm in violation of their due process rights and requested immediate interim release pending resolution of the litigation.</p>\r\n<p>On June 8, Judge Burroughs certified the class as \"all civil immigration detainees who are Petitioners in this action (i.e., who signed the original petition) or are otherwise presently detained in Unit C-3 at the PCCF.\" 2020 WL 3051778. Since the filing of the original petition, several named plaintiffs were released or transferred from PCCF, new plaintiffs have joined the case, and some have individually obtained counsel. Altogether, there were forty petitioners actively seeking relief under two separate petitions: the original petition, which was filed pro se, and the second class action petition filed by the ACLU with two identified class representatives.</p>\r\n<p>Hours after the court certified the class, ICE informed several detainees in Unit C-3 that they would be transferred to a different facility in Alabama. Plaintiffs filed a motion to halt the transfer of eight of the class members which was granted by the court that day. With the exception of three detainees who were already slated for removal, the court prohibited defendants from transferring detainees without advance notice and justification to plaintiffs' counsel. The following day, Judge Burroughs issued an order requiring defendants to give the court 48 hours notice before removing a plaintiff or class member. ICE later withdrew its plans to transfer class members out of PCCF.</p>\r\n<p>On June 12, plaintiffs moved for expedited bail hearings for class members and defendants again moved to dismiss the amended class petition. Between July and December, Judge Burroughs added members to the class to include new detainees that were moved into Unit C-3 and the parties continued to file status reports and discovery motions.</p>\r\n<p>Parties met for a status conference on February 23, 2021, and on March 9, filed a joint status report indicating their intention to file a joint motion to dismiss.

[ECF No. 1].  Petitioners are seeking release through \nparole or bond, and a fast-tracking of their immigration cases due to their concerns about the risk \nof contracting COVID-19 while confined in a state correctional facility.  [ECF No. 1 at 6–7].  \nSince filing their petition, several Petitioners have been terminated from the case due to release \nor transfer from PCCF, others have joined the case, and some have obtained counsel.  At this \ntime, there are forty petitioners actively seeking relief under two separate petitions.  [ECF Nos. \n1, 119].  Presently before the Court is a motion for class certification.  [ECF No. 84].  For the \nreasons set forth below, the motion, [ECF No. 84], is GRANTED. \n \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 135   Filed 06/08/20   Page 2 of 13\nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Factual Background \nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced that, due to the \n“alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction,” it had “made the \nassessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic.”  WHO, Director-General’s \nOpening Remarks at the Media Briefing on COVID-19 (Mar. 11, 2020).  Several weeks later, on \nMarch 23, 2020, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, through an executive order signed by \nGovernor Baker, limited activities taking place outside of the home through mandatory closure \nof non-essential businesses and a stay-at-home advisory issued by the Department of Public \nHealth.  Office of the Governor, COVID-19 Order No. 13 (Mar. 23, 2020).  In response to these \nevents, Petitioners initiated this action in early April, raising concerns about their safety at PCCF \nwhile being detained in connection with their respective immigration matters.  [ECF No. 1]. \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) states that “COVID-19 spreads \nmainly among people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) for a prolonged period,” and \nrecommends that individuals practice “social distancing” because “keeping space between \n[individuals] is one of the best tools we have to avoid being exposed to this virus and slowing its \nspread locally and across the country and world.”  CDC, Social Distancing: Keep Your Distance \nto Slow the Spread (last updated May 6, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html (last visited June 2, 2020).  Even if an \nindividual shows no signs of illness, the CDC advises that, “[s]ince people can spread the virus \nbefore they know they are sick, it is important to stay away from others when possible, even if \nyou—or they—have no symptoms.”  Id.  The CDC has also issued guidance specific to \ncorrectional facilities, recognizing that “[a]lthough social distancing is challenging to practice in \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 135   Filed 06/08/20   Page 3 of 13\ncorrectional and detention environments, it is a cornerstone of reducing transmission of \nrespiratory diseases such as COVID-19.”  CDC, Interim Guidance on Management of \nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities, at 4 (Mar. 23, \n2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/guidance-correctional-\ndetention.pdf.  As of June 7, 2020, there were 103,436 cases of COVID-19 in Massachusetts \nwith 8,363 cases in Plymouth County.  Massachusetts Department of Public Health, COVID-19 \nDashboard, https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-dashboard-june-7-2020 (last visited June 8, \n2020).   \nPetitioners are currently being held in Unit C-3 at PCCF.  [ECF No. 22-1 ¶¶ 9, 12].  As of \nJune 2, 2020, seven employees and two inmates at PCCF have tested positive for COVID-19, \nthough none of these individuals worked within or were detainees in Petitioners’ unit.  [ECF \nNos. 51, 61-1, 69, 97, 131].  As of April 15, 2020, each Petitioner in Unit C-3 (nearly sixty \npetitioners at that time) had their own cell.  [ECF No. 22-1 ¶ 9].   \nRespondent has submitted affidavits from the Plymouth County Sheriff, Joseph D. \nMcDonald, Jr., [ECF No. 22-1], who oversees the operation of PCCF, and from PCCF’s Medical \nDirector, Dr. Lawrence Baker, [ECF No. 22-2], outlining the steps PCCF has taken in response \nto COVID-19.  These steps include: suspending visits from friends, family members, and \nvolunteers; preventing non-essential staff from entering the facility; suspending work crew and \nsimilar assignments that would result in inmates leaving and reentering the facility; isolating \nnewly admitted inmates in a separate unit for a period of time; reducing inmate travel by \nconducting hearings via video and teleconference; splitting recreational and meal times to reduce \nthe number of inmates who are in the same room at a given time; maintaining an “aggressive \ncleaning schedule”; educating staff and inmates on sanitation and social distancing practices; \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 135   Filed 06/08/20   Page 4 of 13\nproviding soap and cleaning supplies to inmates weekly and as needed; conducting temperature \nscreenings for all employees, contractors, and visitors; and providing surgical masks for all staff \nand inmates.  [ECF No. 22-1 ¶ 6].   \nIn addition to these precautions, there is a full-time medical staff on duty at PCCF \ntwenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, including a doctor who is on site forty hours per \nweek and a nurse practitioner who is on site thirty-six hours per week, as well as around-the-\nclock on-call coverage.  [ECF No. 22-1 ¶ 3].  In addition to drafting guidelines specific to \nscreening for and treating individuals who have or are suspected of having COVID-19, \ninformation about the virus and its spread has been posted in all units and visiting areas.  [ECF \nNo. 22-2 ¶¶ 8, 15].  The medical team is also monitoring all inmates who have reported chronic \ndiseases or co-morbidities that make them more susceptible to infection.  [Id. ¶¶ 20, 22]. \nPetitioners acknowledge that Respondent has taken steps to protect inmates’ health but \nargue that these steps are insufficient.  [ECF No. 42 at 4; ECF No. 85 at 5].  Petitioners allege \nthat, despite the fact that inmates and staff have been issued masks, not all individuals wear \nthem.  [ECF No. 42 at 8].  In addition, Petitioners state that they cannot maintain social distance \nwhen lining up for and sitting during meal and recreation times, when using the telephones, or \nwhen lining up for medication or visits with medical staff.  [Id. at 4–6]. \nIn support of the motion for class certification, Petitioners have submitted an affidavit \nfrom Dr. Yonatan Grad (“Dr. Grad”) and Emma Accorsi (“Accorsi”), both of whom are \naffiliated with Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.  [ECF No. 122].  Their \naffidavit highlights the risks of COVID-19 to those who are confined in crowded, indoor spaces \nwith shared facilities where “the virus can easily spread through shared spaces such as toilets, \nshowers, and eating areas because it can remain on surfaces for up to 72 hours.”  [ECF No. 122 \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 135   Filed 06/08/20   Page 5 of 13\n¶ 7].  Dr. Grad and Accorsi also note that recent studies of incarcerated populations suggest that \nthe majority of inmates who test positive for COVID-19 are asymptomatic and conclude that \nPCCF is not conducting sufficient testing to detect asymptomatic cases.  [Id. ¶¶ 8–10]. \nB.  Procedural Background \nThere are two operative petitions in this action.  [ECF Nos. 1, 119].  On April 15, 2020, \nRespondent moved to dismiss the first-filed petition, [ECF No. 21], which Petitioners opposed in \nvarious filings, [ECF Nos. 35, 42, 45, 49, 52–54, 58].  On May 5, 2020, the Court denied \nRespondent’s motion to dismiss, finding that the Court had subject matter jurisdiction to consider \nthe petition and that Petitioners had alleged facts sufficient to state a plausible claim.  [ECF No. \n79].  Also on May 5, 2020, Petitioners Cleberson Quadrelli and Abdy Nizeyimana (“Movants”) \nfiled the present motion for class certification on behalf of themselves and similarly situated \npetitioners.  [ECF No. 84 at 1].1  Respondent opposes the motion, [ECF No. 108], and Movants \nreplied to the opposition, [ECF No. 130].   \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nTo obtain class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, a plaintiff must \nfirst satisfy the four requirements of Rule 23(a).  They must demonstrate that: \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there \nare questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the \nrepresentative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the \nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  These requirements “ensure[] that the named plaintiffs are appropriate \nrepresentatives of the class whose claims they wish to litigate.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, \n564 U.S. 338, 349 (2011).  “The Rule’s four requirements—numerosity, commonality, typicality, \n \n1 The motion was also submitted by Petitioner Evens Dry, who was released from PCCF and \nsubsequently terminated from this case.  See [ECF No. 88].   \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 135   Filed 06/08/20   Page 6 of 13\nand adequate representation—‘effectively limit the class claims to those fairly encompassed by \nthe named plaintiff’s claims.’”  Id. (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of the Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, \n156 (1982)).  “The party must also satisfy through evidentiary proof at least one of the provisions \nof Rule 23(b).”  Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.S. 27, 33 (2013); see also Crowe v. \nExamWorks, Inc., 136 F. Supp. 3d 16, 48 (D. Mass. 2015) (“[P]laintiffs must also satisfy one of \nthe elements of Rule 23(b) to obtain class certification.”). \n“Rule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading standard.  A party seeking class certification \nmust affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with the Rule . . . .”  Wal-Mart Stores, 564 U.S. \nat 350.  The Court must engage in a “rigorous analysis,” which may involve “prob[ing] behind \nthe pleadings” in order to decide whether certification is appropriate.  Id. (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. \nof the Sw., 457 U.S. at 160). \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nMovants ask this Court to name them as class representatives, appoint their counsel as \nclass counsel, and certify various issues including whether continued confinement at PCCF in the \nmidst of the current pandemic violates putative class members’ rights under the Fifth \nAmendment.  [ECF No. 84 at 1].  In addition, Movants seek to certify the following proposed \nclass: “all civil immigration detainees who are petitioners in this action (i.e., who signed the \noriginal Petition . . . .) or are otherwise presently detained in unit C-3 at the PCCF.”  [Id.].  \nRespondent challenges only the commonality and typicality of the proposed class under Rule \n23(a) and argues that Petitioners cannot satisfy the requirements under Rule 23(b)(2) because \nthey seek relief that requires the analysis of disparate factual circumstances specific to each \nproposed class member.  [ECF No. 108 at 3–4].  In addition, Respondent states that, under 8 \nU.S.C. § 1252(f)(1), the Court lacks jurisdiction to issue class-wide injunctive relief.  [Id. at 8].   \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 135   Filed 06/08/20   Page 7 of 13\nGiven that numerosity and adequacy of representation appear well-established and \nRespondent does not object to class certification on either basis, the Court will limit its analysis \nto Respondent’s challenges to commonality and typicality under Rule 23(a) and availability of a \nunified remedy under Rule 23(b)(2). \nA.  Jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1) \nRespondent asserts that the Court lacks jurisdiction to provide class-wide injunctive \nrelief, claiming that   \n“[t]he text of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1) makes this plain: “Regardless of the nature of \nthe action or claim . . . no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have \njurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of [8 U.S.C. §§ 1221–\n1232], other than with respect to the application of such provisions to an individual \nalien against whom proceedings . . . have been initiated.” \n[ECF No. 108 at 8 (alteration in original) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1))]. \nThe Government recently raised the same objection to jurisdiction in Savino v. Souza, a \nmatter before Judge Young, in which civil immigration detainees being held in the Bristol \nCounty House of Corrections are seeking relief similar to Petitioners.  No. 20-cv-10617, 2020 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 61775, at *14–16 (D. Mass. Apr. 8, 2020).  Just as in Savino, Petitioners here \nseek declaratory relief, as well as injunctive relief.  [ECF No. 119 at 19 (asking the Court to \n“[d]eclare that the petitioners and class members are entitled to release, with appropriate \nconditions and precautionary public health measures”)].  Section 1252(f) does not bar \ndeclaratory relief and is consequently not a bar to class certification.  Savino, 2020 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 61775, at *16; see also Reid v. Donelan, 390 F. Supp. 3d 201, 226 (D. Mass. 2019) \n(noting that the court had previously rejected the Government’s argument “that § 1252(f)(1) \ndeprives the Court of jurisdiction to issue even a class-wide declaratory judgment concerning the \nrights of class members”).  Further, in finding that declaratory relief was not barred under \nSection 1252(f)(1), Judge Young rejected the notion that injunctive relief was “categorically \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 135   Filed 06/08/20   Page 8 of 13\nunavailable” to petitioners who are similarly situated to the Petitioners in this case.  Savino, 2020 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 61775, at *16 (citing Rodriguez v. Marin, 909 F.3d 252, 256 (9th Cir. 2018)).   \nAs a result, the Court finds that, “at this class certification stage, it is enough to establish \nthat the Court could provide a classwide remedy in the form of a declaratory judgment or \ninjunctive relief.  Having established that, the Court rejects the government’s argument that \nsection 1252(f) precludes class certification.”  Id.  \nB.  Commonality \nRule 23(a)(2) requires the presence of “questions of law or fact common to the class.”  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  The Supreme Court has held that, “for purposes of Rule 23(a)(2) [e]ven \na single [common] question will do.”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 359 (alteration in original) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted); see also Tracey v. MIT, No. 16-cv-11620, 2018 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 179945, at *11 (D. Mass. Oct. 19, 2018) (“The commonality requirement under Rule \n23(a) is a ‘low hurdle.’” (citing Swack v. Credit Suisse First Boston, 230 F.R.D. 250, 258 (D. \nMass. 2005))).  “A question is common if it is ‘capable of classwide resolution—which means \nthat determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each \none of the claims in one stroke.’”  Parent/Prof’l Advocacy League v. City of Springfield, 934 \nF.3d 13, 28 (1st Cir. 2019) (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350).  In this analysis, the decisive \nfactor is “the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the \nresolution of the litigation.”  Id. (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350). \nMovants suggest that one of the common questions among the proposed class is \n“[w]hether, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the petitioners’ continued civil detention at the \nPCCF violates their Fifth Amendment rights such that they should be released.”  [ECF No. 85 at \n11].  Petitioners in Savino raised an almost identical common question.  See 2020 U.S. Dist. \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 135   Filed 06/08/20   Page 9 of 13\nLEXIS 61775, at *18–19 (“Whether the conditions of confinement at Bristol County \nImmigration Detention Facilities, under the current conditions and in light of the COVID-19 \npandemic, render class members’ confinement a punishment that violates constitutional \nstandards.”).  In particular, Movants note that all members of the proposed class are living in a \ncommunal setting that poses a heightened risk for infection in the midst of a pandemic.  [ECF \nNo. 85 at 11].   \nRespondent argues that this question cannot be answered on a class-wide basis because \nresolution would “require a fact-specific analysis of each class member—including their health, \nage, grounds for detention, and criminal histories . . . .”  [ECF No. 108 at 12].  The Court \ndisagrees.  The common question identified by Movants focuses on the conditions at PCCF and \nthe risk of infection to Petitioners in general, rather than on the unique impact of those conditions \non individual petitioners.  See [ECF No. 85 at 11; ECF No. 119 at 18 (“The confinement of the \npetitioners and class members subjects them to a heightened and unacceptable risk of contracting \nCOVID-19, for which there is no vaccine or cure.”)].  In a different context, the First Circuit has \nnoted that a common question may be present where a specific “policy or practice” has an impact \non a group.  Parent/Prof’l Advocacy League, 934 F.3d at 28 n.14 (“The cases plaintiffs cite each \ninvolved a definable policy or practice imposed by a single entity or a small group of actors; \nthese features facilitated the formulation of questions apt for class resolution.”).   \nOther courts have certified classes of inmates who have alleged a general risk of harm \ndue to a policy or practice, even if there might additionally be a unique or distinct impact as to an \nindividual putative class member.  See, e.g., Yates v. Collier, 868 F.3d 354, 363 (5th Cir. 2017) \n(“[T]he district court found, based on the expert testimony, that [the prison’s] heat-mitigation \nmeasures . . . . were ineffective to reduce the risk of serious harm to a constitutionally \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 135   Filed 06/08/20   Page 10 of 13\npermissible level for any inmate, including the healthy inmates . . . .”); Parsons v. Ryan, 754 \nF.3d 657, 678 (9th Cir. 2014) (“[A]lthough a presently existing risk may ultimately result in \ndifferent future harm for different inmates—ranging from no harm at all to death—every inmate \nsuffers exactly the same constitutional injury when he is exposed to a single statewide [] policy \nor practice that creates a substantial risk of serious harm.”).  In Savino, Judge Young likewise \nrecognized that this question satisfied the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a).  See Savino, \n2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61775, at *24 (“Here, too, even the otherwise healthy Detainees face a \nsubstantial risk of serious harm from COVID-19.”).   \nThe Court finds that Movants have satisfied the commonality requirement under Rule \n23(a)(2). \nC.  Typicality \n“Commonality looks at the relationship among the class members generally, while \ntypicality focuses on the relationship between the proposed class representative and the rest of \nthe class.”  George v. Nat’l Water Main Cleaning Co., 286 F.R.D. 168, 176 (D. Mass. 2012).  A \nplaintiff “may establish typicality by demonstrating that ‘[their] claims arise from the same \ncourse of conduct that gave rise to the claims of the absent [class] members.’”  In re Relafen \nAntitrust Litig., 231 F.R.D. 52, 69 (D. Mass. 2005) (second alteration in original) (quoting \nDuhaime v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins., 177 F.R.D. 54, 63 (D. Mass. 1997)).  “The ‘typicality’ \nrequirement focuses less on the relative strengths of the named and unnamed plaintiffs’ case than \non the similarity of the legal and remedial theories behind their claims.”  Id. (quoting Jenkins v. \nRaymark Indus., Inc., 782 F.2d 468, 472 (5th Cir. 1986)).   \n“Accordingly, the requirement is satisfied when ‘each class member’s claim arises from \nthe same course of events, and each class member makes similar legal arguments to prove the \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 135   Filed 06/08/20   Page 11 of 13\ndefendant’s liability.’”  McAdams v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., No. 99-cv-30284, 2002 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 9944, at *13 (D. Mass. May 15, 2002) (quoting In re Sumitomo Copper Litig., 182 \nF.R.D. 85, 94 (S.D.N.Y. 1998)); see Ouadani v. Dynamex Operations E., LLC, 405 F. Supp. 3d \n149, 162 (D. Mass. 2019) (“Typicality requires that the class representative’s ‘injuries arise from \nthe same events or course of conduct as do the injuries of the class,’ but his claims need not be \n‘identical to those of absent class members.’” (quoting Henderson v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon, N.A., \n332 F. Supp. 3d 419, 427 (D. Mass. 2018))).  Conversely, “[t]ypicality may be defeated where \nthe class representatives are subject to unique defenses which threaten to become the focus of the \nlitigation.”  Garcia v. E.J. Amusements of N.H., Inc., 98 F. Supp. 3d 277, 288 (D. Mass. 2015) \n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \nMovants state that, as proposed class representatives, they satisfy the typicality \nrequirement because they “are members of the class [and] have suffered the same injury (unsafe \nconfinement) as the proposed class members . . . .”  [ECF No. 85 at 12].  Respondent counters \nthat Movants’ “factual circumstances are too varied from those of the class members to satisfy \ncommonality” and therefore “they also are unable to satisfy typicality.”  [ECF No. 108 at 16]. \nThe Supreme Court has observed that  \n[t]he commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to merge.  Both \nserve as guideposts for determining whether under the particular circumstances \nmaintenance of a class action is economical and whether the named plaintiff’s claim \nand the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will \nbe fairly and adequately protected in their absence. \nWal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 349 n.5 (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of the Sw., 457 U.S. at 157–58 n.13 \n(1982)).  All class members reside in the same unit at PCCF and are exposed to the same risk of \ncontracting COVID-19, whether or not their individual health conditions may elevate their risk \nof getting or surviving the virus.  [ECF No. 130 at 10].  Movants are thus typical of the class in \nthat they are exposed to the same risks of being detained in Unit C-3 as other class members and \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 135   Filed 06/08/20   Page 12 of 13\nbecause their alleged harm arises out of “the same events or course of conduct” as other class \nmembers.  See Ouadani, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 162.  Movants are therefore in a position to “fairly \nand adequately” protect the interests of other class members.  See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 349 n.5. \nThe Court finds that Movants have satisfied the typicality requirement under Rule \n23(a)(3). \nD.  Relief Available to the Proposed Class \nMovants seek class certification under Rule 23(b)(2).  [ECF No. 85 at 14].  “A class \nqualifies for certification under Rule 23(b)(2) when ‘the party opposing the class has acted or \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or \ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.’”  Donovan v. \nPhilip Morris USA, Inc., 268 F.R.D. 1, 11 (D. Mass. 2010) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2)).  \n“In effect, the actual requirements of the Rule are meant to ensure there is group harm that a \ngroup injunctive remedy will correct.”  Id. at 12.  In addition, “Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a \nsingle injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class.  It \ndoes not authorize class certification when each individual class member would be entitled to a \ndifferent injunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant.”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360.   \nRespondent claims that Petitioners’ request for release for every class member cannot be \nresolved on a class-wide basis.  [ECF No. 108 at 17].  As Judge Young noted in Savino, \nhowever, release is not the only remedy available to Petitioners.  See 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n61775, at *25.  For example, the Court could issue “an injunction ordering the government to \nreduce crowding of [d]etainees.”  Id.; see also Brito v. Barr, 395 F. Supp. 3d 135, 147–48 (D. \nMass. 2019) (granting class certification for civil detainees and noting that Rule 23(b)(2) \nrequirement was met where declaratory judgment could explain bond procedures required under \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 135   Filed 06/08/20   Page 13 of 13\nDue Process without the court being required to grant bond hearings for all detainees); Reid v. \nDonelan, No. 13-cv-30125, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181700, at *18 (D. Mass. Oct. 23, 2018) \n(stating that “[a] holding that the Constitution provides a right to a reasonableness hearing during \na prolonged detention would resolve all class members’ claims at once” without the need for \nindividualized remedies, which would satisfy the requirements under 23(b)(2)). \nMovants have therefore satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) by demonstrating that \na single remedy could provide relief to all class members. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nAccordingly, Movants’ motion for class certification, [ECF No. 84], is GRANTED.  The \nCourt certifies the following class:  \nAll civil immigration detainees who are Petitioners in this action (i.e., who signed \nthe original petition, [ECF No. 1]) or are otherwise presently detained in Unit C-3 \nat the PCCF.   \nMovants, Petitioners Cleberson Quadrelli and Abdy Nizeyimana, are appointed class \nrepresentatives and their counsel are appointed as class counsel.   \nSO ORDERED.               \n                         \nJune 8, 2020  /s/ Allison D.

(Court Reporter: Joan \nDaly at joanmdaly62@gmail.com.)(Attorneys present: Weida, Lagana, \nWarner, Pomerleau, Rubin, McCreedy, McFadden, Keefe, Holper) \n(Folan, Karen) (Entered: 05/05/2020) \n05/05/2020  79   Judge Allison D. Burroughs: ELECTRONIC ORDER entered. For the \nreasons set forth below, Respondent's motion to dismiss, [ECF No. 21 ], \nis DENIED. \nThe Court will first address Respondent's challenge to the Court's \nhabeas jurisdiction. It is without question that habeas relief is available \nto Petitioners who seek release from their confinement. Gonzalez-\nFuentes v. Molina, 607 F.3d 864, 873 (1st Cir. 2010) (stating that relief \nunder § 2241 is available \"[i]f the prisoner is seeking what can be fairly \ndescribed as a quantum change in the level of custody\" such as release \nor freedom subject to the constraints of bond or parole (quoting Graham \nv. Broglin, 922 F.2d 379, 381 (7th Cir. 1991))). Less clear is whether an \nindividual may challenge the conditions of their confinementrather than \nthe legality or duration of their confinementthrough a habeas \npetition. See Wilborn v. Mansukhani, 795 F. App'x 157, 163 (4th Cir. \n2019) (discussing circuit split on the issue). Although many courts are \nreluctant to proceed on a conditions of confinement petition, the First \nCircuit has repeatedly stated in dicta that such petitions are not \n\nautomatically barred from consideration. United States v. DeLeon, 444 \nF.3d 41, 59 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"If the conditions of incarceration raise \nEighth Amendment concerns, habeas corpus is available.\"); Brennan v. \nCunningham, 813 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"In Preiser, 411 U.S. at \n499-500, the Court explicitly left open the possibility that a challenge to \nprison conditions, cognizable under § 1983, might also be brought as a \nhabeas corpus claim.\"); Miller v. United States, 564 F.2d 103, 105 (1st \nCir. 1977) (\"Section 2241 provides a remedy for a federal prisoner who \ncontests the conditions of his confinement....\"). \nAlthough Respondent frames Petitioners' request as one that solely \nchallenges the conditions of their confinement in light of the risks of \nCOVID-19, [ECF No. 22 at 16-18], the Court notes that Petitioners \nhave asked for several forms of relief, including release. See [ECF \nNo. 1 ]; see also Verma v. Doll, No. 4:20-CV-00014, 2020 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 62429, at *9 (M.D. Pa. Apr. 9, 2020) (\"[Petitioner] requests \nimmediate release from custody based on what he perceives to be \nconstitutionally deficient conditions of confinement that threaten his \nhealth and life. This is a habeas remedy.\"). Because Petitioners seek \nrelease as well as changes to the conditions of their confinement, the \nCourt will exercise jurisdiction over their petition. \nRespondent next challenges the petition as failing to state a claim on \nwhich relief may be granted. [ECF No. 22 at 18]. In reviewing a motion \nto dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must accept as true all well-\npleaded facts, analyze those facts in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiff, and draw all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the \nplaintiff. See Gilbert v. City of Chicopee, 915 F.3d 74, 80 (1st Cir. \n2019). In light of the current pandemic and their continued detention, \nPetitioners have alleged facts sufficient to \"state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face.\" See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, \n570 (2007); [ECF No. 1 ]. Although the parties have filed declarations \nin support of their respective positions on the motion to dismiss, \nadditional discovery is necessary to determine whether the measures the \nPlymouth County Correctional Facility is taking are adequate to \nreasonably protect Petitioners based on the allegations raised in their \npetition. \nLastly, the Court will not address Petitioners' standing, as Respondent \nhas withdrawn this as a basis for dismissal.

The novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is spreading rapidly throughout the \nMassachusetts incarceration system.  The virus is highly contagious.  It has a multi-day \nincubation period during which an infected person shows no symptoms.  The virus can be \ntransmitted by asymptomatic people.  The only known measures to mitigate its spread are \nimpossible in communal living environments, including prisons and jails.  As the City of New \nYork Board of Correction has explained: “Given the nature of jails (e.g. dense housing areas and \nstructural barriers to social distancing, hygiene, and sanitation), the number of patients diagnosed \nwith COVID-19 is certain to rise exponentially.”1\t\n                                                 \n1 https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/boc/downloads/pdf/News/covid-19/Letter-from-BOC-re-NYC-\nJails-and-COVID-19-2020-03-21.pdf  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 2 of 21\n2.  COVID-19 has been detected within the Plymouth County Correctional Facility \n(the “PCCF”).  Multiple PCCF staff members have tested positive for the virus, as has at least \none prisoner.  The PCCF houses numerous civil immigration detainees in close quarters where \n“physical distancing,” avoiding shared surfaces and objects, and normal hygiene are impossible. \t\n3.  Petitioners Cleberson Quadrelli, Evens Dry, and Abdy Nizeyimana are civil \nimmigration detainees at the PCCF.   Mr. Dry and Mr. Nizeyimana have never been convicted of \nany crimes, and no final decision has been made as to whether or not they will be allowed to \nremain in the United States.  Mr. Quadrelli has no criminal record except for non-violent motor \nvehicle offenses that occurred roughly a decade ago, and has a Petition for Review pending \nbefore the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.        \t\n4.  To protect themselves, these detainees seek immediate release to a location where \nthey may safely self-isolate for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak.  Their release can be \nsubject to GPS monitoring and any other conditions that the Court deems appropriate.\t\nPARTIES\t\n5.  Petitioner Cleberson Quadrelli has been held in civil immigration detention since \nMay 2019.  He is currently detained at the PCCF in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  On information \nand belief, he is detained in Unit C-3 within the facility. \n6.  Petitioner Evens Dry has been held in civil immigration detention since July \n2019.  He is currently detained at the PCCF in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  On information and \nbelief, he is detained in Unit C-3 within the facility.   \n7.  Petitioner Abdy Nizeyimana has been held in civil immigration detainee since \nSeptember 2019.  He is currently detained at the PCCF in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  On \ninformation and belief, he is detained in Unit C-3 within the facility.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 3 of 21\n8.  Respondent Antone Moniz is the Superintendent of the Plymouth County \nCorrectional Facility and is petitioners’ immediate custodian.  He is sued in his official capacity \nonly.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  This Court has jurisdiction, including pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal \nquestion), 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (habeas jurisdiction), and Article I, Section 9, clause 2 of the United \nStates Constitution (the Suspension Clause). \n10.   Venue is proper because each petitioner is detained in Massachusetts. \nFACTS \nA. COVID-19 poses a grave risk of serious illness and death to everyone, and especially \nto people over 50 and those with certain medical conditions. \n11.  The novel coronavirus responsible for the illness COVID-19 has led to a global \npandemic.  As of May 5, 2020, according to the World Health Organization, more than 3.5 \nmillion people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 around the world and almost 250,000 have \n2 \ndied. In the United States alone, there are well over a million confirmed COVID-19 infections, \nresulting in nearly 70,000 deaths.3  In Massachusetts, there have been 69,087 confirmed cases, \nand more than 4,000 people have died in just the last month and a half.4  These numbers are \nlikely a substantial underestimate, due to the lack of availability of testing, as well as the \nmulti-day incubation period during which people are infected but asymptomatic.  \n                                                 \n2 https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 \n3 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html. \n4 https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-dashboard-may-4-2020/download.  The fatality rate over \nthe last 45 days in Massachusetts alone is roughly the equivalent of a commercial airline crash \noccurring every other day.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 4 of 21\n12.  The rates of infection are exponential, not linear, meaning that for each person \ninfected one day, the next day we should expect to see not one, but many more infections.  \n13.  The virus is transmitted through droplets and on contaminated surfaces. Airborne \ntransmission has also been documented.  The average incubation period (time from infection to \nsymptoms) has generally been reported to be around five days.  Both symptomatic and \nasymptomatic people can transmit the virus.   \n14.  Outcomes from COVID-19 vary from asymptomatic infection to death. In \nparticularly vulnerable populations, the fatality rate is about 15 percent—meaning about one out \nof every seven people in this group who contract the illness will die. An even higher percentage \nwill suffer serious illness. \n15.  Those who do not die may experience long-term harm. COVID-19 can severely \ndamage lung tissue, which requires an extensive period of rehabilitation, and in some cases, can \ncause a permanent loss of respiratory capacity.  \n16.  People over the age of 50 and those with certain medical conditions face elevated \nrisk of severe illness and death from COVID-19.  The medical conditions that increase the risk of \nserious COVID-19 disease include lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, chronic liver \nor kidney disease (including hepatitis and dialysis), diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension, \ncompromised immune systems (such as from cancer, HIV, or autoimmune disease), blood \ndisorders (including sickle cell disease), inherited metabolic disorders, stroke, developmental \ndelay, and pregnancy. \n17.  There is no approved and available vaccine to prevent contracting COVID-19.  \nThere is no known cure or anti-viral treatment for COVID-19 at this time.  The only way to \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 5 of 21\nprotect vulnerable people from serious health outcomes, including death, is to prevent them from \nbeing infected with the coronavirus. \n18.  Preventing infection currently requires steps such as “social distancing” (such as \nremaining physically separated from other people, and avoiding the use of shared objects and \nsurfaces) and vigilant hygiene (such as frequently washing or sanitizing the hands).  Distancing \nmust occur before individuals display symptoms, as they may be contagious before they are \nsymptomatic. \n19.  To reduce the spread of infection, state and federal governments have undertaken \nextraordinary measures to separate people and limit their interactions.  In Massachusetts, for \nexample, the Governor has declared a state of emergency, ordered the closure of all non-essential \nbusinesses, and prohibited gatherings of more than 10 people.5  The Governor also advised all \nresidents to stay home and avoid all unnecessary travel and activities.6   \n20.  Preventing COVID-19 is in the public interest.  People with COVID-19 often \nrequire intensive medical interventions, including hospitalization, use of a ventilator, and other \nlife support.  Consequently, an outbreak of COVID-19 cases in any discrete location—whether \nin a nursing home, university, or incarceration facility—presents a serious risk of overwhelming \nthe local medical resources upon which all residents rely. \n                                                 \n5 https://www.mass.gov/doc/march-23-2020-essential-services-and-revised-gatherings-\norder/download \n6 https://www.mass.gov/news/governor-charlie-baker-orders-all-non-essential-businesses-to-\ncease-in-person-operation \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 6 of 21\nB.  Detainees at PCCF are at high risk for COVID-19 infection. \n21.  At present, there is no way to adequately protect people from COVID-19 in \ncommunal living environments, particularly people who are medically vulnerable.  For example, \nnursing homes—where staff are trained to prevent the spread of communicable diseases—have \nbeen the sites of some of the largest concentrated outbreaks of COVID-19 in the United States.  \nMore than 50% of all COVID-19 deaths in Massachusetts have occurred among residents of \nlong-term care facilities.7 \n22.  Similarly, COVID-19 is spreading rapidly through the Massachusetts \nincarceration system.  To date, at least eight prisoners in Massachusetts state facilities have died \nfrom COVID-19. \n23.  In the Massachusetts Department of Correction (the “DOC”), the number of the \nincarcerated people who tested positive for COVID-19 has more than octupled in the last month,  \nincreasing from 40 to 351.   \n24.  COVID-19 is also spreading through the county Houses of Correction.  For \nexample, the number of positive cases in the Essex and Middlesex county sheriffs’ departments \n(prisoners and staff) has more than doubled over the last two weeks to more than 70 cases each.8 \n25.  The virus that causes COVID-19 is present in the PCCF.  Multiple PCCF staff \nmembers and at least one PCCF inmate have tested positive for COVID-19. \n                                                 \n7 https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-dashboard-may-4-2020/download. \n8 Real-time tracking available at: https://data.aclum.org/sjc-12926-tracker/. \nAdditionally, nationwide, more than 600 confirmed cases have been reported in ICE detention \nfacilities.  See https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus.  And the New York Times is currently tracking \nmore than 10,000 cases in state prisons and detention facilities.  See \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 7 of 21\n26.  People incarcerated at the PCCF live in close quarters and rely on shared spaces \nto eat, sleep, shower, and use the bathroom.  They cannot achieve the physical distancing needed \nto effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19.  Similarly, the intensive hygiene practices \nnecessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are impossible. \n27.  Immigration detainees at the PCCF are housed in several units, one of which is C-\n3.  Within each unit, people are held in cells with up to five bunks each.  The unit takes meals \ntogether in a common area located immediately outside the cells.  Although each cell has a toilet, \nthe entire unit shares a communal bathroom, including several shared showers.  The living area \ncontains many metallic and plastic surfaces that detainees touch and breathe on, and as to which \nconstant disinfection is impracticable.  Correctional officers and staff rotate in and out of the \nunit.  Detainees also regularly rotate in and out of the unit as they are arrested, released, or \ndeported. \n28.  These conditions and the shared objects (furniture, bathrooms, sinks, etc.) \nincrease the likelihood that COVID-19 will spread rapidly across the facility, infecting \nvulnerable detainees.  \nC. People must be released from ICE detention. \n29.  Because risk mitigation is the only known strategy that can protect people from \nCOVID-19, public health experts with experience in immigration detention and correctional \nsettings have recommended the release of detainees from custody.  \n30.  Recognizing these grave risks, courts have begun issuing orders requiring or \nurging the release of incarcerated people.  In Massachusetts, the U.S. District Court recently \nordered that an immigration detainee be released from the PCCF based on the “extraordinary \ncircumstances” arising from the coronavirus pandemic.  See Ex. A (Memorandum and Order \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 8 of 21\n(D.E. 507), Calderon Jimenez v. Wolf, No. 18-10225-MLW (D. Mass. Mar. 25, 2020)).  The \ncourt has also certified a class of all civil immigration detainees held at the Bristol County House \nof Correction, and has ordered the interim release of dozens of detainees during the pendency of \nthat action. See generally Savino v. Souza, No. 20-10617, 2020 WL 1703844 (D. Mass. Apr. 8, \n2020) (“Savino Order”).  And in New Hampshire, the U.S. District Court has similarly \nprovisionally certified a class of immigration detainees and is considering expedited applications \nfor interim release.  See generally Gomes v. DHS, No. 20-453, 2020 WL 2113642 (D.N.H. May \n4, 2020).   \n31.  Similarly, the U.S. Court of the Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently ordered the \nrelease of an immigrant from ICE detention in light of the dangers posed by the COVID-19 \ncrisis. See, e.g., Xochihua-Jaimes v. Barr, No. 18-71460, 2020 WL 1429877 (9th Cir. Mar. 24, \n2020) (Order) (“[I]n light of the rapidly escalating public health crisis, which public health \nauthorities predict will especially impact immigration detention centers, the court sua sponte \norders that Petitioner be immediately released from detention and that removal of Petitioner be \nstayed pending final disposition by this court.”).  Other U.S. District Courts have issued orders \nrequiring that immigration detainees be released in light of the coronavirus pandemic.  See, e.g., \nA.R. v. Decker, No. 20-3600 (D.N.J. Apr. 12, 2020); Bent v. Barr, No. 19-CV-06123, 2020 WL \n1812850 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 9, 2020); Ortuno v. Jennings, No. 3:20-cv-02064-MMC, Dkt. No. 38 \n(N.D. Cal. Apr. 8, 2020); Toma v.

Marin, No. 20-00646, Dkt. No. 10, (C.D. Cal. Apr. 3, 2020); Orders, \nRobles v. Wolf, No. 20-cv-627, Dkt. Nos. 32, 35, 36, 38, 39 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 2, 2020); Hernandez \nv. Wolf, 20-cv-617, Dkt. No. 17 (C.D. Cal.

Decker, No. 20-2518, 2020 WL 1481503, \nat *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2020). \n32.  Similarly, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court recently established a \nrebuttable presumption of release for most pre-trial detainees accused of crimes, particularly \nthose with medical vulnerabilities.  See Slip Opinion, Committee for Public Counsel Services v. \nChief Justice of the Trial Court, No. SJC-12926, at 29-30 (Apr. 3, 2020).  And the Chief Justice \nof the Montana Supreme Court recently urged judges to “review your jail rosters and release, \nwithout bond, as many prisoners as you are able, especially those being held for non-violent \noffenses.”9  The Chief Justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court ordered that everyone held \non bond in a non-capital case be released, unless there exists an “unreasonable danger” or \n                                                 \n9 See Letter from Mike McGrath, Chief Justice of Montana Supreme Court, to Montana Courts \nof Limited Jurisdiction Judges (Mar. 20, 2020), https://courts.mt.gov/ \nPortals/189/virus/Ltr%20to%20COLJ%20Judges%20re%20COVID-19%20032020.pdf?ver= \n2020-03-20-115517-333 (emphasis added). \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 10 of 21\n“extreme flight risk.”10  And in New Jersey, after the Supreme Court ordered briefing and \nargument on why it should not order the immediate release of individuals serving county jail \nsentences, the Attorney General and County Prosecutors agreed to create an immediate \npresumption of release for every person serving a county jail sentence in New Jersey.11  Many \nother courts have taken similar steps, recognizing that public safety means ensuring the public’s \nhealth.12  \nD. Petitioners should be immediately released to a location where they can safely \nself-isolate under whatever conditions and supervision the Court deems \nappropriate. \n33.  Petitioner Cleberson Quadrelli has been held in civil immigration detention since \nMay 2019.  He is currently detained at the PCCF in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  On information \nand belief, he is detained in Unit C-3 within the facility.  Mr. Quadrelli has no criminal record \nexcept for non-violent motor vehicle offenses that occurred roughly a decade ago.  He is \ncurrently seeking to re-open his removal proceedings on the grounds of legal error that resulted \nin the denial of his eligibility for cancellation of removal.  He currently has a Petition for Review \npending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit where the legal issue regarding his \neligibility will be addressed.  His removal is presently stayed by court order. \n                                                 \n10 Memo from Chief Justice Beatty to Magistrates, Municipal Judges, and Summary Court Staff \n(Mar. 16, 2020), https://www.sccourts.org/whatsnew/displayWhatsNew.cfm?indexId=2461. \n11  See https://www.aclu-nj.org/files/5415/8496/4744/2020.03.22_-\n_Consent_Order_Filed_Stamped_Copy-1.pdf; \nhttps://www.njcourts.gov/public/assets/COVIDproposedOTSC.pdf?c=PkD \n \n12 See Appendix: Court Actions Across the Country to Reduce Incarceration in Light of Covid-\n19.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 11 of 21\n34.  Petitioner Evens Dry has been held in civil immigration detention since July \n2019.  He is currently detained at the PCCF in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  On information and \nbelief, he is detained in Unit C-3 within the facility.  Mr. Dry has never been convicted of a \ncrime.   \n35.  Petitioner Abdy Nizeyimana has been held in civil immigration detainee since \nSeptember 2019.  He is currently detained at the PCCF in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  On \ninformation and belief, he is detained in Unit C-3 within the facility.  Mr. Nizeyimana has never \nbeen convicted of a crime. \n36.  Continued detention in the PCCF puts petitioners at high risk of severe illness and \ndeath from COVID-19. \nLEGAL FRAMEWORK \nA. Petitioners are entitled to constitutional due process protections against infectious \ndisease and death while detained. \n \n37.  The Eighth Amendment requires that “inmates be furnished with the basic human \nneeds, one of which is ‘reasonable safety.’” Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993) \n(quoting DeShaney v. Winnebago Cty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 200 (1989)).  \nAccordingly, “[i]t would be odd to deny an injunction to inmates who plainly proved an unsafe, \nlife-threatening condition in their prison on the ground that nothing yet had happened to them.” \nId.  The Supreme Court has explicitly recognized that the risk of contracting a communicable \ndisease may constitute such an “unsafe, life-threatening condition” that threatens “reasonable \nsafety.”  Id. \n38.  Immigration detainees, even those with prior criminal convictions, are civil \ndetainees held pursuant to civil immigration laws.  Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001). \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 12 of 21\n39.  For pretrial and civil detainees, due process “provides at least as much protection \n. . . as the Eighth Amendment provides for convicted inmates.”  Ruiz-Rosa v. Rullan, 485 F.3d \n150, 155 (1st Cir. 2007) (emphasis added); accord Gaudreault v. Municipality of Salem, 923 \nF.2d 203, 208 (1st Cir. 1990).  Indeed, civil detainees, like petitioners here, are entitled to \nconditions of confinement that are superior to those of convicted prisoners.  See Alves v. Murphy, \n530 F. Supp. 2d 380, 387 (D. Mass. 2008); see also King v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 885 F.3d 548, \n557 (9th Cir. 2018); Jones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, 933-34 (9th Cir. 2004).   \n40.  Consequently, under the Due Process Clause, pretrial and civil detainees, like \npetitioners, may not be subject to conditions that amount to punishment, including conditions \nthat fail to “reasonably relate[] to a legitimate governmental objective.”  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. \n520, 539 (1979); accord Lyons v. Powell, 838 F.2d 28, 29 (1st Cir. 1988).  Accordingly, the First \nCircuit has found that, at a minimum, detention conditions are unconstitutional where they: \n(1) objectively deny a minimal measure of necessities required for civilized living; and (2) are \nimposed with deliberate indifference to inmate health or safety.  Surprenant v. Rivas, 424 F.3d 5, \n18-19 (1st Cir. 2005); Reaves v. Dep’t of Corr., 333 F. Supp. 3d 18, 26 (D. Mass. 2018); \nCouchon v. Cousins, No. 17-10965, 2018 WL 4189694, at *6 (D. Mass. Aug. 31, 2018).   \n41.  Additionally, the Due Process Clause protects detainees, like petitioners, not only \nfrom conduct amounting to deliberate indifference, but also from objectively unreasonable \nconduct that creates a risk to their safety.  See Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2472-73 \n(2015); Miranda v. Cty. of Lake, 900 F.3d 335, 352 (7th Cir. 2018); Gordon v. Cty. of Orange, \n888 F.3d 1118, 1120, 1122-25 (9th Cir. 2018).  The language of Kingsley is broad—applying not \nonly to use of excessive force by the government, but to government action generally, including \nactions involving medical treatment.  See Gordon, 888 F.3d at 1124; see also Couchon, 2018 \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 13 of 21\nWL 4189694, at *6 (noting that there is “much to be said” for the reasoning that extends \nKingsley to conditions of confinement cases). \n42.  Regardless, under either the objective unreasonableness or deliberate indifference \nstandard, petitioners should succeed on the merits of their claim.  As a court in this district \nrecently explained, “the virus is gravely dangerous to all of us,” and that harm is “more serious \nfor some petitioners than for others.”  See Savino Order at 21.   \n43.  Further, to the extent relevant, it also clear that there are substitute measures that \ncan achieve community safety and petitioners’ future appearance, absent continued detention.  \nThe Court can order release subject to home confinement, GPS monitoring, and other conditions \nthat the Court deems appropriate.   \n44.  But in all events, because the government has actual knowledge of the impending, \npreventable, and extreme risks that COVID-19 poses to petitioners (including death), their \nrelease is required under due process principles.  \nB.  Release is the only relief that can adequately protect petitioners. \n \n45.  COVID-19 poses a serious risk to petitioners.  It is highly contagious and can \ncause severe illness and death.  \n46.  The risk that COVID-19 poses to petitioners is known to Respondent.  \n47.  Petitioners’ continued detention in the absence of appropriate or sufficient care \nand protection constitutes deliberate indifference and is objectively unreasonable.   \n48.  Medical experts for the Department of Homeland Security have also identified the \nrisk of COVID-19 spreading to ICE detention centers.  As early as February 25, 2020, Dr. Scott \nAllen and Dr. Josiah Rich, medical experts to the Department of Homeland Security, shared \nconcerns about the specific risk to immigrant detainees as a result of COVID-19 with the agency. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 14 of 21\nThese experts warned of the danger of rapid spread of COVID-19 in immigration detention \nfacilities.  In a letter to Congress, Dr. Allen and Dr. Rich recommended that “[m]inimally, DHS \nshould consider releasing all detainees in high risk medical groups such as older people and \nthose with chronic diseases.”  They concluded that “acting immediately will save lives not of \nonly those detained, but also detention staff and their families, and the community-at-large.”13  \n49.  John Sandweg, a former acting director of ICE, has written publicly about the \nneed to release nonviolent detainees because ICE detention centers “are extremely susceptible to \noutbreaks of infectious diseases” and “preventing the virus from being introduced into these \nfacilities is impossible.”14  Prisons and jails around the country are already releasing non-violent \ndetainees because the risk of contagion is overwhelming.  The circumstances of this case make \nclear that release is the only means to ensure compliance with the petitioners’ due process rights.  \nPublic health information makes clear that the only way to prevent infection is through social \ndistancing and increased hygiene, and that these measures are most imperative to protect \nindividuals with underlying medical conditions.  The only course of action that can remedy these \nunlawful conditions is release from the detention centers where risk mitigation is impossible. \nC. ICE has the authority to release detained people in its custody.  \n50.  It is well within ICE’s authority to comply with these constitutional requirements \nby releasing people who are vulnerable to severe illness or death if they contract COVID-19.  \n                                                 \n13 Letter from Scott A. Allen, MD, FACP, and Josiah Rich, MD, MPH, to House and Senate \nCommittees on Homeland Security (Mar. 19, 2020), https://whistleblower.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/Drs.-Allen-and-Rich-3.20.2020-Letter-to-Congress.pdf. \n \n14 See John Sandweg, “I Used to Run ICE. We Need to Release the Nonviolent Detainees.” The \nAtlantic (Mar. 22, 2020), https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/release-ice-\ndetainees/608536/. \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 15 of 21\nFor example, the regulations governing ICE’s release authority state that serious medical \nconditions are a reason to parole an individual, as “continued detention would not be \nappropriate” in such cases. 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(b)(1).  \n51.  ICE not only has the authority to exercise discretion to release individuals from \ncustody, but has routinely exercised this discretion to release particularly vulnerable detainees \nlike some of the class members. \nD. This Court has the authority to order preliminary release pending resolution of this \npetition under the principles of Mapp v. Reno. \n \n52.  During the pendency of this action, the Court should order petitioners’ interim \nrelease under the principles of Mapp v. Reno, 241 F.3d 221, 223 (2d Cir. 2001).  Under Mapp, a \ncourt may order a habeas petitioner released on an interim basis after “inquir[ing] into whether \n‘the habeas petition raise[s] substantial claims and [whether] extraordinary circumstances exist[ ] \nthat make the grant of bail necessary to make the habeas remedy effective.’” Id. at 230 (quoting \nIuteri v. Nardoza, 662 F.2d 159, 161 (2d Cir. 1981)) (alterations in original).15  Courts in this \ndistrict and others have recently applied Mapp and its First Circuit analogues to order pre-\njudgment release for immigration detainees challenging their detention in light of the COVID-19 \npandemic.  See, e.g., Savino Order at 27-28; Avendaño Hernandez v. Decker, No. 20-CV-1589 \n(JPO), 2020 WL 1547459, at *2-*4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 1, 2020); Calderon Jimenez v. Wolf, No. \n18-10225-MLW (D. Mass. Mar. 26, 2020) (Ex. A).   \n                                                 \n15 Whereas Mapp required only that the petitioner raise “substantial claims” on the merits, the \nFirst Circuit – considering a habeas petition from a convicted state prisoner – articulated a higher \nstandard.  See Glynn v. Donnelly, 470 F.2d 95, 98 (1st Cir. 1972).  However, the First Circuit’s \ntest should not extend to immigration detainees, who retain the presumption of innocence, and \n“the Mapp test or something similar or perhaps less is appropriate” in the immigration context.  \nJimenez v. Wolf, No. 18-10225-MLW, Memorandum & Order, ECF No. 507 (D. Mass. Mar. 26, \n2020) at 1-2.; see also Savino Order at 27-28 n.11. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 16 of 21\n53.  Here, as in those cases, this “nightmarish pandemic” constitutes “exceptional \ncircumstances,” and petitioners have raised “substantial claims” that their detention is \nunconstitutional in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Savino Order at 27-28 & n.11.16  Habeas \nwill not be an effective remedy for them if they are no longer alive.   \n54.  This Court should therefore order petitioners’ interim release while the Court \nconsiders and resolves this matter. \nE.   This Court has the authority to order release as a final remedy. \n55.  “[H]abeas corpus is, at its core, an equitable remedy,” Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. \n298, 319 (1995), and “[f]ederal courts possess whatever powers are necessary to remedy \nconstitutional violations because they are charged with protecting these rights.”  Stone v. City & \nCty. of San Francisco, 968 F.2d 850, 861 (9th Cir. 1992).  As a result, “[w]hen necessary to \nensure compliance with a constitutional mandate, courts may enter orders placing limits on a \nprison’s population.”  Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 511 (2011); see also 28 U.S.C. § 2243; \nBoumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723, 779-80 (2008) (explaining that “common-law habeas corpus \nwas, above all an adaptable remedy,” that the “habeas court’s role was most extensive in cases of \npretrial and noncriminal detention,” and that “when the judicial power to issue habeas corpus \nproperly is invoked the judicial officer must have adequate authority . . . to formulate and issue \nappropriate orders for relief, including, if necessary, an order directing the prisoner’s release”). \n56.  Courts have regularly exercised this authority to remedy constitutional violations \ncaused by overcrowding.  See, e.g., Duran v. Elrod, 713 F.2d 292, 297-98 (7th Cir. 1983) \n                                                 \n16 As this Court observed in the Savino order, a petitioner’s challenge to detention in light of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic “would also satisfy a more exacting standard” like the one articulated by \nthe First Circuit in Glynn.  See Savino Order at 28 n.11.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 17 of 21\n(concluding that court did not exceed its authority in directing release of low-bond pretrial \ndetainees as necessary to reach a population cap). \n57.  The same principle applies here.  As the constitutional principles and public \nhealth experts make clear, releasing petitioners is the only viable remedy to ensure their safety.  \nThe Court may condition that release on the use of GPS monitoring and any other conditions it \nconsiders appropriate. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n58.  The foregoing allegations are re-alleged and incorporated herein. \n59.  Petitioners seek to represent a class defined as all civil immigration detainees who \nare petitioners in this action (i.e., who signed the original Petition (D.E. 1)) or are otherwise \npresently detained in unit C-3 at the PCCF.  The members of the class are readily ascertainable \nthrough the Courts’ and the respondents’ records. \n60.  Petitioners bring this action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and \n(b)(2) on behalf of themselves and all other similarly-situated persons within the proposed class \nas defined above. \n61.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  According \nto records produced by respondent, there are at least 42 members of the class. \n62.  There are multiple questions of law and fact common to the members of the \nproposed class, including whether, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the petitioners’ continued \ncivil detention at the PCCF violates their Fifth Amendment rights such that they should be \nreleased. \n63.  Petitioners’ claims are typical of the claims of the proposed class, and petitioners \nwill fairly and adequately protect the interests of the proposed class. Petitioners’ interests do not \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 18 of 21\nconflict with those of other members of the proposed class, and petitioners have retained \ncompetent counsel experienced in class actions and immigration law. \n64.  Moreover, certification is appropriate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(b)(2) because class members are subject to a common practice by respondent.  Every member \nof the class is at imminent risk of being infected by COVID-19 while in the custody of \nrespondent.  And, because every member of the class is entitled to relief from this \nunconstitutional detention, an appropriate injunction or declaration will provide relief on a \nclass-wide basis. \nCLAIM FOR RELIEF \nCount I: Violation of Fifth Amendment Right to Due Process \n65.  The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution guarantees that civil detainees, \nincluding all immigrant detainees, may not be subjected to punishment.  The federal government \nviolates this substantive due process right when it subjects civil detainees to cruel treatment and \nconditions of confinement that amount to punishment or when it does not ensure those detainees’ \nsafety and health. \n66.  The confinement of the petitioners and class members subjects them to a \nheightened and unacceptable risk of contracting COVID-19, for which there is no vaccine or \ncure.  Respondent, acting unreasonably and with deliberate indifference, is subjecting petitioners \nand the class members to a substantial risk of serious harm, in violation of their rights under the \nDue Process Clause.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE petitioners request that the Court immediately grant the following relief:  \na.  Certify a class defined as: All civil immigration detainees who are petitioners in \nthis action or are otherwise presently detained in unit C-3 at the PCCF. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 19 of 21\n \nb.  Name the proposed class representatives as representatives of the class and \nappoint their counsel as class counsel. \n   \nc.  Order the petitioners’ and class members’ immediate interim release pending the \nCourt’s consideration and resolution of this matter, including pursuant to Mapp v. \nReno;  \n \nd.  Declare that the petitioners and class members are entitled to release, with \nappropriate conditions and precautionary public health measures. \n \ne.  Issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus or other suitable order for injunctive relief and \norder petitioners’ and class members’ immediate release, with appropriate \nconditions and precautionary public health measures; \n \nf.  Grant any other and further relief that this Court may deem fit and proper. \n \n \nDated: May 26, 2020         /s/ Daniel L. McFadden \n \nWm. Shaw McDermott (BBO # 330860) \nAndrew C.

COVID-19 In Massachusetts. \nOn  March  10,  2020,  Governor  Charlie  Baker  declared  a  state  of  emergency  in \nMassachusetts based on the 2019 novel Coronavirus (“COVID-19”) that originated in Wuhan, \nChina.1  As of April 16, 2020, there are 29,918 cases of COVID-19.2  Of those 29,918 cases of \nCOVID-19 in Massachusetts, 2,308 cases are in Plymouth County.3  The population of Plymouth \nCounty is around 521,202.4  Based on those figures, less than half of one percent of the population \nin Plymouth County has COVID-19 (2,308 out of 521,202).  The Town of Plymouth, where the \nPlymouth County Correctional Facility (“PCCF”) is located, has 108 cases of COVID-19.5  With \na population of 60,803,6 less than 2/10th of one percent of the population of the Town of Plymouth \nhas COVID-19 (108 out of 60,803). \n                                                   \n1 See https://www.mass.gov/executive-orders/no-591-declaration-of-a-state-of-emergency \n-to-respond-to-covid-19 (last visited Apr. 14, 2020). \n2  See  https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-cases-in-massachusetts-as-of-april-15-2020/ \ndownload (last visited Apr. 16, 2020). \n3 See id. \n4 See https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/plymouthcountymassachusetts (last visited Apr. \n14, 2020) (estimate dated July 1, 2019). \n5 See https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-cases-quarantine-and-monitoring (last \nvisited Apr. 16, 2020) (link to Word document on webpage). \n6  See  https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/plymouthtownplymouthcountymassachusetts \n(last visited Apr. 16, 2020) (estimate dated July 1, 2018). \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 3 of 23\nB.  Efforts To Prevent Exposure To COVID-19 \n  At The Plymouth County Correctional Facility. \nPCCF is a correctional facility that houses inmates and detainees, including detainees like \nPetitioner here.  The Plymouth County Sheriff’s Department (“Department”) operates the PCCF.  \nSee Decl. of Joseph D. McDonald, Jr., attached as Exhibit A hereto, ¶ 2.  The Department has a \ncontract with the Correctional Psychiatric Services (“CPS”) to provide comprehensive medical \nservices to inmates and detainees at the PCCF.  See Decl. of Lawrence Baker, M.D., attached as \nExhibit B hereto, ¶ 1.  The Department and CPS provide services to Petitioners pursuant to an \nInter-Governmental  Service  Agreement  (“IGSA”)  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Homeland \nSecurity, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), and are monitored by the ICE Health \nService Corps (“IHSC”).  See Decl. of Alan Greenbaum, attached as Exhibit C hereto, ¶¶ 3-4.  As \ndescribed  below,  all  three  entities—the  Department,  CPS,  and  ICE—have  endeavored  and \nsucceeded through the present time to prevent exposure to inmates and detainees at PCCF.           \n1.  The Plymouth County Sheriff’s Department Has Instituted Protocols At The \nPlymouth County Correctional Facility To Prevent Exposure to COVID-19. \nSince the onset of COVID-19, the Department has instituted strict protocols at PCCF to \nprevent exposure to inmates and detainees.  Ex. A ¶ 5.  Those protocols include the following:   \n•  Beginning in February, the Department enhanced its inmate intake \nprocedure  to  obtain  additional  information  about  travel  and \nexposure to illness.  Id. ¶ 6. \n \n•  The  Department  has  adopted  treatment  and  detection  practices \nconsistent with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (“CDC”) and the Massachusetts Department of Public \nHealth (“DPH”).  The Department’s health services administrator is \nin frequent contact with DPH and consults them on the challenges \nfacing the Department.  Id.     \n \n•  The  Department  suspended  visits  by  friends,  families,  and \nvolunteers.  To assist with the transition, the Department arranged \nwith its telephone vendors to provide two free calls per week.  Id. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 4 of 23\n•  The  Department  restricted  attorney  visits  to  non-contact.    The \nDepartment disabled monitoring and recording functions for visit \nphones.  Id. \n \n•  The  Department  has  kept  non-essential  staff  from  entering  the \nFacility, consistent with Governor Baker’s order for executive staff.  \nId. \n \n•  The  Department  has  ceased  inmate  assignments  to  the  farm \noperation, community work crew, and other work details outside \nPCCF.  Id.     \n \n•  The  Department  has  eliminated  unnecessary  movement  within \nPCCF.  Id.   \n \n•  The  Department  established  a  housing  unit  for  newly  admitted \ninmates and inmates who leave and return to PCCF, to monitor for \nsigns and symptoms of the virus.  Inmates remain in the unit until \nthey clear the incubation period.  Id.    \n \n•  The Department has worked with state trial court officials to limit \ntravel outside PCCF by conducting hearings by videoconference and \ntelephone.  This greatly has reduced travel to and from PCCF and \nresulting potential exposure.    \n \n•  The  Department  has  changed  recreation  and  meal  schedules  to \nprovide more space in the dayrooms.  Inmates and detainees in \nstandard  large  and  small  housing  units  have  split  recreation \nschedules so that approximately half are permitted access to the day \nroom at one time.  The  inmates and detainees have split  meal \nperiods, as well.  Id.       \n \n•  The Department maintains an aggressive cleaning schedule for the \nhousing units and conducts daily sanitation of transportation vans.  \nId.     \n \n•  The  Department  has  educated  staff  and  inmates  on  sanitation \npractices and proper social distancing.  The Department provides \nsoap to the inmates and detainees weekly and as needed.  The \nDepartment also provides cleaning supplies.  Id.   \n \n•  The Department conducts temperature screenings for all employees, \ncontractors, and visitors to PCCF.  Id.     \n \n•  The Department has provided surgical masks for all PCCF staff and \ninmates.  Id.           \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 5 of 23\n2.  Correctional Psychiatric Services Deployed Clinical Guidelines To Prevent \nExposure to COVID-19 At The Plymouth County Correctional Facility. \nIn addition to the Department’s protocols described above, CPS deployed a set of clinical \nguidelines,  titled  CPS  Clinical  Guideline  for  COVID-19/CORONAVIRUS  (“CPS  Clinical \nGuideline”),  to educate and guide CPS staff, including the seven fulltime staff members at PCCF.  \nEx. B ¶¶ 6, 8.  “The CPS Clinical Guideline follows the most recent guidance pertaining to \ncorrectional and detention facilities from the Centers for Disease Control and U.S. Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement, as well as recommendations from the Massachusetts Department of \nPublic Health and the World Health Organization.”  Id. ¶ 8. \nAmong other things, the CPS Clinical Guideline provides as follows:   \n•  The  CPS  Clinical  Guideline  lists  the  possible  symptoms  of  a \nCOVID-19 infection and states that upon identification of any of \nthose symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, shortness of breath, loss of smell \nor  taste,  sore  throat,  tiredness,  or  diarrhea)  the  patient  should \nimmediately be masked.  Id. ¶ 9. \n   \n•  The CPS Clinical Guideline provides that if a patient presents with \nfever and any other symptoms then the medical staff is to perform a \nrapid test for Influenza A and B.  If the influenza test is negative, \nthen medical staff is to test for COVID-19.  If a COVID-19 test is \npositive, then staff are instructed to monitor vital signs, especially \ntemperature and oxygen saturation twice a day; offer acetaminophen \n650 mg. twice per day or as needed for coronavirus symptoms for \none week; monitor the patient’s respiratory status to include oxygen \nsaturation, trouble breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, new \nonset of confusion or inability to arouse and any signs of cyanosis, \nand  nurses  are to  notify  the  on-call  doctor  immediately  if  any \nsymptoms are present and discuss possible transport to the local \nemergency room;  and restrict patient movement unless emergent \nfor anyone in isolation.  Any movement while in isolation requires \nthat staff wear a mask with shield, gloves and gown.  Id. ¶ 10.   \n \n•  The CPS Clinical Guideline also provides for the medical isolation \nof a patient with suspected COVID-19 infection be maintained until \nall the following criteria have been met: \n  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 6 of 23\na.  For individuals who will be tested to determine if they are \nstill contagious: the individual has been free from fever for \nat  least  72  hours  without  the  use  of  fever-reducing \nmedications AND the  individual’s other symptoms  have \nimproved  (e.g.,  cough,  shortness  of  breath)  AND  the \nindividual has tested negative in at least two consecutive \nrespiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart. \n \nb.  For individuals who will NOT be tested to determine if they \nare still contagious: the individual has been free from fever \nfor  at  least  72  hours  without  the  use  of  fever-reducing \nmedications AND the  individual’s other symptoms  have \nimproved (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) AND at least 7 \ndays have passed since the first symptoms appeared. \n   \nc.  For individuals who had a confirmed positive COVID-19 \ntest but never showed symptoms: At least 7 days have passed \nsince the date of the individual’s first positive COVID-19 \ntest AND the individual has had no subsequent illness.   \n \nId. ¶ 11. \n \n•  The CPS Clinical Guideline provides for restriction of patients from \nleaving the facility while under medical isolation precautions, unless \nreleased from custody or if a transfer is necessary for medical care, \ninfection control, lack of medical isolation space, or extenuating \nsecurity concerns.  Id. ¶ 12.  \n \nIn addition to the CPS Clinical Guideline, CPS has taken the following steps:   \n•  New Detainee Screening.  Upon receiving a new detainee/inmate, \nmedical staff screen the individuals for signs and symptoms of \ninfection.  This includes event travel history, temperature checks, \ntaking a recent medical history and observing the individual for any \nsigns  of  sickness.    If  an  individual  appears  symptomatic  on \nadmission a mask is applied immediately, the individual is placed in \nisolation  and  clinical  care  guidelines  are  followed  (as  outlined \nabove) thereafter.  Id. ¶ 18. \n \n•  Detainee Education and Monitoring.  Nursing staff have also been \ninstructed to use any detainee/inmate interaction as a time to educate \nthe detainee/inmate regarding COVID-19, including that all inmates \nneed to wash their hands frequently, avoid crowds and stay apart at \nleast six feet whenever possible, and to report any shortness of \nbreath or concerns of fever immediately to either nursing or security.  \nAdditionally, signs have been posted in all units in English, Spanish, \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 7 of 23\nPortuguese and Chinese, indicating that if a detainee/inmate feels \nsick, they should notify medical staff and have a mask applied \nimmediately.  Detainees and inmates are also being educated during \nmedical encounters on the signs and symptoms of a COVID-19 \ninfection.  Id. ¶¶ 16-17. \n \n•  Monitoring of Vulnerable Detainees.  CPS staff are monitoring and \nreviewing all detainees and inmates who are known to have chronic \ndisease  or  other  co-morbidities  which  would  make  them  more \nsusceptible to a COVID-19 infection.  Id. ¶ 20. \n \n•  Staff Training and Supplies.  COVID-19 health information has \nbeen posted in all units and visiting areas.  Staff have access to CDC \nmaterials, including posting the link/url for the CDC website on all \nmedical area computer equipment.  A training website for CPS \nmedical staff has been developed as well as a COVID-19 power \npoint.  Staff have access to masks, disinfectant/sanitizer and other \npersonal protective equipment.  Id. ¶ 15.   \n \n•  Staff Precautions.  CPS also is taking steps to ensure that staff do \nnot inadvertently introduce COVID-19 into the facility by educating \nstaff and screening them for raised temperatures or other signs of \nillness.  Staff have been instructed not to work if they feel ill and to \nreport any symptoms for follow up.  Staff have also been educated \nregarding both their own protection as well as CDC guidelines for \neliminating virus transmission.  Id. ¶ 19.   \n \n3.  ICE Provides Guidance To PCCF And The ICE Health Service Corps \nMonitors The Medical Care Provided To ICE Detainees At PCCF. \nIn addition to the above steps taken by the Department and CPS, ICE itself provides \nmonitoring and guidance to the medical staff at PCCF.  Specifically, IHSC uses Field Medical \nCoordinators who serve as medical consultants to the ICE field offices and monitor clinical \nservices provided at IGSA facilities that house ICE detainees, including PCCF.  Ex. C ¶ 3.  \nMoreover, on April 10, 2020, ICE “released its ERO COVID-19 Pandemic Response Requirements \n(PRR),” which is a guidance document for detention facilities housing ICE detainees, like PCCF.  \nId. ¶ 5.  As described above, CPS is complying with this guidance.  See Ex. B.     \n  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 8 of 23\nC.  The Lack of Any COVID-19 Case Among Inmates And \nDetainees At The Plymouth County Correctional Facility. \nThere is not currently, and has never been, a case of COVID-19 in the inmate and detainee \npopulation at PCCF.  Ex. A ¶ 7; Ex. B. ¶ 24; Ex. C ¶ 6.  There has been one case of COVID-19 of \na PCCF staff member.  Ex. A ¶ 8; Ex. B. ¶ 25.  That individual’s last day at PCCF was March 19, \n2020.  The individual did not have close contact with any inmates or detainees.  Ex. A ¶ 8; Ex. B. \n¶ 25.  The staff members that had close contact with that individual were sent home and were not \npermitted to return to PCCF for at least 14 days.  Ex. A ¶ 8; Ex. B. ¶ 25.  To date, that is the only \ncase of COVID-19 at PCCF.  Ex. A ¶¶ 7-8; Ex. B. ¶¶ 24-25; Ex. C ¶ 6.   \nD.  The Multi-Petitioner Habeas Petition In This Case. \nOn April 7, 2020, Pedro Wabibi Augusto and sixty-four other immigration detainees (of \nwhich Petitioner here was one) filed a petition for a pro se writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2241 (the “Augusto Petition”).  Doc. # 1; see also Doc. # 3 (describing the Augusto Petition).  \nThe Augusto Petition alleged generally, without alleging facts specific to any one of the petitioners \nindividually, that the petitioners’ detention increased their risk of COVID-19, see generally Doc. \n# 1, and sought the “release from detention” of all of the petitioners.  Id. at p.7. \nThe 65 petitioners in the Augusto Petition are a diverse group of ICE detainees.  As shown \nin the attached document, the petitioners are from a variety of countries and are detained under \ndifferent statutes.  See Compendium of Summaries, attached as Exhibit D hereto.  Some are subject \nto mandatory detention based on criminal histories.  Id.  Some have been denied release by an \nimmigration judge due to a finding of public safety or flight risk.  Id.  Some have final orders of \nremoval that ICE is seeking to effectuate.  Id.  Most appear to be in good health.  Id.  Others have \npreexisting conditions that vary among them.  Id.  Some have pending habeas petitions in addition \nto this habeas case.  Id.   \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 9 of 23\nAs of April 15, 2020, 58 of the original 65 petitioners in the Augusto Petition are still \ndetained at PCCF.  See Ex. A ¶¶ 9, 12.  The petitioners who are no longer detained at PCCF either \nhave been released on bond or transferred to other facilities.  Ex. D.  Of the 58 petitioners that \nremain, 57 of them—including Petitioner here—are “housed in Unit C3, a large direct supervision \nhousing unit with a maximum capacity of 139 inmates. . . . As a result of the low population in the \nunit, each detainee has his own cell.”  Ex. A ¶ 9.            \nWhen those petitioners—including Petitioner here—are out of their cells, such as during \nrecreation and meals, the Department takes a variety of precautions.  For example: \n•  Social Distancing During Recreation and Meals.  To permit and \nencourage social distancing, the security staff spread out the day \nroom chairs in the unit.  The Department conducts split recreation, \nwith each side of the unit entering the day room at different times.  \nThe split recreation periods provide much more space in the day \nroom and offer significant opportunity for social distancing. The \nDepartment similarly provides meals for each side of the unit at \ndifferent times.  This provides detainees multiple seating options \nwhich provide significant opportunity for social distancing.  Id. ¶ 10.    \n     \n•  Sanitation.  At the end of each recreation period, unit workers \nsanitize the unit.  Workers clean all tables, phones, day room chairs, \nshowers,  and  cell  door  handles  with  100  product  multi-use \ndisinfectant 256.  Laundry workers clean all mop heads and cleaning \nrags  every  morning.    Maintenance  officers  use  Virex  spray  to \ndisinfect showers, day room chairs, tables, phones, all door handles, \nand railings in the morning before recreation periods begin.  A \ncleaning crew cleans all visit rooms and sally ports with Virex \nfogging spray.  Id. ¶ 11. \n \n•  Sanitary Supplies.  The Department provides the detainees soap \nweekly  and  as  needed  and  provides  the  detainees  the  cleaning \nsupplies they need.  The detainees have access to the 100 product \ndisinfectant to clean their cells.  The Department provides toilet \npaper each week and as needed.  The Department runs a laundry unit \nto keep clothing clean.  Id. \n \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 10 of 23\nE.  Petitioner Wilmer Espinal Alvarado. \n1.  Petitioner’s Detention, His General Medical Condition As Reported \nWhen He Was Detained, And His Medical Treatment While In Detention. \nPetitioner, age 27, is a native and citizen of Honduras who entered the United States \nwithout inspection at an unknown time and location.  See Decl. of David Wesling, attached as \nExhibit E hereto, at ¶ 5.  He entered into ICE custody on June 6, 2019, after being stopped by a \nlocal police department for a motor vehicle violation.  Id. ¶ 6.  He is currently detained at PCCF.     \n  Petitioner’s medical information that is relevant to this case is contained in the following \nthree documents submitted today under seal: \n•  Declaration of Marcia Norat, R.N., submitted under seal as \nExhibit F.   \nMs. Norat is the Health Services Administrator at PCCF.  Her \ndeclaration contains information about Petitioner’s medical history \nand treatment while in detention at PCCF, based on her review of \nPetitioner’s medical records and information from other relevant \nhealthcare providers, including PCCF’s physician.   \n•  Declaration  of  Alan  Greenbaum,  submitted  under  seal  as \nExhibit G.   \nMr. Greedbaum is an Assistant Field Office Director for ICE.  His \ndeclaration  contains  information  regarding  Petitioner’s  general \nmedical condition as reported when he was detained and his medical \ntreatment while in detention, based on his review of Petitioner’s \nmedical records and information from PCCF. \n•  Petitioner’s Medical Records, submitted under seal as Exhibit H.  \nIn addition to the above declarations, Respondent is submitting \nPetitioner’s medical records themselves for the Court’s review.   \nAs described in the above declarations, Petitioner’s healthcare providers attest, based on his \nmedical records and their observations while Petitioner has been in detention, that his “asthma \ndoes not put him at increased risk to COVID-19.”  Ex. F; Ex. G.   \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 11 of 23\n2.  Petitioner’s Habeas Case Currently Pending Before Judge Saris. \nBecause Petitioner had no lawful basis to be in the United States when he was stopped, \nICE detained him and served him with a Notice to Appear.  Id.  An immigration judge determined \nthat Petitioner was subject to mandatory detention  under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c), and that the \nimmigration judge therefore lacked jurisdiction to consider his request for a bond hearing.  Id.  \nPetitioner reserved appeal of the immigration court’s decision but did not perfect an appeal to the \nBoard of Immigration Appeals (the “Board”).  Id.  On December 4, 2019, the immigration court \nordered Petitioner be removed from the United States.  Id. ¶ 13.  Petitioner reserved appeal of that \ndecision, and his appeal and motion to remand is currently pending with the Board.  Id.   \nOn February 12, 2020, Petitioner filed a pro se habeas petition challenging his detention.  \nSee Alvarado v. Moniz, No. 20-10309-PBS (D. Mass.) (Doc. # 1).  On February 20, 2020, an \nattorney entered a notice of appearance on his behalf (one of the same attorneys who represents \nhim in the present case), and filed an amended petition.  Id. (Doc. # 10).  Among other things, \nPetitioner disputes that he is subject to mandatory detention under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c), argues that \nhe is entitled to a bond hearing under Brito v. Barr, No. 19-11314, 2019 WL 6333093 (D. Mass. \nNov. 27, 2019), and argues that, if he were subject to mandatory detention, then his detention is \nunlawful and prolonged under Reid v. Donelan, 390 F. Supp. 3d 201 (D. Mass. 2019).  \nOn April 10, 2020, the government moved to dismiss Petitioner’s amended petition.  \nAlvarado, No. 20-10309-PBS (Doc. # 15).  The government argued, among other things, that the \ncourt lacked jurisdiction to review whether Petitioner was subject to mandatory detention under 8 \nU.S.C. § 1226(c).  Alvarado, No. 20-10309-PBS (Doc. # 16) (citing Flores-Powell v. Chadbourne, \n677  F.  Supp.  2d  455,  464-66  (D.  Mass.  2010)).    Petitioner  has  not  yet  responded  to  the \ngovernment’s motion to dismiss, which currently remains pending before Judge Saris. \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 12 of 23\n3.  The Alvarado Petition In This Case. \nOn April 14, 2020, Petitioner, represented by lawyers from the American Civil Liberties \nUnion and the same attorney who represents him in the habeas case pending before Judge Saris, \nfiled the Alvarado Petition in this case.  Doc. # 8.  Unlike the Augusto Petition, which contained \nonly general allegations without facts specific to any one of the petitioners individually, the \nAlvarado Petition is unique to Petitioner.  See generally id.  Specifically, the Alvarado Petition \nalleges that Petitioner “suffers from asthma,” that “[h]e is not safe within the PCCF,” and that \n“[h]is medical condition puts him at high risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19.”  Id. \n¶ 3.  According to Petitioner, “the risk can only be reasonably mitigated by release to self-isolate \nin a home setting.”  Id. ¶ 42; see also id. ¶ 49 (“The only course of action that can remedy these \nunlawful conditions is release from the detention centers where risk mitigation is impossible.”).  \nThus, Petitioner “seeks immediate release to a location where he may safely self-isolate for the \nduration of the COVID-19 outbreak.”  Id. ¶ 5.     \nOn April 14, 2020, the same day the Alvarado Petition was filed, the Court ordered \nRespondent to respond within two days.  Doc. # 17.  This timely motion followed. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nBecause federal courts are considered courts of limited jurisdiction, “federal jurisdiction is \nnever presumed.”  Viqueira v. First Bank, 140 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1998).  Rather, “‘the party \ninvoking the jurisdiction of a federal court carries the burden of proving its existence.’”  Murphy \nv. United States, 45 F.3d 520, 522 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting Taber Partners, I v. Merit Builders, \nInc., 987 F.2d 57, 60 (1st Cir. 1993)).  “Once a defendant challenges the jurisdictional basis for a \nclaim under Rule 12(b)(1), the plaintiff bears the burden of proving jurisdiction.”  Excel Home \nCare, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 316 B.R. 565, 567 (D. Mass. 2004).  “In ruling \non a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, ‘the district court must construe the complaint \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 13 of 23\nliberally, treating all well-pleaded facts as true and indulging all reasonable inferences in favor of \nplaintiff.’”  Id. at 568 (quoting Aversa v. United States, 99 F.3d 1200, 1210 (1st Cir. 1996)).  “That \nis  not to  say  that this  leniency  eliminates  the  plaintiff’s  burden  of  proving  an  appropriate \njurisdictional basis.  Indeed, a plaintiff cannot assert a proper jurisdictional basis ‘merely on \nunsupported conclusions or interpretations of law.’”  Id. (quoting Murphy, 45 F.3d at 522). \nJust as a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction, so too “the \nplaintiff  bears  the  burden  of  plausibly  alleging  a  viable  cause  of  action”  under  Rule  8(a).  \nHochendoner v. Genzyme Corp., 823 F.3d 724, 730 (1st Cir. 2016).  The “‘tenet that a court must \naccept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.  \nThreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, \ndo not suffice.’”  Feliciano-Hernández v. Pereira-Castillo, 663 F.3d 527, 533 (1st Cir. 2011) \n(quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)).  “Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders \n‘naked assertion[s]’ devoid of ‘further factual enhancement.’”  Id. (quoting  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at \n678).  Rather, “‘only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to \ndismiss’” under Rule 12(b)(6).  Id. (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679). \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE ALVARADO PETITION MUST BE DENIED \nBECAUSE PETITIONER LACKS STANDING. \nAs an initial matter, Petitioner lack standing.  It is fundamental that the Constitution \n“confers limited authority on each branch of the Federal Government.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, \n136 S. Ct. 1540, 1546-47 (2016).  As relevant here, the judicial power of the United States is \nlimited to “cases” and “controversies.”  U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1.  “The doctrine of standing \ngives  meaning  to  these  constitutional  limits  by  ‘identify[ing]  those  disputes  which  are \nappropriately resolved through the judicial process.’”  Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 14 of 23\n149, 157 (2014) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)).  Standing thus \n“serves to prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers of the political \nbranches.”  Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 408 (2013).  The standing inquiry also \nfocuses on whether a particular plaintiff is the proper party to challenge government conduct.  \nRaines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 818 (1997). \nAs the party invoking federal jurisdiction, a plaintiff must establish the three elements that \nconstitute the “irreducible constitutional minimum” of standing: that (i) it suffered an injury in fact \n(ii) fairly traceable to the challenged government conduct (iii) that is likely to be redressed by a \nfavorable judicial decision.  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 102-03 (1998).  \nMoreover, a plaintiff must “demonstrate standing for each claim [it] seeks to press and for each \nform of relief that is sought.”  Town of Chester, N.Y. v. Laroe Estates, Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650 \n(2017) (citation omitted), remanded to Laroe Estates, Inc. v. Town of Chester, 693 F. App’x 69 \n(2d Cir. 2017).  The standing inquiry is “especially rigorous” where, as here, a plaintiff asks a \nfederal court “to decide whether an action taken by one of the other two branches of the Federal \nGovernment was unconstitutional.”  Raines, 521 U.S. at 819-20. \nIn this case, Petitioner has established neither injury in fact nor redressability. \nA.  Petitioner Lacks Injury In Fact.  \nTo establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must first show that he or she suffered “‘an invasion \nof a legally protected interest’ that is ‘concrete and particularized’ and ‘actual or imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical.’”  Spokeo, Inc., 136 S. Ct. at 1548 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560).  \nInjury in fact is a “constitutional requirement” and is the “[f ]irst and foremost” of standing’s three \nelements.  Id. at 1547-48 (quoting Steel Co., 523 U. S. 83, 103 (1998)).  To be “particularized” the \ninjury “must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 n.1.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 15 of 23\n“Particularization is necessary to establish injury in fact, but it is not sufficient. An injury in fact \nmust also be ‘concrete.’”  Spokeo, Inc, 136 S. Ct. at 1548.  A “concrete” injury must be “‘de facto’; \nthat is, it must actually exist[,]” that is, it must be “real,” and not “abstract.”  Id.  While “the risk \nof real harm” may, in some circumstances, be sufficiently concrete, “imminence . . . cannot be \nstretched beyond its purpose, which is to ensure that the alleged injury is not too speculative for \nArticle III purposes -- that the injury is ‘certainly impending.’”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 568. \nPetitioner’s alleged harm—that his detention increases his risk of harm from COVID-19—\nis speculative based on the site-specific circumstances at PCCF.  E.g., Spokeo, Inc., 136 S. Ct. at \n1548 (injury in fact cannot be “conjectural or hypothetical”); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 568 (injury in fact \ncannot be “speculative”).  There is not currently, and has never been, a case of COVID-19 in the \ninmate and detainee population at PCCF.  Ex. A ¶ 7; Ex. B. ¶ 24.  Although there has been one \ncase of COVID-19 of a PCCF staff member, it has been 28 days since that individual was last at \nPCCF.  Ex. A ¶ 7; Ex. B. ¶ 24.  To put that into perspective, 28 days is more than five times the \nmedian incubation period (about five days) and double the CDC’s recommended quarantine period \n(14 days).  Indeed, the fact that a staff member tested positive for COVID-19 in mid-March, and \nyet there are zero cases of COVID-19 in the inmate and detention population as of April 15, \nindicates that PCCF’s efforts are working.  Those undisputed facts fatally undermine Petitioner’s \nclaim that the efforts to prevent exposure to COVID-19 at PCCF are insufficient to the point where \nthey require the highly extraordinary remedy of release.   \nIn addition, Petitioners cannot meet the imminence requirement based on the specific facts \nof this particular case.  E.g., Spokeo, Inc., 136 S. Ct. at 1548 (injury in fact must be “actual or \nimminent”); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 568 (injury in fact must be “certainly impending”).  Petitioner is \n“housed in Unit C3, a large direct supervision housing unit with a maximum capacity of 139 \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 16 of 23\ninmates.  As of April 15, the count was 57.  As a result of the low population in the unit, each \ndetainee has his own cell.”  Ex. A ¶ 9 (emphasis supplied).  And, when Petitioner is outside of his \ncell, such as during recreation and meals, PCCF takes a variety of precautions that reasonably \nprovide for adequate social distancing.  Id. ¶¶ 10-11.     \nWhile Petitioner has reported having asthma, Petitioner’s own healthcare providers attest, \nbased on his medical records and their observations while Petitioner has been in detention, that his \n“asthma does not put him at increased risk to COVID-19.”  Ex. F; Ex. G.  Petitioner submitted \ndeclarations in which a non-treating physician and his own lawyer with no stated medical training \noffered their opinions regarding Petitioner’s asthma and its associated risks.  See Doc. # 10 ¶ 25 \n(non-treating physican); Doc. # 12 ¶¶ 5, 8 (lawyer).  Even if those opinions were weighed equally \nagainst those of Petitioner’s own healthcare providers (and they should not be), they cannot \nmanufacture injury in fact for Petitioner in light of the unique circumstances in this case: (1) the \npresence of a much earlier staff case that did not result in any cases among the detainee population, \nand (2) a separate cell for Petitioner.7   \nB.  Petitioner’s Alleged Injury—A Heightened Risk For Serious \nIllness Or Death From COVID-19—Is Not Redressable By Release. \nSeparately, Petitioner lacks standing because his alleged injury—that he is subject to a \nheightened  risk  of  death  from  COVID-19—will  not  be  redressed  by  ordering  his  release.  \n“Redressability requires an analysis of whether the court has the power to right or to prevent the \nclaimed injury.”  Gonzales v. Gorsuch, 688 F.2d 1263, 1267 (9th Cir. 1982) (Kennedy, J.).  For \n                                                   \n7 Thus, this case is materially distinguishable from other cases seeking similar relief.  For \nexample, none of these facts were present in Savino v. Souza, No. 20-10617, 2020 WL 1703844, \n(D. Mass. Apr. 8, 2020), where Judge Young found that the petitioners had standing.  Id. at *4.  \nThere, Judge Young relied on different facts at the Bristol County House of Correction, where the \npetitioners slept in “a large room packed with rows of bunk beds.”  Id. at *3. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 17 of 23\npurposes of standing, a plaintiff’s injury is redressable where there is “a ‘substantial likelihood’ \nthat the requested relief will remedy the alleged injury.”  Vermont Agency of Natural Res. v. United \nStates ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 771 (2000) (citation omitted).  Petitioner’s desired relief—\nrelease from detention—will not ameliorate his claimed heightened risk of injury or death resulting \nfrom COVID-19, nor can release prevent him from contracting COVID-19. \nPetitioner offers no proof—nor is Respondent aware of any—that his release from PCCF, \na  facility  without  a  single  case  of  COVID-19  in  the  inmate  and  detainee  population,  into \nMassachusetts, which has declared a state of emergency based on the COVID-19 crisis, or \nanywhere else, will reduce his risk of injury or death.  See generally Doc. # 8.  Although infection \nrates in Plymouth County are relatively low (less than half of one percent of the population), that \nrate is higher than zero—the current infection rate among inmates and detainees at PCCF.   \nMoreover, it cannot be overlooked that PCCF provides medical care at no cost to detainees, \nincluding Petitioner.  By reason of his detention, Petitioner has greater access to robust medical \ncare than many in the general public.  Ordering his release from PCCF would leave Petitioner \nwithout his present access to health care and could put him at greater risk of serious complications \nin the event that he contracts COVID-19.  As Dr. Baker attests generally in his declaration: \nWhile it is clear that a prison setting poses particular challenges from \nan infectious disease stand-point, the risk of infection is tempered \nby the degree of control we have over access to the facility.  We are \nscreening incoming detainees/inmates carefully and taking steps to \nisolate them as necessary.  We have a highly educated and trained \nstaff that is acutely aware of the risks posed by the pandemic.  We \nare also providing a level of medical care to the detainees/inmates \nthat they are unlikely to receive outside of PCCF. \nEx. B ¶ 21. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 18 of 23\n  Accordingly, for both of the above reasons—(1) that Petitioner lacks injury in fact, and (2) \nthat the alleged injury is not redressable by release—the Alvarado Petition must be denied for lack \nof standing.  Spokeo, Inc., 136 S. Ct. at 1548; Steel, 523 U.S. at 102-03; Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. \nII.  THE ALVARADO PETITION MUST BE DENIED BECAUSE PETITIONER \nDOES NOT STATE A CLAIM ON WHICH RELIEF CAN BE GRANTED. \nEven if the Court were to find that Petitioner has standing (and he does not), the relief he \nseeks is unavailable.  Petitioner seeks “a Writ of Habeas Corpus or other suitable order for \ninjunctive  relief”  resulting  in  his  “immediate  release,  with  appropriate  conditions  and \nprecautionary public health measures.”  Doc. # 8 at p.18 (paragraph “b” in the prayer for relief).  \nIn the meantime, while the Court is considering that issue, Petitioner seeks preliminary relief in \nthe form of his “immediate interim release pending the Court’s consideration and resolution of this \nmatter.”  Id. (paragraph “a” in the prayer for relief).  Based on the particular facts of this case, \nneither form of relief is available.   \nA.  Release As A Final Remedy Is Not Warranted Because Because \nPetitioner Has Not Demonstrated A Violation Of The Fifth Amendment. \nWhen the government detains a person pursuant to an immigration violation, that person \nis a civil detainee.  Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001).  To evaluate the constitutionality \nof a pretrial detention condition under the Fifth Amendment, a district court must determine \nwhether those conditions “amount to punishment of the detainee.”  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, \n535 (1979).  Punishment may be shown through an express intent to punish or a restriction or \ncondition that “is not reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective.”  Id. at 539; see \nalso Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2473-74 (2015) (clarifying that “a pretrial detainee \ncan prevail by providing only objective evidence that the challenged governmental action is not \nrationally related to a legitimate governmental objective or that it is excessive in relation to that \npurpose”).  In addition, “when the State takes a person into its custody and holds him there against \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 19 of 23\nhis will, the Constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for \nhis safety and general well-being.”  DeShaney v. Winnebago Cty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. \n189, 199-200 (1989).   \nPetitioner does not allege an express intent to punish him.  See generally Doc. # 8.  Nor \ncan he dispute that preventing detained aliens from absconding, from harming the public, and \nensuring that they appear  for removal proceedings and their actual removal  is a  legitimate \ngovernmental objective.  See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 836 (2018); Demore v. Kim, \n538 U.S. 510, 520-22 (2003); Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. at 690-91.  Thus, Petitioner may \nsucceed on his Fifth Amendment claim only if his confinement is not reasonably related to a \nlegitimate governmental objective or is excessive in relation to the legitimate governmental \nobjective, see Kingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2473-74, or if Respondent fails to provide for his reasonable \nsafety, see DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200. \nHere, Petitioner has not made that showing and cannot do so as circumstances currently \nstand at PCCF.  As described in the attached declarations, PCCF is taking active and substantial \nmeasures to respond to a challenging public health crisis, including giving Petitioner his own cell.  \nEx. A; Ex. B; Ex. C.  Those measures create conditions that are reasonably related and not \nexcessive in relation to the government’s interests in preventing flight and protecting public \nsafety—especially when: \n•  Petitioner himself is subject to mandatory detention under 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1226(c), Ex. D at pp. 8-9; \n•  ICE believes he is a public safety risk on account of his drug \nviolation and a flight risk based upon his order of removal and \nfailure to seek any relief from removal before the immigration court, \nid.; and  \n•  Petitioner’s own healthcare providers attest that his “asthma does \nnot put him at increased risk to COVID-19.”  Ex. F; Ex. G.   \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 20 of 23\nMoreover, PCCF’s measures generally track the recommendations of public health authorities, \nincluding the CDC.  Ex. A; Ex. B; Ex. C.    \nOf course, the risk of contracting COVID-19, either in PCCF or elsewhere, cannot be \nentirely eliminated.  But Respondent is not required to eliminate any risk to Petitioner.  Rather, \nRespondent is required to provide for his reasonable safety.  See DeSahney, 489 U.S. at 200.  \nBecause PCCF’s measures meet that standard, Petitioner’s claim under the Fifth Amendment \nfails.8  E.g., Kingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2473; DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 199; Bell, 441 U.S. at 535.  \nB.  The Court Lacks Authority To Grant Interim Release To A Habeas \nPetitioner Who Is Subject To Mandatory Detention Under § 1226(c). \nPetitioner requests immediate release as a preliminmary remedy under Mapp v. Reno, 241 \nF.3d 221 (2d Cir. 2001).  Doc. # 8 ¶¶ 52-53.  His reliance on Mapp is fundamentally misplaced.  \nMapp, decided in 2001, was a pre-REAL ID Act case where an alien had challenged his deportation \nproceedings, but not the validity of his detention, through a district court habeas petition.  “The \nReal ID Act repealed the use of habeas petitions to challenge orders of removal; petitions for \nreview filed in the courts of appeals are now the exclusive procedural vehicle for seeking review \nof such orders.”  Elkimya v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 484 F.3d 151, 153 (2d Cir. 2007).  “The core \ndesideratum of the Real ID Act was to ‘restor[e] uniformity and order to the law[.]’”  Id. (quoting \nH.R. Rep. No. 109-72, at 174 (2005)); see also Bonhometre v. Gonzales, 414 F.3d 442, 446 (3d \nCir. 2005) (describing the Real ID Act’s jurisdictional modifications as “an effort to streamline \n                                                   \n8 For the Court’s convenience, Respondent has prepared a compendium of decisions, most \nof which are unpublished, that reach the same or a similar result in cases seeking similar relief.  \nSee Compendium of Decisions, attached as Exhibit I hereto.  Although all of those decisions will \naid the Court as it considers these issues, Respondent points the Court in particular to the district \ncourt’s recent decision in Ramsundar v. Wolf, No. 20-42 (W.D.N.Y. Apr. 9, 2020), which found \nno due process violation because each of the petitioners with underlying conditions had his own \ncell, as all Petitioners do here (whether or not they have an underlying condition).  The Ramsundar \ndecision may be found on page 271 of Exhibit I. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 21 of 23\nwhat the Congress saw as uncertain and piecemeal review of orders of removal, divided between \nthe district courts (habeas corpus) and the courts of appeals (petitions for review)”).   \nMapp expressly did not address whether aliens subject to § 1226(c) detention could be \ngranted bail pending habeas review.  Mapp, 241 F.3d at 228 n.10.  In discussing the scope of the \ndistrict court’s authority to release aliens on bail during the pendency of habeas proceedings, the \nSecond Circuit explained that, “in some cases, detention without bail is a necessary feature of our \ndeportation procedures,” and in such circumstances, “the burden lies on the political branches \nexplicitly to instantiate such a system of detention, and to do so through the law.”  Id. at 227.  \nCongress did exactly that in § 1226(c): “§ 1226(c) mandates detention of any alien falling within \nits scope and that detention may end prior to the conclusion of removal proceedings ‘only if’ the \nalien is released for witness protection purposes.”  Jennings, 138 S. Ct. at 847 (emphasis supplied).  \nIn § 1226(c), Congress enacted a “specific statutory provision[]” that expressly requires \nmandatory detention, i.e., § 1226(c), and that provision specifies only one circumstance in which \nan  alien  detained  under  that  section  may  be  released  before  the  conclusion  of  removal \nproceedings—namely, only for witness-protection purposes.  8 U.S.C. § 1226(c)(2); Jennings, 138 \nS. Ct. at 847.  As the Supreme Court recognized, “§ 1226(c) makes clear that detention of aliens \nwithin its scope must continue ‘pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the \nUnited States.’ §1226(a).”  Jennings, 138 S. Ct. at 846. \n  Accordingly,  because  Petitioner  is  subject to  §  1226(c)  detention,  this  Court  lacks \nauthority to grant him interim release under Mapp.  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c); Jennings, 138 S. \nCt. at 846-47.9  \n                                                   \n9 Petitioner relies on Savino, 2020 WL 1703844, at *9, and Jimenez v. Wolf, No. 18-10225 \n(D. Mass. Mar. 26, 2020) (Doc. # 8-1), where two other sessions of this Court granted interim \nrelease under Mapp.  Doc. # 8 ¶¶ 52-53.  But neither of those decisions cited the Supreme Court’s \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 28   Filed 04/16/20   Page 22 of 23\nIII.  ALTERNATIVELLY, THE ALVARADO PETITION SHOULD \nBE SEVERED AND TRANSFERRED TO JUDGE SARIS. \nAlternatively, if the Court does not dismiss the Alvarado Petition for lack or standing or \nfailure to state a claim (and it should), Respondent requests that this Court sever Petitioner from \nthis case and transfer his petition to Judge Saris, who has been presiding over his other habeas case \nsince February 2020.  See Alvarado v. Moniz, No. 20-10309-PBS (D. Mass.).  District courts have \nauthority to sever petitioners  from  multi-petitioner habeas cases where, as here, the factual \nquestions surrounding a particular petitioner’s request for relief require individualized analysis \n(i.e., Petitioner’s detention authority, his public safety and flights risks, and his underlying health \n10\ncondition).   Moreover, two pending habeas proceedings before two different judges in the same \ndistrict raises concerns about judicial economy and the potential for confusion and conflicting \norders.  Because Petitioner’s first case has been pending with Judge Saris for over two months, the \nAlvarado Petition should be transferred to Alvarado v. Moniz, No. 20-10309-PBS (D. Mass.).     \nCONCLUSION \nFor all of the foregoing reasons, Respondent respectfully requests that the Court deny the \nAlvarado Petition and dismiss him from the case.  Alternatively, Respondent respectfully requests \nthat the Court sever Petitioner from this case and transfer the Alvarado Petition to Alvarado v. \nMoniz, No. 20-10309-PBS (D. Mass.). \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n              ANDREW E. LELLING, \n                                                   \nopinion in Jennings nor grappled with whether a habeas petitioner, after Jennings, may extrapolate \nand apply the holding in Mapp to a case, like this one, involving § 1226(c) detention.  For the \nreasons described in text above, Respondent submits that Petitioner may not do so.   \n10 E.g., Coughlin v.

The novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is spreading rapidly throughout the \nMassachusetts incarceration system.  The virus is highly contagious.  It has a multi-day \nincubation period during which an infected person shows no symptoms.  The virus can be \ntransmitted by asymptomatic people.  The only known measures to mitigate its spread are \nimpossible in communal living environments, including prisons and jails.  As the City of New \nYork Board of Correction has explained: “Given the nature of jails (e.g. dense housing areas and \nstructural barriers to social distancing, hygiene, and sanitation), the number of patients diagnosed \nwith COVID-19 is certain to rise exponentially.”1\t\n                                                 \n1 https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/boc/downloads/pdf/News/covid-19/Letter-from-BOC-re-NYC-\nJails-and-COVID-19-2020-03-21.pdf  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 2 of 21\n2.  COVID-19 has been detected within the Plymouth County Correctional Facility \n(the “PCCF”).  Multiple PCCF staff members have tested positive for the virus, as has at least \none prisoner.  The PCCF houses numerous civil immigration detainees in close quarters where \n“physical distancing,” avoiding shared surfaces and objects, and normal hygiene are impossible. \t\n3.  Petitioners Cleberson Quadrelli, Evens Dry, and Abdy Nizeyimana are civil \nimmigration detainees at the PCCF.   Mr. Dry and Mr. Nizeyimana have never been convicted of \nany crimes, and no final decision has been made as to whether or not they will be allowed to \nremain in the United States.  Mr. Quadrelli has no criminal record except for non-violent motor \nvehicle offenses that occurred roughly a decade ago, and has a Petition for Review pending \nbefore the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.        \t\n4.  To protect themselves, these detainees seek immediate release to a location where \nthey may safely self-isolate for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak.  Their release can be \nsubject to GPS monitoring and any other conditions that the Court deems appropriate.\t\nPARTIES\t\n5.  Petitioner Cleberson Quadrelli has been held in civil immigration detention since \nMay 2019.  He is currently detained at the PCCF in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  On information \nand belief, he is detained in Unit C-3 within the facility. \n6.  Petitioner Evens Dry has been held in civil immigration detention since July \n2019.  He is currently detained at the PCCF in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  On information and \nbelief, he is detained in Unit C-3 within the facility.   \n7.  Petitioner Abdy Nizeyimana has been held in civil immigration detainee since \nSeptember 2019.  He is currently detained at the PCCF in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  On \ninformation and belief, he is detained in Unit C-3 within the facility.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 3 of 21\n8.  Respondent Antone Moniz is the Superintendent of the Plymouth County \nCorrectional Facility and is petitioners’ immediate custodian.  He is sued in his official capacity \nonly.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  This Court has jurisdiction, including pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal \nquestion), 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (habeas jurisdiction), and Article I, Section 9, clause 2 of the United \nStates Constitution (the Suspension Clause). \n10.   Venue is proper because each petitioner is detained in Massachusetts. \nFACTS \nA. COVID-19 poses a grave risk of serious illness and death to everyone, and especially \nto people over 50 and those with certain medical conditions. \n11.  The novel coronavirus responsible for the illness COVID-19 has led to a global \npandemic.  As of May 5, 2020, according to the World Health Organization, more than 3.5 \nmillion people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 around the world and almost 250,000 have \n2 \ndied. In the United States alone, there are well over a million confirmed COVID-19 infections, \nresulting in nearly 70,000 deaths.3  In Massachusetts, there have been 69,087 confirmed cases, \nand more than 4,000 people have died in just the last month and a half.4  These numbers are \nlikely a substantial underestimate, due to the lack of availability of testing, as well as the \nmulti-day incubation period during which people are infected but asymptomatic.  \n                                                 \n2 https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 \n3 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html. \n4 https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-dashboard-may-4-2020/download.  The fatality rate over \nthe last 45 days in Massachusetts alone is roughly the equivalent of a commercial airline crash \noccurring every other day.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 4 of 21\n12.  The rates of infection are exponential, not linear, meaning that for each person \ninfected one day, the next day we should expect to see not one, but many more infections.  \n13.  The virus is transmitted through droplets and on contaminated surfaces. Airborne \ntransmission has also been documented.  The average incubation period (time from infection to \nsymptoms) has generally been reported to be around five days.  Both symptomatic and \nasymptomatic people can transmit the virus.   \n14.  Outcomes from COVID-19 vary from asymptomatic infection to death. In \nparticularly vulnerable populations, the fatality rate is about 15 percent—meaning about one out \nof every seven people in this group who contract the illness will die. An even higher percentage \nwill suffer serious illness. \n15.  Those who do not die may experience long-term harm. COVID-19 can severely \ndamage lung tissue, which requires an extensive period of rehabilitation, and in some cases, can \ncause a permanent loss of respiratory capacity.  \n16.  People over the age of 50 and those with certain medical conditions face elevated \nrisk of severe illness and death from COVID-19.  The medical conditions that increase the risk of \nserious COVID-19 disease include lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, chronic liver \nor kidney disease (including hepatitis and dialysis), diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension, \ncompromised immune systems (such as from cancer, HIV, or autoimmune disease), blood \ndisorders (including sickle cell disease), inherited metabolic disorders, stroke, developmental \ndelay, and pregnancy. \n17.  There is no approved and available vaccine to prevent contracting COVID-19.  \nThere is no known cure or anti-viral treatment for COVID-19 at this time.  The only way to \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 5 of 21\nprotect vulnerable people from serious health outcomes, including death, is to prevent them from \nbeing infected with the coronavirus. \n18.  Preventing infection currently requires steps such as “social distancing” (such as \nremaining physically separated from other people, and avoiding the use of shared objects and \nsurfaces) and vigilant hygiene (such as frequently washing or sanitizing the hands).  Distancing \nmust occur before individuals display symptoms, as they may be contagious before they are \nsymptomatic. \n19.  To reduce the spread of infection, state and federal governments have undertaken \nextraordinary measures to separate people and limit their interactions.  In Massachusetts, for \nexample, the Governor has declared a state of emergency, ordered the closure of all non-essential \nbusinesses, and prohibited gatherings of more than 10 people.5  The Governor also advised all \nresidents to stay home and avoid all unnecessary travel and activities.6   \n20.  Preventing COVID-19 is in the public interest.  People with COVID-19 often \nrequire intensive medical interventions, including hospitalization, use of a ventilator, and other \nlife support.  Consequently, an outbreak of COVID-19 cases in any discrete location—whether \nin a nursing home, university, or incarceration facility—presents a serious risk of overwhelming \nthe local medical resources upon which all residents rely. \n                                                 \n5 https://www.mass.gov/doc/march-23-2020-essential-services-and-revised-gatherings-\norder/download \n6 https://www.mass.gov/news/governor-charlie-baker-orders-all-non-essential-businesses-to-\ncease-in-person-operation \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 6 of 21\nB.  Detainees at PCCF are at high risk for COVID-19 infection. \n21.  At present, there is no way to adequately protect people from COVID-19 in \ncommunal living environments, particularly people who are medically vulnerable.  For example, \nnursing homes—where staff are trained to prevent the spread of communicable diseases—have \nbeen the sites of some of the largest concentrated outbreaks of COVID-19 in the United States.  \nMore than 50% of all COVID-19 deaths in Massachusetts have occurred among residents of \nlong-term care facilities.7 \n22.  Similarly, COVID-19 is spreading rapidly through the Massachusetts \nincarceration system.  To date, at least eight prisoners in Massachusetts state facilities have died \nfrom COVID-19. \n23.  In the Massachusetts Department of Correction (the “DOC”), the number of the \nincarcerated people who tested positive for COVID-19 has more than octupled in the last month,  \nincreasing from 40 to 351.   \n24.  COVID-19 is also spreading through the county Houses of Correction.  For \nexample, the number of positive cases in the Essex and Middlesex county sheriffs’ departments \n(prisoners and staff) has more than doubled over the last two weeks to more than 70 cases each.8 \n25.  The virus that causes COVID-19 is present in the PCCF.  Multiple PCCF staff \nmembers and at least one PCCF inmate have tested positive for COVID-19. \n                                                 \n7 https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-dashboard-may-4-2020/download. \n8 Real-time tracking available at: https://data.aclum.org/sjc-12926-tracker/. \nAdditionally, nationwide, more than 600 confirmed cases have been reported in ICE detention \nfacilities.  See https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus.  And the New York Times is currently tracking \nmore than 10,000 cases in state prisons and detention facilities.  See \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 7 of 21\n26.  People incarcerated at the PCCF live in close quarters and rely on shared spaces \nto eat, sleep, shower, and use the bathroom.  They cannot achieve the physical distancing needed \nto effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19.  Similarly, the intensive hygiene practices \nnecessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are impossible. \n27.  Immigration detainees at the PCCF are housed in several units, one of which is C-\n3.  Within each unit, people are held in cells with up to five bunks each.  The unit takes meals \ntogether in a common area located immediately outside the cells.  Although each cell has a toilet, \nthe entire unit shares a communal bathroom, including several shared showers.  The living area \ncontains many metallic and plastic surfaces that detainees touch and breathe on, and as to which \nconstant disinfection is impracticable.  Correctional officers and staff rotate in and out of the \nunit.  Detainees also regularly rotate in and out of the unit as they are arrested, released, or \ndeported. \n28.  These conditions and the shared objects (furniture, bathrooms, sinks, etc.) \nincrease the likelihood that COVID-19 will spread rapidly across the facility, infecting \nvulnerable detainees.  \nC. People must be released from ICE detention. \n29.  Because risk mitigation is the only known strategy that can protect people from \nCOVID-19, public health experts with experience in immigration detention and correctional \nsettings have recommended the release of detainees from custody.  \n30.  Recognizing these grave risks, courts have begun issuing orders requiring or \nurging the release of incarcerated people.  In Massachusetts, the U.S. District Court recently \nordered that an immigration detainee be released from the PCCF based on the “extraordinary \ncircumstances” arising from the coronavirus pandemic.  See Ex. A (Memorandum and Order \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 8 of 21\n(D.E. 507), Calderon Jimenez v. Wolf, No. 18-10225-MLW (D. Mass. Mar. 25, 2020)).  The \ncourt has also certified a class of all civil immigration detainees held at the Bristol County House \nof Correction, and has ordered the interim release of dozens of detainees during the pendency of \nthat action. See generally Savino v. Souza, No. 20-10617, 2020 WL 1703844 (D. Mass. Apr. 8, \n2020) (“Savino Order”).  And in New Hampshire, the U.S. District Court has similarly \nprovisionally certified a class of immigration detainees and is considering expedited applications \nfor interim release.  See generally Gomes v. DHS, No. 20-453, 2020 WL 2113642 (D.N.H. May \n4, 2020).   \n31.  Similarly, the U.S. Court of the Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently ordered the \nrelease of an immigrant from ICE detention in light of the dangers posed by the COVID-19 \ncrisis. See, e.g., Xochihua-Jaimes v. Barr, No. 18-71460, 2020 WL 1429877 (9th Cir. Mar. 24, \n2020) (Order) (“[I]n light of the rapidly escalating public health crisis, which public health \nauthorities predict will especially impact immigration detention centers, the court sua sponte \norders that Petitioner be immediately released from detention and that removal of Petitioner be \nstayed pending final disposition by this court.”).  Other U.S. District Courts have issued orders \nrequiring that immigration detainees be released in light of the coronavirus pandemic.  See, e.g., \nA.R. v. Decker, No. 20-3600 (D.N.J. Apr. 12, 2020); Bent v. Barr, No. 19-CV-06123, 2020 WL \n1812850 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 9, 2020); Ortuno v. Jennings, No. 3:20-cv-02064-MMC, Dkt. No. 38 \n(N.D. Cal. Apr. 8, 2020); Toma v.

Similarly, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court recently established a \nrebuttable presumption of release for most pre-trial detainees accused of crimes, particularly \nthose with medical vulnerabilities.  See Slip Opinion, Committee for Public Counsel Services v. \nChief Justice of the Trial Court, No. SJC-12926, at 29-30 (Apr. 3, 2020).  And the Chief Justice \nof the Montana Supreme Court recently urged judges to “review your jail rosters and release, \nwithout bond, as many prisoners as you are able, especially those being held for non-violent \noffenses.”9  The Chief Justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court ordered that everyone held \non bond in a non-capital case be released, unless there exists an “unreasonable danger” or \n                                                 \n9 See Letter from Mike McGrath, Chief Justice of Montana Supreme Court, to Montana Courts \nof Limited Jurisdiction Judges (Mar. 20, 2020), https://courts.mt.gov/ \nPortals/189/virus/Ltr%20to%20COLJ%20Judges%20re%20COVID-19%20032020.pdf?ver= \n2020-03-20-115517-333 (emphasis added). \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 10 of 21\n“extreme flight risk.”10  And in New Jersey, after the Supreme Court ordered briefing and \nargument on why it should not order the immediate release of individuals serving county jail \nsentences, the Attorney General and County Prosecutors agreed to create an immediate \npresumption of release for every person serving a county jail sentence in New Jersey.11  Many \nother courts have taken similar steps, recognizing that public safety means ensuring the public’s \nhealth.12  \nD. Petitioners should be immediately released to a location where they can safely \nself-isolate under whatever conditions and supervision the Court deems \nappropriate. \n33.  Petitioner Cleberson Quadrelli has been held in civil immigration detention since \nMay 2019.  He is currently detained at the PCCF in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  On information \nand belief, he is detained in Unit C-3 within the facility.  Mr. Quadrelli has no criminal record \nexcept for non-violent motor vehicle offenses that occurred roughly a decade ago.  He is \ncurrently seeking to re-open his removal proceedings on the grounds of legal error that resulted \nin the denial of his eligibility for cancellation of removal.  He currently has a Petition for Review \npending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit where the legal issue regarding his \neligibility will be addressed.  His removal is presently stayed by court order. \n                                                 \n10 Memo from Chief Justice Beatty to Magistrates, Municipal Judges, and Summary Court Staff \n(Mar. 16, 2020), https://www.sccourts.org/whatsnew/displayWhatsNew.cfm?indexId=2461. \n11  See https://www.aclu-nj.org/files/5415/8496/4744/2020.03.22_-\n_Consent_Order_Filed_Stamped_Copy-1.pdf; \nhttps://www.njcourts.gov/public/assets/COVIDproposedOTSC.pdf?c=PkD \n \n12 See Appendix: Court Actions Across the Country to Reduce Incarceration in Light of Covid-\n19.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 11 of 21\n34.  Petitioner Evens Dry has been held in civil immigration detention since July \n2019.  He is currently detained at the PCCF in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  On information and \nbelief, he is detained in Unit C-3 within the facility.  Mr. Dry has never been convicted of a \ncrime.   \n35.  Petitioner Abdy Nizeyimana has been held in civil immigration detainee since \nSeptember 2019.  He is currently detained at the PCCF in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  On \ninformation and belief, he is detained in Unit C-3 within the facility.  Mr. Nizeyimana has never \nbeen convicted of a crime. \n36.  Continued detention in the PCCF puts petitioners at high risk of severe illness and \ndeath from COVID-19. \nLEGAL FRAMEWORK \nA. Petitioners are entitled to constitutional due process protections against infectious \ndisease and death while detained. \n \n37.  The Eighth Amendment requires that “inmates be furnished with the basic human \nneeds, one of which is ‘reasonable safety.’” Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993) \n(quoting DeShaney v. Winnebago Cty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 200 (1989)).  \nAccordingly, “[i]t would be odd to deny an injunction to inmates who plainly proved an unsafe, \nlife-threatening condition in their prison on the ground that nothing yet had happened to them.” \nId.  The Supreme Court has explicitly recognized that the risk of contracting a communicable \ndisease may constitute such an “unsafe, life-threatening condition” that threatens “reasonable \nsafety.”  Id. \n38.  Immigration detainees, even those with prior criminal convictions, are civil \ndetainees held pursuant to civil immigration laws.  Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001). \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 12 of 21\n39.  For pretrial and civil detainees, due process “provides at least as much protection \n. . . as the Eighth Amendment provides for convicted inmates.”  Ruiz-Rosa v. Rullan, 485 F.3d \n150, 155 (1st Cir. 2007) (emphasis added); accord Gaudreault v. Municipality of Salem, 923 \nF.2d 203, 208 (1st Cir. 1990).  Indeed, civil detainees, like petitioners here, are entitled to \nconditions of confinement that are superior to those of convicted prisoners.  See Alves v. Murphy, \n530 F. Supp. 2d 380, 387 (D. Mass. 2008); see also King v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 885 F.3d 548, \n557 (9th Cir. 2018); Jones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, 933-34 (9th Cir. 2004).   \n40.  Consequently, under the Due Process Clause, pretrial and civil detainees, like \npetitioners, may not be subject to conditions that amount to punishment, including conditions \nthat fail to “reasonably relate[] to a legitimate governmental objective.”  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. \n520, 539 (1979); accord Lyons v. Powell, 838 F.2d 28, 29 (1st Cir. 1988).  Accordingly, the First \nCircuit has found that, at a minimum, detention conditions are unconstitutional where they: \n(1) objectively deny a minimal measure of necessities required for civilized living; and (2) are \nimposed with deliberate indifference to inmate health or safety.  Surprenant v. Rivas, 424 F.3d 5, \n18-19 (1st Cir. 2005); Reaves v. Dep’t of Corr., 333 F. Supp. 3d 18, 26 (D. Mass. 2018); \nCouchon v. Cousins, No. 17-10965, 2018 WL 4189694, at *6 (D. Mass. Aug. 31, 2018).   \n41.  Additionally, the Due Process Clause protects detainees, like petitioners, not only \nfrom conduct amounting to deliberate indifference, but also from objectively unreasonable \nconduct that creates a risk to their safety.  See Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2472-73 \n(2015); Miranda v. Cty. of Lake, 900 F.3d 335, 352 (7th Cir. 2018); Gordon v. Cty. of Orange, \n888 F.3d 1118, 1120, 1122-25 (9th Cir. 2018).  The language of Kingsley is broad—applying not \nonly to use of excessive force by the government, but to government action generally, including \nactions involving medical treatment.  See Gordon, 888 F.3d at 1124; see also Couchon, 2018 \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 13 of 21\nWL 4189694, at *6 (noting that there is “much to be said” for the reasoning that extends \nKingsley to conditions of confinement cases). \n42.  Regardless, under either the objective unreasonableness or deliberate indifference \nstandard, petitioners should succeed on the merits of their claim.  As a court in this district \nrecently explained, “the virus is gravely dangerous to all of us,” and that harm is “more serious \nfor some petitioners than for others.”  See Savino Order at 21.   \n43.  Further, to the extent relevant, it also clear that there are substitute measures that \ncan achieve community safety and petitioners’ future appearance, absent continued detention.  \nThe Court can order release subject to home confinement, GPS monitoring, and other conditions \nthat the Court deems appropriate.   \n44.  But in all events, because the government has actual knowledge of the impending, \npreventable, and extreme risks that COVID-19 poses to petitioners (including death), their \nrelease is required under due process principles.  \nB.  Release is the only relief that can adequately protect petitioners. \n \n45.  COVID-19 poses a serious risk to petitioners.  It is highly contagious and can \ncause severe illness and death.  \n46.  The risk that COVID-19 poses to petitioners is known to Respondent.  \n47.  Petitioners’ continued detention in the absence of appropriate or sufficient care \nand protection constitutes deliberate indifference and is objectively unreasonable.   \n48.  Medical experts for the Department of Homeland Security have also identified the \nrisk of COVID-19 spreading to ICE detention centers.  As early as February 25, 2020, Dr. Scott \nAllen and Dr. Josiah Rich, medical experts to the Department of Homeland Security, shared \nconcerns about the specific risk to immigrant detainees as a result of COVID-19 with the agency. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 14 of 21\nThese experts warned of the danger of rapid spread of COVID-19 in immigration detention \nfacilities.  In a letter to Congress, Dr. Allen and Dr. Rich recommended that “[m]inimally, DHS \nshould consider releasing all detainees in high risk medical groups such as older people and \nthose with chronic diseases.”  They concluded that “acting immediately will save lives not of \nonly those detained, but also detention staff and their families, and the community-at-large.”13  \n49.  John Sandweg, a former acting director of ICE, has written publicly about the \nneed to release nonviolent detainees because ICE detention centers “are extremely susceptible to \noutbreaks of infectious diseases” and “preventing the virus from being introduced into these \nfacilities is impossible.”14  Prisons and jails around the country are already releasing non-violent \ndetainees because the risk of contagion is overwhelming.  The circumstances of this case make \nclear that release is the only means to ensure compliance with the petitioners’ due process rights.  \nPublic health information makes clear that the only way to prevent infection is through social \ndistancing and increased hygiene, and that these measures are most imperative to protect \nindividuals with underlying medical conditions.  The only course of action that can remedy these \nunlawful conditions is release from the detention centers where risk mitigation is impossible. \nC. ICE has the authority to release detained people in its custody.  \n50.  It is well within ICE’s authority to comply with these constitutional requirements \nby releasing people who are vulnerable to severe illness or death if they contract COVID-19.  \n                                                 \n13 Letter from Scott A. Allen, MD, FACP, and Josiah Rich, MD, MPH, to House and Senate \nCommittees on Homeland Security (Mar. 19, 2020), https://whistleblower.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/Drs.-Allen-and-Rich-3.20.2020-Letter-to-Congress.pdf. \n \n14 See John Sandweg, “I Used to Run ICE. We Need to Release the Nonviolent Detainees.” The \nAtlantic (Mar. 22, 2020), https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/release-ice-\ndetainees/608536/. \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 15 of 21\nFor example, the regulations governing ICE’s release authority state that serious medical \nconditions are a reason to parole an individual, as “continued detention would not be \nappropriate” in such cases. 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(b)(1).  \n51.  ICE not only has the authority to exercise discretion to release individuals from \ncustody, but has routinely exercised this discretion to release particularly vulnerable detainees \nlike some of the class members. \nD. This Court has the authority to order preliminary release pending resolution of this \npetition under the principles of Mapp v. Reno. \n \n52.  During the pendency of this action, the Court should order petitioners’ interim \nrelease under the principles of Mapp v. Reno, 241 F.3d 221, 223 (2d Cir. 2001).  Under Mapp, a \ncourt may order a habeas petitioner released on an interim basis after “inquir[ing] into whether \n‘the habeas petition raise[s] substantial claims and [whether] extraordinary circumstances exist[ ] \nthat make the grant of bail necessary to make the habeas remedy effective.’” Id. at 230 (quoting \nIuteri v. Nardoza, 662 F.2d 159, 161 (2d Cir. 1981)) (alterations in original).15  Courts in this \ndistrict and others have recently applied Mapp and its First Circuit analogues to order pre-\njudgment release for immigration detainees challenging their detention in light of the COVID-19 \npandemic.  See, e.g., Savino Order at 27-28; Avendaño Hernandez v. Decker, No. 20-CV-1589 \n(JPO), 2020 WL 1547459, at *2-*4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 1, 2020); Calderon Jimenez v. Wolf, No. \n18-10225-MLW (D. Mass. Mar. 26, 2020) (Ex. A).   \n                                                 \n15 Whereas Mapp required only that the petitioner raise “substantial claims” on the merits, the \nFirst Circuit – considering a habeas petition from a convicted state prisoner – articulated a higher \nstandard.  See Glynn v. Donnelly, 470 F.2d 95, 98 (1st Cir. 1972).  However, the First Circuit’s \ntest should not extend to immigration detainees, who retain the presumption of innocence, and \n“the Mapp test or something similar or perhaps less is appropriate” in the immigration context.  \nJimenez v. Wolf, No. 18-10225-MLW, Memorandum & Order, ECF No. 507 (D. Mass. Mar. 26, \n2020) at 1-2.; see also Savino Order at 27-28 n.11. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 16 of 21\n53.  Here, as in those cases, this “nightmarish pandemic” constitutes “exceptional \ncircumstances,” and petitioners have raised “substantial claims” that their detention is \nunconstitutional in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Savino Order at 27-28 & n.11.16  Habeas \nwill not be an effective remedy for them if they are no longer alive.   \n54.  This Court should therefore order petitioners’ interim release while the Court \nconsiders and resolves this matter. \nE.   This Court has the authority to order release as a final remedy. \n55.  “[H]abeas corpus is, at its core, an equitable remedy,” Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. \n298, 319 (1995), and “[f]ederal courts possess whatever powers are necessary to remedy \nconstitutional violations because they are charged with protecting these rights.”  Stone v. City & \nCty. of San Francisco, 968 F.2d 850, 861 (9th Cir. 1992).  As a result, “[w]hen necessary to \nensure compliance with a constitutional mandate, courts may enter orders placing limits on a \nprison’s population.”  Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 511 (2011); see also 28 U.S.C. § 2243; \nBoumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723, 779-80 (2008) (explaining that “common-law habeas corpus \nwas, above all an adaptable remedy,” that the “habeas court’s role was most extensive in cases of \npretrial and noncriminal detention,” and that “when the judicial power to issue habeas corpus \nproperly is invoked the judicial officer must have adequate authority . . . to formulate and issue \nappropriate orders for relief, including, if necessary, an order directing the prisoner’s release”). \n56.  Courts have regularly exercised this authority to remedy constitutional violations \ncaused by overcrowding.  See, e.g., Duran v. Elrod, 713 F.2d 292, 297-98 (7th Cir. 1983) \n                                                 \n16 As this Court observed in the Savino order, a petitioner’s challenge to detention in light of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic “would also satisfy a more exacting standard” like the one articulated by \nthe First Circuit in Glynn.  See Savino Order at 28 n.11.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 17 of 21\n(concluding that court did not exceed its authority in directing release of low-bond pretrial \ndetainees as necessary to reach a population cap). \n57.  The same principle applies here.  As the constitutional principles and public \nhealth experts make clear, releasing petitioners is the only viable remedy to ensure their safety.  \nThe Court may condition that release on the use of GPS monitoring and any other conditions it \nconsiders appropriate. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n58.  The foregoing allegations are re-alleged and incorporated herein. \n59.  Petitioners seek to represent a class defined as all civil immigration detainees who \nare petitioners in this action (i.e., who signed the original Petition (D.E. 1)) or are otherwise \npresently detained in unit C-3 at the PCCF.  The members of the class are readily ascertainable \nthrough the Courts’ and the respondents’ records. \n60.  Petitioners bring this action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and \n(b)(2) on behalf of themselves and all other similarly-situated persons within the proposed class \nas defined above. \n61.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  According \nto records produced by respondent, there are at least 42 members of the class. \n62.  There are multiple questions of law and fact common to the members of the \nproposed class, including whether, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the petitioners’ continued \ncivil detention at the PCCF violates their Fifth Amendment rights such that they should be \nreleased. \n63.  Petitioners’ claims are typical of the claims of the proposed class, and petitioners \nwill fairly and adequately protect the interests of the proposed class. Petitioners’ interests do not \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 18 of 21\nconflict with those of other members of the proposed class, and petitioners have retained \ncompetent counsel experienced in class actions and immigration law. \n64.  Moreover, certification is appropriate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(b)(2) because class members are subject to a common practice by respondent.  Every member \nof the class is at imminent risk of being infected by COVID-19 while in the custody of \nrespondent.  And, because every member of the class is entitled to relief from this \nunconstitutional detention, an appropriate injunction or declaration will provide relief on a \nclass-wide basis. \nCLAIM FOR RELIEF \nCount I: Violation of Fifth Amendment Right to Due Process \n65.  The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution guarantees that civil detainees, \nincluding all immigrant detainees, may not be subjected to punishment.  The federal government \nviolates this substantive due process right when it subjects civil detainees to cruel treatment and \nconditions of confinement that amount to punishment or when it does not ensure those detainees’ \nsafety and health. \n66.  The confinement of the petitioners and class members subjects them to a \nheightened and unacceptable risk of contracting COVID-19, for which there is no vaccine or \ncure.  Respondent, acting unreasonably and with deliberate indifference, is subjecting petitioners \nand the class members to a substantial risk of serious harm, in violation of their rights under the \nDue Process Clause.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE petitioners request that the Court immediately grant the following relief:  \na.  Certify a class defined as: All civil immigration detainees who are petitioners in \nthis action or are otherwise presently detained in unit C-3 at the PCCF. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10685-ADB   Document 119   Filed 05/26/20   Page 19 of 21\n \nb.  Name the proposed class representatives as representatives of the class and \nappoint their counsel as class counsel. \n   \nc.  Order the petitioners’ and class members’ immediate interim release pending the \nCourt’s consideration and resolution of this matter, including pursuant to Mapp v. \nReno;  \n \nd.  Declare that the petitioners and class members are entitled to release, with \nappropriate conditions and precautionary public health measures. \n \ne.  Issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus or other suitable order for injunctive relief and \norder petitioners’ and class members’ immediate release, with appropriate \nconditions and precautionary public health measures; \n \nf.  Grant any other and further relief that this Court may deem fit and proper. \n \n \nDated: May 26, 2020         /s/ Daniel L. McFadden \n \nWm. Shaw McDermott (BBO # 330860) \nAndrew C.
