The state's requirements provide that one method for obtaining ballot access is submitting a petition with signatures equal to 1% of the votes cast in the preceding Presidential election in Alaska at least 90 days prior to the general election. The plaintiffs argued that this signature requirements violated their First Amendment Rights to free speech, expression, and association, which are incorporated to apply to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>In their complaint, the plaintiffs requested declaratory relief that the ballot access laws in the state were unconstitutional. They also requested an injunction to prohibit the enforcement of the ballot access laws and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge John W. Sedwick.</p>\r\n<p>On June 11, 2020, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. They requested that the court either reduce or eliminate the petition requirement, or extend the 90 day deadline. In their motion, the plaintiffs suggested a signature threshold of 20% of the normal threshold, or equal to 0.2% of the votes cast in the 2016 Presidential Election.</p>\r\n<p>On July 10, 2020, Judge Sedwick submitted an order that he was likely to deny the motion for a preliminary injunction. The court remarked that the purpose of this order was to give the plaintiffs an opportunity to increase their signature gathering efforts and noted that signature gathering efforts had not been made in many highly populated areas or had been targeted to registered Libertarian voters.</p>\r\n<p>On July 13, 2020, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case.

It  appears  that  the  court  is  likely  to  deny  the  motion \nin  light  of  the  showing  made  by  Plaintiff  as  to  the  burden  presented  by  the  signature \ngathering  requirements,  as  well  as  recent  cases  addressing  this  issue  in  similar \ncircumstances.  An  order  with  a  final  decision  and  analysis  will  be  forthcoming,  but  the \ncourt  informs  the  parties  of  its  initial  position  so  Plaintiff's  signature  gathering  efforts \nmight  be  increased.

Plaintiff Jon Watts, is the duly elected Chair of the ALP, and a qualified voter and \nregistered voter in Alaska. \n3.  Defendant Gail Fenumiai is the duly appointed Director of Elections, who is the chief \nelections officer ofthe state pursuant to A.S. 15.80.110(4) and A.S. 15.10.105.  She is \nsued in her official capacity only. \n4.  Defendant Kevin Meyer is the duly elected Lt. Governor of Alaska, and who, pursuant to \nA.S. 15.10.105(a), controls and supervises the Division of elections. \n5.  Collectively, Defendants Meyer and Fenumiai actively enforce and administer the Alaska \nelection laws challenged herein, and are statutorily charged with this enforcement and \nadministration. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  Subject matter jurisdiction over the claims and causes of action asserted by Plaintiffs in \nthis action is conferred on this Court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988, 28 \nU.S.C. ยง1331, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1343,28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202, and other applicable law. \n7.  Venue in this District and division is proper, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 and other \napplicable law, because all of the deprivations of Plaintiffs' Constitutional Rights \noccurred in boroughs within this District, and future deprivations oftheir Constitutional \nRights are threatened and likely to occur in this District. \nBackground \n8.  There are three methods for a political party to obtain party ballot access insofar as the \nPresidential race is concerned: \na.  first, that they be recognized as a \"political party\" under A.S. 15.80.1 0(27) by \nachieving 3% of the vote in the preceding Governor's race, or, ifthat race is not \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DEC LARA TORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nAlaska Libertarian Party et al.  v.

Prior to 2016, the ALP qualified as a political party, because its 2014 Gubernatorial \ncandidate received more than 3% of the vote for Governor. \n10. In 2016, the ALP retained party status, because its candidate for United States Senate \nreceived 90,825 votes, or 29.16% ofthe vote. \n11. Also in 2016, the total votes cast at the preceding Presidential election in Alaska, which \nwas 2016, was 318,608.  The Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson, received 18,725 (or \n5.88%). \n12. The total votes cast at the preceding Governor's election in Alaska, which was in 2018, \nwas 283,134 votes, and the Libertarian candidate in that race, William Toien, received \n5,402 (or 1.91 %).  This caused the ALP to lose its party status. \nThe 2020 Election Cycle \n13. In early 2020, COVID-19 hit the United States, creating a significant public health crisis. \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nAlaska Libertarian Party eta!.  v.

Among other things, public libraries, museums, and archives were closed on \nMarch 16, 2020; bars, breweries, restaurants, food and beverage kiosks or trucks, and \nother establishments serving food or beverages within the State of Alaska were closed to \nthe public for dine-in service on March 17, 2020; distancing measures were ordered for \npersons who traveled outside of Alaska on March 17, 2020; elective medical procedures \nwere postponed on March 19, 2020; business, congregations, or gatherings in the \nFairbanks North Star Borough and the Ketchikan Gateway Borough were cancelled on \nMarch 21, 2020; all schools were cancelled on March 20, 2020; a social distancing/stay at \nhome order was issued March 28, 2020; and an intrastate travel ban was put into place \nMarch 28, 2020. \n15. On Friday April24, 2020, Alaska began a phased re-opening plan.  That plan required \nsocial distancing between persons who are not of the same household. \n16. As of May 22, 2020, Alaska began additional re-opening procedures, but still strongly \nencouraged social distancing and the wearing of masks.2  The May 22, 2020 re-opening \norders are the currently applicable orders.3 \n17. In 2020, the Libertarian Party nominated its candidates for President and Vice President \nthe weekend of May 22, 2020 through May 24, 2020, via an online convention for the \n1 See https://covid19.alaska.gov/health-mandates/ (last visited 5/29/2020).  The Court can take \njudicial notice of all ofthese public declarations.  Anderson v.

Gail Fenumiai, eta!., No. 3 :20-cv-___  \nPAGE4 \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 1   Filed 06/03/20   Page 4 of 10\n\nfirst time in its history in light of CO VID-19.  The selection of these candidates is the \nprecursor to ballot access efforts in many states, since fundraising occurs in connection \nwith the nomination.  Those ballot access fundraising efforts have been, and continue to \nbe, depressed due to COVID-19.  Dr. Jo Jorgensen, and Spike Cohen were selected as the \nnominees for President and Vice President, respectively. \n18. The Libertarian National Committee and the ALP engaged a local signature gatherer, \nScott Kohlhaas, to lead the petition and signature gathering drive in Alaska. \n19. Mr. Kohlhaas began that effort approximately two weeks ago, to secure Limited Party \nStatus for the ALP, and to place the Jorgensen/Cohen ticket, and the ALP electors, on the \nballot for 2020. \n20. Mr. Jon Watts, the ALP Chair, likewise sought concessions from the Defendants in light \nof COVID-19; for their part, the Defendants offered to permit the ALP to gather \nsignatures via an online method. \n21. The ALP sought additional concessions from Defendants, including a reduction of the \nsignature requirement, or an extension of the time to petition, but Defendants have \nrefused, instead placing Plaintiffs, and the general public, at additional risk to the spread \nof COVID-19 through petition gathering efforts. \n22. Further, despite having attempted to do so via its website, email list, and other methods, \nthe ALP has gathered less than 50 signatures via online canvassing of voters in the last 60 \ndays. \n23. Regular venues for the gathering and collection of signatures are shut down or severely \ncurtailed. \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DEC LARA TORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nAlaska Libertarian Party et al  v. Gail Fenumiai, eta!., No. 3:20-cv-___  \nPAGES \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 1   Filed 06/03/20   Page 5 of 10\n\n24. People that Mr. Kohlhaas and other petitioners have approached for signatures are \nappropriately apprehensive to sign a petition in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. \n25. Mr. Kohlhaas, on May 28, 2020, petitioned for 3.5 hours (3 PM to 6:30PM) in front of \nthe Carrs grocery store in Eagle River, Alaska, which is part of the Municipality of \nAnchorage (MOA).  Working only on a Libertarian Limited Political Party petition, he \ngathered 56 signatures in that time, which is 16 signatures per hour.  Normally, he would \ngather closer to 35 signatures per hour at that same location during a \"dinner hour\" shift \nwhich is the most heavily trafficked.  People have displayed observable cues that they are \nnot comfortable beirtg approached with the outbreak ofCOVID-19. \n26. For a successful petition drive of3,212 valid signatures, normally the ALP would gather \n30% to 40% above that threshold, or approximately 5,000 \"raw\" signatures, to account \nfor invalid signatures. \n27. Also, for Kohlhaas and the other petition gatherers, it is physically far more difficult to \npetition while wearing a mask and petitioners took breaks to use hand sanitizer every 15 \nor 20 minutes. \n28. Kohlhaas and the ALP have hired eight other people to help gather signatures in Alaska. \nPetition team recruitment and retention right now is very difficult in light ofCOVID-19. \nThe results they have seen have been terrible.  They gathered 149 signatures over the last \n10 days to 2 weeks.  In a typical year, they would expect at least 1,000 per week for this \nsize team, in this same period. \n29. Overall, based on the longtime experience gathering signatures of Mr. Kohlhaas and \nothers, it is over five times as hard to gather signatures right now, and, the Alaska \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DEC LARA TORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nAlaska Libertarian Party eta!.  v.

Finally, Plaintiff Watts delivered paperwork to Defendant Fenumiai, without the required \n1% of signatures appended to it for limited party status, and Defendant Fenumiai  refused \nto accept the same to place the Libertarian Party's 2020 Presidential and Vice \nPresidential ticket and electors on the ballot as a limited party. \nCOUNT I-Violation of 42 U.S.C. 1983 (First and Fourteenth Amendment) \n31. Plaintiffs reincorporate the preceding paragraphs as if fully written herein. \n32. Defendants, using their respective offices and acting under color of state law, violated \nand are violating. Plaintiffs' First Amendment Rights, which have deprived, are depriving, \nand will deprive them of their rights to Free Speech, Expression, and Association \nguaranteed to them under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which rights are \nclearly established; as well as their rights to Equal Protection of Law under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  Defendants thereby subjected \nthemselves under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, to prospective injunctive relief and declaratory relief \nunder 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201, et seq. \n33. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides, in relevant part, that \"Congress \nshall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech ... \"  The Fourteenth Amendment \nhas incorporated the First Amendment to apply to the states, including the State of \nAlaska, under Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652 (1925). \n34. Defendants abused the authority of their respective offices and, while acting under color \nof law and with knowledge of Plaintiffs' established rights, used their offices to violate \ntheir First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DEC LARA TORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nAlaska Libertarian Party eta!.  v.

In the past two months, numerous federal courts have addressed what are typically \nreasonable or at least moderately burdensome but appropriate ballot access or voting \nrequirements, which have become unreasonable and oppressive in light of the COVID-19 \noutbreak.  Esshaki v.  Whitmer, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 14376 (6th Cir. 2020) (concluding \npetition gathering with the presence of CO VID-19 and state orders regarding same \ncreated a severe burden and ordering relief); Libertarian Party ofI ll. v. Pritzker, 2020 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 71563 (ILND 2020) (order permitting previously qualified parties and \nloosening the signature requirements in light of insurmountable hurdle of COVID-19); \nGarbett v. Herbert, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75853 (Dist. Utah, 2020) (reducing signature \nrequirements in light of COVID-19 outbreak); Democratic Nat'l Comm. v. Bostelmann, \n2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48394,2020 WL 1320819 (W.O. Wis. 2020) (extending deadline \nin light of \"excruciating dilemma that will soon be faced by eligible voters ... [to] either \nventure into public spaces, contrary to public directives and health guidelines or stay at \nhome and lose the opportunity to vote.\"). \n36. Under the prevailing U.S. Supreme Court cases of Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 760 \n(1983) and Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428 (1992), the burden is severe, or at least is \nmore than minimal, requiring either strict scrutiny or the flexible approach.  In either \nevent, relief is appropriate to: (a) lower the 1% threshold; and/or (b) extend the deadline \nfor the submission of the ALP petition. \n3 7. Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief, and prospective injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \nand 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202, declaring the challenged Alaska ballot access laws \nunconstitutional as applied, in contravention of the First and Fourteenth Amendments of \nVERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DEC LARA TORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nAlaska Libertarian Party eta!.  v.

Plaintiffs further seek their costs and reasonable attorney \nfees under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs demand judgment against Defendants as prayed for, including: \nA.  That this Court issue a declaration that the 1% \"limited political party\" status under A.S. \n15.30.025, by submitting a petition with signatures equal to 1% of the votes cast in the \npreceding Presidential election in Alaska at least 90 days before the general election are \nunconstitutional as applied to these Plaintiffs, in these circumstances, in contravention of \nthe First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States. \nB.  That this Court enter permanent injunctive relief to prohibit enforcement of the \nchallenged ballot access laws under such circumstances or subject to such conditions as \nthis Court finds just and proper. \nC.  That Plaintiffs be awarded their costs in this action, including reasonable attorney fees \nunder 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988; and \nD.

Introduction \n  Plaintiffs, the Alaska Libertarian Party (โALPโ) and Jon Watts, by and through Counsel, \nmove this Court for a preliminary injunction under FRCP 65, enjoining defendants from \nenforcing A.S. 15.30.025 as to them, in this election cycle.  They challenge the signature \ngathering requirements in the middle of a global pandemic.  In support, they rely on the verified \nComplaint, verified by Mr. Watts in this matter, and upon the declaration of Scott Kohlhaas. \n  The petition deadline for their Presidential ticket is August 5, 2020.  Plaintiffs \nrespectfully request emergency relief either: (i) reducing or eliminating that requirement, \nand/or (ii) extending the deadline.  The harm is ongoing:  Plaintiffs continue to attempt to \ncomply with the statutory signature gathering requirements by attempting to gather signatures \n(with limited success) in the middle of a global pandemic. \nII.  Facts \nThere are three methods for a political party to obtain party ballot access insofar as the \nPresidential race is concerned: first, that they be recognized as a โpolitical partyโ under A.S. \n15.80.10(27) by achieving 3% of the vote in the preceding Governorโs race, or, if that race is not \non the ballot, the United States Senate race is used, and if that race is not on the ballot, then the \nUnited States House race is used; second, that they be recognized as a โpolitical partyโ under \nA.S. 15.80.10(27) by having registered voters equal to 3% of the vote in the preceding \nGovernorโs race; or third, that they obtain โlimited political partyโ status under A.S. 15.30.025, \nby submitting a petition with signatures equal to 1% of the votes cast in the preceding \nPresidential election in Alaska at least 90 days before the general election (and then maintaining \nthat status with votes equal to 3% of the number of votes cast in the next election for President) \nunder A.S. 15.30.025.  (Pl.โs Verified Compl, RE#1, ยถ8). \n2 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 5   Filed 06/11/20   Page 2 of 12\n\nPrior to 2016, the ALP qualified as a political party, because its 2014 Gubernatorial \ncandidate received more than 3% of the vote for Governor.  Id. at ยถ9.  In 2016, the ALP retained \nparty status, because its candidate for United States Senate received 90,825 votes, or 29.16% of \nthe vote.  Id. at ยถ10.   \nAlso in 2016, the total votes cast at the preceding Presidential election in Alaska, which \nwas 2016, was 318,608.  Id. at ยถ11.  The Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson, received 18,725 \n(or 5.88%).  Id.  The total votes cast at the preceding Governorโs election in Alaska, which was \nin 2018, was 283,134 votes, and the Libertarian candidate in that race, William Toien, received \n5,402 votes (or 1.91%).  Id. at ยถ12.  This caused the ALP to lose its party status.  Id. \nThe 2020 Election Cycle \nIn early 2020, COVID-19 hit the United States, creating a significant public health crisis.  \nId. at ยถ13.  In the same period, starting on March 11, 2020, with Governor Dunleavyโs public \ndeclaration of emergency, the State of Alaska began issuing a number of public health \nmandates.1  Id. at ยถ14.  Among other things, public libraries, museums, and archives were closed \non March 16, 2020; bars, breweries, restaurants, food and beverage kiosks or trucks, and other \nestablishments serving food or beverages within the State of Alaska were closed to the public for \ndine-in service on March 17, 2020; distancing measures were ordered for persons who traveled \noutside of Alaska on March 17, 2020; elective medical procedures were postponed on March 19, \n2020; business, congregations, or gatherings in the Fairbanks North Star Borough and the \nKetchikan Gateway Borough were cancelled on March 21, 2020; all schools were cancelled on \n \n1 See https://covid19.alaska.gov/health-mandates/ (last visited 5/29/2020).  The Court can take \njudicial notice of all of these public declarations.  Anderson v. Holder, 673 F.3d 1089, 1094 n.1 \n(9th Cir. 2012) \n3 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 5   Filed 06/11/20   Page 3 of 12\n\nMarch 20, 2020; a social distancing/stay at home order was issued March 28, 2020; and an \nintrastate travel ban was put into place March 28, 2020.  Id. \nOn Friday April 24, 2020, Alaska began a phased re-opening plan.  That plan required \nsocial distancing between persons who are not of the same household.  Id. at ยถ15.  As of May 22, \n2020, Alaska began additional re-opening procedures, but still strongly encouraged social \ndistancing and the wearing of masks.2  Id. at ยถ16.  The May 22, 2020 re-opening orders are the \ncurrently applicable orders.3  Id. \nIn 2020, the Libertarian Party nominated its candidates for President and Vice President \nthe weekend of May 22, 2020 through May 24, 2020, via an online convention for the first time \nin its history in light of COVID-19.  Id. at ยถ17.    The selection of these candidates is the \nprecursor to ballot access efforts in many states, since fundraising occurs in connection with the \nnomination.  Id.  Those ballot access fundraising efforts have been, and continue to be, depressed \ndue to COVID-19.  Dr. Jo Jorgensen, and Spike Cohen were selected as the nominees for \nPresident and Vice President, respectively.  Id. \nThe Libertarian National Committee and the ALP engaged a local signature gatherer, \nScott Kohlhaas, to lead the petition and signature gathering drive in Alaska.  Id. at ยถ18.  Mr. \nKohlhaas began that effort approximately three weeks ago, to secure Limited Party Status for the \nALP, and to place the Jorgensen/Cohen ticket, and the ALP electors, on the ballot for 2020.  \n(Pl.โs Verified Compl, RE#1, ยถ19; Declaration Kohlhaas, attached hereto). \nMr. Jon Watts, the ALP Chair, also sought concessions from the Defendants in light of \nCOVID-19; for their part, the Defendants offered to permit the ALP to gather signatures via an \n \n2 https://covid19.alaska.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/05222020-Phase-III-IV-016-\nAttachment-N-Revised-Social-Religious-and-Other-Gatherings.pdf (last visited 5/29/2020) \n3 https://covid19.alaska.gov/reopen/ (last visited 5/29/2020). \n4 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 5   Filed 06/11/20   Page 4 of 12\n\nonline method.  (Pl.โs Verified Compl, RE#1, ยถ20).  The ALP sought additional concessions \nfrom Defendants, including a reduction of the signature requirement, or an extension of the time \nto petition, but Defendants have refused, instead placing Plaintiffs, and the general public, at \nadditional risk to the spread of COVID-19 through petition gathering efforts. (Pl.โs Verified \nCompl, RE#1, ยถ21).  Defendants denied them that relief. \nFurther, despite having attempted to do so via its website, email list, and other methods, \nthe ALP has gathered less than 50 signatures via online canvassing of voters in the last 60 days.  \n(Pl.โs Verified Compl, RE#1, ยถ22; Declaration, Kohlhaas).  Regular venues for the gathering and \ncollection of signatures are shut down or severely curtailed.  (Pl.โs Verified Compl, RE#1, ยถ23; \nDeclaration, Kohlhaas).  Furthermore, people that Mr. Kohlhaas and other petitioners have \napproached for signatures are appropriately apprehensive to approach them and sign a petition in \nlight of the COVID-19 outbreak.  (Pl.โs Verified Compl, RE#1, ยถ24; Declaration, Kohlhaas). \nMr. Kohlhaas, on May 28, 2020, petitioned for 3.5 hours (3 PM to 6:30 PM) in front of \nthe Carrs grocery store in Eagle River, Alaska, which is part of the Municipality of Anchorage \n(MOA).  (Pl.โs Verified Compl, RE#1, ยถ22; Declaration, Kohlhaas).  Working only on a \nLibertarian Limited Political Party petition, he gathered 56 signatures in that time, which is 16 \nsignatures per hour.  Id.  Normally, Mr. Kohlhaas would gather closer to 35 signatures per hour \nat that same location during a \"dinner hour\" shift which is the most heavily trafficked.  Id.  \nPeople have displayed observable cues that they are not comfortable being approached with the \noutbreak of COVID-19.  Id. \nFor a successful petition drive of 3,212 valid signatures, the ALP would gather 30% to \n40% above that threshold, or approximately 5,000 โrawโ signatures, to account for invalid \nsignatures.  (Pl.โs Verified Compl, RE#1, ยถ23; Declaration, Kohlhaas).  Also, for Kohlhaas and \n5 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 5   Filed 06/11/20   Page 5 of 12\n\nthe other petition gatherers, it is physically far more difficult to petition while wearing a mask \nand petitioners took breaks to use hand sanitizer every 15 or 20 minutes.  (Pl.โs Verified Compl, \nRE#1, ยถ24; Declaration, Kohlhaas). \nKohlhaas and the ALP have hired eight other people to help gather signatures in Alaska.  \nPetition team recruitment and retention right now is very difficult in light of COVID-19.  (Pl.โs \nVerified Compl, RE#1, ยถ25; Declaration, Kohlhaas).  The results they have seen have been \nterrible.  Id.  They gathered 149 signatures over the last 10 days to 2 weeks.  Id.  In a typical \nyear, they would expect at least 1,000 per week for this size team, in this same period.  Id. \nOverall, based on the longtime experience gathering signatures of Mr. Kohlhaas and \nothers, it is over five times as hard to gather signatures right now, and, the Alaska requirement \nthat is normally moderately burdensome in terms of signature gathering is severely burdensome \nin light of the circumstances on the ground with COVID-19.  (Pl.โs Verified Compl, RE#1, ยถ26; \nDeclaration, Kohlhaas).  Finally, Plaintiff Watts delivered paperwork to Defendant Fenumiai, \nwithout the required 1% of signatures appended to it for limited party status, and Defendant \nFenumiai refused to accept the same to place the Libertarian Partyโs 2020 Presidential and Vice-\nPresidential ticket and electors on the ballot as a limited party. (Pl.โs Verified Compl, RE#1, \nยถ27). \nIII.  Law and Argument \nA.  Preliminary Injunction Standard \nThe issuance of preliminary injunctive relief rests upon consideration of four factors: [1] \nthe likelihood of the plaintiffs' success on the merits; [2] the threat of irreparable harm to the \nplaintiffs if the injunction is not imposed; [3] the relative balance of this harm to the plaintiffs \nand the harm to the defendants if the injunction is imposed; and [4] the public interest. Los \n6 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 5   Filed 06/11/20   Page 6 of 12\n\nAngeles Memorial Coliseum Commission v. National Football League, 634 F.2d 1197, 1200-01 \n(9th Cir. 1980). \nThe Ninth Circuit has encompassed these factors into a two-prong test. To qualify for \npreliminary injunctive relief, the moving party must show \"either [1] a likelihood of success on \nthe merits and the possibility of irreparable injury, or [2] that serious questions going to the \nmerits were raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in [the moving party's] favor.\" Sun \nMicrosystems, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 188 F.3d 1115, 1119 (9th Cir. 1999), quoting, Sega \nEnterprises, Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510, 1517 (9th Cir. 1992). \"These two \nformulations represent a continuum in which the required degree of irreparable harm increases as \nthe probability of success decreases.\" America West Airlines, Inc. v. National Mediation Board, \n119 F.3d 772, 777 (9th Cir. 1997) (internal quotations omitted). \nPreventing injury that cannot later be repaired is precisely the kind of irreparable injury \nthat warrants preliminary injunctive relief. See S.O.C., Inc. v. County of Clark, 152 F.3d 1136, \n1148 (9th Cir. 1998) (finding irreparable injury where ordinance imposed unreasonable time, \nplace and manner restriction on protected speech), quoting, Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373, \n49 L. Ed. 2d 547, 96 S. Ct. 2673 (1976) (\"the loss of First Amendment freedoms for even \nminimal periods of time unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury\"); Foti v. City of Menlo \nPark, 146 F.3d 629, 643 (9th Cir. 1998) (same). \nNumerous cases hold that violation of a constitutional right, in and of itself, constitutes \nirreparable injury. See Topanga Press, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 989 F.2d 1524, 1528-29 (9th \nCir. 1993) (constitutional rights), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1030 (1994); Chalk v. United States \nDistrict Court, 840 F.2d 701, 710 (9th Cir. 1988) (civil rights); Zepeda v. United States \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, 753 F.2d 719, 727 (9th Cir. 1983). \n7 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 5   Filed 06/11/20   Page 7 of 12\n\nWhile this aspect of harm is related to the merits of a plaintiff's claim, even where the \nplaintiff has not demonstrated it is likely to prevail but instead raises serious questions on the \nmerits, it establishes a distinct possibility that its constitutional rights would be violated absent \nthe preliminary injunction. Sammartano v. First Judicial District Court in, for County of Carson \nCity, 303 F.3d 959, 2002 WL 1963341, *13 (9th Cir. 2002) (\"Even if the merits of the \nconstitutional claim were not clearly established at this early stage in the litigation, the fact that a \ncase raises serious First Amendment questions compels a finding that there exists the potential \nfor irreparable injury.\" (Internal quotations omitted)). Irreparable injury need not be established \nwith certainty or even high probability; the distinct possibility of such harm is sufficient to \nestablish a \"serious threat of irreparable injury\" supporting preliminary injunctive relief. See, \ne.g., id.; Foti, 146 F.3d at 643. \nB.  Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits \nBefore undertaking an analysis of the merits of the Plaintiffsโ claims, it is important to \nnote that this lawsuit, and the relief that Plaintiffs seek are narrow: Plaintiffs do not seek to \nfacially challenge A.S. 15.30.025, or the general ballot access scheme of Alaska.  In normal \nelection years, these requirements pose modest burdens that Plaintiffs have historically and \nroutinely been able to achieve.  But 2020 is different, and what was a modest challenge in \nnormal years poses an unsurmountable challenge this year.  Plaintiffs thus bring an as-applied \nchallenge to A.S. 15.30.025 in light of both governmental restrictions and shutdowns of public \nplaces, as well as the situation on the ground with COVID-19. \nDespite attempting to circulate petitions online, for over a month, it is readily apparent \nthat the signature threshold cannot be met by the August deadline (or at all) in 2020 if Plaintiffs \nwere to circulate solely online.  In person signature gathering is thus necessary.   \n8 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 5   Filed 06/11/20   Page 8 of 12\n\nPlaintiffs brought in a team of eight signature gatherers, and, despite reasonable \ndiligence, have only been able to gather 149 signatures in 10 days.  (Pl.โs Compl., RE#1, ยถ25).  \nMr. Kohlhaas, who is the most seasoned and experienced of these signature gatherers, was able \nto gather only 56 signatures in a busy grocery store (perhaps the only reasonably crowded \nlocation that is open) in a three-and-a-half-hour effort.  Id.  The deadline is August 5, 2020. \nUnder the prevailing U.S. Supreme Court cases of Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 760 \n(1983) and Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428 (1992), courts are first instructed to look at the \nburden of the requirement.  Where burden is severe, strict scrutiny applies.  Id.  Where the \nburden is โmore than minimalโ the flexible approach is used, which weighs the governmentโs \nasserted interest against the means by which it has chosen to pursue it.  Id. \nThe Ninth Circuit has held that the burden on plaintiffs' rights should be measured by \nwhether, in light of the entire statutory scheme regulating ballot access, \"reasonably diligent\" \ncandidates can normally gain a place on the ballot, or whether they will rarely succeed in doing \nso. Libertarian Party of Washington v. Munro, 31 F.3d 759, 761-762 (9th Cir. 1994) (quoting \nStorer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 742 (1974)).  \nTypically, to determine the severity of the burden, the Ninth Circuit has said that past \ncandidates' ability to secure a place on the ballot can inform the court's analysis. See id. at 763.  \nThat analysis, however, sheds little light on the situation this year.  This year, the situation on the \nground is unique.  The District Court in Nevada recently recognized this fact.  Fair Maps Nev. v. \nCegavske, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94696 (D. Nevada May 29, 2020).  It looked to see if anyone \nelse had qualified or submitted a petition under present circumstances.  Id.  That analysis is \nundoubtedly correct.  And here, no one in Alaska has.  And unless this Court takes action, it is \nhighly unlikely that anyone in Alaska will. \n9 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 5   Filed 06/11/20   Page 9 of 12\n\nIn the past two months, numerous federal courts have addressed ballot access or voting \nrequirements which, in normal times, are typically viewed as reasonable or appropriate even \nthough they are moderately burdensome, but which have become unreasonable and oppressive in \nlight of the COVID-19 outbreak.  Esshaki v. Whitmer, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 14376 (6th Cir. \n2020) (concluding petition gathering with the presence of COVID-19 and state orders regarding \nsame created a severe burden and ordering relief); Libertarian Party of Ill. v. Pritzker, 2020 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 71563 (ILND 2020) (order permitting previously qualified parties and loosening the \nsignature requirements in light of insurmountable hurdle of COVID-19); Garbett v. Herbert, \n2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75853 (Dist. Utah, 2020) (reducing signature requirements in light of \nCOVID-19 outbreak); Democratic Nat'l Comm. v. Bostelmann, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48394, \n2020 WL 1320819 (W.D. Wis. 2020) (extending deadline in light of \"excruciating dilemma that \nwill soon be faced by eligible voters . . . [to] either venture into public spaces, contrary to public \ndirectives and health guidelines or stay at home and lose the opportunity to vote.\"). \nIn a normal year, Mr. Kohlhaas and his team would have completed their Alaska petition \ndrive in two to three weeks, and then moved on to other states on behalf of the Libertarian \nNational Committee.  As it stands, and without relief from this Court, it appears that they will \nneed to spend the entire summer in Alaska, and even then perhaps not gather enough valid \nsignatures to place the ticket on the ballot.  The math on their progress to date is not favorable.  \nAt the rate that they have been proceeding, 149 signatures in 10 days, and with approximately 60 \ndays until that deadline, it appears that even with an eight-person signature gathering team, they \nmight at best gather only 905 signatures. \nAgain, what would typically trigger a flexible analysis and pass constitutional musterโin \na normal year at leastโdoes not trigger a flexible analysis given the situation on the ground in \n10 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 5   Filed 06/11/20   Page 10 of 12\n\nAlaska with the COVID-19 outbreak.  Application of the challenged statutes, as applied this \nyear, with the situation now presented by the pandemic and as experienced by reasonably \ndiligent signature gatherers, demonstrates a severe, constitutionally unacceptable burden. \nC.  Remedies \nHaving demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, and having demonstrated that \nthe other factors are met because Constitutional rights are at stake, S.O.C., Inc., 152 F.3d 1136, \n1148; Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373; Foti, 146 F.3d 629, 643, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they \nare entitled to preliminary injunctive relief.  That turns to remedy. \n  As remedy, Plaintiffs seek excusal from the signature requirement in its entirety, or, in \nthe absence of that, they respectfully request a reduction in the number of valid signatures that \nthey must submit.  Given what Mr. Kohlhaas has observed, and specifically his testimony that it \nis over five times as difficult as normal to collect signatures, Plaintiffs suggest that a signature \nthreshold of 20% of the normal threshold, or 638 signaturesโfor the 2020 election cycle onlyโ\nwould also be an appropriate remedy.  They further seek, or alternatively seek, an extension of \nthe deadline under which they must turn in signatures. \nIV.  Conclusion \nPlaintiffs respectfully request the preliminary injunctive relief noted. \n            Respectfully Submitted, \n \n              /s/Christopher Wiest________________ \nChristopher Wiest (admitted pro hac vice) \nKY Bar No. 90725; OH Bar No. 0077931 \nChris Wiest, Atty at Law, PLLC \n25 Town Center Blvd, Suite 104 \nCrestview Hills, KY 41017 \n513/257-1895 (c) \n859/495-0803 (f) \nchris@cwiestlaw.com \n11 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 5   Filed 06/11/20   Page 11 of 12\n\n \n \n/s/Thomas Amodio       \nThomas Amodio, ABA No. 8511142 \nREEVES AMODIO LLC \n500 L Street, Suite 300 \nAnchorage, AK 99501 \nTelephone:  (907) 222-7100 \nFacsimile:  (907) 222-7199 \ntom@reevesamodio.com \nCo-counsel for Plaintiffs \n \n \nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \n \nI certify that I have served the foregoing upon all Counsel or parties, by: (i) filing a copy of the \nforegoing in the Courtโs CM/ECF system; and (ii) serving a copy of the foregoing on the \nDefendants and upon the Alaska Attorney General, by express overnight mail, this 11 day of \nJune, 2020. \n \n              /s/Christopher Wiest \n \n12 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 5   Filed 06/11/20   Page 12 of 12",

INTRODUCTION \nIn this type of โas-appliedโ constitutional challenge requesting extraordinary relief \nfrom otherwise constitutional ballot access requirements, the facts determine the \noutcome. Here, the critical facts are that Governor Dunleavyโs stay-at-home order was \nlifted before the Alaska Libertarian Party (ALP) started gathering in-person signatures, \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 11   Filed 06/29/20   Page 1 of 19\n\nandโassuming ALPโs assertions about signature gathering efforts are trueโall ALP had \nto do was gather nine signatures per circulator per day to meet Alaska lawโs minimal \nthreshold to get on the ballot. These facts do not justify extraordinary relief. \nAlaska law on signature gathering is already quite permissive. Unlike the stricter \nballot access requirements in other states requiring in-person signature gathering during a \nlimited period of time, Alaska law already allows for signatures to be transmitted by \nscanned copies over email, and the political group seeking ballot access can start \ngathering those signatures as soon as the previous presidential election has been held.1 \nAlthough COVID-19 is making a lot of tasks and legal requirements more burdensomeโ\nincluding signature gatheringโAlaska law fortunately already contains the flexibility and \nadvanced timelines needed to accommodate reasonable ballot access for minority \npolitical parties during the current pandemic.  \nThe Court should grant the Defendantsโ (โthe Stateโ) motion to dismiss and deny \nALPโs motion for a preliminary injunction. \nII.  FACTS  \nAlaska law provides two different paths for political parties and political groups to \naccess the presidential general election ballot.2 The only path at issue in this lawsuit \n                                              \n1   See AS 15.30.025. \n2   AS 15.30.020-.025 (allowing a โpolitical party,โ defined as a party having \nreceived three percent of the vote in the last general election or a party having registered \nmembers equal to three percent of the vote, to access the general election ballot through \nAlaskaโs primary election, and allowing other political groups to be recognized as \nโlimited political partiesโ by submitting a petition). \nAlaska Libertarian Party, et al. v. Gail Fenumiai, et al.  Case No. 3:20-cv-00127-JWS \nOpp. to Mot. for Prelim.

[Dkt. 1 at 3, ยถ 12] As of November 3, 2019, ALP had 7,251 registered \nvoters affiliated with the party. [Dkt. 1 at 1, ยถ 1] Because Alaska law does not restrict the \ntimeline for signature gathering, nothing prevented the party from beginning to gather \nsignatures to regain party status immediately after it lost that status in 2018. \nOn March 11, 2020, Governor Dunleavy issued a disaster declaration due to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. [Dkt. 1 at 4, ยถ 14] Although a number of health mandates and \nhealth advisories have been issued, only three are truly relevant for purposes of this \n                                              \n3   AS 15.30.025. \n4   Id. \n5   Id. \nAlaska Libertarian Party, et al. v.

On March 28, Governor Dunleavy issued a social distancing/stay at home \nmandate; on April 24, he allowed non-essential businesses to open to the public under \nstringent guidance; and on May 22, he lifted the social distancing/stay at home mandate \nallowing all businesses in Alaska to reopen.6 [Dkt. 1 at 4, ยถยถ 14, 16] As alleged in the \ncomplaint, โthe May 22, 2020 reopening orders are the currently applicable orders.โ Id. \nALP alleges it began gathering signatures through in-person circulators for its \npetition around May 24, 2020, after the national Libertarian Party Convention selected \nthe partyโs presidential nominee. [Dkt. 1 at 4-5, ยถยถ 17, 19] This gave the party a 79-day \nself-imposed window from May 24 to August 5 to gather the signatures it needed \n(nothing prevented the party from beginning to gather its signatures more than a year \nearlier, when it lost political party status following the 2018 election. [Dkt. 1 at 3, ยถ12]). \nThus, the party had to collect an average of 41 valid signatures per day or an estimated  \n64 โrawโ signatures7 per day to account for potentially invalid signatures.8 ALP also \n                                              \n6   These two mandates and the one action rescinding the prior mandates can be \nfound at the following hyperlinks: https://gov.alaska.gov/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/2/03272020-SOA-COVID-19-Health-Mandate-011.pdf; \nhttps://gov.alaska.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/03272020-SOA-COVID-19-Health-\nMandate-011.pdf; and https://covid19.alaska.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/05192020-\nAlaskas-Plan-Forward-Final.pdf. \n7   In any signature-gathering effort, the Division of Elections will find that some \npercentage of the signatures collected are not the signatures of qualified Alaska voters. \nALP uses the phrase โraw signaturesโ to describe all of the signatures gathered, in \ncontrast to the signatures subsequently validated by the Division. Dkt. 5 at 5. \n8   79 days x 41 signatures = 3239 signatures; 79 days x 64 signatures = 5056 \nsignatures. See Dkt. 1 at 6, ยถ 26. The Division notes that two recently-filed initiative \npetitionsโwhich had signature qualification rates of 87 and 88 percentโsuggest that the \nparty is unduly pessimistic about the likely number of invalid signatures.

Fenumiai) at 1-2, ยถ 2] But the Division of Elections \nconfirmed in its response dated August 1, 2019 that the Division has no authority to \nโreinstateโ limited political party status upon request; rather, ALP needed to submit a \nlimited political party petition like every other political group that fails to meet the \nthreshold for political party status. [Decl. Fenumiai at 1-2, ยถ 2] \nBy the end of May 2020, ALP had nine petition circulators working to gather \nsignatures in support of its candidatesโScott Kohlhaas, an experienced circulator [Dkt. \n5-1 at 1, ยถ 2],9 and eight others, hired by Mr. Kohlhaas. [Dkt. 5-1 at 2, ยถ 10] Counting \nonly June, July, and the first four days of August,10 these nine circulators had 65 days to \ngather the 3,212-5,000 signatures they need, or an average of 50-77 signatures a day. This \nmeans that each circulator needs to collect an average of 6-9 signatures per day.  \nMr. Kohlhaas reports that he collected 56 signatures in a 3.5-hour period outside a \ngrocery store in Eagle River on May 28. [Dkt. 5-1 at 2, ยถ 7]  \nAlthough the Division of Elections is unaware of any other political groups \nseeking limited political party status for the presidential election, the Division has \nreceived five petitions with signatures from candidates seeking nomination by petition, \nwhich also requires signature gathering. [Decl. Fenumiai at 2, ยถ 5] Such candidates must \n                                              \n9   Mr. Kohlhaas executed his affidavitโDkt. 5-1โon May 29, 2020. \n10   Because the petition has to be submitted by August 5, 2020, the party would likely \nneed to complete its signature gathering by the end of August 4. \nAlaska Libertarian Party, et al. v. Gail Fenumiai, et al.  Case No. 3:20-cv-00127-JWS \nOpp. to Mot. for Prelim.

[Decl. Fenumiai at 2-3, ยถยถ 5-9] To date, four of the five \npetitions submitted have been found to contain sufficient qualified signatures to go on the \nballot. [Decl. Fenumiai at 2, ยถ 5]   \nBecause of the federal Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, the \nDivision of Elections must send general election absentee ballots to certain voters 45 \ndays before the election, which is September 19.12 To meet that deadline, the Division \nmust send the final general election ballot to the printer by September 1. [Decl. Fenumiai \nat 4, ยถ 15] As a result, the current signature-gathering deadline of August 5 leaves the \nDivision of Elections less than 30 days to review the signatures for a limited political \nparty petition and finalize the general election ballot. During this period, the Division \nmust also conduct the primary election, which is scheduled for August 18. \nIII.   LEGAL STANDARDS \nThe State moves the Court to dismiss ALPโs complaint for lack of standing under \nRules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). When subject matter jurisdiction is challenged under  \nRule 12(b)(1), the plaintiff has the burden of proving jurisdiction in order to survive the \n                                              \n11   AS 15.25.160-.170. \n12   42 U.S.C. 1973ff et seq. \nAlaska Libertarian Party, et al. v.

A mandatory preliminary injunction should not be granted โunless \nthe facts and law clearly favor the plaintiff.โ22 This is especially true here given that the \nU.S. Supreme Court has expressly cautioned against making changes midway through an \nelection cycle, and in this case, the primary election is just two months away.23  \nIV.   ARGUMENT \n \nA.  ALP lacks standing because no state action is alleged to have harmed \nALPโs signature gathering efforts, which began after Governor \nDunleavy lifted his stay-at-home order. \n \nArticle III standing requires a plaintiff to establish three things: โ(1) he must have \ndirectly suffered an injury in fact, (2) the injury must be fairly traceable to the \ndefendantโs conduct, and (3) a favorable court decision must be likely to redress the \ninjury.โ24 Here, ALP has not established an injury in fact because no evidence suggests \n                                              \n20   Shell Offshore, Inc. v.

Nor has ALP established an injury that is โfairly traceable toโ the Stateโs \nconduct, because the State lifted its stay at home order on May 22 and there are currently \nno state-imposed restrictions that limit the partyโs signature-gathering efforts. \nAs for the injury-in-fact requirement, ALPโs complaint and its motion for \npreliminary injunction rest on a false predicate: the assumption that the party cannot \nrealistically hope to gather sufficient signatures to get its presidential ticket on the \ngeneral-election ballot. But ALPโs numbers do not support this contention. A goal of nine \nsignatures per circulator per day is hardly onerous, especially when a single circulatorโ\nalbeit an experienced oneโcollected 56 signatures in under four hours. [Dkt. 5-1 at 2,  \nยถ 7.] \nAs for the fairly-traceable requirement, to the extent that ALP may find it more \ndifficult than usual to gather signatures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, that \ndifficulty is not โfairly traceableโ to state action. The State lifted its social \ndistancing/stay-at-home mandate on May 22โbefore ALP even began trying to collect \nsignatures. Thus, any difficulty that ALP is experiencing is not a product of state \nrestrictions. As the Sixth Circuit recently noted in a similar case, โFirst Amendment \nviolations require state action. So we cannot hold private citizensโ decisions to stay home \nAlaska Libertarian Party, et al. v. Gail Fenumiai, et al.  Case No. 3:20-cv-00127-JWS \nOpp. to Mot. for Prelim.

ALPโs complaint fails to state a claim for which relief may be granted \nand should therefore be dismissed pursuant to F.R.C.P. 12(b)(6). \n \nIn addition to lack of standing, the Court may also dismiss the complaint for \nfailure to state a claim, because ALP fails to allege a viable ballot access claim. The \nalleged burden on ballot access described in the complaint and motion for preliminary \ninjunction is de minimus: at most, it amounts to a requirement that the partyโs nine \nsignature gatherers collect an average of nine signatures a day. This modest target is well \nwithin their abilities, as established by the affidavit of Mr. Kohlhaas. [Dkt. 5-1 at 2, ยถ 7.] \nGiven such a de minimis burden, the Stateโs well-established and judicially-\nrecognized interests in reducing voter confusion and ballot over-crowding are more than \nsufficient to justify its reasonable ballot-access restrictions. These principles are \ndiscussed below in the Stateโs argument against ALPโs motion for preliminary injunction. \nFor the same reasons ALP cannot make the merits showing necessary to justify a \npreliminary injunction, it also fails to state a claim for relief. Alaskaโs ballot access laws \nremain constitutional even in the unique circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic; and \nthis Court should dismiss ALPโs complaint for failure to state a claim. \n                                              \n25   Thompson v. Dewine, 959 F.3d 804, 810 (6th Cir. 2020) (internal citations \nomitted); see also Clark v. Edwards, 2020 WL 3415376 (D. M.D. Lousiana 2020) \n(holding 10 different plaintiffs lacked standing on the grounds that โfear of the virusโ was \nnot a sufficient injury-in-fact nor fairly traceable to state action). \nAlaska Libertarian Party, et al. v.

ALP is not entitled to a preliminary injunction. \nBecause an injunction is such an extraordinary remedy, ALP must show not only \nthat it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claim, but also that it will be irreparably \nharmed if no injunction issues, that the equities tip strongly in its favor, and that an \ninjunction will serve the public interest.26 But ALP has not established any of these \nelements, so the Court should deny the requested injunction. \n1.  ALPโs ballot access claim lacks merit. \nALP fails to show that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its ballot access \nclaim because even according to its own allegations, it can achieve ballot access despite \nthe COVID-19 pandemic with a modicum of reasonable diligence. \nFederal courts โevaluate challenges to ballot access laws under the First and \nFourteenth Amendments using the balancing framework in Anderson v. Calabrezze27 and \nBurdick v. Takushi.28 The balancing framework is a โsliding scaleโโthe more severe the \nburden imposed, the more exacting [the] scrutiny; the less severe, the more relaxed [the] \nscrutiny.โ29 When the burden is severe, the Stateโs law must be narrowly tailored to \nadvance a โcompellingโ interest, but โ[a] state may justify election regulations imposing \n                                              \n26   Shell Offshore, Inc. v.

But this claim is not borne out by the facts. As ALPโs own evidence \ndemonstrates, it has more than enough time to gather the necessary signatures before the \nAugust 5 submission deadlineโits required target of nine signatures per circulator per \nday is hardly onerous as shown by Mr. Kohlhaasโs collection of 56 signatures in three-\nand-a-half hours on an afternoon in late May. [Dkt. 5-1 at 2, ยถ 7.] \nThe State acknowledges that COVID-19 may have made signature gathering more \ndifficult this year, but ALPโs allegations do not show a severe burden under the Ninth \nCircuitโs ballot-access cases. โIn challenging ballot access regulations, parties must \n                                              \n30   Arizona Libertarian Party v.

And unless this Court takes \naction, it is highly unlikely that anyone in Alaska will.โ [Dkt. 5 at 9] But ALP can qualify \nfor ballot access this year with a modicum of diligence: each of its circulators must gather \nonly an average of nine signatures per day. Indeed, the partyโs own numbers indicate \ntheir lack of diligenceโALPโs โteam of eight signature gatherers โฆ have only been able \nto gather 149 signatures in 10 days,โ despite ALPโs own evidence showing that much \nmore effective efforts are possible. [Dkt. 5 at 9] \nAs ALP notes, some courts in other parts of the country have enjoined state ballot \naccess laws. [Dkt. 5 at 9-10] But these decisions are very fact-specific and none of them \nsupport this Courtโs intervention here, where the plaintiff did not begin to gather \nsignatures until after the State lifted its pandemic-related restrictions and faces a still very \nmodest burden based on its own evidence. The cases that ALP cites are all \ndistinguishable based on their respective state restrictions and timelines; notably, all \n                                              \n32   Arizona Green Party v.

Bostelman,34 is irrelevant because it \nhad nothing to do with signature-gathering efforts for ballot access; instead, it involved a \nprimary election in early April. Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court immediately stayed \npart of the Bostelman injunction on the grounds that the โDistrict Court contravened this \nCourtโs precedents โฆ This Court has repeatedly emphasized that lower federal courts \nshould ordinarily not alter the election rules on the eve of an election.โ35 \nThe other cases ALP cites involved signature gathering in vastly different \ncontexts, one of whichโEsshaki v. Whitmerโhas already been distinguished by the \ncourt that decided the case.36 Esshaki concerned a Michigan rule under which candidates \ncould access the primary ballot only by turning in a sufficient number of qualified \nsignatures by April 21, when a stay-at-home order issued March 23 was still in place.37 \nBecause Michigan requires that nominating petition signatures be collected in-person and \nbe witnessed by a circulator, the stay-at-home order made any signature gathering \nimpossible.38 The Sixth Circuit later distinguished its Esshaki in an Ohio case, observing \nthat โnone of Ohioโs pandemic response regulations changed the status quo on the \n                                              \n34   2020 WL 1638374 (W.D.

Pritzker, the court \nemphasized the fact that the signature-gathering window began after Illinoisโ stay-at-\nhome order was already in place, with no end in sight for the stay-at-home order.40 In \nGarbett v. Herbert, Utahโs signature submission deadline was April 13, and a stay-at-\nhome directive had issued two weeks earlier.41 Lastly, in Fair Maps Nevada v. Cegavske, \nNevada had a stay-at-home order in place from March 30 to May 9, and the statutory \ndeadline for turning in signatures for the initiative petition was June 24.42 Nevada \nrequires an initiative petition to be signed by a large percentage of voters,43 and the court \nrelied on the existence of a constitutional deadline that is later than the June 24 statutory \ndeadline in deciding to enjoin the deadline, while also leaving in place the in-person \nsignature requirement.44 \nEach case was decided on its specific facts in the midst of ongoing stay-at-home \norders. The facts of this case, by contrast, show a much lesser burden: Alaskaโs signature \n                                              \n39   Thompson, 959 F.3d 804, 809 (distinguishing its decision in Esshaki v.

ALP has thus failed \nto establish that under the circumstances in Alaska, a โreasonably diligentโ party could \nnot gather sufficient signatures to gain ballot access if the party actually has the \nโmodicum of supportโ necessary to warrant such access, and thus, it has not shown that \nthe law creates more than a de minimis burden on its constitutional rights. \nAs a result, the State need only show that its signature-gathering requirements and \ndeadline serve โimportant regulatory interests.โ45 And this burden is easily met, because \nthe Ninth Circuit has repeatedly held that signature-gathering laws serve the important \nregulatory interests of โpreventing voter confusion, ballot overcrowding, and frivolous \ncandidacies.โ46 And the Supreme Court long ago recognized โthe important state interest \nin requiring some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support before \nprinting the name of a political organizationโs candidate on the ballot.โ47 \nBecause the burden on ALP is slight and the Stateโs important regulatory interests \nare not seriously in questionโafter all, ALP concedes that the law is constitutional under \nnormal conditionsโthe party cannot show probable success on the merits.  \n                                              \n45   Arizona Green Party v.

ALP has not established irreparable harm absent an injunction, \nand the balance of the equities and the public interest favor not \nsuspending the signature-gathering requirement. \n \nALP claims that it will be irreparably harmed absent an injunction based on its \nexpectation that it will fail to gather sufficient signatures and will be denied access to the \ngeneral election ballot. [Dkt. 5 at 7] But this kind of speculative harm is not enough to \nwarrant a preliminary injunction. Rather a plaintiff โmust establish that irreparable harm \nis likely, not just possible, in order to obtain a preliminary injunction.โ48 Given the \nmodest number of signatures its circulators must gather each day and the fact that it has \nmore than twice as many registered voters as it needs signatures, [Dkt. 1 at 1] it is far \nfrom clear that the party will not meet the required threshold. And moral hazard \ncomplicates the situation: ALP does not just fear that it may fail to reach its target, it \nwishes to be relieved of the burden of even trying to reach it. Notably, the very relief \nrequested by ALPโsuspension of the signature requirementโwas soundly rejected by \nall of the district court opinions ALP cites as favorable precedent. 49  \n                                              \n48   Alliance for the Wild Rockies v.

Cegavske, \n2020 WL 2798018 (D. Nev. 2020) (โthe relief Plaintiffs seek as to the In-Person \nRequirements generally requires the Court to get impermissibly in the weeds of designing \nelection procedures because Plaintiffs ask the Court to order the Secretary to set up a \nsystem for collecting and verifying signatures offered to support an initiative petition \nelectronically, for the first time, immediately.โ); Esshaki v.

The State should not be \nenjoined from enforcing its ballot access laws simply because ALP would prefer not to \ncommit its resources to meeting the requirements. Nor is it in the public interest to \nsuspend election laws whenever background circumstances that are not within the Stateโs \ncontrol of the State make them more difficult to comply with than usual. The U.S. \nSupreme Court has long held that changing election laws on the eve of an election is \ndisfavored, and recently reiterated this principle during this pandemic.50 \nV.  CONCLUSION \nBecause ALP has not established its entitlement to a preliminary injunction, this \nCourt should deny its motion. The Court should also dismiss this case because ALP lacks \nstanding or, alternatively, because ALPโs complaint fails to state a claim under  \nF.R.C.P. 12(b)(6) because Alaskaโs ballot access laws do not infringe on ALPโs First \nAmendment rights, even under the unique circumstances of the COVID-19 epidemic. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                              \n(E.D.

I am the Director of the Division of Elections for the State of Alaska and I \nhave personal knowledge of the matters stated in this affidavit. \n2.  On July 7, 2019, the Alaska Libertarian Party (ALP) sent a letter to me \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 12   Filed 06/29/20   Page 1 of 5\n\nrequesting reinstatement of limited political party status. On August 1, 2019, I responded \nexplaining that ALP had lost its political party status and would have to re-apply by filing \na petition. The letters are attached to this Declaration as Exhibits A and B respectively. \n3.  Each election cycle, nominating petition candidates under AS 15.25.140-\n.200 submit notice of filing a nominating petition by June 1 in the election year, and in \norder to get on the general election ballot, the candidate must submit signatures of \nqualified voters by the date of the primary election equaling at least one percent of the \nnumber of voters who cast ballots in the district for which the candidacy is sought in the \npreceding general election. This is similar to the requirement for limited political parties \nunder AS 15.30.025, except for the deadline. Limited political parties do not have to \nprovide notice by June 1, but have to submit the petition at least 90 days before the \npresidential general election. Both types of petitions can be filed at any time prior to the \ndeadlines provided. \n4.  At this point, the Division of Elections has not received any petitions from \nother limited political parties. This is not all that surprising since the deadline for \nsubmission of limited political parties is August 5, 2020 for this election cycle. \n5.  On the other hand, the Division of Elections has already received five \ncompleted nominating petitions with signatures from individual candidates. Of the five \npetitions submitted, four of them were submitted after Governor Dunleavy issued the \ndisaster declaration, and one was submitted in October 2019. To date, four of the five \npetitions submitted have been found to contain sufficient qualified signatures for the \ncandidate to be placed on the ballot. The details of each of the nominating petitions that \nAlaska Libertarian Party, et al. v. Gail Fenumiai, et al.

Nominating petition candidate Jamin L. Burton running for House District \n7 turned in a total of 132 signatures on October 3, 2019. The minimum number of \nqualified signatures needed was 73. \n7.  Nominating petition candidate Elijah M. Verhagen running for House \nDistrict 6 turned in a total of 77 signatures on June 1, 2020. The minimum number of \nqualified signatures needed was 69. \n8.  Nominating petition candidate James Baisden running for House District 30 \nturned in a total of 103 signatures on June 10, 2020. The minimum number of qualified \nsignatures needed was 77. \n9.  Nominating petition candidate Ed King running for House District 34 \nturned in a total of 93 signatures on June 17, 2020. The minimum number of qualified \nsignatures needed was 89. \n10.  There have also been two significant signature gathering efforts on two \ninitiatives within the past year that may provide helpful information at least on the \ngeneral rate of qualification and how many signatures could be gathered in-person \ndirectly preceding the pandemic. This information is available on the Division of \nElectionโs website: http://www.elections.alaska.gov/Core/initiativepetitionstatus.php.  \n11.  The number of signatures required to get an initiative on the ballot must \nmeet three requirements as set forth in AS 15.45.140: (1) โequal in number to 10 percent \nof those who voted in the preceding general election; (2) resident in at least three-fourths \nof the house districts of the state; and (3) who, in each of the house districts described in \nAlaska Libertarian Party, et al. v. Gail Fenumiai, et al.  Case No. 3:20-cv-00127-JWS \nDeclaration of Gail Fenumiai    Page 3 of 5 \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 12   Filed 06/29/20   Page 3 of 5\n\n(2) of this subsection, are equal in number to at least seven percent of those who voted in \nthe preceding general election in the house district.โ For the initiatives filed in 2019, the \ntotal number of qualified signatures required was 28,501. \n12.  19AKBE, also known as the Better Elections Initiative, received petition \nbooklets from the Alaska Division of Elections on October 31, 2019. Initiative sponsors \nturned in a total of 40,826 signatures on January 9, 2020. The Division of Elections \nverified that there were 36,006 qualified signatures, which equates to a qualification rate \nof 88 percent. \n13.  19OGTX, also known as the Fair Share Initiative, received petition \nbooklets from the Alaska Division of Elections on October 23, 2019. Initiative sponsors \nturned in a total of 44,881 signatures on January 17, 2020. The Division of Elections \nverified that there were 39,174 qualified signatures, which equates to a qualification rate \nof 87 percent. \n14.  Although the Alaska Libertarian Party appears to only be requesting \ninjunctive relief in the form of a reduction in the number of signatures required or \nautomatic approval to be placed on the ballot, it is important to understand the short \ntimeline in which the Division has to act. Because of these short timelines, any extension \nof the August 5 deadline is not feasible. \n15.  The Division has to send out the general election ballots to certain \nuniformed and overseas voters under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee \nVoting Act (42 U.S.C. 1973ff et seq.) by September 19, 2020. The Division must send \nthe ballots to the printer by September 1, 2020 to ensure these legal requirements can be \nAlaska Libertarian Party, et al. v. Gail Fenumiai, et al.

Reply Introduction \n  Defendants do not (and cannot) dispute that COVID-19 creates unprecedented burdens \non society, and, indeed, on these Plaintiffs.  Their argument essentially boils down to an \nargument that Plaintiffs should have had a crystal ball or otherwise somehow predicted that a \nonce-in-a-hundred-year global pandemic would interrupt and disrupt society and their signature \ngathering efforts.  They do this by comparing the Plaintiffs with other groups who undertook to \ngather more signatures well in advance of the COVID-19 outbreak (because, frankly, those \ngroups had to collect more signatures, which needed to be gathered well in advance), or by \nmaking the comparison between Plaintiffs and candidates who had to gather less than 100 \nsignatures that could be gathered in a few weeks.  Neither comparison is appropriate. \n  Certainly, if the COVID-19 global pandemic was a foreseeable event, it would be wholly \nappropriate to make the argument that Plaintiffs should have begun earlier, such as planning \naround the Alaska winter, which occurs every year and makes petitioning challenging.  For \nforeseeable events, the failure to plan for and take steps to avoid pitfalls can clearly be blamed \nupon the Plaintiffs.  But the COVID-19 pandemic was not foreseeable.  No one saw it coming.  \nAnd Plaintiffs began gathering signatures almost immediately after the Governor lifted his stay-\nat-home order. \nDefendants argue that the Governorโs orders do not prevent them currently from \nengaging in the act of petitioning, while ignoring the fact that other Government actors have \nclosed the locations that Plaintiffs and their petitioners are normally are able to collect signatures \nat: public spaces where people gather.  Defendants also completely ignore the public health risk \nthat the law in question that they vigorously defend forces the petitioners to engage in (not to \nmention the risk to members of the general public whom the petitionerโs solicit signatures from). \n2 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 14   Filed 07/03/20   Page 2 of 11\n\nII.  Facts \nThis Court directed the Plaintiffs to obtain a report, from their petitioning team, and \nPlaintiffs have done so to the best of their ability.1   \nAs of July 2, 2020, Plaintiffs have gathered a total of 1,959 signatures.  (Declaration \nKohlhaas, attached).  Since June 11, 2020, they have gathered 1,664 signatures in a three-week \nperiod.  Id.  The Plaintiffs, through their petitioner team, have been gathering signatures every \nday since June 11, 2020 (and before that).  Id.  Their most experienced petition gatherer has \nexperienced some level of success (but nothing like a normal year), while others have not.  Id.  It \nthus appears, if โ and only if โ the Plaintiffsโ luck and trend holds up, if COVID does not spike \nin Alaska like it has in other states in the south such as Florida and Texas,2 if Alaskaโs Governor \ndoes not lock the state down again in response to such a spike or a risk of a spike, if Mr. Thigpen \ndoes not get sick or come down with COVID and remains on the job, and if the results they have \nachieved to date continue (something that is also not certain) at the same rate, they may be able \nto hit 4,566 raw signatures by the August 5, 2020 deadline.3   \nThat would, in turn, mean that the validity rate would need to be 70.3% or higher, which \nis at the very top of the range used by Mr. Kohlhaas in calculating validity, adding yet another \nโif,โ in terms of validity rate to the equation.  That is a lot of โifs.โ  In the meantime, Plaintiffs, \n \n1 As explained in Mr. Kohlhaasโ report, managing a team of petitioners is a difficult proposition \nand petition gatherers are not always the most responsive.  Plaintiffs have undertaken best efforts \nto comply with the Courtโs order. \n2 https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/reopening-reverses-course-in-texas-and-florida-as-\ncoronavirus-cases-spike/2020/06/26/72eb5f6a-b7c5-11ea-a510-55bf26485c93_story.html (last \nvisited 7/3/2020). \n3 That calculation is based on 554 signatures per week, or 79 signatures per day.  As of the date \nof this filing, there remains 33 days left to turn in the petition.  Using the math and rate, and \nmaking the assumptions that all of the โifsโ are met, and the success rate remains the same, the \nPlaintiffs will gather another 2,607 more โrawโ signatures, for a total of 4,566 signatures. \n3 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 14   Filed 07/03/20   Page 3 of 11\n\nand their contract petitioners, continue to spend resources, time, effort, and money pursuing a \npetition drive in most difficult circumstances. \nNotably, as before, the online signature gathering results have been abysmal: despite \nrepeatedly soliciting signatures, only 12 more have come in through electronic signature \ngathering methods, proving that in person signature gathering remains the only viable option.  Id. \nIII.  Law and Argument \nA.  Plaintiffs have standing \nDefendants begin by arguing that Plaintiffs lack standing.  They are incorrect.  To show \nstanding, Plaintiffs must: (1) directly suffered an injury in fact, (2) the injury must be fairly \ntraceable to the defendantโs conduct, and (3) a favorable court decision must be likely to redress \nthe injury.  Rubin v. City of Santa Monica, 308 F.3d 1008, 1019 (9th Cir. 2002). \nAny relief that this Court might award, including even a modest reduction in the \nsignature threshold, will redress the injury that the Plaintiffs currently suffer, which is fully \ntraceable to the challenged ballot access law.  Plaintiffs have not yet met the requirements of the \nstatute, and, it appears, unless the stars continue to align perfectly between now and August 5, \n2020, will not be able to do so.  It is likely to be the case that Plaintiffs will be slightly under the \nrequired number of signatures on August 5, 2020.  Thus, even a slight reduction in the number of \nrequired signatures will likely be significant. \nMr. Watts, as a voter and Alaska Libertarian Party member who wishes to vote for that \nPartyโs candidates, and the Alaska Libertarian Party, as an organization comprised of registered \nvoters, which is forced to expend resources to comply with the statute that Plaintiffs are \nchallenging, have standing to challenge Alaskaโs limited party election laws.  Storer v. Brown, \n415 U.S. 724 (1974) (standing found, even where election law challenger could meet the \n4 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 14   Filed 07/03/20   Page 4 of 11\n\nrequirement); Kelly v. McCulloch, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 154735 (D. Mon. 2010) (voters have \nstanding to challenge ballot access laws where they identify the candidate they wish to vote for \nbut cannot due to ballot access laws); Democratic Nat'l Comm. v. Reagan, 2018 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 77690 (D. Az. 2018) (where a political party is adversely impacted or potentially \nadversely impacted by a challenged elections regulation, they have standing to bring suit AND \ncompelling a political party to devote resources to comply with a regulation gives it standing); \nKelly v. McCulloch, 405 Fed. Appx. 218 (9th Cir. 2010) (voters have standing to challenge ballot \naccess laws); Thorsted v. Munro, 75 F.3d 454 (9th Cir. 1995) (same). \nB.  Plaintiffsโ Complaint states a claim \nDefendants claim that the injury and burden here is de minimis and thus Plaintiffs fail to \nstate a claim.  That assertion finds absolutely no support in the case law.  Plaintiffs have stated a \nclaim, for the same reasons they are entitled to a preliminary injunction, and incorporate their \nresponse below. \nC.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction \nThe gist of the Defendantโs response is threefold: first, they argue that Plaintiffs have not \nbeen diligent; second, they argue that others, not similarly situated, have been able to achieve \nsignature thresholds because, it appears, they began well before the COVID-19 pandemic \noccurred; and third, they argue that the threshold is not really burdensome this year, because it is \nnot burdensome in normal years. \nDefendants contentions are incorrect across the board. \nAs noted before, and as the updated declaration of Mr. Kohlhaas confirms, it is readily \napparent that the signature threshold will be impossible to meet by the August deadline (or at all) \nin 2020 if Plaintiffs were to circulate solely online.  In person signature gathering is thus \n5 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 14   Filed 07/03/20   Page 5 of 11\n\nnecessary.  Defendants have presented no evidence whatsoever that would suggest that electronic \nsignature gathering is an actual viable alternative. \nTurning to in person gathering, Defendants first argue that Plaintiffs have not been \ndiligent.  This assertion is belied by the Supplemental Declaration of Mr. Kohlhaas.  He \ndeclaration demonstrates that Plaintiffs have been diligent, and, in fact, have gathered 1,959 \nsignatures as of July 2, 2020.  His declaration demonstrates the significant difference (as can be \nseen from the results) between experienced petitioners and inexperienced petitioners, and that \nthis difference is more pronounced during the COVID-19 outbreak.  His declaration \ndemonstrates that Plaintiffs will continue to be diligent: they simply have no choice but to \nexhaust their best efforts to meet the required signatures by the required deadline.  But even then, \nit appears that they will probably come up short: perhaps barely short, but short nevertheless. \nThe Ninth Circuit has held that the burden on plaintiffs' rights should be measured by \nwhether, in light of the entire statutory scheme regulating ballot access, \"reasonably diligent\" \ncandidates can normally gain a place on the ballot, or whether they will rarely succeed in doing \nso. Libertarian Party of Washington v. Munro, 31 F.3d 759, 761-762 (9th Cir. 1994) (quoting \nStorer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 742 (1974)). \nThe comparisons Defendants make, to petition efforts that began well before the COVID-\n19 outbreak are simply not helpful.  Indeed, if Plaintiffs could have foreseen the COVID-19 \npandemic, and planned for it, they certainly would have begun their efforts last fall, when public \ngatherings were opened and crowded, crowds were present, and COVID-19 was nowhere to be \nfound.  But, COVID-19 was not foreseeable: not by Plaintiffs, not by Government officials, \nindeed not by anyone.  To argue, and make the comparison that Defendants make, that someone \nwho fortuitously began early is a comparator is simply inappropriate.  \n6 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 14   Filed 07/03/20   Page 6 of 11\n\nDefendants next argue that the Governorโs stay at home orders, through the middle of \nMay, are not the cause of the burden.  Certainly, they are not the only cause.  But the fact \nremains that the State of Alaska was locked down until the end of May.  And other public \nofficialโs orders that closed public spaces are still in force.4  And thus, Government action is \ncertainly partially a factor in the difficulty and burden in terms of the ability to petition, but, \nmore to the point, Government activity and burdens are the very essence of the requirement to \nachieve the threshold: a Alaska statute is being enforced against Plaintiffs in conditions that are \ndifficult, and perhaps impossible, to comply with. \nFinally, Defendants argue that the burden is โde minimisโ or โslight.โ  Those contentions \nare simply erroneous, both factually and legally.  It is easy to make light of the difficulty of \nsignature gathering sitting in the comfort of an office building by making an argument.  It is \nquite another thing to present evidence that it is as easy as Defendants make it out to be.  \nDefendants offer not one iota of proof to contradict Mr. Kohlhaasโ initial and supplemental \ndeclarations about the severe difficulties experienced by petitioners.  Defendants do not, for \ninstance, come in with a declaration of a signature gatherer who in any way contradicts the \ndeclaration of Mr. Kohlhaas.  That is telling, in no small part, because it not only demonstrates \nthat Mr. Kohlhaasโ testimony on this score is unrebutted, but also because it suggests that there is \nno one able or willing to rebut it.  \n \n4 http://www.anchoragelibrary.org/about/about-apl/library-news/apls-safe-opening-plans-and-\nservices/  (last visited 7/3/2020) (while the Library is partially open, it is clearly closed for \npetitioning requirements); http://alaskabaseballleague.org/view/alaskabaseballleague/ (last \nvisited 7/3/2020) (baseball season cancelled for 2020); \nhttps://sites.google.com/alaska.edu/coronavirus/status?authuser=0 (last visited 7/3/2020) \n(suggesting gathering activities that would be conducive to petitioning large groups of people are \nnot going on). \n7 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 14   Filed 07/03/20   Page 7 of 11\n\nUnder the prevailing U.S. Supreme Court cases of Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 760 \n(1983) and Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428 (1992), courts are first instructed to look at the \nburden of the requirement.  Where burden is severe, strict scrutiny applies.  Id.  Where the \nburden is โmore than minimalโ the flexible approach is used, which weighs the governmentโs \nasserted interest against the means by which it has chosen to pursue it.  Id. \nThis is not, as Defendants argue, a de minimis burden case.  Further, while signature \ngathering cases involving thousands of signatures are never a de minimis burden case, the \nsituation on the ground this year makes that doubly true.  Plaintiffs submit it is a โsevereโ burden \ncase, but even if it is not, it is at least a modest to significant burden, which warrants a weighing \nof the governmentโs asserted interest against the means that it has chosen to pursue it.  Id.  That \nweighing does not justify the full 1% threshold this year. \nGiven that Plaintiffs have successfully gathered 1,959 signatures as of July 2, 2020 \n(which means that Plaintiffs, per their usual experience, have gathered between 1,175 and 1,371 \nvalid signatures to date), and given that Plaintiffs continue to gather signatures at a rate of \napproximately 554 signatures a week (332 to 387 valid per week), or 79 per day, Plaintiffs \nacknowledge that a complete lifting of the signature requirement is likely not appropriate and \ndoes not take into account the asserted state interests. \nThus, Plaintiffs respectfully submit that this Court can fashion appropriate relief by \nlowering the threshold.  Plaintiffs have no plans to stop their efforts unless they are legally \nunable to continue those efforts due to lock down orders.  They submit that reducing the \nthreshold by 50% to 1,606 signatures would give them full and complete relief.  Even lowering \nthe current signature requirement of 3,212 signatures to 75% of the normal number, or 2,409 \nsignatures, is significant relief, which Plaintiffs will probably meet unless Alaska sees another \n8 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 14   Filed 07/03/20   Page 8 of 11\n\nCOVID-19 spike in the next month, such as is the case in Florida or Texas, or in the event that \nthe Governor locks the state down again to prevent such a spike. \nUnder Fair Maps Nev. v. Cegavske, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94696 (D. Nevada May 29, \n2020), it is not appropriate to compare Plaintiffs efforts to those who began gathering signatures \nlast year.  Rather, it is appropriate to see if anyone this year has met the threshold at issue.  And, \nas Defendants admit, no one at this time has met the limited party status.  Three weeks after their \nfiling on the Preliminary Injunction, it appears that Plaintiffs have an outside chance of reaching \nthe threshold.  But that is no reason to wait, or to deny relief.   \nIn the past two months, numerous federal courts have addressed ballot access or voting \nrequirements which, in normal times, are typically viewed as reasonable or appropriate even \nthough they are moderately burdensome, but which have become unreasonable and oppressive in \nlight of the COVID-19 outbreak.  Esshaki v. Whitmer, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 14376 (6th Cir. \n2020) (concluding petition gathering with the presence of COVID-19 and state orders regarding \nsame created a severe burden and ordering relief); Libertarian Party of Ill. v. Pritzker, 2020 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 71563 (ILND 2020) (order permitting previously qualified parties and loosening the \nsignature requirements in light of insurmountable hurdle of COVID-19); Garbett v. Herbert, \n2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75853 (Dist. Utah, 2020) (reducing signature requirements in light of \nCOVID-19 outbreak); Democratic Nat'l Comm. v. Bostelmann, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48394, \n2020 WL 1320819 (W.D. Wis. 2020) (extending deadline in light of \"excruciating dilemma that \nwill soon be faced by eligible voters . . . [to] either venture into public spaces, contrary to public \ndirectives and health guidelines or stay at home and lose the opportunity to vote.\"). \n9 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 14   Filed 07/03/20   Page 9 of 11\n\nApplication of the challenged statutes, as applied this year, with the situation now \npresented by the pandemic and as experienced by the Plaintiffs, who have demonstrated \nreasonable diligence, demonstrates a severe, constitutionally unacceptable burden. \nD.  Remedies \n  Plaintiffs seek a reduction in the threshold, by reducing the threshold by 50% to 1,606 \nsignatures, or to 75% of the normal number, or 2,409 signatures.  Given the concerns raised by \nthe Defendants on the deadline, if the relief on the signature requirements is granted, there is no \nreason to extend the deadline. \nIV.  Conclusion \nPlaintiffs respectfully request the preliminary injunctive relief of reducing the number of \nrequired signatures that they must turn in. \n            Respectfully Submitted, \n \n              /s/Christopher Wiest________________ \nChristopher Wiest (admitted pro hac vice) \nKY Bar No. 90725; OH Bar No. 0077931 \nChris Wiest, Atty at Law, PLLC \n25 Town Center Blvd, Suite 104 \nCrestview Hills, KY 41017 \n513/257-1895 (c) \n859/495-0803 (f) \nchris@cwiestlaw.com \n \n/s/Thomas Amodio       \nThomas Amodio, ABA No. 8511142 \nREEVES AMODIO LLC \n500 L Street, Suite 300 \nAnchorage, AK 99501 \nTelephone:  (907) 222-7100 \nFacsimile:  (907) 222-7199 \ntom@reevesamodio.com \nCo-counsel for Plaintiffs \n \n10 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 14   Filed 07/03/20   Page 10 of 11\n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \n \nI certify that I have served the foregoing upon all Counsel or parties, by filing a copy of the \nforegoing in the Courtโs CM/ECF system this 3 day of July, 2020. \n \n              /s/Christopher Wiest \n11 \n \nCase 3:20-cv-00127-JWS   Document 14   Filed 07/03/20   Page 11 of 11",
