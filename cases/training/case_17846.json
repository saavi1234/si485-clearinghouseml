    "summary": "<p>The Alliance Party, a national political party, and their 2020 presidential nominee, Roque \"Rocky\" De La Fuente, filed this case in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona on June 29, 2020, seeking to modify Arizona's signature collection and witnessing requirements for independent and third-party presidential candidates. The plaintiffs sued the Secretary of State of Arizona under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution for declaratory and injunctive relief regarding the state's signature requirement in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the state's restrictions on non-essential activities. The plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that, based on Arizona's ballot measures, the Alliance Party would need to collect 39,039 signatures to secure access to the 2020 general election ballot for president and vice president. While an electronic signature system is available in Arizona, plaintiffs argued that it would be impossible to communicate with voters without in-person contact. The plaintiffs also alleged that the Governor of Arizona's March 30 stay-at-home order, which was not lifted until May 12, prevented them from collecting signature's in-person by limiting in-person activities to essential functions. In addition, the plaintiffs argued that the signature ballot put their own petition circulators at risk of contracting COVID-19. The plaintiffs contended that the state's signature collection requirement, combined with COVID-19 restrictions and dangers, impaired their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. They claimed that the signature requirement was not narrowly tailored to advance a compelling governmental interest during the pandemic and that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury unless the requirement was lifted. The plaintiffs sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting the defendant from strict enforcement of the state's signature requirements. As an alternative to the current signature requirement, plaintiffs requested a lowered signature requirement of 3,904 or a filing fee of $5,000. The plaintiffs also sought a declaration that the signature requirements are unlawful as imposed against independent and third-party candidates during a public health emergency under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The case was assigned to Judge Michael T. Liburdi. On October 2, 2020, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their action. The case is now closed.</p>",

On April 23, 2020, Judge Rebecca R. Pallmeyer of the United States \n16 \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Illinois, preliminarily enjoined the number \n17 \nof signatures required to place the name of an independent candidate on the 2020 \n18 \n19 \ngeneral election ballot by reducing the number of signatures required to secure ballot \n20 \naccess to 10% of the normal statutory requirement as a result of the social distancing \n21 \n22  and  stay-at-home  orders  issued  to  stem  the  transmission  of  the  novel  Wuhan \n23 \ncoronavirus in Illinois.  See, Libertarian Party of Illinois v. Pritzker, 1:20-cv-02112, \n24 \nDoc. No. 27 (N.D. Ill, J. Pallmeyer, April 23, 2020). \n25 \n26 \n  3.  In support, Plaintiffs need only allege obvious and indisputable facts โ  \n27 \nthat the signature collection requirement imposed by Section 16-341 of the Arizona \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 3 of 28\n \n1  Revised Statutes on independent and third-party presidential candidates should be \n2 \nheld unconstitutional for the 2020 presidential election as a result of the ongoing \n3 \npandemic which makes it functionally impossible for independent and third-party \n4 \n5 \npresidential candidates to collect the required number of valid signatures to secure \n6 \nballot access for the 2020 Arizona general election. \n7 \n8    4.  Excessive ballot access requirements impair โcore political speechโ of \n9 \nboth candidates and voters afforded the highest level of constitutional protection \n10 \nunder the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n11 \n12 \n  5.  Under the current pandemic conditions and restrictions, as applied to \n13 \naccess to the 2020 presidential general election ballot, the requirements imposed on \n14 \n15  independent and third-party presidential candidates by A.R.S. ยง16-341 impose a \n16 \ntemporary severe restriction on rights guaranteed under the First and Fourteenth \n17 \nAmendments to the United States Constitution which are not narrowly tailored to \n18 \n19 \nadvance  a  compelling  governmental  interest  during  an  ongoing  public  health \n20 \nemergency  and  its  immediate  aftermath  and  are  unconstitutional  and  must  be \n21 \n22  immediately enjoined and/or modified. \n23 \n  6.

Venue is proper in the United States District Court for the District of \n21 \n22  Arizona under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b) because a substantial part of the events and \n23 \nomissions giving rise to Plaintiffsโ claims occurred in this district.  Furthermore, \n24 \nDefendant exercises her statutory authority within this district and maintains her \n25 \n26 \nprincipal office within this district. \n27 \n \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 5 of 28\n \n1  PARTIES \n2 \n  10.  Plaintiff Alliance Party (hereinafter sometimes โPlaintiff Alliance Partyโ \n3 \nor โAlliance Partyโ) was created on October 14, 2018, at a meeting in Denver, \n4 \n5 \nColorado when three political parties, the American Moderates Party, the Modern \n6 \nWhig Party and the American Party of South Carolina, agreed to merge to create the \n7 \n8  Alliance Party.  On January 4, 2019, the Alliance Party officially registered with the \n9 \nFederal Elections Commission.  Thereafter, the Independence Party merged with the \n10 \nAlliance Party in 2019; the American Alliance Party merged with the Alliance Party \n11 \n12 \nin 2019 and in 2020, the Independent Party of Connecticut formally merged with the \n13 \nAlliance Party. \n14 \n15    11.  Plaintiff Alliance Party is governed by the Alliance Party National \n16 \nCommittee.  Jim Rex is the Chairman of Plaintiff Alliance Party National Committee.  \n17 \nPlaintiff Alliance Partyโs mailing address is P.O. Box 1354, Anacortes, WA  98221. \n18 \n19 \n  12.  On April 25, 2020, Plaintiff Alliance Party conducted an online national \n20 \nconvention  and  formally nominated  Plaintiff  Roque  โRockyโ  De La  Fuente  of \n21 \n22  California as its 2020 nominee for the Office of President of the United States and \n23 \nDarcy Richardson of Florida as its 2020 nominee for the Office of Vice President of \n24 \nthe United States.  Owing to automatic ballot status in certain states, Plaintiff \n25 \n26 \nAlliance Partyโs presidential ticket secured immediate ballot access for the 2020 \n27 \ngeneral election in Delaware, South Carolina, Mississippi and Florida.   \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 6 of 28\n \n1    13.  Plaintiff Roque โRockyโ De La Fuente (hereinafter โPlaintiff โ), is the \n2 \n2020 nominee of Plaintiff Alliance Party for the Office of President of the United \n3 \nStates. \n4 \n5 \n  14.  Plaintiff  De  La  Fuente  intends  to  seek  ballot  access  for  the  2020 \n6 \npresidential general election in every state where is he permitted to secure ballot \n7 \n8  access. \n9 \n  15.  Plaintiff De La Fuente is over the age of 35, is a natural born citizen of \n10 \nthe United States of America, having been born in San Diego, California and has \n11 \n12 \nbeen a continual resident of the United States for over 35 years. \n13 \n  16.  Plaintiff De La Fuente satisfies all of the qualifications enumerated \n14 \n15  under the Presidential Qualification Clause of Article II, section 1, clause 5 of the \n16 \nUnited States Constitution. \n17 \n   17.  Defendant Katie Hobbs is sued in her official capacity as the chief \n18 \n19 \nelections official of the State of Arizona and charged with enforcing Section 16-341 \n20 \nof the Arizona Revised Statues.  Defendant Hobbs is the supervisor and director of \n21 \n22  all election matters in Arizona and is sued for declaratory and injunctive relief under \n23 \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201, as well as costs and attorneyโs fees under \n24 \n25  42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b). \n26 \n  18.  At all relevant times, Defendant is engaged in state action under color \n27 \nof state law. \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 7 of 28\n \n1  FACTS \n2 \n  19.  Plaintiff Alliance Party nominated their national ticket on April 25, \n3 \n2020. \n4 \n5 \n  20.  Plaintiff Alliance Party nominated Plaintiff Roque โRockyโ De La \n6 \nFuente as their 2020 nominee for the Office of President of the United States. \n7 \n8    21.  In Arizona, presidential candidates who do not seek to run under a \n9 \nrecognized political party label may be nominated to appear on the general election \n10 \nballot by gathering the required number of signatures on nomination petitions from \n11 \n12 \nregistered voters.  Once the candidate designates his or her vice-presidential running \n13 \nmate and completes other required paperwork, the candidateโs name (along with the \n14 \n15  candidateโs chosen label) will appear on Arizonaโs 2020 presidential general election \n16 \nballot alongside the recognized party nominees. \n17 \n  22.  Section 16-341(E) & (F) of the Arizona Revised States provides the \n18 \n19 \nsignature  requirements  and  deadlines  imposed  on  independent  presidential \n20 \ncandidates to gain access to Arizonaโs general election presidential ballot: \n21 \n22  (E)  The nomination petition shall conform as nearly as possible to the \nprovisions relating to nomination petitions of candidates to be voted for \n23 \nat primary elections and shall be signed by at least the number of \n24  persons who are registered to vote determined by calculating three \npercent of the persons who are registered to vote of the state, county, \n25 \nsubdivision or district for which the candidate is nominated who are not \n26 \nmembers of a political party that is qualified to be represented by an \n27  official party ballot at the next ensuing primary election an accorded \nrepresentation on the general election ballot. \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 8 of 28\n \n1   \n(F)  The percentage of persons who are registered to vote necessary to \n2 \nsign the nomination petition shall be determined by the total number of \n3  registered voters from other than political parties that are qualified to \nbe represented by an official party ballot at the next primary election \n4 \nand accorded representation on the general election ballot in the state, \n5 \ncounty, subdivision or district on January 2 of the year in which the \n6  general election is held.  Notwithstanding the method prescribed by \nsubsection E of this section and this subsection for calculating the \n7 \nminimum number of signatures necessary, and person who is registered \n8  to  vote  in  the  state,  county,  subdivision  or  district  for  which  the \ncandidate  is  nominated  is  eligible  to  sign  the  nomination  petition \n9 \nwithout regard to the signerโs party affiliation. \n10   \n  23.  On January 2, 2020, there were 1,301,292 registered voters in Arizona \n11 \n12 \nwho were not registered in a political party qualified to be represented by an official \n13 \nparty ballot at the next primary election and accorded representation on the 2020 \n14 \n15  general election ballot. \n16 \n  24.  As of June 18, 2020, Plaintiff Alliance Party is not a political party \n17 \nqualified in Arizona to be represented by an official party ballot at the next ensuing \n18 \n19 \nprimary election. \n20 \n  25.  Based on information published on Defendantโs official website, only \n21 \n22  the Republican, Democratic and Libertarian parties are qualified to nominate their \n23 \npresidential candidates by an official party ballot at the next ensuing primary election. \n24 \n  26.  Accordingly,  Plaintiff  Alliance  Party  must  collect  39,039  valid \n25 \n26 \nsignatures from registered voters on nomination petitions to secure access to the \n27 \n2020 general election ballot for Plaintiff Alliance Partyโs presidential and vice \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 9 of 28\n \n1  presidential nominees. \n2 \n  27.  Pursuant  to  A.R.S.  ยง16-341(G),  Plaintiff  Alliance  Party  must  file \n3 \nnomination petitions to place the name of Plaintiff De La Fuente on the 2020 general \n4 \n5 \nelection ballot no later than the sixtieth day before the general election. \n6 \n  28.  For the November 3, 2020, presidential general election, the deadline \n7 \n8  for Plaintiffs to file their nomination petition is 4 p.m. on September 4, 2020. \n9 \n  29.  Pursuant to A.R.S. ยง16-341(M), Defendant also permits nomination \n10 \npetitions to be signed electronically through the stateโs โE-Qualโ system. \n11 \n12 \n  30.  Despite the availability of the โE-Qualโ system, there is no reasonably \n13 \navailable method to permit Plaintiffs to contact Arizona voters to communicate their \n14 \n15  candidacy and the requirement for them to sign their nomination petition through the \n16 \nstateโs โE-Qualโ system without engaging in direct person-to-person contact. \n17 \n  31.  Accordingly,  the  stateโs  โE-Qualโ  system  is  not  a  reasonable, \n18 \n19 \nconstitutional  substitute  to  the  person-to-person  contact  between  Plaintiffsโ \n20 \ncirculators and Arizona voters necessary to secure the 39,039 valid signatures to \n21 \n22  qualify for the 2020 presidential general election ballot. \n23 \n  32.  Collecting signatures by hand, on paper nomination petitions, through \n24 \nface-to-face solicitation is inherently burdensome, labor-intensive and inefficient as \n25 \n26 \na means of demonstrating voter support.  Many signatures are often invalidated due \n27 \nto illegibility, missing information and other mere technical defects.  This obligates \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 9 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 10 of 28\n \n1  candidates and political parties to collect at least 25% to 50% more signatures than \n2 \nrequired, in order to account for those signatures that might be later invalidated.  In \n3 \nfact, in other states, such as Virginia, the Virginia Board of Elections expressly \n4 \n5 \nrecognize that candidate should collect at least 50% additional signatures above the \n6 \nminimum number by instructing candidates:  โBecause people who are not registered \n7 \n8  to vote often sign petitions for candidates, we recommend that you collect at least \n9 \n7,500 signatures. . . .โ  See, VIRGINIA STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS โHOW TO RUN \n10 \n11  FOR OFFICE FOR INDEPENDENT OR THIRD PARTY POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS: \n12 \nBALLOT ACCESS REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NOVEMBER 3, 2020 GENERAL ELECTION \n13 \nFOR PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENTโ at p. 9. \n14 \n15    33.  Accordingly, the number of raw signatures that Plaintiffs need to collect \n16 \nto secure ballot access for the 2020 Arizona presidential general election is between \n17 \n48,000 and 58,000. \n18 \n19 \n  34.  Colorado and Oklahoma have opted to impose a filing fee instead of \n20 \nsignature collection requirements for presidential candidates in order to protect their \n21 \n22  legitimate interest to limit access to their general election ballot and to prevent ballot \n23 \nclutter and voter confusion: \n24 \n    (a)  Colorado imposes a $1,000 filing fee, due August 5, 2020;  \n25 \n26 \n    (b)  Oklahoma imposes a $35,000 filing fee, due July 15, 2020. \n27 \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 10 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 11 of 28\n \n1    35.  In December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel \n2 \ncoronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China.  The respiratory disease caused by the novel \n3 \ncoronavirus has been named COVID-19 and is a highly infectious disease that is \n4 \n5 \nspread by person-to-person contact and, as of May 31, 2020, has resulted in over \n6 \n103,000 deaths in the United States and 369,000 deaths worldwide. \n7 \n8    36.  On January 30, 2020, long after the Wuhan novel coronavirus had \n9 \nspread  well  beyond  China,  the  World  Health  Organization  (โWHOโ)  finally \n10 \nclassified that COVID-19 constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International \n11 \n12 \nConcern. \n13 \n  37.  Immediately  after  the  WHO  declared  COVID-19  a  Public  Health \n14 \n15  Emergency of International Concern, and as a result of confirmed cases of COVID-\n16 \n19 in the United States in California and Washington, on January 31, 2020, Health \n17 \nand Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar declared a nationwide public health \n18 \n19 \nemergency retroactive to January 27, 2020. \n20 \n  38.  On February 27, 2020, to slow the spread of COVID-19, the United \n21 \n22  States Centers for Disease Control (โCDCโ) issued guidance recommending, among \n23 \nother things (such as frequent hand washing, and refraining from touching mouth \n24 \nand face with hands), that members of the public practice โsocial distancingโ a \n25 \n26 \npractice designed to minimize close contact with others to keep sick individuals from \n27 \ncoming  in  contact  with  healthy  individuals  in  order  to  limit  opportunities  for \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 11 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 12 of 28\n \n1  transmission of the Wuhan novel coronavirus.  The CDC continues to recommend \n2 \nthat  everyone  avoid  large  gatherings  and  crowds,  and  maintain  a  distance  of \n3 \napproximately six feet from all strangers (i.e., all non-family members). \n4 \n5 \n  39.  On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 to be a global \n6 \npandemic. \n7 \n8    40.  On March 13, 2020, the President of the United States declared a \n9 \nnational emergency, retroactive to March 2, 2020, due to uncontained community \n10 \ntransmission of the Wuhan novel coronavirus within the United States and the \n11 \n12 \nresulting expanding outbreak of COVID-19. \n13 \n  41.  On March 11, 2020, Arizona Governor Douglas Ducey issued and \n14 \n15  Defendant executed a state of emergency determining that the COVID-19 outbreak \n16 \npresents conditions in Arizona, which are or are likely to be beyond the control of \n17 \nthe services, personnel, equipment, and facilities of any single county, city or town, \n18 \n19 \nand which require the combined efforts of the State and the political subdivisions, \n20 \nand thus justifies a declaration of a State of Emergency which is to remain in effect \n21 \n22  until the resolution of the outbreak as determined by the Arizona Department of \n23 \nHealth Services. \n24 \n  42.  On March 19, 2020, Governor Ducey issued and Defendant executed \n25 \n26 \nExecutive Order 2020-08 extending the validity of driving permits that have an \n27 \nexpiration date between March 1, 2020 and September 1, 2020 for 6 month from the \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 12 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 13 of 28\n \n1  expiration date declaring that: โThe United States Center for Disease Control and \n2 \nPrevention (CDC) has stated that certain people are at higher risk of serious illness \n3 \nas a result of COVID-10 including older adults, people with serious chronic medical \n4 \n5 \nconditions like heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease, and the CDC recommends \n6 \nthat everyone, especially people who are at higher risk, should avoid crowds as much \n7 \n8  as possibleโ  and โminimizing required in-person visits to conduct government \n9 \nservices, including visiting Motor Vehicle Division Offices (MVD), is consistent \n10 \nwith CDC guidelines.โ   \n11 \n12 \n  43.  Also  on  March  19,  2020,  Governor  Ducey  issued  and  Defendant \n13 \nexecuted Executive Order 2020-19 limiting the operation of non-essential businesses \n14 \n15  in counties with COVID-19 cases for an indefinite period of time in order to โslow \n16 \nthe spread of COVID-19, declaring that: โThe disease caused by COVID-19 is \n17 \ncontagious and can be fatal, resulting in the World Health Organization declaring it \n18 \n19 \na global pandemic, andโฆ.the State of Arizona has experienced community spread \n20 \nof COVID-19โฆas it continues to spread across the country and state, posing an \n21 \n22  increasing threat to public healthโฆand, [w]hereas, on March 16, 2020, the CDC \n23 \nissued updated guidance recommending that individuals avoid gatherings of more \n24 \nthan 10 people.โ \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 13 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 14 of 28\n \n1    44.  On March 23, 2020, Governor Ducey issued and Defendant executed \n2 \nExecutive Order 2020-12, protecting certain essential businesses from local closures \n3 \nso long as social distancing is observed. \n4 \n5 \n  45.  On March 30, 2020, Governor Ducey issued and Defendant executed \n6 \nExecutive Order 2020-18 ordering that:  \n7 \n8  Arizona shall institute a โStay home, Stay healthy, Stay connectedโ \npolicy that promotes physical distancing, while also encouraging social \n9 \nconnectedness.  This builds on actions the state has already taken, and \n10  further memorializes some already in effect, to slow the spread of \nCOVID-19 ad protect our citizens. \n11 \n \n12 \nUnder this policy, all individuals in the State of Arizona shall limit time \n13  away from their place of residence or property, except: (a) To conduct \nor participate in Essential Activities, (b) For employment, to volunteer \n14 \nor participate in Essential Functions, (c) To utilize any services or \n15  products provided by Essential Businesses, (d) Employment, if as a sole \nproprietor or family owned business, work is conducted in a separate \n16 \noffice space from your home and the business is not open to serve the \n17  public, (e) No person shall be required to provide documentation or \nproof of their activities to justify their activities under this order. \n18 \n \n19 \n  46.  Executive  Order  2020-18  makes  no  provision  classifying  the \n20 \ncirculation of nomination petitions or election petitions to be an Essential activity. \n21 \n22    47.  Executive  Order  2020-18  expressly  forbids  the  circulation  of \n23 \nnomination petitions and election petitions providing that: โNon-essential business \n24 \nmay continue to operate those activities that do not require in-person, on-site \n25 \n26 \ntransactions....โ \n27 \n/// \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 14 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 15 of 28\n \n1    48.  Furthermore, Executive Order 2020-18 explains that:  \n2 \nโThe intent of this Executive Order is to ensure that people maintain \n3  physical  distance  to  the  maximum  extent  feasible,  while  enabling \nessential services to continue, protecting peopleโs rights and slowing \n4 \nthe spread of COVID-19 to the greatest extent possible.  When people \n5 \nneed to leave their places of residenceโฆthey should at all times and as \n6  much  as  reasonably  possible  comply  with  physical  distancing \nrecommendations.

Executive Order 2020-18 was initially in effect through April 30, 2020.  \n11 \nExecutive Order 2020-33 extended the โStay home, Stay Healthy, Stay Connectedโ \n12 \n13  order to May 15, 2020. \n14 \n  50.  Thereafter, Executive Order 2020-36, issued by Governor Ducey and \n15 \nexecuted by Defendant on May 12, 2020, rescinds the โStay at Homeโ order and sets \n16 \n17  the  parameters  for  the  partial  reopening  of  the  State  of  Arizona  while  still \n18 \nemphasizing that: \n19 \n20  (1) Arizona shall institute a โStay Healthy, Return Smarter, Return \nStrongerโ policy that promotes physical distancing, while encouraging \n21 \nsocial connectedness and allows businesses to gradually and safely \n22  open in compliance with federal guidelines as the state continues to \nmitigate and prevent the spread of COVID-19โฆ.(4) All individuals, \n23 \nwhen in public areas, should maximize physical distance from others.  \n24  Social settings where appropriate physical distancing is not practical \nshould be avoided unless precautionary measures are observed and \n25 \nCDC guidelines are followedโฆ.(8) The intent of this Executive Order \n26 \nis to ensure that the State of Arizona continues to mitigate the spread of \n27  COVID-19 to the greatest extent possible. \n \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 15 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 16 of 28\n \n1    51.  On April 7, 2020, Governor Ducey issued and Defendant executed \n2 \nExecutive  Order  2020-24  temporarily  imposed  isolation  or  self-quarantine \n3 \nrequirements for all persons who arrive in the State of Arizona from an area with \n4 \n5 \nsubstantial community spread of the novel Wuhan coronavirus providing that any \n6 \nperson who violates Executive Order 2020-24 may be charged with a Class 1 \n7 \n8  misdemeanor and subject to a fine not to exceed $2,500. \n9 \n  52.  On April 8, 2020, Governor Ducey issued and Defendant executed \n10 \nExecutive Order 2020-26 providing remote online notarization pursuant to rules \n11 \n12 \npromulgated by Defendant to ensure a secure identity verification process through \n13 \nonline audio-video technology permitting the notary and signer to converse in real-\n14 \n15  time as the signatures and tamper-proof seals are placed on the electronic document \n16 \nand following procedures outlined in A.R.S. ยงยง 41-371 through 41-380.  The order \n17 \nexplains  that:  โdue  to  the  spread  of  COVID-19,  the  CDC  issued  guidance \n18 \n19 \nencouraging people to telecommute and recommending that people adopt social \n20 \ndistancing practices by maintaining a distance of at least six feet from each other.  \n21 \n22    53.  Executive Order 2020-33, was issued on April 29, 2020 by Governor \n23 \nDucey and executed by Defendant to start the reopening process of the state while  \n24 \ncontinuing to warn that: \n25 \n26 \nโโฆto combat COVID-19, and at the recommendation of the stateโs \n27  health officials, the State of Arizona must continue its efforts by further \nlimiting potential exposure through a policy of physical distancing \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 17 of 28\n \n1  while  maintaining  social  connectedness,  andโฆ.although  strides  to \nassess, mitigate and prepare for the COVID-19 response and recovery \n2 \nhave been made, the current efforts in the State to limit potential \n3  exposure through a policy of physical distancing while maintaining \nsocial connectedness is necessaryโฆ.โ \n4 \n \n5 \n6    54.   Executive Order 2020-34, issued on May 4, 2020 permitting certain \n7 \nnon-essential business to reopen in Arizona, continues to incorporate the need to \n8 \nmaintain social distancing norms. \n9 \n10    55.  Governor Duceyโs new vehicle and driver licensing rules and remote \n11 \nnotarization  provisions  demonstrate  that  requiring  in-person  contact  to  satisfy \n12 \n13  Arizonaโs nomination petition requirements is not presently possible, has not been \n14 \npossible since Plaintiff Alliance Party nominated their national ticket on April 25, \n15 \n2020, and will continue to be severely problematic for the few remaining weeks left \n16 \n17  to file nomination petitions even if Governor Ducey fully rescinds his declared state \n18 \nof emergency. \n19 \n20    56.  In fact, Defendant herself continues to impose a closure of her own \n21 \noffice to prevent in-person filing of election petitions, instructing circulators and \n22 \ncandidates to mail their petitions to her office rather than file election petitions at her \n23 \n24  office in Phoenix. \n25 \n  57.  If Defendant continues to protect her own staff from the threat of in-\n26 \n27  person transmission of the Wuhan novel coronavirus, then she cannot advance any \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 17 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 18 of 28\n \n1  legitimate  argument  why  petition  circulators  need  to  subject  themselves  to  an \n2 \nexcessive threat of transmission by collecting the currently mandated over 39,000 \n3 \nsignatures to secure ballot access for Plaintiff De La Fuente.  \n4 \n5 \n  58.  The national health emergency declared in the United States by the \n6 \nPresident  effective  March  2,  2020,  the  CDC  social  distancing  guidelines  and \n7 \n8  Governor  Duceyโs  executive  orders  imposing  stay  at  home  and  6  foot  social \n9 \ndistancing requirements makes it nearly impossible for third-party and independent \n10 \npresidential candidates to collect the required number of valid signatures in order to \n11 \n12 \ngain access to the Arizonaโs 2020 general election ballot; and even if such signatures \n13 \ncan be collected the challenged requirement places the health and lives of petition \n14 \n15  circulators, voters and the public at large at unnecessary risk โ a risk that Defendant \n16 \nis not willing to impose on her own staff. \n17 \n  59.  Given the severity of the community transmission of the Wuhan novel \n18 \n19 \ncoronavirus and the resulting COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on Arizona, \n20 \nincluding the recent uptick in COVID-19 cases in Arizona after the state began the \n21 \n22  recent process of re-opening from lockdown, it remains uncertain whether many \n23 \nvoters will be willing to be approached by strangers (i.e., petition circulators) in \n24 \nsufficient  numbers  for  Plaintiffs  to  be  able  to  collect  the  required  number  of \n25 \n26 \nsignatures to secure ballot access โ a failure wholly unrelated to the level of support \n27 \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 18 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 19 of 28\n \n1  by Arizona voters to place Plaintiff De La Fuenteโs name on the 2020 Arizona \n2 \npresidential ballot. \n3 \n  60.  Petitioning to qualify candidates for the Arizonaโs November 3, 2020, \n4 \n5 \ngeneral election ballot is not defined as an โessentialโ activity under any of Governor \n6 \nDuceyโs executive orders. \n7 \n8    61.  Government officials at virtually every level are continuing to direct \n9 \npeople to stay at home and/or to continue to practice social distancing and to avoid \n10 \nproximity to any non-family member within 6 feet. \n11 \n12 \n  62.  Simply stated, short of wide-spread vaccination for the Wuhan novel \n13 \ncoronavirus, which will not occur, at the earliest, until the end of 2020 (fingers \n14 \n15  crossed), there is no evidence that the social distancing conditioning imposed by \n16 \nGovernor Duceyโs state of emergency and associated executive orders, as well as, \n17 \nthe federal CDC guidance and public campaigns to convince the public that social \n18 \n19 \ndistancing is necessary for the public health, it will remain nearly impossible to \n20 \ncollect a sufficient number of valid signatures solely because citizens do not want \n21 \n22  strangers  to  approach  them  within  6  feet  which  is  necessary  for  any  petition \n23 \ncirculator to communicate with voters and to collect their signatures. \n24 \n  63.  It  is  impossible  to  collect  a  signature  on  an  election  petition  and \n25 \n26 \nmaintain 6 feet of social distancing. \n27 \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 19 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 20 of 28\n \n1    64.  For instance, Governor Jay Inslee of Washington, in Proclamation 20-\n2 \n53 issued on May 5, 2020, modified certain ballot access requirements in the State \n3 \nof Washington acknowledging that:  \n4 \n5 \nWHEREAS, not all candidates for public office have the means to pay \n6  the required filing fee to be included on the ballot for election, and the \nstatutory alternative to paying the fee involves collecting a sufficient \n7 \nnumber of signatures from voters, which is very difficult to do by the \n8  May 15, 2020, deadline without the person-to-person contact currently \nprohibited by Proclamation 20-25 and as amended (Stay Home Stay \n9 \nHealthy); and \n10   \nโฆ. \n11 \n \n12 \nBased on the above noted situation and under the provisions of RCW \n13  43.06.220(2)(g), I also find that, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, \nstrict  compliance  with  [ballot  access  signature  requirements]  will \n14 \nprevent, hinder, or delay action that is necessary to prevent person-to-\n15  person contact and to remove barriers that prevent some candidates for \nelection in Washington State from being included on the ballot for \n16 \nelectionโฆ. \n17   \n  65.  By  Executive  Order  New  York  Governor  Cuomo  indefinitely \n18 \n19 \nsuspended the circulation of all election petitions in New York for independent and \n20 \nthird-party candidates in New York. \n21 \n22    66.  Governor  Ducey  has  issued  multiple  executive  orders  delaying  or \n23 \nmodifying  dozens  of  Arizona  laws  to  accommodate  the  social  distancing \n24 \nrequirements  to  help  prevent  the  spread  of  the  Wuhan  novel  coronavirus  and \n25 \n26 \nCOVID-19.  However, Governor Ducey has failed to modify any of the ballot access \n27 \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 20 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 21 of 28\n \n1  requirements imposed solely on third-party and independent presidential candidates \n2 \nto secure ballot access for the 2020 presidential election. \n3 \n  67.  Collecting  signatures  on  nomination  petitions  during  the  current \n4 \n5 \nCOVID-19 pandemic endangers not only the health and lives of Arizona voters, but \n6 \nalso the health and lives of petition circulators and the public at large.  If a petition \n7 \n8  circulator or voter is infected of the Wuhan novel coronavirus and is not so aware, \n9 \nthe collection of signatures for nomination petitions place everyone at risk of further \n10 \ntransmission of the virus responsible for COVID-19. \n11 \n12 \n  68.  Furthermore, as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unlikely \n13 \nthat petition circulators will be able to gather signatures because there are fewer \n14 \n15  people congregating in public places and fewer people likely to open their doors to \n16 \nuninvited strangers seeking to collect signatures on election petitions. \n17 \n  69.  Even  after  the  public  health  emergency  is  lifted,  the  COVID-19 \n18 \n19 \npandemic  will  continue  with  predictions  from  federal  health  officials  such  as \n20 \nAnthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, \n21 \n22  of a second COVID-19 wave if CDC social distancing guidelines are not followed \n23 \neven after states begin to allow non-essential commercial activity to resume.

Even after the pandemic subsides, the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to \n2 \ncontinue to have a negative effect on signature collection for nomination petitions in \n3 \nArizona for a substantial period of time extending beyond the current election cycle. \n4 \n5 \n  71.  Available voter registration data provides no information that would \n6 \nfacilitate the ability of Plaintiffs to conduct a petition drive and secure signatures \n7 \n8  solely through Arizonaโs โE-Qualโ system. \n9 \n  72.  The challenged signatures requirement was adopted long before the \n10 \nadvent of the online โE-Qualโ system and the excessive number of signatures that \n11 \n12 \nindependent and third-party presidential candidates are required to collect to secure \n13 \nballot access never contemplated that such a large number of signatures could be \n14 \n15  collected through online electronic signatures.  Nor has Arizona made any effort to \n16 \nfacilitate the collection of a significant number of nomination petition signatures \n17 \nsolely through the โE-Qualโ system, such as providing email addresses for registered \n18 \n19 \nvoters (as some state provide). \n20 \n  73.  The costs of alternative public advertising, as opposed to direct person-\n21 \n22  to-person contact through petition circulators, needed to make the โE-Qualโ system \n23 \naccount for the collection of a significant percentage of the signatures required to \n24 \ngain ballot access for independent and third-party presidential candidates imposes \n25 \n26 \nsuch a severe impairment on โcore political speechโ that forced reliance on the โE-\n27 \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 22 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 23 of 28\n \n1  Qualโ system is, itself, a violation of rights guaranteed to Plaintiffs under the First \n2 \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  \n3 \n  74.  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  recognized  that  presidential \n4 \n5 \nelections are unique as they are the only national elections and decided beyond the \n6 \nborders of any one state, such that states have a diminished interest in imposing their \n7 \n8  most restrictive ballot access requirements. \n9 \n  75.  The โE-Qualโ system was not designed or intended to be the sole means \n10 \nto collect petition signatures in Arizona, especially as applied to independent and \n11 \n12 \nthird-party presidential ballot access is inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent. \n13 \n  76.  Plaintiff De La Fuente has demonstrated substantial public support in \n14 \n15  securing ballot access as the presidential nominee of the both the American Delta \n16 \nParty and the Reform Party in the 2016  presidential general election in Alaska, \n17 \nNevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, \n18 \n19 \nWisconsin,  Iowa,  Minnesota,  Kentucky,  Tennessee,  Mississippi,  Florida,  New \n20 \nJersey, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Vermont. \n21 \n22    77.  Plaintiffs have secured automatic ballot access for the 2020 presidential \n23 \ngeneral election in Florida, South Carolina, Mississippi and Delaware. \n24 \n  78.  In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the requested remedy of modifying \n25 \n26 \nArizona law to order Defendant to print Plaintiff De La Fuenteโs name on the 2020 \n27 \nArizona  presidential  ballot  if  either:  (1)  Plaintiffs  file  a  nomination  petition \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 23 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 24 of 28\n \n1  containing valid signatures equal to 10% of the statutory mandate (i.e., 3,904 valid \n2 \nsignatures); or, in the alternative, (2) Plaintiffs timely pay of a filing fee of $5,000, \n3 \nin lieu of collecting signatures on nomination petitions, will both ensure that only \n4 \n5 \nlegitimate presidential candidates will appear on the Arizona presidential ballot and \n6 \nprotect the integrity of a national election by permitting candidates who have secured \n7 \n8  ballot access in other states to secure access on all other state ballots through reduced \n9 \nsignature collection requirement and/or filing fees in lieu of signature collection.  \n10 \n  79.  Arizona law, together with the Wuhan novel coronavirus, the COVID-\n11 \n12 \n19 pandemic and Governor Duceyโs executive orders imposing restrictions on social \n13 \ncontacts and the Governorโs failure to amend Arizona election laws to protect \n14 \n15  Plaintiffsโ  severely  impaired  rights  guaranteed  under  the  First  and  Fourteenth \n16 \nAmendments to the United States Constitution for the 2020 election, is the direct \n17 \ncause of injury-in-fact to Plaintiffsโ rights under the federal constitution. \n18 \n19 \n  80.  Plaintiffsโ  injuries  are  fairly  traceable  to  Arizona  laws  requiring \n20 \nPlaintiffs to collect a minimum of 39,039 valid signatures, without permitting any \n21 \n22  modification during public health emergencies. \n23 \n  81.  This Court has the authority to provide complete relief and redress \n24 \nPlaintiffsโ  injuries  by  issuing  prospective  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief \n25 \n26 \nprohibiting  Defendantsโ  strict  enforcement  of  A.R.S.  ยง  16-341  and  ordering \n27 \nDefendantsโ to place Plaintiff De La Fuenteโs name on the 2020 Arizona presidential \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 24 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 25 of 28\n \n1  ballot  if:  (1)  Plaintiffs  timely  file  nomination  petition  containing  3,904  valid \n2 \nsignatures (10% of the statutory requirement); or, in the alternative, (2) Plaintiffsโ \n3 \ntimely pay a $5,000 filing fee in lieu of filing a nomination petition.   \n4 \n5 \n  82.  Plaintiffs have no other remedy available at law. \n6 \nCAUSE OF ACTION \n7 \n8  COUNT I \n(First Amendment) \n9 \n \n10    83.  Plaintiffs reassert each preceding paragraph as if set forth fully herein. \n11 \n  84.  In  light  of  the  ongoing  public  health  emergency  caused  by  the \n12 \n13  community transmission of the Wuhan novel coronavirus and resulting COVID-19 \n14 \npandemic and the actions and inactions taken by Governor Ducey to enforce social \n15 \ndistancing requirements to retard the community transmission of the coronavirus in \n16 \n17  Arizona, while taking no action to alleviate ballot access requirements for third-party \n18 \nand  independent  presidential  candidates,  the  in-person  signature  collection \n19 \n20  requirements imposed by A.R.S. ยง 16-341(A)  severely impair rights guaranteed to \n21 \nPlaintiffs  under  the  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  United  States \n22 \nConstitution as applied to the 2020 general election. \n23 \n24    85.  The signature collection requirements imposed on independent and \n25 \nthird-party presidential candidates by A.R.S. ยง 16-341(A) is not narrowly tailored to \n26 \n27  advance a compelling governmental interest during the state of emergency and \n28 \nCIVIL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 25 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01276-MTL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 26 of 28\n \n1  public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic where face-to-face signature \n2 \ncollection is currently unlawful and nearly impossible for the foreseeable future as a \n3 \nresult  of  the  long-term  social  distancing  conditioning  of  voters  resulting  from \n4 \n5 \ngovernment action to stem the current and future outbreaks of COVID-19. \n6 \n  86.  Under  the  circumstances  of  the  current  COVID-19  pandemic  and \n7 \n8  Governor Duceyโs executive orders seeking to contain the further spread of the virus \n9 \ncausing COVID-19 and in combination with the failure of Governor Ducey to \n10 \nmodify  signature  collection  requirements  for  independent  and  third-party \n11 \n12 \npresidential candidates contesting the 2020 presidential election, a real and actual \n13 \ncontroversy exists between the parties. \n14 \n15    87.  Plaintiffs are suffering and will continue to suffer irreparable injury as \n16 \na direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein unless Defendantโs \n17 \nstrict enforcement of A.R.S. ยง 16-341 is declared unlawful and enjoined as applied \n18 \n19 \nto the 2020 general election. \n20 \n  88.
