This “blank space” policy led USCIS to reject thousands of applications. Some rejected applications had only one blank response field. Others included the phrase “not applicable” in lieu of “N/A,” another policy violation. USCIS also failed to notify applicants when their applications were rejected. Consequently, many benefit seekers––including abandoned and abused children, survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking, and asylum seekers––missed deadlines and lost the ability to obtain benefits for themselves, their children, and other family members. </p><p>Represented by National Immigration Litigation Alliance (NILA), Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (NWIRP), and private counsel, the plaintiffs sued USCIS and DHS under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act. The government allegedly violated the APA by failing to provide a reasoned explanation for the blank space policy, failing to follow proper procedures when adopting the policy, and defying USCIS regulations. The plaintiffs argued that the policy served no legitimate purpose and was adopted only to prevent vulnerable immigrants from obtaining immigration benefits. Per the complaint, the plaintiffs sought an injunction prohibiting USCIS from enforcing the policy and requiring USCIS to notify individuals whose applications were rejected as a result of it. The plaintiffs also moved for class certification the same day that the complaint was filed. The case was assigned to Judge Haywood S. Gilliam, Jr. </p><p>On January 14, 2021, Judge Gilliam, Jr., granted a stipulation by both parties to temporarily halt the proceedings to allow pending settlement talks to continue. The stay was extended on February 18 and again on March 25.</p><p>On July 19, 2021, the parties filed a joint motion asking the court to approve their settlement agreement. The agreement, which was attached to the motion as an exhibit, provided that USCIS had rescinded the No Blank Space Rejection Policy as of December 23, 2020, would allow people who were rejected under the policy to resubmit for the same benefit within a year of the date the settlement became effective, would review documents that were initially rejected and resubmitted as having been submitted on the original submission date, and would notify people rejected under the policy of their ability to resubmit for the denied benefits. The court approved the settlement agreement on July 20, 2021, and the case was closed on August 10, 2021.</p>",

In late 2019, without notice to the public, Defendant U.S. Citizenship and \n3 \nImmigration Services (USCIS) implemented a tectonic shift in immigration adjudications requiring \n4 \nits employees to arbitrarily reject thousands of applications from vulnerable immigrants. Notably, \n5 \nUSCIS’s new policy targeted applications seeking humanitarian benefits: from those seeking \n6 \nrefuge from persecution (asylum applications), survivors of domestic violence and other crimes \n7 \n8  who voluntarily cooperate with law enforcement (U visa petitions), survivors of human trafficking \n9  (T visa petitions), widows of U.S. citizens, special immigrant juveniles, and those seeking \n10 \nprotection from an abusive spouse, parent, or child (I-360 petitions).  \n11 \n2.  The new policy called for USCIS employees to reject these applications or petitions \n12 \n(hereinafter applications) if they found that any field was left blank on the multi-page applications, \n13 \nirrespective of the materiality or applicability of the unanswered question. Indeed, USCIS rejected \n14 \nthousands of applications pursuant to its new, draconian policy for either failing to respond to a \n15 \n16  question or for responding in a manner indicating that the field was not applicable that the USCIS \n17 \ndetermined was inappropriate.   \n18 \n3.  This “rejection policy” or “blank space policy” has led to absurd and unfairly \n19 \nprejudicial results. One such example—Plaintiff I.S.A.—is a survivor of a violent crime who \n20 \nhelped the police investigate her attackers and then sought a U visa for herself and her two minor \n21 \nchildren. USCIS rejected her application because she left blank fields that did not apply to her, \n22 \n23  such as the “other names” fields on her application forms. Neither she nor her sons have ever used \n24  other names. By the time USCIS rejected the application and she subsequently refiled, her older \n25 \nson had turned 21 years old and was no longer eligible to be included for the status that the rest of \n26 \nhis family could obtain. Consequently, her son now faces deportation. As Ms. S.A.’s case \n27 \ndemonstrates, the new rejection policy creates irrational and unnecessary obstacles that cause \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 1            \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 3 of 31\n \n1  irreparable harm for the most vulnerable noncitizens, separating families and depriving immigrants \n2 \nof the protections Congress sought to provide.  \n3 \n4.  For decades prior to this unannounced new policy, USCIS accepted applications \n4 \nthat left blank fields which did not apply to the applicant and which were not critical to eligibility \n5 \nfor the requested benefit. For example, applicants regularly left blank fields for a “middle name” if \n6 \nthey did not have one, for “other names used” if there were none, for family members if they had \n7 \n8  none, or for nonexistent address information, such as an apartment number. Knowing that such \n9  information did not affect an applicant’s eligibility or the agency’s ability to adjudicate such \n10 \napplications, USCIS accepted and processed the applications.  \n11 \n5.  In violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the new rejection policy \n12 \n(or blank space policy) was not published in the Federal Register or subject to notice and comment \n13 \nrulemaking. In fact, USCIS never explained its reasoning for the policy. As a result, the agency \n14 \ndisregarded settled reliance interests of applicants, the needs of pro se applicants, and alternatives \n15 \n16  to the policy that would ensure that USCIS obtains the information it needs to adjudicate the \n17 \napplication. Confoundingly, for some forms, the policy also contradicts specific instructions about \n18 \nhow to complete the application—instructions that were published in the Federal Register and that \n19 \nhave the force of law.  \n20 \n6.  The new policy has resulted in breathtakingly high rejection rates of applications \n21 \nand petitions. For example, from late-2019—when the policy was first implemented—to July \n22 \n23  2020, USCIS rejected nearly 12,000 U visa petitions filed by victims of enumerated crimes who \n24  have collaborated with law enforcement.   \n25 \n7.  Additionally, because the policy is confusing and internally inconsistent, USCIS \n26 \noften fails to apply it correctly or consistently. USCIS has rejected applications that do, in fact, \n27 \ninclude answers to all fields, as well as applications that leave a particular field blank, such as \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 2            \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 4 of 31\n \n1  location of a parent, even when another answer specifically indicates that the field is not relevant \n2 \n(such as indicating that the parent is deceased). \n3 \n8.

Castaneda Penate, on behalf \n4 \nof themselves and similarly situated individuals, challenge this “Kafkaesque new processing \n5 \npolicy.”1 Each had their application rejected pursuant to the policy or the misapplication of the \n6 \npolicy. For each, the policy and the subsequent rejection has resulted in irreparable harm, such as \n7 \n8  loss of eligibility for their children to obtain status as derivatives, loss of the ability to even apply \n9  for an immigration benefit because a deadline has passed, or many months of additional delay \n10 \nbefore they will receive employment authorization and other benefits. \n11 \n9.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief that would (1) set aside the rejection \n12 \npolicy, and (2) compel Defendants to deem applications filed as of the date USCIS initially \n13 \nreceived them—and not as of the date the agency later accepted the refiling of the previously-\n14 \nrejected application. \n15 \n16  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n17 \n10.  This case arises under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et \n18 \nseq.  \n19 \n11.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as a civil action arising \n20 \nunder the laws of the United States, and the Mandamus and Venue Act of 1962, 28 U.S.C. § 1361. \n21 \nThe Court may grant declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202, 5 \n22 \n23  U.S.C. § 702, and 28 U.S.C. § 1361. The United States has waived its sovereign immunity \n24  pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 702.  \n25 \n \n1   Opinion, Catherine Rampell, This Latest Trick from the Trump Administration Is One of the \n26 \nMost Despicable Yet, Wash.

Venue is proper in the Northern District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  \n2 \n§ 1391(e), because Defendants are officers or employees of the United States or agencies thereof \n3 \nacting in their official capacities. A substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the \n4 \nclaims occurred in this district, and Plaintiffs Akhilesh R. Vangala and I.S.A. reside in this district, \n5 \nas do many putative class members.  \n6 \nINTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n7 \n8  13.  The claims of Plaintiff I.S.A. arise in the county of San Francisco, in the city of San \n9  Francisco. Therefore, assignment to the San Francisco Division of this Court is proper under N.D. \n10 \nLocal Rule 3-2(d). \n11 \nPARTIES \n12 \n14.  Plaintiff Akhilesh R. Vangala is a noncitizen from India who entered the United \n13 \nStates on a student visa and subsequently became the victim of a crime. On or about April 1, 2020, \n14 \nMr. Vangala submitted his petition for a U visa using Form I-918. On May 27, 2020, USCIS \n15 \n16  rejected his petition pursuant to its new policy. However, the rejection notice was not delivered to \n17 \nMr. Vangala’s attorney until June 29, 2020. Because of USCIS’s rejection, Mr. Vangala’s place in \n18 \nthe U visa queue is many months further behind where it should be, and he remains without \n19 \nemployment authorization.  \n20 \n15.  Plaintiff I.S.A. is a noncitizen from Guatemala who has lived in the United States \n21 \nfor more than 15 years. On December 30, 2019, I.S.A. submitted a petition for a U visa using Form \n22 \n23  I-918 and included her children as derivatives using Form I-918, Supplement A. USCIS rejected \n24  I.S.A.’s petitions pursuant to its new policy on January 30, 2020. As a consequence of USCIS’s \n25 \nrejection, I.S.A.’s oldest son aged out of eligibility for inclusion as a derivative on I.S.A.’s \n26 \nsubsequently refiled U visa petition and now faces the threat of deportation. \n27 \n16.  Plaintiff Kenny M. Castaneda Penate is a noncitizen from El Salvador who \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 4            \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 6 of 31\n \n1  entered the United States in 2019 with her two minor children to seek asylum. On July 9, 2020, \n2 \nwithin one year of arriving in the United States, Ms. Castaneda filed an application for asylum \n3 \n(and associated relief) using Form I-589 and included her two children as derivatives. On July 14, \n4 \n2020, USCIS rejected Ms. Castaneda’s application based on the assertion that the application did \n5 \nnot comply with its new policy. As a result, she missed the statutory one-year deadline for filing \n6 \nher asylum application.  \n7 \n8  17.  Defendant U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is a component of the \n9  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), 6 U.S.C. § 271(a)(1), and an “agency” within the \n10 \nmeaning of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). USCIS is responsible for adjudicating humanitarian \n11 \nimmigration benefit applications.  \n12 \n18.  Defendant U.S. Department of Homeland Security is an executive agency of the \n13 \nUnited States and an “agency” within the meaning of the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). DHS is \n14 \nresponsible for implementing the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including provisions \n15 \n16  relating to humanitarian immigration benefit applications. DHS has authority to adjudicate such \n17 \napplications and delegates this authority to USCIS.  \n18 \nLEGAL BACKGROUND \n19 \n19.  USCIS’s new rejection policy creates significant procedural hurdles preventing \n20 \nPlaintiffs from successfully submitting applications. In addition, the delays caused by the rejection \n21 \npolicy substantively impact, and in some cases, permanently foreclose, class members from \n22 \n23  qualifying for the humanitarian benefits provided by Congress. \n24  I.  Legal Framework for Immigration Benefits \n25 \n20.  Plaintiffs and proposed class members are, inter alia, victims of violent crimes, \n26 \nhuman trafficking, and domestic violence; children who have been abandoned, abused, or \n27 \nneglected; widowers; and affirmative asylum seekers who have filed applications with USCIS in \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 5            \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 7 of 31\n \n1  order to secure lawful status in the United States.  \n2 \n21.  Remarkably, in rolling out its new rejection policy, USCIS has targeted precisely \n3 \nthose applications required to obtain humanitarian benefits, including the follow forms of relief:  \n4 \nA.  Asylum \n5 \n22.   Noncitizens fleeing persecution or torture may apply to USCIS for asylum (and \n6 \nrelated relief) by filing Form I-589 (Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal). \n7 \n8  The asylum statute directs the Attorney General to “establish a procedure for the consideration of \n9  asylum applications” filed by noncitizens “physically present in the United States.” 8 U.S.C. \n10 \n§ 1158(a), (e).  \n11 \n23.  Asylum seekers must file applications within one year of their last arrival in the \n12 \nUnited States (with certain limited exceptions). Id. § 1158(a)(2)(B).  \n13 \n24.  Following a waiting period, asylum applicants are eligible to apply for and be \n14 \ngranted employment authorization while their asylum applications remain pending. 8 C.F.R. \n15 \n16  § 208.3(c)(3).  \n17 \n25.  Those who are granted asylum may not be removed to the country in which they \n18 \nfear persecution, may obtain legal status, are authorized to work, and may apply for lawful \n19 \npermanent residence after one year. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(c)(1)(A) (prohibiting removal); id. § 1159(b) \n20 \n(authorizing adjustment of status); id. § 1158(c)(1)(B) (employment authorization); 8 C.F.R. \n21 \n§ 208.7(a) (employment authorization). In addition, an asylee may seek to include a spouse and/or \n22 \n23  children in an application, or once it is granted, file a petition to accord them derivative asylum \n24  status. 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.21(a), 208.3(a).  \n25 \nB.  U Visas  \n26 \n26.  Congress passed the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 \n27 \n(VAWA 2000) in order to “combat trafficking in persons, especially into the sex trade, slavery, \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 6            \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 8 of 31\n \n1  and involuntary servitude,” and to reauthorize existing programs aimed at preventing violence \n2 \nagainst women. Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106–386, \n3 \n114 Stat. 1464 (2000).  \n4 \n27.  Victims of violent crimes who provide assistance to law enforcement officials may \n5 \npetition for a U visa for themselves and certain close relatives by filing Form I-918 (Petition for U \n6 \nNonimmigrant Status), and the relevant accompanying forms, including Form I-918, Supplement \n7 \n8  A (Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Recipient), and the required Form I-918, \n9  Supplement B (U Nonimmigrant Status Certification completed by the certifying law enforcement \n10 \nofficer or a judge). 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U); 8 C.F.R. § 214.14. \n11 \nC.  T Visas \n12 \n28.  Victims of human trafficking may petition for a T visa by filing Form I-914 \n13 \n(Application for T Nonimmigrant Status), and relevant accompanying forms, including Form I-\n14 \n914, Supplement A (Application for Immediate Family Member of T-1 Recipient), and the \n15 \n16  optional Form I-914, Supplement B (Declaration of Law Enforcement Officer for Victim of \n17 \nTrafficking in Persons).  \n18 \n29.  To apply for a T Visa, a trafficking victim must file Form I-914 and initial evidence \n19 \nwith USCIS. 8 C.F.R. § 214.11(d)(1)–(2). Noncitizens applying for T visas may also apply for \n20 \nderivative T visas for qualifying family members by submitting Form I-914, Supplement A and \n21 \ninitial evidence to USCIS for each family member for whom the applicant seeks a derivative T \n22 \n23  visa. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(T)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 214.11(k)(1).   \n24  D.  Self-Petitions and Petitions to Remove Conditions of Residence \n25 \n30.  Congress created Special Immigrant Visas for several groups of noncitizens, 8 \n26 \nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(27), including especially vulnerable populations such as children who have been \n27 \nplaced with custodians by state courts due to abandonment, abuse, or neglect, id. § 1101(a)(27)(J). \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 7            \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 9 of 31\n \n1  31.  To apply for a Special Immigrant Visa, the noncitizen must file Form I-360, along \n2 \nwith the required supporting documentation. 8 C.F.R. §§ 204.5, 204.11.  \n3 \n32.  A youth applying for a special immigrant juvenile visa—one type of Special \n4 \nImmigrant Visa—must first be declared dependent upon a juvenile court or placed in the custody \n5 \nof a state agency or a court appointed individual, and have been the subject of certain fact findings. \n6 \n8 C.F.R. § 204.11(c)(3)–(6). To obtain special immigrant status, the youth must then file an \n7 \n8  application before the state court loses jurisdiction over the youth, and in all cases, before the \n9  youth turns 21 years old. Id. § 204.11(c)(1). \n10 \n33.  Congress has also provided a process for self-petitions whereby widows and victims \n11 \nof domestic violence with qualifying relationships may file a self-petition in order to secure status \n12 \nand stability in this country without reliance on the U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident \n13 \nfamily member. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1151(b)(2)(A)(i), 1154(a)(1)(A)(iii). \n14 \n34.  A self-petition is filed on Form I-360, along with the required supporting evidence. \n15 \n16  8 C.F.R. 204.2(b)(2); id. § 204.2(c)(6)(ii). \n17 \n35.  Noncitizens who have been granted conditional residence status due to their recent \n18 \nmarriage to a U.S. citizen (or due to their biological parent’s marriage to a U.S. citizen), are \n19 \nrequired to file a joint petition to remove conditions of residence within two years of being granted \n20 \nsuch status. 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(1)(A). Congress has also provided relief for conditional \n21 \npermanent residents who are widows or victims of domestic violence, allowing for them to seek a \n22 \n23  waiver from the joint filing. 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(1)(A), (c)(4). \n24  36.  This petition to remove conditions of residence is submitted on Form I-751. 8 \n25 \nC.F.R. § 216.4(a)(1). \n26 \n \n27 \n \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 8            \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 10 of 31\n \n1  II.  USCIS’s Instructions Regarding the Application and Receipt Process \n2 \n37.  USCIS publishes written instructions for completing forms for immigration \n3 \nbenefits, such as Form I-589, Form I-918, Form I-914, Form I-360, and Form I-751. These \n4 \npublished instructions go through notice and comment procedures and are available with the forms \n5 \non the USCIS website.  \n6 \n38.  The instructions are incorporated into the regulations governing the submission of \n7 \n8  each form and therefore carry the force of law. 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(a)(1). \n9  39.  For the vast majority of USCIS forms, including those at issue in this case, an \n10 \napplication is submitted to USCIS by sending a completed paper copy of the application form, \n11 \nwith supporting documentation, to a specific USCIS office. If USCIS accepts the application form, \n12 \nUSCIS sends the applicant a Notice of Action on Form I-797C acknowledging its receipt of the \n13 \napplication (including any supplements) “as of the actual date of receipt.” 8 C.F.R. \n14 \n§ 103.2(a)(7)(i).  \n15 \n16  40.  If the application is missing evidence, the governing regulations provide that \n17 \nUSCIS may either: (a) deny the benefit; (b) request that the applicant or petitioner submit more \n18 \ninformation or evidence by a date certain (Request for Evidence, or RFE); or (c) notify the \n19 \napplicant or petitioner of an intent to deny the benefit and require a response by a date certain \n20 \n(Notice of Intent to Deny, or NOID). 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(b)(8)(ii), (iii). \n21 \n41.  RFEs or NOIDs “specify the type of evidence required” to establish eligibility for \n22 \n23  the immigration benefit. Id. § 103.2(b)(8)(iv). USCIS sends these documents through regular or \n24  electronic mail. \n25 \n42.  When USCIS follows the governing regulatory RFE or NOID process, it does not \n26 \nreject the application. Rather, USCIS treats the application filed as of the date of receipt and \n27 \nprovides a date certain by which an applicant must submit the missing information or evidence.  \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 9            \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 11 of 31\n \n1  43.  Indeed, the regulations authorize USCIS to reject an application form in only four \n2 \nsituations: if the application is not: 1) “[s]igned with [a] valid signature;” 2) “[e]xecuted;” 3) \n3 \n“[f]iled in compliance with the regulations governing the filing of the specific application, petition, \n4 \nform, or request;” or 4) “[s]ubmitted with the correct fee(s).” Id. § 103.2(a)(7)(ii)(A)–(D). \n5 \n44.  If USCIS rejects an application for any of these four reasons, the rejected \n6 \napplication “will not retain a filing date.” Id.; see also Form I-589 Instructions at 9 (indicating the \n7 \n8  one-year period an applicant must wait for employment authorization does not begin until USCIS \n9  accepts a completed application); Form I-918 Instructions at 15 (“A petition or supplement is not \n10 \nconsidered properly filed until accepted by USCIS.”); Form I-914 Instructions at 12 (same).  \n11 \nIII.  The Rejection/Blank Space Policy \n12 \n45.  Application forms for immigration benefits all consist of questions and \n13 \ncorresponding blank fields in which the petitioner or applicant may provide an answer.  \n14 \n46.  In 2019, USCIS began to implement a new rejection or blank spaces policy (or \n15 \n16  series of similar policies, which together are referred to here as a policy) that requires applicants to \n17 \nprovide a written response to each and every field on certain application forms. \n18 \n47.  For at least twenty years prior to this new policy, the agency consistently followed a \n19 \nuniform policy and practice regarding rejections.  \n20 \n48.  Prior to this new policy, USCIS followed the governing regulations and only \n21 \nrejected applications that were mailed or delivered to the correct filing address if (1) a page of the \n22 \n23  application form was missing or, the application was missing (2) a signature or (3) filing fee.   \n24  49.  Prior to this new policy, USCIS followed the governing regulations and did not \n25 \nreject an application simply because the applicant did not provide a response to every single field \n26 \non the application. \n27 \n50.  Prior to this new policy, USCIS followed the governing regulations and, if it \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 10           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 12 of 31\n \n1  determined that additional information was required, USCIS would issue an RFE or NOID.  \n2 \n51.  Prior to this new policy, in most cases, USCIS would adjudicate—without issuing \n3 \nan RFE or NOID—applications that contained blank fields or missing information that was not \n4 \nessential. \n5 \n52.  The new rejection policy was an abrupt departure from USCIS’s past practice. \n6 \n53.  In implementing the new policy, USCIS did not change the published instructions \n7 \n8  to the relevant forms, but simply added, and periodically amended, text to its website.  \n9  54.  The new policy dramatically increased the number of rejections for forms subject to \n10 \nthe new policy.  \n11 \n55.  The new policy has resulted in the rejection of forms that were in compliance with \n12 \nthe form instructions (but not the new policy), forms that were in compliance with the new policy, \n13 \nand forms that may or may not have been in compliance with the new policy, which was so \n14 \nimprecise it could not be consistently applied. \n15 \n16  A.  Form I-589 (Asylum) \n17 \n56.  USCIS implemented its rejection policy first with respect to Form I-589.  \n18 \nIn October 2019, USCIS posted the following “Alert” to its webpage concerning the I-589 form:  \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22  57.  As of the date of this complaint, this specific Alert is no longer posted at the top of \n23 \nUSCIS’s webpage.  \n24 \n58.  Instead, USCIS has buried the following paragraph under a tab providing \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 11           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 13 of 31\n \n1  information for “Where to File” and after listing where an applicant should send the Form I-589: \n2 \n59.  Around the same time the Alert was posted to the USCIS webpage, USCIS created, \n3 \nbut did not provide public notice of, new internal Standard Operating Procedures for the Form I-\n4 \n589 (Form I-589 SOP). The new SOP was dated September 24, 2019. This SOP directed USCIS \n5 \npersonnel charged with screening Form I-589s to reject applications that left certain fields blank. \n6 \nFor example, the Form I-589 SOP directed adjudicators to reject applications that did not supply a \n7 \n8  response to fields requesting the asylum seeker’s middle name, other names used, passport or \n9  travel document number, certain family information, and the asylum seeker’s name written in their \n10 \nnative alphabet, among others.  \n11 \n60.  Subsequently, USCIS began rejecting Form I-589s that left response fields to \n12 \nquestions blank or did not use specific terminology to indicate that a question was inapplicable.  \n13 \n61.  Other than the “Alert” posted to that particular webpage, USCIS did not publicize \n14 \nits new Form I-589 rejection policy and the reversal of its longstanding prior practice and policy. \n15 \n16  62.  As a consequence of the rejection policy, hundreds of asylum seekers received \n17 \nrejection notices. An analysis conducted by the American Immigration Lawyers Association \n18 \n(AILA) of 189 rejected asylum applications received between November 29, 2019 and May 1, \n19 \n2020, revealed that all were rejected for having at least one blank space on the Form I-589. AILA, \n20 \nAILA Policy Brief: USCIS’s “No Blank Space” Policy Leads to Capricious Rejections of Benefits \n21 \nRequests 3 (Oct. 22, 2020) (AILA Policy Brief).2  \n22 \n23  63.  The new rejection policy is inconsistent with the language on the Form I-589 itself. \n24  Form I-589’s use of the language “if any” or “if applicable” after many questions indicates that an \n25 \napplicant should leave a field blank if it does not apply to them. As an example of the specific \n26 \n27   \n2   Found at https://www.aila.org/advo-media/aila-policy-briefs/uscis-no-blank-space. \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 12           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 14 of 31\n \n1  inconsistencies, the phrase “if any” is applied to the field requesting the applicants’ spouse or \n2 \nchildren’s passport or identification number, yet the Form I-589 SOP directs an adjudicator to \n3 \nreject an application if this field is left blank.  \n4 \n64.  USCIS has not applied this new rejection policy in a consistent manner. For \n5 \nexample, USCIS has rejected an application that provides a response to every question simply \n6 \nbecause it did not use USCIS’s preferred terminology of “N/A” rather than “not applicable” or \n7 \n8  “none.” Such arbitrary rejections contravene the Form I-589 instructions, which permit responses \n9  like “none” or “not applicable.” See Form I-589 Instructions at 5; see also AILA Policy Brief at 5. \n10 \nB.  Forms I-918, I-918 Supplement A, I-918, Supplement B (U Visa Status) \n11 \n65.  On December 30, 2019, USCIS expanded the rejection policy to include the Form I-\n12 \n918 and Form I-918, Supplement A. That day, USCIS posted the following “Alert”3 to its \n13 \nwebpage:  \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n66.  USCIS also implemented new Standard Operating Procedures for the Form I-918 \n18 \n19  (Form I-918 SOP) and accompanying supplements on December 13, 2019. The new SOP, which \n20  was not made public, directed USCIS personnel charged with screening the Form I-918 and Form \n21 \nI-918, Supplement A to reject applications that left specified fields blank.  \n22 \n67.  The rejection criteria in the updated Form I-918 SOP were significantly more \n23 \nexpansive than the rejection criteria in prior SOP. The prior version only required submission of \n24 \npages one through ten of Form I-918 and the signature of the applicant (or their parent’s signature \n25 \n \n26 \n3   USCIS subsequently amended the Alert to include information pertaining to the public \n27  charge ground of inadmissibility, which is not at issue in the instant complaint. See USCIS, I-918, \nPetition for U Nonimmigrant Status, https://www.uscis.gov/i-918 (last updated Sept. 3, 2020).   \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 13           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 15 of 31\n \n1  if the applicant was younger than 14). Similarly, the rejection criteria for the Form I-918, \n2 \nSupplement A previously required only the submission of all pages of the form, the correct \n3 \nidentifying information for the principal crime victim applicant and their qualifying family \n4 \nmember, and the applicant’s signature. \n5 \n68.  USCIS further amended the Form I-918 SOP on May 7, 2020, which again was not \n6 \npublished or made public. The amended Form I-918 SOP directs adjudicators to reject Forms I-918 \n7 \n8  (and Forms I-918, Supplement A) that leave specified fields blank, such as middle name.  \n9  69.  On June 30, 2020, USCIS expanded the Alert to include the Form I-918 \n10 \nSupplement B: \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16  Other than these discreet Alert postings, USCIS did not notify the public of the expansion of the \n17 \nrejection policy to the Form I-918 and accompanying supplements.  \n18 \n70.  The Alert conflicts with the published instructions for the Form I-918 (including \n19 \nForm I-918, Supplements A and B). Those published instructions explicitly direct crime victim \n20 \napplicants (completing the application and/or Form I-918, Supplement A) and certifying law \n21 \nenforcement officials (completing Form I-918, Supplement B) to leave certain fields blank either \n22 \n23  when a question does not apply or when the crime victim or certifying law enforcement official \n24  does not know the answer to the question. See, e.g., Form I-918 Instructions at 4, 7; Form I-918 \n25 \nSupplement B Instructions at 2.  \n26 \n71.  Other portions of the Form I-918, Supplement A instructions direct applicants to \n27 \ncomplete fields only when certain conditions apply, causing further confusion for being \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 14           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 16 of 31\n \n1  inconsistent with the Alerts. See, e.g., Form I-918 Instructions at 8.  \n2 \n72.  The rejection rate immediately after the initial implementation of the new policy \n3 \nreached as high as 99.6 percent on January 13, 2020. That day, only one Form I-918 or \n4 \nSupplement A of 234 reviewed was deemed acceptable. The weekly rejection rate remained above \n5 \n50 percent through March 13, 2020, and was still as high as 37.4 percent as of July 2020.  \n6 \n73.  Moreover, USCIS rejected Form I-918 applications that did attempt to comply with \n7 \n8  the blank space policy. The agency also rejected some applications that completed all fields but \n9  answered one or more of the fields with one of the Alert’s suggested responses (e.g., “none”) \n10 \nrather than another of the Alert’s suggested responses (e.g., “N/A”).  \n11 \n74.  In some cases, USCIS also rejected applications that used “N/A” for blank fields. \n12 \n75.  The new rejection policy contradicts the instructions to Form I-918, Form I-918, \n13 \nSupplement A, and Form I-918, Supplement B. \n14 \nC.  Forms I-914 and I-914 Supplement A (T Visas) \n15 \n16  76.  In March 2020, USCIS again expanded the new rejection policy to the Form I-914 \n17  and Form I-914, Supplement A, for T visa applicants, posting the following Alert4 to its webpage:  \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \n26 \n4   USCIS subsequently amended the Alert to include information pertaining to the public \n27  charge ground of inadmissibility, which is not at issue in this case. See USCIS, I-914, Application \nfor T Nonimmigrant Status, https://www.uscis.gov/i-914 (last updated Jun. 30, 2020).   \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 15           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 17 of 31\n \n1  77.  This Alert conflicts with the instructions for the Form I-914, which direct \n2 \ntrafficking victims to leave certain fields blank either when a question does not apply to the \n3 \ntrafficking victim or her family member or when the trafficking victim does not know the answer \n4 \nto the question. See, e.g., Form I-914 Instructions at 3–5.  \n5 \n78.  This Alert also creates confusion because it refers to reducing the need for USCIS \n6 \nto issue RFEs when information is missing. In practice, and pursuant to other language in the \n7 \n8  Alert, USCIS rejects applications with blank spaces rather than issuing RFEs. \n9  D.  Form I-360 (Self-Petitions) \n10 \n79.  Recently, USCIS further expanded the new rejection policy to the Form I-360 used \n11 \nby, inter alia, widows, children who have been neglected, abused or abandoned, and certain \n12 \nvictims of domestic violence with a qualifying relationship.  \n13 \n80.  USCIS did not even include an Alert on the form’s web page. Instead, buried under \n14 \na tab providing information for “Where to File,” and after listing where a petitioner should send \n15 \n16  the Form I-360, the following language now appears: \n17 \n18 \n81.  The website notation implementing the rejection policy directly conflicts with the \n19 \nForm I-360 as well as the form’s instructions.  \n20 \n82.  For example, the Form I-360 explicitly directs petitioners to leave certain responses \n21 \nblank if the question is inapplicable or the answer is “none.” See Form I-360 at 3. Additionally, the \n22 \n23  form as well as its instructions repeatedly place the qualifiers of “if any” or “if applicable” in front \n24  of certain fields, suggesting to the petitioner that responses are not required.  \n25 \nE.  Form I-751 (Petition to Remove Conditions) \n26 \n83.  Similarly, USCIS has also expanded the rejection policy to the Form I-751, which \n27 \nmust be filed by spouses and step-children of U.S. citizens who have been granted conditional \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 16           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 18 of 31\n \n1  resident status. The form provides critical relief for, inter alia, widows and victims of domestic \n2 \nviolence, by waiving the general requirement that the U.S. citizen join in filing the petition for \n3 \nremoval of conditions of residence.  \n4 \n84.  USCIS did not even include an Alert on the form’s web page. Instead, buried under \n5 \na tab providing information for “Where to File,” and after listing where a petitioner should send \n6 \nthe Form I-751, the following language now appears: \n7 \n8 \n \n9 \n85.  The website notation and form instructions regarding the rejection policy conflict \n10 \nwith the Form I-751.  \n11 \n12  IV.  Lack of Adequate Notice, Reasoning, and Required Procedures for the Rejection Policy \n13  86.  The rejection policy contravenes USCIS’s longstanding policy and practice of \n14 \naccepting and either adjudicating forms containing blank answer fields or issuing RFEs and \n15 \nNOIDs if appropriate.   \n16 \n87.  At the time USCIS implemented the rejection policy, it did not provide notice in the \n17 \nFederal Register. The only way that applicants subject to the policy, as well as their attorneys, \n18 \ncould learn of the USCIS policy change was (1) through the “Alerts” posted in different locations \n19 \n20  on the USCIS webpages for each application type or (2) through a rejection. \n21 \n88.  USCIS also did not engage in notice and comment rulemaking prior to \n22 \nimplementing the new rejection policy. \n23 \n89.  Furthermore, the agency failed to provide a reasoned explanation for implementing \n24 \nthe new policy. USCIS did not consider the reliance interests of applicants or their attorneys. \n25 \nMoreover, USCIS did not appear to consider the ability of the many pro se applicants to access, \n26 \n27  understand, and follow the new instructions, which (1) are only available in English and Spanish, \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 17           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 19 of 31\n \n1  and only available on a webpage, (2) contradict the published form instructions, and (3) are \n2 \ninconsistent with the most natural reading of the forms to only require information applicable to \n3 \nthe applicant.  \n4 \n90.  USCIS also failed to consider the less onerous alternatives to the policy the \n5 \ngoverning regulations provide, such as issuing an RFE or NOID. This approach—which is set \n6 \nforth in the regulations and which USCIS has followed for years—preserves the applicant’s filing \n7 \n8  date and avoids the consequences of rejecting the application outright. \n9  91.  The new policy requires adjudicators to reject applications for reasons that are \n10 \nirrelevant to their eligibility. The policy requires rejections even where applications fully disclose \n11 \nthe necessary substantive information regarding eligibility for the immigration benefits. \n12 \nV.  Consequences of Rejection of an Application Under the New Rejection Policy \n13 \n92.  The impact of the rejection policy on applications for immigration benefits has been \n14 \nsignificant and widespread. In many cases, the policy has led to dire consequences for \n15 \n16  exceptionally vulnerable individuals and families. Specifically, the rejection policy has prevented \n17 \napplicants from complying with the rigid statutory timelines governing deadlines and eligibility \n18 \nbased on the age of the applicant or family member. As a result, many applicants have been or will \n19 \nbe unable to secure a humanitarian benefit for themselves or for their families.  \n20 \n93.  Extensive processing delays compound the harm caused by the rejection policy. \n21 \nUSCIS routinely takes weeks to process the applications it receives and to determine whether to \n22 \n23  accept or reject the submission. It often takes USCIS at least a month to inform an applicant that it \n24  has rejected an application. The applicant (or their attorney, if any) must then refile the amended \n25 \napplication, a process which takes additional time and can add additional costs related to \n26 \npreparation, mailing, or legal services fees. Even then, due to inconsistent adjudication, USCIS \n27 \nmay still reject the application under the new policy based on perceived deficiencies that were not \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 18           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 20 of 31\n \n1  identified in the first rejection notice, further delaying the applicant’s ability to obtain status or \n2 \ncontingent benefits such as employment authorization.   \n3 \n94.  In many instances, the date on which USCIS acknowledges receipt of the petition \n4 \ndirectly impacts the substantive rights of the applicant and/or the applicant’s qualifying family \n5 \nmembers.  \n6 \n95.  For example, asylum seekers face serious harm from this policy. By statute, they \n7 \n8  must file their applications for asylum within one year of their arrival to the United States. 8 \n9  U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B). If USCIS rejects an asylum application, the rejection may cause the \n10 \nasylum seeker to miss the one-year deadline, rendering the applicant ineligible for asylum unless \n11 \nthey meet one of the narrow exceptions. Id. § 1158(a)(2)(D). Meanwhile, the applicant could be \n12 \narrested and detained for immigration purposes during this process. Pro se applicants for asylum \n13 \nare likely to be particularly vulnerable to such draconian consequences.  \n14 \n96.  In addition, asylum seekers may include in their applications unmarried children \n15 \n16  who are under 21 years of age on the date USCIS acknowledges the Form I-589 as received. 8 \n17 \nC.F.R. § 208.21(a). However, if USCIS rejects an asylum application and an applicant’s child \n18 \nturns 21, the child would age out and no longer qualify as a derivative when the asylum seeker \n19 \nresubmits the application. \n20 \n97.  The rejection policy also delays asylum seekers’ ability to obtain employment \n21 \nauthorization. Asylum applicants must wait a specified period of time after their application is \n22 \n23  accepted until they can seek employment authorization based on the pending status of the \n24  application. Blank space policy rejections thus significantly delay asylum seekers’ ability to obtain \n25 \nemployment authorization, leaving them with no means to support themselves or their families for \n26 \nmonths.  \n27 \n98.  Similarly, victims of crime and trafficking, including self-petitioners who seek to \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 19           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 21 of 31\n \n1  apply based on domestic violence, are eligible to include certain family members, but that is \n2 \ndependent upon the age of the applicant and the family member at the time of filing.5  \n3 \n99.  Moreover, individuals may lose their ability to obtain a U visa, which is contingent \n4 \non the acceptance of Form I-918 and initial evidence within six months of the date on which a law \n5 \nenforcement official or judge signed Form I-918, Supplement B. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(2)(i). Thus, \n6 \nwhen USCIS rejects Form I-918, the crime victim is unable to simply reapply if the certification \n7 \n8  has expired. Instead, the applicant must obtain a renewed certification. Acquiring a new \n9  certification is always time consuming and may be difficult or impossible as law enforcement \n10 \nofficials may be unable or unwilling to issue a second certification.  \n11 \n100.  Third, because of the statutory limitation on the number of U and T visas which \n12 \nUSCIS can award each year, extremely long waiting lists have developed. Every fiscal year, \n13 \nUSCIS may award only 10,000 U visas to crime victims and 5,000 T visas to human trafficking \n14 \nvictims (as principal applicants). 8 U.S.C. § 1184(p)(2)(A), (o)(2); 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.14(d)(1), \n15 \n16  214.11(j).  \n17 \n101.  For U visas, USCIS has reached the statutory cap every year since 2010, and by the \n18 \nend of the second quarter of 2020, more than 153,000 Form I-918s were pending. As of October \n19 \n2020, USCIS takes more than four and a half years to begin adjudicating Form I-918. For T visas, \n20 \nit takes USCIS anywhere from a year and a half to nearly two and a half years to begin \n21 \n \n22 \n5   Victims who are under 21 years of age on the date Form I-918 or Form I-914 is received \n23  may request a derivative U or T visa for four categories of family members: (i) a spouse, (ii) \nunmarried children under 21 years of age on the date Form I-918 or Form I-914 is received, (iii) \n24  parents, and/or (iv) unmarried siblings under 18 years of age on the date the petition is received. \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(T)(ii)(I), (a)(15)(U)(ii)(I); id. § 1184(o)(4)–(5), (p)(7); 8 C.F.R. \n25 \n§§ 214.14(a)(10),  214.11(k)(1)(ii). In contrast, victims who are 21 years of age or older when \nForm I-918 or Form I-914 is received may only request a derivative U or T visa for two categories \n26 \nof family members: (i) spouse and/or (ii) unmarried children under 21 years of age on the date the \n27  petition is received. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(T)(ii)(II), (a)(15)(U)(ii)(II); id. § 1184(o)(4), \n(p)(7)(A); 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.14(a)(10), 214.11(k)(1)(i). \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 20           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 22 of 31\n \n1  adjudicating Form I-914. These time periods for adjudication have increased as the backlog \n2 \nsteadily grows. Delays caused by USCIS’s rejection of a U or T visa application will \n3 \ndisproportionally extend the individual’s wait due to these backlogs.   \n4 \nINDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS’ ALLEGATIONS \n5 \n102.  Plaintiff Akhilesh R. Vangala (Mr. Vangala) is a noncitizen from India who \n6 \noriginally entered the United States on an F1 visa to attend university. \n7 \n8  103.  While a student, Mr. Vangala was the victim of an armed assault and robbery. Mr. \n9  Vangala helped report the crime to police.  \n10 \n104.  On April 1, 2020, Mr. Vangala submitted his petition for a U visa using Form I-918. \n11 \nAlong with the application, he included Form I-918, Supplement B from the appropriate police \n12 \ndepartment. The Supplement B certified that Mr. Vangala had been the victim of a qualifying \n13 \ncrime and that he had been helpful to detectives investigating the crime. \n14 \n105.  Mr. Vangala’s attorney filled out every field—including the inapplicable ones—on \n15 \n16  the Form I-918. Nevertheless, USCIS rejected the petition because, it claimed, Mr. Vangala did not \n17 \nmark “N/A” in all the required boxes. The notice also stated that Mr. Vangala may be required to \n18 \nfill out Parts 7 and 8—which request information regarding the preparer of the petition—even \n19 \nthough Parts 7 and 8 were completed on the application. \n20 \n106.  USCIS mailed the rejection notice on May 27, 2020—nearly two months after the \n21 \nsubmission—to the wrong address. USCIS then re-mailed the notice, which Mr. Vangala’s \n22 \n23  attorney did not receive until June 29, 2020, three months after the application was first submitted. \n24  107.  Mr. Vangala’s attorney resubmitted the same petition to USCIS on July 1, 2020, \n25 \nand received a receipt notice on August 20, 2020. The receipt notice did not apply the original \n26 \nsubmission date and instead adopted the refiling date. \n27 \n108.  The wrongful rejection of Mr. Vangala’s U visa petition places him many months \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 21           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 23 of 31\n \n1  later in the queue for adjudication of U visas. \n2 \n109.  Plaintiff I.S.A. (Ms. S.A.) is a noncitizen from Guatemala who has lived in the \n3 \nUnited States for more than 15 years.  \n4 \n110.  In 2019, Ms. S.A. survived a violent crime in San Francisco, California and \n5 \nimmediately sought law enforcement assistance. On December 28, 2019, Ms. S.A. submitted a \n6 \npetition for a U visa using Form I-918, and included Supplement A forms for her two minor \n7 \n8  children, J.W.L.S. (J.W.) who was just under 21, and J.A.L.S. (J.A.), who was well under 21.  \n9  111.  At the time Ms. S.A. submitted her petition, USCIS had not yet posted its alert \n10 \nregarding the rejection policy on the webpage for Form I-918. \n11 \n112.  Ms. S.A.’s children J.W. and J.A. entered the United States in 2016 and are \n12 \ncurrently in removal proceedings. They face removal from the United States if either of them \n13 \ncannot obtain lawful status through their mother’s U visa application. As a result, Ms. S.A. faces \n14 \npotentially indefinite separation from her oldest child because USCIS rejected her initial \n15 \n16  application. \n17 \n113.  Ms. S.A.’s U visa petition contained responses to all applicable fields, and only left \n18 \nblank inapplicable fields, such as the fields for “Middle Name” under the “Other Names Used” \n19 \ncategory, and the “Province,” “Postal Code,” “Alien Registration Number,” “U.S. Social Security \n20 \nNumber,” and “USCIS Online Account Number” fields.  \n21 \n114.  USCIS rejected Ms. S.A.’s petition based on the new policy on January 30, 2020. \n22 \n23  By this time, J.W.’s 21st birthday had passed and he had aged out of eligibility if USCIS did not \n24  retain the original filing date. \n25 \n115.  In the rejection notice, USCIS erroneously stated that the petition was incomplete \n26 \nfor leaving several different fields on the application blank. \n27 \n116.  Less than two weeks after USCIS’s rejection notice, Ms. S.A. refiled the forms and \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 22           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 24 of 31\n \n1  supporting materials. She expressly requested that USCIS honor the original receipt date, which \n2 \nwould have been December 30, 2019.  \n3 \n117.  USCIS subsequently issued a receipt notice dated February 18, 2020. Because this \n4 \ndate is after J.W. turned 21 years of age, he will not be eligible for derivative status.  \n5 \n118.  Plaintiff Kenny M. Castaneda Penate (Ms. Castaneda) is a noncitizen who entered \n6 \nthe United States on July 14, 2019, to seek asylum. On July 9, 2020—within one year of entering \n7 \n8  the United States—Ms. Castaneda filed Form I-589 to request asylum (and associated relief).  \n9  119.  Ms.  Castaneda  included  her  two  minor  daughters  as  derivatives  on  the  I-589 \n10 \napplication. \n11 \n120.  Ms. Castaneda’s attorney answered “Not Applicable” to several fields on the asylum \n12 \napplication that were not relevant to Ms. Castaneda’s eligibility for asylum, such as fields related to \n13 \nthe applicant’s spouse, since Ms. Castaneda does not have one.  \n14 \n121.  Ms.  Castaneda’s  attorney  included  Ms.  Castaneda’s  passport  number  in  the \n15 \n16  application, and thus did not list an alternative travel document number, as Ms. Castaneda does not \n17 \nhave one. This was the only space left blank in Ms. Castaneda’ application.  \n18 \n122.  USCIS  rejected  the  application  on  July  14,  2020,  on  the  single  basis  that  the \n19 \napplication did not place “N/A” in the field requesting Ms. Castaneda’s travel document number.  \n20 \n123.  Ms. Castaneda’s attorney refiled the application on August 4, 2020, answering “Not \n21 \nApplicable” to the request for Ms. Castaneda’s travel document number and requesting that the \n22 \n23  application be given a receipt notice reflecting the original receipt date of July 9, 2020.  \n24  124.  USCIS accepted Ms. Castaneda’s subsequent application but noted it received as of \n25 \nAugust 5, 2020, instead of the original receipt date of July 9, 2020.  \n26 \n125.  USCIS’s rejection notice caused Ms. Castaneda to miss the one-year filing deadline \n27 \nfor asylum applicants set forth in 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B). Therefore, Ms. Castaneda and her two \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 23           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 25 of 31\n \n1  minor daughters will be barred from seeking asylum if they do not demonstrate they should be \n2 \ngranted an exception to the one-year filing deadline. \n3 \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n4 \n126.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all others who are similarly \n5 \nsituated pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2). A class action is proper \n6 \nbecause this action involves questions of law and fact common to the class, the class is so \n7 \n8  numerous that joinder of all members is impractical, Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of \n9  the class, Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class, and Defendants \n10 \nhave acted on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or \n11 \ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate with respect to the class as a whole. \n12 \n127.  Plaintiffs seek to represent the following nationwide class:  \n13 \nAll individuals who have filed or will file an application with USCIS that USCIS has \n14 \nrejected or will reject (or has not issued or will not issue a filing receipt for) pursuant \nto the rejection policy.  \n15 \nThe “rejection policy” refers to any and all policies of USCIS implemented in or after \n16 \n2019 to reject (or not issue a filing receipt for) an application because at least one \nresponse field to a question on the application was left blank (other than the signature \n17 \nof the applicant) or otherwise deemed to provide an inappropriate or incomplete \n18  response. \n19  128.  The proposed class meets the numerosity requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \n20 \nProcedure 23(a)(1). The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  While \n21 \nPlaintiffs are not aware of the precise number of potential class members, at a minimum USCIS \n22 \nrejected several thousand humanitarian benefits applications pursuant to its new policy.  \n23 \n129.  The proposed class meets the commonality requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \n24 \nProcedure 23(a)(2). The members of the class are subject to rejection of their applications based on \n25 \n26  the same USCIS policy. The lawsuit raises numerous questions of law common to members of the \n27  proposed class, including whether the government’s action in rejecting these applications is \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 24           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 26 of 31\n \n1  arbitrary and capricious under the APA, whether the policy violated the APA’s rulemaking \n2 \nrequirements and/or the APA’s notice requirements  \n3 \n130.  The proposed class meets the typicality requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \n4 \nProcedure 23(a)(3) because the claims of the representative Plaintiffs are typical of the class. Each \n5 \nof the class members has had an application rejected or will have their application rejected based \n6 \non USCIS’s policy and practice at issue in this case.  \n7 \n8  131.  The proposed class meets the adequacy requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \n9  Procedure 23(a)(4). The representative Plaintiffs seek the same relief as the other members of the \n10 \nclass—namely, an order prohibiting USCIS from rejecting applications under the policy and \n11 \ncompelling USCIS to honor the original filing date of applications rejected pursuant to the policy. \n12 \n132.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the proposed class \n13 \nmembers because they seek relief on behalf of the class as a whole and have no interest \n14 \nantagonistic to other class members.  \n15 \n16  133.  Plaintiffs are also represented by competent counsel with extensive experience in \n17 \ncomplex class actions and immigration law.  \n18 \n134.  The proposed class also satisfies Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). \n19 \nDefendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the proposed class, thereby making \n20 \nappropriate final declaratory and injunctive relief.  \n21 \n \n22 \n23  CAUSES OF ACTION \n \n24  COUNT I \nViolation of the APA \n25 \n(Arbitrary & Capricious Agency Action - Failure to Provide a Reasoned Explanation) \n \n26 \n135.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth \n27 \nherein. \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 25           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 27 of 31\n \n1  136.  Prior to late-2019, Defendants had a policy and practice of accepting and processing \n2 \napplications in accordance with governing regulations set forth in 8 C.F.R.  \n3 \n§ 103.2(a)(7)(ii), (b)(8). \n4 \n137.  Defendants abruptly changed this policy in 2019 without providing an explanation \n5 \nfor the departure from their past policy and practice.  \n6 \n138.  Defendants’ policy violates 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because: (a) it created an abrupt \n7 \n8  departure from past policy and practice without providing a reasonable justification for that shift; \n9  (b) is unnecessary given existing regulations; (c) conflicts with existing regulations; (d) failed to \n10 \nprovide adequate notice to the relevant stakeholders; (e) failed to consider the reliance interests of \n11 \nall applicants and the ultimate impact it would have on them, and (f) failed to consider less onerous \n12 \nor consequential remedies for those whose applications are rejected. \n13 \nCOUNT II \n14 \nViolation of the APA \n(Arbitrary & Capricious Agency Action – Ambiguous Policy Creating  \n15 \nInconsistent Agency Practice) \n16   \n139.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth \n17 \nherein. \n18 \n19  140.  Prior to late-2019, Defendants had a policy and practice of accepting and processing \n20  applications in accordance with governing regulations set forth in 8 C.F.R. §§ 103.2(a)(7)(ii), \n21 \n103.2(b)(8). \n22 \n141.  Defendants abruptly changed this policy in 2019. Defendants’ new policy has \n23 \nresulted in inconsistent, arbitrary, and capricious rejections. Such rejections include, but are not \n24 \nlimited to, the rejection of Plaintiffs’ applications, rejections of complete applications, rejections of \n25 \napplications with blank spaces for fields that do not apply, rejections of complete applications that \n26 \n27  include answers such as “none” instead of “n/a,” rejections where applicants write “none” as a \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 26           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 28 of 31\n \n1  response for their middle name, rejections erroneously claiming that an applicant did not follow \n2 \nthe policy, and rejections that conflict with the specific instructions for the form indicating that a \n3 \nresponse is optional.  \n4 \n142.  In addition, because the policy is confusing and internally inconsistent, the policy \n5 \ninvites inconsistency from USCIS employees responsible for processing the applications. \n6 \n143.  Under the APA, an agency must apply consistent adjudication standards to each \n7 \n8  application or case before it.  \n9  144.  Defendants’ wildly divergent adjudications under the rejection policy are so \n10 \ninconsistent and unpredictable that they render the policy arbitrary and capricious.  \n11 \n145.  These same actions demonstrate that the agency has acted in bad faith, issuing the \n12 \nnew policy not for any valid reason, but instead as a means to arbitrarily reject applications. \n13 \n146.  As a result, the rejection policy is arbitrary and capricious and violates the APA. \n14 \nCOUNT III \n15 \nViolation of the APA \n16  (Notice and Comment Rulemaking) \n \n17 \n147.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth \n18 \nherein. \n19 \n148.  Defendants’ new policy represents a dramatic departure from past practice that \n20 \nimpacts the substantive rights of applicants. \n21 \n22  149.  This new policy imposes new obligations on applicants for immigration benefits \n23 \nand results in grave consequences for applicants whose applications are rejected. \n24 \n150.  Under the APA, new agency rules—regardless of whether they reverse a prior \n25 \npolicy—must go through notice and comment rulemaking. See 5 U.S.C. § 553. \n26 \n151.  The rejection policy is a legislative rule that required notice and comment \n27 \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 27           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 29 of 31\n \n1  rulemaking.  \n2 \n152.  No other exception to notice and comment rulemaking applies to this policy. \n3 \n153.  Defendants implemented the rejection policy without notice-and-comment \n4 \nrulemaking, in violation of the APA. \n5 \nCOUNT IV \n6 \nViolation of the APA \n(Notice Requirement) \n7 \n \n8  154.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth \n9  herein. \n10 \n155.  Even if the rejection policy did not require notice and comment rulemaking, the \n11 \npolicy is either a “rule[] of procedure,” “substantive rule of general applicability,” “statement of \n12 \ngeneral policy,” or “interpretation[] of general applicability” that requires publication in the \n13 \nFederal Register. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(1).  \n14 \n156.  As relevant here, the Federal Register notice requirement serves the important \n15 \n16  purpose of apprising applicants subject to an agency’s policy or procedural rules of how an agency \n17 \nwill treat an application. \n18 \n157.  Defendants failed to provide notice of the rejection policy in the Federal Register. \n19 \n158.  This failure has harmed Plaintiffs and class members in significant ways. Because \n20 \nDefendants did not explain or inform the public about the policy in a meaningful way, Defendants \n21 \nrejected and continue to reject thousands of applications pursuant to the new policy.  \n22 \n23  COUNT V \nViolation of the APA \n24  (Not in Accordance with Law – Violation of Agency Regulations) \n \n25 \n159.   All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth \n26 \nherein. \n27 \n160.  Under the APA, a court may set aside agency action that is “not in accordance with \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 28           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 30 of 31\n \n1  law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Agency regulations are law that bind and govern an agency’s \n2 \nconduct. \n3 \n161.  The rejection policy violates agency regulations that govern the adjudication of \n4 \napplications because those regulations limit the bases on which USCIS may reject an application. \n5 \nSee 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(a)(7)(ii). While USCIS may reject applications that are not “[f]iled in \n6 \ncompliance with the regulations governing the filing of the specific application,” the regulations \n7 \n8  governing most forms do not require an applicant to complete every single field.  \n9  162.  In addition, USCIS’s rejection policy conflicts with the instructions for many of the \n10 \nforms at issue, which were formally published after notice and comment. Under agency \n11 \nregulations, these instructions are “incorporated into the regulations.” 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(a)(1). By \n12 \ndisregarding the instructions, USCIS’s actions are not in accordance with law. \n13 \n14  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n15 \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \n16 \na.  Assume jurisdiction over this matter; \n17 \nb.  Certify a class pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 in accordance with this \n18 \n  Complaint’s allegations; \n19 \nc.  Declare that Defendants’ rejection of immigration benefits applications based on the \n20 \n  rejection policy violates the Administrative Procedure Act; \n21 \n22  d.  Permanently enjoin Defendant USCIS from rejecting any immigration benefits \n23    application based on the rejection policy; \n24 \ne.  Order USCIS to issue or reissue a receipt notice using the date on which the initial \n25 \napplication was filed, not the date that an application was re-filed, for any application that \n26 \nwas or will be rejected (or for which a filing receipt was not issued) because of the \n27 \n28 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR             \n \nINJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 29           \n        \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-08143   Document 1   Filed 11/19/20   Page 31 of 31\n \n1  rejection policy; \n2 \nf.

VANGALA; I.S.A.; and KENNY M.  Case No. 20-cv-08143-HSG \n6  CASTANEDA PENATE, on behalf of themselves and  \n \nall others similarly situated,  \n7 \n  \n \nPlaintiffs, \n8 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n9  v. \n10  U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES \nand U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND \n11  SECURITY,  \n12 \nDefendants. \n13 \n \n14 \n \n15 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n16 \nThis Settlement Agreement is entered into by and between Akhilesh R. Vangala, I.S.A., and \n17 \n18  Kenny M. Castaneda Penate (“Plaintiffs”), and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services \n19  (“USCIS”) and Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) (collectively “Defendants”).  Plaintiffs \n20 \nand Defendants are referred to collectively herein as the “Parties.”  Out of a mutual desire to resolve \n21 \nall of the claims in the above-captioned case (the “Action”) without need for further litigation and \n22 \nwithout admission of any liability, the Parties hereby stipulate and agree as follows: \n23 \nI.  RECITALS \n24 \nWHEREAS: \n25 \n26  1.  On November 19, 2020, Plaintiffs filed this putative class action alleging that USCIS, a \ncomponent of DHS, implemented policies of rejecting immigration benefit requests if any \n27  field on certain multi-page applications was left blank (hereinafter “No Blank Space \n28  1 \n \n   \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08143-HSG   Document 43-1   Filed 07/19/21   Page 2 of 12\n \n1 \nRejection Policy”); and that the process by which USCIS adopted the No Blank Space \n2  Rejection Policy and implemented it violated the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”);   \n \n3 \n2.  Plaintiffs are three noncitizens who each had a benefit request rejected pursuant to the No \nBlank Space Rejection Policy. Plaintiffs brought this action on behalf of themselves and \n4 \nsought to certify a class of all individuals who had submitted benefit requests, or would \n5  submit benefit requests, that had been or would be rejected by USCIS pursuant to the No \nBlank Space Rejection Policy;  \n6 \n \n3.  Although Plaintiffs’ Complaint was filed as a putative class action and Plaintiffs filed a \n7 \nmotion for class certification on November 19, 2020, briefing has not been completed and \nno class has been certified; \n8 \n \n9  4.  Shortly after the lawsuit was filed, the Parties agreed to discuss settlement and, while such \ndiscussions were ongoing, Defendant USCIS agreed to and did halt the No Blank Space \n10 \nRejection Policy on December 22, 2020, and Plaintiffs agreed to postpone filing a motion \nfor preliminary injunctive relief; \n11 \n \n12  5.  Defendants have identified 43,501 submissions of USCIS Form I-589, Application for \nAsylum and for Withholding of Removal, and 17,000 submissions of USCIS Form I-918, \n13  Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status, that may have been rejected pursuant to the No Blank \nSpace Rejection Policy between October 7, 2019, the date the No Blank Space Rejection \n14 \nPolicy was implemented, and December 22, 2020; \n \n15 \n6.  There may be additional benefit requests that were rejected pursuant to the No Blank Space \n16  Rejection Policy during such period, which Defendants have not been able to identify; \n \n17  7.  The Parties wish to resolve the disputes that are the subject of the Action without the \nexpense and drain on resources that may be associated with protracted litigation. \n18 \n \nII.  TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n19 \n20  NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises set forth herein, the receipt  \n21  and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and subject to approval of the Court, the Parties \n22 \nagree as follows: \n23 \nA. Definitions \n24 \nFor purposes of this Settlement Agreement, the following terms shall be defined as: \n25   \n1.  Action: The term “Action” means the lawsuit Vangala, et al. v. USCIS, et al., No. \n26 \n4:20-cv-8143-HSG (N.D. Cal.).  \n \n27 \n28  2 \n \n   \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08143-HSG   Document 43-1   Filed 07/19/21   Page 3 of 12\n \n1 \n2.  Applicant: The term “Applicant” shall encompass applicants, co-applicants, and \n2  petitioners, as well as the derivative beneficiaries, of any benefit request that was \nsubject to the No Blank Space Rejection Policy. \n3 \n \n3.  Benefit Request: The term “Benefit Request” as used herein shall encompass both \n4 \nthe Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal, and Form \n5  I-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status, as well as supporting evidence provided, \nsupplements, or addendums. \n6 \n \n4.  No Blank Space Rejection Policy: The term “No Blank Space Rejection Policy” \n7 \nshall mean USCIS’s policy or policies that required its personnel to reject any Form \nI-589 or Form I-918 application or petition if any response field to a question on \n8 \nsuch benefit request was left blank. Beginning on October 7, 2019, USCIS applied \n9  the No Blank Space Rejection Policy to Form I-589 (Applications for Asylum and \nfor Withholding of Removal), and on December 30, 2019, to Form I-918 (Petition \n10 \nfor U Nonimmigrant Status) and Form I-918, Supplement A (Petition for Qualifying \nFamily Member of U-1 Recipient). \n11 \n   \n12  5.  Effective Date: The term “Effective Date” means the date this Agreement receives \nfinal approval by the Court. \n13   \n6.  Regular Rejection Policy: The term “Regular Rejection Policy” shall mean a \n14 \nUSCIS rejection policy that does not include a No Blank Space Rejection Policy. For \nForm I-918, the Regular Rejection Policy refers to the rejection policy that existed \n15 \nprior to the adoption of the No Blank Space Rejection Policy on December 30, 2019. \n16  For Form I-589, the Regular Rejection Policy refers to the nationwide rejection \npolicy that was first implemented on December 23, 2020, and later refined to \n17  eliminate the No Blank Space Rejection Policy. \n \n18 \n7.  Original Receipt Date: The term “Original Receipt Date” shall mean the date on \nwhich USCIS received a benefit request that was then rejected pursuant to the No \n19 \nBlank Space Rejection Policy. \n20   \nB.  The individuals covered by the Settlement Agreement are: \n21 \n1.  All individuals who submitted one or more of the following with USCIS: \n22 \na.  A Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal; \n23 \n24  b.  A Form I-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status; or \n25  c.  A Form I-918, Supplement A, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 \nRecipient (hereinafter “I-918A”); \n26 \n \n \n27 \n28  3 \n \n   \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08143-HSG   Document 43-1   Filed 07/19/21   Page 4 of 12\n \n1 \nAND \n2 \n2.  For whom USCIS rejected a benefit request described in Section II.B.1.: \n3 \na.  Timing: \n4 \n5  i.  For Form I-589, between October 7, 2019 and December 22, 2020, \n6 \ninclusive; or \n7 \nii.  For Forms I-918 and I-918A, between December 30, 2019 and \n8 \nDecember 22, 2020, inclusive; and \n9 \nb.  The rejection was pursuant to the No Blank Space Rejection Policy.   \n10 \n3.  Additionally, while the No Blank Space Rejection Policy only applied to the forms \n11 \nin Section II.B.1., a.-c., ancillary or accompanying forms may also have been \n12  rejected, such as Form I-918, Supplement B, U Nonimmigrant Status Certification \n(hereinafter “I-918B”), Form I-192, Application for Advance Permission to Enter as \n13  a Nonimmigrant, or Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. Thus, \nresubmission under the terms of the Settlement Agreement includes the \n14 \naccompanying forms that generally are required to be submitted with the benefit \nrequest as provided in the form instructions or applicable regulations.  \n15 \n4.  Furthermore, Applicants described in Section II.B.1. a.-c. who had Benefit Requests \n16  rejected after December 22, 2020, based on the rescinded No Blank Space Rejection \nPolicy also are entitled to the benefits of this Settlement Agreement. \n17   \n18 \nC. Rescission of the No Blank Space Rejection Policy:  \n19 \n1.  USCIS has rescinded, as of December 23, 2020, the No Blank Space Rejection \n20  Policy and practices related to it, and all guidance or standard operating \nprocedures relating to the No Blank Space Rejection Policy that expanded the \n21  rejection criteria beyond the Regular Rejection Policy, for Forms I-589, I-918, \nand I-918A. \n22 \n \n2.  Beginning December 23, 2020, USCIS discontinued the use of the No Blank \n23 \nSpace Rejection Policy with respect to Forms I-589, I-918, and I-918A.  \n24   \n3.  Beginning on the Effective Date, all Forms I-589, I-918, and I-918A, must be \n25  submitted to USCIS and executed in accordance with 8 C.F.R. §§ 103.2, 208, \nand 214.14, as interpreted and implemented pursuant to the Regular Rejection \n26 \nPolicy and the form instructions. USCIS reserves the right to reject any Form I-\n27 \n28  4 \n \n   \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08143-HSG   Document 43-1   Filed 07/19/21   Page 5 of 12\n \n1 \n589, I-918, and I-918A submission that meets the criteria of the Regular \n2  Rejection Policy.  \n  \n3 \n4.  Consistent with Section II.C.3., USCIS will not apply the No Blank Space \nRejection Policy to additional immigration forms, including, but not limited to: \n4 \n \n5  a.  Form I-914, Application for T Nonimmigrant Status; \n \n6 \nb.  Form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant; \nand \n7 \n \nc.  Form I-751, Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence. \n8 \n \n9  USCIS has removed references on its website to the No Blank Space Rejection \nPolicy criteria and, consistent with Section II.C.3., does not apply the No Blank \n10 \nSpace Rejection Policy to other immigration benefit requests. \n \n11 \nD. Named Plaintiffs: \n12 \n \n13  1.  Within 15 business days of the Effective Date of this Settlement Agreement, USCIS \nwill reissue a receipt notice indicating that the “filing date” or “receipt date” is the \n14  date on which the initial rejected Form I-589, I-918, or I-918A was received by \nUSCIS for each of the named Plaintiffs. \n15 \n \nE.  Rejected forms that have not been resubmitted as of the Effective Date of this \n16 \nSettlement Agreement: \n17   \n1.  USCIS will permit an applicant who is covered by Section II.B. of this Settlement \n18  Agreement and whose Form I-589, I-918, and/or I-918A was rejected due to the No \nBlank Space Rejection Policy, to resubmit that same benefit request within 365 \n19 \ncalendar days, beginning on the Effective Date of this Settlement Agreement. \n \n20 \n2.  The re-submitted complete benefit requests and documents required by this \n21  Settlement Agreement are to be provided to USCIS at the standard filing addresses \nas provided at the Where to File tab on the USCIS filing address websites for Form \n22  I-589 at https://www.uscis.gov/I-589, or Forms I-918 and I-918A at \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/I-918, with “ATTN: VANGALA” in the address block. \n23 \n \n3.  When, within the time period specified in Section II.E.1., an affected applicant \n24 \nresubmits a properly completed Form I-589, I-918, or I-918A that was rejected under \n25  the No Blank Space Rejection Policy or superseding rejection policy consistent with \nSection II C.3. and C.4., USCIS will accept either the form version that was in use at \n26  that time or a subsequent version as approved by the Office of Management and \nBudget (OMB), deem the resubmitted benefit request as submitted properly, and \n27 \nissue a receipt notice dated as of the Original Receipt Date.  \n28  5 \n \n   \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08143-HSG   Document 43-1   Filed 07/19/21   Page 6 of 12\n \n1 \n \n2  4.  Accordingly: \n \n3 \na.  Aged-out applicants:  USCIS will deem any applicant whose resubmitted benefit \nrequest is receipted under Section II.E.3., to have his or her age at filing \n4 \ndetermined by his or her biological age as of the Original Receipt Date, for the \n5  purposes of eligibility for themselves or derivative family members. \n  \n6 \nb.  USCIS will deem a timely submitted Form I-918B submitted with the original \nForm I-918 that was rejected pursuant to the No Blank Space Rejection Policy, \n7 \nto be valid at the time of resubmission except in instances where the certifying \nofficial withdraws the U nonimmigrant status certification. \n8 \n \n9  c.  USCIS will recognize the Original Receipt Date of a rejected Form I-589 (as \nindicated by the date on the reissued receipt notice), as the date of filing for all \n10 \npurposes, including, but not limited to, determinations regarding employment \nauthorization eligibility, the one-year filing deadline for asylum specified under \n11 \nSection 208(a)(2)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \n12  § 1158(a)(2)(B), and any other legal provisions under 8 U.S.C. § 1158 as in \neffect at the time of the original filing. \n13   \nd.  Any filing fees, including those for accompanying requests (such as Forms I-\n14 \n192, Application for Advance Permission to Enter as a Nonimmigrant, or I-765, \nApplication for Employment Authorization), will be the fee that would have \n15 \nbeen required at the time of the Original Receipt Date. \n16   \n5.  Any person seeking to have Section II.E. apply to their benefit request must provide \n17  one of the following:  \n \n18 \nA copy of the notice issued by USCIS identifying their benefit request as having \nbeen rejected pursuant to the No Blank Space Rejection Policy, or other proof of the \n19 \noriginal rejected filing, such as a rejection notice or the page of the original benefit \n20  request with a USCIS stamp; or  \n \n21  A sworn statement of the applicant, their attorney or accredited representative, or \nanother individual familiar with the circumstances of the original filing; or other \n22 \nevidence such as a delivery confirmation receipt. \n \n23 \nF.  Rejected forms that were resubmitted and receipted as of the Effective Date of this \n24  Settlement Agreement: \n \n25  1.  For any applicant who is covered by Section II.B. of this Settlement Agreement and \nwhose Form I-589, I-918, and/or I-918A was rejected pursuant to the No Blank \n26 \nSpace Rejection Policy and who, prior to the Effective Date, resubmitted the benefit \nrequest and received a receipt notice with a date later than the Original Receipt Date, \n27 \n28  6 \n \n   \n\nCase 4:20-cv-08143-HSG   Document 43-1   Filed 07/19/21   Page 7 of 12\n \n1 \nUSCIS will reissue a new receipt notice using the Original Receipt Date once the \n2  applicant has submitted the necessary documentation.
