    "summary": "<p>This is a case about how Connecticut's restrictions on eligibility for mail-in ballot voting during the COVID-19 pandemic threatened voters' constitutional and statutory rights. On July 2, 2020, a complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut by the Connecticut State Conference of NAACP Branches, the League of Women Voters of Connecticut (\"the League\"), and an individual member of the League whose age made her susceptible to serious complications of COVID-19. The plaintiffs sued Connecticut Secretary of State Denise W. Merrill in her official capacity under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs claimed that because Connecticut allowed mail-in voting only in certain narrow circumstances, most voters would be faced with an unconstitutional choice: to risk their health by voting in person during a pandemic, or to forego voting altogether. The plaintiffs noted how the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on Black communities exacerbated the unconstitutionality of limiting absentee voting. Represented by the ACLU, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief that would expand mail-in voting for the 2020 general election. They also sought attorneys' fees and court costs. The case was assigned to Judge Janet Bond Arterton.</p>\r\n<p>Near the end of July, the Connecticut state legislature passed a bill that gave every registered voter the ability to vote by absentee ballot. The plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their complaint on September 25, 2020. The case is closed.</p>",

Connecticut Secretary of State Denise Merrill remarked that in โ[i]n Connecticut, \nno one should be forced to choose between protecting their health and exercising their right to \nvote.โ1 Despite this laudable and constitutionally vital goal and the brutal toll the novel \ncoronavirus, COVID-19, continues to inflict on the State, Connecticut has retained one of the \nmost restrictive mail voting systems in the nation for the November general election. This action \nseeks to remedy the violation of the fundamental right to vote for the many thousands of \nConnecticut citizens who cannot safely vote at the polls and do not meet one of Connecticutโs \nnarrow requirements to vote by mailโand in doing so, seeks to preserve their health and that of \nthe Connecticut public. \n2.  We are months into a deadly pandemic that now has afflicted over 46,000 \n \n1 Ltr. from Conn. Sec. of State Denise Merrill at 1 (May 2), https://authoring.ct.gov/-\n/media/SOTS/ElectionServices/2020-Voting-Plan-FINAL-DRAFT-May-2-715-PM.pdf?la=en.  \n \n\n     \nCase 3:20-cv-00909   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 2 of 42\n \nConnecticut residents and killed over 4,300,2 prompting Governor Ned Lamont to declare a \npublic health emergency and to issue a number of restrictions to promote social distancing \nincluding closing nonessential business and requiring the use of face masks in many public \nplaces. Indeed, this Court has explained in a recent order that due to advice from the U.S. \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (โCDCโ) that โthe best way to prevent illness is to \navoid being exposed to the virus, through, among other means, social distancing,โ and thus has \nsignificantly adapted its own operating procedures.3  \n3.  Yet this summer will not mark of the end of this pandemic in the United States, \nwith cases surging in the majority of the county and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \nDiseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci warning that new cases could soon reach record levels of \n100,000 new cases a day.4 Over 126,000 Americans have already been killed by the \ncoronavirus.5 In fact, Director of the CDC Robert Redfield has announced that 24 million \nAmericans have likely already been infected by COVID-19โa figure ten times higher than the \nnumber of confirmed casesโand that the pandemic is still in its early stages, with much greater \npotential for causing harm than has been seen thus far. 6 The current crisis only recently reached \nits first โpeakโ in Connecticut, but it will still pose a grave public health risk in the fallโ\n \n2 COVID-19 Update June 30, 2020, CT.gov (Jun. 30, 2020), https://portal.ct.gov/-\n/media/Coronavirus/CTDPHCOVID19summary6302020.pdf.  \n3 Superseding Genโl Order, In re Ct.

Both experts like Dr. Fauci and reliable \nmodels project that even in places where the current outbreak subsides briefly, infection rates \nwill rebound again by the fall.7 Indeed, new cases are once again on the rise in at least 35 states \nand territories and are only decreasing in four.8 \n4.  Yet despite the importance of maintaining social distancing, and the predicted \nnext wave of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, Connecticut has adapted its mail voting \nrequirements only for the August primary. All registered voters in Connecticut will now be able \nto vote by mail ballot for the August election, but the State has not yet taken similar action to \nprotect public health and individual safety during the November general election, despite the \nhardships the pandemic will certainly pose at that time. This inaction threatens public health \nwhile disenfranchising at minimum tens of thousandsโif not hundreds of thousandsโof \nConnecticut voters who are unable to qualify for one of the narrow exceptions under state law to \nvote by mail and rightfully believe it will be unsafe for them to vote in person. And while the \nSecretary has provided a memorandum of opinion expanding the definition of illness to \nindividuals with preexisting conditions and some other limited categories of Connecticut \nresidents, her interpretation appears to apply only to the August primary.9  \n \n7 See Savannah Behrmann, โConvincedโ: Fauci Says There Will Be Coronavirus in the Fall After Trump Says โIt \nMay Not Come Backโ, USA Today (Apr. 23, 2020), \nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/22/coronavirus-dr-anthony-fauci-says-i-am-convinced-\nsecond-wave/3009131001/;  Dr. Fauci anticipates coronavirus outbreak in the fall, CountOnNews2 (Mar. 31, 2020) \n(โFauci said he anticipates coronavirus will be cyclical and return in the fall because of its degree of \ntransmissibility.โ), https://www.counton2.com/news/national-news/dr-fauci-anticipates-coronavirus-outbreak-in-the-\nfall/. \n8 Coronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count, N.Y. Times (updated July 1, 2020), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-\ncases.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article.  \n9 See Office of the Secretary of State, Memorandum of Opinion (May 6, 2020), https://portal.ct.gov/-\n/media/SOTS/ElectionServices/LEAD_Communications/2020/AB-COVID-Opinion.pdf?la=en (providing that \nvoters with โa pre-existing illnessโ as well as โindividuals who may have been in contact with a COVID-19 infected \n \n3 \n\n     \nCase 3:20-cv-00909   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 4 of 42\n \n5.  Those who are most susceptible to severe illness if they contract COVID-19 \n(including individuals with certain preexisting medical conditions and senior citizens) are not \ncurrently eligible to vote absentee in November unless they are โillโ at the time of their ballot \nrequest. Connecticut voters without preexisting conditions who are nonetheless rightfully \nconcerned about COVID-19 transmission and its consequences are also unable to vote using the \nabsentee process for the November election.  \n6.  These consequences fall especially heavily on Black voters in Connecticutโ\nincluding many of the approximately 10,000 members of Plaintiff Connecticut State Conference \nof the NAACPโwho are being afflicted by COVID-19 at significantly disproportionate rates. \nConnecticutโs history of discrimination against Black residents, as well as continuing \ndiscrimination in areas such as education, employment, and healthcare, interacts with \nConnecticutโs narrow absentee voting requirements to hinder their ability to participate \neffectively in the political process in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. As an astute \njournalist remarked about COVID-19โs disproportionate toll on Black Americans, โwe cannot \nskirt the fact that what is a nuisance for one person is another personโs plague.โ10 \n7.  Therefore, Plaintiffs challenge the requirement setting forth exclusive categories \nof persons who โmay vote by absentee ballotโ in Connecticut (the โExcuse Requirementโ) in the \ncontext of COVID-19 community transmission. See Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง 9-135. A voter who does \nnot qualify under any of the listed categories must vote in-person on Election Day, or not vote at \n \nindividual such as healthcare workers, first responders, individuals who are caring for someone at increased risk, as \nwell as those that feel ill or think they are ill because of the possibility of contact with the COVID-19 virusโ can \nvote absentee due to illness in the August 11, 2020 primary election).  \n10 Michele L. Norris, The โus and themโ pandemic shows America is still impervious to black pain, Wash. Post., May \n21, 2020, https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/21/us-them-pandemic-shows-america-is-still-\nimpervious-black-pain/#click=https://t.co/oTQc47yJMt.  \n4 \n\n     \nCase 3:20-cv-00909   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 5 of 42\n \nall. In continuing to hew to the restrictive categories set out in this statute and failing to allow \nabsentee voting for individuals whoโwhile not ill or symptomatic themselves, risk contracting \nCOVID-19 or transmitting the virus to others through in-person votingโDefendant has forced \nConnecticut voters who seek to vote in the November election to make an untenable decision: to \nrisk the health of themselves and their household members or to give up their right to vote.  \n8.  The Excuse Requirement unreasonably burdens Plaintiffsโ members, Ms. \nFrancesconiโs, and many similarly situated Connecticut votersโ fundamental right to vote \nbecause it does not allow them to practice recommended physical distancing to protect personal \nand community health. Plaintiffs therefore respectfully request that the Court enjoin \nConnecticutโs Excuse Requirement to vote absentee during community transmission of COVID-\n19 and declare this requirement unconstitutional during continuing community transmission, \nincluding for the November general election. \nPARTIES \n9.  Plaintiff Connecticut State Conference of NAACP Branches (โNAACP-CTโ) is a \nnon-profit, non-partisan organization principally headquartered at 2074 Park Street, in Hartford, \nConnecticut that is part of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. \nNAACP-CT has 30 local units in various parts of the state. NAACP-CTโs mission is to secure \nthe political, educational, social, and economic equality of rights in order to eliminate race-based \ndiscrimination and ensure the health and well-being of all persons. The organization envisions a \nsociety in which all individuals have equal rights without discrimination based on race. The \nNAACPโs game plan for eliminating race-based inequality and discrimination in the twenty-first \ncentury focuses on six areas, including Voting Rights and Political Representation. \n10.  NAACP-CT has approximately 10,000 members, most of whom reside in \n5 \n\n     \nCase 3:20-cv-00909   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 6 of 42\n \nConnecticut and many of whom are registered voters in Connecticut. Some of these members \nwish to vote via absentee ballot during the November 2020 election because of the risk of \nCOVID-19 transmission, even though many of them do not qualify under current law. The \nmajority of NAACP-CTโs members are fifty-five years old or older and a significant number are \nolder than age 65, and are thus particularly susceptible to severe infection or death from COVID-\n19. NAACP-CT also has a youth leadership arm. A significant portion of NAACP-CTโs \nmembers have underlying health conditions that put them at heightened risk of hospitalization or \ndeath if they are exposed to COVID-19. \n11.  NAACP-CT regularly expends significant resources on get-out-the-vote efforts \n(including voter registration) and other election-related programming. As part of this effort, \nNAACP-CT regularly shares information about voting rules and procedures with its \nmembership. NAACP-CT anticipates that it will have to divert additional resources from its \nregular get-out-the-vote activities to advocate for suspension of the Excuse Requirement and to \nconduct outreach to its members to ensure they understand whether they are eligible to vote \nabsentee during the November election. Indeed, NAACP-CT leaders have already been fielding \nquestions from their membership about whether and how they will be able to safely vote in \nupcoming elections, in light of COVID-19.  \n12.  NAACP-CT has also devoted significant organizational resources to research, \neducation, and advocacy to minimize the harmful impacts of COVID-19 on its membership and \non racial minorities in Connecticut, generally. For example, the organization has convened a \nโCOVID-19 Urban Strategic Planning Committeeโ composed of over 100 local officials, experts, \nand leaders which regularly meets. \n13.  Plaintiff League of Women Voters of Connecticut (โLWVCTโ or โthe Leagueโ) is \n6 \n\n     \nCase 3:20-cv-00909   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 7 of 42\n \na membership organization dedicated to promoting civic engagement and protecting democracy \nthrough advocacy, voter education, and voter assistance. LWVCT is an affiliate of the League of \nWomen Voters of the United States which was founded in 1920 to enfranchise more than 20 \nmillion voters and the organizationโs mission is to empower voters and defend democracy. As \npart of its mission, LWVCT advocates for the expansion of voting opportunities, including \nthrough vote-by-mail, and provides information directly to members who wish to vote by mail, \nincluding providing links on its website where members can find information about voting by \nmail. LWVCT shares this voter education information during in-person and virtual events.  \n14.  LWVCT has 1536 members across the state and 25 local Leagues. A substantial \nnumber of LWVCT members intend to vote by mail in August and Connecticutโs other \nupcoming elections including November if able. LWVCT membership is broad and diverse and \nincludes many individuals who due to age, disability, and/or other preexisting conditions are at a \nheightened risk of contracting COVID-19. The Leagueโs members who are registered voters will \nnot be able to vote in person due to the COVID-19 public health crisis without risking their \nhealth and safety. This includes members who do not meet the current Excuse Requirement to \nqualify for a mail-in ballot. \n15.  The League has members who are election officials and poll workers or work \ndirectly with poll workers and other election officials who will need to assist voters on Election \nDay regarding any new rules around how to cast a ballot. Without action now, the League will \nface an increased burden to avoid widespread confusion for poll workers and election officials, \nresulting in eligible voters being disenfranchised. A substantial part of the Leagueโs work \nincludes registering voters and generally encouraging voter participation in elections, but its \nwork to educate voters about who may and may not vote by absentee ballot in light of the Excuse \n7 \n\n     \nCase 3:20-cv-00909   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 8 of 42\n \nRequirement has already and will continue to cause the League to divert resources from other \npriority areas including voter registration and participation efforts. Additionally, the League has \ncreated a CT VOTES! Campaign that focuses on voter registration, voter education and efforts to \nencourage citizens to vote in the 2020 general election in November. Many Connecticut citizens \nrely on and trust the nonpartisan election information provided by the League. This campaign \nneeds to be able to distribute to voters accurate information about voting well in advance of the \n2020 general election due to the complexities of absentee votingโwhich will be unfamiliar to \nmany voters. Connecticutโs maintenance of the Excuse Requirement for the November general \nelection will increase the complexity and cost of that campaign, draining additional resources \nfrom other programmatic areas. Additionally, LWVCT anticipates that many voters will be \nconfused about their eligibility to cast an absentee ballot in November if the Excuse Requirement \nis not suspended for the 2020 general election, given that many voters will have voted via \nabsentee ballot in the August 11, 2020 primary election who are not currently eligible to vote \nabsentee for the November 3, 2020 general election.  \n16.  Plaintiff Gloria Francesconi is an 88-year-old registered voter who lives in \nTrumbull, Connecticut. She is also a member of the League. She has voted in person in nearly \nevery election since she turned 21but is now greatly concerned about contracting COVID-19 \nwhile voting in person. Because of her age, she runs a higher risk of serious complications or \ndeath if she contracts COVID-19, and therefore has been practicing social distancing since the \noutbreak began. Because of these significant risks to her health, Ms. Francesconi would like to \nvote by absentee ballot for the November general election but does not meet any of the statutory \ncriteria in the Excuse Requirement for the November election. If the Excuse Requirement is \nenjoined, however, or if the State expands the Excuse Requirement to allow all registered voters \n8 \n\n     \nCase 3:20-cv-00909   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 9 of 42\n \nto vote by absentee ballot during COVID-19 transmission as it did for the August primary, Ms. \nFrancesconi would be able to safely vote by absentee ballot. If the Excuse Requirement is not \nlifted or enjoined, she will be forced to either risk her health to vote in November or not vote at \nall. \n17.  Defendant Denise W. Merrill is the Secretary of State of Connecticut. As \nSecretary of State, she is Connecticutโs Commissioner of Elections and thus its chief election \nofficial, โwith such powers and duties relating to the conduct of elections as are prescribed by \nlaw.โ Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง 9-3(a). As Commissioner, the Secretary has duties to, among others: \nโadvise local election officials in connection with proper methods of conducting electionsโ; \nโprepare regulations and instructions for the conduct of elections, as designated by lawโ; and \nโprescribe, provide and distribute absentee voting forms for use by the municipal clerks.โ Conn. \nGen. Stat. ยง 9-4. During any municipal, state or federal election, primary or recanvass, or any \naudit conducted pursuant to section 9-320f, โthe Secretary of the State may issue an order. . . to \nany registrar of voters or moderator to correct any irregularity or impropriety in the conduct of \nsuch election.โ Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง 9-3(b). \n18.  Unless otherwise provide by law, โthe Secretaryโs regulations, declaratory rulings, \ninstructions and opinions, if in written form, and any order issued under subsection (b) of this \nsection, shall be presumed as correctly interpreting and effectuating the administration of \nelections and primaries under this title.โ Id. Additionally, the โSecretary of the State may make \nany changes in any forms prescribedโ in the absentee voting laws โwhich, in the opinion of said \nsecretary, are necessary to conform to the applicable provisions of federal law.โ Conn. Gen. Stat. \nยง 9-139b. In fact, Secretary Merrill used her authority as Commissioner of Elections for the state \nto advise local election officials that a broad set of voters would be able to use the โillnessโ \n9 \n\n     \nCase 3:20-cv-00909   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 10 of 42\n \nexcuse to vote via absentee ballot during the August 11 primary.11 Secretary Merrill is sued in \nher official capacity.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n19.  This action arises under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution and the Voting Rights Act and is brought under 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 and 1988 and 52 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 10301, 10302(b) and 10501 to seek injunctive and declaratory relief for violations of \nconstitutional rights under color of state law. This Court therefore has subject matter jurisdiction \nunder 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343.  \n20.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant, who is sued in her official \ncapacities as a state official. The violations complained of concern their conduct in such \ncapacities. \n21.  Declaratory relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202. \n22.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b)(1) because Defendant resides in this \njudicial district, and under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b)(2) because a substantial part of the events that \ngave rise to Plaintiffsโ claims occurred there.  \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nI.  Transmission of COVID-19 and Public Health Guidelines \n23.  Our nation faces a public health emergency caused by the exponential spread of \nCOVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. According to \nthe CDC, this coronavirus spreads aggressively and asymptomatic people can spread it.12 All age \n \n11 See Office of Secโy of State, supra n.9. \n12 Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, How COVID-19 Spreads, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html (last updated Jun. 16, 2020). \n \n10 \n\n     \nCase 3:20-cv-00909   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 11 of 42\n \ngroups have contracted the disease.13  \n24.  The United States is the current epicenter of the global COVID-19 pandemic. It \nleads the world in the total number of COVID-19 cases with now over 2.58 million.14 To date, \nover 126,000 Americans have died from COVID-19.15  \n25.  The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 20% of \nthose who are infected by SARS-CoV-2 require hospitalization.16 COVID-19 can severely \ndamage tissues in the lung, kidney, heart, and liver.17 Surges of COVID-19 cases have strained \nhealthcare systems in several regions, causing critical shortages of doctors, nurses, hospital beds, \nmedical equipment, and personal protective equipment (PPE).18 \n26.

People of all ages have contracted COVID-19 and died from it, but the illness \nposes special risks for the elderly and those with certain preexisting medical conditions. As the \nCDC has explained, the risk of getting severely ill from COVID-19 increases as you get older, \nwith 8 out of 10 COVID-19-related deaths in the United States occurring among adults aged 65 \nyears and older.20 COVID-19 also poses greater risks for people with preexisting heart and \nrespiratory conditions, individuals with compromised immune systems, and those with many \nother conditions.21 The CDC has also found that some people with disabilities are at a higher risk \nof infection or severe illness because of their underlying medical conditions.22 \n28.  The effects of the pandemic on everyday life will likely last well through and past \nthe 2020 election cycle.23 Experts have indicated that COVID-19 โas a virus new to humans, will \nface less immunity and thus transmit more readily even outside of the winter season,โ and that \nseason changes are โunlikely to stop transmission.โ24 And as emerging diseases expert Amesh \nAdalja of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security recently stated, โOctober \n \n20 Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, Older Adults, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-\nprecautions/older-adults.html (last updated June 25, 2020). \n21 Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, People of Any Age with Underlying Medical Conditions, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/groups-at-higher-risk.html (last updated \nJune 25, 2020). \n22 Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, People with Disabilities, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-disabilities.html (last updated Apr. 7, 2020); Ctrs. for Disease Control & \nPrevention, CDC Updates, Expands List of People at Risk of Severe COVID-19 Illness (June 25, 2020), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0625-update-expands-covid-19.html.  \n23 See, e.g., League of Women Voters of Virginia v.

Of course, this litigation is not seeking to eliminate in-person voting options, \nwhich are important for voters with accessibility needs due to disability, low-English \nproficiency, or illiteracy, and to those who do not have access to reliable mail service, among \nothers. Plaintiffs are merely seeking that a vote-by-mail option be available to all Connecticut \nvoters.  \n32.  The CDC has issued specific guidelines concerning voting during the COVID-19 \npandemic. Among other things, it notes that states like Connecticut โwith only in-person voting \non a single day are higher risk for COVID-19 spread because there will be larger crowds and \nlonger wait times,โ and that ways to lower risk providing a โa wide variety of voting options,โ \nโlonger voting periods (more days and/or more hours),โ and โany other feasible options for \nreducing the number of voters who congregate indoors in polling locations at the same time.โ38 \nIn other words, by expanding mail voting, states will decrease the risk to voters at polling places. \n33.

Accordingly, more than 800 public health experts have called โon our leaders to \nprepare for a Presidential election by mail, in which ballots are sent to all registered voters, to \nallow them to vote from home and ensure their health and safetyโ in November 2020, because \nโAmericans should never again be asked to choose between performing one of the most \nhallowed obligations and privileges of citizenshipโvoting for our representatives at the local, \nstate and federal levelsโand our health.โ39 \n35.  These are essential recommendations given the relatively minimal risks of voting \nby mail versus voting in person during the pandemic. There is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 \ncan be spread through the mail, and the U.S. Postal Service has further changed their policies to \nโeliminate the requirement that customers sign our Mobile Delivery Devices for deliveryโ and \nnow require the customer โto step back a safe distance or close the screen door/door so that they \nmay leave the item in the mail receptacle or appropriate location by the customer door.โ40 \n36.  In contrast, the risks of interpersonal interaction while voting at a polling place are \nalready evident.

Elections held on April 7 in Wisconsin saw multi-hour waits and lines stretching \nblocks upon blocks in places like Milwaukee and Green Bay, in part, because government \nofficials there were unable to create a viable vote-by-mail process for all voters. Crowded lines at \npolling places are prime locations for person-to-person contagion. And indeed, the Wisconsin \nDepartment of Health Services has directly traced and linked 71 confirmed cases of COVID-19 \nto people who voted in-person voting in the April 7 primary.44 More recently, a team of \neconomists found โa statistically and economically significant association between in-person \nvoting and the spread of COVID-19 two to three weeks after the electionโ in Wisconsin.45 \n38.

A recent Harvard study also confirms the ugly truth that Black Americans and \nLatino Americans between the ages of 24 and 54 are far more likely to die of COVID-19 than \nwhites,  with  COVID-19  mortality  rates  ranging  from  five-to-nine  fold  higher  among  racial \nminorities than whites.66 \n52.  Courtney Cogburn, an associate professor at the Columbia University School of \nSocial Work, noted that โ[t]here are patterns at this intersection of race and socioeconomic status \nthat make it very clear this is just not a story about poverty.โ That is, racial disparities in serious \nillness and death due to COVID-19 are inextricably linked to a long history of and ongoing \npatterns of racial discrimination against Black Americans:   \nA history of systemic racism and inequity in access to health care and economic \nopportunity has made many African Americans far more vulnerable to the virus.  \nBlack adults suffer from higher rates of obesity, diabetes and asthma, which make \nthem more susceptible, and also are more likely to be uninsured.

These trends are now quite apparent in Connecticut. As of June 29, Black \nConnecticut residents tested positive for COVID-19 at well over twice the rate of white \nConnecticut residents.68 And Black Connecticut residents are also dying of COVID-19 at a \nsignificantly higher rate than white Connecticut residents.69  \n54.  As CEO of the Connecticut Convergence Institute Dr. Cato Laurencin explained, \nthis higher infection rate for Black communities is linked to social inequality such as less reliable \nhealth care access, higher rates of chronic illness, employment in jobs requiring more \ninterpersonal interaction, and denser living environments that make social distancing harderโall \nof which โhave a common thread of racism or discrimination.โ70  \n55.  And as the Connecticut Health Foundation has detailed: \nEven before this pandemic, people of color in Connecticut were \nmore likely to live in poor health than their white counterparts and, \nfor black residents, to die younger. . . . These differences are not \naccidental, nor are they the result of biological differences between \npeople of different races. Instead, they reflect differences in the \nopportunities and barriers to being healthyโdifferences that are \nrooted in structural racism and bias.โ71  \n56.

Racial discrimination in Connecticut has also resulted in socioeconomic \ninequalities that disadvantage Black Americans, like higher rates of unemployment, disability, \npoverty, and inadequate health insurance than white people. These factors also make it more \nlikely that Black voters in Connecticut are forced to work outside the home even during the \ncurrent pandemic and are therefore more exposed to COVID-19. \nIV.  Connecticutโs Absentee Voting Process  \nA.  Constitutional and Statutory Framework for Allowing Absentee Voting \n58.  The Connecticut Constitution provides that the โgeneral assembly may provide by \nlaw for voting . . . by qualified voters of the state who are unable to appear at the polling place on \nthe day of election because of absence from the city or town of which they are inhabitants or \nbecause of sickness, or physical disability or because the tenets of their religion forbid secular \n \n72 Uninsured Rates for the Nonelderly by Race/Ethnicity, Kaiser Family Foundation, \nhttps://www.kff.org/uninsured/state-indicator/rate-by-\nraceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&selectedRows=%7B%22wrapups%22:%7B%22united-\nstates%22:%7B%7D%7D,%22states%22:%7B%22connecticut%22:%7B%7D%7D%7D&sortModel=%7B%22colI\nd%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D.  \n73 Adults Who Report Not Having a Personal Doctor/Health Care Provider by Race/Ethnicity, Kaiser Family \nFoundation, https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/percent-of-adults-reporting-not-having-a-personal-doctor-by-\nraceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&selectedRows=%7B%22wrapups%22:%7B%22united-\nstates%22:%7B%7D%7D,%22states%22:%7B%22connecticut%22:%7B%7D%7D%7D&sortModel=%7B%22colI\nd%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D. \n74 Nepaul et al., The Burden of Asthma in Connecticut 2012 Surveillance Report, Conn.

Const. art. VI, ยง 7.  \n59.  The General Assembly has implemented this provision more narrowly in some \nrespects than the Connecticut Constitution allows, providing that eligible voters โmay vote by \nabsentee ballot if he or she is unable to appear at his or her polling place during the hours of voting \nfor any of the following reasons: (1) His or her active service with the armed forces of the United \nStates; (2) his or her absence from the town of his or her voting residence during all of the hours \nof voting; (3) his or her illness; (4) his or her physical disability; (5) the tenets of his or her religion \nforbid secular activity on the day of the primary, election or referendum; or (6) the required \nperformance of his or her duties as a primary, election or referendum official. . . .โ Conn. Gen. \nStat. ยง 9-135. \nB.  Recent Expansion of Absentee Voting for the Primary Election \n60.  On May 6, 2020, Secretary Merrill issued a Memorandum of Opinion using her \nauthority under Connecticut General Statutes ยง9-3 to clarify โthe definition of โIllnessโ for \nAbsentee Balloting at a time when the Governor has declared a public health and civil preparedness \nemergency throughout the State of Connecticut.โ75 This guidance was issued to all of the stateโs \ntown clerks and registrars of voters. In it, Secretary Merrill explained that the โillnessโ excuse for \nvoting absentee would cover a much broader set of voters for the upcoming August primary, in \nlight of the lack of limiting statutory language, the dictionary definition of illness, and the CDCโs \nidentification of numerous underlying medical conditions that put some individuals at higher risk \nfor severe COVID-19 infection as โpre-existing illnesses.โ Secretary Merrillโs interpretation did \nnot universally expand absentee voting to all registered voters but it did allow voters who \n \n75 Office of Secโy of State, Mem. of Op. re: Re: Absentee Balloting Voting During a State of Health Emergency \n(May 6, 2020), https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/SOTS/ElectionServices/LEAD_Communications/2020/AB-COVID-\nOpinion.pdf. \n25 \n\n     \nCase 3:20-cv-00909   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 26 of 42\n \npreviously would not have been able to vote absentee to do so for the August primary (including \nthose with pre-existing illnesses, those who had been in contact with people infected with COVID-\n19, individuals caring for someone at increased risk of contracting COIVD-19, and voters who \nโfeel ill or think they are ill because of the possibility of contact with the COVID-19 virusโ).  \n61.  At the beginning of her opinion, Secretary Merrill wrote that her purpose was to \nensure safe voter participation in the August primary election and was done pursuant to emergency \npowers that currently expire in September. It appears, therefore, that this definition of illness exists \nonly through the State of Emergency and thus for the August primary, but not currently for the \nNovember election. It is unclear whether this guidance would continue based on the declaration of \na new public health and/or civil preparedness emergency. \n62.  On May 20, 2020, Governor Ned Lamont issued Executive Order No. 7QQ, which \nmade a number of temporary revisions to the state absentee balloting procedures in order to allow \nsafe voting in the August 11 primary. Among other reasons for expanding the opportunity to vote \nby mail for that election, Governor Lamont cited to the fact that โabsentee voting offers a proven \nmethod  of  secure  voting  that  reduces  the  risk  of  transmission  of  COVID-19  by  allowing \nindividuals to vote by mail and by reducing the density of in-person voting at polling place.โ76  \n63.  Under Governor Lamontโs May 20 Executive Order, all eligible Connecticut voters \nmay legally vote via absentee ballot for the August 11 primary, โif, at the time he or she applies \nfor or casts an absentee ballot for the August 11, 2020 primary election, there is no federally \napproved and widely available vaccine for prevention of COVID-19.โ In his order, Governor \nLamont also mandated several changes to the typical absentee voting process for the August \n \n76 Protection of Public Health and Safety During COVID-19 Pandemic and Response โ Safe Voting During \nStatewide Primary, Executive Order No. 7QQ (May 20, 2020), https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Office-of-the-\nGovernor/Executive-Orders/Lamont-Executive-Orders/Executive-Order-No-7QQ.pdf.  \n26 \n\n     \nCase 3:20-cv-00909   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 27 of 42\n \nprimary, including: (1) addition of a notice on absentee ballot envelopes explaining who is eligible; \n(2) explicit authorization for Secretary Merrill to make any modifications necessary to accurately \ninform  voters  of  their  absentee  voter  eligibility  under  the  executive  order  (notwithstanding \ncontrary legal provisions, if any); (3) authorization for municipal clerks to use third party vendors \nto mail absentee voting sets for the August 11 primary; and (4) authorization for voters to โmailโ \ntheir ballots via secure drop boxes.     \n64.  The clear import of Governor Lamontโs executive order is that the expansion of \nabsentee voting eligibility applies only to the August 11 primary election and does not extend to \nthe November general election. \nC.  Safeguards in Place to Secure the Absentee Balloting Process \n65.  Potential voters may apply for an absentee ballot by filling out an application and \nmailing it to their municipal clerk. In addition to making absentee ballot applications available \nonline  for  downloading  and  printing,  Secretary  of  State  Merrill  recently  announced  thatโ\nnotwithstanding the restrictive Excuse Requirements currently remaining in effect for the general \nelectionโher office โwill provide an absentee ballot application to all eligible voters for the 2020 \nprimary and general elections.โ77 The application asks the individual for their name, date of birth, \naddress and other contact information, how they wish to receive the ballot (by mail for most \nvoters), the election for which the absentee ballot is requested, and the โexcuseโ for which they \nrequire the ballot. It also requires applicants to sign a declaration under penalty of perjury, and for \nanyone who provided assistance to the individual completing the application to sign a similar \n \n77 Ltr. from Conn. Sec. of State Denise Merrill at 9, May 2, https://authoring.ct.gov/-\n/media/SOTS/ElectionServices/2020-Voting-Plan-FINAL-DRAFT-May-2-715-PM.pdf?la=en. \n \n27 \n\n     \nCase 3:20-cv-00909   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 28 of 42\n \ndeclaration.78  \n66.   Once an application is received, the municipal clerk must โcheck the name of each \nabsentee ballot applicant againstโ the most recent voter registration lists and only send ballots to \nthose who appear on the list. Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง 9-140(c). For individuals who do not appear on \nthe list, the clerk must send them a notification but will not transmit a ballot. Id. \n67.  Connecticut has a number of laws governing the handling of absentee ballot \napplications, including laws that prohibit providing or accepting compensation to distribute or \nassist an individual in completing an absentee ballot. Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง 9-140(j). Another \nprovision mandates that an individual who distributes five or more absentee ballot application \noutside of their immediate family or designees must register with the town clerk, maintain a list of \nindividuals to who they distributed applications, and file that list with the town clerk prior to the \nrelevant election day. Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง 9-140(k). Any person who willfully violates these \nprovisions โshall be guilty of a class D felony.โ Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง 9-359. \n68.  When the clerk reviews the application, verifies it meets the requirements and that \nthe individual is on the voter registration, they mail out to the voter โan absentee ballot, inner and \nouter  envelopes  for  its  return,  instructions  for  its  use,  and  if  applicable,  explanatory  texts \nconcerning ballot questions.โ Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง 9-140(d). \n69.  To properly submit an absentee ballot, the voter must fill out the ballot as instructed, \ninsert it into the inner envelope, and sign the form on the inner envelope โunder the penalties of \nfalse statement in absentee balloting.โ Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง 9-140a. That form requires a voter to \n \n78 Application for Absentee Ballot, https://portal.ct.gov/-\n/media/SOTS/ElectionServices/ElectForms/electforms/aabengpdf.pdf?la=en (The declaration of the absentee ballot \napplicant reads: โI declare, under the penalties of false statement in absentee balloting, that the above statements are \ntrue and correct, and that I am the applicant named above.โ); see also Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง 9-140. \n28 \n\n     \nCase 3:20-cv-00909   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 29 of 42\n \nstate that they are eligible to vote in the jurisdiction and that they โexpect to be unable to appear \nat my polling place during the hours of voting at such primary, election or referendumโ based on \none of the designated excuses in the Excuse Requirement. Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง 9-137. The voter \nthen must insert the inner envelope into the outer envelope. Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง 9-140a. \n70.  The voter may submit the ballot in several ways, including:  \na.  By mail if it is mailed by the voter, โa designee of a person who applies for an \nabsentee ballot because of illness or physical disability,โ or โa member of the \nimmediate family of an applicant who is a student,โ such that is received by the \nmunicipal clerk by the close of the polls.  \nb.  In person by the voter to the clerk by the day before the election, or by a โdesignee \nof an ill or physically disabledโ voter or immediate family member by close of the \npolls on Election Day. \nConn. Gen. Stat. ยง 9-140b. This year, Secretary of State Merrill has also committed to providing \nsecure drop boxes for in-person submission of absentee ballots to avoid person-to-person \ncontact.79  \n71.  In examining the submitted absentee ballots, the clerk must reject ballots where (a) \nthe inner envelope statement is not signed by the voter, or (b) a first-time voter registered by mail \nbut did not submit the appropriate identification. Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. ยง 9-150a(d). \n72.  Connecticut also has a number of criminal penalties directed at improper voting by \nabsentee ballot and otherwise. For example, individuals are subject to criminal penalties if they \nare โnot legally qualified [and] fraudulently vote[]โ in any election, if they are legally qualified \nbut โfraudulently vote[] more than once at the sameโ election, or if they vote โby assuming the \nname of another legally qualified person.โ Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง 9-360. \n73.  Additionally, any individual who โintentionally makes a false written statement in \n \n79 Ltr. from Conn.

Conn. \nGen. Stat. ยง 9-359a. And any โperson who unlawfully opens or fills outโ any voterโs absentee \nballot or otherwise willfully violates any absentee balloting law โshall be guilty of a class D \nfelony.โ Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง 9-359. Class D felonies in Connecticut are punishable by up to 5 years \nof imprisonment and up to $5,000 in associated fines. Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง 53a-35a(8); Conn. Gen. \nStat. ยง 53a-41(4). These penalties are printed on the absentee ballot application form itself.  \nV.  The Challenged Requirements Unduly and Unreasonably Burdens the Voting \nRights of Connecticut Residents.  \n74.  Historically, most voters in Connecticut vote in person, on Election Day.80 For \nmost voters, that means physically appearing at a designated polling place where they risk close \ncontact with other voters and poll workers. This also means repeatedly touching shared \nequipment and material such as voting machines, paper ballots, and writing instruments. At \npresent, public health officials consider all of these activities as risking exposure to and/or \ntransmission of COVID-19. These activities are therefore strongly disfavored and/or proscribed \nby various government orders. \n75.  Meaningful opportunities to vote in person are still necessary for many \nConnecticut voters, including those who lack access to reliable mail service or need the kinds of \naccommodations for some persons with disabilities, and personal assistance for people with \n \n80 See, e.g., U.S. Election Assistance Commโn, Election Administration and Voting Survey 2018 Comprehensive \nReport at 29 (2018) (91,602 absentee ballots of over 1.4 million ballots cast in Connecticut in 2018 midterm \nelections), https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/2018_EAVS_Report.pdf; U.S. Election Assistance \nCommโn, The Election Admin. and Voting Survey 2016 Comprehensive Report at 23 (2016) (129,480 absentee \nballots of over 1.6 million total ballots cast in Connecticut in 2016 general election), \nhttps://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/2016_EAVS_Comprehensive_Report.pdf. \n \n30 \n\n     \nCase 3:20-cv-00909   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 31 of 42\n \nlimited English literacy, that are only available at in-person voting sites. To reduce the possibility \nof virus transmission at needed in-person sites, the CDC instructs that states โoffer alternative \nvoting methods that minimize direct contact and reduce crowd size at polling locations,โ and \nencourage use a โa wide variety of voting optionsโ including โany other feasible options for \nreducing the number of voters who congregate indoors in polling locations at the same time.โ81 \n76.  Unlike the vast majority of other states, Connecticut offers no opportunities for in-\nperson early voting.82 As a result, polling places are more likely to be crowded on Election Day \nin November 2020 because, under current state law, most voters will only have one option for \nhow to vote: in person on Election Day.  \n77.  The lack of early in-person voting options in Connecticut also means that some \nvoters with print disabilities83 who currently fall within the narrow group that may vote absentee \nwill have the choice of either (a) voting privately and independently with accommodations84 at \ntheir polling place on Election Day (but facing heightened risk of viral transmission to do so) or \n(b) voting absentee using a non-secret ballot with the aid of a competent third-party (provided \n \n81 Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, Considerations for Election Polling Locations and Voters, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/election-polling-locations.html \n(last updated June 22, 2020). \n82  See, e.g., Denise Merrill, ICYMI: Denise Merrill: Itโs Time to Allow Voting by Mail, Office of Secโy of State \nDenise W. Merrill (Mar. 31, 2020), https://portal.ct.gov/SOTS/Press-Releases/2020-Press-Releases/ICYMI-Denise-\nMerrill-Its-time-to-allow-voting-by-mail.  \n83 Print disabilities encompass conditions that make it difficult (or impossible) for someone to access standard \nprinted text. The paper ballots provided as part of Connecticutโs absentee voting process are inaccessible to many \nvoters with visual impairments, manual impairments, or significant learning disabilities. Unfortunately, at this time, \nConnecticut has not yet adopted any accessible absentee ballot formats that would allow voters with print disabilities \nto vote privately and independently. \n84 Voters with print disabilities may rely on voting machines that have special features such as touch screens, \nheadphones, or sip-and-puff devices. Using these accessible technologies could result in transmission of the \nCOVID-19 virus from previous users or poll workers. CDC, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): How It \nSpreads, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html (noting that \nwhile the virus spreads most easily from person-to-person, it โmay be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by \ntouching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyesโ) \n(last updated June 16, 2020). \n31 \n\n     \nCase 3:20-cv-00909   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 32 of 42\n \nthat someone is available to assist them at home). Both of these voting options will burden the \nexercise of Connecticut citizens with disabilitiesโ constitutionally protected right to vote. \nEliminating the Excuse Requirement would make voting significantly less risky for people with \nprint disabilities who need to vote in person by reducing the total number of people at the pollsโ\nwhich, in turn, reduces the number of interactions with other voters, the number of people \ntouching the voting equipment, and the overall chance of transmission. \n78.  Even if COVID-19 cases do not resurge in Connecticut to previous levels, \nmembers of vulnerable or โhigh-riskโ populations who would otherwise vote in person on \nElection Day will reasonably opt and/or be required to continue practicing โsocial distancingโ for \nthe foreseeable future. Those who risk grave medical complications from COVID-19 will \nreasonably decide to self-quarantine until a vaccine for the illness is developed or a cure is \nidentified. \n79.  Because Connecticut is an โexcuse requiredโ absentee voting state, eligible voters \nmust fall under one of several enumerated categories of persons who are โqualifiedโ to vote by \nabsentee ballot. Under this statute, even older Connecticut voters and many of those otherwise at \nhigh risk of complications from COVID-19 are unable to request an absentee ballot. Defendant \nMerrillโs own webpage describes the limits on who may vote absentee as โstrict,โ as the list of \nvoters who may vote currently via absentee ballot for the November election include only active \nmembers of the U.S. armed forces and people who cannot vote in-person due to (a) โhis or herโ \nillness, physical disability, or religious beliefs; (b) work as an election official outside of their \n32 \n\n     \nCase 3:20-cv-00909   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 33 of 42\n \nassigned polling place; or (c) absence from town during the entirety of voting hours (6 a.m. \nto 8 p.m.).85  \n80.  As currently construed, the Excuse Requirement severely burdens the \nfundamental right of all eligible voters practicing self-quarantining and social distancing to \nparticipate in elections in Connecticut. In particular, it egregiously burdens the right to vote of \npersons with pre-existing medical conditions who commonly vote in person and are not \nconsidered โphysically disabled,โ by placing them at โhigh-riskโ of exposure to severe illness \nfrom COVID-19 (e.g., by being immunocompromised). Older individuals also already face \nhigher rates of infection and death from COVID-19, further magnifying the burden they face in \nhaving to vote in-person during community transmission and before there is a widely available \nand effective vaccine. \n81.  The Excuse Requirement will therefore likely prevent tens if not hundreds of \nthousands of Connecticut voters who might otherwise vote in scheduled elections from \nparticipating in those contests, as anyone not covered by an enumerated absentee โexcuseโ will \nhave to choose between (1) exposing themselves and others to the risk of illness from COVID-19 \nby voting in person or (2) foregoing their right to vote. \n82.  The Excuse Requirement is also particularly burdensome for Black voters in \nConnecticut. Black voters in Connecticut continue to bear the effects of discrimination in areas \nsuch as education, employment, and health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in \nthe political process. It is precisely because of these patterns that Black Connecticut residents \nface particularly severe health risks from COVID-19 exposure arising from being forced to vote \n \n85 Absentee Voting, Office of the Secโy of State Denise W.

In these circumstances, the Excuse Requirement interacts with \nthese conditions to deny Black Americans in Connecticut an equal opportunity to participate in \nthe political process. \n83.  Moreover, Black voters are disproportionately burdened by long lines at the polls. \nA recent study based on data from millions of smartphone users during the 2016 presidential \nelection found that residents of entirely-Black neighborhoods waited 29% longer to vote and were \n74% more likely to spend more than 30 minutes at their polling place than residents of all-white \nneighborhoods.86 This disproportionate wait-time problem means that the risks of voting in-person \nduring community transmission of COVID-19 will fall more heavily on Black voters.87 \n84.  Make no mistake, though: the Excuse Requirement will result in long lines for \neveryone. These longer lines will make it harder to practice adequate social distancing, and likely \ndecreases in the number of polling places and poll workers will cause even longer lines and \ncompound the health risks voters waiting in them will face. Additionally, the fact that Connecticut \nis one of only a few states without early in-person voting before Election Day means that there \nwill be no opportunities to spread out in-person voting.   \n85.  The Excuse Requirement is plainly unreasonable in the context of COVID-19 \ncommunity transmission, which, by current expert predictions, will still be occurring during the \nabsentee voting period for the November 3, 2020, general election at rates that make in-person \n \n86 M.

The Stateโs refusal to allow \nall Connecticut voters to vote safely from home in response to the pandemic cannot be justified by \nany legitimate state interest. The COVID-19 pandemic poses the same concerns for November that \nled Governor Lamont and Secretary Merrill to make clear that any state interest in a restrictive \ninterpretation of the Excuse Requirement must give way in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.88 \nBy taking steps to permit all Connecticut voters to use mail-in ballots to vote safely from home in \nthe August 11, 2020, primary, Defendant Merrill has made clear that the pandemic necessitates \nsuch changes in Connecticut. \n86.  Because the significant weight of the scientific and epidemiological evidence \nindicates that COVID-19 will pose a threat to the health of Connecticut residents for the remainder \nof 2020, if not longer, it is unreasonable not to waive the Excuse Requirement for the November \nelection as well. Public health officials are โconvincedโ that COVID-19 will continue to threaten \nvotersโ health and safety this fall, both because of the looming second wave of the virus and the \nimprobable availability of a vaccine by November 2020.89 And come November, there will still \nbe no widely available vaccine or the existence of herd immunity such that large numbers of \nindividuals voting in person will be safe.90 \n \n88 See Executive Order No. 7QQ, supra n.76; Office of the Secโy of State, Mem. of Opinion, supra n.75. \n89 Savannah Behrmann, โConvincedโ: Fauci Says There Will Be Coronavirus in the Fall After Trump Says โIt May \nNot Come Backโ, USA Today (Apr. 23, 2020), \nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/22/coronavirus-dr-anthony-fauci-says-i-am-convinced-\nsecond-wave/3009131001/.  \n90 TEGNA, FDA Approves Coronavirus Vaccine Candidate to Begin Phase 2 Trial, WUSA 9 (May 7, 2020), \nhttps://www.wusa9.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/fda-approves-coronavirus-vaccine-candidate-to-begin-\nphase-2-trial/507-7119865c-3ffb-42b0-8066-6df24aae2c5d (โDr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. governmentโs top expert, \nhas cautioned that even if everything goes perfectly, 12 to 18 months to develop a vaccine would set a speed record. \nJanuary will mark a year since the National Institutes of Health began creating its COVID-19 vaccine with \nModerna.โ); Dr. Anthony Fauci & CDC Director Senate Testimony Transcript May 12, Rev (May 12, 2020), \nhttps://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/dr-anthony-fauci-cdc-director-senate-testimony-transcript-may-12.  \n \n35 \n\n     \nCase 3:20-cv-00909   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 36 of 42\n \n87.  Indeed, at least some other states that require an excuse to vote by mail are \nalready taking action for November to widen the scope of mail-voting eligibility to all registered \nvoters. In New Hampshire, for example, the State has interpreted its โphysical disabilityโ \nprovision to โappl[y] equally to voters who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 . . . and \nthose who are self-quarantining as a preventative measureโ for all elections this year.91 \n CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT ONE \nViolation of the Fundamental Right to Vote \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution \n88.  Eligible individuals have a fundamental right to vote under the First and \nFourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. Under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, \na court considering a challenge to a state election law must carefully balance the character and \nmagnitude of the injury to the rights that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate against the justifications \nput forward for the burdens imposed by the rule. See Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 \n(1992); Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 789 (1983). \n89.  In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, Connecticutโs Excuse Requirement and its \nenforcement severely and unreasonably burden the fundamental right to vote of Connecticut \nvoters. These requirements will likely prevent many thousands of eligible voters from voting or \nhaving their votes counted, and severely burden others who nonetheless do vote in-person by \nforcing them to risk their health in order to exercise a fundamental right. These burdens will fall \nparticularly heavily on older voters, Black voters, and voters who are at elevated risk of severe \nillness from COVID-19 but who do not fall within the narrow โillnessโ or โdisabilityโ categories \n \n91 Mem. from the Secโy of State and Attโy General to N.H.

Yet even if the burdens were \nless severe, Defendant and the State lack any interest in maintaining the Excuse Requirement \nthat would outweigh these burdens. \n90.  Therefore, Defendant, acting under color of state law, has and will continue to \ndeprive Plaintiffs of rights secured to them by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitutionโnamely, the fundamental right to voteโand protected by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 by \nenforcing the Excuse Requirement. \nCOUNT TWO \nViolation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act \n52 U.S.C. ยง 10301 \n \n91.  Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act provides in part that โ[n]o voting qualification \nor prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any \nState . . . in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the \nUnited States to vote on account of race or color . . . .โ  52 U.S.C. ยง 10301(a). \n92.  The โessence of a [Section] 2 claim is that a certain electoral law, practice, or \nstructure interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities \nenjoyed by black and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.โ League of Women \nVoters of North Carolina v. North Carolina (โLWVโ), 769 F.3d 224, 238โ39 (4th Cir. 2014) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). โ[A] Section 2 vote-denial claim consists of two \nelements: \nFirst, the challenged standard, practice, or procedure must impose a \ndiscriminatory burden on members of a protected class, meaning that members of \nthe protected class have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to \nparticipate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice. \n \nSecond, that burden must in part be caused by or linked to social and historical \nconditions that have or currently produce discrimination against members of the \nprotected class. \n37 \n\n     \nCase 3:20-cv-00909   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 38 of 42\n \n \nLWV, 769 F.3d at 240 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \n \n93.  The Excuse Requirement, if not enjoined, will materially burden the right to vote, \nand will have an adverse and disparate impact on Black voters in Connecticut. Black voters in \nConnecticut are more likely to work in jobs that expose them to COVID-19, less likely to have \ninsurance or financial resources, and more likely to suffer from severe health complications \nand/or to die from COVID-19 than white voters.  Black voters are therefore significantly more \nburdened by the effects of the Excuse Requirement.  \n94.  The disparate burden resulting from the Excuse Requirement is directly linked to \nsocial and historical conditions. Connecticut has a long history of voting-related discrimination, \nincluding elected officials actively discouraging minority voting by disproportionate purging \nfrom the voter rolls and as reflected in minority districts having the lowest voter turnout, \nโmarkedly racially polarizedโ voting patterns that prevented the election of minority candidates, \nand the inability of an Black individual to win the Democratic Partyโs endorsement, among other \n38 \n\n     \nCase 3:20-cv-00909   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 39 of 42\n \nthings.92 Black voters in Connecticut also bear the effect of historical discrimination in activities \nranging from public education93 to hiring practices94 to residential housing patterns.95  \n95.  Black Connecticut residents continue to suffer from discrimination in areas such \nas education, employment, and health, which hinders their ability to participate effectively in the \npolitical process. According to 2018 data from the American Community Survey compiled by \nthe United States Census Bureau, in Connecticut, 6.8% of Black individuals and only 3.1% of \nnon-Hispanic white people lack health insurance;96 12.8% of Black people and only 5.2% of \nnon-Hispanic white people lack a high school degree and twice as many non-Hispanic white \nConnecticut residents had college degrees as their Black peers;97 18.6% of Black households and \n \n92 These findings are documented in Bridgeport Coal. for Fair Representation v.
