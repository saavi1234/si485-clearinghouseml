    "summary": "<p>This case challenged the Nevada Secretary of State's and County Administrators' plan to conduct an all-mail election for the 2020 primary election in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Three individual residents of Nevada filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada on April 21, 2020.&nbsp; Plaintiffs sued Nevada's Secretary of State and Washoe County's Registrar of Voters under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, claiming violations under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, Article 2, &sect; 1 of the Nevada Constitution, Article I, &sect; 4, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution and Article IV, &sect; 4 of the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiffs were represented by private counsel and True the Vote, Inc. The case was assigned to Chief Judge Miranda M. Du.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs had five key allegations.&nbsp; First, the all-mail election limited the right to vote by diluting Plaintiffs' votes with illegal votes.&nbsp; Second, the all-mail election overruled and replaced the Legislature's chosen manner of election invalidating the Plaintiffs' votes for the representatives who decide the manner of elections.&nbsp; Third, the all-mail election violated the <em>Purcell Principle</em> because it altered election procedures near the date of the election.&nbsp; Fourth, the all-mail election was not consistent with the manner of election prescribed by the Legislature.&nbsp; Fifth, the Secretary of State and County Administrators, through the all-mail election, supplanted the Plaintiffs' elected representatives in exercising powers entrusted entirely to the Legislature.&nbsp; Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent the Secretary of State and County Administrators from implementing the all-mail election, as well as attorney's fees.<strong><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p>On March 24, 2020, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Secretary of State of Nevada, announced a plan to conduct an all-mail election for the June 9, 2020 Nevada primary election.&nbsp; The plan was formulated by the Secretary of State and Nevada's 17 county election officials.&nbsp; Under the plan, all active registered voters would be mailed an absentee ballot for the primary election.&nbsp; Voters who were registered at their current address did not have to take further action to receive an absentee ballot, but individuals who were not registered or needed to update their registration information were required to do so in order to receive an absentee ballot. Qualified voters were not active had to submit an Absent Ballot Request Form to the County Clerk/Registrar of Voters in the county where they were registered to vote in order to receive an absentee ballot. Under the Clark County's implementation of the plan, inactive voters would be sent absentee ballots and field registrars would collect sealed ballots from voters.</p>\r\n<p>On April 21, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction reiterating the allegations in their complaint.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 27, Nevada State Democratic Party, DNC Services Corporation/Democratic National Committee, DCCC, Priorities USA, and John Solomon filed a motion to intervene as defendants.&nbsp; Intervenor-Defendants argued they satisfied the requirements for intervention as a matter of right, and alternatively, the requirements for permissive intervention.&nbsp; On April 28, 2020, the court granted the Intervenor-Defendants motion to intervene, finding that Intervenor-Defendants satisfied the requirements for intervention as a matter of right and permissive intervention.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A hearing on Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction was held on April 29, 2020. On April 30, 2020, the court denied Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction finding the Plaintiffs did not establish a particularized injury to confer standing to assert their claims, as the alleged injury of dilution of votes from election fraud raised by Plaintiffs was an issue raisable by any Nevada voter and Plaintiffs did not show a causal connection between the alleged injury of vote dilution and the all-mail election plan. Additionally, the court found that even if the Plaintiffs established standing, the Plaintiffs failed to establish the merits of each of their claims.&nbsp; However, the court deferred resolving the merits to provide the Secretary of State time to assert Eleventh Amendment immunity, if chosen to do so.</p>\r\n<p>Following this denial, on May 11, 2020, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint for failure to state a claim, arguing that the court, in its April 30, 2020 Order denying Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction, already found Plaintiffs failed to establish the merits of each claim and that the Secretary of State had not subsequently asserted Eleventh Amendment immunity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 13, 2020, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and a second motion for preliminary injunction.&nbsp; The amended complaint added four additional individual voters and Nevada Right to Life as Plaintiffs, added the Registrar of Voters for Clark County as a defendant, and asserted four claims.&nbsp; First, the all-mail election violated the fundamental right to vote by direct disenfranchisement from the sudden surge in mail-in ballots that would bring late, never-arriving, lost, or delayed ballots, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp; Second, the all-mail election violated the fundamental right to vote by vote-dilution disenfranchisement by allowing an influx of illegal votes through the sidestepping of statutory safeguards designed to protect against voting fraud, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp; Third, the all-mail election sought to conduct the Primary election in a manner not authorized by the Nevada Legislature and contrary to the Legislature's chosen manner of elections, in violation of Article I, &sect; 4, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution. Fourth, Clark County's plan to send mail-in ballots to all registered voters and to allow collection of ballots violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiffs' second motion for preliminary injunction reiterated the allegations in their amended complaint.</p>\r\n<p>Subsequently, on May 19, 2020, Intervenor-Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs amended complaint arguing Plaintiffs lacked standing and failed to state a claim.&nbsp; As to the standing point, Intervenor-Defendants argued that the disenfranchisement claim could not be connected to the Defendants' decision to proactively mail ballots to voters, that Plaintiffs claim of injury of dilution of votes from election fraud could be raised by any Nevada voter, and that Plaintiffs' claim under the Elections Clause of the U.S. Constitution does not create a private right of action to enforce state law.&nbsp; As to the failure to state a claim point, Intervenor-Defendants argued that the U.S. Constitution does not provide relief for Plaintiffs claims, and that Plaintiffs claim that Clark County's plan to send mail-in ballots to all voters (inactive and active) and to send county-approved ballot harvesters to collect ballots violated the right to vote and the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was already foreclosed by controlling Ninth Circuit precedent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 21, 2020, the court found that a hearing on Plaintiff's second motion for preliminary injunction was unnecessary and denied Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' first complaint as moot in light of the filing of Plaintiffs' amended complaint.&nbsp; On May 27, 2020, the court denied Plaintiffs' second motion for preliminary injunction, finding that Plaintiffs still lacked standing to their first three claims, as Plaintiffs' claims could be raised by any Nevada voter and Plaintiffs failed to show that mail-in ballots sent to Nevada voters without requests for absentee ballots would result in direct voter disenfranchisement or disenfranchisement through vote dilution.&nbsp; Additionally, the court found Plaintiffs were not entitled to equitable relief, as Plaintiffs unreasonably delayed seeking preliminary injunctive relief through their second motion, as they waited fourteen days after the court's first preliminary injunction order and only twenty-six days before the June Primary to file the amended complaint and the second motion for preliminary injunction, and this delay prejudiced Defendants as mail-in ballots had already been sent to many eligible voters. Finally, the court followed the <em>Purcell principle</em>, refusing to alter the mail-in election plan so close to the June primary.</p>\r\n<p>On July 31, 2020, the court dismissed Plaintiffs' case as moot since Plaintiffs could no longer obtain effective relief as the primary election had already occurred on June 9, 2020.</p>",

SUMMARY \n13  Plaintiff  brought  this  case  to  challenge  Nevadaโs  Secretary  of  State  Barbara \n14  Cegavskeโs (โSecretaryโ) plan, in partnership with Nevadaโs 17 county election officials, to \n15  implement an all-mail-in election for the June 9, 2020 Nevada primary (โPrimaryโ) (โPlanโ). \n16  (See ECF Nos. 1, 64.) The Plan was expressly adopted to protect the public and safeguard \n17  the voting franchise during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (โCOVID-19โ) pandemic. \n18  (See, e.g.,  ECF  No. 57  at  1โ3, 13.)  The Primary  came and  went.  Considering  the \n19  assertions and facts specific to this case, the Court finds that it can no longer exercise its \n20  limited jurisdiction over the case and will accordingly dismiss it as moot. The two pending \n21  motions to dismiss (ECF Nos. 71, 77) are likewise denied as moot. \n22  II.  BACKGROUND \n23  The facts of this case may be found in the Courtโs orders ruling on Plaintiffsโ first \n24  and second motion for preliminary injunction. (ECF No. 57 (โFirst Order); ECF No. 83 \n25  (โSecond Orderโ).) These facts include a detailed recitation of the specific Plaintiffs, \n26  Defendants,  and  Intervenor-Defendants.  (E.g.,  ECF  No.  83  at  2โ3.)  The  Court \n27  incorporates those background facts by reference and do no repeat them here. The Court \n28  will herein note only facts that are instantly relevant. \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 92   Filed 07/31/20   Page 2 of 12\n \n1  On April 21, 2020, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit, contending that Nevada election \n2  officials do not have authority to implement the Plan pursuant to which election officials \n3  would mail ballots to active registered voters without voters first requesting such ballots. \n4  (See ECF No. 1 (โVerified Complaintโ).)  In the Verified Complaint, Plaintiffs asserted a \n5  total of five claims, in gist contending that the largely all-mail primary prescribed by the \n6  Plan circumvents various state statutory safeguards designed to protect against voter \n7  fraud, and that their votes will as a result be diluted by illegal votes. (Id.) They additionally, \n8  inter alia, alleged that the Plan is not the Nevada Legislatureโs chosen manner of election \n9  and therefore in violation of Article I, section 4, clause 1 of the United States Constitution. \n10  (Id.)  Plaintiffs  specifically  requested  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  to  prevent  the \n11  Secretary and county administrators from implementing the Plan and to have the Primary \n12  conducted as the Nevada Legislature otherwise prescribes. (Id. at 12โ13.) \n13    Along with the Verified Complaint, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction \n14  (โFirst PI Motionโ) and, inter alia, sought expedited briefing and a hearing on the First PI \n15  Motion. (ECF Nos. 2, 3,4.) The Court granted expedited briefing and held a hearing on \n16  April 29, 2020. (ECF Nos. 14, 49.) The next day, the Court ultimately denied the First PI \n17  Motion, concluding that Plaintiffs lack standing and are unlikely to succeed on the merits \n18  of their claims. (ECF No. 57.) \n19    Plaintiffs did not expressly move the Court to reconsider its ruling. Nor did Plaintiffs \n20  seek  appellate  reviewโexpedited  or  otherwise.  Instead,  Plaintiffs  amended  their \n21  complaintโadding additional parties. (ECF No. 83 at 2โ3 (noting the new parties including \n22  a plaintiff who would be on ballot as a candidate in Lyon CountyโPlaintiff Gary Gladwill).) \n23  In the amended complaint (โACโ), Plaintiffs assert the following four claims: (1) the \n24  Plan violates the fundamental right to vote by direct disenfranchisement in violation of the \n25  First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution by not abiding by the \n26  Nevada Legislatureโs chosen manner of elections (Count I); (2) the Plan violates the \n27  fundamental right to vote by vote-dilution disenfranchisement in violation of the same by \n28  sidestepping statutory safeguards designed to protect against voting fraud (Count II); (3) \n  2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 92   Filed 07/31/20   Page 3 of 12\n \n1  the Plan violates Article I, Section 4, Clause 1 of the Constitution because the Plan sought \n2  to conduct the election in a manner not authorized by the Nevada Legislature and contrary \n3  to the legislatureโs chosen manner (Count III); and (4) Clark Countyโs plan to send mail-in \n4  ballots to all registered voters and to allow for the collection of ballots (โClark Countyโs \n5  Planโ or โCC Planโ) violates the Fourteenth Amendmentโs Equal Protection Clause (Count \n6  IV).1 (ECF No. 64 at 20โ25.) As to the CC Plan, Plaintiffs particularly highlight Clark \n7  Countyโs plan to: (i) send absent ballots also to inactive registered voters and, as reported, \n8  โallow a bipartisan group of deputized โfield registrarsโ to collect sealed ballots from votersโ; \n9  and (ii) create more vote centers than other Nevada counties.2 (Id. at 2.) The AC also \n10  sought declaratory and injunctive relief. (Id. at 25โ26.) The AC was accompanied by, \n11  among other things, a second motion for preliminary injunction (โSecond PI Motionโ). (ECF \n12  No. 65.) \n13  Defendants and Intervenor-Defendants filed oppositions to the Second PI Motion \n14  and moved to dismiss the AC. (See ECF Nos. 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78.) The Court \n15  denied the Second PI Motion on May 27, 2020. (ECF No. 83.) Plaintiffs thereafter moved \n16  for an extension of time to respond to the motions to dismiss, submitting a response on \n17  July 3, 2020โweeks after the Primary. (ECF Nos. 83, 87.) Defendants and Intervenor-\n18  Defendants replied. (ECF Nos. 88, 89, 90 (joinder).)  \n19  III.  LEGAL STANDARD3 \n20  Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows defendants to seek \n21  dismissal of a claim or action for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Dismissal under Rule \n22 \n \n23 \n1The header of Count IV broadly asserts that the Plan violates the Equal Protection \nClause, but the substance of the allegation is specifically concerned with Clark County \n24 \nand the CC Plan. (See ECF No. 64 at 24โ25.)  \n \n25 \n2In their reply supporting the Second PI Motion, Plaintiffs โexpressly disavow[ed] \n26  any challenge to the provisions of the CC Plan allowing for more polling places in Clark \nCounty.โ (ECF No. 83 at 14 (citing ECF No. 80 at 8โ9).)  \n27   \n3While Defendants and Intervenor-Defendants move for dismissal under Federal \n28  Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) (e.g., ECF No. 71 at 4โ5; ECF Nos. 73, 76 \n \n  3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 92   Filed 07/31/20   Page 4 of 12\n \n1  12(b)(1) is appropriate if the complaint, considered in its entirety, fails to allege facts on its \n2  face that are sufficient to establish subject matter jurisdiction. In re Dynamic Random \n3  Access  Memory  (DRAM)  Antitrust  Litigation,  546  F.3d 981,  984โ85  (9th  Cir.  2008).  \n4  Although the defendant is the moving party in a motion to dismiss brought under Rule \n5  12(b)(1), the plaintiff is the party invoking the court=s jurisdiction.  As a result, the plaintiff \n6  bears the burden of proving that the case is properly in federal court.  McCauley v. Ford \n7  Motor Co., 264 F.3d 952, 957 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance \n8  Corp., 298 U.S. 178, 189 (1936)).   \n9  Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. Owen Equip. & Erection Co. v. \n10  Kroger, 437 U.S. 365, 374 (1978).  AA federal court is presumed to lack jurisdiction in a \n11  particular  case  unless  the  contrary  affirmatively  appears.@  Stock  West,  Inc.  v. \n12  Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, 873 F.2d 1221, 1225 (9th Cir. 1989).  \n13  Thus, federal subject matter jurisdiction must exist at the time an action is commenced. \n14  Mallard Auto. Grp., Ltd. v. United States, 343 F. Supp. 2d 949, 952 (D. Nev. 2004). \n15  The issue of mootness amounts to a facial attack on the AC. AIn a facial attack, the \n16  challenger asserts that the allegations contained in a complaint are insufficient on their \n17  face to invoke federal jurisdiction.โ Safe Air for Everyone v. Myer (โSafe Airโ), 373 F.3d \n18  1035, 1039 (9th Cir. 2004). The court assumes the factual allegations of a complaint to be \n19  true and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. Doe v. Holy See, 557 F.3d \n20  1066, 1073 (9th Cir. 2009).4 \n21  /// \n22  /// \n23  /// \n24  /// \n25   \n(joinders)), the Court provides only the standard for the former here because the Court \n26  concludes that dismissal is warranted on mootness grounds. \n \n27  4โBy contrast, in a factual attack, the challenger disputes the truth of the allegations \nthat, by themselves, would otherwise invoke federal jurisdiction.@ Safe Air, 373 F.3d at \n28  1039. \n \n  4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 92   Filed 07/31/20   Page 5 of 12\n1  IV. DISCUSSION\n2  The Court finds this case is now moot.5 The Court therefore does not consider the\n3  other jurisdictional and merits-based arguments for and against dismissal raised in the \n4  partiesโ briefing.    \n5  Article III, ยง 2 of the U.S. Constitution states that the federal courts may only \n6  adjudicate โCasesโ and โControversiesโ. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, \n7  559 (1992); Deakins v. Monaghan, 484 U.S. 193, 199 (1988). By Article III, federal courts \n8  are denied the power to โto decide questions that cannot affect the rights of litigants in the \n9  case before them.โ North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244, 246 (1971). The jurisdiction of a \n10  federal court is properly invoked only where litigants have suffered or are โthreatened with, \n11  an actual injury traceable to the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial \n12  decision.โ Lewis v. Cont'l Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 477 (1990); North Carolina, 404 U.S. \n13  at 246 (explaining also that courts are not empowered as a matter of jurisdiction to decide \n14  moot questions). That there must be a case or controversy for the exercise of jurisdiction \n15  โsubsists through all stages of federal judicial proceedings, trial and appellate.โ Id. โ[I]t is \n16  not enough that a dispute was very much alive when suit was filed . . . [t]he parties must \n17  continue to have a โpersonal stake in the outcomeโ of the lawsuit.โ Id. at 477โ78 (internal \n18  quotations and citations omitted). \n19  โWhere on the face of the record it appears that the only concrete interest in the \n20  controversy has terminated, reasonable caution is needed to be sure that mooted litigation \n21  is not pressed forward, and unnecessary judicial pronouncements on even constitutional \n22  issues obtained.โ Id. at 480. A case is moot where there remains no present controversy \n23  for which effective relief can be granted. E.g., W. Coast Seafood Processors Ass'n v. Nat. \n24  Res. Def. Council, Inc., 643 F.3d 701, 704 (9th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted); see also \n25  ///\n26  5Because the motions to dismiss were filed before the Primary, Defendants and \nIntervenor-Defendants did not have an opportunity to raise the mootness issue. Plaintiffs \n27  raised  the  issue  in  their  response.  (ECF  No.  87  at  3.)  Defendants  and  Intervenor-\nDefendants addressed the issue in reply. (ECF No. 88 at 2, n.1; ECF No. 89 at 2โ6.) In \n28  any event, the Court is bound to consider the issue sua sponte. See, e.g., Gator.com Corp. \nv. L.L. Bean, Inc., 398 F.3d 1125, 1129 (9th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted).\n5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 92   Filed 07/31/20   Page 6 of 12\n1  Siskiyou Reg'l Educ. Project v. U.S. Forest Serv., 565 F.3d 545 (9th Cir. 2009) (internal \n2  quotation and citations omitted) (โA case becomes moot whenever it loses its character \n3  as a present, live controversy of the kind that must exist if we are to avoid advisory opinions \n4  on abstract propositions of law. The question is not whether the precise relief sought at \n5  the time . . . [the case] was filed is still available. The question is whether there can be any \n6  effective relief.โ) \n7  The Supreme Court has recognized several exceptions to the mootness doctrine, \n8  of which the exception for matters that are capable of repetition while evading review is \n9  immediately relevant.6 See, e.g.,  Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 125 (1973);  Honig v. \n10  Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 318โ20 (1988). Plaintiffs argue that exception here, thereby implicitly \n11  conceding that this case is moot under the default mootness doctrine. (ECF No. 87 at 2โ\n12  8.) However, the Court finds the capable of repetition while evading review exception does \n13  not preserve the Courtโs jurisdiction over this matter. \n14  Under  the  capable  of  repetition  while  evading  review  exception,  โ[a]  case \n15  otherwise moot will still be heard if it presents an issue that is capable of repetition while \n16  evading review.โ Pub. Utilities Comm'n of State of Cal. v. F.E.R.C., 100 F.3d 1451 (9th \n17  Cir. 1996) (citations omitted). โThis exception applies only in exceptional circumstances.โ \n18  GTE California, Inc. v. Federal Communications Comm'n, 39 F.3d 940, 945 (9th Cir. 1994) \n19  (internal quotation and citation omitted). The exception particularly applies only where two \n20  exceptions have been met: โ(1) the challenged action was in its duration too short to be \n21  fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there was a reasonable expectation \n22  that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.โ  Murphy \n23  v. Hunt, 455 U.S. 478, 482 (1982) (quotations and citations omitted) (recognizing the\n24  exception as articulated in Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U.S. 147, 149 (1975) (per curiam)).\n25  โThe โcapable of repetition, yet evading reviewโ doctrine, in the context of election cases,\n26 \n6In  addition  to  the  capable  of  repetition  while  evading  review  exception,  the \n27  Supreme Court has recognized the voluntary cessation and collateral consequences \nexceptions. See, e.g., Pub. Utilities Comm'n of State of Cal. v. F.E.R.C., 100 F.3d 1451, \n28  1459โ61 (9th Cir. 1996). The Court has applied an additional mootness exception in class \naction cases. See, e.g., Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 399โ403 (1975). \n6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 92   Filed 07/31/20   Page 7 of 12\n1  is appropriate when there are โas appliedโ challenges as well as in the more typical case \n2  involving only facial attacks.โ Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 737 n.8 (1974); see also \n3  Lawrence v. Blackwell, 430 F.3d 368, 371 (6th Cir. 2005) (โChallenges to election laws \n4  are one of the quintessential categories of cases which usually fitโ the evading-review \n5  prong โbecause litigation has only a few months before the remedy sought is rendered \n6  impossible by the occurrence of the relevant election.โ) (emphasis added). \n7  Plaintiffs essentially argue that the exception is met based on standards that apply \n8  to candidates and voters in election cases. (See generally ECF No. 87 at 2โ8.) However, \n9  each case Plaintiffs materially rely on is inapposite to this case because all those cases \n10  concerned state statutes or other law that would govern successive elections. See, e.g., \n11  Fed. Election Commโn v. Wisconsin Right To Life, Inc., 551 U.S. 449, 449โ50, (2007) \n12  (concerning Section 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) that \n13  would in the future apply to the same backout period issue then before the Court): Norman \n14  v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, 286โ88 (1992) (considering Illinois statute); Intโl Org. of Masters,\n15  Mates & Pilots v. Brown, 498 U.S. 466, 473 (1991) (concerning ยง 401(c) of the Laborโ\n16  Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA) and noting the section would\n17  likely again present an obstacle to a preconvention mailing by respondent ); Storer, 415\n18  U.S. at 737 n.8 (โ[T]his case is not moot, since the issues properly presented . . . will\n19  persist as the California statutes are applied in future elections.โ); Joyner v. Mofford, 706\n20  F.2d 1523, 1527 (9th Cir. 1983) (considering a State of Arizona constitution provision that\n21  โcould be tested . . . whenever another elected Arizona official stands for federal officeโ);\n22  Libertarian Party of N.M. v. Herrera, 506 F.3d 1303, 1306 n.1 (10th Cir. 2007) (considering\n23  New Mexico statute concerning ballot access); Lawrence, 430 F.3d at 369โ72 (involving\n24  mootness challenge to Ohio election statute that applied to candidates); Majors v. Abell,\n25  317 F.3d 719, 722 (7th Cir. 2003) (concerning Indiana statute).\n26  Here, as noted in the Courtโs First Order denying the First PI Motion, in declaring \n27  the Plan the Secretary expressly stated the Plan applies only to the Primary election. (ECF \n28  No. 57 at 2 (referencing ECF No. 1-1).) There is no assertion in the AC that the Plan \n7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 92   Filed 07/31/20   Page 8 of 12\n1  applies to successive Nevada elections. (See generally ECF No. 64.) Accordingly, the \n2  election cases Plaintiffs rely on are materially distinguishable.  \n3  Moreover, to be exact, neither of the two requirements of the exception have been \n4  met here.  \n5  Plaintiffs contend that the first prongโthe challenged action was in its duration too \n6  short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expirationโhas been met because the \n7  Plan and the CC Plan โwere announced in March and April 2020, the initial complaint was \n8  filed April 21, and the June 9 Primary occurred without the opportunity for full review by \n9  this Court, let alone by an appeals court.โ (ECF No. 87 at 4.) The Court disagrees. On the \n10  record here the opportunity for โfull reviewโ by this Court was satisfied because the Court \n11  adjudicated the First PI Motion, and โfull reviewโ by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals was \n12  missed as a result of Plaintiffsโ own dilatory actions. \n13  Intervenor-Defendants point out (ECF No. 89 at 5) that the Ninth Circuit has \n14  explained that: \n15  a  party  may  not  profit  from  the  โcapable  of  repetition,  yet  evading \nreviewโ exception to mootness, where through his own failure . . . he has \n16  prevented an appellate court from reviewing the trial courtโs decision. The \nexception was designed to apply to situations where the type of injury \n17  involved inherently precludes judicial review, not to situations where the \nfailure of parties to take certain actions has precluded review as a practical \n18  matter. \n19  Matter of Bunker Ltd. P'ship, 820 F.2d 308, 311 (9th Cir. 1987) (citations omitted). Further, \n20  while election cases may usually fit the evading review standard due to their short duration, \n21  the prong is not met based on mere possibility. See Murphy, 455 U.S. at 482. If it was so \n22  satisfied, then virtually any election provision would be reviewable based on no more than \n23  that they are matters of short duration. \n24  In this case there was nothing inherently preclusive of review. In fact, in its Second \n25  Order the Court expressed surprise at the lack of urgency with which Plaintiffs brought the \n26  AC and their Second PI Motion as well as them not pursuing expedited appellate review \n27  ///\n28  ///\n8 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 92   Filed 07/31/20   Page 9 of 12\n1  instead of filing the substantially duplicative AC.7 (See, e.g., ECF No. 83 at 1 (โPlaintiffsโ \n2  decision to bring the AC at this late hour, as opposed to seeking expedited appellate \n3  review of the Courtโs order . . . regarding their original motion for preliminary injunction . . \n4  . , is confounding and contrary to their position that a quick disposition of this matter is \n5  needed  due  to  the  impending  June  9,  2020  Nevada  primary  election.โ);  id.  (also \n6  recognizing  that  the  AC  and  second  motion  for  preliminary  injunction  โglaringly \n7  repackage[d]  old  arguments  to  achieve  a  different  disposition  without  necessary \n8  justificationโ); id. at 9 (โPlaintiffs waited 14 days after the [First] PI Order was issued and \n9  only 26 days before the June Primary to file the AC and bring the Second PI Motion . . . \n10  Plaintiffs surely have not acted with the alacrity that they claim this case necessitates.โ).)  \n11  To be sure, this Court was able to consider both motions for preliminary injunction \n12  within short timeframes with expedited full briefing on both and one hearing for the first \n13  injunction request. The Court could haveโand would haveโalso ordered expedited \n14  briefing to rule on the motions to dismiss. But notably Plaintiffs requested an extension of \n15  time way beyond the Primary dateโJuly 3, 2020โto file their response to the motions to \n16  dismiss  (see  ECF  No.  81).  Plaintiffsโ  own apparent  game  of  wait-and-see  therefore \n17  precluded  further  review  on  the merits before  the Primaryโnot  some  intrinsic  short \n18  duration of election cases generally. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not satisfied the first \n19  prong under these circumstances. \n20  Even if Plaintiffs may be found to have established prong one, their failure to meet \n21  prong two prevents them from moving forward. As to the second prong, the Supreme Court \n22  has said โthat there must be a โreasonable expectationโ or a โdemonstrated probabilityโ that \n23  the same controversy will recur involving the same complaining party.โ Murphy, 455 U.S. \n24  at 482. (citation omitted and emphasis added). The Court finds no such reasonable \n25  expectation or demonstrated probability in this case. \n26  ///\n27 \n7Plaintiffs acted contrary to their representation in seeking expedited briefing that \n28  the Court should โissue a ruling with adequate time for [Plaintiffs] to seek emergency stays \nin the Ninth Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court if required.โ (ECF No. 13 at 4.) \n9 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 92   Filed 07/31/20   Page 10 of 12\n1  There is no reason beyond supposition at this time to think the Plan (or the CC \n2  Plan) will be valid and apply to future elections. Again, they expressly governed only the \n3  June Primary. The Court recognizes Plaintiffsโ contention that a similar policy will likely be \n4  implemented for future electionsโand particularly the November general electionโdue to \n5  the persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic (and surmising that some other similar health \n6  and public safety crisis will come along). (ECF No. 87 at 6โ8.) Plaintiffs also argue that \n7  the second prong is met even where Plaintiff-candidate, Gladwill, were to not run in future \n8  elections and that Plaintiffsโ intent to run and vote in the future should nonetheless be \n9  inferred from their past conduct of doing these things. (Id. at 4โ6.) But all this is besides \n10  the point. The Plan (and the CC Plan)โas implemented by the Secretary and county \n11  officialsโwere in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and limited to the Primary. The \n12  relief Plaintiffs request in the AC are directly tied to the same. (See ECF No. 64 at 25 \n13  (stating, for example โenjoin[]the Secretary and County Administrators to administer the \n14  primary election in accordance with the legislatureโs prescribed manner . . .โ and โenjoin[] \n15  the Clark County Administrators from conducting the primary election in accordance with \n16  the  published  [CC]  Planโ).)  Further,  that  the  Plan  (or  CC  Plan)  at  issue  may  be \n17  prospectively implemented is at best speculative and not supported by the allegations \n18  asserted in the AC.8 \n19  ///\n20  8In their response, Plaintiffs argue that if the Secretary in fact has authority to \nimplement the Plan then the Plan controls through to the November general elections \n21  based on the language in NRS ยง 293.247(1). (ECF No. 87 at 8.) The argument is contrary \nto both the Secretaryโs expressed limitation of the Plan to the Primary and the language \n22 \nof ยง 293.247(1). Plaintiffs appear to contort the language of the section to have it say what \nthey want it to sayโthat the Plan permanently controls all elections until replaced by other \n23 \nregulations. (See id.) But the ordinary reading of ยง 293.247(1) does not support this \n24  contention. See NRS ยง 293.247(1) (โPermanent regulations of the Secretary of State that \nregulate the conduct of a primary, general, special or district election and are effective on \n25 \nor before the last business day of February immediately preceding a primary, general, \nspecial or district election govern the conduct of that election.โ). Not only was the Plan not \n26 \nintended to be permanent, it was expressly confined to the Primary. Notably, there is no \nindication on the Secretaryโs website that the November election will be subject to the Plan \n27 \nor  be  an  all-mail-in  election.  See  Nevada  Secretary  of  State, \n28  https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/elections/election-information  (last  visited  July  31,  2020). \n10 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 92   Filed 07/31/20   Page 11 of 12\n1  Moreover, insomuch as substantively similar provisions may govern future Nevada \n2  elections, those provisions and their conceivable forms are not before this Court for \n3  consideration.9 The Court takes caution within its limited jurisdiction to decide only matters \n4  that are presently and properly before it. Even if the State of Nevada were to, for example, \n5  adopt a statutory scheme for state-wide all-mail-in elections in the future, the Court \n6  imagines that the challenges to such a statute would raise materially different contentions \n7  than which Plaintiffs currently raise. To be sure, Plaintiffsโ current contentions chiefly \n8  revolve around the premise that the Secretary and local county officials acted beyond the \n9  scope of election laws prescribed by the stateโs legislature. Such a theory would likely no \n10  longer be valid where, for example, the stateโs legislature itself vote to adopt a statutory \n11  scheme. If such a time comes, then it is additionally conceivable that different issues and \n12  different (or additional) parties and thus a different controversy will be before the Court for \n13  consideration. For all these reasons, the Court additionally concludes the second prong \n14  has not been met. \n15  In sum, on the record before this Court, even if Plaintiffsโ claims stood on firmer \n16  grounds, Plaintiffs can no longer obtain effective relief because the Primary has already \n17  occurred and the claims and relief Plaintiffs requested are precisely tied to the Primary \n18  and the execution of the Plan (and the CC Plan) as specifically implemented by the \n19  Secretary and local officials in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Court therefore \n20  finds this case moot and will dismiss it on this ground. \n21  ///\n22  ///\n23  Further, the section lists the types of election in the disjunctive supposing that discrete \nregulations would apply to each. \n24 \n9The Court has considered Plaintiffsโ contentions that an all-mail-in election has \n25  been recommended or suggested in Clark County for the upcoming November general \nelection and that similar lawsuits are (or may be) in the pipeline. (ECF No. 87 at 7โ8.) But, \n26  as the Court notes infra, there are likely substantive and meaningful distinctions between \nthis  lawsuit  as  currently  framed  and  future  lawsuits.  Any  current  Clark  County \n27  recommendation is not a provision, law, or statute creating a ripe issue for review. Any \nquestion as to how such recommendation affects this case is no more than guess work at \n28  this juncture. Moreover, Clark County specific plans are not tantamount to a statewide \nprovision and would also necessarily fall under the Secretaryโs purview for assessment. \n11 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 92   Filed 07/31/20   Page 12 of 12\n1  V.

The Court has reviewed these arguments and cases and determines \n4  that they do not warrant discussion as they do not affect the outcome of the issues before \n5  the Court. \n6  It is therefore ordered that this case is now dismissed as moot. The Court therefore \n7  does not consider the merits of Plaintiffsโ claims. \n8  It is further ordered that the pending motions to dismiss (ECF Nos. 71, 77) are \n9  thereby moot and denied accordingly.  \n10  The Clerk of the Court is directed to enter judgment in accordance with this order \n11  and close this case. \n12  DATED THIS 31st day of July 2020. \n13 \n14   \nMIRANDA M.

INTRODUCTION \n3  To  diminish  the  spread  of  the  COVID-19  illness,  Secretary  of  State  Barbara \n4  Cegavske  (โSecretary  Cegavskeโ)  and  her  staff  worked  in  partnership  with  Nevadaโs \n5  seventeen local election officials to implement an all-mail primary election for June 9, \n6  2020 (ECF No. 22 at p. 3).  Subsection 4 of NRS 293.213 sets forth the legislative grant of \n7  authority  for  her  do  so  under  the  current  circumstances.  Without  qualification,  this \n8  statutory provision authorizes Nevadaโs state and local election officials to cooperatively \n9  establish โmailing precinctsโ in which registered voters cast their votes by mail.  Despite \n10  Plaintiffsโ arguments to the contrary, Secretary Cegavske was well within her authority, \n11  as lawfully delegated to her by the Nevada Legislature, to approve a statewide all-mail \n  12  primary election.  The motion should be denied.  \n13  II.  STATEMENT OF THE CASE \n14  Plaintiffs have filed suit to halt Nevadaโs all-mail primary election in favor of an in-\n15  person election.   Plaintiffs allege that they are Nevada registered voters who usually \n16  โvote[] early or on election day in-personโ (ECF No. 1 at p. 3, ยถยถ7-9).  Citing Bush v. Gore \n17  as controlling precedent (ECF No. 2 at pp. 9-11, 14, and 18), Plaintiffs speculate that their \n18  votes will be diluted by the votes of persons who cast two or more votes or who fail to meet \n19  voter eligibility standards (ECF No. 2 at pp. 5-6).  According to Plaintiffs, this will likely \n20  occur  because  the  all-mail  primary  circumvents  various  legal  safeguards  designed  to \n21  protect the integrity of elections.  They suggest that the absence of safeguards is akin to \n22  โballot-box stuffingโ or altering ballots (ECF No. 2 at p. 7). Plaintiffs allege causes of \n23  action for:  \n24  Count IโVote Dilution (ECF No. 1 at p. 8);  \n25  Count IIโViolation of the Right to Vote for Legislative Representatives (ECF No. 1 \n26  at p. 9); Count IIIโViolation of the Right to Vote under the Purcell Principle (ECF \n27  No. 1 at p. 10);    \n28 \n-2- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 28   Filed 04/27/20   Page 3 of 15\n \n1  Count IVโViolation of the Right to Vote in the Manner Chosen by the Nevada \n2  Legislature (ECF No. 1 at p. 11); and  \n3  Count VโViolation of the Right to a Republican Form of Government (ECF No. 1 \n4  at p. 12). \n5  Certain of the above causes of action are not cognizable under federal law (Counts \n6  II, III  and  V), while  others are  based  upon the  false premise  that  Nevadaโs all-mail \n7  primary election strips Nevada law of election integrity safeguards provided by state law \n8  (Counts I, IV, and V).  Additionally, because the alleged injury of vote dilution is based \n9  upon conjecture and speculation (Counts I-V), Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they \n10  have  standing  to  challenge  Nevadaโs  all-mail  election.  Finally,  insofar  as  they  have \n11  manufactured abstract disputes concerning the manner of conducting elections (Count \n  12  IV), and the required structure of elections (Count V), Plaintiffs do not have standing to \n13  seek declaratory or equitable relief under Articles I and IV of the U.S. Constitution.1.      \n14  III.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n15  To obtain a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that (1) they are \n16  likely to succeed on the merits, (2) they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the \n17  absence of preliminary relief, (3) the balance of equities tips in their favor, and (4) an \n18  injunction is in the public interest. Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, \n19  20, 129 S. Ct. 365, 172 L.Ed.2d 249 (2008).  This traditional test applies absent Plaintiffsโ \n20  ability to demonstrate that the balance of equities tips sharply in their favor.  Fox Broad. \n21  Co. v. Dish Network L.L.C., 747 F.3d 1060, 1066 n.2 (9th Cir. 2014).  Plaintiffs cannot \n22  meet this burden because they are unlikely to succeed on the merits, having generally \n23  non-cognizable claims.  Further, Plaintiffs will not suffer any harm, much less irreparable \n24  harm, unless one of their preferred candidates loses his or her primary race as a result of \n                                                 \n25 \n1  Plaintiffs have framed their arguments in a way to suggest that they have no \nintention of demonstrating their standing to bring claims for alleged violations of Articles \n26 \nI and IV of the U.S. Constitution.  Federal law is clear that they do indeed have an \n27  obligation to prove standing in the form of a concrete injury (even when they allege \nviolations  of  bedrock  principles  of  constitutional  governance).  See  Arizona  State \n28 \nLegislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, __U.S.__, 135 S.Ct. 2652, \n2663-65 (2015).   \n-3- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 28   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 15\n \n1  election fraud.  At this point, any harm to Plaintiffs is entirely speculative. Finally, the \n2  balance  of  equities  and  the  public  interest  during  these  unprecedented  times  weigh \n3  heavily against injunctive relief.   \n4  The motion must be denied.     \n5  IV.  ARGUMENT \n \n6  A.  Plaintiffs are Unlikely to Succeed on the Merits for Multiple Reasons \n \n7  1.  Secretary  Cegavske  is  Entitled  to  Judgment  on  the  Merits \nBecause Plaintiffs Misrepresent Applicable Nevada Law  \n8   \n9  The Secretary of State is the Chief Officer of Elections for the state of Nevada.  \n10  NRS  293.124.    As  such,  Secretary  Cegavske  may  approve  โmailing  precinctsโ  at  the \n11  request  of  Nevadaโs  county  election  officials.  NRS  293.213(4).  When  state  and  local \n  12  elections officials work together in this manner in pursuit of shared objectives, such as a \n13  common desire to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the population ceilings \n14  and other criteria set forth at subsections 1, 2 and 3 of NRS 293.213 are inapplicable. In \n15  other words, according to the plain language of subsection 4, a local election official โmay \n16  establish a mailing precinct โฆ that does not [exceed the stated population ceilings] if the \n17  county clerk obtains prior approval from the Secretary of State.โ   \n18  As a practical matter, this means that state and local election officials may agree to \n19  establish  mailing  precincts  without  regard  to  the  number  of  voters  in  each  of  those \n20  precincts.  The manifest intent of subsection 4 is to address unforeseen circumstances \n21  compromising votersโ ability to access physical polling locations within any given region of \n22  the state. The COVID-19 pandemic has made such access deeply problematic throughout \n23  the entire state.  Consequently, Secretary Cegavskeโs decision to approve a statewide all-\n24  mail primary not only satisfies the plain language of subsection 4, but is wholly consistent \n25  with its intent.  โWhen the Legislature's intent is clear from the plain language, this court \n26  will give effect to such intention and construe the statute's language to effectuate rather \n27  than nullify its manifest purpose.โ  We the People Nevada ex rel. Angle v. Miller, 124 Nev. \n28  874, 192 P.3d 1166, 1171 (2008).  Since all of Plaintiffsโ claims are premised, in one way or \n-4- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 28   Filed 04/27/20   Page 5 of 15\n \n1  another, upon alleged violations of state law, Secretary Cegavske is entitled to judgment \n2  in her favor on the merits.  \n3  To  avoid  an  unfavorable  judgment  against  them,  Plaintiffs  conflate  โmailing \n4  precinctsโ and โabsent ballotsโ in an effort to cast doubt upon the legal validity of the \n5  scheduled all-mail primary (ECF No. 2 at 5-6, 12-13). By definition, an โabsent ballotโ is \n6  โa ballot voted by a person who expects to be or is absent from the polling place for his or \n7  her precinct or district on election day.โ NRS 293.013.  Although a voter need not offer an \n8  excuse for voting absentee, the voter must affirmatively request an absent ballot in order \n9  to cast the ballot by mail. NRS 293.313.  A mailing precinct, by contrast, is a precinct in \n10  which the registered voters are automatically mailed their ballots at their addresses of \n11  record. NRS 293.345.   \n  12  As  Plaintiffs  observe,  the  submission  of  an  absent  ballot  is  governed  by  rules \n13  designed to ensure that a person who casts an absent ballot meets the voter eligibility \n14  criteria stated at Article 2, ยง 1 of the Nevada Constitution, including age and residency \n15  qualifications (ECF No. 2 at pp. 5-6, 12-13).  Accordingly, a person who requests an \n16  absent ballot is subject to the verification process that Plaintiffs describe in their motion \n17  for  injunctive  relief  (ECF  No.  2  at  pp.  5-6.).    Plaintiffs  agree  that  these  verification \n18  processes are designed to reconcile discrepancies between the voterโs address of record \n19  and a new address associated with the voterโs affirmative request for an absent ballot \n20  (ECF No. 2 at 6). Predictably, Plaintiffs fail to acknowledge that there is no need to \n21  reconcile such discrepancies with respect to mailing precincts. This is because there can \n22  be no discrepancies unless the voter affirmatively request an absent ballot in lieu of the \n23  standard ballot that will be mailed, unsolicited, to the voterโs address of record within the \n24  mailing precinct. \n25  In other words, if a voter plans to move to a new address before the standard ballot \n26  issues in the mail, the voter may request that an absent ballot be mailed to the voterโs \n27  new address.  Under these circumstances, if there is a discrepancy between the voterโs \n28  address of record and the new address associated with the voterโs affirmative request for \n-5- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 28   Filed 04/27/20   Page 6 of 15\n \n1  an absent ballot, the voter will be subject to the address reconciliation concerns that \n2  Plaintiffs have expressed in their motion for injunctive relief (ECF No. 2 at pp. 5-6.)  \n3  There is no factual or legal basis for Plaintiffs to claim that voters will have the option to \n4  circumvent applicable election integrity measures.          \n5  Likewise, there is no basis for Plaintiffs to claim that first-time voters will be able \n6  to  circumvent  the  identity  and  residency  verification  processes  that  are  periodically \n7  conducted at physical polling locations (ECF No. 2 at p. 12).  Plaintiffs incorrectly assert \n8  that first-time voters will be able to circumvent the requirements of NRS 293.2725(1) if \n9  they receive their ballots in the mail. As explained in the Declaration of Wayne Thorley \n10  (ECF No. 22 at p. 2), this is untrue because NRS 293.2725(2) sets forth an exception for \n11  first-time voters who submit to automated identity and residency verification as part of \n  12  the initial registration process, or who mail proof of identity and residency along with \n13  their ballots.  In summary, first-time voters must submit to the very same verification \n14  processes that apply to all elections, regardless of whether voting is conducted by mail or \n15  in person.      \n16  As  a  final  matter,  Plaintiffs  falsely  claim  that  state  and  local  election  officials \n17  violated NRS 293.205 and .206 for failure to meet the deadline for changing precinct \n18  boundaries (ECF No. 2 at p. 6).  Since there were no changes to precinct boundaries, this \n19  argument is nonsensical.  The only change was to the method of voting within existing \n20  precinct boundaries. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, voters residing within existing \n21  precinct boundaries will have the option to mail their ballots to the clerk or registrar of \n22  the county where they reside, thus obviating the need for those same voters to appear in \n23  person at physical polling locations within those precinct boundaries.2  With respect to \n24  voters such   as Plaintiffs who prefer to vote in person on election day, they may cast their \n                                                 \n25 \n2   Early  voting  procedures  have  rendered  precinct  boundaries  largely \nirrelevant in Nevada. During the 2-week period for early voting, voters may cast their \n26 \nvotes at any location where a vote center has been established. See NRS 293.356-.361. \n27  Effective January 1, 2020, the same is true on election day. See NRS 293.3072-.3075. \nAccordingly, there is little incentive for incumbent politicians to advocate for last-minute \n28 \nchanges to precinct boundaries in the hope that certain voters will be unable to locate \ntheir precincts on election day.  \n-6- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 28   Filed 04/27/20   Page 7 of 15\n \n1  votes  at  a  countywide  vote  center  regardless  of  any  precinct  to  which  they  may  be \n2  assigned (ECF No. 22 at p. 4). See NRS 293.3072-.3075.  \n \n3  2.  Plaintiffsโ Argument for Discarding the Anderson-Burdick Test  \nis Unpersuasive \n4   \n5    In  their  motion  for  injunctive  relief,  Plaintiffs  discuss  the  Anderson-Burdick \n6  balancing test at length, but ultimately urge the Court to discard it (ECF No. 2 at pp 8-9), \n7  replacing it with principles discussed in Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000) (per curiam), \n8  and Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964).3  Those cases involved illegible ballots and a \n9  convoluted legislative apportionment scheme, respectively. Id.  Plaintiffs claim that the \n10  Anderson-Burdick balancing test is inapplicable because it is not useful for evaluating \n11  vote dilution claims (ECF No. 2 at 9).  As discussed below, however, Plaintiffsโ cause of \n  12  action for vote dilution is premised entirely upon speculation and conjecture.  While it is a \n13  colorful  analogy,  this  case  does  not  allege  facts  that  are  tantamount  to  โballot-box \n14  stuffingโ, nor does it implicate altered or destroyed ballots (ECF No. 2 at 7). \n15   Notwithstanding the hyperbole, Plaintiffsโ motion for injunctive relief ultimately \n16  expresses a disagreement with the policy of replacing in-person voting with mail-in voting \n17  for the 2020 primary election.  Since that policy is based upon Secretary Cegavskeโs \n18  reasonable interpretation of NRS 293.213(4), the only question for this Court is whether \n19  the  policy  unduly  burdens  Plaintiffsโ  voting  rights  relative  to  the  Stateโs  interest  in \n20  protecting  the  health  and  safety  of  its voters.    The  Anderson-Burdick  balancing  test \n21  provides the appropriate standard for evaluating Plaintiffsโ claims.  \n22    According  to  the  Anderson-Burdick  line of cases,  โ[w]hen a  state  election law \n23  provision imposes only โreasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictionsโ upon the First and  \n24  Fourteenth Amendment rights of voters, โthe State's important regulatory interests are \n25  generally sufficient to justifyโ the restrictions.โ Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 \n26  (1992) (quoting Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 788 (1983)); see also Arizona Green \n27                                                   \n3    Plaintiffsโ  reliance on  Bush v.  Gore  is misplaced,  given that  the  per  curiam \n28 \ndecision was limited to the circumstances in that case, involving the 2000 presidential \nelection.  Id. at 109.   \n-7- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 28   Filed 04/27/20   Page 8 of 15\n \n1  Party v. Reagan, 838 F.3d 983, 988 (9th Cir. 2016).  Here, Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate a \n2  burden upon their voting rights, only an imposition upon their preference for in-person \n3  voting.  By contrast, the Stateโs interest in protecting the health and safety of its voters is \n4  compelling.  Particularly during a global pandemic.  When applied to the allegations in \n5  this  case,  the  Anderson-Burdick  balancing  test  weighs  heavily  in  favor  Secretary \n6  Cegavske.  \n7  3.  Plaintiffs Lack Standing for Their Speculative, Novel Claims \n8  Article III, ยง 2 of the U.S. Constitution states that the federal courts may only \n9  adjudicate โCasesโ and โControversiesโ. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, \n10  559 (1992). The case-or-controversy requirement of Article III requires that Plaintiffs \n11  establish their โstandingโ as a jurisdictional prerequisite to the prosecution of this law \n  12  suit.  Clapper v. Amnesty International USA, 586 U.S. 398, 408 (2013).  To establish \n13  standing,  Plaintiffs  must  show  that  their  alleged  injury  is  โactual  or  imminent,  not \n14  conjectural or hypothetical.โ  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (internal quotations and citations \n15  omitted).   Additionally, they must show a โcausal connectionโ between the alleged injury \n16  and the conduct about which they complain.  Id.   As a final matter, Plaintiffs may not \n17  offer mere speculation that a decision in their favor, namely a decision to require in-\n18  person voting at physical polling locations throughout Washoe County, will redress their \n19  alleged injury. Id. at 561.   \n20  Moreover, Plaintiffs must demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief \n21  sought.  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 185 \n22  (2000).  Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to each of their five \n23  causes of action.  However, their claim for vote dilution (Count I) is the only claim that \n24  even hints at the nature of their alleged injury. To establish standing, Plaintiffs must \n25  show that they have suffered an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the challenged \n26  conduct of the defendants and is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision. \n27  Lujan, 504 U.S. at   560โ61 (1992). Injury in fact is โthe โ[f]irst and foremostโ of standing's \n28  three  elements.โ  Spokeo  Inc.  v.  Robins,  136  S.  Ct.  1540,  1547  (2016)  (alteration  in \n-8- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 28   Filed 04/27/20   Page 9 of 15\n \n1  original) (quoting Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83, 103, 118 S.Ct. 1003, \n2  140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998)). Among other things, โan injury in fact must be both concrete and \n3  particularized.โ Id. at 1548. \n4  Here, Plaintiffs allege a possible future injury in the form of vote dilution, but no \n5  injuries beyond that.  The specter of vote dilution โmay suffice if the threatened injury is \n6  certainly impending, or there is a substantial risk that the harm will occur.โ Susan B. \n7  Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158, 134 S. Ct. 2334, 189 L.Ed.2d 246 (2014) \n8  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).    However,  Plaintiffs  must  still  prove  a  causal \n9  connection between the alleged injury and the alleged unlawful conduct on the part of \n10  Secretary Cegavske. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. \n11   As discussed above, Secretary Cegavske adhered to the letter of the law when she \n  12  worked in partnership with county election officials to implement an all-mail primary \n13  election for 2020.  Accordingly, there can be no causal connection between Plaintiffsโ \n14  alleged injury of vote dilution and the alleged violations of state law.  Plaintiffsโ claim to \n15  standing fails on this ground alone because there were no violations of state law.  For this \n16  reason, Secretary Cegavske is entitled to judgment in her favor on the merits, in addition \n17  to dismissal on jurisdictional grounds. \n18  Insofar as Plaintiffs imply that all-mail elections are inherently more vulnerable to \n19  election fraud than are in-person elections (ECF No. 2 at p. 12), their position is based \n20  entirely upon conjecture and speculation.  Five states, including Utah, have adopted all-\n21  mail election processes on a permanent basis (ECF No. 22 at p. 3).  Their decision to adopt \n22  vote-by-mail elections indicates that they have great confidence in the integrity of mail-in \n23  processes.  Furthermore, Nevadaโs limited experience with mailing precincts has yielded \n24  no evidence of election fraud (ECF No. 22 at p. 3).  Not surprisingly, Plaintiffs have \n25  framed their case as a legal dispute rather than a factual dispute (ECF No. 4, pp. 1-4) \n26  because they have no evidence that their votes will be diluted by election fraud. \n27  In  short,  Plaintiffs  engage  in  unsupported  speculation  that  their  votes  in  the \n28  primary election will be diluted by election fraud resulting from a mish-mash of alleged \n-9- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 28   Filed 04/27/20   Page 10 of 15\n \n1  statutory  and  constitutional  violations.  Since  there  has  been  no  violation  of  state  or \n2  federal law, much less a showing that an alleged violation would cause vote dilution even \n3  if  it  had  occurred,  Plaintiffs  allegations  do  not  satisfy  Article  III  requirements  for \n4  standing.        \n \n5  4.  There  is  Not  an  Unqualified  Right  under  Federal  Law  to \nCompel Adherence to State Voting Laws \n6   \n7  As to Count II of their complaint, Plaintiffs argue that alleged ultra vires conduct \n8  by Secretary Cegavske, a member of the executive branch of Nevada state government, \n9  violates  their  right  to  vote  for  members  of  the  legislative  branch  of  Nevada  state \n10  government (ECF No. 2 at pp. 15-16.) Yet, Plaintiffs offer no explanation of how the \n11  administrative action of an executive branch official can, in and of itself, burden the \n  12  Plaintiffsโ right to freely cast a vote for their preferred choice of legislative candidates. To \n13  allege that an administrative action usurps a legislative power does not alone suffice to \n14  state a claim for a voting rights violation.  Here, the only connection to voting rights is the \n15  subject matter of the statutes that were allegedly violated. As discussed above, those \n16  statutes were not actually violated, but even if they had been violated, there would be no \n17  causal nexus between the violations and the alleged burden upon the right to vote for \n18  state legislators.   \n19  Plaintiffs suggest, in summary, that the right to vote for a legislative candidate \n20  encompasses a right to protect that candidate, if elected, from future incursions upon his \n21  or her exercise of legislative powers.  This is an absurd proposition, and in substance, it \n22  merely raises a garden-variety separation of powers issue governed by state law, not a \n23  violation of voting rights guaranteed by the First and the Fourteenth Amendments to the \n24  U.S. Constitution. Because they cannot explain how the all-mail election burdens their \n25  right to vote for state legislators, only that it infringes upon state legislative powers, the \n26  Plaintiffsโ remedy for such an alleged violation is to file a writ petition in state court.  See \n27  NRS Chapter 34.   Indeed, if every clash between separate branches of state government \n28  could give rise to a cause of action for a voting rights violation, the federal courts would \n-10- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 28   Filed 04/27/20   Page 11 of 15\n \n1  become mired in endless litigation concerning the interpretation of state statutes and \n2  regulations.    \n \n3  5.  The  โPurcell  Principleโ  and  Article  IV,  ยง  4  of  the  U.S. \nConstitution Confer no Private Causes of Action \n4   \n5  Plaintiffs acknowledge that federal case law does not, at present, support their \n6  claim for an alleged violation of Article IV, ยง 4 of the U.S. Constitution, given that the \n7  claim presents a non-justiciable political question (ECF No. 2 at p. 19). See Luther v. \n8  Borden,  48  U.S.  1  (1849).    They  argue,  however,  that  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  โhas \n9  severely  cut  back  on  [the]  political-question  doctrineโ  (ECF  No.  2  at  p.  19),  thus \n10  suggesting that the Supreme Court may abandon the abstention doctrine altogether once \n11  it reviews the facts in this case.  Since that is highly improbable, this Court should reject \n  12  the claim. \n13  With regard to Purcell v. Gonzalez, 541 U.S. 1 (2006), the U.S. Supreme Court \n14  vacated a pre-election injunction because the Ninth Circuit had issued the injunction on \n15  the eve of the election. Id. at 5-6.  In this context, the holding of Purcell can only be \n16  construed as an admonition to the federal courts, not as the foundation for a private cause \n17  of  action.    It  is  generally  understood  that  that  federal  statutes  and  constitutional \n18  provisions are the source of rights enforceable in the federal district courts.  See Gonzaga \n19  University v. Doe, 536 UI.S. 273, 283 (2002) (โWe now reject the notion that our cases \n20  permit anything short of an unambiguously conferred right to support a cause of action \n21  brought under ยง 1983โ).  The Purcell case neither states nor implies that its holding was \n22  intending to confer enforceable rights upon private plaintiffs.  Moreover, it undermines \n23  Plaintiffsโ  request  for  injunctive  relief  here  because  it  is  Plaintiffs  who  seek  court \n24  alterations to election processes at the proverbial 11th hour.  If anything Purcell advises \n25  against the issuance of an injunction by this Court. \n26  โฆ \n27   \n28   \n \n-11- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 28   Filed 04/27/20   Page 12 of 15\n \nB.  Plaintiffs Cannot Demonstrate Irreparable Harm, as Adequate \n1  Remedies Exist to Address Their Speculative Claims after  \nthe Primary Election \n2   \n3  Like other equitable remedies, injunctions require a showing that irreparable harm \n4  is probable and not speculative. Nevada v. United States, 364 F.Supp.3d 1146, 1154 (D. \n5  Nev. 2019).  At this preliminary stage of the electoral process, Plaintiffsโ alleged injuries \n6  are speculative, rendering them incapable of being remedied by way of injunctive relief. \n7  See Siegel v. LePore, 120 F.Supp.2d 1041, 1052-53 (S.D. Fla. 2000) (โ[W]e find Plaintiffs' \n8  alleged injuries on an as-applied basis to be speculative, and far from irreparable, at this \n9  stage in the electoral recount process.โ)  Here, even assuming Plaintiffs correctly predict \n10  some harm (they do not), they make no effort to articulate why the appropriate remedy \n11  for that harm should not be fashioned after the primary election, when the source and the \n  12  nature of the harm might conceivably be ascertained. See Curry v. Baker, 802 F.2d 1302, \n13  1314 (11th Cir.1986) (โAlthough federal courts closely scrutinize state laws whose very \n14  design infringes on the rights of voters, federal courts will not intervene to supervise the \n15  administrative  details  of  a  local  election.  Only  in  extraordinary  circumstances  will  a \n16  challenge to a state election rise to the level of a constitutional deprivation.โ) (internal \n17  citation omitted).   \n18  C.  The Balancing of Equities Favors Defendant Cegavske \n19  Plaintiffsโ  analysis  does  not  state  the  full  standard  for  balancing  equities.    โA \n20  preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.  In each \n21  case, courts โmust balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on \n22  each party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief.โ  Winter, 555 U.S. at 24 \n23  (internal citations omitted).   \n24  Instead,  Plaintiffs  presume,  based  on  their  (refuted)  statutory  analysis  that \n25  Defendants have no cognizable interest in the plan for an all-mail primary election.  This \n26  is simply not true, ignoring the global pandemic, as  recognized by the World Health \n27  Organization, the United States, and Nevada.  Defendant Cegavske, as Nevadaโs chief \n28  election  officer,  has  an  obligation  to  conduct  the  primary  election  in  a  manner  that \n-12- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 28   Filed 04/27/20   Page 13 of 15\n \n1  protects Nevadaโs citizens by allowing them to exercise their right to vote securely while \n2  not being  denied this right by being forced to make a Hobsonโs choice between their \n3  franchise and their health.  Granting injunctive relief now will force Nevadaโs citizens to \n4  do so.   \n5  Further, in an ironic twist, granting injunctive relief at the late hour violates the \n6  โPurcell principleโ Plaintiffs mistakenly contend is a cognizable claim here.  Having the \n7  judiciary  alter  election  procedures  within  the  statutory  discretion  of  state  and  local \n8  officials at the proverbial โ11th hourโ would create confusion during this public health \n9  emergency.   \n10  Accordingly,  the  equities  balance  in  favor  of  Defendants  in  this  case,  further \n11  warranting denial of the motion.   \n  12  D.  The Public Interest Strongly Favors Defendant Cegavske \n13  Plaintiffsโ  analysis  does  not  state  the  full  standard  for  considering  the  public \n14  interest.  โIn exercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should pay particular \n15  regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction.โ  \n16  Winter,  555  U.S.  at  24.    Similar  to  Winterโs  consideration  of  military  interests, \n17  Nevada is currently in battle with the most significant public health emergency in over a \n18  century.  To be clear, after the World Health Organization declared a pandemic, President \n19  Trump  declared  a  nationwide  emergency  on  March  13,  2020.    See   \n20  https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-\n21  emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/.    Governor  Sisolak \n22  declared a Nevada emergency on March 12, 2020 (ECF No. 2 at p. 21).  Both the state and \n23  federal emergencies remain in effect.   \n24  Further, there is no genuine doubt that Nevada has the power to protect the health \n25  of its citizens, particularly in an emergency such as this.  Prior to ratification of the \n26  Constitution,  various  colonies  had  quarantine  laws,  thereby  establishing  the  legal \n27  tradition of local and state jurisdiction over matters of public health reflected in the \n28 \n-13- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 28   Filed 04/27/20   Page 14 of 15\n \n1  Constitutionโs reservation of power to the states to regulate public health, safety, and \n2  morals.  Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. 1 (1824). \n3  It is in this context that Plaintiffs seek to substitute their judgment of the public \n4  interest for those representing us in the local, state, and federal government (ECF No. 2 \n5  at  pp.  21-22).  Plaintiffsโ  contention  that  the  preliminary  injunction  favors  the  public \n6  interest in contrast to the global pandemic respectfully does not pass the laugh test.   \n7  Recognizing  the  unprecedented  global  pandemic,  state  and  local  officials  came \n8  together to work within existing statutory authority to ensure a fair Nevada primary \n9  election while minimizing health risks to its voters.  As set forth above, Plaintiffs only \n10  have speculation to support their claim that voting rights are being violated under these \n11  circumstances.  Granting the preliminary injunction would simply create further chaos \n  12  during an emergency.  This prong strongly warrants denial of the motion.   \n13  V.  CONCLUSION \n14    At most, this case presents a policy dispute about the relative merits of in-\n15  person  voting  processes  and  vote-by-mail  processes  during  a  pandemic.  Secretary \n16  Cegavske acted within her authority, pursuant to NRS 293.213(4), to approve an all-mail \n17  election for the 2020 primary election.  Her actions, and those of local election officials, \n18  have  not  imposed  a  discernable  burden  upon  Plaintiffsโ  voting  rights,  nor  have  they \n19  created an increased risk of election fraud.  For these reasons, the Court should deny \n20  Plaintiffsโ motion for declaratory and injunctive relief. \n21  DATED this 27th day of April 2020.  \nAARON D.

Hicks, Washoe County District Attorney, and \n22  Herbert B. Kaplan, Washoe County Deputy District Attorney, and hereby move to dismiss the \n23  complaint (ECF #1) filed in this action.  \n24  This Motion is brought pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and is based on \n25  the following Memorandum of Points and Authorities, and all the pleadings and papers on file \n26  herein. \n \n-1- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 62   Filed 05/11/20   Page 2 of 5\n \n1  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES \n2  I.  ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION  \n3    A.  Procedural Background   \n4  Plaintiffs filed a Complaint (ECF #1) asserting that the all-mail primary election \n5  scheduled for June 9, 2020, is invalid.   Plaintiffs simultaneously filed a motion for preliminary \n6  injunction (ECF #2) in an attempt to prevent the Nevada Secretary of State and the Washoe \n7  County Registrar of Voters from conducting the June 9, 2020, Nevada state and federal primary \n8  election from proceeding under the โall-mail electionโ plan.  \n9    In the Complaint, Plaintiffs pray for the following relief: \n10    1.  Declare that the Plan violates the right to vote the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments of the U.S. Constitution and Nev. Const. art 2, ยง 1. Article 1, ยงยง 8 and 9 of \n11  the Nevada Constitution and strips safeguards against fraudulent votes that dilute legal \nvotes;  \n12  2. Declare that the Plan violates the right to vote under the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments of the U.S. Constitution, as well as Article 2, ยง 1 of the Nevada \n13  Constitution, because the Secretary and County Administratorsโ Plan overrules and \nreplaces the legislatorโs chosen manner of elections;  \n14  3. Declare that the Plan violates the right to vote under the Purcell Principle;  \n4. Declare that the Plan violates Article I, ยง 4 , cl. 1 of the U.S. Constitution;  \n15  5. Declare that the Plan violates the Votersโ right to a republican form of \ngovernment under Article IV, ยง 4 of the U.S. Constitution;  \n16  6. Preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Secretary and County Administrators \nfrom conducting the Plan in violation of the Votersโ right to vote;  \n17  7. Preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Secretary and County Administrators \nto implement the primary election in the manner the Nevada Legislature prescribed. \n18   \n \n19  Complaint at pp. 12-13.  \n20  Plaintiffs also filed a motion to consolidate hearing on motion for preliminary injunction \n21  with hearing on the merits. (ECF # 4)  This Court granted that motion noting that โconsolidation \n22  will result in an expedited resolution of the case.โ  Minute Order (ECF #36).   \n23  The consolidated hearing was conducted on April 29, 2020.  By way of the Order entered \n24  on April 30, 2020, the Court specifically denied the motion for preliminary injunction.  (ECF \n25  #57)  However, despite the fact that the hearing on the preliminary injunction was consolidated \n26  with the hearing on the merits, the Court noted in its Order that โat the Hearing the Court \n \n-2- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 62   Filed 05/11/20   Page 3 of 5\n \n1  determined that a resolution on the merits of the case should be deferred given the Secretaryโs \n2  position as to her right to assert Eleventh Amendment immunity. Such a deferral would not \n3  affect the partiesโ ability to seek interlocutory appeal.โ  Order (ECF #57) at p. 6, n. 4.   \n4  As a result, the complaint/merits technically has not been addressed despite the April 30, \n5  2020 Order, which addressed the merits,1 but deferred resolving the merits to afford the SOS to \n6  assert Eleventh Amendment immunity, if the SOS chose to do so.    \n7  B.  Standard for Motion to Dismiss \n8  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) mandates that a court dismiss a cause of action \n9  that fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  A motion to dismiss under FRCP \n10  12(b)(6) tests the complaintโs sufficiency.  N. Star Intโl v. Ariz. Corp. Commโn, 720 F.2d 578 \n11  (9th Cir. 1983).  When considering a motion to dismiss, dismissal is appropriate only when the \n12  complaint does not give the defendant fair notice of a legally cognizable claim and the grounds \n13  on which it rests.  Bell Atl. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  A formulaic recitation of a \n14  cause of action with conclusory allegations is not sufficient, a plaintiff must plead facts showing \n15  that a violation is plausible, not just possible.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 566 U.S. 662 (2009)(citations \n16  omitted). In considering whether the complaint is sufficient to state a claim, the court will take \n17  all material allegations as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  NL \n18  Indus. Inc. v. Kaplan, 792 F.2d 896, 898 (9th Cir. 1986).  The court, however, is not required to \n19  accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or \n20  unreasonable inferences.  Sprewell v. Golden State Warriors, 266 F.3d 979, 988 (9th Cir. 2001).  \n21  // \n22  // \n23  // \n24 \n \n25 \n1 The Court specifically found that โPlaintiffs fail to establish the merits of each claim.โ  Order (ECF #57) at p. 10, l. \n26 \n14.   \n \n-3- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 62   Filed 05/11/20   Page 4 of 5\n \n1  C.  Court Has Already Found Plaintiffs Fail on the Merits   \n2  As set forth herein, the Court has already found that the Plaintiffs failed to establish the \n3  merits of each claim.  To date, the SOS has not filed anything asserting Eleventh Amendment \n4  immunity.  The Complaint must be dismissed based on the Courtโs prior findings. \n5  II.

Seehttps://www.nvsos.gov/sos/Home/Compo-\n27\nnents/News/News/2823/23 (Compl. Ex. A); see also https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/elections/vo-\n28\n1\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 2 of 22\n1 ters/absentee-voting (Compl. Ex. B). Crucially, the Plan strips the Legislatureโs vote-fraud-pre-\n2 vention safeguards that are required to prevent illegal voting that dilutes Votersโ votes and vio-\n3 lates their right to vote. And it is not the โManner . . . prescribed . . . by the Legislature,โ U.S.\n4 Const. art I, ยง 4, cl. 1, so it may not be used since federal candidates are on the ballot. Other con-\n5 stitutional flaws are established below.\n6 Under the Plan, the Secretary and County Administrators intend to mail unrequested absen-\n7 tee ballots (herein โmail-in ballotsโ) to active registered voters only: โAll active registered voters\n8 in Nevada will be mailed an absentee ballot[1] for the primary election. No action or steps, such as\n9 submitting an absentee ballot request application, will be required by individual voters in order to\n10 receive a ballot in the mail.โ Compl. Ex. A. Qualified voters who are not โactiveโ must apply for\n11 one: โAny registered voter may request to vote by mail. To request an absent ballot, you must\n12 complete and submit an Absent Ballot Request Form to the County Clerk/Registrar of Voters in\n13 the county where you are registered to vote.โ Compl. Ex. B. This mail-in-ballot Plan is not the\n14 Legislatureโs prescribed manner.\n15 As set out in the Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the Plan violates Votersโ (i) right\n16 to vote under the U.S. Constitution (including by vote dilution), (ii) right to vote in a federal elec-\n17 tion compliant with U.S. Constitution Article I, ยง 4, cl. 1, and (iii) right to a republican form of\n18 government under Article IV, ยง 4 of the U.S. Constitution.\n19 As the issues involve fundamental First Amendment rights, Voters ask the Court to waive\n20 the security mentioned in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) or provide for a nominal security\n21 of $1 payable to the Clerk. See, e.g., Baca v. Moreno Valley Unified School District, 936 F.\n22 Supp. 719, 738 (C.D. Cal. 1996 (waiving bond requirement for First Amendment case).\n23 This Motion is based on the following Memorandum of Points and Authorities, pleadings\n24 and papers on record herein, and any argument presented at the hearing on this matter.\n25\n26\n1 The Secretary uses โabsentee ballotโ synonymously with the Nevada term โabsent ballot,โ\nNevada Revised Statutes (โNRSโ) 293.013. Compl. Ex. A. But because the ballots are not sent\n27\nper the legislatively required absent-ballot request procedure, they are actually like the  mail-in\n28 ballots sent in statutory all-mail-voting plans, such as used in California.\n2\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 3 of 22\n1 Expedition is requested in a separate motion due to the nearness of the June 9 primary and\n2 the need for the Plan to be enjoined well before then to allow the Secretary and County Adminis-\n3 trators to do what they lawfully may under the controlling statutes enacted by the Legislature.\n4 April 21, 2020 Respectfully submitted,\n5 /s/ David OโMara\nDavid OโMara (Nev. bar #8599)\n6 Local Counsel for Plaintiffs\n7 Memorandum of Points and Authorities\n8 I.\nThe Plan Violates Controlling Legislation and\n9\nStrips Vital Safeguard Against Voting Fraud.\n10\nNevadaโs Primary is June 9, 2020. Compl. Ex. A. The Nevada Legislature has enacted de-\n11\ntailed legislation governing how elections are to be conductedโwith vital safeguards against vot-\n12 ing fraudโin NRS Title 24, Chapter 293 (titled โElectionsโ).2 The Secretary of State intends to\n13\nconduct the Primary with the Plan (an โall-mail electionโ) on the Secretaryโs website. Compl.\n14 Exs. A and B.3 As set out in the Motion, supra, the Plan is to mail a mail-in ballot to active regis-\n15\ntered voters without request, to require other registered voters to make a request, and to close\n16\ndown the usual polling places for in-person voting. As relevant to the legal challenges in the\n17\nComplaint, the Plan (A) is not the Legislatureโs prescribed manner, as required, and (B) strips\n18\nnecessary safeguards against vote fraud established by the Legislature.\n19\nA. The Plan is not the โManner prescribed . . . by the Legislature.โ\n20\nThough this election involves federal candidates, the Plan is not the โMannerโ of election\n21\nโprescribed . . . by the Legislature,โ as required by U.S. Constitution, Article I, ยง 4, cl. 1. See Part\n22\nII.A.4. Some examples follow.\n23\nFirst, Chapter 293 requires the Secretary to enact implementing regulations, but limits that to\n24\nthose (i) consistent with legislation and (ii) in place by the last business day of February:\n25\nThe Secretary of State shall adopt regulations, not inconsistent with the election laws of this\nState, for the conduct of primary, general, special and district elections in all cities and\n26\ncounties. Permanent regulations of the Secretary of State that regulate the conduct of a\n27\n2 Available at https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-293.html.\n28 3 Some County Administrators have also released Plan details. See Compl. Exs. C-E, G.\n3\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 4 of 22\n1 primary, general, special or district election and are effective on or before the last business\nday of February immediately preceding a primary, general, special or district election\n2 govern the conduct of that election.\n3 NRS 293.247 (emphasis added). The Plan is untimely because it was announced March 24, 2020,\n4 Compl. Ex. A, and it imposes new regulations for this election inconsistent with controlling law. \n5 Second, the law mandates that county clerks โshall establish election precinctsโ4 โon or be-\n6 fore the third Wednesday in March of every even-numbered year.โ NRS 293.205. So precincts\n7 had to be established by March 18, 2020, though the Plan was put in place on March 24, 2020.\n8 Compl. Ex. A. Accordingly, though county clerks may establish โmailing precinctsโ (where all\n9 ballots are mailed, with certain exceptions) under certain guidelines, NRS 293.343, those like all\n10 precincts had to be established by March 18 under NRS 293.205. Moreover, โon or before the\n11 last day in March of every even-numbered year, the county clerk shall provide the Secretary of\n12 State and the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau with a copy or electronic file of a map\n13 showing the boundaries of all election precincts in the county,โ NRS 293.206, and the Plan is\n14 inconsistent with that. To the extent Defendants deem the Plan such a creation of mailing pre-\n15 cincts, it was not done in the Legislatureโs prescribed manner.\n16 Third, requiring that clerks establish and the Secretary approve maps of precincts, NRS\n17 293.205 and .206, indicates the Legislatureโs intent for such precincts for in-person voting, not\n18 that the whole election be subsumed under an exception allowing mailing districts in certain cir-\n19 cumstances, e.g., โwhenever there were not more than 20 voters registered in a precinct for the\n20 last preceding general election, the county clerk may establish that precinct as a mailing pre-\n21 cinct,โ NRS 293.213(1).5 The Legislatureโs intent to have regular in-person voting and actual\n22\n4 โ[S]tatutes . . . that employ the term โshallโ are presumptively mandatory.โ Nev. Pub. Emps.\n23 Ret. Bd. v. Smith, 129 Nev. 618, 627, 310 P.3d 560, 566 (2013) (citation omitted).\n5 Defendants apparently believe County Administrators may substantially change the elec-\n24\ntion process under NRS 293.213(4):โthe county clerk may establish a mailing precinct or an ab-\n25 sent ballot mailing precinct that does not meet the requirements of subsection 1, 2 or 4 if the\ncounty clerk obtains prior approval from the Secretary of State.โ But as noted in text doing this\n26\nwas untimely under NRS 293.205 and it was not intended to apply to the whole state. Statutes\nmust be read in pari materia. Farm Mut. v. Commโr of Ins., 114 Nev. 535, 541, 958 P.2d 733,\n27\n737 (1998). And NRS 293.205(1) precludes county clerks from establishing, abolishing, altering,\n28 (continued...)\n4\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 5 of 22\n1 absentee-ballot procedures as the controlling model, with certain exceptions, is evidenced\n2 throughout Chapter 293 in its provisions for regular voting. The Plan is not the Legislatureโs pre-\n3 scribed manner.\n4 Fourth, where mailing precincts are created, โcounty clerk[s] shall, at least 14 days before\n5 establishing or designating a precinct as a mailing precinct . . . cause notice of such action to be:   \n6 (a) Posted [as prescribed] . . . ; and (b) Mailed to each Assemblyman, [etc. as prescribed]. Appar-\n7 ently the Plan supplanted this, in contravention of the Legislatureโs prescribed manner.\n8 B. The Plan strips vital anti-vote-fraud safeguards established by the Legislature.\n9 The Plan strips vital safeguards against vote fraud established by the Legislature for in-per-\n10 son voting and actual absentee-ballot voting, which are abandoned with mail-in ballots.\n11 Regarding in-person voting, Nevada requires that โa person who registered by mail or com-\n12 puter shall, for the first election in which the person votes at which that registration is valid, vote\n13 in person unless he or she has previously voted in the county in which he or she is registered to\n14 vote.โ NRS 293.272(1). And an individual who registers at the Department of Motor vehicles, by\n15 mail, or by computer must present valid identification and a document establishing residence.\n16 NRS.293.2725.6 There are some exceptions, but those are the general rules, and they allow local\n17 poll workers and watchers to monitor who is voting and deny voting and issue challenges if ap-\n18 propriateโas does in-person voting in general. But that is all gone with the Plan, under which all\n19 active, registered voters get a mail-in ballot. The safeguards mandated for in-person voting are\n20 set out further below, along with penalties for violations. See infra Part II.A.1.\n21 Regarding actual absentee-ballot voting, Nevada requires the safeguard that a voter must\n22 request the ballot (with limited exceptions): โExcept as provided in NRS 293.272 and 293.502, a\n23 registered voter may request an absent ballot if, before 5 p.m. on the 14th calendar day preceding\n24\n5 (...continued)\n25\nconsolidated and designating election precincts after โthe third Wednesday in March of every\n26 even-numbered year.โ\n6 Likewise, where mail voting has been authorized by law, individuals could only vote by\n27\nmail if they provide the county clerk the same information required at the polling location. NRS\n28 293.2725(1)(b)(1)-(2).\n5\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 6 of 22\n1 the election, the registered voter; (a) Provides sufficient written notice to the county clerk; and\n2 (b) Has identified himself or herself to the satisfaction of the county clerk.โ NRS 293.313. The\n3 Nevada Administrative Code provides that, โA clerk that receives a request for an absent ballot\n4 shall: (1) Compare the address of the voterโs residence in this State which is indicated on the re-\n5 quest with the address which is indicated on the voterโs application to register to vote.โ NAC\n6 293.295. If the address is different on the voter registration and absent ballot applications, the\n7 clerk will send a written notice including: โ(a) A copy and explanation of the provisions set forth\n8 in NRS 293.525; and (b) A postcard to be returned by the voter to the county clerk which in-\n9 cludes verification of the address of the voterโs residence in this State.  The county clerk shall use\n10 a postcard that may not be forwarded to an address of the voter which is different from the ad-\n11 dress to which the notice is mailed.โ NAC 293.295(2). As such, the safeguards in place when a\n12 registered voter moved โfrom one precinct to another or from one congressional district to an-\n13 other within the same countyโ require that the registered voter โmust be allowed to vote in the\n14 precinct where the elector previously residedโ but only after โproviding an oral or written affir-\n15 mation before an election board officer attesting to his or her new address.โ NRS 293.525. Even\n16 if the registered voter moved within the same precinct, that elector must only be โallowed to vote\n17 after providing an oral or written affirmation before an election board officer attesting to his or\n18 her new address.โ Id. By removing this requirement from the election process, a person who has\n19 moved without providing a proper change of address, would be able to circumvent the Legisla-\n20 tive safeguards and vote without providing the required affirmation before an election board offi-\n21 cer if he or she receives the mailed ballot. See also infra Part II.A.1 (further discussion).\n22 II.\nVoters Satisfy the Requirements for a Preliminary Injunction.\n23\nIn the Ninth Circuit, the sliding-scale preliminary-injunction test is as follows:\n24\nPlaintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that: (1) they are likely to succeed\n25\non the merits; (2) they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary\nrelief; (3) the balance of equities tips in their favor; and (4) an injunction is in the public\n26\ninterest. Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). The Ninth Circuit\nweighs these factors on a sliding scale, such that where there are only โserious questions\n27\ngoing to the meritsโโthat is, less than a โlikelihood of successโ on the meritsโa prelimi-\nnary injunction may still issue so long as โthe balance of hardships tips sharply in the\n28\n6\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 7 of 22\n1 plaintiff's favorโ and the other two factors are satisfied. Shell Offshore, Inc. v. Greenpeace,\nInc., 709 F.3d 1281, 1291 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell,\n2 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011)).\n3 Short v. Brown, 893 F.3d 671, 675 (9th Cir. 2018) (emphasis in original)\n4 On the merits-success prong, โthe burdens at the preliminary injunction stage track the bur-\n5 dens at trial.โ Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 429\n6 (2006); see also id. at 428 (citing Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656, 666 (2004); FEC v. Wiscon-\n7 sin Right to Life,, 551 U.S. 449, 464 (2007); United States v. Playboy Entmโt Group, Inc., 529\n8 U.S. 803, 816 (2000). So for example, where provisions burden free-speech rights, the burden is\n9 on the government to justify its provision under strict scrutiny. Finally, in First Amendment\n10 cases, success on the merits typically satisfies the other preliminary injunction elements. See,\n11 e.g., Sammartano v. First Judicial District Court, in and for County of Carson City, 303 F.3d\n12 959, 973-74 (9th Cir. 2002); Bays v. City of Fairborn, 668 F.3d 814, 819 (6th Cir. 2012).\n13 A. Voters have likely success on the merits.\n14 1. The Plan violates the right to vote by removing safeguards against fraudulent votes\nthat dilute legal votes.\n15\nAs established in Part I.B and further below, the Plan strips vital safeguard established by the\n16\nLegislature designed to protect against fraudulent votes that dilute Votersโ votes. This lack of\n17\nmandatory safeguards is a severe burden on Votersโ fundamental right to vote.\n18\nThe federal right to vote is fundamental, Harper v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663,\n19\n667 (1966), and well-established: โUndeniably the Constitution of the United States protects the\n20\nright of all qualified citizens to vote, in state as  well as in federal electionsโ and to have that vote\n21\ncounted. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 554 (1964). โThe right to vote can neither be denied\n22\noutright, nor destroyed by alteration of ballots, nor diluted by ballot-box stuffing.โ Id. at 555 (in-\n23\nternal citations omitted). โAnd the right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of\n24\nthe weight of a citizenโs vote just as effectively as by  wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the\n25\nfranchise.โ Id. The right to vote inheres in, and is protected by, the First and Fourteenth Amend-\n26\nments of the U.S. Constitution.\n27\n28\n7\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 8 of 22\n1 Nevada also recognizes a right to vote: โAll [qualified voters] shall be entitled to vote for all\n2 officers that now or hereafter may be elected by the people, and upon all questions submitted to\n3 the electors at such election.โ Nev. Const. art 2, ยง 1. Article 1, ยงยง 8 and 9 of the Nevada Consti-\n4 tution protect against violations of due process (including for โlibertyโ deprivation) and free\n5 speech rights and so provide protection for the right to vote.  See also State ex rel. McMillan v.\n6 Sadler, 58 P. 284, 288 (1899) (โThe right to vote . . . could not be given stronger or broader lan-\n7 guage.โ); Buckner v. Lynip, 41 P. 762, 764 (1895) (โright of voting, and, of course, of having the\n8 vote counted is one of most transcendent importanceโthe highest under our form of govern-\n9 ment.โ) And under Nevadaโs right to vote, restrictions on these rights are strictly scrutinized with\n10 restrictions causing disenfranchisement struck. See id. (โThat one entitled to vote shall not be\n11 deprived of his privilege by action of the authorities is a fundamental principle.โ). Nevada courts\n12 โlook to federal precedent for guidanceโ on due-process protections. Hernandez v. Bennet-\n13 Haron, 287 P.3d 305, 310 (2012).\n14 The level of scrutiny to be applied to the Plan under the federal right to vote would be strict\n15 scrutiny if the Anderson-Burdick test applies because mandatory safeguards against vote fraud\n16 have been stripped, which dilutes votes and thus is a severe burden. That test requires โweighing\n17 โthe character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights . . . that the plaintiff seeks to vin-\n18 dicateโ against โthe precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden im-\n19 posed by its rule,โโ considering โโthe extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden\n20 the plaintiffโs rights.โโ Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992) (quoting Anderson v.\n21 Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 788โ89 (1983)). Under this test, strict scrutiny applies to โburdensโ\n22 deemed โsevereโ (at issue here) as follows, id. at 434:\n23 the rigorousness of our inquiry into the propriety of a state election law depends upon the\nextent to which a challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n24 Thus, as we have recognized when those rights are subjected to โsevereโ restrictions, the\nregulation must be โnarrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance.โ\n25 Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, 289 (1992). But when a state election law provision im-\nposes only โreasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictionsโ upon the First and Fourteenth\n26 Amendment rights of voters, โthe Stateโs important regulatory interests are generally\nsufficient to justifyโ the restrictions. Anderson, 460 U.S. at 788; see also id., at 788-789,\n27 n. 9.\n28\n8\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 9 of 22\n1 Because the burdens (described below) that the requested relief would impose on the Votersโ\n2 right to vote are severe,7 strict scrutiny applies. \n3 But the Anderson-Burdick test should not apply to the Plan, even though it would typically\n4 govern actual challenges to Nevadaโs legislatively enacted election laws. This is so because the\n5 test by its terms applies to โ[i] a challenge to [ii] a state election law,โ id., and the present case\n6 involves no โchallenge toโ any โstate election law.โ The Plan is not legislated โstate election\n7 law,โ but rather it would override and replace legislated state election law. So the Anderson-\n8 Burdick test doesnโt apply to evaluating the constitutional infirmities of the requested relief\n9 (though were it held to apply, it would require strict scrutiny due to the severe burden).\n10 Rather, the applicable scrutiny where voter disenfranchisement is involved, such as by vote\n11 dilution, is found in the Reynolds-Bush case line. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964); Bush v.\n12 Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000) (per curiam).8 In considering whether, under the federal Equal Protec-\n13 tion Clause, โany constitutionally cognizable principles . . . would justify departures from the\n14 basic standard of  equality among voters,โ Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 561, Reynolds held that the right\n15 to vote is โfundamentalโ: โUndoubtedly, the right of suffrage is a fundamental matter in a free\n16 and democratic society.โ 377 U.S. at 561-62. So franchise impairments get careful, meticulous\n17 scrutiny: โEspecially since the right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is\n18 preservative of other basic civil and political rights, any alleged infringement of the right of citi-\n19 zens to vote must be carefully and meticulously scrutinized.โ Id. at 562. After reviewing argu-\n20 ments that these were โcomplexโ issues, the Court held that โ[t]o the extent that a citizenโs right\n21 to vote is debased, he is that much less a citizen,โ id. at 567, and โan individualโs right to vote for\n22 state legislators is unconstitutionally impaired when its weight is in a substantial fashion diluted\n23 when compared with votes of citizens living in other parts of the State,โ id. at 568.\n24\n7 Disenfranchisement is a severe burden. See, e.g., League of Women Voters of N.C. v. North\nCarolina, 769 F.3d 224, 244 (4th Cir. 2014); Ne. Ohio Coal. for the Homeless v. Husted, 696\n25\nF.3d 580, 597 (6th Cir. 2012).\n26\n8 Though Bush was decided long after Anderson and Burdick, no opinion in Bush cited\nBurdick and only one concurrence cited Anderson, once, but for another proposition. 551 U.S. at\n27\n112 (Rehnquist, joined by Scalia and Thomas, JJ., concurring). So those older cases have no\n28 bearing on the required analysis here.\n9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 10 of 22\n1 Building on Reynolds, Bush didnโt discuss the scrutiny level, but held that the Florida Su-\n2 preme Court could not by its orders and interpretations of state law dilute votersโ fundamental\n3 right to vote, 551 U.S. at 107-11, which was either a per-se ban of vote dilution or at least an ex-\n4 ercise of the strict scrutiny now required in equal-protection challenges involving fundamental\n5 rights with an analysis and outcome so readily apparent that it required no detailing.\n6 Bush is particularly analogous because it addressed the actions of the Florida Supreme Court\n7 (not the legislature) and found them in violation of the vote-dilution barred by Reynolds. The is-\n8 sue here, is action by the Secretary and County Administrators that would do the same. Bush\n9 noted that โ[t]he petition present[ed] the following questions: whether the Florida Supreme Court\n10 established new standards for resolving Presidential election contests, thereby violating Art. II,\n11 ยง 1, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution[9] and failing to comply with 3 U.S.C. ยง 5, and\n12 whether the use of standardless manual recounts violates the Equal Protection and Due Process\n13 Clauses.โ 551 U.S. at 103. The Court found that โit is not necessary to decide whether the Florida\n14 Supreme Court had the authority under the legislative scheme for resolving election disputes to\n15 define what a legal vote is and to mandate a manual recount implementing that definition,โ id. at\n16 105, because โrecount mechanisms implemented in response to the decisions of the Florida Su-\n17 preme Court do not satisfy the minimum requirement for nonarbitrary treatment of voters neces-\n18 sary to secure the fundamental right,โ id.Bush also noted that where both sides claim they are\n19 vindicating the right to vote, constitutional guarantees such as equal protection still control. Id. at\n20 105.10 And Bush highlighted the fact that the Florida Supreme Court order lacked the necessary\n21\n22\n9 In elections selecting Electors for choosing the President and Vice President, this provision\nmandates that the Legislature, not state and local officials, establish procedures: โEach State\n23\nshall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct . . . . .โ So the Plan here could\n24 not be used in choosing Electors because it is not the Manner directed by the Legislature.\n10 As Bush put it, regarding both sides claiming they advance the right, id.:\n25\nThere is no difference between the two sides of the present controversy on these basic\n26\npropositions. Respondents say that the very purpose of vindicating the right to vote justifies\nthe recount procedures now at issue. The question before us, however, is whether the\n27\nrecount procedures the Florida Supreme Court has adopted are consistent with its obligation\n28 to avoid arbitrary and disparate treatment of the members of its electorate.\n10\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 11 of 22\n1 โsafeguardsโ to assure confidence in the outcome. As Bush put it, adequate โsafeguardsโ are\n2 mandatory, id. at 109:\n3\n[W]e are presented with a situation where a state court with the power to assure uniformity\nhas ordered a statewide recount with minimal procedural safeguards. When a court orders\n4\na statewide remedy, there must be at least some assurance that the rudimentary require-\nments of equal treatment and fundamental fairness are satisfied. \n5\nThat mandate to maintain โsafeguardsโ to assure confidence in the election is particularly relevant\n6\nto Votersโ argument below.\n7\nSo the Plan here is either barred per se11 if votes are diluted or it would be subject to strict\n8\nscrutiny and the government must prove it is narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental inter-\n9\nest. Under Reynolds and Bush it is readily seen that vote dilution cannot be justified.\n10\nThe Plan violates the Votersโ right to vote by diluting their votes with illegal votes given the\n11\nremoval of safeguards against illegal voting established by the Legislature. See supra Part I.B and\n12\ninfra at 11-14. While vote dilution in Reynolds and Bush was reviewed under an equal-protection\n13\nanalysis, Reynolds held that โ[t]he right to vote can neither be denied outright, nor destroyed by\n14\nalteration of ballots, nor diluted by ballot-box stuffing.โ 377 U.S. at 555 (internal citations omitted),\n15\nand those violations donโt involve equal protection. โ[T]he right of suffrage can be denied by a\n16\ndebasement or dilution of the weight of a citizenโs vote just as effectively as by  wholly prohibiting\n17\nthe free exercise of the franchise,โ id., which is not limited to the equal-protection context. Likewise,\n18\nโthe Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments prohibit a State from overweighting or diluting votes\n19\non the basis of race or sex,โ id. at 557, which is not limited to the equal-protection context. So\n20\nchallenges based on vote debasement or dilution are not limited to the equal-protection context. \n21\nConsequently, since the Plan dispenses with current statutory protections against illegal voting\n22\nfound in actual absentee-ballot and in-person voting law, the Plan is a cognizable dilution of the\n23\nvotes of eligible, registered voters such as Plaintiff Voters. That dilution requires strict scrutiny,\n24\nbecause โany alleged infringement of the right of citizens to vote must be carefully and meticulously\n25\nscrutinized.โ id. at 562, which the Plan fails.\n26\n27\n11 If government may not dilute votersโ right to vote, doing so cannot be justified under any\n28 interest-tailoring analysis.\n11\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 12 of 22\n1 Both in-person and actual absentee-ballot voting laws include safeguards that protect against\n2 voter fraud. But the Plan strips statutory protections provided by the Legislature to prevent such\n3 fraud. For in-person voting, a first-time voter generally must appear in person with identification and\n4 proof of residence location. See supra Part I.B. For all in-person voters whose name appears on the\n5 roster of registered voters (or they provide an affirmation that they are entitled to vote), the voter\n6 โstate[s] his or her name to the election board officer in charge of the roster,โ who โshall\n7 . . . [a]nnounce the name of the registered voter,โ require a signature and then authenticate it or\n8 resolve any discrepancy. NRS 293.285. The voter โmust sign his or her name in the roster or on a\n9 signature card when he or she applies to vote.โ NRS.293.277(1). This is all done before witnesses\n10 who may know the person, but in any case can watch the personโs demeanor and can see if the\n11 person is trying to duplicate a signature from an exemplar or produces the signature spontaneously.\n12 And observers are permitted at in-person polling places. NRS 293.124 and .247; NAC 293.245\n13 (โObservation of conduct of voting at polling placeโ). The signature is then compared by an election\n14 board officer with the signature on file or on approved identification cards, such as a driverโs license.\n15 Id. at (1)-(2). Records are checked to assure the voter has not already voted. Id. at (3). The law\n16 provides that any person who votes knowing he or she is not qualified commits a Class D felony, as\n17 does one attempting to vote in the name of another. NRS 293.775. The same penalty applies to those\n18 voting more than once in the same election. NRS 293.780.\n19 To obtain an actual absentee ballot, a voter must request the ballot and โidentif[y] himself or\n20 herself to the satisfaction of the county clerk.โ NRS 293.313.โA clerk that receives a request for an\n21 absent ballot shall: (1) Compare the address of the voterโs residence in this State which is indicated\n22 on the request with the address which is indicated on the voterโs application to register to\n23 vote.โ NAC 293.295. If the address is different on the voter registration and absent-ballot applica-\n24 tions, the court will send a written notice including: โ(a) A copy and explanation of the provisions\n25 set forth in NRS 293.525; and (b) A postcard to be returned by the voter to the county clerk which\n26 includes verification of the address of the voterโs residence in this State.  The county clerk shall use\n27 a postcard that may not be forwarded to an address of the voter which is different from the address\n28 to which the notice is mailed.โ NAC 293.295(2). Of course, none of the in-person safeguards of\n12\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 13 of 22\n1 monitoring the voter and the signing are present with actual absentee balloting, but the same penal-\n2 ties apply for being unqualified to vote, voting in anotherโs name, and voting twice. In addition, what\n3 is known as โballot harvestingโ is banned by NRS NRS 293.330(4), which bars return of an actual\n4 absentee ballot except by the voter โor, at the request of the voter, a member of the voterโs familyโ\n5 (with the family member required to verify the facts on a form). See also NRS 293.353 (same\n6 restriction for โmailing ballotโ as for โabsent ballotโ). Presumably those restrictions and penalties\n7 apply to mail-in ballots as well as to actual absentee ballots. Though some actual absentee-ballot\n8 safeguards remain under the mail-in-ballot Plan, the elimination of the necessity to request a ballot\n9 through the usual procedures is a safeguard that must not be omitted because of the fraud potential\n10 of having unrequested, perhaps unexpected ballots arriving around the state. An automatically mailed\n11 mail-in ballot might be ignored, lost in a pile of letters set aside for a period before opening to allow\n12 any resident viruses to die, not noticed because the resident voters are sheltering in place at a differ-\n13 ent location, or some other such possibility. And having large numbers of unrequested mail-in ballots\n14 flooding the state in such conditions invites ballot fraud.\n15 Both the in-person and actual-absentee-ballot scenarios demonstrate a statutory scheme that\n16 ensures multiple levels of verification before voting to guarantee the integrity of the voting process.\n17 Voters casting fraudulent ballots face the threat of felony prosecution. All of these protections and\n18 penalties are provided by the Legislature and may not be overruled and replaced by government\n19 officials as in the Plan. The Plan would require the State to forego almost all in-person voting and\n20 instead conduct the primary by automatically mailed mail-in ballots. County Administrators would\n21 send each active registered voter in the county a mail-in ballot without the individual first having to\n22 submit an application for an actual absentee ballot. That mail-in ballot, then, is to be completed by\n23 the voter and returned by mail. An election conducted primarily by mail-in ballot, per the Plan,\n24 would all but ensure an election replete with ballot fraud.\n25 It is all but certain that, without these measures, many mail-in ballots will be unlawfully re-\n26 ceived, voted, and counted in the primary. Those individuals who illegally vote will unlawfully\n27 negate and ultimately dilute the choices made by the lawfully registered voters of this Stateโ voters\n28\n13\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 14 of 22\n1 the Legislature has carefully and methodically taken great care to protect. (As noted in the following\n2 paragraph, this is a cognizable interest without the need for specific proof in a case.)\n3 Because the Plan (i) strips away substantial legislative safeguards against voter fraud and (ii)\n4 substitutes a mail-in balloting scheme with a substantial risk of fraud, a substantial likelihood of\n5 additional illegal votes exists. That risk is cognizable because โsafeguardsโ are required, Bush, 531\n6 U.S. at 109, and because โconfidence in the integrity of our electoral processes is essential to the\n7 functioning of our participatory democracyโ and โ[v]oter fraud drives honest citizens out of the\n8 democratic process and breeds distrust of our government.โ Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 4\n9 (2006). Similarly, the Seventh Circuit recently stayed an injunction by the U.S. District Court for the\n10 Western District of Wisconsin because it had given inadequate attention to the interest in preventing\n11 voter fraud by eliminating the witness requirement for absentee-ballot signatures: โThis court is\n12 concerned with the overbreadth of the district courtโs order, which categorically eliminates the\n13 witness requirement applicable to absentee ballots and gives no effect to the stateโs substantial\n14 interest in combating voter fraud.โ Democratic National Committee v. Bostelmann, slip op. 3,12 Nos.\n15 20-1538, 20-1539, 20-1545 & 20-1546 (7th Cir. Apr. 3, 2020) (citing Griffin v. Roupas, 385 F.3d\n16 1128, 1130 (7th Cir. 2004)).13\n17 Vote dilution, identified in Reynolds and Bush, supra Part II.A.1, is readily apparent where\n18 illegal votes are allowed because of inadequate safeguards. Only the votes of eligible, registered\n19\n12 The slip opinion could not be found on LEXIS but is available at\n20\nhttps://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/litigation/documents/DNC_v_Bost_BL-30.pdf.\n21\n13 Though the district-court order in Bostelmann, Nos. 3:20-cv-00249-wmc, 3:20-cv-00278-\n22 wmc, 3:20-cv-00284-wmc, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57918 (W.D. Wisc. Apr. 2, 2020), granted\nsome election-related relief based on COVID-19 concerns, other courts have not. See, e.g., Wil-\n23 liams v. DeSantis, No. 1:20-cv-00067 (N.D. Fla.

The Supreme Court\n26\nof New Mexico recently rejected an all-mail-in-ballot plan, instead ordering that absentee-ballot\napplications be mailed to registered voters so they could apply, in State ex rel Riddle v. Oliver,\n27\nNo. S-1-SC-38228 (Ariz. Apr. 16, 2020) (order available at https://cms.nmcourts.gov/up-\n28 loads/files/News/38228%20Final%20Order%20(4-16-20).pdf). \n14\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 15 of 22\n1 voters are supposed to be cast and counted. So every legitimate voter is one of the total number of\n2 legitimate voters. For example, if the legitimate voterโs vote is one of ten legitimate votes cast, her\n3 vote is worth one tenth of the total. But if, in addition, ten illegal votes are cast, her vote is now\n4 worth one twentieth of the total. So her vote was debased by half as a result of vote dilution. That\n5 violates her constitutional right to vote.\n6 In sum, because the weakened safeguards in the requested relief predict dilution and debasement\n7 by illegal voting and create doubt about the legitimacy of the election, the right to vote of eligible,\n8 registered voters is violated.\n9 2. The Plan violates the right to vote for legislative representatives to establish the man-\nner of elections by substituting a scheme that replaces the legislaturesโ plan.\n10\nThe Votersโ right to vote is also violated by the Plan because, while Voters voted for representa-\n11\ntives with plenary power to govern the manner of voting to represent them, they didnโt vote for the\n12\nSecretary and County Administrators to represent them, yet the manner of voting proposed here is\n13\nto be decided by the Secretary and County Administrators instead of the elected representatives in\n14\nthe Legislature. This invalidates Votersโ votes for their representatives in this context. While state\n15\nand local officials face balloting, they are not elected to be representatives of the People in the\n16\nLegislature. That eliminates representation, representatives, and the right to vote for representatives\n17\nin the Legislature to decide the manner of elections. That right to vote is fundamental, Harper, 383\n18\nU.S. at 667, and protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, as well\n19\nas Article 2, ยง 1 of the Nevada Constitution (โAll [qualified voters] shall be entitled to vote for all\n20\nofficers that now or hereafter may be elected by the people, and upon all questions submitted to the\n21\nelectors at such election.โ), and Article 1, ยงยง 8 and 9, which protect against violations of due process\n22\n(including for โlibertyโ deprivation) and free speech rights and so provide protection for the right to\n23\nvote. โUndeniably the Constitution of the United States protects the right of all qualified citizens to\n24\nvote, in state as  well as in federal electionsโ and to have that vote counted. Reynolds, 377 U.S. at\n25\n554.\n26\n27\n28\n15\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 16 of 22\n1 Since the Plan would overrule and replace the representativesโ chosen manner of election, the\n2 Votersโ votes for representatives who would decide the manner of elections is invalidated. That\n3 violates the Votersโ right to vote.\n4 3. The Plan violates the right to vote under the Purcell Principle.\n5 The Plan also violates what has come to be called the Purcell Principle. See, e.g., Richard L.\n6 Hasen, Reining in the Purcell Principle, 43 Fl. St. U. L. Rev. 427 (2016). That Principle is named\n7 for Purcell, 549 U.S. 1. The Principle is anchored in the right to vote and its potential for debase-\n8 ment. Id. at 4 (citing Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 555). Among its critiques of the Ninth Circuit for staying\n9 a voter-identification requirement near an election, the Court held in Purcell that such near-election\n10 court orders themselves risk debasement and dilution of the right to vote because โ[c]ourt orders\n11 affecting elections, especially conflicting orders, can themselves result in voter confusion and\n12 consequent incentive to remain away from the polls. As an election draws closer, that risk will\n13 increase.โ 549 U.S. at 4-5. The โpossibility that qualified voters might be turned away from the\n14 polls,โ id. 4, violates their right to vote. So the general rule is that no court order altering election\n15 procedures near an election is permissible because it violates the right to vote. And because the\n16 Principle is anchored in the right to vote, it applies to state and local election administrators as well\n17 because their election-altering actions pose the same risk.\n18 On April 6, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion in Republican National Committee\n19 v. Democratic National Committee, No. 19A1016, 2020 U.S. LEXIS 2195 (U.S. Apr. 6, 2020) (per\n20 curiam), slip op. available at https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19a1016_o759.pdf,\n21 again applying that Principle, which it summarized thus:\n22 This Court has repeatedly emphasized that lower federal courts should ordinarily not alter\nthe election rules on the eve of an election. See Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U. S. 1 (2006) (per\n23 curiam); Frank v. Walker, 574 U. S. 929 (2014); Veasey v. Perry, 574 U. S. __ (2014). \n24 2020 U.S. LEXIS 2195, at **2-3. This RNC case stayed a lower-court order allowing voters to mail\n25 absentee ballots after election day. RNC recited various problems that the lower-court order posed\n26 and said they โunderscore[] the wisdom of the Purcell principle, which seeks to avoid this kind of\n27 judicially created confusion.โ Id. at **3. A crucial point was that the lower-court order โfundamen-\n28 tally alters the nature of the election.โ Id.\n16\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 17 of 22\n1 The Plan also fundamentally alters the nature of Nevadaโs election, changing it from an in-\n2 person election with actual absentee ballots received by request to a scheme of mailing mail-in\n3 ballots to active, registered voters and highly restricted walk-in voting options. The same risk of\n4 voters losing their franchise because of the confusion caused by this recent Plan exists. For example,\n5 voters are accustomed to going to the polls on election day or requesting an actual absentee ballot.\n6 They may be unaware that the usual options have been replaced with mail-in ballots. They might\n7 show up at their usual polling place on election day to discover there is no poll there, and the usual\n8 whatever-else-happens, in-person, voting opportunity is gone. As noted above, an automatically\n9 mailed mail-in ballot doesnโt alter the disenfranchisement risk because it might be ignored, lost in\n10 a pile of letters set aside for a period before opening to allow any resident viruses to die, not noticed\n11 because the resident voters are sheltering in place at a different location, or some other such possibil-\n12 ity. This fundamental alteration of the nature of the election raises the same possibility of voters\n13 losing their franchise as in Purcell and RNC. Here, as in RNC, the Purcell-Principle should apply\n14 as applicable: โ[W]hen a lower court intervenes and alters the election rules so close to the election\n15 date, our precedents indicate that this Court, as appropriate, should correct that error.โ Slip op. 3. The\n16 same should apply to state and local election administrators who alter election procedures as the Plan\n17 does long after the dates by which the Legislature established that changes must be made to avoid\n18 such disenfranchisement potential. See supra Part I.A.\n19 4. The Plan violates the Votersโ right to have, and to vote in, federal elections with the\nmanner of election is chosen by the legislature (U.S. Const. art I, ยง 4, cl. 1).\n20\nThe Plan violates Votersโ right to have, and to vote in, a federal election where the โMannerโ\n21\nof election is โprescribed . . . by the Legislature,โ as required: \n22\nThe Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall\n23 be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by\nLaw make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.\n24\nU.S. Const. art.

So the Primary\n27\nmust be conducted in the Legislatureโs prescribed manner. But  the Plan is not at all what the Legis-\n28\n17\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 18 of 22\n1 lature chose and is contrary to controlling legislation. See Part I. The Secretary and County Adminis-\n2 trators chose a manner not authorized by the Legislature and contrary to the Legislatureโs choices.\n3 See Part I.A. They have eliminated safeguards against vote fraud that the Legislature chose. See Parts\n4 I.B and II.A.1. So the Plan violates Article I, ยง 4, cl. 1, including a violation of the Voterโs right to\n5 have, and to vote in, such an election as the U.S. Constitution prescribes. \n6 Recall that in Bush the U.S. Supreme Court listed a similar provision requiring that elections\n7 for presidential electors be conducted in the manner chosen by the Legislature as an issue in the case,\n8 but decided that it need not reach it because what the Florida Supreme Court had done fell so woe-\n9 fully short of what was required under the vote-dilution ban that the manner-of-election issue need\n10 not be reached. 551 U.S. at 103 (โwhether the Florida Supreme Court established new standards for\n11 resolving Presidential election contests, thereby violating Art. II, ยง 1, cl. 2, of the United States\n12 Constitutionโ). Similarly here, the parallel manner-of-election provision for other federal elections\n13 is an issue that may not need to be reached because the vote-dilution claims under the fundamental\n14 right to vote can readily decide the case. But if the Court doesnโt decide this case on vote-dilution\n15 or another claim, this issue must be reached. And the Plan violates Article I, ยง 4, cl. 1.\n16 5. The Plan violates the right to a republican form of government under the United\nStates Constitution.\n17\nThe loss of representative government and invalidation of votes for legislators identified in the\n18\npreceding claims violates the Votersโ right to โa republican form of governmentโ under the U.S.\n19\nConstitution. Article IV, ยง 4, of the U.S. Constitution provides that โthe United States shall guarantee\n20\nto every state in this union a republican form of governmentโ (โGuarantee Clauseโ). \n21\nA republican form of government is lost if a Secretary of State and County Administrators\n22\nsupplant the peopleโs elected representative in exercising powers entrusted entirely to the Legisla-\n23\nture, in this case establishing the manner of elections. And since the U.S. Constitution is founded\n24\non and derived from the will of the People who hold the ultimate power, see U.S. Const. preamble\n25\n(โWe the People . . . .โ), the people have a right to the republican government they chose in their own\n26\nexercise of that political will and which the United States guarantees. So the requested relief would\n27\n28\n18\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 19 of 22\n1 violate the very foundational rights of the Voters to a republican form of government and to vote in\n2 manner established under a republican form of government.\n3 Now, Defendants may argue that claims under the Guarantee Clause are nonjusticiable political\n4 questions. That view is rooted in dicta in Luther v. Borden, 48 U.S. 1 (1849). SeeNew York v. United\n5 States, 505 U.S. 144, 184 (1992) (โview . . . has its origin in Lutherโ). But the Supreme Court has\n6 severely cut back on political-question doctrine, starting with Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962),\n7 and continuing with Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. 189 (2012), which restricted\n8 political questions to where there is either โa textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of\n9 [an] issue to a coordinate political departmentโ or โa lack of judicially discoverable and manageable\n10 standards for resolving it,โ id. at 195 (citation omitted). In New York, the Court said โperhaps not\n11 all claims under the Guarantee Clause present nonjusticiable political questions.โ 505 U.S. at 185\n12 (citing Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 582).\n13 In Kerr v. Hickenlooper, 744 F.3d 1156 (10th Cir. 2014), the Tenth Circuit decided that\n14 political-question doctrine didnโt prevent considering a Guarantee Clause claim against a voter-\n15 initiative constitutional amendment, though that was vacated and remanded by Kerr, 135 S. St. 2927\n16 (2015), and ultimately resolved on lack of ordinary Article III standing, 824 F.3d 1207, 1217 (10th\n17 Cir. 2016). Other courts have considered Guarantee Clause claims on the merits. See, e.g., Largess\n18 v. Supreme Judicial Court; Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians v. Superior Court, 148 P.3d\n19 1126, 1137-39 (Cal. 2006); Vansickle v. Shanahan, 511 P.2d 223, 234 (Kan. 1973).\n20 Scholars advocate and foresee Guarantee Clause challenges being allowed by the Supreme\n21 Court. See, e.g., Erwin Chemerinsky, Cases Under the Guarantee Clause Should Be Justiciable, 65\n22 U. Colo. L. Rev. 849, 864-69 (1994); see also id. at 851 (โ[T]he time is clearly approaching in which\n23 the Court may . . . reject the view that cases under the Guarantee Clause should always be dismissed\n24 on political question grounds.โ); Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 398 (2d ed. 1988):\n25 John Hart Ely, Democracy and Distrust: a Theory of Judicial Review 118 n.* (1980).\n26 The Plan presents a case where a Guarantee Clause challenge should not be deemed a political\n27 question. In Clinton, the U.S. Supreme Court limited political questions to where there is either a\n28 clear โconstitutional commitmentโ to some political branch or โa lack of judicially discoverable and\n19\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 20 of 22\n1 manageable standards.โ 566 U.S. at 195. Only the โstandardsโ issue might apply here. While such\n2 โstandardsโ might be difficult in some situations, they are not here. The Plan substitutes the Secretary\n3 and County Administrators for the Legislature in doing the exclusively legislative function of\n4 establishing the โmannerโ of this election. The U.S. Supreme Court would simply need to hold that\n5 in a republican form of government, state and local officials may not usurp the legislative role and\n6 the rule of law and so declare the Plan unconstitutional under the Guarantee Clause and enjoin it. So\n7 the Plan violates the Guarantee Clause and the similar protection of the Nevada Constitution.\n8 *    *    *\n9 In sum, Voters have a strong likelihood of success on all their claims, so that the other\n10 preliminary-injunction elements readily follow, particularly since the right to vote is based on the\n11 First and Fourteenth Amendments. And even were any particular claim deemed to present only\n12 โserious questions going to the merits,โ the preliminary injunction is proper because โโthe balance\n13 of hardships tips sharply in [Votersโ] favorโ and the other two factors are satisfied.โ Short, 893 F.3d\n14 at 675 (citation omitted).\n15 B. Voters have irreparable harm.\n16 Voters have irreparable harm for reasons tracking their claims. They have no remedy at law if\n17 the Plan proceeds and the election is held in violation of Votersโ constitutional rights. If the Plan\n18 proceeds, their right to vote, to have equal protection, and to a federal election compliant with the\n19 federal constitution under Articles I, ยง 4, cl. 1 and IV, ยง 4 will be violated. See supra Part II.A. In\n20 Obama for America, 888 F. Supp. 2d 897 (S.D. Oh. 2012), affโd, 697 F.3d 423, the district court\n21 readily found irreparable harm after finding likely merits success on the right-to-vote claim, id. at\n22 910. That should happen here because constitutional violations caused by the Plan canโt be repaired\n23 after the election.\n24 C. The balance harms favors the injunction.\n25 The balance of harms favors the injunctionโsharply, were that required for any claim. \n26 On Votersโ side are core, fundamental, constitutional rights that are violated by the Plan if it is\n27 allowed to proceed. That typically suffices in constitutional challenges, or else rights arenโt rights.\n28\n20\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 21 of 22\n1 On the Secretary of Stateโs and County Administratorโs side is a Plan that is not authorized by\n2 the Legislature, is in violation of controlling laws, and seems to have been done without considering\n3 fundamental constitutional and rule-of-law mandates that govern their work. Defendants can have\n4 no cognizable interest in advancing the Plan if, as shown, it is highly likely that the Plan violates\n5 constitutional and statutory provisions.\n6 D. The public interest favors the injunction.\n7 The public interest favors following the rule of law by obeying constitutional and statutory\n8 mandates and protecting constitutional rights. The public interest favors having elections held under\n9 controlling authorities. \n10 Now, it is true that Defendants recite the Plan as being responsive to the health risks from the\n11 COVID-19 pandemic, to which Voters are of course sympathetic. And naturally the public has an\n12 interest in health and safety, and the Governor has issued an  Emergency Declaration concerning\n13 coronavirus.  See https://d1q4hslcl8rmbx.cloudfront.net/assets/uploads/2020/03/Declaration-of-\n14 Emergency-re-COVID.pdf; see alsohttp://gov.nv.gov/News/Emergency_Orders/Emergency_Orders/\n15 (Governorโs emergency orders). But that doesnโt mean Defendants can jettison constitutional and\n16 statutory rights and  mandates and fashion a remedy essentially out of whole cloth. Defendantsโ only\n17 options are to do what the controlling constitutional and statutory provisions permitโotherwise the\n18 rule of law fails. Within that rule of law, is where they must find their remedy.\n19 And Defendants do have permissible options that they should be doing instead of their forbidden\n20 Plan. Early and regular voting can be held in compliance with recommendations to practice social\n21 distancing, hand sanitizing, and wearing personal protection equipment, just as people do at the\n22 grocery store and other essential places and functions. To the extent, the Governor were to have the\n23 authority to bar in-person voting by classifying it as nonessential and were to do so  (on which Voters\n24 donโt opine except to note that it would not be consistent with U.S. Constitution Article I, ยง 4, cl.\n25 1 for a federal election), then the normal absentee-ballot process must control. Actual absentee\n26 ballots may be requested and cast under normal procedures and anti-fraud safeguards. Instead of\n27 advising the public that mail-in ballots will be automatically mailed to all active, registered voters,\n28 Defendants should be using their same time and communication channels to tell all registered voters\n21\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 22 of 22\n1 to quickly request an actual absentee ballot and return it as the law requires. That will leave in place\n2 the normal safeguards for actual absentee ballots that are lost with the Plan.\n3 So the public interest favors following the rule of law and abiding by constitutional and statutory\n4 mandates. It favors the requested preliminary injunction.\n5 Conclusion\n6 For the reasons show, this Court should preliminarily enjoin the Plan.\n7\nRespectfully submitted,\n8\n/s/ David OโMara\n9 James Bopp, Jr. (Ind. bar #2838-84)* David OโMara (Nev. bar #8599)\njboppjr@aol.com The OโMara Law Firm, P.C.\n10 Richard E.

This motion is based upon the Memorandum of Points \n13\n& Authorities below, all pleadings, paper, and exhibits on file in this matter, and any oral \n14\nargument the Court sees fit to allow. \n15\nINTRODUCTION \n16\n  Plaintiffs, individual Nevada voters represented by the organization True the Vote, have \n17\nfiled this lawsuit in an effort to prevent Defendants from acting to protect the Nevada electorate \n18\nin the face of the coronavirus pandemic. The relief they now seek in their unreasonably delayed \n19\namended complaint would cause a massive and wasteful disruption of Nevadaโs plans for the \n20\nJune 9, 2020 primary election. Because their causes of actions are factually unsupported and \n21\nlegally unsound, this Court should dismiss their amended complaint with prejudice. \n22\n  This Court has already held, in ruling on Plaintiffsโ initial motion for a preliminary \n23\ninjunction, that Plaintiffs lack standing because their primary claimed injuryโthe dilution of \n24\ntheir votes based on the specter of increased illegal voting if Nevada changes from an absent \n25\nballot  voting  system  to  an  automatic  vote  by  mail  systemโis  entirely  speculative  and  a \n26\ngeneralized grievance. Plaintiffsโ amended complaint does nothing to remedy this fundamental \n27\nflaw, and instead serves only to compound the original complaintโs shortcomings by introducing \n28\n2 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 71   Filed 05/19/20   Page 3 of 16\n \n1 new, untenable causes of action coupled with further distortions of the law and the facts. \n2 BACKGROUND \n3   On March 24, 2020, Defendant Barbara Cegavske, the Nevada Secretary of State (the \n4 โSecretaryโ)โalong with Defendant Deanna Spikula, the Registrar of Voters for Washoe County \n5 (the โWashoe Registrarโ), Defendant Joseph P. Gloria, the Registrar of Voters for Clark County \n6 (the โClark Registrarโ), and election officials from Nevadaโs 14 other counties and Carson \n7 Cityโannounced a plan to conduct the June 9, 2020 primary election (the โJune Primaryโ) \n8 predominantly by mail, to protect voters and elections officials in the face of the growing health \n9 crisis. See Amended Verified Complaint (โAm. Compl.โ), ECF No. 64, ยถ 20. In the weeks that \n10 followed, county officials began posting notices describing their specific plans to adapt voting in \n11 light of the pandemic. Id. ยถยถ 26โ37. An essential feature of the plan for the June Primary is the \n12 mailing of ballots to registered voters, without the need for voter requests. Id. ยถ 21. \n13   On April 21, 2020, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit, contending that Nevada election officials \n14 do not have authority under Nevada law to proactively mail ballots to voters. See Verified \n15 Complaint (โCompl.โ), ECF No. 1. That same day, Plaintiffs followed with a motion for a \n16 preliminary injunction. See ECF No. 2. On April 27, Intervenor-Defendants filed a motion to \n17 intervene, which this Court granted. See ECF Nos. 27, 39. \n18   Following  a  hearing,  the  Court  issued  an  order  denying  Plaintiffsโ  motion  for  a \n19 preliminary injunction on April 30, 2020. See Order, ECF No. 57. The Court concluded that \n20 โPlaintiffs have not established an injury particularized to them to confer standing,โ and that \n21 even if they had standing, their โclaims fail on the merits.โ Id. at 2. \n22   Subsequently, on May 4, the Clark Registrar announced a revised election plan for the \n23 June Primary in a court document filed in Intervenor-Defendantsโ state court action. Am. Compl. \n24 ยถ 39.1 Among these revisions were the decisions to provide two additional in-person voting \n25                                                  \n26\n1   As discussed at greater length in their motion to intervene, see ECF No. 27 at 3โ4 & n. 2, \nfour of the Intervenor-Defendants, along with a group of Nevada voters, filed an action in \n27\nNevada state court against Defendants on April 16, 2020. Id. at 3 & Ex. 3; see also Corona v. \nCegavske, No. 20-OC-00064-1B (Nev. Dist. Ct. Apr. 16, 2020). Crucially, and contrary to \n28\n(footnote continued) \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 71   Filed 05/19/20   Page 4 of 16\n \n1 locations and mail ballots to all registered voters, active and inactive alike. Id. The Clark \n2 Registrar also plans to appoint field registrars to collect sealed ballots from voters. Id. ยถ 40. \n3   Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on May 13, 2020. In addition to dropping two of \n4 their original causes of action,2 Plaintiffs include Count I, a recast of their original Count II, \n5 which generally alleges a violation of the Nevada Legislatureโs electoral policies, compare \n6 Compl. ยถยถ 45โ49, with Am. Compl. ยถยถ 97โ102โbut now with the added allegation that voters \n7 will be directly disenfranchised, Am. Compl. ยถ 105. And Plaintiffs add a new cause of action, \n8 Count IV, which claims that the Clark Registrarโs revised plans for Clark County voters violate \n9 the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. See id. ยถยถ 123โ28. These causes of action \n10 join two claims imported from Plaintiffsโ original complaintโCount II, a right to vote claim \n11 premised on purported vote dilution, see id. ยถยถ 108โ16, and Count III, which alleges a violation \n12 of the U.S. Constitutionโs Elections Clause, see id. ยถยถ 117โ22. \n13 LEGAL STANDARD \n14   A  plaintiff  bears  the  burden  of  establishing  federal  subject  matter  jurisdiction  by  a \n15 preponderance of the evidence. United States ex rel. Solis v. Millennium Pharms., Inc., 885 F.3d \n16 623, 625 (9th Cir. 2018). Where, as here, a โfacialโ challenge is brought under Federal Rule of \n17 Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), the moving parties โassert[] that the allegations contained in [the] \n18 complaint are insufficient on their face to invoke federal jurisdiction,โ but โdo not โdispute[] the \n19 truth of the allegations.โโ Lacano Invs., LLC v. Balash, 765 F.3d 1068, 1071 (9th Cir. 2014) \n20 (alterations in original) (quoting Safe Air for Everyone v. Meyer, 373 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir. \n21 2004)). Moreover, a plaintiff must demonstrate Article III standing for each form of relief \n22 sought. Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 185 (2000). \n23                                                  \n24 Plaintiffs in this case, Intervenor-Defendants โdo not object to Defendantsโ expansion of vote by \nmail; indeed, the current public health crisis necessitates that states allow voters to cast ballots \n25 without leaving their homes.โ ECF No. 27 at 3โ4. \n26 2   Plaintiffsโ amended complaint no longer includes the original complaintโs Count III, a \nclaim premised on the U.S. Supreme Courtโs decision in Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1 (2006) \n27 (per  curiam),  see  Compl.  ยถยถ 50โ55,  or  Count  V,  which  alleged  a  violation  of  the  U.S. \nConstitutionโs Guarantee Clause, see id. ยถยถ 62โ66. \n28\n4 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 71   Filed 05/19/20   Page 5 of 16\n \n1 โ[T]he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements.โ Lujan v. Defs. \n2 of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). โThe plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, \n3 (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be \n4 redressed by a favorable judicial decision.โ Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016). \n5   To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must โstate a claim to \n6 relief that is plausible on its face.โ Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. \n7 Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). Although a court must โtake all of the factual \n8 allegations in the complaint as true,โ id. (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555), โ[f]actual allegations \n9 must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.โ Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. \n10 โRule 12(b)(6) permits dismissal on the basis of either (1) the โlack of a cognizable legal theory,โ \n11 or (2) โthe absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory.โโ Newlands Asset \n12 Holding Tr. v. SFR Invs. Pool 1, LLC, No. 3:17-cv-00370-LRH-WGC, 2017 WL 5559956, at *2 \n13 (D. Nev. Nov. 17, 2017) (quoting Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Depโt, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. \n14 1990)). \n15 ARGUMENT \n16   This Court should grant Intervenor-Defendantsโ motion to dismiss because as to each \n17 claim, Plaintiffs lack standing, fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or both.3 \n18\nI.  Count I should be dismissed for lack of standing and for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief can be granted. \n19\n20   Count  I  of  Plaintiffsโ  amended  complaint  alleges,  like  their  original  claims,  that \n21 Defendantsโ decision to proactively mail ballots to voters violates Nevada law. See Am. Compl. \n                                                 \n22\n23 3   Intervenor-Defendants  recognize  that  this  Court  might  not  entertain  an  Eleventh \nAmendment immunity defense unless Defendants themselves raise it. But because the Court can \n24 raise the issue sua sponte, see United States ex rel. Burlbaw v. Orenduff, 548 F.3d 931, 942 (10th \nCir.  2008)  (citing  Wis.  Depโt  of  Corr.  v.  Schacht,  524  U.S.  381,  389  (1998)),  Intervenor-\n25 Defendants note that โ[t]he Eleventh Amendment prevents a federal court  from  issuing  an \ninjunction against state officials solely to require them to adhere to state law.โ Thompson v. \n26 Alabama, No. 2:16-CV-783-WKW, 2017 WL 3223915, at *8 (M.D. Ala. July 28, 2017); see also \nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 106โ07 (1984); Neuwirth v. La. State \n27 Bd. of Dentistry, 845 F.2d 553, 557 (5th Cir. 1988). That is precisely the sort of relief that \nPlaintiffs seek from this Court. See Am. Compl. at 25โ26. \n28\n5 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 71   Filed 05/19/20   Page 6 of 16\n \n1 ยถยถ 97โ102. Appended to this old assertion is the novel claim that the mailing of ballots will lead \n2 to disenfranchisement. See id. ยถ 105. Plaintiffs, however, never connect these two contentions. \n3 And they certainly provide no allegations that give rise to a plausible claim that Defendantsโ \n4 decision to proactively mail ballots to voters will lead to disenfranchisement or any other injury. \n5 All Plaintiffs are left with, then, is their previous assertion that they have a right to seek \n6 enforcement of their incorrect reading of Nevada lawโa claim that this Court has already \n7 rejected. See Order at 14โ20. Accordingly, Count I fails on both standing and Rule 12(b)(6) \n8 grounds. \n9 A.  Plaintiffs lack standing to assert Count I. \n10   To be sure, disenfranchisement, or the serious risk thereof, is an injury-in-fact cognizable \n11 under  Article  III.  But  alleging  a  cognizable  injury  without  connecting  that  injury  to  the \n12 challenged  conduct  fails  to  establish  standing.  Instead,  โthere  must  be  a  causal  connection \n13 between the injury and the conduct complained ofโthe injury has to be โfairly . . . trace[able] to \n14 the challenged action of the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the independent action of \n15 some third party not before the court.โ Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560โ61 (alterations in original) \n16 (quoting Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 41โ42 (1976)).  \n17   Plaintiffs  have  not  connected  the  conduct  they  challengeโDefendantsโ  decision  to \n18 proactively mail ballots to voters in purported violation of Nevada lawโwith the injury they \n19 assertโdisenfranchisement. Cf. Order at 10 n. 7 (โEven if the Court had concluded [] that there \n20 was a violation of Nevada law in the implementation of the all-mail provisions of the Plan, . . . \n21 Plaintiffs have not established a nexus between such alleged violations and the alleged injury of \n22 vote  dilution.โ).  As  an  initial  matter,  Plaintiffs  have  not  articulated  why  the  decision  to \n23 proactively mail ballots to voters is more likely to result in disenfranchisement simply because it \n24 isโallegedlyโagainst the law. Instead, they merely take this conclusion for granted, despite the \n25 absence of a plausible, logical explanation. See Am. Compl. ยถ 107 (โDue to this widespread \n26 disenfranchisement caused by not abiding by the legislatureโs law, the Plans violates the right to \n27 vote by direct disenfranchisement.โ). Nor have Plaintiffs otherwise explained how exactly the \n28 proactive  mailing  of  ballots,  whether  countenanced  by  state  law  or  not,  will  result  in \n6 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 71   Filed 05/19/20   Page 7 of 16\n \n1 disenfranchisementโparticularly  in  comparison  to  their  preferred  method  of  voting,  absent \n2 ballots.  Indeed,  Defendantsโ  decision  to  mail  ballots  to  voters  without  first  requiring  the \n3 submission and processing of absent ballot applications will almost certainly result in more \n4 voting, not less. See Order at 14 (โ[I]f the Plan is not implemented voters worried about risks to \n5 their health or unsure about how to obtain an absentee ballot may very well be discouraged from \n6 exercising the right to vote all together.โ); cf. Am. Compl. ยถยถ 85, 89โ90 (describing Wisconsinโs \n7 inability to process the surge in absentee ballot requests caused by the pandemic). \n8   Accordingly, Plaintiffsโ amended complaint, like their initial complaint, falls well short \n9 of establishing the necessary traceability and redressability needed to establish standing for \n10 Count  I.  Because  they  have  failed  to  establish  standing  for  this  claim,  Count  I  should  be \n11 dismissed. \n12\nB.  Count I fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because the \nU.S. Constitution is not a vehicle to enforce state election laws. \n13\n14   Plaintiffsโ failure to connect Defendantsโ purported violation of state law with any injury \n15 to or interference with their ability to vote also dooms Count I under Rule 12(b)(6). See Iqbal, \n16 556 U.S. at 678 (โRule 8 . . . demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-\n17 harmed-me accusation.โ). Without alleging any nexus between the challenged policy and an \n18 alleged burden on the right to vote, Count Iโlike its predecessor, Count II in Plaintiffsโ initial \n19 complaint, see Compl. ยถยถ 45โ49โcontinues to do nothing more than assert the right to have \n20 Plaintiffsโ incorrect reading of Nevada law enforced. But โ[t]he Constitution is not an election \n21 fraud statute.โ Minn. Voters All. v. Ritchie, 720 F.3d 1029, 1031 (8th Cir. 2013) (quoting Bodine \n22 v. Elkhart Cty. Election Bd., 788 F.2d 1270, 1271 (7th Cir. 1986)) (affirming Rule 12(b)(6) \n23 dismissal of vote dilution claim). And the allegations in the amended complaint do not give rise \n24 to a plausible claim that Defendantsโ decision to mail ballots to Nevada votersโthe only policy \n25 at issue in this case, see Order at 1 n. 1โprevents Plaintiffs from casting ballots or otherwise \n26 burdens their right to vote. \n27   Plaintiffsโ efforts to enforce Nevada law through Count I (as well as Count II) ignore that \n28 federal  voting  rights  cases  permit  plaintiffs  to  bring  suit  in  federal  court  under  two \n7 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 71   Filed 05/19/20   Page 8 of 16\n \n1 circumstances: (1) where the defendantsโ actions violate a federal statute, see, e.g., Sanchez v. \n2 Cegavske, 214 F. Supp. 3d 961, 965โ66 (D. Nev. 2016), or (2) where the defendants are applying \n3 state elections law in a manner that violates the federal constitution, see, e.g., PEST Comm. v. \n4 Miller, 648 F. Supp. 2d 1202, 1214โ15 (D. Nev. 2009). There is no precedent for a federal court \n5 to grant relief under the U.S. Constitution to voters who simply contend, as Plaintiffs here do, \n6 that state election officials are acting in contravention of state law. In four filingsโthe initial \n7 complaint, the first motion for a preliminary injunction, the amended complaint, and the second \n8 motion for a preliminary injunctionโPlaintiffs have not identified a single case that allows them \n9 to seek this relief. Because the U.S. Constitution does not provide the right that Plaintiffs seek to \n10 vindicate in Count I, it fails to state a claim under a cognizable legal theory, and dismissal of that \n11 claim is therefore appropriate. See Parents for Privacy v. Barr, 949 F.3d 1210, 1226 (9th Cir. \n12 2020) (affirming dismissal with prejudice where claim was โpremised on the violation of an \n13 asserted right that, as a matter of law, is not protected byโ the U.S. Constitution). \n14\nC.  Count I fails as a matter of law because it rests on an incorrect interpretation \nof Nevadaโs election laws. \n15\n16   Lastly, Count Iโlike all of Plaintiffsโ claims premised on alleged violations of Nevada \n17 lawโfails as a matter of law because, as this Court has already held, Defendantsโ decision to \n18 mail ballots to registered voters in Nevada is explicitly countenanced by Nevada statute. See \n19 Order at 16โ20. Through the laws governing mailing precinctsโspecifically, Nevada Revised \n20 Statutes (โN.R.S.โ) 293.343 through 293.355โthe Nevada Legislature has given the Secretary \n21 and the county clerks authority to mail ballots to all registered voters, rather than requiring voters \n22 to request those ballots through the absent ballot process. The documents attached to Plaintiffsโ \n23 amended complaint confirm that Defendants have followed these procedures. Compare Am. \n24 Compl., Exs. CโH, with N.R.S. 293.213(4)โ(5). Plaintiffsโ claim instead hinges on a labored \n25 reading of different statutes, N.R.S. 293.205 and 293.206, which, as this Court has already held, \n26 govern only the physical boundaries of precincts and not the manner of elections conducted \n27 therein. See Order at 17โ18; see also N.R.S. 293.205(2) (โThe boundaries of each election \n28 precinct must follow visible ground features.โ); N.R.S. 293.205(3) (โElection precincts must be \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 71   Filed 05/19/20   Page 9 of 16\n \n1 composed only of contiguous territory.โ); N.R.S. 293.206(1) (governing submission of maps \n2 โshowing the boundariesโ of election precincts). Even if N.R.S. 293.205 were applicable to the \n3 manner of conducting elections within a precinct, it explicitly imports another statute, N.R.S. \n4 293.208, which allows a new precinct to be created โat any time if it lies entirely within the \n5 boundaries of any existing precinct.โ N.R.S. 293.208(3). Because each existing precinct has been \n6 converted to a mailing precinct for the June Primary without any further change, the now-\n7 designated mailing precincts share overlapping boundaries with, and therefore lie entirely within, \n8 the existing precincts.  \n9   As this Court has previously concluded, Count I (like Counts II and III) rests on an \n10 interpretation of state law that is wrong as a matter of law. Because it fails to state a claim upon \n11 which relief can be granted for this and other reasons, and because Plaintiffs lack standing to \n12 assert it, Count I must be dismissed. See Iqbal, 556 at 678; Ditech Fin. LLC v. Res. Grp. LLC, \n13 398 F. Supp. 3d 801, 803 (D. Nev. 2019) (granting motion to dismiss where plaintiffโs legal \n14 theory โfail[ed] as a matter of lawโ), appeal docketed, No. 19-16427 (9th Cir. July 19, 2019). \n15\nII.  Count II should be dismissed for lack of standing and for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief can be granted. \n16\n17   Count IIโwhich alleges that a predominantly vote by mail election will dilute the value \n18 of  Plaintiffsโ  votes  in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments,  see Am. Compl. \n19 ยถยถ 108โ16โis virtually identical to Count I of Plaintiffsโ original complaint. Compare id., with \n20 Compl. ยถยถ 36โ44. This Court has already correctly rejected this claim on both standing grounds \n21 and the merits. See Order at 8โ9, 11โ14. The allegations in the amended complaint have not \n22 remedied this claimโs fundamental flaws, and dismissal is therefore warranted. \n23 A.  Plaintiffs lack standing to bring Count II. \n24   Plaintiffs, new and old alike, continue to assert an interest in having Nevadaโs election \n25 laws enforced based on their statuses as registered voters, and suggest that Defendantsโ purported \n26 failure to enforce Nevadaโs laws in the manner Plaintiffs see fit could lead to an increase in \n27 illegal votes harmful to lawful voters. But as this Court has already held, that interest represents \n28 no more than a generalized grievance that is insufficient for Article III purposes. See Order at 9 \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 71   Filed 05/19/20   Page 10 of 16\n \n1 (โPlaintiffsโ purported injury of having their votes diluted due to ostensible election fraud may be \n2 conceivably raised by any Nevada voter. Such claimed injury therefore does not satisfy the \n3 requirement that Plaintiffs must state a concrete and particularized injury.โ); see also Lujan, 504 \n4 U.S. at 573โ76 (โ[A]n injury amounting only to the alleged violation of a right to have the \n5 Government act in accordance with law [is] not judicially cognizableโ and โcannot alone satisfy \n6 the requirements of Art. III without draining those requirements of meaning.โ (quoting Allen v. \n7 Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 754 (1984))); cf. United States v. Florida, No. 4:12cv285-RH/CAS, 2012 \n8 WL 13034013, at *1 (N.D. Fla. Nov. 6, 2012) (rejecting True the Voteโs motion to intervene \n9 under Rule 24 based on the same theory of vote dilution because its โasserted interests are the \n10 same . . . as for every other registered voter in the stateโ). Moreover, Plaintiffsโ purported injury \n11 is wholly conjectural, see Order at 9, and such speculative injuries do not confer Article III \n12 standing. See Am. Civil Rights Union v. Martinez-Rivera, 166 F. Supp. 3d 779, 789 (W.D. Tex. \n13 2015) (โ[T]he risk of vote dilution[ is] speculative and, as such, [is] more akin to a generalized \n14 grievance about the government than an injury in fact.โ). \n15   In short, as the Court previously concluded, Plaintiffs do not have standing to bring this \n16 claim. Count II should therefore be dismissed. \n17\nB.  Count II fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because vote \ndilution by illegal voting is not a viable legal theory. \n18\n19   Count II fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because it is not premised \n20 on  a  cognizable  legal  theory.  See  Newlands  Asset  Holding  Tr.,  2017  WL  5559956,  at  *2 \n21 (dismissal appropriate where claim lacks โa cognizable legal theoryโ (quoting Balistreri, 901 \n22 F.2d at 699)). To begin, Count II, like its predecessor, continues to ask this Court to enforce the \n23 Nevada Legislatureโs election policies. See Am. Compl. ยถยถ 113, 116; see also id. at 25โ26. But \n24 the U.S. Constitution is not a vehicle to enforce state election laws. See Part I.B supra. And even \n25 if it were, Defendantsโ plans are consistent with state law. See Part I.C supra; Order at 16โ20. \n26   Moreover, federal courts do not recognize a cause of action under the theory that illegal \n27 voting will cause vote dilution as asserted in Count II. While it is true that vote dilution is a \n28 viable basis for federal claims in certain contexts, such as when laws are crafted that structurally \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 71   Filed 05/19/20   Page 11 of 16\n \n1 devalue one communityโs votes over anotherโs, see, e.g., Republican Party of Pa. v. Cortรฉs, 218 \n2 F. Supp. 3d 396, 406โ07 (E.D. Pa. 2016); see also Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 568 (1964) \n3 (โSimply stated, an individualโs right to vote for state legislators is unconstitutionally impaired \n4 when its weight is in a substantial fashion diluted when compared with votes of citizens living on \n5 other parts of the State.โ), in these cases, plaintiffs allege that their votes are devalued as \n6 compared to similarly situated voters in other parts of the state. See Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 567โ\n7 68. Plaintiffs here, by contrast, have not alleged that Defendantsโ plan to mail ballots values \n8 some other group of votes over their own. Nor does their complaint give rise to the plausible \n9 claim that they belong to a group of voters that will be disparately impacted by a supposed surge \n10 in illegal voting. Accordingly, they have failed at the most basic step of pleading an equal \n11 protection claim.  \n12   Nor have Plaintiffs cited any authority for taking vote dilution out of the equal protection \n13 context and transforming it into a weapon that voters may use to enlist the federal judiciary to \n14 make it more difficult for their fellow citizens to vote. Cf. Short v. Brown, 893 F.3d 671, 677โ78 \n15 (9th Cir. 2018) (โNor have the appellants cited any authority explaining how a law that makes it \n16 easier to vote would violate the Constitution.โ). To the contrary, courts have routinelyโand \n17 appropriatelyโrejected such efforts. See Minn. Voters All., 720 F.3d at 1031โ32 (affirming Rule \n18 12(b)(6)  dismissal  of  vote  dilution  claim);  see  also  Cortรฉs,  218  F.  Supp.  3d  406,  406โ07 \n19 (rejecting claim of vote dilution by illegal voting on motion for preliminary injunction). Because \n20 Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts that give rise to a plausible claim for relief, or even alleged a \n21 cognizable legal theory, dismissal of Count II is appropriate.   \n22\nIII.  Count III should be dismissed for lack of standing and for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief can be granted. \n23\n24   Count III, which is identical to a claim in Plaintiffsโ original complaint that this Court has \n25 already  rejected,  see  Order  at  20,  invokes  the  U.S.  Constitutionโs  Elections  Clause,  which \n26 provides  that  โ[t]he  Times,  Places  and  Manner  of  holding  Elections  for  Senators  and \n27 Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof.โ U.S. Const., art. I, \n28 ยง 4, cl. 1; see also Am. Compl. ยถยถ 117โ22. But significantlyโand fatallyโPlaintiffs do not and \n11 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 71   Filed 05/19/20   Page 12 of 16\n \n1 cannot produce any authority establishing a private right of action under this clause. Cf. U.S. \n2 House of Representatives v. Burwell, 130 F. Supp. 3d 53, 78 (D.D.C. 2015) (noting private \n3 citizens generally lack power to โdeputiz[e] themselves in an effort to enforce federal lawโ). \n4 Indeed, courts have rejected similar efforts to assert private rights to enforce structuralโas \n5 opposed to rights-focusedโconstitutional provisions. See, e.g., Largess v. Supreme Judicial \n6 Court, 373 F.3d 219, 228 & n. 9 (1st Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (affirming denial of injunctive relief \n7 where โindividuals . . . attempt[ed] to invoke the Guarantee Clause against state officialsโ).  \n8   Count III also suffers the same flaws as Count II. Plaintiffsโ asserted injury for both is the \n9 sameโan alleged violation of Nevada laws that will lead to an increase in illegal votingโand as \n10 this Court has already held, that injury is neither concrete and particularized nor actual or \n11 imminent. See Order at 8โ9. Similarly, Count III shares the flawed, central contention of Counts \n12 I and II that Defendants are violating Nevada law by mailing ballots to voters. See Part I.C supra. \n13   Because Plaintiffs do not have standing to assert Count III, the Elections Clause does not \n14 create a private right of action to enforce state law, and the claim rests on an incorrect reading of \n15 Nevada statute, Count III should be dismissed. \n16\nIV.  Count IV should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be \ngranted. \n17\n18   Finally, Count IV challenges two of Clark Countyโs recently announced revisions to its \n19 plan for the June Primaryโnamely, the decisions to mail ballots to both active and inactive \n20 voters and to appoint field registrars to collect ballots from individuals for whom returning \n21 ballots by mail is difficult. See Am. Compl. ยถยถ 123โ28; see also id., Ex. P. Plaintiffs reason that \n22 Clark County voters will have an easier time voting, and will therefore vote in higher numbers \n23 than voters who live in counties that are not taking these steps. See id. ยถ 126. Intervenor-\n24 Defendants agree that these recently announced revisions will expand access to the franchise for \n25 Clark County voters; that is why they have brought a lawsuit in state court to ensure these types \n26 of protections are in place in every Nevada county. Confoundingly, though, Plaintiffs do not ask \n27 this Court to order the Washoe Registrar and other county officials to similarly mail ballots to \n28 inactive voters and appoint field registrars to assist voters statewide. Instead, Plaintiffs seek an \n12 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 71   Filed 05/19/20   Page 13 of 16\n \n1 order from this Court preventing Clark County from helping its voters cast ballots by prohibiting \n2 these recently announced revisions. Id. at 25โ26. \n3   Plaintiffsโ attempt to reduce access to the ballot for Clark County voters is squarely \n4 foreclosed by the Ninth Circuitโs opinion in Short v. Brown. In Short, the plaintiffs alleged that \n5 Californiaโs  Voterโs  Choice  Act  (โVCAโ)  violated  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  because  it \n6 permitted voters in some counties to receive a mail ballot automatically, while voters in other \n7 counties had to apply for a mail ballot. 893 F.3d at 677โ79. The plaintiffs contended that the \n8 VCA  โinequitably  โdilutesโ  votes  in  โdisfavoredโ  counties.โ  Id.  at  677.  The  Ninth  Circuit \n9 affirmed the district courtโs denial of a preliminary injunction because the plaintiffs had โnot \n10 even allegedโlet alone introduced evidence to demonstrateโthat the VCA [would] prevent \n11 anyone from voting.โ Id. Significantly, in Short, the Ninth Circuit rejected the premise that the \n12 U.S. Constitution prohibits states from making it easier to vote, or that the vote dilution line of \n13 cases  applies  to  challenges,  like  this  one,  where  a  state  has  not  allocated  representation \n14 differently among voters. Id. at 677โ78. So too here. Plaintiffs have not alleged any facts that \n15 give rise to the plausible claim that Clark Countyโs plans to mail ballots to inactive voters and \n16 appoint field registrars will make it harder for anyone to vote, let alone themselves. And they \n17 have not, in any of their pleadings, cited authority for the proposition that the U.S. Constitution \n18 somehow prohibits election officialsโ earnest efforts to make it easier to vote. \n19   Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000) (per curiam), does not save Plaintiffsโ claim. In the \n20 immediate  aftermath  of  the  disputed  2000  presidential  election,  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court \n21 concluded that the manual recount ordered by the Florida Supreme Court, which did not provide \n22 consistent  standards  and  โminimal  procedural  safeguards,โ  offended  the  Equal  Protection \n23 Clauseโs requirement of non-arbitrary treatment of voters. Id. at 108โ09. Here, by significant \n24 contrast, Plaintiffs have not alleged that their ballotsโor anyone elseโsโwill be arbitrarily \n25 rejected. \n26   Because Count IV is squarely foreclosed by controlling Ninth Circuit precedent, it fails to \n27 allege a claim upon which relief can be granted. Accordingly, dismissal is warranted. See Conant \n28 v. Brown, 248 F. Supp. 3d 1014, 1024โ25 (D. Or. 2017) (granting motion to dismiss where \n13 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 71   Filed 05/19/20   Page 14 of 16\n \n1 plaintiffโs arguments were โforeclosed by . . . precedentโ); see also Newlands Asset Holding Tr., \n2 2017 WL 5559956, at *2.4 \n3 V.  Dismissal should be with prejudice. \n4   โ[D]ismissal with prejudice is warranted [where] amendment would be futile.โ Carter v. \n5 Sables, LLC, No. 3:17-cv-00594-MMD-WGC, 2017 WL 6328157, at *2 (D. Nev. Dec. 11, \n6 2017); see also United States v. Gila Valley Irrigation Dist., 859 F.3d 789, 804 (9th Cir. 2017) \n7 (leave to amend should not be granted where โamendment would cause prejudice to the opposing \n8 party, is sought in bad faith, is futile, or creates undue delayโ (quoting Madeja v. Olympic \n9 Packers, LLC, 310 F.3d 628, 636 (9th Cir. 2002)). \n10   Here, any amendment Plaintiffs might pursue to salvage their claims would be futile. \n11 Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their speculative and generalized claimsโa fatal deficiency that, \n12 having amended once, they have not cured despite receiving this Courtโs previous ruling on the \n13 issue. There is no indication that Plaintiffs could conceivably add a plaintiff who would remedy \n14 this ongoing flaw. Moreover, Plaintiffsโ claims are based on incorrect interpretations of Nevada \n15 law, and rely on legal theories that are either improper or beyond the scope of the constitutional \n16 provisions on which they rely. For all these reasons, further amendment would be futile. See \n17 Parents for Privacy, 949 F.3d at 1226 (affirming dismissal of claim with prejudice where claim \n18 was โpremised on the violation of an asserted right that, as a matter of law, is not protectedโ by \n19 the U.S. Constitution). \n20   Finally, granting leave to amend would create prejudice and undue delay. Plaintiffs \n21 already  delayed  in  filing  their  amended  complaint  and  second  motion  for  a  preliminary \n22 injunction. Now, the June Primary is less than three weeks away. There is simply insufficient \n23 time  for  Plaintiffs  to  file,  and  this  Court  to  adjudicate,  a  second  amended  complaint. \n                                                 \n24\n25 4   Plaintiffs also suggest that Clark Countyโs plan violates Nevada election laws. See Am. \nCompl. ยถ 126. This is not so. N.R.S. 293.345(1) requires county election officials to mail a ballot \n26 to โeach registered voterโ in all mailing precinctsโin other words, active and inactive voters \nalike. And Nevada law explicitly allows county officials to โappoint at least one registered voter \n27 to serve as a field registrar of voters.โ N.R.S. 293.505(2). These field registrars are empowered \nto โperform such duties as the county clerk may direct,โ id., including the collection of ballots. \n28\n14 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 71   Filed 05/19/20   Page 15 of 16\n \n1 Accordingly, this Court should dismiss Plaintiffsโ amended complaint with prejudice. \n2 CONCLUSION \n3 For the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant Intervenor-Defendantsโ motion to \n4 dismiss Plaintiffsโ amended complaint with prejudice. \n5   DATED this 19th day of May, 2020. \n6  \n7   WOLF, RIFKIN, SHAPIRO, \nSCHULMAN & RABKIN,LLP \n8  \n  By: /s/ Bradley S.

Nevada Secretary of State (โSecretaryโ) and Nevada county clerks and registrars of voters\n28\n1\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 64   Filed 05/13/20   Page 2 of 38\n1 (โCounty Administratorsโ) intend to conduct the June 9, 2020, Nevada state and federal primary\n2 election under the โall-mail electionโ plan (โState Planโ) on the Secretaryโs website. Under the\n3 State Plan, the Secretary and County Administrators intend to mail unrequested absentee ballots\n4 (herein โmail-in ballotsโ) to active registered voters only: โAll active registered voters in Nevada\n5 will be mailed an absentee ballot[1] for the primary election. No action or steps, such as submit-\n6 ting an absentee ballot request application, will be required by individual voters in order to re-\n7 ceive a ballot in the mail.โ(Nevada Secretary of State ~ Absent Voting, attached as Ex. K.)\n8 Qualified voters who are not โactiveโ must apply for one: โAny registered voter may request to\n9 vote by mail. To request an absent ballot, you must complete and submit an Absent Ballot Re-\n10 quest Form to the County Clerk/Registrar of Voters in the county where you are registered to\n11 vote.โ Ex. K. This mail-in-ballot State Plan is not the Legislatureโs prescribed manner.\n12 2.  Under the Clark County Plan, Clark County gives voters advantages over other-county\n13 voters, including by (i) sending absent ballots to inactive voters and, as reported, โallow a biparti-\n14 san group of deputized โfield registrarsโ to collect sealed ballots from voters.โ (ii) creating more\n15 vote centers than other Nevada counties.2\n16 3.  The State Plan strips vote-fraud-prevention safeguards established by the Legislature,\n17 which allows illegal voting that violates Votersโ right to vote by dilution. Among other constitu-\n18 tional flaws, the State Plan is not what the Legislature chose as required, U.S. Const. art I, ยง 4, cl.\n19 1, so it may not be used where as here federal candidates are on the ballot. See\n20 https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/home/showdocument?id=8461 (Nevada Secretary of State, โ2020\n21\n22\n1 The Secretary uses โabsentee ballotโ synonymously with the Nevada term โabsent bal-\n23\nlot,โ Nevada Revised Statutes (โNRSโ) 293.013. (Secretary Cegavske Announces Plan to Con-\nduct June 9, 2020 Primary Election by All Mail, attached as Ex. J.) But because the ballots are\n24\nnot sent per the legislatively required absent-ballot request procedure, they are actually like the \n25 mail-in ballots sent in statutory all-mail-voting plans, such as used in California.\n26\n2 Rory Appleton, New Clark County election plan decision shrouded in mystery, Law Ve-\ngas Review-Journal, (May 6, 2020),\n27\nhttps://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/clark-county/new-clark-county-el\n28 ection-plan-decision-shrouded-in-mystery-2022735/.

The State Plan violates Votersโ (i) right to vote under the U.S. Constitution due to direct\n3 disenfranchisement, (ii) right to vote under the U.S. Constitution due to vote dilution, (ii) right to\n4 vote in a federal election compliant with the U.S. Constitution at Article I, ยง 4, cl. 1, and (iv), as\n5 to Clark County Defendants, the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n6 Jurisdiction and Venue\n7 5.

Sections 2201 and 2202. \n13 7.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C.

Voters will mark their ballot at home โand then return it by mail using a postage-prepaid\n5 envelope or by dropping it off in person at a designated county location.โ Id.\n6 24. Voters are reminded that mail-in ballots must be dropped off in person by the close of\n7 polls on Election Day, or postmarked by Election Day. Id.\n8 25.  Ballots that are postmarked by Election Day and received no later than seven days after\n9 the election will be counted.  Additionally, if a voter fails to sign the ballot return envelope or the\n10 voterโs signature does not match the one on file with the county election official, the voter will be\n11 contacted, and the voter will have up to the seventh day after the election to make the necessary\n12 correction.  It is important to understand that these statutory deadlines will result in updating vote\n13 totals and election results for up to seven days after the election. Id.\n14 26.

The Washoe County Registrar claims that โthe actual designation by my office of the mail\n11 precincts occurred on April 20, 2020.โ ECF No. 50 at ยถ 4. Plaintiffs have requested a copy of this\n12 โactual designation,โ but the notice was first published on April 8, so the โactual designationโ\n13 was before expiration of the 14 day prior notice period required by NRS 293.213(5), i.e., April\n14 22. Under the statutory deadlines, this needed to be done by March 18. NRS 293.205(1).\n15 32. Plaintiffs have also requested a copy of any subsequent notice to the Secretary and Legis-\n16 lative Counsel of this actual designation on April 20 as required by NRC 293.206.

But this notice was first published on April 2 before the 14 day\n11 prior notice period required by NRS 293.213(5) began, since that notice, (ex. H), wasnโt pub-\n12 lished until April 9. Under the statutory deadlines, this needed to be done on or before March 18.\n13 205(1).\n14 38. Plaintiffs have also requested a copy of any subsequent notice to the Secretary and Legis-\n15 lative Counsel of this actual designation of the mailing precincts, as required by NRS 293.206.\n16 The statutory deadline was March 31. NRS 293.206.\n17 39. On May 4, 2020, by court filing, Clark County announced its election plan (โClark\n18 County Planโ). For the June 9 primary election, Clark County is setting up two additional elec-\n19 tion day voting sites and will mail absent ballots to all registered voters, including inactive vot-\n20 ers, at additional expense.

The Clark County voter turn out for a primary election in an even year is low. The turnout\n19 is generally between 15.80-20.41% of registered voters. Id.\n20 Nevada Election Law\n21 48.  The Nevada Legislature has enacted detailed legislation governing how elections are to\n22 be conducted in NRS Title 24, Chapter 293 (titled โElections).3\n23 49. Chapter 293 requires the Secretary to enact implementing regulations, but ยง 247 limits\n24 that to when a regulation (i) is consistent with legislation and (ii) in place by the last business day\n25 of February before the primary:\n26 The Secretary of State shall adopt regulations, not inconsistent with the election laws of this\n27\n28 3 Available at https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-293.html.\n9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 64   Filed 05/13/20   Page 10 of 38\n1 State, for the conduct of primary, general, special and district elections in all cities and\ncounties. Permanent regulations of the Secretary of State that regulate the conduct of a\n2 primary, general, special or district election and are effective on or before the last business\nday of February immediately preceding a primary, general, special or district election govern\n3 the conduct of that election.\n4 NRS 293.247 (emphasis added). \n5 50. The law mandates that county clerks โshall establish election precinctsโ4 โon or before the\n6 third Wednesday in March of every even-numbered year.โ NRS 293.205. Although county clerks\n7 may establish โmailing precinctsโ (where all ballots are mailed, with certain exceptions) under\n8 certain guidelines, NRS 293.343, those like all precincts had to be established by March 18 under\n9 NRS 293.205. \n10 51. Moreover, โon or before the last day in March of every even-numbered year, the county\n11 clerk shall provide the Secretary of State and the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau with\n12 a copy or electronic file of a map showing the boundaries of all election precincts in the county,โ\n13 NRS 293.206, and this was apparently not done given the substitution of the State Plan. \n14 52. The law requires that clerks establish and the Secretary approve maps of precincts,\n15 293.205 and .206, indicates the Legislatureโs intent for such precincts for in-person voting, not\n16 that the whole election be subsumed under an exception allowing mailing districts in certain cir-\n17 cumstances, e.g., โwhenever there were not more than 20 voters registered in a precinct for the\n18 last preceding general election, the county clerk may establish that precinct as a mailing pre-\n19 cinct,โ NRS 293.213(1).\n20 53. And to create new mailing precincts, the legislature provided legal requirements for โes-\n21 tablishingโ or โdesignatingโ such a precinct: \n22 1) The deadline to โestablish[] election precinctsโ and โdesignate precinctsโ is โby on or\n23 before the third Wednesday in March of every even-numbered yearโโMarch 18, 2020.\n24 NRS 293.205(1). \n25 2) Notice must be โposted in the manner prescribed for a regular meeting of the board of\n26\n27\n4 โ[S]tatutes . . . that employ the term โshallโ are presumptively mandatory.โ Nev.

NRS 293.213 (5). \n4 3) Prior approval from the Secretary to โestablish a mailing precinctโ must be obtained\n5 before the notices required by NRS 293.213(5)(a) and (b) are sent outโbefore March 4,\n6 2020. NRS 293.213(4). \n7 4) The county clerk shall notify the Secretary and Legislative Counsel of boundaries of all\n8 election precincts by March 31, 206, after they are established and designated. ยง 205(1). It\n9 is unknown if or when the Washoe Registrar did this a second time after redesignating all\n10 precincts as mailing precincts. \n11 5) Section 343 et seq. establishes the procedures for mailing precincts, โwhenever the\n12 county clerk has designated a precinct as a mailing precinct.โ NRS 293.343(2)\n13 54. The intent of the Legislature to have regular in-person voting and absentee procedures as\n14 the controlling model, with certain exceptions, is evidenced throughout Chapter 293 in its provi-\n15 sions for regular voting. The State Plan is not the Legislatureโs prescribed manner.\n16 55. Where mailing precincts are created, โcounty clerk[s] shall, at least 14 days before estab-\n17 lishing or designating a precinct as a mailing precinct . . . cause notice of such action to be: (a)\n18 Posted [as prescribed] . . . ; and (b) Mailed to each Assemblyman, [etc. as prescribed]. Id.\n19 56. NRS 293.3568 requires provision for early in-person voting at permanent polling places,\n20 but the Clark County Registrar of Votersโ doesnโt identify locations for doing that. (Ex. I.)  The\n21 Secretary and County Administrators have apparently determined that ยง 3568 is no longer appli-\n22 cable and that โ[i]f a request is made to vote early by a registered voter in person, the election\n23 board shall issue a ballot for early voting to the voter,โ NRS 293.356, they need not comply. That\n24 โballot must be voted on the premises of a polling place,โ id., but in this case, the Registrar has\n25 decided to circumvent the Legislature and only provide a mail ballot drop-off location and not a\n26 permanent or temporary location to request a ballot and have it voted there.\n27 57. โEach county clerk shall establish and maintain a computerized database of registered\n28 voters in the county that is compatible with the statewide voter registration list and meets such\n11\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 64   Filed 05/13/20   Page 12 of 38\n1 technical requirements as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State.โ NAC 293.454(1).\n2 58. County Clerks have the authority to correct statewide voter registration lists to determine\n3 whether residence is accurate and make investigations of registration. NRS 293.530.\n4 Inactive Voter List\n5 59. An voter is considered โactiveโ if the residential address of the registered voter is current.\n6 Id. at (1)(c)(2)(a). A voter is considered โInactiveโ if the registered voter failed to return a post-\n7 card mailed pursuant to NRS 293.530.\n8 60.  Pursuant to NAC 293.412(1)(a), โ[a] county clerk shall: Maintain a separate list of inac-\n9 tive voters or designate inactive voters as such on regular lists of registered voters and election\n10 board registers.โ \n11 61. A voter is deemed inactive โif the registered voter failed to return a postcard mailed pur-\n12 suant to subsection 3 of NRS 293.530.โ NAC 293.454(2)(e). Additionally, Nevada law defines\n13 an inactive voter as a voter designated as inactive pursuant to NRS 293.530 whose registration\n14 has not been cancelled.โ NAC 293/412(6).\n15 62. But, an inactive voter may only vote in person at a polling place and not be absent ballot.\n16 NAC 293.412(5).\n17 63. A county clerk may only cancel a voterโs registration if: \n18  1) The county clerk mails a written notice to the voter which the United States Postal\n19 Service is required to forward;\n20 2) The county clerk mails a return postcard with the notice which has a place for the voter\n21 to write his or her new address, is addressed to the county clerk and has postage guaran-\n22 teed;\n23 3) The voter does not respond; and\n24 4) The voter does not appear to vote in an election before the polls have closed in the sec-\n25 ond general election following the date of the notice.\n26 NRS 293.530.\n27 Anti-Vote-Fraud Safeguards\n28 64. Nevada requires that โa person who registered by mail or computer shall, for the first\n12\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 64   Filed 05/13/20   Page 13 of 38\n1 election in which the person votes at which that registration is valid, vote in person unless he or\n2 she has previously voted in the county in which he or she is registered to vote.โ NRS 293.272(1).\n3 And an individual who registers at the Department of Motor vehicles, by mail, or by computer\n4 must present valid identification and a document establishing residence. NRS.293.2725.5\n5 65. For all in-person voters whose name appears on the roster of registered voters (or they\n6 provide an affirmation that they are entitled to vote), the voter โstate his or her name to the elec-\n7 tion board officer in charge of the roster,โ who โshall . . . [a]nnounce the name of the registered\n8 voter,โ require a signature and then authenticate it or resolve any discrepancy. NRS 293.285. The\n9 voter โmust sign his or her name in the roster or on a signature card when he or she applies to\n10 vote.โ NRS.293.277(1). This is all done before witnesses who may know the person, but in any\n11 case can watch the personโs demeanor and can see if the person is trying to duplicate a signature\n12 from an exemplar or produces the signature spontaneously. There are some exceptions, but those\n13 are the general rules, and they allow local poll workers and watchers to monitor who is voting\n14 and deny voting and issue challenges if appropriateโas does in-person voting in general. \n15 66. The signature is then compared by an election board officer with the signature on file or\n16 on approved identification cards, such as a driverโs license. Id. at (1)-(2). Records are checked to\n17 assure the voter has not already voted. Id. at (3). The law provides that any person who votes\n18 knowing he or she is not qualified commits a Class D felony, as does one attempting to vote in\n19 the name of another. NRS 293.775. The same penalty applies to those voting more than once in\n20 the same election. NRS 293.780\n21 67. Nevada requires the safeguard that a voter must request the ballot: โExcept as provided in\n22 NRS 293.272 and 293.502, a registered voter may request an absent ballot if, before 5 p.m. on\n23 the 14th calendar day preceding the election, the registered voter; (a) Provides sufficient written\n24 notice to the county clerk; and (b) Has identified himself or herself to the satisfaction of the\n25 county clerk.โ NRS 293.313. \n26\n5 Likewise, where mail voting has been authorized by law, individuals could only vote by\n27\nmail if they provide the county clerk the same information required at the polling location. NRS\n28 293.2725(1)(b)(1)-(2).\n13\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 64   Filed 05/13/20   Page 14 of 38\n1 68. The Nevada Administrative Code provides that, โA clerk that receives a request for an\n2 absent ballot shall: (1) Compare the address of the voterโs residence in this State which is indi-\n3 cated on the request with the address which is indicated on the voterโs application to register to\n4 vote.โ NAC 293.295. 293.295. If the address is different on the voter registration and absent bal-\n5 lot applications, the court will send a written notice including: โ(a) A copy and explanation of the\n6 provisions set forth in NRS 293.525; and (b) A postcard to be returned by the voter to the county\n7 clerk which includes verification of the address of the voterโs residence in this State.  The county\n8 clerk shall use a postcard that may not be forwarded to an address of the voter which is different\n9 from the address to which the notice is mailed.โ NAC 293.295(2). \n10 69. The safeguards in place when a registered voter moved โfrom one precinct to another or\n11 from one congressional district to another within the same countyโ require that the registered\n12 voter โmust be allowed to vote in the precinct where the elector previously residedโ but only after\n13 โproviding an oral or written affirmation before an election board officer attesting to his or her\n14 new address.โ NRS 293.525. Even if the registered voter moved within the same precinct, that\n15 elector must only be โallowed to vote after providing an oral or written affirmation before an\n16 election board officer attesting to his or her new address.โ Id.\n17 Covid-19\n18 70.

Id.\n3 91. In existing all-mail voting states, a large number of mailed ballots does not present as\n4 much of an issue because they have the required equipment to process them. Id. However, other\n5 states lack the necessary infrastructure and equipment to process the influx of mailed ballots. Id. \n6 92. Absentee voting is far more expensive and complicated than in-person voting. Recently\n7 the Brennan Center estimated costs of โmaintaining in-person votingโ nationally as $271.4 mil-\n8 lion. The total estimated cost to provide all Americans with a โvote by mail optionโ was between\n9 $982 million and $1.4 billion.1\n10 93. States that have moved to โall-mail elections took many years to get there . . . putting too\n11 much strain on an entirely new system is sure to result in breakdowns and failures.โ Id. The same\n12 breakdowns and failures would occur with a swift transition to many more absentee ballots.\n13 94. Surveys have shown that Americans are concerned with an increase in fraud if mail in\n14 voting is implemented nationwide and that some fear there vote may not be counted.23\n15 95. On a national scale, data from federal Election Assistance Commission reports that from\n16 2012 to 2018 over 28 million mail in ballotsโnearly one in five mail in ballots castโwent miss-\n17 ing.24\n18\n1 Lawrence Norden et al., Report: Estimated Costs of Covid-19 Election Resiliency Mea-\n19\nsures Brennan Center for Justice (2020),\n20 https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/estimated-costs-covid-19-election-resil\niency-measures; see also M.

These same serious consequences are already being reported in Nevada. Daniel D.\n2 Virgilio, a registered voter in Nevada, says that just โ[l]ast week, I found my ballot for the June\n3 primary outside of my mailbox with a handful of other discarded ballots. Over a two day period, I\n4 saw about 4 or 5 ballots discarded a day. I saw about 10 ballots over the course of two days.\n5 Some of the ballots were in the trash can, some were on the floor behind the trash can and the\n6 ledge, and some were on the ledge.โ (Declaration of Daniel Virgilo, attached as Ex.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all of the allegations contained in\n11 all of the preceding paragraphs.\n12 98. The right to vote, with the included right to have oneโs vote counted, is protected by the\n13 First and Fourteenth Amendments and is fundamental, Harper v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 383\n14 U.S. 663, 667 (1966), and well-established: โUndeniably the Constitution of the United States\n15 protects the right of all qualified citizens to vote, in state as well as in federal electionsโ and to\n16 have that vote counted. Reynolds v.

One size does not fit all.โ Id.\n25 101. Voting fraud connected to Mail-in ballots is well-established as a cognizable harm,\n26 along with the related needs to protect election integrity and safeguard voter confidence. See,\n27\n28 _in_last_four_elections_143033.html.\n20\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 64   Filed 05/13/20   Page 21 of 38\n1 e.g., Crawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 192-97 (2008) (citing and relying on,\n2 inter alia, the Report of โthe Commission on Federal Election Report, chaired by former Presi-\n3 dent Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James A. Baker IIIโ). See also Griffin, 385 U.S.\n4 at 1130-31 (absentee ballot problems that require the legislature to balance).\n5 102. The legislature did not prescribe an all-mail election or even a predominantly by-mail\n6 election, but rather an in-person election with limited mail-vote exceptions. By not prescribing\n7 such a mail-in-ballot voting scheme, the legislature exercised its balancing and manner authority\n8 to decide not to impose the overwhelming flood of a mail-in ballot system on the USPS and elec-\n9 tion workers.\n10 103. under the State Plan, Defendants intend to conduct the primary by sending mail-in bal-\n11 lots to all active voters, so there is a sudden surge of mailed ballots that will be difficult to ac-\n12 count for and process, and because of limited in-person voting there will be a surge of absentee\n13 ballot requests from those who did not get a mailed ballot. One likely concern was the risk of\n14 disenfranchisement with a too-short time to phase in the Plan and a resulting sudden glut of Mail-\n15 in ballots.\n16 104. The Clark County Plan will send mail-in ballots to both active and inactive voters. But\n17 the legislative mandate cannot be gainsaid. The rule of law may not be ignored, even amidst di-\n18 minishing COVID-19 concerns. To the extent measures need to be taken to protect public health,\n19 those may not alter the legislative mandate. Rather, safety measures must be taken within what\n20 the legislative mandate by employing safety measures recommended for essential activities to in-\n21 person voting. \n22 105. Due to the sudden surge in Mail-in ballots that will result from the Plans, many voters\n23 will be disenfranchised because requested ballots never arrive or arrive too late and filled-out\n24 ballots get lost or are delayed in the return process. See supra ยถยถ 82-96.\n25 106. Under the balancing required by the Burdick test, Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428\n26 (1992), applied in Crawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181 (2008), the many people\n27 who will be disenfranchised by the sudden surge in mail votes under the Plan weighs heavily\n28 against the Plan under the current situation, making it a severe burden that cannot be justified by\n21\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 64   Filed 05/13/20   Page 22 of 38\n1 a fear of in-person voting in light of the diminished risk of COVID-19 infection, specifically\n2 when voting is an essential governmental activity and essential activities are approved for the\n3 public with appropriate safeguards that will be implemented at the polls. See supra ยถยถ 78-81.\n4 107. Due to this widespread disenfranchisement caused by not abiding by the legislatureโs\n5 law, the Plans violates the right to vote by direct disenfranchisement.\n6\n7 Count II\n     The Plan Violates the Fundamental Right to Vote by Vote-Dilution Disenfranchisement.\n8 (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983; U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV)\n9 108. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all prior paragraphs of this Complaint\n10 and the paragraphs below as though fully set forth herein.\n11 109.  The federal right to vote is fundamental, Harper v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S.\n12 663, 667 (1966), and well-established: โUndeniably the Constitution of the United States protects\n13 the right of all qualified citizens to vote, in state as  well as in federal electionsโ and to have that\n14 vote counted. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 554 (1964). \n15 110. โThe right to vote can neither be denied outright, nor destroyed by alteration of ballots,\n16 nor diluted by ballot-box stuffing.โ Id. at 555 (internal citations omitted). โAnd the right of suf-\n17 frage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizenโs vote just as effec-\n18 tively as by  wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.โ Id.\n19 111. The right to vote inheres in, and is protected by, the First and Fourteenth Amendments\n20 of the U.S. Constitution.\n21 112.  Nevada also recognizes a right to vote: โAll [qualified voters] shall be entitled to vote\n22 for all officers that now or hereafter may be elected by the people, and upon all questions submit-\n23 ted to the electors at such election.โ Nev. Const. art 2, ยง 1. Article 1, ยงยง 8 and 9 of the Nevada\n24 Constitution protect against violations of due process (including for โlibertyโ deprivation) and\n25 free speech rights and provide protection for the right to vote, as does Article 4, ยง 21 safeguards\n26 equal protection and so protects the right to vote from disparate treatment.\n27 113. Both in-person and absentee ballot voting laws encompass safeguards that protect\n28 against voter fraud. For in-person voting, among other protections see supra ยถยถ 64-66 a first-time\n22\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 64   Filed 05/13/20   Page 23 of 38\n1 voter generally must appear in person with identification and proof of residence location. NRS\n2 293.272(1). To obtain an absentee ballot, among other protections see supra ยถยถ 67-71, a voter\n3 must request the ballot and โidentif[y] himself or herself to the satisfaction of the county\n4 clerk.โ NRS 293.313. Yet, the Plans strips statutory protections by the Legislature to prevent\n5 such fraud. \n6 114. Both the in-person voting and absentee voting demonstrate a statutory scheme that en-\n7 sures multiple levels of verification before voting to guarantee the integrity of the voting process.\n8 Voters casting fraudulent ballots face the threat of felony prosecution. All of these protections\n9 and penalties are provided by the Legislature and may not be overruled and replaced by govern-\n10 ment officials as in the Plan. \n11 115.  The Plans would require the State to forego almost all in-person voting and instead con-\n12 duct the Primary by mailed absent ballots. An election conducted by mail ballot only, per the\n13 Plan, would all but ensure an election replete with both ballot fraud.\n14 116. The Plans violates the Votersโ right to vote by diluting their votes with illegal votes\n15 given the removal of safeguards against illegal voting established by the Legislature and the flood\n16 of votes caused by alternating the usual percentage of absentee ballots.\n17\nCount III\n18 The Plan Violates Article I, Section 4, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution.\n19 117. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all prior paragraphs of this Complaint\n20 and the paragraphs below as though fully set forth herein.\n21 118. The Plans violates Votersโ right to have, and to vote in, a federal election where the\n22 โMannerโ of election is โprescribed . . . by the Legislature,โ as required: \n23\nThe Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representa-\n24 tives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress\nmay at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of\n25 chusing Senators.\n26 U.S. Const. art. I, ยง 4, cl. 1. \n27 119. Candidates for the office of U.S. Representative are on the ballot for the June 9 primary.\n28 Ex. L. Therefore, the June 9 primary must be conducted in the Legislatureโs prescribed manner. \n23\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 64   Filed 05/13/20   Page 24 of 38\n1 120. But the Plans are not at all what the Legislature chose and is contrary to controlling leg-\n2 islation. See supra ยถยถ 47-57.  The Secretary and County Administrators chose a manner not au-\n3 thorized by the Legislature and contrary to the Legislatureโs choices. See supra ยถยถ 20-26; 33-47.\n4 121. They have eliminated safeguards against vote fraud that the Legislature chose. See Supra\n5 ยถยถ 64-71.\n6 122. The Plan violates Article I, ยง 4, cl. 1, including a violation of the Voterโs right to have,\n7 and to vote in, such an election as the U.S. Constitution prescribes. \n8\n9\nCount IV\n10 The Plan Violates the Equal Protection\nof the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n11\n12 123. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all prior paragraphs of this Complaint\n13 and the paragraphs below as though fully set forth herein.\n14 124. In Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000), the Supreme Court found that favoring voters in\n15 one county to the disadvantage of voters in other counties violates a long line of one-person-one-\n16 vote authority that requires that citizens in one county not be disadvantaged compared to voters\n17 in other counties. This is a violation of the right to vote (by dilution of vote values in other coun-\n18 ties) and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n19 125. As Bush noted, the voters of one county may not be favored over those of another:\n20 An early case in our one-person, one-vote jurisprudence arose when a State accorded arbi-\ntrary and disparate treatment to voters in its different counties. Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368\n21 (1963). The Court found a constitutional violation. We relied on these principles in the\ncontext of the Presidential selection process in Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U.S. 814 (1969), where\n22 we invalidated a county-based procedure that diluted the influence of citizens in larger\ncounties in the nominating process. There we observed that โ[t]he idea that one group can\n23 be granted greater voting strength than another is hostile to the one man, one vote basis of\nour representative government.โ Id., at 819.\n24\nId. at 107.\n25\n126. Clark County plans to send mail-in ballots to not only active voters, as with the State\n26\nPlan, but also to inactive voters. And it intends to send county-approved ballot harvesters to col-\n27\nlect ballots. Those things enhance the odds of voters in Clark County being able to vote and have\n28\n24\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 64   Filed 05/13/20   Page 25 of 38\n1 their votes counted (while violating the legislatureโs controlling balancing of access and fraud\n2 risk by increasing the odds of ballot fraud).\n3 127. Proportionally more votes will be obtained from Clark County, Nevadaโs most populous\n4 county, than from other countiesโthe difference will not be accounted for by population differ-\n5 ences. \n6 128. Because of this, the Clark County Plan violates the equal-protection clause and causes\n7 and risks vote dilution.\n8 Prayer for Relief\n9 Wherefore, Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court: \n10 1.  Declare that the Plan violates the fundamental right to vote by direct disenfranchisement\n11 under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution; \n12 2. Declare that the Plan violates the fundamental right to vote by vote-dilution disenfran-\n13 chisement under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution;\n14 3. Declare that the Plan violates Article I, ยง 4 , cl. 1 of the U.S. Constitution;\n15 4. Declare that the Clark County Plan violate the equal protection provision of the Fourteenth\n16 Amendment;\n17 5. Issue a preliminary and permanent injunction that:\n18 (a) enjoins the Secretary and County Administrators from implementing the Plan by or-\n19 dering County Administrators to notify every registered voter in every precinct and district by\n20 telephone and mail that the mailed ballot will not be counted as a valid ballot for the primary\n21 election if returned. Each voter must either request an absentee ballot in a written request meet-\n22 ing the statutory requirements of NRS 293.3165 by the statutory deadline in NRS 293.313, or\n23 appear in person on election day at a designated polling location to cast a valid ballot in the pri-\n24 mary election;\n25 (b) enjoins the Secretary and County Administrators to administer the primary electionin\n26 accordance with the legislatureโs prescribed manner and in conformity with the timely precinct\n27 and district designations, subject to timely prior approval of the Secretary of State on or before\n28 March 4, if at all, made for each precinct and district unless contrary to law.

Order the Secretary of State and County Administrators, in coordination with city and\n18 county election officials, to conduct a public information campaign informing Nevada voters that\n19 any mailed ballot not provided as an absent ballot upon written request of a registered voter\n20 meeting the statutory requirements of NRS 293.3165 will not be counted as a lawful ballot for\n21 the primary election if returned. Each voter must either request an absentee ballot by the statutory\n22 deadline or appear in person on election day at a designated polling location to cast a valid ballot\n23 in the primary election;.\n24 7.

(ECF No. 34.) No response was filed within the prescribed time. \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 39   Filed 04/28/20   Page 2 of 6\n \n1  II.  BACKGROUND \n2  The following facts are taken from the Verified Complaint and exhibits attached \n3  thereto. \n4  This action challenges the Secretaryโs decision to conduct an all-mail election for \n5  the June 9, 2020, primary. (ECF No. 1-1.) In the press released issued on March 24, 2020, \n6  the Secretary explained that the decision to implement the Plan was made to โmaintain a \n7  high level of access to the ballot, while protecting the safety of voters and poll workers[โ\n8  who belong to groups who are at high risks for severe illness from COVID-19โ].โ (Id.)  \n9  Under the Plan, all active registered voters will be mailed an absentee ballot (mail-\n10  in ballot) for the primary election. If a voter is registered to vote at his or her current \n11  address, they need not take any further action to receive an absentee ballot. (E.g., ECF \n12  No. 1-3.) If an individual is not registered or needs to update registration information (e.g., \n13  such as name, address, and party), they are required to do so. (Id.) To accommodate \n14  same-day registration requirements enacted by the 2019 Nevada Legislature, the Plan \n15  also establishes at least one physical polling place in each of Nevadaโs counties and in \n16  Carson City. (ECF No. 1-1.)  \n17  Perhaps  without  much  surprise  to  anyone  who  has  followed  states  efforts  to \n18  manage elections during this pandemic, the Plan faces legal challenges in both this Court \n19  and the state court. Here, Plaintiffs assert five claims for relief and request declaratory and \n20  injunctive relief to prevent the Secretary and county administrators from implementing the \n21  Plan. (ECF No. 1 at 8โ13.) They particularly challenge the Planโs expansion of mail-in \n22  voting or in their characterization, โ[t]he Plan would require the State to forego almost all \n23  in-person voting and instead conduct the Primary by mailed absent ballots.โ (ECF No. 1 \n24  at  9.)  In  contrast,  in  a  lawsuit  filed  in  state  court  (โState  Court  Actionโ),  Proposed \n25  Intervenors โdo not object to Defendantsโ expansion of vote by mailโ but they assert where \n26  the Plan fall short is its failure to provide โmeaningful opportunities for in-person votingโ \n27  among other deficiencies. (ECF No. 27 at 3โ4 & n.2; ECF No. 27-3 at 3โ5.) And just as \n28  Proposed  Intervenors  have  moved  to  intervene  in  this  action,  the  group  supporting \n \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 39   Filed 04/28/20   Page 3 of 6\n \n1  Plaintiffs have moved to intervene in the State Court Action. (ECF No. 27-1 at 5 n.3 (stating \n2  that โTrue the Vote, representing two different individual voters, filed a motion to intervene \n3  in the State Court Action, raising exactly the same arguments they have raised in this \n4  caseโ).) \n5  III.  DISCUSSION \n6    The Court agrees with Proposed Intervenors that intervention is warranted as a \n7  matter of right under Rule 24(a) and as permissive under Rule 24(b). \n8    A.  Intervention under Rule 24(a) \n9    When evaluating motions to intervene as a matter of right, courts construe Rule 24 \n10  liberally in favor of potential intervenors, focusing on practical considerations rather than \n11  technical distinctions. Sw. Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Berg, 268 F.3d 810, 817 (9th Cir. \n12  2001). Nonetheless, an applicant for intervention bears the burden of showing that he/she \n13  is entitled to intervene. United States v. Alisal Water Corp., 370 F.3d 915, 919 (9th Cir. \n14  2004).  \n15  Rule 24(a) permits anyone to intervene who โclaims an interest relating to the \n16  property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that disposing \n17  of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movantโs ability to protect [his] \n18  interest,  unless  existing  parties  adequately  represent  that  interest.โ  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P. \n19  24(a)(2). A party seeking to intervene by right must meet four requirements: \n20  (1) the applicant must timely move to intervene; (2) the applicant \nmust have a significantly protectable interest relating to the property \n21  or transaction that is the subject of the action; (3) the applicant must \nbe situated such that the disposition of the action may impair or \n22  impede  the  partyโs  ability  to  protect  that  interest;  and  (4)  the \napplicantโs interest must not be adequately represented by existing \n23  parties. \n \n24  Freedom from Religion Found., Inc. v. Geithner, 644 F.3d 836, 841 (9th Cir. 2011) \n25  (citations  omitted).  โFailure  to  satisfy  any  one  of  the  requirements  is  fatal  to  the \n26  application.โ Id. (quoting Perry v. Prop. 8 Official Proponents, 587 F.3d 947, 950 (9th Cir. \n27  2009)). \n28  /// \n \n3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 39   Filed 04/28/20   Page 4 of 6\n \n1      1.  Factor One: Timeliness \n2  โTimeliness is โthe threshold requirementโ for intervention as of right.โ League of \n3  United Latin Am. Citizens v. Wilson, 131 F.3d 1297, 1302 (9th Cir.1997) (quoting United \n4  States v. Oregon, 913 F.2d 576, 588 (9th Cir.1990)). Proposed Intervenors moved for \n5  intervention within six days from the filing of the action and before the reply brief in support \n6  of Plaintiffsโ motion for preliminary injunction is due under the Courtโs expedited briefing \n7  schedule. (ECF Nos. 1, 27.) There is no question that their Motion is timely. \n8  2.  Factors  Two  and  Three:  Significant  Protectable  Interest  and \n  Impairment of That Interest \n9 \n10  Generally โ[a]n applicant has a โsignificant protectable interestโ in an action if (1) \n11  [he] asserts an interest that is protected under some law, and (2) there is a โrelationshipโ \n12  between [his] legally protected interest and the plaintiffโs claims.โ Cal. ex rel. Lockyer v. \n13  United States, 450 F.3d 436, 441 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Donnelly v. Glickman, 159 F.3d \n14  405, 409 (9th Cir. 1998)). However, โ[t]he โinterestโ test is not a bright-line rule.โ Alisal, 370 \n15  F.3d at 919 (citations omitted). \n16  Proposed Intervenors argue that Plaintiffsโ success on their claims would disrupt \n17  the organizational intervenorsโ efforts to promote the franchise and ensure the election of \n18  Democratic Party candidates, and individual intervenor John Solomonโs plan to vote by \n19  mail. (ECF No. 27 at 7.) Proposed Intervenors have sufficiently shown that they maintain \n20  significant protectable interests which would be impaired by Plaintiffsโ challenge to the \n21  Planโs  all-mail  election  provisions.  That  a  group  of  voters  similar  to  Plaintiffs  have \n22  apparently  moved  to  intervene  in  Proposed  Intervenorsโ  State  Court  Action  further \n23  underscores the significance of the interests at stake and that impairment of the ability to \n24  protect the various interests will likely result should intervention be disallowed here.  \n25    3.  Factor Four: Adequacy of Representation \n26   Courts  consider  three  factors  when  assessing  whether  a  present  party  will \n27  adequately represent the interests of an applicant for intervention: \n28  /// \n \n4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 39   Filed 04/28/20   Page 5 of 6\n \n1  (1) whether the interest of a present party is such that it will undoubtedly \nmake all of a proposed intervenorโs arguments; (2) whether the present \n2  party is capable and willing to make such arguments; and (3) whether a \nproposed intervenor would offer any necessary elements to the proceeding \n3  that other parties would neglect. \n \n4  Arakaki v. Cayetano, 324 F.3d 1078, 1086 (2003). Moreover, โ[t]he burden of showing \n5  inadequacy of representation is โminimalโ and satisfied if the applicant can demonstrate \n6  that representation of its interests โmay beโ inadequate.โ Citizens for Balanced Use v. \n7  Montana Wilderness Assโn, 647 F.3d 893, 898 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Arakaki, 324 F.3d \n8  at 1086). \n9  Proposed Intervenors insist that because they disagree that the other aspects of \n10  the Plan are adequate to extend the franchise for all Nevada voters, their interests do not \n11  fully align with that of Defendants and Defendants therefore cannot adequately protect \n12  their interests in this action. (ECF No. 27 at 8โ9.) However, in terms of this action, \n13  Proposed  Intervenorsโ  interests  do  not  appear  to  diverge  significantly  from  that  of \n14  Defendants. Both groups presumably share the goal of protecting the all-mail election \n15  provisions of the Plan being challenged here. Nevertheless, Proposed Intervenors do not \n16  agree that the Plan goes far enough to protect the franchise, as evidenced by their State \n17  Court Action, and may present arguments about the need to safeguard Nevadanโs right to \n18  vote that are distinct from Defendantsโ arguments. Indeed, a comparison of Defendantsโ \n19  response brief (ECF No. 28) and Proposed Intervenorsโ opposition brief (ECF No. 27-1) \n20  reveal divergent arguments.  \n21  Having considered the relevant factors under Rule 24(a), the Court agrees with \n22  Proposed Intervenors that they have demonstrated entitlement to intervene as a matter of \n23  right. \n24  B.  Intervention under Rule 24(b) \n25  Even if intervention as of right was not warranted in this case, Proposed Intervenors \n26  have demonstrated that they meet the requirements of permissive intervention.  \n27  Rule 24(b)(1)(B) permits a court to allow anyone to intervene who submits a timely \n28  motion and โhas a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question \n \n5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 39   Filed 04/28/20   Page 6 of 6\n \n1  of law or fact.โ An applicant โwho seeks permissive intervention must prove that it meets \n2  three threshold requirements: (1) it shares a common question of law or fact with the main \n3  action; (2) its motion is timely; and (3) the court has an independent basis for jurisdiction.โ \n4  Donnelly, 159 F.3d at 412. Because a court has discretion in deciding whether to permit \n5  intervention, it should consider whether intervention will cause undue delay or prejudice \n6  to the original parties, whether the applicantโs interests are adequately represented by the \n7  existing parties, and whether judicial economy favors intervention. Venegas v. Skaggs, \n8  867 F.2d 527, 530โ31 (9th Cir. 1989).  \n9  Proposed  Intervenors  have  shown  permissive  intervention  is  warranted.  Their \n10  motion is timely, they assert similar defenses in support of the Planโs all-mail election \n11  provisions, and their opposition brief raises arguments in response to Plaintiffsโ challenges \n12  to the Plan and does not assert issues unrelated to this action. (See discussion supra.) \n13  Moreover, the Court finds intervention will not cause delay or prejudice given that the \n14  Motion was filed before Plaintiffsโ reply brief was due and before the scheduled hearing \n15  on the merits.  \n16  IV.  CONCLUSION \n17  The Court notes that the parties made several arguments and cited to several cases \n18  not discussed above. The Court has reviewed these arguments and cases and determines \n19  that they do not warrant discussion as they do not affect the outcome of the motion before \n20  the Court. \n21  It is therefore ordered that Proposed Intervenors-Defendantsโ motion to intervene \n22  (ECF No. 27) is granted.  \n23  DATED THIS 28th day of April 2020. \n24   \n25                           \n            MIRANDA M.

Plaintiffs allege a hodgepodge of claims, \n20 none of them viable, all in an attempt to undermine Defendantsโ effort to protect Nevada voters \n21 during an unprecedented public health crisis. In so doing, they pose a clear and direct threat to \n22 Proposed Intervenorsโ rights and legal interests. \n23 For the reasons set forth below, Proposed Intervenors are entitled to intervene in this case \n24 as a matter of right under Rule 24(a)(2). Such intervention is needed to ensure not only the \n25 fairness of the June Primary, but also the substantial and distinct legal interests of Proposed \n26 Intervenors, which will otherwise be inadequately represented in the litigation. In the alternative, \n27 Proposed  Intervenors  should  be  granted  permissive  intervention  pursuant  to  Rule  24(b).

Also attached as \n2 Exhibit 1 is Proposed Intervenorsโ brief in opposition to Plaintiffsโ motion for a preliminary \n3 injunction.1   \n4 BACKGROUND \n5 In response to the unprecedented public health crisis dominating headlines and impacting \n6 daily lives across the globe, on March 24, 2020, the Secretary announced plans to โconduct an \n7 all-mail electionโ for the June Primary. Press Release, Nev. Secโy of State, Secretary Cegavske \n8 Announces Plan to Conduct the June 9, 2020 Primary Election by All Mail (Mar. 24, 2010), \n9 https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/Home/Components/News/News/2823/23; see also Complaint, ECF \n10 No. 1, ยถยถ 13โ18. In the weeks that followed, county officials, including the Washoe Registrar, \n11 released details of their respective plans implementing the all-mail election. See, e.g., Washoe \n12 Cty.  Registrar  of  Voters,  Notice  of  Vote-By-Mail  Election  of  Official  Sample  Ballot, \n13 https://www.washoecounty.us/voters/vote-by-mail/Vote-by-Mail-Notice.pdf  (last  visited  Apr. \n14 24, 2020); Clark Cty. Election Depโt, June 9, 2020, Primary Election Notice of All-Mail Ballot \n15 Election  (Apr.  15,  2020),  https://www.clarkcountynv.gov/election/Documents/2020/Mailer-\n16 Notice-20P-EXPANDED.pdf; see also Complaint ยถยถ 19โ21. \n17 Concerned about various statutory and constitutional infirmities that threaten to restrict \n18 access to the franchise in the June Primary and beyond, NSDP, DNC, DCCC, and Priorities \n19 USA, joined by four Nevada voters (collectively, the โState Court Plaintiffsโ), filed a lawsuit in \n20 Nevada state court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief (the โState Court Actionโ) on April \n21 16, 2020. See Ex. 3. The complaint was followed by a motion for a preliminary injunction \n22 shortly  thereafter.  See  Ex.  4.  Significantly,  the  State  Court  Plaintiffs  โdo  not  object  to \n23\n                                                 \n24\n1   While Proposed Intervenors believe, for the reasons discussed in their brief in opposition \n25\nto Plaintiffsโ motion for a preliminary injunction, that Plaintiffsโ complaint should be dismissed \nin its entirety, they are including a proposed Answer to fully comply with the requirements of \n26\nRule 24(c). See Landryโs, Inc. v. Sandoval, No. 2:15-cv-00160-GMN-PAL, 2016 WL 1239254, \nat *3 (D. Nev. Mar. 28, 2016). \n27\n28\n3 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 27   Filed 04/27/20   Page 4 of 14\n \n1 Defendantsโ expansion of vote by mail; indeed, the current public health crisis necessitates that \n2 states allow voters to cast ballots without leaving their homes.โ Ex. 3 ยถ 2; see also Ex. 4 at 3. \n3 Instead, they initiated the State Court Action โto ensure that all eligible Nevada voters have a fair \n4 opportunity to exercise their right to the franchise,โ which requires both vote by mail and \n5 meaningful opportunities for in-person voting. Ex. 3 ยถยถ 1โ6.2  \n6 STANDARD OF LAW \n7 โRule  24  traditionally  receives  liberal  construction  in  favor  of  applicants  for \n8 intervention.โ Arkaki v.

United States, No. 3:18-cv-569-MMD-CBC, 2019 WL 718825, at *2 (D. Nev. Jan. 14, \n2 2019) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B)). In addition to a common question of law or fact, \n3 permissive  intervention  under  Rule  24(b)  also  requires  (1) a  timely  motion  and  (2) an \n4 independent basis for the courtโs jurisdiction. See Donnelly v. Glickman, 159 F.3d 405, 412 (9th \n5 Cir. 1998). \n6 ARGUMENT \n7 I.  Proposed Intervenors satisfy Rule 24(a)โs requirements for intervention as a matter \nof right. \n8\n \n9   Proposed Intervenors satisfy each of the four requirements of Rule 24(a). \n10   First, the motion is timely. Plaintiffs filed their complaint on April 21, 2020; this motion \n11 follows six days later, and in advance of the deadline provided by the Court for Defendantsโ \n12 responses to Plaintiffsโ motions for a preliminary injunction and to consolidate. See ECF No. 14. \n13 There has therefore been no delay, and no possible risk of prejudice to the other parties. See \n14 League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Wilson, 131 F.3d 1297, 1302 (9th Cir. 1997); see also \n15 Nevada, 2019 WL 718825, at *2 (granting motion to intervene filed several weeks after action \n16 commenced); W. Expl., 2016 WL 355122, at *2 (granting motion to intervene filed nearly two \n17 months after action commenced). \n18   Second and third, Proposed Intervenors have significant protectable interests in this \n19 lawsuit that might be impaired by Plaintiffsโ causes of action. โAn applicant [for intervention] \n20 has a โsignificant protectable interestโ in an action if (1) it asserts an interest that is protected \n21 under some law, and (2) there is a โrelationshipโ between its legally protected interest and the \n22 plaintiffโs claims.โ W. Expl., 2016 WL 355122, at *2 (quoting Lockyer, 450 F.3d at 441). In \n23 assessing whether such an interest is sufficiently โimpair[ed] or impede[d],โ Fed. R. Civ. P. \n24 24(a)(2), courts โlook[] to the โpractical consequencesโ of denying intervention.โ Nat. Res. Def. \n25 Council v. Costle, 561 F.2d 904, 909 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (quoting Nuesse v. Camp, 385 F.2d 694, \n26 702 (D.C. Cir. 1967)). \n27   Plaintiffsโ challenge to the all-mail June Primary compromises legally protected interests \n28\n5 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 27   Filed 04/27/20   Page 6 of 14\n \n1 for each of the Proposed Intervenors. If Plaintiffs succeed and Defendantsโ plans to mail ballots \n2 to registered voters are thwarted, then NSDP, DNC, DCCC, and Priorities USAโeach of which \n3 is an organization dedicated to promoting the franchise and ensuring the election of Democratic \n4 Party  candidatesโwill  suffer  direct  injury  because  fewer  Democratic  voters  will  have  an \n5 opportunity to vote in the June Primary. See Ex. 3 ยถยถ 14โ16. Without expansive options to vote \n6 by mail, many voters will be forced to choose between risking their health to vote in person and \n7 participating in the June primary, and the result will be far less robust voter turnout in the \n8 primary. Courts have routinely concluded that interference with a political partyโs electoral \n9 prospects constitutes a direct injury that satisfies Article III standing, which goes beyond the \n10 requirement needed for intervention under Rule 24(a)(2) in this case. See, e.g., Tex. Democratic \n11 Party v. Benkiser, 459 F.3d 582, 586โ87 (5th Cir. 2006) (recognizing that โharm to [] election \n12 prospectsโ  constitutes  โa  concrete  and  particularized  injuryโ);  Ohio  Org.  Collaborative  v. \n13 Husted, 189 F. Supp. 3d 708, 726 (S.D. Ohio 2016) (political party โestablished an injury in factโ \n14 where โthe challenged provisions will make it more difficult for its members and constituents to \n15 voteโ), revโd on other grounds sub nom. Ohio Democratic Party v. Husted, 834 F.3d 620 (6th \n16 Cir. 2016); N.C. State Conference of NAACP v. McCrory, 997 F. Supp. 2d 322, 342 (M.D.N.C. \n17 2014) (political party has โdirect, particularized interest in the outcome of an electionโ), affโd in \n18 part, revโd in part on other grounds sub nom. League of Women Voters of N.C. v. North \n19 Carolina, 769 F.3d 224 (4th Cir. 2014); see also Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates, Inc., 137 S. \n20 Ct. 1645, 1651 (2017) (noting that an intervenor of right only needs โArticle III standing in order \n21 to pursue relief that is different from that which is sought by a party with standingโ).  \n22   Moreover, the disruptive and disenfranchising effects of Plaintiffsโ action would require \n23 each of these organizations to divert resources to address the lack of mail ballots, see Ex. 3 \n24 ยถยถ 14-17โanother legally protected interest that is implicated by Plaintiffsโ claims. See, e.g., \n25 Crawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 472 F.3d 949, 951 (7th Cir. 2007) (concluding that โnew \n26 law injures the Democratic Party by compelling the party to devote resourcesโ it would not need \n27 to absent law), affโd, 553 U.S. 181 (2008); Democratic Natโl Comm. v. Reagan, 329 F. Supp. 3d \n28\n6 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 27   Filed 04/27/20   Page 7 of 14\n \n1 824, 841 (D. Ariz. 2018) (finding standing where law โrequire[d] Democratic organizations . . . \n2 to retool their [get-out-the-vote] strategies and divert [] resourcesโ), revโd on other grounds sub \n3 nom. Democratic Natโl Comm. v. Hobbs, 948 F.3d 989 (9th Cir. 2020) (en banc). \n4   Proposed Intervenor John Solomon also has a distinct, legally protected interest in this \n5 action. Solomon expects to receive a mail ballot under Defendantsโ current plans for the all-mail \n6 June Primary. If Plaintiffs prevail and he is not sent a mail ballot, Solomonโs expectations will be \n7 upended and he might not be able to receive a mail ballot in time to cast it. The deprivation of \n8 the right to vote is a significant and irreparable harm, one that is defended against by both the \n9 U.S. and Nevada Constitutions. See U.S. Const. amends. 1, 14; Nev. Const. art. II, ยง 1; see also, \n10 e.g., Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433 (1992) (โIt is beyond cavil that โvoting is of the most \n11 fundamental significance under our constitutional structure.โโ (quoting Ill. State Bd. of Elections \n12 v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 184 (1979))); State ex rel. McMillan v. Sadler, 25 Nev. \n13 131, 170, 58 P. 284, 288 (1899) (โThe right to vote for all officers[ in Article 2, Section 1] could \n14 not be given in stronger or broader language.โ).3 \n15   Fourth,  Proposed  Intervenors  cannot  rely  on  the  parties  in  this  case  to  adequately \n16 represent their interests. โCourts consider three factors when assessing whether a present party \n17 will adequately represent the interests of an applicant for interventionโ: \n18 (1) whether the interest of a present party is such that it will undoubtedly make all \nof a proposed intervenorโs arguments; (2) whether the present party is capable and \n19 willing to make such arguments; and (3) whether a proposed intervenor would \noffer any necessary elements to the proceeding that other parties would neglect. \n20  \n \n21 W. Expl., 2016 WL 355122, at *3 (quoting Arakaki, 324 F.3d at 1086). โ[T]he requirement of \n22 inadequacy of representation is satisfied if the applicant shows that representation of its interests \n23 โmay  beโ  inadequate,โ  and  therefore  โthe  burden  of  making  this  showing  is  minimal.โ  Id. \n24\n                                                 \n25\n3   As one court has observed, โonce the election occurs, there can be no do-over and no \n26\nredress.โ League of Women Voters, 769 F.3d at 247; see also Fla. Democratic Party v. Scott, 215 \nF. Supp. 3d 1250, 1258 (N.D. Fla. 2016) (โThis isnโt golf: there are no mulligans.โ). \n27\n28\n7 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 27   Filed 04/27/20   Page 8 of 14\n \n1 (quoting Sagebrush Rebellion, Inc. v. Watt, 713 F.2d 525, 528 (9th Cir. 1983)); see also Trbovich \n2 v. United Mine Workers of Am., 404 U.S. 528, 538 n.10 (1972). \n3   As  an  overarching  matter,  Defendantsโ  inability  to  adequately  safeguard  Proposed \n4 Intervenorsโ interests is evidenced by the very existence of the State Court Action, in which all \n5 but one of the Proposed Intervenors is a plaintiff.4 While Proposed Intervenors support the \n6 expansion of vote by mail for the June Primaryโand vigorously dispute Plaintiffsโ contentions \n7 that mail voting is either unconstitutional or likely to result in increased fraud, see, e.g., Ex. 6 \n8 ยถ 25โProposed Intervenors have legitimate, articulated concerns that Defendantsโ policies do \n9 not  go  far  enough  in  ensuring  the  franchise  for  all  Nevada  voters.  See  generally  Ex.  3. \n10 Defendantsโ expansion of vote by mail is necessary given the specter of a global pandemic, but it \n11 is not a panacea, and fully protecting Proposed Intervenorsโ significant interests articulated \n12 above requires both expansion of mail voting and meaningful opportunities for in-person voting. \n13 Defendantsโ reluctance to fully protect these interests is evidenced by the Secretaryโs hostile \n14 response to a letter from the NSDP that sought to address its ongoing concerns with the June \n15 Primary. See April Corbin Girnus, Nevada Dems Push for Changes to Upcoming All-Mail \n16 Primary,  Nev.  Current  (Apr.  15,  2020),  https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2020/04/15/nevada-\n17 dems-push-for-changes-to-upcoming-all-mail-primary.  The  dispute  between  NSDP  and  the \n18 Secretary ultimately led to the filing of the State Court Action, and now persuades Proposed \n19 Intervenors that Defendants cannot be relied upon to adequately safeguard their legally protected \n20 interests. \n21   Phrased in the parlance of Rule 24, neither Plaintiffs nor Defendants have interests โsuch \n22 that [they] will undoubtedly make all ofโ Proposed Intervenorsโ arguments. W. Expl., 2016 WL \n23 355122, at *3 (quoting Arakaki, 324 F.3d at 1086). While Defendants are expected to defend the \n24 expansion of vote by mail generally, they will not join Proposed Intervenors in advocating for \n25                                                  \n26\n4   John Solomon is not one of the State Court Plaintiffs, but he served as a declarant in \nsupport of their motion for a preliminary injunction. See Ex. 4 at 16; Ex. 5. \n27\n28\n8 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 27   Filed 04/27/20   Page 9 of 14\n \n1 expanding the all-mail election to include inactive voters or providing accompanying in-person \n2 voting opportunities. See Ex. 3 ยถยถ 89โ129. Defendants and Proposed Intervenors further part \n3 ways on the validity of Nevadaโs Voter Assistance Ban and Ballot Rejection Rules, see id. \n4 ยถยถ 135-73โthe latter of which are referenced in Plaintiffsโ complaint and might therefore be at \n5 issue in this lawsuit as well as the State Court Action. See Complaint ยถยถ 31โ32. By rejecting the \n6 NSDPโs overtures and necessitating the filing of the State Court Action, Defendants have clearly \n7 demonstrated that they are neither โcapable [nor] willing to make suchโ critical arguments. W. \n8 Expl., 2016 WL 355122, at *3 (quoting Arakaki, 324 F.3d at 1086); see also, e.g., Kleissler v. \n9 U.S. Forest Serv., 157 F.3d 964, 974 (3d Cir. 1998) (granting motion to intervene as of right \n10 where private partiesโ interests diverged from the governmentโs interest in representation, and \n11 where โ[t]he early presence of intervenors may serve to prevent errors from creeping into the \n12 proceedings, clarify some issues, and perhaps contribute to an amicable settlementโ); Ohio River \n13 Valley Envtl. Coal., Inc. v. Salazar, No. 3:09-0149, 2009 WL 1734420, at *1 (S.D.W. Va. June \n14 18, 2009) (granting motion to intervene as of right where defendant and proposed intervenor had \n15 identical goals but the โdifference in degree of interest could motivate the [intervenor] to mount \n16 a more vigorous defenseโ and โ[t]he possibility that this difference in vigor could unearth a \n17 meritorious argument overlooked by the current Defendant justifies the potential burden on \n18 having an additional party in litigationโ). \n19   Proposed Intervenors intend to forcefully promote the ability of all eligible Nevadans to \n20 cast ballots in the June Primary, including but not limited to those who are able to vote by mail \n21 under Defendantsโ all-mail election plans, and to protect the electoral and financial interests of \n22 organizations like the NSDP, DNC, DCCC, and Priorities USAโโnecessary elementsโ to ensure \n23 that Nevadansโ rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as \n24 well as Article 2, Section 1 of the Nevada Constitution, are not โneglect[ed].โ W. Expl., 2016 WL \n25 355122, at *3 (quoting Arakaki, 324 F.3d at 1086). Because these arguments will not be made by \n26 the current parties to the litigation, Proposed Intervenors cannot rely on Defendants to provide \n27 adequate representation. \n28\n9 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 27   Filed 04/27/20   Page 10 of 14\n \n1 II.  Alternatively,  Proposed  Intervenors  satisfy  Rule  24(b)โs  requirements  for \npermissive intervention. \n2\n3   Even if this Court were to find Proposed Intervenors ineligible for intervention as of \n4 right, Proposed Intervenors easily satisfy the requirements for permissive intervention under \n5 Rule 24(b), which provides the Court with broad discretion โto allow anyone to intervene who \n6 submits a timely motion and โhas a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common \n7 question of law or fact.โโ Nevada, 2019 WL 718825, at *2 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B)).5 \n8 โBecause a court has discretion in deciding whether to permit intervention, it should consider \n9 whether intervention will cause undue delay or prejudice to the original parties, whether the \n10 applicantโs interests are adequately represented by the existing parties, and whether judicial \n11 economy favors intervention.โ Id. (citing Venegas v. Skaggs, 867 F.2d 530โ31 (9th Cir. 1989)). \n12   For the reasons discussed in Part I supra, Proposed Intervenorsโ motion is timely, and \n13 they cannot rely on Defendants to adequately protect their interests. Proposed Intervenors also \n14 have defenses to Plaintiffsโ claims that share common questions of law and fact. For example, \n15 the State Court Plaintiffs have emphasized that Defendants do, contrary to Plaintiffsโ arguments, \n16 retain the power to designate all-mail elections. See Ex. 3 ยถยถ 29โ31 (discussing Defendantsโ \n17 power to create mailing precincts pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes ยงยง 293.343โ293.355). \n18   And significantly, intervention will result in neither prejudice nor undue delay. Proposed \n19 Intervenors have an undeniable interest in a swift resolution of both this action and the State \n20 Court Action, to ensure that Defendants have sufficient time to allow every Nevada voter to cast \n21 a ballot in the June Primary. Indeed, Proposed Intervenors contend that this action itself will \n22 cause harmful delays that will stymie Defendantsโ efforts to circulate mail ballots. Proposed \n23 Intervenors therefore have a strong interest in both opposing Plaintiffsโ pending motion for a \n24                                                  \n25\n5   Although  permissive  intervention  also  generally  requires  that  โthe  court  has  an \nindependent basis for jurisdiction,โ that finding โis unnecessary where, as here, in a federal \n26\nquestion case the proposed intervener raises no new claims.โ Nevada, 2019 WL 718825, at *2 \n(quoting Donnelly, 159 F.3d at 412). \n27\n28\n10 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 27   Filed 04/27/20   Page 11 of 14\n \n1 preliminary injunction and moving to dismiss their baseless complaint as soon as possible. Given \n2 the legal and factual shortcomings of Plaintiffsโ claims, Proposed Intervenors are confident that \n3 their intervention in this case, and the filings that will follow, will result in expeditious resolution \n4 of this litigation. \n5 / / / \n6 / / / \n7 / / / \n8 / / / \n9 / / / \n10 / / / \n11 / / / \n12 / / / \n13 / / / \n14 / / / \n15 / / / \n16 / / / \n17 / / / \n18 / / / \n19 / / / \n20 / / / \n21 / / / \n22 / / / \n23 / / / \n24 / / / \n25 / / / \n26 / / / \n27 / / / \n28\n11 \n \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 27   Filed 04/27/20   Page 12 of 14\n \n1 CONCLUSION \n2 For the reasons stated above, Proposed Intervenors respectfully request that the Court \n3 grant their motion to intervene as a matter of right under Rule 24(a)(2) or, in the alternative, \n4 permit them to intervene under Rule 24(b).6 \n5   DATED this 27th day of April, 2020 \n6  \n  WOLF, RIFKIN, SHAPIRO, \n7 SCHULMAN & RABKIN,LLP \n \n8   By: /s/ Bradley S.

INTRODUCTION \n3  Little has changed since Plaintiffsโ first motion for a preliminary injunction. The \n4  relevant facts are as stated in the Courtโs order dated April 30, 2020.  See Paher v. \n5  Cegavske, ___ F. Supp.3d ___, 2020 WL 2089813, *2โ4 (D. Nev. 2020).  Plaintiffs did not \n6  seek reconsideration of the Courtโs April 30, 2020 order, as provided for by Rule 60(b) of \n7  the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Plaintiffs did not seek expedited appellate review \n8  premised on the irreparable harm associated with mail-in voting for the June 9, 2020 \n9  primary, for which the counties have already mailed ballots.   \n10  Instead, Plaintiffs waited two weeks to file an amended complaint that rehashes \n11  the original challenge to the legal and statutory basis for the decision by state and local \n  12  election officials to implement an all-mail primary election for June 9, 2020.  The second \n13  motion is a notably cumbersome read, 24 pages in total, because it simply repeats all of \n14  the legal arguments from the original motion, with a few new bells and whistles.  Simply \n15  stated, it a retread, and yet it comes a full two weeks after the Courtโs decision on the \n16  first motion for preliminary injunction.  The inexplicable 2-week delay makes this Courtโs \n17  Purcell concerns from the April 30, 2020 order even more applicable than before, and \n18  further justifies the application of the equitable doctrine of laches.   \n19  As a matter of law, Plaintiffsโ second motion for preliminary injunction specifically \n20  takes issue with the Courtโs conclusion that the Washoe County registrar appears to have \n21  satisfied the notice requirement of NRS ยง 293.213(5), even though notice was provided \n22  after the March deadlines described at NRS ยง 293.205 and .206. (ECF. No 65 at 4โ6). See \n23  Paher, 2020 WL 2089813, *10. Plaintiffs neglect to explain why this warrants a second \n24  motion given the Courtโs finding that the issue is rendered moot by Plaintiffsโ lack of \n25  standing.  See id.  Nothing argued by Plaintiffs suggests any new basis for standing here.   \n26  From a factual standpoint, Plaintiffsโ second motion is likewise bereft of substance.   \n27  Plaintiffs anxiously describe some new developments in Clark County: specifically the \n28  implementation  of  an  election  plan  that  โgives  voters  advantages  over  other-county \n-2- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 78   Filed 05/20/20   Page 3 of 11\n1  voters, including by (i) sending absent ballots to inactive voters and, as reported, โallow a \n2  bipartisan group of deputized โfield registrarsโ to collect sealed ballots from voters.โ (ii) \n3  creating more vote centers than other Nevada counties.โ (ECF No. 64 at 2:12โ15).   By \n4  now  complaining  of  more  vote  centers  (which  presumably  allow  for  more  in-person \n5  voting), Plaintiffs contradict the rationale for their first motion.  While the first motion \n6  advanced  the  speculative proposition  that  less  in-person  voting  would  facilitate  voter \n7  fraud,  the  second  motion  expresses  concern  about  Clark  Countyโs  decision  to  expand \n8  opportunities for in-person voting.  If there is a hearing on this retread motion, Plaintiffs \n9  should explain their change in position on the merits of more in-person voting.    \n10  As to Plaintiffsโ first point about inactive voters and field registrars, they fall back \n11  on the same speculative, unsupported allegations of vote dilution that this court has \n  12  already rejected.  Under Nevada law, Clark County election officials have the discretion \n13  to  determine  the  best  methods  of  reaching  voters  in  their  large,  populous,  and \n14  geographically diverse county.  Plaintiffs do not identify how the addition of vote centers, \n15  or the decision to mail ballots to inactive voters, runs afoul of Nevadaโs election statutes. \n16  Plaintiffsโ  demand  for  injunctive  relief  continues  to  be  grounded  in  their  unprovable \n17  assertion that vote-by-mail processes are inferior to in-person processes as a means of \n18  combatting voter fraud. No evidence has been provided warranting reconsideration of this \n19  courtโs prior order on this issue.   \n20  This  is  ultimately  a  policy  argument  that  Plaintiffs  must  pursue  through \n21  legislative channels, not through civil rights litigation at this belated hour.  Injunctive \n22  relief remains unwarranted in this case.              \n23  II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW1  \n24  Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows defendants to seek \n25  dismissal of a claim or action for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Dismissal under \n                                                 \n26 \n1 This section covers only the standard of review for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) \n27  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The standard for issuance of a preliminary \ninjunction is discussed in the Secretaryโs opposition to Plaintiffโs original motion for a \n28 \npreliminary injunction. (ECF No. 28 at 3-4). In the interest of brevity, the discussion is \nnot repeated here.   \n-3- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 78   Filed 05/20/20   Page 4 of 11\n1  Rule 12(b)(1) is appropriate if the complaint, considered in its entirety, fails to allege facts \n2  on its face that are sufficient to establish subject matter jurisdiction.  In re Dynamic \n3  Random Access Memory (DRAM) Antitrust Litigation, 546 F.3d 981, 984โ85 (9th Cir. \n4  2008). \n5  Although the defendant is the moving party in a motion to dismiss brought under \n6  Rule 12(b)(1), the plaintiff is the party invoking the courtโs jurisdiction.  As a result, the \n7  plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the case is properly in federal court.  McCauley \n8  v. Ford Motor Co., 264 F.3d 952, 957 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing McNutt v. General Motors \n9  Acceptance  Corp.,  298  U.S.  178,  189  (1936)).    Federal  courts  are  courts  of  limited \n10  jurisdiction. Owen Equip. & Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U.S. 365, 374 (1978).  A federal \n11  court  is  presumed  to  lack  jurisdiction  in  a  particular  case  unless  the  contrary \n  12  affirmatively appears.  Stock West, Inc. v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, \n13  873 F.2d 1221, 1225 (9th Cir. 1989).  Thus, federal subject matter jurisdiction must exist \n14  at the time an action is commenced.  Mallard Auto. Grp., Ltd. v. United States, 343 F. \n15  Supp. 2d 949, 952 (D. Nev. 2004). \n16  Article III, ยง 2 of the U.S. Constitution states that the federal courts may only \n17  adjudicate โCasesโ and โControversiesโ.  See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, \n18  559 (1992).  The case-or-controversy requirement of Article III requires that Plaintiffs \n19  establish their โstandingโ as a jurisdictional prerequisite to the prosecution of this law \n20  suit.    Clapper  v.  Amnesty  International  USA,  586  U.S.  398,  408  (2013).    The  Court \n21  discussed the elements of standing in its decision of April 30, 2020.  See Paher, 2020 WL \n22  2089813, *4โ5.  \n23  As the Court previously held, see Paher, 2020 WL 2089813, *5, Plaintiffs do not \n24  have standing to pursue allegations that their votes have been diluted in violation of \n25  rights guaranteed by the First and the Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \n26  At this early point in the election cycle, no votes have even been counted.  Until the votes \n27  have been counted and the 2020 primary election has run its course, it is impossible to \n28  know  whether  anyoneโs  vote  will  be  diluted.    Plaintiffs  speculate  that  the  election-\n-4- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 78   Filed 05/20/20   Page 5 of 11\n1  integrity  and  anti-fraud  measures  in  place  for  the  2020  primary  election  are  not \n2  sufficiently robust to prevent voter fraud.   Without evidence, Plaintiffs offer no reason \n3  why this Court should reconsider its prior order on the same legal issue in this case.   \n4  Ultimately, the search for the proper balance between voter access and election-\n5  integrity  considerations  is  a  matter  for  policy  makers,  not  federal  courts.    Plaintiffsโ \n6  amended complaint must be dismissed on the ground that the Court lacks subject matter \n7  jurisdiction over their claims.         \n8  III.  ARGUMENT \n9  A. Plaintiffsโ New Factual Allegations Do Not Satisfy the Standing Requirement \n10  Plaintiffs continue to challenge the decisions that state and local elections officials \n11  have made in preparation for the June 9, 2020 primary election.  At this point, their \n  12  principal complaint concerns the decision by elections officials in Clark County to open \n13  two additional vote centers, mail ballots to inactive voters, and task certain elections \n14  officials with the responsibility of collecting paper ballots at locations other than the \n15  established vote centers.  These decisions, they claim, will create โa flood of ballotsโ in \n16  Clark County, presumably fraudulent, that will lead to Plaintiffsโ disenfranchisement.    \n17  (ECF No.at 8โ10).  This argument is no less speculative than their previous argument \n18  that statewide vote-by-mail processes would cause their disenfranchisement.  \n19  Plaintiffs  have  simply  modified their argument  slightly,  claiming  now  that  the \n20  conditions in Clark County will favor urban voters to the detriment of rural voters. (ECF \n21  No. 64 at 2:12โ15; ECF No. 65 at 22:1โ9).  Plaintiffs do not allege, however, that their \n22  ability to access the polls in Washoe County has been unconstitutionally impeded.  To the \n23  contrary, they express an eagerness to vote, and no reservations about their ability to \n24  access the polls.  (ECF No. 64 at 3โ4).  Insofar as their renewed motion and amended \n25  complaint are premised upon the alleged preferential treatment of Clark County voters, \n26  their grievance appears to be grounded in a desire to  reduce voter turnout in Clark \n27  County rather than increase voter turnout in Washoe County.  (ECF No. 65 at 22:1โ9). \n28  They cite not a single federal case that supports their argument for adopting measures on \n-5- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 78   Filed 05/20/20   Page 6 of 11\n1  a statewide basis to equalize voter turnout between urban and rural areas in Nevada. \n2  Assuming that such equalization is desirable from a policy standpoint, Plaintiffs might \n3  perhaps explore the possibility of making the polls more accessible in the rural parts of \n4  the state. \n5  Indeed, Plaintiffsโ federal lawsuit is misguided and runs contrary to principles of \n6  federalism and separation of powers.  The discretionary decisions of an executive branch \n7  official, including an election official, must typically be challenged in state court through a \n8  petition for judicial review, as provided by NRS ยง 233B.130, or by way of writ proceedings \n9  when judicial review in not available under the Nevada Administrative Procedures Act. \n10  See NRS Chapter 34; Kay v. Nunez, 122 Nev. 1100, 146 P.3d 801 (2006) (โHere, Kay \n11  understandably challenged the district court's order through both a petition for judicial \n  12  review and a petition for a writ of mandamus. As the petition for judicial review was the \n13  proper  mechanism  .  .  .  Kay's  writ  petition  was  inappropriate.โ).    There  are  limited \n14  methods for challenging agency decisions, such as those at issue here, because โ[t]he \n15  courts  must  be  wary  not  to  tread  upon  the  prerogatives  of  other  departments  of \n16  government or to assume or utilize any undue powers.  Galloway v. Truesdell, 83 Nev. 13, \n17  31, 422 P.2d 237, 249 (1967).  โIf this is not done, the balance of powers will be disturbed \n18  and  that  cannot  be  tolerated  for  the  strength  of  our  system  of  government  and  the \n19  judiciary itself is based upon that theory.โ  Id.    \n20  Proceedings to obtain a writ of mandamus would typically be the proper method for \n21  compelling the Secretary of State to issue an order to county clerks requiring that they \n22  establish no more than one vote center per county, mail ballots to active voters only, and \n23  refrain from using field registrars. NRS ยง 34.160 states that mandamus may be used โto \n24  compel the performance of an act which the law especially enjoins as a duty resulting \n25  from an office, trust or station.โ  But โ[m]andamus will not lie to control discretionary \n26  action, unless discretion is manifestly abused or is exercised arbitrarily or capriciously.โ \n27  Round Hill General Improvement District v. Newman, 97 Nev. 601, 603-04, 637 P.2d 534, \n28  536 (1981).  Moreover, โ[a]n agencyโs interpretation of a statute that it is authorized to \n-6- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 78   Filed 05/20/20   Page 7 of 11\n1  execute is entitled to deference โunless it conflicts with the constitution or other statutes, \n2  exceeds  the  agencyโs  powers,  or  is  otherwise  arbitrary  and  capricious.โโ  Nuleaf  CLV \n3  Dispensary, LLC v. State, Department of Health and Human Servs., 134 Nev. 129, 133, \n4  414 P.3d 305, 308 (2017). (quoting Cable v. State ex rel. Empโrs Ins. Co. of Nev., 122 Nev. \n5  120, 126, 127 P.3d 528, 532 (2006)). \n6  Here, NRS ยง 293.345(1) is silent as to whether ballots may be mailed to inactive \n7  voters as well as active voters.  The Secretary has deferred to the discretion of Clark \n8  County election officials regarding the decision to mail ballots to inactive voters.  This \n9  decision is entitled to deference because it was not arbitrary and capricious, nor did it \n10  exceed the powers granted to the Secretary of State pursuant to NRS ยง 293.247.   \n11  The same is true of the Secretaryโs decision to give county clerks the discretion to \n  12  establish the appropriate number of polling locations and field registrars within their \n13  individual  counties, based  upon  fiscal  concerns,  staffing  and  training  challenges, and \n14  related  logistical  complications.    As  a  matter  of  state  law  over  which  the  Secretary \n15  ultimately has enforcement authority, the resource allocation decisions of local elections \n16  officials are not subject to review by the federal courts.  See Pennhurst State School & \n17  Hospital  v.  Halderman,  465  U.S.  89,  106  (1984)  (โ[T]he  principles  of  federalism that \n18  underlie the Eleventh Amendmentโ prohibit a federal court from granting โrelief against \n19  state officials on the basis of state law, whether prospective or retroactive.โ).      \n20   With respect to alleged violations of federal law, the decisions in question are \n21  entitled to judicial deference under the Anderson-Burdick balancing test, as discussed in \n22  the Courtโs order of April 30, 2020.  See Paher, 2020 WL 2089813, *4โ5.  However, the \n23  Court need not repeat the Anderson-Burdick analysis from its prior decision because \n24  Plaintiffs have not alleged any new facts that would give them standing to pursue their \n25  claims under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and the U.S. Constitution.2  In fact, their new allegations \n26 \n                                                 \n27  2  Just  in  case  the  Court  is  inclined  to  revisit  its  findings  on  the  questions  of \nstanding or relative burdens (Anderson-Burdick), the Secretary incorporates herein by \n28 \nreference the arguments set forth in her opposition to Plaintiffsโ first motion for injunctive \nrelief. (ECF No. 28).     \n-7- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 78   Filed 05/20/20   Page 8 of 11\n1  contradict their previous argument as to why they have standing.  Plaintiffs previously \n2  argued that vote-by-mail processes are vulnerable to manipulation and fraud, such that \n3  their votes would likely be diluted by illegal votes. (ECF No. 1, at 9:8โ24; ECF No. 2 at 5โ\n4  6).  But now they object to the addition of in-person voting processes in Clark County \n5  despite  their  prior  assertion  that  in-person  processes  are  superior  to  vote-by-mail \n6  processes. (ECF No. 64 at 2:14โ15, 9:11โ12).  In summary, Plaintiffs have not bolstered \n7  their argument that they have standing to pursue their claims in federal court.  Their \n8  claims remain as speculative as ever.   \n9  B. Plaintiffs Fail to Connect the Notice Issue to Their Alleged Injury \n10  In their second motion for injunctive relief, Plaintiffs are unusually critical of the \n11  Courtโs finding that the Washoe County registrar appears to have satisfied the notice \n  12  requirement  of  NRS  ยง  293.213(5),  even  though  notice  was  provided  after  the  March \n13  deadlines described at NRS ยง 293.205 and .206. (ECF. No 65 at 4โ6). See Paher, 2020 WL \n14  2089813,  *10.    However,  Plaintiffs  do  not  explain  how  the  alleged  notice  deficiency \n15  contributed to their supposed injury, or why it is relevant given the Courtโs finding that \n16  the issue is rendered moot by Plaintiffsโ lack of standing.  See id.  As the Court noted, \n17  NRS ยง 293.205 and .206 are concerned with adjustments to precinct boundaries. Id. at *9.  \n18  The decision to implement the all-mail primary election did not result in any changes to \n19  precinct boundaries.   Had there been changes to precinct boundaries, advance notice \n20  would  have  given  voters  and  candidates  alike  the  opportunity  to  object  to  potential \n21  gerrymanders well in advance of the primary election.  But gerrymanders are not at issue \n22  in this case.  Plaintiffs do not, indeed cannot explain how untimely notice of a non-\n23  existent adjustment to precinct boundaries contributed to their alleged injury.  The notice \n24  issue is purely academic. \n25  C.  Plaintiffsโ Delay in Seeking Further Consideration Warrants Denial of the Motion \n26  โLaches is an equitable defense.โ Danjaq LLC v. Sony Corp., 263 F.3d 942, 950 (9th \n27  Cir. 2001).  It bars a plaintiff who, โwith full knowledge of the facts, acquiesces in a \n28  transaction and sleeps upon his rights.โ Id. at 950-51 (quotations and citations omitted). \n-8- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 78   Filed 05/20/20   Page 9 of 11\n1  A defendant is entitled to relief under the doctrine where the defendant proves โboth an \n2  unreasonable delay by the plaintiff and prejudice to itself.โ Couveau v. Am. Airlines, Inc., \n3  218 F.3d 1078, 1083 (9th Cir. 2000).  Here, Plaintiffs slept on their purported rights.   \n4  Specifically, Plaintiffs did nothing between the April 30, 2020 order of this Court \n5  and the filing of their amended complaint and second amended complaint.  Consistent \n6  with conducting a mostly mail election, all county clerks have already mailed voters their \n7  ballots during this intervening two weeks.  As of the filing date of the second motion, only \n8  twenty-six days remain to the June 9 primary date.  Plaintiffsโ requested relief would \n9  cause prejudice to the Secretaryโs efforts to run the June 9 primary during the ongoing \n10  public  health  emergency.    Laches  prevents  Plaintiffs  from  obtaining  equitable  relief \n11  following their unreasonable delay.     \n  12  Further, the Supreme Court has cautioned courts not to judicially alter election \n13  systems on the eve of voting.  Purcell v. Gonzalez, 541 U.S. 1, 5-6 (2006).  This Court \n14  recognized the importance of adhering to the Purcell principle in its April 30, 2020 order.  \n15  (Id. at 22:3-5; 23:14โ16.)  Now, after more than two weeks of additional delay caused by \n16  Plaintiffs, the caution proffered by Purcell weighs even more heavily against Plaintiffsโ \n17  last-moment request for judicial interference with the Secretaryโs administration of the \n18  June primary.   \n19  IV.  CONCLUSION \n20  Plaintiffs attempt to advance a legislative agenda in the guise of a civil rights \n21  lawsuit.    While  there  is  certainly  an  appropriate  balance  between  voter  access \n22  concerns and election-integrity concerns, it is not the role of the federal judiciary to \n23  find that balance in the absence of a justiciable case or controversy.  For this reason, \n24  and  the  other  reasons  discussed  above,  the  Court  should  deny  Plaintiffsโ  second \n25  motion for a preliminary injunction, and dismiss its claims pursuant to Fed. Rule \n26  Civ. Proc. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. \n27  Alternatively,  because  the  belated  second  motion  is  untimely  and  lacking  in \n28  relevant factual details, it does not warrant extraordinary relief during the conduct of a \n-9- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 78   Filed 05/20/20   Page 10 of 11\n1  mostly-mail election.

Gloria, in his official capacity as Reg-\n19 istrar of Voters for Clark County, Defendants\n20 Introduction1\n21 In the Factual Background, Plaintiffs established (inter alia) the unassailable facts that (i)\n22 across the nation states are reopening from the COVID-19 lockdown and (ii) even during the\n23 lockdown people were permitted to do essential activitiesโsuch as grocery shopping and in-per-\n24 son votingโwith recommended safeguards. The Wisconsin experience showed that in-person\n25\n1 Nomenclature: Established abbreviations and terms in ECF No. 65, e.g., โState Plan,โ\n26 โClark County Plan,โ and โlegislative mandate,โ are retained; official-capacity defendants and\nintervenor-defendants are collectively โDefendantsโ unless context requires otherwise.\n27\n Defendants filed four briefs with overlapping arguments, and ECF no. 33 was 33 pages.\n28 Given that volume and those overlapping arguments, along with the current page limit, Plaintiffs\nrespond generally to some arguments and deal with referenced, particular arguments as needed.\n1\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 2 of 14\n1 voting with recommended safeguards would not spike COVID-19 cases. To the extent some\n2 threat is ongoing now or by election day, for the vast majority, in-person voting with recom-\n3 mended safeguards is no less reasonable a burden than burdens held reasonable in Crawford v.\n4 Marion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181 (2008). So the untailored, overbroad remedy of a mostly\n5 mail-in election is unwarranted and creates the substantial risks of direct and vote-dilution disen-\n6 franchisement from the court-recognized risks of absentee-ballot fraud and a sudden flood of\n7 mailed ballots. Only the legislature has the authority and expertise to balance access and election\n8 integrity issues, and its balancing nowhere created a mostly-mail system, only one that is primar-\n9 ily in-person voting with absentee voting at a usual percentage deemed safe in this state in view\n10 of the recognized absent-ballot-fraud and mass-mailing problems.2 Inverting that scheme means\n11 that both of those harms are now beyond what the legislature found to be safe in this state and so\n12 puts them at issue as substantial risks make the Plans unconstitutional.\n13 I.\nPlaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits because the U.S. Constitutional Amendments I\n14\nand XIV and Article I, ยง 4, cl.1, require Nevada to follow the legislative mandate.\n15\nA. Only the legislature may lawfully balance ballot access with election integrity, so its\nlegislative mandate must be followed and its balancing establishes as a matter of law\n16\nthe presence of disenfranchisement risks.\n17\nIn I.A, Plaintiffs established key, controlling fundamentals. Only the legislature has the au-\n18 thority and expertise to balance ballot access with the known, court-recognized,3 substantial risk\n19\nof illegal voting posed by mail-in ballots and prescribe the manner of an election. The legisla-\n20\ntureโs balancing, expressed in its  โlegislative mandate,โ is that for this state at this time that bal-\n21\nancing requires that the election be predominantly in-person voting with only modest mail-in\n22\nvoting. That prescribed model establishes an approximate percentage of votes that will be mail-in\n23\n24 2 That the legislatureโs binding balancing was correct continues to be born out by evidence.\nSee, e.g., J. Dienst, Close Results In Paterson Vote Plagued By Fraud Claims; Over 3K Ballots\n25\nSeemingly Set Aside, NBC NY, May 20, 2020, www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/close-results-\n26 in-paterson-vote-plagued-by-fraud-claims-over-3k-ballots-seemingly-set-aside/2425813/(โโThere\nis a genuine absentee ballot fraud scandal going on in Paterson,โ said election law expert and\n27\nUniversity of California-Irvine School of Law professor Rick Hasen.โ).\n28 3See ECF No. 65 at 6 (citing court recognition that mail-in ballots pose a substantial risk of\nillegal votes โmaking this a cognizable issue and interest for balancing that need not be provenโ).\n2\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 3 of 14\n1 ballots and reflects the legislatureโs judgment that this usual percentage poses a tolerable risk of\n2 ballot fraud and mailing problems. Thus, the risk of mail-in ballot fraud and mailing problems\n3 are recognized in the legislative mandate and accounted for in the balancing. So going from a\n4 modest amount of mail-in ballots to mostly mail-in ballots makes the risk of ballot fraud and\n5 mailing problems substantial as a matter of legislative finding inherent in its balancing. Making\n6 access overbroad gives inadequate effect to the substantial interests the legislature balanced.\n7 Defendants ignore these controlling fundamentals. None could show that the legislature es-\n8 tablished a mostly mail-in-voting system. The best they could argue was that the legislature al-\n9 lowed the creation of some mailing precincts. But by using the exception to swallow the rule, the\n10 Secretary and County Administrators turned the legislatureโs balancing of ballot access with\n11 mail-in-ballot-fraud and sudden-mailing problems on its head. When Defendants argue that mail-\n12 in-ballot fraud and mailing problems are speculative, they ignore that these substantial risks were\n13 already recognized by (i) courts and (ii) the legislature in its balancing that created a mostly in-\n14 person system with moderate mail-in voting. Recognition of the substantial risks are baked in,\n15 not speculative. \n16 Defendants miss the irony of their saying that the well-established and substantial risks\n17 posed by mail-in- vote fraud and a sudden flood of mail-in ballots is speculative when the foun-\n18 dation of the overbroad Plans was speculative, i.e., that most voters would self-disenfranchise out\n19 of fear that the same recommended safeguards that were used for in-person voting without spik-\n20 ing COVID-19 in Wisconsin might not work for doing essential activity in Nevada so that voters\n21 might get COVID-19, which might be traceable to voting with safeguards, and might be more\n22 than a mild case as most seem to get. Such speculation did not justify the overbroad remedy of\n23 sending mail-in ballots to all active registered voters, let alone inactive ones as in Clark County.\n24 No defendant established that large numbers of voters will self-disenfranchise if they must vote\n25 in person, and recent Wisconsin evidence shows the contrary. โWhile the COVID-19 pandemic\n26 produced an exceptional shift to vote-by-mail [by requested absentee ballots], it is not clear that\n27 the crisis influenced overall participation. The total ballots cast in the Spring Election and Presi-\n28 dential Preference Vote were not markedly different from previous spring elections.โ Wisc.\n3\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 4 of 14\n1 Elecโn Commโn, April 7, 2020: Absentee Voting Report at 4, (May 15, 2020), elec-\n2 tions.wi.gov/sites/elections.wi.gov/files/2020-05/April%202020%20Absentee%20Vot-\n3 ing%20Report.pdf (documenting problems with the sudden flood of mailed ballots4). That means\n4 that the many who voted in person did not self-disenfranchise but relied on the recommended\n5 safeguards used for all essential activities. So the speculation on which the Plans was founded\n6 was unfounded and the overbroad remedy was unjustified.\n7 Because the legislature has authoritatively balanced ballot access and ballot fraud, the legis-\n8 lative mandate must be followed.5 If it is upended as in the Plans, the significant mail-in-ballot\n9 fraud and mailing-problem risks are a substantial, given concern because they are what the legis-\n10 lative mandate authoritatively removed as cognizable concerns through balancing. So it matters\n11 whether the legislative mandate is followed. And it was not followed generally, because the leg-\n12 islature nowhere created a mostly mail-in voting plan, or specifically, because the legislature re-\n13 quired certain steps to even create mailing districts that were not followed, ECF No. 65 at\n14 Facts(B). In Kelly v. Murphy, 79 Nev. 1, 377 P.2d 177 (Nev. 1963), the Nevada Supreme Court\n15 held that phone directions from the Secretary did not constitute making regulations in compliance\n16 with NRS 293.247, so a recount was without legal authorization and a futile act. Following the\n17 legislative mandate requires doing what the legislature requires to make a regulation.\n18 There is no Eleventh Amendment problem because Plaintiffs are not just trying to enforce\n19 state law in federal courts. Rather, failure to follow the legislative mandate established that mail-\n20 in-ballot fraud and mailing problems are cognizable here and so the disenfranchisement risks\n21\n4 โAt a local level, the extraordinary volume placed enormous stress on election officials,\n22\nelections systems, and the [USPS].โ Id. at 3. โWith nearly six times more ballots in circulation,\nthe number of complaints and concerns increased by a similar amount. Some voters also reported\n23\nnot receiving their absentee ballots while others reported that their completed ballots were not\n24 returned to the clerk in a timely fashion.โ Id. at 12. Yet by-request ballots comprised 61.8%,\n12.6% voted early in person, and 25.6% voted in person on election day. Id. at 6. The Report\n25\nconfirmed the reported โthree tubsโ of undelivered absentee ballots found by the USPS. Id. at 16.\n26 5 The legislative mandate must also be followed because the Elections Clause, U.S. Const.\nart. I, ยง 4, cl.1, requires it as federal candidates are on the ballot. But wholly apart from that, it\n27\nmust be followed because inherent within it is the restriction of mail-in-ballot fraud to the ap-\n28 proximate percentage that the legislature deemed safe for this state in this election, as is the legis-\nlatureโs determination of what is safe regarding mail problems.\n4\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 5 of 14\n1 flow from that as a matter of law given the legislative balancing. There is no Eleventh Amend-\n2 ment issue where Plaintiffs seek to have the legislative mandate followed because not doing so\n3 violates their fundamental right to vote protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The\n4 Eleventh Amendment provides no shield for state officials acting in their official capacities when\n5 plaintiffs request prospective injunctive relief to vindicate such rights. See, e.g., Doe v. Lawrence\n6 Livermore Natโl Lab, 131 F.3d 836, 839 (9th Cir. 1997); Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).\n7 Plaintiffs established that what other states do and what other safeguards exist donโt justify\n8 the inversion of the legislatureโs balancing because only the legislature has the authority and ex-\n9 pertise to balance ballot access and election integrity. Its balancing governs what is required and\n10 safe for this state, so all that the legislature mandated is essential. One cannot properly say that,\n11 because other safeguards exist, election administrators may invert the balancing.\n12 Consequently, the Secretary and County Administrators were required to accommodate\n13 COVID-19 concerns within the legislative mandate, like Wisconsin did, not invert that mandate.\n14 B. Discarding the legislatureโs balance of in-person and mail-in voting and throwing mail-\nin voting open to all violates the right to vote by causing numerous voters to suffer di-\n15 rect disenfranchisement.\n16 In I.B, Plaintiffs established that, based on the legislatureโs balancing of in-person and by-\n17 request absentee-ballot voting in the legislative mandate, throwing mail-in voting open to all\n18 would violate the right to vote by causing numerous voters to suffer direct disenfranchisement.\n19 Again, Plaintiffs relied expressly on the legislatureโs balancing and not prescribing a mostly mail\n20 election, ECF No. 65 at 12-15, which โestablishes the disenfranchisement harm as a matter of\n21 law,โ id. at 15. As established, supra at I.A, Defendants ignore the legislative balancing and man-\n22 date and act as if the Secretary and County Administrators are free to ignore it in election admin-\n23 istration. They are not. In addition to expressly relying on the legislatureโs balancing and man-\n24 date, Plaintiffs provided evidence of disenfranchisement from a sudden increase in mail-in bal-\n25 lots. So Plaintiffs have a non-speculative, substantial, personal risk of direct disenfranchisement,\n26 which is a sufficient harm for standing,6 and it is caused by the Plans, and a holding of likely suc-\n27\n6 Intervenor-Defendants never established that voters will self-disenfranchise or will get\n28 COVID-19 from in-person voting (and the Wisconsin experience establishes otherwise)โonly\nsome risk of such. The same must apply to Plaintiffs, so a substantial likelihood suffices.\n5\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 6 of 14\n1 cess and a preliminary injunction will remedy the harm.7\n2 Given standing, Defendants (not Plaintiffs) must justify the Plans under the test in Burdick v.\n3 Takushi, 504 U.S. 428 (1992), because the burdens here follow those at trial. And because disen-\n4 franchisement is a severe harm, Defendants must prove their broad remedy narrowly tailored to a\n5 compelling interest. But relying on standing arguments, Defendants didnโt meet that burden.\n6 Plaintiffs established that in-person voting with recommended safeguards is similarly safe to\n7 other in-person essential activities with recommended safeguards, that Wisconsin in-person vot-\n8 ing didnโt spike COVID-19 levels, and that such burdens were no greater than the burdens held\n9 โreasonableโ in Crawford, 553 U.S. 181. So for most people, there was no unreasonable burden\n10 and as a result the overbroad, facial remedy of mailing ballots to all active (let alone, inactive)\n11 registered voters was not narrowly tailored. To the extent there is an interest in protecting those\n12 specially at risk, the Plans failed to target them. So the Plans violate the right to vote by direct\n13 disenfranchisement and are unjustified under the Burdick balancing analysis.\n14 C. Discarding the legislatureโs determination that voting should be primarily in person,\nand mailing absentee ballots without request violates the right to vote by causing nu-\n15 merous voters to suffer vote-dilution disenfranchisement. \n16 In I.C. of the opening brief, Plaintiffs relied again on the legislatureโs balancing and determi-\n17 nation that voting should be primarily in person and its requirement that absentee ballots be by\n18 request to establish the substantial risk of illegal votes as a matter of law based on that balancing\n19 and legislative mandate. And they relied on the fact that courts have recognized the substantial\n20 risk of absentee-ballot fraud. So they were not required to prove there is such a substantial risk,\n21 which was amplified many times by abandoning the percentage of such votes that the legislature\n22 found safe and offering mail-in ballots to all active (and inactive in Clark County) registered vot-\n23 ers. Plaintiff supplemented that with some examples, but they were not required to because the\n24 problem is court-recognized and inherent in the legislatureโs balancing and mandate. This sub-\n25\n7 The suggestion that County Administrators who were not sued would not abide by this\n26 Courtโs injunction fails. The Defendants fail to note that Plaintiffs have requested a declaration\nthat the Secretaryโs approval of the County Administratorsโ mail-in balloting plan is unconstitu-\n27\ntional. This declaration of unconstitutionality would void the Secretaryโs approval of all the coun-\n28 tiesโ mail-in balloting plan. Anyway, Plaintiffs are from named-defendant counties so the relief\nwould directly benefit them.\n6\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 7 of 14\n1 stantial risk is not speculative because it is court-recognized and legislature balanced, and as with\n2 direct disenfranchisement, a substantial risk of vote-dilution suffices for standing (just as\n3 Intervenors did not establish that in-person voters will self-disenfranchise or will get COVID-19).\n4 Plaintiffs also established that theirs is clearly not a generalized grievance by a careful analy-\n5 sis of the actual language and meaning of Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992).\n6 They established that the issue is not how many have this grievance but whether they are merely\n7 trying to make the government do its job, which they are not. They are seeking relief for viola-\n8 tions of their fundamental rights. And they established that they are not at the general level of\n9 mere โcitizenโ but are at three levels of specificity beyond that. citizens. They are among that\n10 subset who can actually have their vote diluted. Defendants ignore this clear showing.\n11 Two cited, non-controlling cases, donโt alter this fact. ECF No. 74 at 17. ACRU v. Martinez-\n12 Rivera, 166 F. Supp. 3d 779 (W.D. Tex. 2105), involved review of a magistrateโs report, so un-\n13 objected findings were reviewed only for clear error. ACRU did not object to the magistrateโs\n14 finding that โundermined voter confidence and potential vote dilution[] merely amount to gener-\n15 alized grievances about the government, which do not give rise to associational standingโ and the\n16 court found no clear error. Id. at 787. But in that case the argument was not that the legislature\n17 had already done a balancing concerning the risk of vote dilution, the abandonment of which nec-\n18 essarily presented a substantial risk beyond what the legislature had decided was permissible, but\n19 only that failure to purge voting rolls (under the National Voter Registration Act) might result in\n20 vote dilution. That substantially differs in kind, and present Plaintiffs have a direct harm caused\n21 by abandoning the legislative mandate where actual voting is occurring. And Plaintiffs do object\n22 to, not acquiesce in, the assertion that theirs is a generalized grievance, which they have shown it\n23 not to be in clear detail. So it would be clear error to find it here.\n24 United States v. Florida, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189624 (N.D. Fla. 2012), involved an effort\n25 to intervene by โfour individuals [who] sa[id] that if people are improperly registered to vote it\n26 will dilute the votes of properly registered voters,โ id. at *4, and they (and members of Judicial\n27 Watch) were held to have only the generalized interest of โevery other registered voter in the\n28 state,โ id. (True the Vote asserted a different interestโmonitoring voter-registration listsโbut as\n7\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 8 of 14\n1 there was no interference with that it was not allowed to intervene. Id. at *5-6.) As with ACRU,\n2 no actual voting was underway with an inversion of the legislatureโs balancing that of itself raises\n3 the dilution problem and makes it substantial because it is not within the bounds that the legisla-\n4 ture deemed safe for this state. And neither case involved a sudden flood of mail-in votes.\n5 D. Discarding the legislative mandate violates U.S. Constitution Article I, ยง 4, cl. 1, which\nmandates that the legislature prescribe the manner of election.\n6\nIn I.D, Plaintiffs established that as federal candidates are on the ballot, this election must be\n7\nconducted in the legislatureโs prescribed manner. That manner was primarily in-person voting\n8\nwith a moderate percentage of by-request absentee-ballot votingโat the level the legislature de-\n9\ntermined the substantial, court-recognized risks from absentee-ballot fraud and a sudden flood of\n10\nmail-in ballots were safe. By inverting that balancing, the Plans are not the manner the legislature\n11\nprescribed, and Plaintiffs have further detailed the noncompliance with the legislative mandate.\n12\nECF No. 65 at 3-6.  Why following the legislative mandate is vital is based on the legislatureโs\n13\nauthority and expertise for balancing access and election integrity as explained in I.A, so whether\n14\nthere is a private cause of action for this claim does not matter to that controlling analysis. Defen-\n15\ndants have cited no case holding there is not a private cause of action for this claim, and Plain-\n16\ntiffs believe it is properly assertable, just as a parallel manner clause was at issue in Bush but not\n17\ndecided because the case was decided on a one-person-one-vote equal-protection analysis.\n18\nE. The Clark County Plan to enhance its votersโ strength violates the equal-protection\n19 and right-to-vote rights of voters in other counties under one-person-one-vote doctrine.\n20 In Count IV, Plaintiffs challenged the Clark County Plan under the one-person-one-vote doc-\n21 trine for two things only: (1) mailing to inactive voters and (2) sending county approved ballot\n22 harvesters. ECF No. 64 at ยถ 126. Plaintiffs nowhere challenged the establishment of more polling\n23 places in Count IV, merely mentioning extra polling places in describing what Clark County had\n24 done. Id. at ยถ 39. The same is true of Plaintiffsโ preliminary-injunction memo, which nowhere\n25 argues that the extra polling places are a violation of one-person-one-vote doctrine. ECF No. 65\n26 at 21-23. Plaintiffs believe that in-person voting with recommended safeguards (along with by-\n27 request absentee ballots) was Nevadaโs proper response to COVID-19 concerns. That would be\n28 within the legislative mandate (instead of inverting the legislatureโs balancing) and more polling\n8\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 9 of 14\n1 places facilitate that. Plaintiffs noted that Clark County is the most populous county, ECF No. 65\n2 at 22, so the fact that it would have proportionally more polling places would be expected. So\n3 arguments attacking a supposed challenge to extra polling places are strawman arguments. See,\n4 e.g., ECF Nos. 75 at 2-3 and 77 at 3.\n5 Plaintiffs established that giving one county greater voting strength than others violates the\n6 one-person-one-vote doctrine in violation of the Equal Protection Clause and the fundamental\n7 right to vote under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. ECF No. 65 at 21-23. And sending\n8 unrequested mail-in ballots to inactive voters and sending county-approved ballot harvesters will\n9 ensure that more ballots are collected from voters of Clark County (who largely have a certain\n10 political persuasion, which Defendants donโt deny) than in other counties (largely of a different\n11 political persuasion)โwith the difference not accounted for by population differences. Id.\n12 The Clark County Registrar says there is no right to vote in a manner of oneโs choosing. ECF\n13 No. 75 at 4. But that is not the issue here. The issue generally is violation of the legislatureโs\n14 manner, which balanced and protected against harms that are now at issue by the inversion of its\n15 manner. And specifically, the issue here is about giving voters in one county greater voting\n16 power than voters in other counties, though all have the same manner of voting, i.e., mostly mail-\n17 in voting with modest in-person voting. So this argument is beside the point.\n18 The Secretary says โNRS ยง 293.345(1) is silent on whether ballots may be mailed to inactive\n19 votersโ and so defers. ECF No. 78 at 7. But there is a relevant regulation, NAC 293.412: \n20 (4)(a) A city or county clerk (a): Is not required to send a sample ballot to an inactive\nvoter. (b) Is required to send an absent ballot to an inactive voter if the inactive voter\n21 requests: (1) An absent ballot pursuant to the provisions of NRS 293.313 or 293C.310, as\napplicable; or (2) A military-overseas ballot pursuant to the provisions of chapter 293B of\n22 NRS.โ \n23 That is not silent, deals with inactive voters, and nowhere authorizes absentee ballots for inactive\n24 voters without request. Conversely, it requires inactive voters to request absentee ballots. That\n25 must be followed absent a properly promulgated regulation replacing it. As held in Kelly, 79 Nev.\n26 1, 377 P.2d 177, regulations must be made in compliance with NRS 293.247, and ad hoc,\n27 noncompliant actions in violation of existing regulations are โfutileโ acts โwithout legal authoriza-\n28 tion.โ This regulation speaks to the requirements for inactive registered voters getting an absentee\n9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 10 of 14\n1 ballot and remain unchanged. So it should have been followed by the Secretary and Registrar.\n2 Mailing absentee ballots to inactive registered voters was and is without legal authorization. \n3 The Clark County Registrar tries to distinguish Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000), on the\n4 grounds that it involved a different situation. ECF No. 75 at 4. But most cases can be distin-\n5 guished factually and that doesnโt vitiate their controlling analysis in applicable circumstances,\n6 such as this. Plaintiffs set out the applicable analysis that Bush summarized from prior cases to\n7 the effect that the voters of one county may not be given โgreater voting strength.โ ECF No. 65 at\n8 22. Distinguishing Bush on superficial facts does not address that prior case line. Bush did say\n9 that local entities could use โdifferent technologiesโ or โsystemsโ for voting, as the Clark County\n10 Registrar notes, but that isnโt the issue here. Nor is this like the cases the Registrar cites involv-\n11 ing traceable ballots and changing voting days. And because the Secretary defers to the Registrar\n12 about sending absentee ballots to inactive voters, this is like the statewide situation in Bush\n13 where the central authority allowed different standards in different counties. Not only is the Clark\n14 County Plan contrary to the Secretaryโs own regulation at NAC 293.412, it is contrary to the Sec-\n15 retaryโs own Planโpresumably based on her own balancing that excludes sending ballots to in-\n16 active registered voters, or it has no rational basisโyet the Secretary permits this difference in\n17 voting power between different counties. So this case is like Bush and the prior cases it cited in\n18 which there existed a difference in voting power between counties approved by a state-wide au-\n19 thority. That extra power has real-world results. As Plaintiffs already established, extra mining of\n20 mail-in ballots in the most populous county of a certain persuasion will garner many more votes\n21 of the dominant political persuasion in that county, just like the effort to mine extra votes in cer-\n22 tain counties in Florida in Bush targeted large counties of a preferred political persuasion. In\n23 close elections, those extra votes change results. An the claimed purpose of mailing to inactive\n24 registered voters and county-approved ballot harvesters is to increase the number of votesโif\n25 not it fails for lack of a rational basisโand only Clark County has this extra voting power. That\n26 clearly violates the equal-protection and right-to-vote rights of voters outside Clark County who\n27 do not have the same voting power.\n28 Notably, Intervenors donโt challenge standing for this claim, ECF No. 72 at 11, recognizing\n10\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 11 of 14\n1 that standing to challenge vote-dilution harm is a given in equal-protection cases. Instead, they\n2 say this case is foreclosed by Short v. Brown, 893 F.3d 671 (9th Cir. 2018). ECF No. 72 at 11-12.\n3 But Short doesnโt control for at least three reasons. First, Plaintiffs donโt argue that the Clark\n4 County Plan makes it harder for them to vote, so quotes to the effect that it doesnโt are beside the\n5 point. Second, because Plaintiffs donโt challenge this Plan for making it harder to vote, the notion\n6 that rational-basis scrutiny applies because mail-in voting makes it easier to vote is beside the\n7 point. Third, the part of Short that Intervenors ignore is the part that controls. Note that Short\n8 only involved the phasing in of mail-in voting in California, id. at 674-75, and voters in non-all-\n9 mail counties claimed their vote was diluted by votes in all-mail counties because mail-in voting\n10 was easier. After rejecting that argument, which Plaintiffs donโt make, the Ninth Circuit said this\n11 case is โnothing likeโ the line of cases that Plaintiffs cited from Bush that found an equal-protec-\n12 tion violation where some counties are given greater voting strength, id. at 678-78. In those\n13 disparate-voting-strength cases, strict scrutiny applies because violation of equal protection and\n14 vote-dilution disenfranchisement are severe harms. And under strict scrutiny, it is the burden of\n15 Clark County, and of the Secretary who allowed the disparate voting strength in contravention of\n16 her own State Plan, to establish that it is narrowly tailored to a compelling interest, which they\n17 have made no effort to do. Nor could they because there is no justification, even amid COVID-19\n18 concerns, to empower one county over another. The Clark County Plan must be enjoined as to\n19 the two parts actually challenged.\n20 II.\nA preliminary injunction is necessary to prevent irreparable harm\n21\nto Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights.\n22\nPlaintiff have irreparable harm for the reasons established in Part II of their opening brief.\n23\nECF No. 65. Violations of constitutional rights are irreparable harm. Arguments to the contrary\n24\nfocus on standing, but Plaintiffs have explained why their claims are not speculative and not gen-\n25\neralized grievances, and for Count IV Intervenors donโt dispute standing under equal protection.\n26 III.\nThe balance of equities and the public interest support injunctive relief.\n27\nThe balance of equities and the public interest support the injunctive relief Plaintiffs request\n28\n11\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 12 of 14\n1 for reasons established in Part II of their opening brief. ECF No. 65. \n2 The Washoe County Registrar adds a whole section based on Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S.\n3 1 (2006). ECF NO. 74 at 30-33, claiming that the requested relief would require โelection offi-\n4 cials ... [to] have to scrambleโ to comply and that doing so would โplac[e] into question the in-\n5 tegrity of the th[e] primary election.โ Id. at 32-33. But the Plans place into question the integrity\n6 of the election as detailed above. The requested relief that (i) acknowledges that Plaintiffs are\n7 substantially likely to succeed on their claims that the Plans violate the federal constitution and\n8 (ii) corrects the unconstitutional Plans will enhance the integrity of the election. That is the point\n9 of constitutional rights and the rule of law. If the problems identified are not corrected the elec-\n10 tion will be of dubious integrity with no assurance that electoral outcomes are correct.\n11 And what Defendants want is for the Secretary and County Administrators to be able them-\n12 selves to make a late-breaking inversion of the legislatureโs balancing, and for Clark County to\n13 do so even later, while those whose constitutional rights are violated by those late-breaking ac-\n14 tions are shut out from the constitutional relief to which they would normally be entitled.\n15 Conclusion\n16 For the reasons shown, this Court should preliminarily enjoin the Plan and provide the relief\n17 in the Amended Complaintโs Prayer for Relief.\n18 May 21, 2020 Respectfully submitted,\n19 David OโMara (Nev. bar #8599) /s/ Amanda L.

COVID-10 risk is subsiding\n18\nAmid COVID-19 concerns, policymakers adopted measures to protect public health. Those\n19\nare being adjusted as old models predicting a high death rate and massive deaths proved inaccu-\n20\nrate. Public officials are beginning to โre-openโ the country as concerns decrease. Individuals\n21\nremain free to engage in โessential activities,โ including governmental activities like in-person\n22\nvoting, subject to recommended safeguards to protect their health.

These are not the legislatureโs balancing and prescribed manner as required.\n2 First and foremost, the legislature nowhere created or authorized an all-mail or primarily all-\n3 mail election system for this primary with federal candidates. It allowed creation of mail-in pre-\n4 cincts in counties with low votes and provided some authority for others, but only in a scheme\n5 where the exception would not swallow the rule. And to create new mailing precincts, the legisla-\n6 ture mandated legal requirements for โestablishingโ or โdesignatingโ such a precinct:\n7 (1) The deadline to โestablish[] election precinctsโ and โdesignate precinctsโ is โby on or before\n8 the third Wednesday in March of every even-numbered yearโโMarch 18, 2020. ยง 205(1).8\n9 (2) Notice must be โposted in the manner prescribed for a regular meeting of the board of county\n10 commissionersโ and mailed to many public officials, ยง 213 (5) (a) and (b), 14 days prior to\n11 โestablishing or designating a precinct as a mailing precinctโโMarch 4, 2020. ยง 213 (5).\n12 (3) Prior approval from the Secretary to โestablish a mailing precinctโ must be obtained before\n13 the notices required by ยง 213(5)(a) and (b) are sent outโbefore March 4, 2020. ยง 213(4).\n14 (4) The county clerk shall notify the Secretary and Legislative Counsel of boundaries of all elec-\n15 tion precincts by March 31, 206, after they are established and designated. ยง 205(1). It is un-\n16 known if or when the Washoe Registrar did this a second time after redesignating all pre-\n17 cincts as mailing precincts.\n18 (5) Section 343 et seq. establishes the procedures for mailing precincts, โwhenever the county\n19 clerk has designated a precinct as a mailing precinct.โ ยง 343(2)\n20 So the deadline for establishing and designating a precinct as a mailing precinct was March 18\n21 and the process needed to begin before March 4 with the approval of the Secretary.\n22 The Washoe County Registrar did not comply with the legislatureโs prescribed manner:\n23 (1) Washoe County timely designated its precincts as in-person by notice to the Secretary on\n24 March 10, 2020, and Legislative Counsel on March 20, which was due March 31.

According to the Wisconsin Election Commission Ad-\n7 ministrator, several bins containing numerous ballots were found by state officials undelivered\n8 after the election, either โon their way to voters or already filled out and on their way back to\n9 clerks.โ10 It was reported that over 9000 voters requesting a mail-in ballot never received one.11\n10 Similar problems occurred in Ohio.12 The USPS would require a massive overhaul in operations\n11 to avoid a repeat of the Wisconsin events.

First, the flood of ballots that will be beyond the abilities of\n3 USPS and election workers (who were all expecting and preparing for the normal number of ab-\n4 sentee ballots) to adequately handle, will result in ballots not sent, lost ballots, and tardy ballots,\n5 resulting in direct disenfranchisement. Second, the flood of ballots will be beyond the abilities of\n6 election workers to adequately process and monitor, resulting in more illegal ballots and\n7 vote-dilution disenfranchisement. Third, there will not be a Manner-Clause-compliant election.\n8 Fourth, Plaintiffs living outside Clark County will suffer a violation of their one-person-one-vote\n9 rights under the Clark County Plan. The harms are irreparable; elections lack do-overs. Plaintiff\n10 Gary Gladwill is a local candidate, who has already mailed in his ballot, but has the same risk of\n11 direct and vote-dilution disenfranchisement, along with the added interest that he is likely to lose\n12 ballots cast for him from voters suffering such disenfranchisement.

Winter v. Nat. Res.\nDef. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). The Ninth Circuit weighs these factors on a\n21 sliding scale, such that where there are only โserious questions going to the meritsโโthat\nis, less than a โlikelihood of successโ on the meritsโa preliminary injunction may still\n22 issue so long as โthe balance of hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff's favorโ and the other\ntwo factors are satisfied.\n23\nShort v. Brown, 893 F.3d 671, 675 (9th Cir. 2018) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original). On\n24\nthe merits-success prong, โthe burdens at the preliminary injunction stage track the burdens at\n25\ntrial.โ Gonzales v.

Based on\n6\nwhat the legislature decided, the State and Clark County Plans will cause (B) direct disenfran-\n7\nchisement and (C) vote-dilution disenfranchisement. The Plans (D) are inconsistent with Article\n8\nI, ยง 4, cl. 1. And (E) the Clark County Plan violates the Equal Protection Clause by treating coun-\n9\nties differently in violation of the one-person-one-vote mandate.\n10\nA. Only the legislature may lawfully balance ballot access with election integrity, so its\nlegislative mandate must be followed and its balancing establishes as a matter of law\n11\nthe presence of disenfranchisement risks.\n12\nThe U.S. Constitution โconfers on states broad authority to regulate the conduct of elections,\n13\nincluding federal ones.โ Griffin, 385 F.3d at 1130 (citing U.S. Const. art I, ยง 4, cl.1). โ[S]triking\n14\n... the balance between discouraging fraud and other abuses and encouraging turnout is quintes-\n15\nsentially a legislative judgment . . . .โ Id. at 1131 (emphasis added). There is no right to vote ab-\n16\nsentee and absentee ballots pose special fraud risks, so only the legislature has the authority and\n17\nis equipped to balance access and integrity in the absentee-ballot context. Id. at 1130-31. \n18\nThe legislative judgment cannot be gainsaid based on what other states do because only this\n19\nstateโs legislature has authority to balance and mandate what is needed in this state, including\n20\nprescribing a manner that allows only a modest amount of absentee voting, which curtails the\n21\nrisk posed by mail-in ballots by keeping them to a modest percentage of all votes. โ[S]tates that\n22\nhave more liberal positions for absentee voting may well have different political cultures ..., cul-\n23\ntures less hospitable to election fraud.โ Id. So โ[o]ne size need not fit all.โ Id.\n24\nNor can the legislative judgment be gainsaid on the notion that a particular safeguard isnโt\n25\nneeded because the legislature provided others. The legislature thought they all were required in\n26\nits balancing. Specifically, as Griffin and Crawford, 553 U.S. at 193-96, recognize there is a\n27\nknown and greater risk of ballot fraud with absentee ballots than in-person voting. Knowing that\n28\nrisk, the legislature tightens or loosens absentee-ballot access to control the approximate percent-\n11\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 65   Filed 05/13/20   Page 12 of 25\n1 age of absentee ballots on the basis of perceived risk. If the risk is deemed high, reducing the\n2 number of absentee ballots reduces the impact of absent-ballot vote fraud. And controlling the\n3 approximate percentage of mailed ballots is essential to prevent direct disenfranchisement be-\n4 cause the U.S. Postal Service (โUSPSโ) and election workers are overwhelmed by a sudden flood\n5 of mailed ballots for which they were unable to plan, resulting in lost and tardy ballots and vote-\n6 dilution because overwhelmed screeners are unable to do as careful a job of screening out illegal\n7 ballots. Defendants decision vitiates the legislatureโs balancing by throwing access wide open,\n8 which poses serious risks of direct and vote-dilution disenfranchisement. Other safeguards can-\n9 not repair the lost legislative balancing.\n10 Maintaining the legislatureโs vital balance of absentee ballot access and election integrity is\n11 essential because โconfidence in the integrity of our electoral processes is essential to the func-\n12 tioning of our participatory democracyโ and โ[v]oter fraud drives honest citizens out of the dem-\n13 ocratic process and breeds distrust of our government.โ Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 4\n14 (2006). The Seventh Circuit recently stayed an injunction by the U.S. District Court for the West-\n15 ern District of Wisconsin because it had given inadequate attention to the interest in preventing\n16 voter fraud by eliminating a witness requirement for absentee-ballot signatures: โThis court is\n17 concerned with the overbreadth of the district courtโs order, which categorically eliminates the\n18 witness requirement applicable to absentee ballots and gives no effect to the stateโs substantial\n19 interest in combating voter fraud.โ Democratic National Committee v. Bostelmann, slip op. 3,\n20 Nos. 20-1538, 20-1539, 20-1545 & 20-1546 (7th Cir. Apr. 3, 2020) (citing Griffin v. Roupas, 385\n21 F.3d 1128, 1130 (7th Cir. 2004)), available at https://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/litiga-\n22 tion/documents/DNC_v_Bost_BL-30.pdf. Defendants here have likewise made absentee-ballot\n23 access overbroad and given inadequate effect to the legislatureโs balancing to avoid fraud.\n24 B. Discarding the legislatureโs balance of in-person and mail-in voting and throwing mail-\nin voting open to all violates the right to vote by causing numerous voters to suffer di-\n25 rect disenfranchisement.\n26 The Nevada Legislature exercised its exclusive balancing and manner authority and enacted\n27 detailed legislation (the โlegislative mandateโ) governing how elections are to be conducted in\n28 NRS Title 24, Chapter 293 (titled โElectionsโ). The legislature did not prescribe an all-mail elec-\n12\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 65   Filed 05/13/20   Page 13 of 25\n1 tion or even a predominantly by-mail election, but rather an in-person election with limited mail-\n2 vote exceptions. By not prescribing such a mail-in-ballot voting scheme, the legislature exercised\n3 its balancing and manner authority to decide not to impose the overwhelming flood of a mail-in\n4 ballot system on the USPS and election workersโespecially not suddenly as here.16  Yet under\n5 the State Plan, Defendants intend to conduct the primary by sending mail-in ballots to all active\n6 voters, so there is a sudden surge of mailed ballots that will be difficult to account for and pro-\n7 cess, and because of limited in-person voting there will be a surge of absentee ballot requests\n8 from those who did not get a mailed ballot. The Clark County Plan will send mail-in ballots to\n9 both active and inactive voters. But the legislative mandate cannot be gainsaid. The rule of law\n10 may not be ignored, even amidst diminishing COVID-19 concerns. To the extent measures need\n11 to be taken to protect public health, those may not alter the legislative mandate. Rather, safety\n12 measures must be taken within what the legislative mandate by employing safety measures rec-\n13 ommended for essential activities to in-person voting. \n14 A โstate election lawโ is reviewed under Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992). But\n15 the legislative mandate is not being challenged. Rather the Plans replace it and Plaintiffs defend\n16 it. The Plans fail the Burdick test, which requires โweighing โthe character and magnitude of the\n17 asserted injury to the rights . . . that the plaintiff seeks to vindicateโ against โthe precise interests\n18 put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule,โโ considering โโthe\n19\n16 In Purcell, 549 U.S. 1 (2006), the Supreme Court recognized that voting-rule changes near\n20 an election themselves โresult in voter confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from\nthe polls. As an election draws closer, that risk will increase,โ id. at 4-5. So near-election changes\n21 are discouraged. Because that principle is anchored in the right to vote, its logic applies to Defen-\ndants who changed the rules near an election because their actions pose that risk. Of course this\n22\ncourt can repair near-election changes that violate constitutional rights, as the Supreme Court\n23 recently did in Republican National Committee v. Democratic National Committee, No.\n19A1016, 2020 U.S. LEXIS 2195 (U.S. Apr. 6, 2020) (per curiam), though RNC said โcourts\n24\nshould ordinarily not alter the election rules on the eve of an election.โ2020 U.S. LEXIS 2195, at\n**2-3 (emphasis added). But RNC stayed an order allowing voters to mail absentee ballots after\n25\nelection day. RNC recited various problems that the lower-court order posed and said they โun-\n26 derscore[] the wisdom of the Purcell principle.โ Id. at **3. A crucial point was that the lower-\ncourt order โfundamentally alters the nature of the election.โ Id. Here, Defendants have funda-\n27\nmentally altered the nature of absentee-ballot voting and that near-election harm should be re-\n28 paired here. RNC shows that Defendants cannot do a Purcell principle violation and then assert\nthat principle to avoid judicial review to protect fundamental rights.\n13\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 65   Filed 05/13/20   Page 14 of 25\n1 extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiffโs rights.โโ Id. at 434 (ci-\n2 tation omitted). Strict scrutiny applies to โโsevereโ restrictions,โ but โreasonable, nondiscrimina-\n3 tory restrictionsโ only get rational-basis review and typically survive, id. at 434. As disenfran-\n4 chisement is a severe burden, see, e.g., LWV of N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 244 (4th\n5 Cir. 2014); Ne. Ohio Coal. for the Homeless v. Husted, 696 F.3d 580, 597 (6th Cir. 2012), De-\n6 fendants must prove the Plan narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest.\n7 1. A sudden increase in mailed-in ballots contrary to the legislative mandate will\ncause numerous voters to suffer direct disenfranchisement.\n8\nAs established in Burdick, once a voter challenges a provision, the justification of that provi-\n9\nsion requires examining the impact on all voters. Mr. Burdick wanted to do banned write-in vot-\n10\ning, but the Court held โ[i]t is critical to understand that [his] case is not an isolated example,โ\n11\nand โat least some voters would cast write-in votes for other candidates if given the option. 504\n12\nU.S. at 442-43. Based on that analysis, the impact on all voters must be considered here. \n13\nAs shown in the Factual Background, Facts(D), recent experience with large surges in the\n14\nnumber of mail-in ballots has caused numerous voters to suffer direct disenfranchisement. For\n15\nexample, while there was no sudden spike in COVID-19 cases after Wisconsinโs in-person pri-\n16\nmary, supra at 3 & n.7, that absentee-ballot experience disenfranchised many voters, supra\n17\nFacts(D). A sudden surge of mail-in ballots is guaranteed here because the Plans are sending\n18\nthem out, including for inactive voters in the Clark County Plan, and absentee-ballot requests\n19\nwill also surge because of the limited in-person opportunities and Defendantsโ promotion of a\n20\nmail-in election. Experience elsewhere indicates that the resulting large surge in mailed ballots\n21\nwill result in disenfranchisement from lost or tardy ballots coming and going through the USPS\n22\nfrom and to election workers, with postal and election workers overwhelmed by the flood. More-\n23\nover, those who donโt get a mailed ballot must jump through extra hoops to get one, and might\n24\nnot get one due to the same sudden-flood problems, and with limited in-person voting options\n25\nthey may be unable to vote, either due to the distance to the polling place or the overwhelming\n26\nnumbers who try to vote at the same place. Though the foregoing suffices to establish that nu-\n27\nmerous voters will be disenfranchised, it is vital to note that the legislature found its own limit to\n28\nthe usual percentage of absentee ballots to be necessary as expressed in the fact that it nowhere\n14\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 65   Filed 05/13/20   Page 15 of 25\n1 prescribes an all-mail or primarily all-mail election. That establishes the disenfranchisement\n2 harm as a matter of law. In sum, the sudden flood of mail-in ballots poses a substantial risk that\n3 Plaintiffs and many other voters who use the mail-in ballots will not have them counted. That\n4 violates their right to vote by direct disenfranchisement.\n5 2. In-person voting is an essential activity that may be safely pursued following rec-\nommended safeguards for those engaging in other essential activities and is no\n6 greater burden than that held โreasonableโ in Crawford.\n7 In-person voting is essential activity, like going to the grocery. The recommended safeguards\n8 for shopping apply to in-person voting. Those safeguards (social distancing, sanitizing, masks,\n9 etc.) are designed specifically to keep people safe while doing essential activities. Wisconsin had\n10 an in-person election, with such safeguards, including plexiglass shields between election-board\n11 workers and voters, and there was no resulting spike in COVID-19. See supra at 3 & n.7. Defen-\n12 dantsโ Plans are based on speculation of great risk based on models since shown to be flawed.\n13 But harms and risks associated with COVID-19 are receding and society is reopening, see supra\n14 Facts (A), which undercuts the purported justification for the Plans in balancing.\n15 A benchmark for a reasonable burden that readily survives a Burdick balancing is in Craw-\n16 ford, 553 U.S. 181, which held it not unreasonable to require those lacking photo identification to\n17 vote to bear โthe inconvenience of going to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, gathering required\n18 documents, and posing for a photographโ to get a free ID card because that did โnot qualify as a\n19 substantial burden on most votersโ right to vote ...,โ id. at 198 (Stevens, J., joined by Roberts,\n20 C.J., and Kennedy, J.) (controlling op.). And that burden was mitigated by the fact that voters\n21 could vote a provisional ballot and then โtravel to the circuit court clerkโs office within 10 days\n22 to execute the required affidavit.โ Id. at199. And that burden โis unlikely ... [to] pose a constitu-\n23 tional problem ....โ Id. โAnd even assuming that the burden may not be justified as to a few vot-\n24 ers, that conclusion is by no means sufficient to establishโ the facial relief sought. Id. at 199-00.\n25 These reasonable burdens were closely related to legitimate state interests in โelection moderniza-\n26 tionโ (including cleaning up voter roles recognized to contain unqualified voters), preventing\n27 โvoter fraud,โ and โsafeguarding voter confidence.โ Id. at 192-97. Crawford recognized that vote\n28 fraud exists and is more associated with absentee ballots than in-person voting. Id. at 194-96.\n15\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 65   Filed 05/13/20   Page 16 of 25\n1 Since the burden of required travel and inconvenience in Crawford was reasonable and justified\n2 for the voter-identification requirement despite some possible harm to some persons, Defendants\n3 must prove any burden here is substantially greater and not similarly a reasonable requirement for\n4 most people. But practicing the recommended safeguards for engaging in essential activities is no\n5 greater burden than the burden found reasonable in Crawford, so it is a reasonable, nondiscrimi-\n6 natory restriction that is readily justified in balancing by state interests in election integrity. And\n7 even if the legislative mandate might be a problem for a small number, that in no way justifies\n8 the facial replacement of the legislative mandate with the Plans. Id. at 199-200.\n9 3. Applicable balancing establishes that the Plans violate the right to vote by direct\ndisenfranchisement.\n10\nIn balancing interests, recall that the legislature already did the controlling balancing here in\n11\nits legislative mandate and Plaintiffs simply defend what the legislature authoritatively decided is\n12\nrequired for this state to avoid direct and vote-dilution disenfranchisement. That should control.\n13\nSo considering the legislatureโs balancing in a Burdick balancing provides a foundation for Bur-\n14\ndick balancing of the Plans. The legislatureโs decision not to prescribe statewide mail-in voting is\n15\na โreasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictionโ under Burdick. Compared to Crawfordโs bench-\n16\nmark, primarily state-wide in-person voting under recommended safeguards for doing essential\n17\nactivities is no less reasonable than burdens in Crawford. So the well-established state interests\n18\nin preventing direct and vote-dilution disenfranchisement resulting from a sudden flood of\n19\nabsentee-ballot voting readily justify the original legislative mandate. \n20\nGiven that the legislative mandate readily survives Burdick balancing, Defendants must jus-\n21\ntify supplanting it with their Plans. Given that disenfranchisement is a severe burden, they must\n22\nprove their Plans narrowly tailored to a compelling state interest. Preliminarily, note that the\n23\nPlans are a facial remedy, not one applied to those specially at risk, Defendants essentially held\n24\nthe legislative mandate unconstitutional facially. So they must satisfy the test in United States v.\n25\nSalerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987) (โA facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most\n26\ndifficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of cir-\n27\ncumstances exists under which the Act would be validโ). So at a minimum, the remedy the Plans\n28\nimpose should have been as applied to those specially at risk. Instead, Defendants replaced the\n16\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 65   Filed 05/13/20   Page 17 of 25\n1 legislative mandate with overbroad mail-in-ballot Plans. That overbreadth alone dooms the Plans\n2 under Burdick. As the Supreme Court said when applying Burdick and Salerno in Crawford, one\n3 ought not invalidate the whole provision. \n4 A facial challenge must fail where the statute has plainly legitimate sweep. When we\nconsider the statuteโs broad application to all Indiana voters, we conclude that it imposes\n5 only a limited burden on votersโ rights. The precise interests are advanced by the State are\ntherefore sufficient to defeat petitionersโ facial challenge. ... [P]etitioners have not demon-\n6 strated that the proper remedyโeven assuming an unjustified burden on some vot-\nersโwould be to invalidate the entire statute.\n7\n553 U.S. at 202-03 (quotation marks and citations omitted). See also Bostelmann, slip op. 3,17\n8\n(lower court facial remedy โcategorically eliminates the witness requirement applicable to absen-\n9\ntee ballots and gives no effect to the stateโs substantial interest in combating voter fraudโ). This\n10\ntailoring analyses proves Defendants cannot meet their burden to prove that their facial remedy is\n11\nnarrowly tailored to a compelling state interest. Regarding interests, Defendants will say COVID-\n12\n19 made the Plans necessary because the legislative mandate would have caused disenfranchise-\n13\nment. But that fails for at least three reasons.\n14\nFirst, for disenfranchisement to compel a change to the legislative mandate, there must have\n15\nbeen state action. But no state action would have caused the disenfranchisement, rather any dis-\n16\nenfranchisement would result from COVID-19 concerns and personal choices as to how to react\n17\nto them. Civil-rights claims require state action. But COVID-19 and resulting problems โare not\n18\nimpediments created by the State.โ Bethea v. Deal, 2016 WL 6123241, at *2 (S.D. Ga. Oct 19,\n19\n2016). Defendants believe the state has passive liability for not changing its law in the face of\n20\nissues not of its making, which is not the sort of claims Burdick balances. Bethea, id. at *2-3 (no\n21\nโprecedent that would constitutionally or statutorily mandate that Defendants provide an exten-\n22\nsion in the absence of any actual government action that burdens an individualโs right to voteโ).\n23\nSo the legislative mandate did not, could not, cause disenfranchisement.\n24\nSecond, even if cognizable as state action (it is not) the idea that the legislative mandate\n25\nmight cause elective, self-disenfranchisement due to COVID-19 is built on speculation likely\n26\nbased on early, badly flawed models of COVID-19 with an erroneously high fatality rate and ex-\n27\norbitant numbers of predicted death. Those models proved wrong. Unlike early predictions, hos-\n28\n17 See https://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/litigation/documents/DNC_v_Bost_BL-30.pdf.\n17\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 65   Filed 05/13/20   Page 18 of 25\n1 pitals are not being overwhelmed, ventilators are at a surplus for the extremely rare patient who\n2 needs one, treatments have been developed and more are coming, deaths have declined dramati-\n3 cally, increased testing shows that large numbers of individuals had COVID-19 with mild or no\n4 symptoms (so the calculated fatality rate of COVID-19 is dropping dramatically), testing is be-\n5 coming widespread to better detect who has antibodies18 and who has active disease (so they can\n6 be isolated), and society is reopening as a result of all these improvements. These are things of\n7 which this court can and should take judicial notice. There is no reason most people canโt vote\n8 under recommended safeguards to protect those engaged in such essential services. Wisconsinโs\n9 recent primary shows that in-person voting could be held even earlier in the COVID-19 outbreak\n10 with the usual safeguards for essential activities without a resulting spike in COVID-19 caused\n11 by voting. See supra at 3 & n.7. So the notion that individuals must choose between voting and\n12 their health is overblown and overbroad. If there were ever any validity to the notion that โgov-\n13 ernment actionโ by inaction was disenfranchising persons because some thought they had to\n14 choose voting or their health, that notion is now invalid for most people. So there is no justifica-\n15 tion for the Plansโ facial remedy.\n16 Third, we now know from experience with Wisconsin and other recent elections, that the\n17 sudden flood of mailed ballots, which Defendants are causing, itself causes disenfranchisement.\n18 See supra Facts(D). So numerous state voters will be disenfranchised by the Plans.\n19 So Defendants cannot prove the Plans narrowly tailored or supported by compelling interests\n20 in displacing the legislative mandate and causing widespread direct disenfranchisement.\n21 C. Discarding the legislatureโs determination that voting should be primarily in person,\nand mailing absentee ballots without request violates the right to vote by causing nu-\n22 merous voters to suffer vote-dilution disenfranchisement. \n23 The legislature determined (by its sole balancing authority and expertise) that most voters\n24 should vote with the statutory safeguards that accompany in-person voting and by-request absen-\n25 tee ballots.19 The Plans flood the state with unrequested absentee ballots, even to inactive voters\n26 in Clark County. That means that, there will be ballots left for persons who have moved or whose\n27 18 As herd immunity to viruses typically develops as more people get the virus and recover,\nDefendants would have to prove that this would not be the case with this virus.\n28\n19 These include the statutory procedures for in-person and absentee-ballot voting.\n18\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 65   Filed 05/13/20   Page 19 of 25\n1 address has otherwise changed, laying open the risk of absentee ballots being readily available\n2 for absentee-ballot fraud. And unrequested ballots will arrive at addresses where people are not\n3 expecting them and are liable to be ignored, discarded, put in a pile to allow any viruses to die,\n4 etc., increasing the risk of the ballots not being cast or of being cast by others.  But the legislature\n5 determined that, given the known risk of absentee-ballot fraud, the percentage of absentee votes\n6 must be limited to a typical percentage and not be transformed into all-mail voting by having the\n7 exception become the rule, and without request. That balancing and judgment may not be gain-\n8 said. As a result of the forbidden increase in absentee votes and resulting increase in illegal votes,\n9 legal votes will be diluted, and vote dilution is a form of forbidden disenfranchisement.\n10 The fundamental right to vote is well-established: โUndeniably the Constitution of the\n11 United States protects the right of all qualified citizens to vote, in state as well as in federal elec-\n12 tionsโ and to have that vote counted. Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 554. โ[T]he right of suffrage can be\n13 denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizenโs vote just as effectively as by\n14 wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.โ Id. at 555. As the Plans will flood the state\n15 with absentee votes beyond what the legislature determined to be a safe percentage for this elec-\n16 tion to prevent absent-ballot fraud, numerous voters will have their votes diluted by illegal votes.\n17 Under Burdick, Defendants must prove their Plans narrowly tailored to compelling interests.\n18 As just established, the Plans arenโt narrowly tailored, their purported interest is not compelling,\n19 and the Plans actually causes disenfranchisement. That applies here too.\n20 If Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing because their vote-dilution claim is a gener-\n21 alized grievance, that argument fails for two distinct reasons arising form the generalized-griev-\n22 ance test in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992). Note Lujanโs two formulations: \n23 โข โa plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about governmentโclaiming only\n24 harm to his and every citizensโs interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws,\n25 and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at\n26 largeโdoes not state an Article III case or controversy,โ id. at 560-61 (emphasis added), and\n27 โข  โan injury amounting only to the alleged violation of a right to have the Government act in\n28 accordance with law [is] not judicially cognizable . . . [and] cannot alone satisfy the require-\n19\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 65   Filed 05/13/20   Page 20 of 25\n1 ments of Art. III ....,โ id. at 575-76 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n2 So there are two questions: (1) is the claimant just a citizen trying only to make the government\n3 do its job without more? and (2) is the claim the same claim held by โevery citizenโ? Because the\n4 first of these questions is more specific, it is the core of the analysis. โ[T]he proper inquiry is\n5 whether the plaintiffs sue solely as citizens who insist that the government follows the law.โ\n6 Andrade v. NAACP of Austin, 345 S.W.3d 1, (Tex. 2011) (citing E. Chemerinsky, Constitutional\n7 Law: Principles and Policies 91 (3d ed. 2006)) (emphasis added). โ[N]either citizens nor taxpay-\n8 ers can appear before a court simply to insist that the government and its officials adhere to the\n9 requirements of law.โ C.A. Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure ยง 3531.10 (3d ed. 2008)\n10 (emphasis added). So mere โcitizenโ standing is the issue, and the present challenge is not a gen-\n11 eralized grievance under the first or second question.\n12 First, Plaintiffs donโt bring their vote-dilution claim under mere โcitizenโ standing. Rather,\n13 they assert personal harms from the violation of their own fundamental right to vote that is pro-\n14 tected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. They assert a constitutionally protected right,\n15 and given the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, para. 2, state officials must obey constitu-\n16 tional mandates. Plaintiffs claim is also particularized. They donโt challenge anything not directly\n17 bearing on their vote-dilution claim, so they are not just trying to make the government do its job\n18 in some general way but rather challenge that which particularly violates their right to vote. So\n19 they are not mere citizens just trying to make the government do its job.\n20 Second, Plaintiffs assert a harm that is not the same as for every โcitizen.โ โThe bar is based\n21 not on the number of people affectedโa grievance is not generalized merely because it is suf-\n22 fered by large numbers of people.โ Andrade, 345 S.W.3d at 7 (citing Chemerinsky, Constitu-\n23 tional Law 91). โ[D]enying standing to persons who are in fact injured simply because many oth-\n24 ers are also injured, would mean that the most injurious and widespread Government actions\n25 could be questioned by nobody.โ United States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S. 660, 686-68 (1973).\n26 โ[W]here a harm is concrete, though widely shared, the Court has found injury in fact.โ FEC v.\n27 Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 24 (1998). Plaintiffsโ claim of harm here is actually three levels of specificity\n28 below any harm suffered by โcitizens.โ (1) Within the class of citizens are registered voters; only\n20\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 65   Filed 05/13/20   Page 21 of 25\n1 those registered could suffer vote dilution. (2) Within the class of registered voters are eligible\n2 voters; only the eligible have a right to vote that could suffer vote dilution. (3) Within the class of\n3 registered, eligible voters are those who actually vote; only those who actually vote can have that\n4 vote diluted by illegal votes. So Plaintiffsโ vote-dilution claim is highly particularized and not\n5 even close to Lujanโs citizen-standing definition of a generalized grievance.\n6 So the Plans directly harm Plaintiffs and large numbers of other registered, eligible voters\n7 who vote, because the will cause vote-dilution disenfranchisement, an outcome the legislature\n8 expressly rejected for this election in its legislative mandate, which the Plans displace.\n9 D. Discarding the legislative mandate violates U.S. Constitution Article I, ยง 4, cl. 1, which\nmandates that the legislature prescribe the manner of election.\n10\nThe Plans violate Plaintiffsโ right to have, and to vote in, a federal election where the โMan-\n11\nnerโ of election is โprescribed . . . by the Legislature.โ U.S. Const. art. I, ยง 4, cl. 1. As federal\n12\ncandidates are on the ballot, the primary must be conducted in the legislatureโs prescribed man-\n13\nner. The Plans are contrary to the legislative mandate. In Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000), the\n14\nSupreme Court listed a similar provision requiring that elections for presidential electors be con-\n15\nducted in the manner chosen by the legislature as an issue in the case, but decided that it need not\n16\nreach it because what the Florida Supreme Court had done fell so woefully short of what was\n17\nrequired under the vote-dilution ban that the manner-of-election issue need not be reached. Id. at\n18\n103 (โwhether the Florida Supreme Court established new standards for resolving Presidential\n19\nelection contests, thereby violating Art. II, ยง 1, cl. 2, of the United States Constitutionโ). Simi-\n20\nlarly here, the parallel Manner Clause issue need not need be reached because the disenfranchise-\n21\nment claims can readily decide the case. But if the Court doesnโt decide this case on vote-dilution\n22\nor another claim, the Manner Clause issue should be decided.\n23\nE. The Clark County Plan to enhance its votersโ voting violates the equal-protection and\n24 right-to-vote rights of voters in other counties under the one-person-one-vote doctrine.\n25 Clark County plans to send mail-in ballots to not only active voters, as with the State Plan,\n26 but also to inactive voters. And it intends to send county-approved ballot harvesters to collect\n27 ballots. Those things give Clark County voters greater voting power than other-county voters.\n28 They enhance the odds of voters in Clark County being able to vote and have their votes counted\n21\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 65   Filed 05/13/20   Page 22 of 25\n1 (while violating the legislatureโs controlling balancing of access and fraud risk by increasing the\n2 odds of ballot fraud). As a result, proportionally more votes will be obtained from Clark County,\n3 Nevadaโs most populous county, than from other countiesโthe difference will not be accounted\n4 for by population differences. From a political perspective, mining extra votes from Clark\n5 County favors the dominant political party there at the expense of voters in more rural counties of\n6 a different political persuasion as happened in Florida in Bush. And the fact that the vote harvest-\n7 ers are supposed to be bipartisan and collect sealed ballots doesnโt alter the facts that (i) mining\n8 for votes in areas of known political persuasion will get more votes of that political persuasion\n9 and (ii) Clark County voters are empowered over other voters.\n10 But empowering voters in one county to the disadvantage of voters in other counties violates\n11 a long line of one-person-one-vote authority that requires that citizens in one county not be disad-\n12 vantaged compared to voters in other countiesโprecisely what the Supreme Court held was an\n13 impermissible violation of the right to vote (by dilution of vote values in other counties) and the\n14 Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as discussed in Bush, 531 U.S. 98. \n15 As Bush noted, the voters of one county may not have โgreater voting strengthโ:\n16 An early case in our one-person, one-vote jurisprudence arose when a State accorded\narbitrary and disparate treatment to voters in its different counties. Gray v. Sanders, 372\n17 U.S. 368 (1963). The Court found a constitutional violation. We relied on these principles\nin the context of the Presidential selection process in Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U.S. 814\n18 (1969), where we invalidated a county-based procedure that diluted the influence of citizens\nin larger counties in the nominating process. There we observed that โ[t]he idea that one\n19 group can be granted greater voting strength than another is hostile to the one man, one vote\nbasis of our representative government.โ Id., at 819.\n20\nId. at 107. The same disparate treatment occurred in the 2020 Florida election, where the Florida\n21\nSupreme Courtโs plan was to include totals from two counties though โeach of the counties used\n22\nvarying standards to determine what was a legal vote. Broward County used a more forgiving\n23\nstandard than Palm Beach County, and uncovered almost three times as many new votes, a result\n24\nmarkedly disproportionate to the difference in population between the counties.โ Id. Because of\n25\nthis and similar equal-protection violations causing and risking vote dilution, โ[s]even Justices of\n26\nthe Court agree[d] that there [were] constitutional problems with the recount ordered by the\n27\nFlorida Supreme Court that demand[ed] a remedy.โ Id. at 111. The Florida Supreme Court\n28\nshould have implement eda system without greater voting strength for one group, just as the Ne-\n22\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 65   Filed 05/13/20   Page 23 of 25\n1 vada Legislature was required to adopt such a neutral system. But the Clark County Plan violates\n2 that. Just as the Florida plan had to be enjoined, the Clark County Plan must be enjoined.\n3 *    *    *\n4 As Plaintiffs have a strong likelihood of success on their claims, other preliminary-injunc-\n5 tion factors follow, particularly since the right to vote is based on the First and Fourteenth\n6 Amendments. At a minimum, โโthe balance of hardships tips sharply in [Plaintiffsโ] favorโ and\n7 the other two factors are satisfied.โ Short, 893 F.3d at 675 (citation omitted).\n8 II.\nA preliminary injunction is necessary to prevent irreparable harm\n9\nto Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights.\n10\nPlaintiffs have irreparable harm for reasons tracking their claims. They have no remedy at\n11\nlaw if the Plans proceed and the election is held in violation of Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights. If\n12\nthe Plans proceed, their rights to vote, to equal protection, and to a federal election compliant\n13\nwith the Manner Clause will be violated. Because โthe right of suffrage is a fundamental matter\n14\nin a free and democratic society.โ Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 561โ62 (1964), โ[c]ourts routinely deem\n15\nrestrictions on fundamental voting rights irreparable injury,โ League of Women Voters of N.C. v.\n16\nNorth Carolina (โLWVNCโ), 769 F.3d 224, 247 (4th Cir. 2014) (collecting cases). โ[O]nce the\n17\nelection occurs, there can be no do-over and no redress,โ making the injury to โvoters ... real and\n18\ncompletely irreparable if nothing is done to enjoin [the challenged] law.โ LWVNC, 769 F.3d at\n19\n247. โ[T]here are no mulligansโ where voters are disenfranchised by denial of requested relief.\n20\nFla. Democratic Party v. Scott, 215 F. Supp. 3d 1250, 1258 (N.D. Fla. 2016). And the harm is\n21\nimminent because the election is June 9 and the Plans are already being implemented.\n22 III.\nThe balance of equities and the public interest support injunctive relief.\n23\nWhere as here, Plaintiffs and numerous other voters will be disenfranchised, it is in the pub-\n24\nlic interest that their right to vote be protected. There is no harm to a state if likely unconstitu-\n25\ntional actions are preliminarily enjoined. See, e.g., Giovani Carandola v. Bason, 303 F.3d 507,\n26\n521 (4th Cir. 2002). โ[U]pholding constitutional rights surely serves the public interest.โ Id.\n27\nWhile safeguarding the public health is a traditional police power, the exercise of that power as\n28\n23\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 65   Filed 05/13/20   Page 24 of 25\n1 the Plans do is unjustified by COVID-19 concerns because (i) no state action was disenfranchis-\n2 ing voters, (ii) for most, recommended safeguards for essential activities such as in-person voting\n3 will keep them safe, (iii) the Plans overbroadly and facially send mail-in ballots without limiting\n4 the remedy (assuming arguendo it is authorized), so the balancing of harms and public interest\n5 was impermissibly skewed by from the beginning, (iv) we know from the experience in Wiscon-\n6 sin and elsewhere that the Plan itself will cause disenfranchisement due to the sudden flood of\n7 ballots, and such disenfranchisement is not in the public interest, and (v) nothing justifies em-\n8 powering Clark County voters over other-county voters. Vitally, following the legislatureโs own\n9 balancing of access and integrity, i.e., following the rule of law as expressed in the legislative\n10 mandate, is strongly in the public interest and should outweigh all because only the legislature is\n11 authorized and equipped to balance such interests and prescribe the manner of the election. Vio-\n12 lating the fundamental rule of law as the Plans do is decidedly not in the public interest. The bal-\n13 ance of harms and public interest favor the requested relief.\n14 Conclusion\n15 For the reasons shown, this Court should preliminarily enjoin the Plan and provide the relief\n16 in the Amended Complaintโs Prayer for Relief.\n17\n18 May 13, 2020 Respectfully submitted,\n19\n/s/ Amanda L.

Crucially, the Plan strips the Legislatureโs vote-fraud-pre-\n2 vention safeguards that are required to prevent illegal voting that dilutes Votersโ votes and vio-\n3 lates their right to vote. And it is not the โManner . . . prescribed . . . by the Legislature,โ U.S.\n4 Const. art I, ยง 4, cl. 1, so it may not be used since federal candidates are on the ballot. Other con-\n5 stitutional flaws are established below.\n6 Under the Plan, the Secretary and County Administrators intend to mail unrequested absen-\n7 tee ballots (herein โmail-in ballotsโ) to active registered voters only: โAll active registered voters\n8 in Nevada will be mailed an absentee ballot[1] for the primary election. No action or steps, such as\n9 submitting an absentee ballot request application, will be required by individual voters in order to\n10 receive a ballot in the mail.โ Compl. Ex. A. Qualified voters who are not โactiveโ must apply for\n11 one: โAny registered voter may request to vote by mail. To request an absent ballot, you must\n12 complete and submit an Absent Ballot Request Form to the County Clerk/Registrar of Voters in\n13 the county where you are registered to vote.โ Compl. Ex. B. This mail-in-ballot Plan is not the\n14 Legislatureโs prescribed manner.\n15 As set out in the Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the Plan violates Votersโ (i) right\n16 to vote under the U.S. Constitution (including by vote dilution), (ii) right to vote in a federal elec-\n17 tion compliant with U.S. Constitution Article I, ยง 4, cl. 1, and (iii) right to a republican form of\n18 government under Article IV, ยง 4 of the U.S. Constitution.\n19 As the issues involve fundamental First Amendment rights, Voters ask the Court to waive\n20 the security mentioned in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) or provide for a nominal security\n21 of $1 payable to the Clerk. See, e.g., Baca v. Moreno Valley Unified School District, 936 F.\n22 Supp. 719, 738 (C.D. Cal. 1996 (waiving bond requirement for First Amendment case).\n23 This Motion is based on the following Memorandum of Points and Authorities, pleadings\n24 and papers on record herein, and any argument presented at the hearing on this matter.\n25\n26\n1 The Secretary uses โabsentee ballotโ synonymously with the Nevada term โabsent ballot,โ\nNevada Revised Statutes (โNRSโ) 293.013.

Compl. Ex. A. The Nevada Legislature has enacted de-\n11\ntailed legislation governing how elections are to be conductedโwith vital safeguards against vot-\n12 ing fraudโin NRS Title 24, Chapter 293 (titled โElectionsโ).2 The Secretary of State intends to\n13\nconduct the Primary with the Plan (an โall-mail electionโ) on the Secretaryโs website. Compl.\n14 Exs. A and B.3 As set out in the Motion, supra, the Plan is to mail a mail-in ballot to active regis-\n15\ntered voters without request, to require other registered voters to make a request, and to close\n16\ndown the usual polling places for in-person voting. As relevant to the legal challenges in the\n17\nComplaint, the Plan (A) is not the Legislatureโs prescribed manner, as required, and (B) strips\n18\nnecessary safeguards against vote fraud established by the Legislature.\n19\nA. The Plan is not the โManner prescribed . . . by the Legislature.โ\n20\nThough this election involves federal candidates, the Plan is not the โMannerโ of election\n21\nโprescribed . . . by the Legislature,โ as required by U.S. Constitution, Article I, ยง 4, cl. 1. See Part\n22\nII.A.4. Some examples follow.\n23\nFirst, Chapter 293 requires the Secretary to enact implementing regulations, but limits that to\n24\nthose (i) consistent with legislation and (ii) in place by the last business day of February:\n25\nThe Secretary of State shall adopt regulations, not inconsistent with the election laws of this\nState, for the conduct of primary, general, special and district elections in all cities and\n26\ncounties. Permanent regulations of the Secretary of State that regulate the conduct of a\n27\n2 Available at https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-293.html.\n28 3 Some County Administrators have also released Plan details. See Compl. Exs. C-E, G.\n3\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 4 of 22\n1 primary, general, special or district election and are effective on or before the last business\nday of February immediately preceding a primary, general, special or district election\n2 govern the conduct of that election.\n3 NRS 293.247 (emphasis added). The Plan is untimely because it was announced March 24, 2020,\n4 Compl. Ex. A, and it imposes new regulations for this election inconsistent with controlling law. \n5 Second, the law mandates that county clerks โshall establish election precinctsโ4 โon or be-\n6 fore the third Wednesday in March of every even-numbered year.โ NRS 293.205. So precincts\n7 had to be established by March 18, 2020, though the Plan was put in place on March 24, 2020.\n8 Compl. Ex. A. Accordingly, though county clerks may establish โmailing precinctsโ (where all\n9 ballots are mailed, with certain exceptions) under certain guidelines, NRS 293.343, those like all\n10 precincts had to be established by March 18 under NRS 293.205. Moreover, โon or before the\n11 last day in March of every even-numbered year, the county clerk shall provide the Secretary of\n12 State and the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau with a copy or electronic file of a map\n13 showing the boundaries of all election precincts in the county,โ NRS 293.206, and the Plan is\n14 inconsistent with that. To the extent Defendants deem the Plan such a creation of mailing pre-\n15 cincts, it was not done in the Legislatureโs prescribed manner.\n16 Third, requiring that clerks establish and the Secretary approve maps of precincts, NRS\n17 293.205 and .206, indicates the Legislatureโs intent for such precincts for in-person voting, not\n18 that the whole election be subsumed under an exception allowing mailing districts in certain cir-\n19 cumstances, e.g., โwhenever there were not more than 20 voters registered in a precinct for the\n20 last preceding general election, the county clerk may establish that precinct as a mailing pre-\n21 cinct,โ NRS 293.213(1).5 The Legislatureโs intent to have regular in-person voting and actual\n22\n4 โ[S]tatutes . . . that employ the term โshallโ are presumptively mandatory.โ Nev. Pub. Emps.\n23 Ret. Bd. v. Smith, 129 Nev. 618, 627, 310 P.3d 560, 566 (2013) (citation omitted).\n5 Defendants apparently believe County Administrators may substantially change the elec-\n24\ntion process under NRS 293.213(4):โthe county clerk may establish a mailing precinct or an ab-\n25 sent ballot mailing precinct that does not meet the requirements of subsection 1, 2 or 4 if the\ncounty clerk obtains prior approval from the Secretary of State.โ But as noted in text doing this\n26\nwas untimely under NRS 293.205 and it was not intended to apply to the whole state. Statutes\nmust be read in pari materia. Farm Mut. v. Commโr of Ins., 114 Nev. 535, 541, 958 P.2d 733,\n27\n737 (1998). And NRS 293.205(1) precludes county clerks from establishing, abolishing, altering,\n28 (continued...)\n4\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 5 of 22\n1 absentee-ballot procedures as the controlling model, with certain exceptions, is evidenced\n2 throughout Chapter 293 in its provisions for regular voting. The Plan is not the Legislatureโs pre-\n3 scribed manner.\n4 Fourth, where mailing precincts are created, โcounty clerk[s] shall, at least 14 days before\n5 establishing or designating a precinct as a mailing precinct . . . cause notice of such action to be:   \n6 (a) Posted [as prescribed] . . . ; and (b) Mailed to each Assemblyman, [etc. as prescribed]. Appar-\n7 ently the Plan supplanted this, in contravention of the Legislatureโs prescribed manner.\n8 B. The Plan strips vital anti-vote-fraud safeguards established by the Legislature.\n9 The Plan strips vital safeguards against vote fraud established by the Legislature for in-per-\n10 son voting and actual absentee-ballot voting, which are abandoned with mail-in ballots.\n11 Regarding in-person voting, Nevada requires that โa person who registered by mail or com-\n12 puter shall, for the first election in which the person votes at which that registration is valid, vote\n13 in person unless he or she has previously voted in the county in which he or she is registered to\n14 vote.โ NRS 293.272(1). And an individual who registers at the Department of Motor vehicles, by\n15 mail, or by computer must present valid identification and a document establishing residence.\n16 NRS.293.2725.6 There are some exceptions, but those are the general rules, and they allow local\n17 poll workers and watchers to monitor who is voting and deny voting and issue challenges if ap-\n18 propriateโas does in-person voting in general. But that is all gone with the Plan, under which all\n19 active, registered voters get a mail-in ballot. The safeguards mandated for in-person voting are\n20 set out further below, along with penalties for violations. See infra Part II.A.1.\n21 Regarding actual absentee-ballot voting, Nevada requires the safeguard that a voter must\n22 request the ballot (with limited exceptions): โExcept as provided in NRS 293.272 and 293.502, a\n23 registered voter may request an absent ballot if, before 5 p.m. on the 14th calendar day preceding\n24\n5 (...continued)\n25\nconsolidated and designating election precincts after โthe third Wednesday in March of every\n26 even-numbered year.โ\n6 Likewise, where mail voting has been authorized by law, individuals could only vote by\n27\nmail if they provide the county clerk the same information required at the polling location. NRS\n28 293.2725(1)(b)(1)-(2).\n5\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 6 of 22\n1 the election, the registered voter; (a) Provides sufficient written notice to the county clerk; and\n2 (b) Has identified himself or herself to the satisfaction of the county clerk.โ NRS 293.313. The\n3 Nevada Administrative Code provides that, โA clerk that receives a request for an absent ballot\n4 shall: (1) Compare the address of the voterโs residence in this State which is indicated on the re-\n5 quest with the address which is indicated on the voterโs application to register to vote.โ NAC\n6 293.295. If the address is different on the voter registration and absent ballot applications, the\n7 clerk will send a written notice including: โ(a) A copy and explanation of the provisions set forth\n8 in NRS 293.525; and (b) A postcard to be returned by the voter to the county clerk which in-\n9 cludes verification of the address of the voterโs residence in this State.  The county clerk shall use\n10 a postcard that may not be forwarded to an address of the voter which is different from the ad-\n11 dress to which the notice is mailed.โ NAC 293.295(2). As such, the safeguards in place when a\n12 registered voter moved โfrom one precinct to another or from one congressional district to an-\n13 other within the same countyโ require that the registered voter โmust be allowed to vote in the\n14 precinct where the elector previously residedโ but only after โproviding an oral or written affir-\n15 mation before an election board officer attesting to his or her new address.โ NRS 293.525. Even\n16 if the registered voter moved within the same precinct, that elector must only be โallowed to vote\n17 after providing an oral or written affirmation before an election board officer attesting to his or\n18 her new address.โ Id. By removing this requirement from the election process, a person who has\n19 moved without providing a proper change of address, would be able to circumvent the Legisla-\n20 tive safeguards and vote without providing the required affirmation before an election board offi-\n21 cer if he or she receives the mailed ballot. See also infra Part II.A.1 (further discussion).\n22 II.\nVoters Satisfy the Requirements for a Preliminary Injunction.\n23\nIn the Ninth Circuit, the sliding-scale preliminary-injunction test is as follows:\n24\nPlaintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that: (1) they are likely to succeed\n25\non the merits; (2) they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary\nrelief; (3) the balance of equities tips in their favor; and (4) an injunction is in the public\n26\ninterest. Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). The Ninth Circuit\nweighs these factors on a sliding scale, such that where there are only โserious questions\n27\ngoing to the meritsโโthat is, less than a โlikelihood of successโ on the meritsโa prelimi-\nnary injunction may still issue so long as โthe balance of hardships tips sharply in the\n28\n6\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 7 of 22\n1 plaintiff's favorโ and the other two factors are satisfied. Shell Offshore, Inc. v. Greenpeace,\nInc., 709 F.3d 1281, 1291 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell,\n2 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011)).\n3 Short v. Brown, 893 F.3d 671, 675 (9th Cir. 2018) (emphasis in original)\n4 On the merits-success prong, โthe burdens at the preliminary injunction stage track the bur-\n5 dens at trial.โ Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 429\n6 (2006); see also id. at 428 (citing Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656, 666 (2004); FEC v. Wiscon-\n7 sin Right to Life,, 551 U.S. 449, 464 (2007); United States v. Playboy Entmโt Group, Inc., 529\n8 U.S. 803, 816 (2000). So for example, where provisions burden free-speech rights, the burden is\n9 on the government to justify its provision under strict scrutiny. Finally, in First Amendment\n10 cases, success on the merits typically satisfies the other preliminary injunction elements. See,\n11 e.g., Sammartano v. First Judicial District Court, in and for County of Carson City, 303 F.3d\n12 959, 973-74 (9th Cir. 2002); Bays v. City of Fairborn, 668 F.3d 814, 819 (6th Cir. 2012).\n13 A. Voters have likely success on the merits.\n14 1. The Plan violates the right to vote by removing safeguards against fraudulent votes\nthat dilute legal votes.\n15\nAs established in Part I.B and further below, the Plan strips vital safeguard established by the\n16\nLegislature designed to protect against fraudulent votes that dilute Votersโ votes. This lack of\n17\nmandatory safeguards is a severe burden on Votersโ fundamental right to vote.\n18\nThe federal right to vote is fundamental, Harper v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663,\n19\n667 (1966), and well-established: โUndeniably the Constitution of the United States protects the\n20\nright of all qualified citizens to vote, in state as  well as in federal electionsโ and to have that vote\n21\ncounted. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 554 (1964). โThe right to vote can neither be denied\n22\noutright, nor destroyed by alteration of ballots, nor diluted by ballot-box stuffing.โ Id. at 555 (in-\n23\nternal citations omitted). โAnd the right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of\n24\nthe weight of a citizenโs vote just as effectively as by  wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the\n25\nfranchise.โ Id.

Const. art 2, ยง 1. Article 1, ยงยง 8 and 9 of the Nevada Consti-\n4 tution protect against violations of due process (including for โlibertyโ deprivation) and free\n5 speech rights and so provide protection for the right to vote.  See also State ex rel. McMillan v.\n6 Sadler, 58 P. 284, 288 (1899) (โThe right to vote . . . could not be given stronger or broader lan-\n7 guage.โ); Buckner v. Lynip, 41 P. 762, 764 (1895) (โright of voting, and, of course, of having the\n8 vote counted is one of most transcendent importanceโthe highest under our form of govern-\n9 ment.โ) And under Nevadaโs right to vote, restrictions on these rights are strictly scrutinized with\n10 restrictions causing disenfranchisement struck. See id. (โThat one entitled to vote shall not be\n11 deprived of his privilege by action of the authorities is a fundamental principle.โ). Nevada courts\n12 โlook to federal precedent for guidanceโ on due-process protections. Hernandez v. Bennet-\n13 Haron, 287 P.3d 305, 310 (2012).\n14 The level of scrutiny to be applied to the Plan under the federal right to vote would be strict\n15 scrutiny if the Anderson-Burdick test applies because mandatory safeguards against vote fraud\n16 have been stripped, which dilutes votes and thus is a severe burden. That test requires โweighing\n17 โthe character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights . . . that the plaintiff seeks to vin-\n18 dicateโ against โthe precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden im-\n19 posed by its rule,โโ considering โโthe extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden\n20 the plaintiffโs rights.โโ Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992) (quoting Anderson v.\n21 Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 788โ89 (1983)). Under this test, strict scrutiny applies to โburdensโ\n22 deemed โsevereโ (at issue here) as follows, id. at 434:\n23 the rigorousness of our inquiry into the propriety of a state election law depends upon the\nextent to which a challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n24 Thus, as we have recognized when those rights are subjected to โsevereโ restrictions, the\nregulation must be โnarrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance.โ\n25 Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, 289 (1992). But when a state election law provision im-\nposes only โreasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictionsโ upon the First and Fourteenth\n26 Amendment rights of voters, โthe Stateโs important regulatory interests are generally\nsufficient to justifyโ the restrictions. Anderson, 460 U.S. at 788; see also id., at 788-789,\n27 n. 9.\n28\n8\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 9 of 22\n1 Because the burdens (described below) that the requested relief would impose on the Votersโ\n2 right to vote are severe,7 strict scrutiny applies. \n3 But the Anderson-Burdick test should not apply to the Plan, even though it would typically\n4 govern actual challenges to Nevadaโs legislatively enacted election laws. This is so because the\n5 test by its terms applies to โ[i] a challenge to [ii] a state election law,โ id., and the present case\n6 involves no โchallenge toโ any โstate election law.โ The Plan is not legislated โstate election\n7 law,โ but rather it would override and replace legislated state election law. So the Anderson-\n8 Burdick test doesnโt apply to evaluating the constitutional infirmities of the requested relief\n9 (though were it held to apply, it would require strict scrutiny due to the severe burden).\n10 Rather, the applicable scrutiny where voter disenfranchisement is involved, such as by vote\n11 dilution, is found in the Reynolds-Bush case line. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964); Bush v.\n12 Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000) (per curiam).8 In considering whether, under the federal Equal Protec-\n13 tion Clause, โany constitutionally cognizable principles . . . would justify departures from the\n14 basic standard of  equality among voters,โ Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 561, Reynolds held that the right\n15 to vote is โfundamentalโ: โUndoubtedly, the right of suffrage is a fundamental matter in a free\n16 and democratic society.โ 377 U.S. at 561-62. So franchise impairments get careful, meticulous\n17 scrutiny: โEspecially since the right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is\n18 preservative of other basic civil and political rights, any alleged infringement of the right of citi-\n19 zens to vote must be carefully and meticulously scrutinized.โ Id. at 562. After reviewing argu-\n20 ments that these were โcomplexโ issues, the Court held that โ[t]o the extent that a citizenโs right\n21 to vote is debased, he is that much less a citizen,โ id. at 567, and โan individualโs right to vote for\n22 state legislators is unconstitutionally impaired when its weight is in a substantial fashion diluted\n23 when compared with votes of citizens living in other parts of the State,โ id. at 568.\n24\n7 Disenfranchisement is a severe burden. See, e.g., League of Women Voters of N.C. v. North\nCarolina, 769 F.3d 224, 244 (4th Cir. 2014); Ne. Ohio Coal. for the Homeless v. Husted, 696\n25\nF.3d 580, 597 (6th Cir. 2012).\n26\n8 Though Bush was decided long after Anderson and Burdick, no opinion in Bush cited\nBurdick and only one concurrence cited Anderson, once, but for another proposition. 551 U.S. at\n27\n112 (Rehnquist, joined by Scalia and Thomas, JJ., concurring). So those older cases have no\n28 bearing on the required analysis here.\n9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 10 of 22\n1 Building on Reynolds, Bush didnโt discuss the scrutiny level, but held that the Florida Su-\n2 preme Court could not by its orders and interpretations of state law dilute votersโ fundamental\n3 right to vote, 551 U.S. at 107-11, which was either a per-se ban of vote dilution or at least an ex-\n4 ercise of the strict scrutiny now required in equal-protection challenges involving fundamental\n5 rights with an analysis and outcome so readily apparent that it required no detailing.\n6 Bush is particularly analogous because it addressed the actions of the Florida Supreme Court\n7 (not the legislature) and found them in violation of the vote-dilution barred by Reynolds. The is-\n8 sue here, is action by the Secretary and County Administrators that would do the same. Bush\n9 noted that โ[t]he petition present[ed] the following questions: whether the Florida Supreme Court\n10 established new standards for resolving Presidential election contests, thereby violating Art. II,\n11 ยง 1, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution[9] and failing to comply with 3 U.S.C. ยง 5, and\n12 whether the use of standardless manual recounts violates the Equal Protection and Due Process\n13 Clauses.โ 551 U.S. at 103. The Court found that โit is not necessary to decide whether the Florida\n14 Supreme Court had the authority under the legislative scheme for resolving election disputes to\n15 define what a legal vote is and to mandate a manual recount implementing that definition,โ id. at\n16 105, because โrecount mechanisms implemented in response to the decisions of the Florida Su-\n17 preme Court do not satisfy the minimum requirement for nonarbitrary treatment of voters neces-\n18 sary to secure the fundamental right,โ id.Bush also noted that where both sides claim they are\n19 vindicating the right to vote, constitutional guarantees such as equal protection still control. Id. at\n20 105.10 And Bush highlighted the fact that the Florida Supreme Court order lacked the necessary\n21\n22\n9 In elections selecting Electors for choosing the President and Vice President, this provision\nmandates that the Legislature, not state and local officials, establish procedures: โEach State\n23\nshall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct . . . . .โ So the Plan here could\n24 not be used in choosing Electors because it is not the Manner directed by the Legislature.\n10 As Bush put it, regarding both sides claiming they advance the right, id.:\n25\nThere is no difference between the two sides of the present controversy on these basic\n26\npropositions. Respondents say that the very purpose of vindicating the right to vote justifies\nthe recount procedures now at issue. The question before us, however, is whether the\n27\nrecount procedures the Florida Supreme Court has adopted are consistent with its obligation\n28 to avoid arbitrary and disparate treatment of the members of its electorate.\n10\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 11 of 22\n1 โsafeguardsโ to assure confidence in the outcome. As Bush put it, adequate โsafeguardsโ are\n2 mandatory, id. at 109:\n3\n[W]e are presented with a situation where a state court with the power to assure uniformity\nhas ordered a statewide recount with minimal procedural safeguards. When a court orders\n4\na statewide remedy, there must be at least some assurance that the rudimentary require-\nments of equal treatment and fundamental fairness are satisfied. \n5\nThat mandate to maintain โsafeguardsโ to assure confidence in the election is particularly relevant\n6\nto Votersโ argument below.\n7\nSo the Plan here is either barred per se11 if votes are diluted or it would be subject to strict\n8\nscrutiny and the government must prove it is narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental inter-\n9\nest. Under Reynolds and Bush it is readily seen that vote dilution cannot be justified.\n10\nThe Plan violates the Votersโ right to vote by diluting their votes with illegal votes given the\n11\nremoval of safeguards against illegal voting established by the Legislature. See supra Part I.B and\n12\ninfra at 11-14. While vote dilution in Reynolds and Bush was reviewed under an equal-protection\n13\nanalysis, Reynolds held that โ[t]he right to vote can neither be denied outright, nor destroyed by\n14\nalteration of ballots, nor diluted by ballot-box stuffing.โ 377 U.S. at 555 (internal citations omitted),\n15\nand those violations donโt involve equal protection. โ[T]he right of suffrage can be denied by a\n16\ndebasement or dilution of the weight of a citizenโs vote just as effectively as by  wholly prohibiting\n17\nthe free exercise of the franchise,โ id., which is not limited to the equal-protection context. Likewise,\n18\nโthe Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments prohibit a State from overweighting or diluting votes\n19\non the basis of race or sex,โ id. at 557, which is not limited to the equal-protection context. So\n20\nchallenges based on vote debasement or dilution are not limited to the equal-protection context. \n21\nConsequently, since the Plan dispenses with current statutory protections against illegal voting\n22\nfound in actual absentee-ballot and in-person voting law, the Plan is a cognizable dilution of the\n23\nvotes of eligible, registered voters such as Plaintiff Voters. That dilution requires strict scrutiny,\n24\nbecause โany alleged infringement of the right of citizens to vote must be carefully and meticulously\n25\nscrutinized.โ id. at 562, which the Plan fails.\n26\n27\n11 If government may not dilute votersโ right to vote, doing so cannot be justified under any\n28 interest-tailoring analysis.\n11\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 12 of 22\n1 Both in-person and actual absentee-ballot voting laws include safeguards that protect against\n2 voter fraud. But the Plan strips statutory protections provided by the Legislature to prevent such\n3 fraud. For in-person voting, a first-time voter generally must appear in person with identification and\n4 proof of residence location. See supra Part I.B. For all in-person voters whose name appears on the\n5 roster of registered voters (or they provide an affirmation that they are entitled to vote), the voter\n6 โstate[s] his or her name to the election board officer in charge of the roster,โ who โshall\n7 . . . [a]nnounce the name of the registered voter,โ require a signature and then authenticate it or\n8 resolve any discrepancy. NRS 293.285. The voter โmust sign his or her name in the roster or on a\n9 signature card when he or she applies to vote.โ NRS.293.277(1). This is all done before witnesses\n10 who may know the person, but in any case can watch the personโs demeanor and can see if the\n11 person is trying to duplicate a signature from an exemplar or produces the signature spontaneously.\n12 And observers are permitted at in-person polling places. NRS 293.124 and .247; NAC 293.245\n13 (โObservation of conduct of voting at polling placeโ). The signature is then compared by an election\n14 board officer with the signature on file or on approved identification cards, such as a driverโs license.\n15 Id. at (1)-(2). Records are checked to assure the voter has not already voted. Id. at (3). The law\n16 provides that any person who votes knowing he or she is not qualified commits a Class D felony, as\n17 does one attempting to vote in the name of another. NRS 293.775. The same penalty applies to those\n18 voting more than once in the same election. NRS 293.780.\n19 To obtain an actual absentee ballot, a voter must request the ballot and โidentif[y] himself or\n20 herself to the satisfaction of the county clerk.โ NRS 293.313.โA clerk that receives a request for an\n21 absent ballot shall: (1) Compare the address of the voterโs residence in this State which is indicated\n22 on the request with the address which is indicated on the voterโs application to register to\n23 vote.โ NAC 293.295. If the address is different on the voter registration and absent-ballot applica-\n24 tions, the court will send a written notice including: โ(a) A copy and explanation of the provisions\n25 set forth in NRS 293.525; and (b) A postcard to be returned by the voter to the county clerk which\n26 includes verification of the address of the voterโs residence in this State.  The county clerk shall use\n27 a postcard that may not be forwarded to an address of the voter which is different from the address\n28 to which the notice is mailed.โ NAC 293.295(2). Of course, none of the in-person safeguards of\n12\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 13 of 22\n1 monitoring the voter and the signing are present with actual absentee balloting, but the same penal-\n2 ties apply for being unqualified to vote, voting in anotherโs name, and voting twice. In addition, what\n3 is known as โballot harvestingโ is banned by NRS NRS 293.330(4), which bars return of an actual\n4 absentee ballot except by the voter โor, at the request of the voter, a member of the voterโs familyโ\n5 (with the family member required to verify the facts on a form). See also NRS 293.353 (same\n6 restriction for โmailing ballotโ as for โabsent ballotโ). Presumably those restrictions and penalties\n7 apply to mail-in ballots as well as to actual absentee ballots. Though some actual absentee-ballot\n8 safeguards remain under the mail-in-ballot Plan, the elimination of the necessity to request a ballot\n9 through the usual procedures is a safeguard that must not be omitted because of the fraud potential\n10 of having unrequested, perhaps unexpected ballots arriving around the state. An automatically mailed\n11 mail-in ballot might be ignored, lost in a pile of letters set aside for a period before opening to allow\n12 any resident viruses to die, not noticed because the resident voters are sheltering in place at a differ-\n13 ent location, or some other such possibility. And having large numbers of unrequested mail-in ballots\n14 flooding the state in such conditions invites ballot fraud.\n15 Both the in-person and actual-absentee-ballot scenarios demonstrate a statutory scheme that\n16 ensures multiple levels of verification before voting to guarantee the integrity of the voting process.\n17 Voters casting fraudulent ballots face the threat of felony prosecution. All of these protections and\n18 penalties are provided by the Legislature and may not be overruled and replaced by government\n19 officials as in the Plan. The Plan would require the State to forego almost all in-person voting and\n20 instead conduct the primary by automatically mailed mail-in ballots. County Administrators would\n21 send each active registered voter in the county a mail-in ballot without the individual first having to\n22 submit an application for an actual absentee ballot. That mail-in ballot, then, is to be completed by\n23 the voter and returned by mail. An election conducted primarily by mail-in ballot, per the Plan,\n24 would all but ensure an election replete with ballot fraud.\n25 It is all but certain that, without these measures, many mail-in ballots will be unlawfully re-\n26 ceived, voted, and counted in the primary. Those individuals who illegally vote will unlawfully\n27 negate and ultimately dilute the choices made by the lawfully registered voters of this Stateโ voters\n28\n13\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 14 of 22\n1 the Legislature has carefully and methodically taken great care to protect. (As noted in the following\n2 paragraph, this is a cognizable interest without the need for specific proof in a case.)\n3 Because the Plan (i) strips away substantial legislative safeguards against voter fraud and (ii)\n4 substitutes a mail-in balloting scheme with a substantial risk of fraud, a substantial likelihood of\n5 additional illegal votes exists. That risk is cognizable because โsafeguardsโ are required, Bush, 531\n6 U.S. at 109, and because โconfidence in the integrity of our electoral processes is essential to the\n7 functioning of our participatory democracyโ and โ[v]oter fraud drives honest citizens out of the\n8 democratic process and breeds distrust of our government.โ Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 4\n9 (2006). Similarly, the Seventh Circuit recently stayed an injunction by the U.S. District Court for the\n10 Western District of Wisconsin because it had given inadequate attention to the interest in preventing\n11 voter fraud by eliminating the witness requirement for absentee-ballot signatures: โThis court is\n12 concerned with the overbreadth of the district courtโs order, which categorically eliminates the\n13 witness requirement applicable to absentee ballots and gives no effect to the stateโs substantial\n14 interest in combating voter fraud.โ Democratic National Committee v. Bostelmann, slip op. 3,12 Nos.\n15 20-1538, 20-1539, 20-1545 & 20-1546 (7th Cir. Apr. 3, 2020) (citing Griffin v. Roupas, 385 F.3d\n16 1128, 1130 (7th Cir. 2004)).13\n17 Vote dilution, identified in Reynolds and Bush, supra Part II.A.1, is readily apparent where\n18 illegal votes are allowed because of inadequate safeguards. Only the votes of eligible, registered\n19\n12 The slip opinion could not be found on LEXIS but is available at\n20\nhttps://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/litigation/documents/DNC_v_Bost_BL-30.pdf.\n21\n13 Though the district-court order in Bostelmann, Nos. 3:20-cv-00249-wmc, 3:20-cv-00278-\n22 wmc, 3:20-cv-00284-wmc, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57918 (W.D. Wisc. Apr. 2, 2020), granted\nsome election-related relief based on COVID-19 concerns, other courts have not. See, e.g., Wil-\n23 liams v. DeSantis, No. 1:20-cv-00067 (N.D. Fla.

The Supreme Court\n26\nof New Mexico recently rejected an all-mail-in-ballot plan, instead ordering that absentee-ballot\napplications be mailed to registered voters so they could apply, in State ex rel Riddle v. Oliver,\n27\nNo. S-1-SC-38228 (Ariz. Apr. 16, 2020) (order available at https://cms.nmcourts.gov/up-\n28 loads/files/News/38228%20Final%20Order%20(4-16-20).pdf). \n14\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 15 of 22\n1 voters are supposed to be cast and counted. So every legitimate voter is one of the total number of\n2 legitimate voters. For example, if the legitimate voterโs vote is one of ten legitimate votes cast, her\n3 vote is worth one tenth of the total. But if, in addition, ten illegal votes are cast, her vote is now\n4 worth one twentieth of the total. So her vote was debased by half as a result of vote dilution. That\n5 violates her constitutional right to vote.\n6 In sum, because the weakened safeguards in the requested relief predict dilution and debasement\n7 by illegal voting and create doubt about the legitimacy of the election, the right to vote of eligible,\n8 registered voters is violated.\n9 2. The Plan violates the right to vote for legislative representatives to establish the man-\nner of elections by substituting a scheme that replaces the legislaturesโ plan.\n10\nThe Votersโ right to vote is also violated by the Plan because, while Voters voted for representa-\n11\ntives with plenary power to govern the manner of voting to represent them, they didnโt vote for the\n12\nSecretary and County Administrators to represent them, yet the manner of voting proposed here is\n13\nto be decided by the Secretary and County Administrators instead of the elected representatives in\n14\nthe Legislature. This invalidates Votersโ votes for their representatives in this context. While state\n15\nand local officials face balloting, they are not elected to be representatives of the People in the\n16\nLegislature. That eliminates representation, representatives, and the right to vote for representatives\n17\nin the Legislature to decide the manner of elections. That right to vote is fundamental, Harper, 383\n18\nU.S. at 667, and protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, as well\n19\nas Article 2, ยง 1 of the Nevada Constitution (โAll [qualified voters] shall be entitled to vote for all\n20\nofficers that now or hereafter may be elected by the people, and upon all questions submitted to the\n21\nelectors at such election.โ), and Article 1, ยงยง 8 and 9, which protect against violations of due process\n22\n(including for โlibertyโ deprivation) and free speech rights and so provide protection for the right to\n23\nvote. โUndeniably the Constitution of the United States protects the right of all qualified citizens to\n24\nvote, in state as  well as in federal electionsโ and to have that vote counted. Reynolds, 377 U.S. at\n25\n554.\n26\n27\n28\n15\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 16 of 22\n1 Since the Plan would overrule and replace the representativesโ chosen manner of election, the\n2 Votersโ votes for representatives who would decide the manner of elections is invalidated. That\n3 violates the Votersโ right to vote.\n4 3. The Plan violates the right to vote under the Purcell Principle.\n5 The Plan also violates what has come to be called the Purcell Principle. See, e.g., Richard L.\n6 Hasen, Reining in the Purcell Principle, 43 Fl. St. U. L. Rev. 427 (2016). That Principle is named\n7 for Purcell, 549 U.S. 1. The Principle is anchored in the right to vote and its potential for debase-\n8 ment. Id. at 4 (citing Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 555). Among its critiques of the Ninth Circuit for staying\n9 a voter-identification requirement near an election, the Court held in Purcell that such near-election\n10 court orders themselves risk debasement and dilution of the right to vote because โ[c]ourt orders\n11 affecting elections, especially conflicting orders, can themselves result in voter confusion and\n12 consequent incentive to remain away from the polls. As an election draws closer, that risk will\n13 increase.โ 549 U.S. at 4-5. The โpossibility that qualified voters might be turned away from the\n14 polls,โ id. 4, violates their right to vote. So the general rule is that no court order altering election\n15 procedures near an election is permissible because it violates the right to vote. And because the\n16 Principle is anchored in the right to vote, it applies to state and local election administrators as well\n17 because their election-altering actions pose the same risk.\n18 On April 6, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion in Republican National Committee\n19 v. Democratic National Committee, No. 19A1016, 2020 U.S. LEXIS 2195 (U.S. Apr. 6, 2020) (per\n20 curiam), slip op. available at https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19a1016_o759.pdf,\n21 again applying that Principle, which it summarized thus:\n22 This Court has repeatedly emphasized that lower federal courts should ordinarily not alter\nthe election rules on the eve of an election. See Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U. S. 1 (2006) (per\n23 curiam); Frank v. Walker, 574 U. S. 929 (2014); Veasey v. Perry, 574 U. S. __ (2014). \n24 2020 U.S. LEXIS 2195, at **2-3. This RNC case stayed a lower-court order allowing voters to mail\n25 absentee ballots after election day. RNC recited various problems that the lower-court order posed\n26 and said they โunderscore[] the wisdom of the Purcell principle, which seeks to avoid this kind of\n27 judicially created confusion.โ Id. at **3. A crucial point was that the lower-court order โfundamen-\n28 tally alters the nature of the election.โ Id.\n16\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 17 of 22\n1 The Plan also fundamentally alters the nature of Nevadaโs election, changing it from an in-\n2 person election with actual absentee ballots received by request to a scheme of mailing mail-in\n3 ballots to active, registered voters and highly restricted walk-in voting options. The same risk of\n4 voters losing their franchise because of the confusion caused by this recent Plan exists. For example,\n5 voters are accustomed to going to the polls on election day or requesting an actual absentee ballot.\n6 They may be unaware that the usual options have been replaced with mail-in ballots. They might\n7 show up at their usual polling place on election day to discover there is no poll there, and the usual\n8 whatever-else-happens, in-person, voting opportunity is gone. As noted above, an automatically\n9 mailed mail-in ballot doesnโt alter the disenfranchisement risk because it might be ignored, lost in\n10 a pile of letters set aside for a period before opening to allow any resident viruses to die, not noticed\n11 because the resident voters are sheltering in place at a different location, or some other such possibil-\n12 ity. This fundamental alteration of the nature of the election raises the same possibility of voters\n13 losing their franchise as in Purcell and RNC. Here, as in RNC, the Purcell-Principle should apply\n14 as applicable: โ[W]hen a lower court intervenes and alters the election rules so close to the election\n15 date, our precedents indicate that this Court, as appropriate, should correct that error.โ Slip op. 3. The\n16 same should apply to state and local election administrators who alter election procedures as the Plan\n17 does long after the dates by which the Legislature established that changes must be made to avoid\n18 such disenfranchisement potential. See supra Part I.A.\n19 4. The Plan violates the Votersโ right to have, and to vote in, federal elections with the\nmanner of election is chosen by the legislature (U.S. Const. art I, ยง 4, cl. 1).\n20\nThe Plan violates Votersโ right to have, and to vote in, a federal election where the โMannerโ\n21\nof election is โprescribed . . . by the Legislature,โ as required: \n22\nThe Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall\n23 be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by\nLaw make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.\n24\nU.S. Const. art. I, ยง 4, cl. 1. Candidates for the office of U.S. Representative are on the Primary\n25\nballot. Seehttps://www.nvsos.gov/sos/home/showdocument?id=8461 (Nevada Secretary of State,\n26\nโ2020 Non-Judicial Candidates Filed with the Secretary of Stateโ); Compl. Ex. F. So the Primary\n27\nmust be conducted in the Legislatureโs prescribed manner. But  the Plan is not at all what the Legis-\n28\n17\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 18 of 22\n1 lature chose and is contrary to controlling legislation. See Part I. The Secretary and County Adminis-\n2 trators chose a manner not authorized by the Legislature and contrary to the Legislatureโs choices.\n3 See Part I.A. They have eliminated safeguards against vote fraud that the Legislature chose. See Parts\n4 I.B and II.A.1. So the Plan violates Article I, ยง 4, cl. 1, including a violation of the Voterโs right to\n5 have, and to vote in, such an election as the U.S. Constitution prescribes. \n6 Recall that in Bush the U.S. Supreme Court listed a similar provision requiring that elections\n7 for presidential electors be conducted in the manner chosen by the Legislature as an issue in the case,\n8 but decided that it need not reach it because what the Florida Supreme Court had done fell so woe-\n9 fully short of what was required under the vote-dilution ban that the manner-of-election issue need\n10 not be reached. 551 U.S. at 103 (โwhether the Florida Supreme Court established new standards for\n11 resolving Presidential election contests, thereby violating Art. II, ยง 1, cl. 2, of the United States\n12 Constitutionโ). Similarly here, the parallel manner-of-election provision for other federal elections\n13 is an issue that may not need to be reached because the vote-dilution claims under the fundamental\n14 right to vote can readily decide the case. But if the Court doesnโt decide this case on vote-dilution\n15 or another claim, this issue must be reached. And the Plan violates Article I, ยง 4, cl. 1.\n16 5. The Plan violates the right to a republican form of government under the United\nStates Constitution.\n17\nThe loss of representative government and invalidation of votes for legislators identified in the\n18\npreceding claims violates the Votersโ right to โa republican form of governmentโ under the U.S.\n19\nConstitution. Article IV, ยง 4, of the U.S. Constitution provides that โthe United States shall guarantee\n20\nto every state in this union a republican form of governmentโ (โGuarantee Clauseโ). \n21\nA republican form of government is lost if a Secretary of State and County Administrators\n22\nsupplant the peopleโs elected representative in exercising powers entrusted entirely to the Legisla-\n23\nture, in this case establishing the manner of elections. And since the U.S. Constitution is founded\n24\non and derived from the will of the People who hold the ultimate power, see U.S. Const. preamble\n25\n(โWe the People . . . .โ), the people have a right to the republican government they chose in their own\n26\nexercise of that political will and which the United States guarantees. So the requested relief would\n27\n28\n18\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 19 of 22\n1 violate the very foundational rights of the Voters to a republican form of government and to vote in\n2 manner established under a republican form of government.\n3 Now, Defendants may argue that claims under the Guarantee Clause are nonjusticiable political\n4 questions. That view is rooted in dicta in Luther v. Borden, 48 U.S. 1 (1849). SeeNew York v. United\n5 States, 505 U.S. 144, 184 (1992) (โview . . . has its origin in Lutherโ). But the Supreme Court has\n6 severely cut back on political-question doctrine, starting with Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962),\n7 and continuing with Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. 189 (2012), which restricted\n8 political questions to where there is either โa textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of\n9 [an] issue to a coordinate political departmentโ or โa lack of judicially discoverable and manageable\n10 standards for resolving it,โ id. at 195 (citation omitted). In New York, the Court said โperhaps not\n11 all claims under the Guarantee Clause present nonjusticiable political questions.โ 505 U.S. at 185\n12 (citing Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 582).\n13 In Kerr v. Hickenlooper, 744 F.3d 1156 (10th Cir. 2014), the Tenth Circuit decided that\n14 political-question doctrine didnโt prevent considering a Guarantee Clause claim against a voter-\n15 initiative constitutional amendment, though that was vacated and remanded by Kerr, 135 S. St. 2927\n16 (2015), and ultimately resolved on lack of ordinary Article III standing, 824 F.3d 1207, 1217 (10th\n17 Cir. 2016). Other courts have considered Guarantee Clause claims on the merits. See, e.g., Largess\n18 v. Supreme Judicial Court; Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians v. Superior Court, 148 P.3d\n19 1126, 1137-39 (Cal. 2006); Vansickle v. Shanahan, 511 P.2d 223, 234 (Kan. 1973).\n20 Scholars advocate and foresee Guarantee Clause challenges being allowed by the Supreme\n21 Court. See, e.g., Erwin Chemerinsky, Cases Under the Guarantee Clause Should Be Justiciable, 65\n22 U. Colo. L. Rev. 849, 864-69 (1994); see also id. at 851 (โ[T]he time is clearly approaching in which\n23 the Court may . . . reject the view that cases under the Guarantee Clause should always be dismissed\n24 on political question grounds.โ); Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 398 (2d ed. 1988):\n25 John Hart Ely, Democracy and Distrust: a Theory of Judicial Review 118 n.* (1980).\n26 The Plan presents a case where a Guarantee Clause challenge should not be deemed a political\n27 question. In Clinton, the U.S. Supreme Court limited political questions to where there is either a\n28 clear โconstitutional commitmentโ to some political branch or โa lack of judicially discoverable and\n19\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 20 of 22\n1 manageable standards.โ 566 U.S. at 195. Only the โstandardsโ issue might apply here. While such\n2 โstandardsโ might be difficult in some situations, they are not here. The Plan substitutes the Secretary\n3 and County Administrators for the Legislature in doing the exclusively legislative function of\n4 establishing the โmannerโ of this election. The U.S. Supreme Court would simply need to hold that\n5 in a republican form of government, state and local officials may not usurp the legislative role and\n6 the rule of law and so declare the Plan unconstitutional under the Guarantee Clause and enjoin it. So\n7 the Plan violates the Guarantee Clause and the similar protection of the Nevada Constitution.\n8 *    *    *\n9 In sum, Voters have a strong likelihood of success on all their claims, so that the other\n10 preliminary-injunction elements readily follow, particularly since the right to vote is based on the\n11 First and Fourteenth Amendments. And even were any particular claim deemed to present only\n12 โserious questions going to the merits,โ the preliminary injunction is proper because โโthe balance\n13 of hardships tips sharply in [Votersโ] favorโ and the other two factors are satisfied.โ Short, 893 F.3d\n14 at 675 (citation omitted).\n15 B. Voters have irreparable harm.\n16 Voters have irreparable harm for reasons tracking their claims. They have no remedy at law if\n17 the Plan proceeds and the election is held in violation of Votersโ constitutional rights. If the Plan\n18 proceeds, their right to vote, to have equal protection, and to a federal election compliant with the\n19 federal constitution under Articles I, ยง 4, cl. 1 and IV, ยง 4 will be violated. See supra Part II.A. In\n20 Obama for America, 888 F. Supp. 2d 897 (S.D. Oh. 2012), affโd, 697 F.3d 423, the district court\n21 readily found irreparable harm after finding likely merits success on the right-to-vote claim, id. at\n22 910. That should happen here because constitutional violations caused by the Plan canโt be repaired\n23 after the election.\n24 C. The balance harms favors the injunction.\n25 The balance of harms favors the injunctionโsharply, were that required for any claim. \n26 On Votersโ side are core, fundamental, constitutional rights that are violated by the Plan if it is\n27 allowed to proceed. That typically suffices in constitutional challenges, or else rights arenโt rights.\n28\n20\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 21 of 22\n1 On the Secretary of Stateโs and County Administratorโs side is a Plan that is not authorized by\n2 the Legislature, is in violation of controlling laws, and seems to have been done without considering\n3 fundamental constitutional and rule-of-law mandates that govern their work. Defendants can have\n4 no cognizable interest in advancing the Plan if, as shown, it is highly likely that the Plan violates\n5 constitutional and statutory provisions.\n6 D. The public interest favors the injunction.\n7 The public interest favors following the rule of law by obeying constitutional and statutory\n8 mandates and protecting constitutional rights. The public interest favors having elections held under\n9 controlling authorities. \n10 Now, it is true that Defendants recite the Plan as being responsive to the health risks from the\n11 COVID-19 pandemic, to which Voters are of course sympathetic. And naturally the public has an\n12 interest in health and safety, and the Governor has issued an  Emergency Declaration concerning\n13 coronavirus.  See https://d1q4hslcl8rmbx.cloudfront.net/assets/uploads/2020/03/Declaration-of-\n14 Emergency-re-COVID.pdf; see alsohttp://gov.nv.gov/News/Emergency_Orders/Emergency_Orders/\n15 (Governorโs emergency orders). But that doesnโt mean Defendants can jettison constitutional and\n16 statutory rights and  mandates and fashion a remedy essentially out of whole cloth. Defendantsโ only\n17 options are to do what the controlling constitutional and statutory provisions permitโotherwise the\n18 rule of law fails. Within that rule of law, is where they must find their remedy.\n19 And Defendants do have permissible options that they should be doing instead of their forbidden\n20 Plan. Early and regular voting can be held in compliance with recommendations to practice social\n21 distancing, hand sanitizing, and wearing personal protection equipment, just as people do at the\n22 grocery store and other essential places and functions. To the extent, the Governor were to have the\n23 authority to bar in-person voting by classifying it as nonessential and were to do so  (on which Voters\n24 donโt opine except to note that it would not be consistent with U.S. Constitution Article I, ยง 4, cl.\n25 1 for a federal election), then the normal absentee-ballot process must control. Actual absentee\n26 ballots may be requested and cast under normal procedures and anti-fraud safeguards. Instead of\n27 advising the public that mail-in ballots will be automatically mailed to all active, registered voters,\n28 Defendants should be using their same time and communication channels to tell all registered voters\n21\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 2   Filed 04/21/20   Page 22 of 22\n1 to quickly request an actual absentee ballot and return it as the law requires. That will leave in place\n2 the normal safeguards for actual absentee ballots that are lost with the Plan.\n3 So the public interest favors following the rule of law and abiding by constitutional and statutory\n4 mandates. It favors the requested preliminary injunction.\n5 Conclusion\n6 For the reasons show, this Court should preliminarily enjoin the Plan.\n7\nRespectfully submitted,\n8\n/s/ David OโMara\n9 James Bopp, Jr. (Ind. bar #2838-84)* David OโMara (Nev. bar #8599)\njboppjr@aol.com The OโMara Law Firm, P.C.\n10 Richard E.

Gloria, in his official capacity as Reg-\n19 istrar of Voters for Clark County, Defendants\n20 Introduction1\n21 In the Factual Background, Plaintiffs established (inter alia) the unassailable facts that (i)\n22 across the nation states are reopening from the COVID-19 lockdown and (ii) even during the\n23 lockdown people were permitted to do essential activitiesโsuch as grocery shopping and in-per-\n24 son votingโwith recommended safeguards. The Wisconsin experience showed that in-person\n25\n1 Nomenclature: Established abbreviations and terms in ECF No. 65, e.g., โState Plan,โ\n26 โClark County Plan,โ and โlegislative mandate,โ are retained; official-capacity defendants and\nintervenor-defendants are collectively โDefendantsโ unless context requires otherwise.\n27\n Defendants filed four briefs with overlapping arguments, and ECF no. 33 was 33 pages.\n28 Given that volume and those overlapping arguments, along with the current page limit, Plaintiffs\nrespond generally to some arguments and deal with referenced, particular arguments as needed.\n1\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 2 of 14\n1 voting with recommended safeguards would not spike COVID-19 cases. To the extent some\n2 threat is ongoing now or by election day, for the vast majority, in-person voting with recom-\n3 mended safeguards is no less reasonable a burden than burdens held reasonable in Crawford v.\n4 Marion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181 (2008). So the untailored, overbroad remedy of a mostly\n5 mail-in election is unwarranted and creates the substantial risks of direct and vote-dilution disen-\n6 franchisement from the court-recognized risks of absentee-ballot fraud and a sudden flood of\n7 mailed ballots. Only the legislature has the authority and expertise to balance access and election\n8 integrity issues, and its balancing nowhere created a mostly-mail system, only one that is primar-\n9 ily in-person voting with absentee voting at a usual percentage deemed safe in this state in view\n10 of the recognized absent-ballot-fraud and mass-mailing problems.2 Inverting that scheme means\n11 that both of those harms are now beyond what the legislature found to be safe in this state and so\n12 puts them at issue as substantial risks make the Plans unconstitutional.\n13 I.\nPlaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits because the U.S. Constitutional Amendments I\n14\nand XIV and Article I, ยง 4, cl.1, require Nevada to follow the legislative mandate.\n15\nA. Only the legislature may lawfully balance ballot access with election integrity, so its\nlegislative mandate must be followed and its balancing establishes as a matter of law\n16\nthe presence of disenfranchisement risks.\n17\nIn I.A, Plaintiffs established key, controlling fundamentals. Only the legislature has the au-\n18 thority and expertise to balance ballot access with the known, court-recognized,3 substantial risk\n19\nof illegal voting posed by mail-in ballots and prescribe the manner of an election. The legisla-\n20\ntureโs balancing, expressed in its  โlegislative mandate,โ is that for this state at this time that bal-\n21\nancing requires that the election be predominantly in-person voting with only modest mail-in\n22\nvoting. That prescribed model establishes an approximate percentage of votes that will be mail-in\n23\n24 2 That the legislatureโs binding balancing was correct continues to be born out by evidence.\nSee, e.g., J. Dienst, Close Results In Paterson Vote Plagued By Fraud Claims; Over 3K Ballots\n25\nSeemingly Set Aside, NBC NY, May 20, 2020, www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/close-results-\n26 in-paterson-vote-plagued-by-fraud-claims-over-3k-ballots-seemingly-set-aside/2425813/(โโThere\nis a genuine absentee ballot fraud scandal going on in Paterson,โ said election law expert and\n27\nUniversity of California-Irvine School of Law professor Rick Hasen.โ).\n28 3See ECF No. 65 at 6 (citing court recognition that mail-in ballots pose a substantial risk of\nillegal votes โmaking this a cognizable issue and interest for balancing that need not be provenโ).\n2\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 3 of 14\n1 ballots and reflects the legislatureโs judgment that this usual percentage poses a tolerable risk of\n2 ballot fraud and mailing problems. Thus, the risk of mail-in ballot fraud and mailing problems\n3 are recognized in the legislative mandate and accounted for in the balancing. So going from a\n4 modest amount of mail-in ballots to mostly mail-in ballots makes the risk of ballot fraud and\n5 mailing problems substantial as a matter of legislative finding inherent in its balancing. Making\n6 access overbroad gives inadequate effect to the substantial interests the legislature balanced.\n7 Defendants ignore these controlling fundamentals. None could show that the legislature es-\n8 tablished a mostly mail-in-voting system. The best they could argue was that the legislature al-\n9 lowed the creation of some mailing precincts. But by using the exception to swallow the rule, the\n10 Secretary and County Administrators turned the legislatureโs balancing of ballot access with\n11 mail-in-ballot-fraud and sudden-mailing problems on its head. When Defendants argue that mail-\n12 in-ballot fraud and mailing problems are speculative, they ignore that these substantial risks were\n13 already recognized by (i) courts and (ii) the legislature in its balancing that created a mostly in-\n14 person system with moderate mail-in voting. Recognition of the substantial risks are baked in,\n15 not speculative. \n16 Defendants miss the irony of their saying that the well-established and substantial risks\n17 posed by mail-in- vote fraud and a sudden flood of mail-in ballots is speculative when the foun-\n18 dation of the overbroad Plans was speculative, i.e., that most voters would self-disenfranchise out\n19 of fear that the same recommended safeguards that were used for in-person voting without spik-\n20 ing COVID-19 in Wisconsin might not work for doing essential activity in Nevada so that voters\n21 might get COVID-19, which might be traceable to voting with safeguards, and might be more\n22 than a mild case as most seem to get. Such speculation did not justify the overbroad remedy of\n23 sending mail-in ballots to all active registered voters, let alone inactive ones as in Clark County.\n24 No defendant established that large numbers of voters will self-disenfranchise if they must vote\n25 in person, and recent Wisconsin evidence shows the contrary. โWhile the COVID-19 pandemic\n26 produced an exceptional shift to vote-by-mail [by requested absentee ballots], it is not clear that\n27 the crisis influenced overall participation. The total ballots cast in the Spring Election and Presi-\n28 dential Preference Vote were not markedly different from previous spring elections.โ Wisc.\n3\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 4 of 14\n1 Elecโn Commโn, April 7, 2020: Absentee Voting Report at 4, (May 15, 2020), elec-\n2 tions.wi.gov/sites/elections.wi.gov/files/2020-05/April%202020%20Absentee%20Vot-\n3 ing%20Report.pdf (documenting problems with the sudden flood of mailed ballots4). That means\n4 that the many who voted in person did not self-disenfranchise but relied on the recommended\n5 safeguards used for all essential activities. So the speculation on which the Plans was founded\n6 was unfounded and the overbroad remedy was unjustified.\n7 Because the legislature has authoritatively balanced ballot access and ballot fraud, the legis-\n8 lative mandate must be followed.5 If it is upended as in the Plans, the significant mail-in-ballot\n9 fraud and mailing-problem risks are a substantial, given concern because they are what the legis-\n10 lative mandate authoritatively removed as cognizable concerns through balancing. So it matters\n11 whether the legislative mandate is followed. And it was not followed generally, because the leg-\n12 islature nowhere created a mostly mail-in voting plan, or specifically, because the legislature re-\n13 quired certain steps to even create mailing districts that were not followed, ECF No. 65 at\n14 Facts(B). In Kelly v. Murphy, 79 Nev. 1, 377 P.2d 177 (Nev. 1963), the Nevada Supreme Court\n15 held that phone directions from the Secretary did not constitute making regulations in compliance\n16 with NRS 293.247, so a recount was without legal authorization and a futile act. Following the\n17 legislative mandate requires doing what the legislature requires to make a regulation.\n18 There is no Eleventh Amendment problem because Plaintiffs are not just trying to enforce\n19 state law in federal courts. Rather, failure to follow the legislative mandate established that mail-\n20 in-ballot fraud and mailing problems are cognizable here and so the disenfranchisement risks\n21\n4 โAt a local level, the extraordinary volume placed enormous stress on election officials,\n22\nelections systems, and the [USPS].โ Id. at 3. โWith nearly six times more ballots in circulation,\nthe number of complaints and concerns increased by a similar amount. Some voters also reported\n23\nnot receiving their absentee ballots while others reported that their completed ballots were not\n24 returned to the clerk in a timely fashion.โ Id. at 12. Yet by-request ballots comprised 61.8%,\n12.6% voted early in person, and 25.6% voted in person on election day. Id. at 6. The Report\n25\nconfirmed the reported โthree tubsโ of undelivered absentee ballots found by the USPS. Id. at 16.\n26 5 The legislative mandate must also be followed because the Elections Clause, U.S. Const.\nart. I, ยง 4, cl.1, requires it as federal candidates are on the ballot. But wholly apart from that, it\n27\nmust be followed because inherent within it is the restriction of mail-in-ballot fraud to the ap-\n28 proximate percentage that the legislature deemed safe for this state in this election, as is the legis-\nlatureโs determination of what is safe regarding mail problems.\n4\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 5 of 14\n1 flow from that as a matter of law given the legislative balancing. There is no Eleventh Amend-\n2 ment issue where Plaintiffs seek to have the legislative mandate followed because not doing so\n3 violates their fundamental right to vote protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The\n4 Eleventh Amendment provides no shield for state officials acting in their official capacities when\n5 plaintiffs request prospective injunctive relief to vindicate such rights. See, e.g., Doe v. Lawrence\n6 Livermore Natโl Lab, 131 F.3d 836, 839 (9th Cir. 1997); Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).\n7 Plaintiffs established that what other states do and what other safeguards exist donโt justify\n8 the inversion of the legislatureโs balancing because only the legislature has the authority and ex-\n9 pertise to balance ballot access and election integrity. Its balancing governs what is required and\n10 safe for this state, so all that the legislature mandated is essential. One cannot properly say that,\n11 because other safeguards exist, election administrators may invert the balancing.\n12 Consequently, the Secretary and County Administrators were required to accommodate\n13 COVID-19 concerns within the legislative mandate, like Wisconsin did, not invert that mandate.\n14 B. Discarding the legislatureโs balance of in-person and mail-in voting and throwing mail-\nin voting open to all violates the right to vote by causing numerous voters to suffer di-\n15 rect disenfranchisement.\n16 In I.B, Plaintiffs established that, based on the legislatureโs balancing of in-person and by-\n17 request absentee-ballot voting in the legislative mandate, throwing mail-in voting open to all\n18 would violate the right to vote by causing numerous voters to suffer direct disenfranchisement.\n19 Again, Plaintiffs relied expressly on the legislatureโs balancing and not prescribing a mostly mail\n20 election, ECF No. 65 at 12-15, which โestablishes the disenfranchisement harm as a matter of\n21 law,โ id. at 15. As established, supra at I.A, Defendants ignore the legislative balancing and man-\n22 date and act as if the Secretary and County Administrators are free to ignore it in election admin-\n23 istration. They are not. In addition to expressly relying on the legislatureโs balancing and man-\n24 date, Plaintiffs provided evidence of disenfranchisement from a sudden increase in mail-in bal-\n25 lots. So Plaintiffs have a non-speculative, substantial, personal risk of direct disenfranchisement,\n26 which is a sufficient harm for standing,6 and it is caused by the Plans, and a holding of likely suc-\n27\n6 Intervenor-Defendants never established that voters will self-disenfranchise or will get\n28 COVID-19 from in-person voting (and the Wisconsin experience establishes otherwise)โonly\nsome risk of such. The same must apply to Plaintiffs, so a substantial likelihood suffices.\n5\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 6 of 14\n1 cess and a preliminary injunction will remedy the harm.7\n2 Given standing, Defendants (not Plaintiffs) must justify the Plans under the test in Burdick v.\n3 Takushi, 504 U.S. 428 (1992), because the burdens here follow those at trial. And because disen-\n4 franchisement is a severe harm, Defendants must prove their broad remedy narrowly tailored to a\n5 compelling interest. But relying on standing arguments, Defendants didnโt meet that burden.\n6 Plaintiffs established that in-person voting with recommended safeguards is similarly safe to\n7 other in-person essential activities with recommended safeguards, that Wisconsin in-person vot-\n8 ing didnโt spike COVID-19 levels, and that such burdens were no greater than the burdens held\n9 โreasonableโ in Crawford, 553 U.S. 181. So for most people, there was no unreasonable burden\n10 and as a result the overbroad, facial remedy of mailing ballots to all active (let alone, inactive)\n11 registered voters was not narrowly tailored. To the extent there is an interest in protecting those\n12 specially at risk, the Plans failed to target them. So the Plans violate the right to vote by direct\n13 disenfranchisement and are unjustified under the Burdick balancing analysis.\n14 C. Discarding the legislatureโs determination that voting should be primarily in person,\nand mailing absentee ballots without request violates the right to vote by causing nu-\n15 merous voters to suffer vote-dilution disenfranchisement. \n16 In I.C. of the opening brief, Plaintiffs relied again on the legislatureโs balancing and determi-\n17 nation that voting should be primarily in person and its requirement that absentee ballots be by\n18 request to establish the substantial risk of illegal votes as a matter of law based on that balancing\n19 and legislative mandate. And they relied on the fact that courts have recognized the substantial\n20 risk of absentee-ballot fraud. So they were not required to prove there is such a substantial risk,\n21 which was amplified many times by abandoning the percentage of such votes that the legislature\n22 found safe and offering mail-in ballots to all active (and inactive in Clark County) registered vot-\n23 ers. Plaintiff supplemented that with some examples, but they were not required to because the\n24 problem is court-recognized and inherent in the legislatureโs balancing and mandate. This sub-\n25\n7 The suggestion that County Administrators who were not sued would not abide by this\n26 Courtโs injunction fails. The Defendants fail to note that Plaintiffs have requested a declaration\nthat the Secretaryโs approval of the County Administratorsโ mail-in balloting plan is unconstitu-\n27\ntional. This declaration of unconstitutionality would void the Secretaryโs approval of all the coun-\n28 tiesโ mail-in balloting plan. Anyway, Plaintiffs are from named-defendant counties so the relief\nwould directly benefit them.\n6\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 7 of 14\n1 stantial risk is not speculative because it is court-recognized and legislature balanced, and as with\n2 direct disenfranchisement, a substantial risk of vote-dilution suffices for standing (just as\n3 Intervenors did not establish that in-person voters will self-disenfranchise or will get COVID-19).\n4 Plaintiffs also established that theirs is clearly not a generalized grievance by a careful analy-\n5 sis of the actual language and meaning of Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992).\n6 They established that the issue is not how many have this grievance but whether they are merely\n7 trying to make the government do its job, which they are not. They are seeking relief for viola-\n8 tions of their fundamental rights. And they established that they are not at the general level of\n9 mere โcitizenโ but are at three levels of specificity beyond that. citizens. They are among that\n10 subset who can actually have their vote diluted. Defendants ignore this clear showing.\n11 Two cited, non-controlling cases, donโt alter this fact. ECF No. 74 at 17. ACRU v. Martinez-\n12 Rivera, 166 F. Supp. 3d 779 (W.D. Tex. 2105), involved review of a magistrateโs report, so un-\n13 objected findings were reviewed only for clear error. ACRU did not object to the magistrateโs\n14 finding that โundermined voter confidence and potential vote dilution[] merely amount to gener-\n15 alized grievances about the government, which do not give rise to associational standingโ and the\n16 court found no clear error. Id. at 787. But in that case the argument was not that the legislature\n17 had already done a balancing concerning the risk of vote dilution, the abandonment of which nec-\n18 essarily presented a substantial risk beyond what the legislature had decided was permissible, but\n19 only that failure to purge voting rolls (under the National Voter Registration Act) might result in\n20 vote dilution. That substantially differs in kind, and present Plaintiffs have a direct harm caused\n21 by abandoning the legislative mandate where actual voting is occurring. And Plaintiffs do object\n22 to, not acquiesce in, the assertion that theirs is a generalized grievance, which they have shown it\n23 not to be in clear detail. So it would be clear error to find it here.\n24 United States v. Florida, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189624 (N.D. Fla. 2012), involved an effort\n25 to intervene by โfour individuals [who] sa[id] that if people are improperly registered to vote it\n26 will dilute the votes of properly registered voters,โ id. at *4, and they (and members of Judicial\n27 Watch) were held to have only the generalized interest of โevery other registered voter in the\n28 state,โ id. (True the Vote asserted a different interestโmonitoring voter-registration listsโbut as\n7\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 8 of 14\n1 there was no interference with that it was not allowed to intervene. Id. at *5-6.) As with ACRU,\n2 no actual voting was underway with an inversion of the legislatureโs balancing that of itself raises\n3 the dilution problem and makes it substantial because it is not within the bounds that the legisla-\n4 ture deemed safe for this state. And neither case involved a sudden flood of mail-in votes.\n5 D. Discarding the legislative mandate violates U.S. Constitution Article I, ยง 4, cl. 1, which\nmandates that the legislature prescribe the manner of election.\n6\nIn I.D, Plaintiffs established that as federal candidates are on the ballot, this election must be\n7\nconducted in the legislatureโs prescribed manner. That manner was primarily in-person voting\n8\nwith a moderate percentage of by-request absentee-ballot votingโat the level the legislature de-\n9\ntermined the substantial, court-recognized risks from absentee-ballot fraud and a sudden flood of\n10\nmail-in ballots were safe. By inverting that balancing, the Plans are not the manner the legislature\n11\nprescribed, and Plaintiffs have further detailed the noncompliance with the legislative mandate.\n12\nECF No. 65 at 3-6.  Why following the legislative mandate is vital is based on the legislatureโs\n13\nauthority and expertise for balancing access and election integrity as explained in I.A, so whether\n14\nthere is a private cause of action for this claim does not matter to that controlling analysis. Defen-\n15\ndants have cited no case holding there is not a private cause of action for this claim, and Plain-\n16\ntiffs believe it is properly assertable, just as a parallel manner clause was at issue in Bush but not\n17\ndecided because the case was decided on a one-person-one-vote equal-protection analysis.\n18\nE. The Clark County Plan to enhance its votersโ strength violates the equal-protection\n19 and right-to-vote rights of voters in other counties under one-person-one-vote doctrine.\n20 In Count IV, Plaintiffs challenged the Clark County Plan under the one-person-one-vote doc-\n21 trine for two things only: (1) mailing to inactive voters and (2) sending county approved ballot\n22 harvesters. ECF No. 64 at ยถ 126. Plaintiffs nowhere challenged the establishment of more polling\n23 places in Count IV, merely mentioning extra polling places in describing what Clark County had\n24 done. Id. at ยถ 39. The same is true of Plaintiffsโ preliminary-injunction memo, which nowhere\n25 argues that the extra polling places are a violation of one-person-one-vote doctrine. ECF No. 65\n26 at 21-23. Plaintiffs believe that in-person voting with recommended safeguards (along with by-\n27 request absentee ballots) was Nevadaโs proper response to COVID-19 concerns. That would be\n28 within the legislative mandate (instead of inverting the legislatureโs balancing) and more polling\n8\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 9 of 14\n1 places facilitate that. Plaintiffs noted that Clark County is the most populous county, ECF No. 65\n2 at 22, so the fact that it would have proportionally more polling places would be expected. So\n3 arguments attacking a supposed challenge to extra polling places are strawman arguments. See,\n4 e.g., ECF Nos. 75 at 2-3 and 77 at 3.\n5 Plaintiffs established that giving one county greater voting strength than others violates the\n6 one-person-one-vote doctrine in violation of the Equal Protection Clause and the fundamental\n7 right to vote under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. ECF No. 65 at 21-23. And sending\n8 unrequested mail-in ballots to inactive voters and sending county-approved ballot harvesters will\n9 ensure that more ballots are collected from voters of Clark County (who largely have a certain\n10 political persuasion, which Defendants donโt deny) than in other counties (largely of a different\n11 political persuasion)โwith the difference not accounted for by population differences. Id.\n12 The Clark County Registrar says there is no right to vote in a manner of oneโs choosing. ECF\n13 No. 75 at 4. But that is not the issue here. The issue generally is violation of the legislatureโs\n14 manner, which balanced and protected against harms that are now at issue by the inversion of its\n15 manner. And specifically, the issue here is about giving voters in one county greater voting\n16 power than voters in other counties, though all have the same manner of voting, i.e., mostly mail-\n17 in voting with modest in-person voting. So this argument is beside the point.\n18 The Secretary says โNRS ยง 293.345(1) is silent on whether ballots may be mailed to inactive\n19 votersโ and so defers. ECF No. 78 at 7. But there is a relevant regulation, NAC 293.412: \n20 (4)(a) A city or county clerk (a): Is not required to send a sample ballot to an inactive\nvoter. (b) Is required to send an absent ballot to an inactive voter if the inactive voter\n21 requests: (1) An absent ballot pursuant to the provisions of NRS 293.313 or 293C.310, as\napplicable; or (2) A military-overseas ballot pursuant to the provisions of chapter 293B of\n22 NRS.โ \n23 That is not silent, deals with inactive voters, and nowhere authorizes absentee ballots for inactive\n24 voters without request. Conversely, it requires inactive voters to request absentee ballots. That\n25 must be followed absent a properly promulgated regulation replacing it. As held in Kelly, 79 Nev.\n26 1, 377 P.2d 177, regulations must be made in compliance with NRS 293.247, and ad hoc,\n27 noncompliant actions in violation of existing regulations are โfutileโ acts โwithout legal authoriza-\n28 tion.โ This regulation speaks to the requirements for inactive registered voters getting an absentee\n9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 10 of 14\n1 ballot and remain unchanged. So it should have been followed by the Secretary and Registrar.\n2 Mailing absentee ballots to inactive registered voters was and is without legal authorization. \n3 The Clark County Registrar tries to distinguish Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000), on the\n4 grounds that it involved a different situation. ECF No. 75 at 4. But most cases can be distin-\n5 guished factually and that doesnโt vitiate their controlling analysis in applicable circumstances,\n6 such as this. Plaintiffs set out the applicable analysis that Bush summarized from prior cases to\n7 the effect that the voters of one county may not be given โgreater voting strength.โ ECF No. 65 at\n8 22. Distinguishing Bush on superficial facts does not address that prior case line. Bush did say\n9 that local entities could use โdifferent technologiesโ or โsystemsโ for voting, as the Clark County\n10 Registrar notes, but that isnโt the issue here. Nor is this like the cases the Registrar cites involv-\n11 ing traceable ballots and changing voting days. And because the Secretary defers to the Registrar\n12 about sending absentee ballots to inactive voters, this is like the statewide situation in Bush\n13 where the central authority allowed different standards in different counties. Not only is the Clark\n14 County Plan contrary to the Secretaryโs own regulation at NAC 293.412, it is contrary to the Sec-\n15 retaryโs own Planโpresumably based on her own balancing that excludes sending ballots to in-\n16 active registered voters, or it has no rational basisโyet the Secretary permits this difference in\n17 voting power between different counties. So this case is like Bush and the prior cases it cited in\n18 which there existed a difference in voting power between counties approved by a state-wide au-\n19 thority. That extra power has real-world results. As Plaintiffs already established, extra mining of\n20 mail-in ballots in the most populous county of a certain persuasion will garner many more votes\n21 of the dominant political persuasion in that county, just like the effort to mine extra votes in cer-\n22 tain counties in Florida in Bush targeted large counties of a preferred political persuasion. In\n23 close elections, those extra votes change results. An the claimed purpose of mailing to inactive\n24 registered voters and county-approved ballot harvesters is to increase the number of votesโif\n25 not it fails for lack of a rational basisโand only Clark County has this extra voting power. That\n26 clearly violates the equal-protection and right-to-vote rights of voters outside Clark County who\n27 do not have the same voting power.\n28 Notably, Intervenors donโt challenge standing for this claim, ECF No. 72 at 11, recognizing\n10\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 11 of 14\n1 that standing to challenge vote-dilution harm is a given in equal-protection cases. Instead, they\n2 say this case is foreclosed by Short v. Brown, 893 F.3d 671 (9th Cir. 2018). ECF No. 72 at 11-12.\n3 But Short doesnโt control for at least three reasons. First, Plaintiffs donโt argue that the Clark\n4 County Plan makes it harder for them to vote, so quotes to the effect that it doesnโt are beside the\n5 point. Second, because Plaintiffs donโt challenge this Plan for making it harder to vote, the notion\n6 that rational-basis scrutiny applies because mail-in voting makes it easier to vote is beside the\n7 point. Third, the part of Short that Intervenors ignore is the part that controls. Note that Short\n8 only involved the phasing in of mail-in voting in California, id. at 674-75, and voters in non-all-\n9 mail counties claimed their vote was diluted by votes in all-mail counties because mail-in voting\n10 was easier. After rejecting that argument, which Plaintiffs donโt make, the Ninth Circuit said this\n11 case is โnothing likeโ the line of cases that Plaintiffs cited from Bush that found an equal-protec-\n12 tion violation where some counties are given greater voting strength, id. at 678-78. In those\n13 disparate-voting-strength cases, strict scrutiny applies because violation of equal protection and\n14 vote-dilution disenfranchisement are severe harms. And under strict scrutiny, it is the burden of\n15 Clark County, and of the Secretary who allowed the disparate voting strength in contravention of\n16 her own State Plan, to establish that it is narrowly tailored to a compelling interest, which they\n17 have made no effort to do. Nor could they because there is no justification, even amid COVID-19\n18 concerns, to empower one county over another. The Clark County Plan must be enjoined as to\n19 the two parts actually challenged.\n20 II.\nA preliminary injunction is necessary to prevent irreparable harm\n21\nto Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights.\n22\nPlaintiff have irreparable harm for the reasons established in Part II of their opening brief.\n23\nECF No. 65. Violations of constitutional rights are irreparable harm. Arguments to the contrary\n24\nfocus on standing, but Plaintiffs have explained why their claims are not speculative and not gen-\n25\neralized grievances, and for Count IV Intervenors donโt dispute standing under equal protection.\n26 III.\nThe balance of equities and the public interest support injunctive relief.\n27\nThe balance of equities and the public interest support the injunctive relief Plaintiffs request\n28\n11\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 80   Filed 05/21/20   Page 12 of 14\n1 for reasons established in Part II of their opening brief. ECF No. 65. \n2 The Washoe County Registrar adds a whole section based on Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S.\n3 1 (2006). ECF NO. 74 at 30-33, claiming that the requested relief would require โelection offi-\n4 cials ... [to] have to scrambleโ to comply and that doing so would โplac[e] into question the in-\n5 tegrity of the th[e] primary election.โ Id. at 32-33. But the Plans place into question the integrity\n6 of the election as detailed above. The requested relief that (i) acknowledges that Plaintiffs are\n7 substantially likely to succeed on their claims that the Plans violate the federal constitution and\n8 (ii) corrects the unconstitutional Plans will enhance the integrity of the election. That is the point\n9 of constitutional rights and the rule of law. If the problems identified are not corrected the elec-\n10 tion will be of dubious integrity with no assurance that electoral outcomes are correct.\n11 And what Defendants want is for the Secretary and County Administrators to be able them-\n12 selves to make a late-breaking inversion of the legislatureโs balancing, and for Clark County to\n13 do so even later, while those whose constitutional rights are violated by those late-breaking ac-\n14 tions are shut out from the constitutional relief to which they would normally be entitled.\n15 Conclusion\n16 For the reasons shown, this Court should preliminarily enjoin the Plan and provide the relief\n17 in the Amended Complaintโs Prayer for Relief.\n18 May 21, 2020 Respectfully submitted,\n19 David OโMara (Nev. bar #8599) /s/ Amanda L.

INTRODUCTION \n3  Little has changed since Plaintiffsโ first motion for a preliminary injunction. The \n4  relevant facts are as stated in the Courtโs order dated April 30, 2020.  See Paher v. \n5  Cegavske, ___ F. Supp.3d ___, 2020 WL 2089813, *2โ4 (D. Nev. 2020).  Plaintiffs did not \n6  seek reconsideration of the Courtโs April 30, 2020 order, as provided for by Rule 60(b) of \n7  the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Plaintiffs did not seek expedited appellate review \n8  premised on the irreparable harm associated with mail-in voting for the June 9, 2020 \n9  primary, for which the counties have already mailed ballots.   \n10  Instead, Plaintiffs waited two weeks to file an amended complaint that rehashes \n11  the original challenge to the legal and statutory basis for the decision by state and local \n  12  election officials to implement an all-mail primary election for June 9, 2020.  The second \n13  motion is a notably cumbersome read, 24 pages in total, because it simply repeats all of \n14  the legal arguments from the original motion, with a few new bells and whistles.  Simply \n15  stated, it a retread, and yet it comes a full two weeks after the Courtโs decision on the \n16  first motion for preliminary injunction.  The inexplicable 2-week delay makes this Courtโs \n17  Purcell concerns from the April 30, 2020 order even more applicable than before, and \n18  further justifies the application of the equitable doctrine of laches.   \n19  As a matter of law, Plaintiffsโ second motion for preliminary injunction specifically \n20  takes issue with the Courtโs conclusion that the Washoe County registrar appears to have \n21  satisfied the notice requirement of NRS ยง 293.213(5), even though notice was provided \n22  after the March deadlines described at NRS ยง 293.205 and .206. (ECF. No 65 at 4โ6). See \n23  Paher, 2020 WL 2089813, *10. Plaintiffs neglect to explain why this warrants a second \n24  motion given the Courtโs finding that the issue is rendered moot by Plaintiffsโ lack of \n25  standing.  See id.  Nothing argued by Plaintiffs suggests any new basis for standing here.   \n26  From a factual standpoint, Plaintiffsโ second motion is likewise bereft of substance.   \n27  Plaintiffs anxiously describe some new developments in Clark County: specifically the \n28  implementation  of  an  election  plan  that  โgives  voters  advantages  over  other-county \n-2- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC     Document 77     Filed 05/20/20     Page 3 of 11\n1  voters, including by (i) sending absent ballots to inactive voters and, as reported, โallow a \n2  bipartisan group of deputized โfield registrarsโ to collect sealed ballots from voters.โ (ii) \n3  creating more vote centers than other Nevada counties.โ (ECF No. 64 at 2:12โ15).   By \n4  now  complaining  of  more  vote  centers  (which  presumably  allow  for  more  in-person \n5  voting), Plaintiffs contradict the rationale for their first motion.  While the first motion \n6  advanced  the  speculative proposition  that  less  in-person  voting  would  facilitate  voter \n7  fraud,  the  second  motion  expresses  concern  about  Clark  Countyโs  decision  to  expand \n8  opportunities for in-person voting.  If there is a hearing on this retread motion, Plaintiffs \n9  should explain their change in position on the merits of more in-person voting.    \n10  As to Plaintiffsโ first point about inactive voters and field registrars, they fall back \n11  on the same speculative, unsupported allegations of vote dilution that this court has \n  12  already rejected.  Under Nevada law, Clark County election officials have the discretion \n13  to  determine  the  best  methods  of  reaching  voters  in  their  large,  populous,  and \n14  geographically diverse county.  Plaintiffs do not identify how the addition of vote centers, \n15  or the decision to mail ballots to inactive voters, runs afoul of Nevadaโs election statutes. \n16  Plaintiffsโ  demand  for  injunctive  relief  continues  to  be  grounded  in  their  unprovable \n17  assertion that vote-by-mail processes are inferior to in-person processes as a means of \n18  combatting voter fraud. No evidence has been provided warranting reconsideration of this \n19  courtโs prior order on this issue.   \n20  This  is  ultimately  a  policy  argument  that  Plaintiffs  must  pursue  through \n21  legislative channels, not through civil rights litigation at this belated hour.  Injunctive \n22  relief remains unwarranted in this case.              \n23  II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW1  \n24  Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows defendants to seek \n25  dismissal of a claim or action for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Dismissal under \n                                                 \n26 \n1 This section covers only the standard of review for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) \n27  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The standard for issuance of a preliminary \ninjunction is discussed in the Secretaryโs opposition to Plaintiffโs original motion for a \n28 \npreliminary injunction. (ECF No. 28 at 3-4). In the interest of brevity, the discussion is \nnot repeated here.   \n-3- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC     Document 77     Filed 05/20/20     Page 4 of 11\n1  Rule 12(b)(1) is appropriate if the complaint, considered in its entirety, fails to allege facts \n2  on its face that are sufficient to establish subject matter jurisdiction.  In re Dynamic \n3  Random Access Memory (DRAM) Antitrust Litigation, 546 F.3d 981, 984โ85 (9th Cir. \n4  2008). \n5  Although the defendant is the moving party in a motion to dismiss brought under \n6  Rule 12(b)(1), the plaintiff is the party invoking the courtโs jurisdiction.  As a result, the \n7  plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the case is properly in federal court.  McCauley \n8  v. Ford Motor Co., 264 F.3d 952, 957 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing McNutt v. General Motors \n9  Acceptance  Corp.,  298  U.S.  178,  189  (1936)).    Federal  courts  are  courts  of  limited \n10  jurisdiction. Owen Equip. & Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U.S. 365, 374 (1978).  A federal \n11  court  is  presumed  to  lack  jurisdiction  in  a  particular  case  unless  the  contrary \n  12  affirmatively appears.  Stock West, Inc. v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, \n13  873 F.2d 1221, 1225 (9th Cir. 1989).  Thus, federal subject matter jurisdiction must exist \n14  at the time an action is commenced.  Mallard Auto. Grp., Ltd. v. United States, 343 F. \n15  Supp. 2d 949, 952 (D. Nev. 2004). \n16  Article III, ยง 2 of the U.S. Constitution states that the federal courts may only \n17  adjudicate โCasesโ and โControversiesโ.  See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, \n18  559 (1992).  The case-or-controversy requirement of Article III requires that Plaintiffs \n19  establish their โstandingโ as a jurisdictional prerequisite to the prosecution of this law \n20  suit.    Clapper  v.  Amnesty  International  USA,  586  U.S.  398,  408  (2013).    The  Court \n21  discussed the elements of standing in its decision of April 30, 2020.  See Paher, 2020 WL \n22  2089813, *4โ5.  \n23  As the Court previously held, see Paher, 2020 WL 2089813, *5, Plaintiffs do not \n24  have standing to pursue allegations that their votes have been diluted in violation of \n25  rights guaranteed by the First and the Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \n26  At this early point in the election cycle, no votes have even been counted.  Until the votes \n27  have been counted and the 2020 primary election has run its course, it is impossible to \n28  know  whether  anyoneโs  vote  will  be  diluted.    Plaintiffs  speculate  that  the  election-\n-4- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC     Document 77     Filed 05/20/20     Page 5 of 11\n1  integrity  and  anti-fraud  measures  in  place  for  the  2020  primary  election  are  not \n2  sufficiently robust to prevent voter fraud.   Without evidence, Plaintiffs offer no reason \n3  why this Court should reconsider its prior order on the same legal issue in this case.   \n4  Ultimately, the search for the proper balance between voter access and election-\n5  integrity  considerations  is  a  matter  for  policy  makers,  not  federal  courts.    Plaintiffsโ \n6  amended complaint must be dismissed on the ground that the Court lacks subject matter \n7  jurisdiction over their claims.         \n8  III.  ARGUMENT \n9  A. Plaintiffsโ New Factual Allegations Do Not Satisfy the Standing Requirement \n10  Plaintiffs continue to challenge the decisions that state and local elections officials \n11  have made in preparation for the June 9, 2020 primary election.  At this point, their \n  12  principal complaint concerns the decision by elections officials in Clark County to open \n13  two additional vote centers, mail ballots to inactive voters, and task certain elections \n14  officials with the responsibility of collecting paper ballots at locations other than the \n15  established vote centers.  These decisions, they claim, will create โa flood of ballotsโ in \n16  Clark County, presumably fraudulent, that will lead to Plaintiffsโ disenfranchisement.    \n17  (ECF No.at 8โ10).  This argument is no less speculative than their previous argument \n18  that statewide vote-by-mail processes would cause their disenfranchisement.  \n19  Plaintiffs  have  simply  modified their argument  slightly,  claiming  now  that  the \n20  conditions in Clark County will favor urban voters to the detriment of rural voters. (ECF \n21  No. 64 at 2:12โ15; ECF No. 65 at 22:1โ9).  Plaintiffs do not allege, however, that their \n22  ability to access the polls in Washoe County has been unconstitutionally impeded.  To the \n23  contrary, they express an eagerness to vote, and no reservations about their ability to \n24  access the polls.  (ECF No. 64 at 3โ4).  Insofar as their renewed motion and amended \n25  complaint are premised upon the alleged preferential treatment of Clark County voters, \n26  their grievance appears to be grounded in a desire to  reduce voter turnout in Clark \n27  County rather than increase voter turnout in Washoe County.  (ECF No. 65 at 22:1โ9). \n28  They cite not a single federal case that supports their argument for adopting measures on \n-5- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC     Document 77     Filed 05/20/20     Page 6 of 11\n1  a statewide basis to equalize voter turnout between urban and rural areas in Nevada. \n2  Assuming that such equalization is desirable from a policy standpoint, Plaintiffs might \n3  perhaps explore the possibility of making the polls more accessible in the rural parts of \n4  the state. \n5  Indeed, Plaintiffsโ federal lawsuit is misguided and runs contrary to principles of \n6  federalism and separation of powers.  The discretionary decisions of an executive branch \n7  official, including an election official, must typically be challenged in state court through a \n8  petition for judicial review, as provided by NRS ยง 233B.130, or by way of writ proceedings \n9  when judicial review in not available under the Nevada Administrative Procedures Act. \n10  See NRS Chapter 34; Kay v. Nunez, 122 Nev. 1100, 146 P.3d 801 (2006) (โHere, Kay \n11  understandably challenged the district court's order through both a petition for judicial \n  12  review and a petition for a writ of mandamus. As the petition for judicial review was the \n13  proper  mechanism  .  .  .  Kay's  writ  petition  was  inappropriate.โ).    There  are  limited \n14  methods for challenging agency decisions, such as those at issue here, because โ[t]he \n15  courts  must  be  wary  not  to  tread  upon  the  prerogatives  of  other  departments  of \n16  government or to assume or utilize any undue powers.  Galloway v. Truesdell, 83 Nev. 13, \n17  31, 422 P.2d 237, 249 (1967).  โIf this is not done, the balance of powers will be disturbed \n18  and  that  cannot  be  tolerated  for  the  strength  of  our  system  of  government  and  the \n19  judiciary itself is based upon that theory.โ  Id.    \n20  Proceedings to obtain a writ of mandamus would typically be the proper method for \n21  compelling the Secretary of State to issue an order to county clerks requiring that they \n22  establish no more than one vote center per county, mail ballots to active voters only, and \n23  refrain from using field registrars. NRS ยง 34.160 states that mandamus may be used โto \n24  compel the performance of an act which the law especially enjoins as a duty resulting \n25  from an office, trust or station.โ  But โ[m]andamus will not lie to control discretionary \n26  action, unless discretion is manifestly abused or is exercised arbitrarily or capriciously.โ \n27  Round Hill General Improvement District v. Newman, 97 Nev. 601, 603-04, 637 P.2d 534, \n28  536 (1981).  Moreover, โ[a]n agencyโs interpretation of a statute that it is authorized to \n-6- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC     Document 77     Filed 05/20/20     Page 7 of 11\n1  execute is entitled to deference โunless it conflicts with the constitution or other statutes, \n2  exceeds  the  agencyโs  powers,  or  is  otherwise  arbitrary  and  capricious.โโ  Nuleaf  CLV \n3  Dispensary, LLC v. State, Department of Health and Human Servs., 134 Nev. 129, 133, \n4  414 P.3d 305, 308 (2017). (quoting Cable v. State ex rel. Empโrs Ins. Co. of Nev., 122 Nev. \n5  120, 126, 127 P.3d 528, 532 (2006)). \n6  Here, NRS ยง 293.345(1) is silent as to whether ballots may be mailed to inactive \n7  voters as well as active voters.  The Secretary has deferred to the discretion of Clark \n8  County election officials regarding the decision to mail ballots to inactive voters.  This \n9  decision is entitled to deference because it was not arbitrary and capricious, nor did it \n10  exceed the powers granted to the Secretary of State pursuant to NRS ยง 293.247.   \n11  The same is true of the Secretaryโs decision to give county clerks the discretion to \n  12  establish the appropriate number of polling locations and field registrars within their \n13  individual  counties, based  upon  fiscal  concerns,  staffing  and  training  challenges, and \n14  related  logistical  complications.    As  a  matter  of  state  law  over  which  the  Secretary \n15  ultimately has enforcement authority, the resource allocation decisions of local elections \n16  officials are not subject to review by the federal courts.  See Pennhurst State School & \n17  Hospital  v.  Halderman,  465  U.S.  89,  106  (1984)  (โ[T]he  principles  of  federalism that \n18  underlie the Eleventh Amendmentโ prohibit a federal court from granting โrelief against \n19  state officials on the basis of state law, whether prospective or retroactive.โ).      \n20   With respect to alleged violations of federal law, the decisions in question are \n21  entitled to judicial deference under the Anderson-Burdick balancing test, as discussed in \n22  the Courtโs order of April 30, 2020.  See Paher, 2020 WL 2089813, *4โ5.  However, the \n23  Court need not repeat the Anderson-Burdick analysis from its prior decision because \n24  Plaintiffs have not alleged any new facts that would give them standing to pursue their \n25  claims under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and the U.S. Constitution.2  In fact, their new allegations \n26 \n                                                 \n27  2  Just  in  case  the  Court  is  inclined  to  revisit  its  findings  on  the  questions  of \nstanding or relative burdens (Anderson-Burdick), the Secretary incorporates herein by \n28 \nreference the arguments set forth in her opposition to Plaintiffsโ first motion for injunctive \nrelief. (ECF No. 28).     \n-7- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC     Document 77     Filed 05/20/20     Page 8 of 11\n1  contradict their previous argument as to why they have standing.  Plaintiffs previously \n2  argued that vote-by-mail processes are vulnerable to manipulation and fraud, such that \n3  their votes would likely be diluted by illegal votes. (ECF No. 1, at 9:8โ24; ECF No. 2 at 5โ\n4  6).  But now they object to the addition of in-person voting processes in Clark County \n5  despite  their  prior  assertion  that  in-person  processes  are  superior  to  vote-by-mail \n6  processes. (ECF No. 64 at 2:14โ15, 9:11โ12).  In summary, Plaintiffs have not bolstered \n7  their argument that they have standing to pursue their claims in federal court.  Their \n8  claims remain as speculative as ever.   \n9  B. Plaintiffs Fail to Connect the Notice Issue to Their Alleged Injury \n10  In their second motion for injunctive relief, Plaintiffs are unusually critical of the \n11  Courtโs finding that the Washoe County registrar appears to have satisfied the notice \n  12  requirement  of  NRS  ยง  293.213(5),  even  though  notice  was  provided  after  the  March \n13  deadlines described at NRS ยง 293.205 and .206. (ECF. No 65 at 4โ6). See Paher, 2020 WL \n14  2089813,  *10.    However,  Plaintiffs  do  not  explain  how  the  alleged  notice  deficiency \n15  contributed to their supposed injury, or why it is relevant given the Courtโs finding that \n16  the issue is rendered moot by Plaintiffsโ lack of standing.  See id.  As the Court noted, \n17  NRS ยง 293.205 and .206 are concerned with adjustments to precinct boundaries. Id. at *9.  \n18  The decision to implement the all-mail primary election did not result in any changes to \n19  precinct boundaries.   Had there been changes to precinct boundaries, advance notice \n20  would  have  given  voters  and  candidates  alike  the  opportunity  to  object  to  potential \n21  gerrymanders well in advance of the primary election.  But gerrymanders are not at issue \n22  in this case.  Plaintiffs do not, indeed cannot explain how untimely notice of a non-\n23  existent adjustment to precinct boundaries contributed to their alleged injury.  The notice \n24  issue is purely academic. \n25  C.  Plaintiffsโ Delay in Seeking Further Consideration Warrants Denial of the Motion \n26  โLaches is an equitable defense.โ Danjaq LLC v. Sony Corp., 263 F.3d 942, 950 (9th \n27  Cir. 2001).  It bars a plaintiff who, โwith full knowledge of the facts, acquiesces in a \n28  transaction and sleeps upon his rights.โ Id. at 950-51 (quotations and citations omitted). \n-8- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC     Document 77     Filed 05/20/20     Page 9 of 11\n1  A defendant is entitled to relief under the doctrine where the defendant proves โboth an \n2  unreasonable delay by the plaintiff and prejudice to itself.โ Couveau v. Am. Airlines, Inc., \n3  218 F.3d 1078, 1083 (9th Cir. 2000).  Here, Plaintiffs slept on their purported rights.   \n4  Specifically, Plaintiffs did nothing between the April 30, 2020 order of this Court \n5  and the filing of their amended complaint and second amended complaint.  Consistent \n6  with conducting a mostly mail election, all county clerks have already mailed voters their \n7  ballots during this intervening two weeks.  As of the filing date of the second motion, only \n8  twenty-six days remain to the June 9 primary date.  Plaintiffsโ requested relief would \n9  cause prejudice to the Secretaryโs efforts to run the June 9 primary during the ongoing \n10  public  health  emergency.    Laches  prevents  Plaintiffs  from  obtaining  equitable  relief \n11  following their unreasonable delay.     \n  12  Further, the Supreme Court has cautioned courts not to judicially alter election \n13  systems on the eve of voting.  Purcell v. Gonzalez, 541 U.S. 1, 5-6 (2006).  This Court \n14  recognized the importance of adhering to the Purcell principle in its April 30, 2020 order.  \n15  (Id. at 22:3-5; 23:14โ16.)  Now, after more than two weeks of additional delay caused by \n16  Plaintiffs, the caution proffered by Purcell weighs even more heavily against Plaintiffsโ \n17  last-moment request for judicial interference with the Secretaryโs administration of the \n18  June primary.   \n19  IV.  CONCLUSION \n20  Plaintiffs attempt to advance a legislative agenda in the guise of a civil rights \n21  lawsuit.    While  there  is  certainly  an  appropriate  balance  between  voter  access \n22  concerns and election-integrity concerns, it is not the role of the federal judiciary to \n23  find that balance in the absence of a justiciable case or controversy.  For this reason, \n24  and  the  other  reasons  discussed  above,  the  Court  should  deny  Plaintiffsโ  second \n25  motion for a preliminary injunction, and dismiss its claims pursuant to Fed. Rule \n26  Civ. Proc. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. \n27  Alternatively,  because  the  belated  second  motion  is  untimely  and  lacking  in \n28  relevant factual details, it does not warrant extraordinary relief during the conduct of a \n-9- \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC     Document 77     Filed 05/20/20     Page 10 of 11\n1  mostly-mail election.  Given the repetitive nature of Plaintiffsโ motion, it should be denied \n2  without hearing.   \n3  DATED this 20th day of May 2020. \n4  AARON D. FORD \nAttorney General \n5   \nBy:   Gregory L.

SUMMARY \n13  The Court has already ruled in this case. See Paher. et al. v. Cegavske, et al., No. \n14  3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC, __ F. Supp. 3d__, 2020 WL 2089813 (D. Nev. Apr. 30, 2020). \n15  But Plaintiffs then amended their complaint (โACโ) (ECF No. 64) and brought a new motion \n16  for preliminary injunction (Second PI Motionโ) (ECF No. 65). The AC consists of four claims \n17  and materially rehashes the original complaint except for the addition of more Plaintiffs \n18  and a new claim against a new DefendantโJoseph P. Gloria in his official capacity as the \n19  Registrar of Voters for Clark County (โClark Registrarโ). (Compare ECF No. 1 with ECF \n20  No. 64.) The Second PI Motion is in gist largely a motion for reconsideration; albeit, it \n21  glaringly repackages old arguments to achieve a different disposition without necessary \n22  justification. Plaintiffsโ decision to bring the AC at this late hour, as opposed to seeking \n23  expedited appellate review of the Courtโs order (โPI Orderโ) regarding their original motion \n24  for preliminary injunction (โFirst PI Motionโ) (ECF No. 57), is confounding and contrary to \n25  their position that a quick disposition of this matter is needed due to the impending June \n26  9, 2020 Nevada primary election (โJune Primaryโ) (see ECF Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4). Ultimately, \n27  Plaintiffsโ second proverbial bite at the apple is no more fruitful than the first. And the new \n28  fourth claim challenging Clark County essentially making mail-in ballots more accessible \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 83   Filed 05/27/20   Page 2 of 17\n1  to  registered  voters  is  legally  tenuous  because  Defendants  are  not  constitutionally \n2  prohibited from making voting easier. The Court will deny the Second PI Motion for the \n3  reasons below.1  \n4  II. BACKGROUND\n5  The facts of this case have been largely recited in the Courtโs PI Order (ECF No.\n6  57). The Court will not repeat the facts as previously stated here. Additional facts are taken \n7  from the AC (ECF No. 64) and exhibits attached thereto as well as other evidence \n8  submitted concerning the Second PI Motion. \n9  A. The Parties\n10  As relevant to the Second PI Motion, the field of Plaintiffs and Defendants have\n11  expanded. As a reminder, the original Plaintiffs are William Paher, Gary Hamilton, and \n12  Terresa  Monroe-Hamilton.  They  previously  sued  only  Nevadaโs  Secretary  of  State \n13  Barbara Cegavske (the โSecretaryโ) and Deanna SpikulaโRegistrar of Voters for Washoe \n14  County (โWashoe Registrarโ).  \n15  The new individual plaintiffs are Daryl Byron DeShaw, Jeff Ecker, Gary Gladwill, \n16  and Linda Barnett. All are eligible-registered voters. DeShaw and Ecker intend to vote in \n17  person while Gladwill and Barnet have already voted by mail. Gladwill, who is a resident \n18  of Lyon County, is also a candidate for county commissioner in that county. In addition to \n19  the new individual plaintiffs, the entity Nevada Right to Life (โNVRTLโ) is also included as \n20  a plaintiff. NVRTL advocates โfor life in all of its stages and all agesโ and have members, \n21  who are eligible-registered voters โwho intend to vote in the coming primary but fear \n22  disenfranchisement.โ (ECF No. 64 at 4.) \n23  ///\n24  ///\n25  1In  addition  to  the  Second  PI  Motion,  the  Court  has  considered  the  various \nresponses (ECF Nos. 72, 74, 75, 78) and Plaintiffsโ reply (ECF No. 80). Plaintiff filed \n26  โSupplemental Authorityโ without seeking leave of court as required by LR 7-2(g). (ECF \nNo. 243.)  The document provides two referencesโa recent Sixth Circuit decision and a \n27  1969 Supreme Court decision.  While Plaintiffsโ failure to cite to the former is apparent \nsince the decision was issued on May 26, 2020, Plaintiffsโ reference to the latter is clearly \n28  an  attempt  to  improperly  augment  their  arguments  after  briefing  has  completed. \nRegardless, the Court will strike the improper supplement.  \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 83   Filed 05/27/20   Page 3 of 17\n1  These Plaintiffs collectively sue the Secretary, the Washoe Registrar and the Clark \n2  Registrar (collectively, โDefendantsโ). (Id. at 4โ5.) Like the Washoe Registrar in Washoe \n3  County, the Clark Registrar is responsible for implementing the stateโs election laws in \n4  Clark County. (Id.)  \n5  B. Relevant Facts\n6  As provided in the PI Order, the impetus for Plaintiffsโ lawsuit is to enjoin the\n7  implementation of the all-mail election for the June Primary (โthe Planโ). The Secretary \n8  developed the Plan in partnership with Nevadaโs 17 county election officials to diminish \n9  the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (โCOVID-19โ) pandemic. In the PI Order, \n10  the Court summed up the original Plaintiffsโ claims as largely contending that the Plan was \n11  inconsistent with Nevada law and violated the United States Constitution because it is not \n12  โchosenโ  by  Nevadaโs  Legislature,  and  that  an  all-mail  election  strips  voter-fraud-\n13  prevention  safeguards  and  unconstitutionally  violates  Plaintiffsโ  right  to  vote  due  to \n14  purported vote dilution resulting in disenfranchisement. (See ECF Nos. 1, 57.)  \n15  In the PI Order, the Court concluded as a threshold matter that Plaintiffs lacked \n16  standing because they had not established an injury particularized to them. (ECF No. 57 \n17  at 2, 8โ10.) The Court additionally found that Plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the \n18  merits of any of their claims chiefly because: (1) Nevadaโs interests in protecting the health \n19  and safety of Nevadaโs voters and to safeguard the voting franchise are compelling and \n20  longstanding interests that outweighed what amounts to Plaintiffsโ preference for in-person \n21  voting under the Anderson-Burdick balancing test2; and (2) the Plan is consistent with \n22  Nevada law because the Secretary has been vested with the authority to implement it. (Id. \n23  at 10โ22.) The Court also concluded that a balancing of the equities and the public interest \n24  weigh against the granting of an injunction. (Id. at 22โ24.) \n25  In the AC, Plaintiffs assert the following four claims: (1) the Plan violates the \n26  fundamental  right  to  vote  by  direct  disenfranchisement  in  violation  of  the  First  and \n27  ///\n28  2Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 788โ89 (1983) & Burdick v. Takushi, 504 \nU.S. 428, 434 (1992). \n3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 83   Filed 05/27/20   Page 4 of 17\n1  Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution; (2) the Plan violates the \n2  fundamental right to vote by vote-dilution disenfranchisement in violation of the same; (3) \n3  the Plan violates Article I, Section 4, Clause 1 of the Constitution; and (4) Clark Countyโs \n4  plan to send mail-in ballots to all registered voters and to allow for the collection of ballots \n5  (โClark  Countyโs  Planโ  or  โCC  Planโ)  violates  the  Fourteenth  Amendmentโs  Equal \n6  Protection Clause.3 (ECF No. 64 at 20โ25.) As to the CC Plan, Plaintiffs particularly \n7  highlight Clark Countyโs plan to: (i) send absent ballots to inactive registered voters and, \n8  as reported, โallow a bipartisan group of deputized โfield registrarsโ to collect sealed ballots \n9  from votersโ; and (ii) create more vote centers than other Nevada counties. (ECF No. 64 \n10  at 2.)  \n11  The AC and the Second PI Motion, particularly as to the first three claims, are \n12  brought under the theory that the threats surrounding the spread of COVID-19 have \n13  diminished and that current social distancing measures are adequate to respond to \n14  concerns about public health such that enjoining the Plan is now merited. (See id. at 14โ\n15  17;  ECF  No.  65 at  2โ3.)  In  so  contending,  Plaintiffs  rely  heavily  on  articles  and/or \n16  information concerning other statesโnot Nevadaโreopening, deciding not to allow vote \n17  by mail, and about COVID-19 cases allegedly having not spiked two weeks after the \n18  infamous Wisconsin primary.4 (Id.)  \n19  But not much has changed in Nevada since the Court issued the PI Order. COVID-\n20  19 continues to present a threat to public health. It is undisputed that the state continues \n21  to grapple with protecting the public from COVID-19 and remains under a declaration of \n22  ///\n23  ///\n24 \n3The header of the fourth claim broadly asserts that the Plan violates the Equal \n25  Protection Clause, but the substance of the allegation is specifically concerned with Clark \nCounty and the CC Plan. (See ECF No. 64 at 24โ25.)  \n26 \n4See, e,g., D. Chen & J.

LEGAL STANDARD\n2  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 governs preliminary injunctions. โโAn injunction\n3  is a matter of equitable discretionโ and is โan extraordinary remedy that may only be \n4  awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.โโ Earth Island Inst. \n5  v. Carlton, 626 F.3d 462, 469 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council,\n6  555 U.S. 7, 22, 32 (2008)). This relief is โnever awarded as of right.โ Alliance for the Wild\n7  Rockies v. Cottrell (โAllianceโ), 623 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011). To qualify for a\n8  preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must satisfy four requirements: (1) a likelihood of success\n9  on the merits; (2) a likelihood of irreparable harm; (3) that the balance of equities favors\n10  the plaintiff; and (4) that the injunction is in the public interest. See Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.\n11  A plaintiff may also satisfy the first and third prongs by showing serious questions going\n12  to the merits of the case and that a balancing of hardships tips sharply in plaintiffโs favor.\n13  Alliance, 632  F.3d at  1135  (holding  that the  Ninth  Circuit's  โsliding  scaleโ  approach\n14  continues to be valid following the Winter decision).\n15  On the merits-success prong, โthe burdens at the preliminary injunction stage track \n16  the burdens at trial.โ Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 \n17  U.S. 418, 429 (2006); see also id. at 428 (citing Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656, 666 \n18  (2004)).  \n19  IV. DISCUSSION\n20  Beyond the merits of the AC, the Court will deny the Second PI Motion for three\n21  reasons: (1) lack of standing; (2) based on laches; and (3) under the Purcell11 principle. \n22  A. Standing\n23  The Court finds that Plaintiffs have not remedied their lack of standing, which based\n24  on the PI Order and the Courtโs conclusions infra most directly concerns the instant first \n25  three  claims.  โ[T]he  irreducible  constitutional  minimum  of  standing  contains  three \n26  elements.โ Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). โThe plaintiff must have \n27  ///\n28  11Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1 (2006) (per curiam). \n6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 83   Filed 05/27/20   Page 7 of 17\n1  (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the\n2  defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.โ Spokeo,\n3  Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016).  The party invoking federal jurisdiction must\n4  show that it has standing for each type of relief sought. Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555\n5  U.S. 488, 493 (2009).\n6  A  party  may  cure  a  standing  defect  by  adding  parties,  removing  parties,  or \n7  supplementing the facts of a complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15. See, e.g., Northstar Fin. \n8  Advisors Inc. v. Schwab Invs., 779 F.3d 1036, 1044โ48 (9th Cir. 2015), as amended on \n9  denial of reh'g and reh'g en banc (Apr. 28, 2015), In re Schugg, 688 F. App'x 477, 479โ80 \n10  (9th Cir. 2017); cf.

Cir. 2005) (โThe initial standing of the original plaintiff is assessed at the time of\n12  the  original  complaint,  even  if  the  complaint  is  later  amended.โ)  (citations  omitted).\n13  However, Plaintiffsโ AC suffers from the same failure to establish standing as the original\n14  complaintโPlaintiffs have again failed to allege a particularized injury.\n15  As with the original complaint, the claims in the AC are materially grounded on \n16  ostensible election fraud that may be conceivably raised by any Nevada voter. Thus, \n17  Plaintiffsโ  claims  amount  to  general  grievances  that  cannot  support  a  finding  of \n18  particularized injury as to Plaintiffs. See, e.g., Lujan, 504 U.S. at 573โ74 (explaining that \n19  U.S. Supreme Courtโs case law has โconsistently held that a plaintiff raising only a \n20  generally available grievance about governmentโclaiming only harm to his and every \n21  citizenโs interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that \n22  no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at largeโdoes not state \n23  an Article III case or controversyโ). \n24  Plaintiffs essentially seek to have the Court reconsider its finding as to standing, \n25  arguing that they do not merely assert โcitizenโ standing and that harm is specific to them \n26  as registered, eligible voters, who actually vote. (See ECF No. 65 at 19โ21.) But even if \n27  the Court were to find that Plaintiffs state a particularized injury, and even if they had \n28  argued the reconsideration standard, Plaintiffs face an additional obstacle. As the Court \n7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 83   Filed 05/27/20   Page 8 of 17\n1  concluded in the PI Order, Plaintiffs fail to show a nexus between the alleged violations \n2  and their claimed injury. (See ECF No. 57 at 10 n.7.) Here, Plaintiffs again fail to more \n3  than speculatively connect the specific conduct they challengeโthat mail-in ballots are \n4  sent to Nevada voters without request for an absentee ballotโand the claimed injuryโ\n5  direct voter disenfranchisement or disenfranchisement through vote dilution (in sum, \n6  disenfranchisement).12   \n7  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have failed to overcome the Courtโs original finding that they \n8  lack standing, thereby precluding them from seeking to enjoin the Planโat least via the \n9  first three claims. \n10  B. Laches\n11  The  Secretary  argues  that  the  doctrine  of  laches  further  bars  Plaintiffs  from\n12  obtaining equitable relief after unreasonable delay in filing the AC and the Second PI \n13  Motion. (ECF No. 78 at 8โ9.) The Court agrees. \n14  โLaches is an equitable defense.โ Danjaq LLC v. Sony Corp., 263 F.3d 942, 950 \n15  (9th Cir. 2001). It precludes a plaintiff who, โwith full knowledge of the facts, acquiesces in \n16  a transaction and sleeps upon his rights.โ Id. at 950โ51 (quotations and citations omitted). \n17  A defendant is entitled to relief under the doctrine where the defendant proves โboth an \n18  unreasonable delay by the plaintiff and prejudice to itself.โ Couveau v. Am. Airlines, Inc., \n19  218 F.3d 1078, 1083 (9th Cir. 2000). The Court finds, as the Secretary argues, that both \n20  factors are satisfied here. \n21  ///\n22 \n12Plaintiffs rely on numerous articles and studies to support their contentions that \n23  voting by mail leads to voter fraud. (See ECF No. 65 at 6โ8.) The articles and studies are \nsimply insufficient to establish that sending mail-in ballots to Nevada voters will result in \n24  voter fraud that particularly disenfranchises Plaintiffs as voters. Said differently, they do \nnot meaningfully improve Plaintiffsโ burden to concretely establish voter fraud that harms \n25  them. Plaintiffsโ contention that issues with mail delivery to and from voters will lead to \ndisenfranchisement based on what allegedly happened in Ohio and Wisconsin (id. at 8โ\n26  9)is equally unpersuasive as to Nevada. As the Washoe Registrar notes, for example, the\nsituation with respect to โtiming and preparationโ of the June Primary is quite different in\n27  Nevada than it was for Wisconsin, (See ECF No. 74-2 at 5.) Moreover, as the Court noted\nin the PI Order, the material safeguards against voter fraud are maintained under the Plan.\n28  (ECF No. 57 at 14; see also ECF No. 74-2 at 9 (โThe all mail primary election provides all\nof the voter fraud safeguards that exist in statute.โ).)\n8 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 83   Filed 05/27/20   Page 9 of 17\n1  With the following considerations, the Court agrees Plaintiffs have unreasonably \n2  delayed seeking preliminary injunctive relief. Plaintiffs brought this case in its initial form \n3  on April 21, 2020 (ECF No. 1). They requested and were granted expedited briefing and \n4  an expedited hearing (ECF Nos. 3, 14). Recognizing the urgency with which Plaintiffs \n5  indicated they brought this case and the finality that was needed, the Court issued its \n6  decision on the First PI Motionโthe PI Orderโtwo days after extensive briefing closed, \n7  on April 30, 2020. (Compare ECF No. 43 with ECF No. 57.) Plaintiffs waited 14 days after \n8  the PI Order was issued and only 26 days before the June Primary to file the AC and bring \n9  the Second PI Motion. (See ECF Nos. 64, 65.) In doing so, Plaintiffs again sought \n10  expedited relief. (ECF No. 66.)  \n11  Except the specific claim based on the CC Plan, the AC materially asserts no claim \n12  that could not have been raisedโor that was not raisedโthe first time around. To be sure, \n13  Plaintiffs did not seek reconsideration of the Courtโs PI Order. Nor did Plaintiffs file an \n14  appeal. Moreover, the AC also indicates that Plaintiffs had notice of the CC Plan, upon \n15  which the fourth claim is grounded, by at least May 4, 2020. (ECF No. 64 at 8.)  Therefore, \n16  it is inexplicable that Plaintiffs would delay bringing the AC and Second PI Motion for \n17  another nine days in light of their claimed urgency. Plaintiffs surely have not acted with the \n18  alacrity that they claim this case necessitates. \n19  Plaintiffsโ failure to seek legal relief and finality has certainly prejudiced Defendants. \n20  As noted, the June Primary was only 26 days away when Plaintiffs brought the AC and \n21  Second PI Motion. Even with expedited briefing, Plaintiffs could have anticipated that any \n22  foreseeable briefing schedule would result in a decision being issued, at minimum, several \n23  days closer to the election. Notably, since this Court issued the PI Order, mail-in ballots \n24  have been sent to Nevada voters and a substantial number of eligible voters, including \n25  Plaintiffs Gladwill and Barnett, have already sent in their mail-in ballots. (See, e.g., ECF \n26  No. 74-2 at 5โ6 (โBy the end of April, the actual mail ballots were mailed to all active \n27  registered voters in Washoe County. Upon information and belief, all ballots for all Nevada \n28  voters have been mailed . . ..โ); see also id. at 7 (โThe mail-in primary election plan is in \n9 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 83   Filed 05/27/20   Page 10 of 17\n1  full swing . . . Many voters have already completed their ballots and returned the same via \n2  mail or by dropping them off at my office.โ); ECF No. 64 at 9 (โMail ballots to active, \n3  registered voters went out on May 6, 2020.โ).) The state has also made significant \n4  monetary investments and efforts to implement the Plan and on media and marketing \n5  campaigns to inform Nevada voters of how to exercise their right to vote via mail (ECF No. \n6  74-1 at 4โ6, ECF No. 74-3).\n7  The Court finds that Plaintiffsโ second request for preliminary injunctive relief is \n8  therefore unreasonable and inequitable in seeking to undo the votes already casted by \n9  Nevadans and would result in squandering the stateโs investment for the sake of an \n10  unestablished specter of voter fraud. This conclusion is particularly merited where the AC \n11  and Second PI Motion are largely repetitive of the original complaint and motion. Even if \n12  the additional claimโthe fourth claim based on the CC Planโwas meritorious, it would \n13  not entitle Plaintiffs to the wholesale relief of voiding the Plan, which is ultimately what \n14  Plaintiffs seek here. Even if Plaintiffsโ preliminary injunction request was on firmer grounds, \n15  the Court cannot foresee any viable manner of undoing the Plan or stopping its further \n16  implementation without increasing the risks to the health and safety of Nevadans and \n17  putting the integrity of the election at riskโparticularly without sufficient time to prepare \n18  an  adequate  alternative.  (See,  e.g.,  ECF  No.  74-2  at  7โ9  (discussing  the  adverse \n19  consequences for Nevada in changing the method and processes of voting in the June \n20  Primary at this juncture). For all these reasons, the Court finds that the doctrine of laches \n21  bars Plaintiffsโ second request for preliminary injunctive relief and the Court will likewise \n22  deny the request on this additional basis. \n23  C. Purcell\n24  The Purcell principle is yet another barrier to the grant of preliminary injunctive relief\n25  here. Of course Plaintiffs are no stranger to Purcell. They argued in the First PI Motion \n26  that Purcell bars the implementation of the Plan so close to the June Primary. (ECF No. 2 \n27  at 16โ17.) The irony of Plaintiffsโ argument was not lost on the Court. The Court disagreed \n28  with  Plaintiffsโ  contention  as  to  the  state  and  noted  that  Purcell  counseled  against \n10 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 83   Filed 05/27/20   Page 11 of 17\n1  considering  the  First  PI  Motion.  The  Secretary,  Washoe  Registrar  and  Intervenor-\n2  Defendants here argue that Purcell is ever more relevant now where Plaintiffs seek to \n3  change the stateโs Plan governing the June Primary because the election is days away \n4  and Nevadans are already exercising their right to vote. (See ECF No. 72 at 15โ16; ECF \n5  No. 74 at 4, 30โ33; ECF No. 78 at 2, 9.) The Court agrees. \n6  The  Purcell  principle  provides  that  near  an  impending  election  court  orders \n7  themselves risk debasement and dilution of the right to vote because โ[c]ourt orders \n8  affecting elections, especially conflicting orders, can themselves result in voter confusion \n9  and consequent incentive to remain away from the polls. As an election draws closer, that \n10  risk will increase.โ 549 U.S. at 4โ5. The Supreme Court โhas repeatedly emphasized that \n11  lower federal courts should ordinarily not alter the election rules on the eve of an election.โ \n12  Republican Nat'l Comm. v. Democratic Nat'l Comm. (โRNCโ), 140 S. Ct. 1205, 1207 (2020) \n13  (citing Purcell; Frank v. Walker, 574 U.S. 929 (2014); and Veasey v. Perry, 574 U. S. __, \n14  135 S. Ct. 9 (2014)); see also Republican Party of Pa. v. Cortรฉs, 218 F. Supp. 3d 396, 405 \n15  (E.D. Pa. 2016) (โFederal intervention at this late hour risks โa disruption in the state \n16  electoral process [which] is not to be taken lightly.โ โThis important equitable consideration \n17  goes to the heart of our notions of federalism.โโ) (alteration in original) (citation and \n18  quotation omitted). This principle is particularly pertinent where plaintiffs ask courts to \n19  โimpose large-scale changes to the election process.โ Bryan v. Fawkes, 61 V.I. 416, 469 \n20  (2014) (collecting cases).  \n21  The Court will follow the Purcell principle and declines to take any action to alter \n22  the Plan at this late hour. The Court is reassured that such is the right course in light of \n23  the exceptional relief that Plaintiffs request in the AC, which would completely upend the \n24  June Primary. Among other things, Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief ordering Defendants to \n25  disregard the mail ballots that have already been sent to voters and to notify voters that \n26  their mailed in ballots will not be counted; to undertake a counter media public information \n27  campaign to notify โevery registered voterโ of the changes Plaintiffs seek; and to undo the \n28  CC Plan. (See ECF No. 64 at 25โ26.) Going along with Plaintiffsโ request would surely \n11 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 83   Filed 05/27/20   Page 12 of 17\n1  cause great disruption and confusion for Nevada voters. Plaintiffsโ request is therefore in \n2  many ways more injurious to Nevada voters at this juncture than the very grounds \n3  underlying the AC, particularly given the speculative claimed of voter disenfranchisement. \n4  The Court therefore also denies a grant of preliminary injunctive relief based on Purcell.  \n5  D. Touching Upon the Merits\n6  Touching upon the merits, it is also clear that Plaintiffsโ claims should be plainly\n7  rejected. \n8  Plaintiffsโ second and third claims are foreclosed by the PI Order because they are \n9  materially the same as the second and third claims alleged in the original complaint. \n10  (Compare ECF No. 1 with ECF No. 64.) Plaintiffs effectively seek reconsideration of these \n11  claims without establishing the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 60, which governs a motion \n12  for reconsideration. (See generally ECF No. 65 (providing no Rule 60 arguments).)13 The \n13  Court therefore adopts its rulings from the PI Order and likewise find that Plaintiffs are \n14  unlikely to succeed on the merits of these claims.14 \n15  Plaintiffsโ first claim, despite discretely alleging direct disenfranchisement, in many \n16  ways echoes Plaintiffsโ second and third claims. The crux of this claim is Plaintiffsโ \n17  ///\n18 \n13A motion to reconsider must set forth โsome valid reason why the court should \n19  reconsider its prior decisionโ and set โforth facts or law of a strongly convincing nature to \npersuade the court to reverse its prior decision.โ  Frasure v. United States, 256 F. Supp. \n20 \n2d 1180, 1183 (D. Nev. 2003). โA motion for reconsideration is not an avenue to re-litigate \nthe same issues and arguments upon which the court already has ruled.โ Brown v. Kinross \n21 \nGold, U.S.A., 378 F. Supp. 2d 1280, 1288 (D. Nev. 2005). A district court may decline to \n22  consider claims and issues that were not raised until a motion for reconsideration. Hopkins \nv. Andaya, 958 F.2d 881, 889 n.5 (9th Cir. 1992), impliedly overruled on other grounds in\n23  Federman v. County of Kern, 61 F. Appโx 438, 440 (9th Cir. 2003). It is not an abuse of\ndiscretion to refuse to consider new arguments in a reconsideration motion even though\n24 \nโdire consequencesโ might result. Schanen v. United States Dept. of Justice, 762 F.2d\n805, 807โ08 (9th Cir. 1985).\n25 \n26  14To the extent Plaintiffs challenge the Courtโs finding that the Washoe Register \ncomplied with the notice requirements (ECF No. 57 at 19โ20; see ECF. No 65 at 4โ6), \n27  Plaintiffs fail to meaningfully contest the Courtโs conclusion that the notice issue does not \narise  to  the  level  of  a  constitutional  violationโnecessary  to  void  the  Planโeven  if \n28  technically inconsistent with Nevada law. \n12 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 83   Filed 05/27/20   Page 13 of 17\n1  assertion that โ[d]ue to . . . widespread disenfranchisement caused by not abiding by the \n2  legislatureโs law, the Plan violates the right to vote by direct disenfranchisement.โ (ECF \n3  No. 64 at 22.) The first claim therefore also seeks to avoid the Courtโs ruling in the PI \n4  Order, where the Court concluded that the Plan is consistent with Nevada law and within \n5  the authority conferred upon the Secretary. (See ECF No. 57 at 16โ20.) Moreover, as \n6  already discussed here and in the PI Order, Plaintiffsโ claims of voter disenfranchisement \n7  are speculative at best. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are also unlikely to succeed on the merits \n8  of this claim. \n9  While Plaintiffsโ fourth and last claim is entirely new, it is of no greater avail for \n10  Plaintiffs even assuming Plaintiffs have standing.15 This claim is in gist that Clark Countyโs \n11  plan to mail ballots to all registered voters, including inactive voters, and to allow for \n12  assistance in returning ballots will result in more votes coming out of Clark County because \n13  the CC Plan makes it easier to vote in Clark County than any other county, resulting in an \n14  Equal Protection violation.  (ECF No. 64 at 24โ25.)  The Washoe and Clark Registrars and \n15  Intervenor  Defendants  point  out  that this  claim  is  undermined  by  the  Ninth  Circuitโs \n16  decision in Short v. Brown, 893 F.3d 671 (9th Cir. 2018). (ECF No. 72 at 11โ12; ECF No. \n17  74 at 24โ25; ECF No. 75 at 4.) Plaintiffs reply that Short does not apply because Plaintiffs \n18  allege that the violation is that Clark County will have greater voter strength in the June \n19  ///\n20 \n15The Secretary notes that she gave deference to the Clark Registrar regarding his \n21  decision to send ballots to inactive registered voters under the CC Plan because โNRS ยง \n293.345(1) is silent on whether ballots may be mailed to inactive voters as well as active \n22  votersโ (ECF No. 78 at 7).  See NRS ยง 293.345(1) (providing that โthe county clerk shall \ncause to be mailed to each registered voter in each mailing precinct and in each absent \n23  ballot mailing precinct an official mailing ballot, and accompanying supplies, as specified \nin NRS 293.350โ) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs do not directly challenge the Secretaryโs \n24  statement. Instead, Plaintiffs for the first time in their reply argue NAC ยง 293.412(4) is a \nrelevant regulation barring sending ballots to inactive voters (ECF No. 80 at 9โ10). Even \n25  if the Court agreed, the Court does not consider the newly raised argument/legal provision \nasserted for the first time in Plaintiffsโ reply. See, e.g., Zamani v. Carnes, 491 F.3d 990, \n26  997  (9th  Cir.  2007) (โThe  district court need  not  consider arguments raised for \nthe first time in a reply brief.โ). Moreover, to the extent the Secretary deferred to Clark \n27  County in implementing the CC Plan, the discretion of the Secretary to do so would also \nlikely fall under the provisions cited in the PI Order as being the basis of the Secretaryโs \n28  authority in the electoral process. See NRS ยงยง 293.124, 293.213(4) and 293.247. \n13 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 83   Filed 05/27/20   Page 14 of 17\n1  Primary in violation of the one person, one vote principle16 (ECF No. 80 at 8โ9; see also \n2  ECF No. 65 at 21โ23; ECF No. 64 at 24โ25). The Court disagrees with Plaintiffs. \n3  Plaintiffs essentially speculate that beyond the size of Clark Countyโs voter base \n4  relative to other counties, the CC Plan will ensure that Clark County votersโ vote carry \n5  greater weight solely because ballots are also mailed to inactive registered voters and \n6  county deputized election workers are allowed to collect ballots. (See id.; cf. ECF No. 75 \n7  at 3, 12.) To be sure, Plaintiffs expressly disavow any challenge to the provisions of the \n8  CC Plan allowing for more polling places in Clark County. (ECF No. 80 at 8โ9.)  \n9  Further,  Plaintiffs  do  not  address  the  Clark  Registrarโs  contention  that  it  is \n10  anticipated that โmostโ of the ballots sent to inactive voters โwill come back undeliverable \n11  because  we  had  previously  sent  election  notifications  to  those  addresses  and  the \n12  notifications were returned as undeliverable or we received notification by the USPS that \n13  the voter had moved out of town.โ (ECF No. 75 at 12.) The Clark Registrarโs unchallenged \n14  contention accepted as true significantly diminishes Plaintiffsโ contention that also sending \n15  ballots to Clark County inactive voters will result in greater voting strength for voters in that \n16  county. Plaintiffsโ argument necessarily presupposes that inactive voters in Clark County \n17  would not alternatively go to the polling sites to vote in the June Primary. (See id. (noting \n18  the inactive voters are eligible to vote in the June Primary at a polling site).)17 \n19  Additionally, the Court is convinced that deputized staff members of the Clark \n20  Registrar picking up ballots does not add to Plaintiffsโ contention of Clark County voters \n21  ///\n22  16Plaintiffs rely on Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000) as their basis for applying the \ndoctrine to this case. (E.g., ECF No. 64 at 24.) However, Bush v. Gore, is not directly on \n23  point  where  the  concern  there  was  that  the  various  Florida  counties  used  different \nstandards in a recount to assess what votes should be counted in a presidential election. \n24  See id. at 107. The facts of Plaintiffsโ Equal Protection claim here are completely different \nbecause Plaintiffs cannot support a claim that under the Plan or the CC Plan votes will be \n25  counted differently, or what constitutes a valid vote would differ as among the counties. \nMoreover, in the context of the Equal Protection Clause, the one person, one vote principle \n26  ordinarily concerns requiring states to design both congressional and state legislative \ndistricts  with  equal  populations  and  must  regularly  reapportion  districts  to  prevent \n27  malapportionment. See, e.g., Evenwel v. Abbott, 136 S. Ct. 1120, 1123โ24 (2016). \n28  17See NAC ยง 293.412(5) (โAn inactive voter may vote in person at a polling place \nin the same manner as an active voter.โ). \n14 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 83   Filed 05/27/20   Page 15 of 17\n1  having a greater voter strength than other counties. Plaintiffs do not challenge the Clark \n2  Registrarโs representation that this service is based upon request, that the county has not \n3  received much requests for this service, and that it is provided as an alternative particularly \n4  for those with disabilities who would rather not send their ballots by mail or deliver to a \n5  drop-off site (see ECF No. 75 at 12). Notably, these individuals would have already voted. \n6  (Id.) Therefore, it is unlikely that the mere act of the alternative of picking up an already \n7  voted ballot, for which there is also an option to drop off or mail-in with postage provided \n8  (see id.), would result in greater voting strength. For these reasons, the Court concludes \n9  that Plaintiffs have not supported the contention that the CC Plan leads to greater voter \n10  strength for Clark County voters. \n11  It also appears to the Court that Plaintiffsโ chief concern (if not purported harm) is \n12  that the CC Plan will result โin the most populous county of a certain persuasion . . . \n13  garner[ing] many more votes of the dominant political persuasion in that county.โ (E.g., \n14  ECF No. 80 at 10.) It is not clear to the Court why this concern is even relevant to the June \n15  Primary. As the Washoe Registrar notes, Nevada is a closed primary, therefore only \n16  members of a party can vote for candidates for that party (see ECF No. 74 at 6). See NRS \n17  ยง 293.257(3) (โA registered voter may cast a primary ballot for a major political party at a\n18  primary election only if the registered voter designated on his or her application to register\n19  to vote an affiliation with that major political party.โ).  Thus, Plaintiffsโ concern of more\n20  votes for a certain political persuasion appears reaching at best and materially does not\n21  support their Equal Protection claim, if at all, particularly in the primary context.\n22  The Court further concludes that the Equal Protection claim fails under Short, which \n23  the Court finds applicable to the claim. In Short, the appellants challenged Californiaโs \n24  Voterโs Choice Act (โVCAโ), claiming it violated the Equal Protection Clause because it \n25  permitted voters in some counties to receive a mail ballot automatically while voters in \n26  other counties had to apply for a mail ballot. Id. at 677โ79. The Ninth Circuit Court of \n27  Appeals  concluded  that  there  was  no  constitutional  violation  because  there  was no \n28  evidence that โthe VCA [would] prevent anyone from voting.โ Id. at 677. The appellate \n15 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 83   Filed 05/27/20   Page 16 of 17\n1  court specifically noted that the appellants had failed to cite โany authority explaining how \n2  a law that makes it easier to vote would violate the Constitution.โ Id. at 677โ78.  \n3  As in Short, Clark Countyโs Plan may make it easier or more convenient to vote in \n4  Clark County, but does not have any adverse effects on the ability of voters in other \n5  counties to vote. Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on their claim of an Equal Protection \n6  violation where they provide no evidenceโand cannot provide anyโthat the CC Plan \n7  makes it harder for voters in other counties to vote. Nor is there any allegation that under \n8  the  CC Plan  representation  is differently allocated  between  Clark  County  and  other \n9  counties or that the CC Plan operates to discriminate based on a suspect classification. If \n10  it did, it would be subject to heightened scrutiny requiring compelling justification under \n11  the Anderson-Burdick test.18 See Id. at 677โ79. However, โ[c]ounty of residence is not a \n12  suspect classification warranting heightened scrutiny.โ Id. at 679. Applying a lesser level \n13  of scrutiny, it cannot be contested that Clark County, which contains most of Nevadaโs \n14  populationโand likewise voters (69% of all registered voters (see ECF No. 75 at 12))โis \n15  differently situated than other counties. Acknowledging this as a matter of generally known \n16  (or judicially noticeable) fact and commonsense makes it more than rational for Clark \n17  County to provide additional accommodations to assist eligible voters. Moreover, there is \n18  no contention that under the Plan, other counties could not have similarly adopted further \n19  accommodations for their residents. Thus, like their other claims, Plaintiffsโ fourth claim of \n20  an Equal Protection violation falls flat. \n21  In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of any \n22  claim asserted in the AC. The Court also adopts its conclusion from the PI Order that a \n23  balancing of the equities and the public interest weigh against granting an injunction to \n24  Plaintiffs. \n25  ///\n26  ///\n27 \n18The Court explains the relevant balancing under this test in the PI Order (ECF \n28  No. 57 at 12โ13) and will not recite it here. \n16 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 83   Filed 05/27/20   Page 17 of 17\n1  V. CONCLUSION\n2  The Court notes that the parties made several arguments and cited to several cases\n3  not discussed above. The Court has reviewed these arguments and cases and determines \n4  that they do not warrant discussion as they do not affect the outcome of the issues before \n5  the Court. \n6  It is therefore ordered that Plaintiffsโ second motion for preliminary injunction (ECF \n7  No. 65) is denied for the reasons provided herein. \n8  It is further ordered that Plaintiffsโ motion to consolidate hearing on the second \n9  motion for preliminary injunction with a hearing on the merits (ECF No. 67) is denied as \n10  moot. \n11  It is further ordered that Plaintiffsโ supplemental brief (ECF No. 82) is stricken as \n12  improperly submitted without leave of court.  \n13  DATED THIS 27th day of May 2020. \n14 \n15   \nMIRANDA M.

SUMMARY\n13  Contending with the novel coronavirus disease (โCOVID-19โ) pandemic, Nevadaโs\n14  Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske (the โSecretaryโ), in partnership with Nevadaโs 17 \n15  county  election  officials,  developed  a  plan  to  implement  an  all-mail  election  for  the \n16  upcoming June 9, 2020 Nevada primary in order to diminish the spread of COVID-19 (the \n17  โPlanโ1). Relevantly, there are currently five states in the western United States that \n18  conduct elections entirely by mail: Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Utah, and Hawaii. \n19  Nevada also currently allows for mail-in voting in certain mailing precinctsโseparate from \n20  absent ballot precinctsโwith no reported incidents of election fraud. It is also undisputable \n21  that under NRS Chapter 293, the Nevada Legislature has vested the Secretary with \n22  authority to enact voting regulations and that the Secretary has pronounced the Plan to \n23  safeguard  the  health  and  safety  of  Nevada  voters  (and  the  larger  public)  during \n24  unprecedented times.  \n25  ///\n26  ///\n27  1The Court adopts Plaintiffsโ reference to the Plan but recognizes that Plaintiffs \nchallenge  only  the  expansion  of  voting  by  mail.  Intervenor-Defendants  have  filed  a \n28  separate action challenging other aspects of the Plan (ECF No. 27 at 3โ4) which are not \nat issue in this case.  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 2 of 24\n1  Plaintiffs William Paher, Gary Hamilton, and Terresa Monroe-Hamilton here sue \n2  the Secretary and Deanna SpikulaโRegistrar of Voters for Washoe County (โWashoe \n3  Registrarโ)โchiefly claiming that the Plan is not โchosenโ by Nevadaโs Legislature, and \n4  that an all-mail election strips voter-fraud-prevention safeguards and unconstitutionally \n5  violates Plaintiffsโ right to vote due to purported vote dilution. (ECF No. 1.) Upon these \n6  contentions and others, Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction to stop the Plan (โPI \n7  Motionโ).  \n8  The Court finds that Plaintiffs have not established an injury particularized to them \n9  to confer standing. However, even if they can establish standing, Plaintiffsโ claims fail on \n10  the merits and the other relevant factors for preliminary injunctive relief counsel against \n11  the Court enjoining Defendants from implementing the all-mail election provisions of the \n12  Plan. The Court finds that Defendantsโ interests in protecting the health and safety of \n13  Nevadaโs voters and to safeguard the voting franchise in light of the COVID-19 pandemic \n14  far outweigh any burden on Plaintiffsโ right to vote, particularly when that burden is \n15  premised on a speculative claim of voter fraud resulting in dilution of votes. The Court will \n16  therefore deny the PI Motion.2  \n17  II. BACKGROUND\n18  The following facts are taken from the Verified Complaint and exhibits attached\n19  thereto as well as the evidence submitted concerning the PI Motion. \n20  A. The Parties\n21  This action stems from the decision to hold the all-mail primary (i.e., to implement\n22  the Planโs mailing provisions), which was announced to the public on March 24, 2020. \n23  ///\n24  ///\n25 \n2In addition to the PI Motion, the Court has considered Defendantsโ and Intervenor-\n26  Defendantsโ oppositions (ECF Nos. 25 (Washoe Registrar), 27-1 (Defendant-Intervenors), \n28 (Secretary), and Plaintiffsโ reply (ECF No. 43). The Court has also deliberated the \n27  arguments  the  parties  presented  at  a  hearing  on  the  PI  Motion  on  April  29,  2020 \n(โHearingโ). Because Plaintiffsโ reply was unresponsive to Intervenor-Defendantsโ brief, \n28  the Court provided Plaintiffs an additional opportunity for Plaintiffs to respond to those \narguments at the Hearing.  \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 3 of 24\n1  (ECF No. 1-1.) The Plan applies only to Nevadaโs June 9, 2020 primary election. (Id.) The \n2  parties are described as follows. \n3  Plaintiffs are all registered Nevada voters. (ECF No. 1.) Stanley resides in Reno, \n4  Nevada and typically participates in in-person early voting. (Id.) Terresa Monroe-Hamilton \n5  and Garry Hamilton (together, โHamiltonsโ) are married, recently moved to Nevada, and \n6  also reside in Reno. (Id.) The Hamiltons ordinarily vote early or in person on election day. \n7  They registered to vote online the day before filing this lawsuit. (Id.) \n8  The Secretary is the Chief Officer of Elections for the State of Nevada, see NRS ยง \n9  293.124. (Id.) The Washoe Registrar is responsible for implementing the stateโs election \n10  laws  in  Washoe  County.  (Id.)  The  Secretary  and  Washoe  Registrar  are  collectively \n11  referenced as Defendants, where not individually referenced.  \n12  B. Impetus and Concerns that Led to the Plan\n13  The decision to implement the Plan was made to โmaintain a high level of access\n14  to the ballot, while protecting the safety of voters and poll workers[โwho belong to groups \n15  who are at high risks for severe illness from COVID-19โ].โ (ECF No. 1-1.) In decreeing \n16  the Plan, the Secretary wanted to โreassure voters in Nevada that their health and safety \n17  while  participating  in  voting  is  paramount  to  state  and  local  election  officials.โ  (Id.) \n18  Pertinently, the Secretary is quoted, stating: \n19  Because of the many uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, as \nwell as the immediate need to begin preparations for the 2020 primary \n20  election, it became necessary for me to take action regarding how the \nelection will be conducted. \n21 \n22  She further states that she, along with Nevadaโs 17 county election officials, โjointlyโ \n23  determined that โthe best option for the primary election is to conduct an all-mail election.โ \n24  (Id.) The Secretaryโs announcement of the Plan emphasized that election officials are \n25  focused on also maintaining the integrity of the election: โthe high standard Nevada has \n26  set for ensuring the security, fairness, and accuracy of elections will still be met.โ (Id.) \n27  /// \n28  /// \n3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 4 of 24\n1  C. The New Details of the Plan and Maintained Election Safeguards\n2  Under the Plan, all active registered voters will be mailed an absentee ballot (mail-\n3  in ballot) for the primary election. If a voter is registered to vote at his or her current \n4  address, they need not take any further action to receive an absentee ballot. (E.g., ECF \n5  No. 1-3.)  If an individual is not registered or needs to update registration information (e.g., \n6  name, address, and party), they are required to do so. (Id.) To accommodate same-day \n7  registration  requirements  enacted  by  the  2019  Nevada  Legislature,  the  Plan  also \n8  establishes at least one physical polling place in each of Nevadaโs counties and in Carson \n9  City. (ECF No. 1-1.)  \n10  The Plan otherwise maintains Nevadaโs election system and safeguards. (See ECF \n11  No. 21 (Decl. of Wayne Thorley, Deputy of Elections for the Secretary).) For example, \n12  NRS ยง 293.2725(1) requires first-time voters in Nevada to present identification and proof \n13  of  residency  before  being  allowed  to  vote,  whether  in  person  or  by  mail.  (Id.)  The \n14  requirements to present identification and proof of residency for first-time voters are \n15  waived pursuant to NRS ยง 293.2725(2)(b) if election officials are able to match the voterโs \n16  driverโs license number, ID card number or social security number with personal identifier \n17  on  file  with  the  Nevada  Department  of  Motor  Vehicle  (โDMVโ)  or  Social  Security \n18  Administration (โSSAโ). (Id.) \n19  When voter registration applicants register (1) by mail, (2) through the DMV by \n20  appearing in person or using the DMV's on-line system, or (3) via the Secretary of State's \n21  on-line system, the overwhelming majority of those applicants are positively matched to \n22  the personal identifiers on file with the DMV or the SSA. (Id.) The match is made through \n23  automated systems, which the Secretary finds to be highly reliable. (Id.) Voters who are \n24  positively matched to personal identifiers on file with the DMV or SSA are not required to \n25  present identification and proof of residency before voting, even if they are voting for the \n26  first time in Nevada. (Id.) They can simply vote in person or by mail without submitting to \n27  ///\n28  ///\n4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 5 of 24\n1  additional verification processes. (Id.) Voters who are not positively matched3 to personal \n2  identifiers  on  record  with  the  DMV  or  SSA  must  present  identification  and  proof  of \n3  residency before voting (referred to as โID required votersโ). (Id.) These ID required voters \n4  constitute less than 1% of all registered voters. (Id.) They have different ballot return \n5  envelopes than other voters with an envelope flap indicating that the voter must return a \n6  copy of the voterโs identification and proof of residency, without which their votes will not \n7  count. \n8  Penalties  against  fraudulent  votes are  provided  for  under, inter alia,  NRS  ยงยง \n9  293.313, 293.730(2), (3), and 293.840. \n10  D. Nevadaโs Election System Already Permits Mail-in Ballots in Mailing\nPrecincts\n11 \n12  Nevadaโs governing statutes provide for mailing precinctsโspecifically NRS ยงยง \n13  293.343 through 293.355. Through these provisions, the Nevada Legislature has given \n14  the Secretary and county clerks authority to mail ballots to registered voters rather than \n15  requiring voters to request those ballots through the absent ballot process. \n16  NRS  ยง  293.343  provides  that  โ[w]henever  the  county  clerk  has designated  a \n17  precinct as a mailing precinct, registered voters residing in that precinct may vote at any \n18  election regulated by this chapter in the manner provided in NRS [ยงยง] 293.345 to 293.355, \n19  inclusive.โ NRS ยง 293.343(2). Further, NRS ยง 293.213 gives the county clerk unilateral \n20  authority to designate a precinct as a mailing precinct if one of two conditions is met: (1) if \n21  fewer than 20 registered voters reside in that precinct, or (2) if fewer than 200 ballots were \n22  cast in the last general election. NRS ยง 293.213(1), (3). A county clerk may establish a \n23  mailing precinct that does not meet the requirements of NRS ยง 293.213(1)โ(3) โif the \n24  county clerk obtains prior approval from the Secretary of State.โ NRS ยง 293.213(4).  \n25  Mailing  precincts,  as  opposed  to  absent  ballot  precincts,  have  been  used  in \n26  Nevadaโalbeit on a small scaleโfor many years. (ECF No. 21 at 3.) In recent Nevada \n27 \n3The Deputy of Elections for the Nevada Secretary of State attests that the lack of \n28  a match is โalmost always because of a typographical or printing error in [the] application \nto register to vote.โ (ECF No. 21 at 2.)  \n5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 6 of 24\n1  elections, a statistically significant numbers of ballots were cast by the voters in mailing \n2  precincts, providing a reasonable sample of ballots cast without incidents of election fraud. \n3  (Id.) The number of ballots that voters recently cast in mailing precincts are: 2018 General \n4  election (3,879); 2018 Primary election (2,273); 2016 General election (6,069); 2016 \n5  Primary election (362); 2014 General election (4,288). (Id.) \n6  E. Lawsuit\n7  Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on April 21, 2020. The Verified Complaint asserts five\n8  claims for relief, detailed infra, and requests declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the \n9  Secretary and county administrators from implementing the Plan. (ECF No. 1 at 8โ13.) \n10  Plaintiffs  particularly  challenge  the  Planโs  expansion  of  mail-in  voting  or  in  their \n11  characterization, โ[t]he Plan would require the State to forego almost all in-person voting \n12  and instead conduct the Primary by mailed absent ballots.โ (ECF No. 1 at 9.) Plaintiffs \n13  contend  that  the  largely  all-mail  primary  circumvents  various  statutory  safeguards \n14  designed to protect against voter fraud, and that their votes will as a result be diluted by \n15  illegal votes. (E.g., id., at 2, 9, 12.) \n16  Along with the Verified Complaint, Plaintiffs filed the PI Motion, a motion to expedite \n17  briefing and hearing on the PI Motion, and a motion to consolidate the requested hearing \n18  on the PI Motion with hearing on the merits of Plaintiffsโ Verified Complaint (โConsolidation \n19  Motionโ). (ECF Nos. 1, 2, 3,4.) The Court granted the motion to expedite in part (ECF No. \n20  14) and later granted the Consolidation Motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(2) (ECF No.\n21  36)4.  The  Court  further  granted  intervention  by  the  following  parties:  Nevada  State\n22  Democratic Party (โNSDPโ), DNC Services Corporation/Democratic National Committee\n23  (โDNCโ), DCCC, Priorities USA, and John Solomon (collectively, โIntervenor-Defendantsโ).\n24  (ECF No. 39.)\n25  ///\n26  ///\n27  4However, at the Hearing the Court determined that a resolution on the merits of \nthe case should be deferred given the Secretaryโs position as to her right to assert \n28  Eleventh Amendment immunity. Such a deferral would not affect the partiesโ ability to seek \ninterlocutory appeal. \n6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 7 of 24\n1  III. PI MOTION STANDARD\n2  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 governs preliminary injunctions. โโAn injunction\n3  is a matter of equitable discretionโ and is โan extraordinary remedy that may only be \n4  awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.โโ Earth Island Inst. \n5  v. Carlton, 626 F.3d 462, 469 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council,\n6  555 U.S. 7, 22, 32 (2008)). This relief is โnever awarded as of right.โ Alliance for the Wild\n7  Rockies v. Cottrell (โAllianceโ), 623 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011). To qualify for a\n8  preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must satisfy four requirements: (1) a likelihood of success\n9  on the merits; (2) a likelihood of irreparable harm; (3) that the balance of equities favors\n10  the plaintiff; and (4) that the injunction is in the public interest. See Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.\n11  A plaintiff may also satisfy the first and third prongs by showing serious questions going\n12  to the merits of the case and that a balancing of hardships tips sharply in plaintiffโs favor.\n13  Alliance, 632  F.3d at  1135  (holding  that the  Ninth  Circuit's  โsliding  scaleโ  approach\n14  continues to be valid following the Winter decision).\n15  On the merits-success prong, โthe burdens at the preliminary injunction stage track \n16  the burdens at trial.โ Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 \n17  U.S. 418, 429 (2006); see also id. at 428 (citing Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656, 666 \n18  (2004).  \n19  IV. DISCUSSION\n20  Plaintiffsโ  claims are  that the  Plan:  (1)  violates the  right  to  vote  by  removing\n21  safeguards against fraudulent votes that dilute votes, which they claim is a severe burden; \n22  (2) violates the right to vote for legislative representatives to establish the manner of\n23  elections by substituting a scheme that replaces the Nevada Legislatureโs plan; (3) violates\n24  the right to vote under the Purcell5 principle; (4) violates Plaintiffsโ right to have, and to\n25  vote in, federal elections where the manner of election is chosen by the stateโs legislature;\n26  and (5) violates the right to a republican form of government under the United States\n27 \n28  5Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1 (2006) (per curiam). \n7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 8 of 24\n1  Constitution. (ECF No. 2 at 7โ20.)  Defendants and Intervenor-Defendants raise threshold \n2  issues about Plaintiffsโ claims that the Court will address before turning to the merits.6 \n3  A. Standing\n4  Both Defendants and Intervenor-Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to\n5  assert their claims. (ECF No. 25 at 11โ16; ECF No. 28 at 8โ10; ECF No. 27-1 at 9โ11.) \n6  The Court agrees. \n7  โArticle  III  of  the  Constitution  limits  federal-court  jurisdiction  to  โCasesโ  and \n8  โControversies.โโ Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 516 (2007). โTo satisfy Article IIIโs \n9  standing requirements, a plaintiff must show (1) it has suffered an โinjury in factโ that is (a) \n10  concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) \n11  the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, \n12  as  opposed  to  merely  speculative,  that  the  injury  will  be  redressed  by  a  favorable \n13  decision.โ Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC) Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-\n14  81 (2000) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560โ61 (1992)). The party \n15  invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements. FW/PBS, \n16  493 U.S. at 231.  Moreover, the party invoking standing also must show that it has standing \n17  for each type of relief sought. Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009). \n18  Among other things, the Secretary argues that Plaintiffs lack standing because their \n19  alleged injury is speculative and at best Plaintiffs hint at a possible injury only in the first \n20  claim for voter dilution. (ECF No. 28 at 8โ10.) Washoe Registrar similarly argues that \n21  Plaintiffsโ injury is speculative, unsupported and not particularized. (ECF No. 25 at 11โ16.) \n22  Intervenor-Defendants make the same arguments, but more fully argue why Plaintiffs have \n23  not alleged an injury-in-fact. (ECF No. 27-1 at 9โ11.) Intervenor-Defendants contend, inter \n24  alia, that Plaintiffs do not allege an injury-in-fact because Plaintiffsโ โpurported injury is no \n25  ///\n26 \n6Intervenor-Defendants argue that this Court is barred by the Eleventh Amendment \n27  from deciding this actionโwhich they contend amounts to an action to enjoin state officials \nfor alleged violations of state law. (ECF No. 27-1 at 8โ9.) Neither the Secretary nor the \n28  Washoe Registrar, who are the directly concerned parties, substantively argue the issue \nin briefing or at the Hearing. The Court will therefore not consider the issue here.  \n8 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 9 of 24\n1  different than that of any other voter in Nevada (or any other citizen who will be governed \n2  by the candidates elected through Nevadaโs elections, for that matter).โ (Id. at 10.) In \n3  briefing and at the Hearing, Plaintiffs counter that they have standing, in gist arguing that \n4  mail-in ballots are unlawful under state law, resulting in vote dilution, and that vote dilution \n5  from voter fraud results in disenfranchisement, and โdisenfranchisement is a severe \n6  burden that is personal to the person disenfranchised.โ (E.g., ECF No. 43 at 4, 7.)  \n7  Plaintiffsโ argument is difficult to track and fails to even minimally meet the first \n8  standing prong. The theory of Plaintiffsโ case, and which is the only alleged injury driving \n9  all of their claims, is that the Plan will lead to an increase in illegal votes thereby harming \n10  them as rightful voters by diluting their vote. (See generally ECF No. 1.) But Plaintiffsโ \n11  purported injury of having their votes diluted due to ostensible election fraud may be \n12  conceivably raised by any Nevada voter. Such claimed injury therefore does not satisfy \n13  the requirement that Plaintiffs must state a concrete and particularized injury. See, e.g., \n14  Spokeo Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1548 (2016) (citation omitted) (providing, inter \n15  alia, that an injury must be โconcrete and particularizedโ); Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 \n16  U.S. 555, 573โ74 (1992) (explaining that U.S. Supreme Courtโs case law has โconsistently \n17  held that a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about governmentโ\n18  claiming  only  harm  to  his  and  every  citizenโs  interest  in  proper  application  of  the \n19  Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him \n20  than it does the public at largeโdoes not state an Article III case or controversyโ).  This is \n21  not a pioneering finding. Other courts have similarly found the absence of an injury-in-fact \n22  based on claimed vote dilution. See, e.g., Am. Civil Rights Union v. Martinez-Rivera, 166 \n23  F. Supp. 3d 779, 789 (W.D. Tex. 2015) (โ[T]he risk of vote dilution[ is] speculative and, as\n24  such, [is] more akin to a generalized grievance about the government than an injury in\n25  fact.โ); cf. United States v. Florida, No. 4:12cv285-RH/CAS, 2012 WL 13034013, at *1\n26  (N.D. Fla. Nov. 6, 2012) (rejecting a motion to intervene under Rule 24 based on the same\n27  theory of vote dilution because the โasserted interests are the same . . . as for every other\n28  registered voter in the stateโ and therefore constitute โ[g]eneralized interestsโ).\n9 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 10 of 24\n1  The Secretary additionally argues that she did not violate state lawโbecause she \n2  was authorized to implement the Plan under NRS ยง 293.213(4) and therefore Plaintiffs fail \n3  to show a โcausal connectionโ between the alleged injury of vote dilution and the purported \n4  unlawful conduct they allege the Secretary has engaged in, see Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. \n5  (ECF No. 28 at 4, 7, 9.) The Court ultimately agrees with this contention in light of its \n6  findings below.7  \n7  Even if the Court had concluded that Plaintiffs have standing here, Plaintiffsโ claims \n8  also fail on the merits.8 \n9  B. The Merits of Plaintiffsโ Claims\n10  In the PI Motion, Plaintiffs focus chiefly on likelihood of success on the merits,\n11  arguing that they are likely to succeed on each of their claims. (See ECF No. 2 at 7โ20.) \n12  In considering the merits of Plaintiffsโ claims, the Court finds that Plaintiffsโ second, fourth, \n13  and fifth claims are in many ways materially intertwined, as discussed infra. The Court \n14  ultimately concludes that Plaintiffs fail to establish the merits of each claim. While the Court \n15  therefore need not further consider the Winter factors, the Court also finds that the balance \n16  of equities favors Defendants and Intervenor-Defendants and that injunction would not be \n17  in the publicโs interest.9  \n18  ///\n19  ///\n20  7Even if the Court had concluded infra that there was a violation of Nevada law in \nthe implementation of the all-mail provisions of the Plan, such as the Plan being untimely \n21  or otherwise โinconsistentโ with the intent of Nevadaโs Legislatureโwhich Plaintiffs argue, \nsee infra, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not established a nexus between such alleged \n22  violations and the alleged injury of vote dilution. \n23  8The Court does not consider Intervenor-Defendantsโ argument that Plaintiffs do \nnot state a cognizable federal cause of action because Plaintiffs have no private right of \n24  action to enforce Nevadaโs election laws. (ECF No. 27-1 at 11โ12.) \n25  9If the Court had concluded that Plaintiffs establish that they are likely to succeed \non the merits, the Court would also necessarily find irreparable harm. See Sanchez, et al. \n26  v. Cegavske, et al., 214 F. Supp. 3d 961, 976 (D. Nev. 2016) (citing Cardona v. Oakland\nUnified Sch. Dist., California, 785 F. Supp. 837, 840 (N.D. Cal. 1992) (โAbridgement or\n27  dilution of a right so fundamental as the right to vote constitutes irreparable injury.โ) &\nMelendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012) (โIt is well established that the\n28  deprivation of constitutional rights โunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.โโ)).\n10 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 11 of 24\n1  1. Plaintiffsโ First Claim\n2  Plaintiffsโ predominant claim, on which they expend most of their bandwidth, is that \n3  the Plan violates the fundamental right to vote by removing safeguards against fraudulent \n4  votesโthat  they  claim  are  attendant  to  in-person  and  request-only-absentee-ballot \n5  votingโthat dilute votes. (ECF No. 2 at 7โ15; ECF No. 43 at 3.) The Court addresses \n6  some threshold issues before turning to the merits (i.e., whether Plaintiffs have established \n7  a constitutional violation). \n8  As  an  initial  matter,  the  Court  must  determine  the  applicable  test/analytical \n9  framework for considering this argument. Plaintiffs specifically present the Anderson-\n10  Burdick balancing test/line of cases and the Reynolds-Bush line of cases as the possible \n11  frameworks for this case (ECF No. 2 at 8โ9). Compare Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. \n12  780, 788โ89 (1983) & Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992) with Reynolds v. Sims, \n13  377 U.S. 533 (1964) & Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000) (per curiam). Plaintiffs argue that \n14  the latter should govern the case because they claim that voter disenfranchisement in the \n15  form of vote dilution is at issue here and that the Anderson-Burdick balancing test is not \n16  suitable for such claims. (See id. at 9.) They additionally posit that the Anderson-Burdick \n17  line of cases should not apply because the Plan being challenged is not a state-enacted \n18  election law, to which they appear to concede the Anderson-Burdick balancing test would \n19  typically apply. (See id.) Defendants and Intervenor-Defendants argue that the Court \n20  should, like other courts, apply the Anderson-Burdick balancing test where it is alleged \n21  that an election law or policy violates the right to vote. (ECF No. 28 at 7; ECF No. 27-1 at \n22  14โ15; ECF No. 25 at 18.) \n23  The Court will apply the Anderson-Burdick balancing test. The Court finds Plaintiffsโ \n24  reasons  for  the  Reynolds-Bush  framework  and  for  rejecting  the  Anderson-Burdick \n25  balancing test, which Plaintiffs admit is ordinarily applicable to these types of cases, \n26  unpersuasive. For one, as will be explained infra, the Court disagrees with Plaintiffs that \n27  the Plan does not constitute state-enacted election law. Further, Plaintiffs provide no case \n28  where a Reynolds-Bush framework was applied within a context similar to the instant one. \n11 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 12 of 24\n1  (See id. at 9โ15.) To be sure, while Plaintiffs present this case as one about voter \n2  disenfranchisement due to purported vote dilution as a result of voter fraud; their claim of \n3  voter fraud is without any factual basis.10 Regarding the latter, Plaintiffs notably moved to \n4  consolidate the hearing on the PI Motion with a motion on the merits of the Verified \n5  Complaint, contending that the merits of this case turns on โpurely legal issues.โ (E.g., \n6  ECF No. 4 at 1.) Moreover, at least one case more recent than Reynolds, Anderson, \n7  Burdick, and BushโCrawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 190 (2008)โ\n8  applies the Anderson-Burdick balancing test.11  \n9  Plaintiffs next argue that if the Court applies the Anderson-Burdick balancing test, \n10  the Court should apply strict scrutiny in evaluating the burdens caused by the Plan. (ECF \n11  No. 2 at 8.)12 But the Supreme Court has not been so exacting. In Crawford, the Court \n12  reiterated that it has not โidentif[ied] any litmus test for measuring the severity of a burden \n13  that a state law imposes on a political party, an individual voter, or a discrete class of \n14  voters. However slight that burden may appear, as Harper [v. Virginia Bd. Of Elections, \n15  383 U.S. 663 (1966)] demonstrates, it must be justified by relevant and legitimate state \n16  interests โsufficiently weighty to justify the limitation.โโ Id. at 190 (quoting Norman v. Reed, \n17  502  U.S.  279,  288โ289  (1992));  see  also  Timmons  v.  Twin  Cities  Area  New \n18  Party, 520 U.S. 351, 359 (1997) (โNo bright line separates permissible election-related \n19  regulation  from  unconstitutional  infringements.โ).  But,  โ[w]hen  a  state  election  law \n20  ///\n21 \n10Plaintiffs, for the first time in their reply, attempt to argue voter fraud through the \n22  presentation of evidence in the form of newspaper articles. (See ECF No. 43 at 4โ5.) \n23  11The PI Motion makes no mention of Crawford and appears to suggest that \nAnderson and Burdick should not apply here also because they predate Bush. (See ECF \n24  No. 2 at 9 n.8.) \n25  12Notably, Plaintiffs concede that Bush did not discuss, much less explicate, any \nparticular level of scrutiny. (See ECF No. 2 at 10 (โBuilding on Reynolds, Bush didnโt \n26  discuss the scrutiny level, but held that the Florida Supreme Court could not by its orders \nand interpretations of state law dilute votersโ fundamental right to vote, 551 U.S. at 107โ\n27  11, which was either a per-se ban of vote dilution or at least an exercise of the strict \nscrutiny now required in equal-protection challenges involving fundamental rights with an \n28  analysis and outcome so readily apparent that it required no detailing.โ) (emphasis added). \n12 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 13 of 24\n1  provision imposes only โreasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictionsโ upon the First and \n2  Fourteenth Amendment rights of voters, โthe State's important regulatory interests are \n3  generally sufficient to justifyโ the restrictions.โ Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434 (quoting Anderson, \n4  460 U.S. at 788; see Crawford, 553 U.S. at 189โ90 (internal quotation and citations \n5  omitted) (โ[E]venhanded restrictions that protect the integrity and reliability of the electoral \n6  process itself are not invidious.โ). \n7  As  the  Supreme  Court  did  in  Crawford,  this  Court  begins  its  analysis  of  the \n8  constitutionality of the Planโs all-mail provision by focusing on the stateโs interests. See id. \n9  at 191. Here, the Secretary, acting on behalf of the State of Nevada, has identified at least \n10  two interests that justify the burdens that the Plan imposes on voters and potential voters \n11  like Plaintiffs. The Secretary expressly implemented the Plan to protect the health and \n12  safety of Nevadaโs voters and to safeguard the voting franchise. (E.g., ECF No. 1-1.) \n13  These are indisputably compelling and longstanding interests. For example, the statesโ \n14  police powers over matters of public health and safety and to act over the general welfare \n15  of their inhabitants is entrenched in the rights reserved to the state under the Tenth \n16  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution.  See  also  Reynolds,  377  U.S  at  554 \n17  (โUndeniably the Constitution of the United States protects the right of all qualified citizens \n18  to vote, in state as well as in federal elections.โ).  \n19  On the other hand, and as the Secretary puts it (ECF No. 28 at 8), Plaintiffs cannot \n20  demonstrate a burden upon their voting rights, only an imposition upon their preference \n21  for in-person votingโas opposed to mail-in voting, where ballots are mailed to voters. The \n22  same can be said regarding Plaintiffsโ emphasis on request-only-absentee-ballots, where \n23  ballots are sent to voters only if they request one. (ECF No. 2 at 12โ13, 17, 21.) Cf. \n24  McDonald v. Bd. of Election Commissioners, 394 U.S. 802, 807 (1969) (providing that the \n25  right to absentee voting (i.e., a preference where other voting options exists) is not a \n26  fundamental right because it does not in fact put the right to vote at stake). Further, \n27  Plaintiffsโ overarching theory that having widespread mail-in votes makes the Nevada \n28  ///\n13 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 14 of 24\n1  election  more  susceptible  to  voter  fraud  seems  unlikely  where  the  Plan  essentially \n2  maintains the material safeguards to preserve election integrity. (See ECF Nos. 1-1, 21.) \n3  Moreover,  although  Plaintiffs  cloak  their  preference  in  a  claim  of  voter \n4  disenfranchisement (e.g., ECF No. 2 at 8, 9, 17; ECF No. 43 at 7), Defendants may equally \n5  claim that voters will be disenfranchised. For example, if the Plan is not implemented \n6  voters worried about risks to their health or unsure about how to obtain an absentee ballot \n7  may very well be discouraged from exercising the right to vote all together. Additionally, \n8  as Defendants also point out, under the Plan, Plaintiffs mayโif they choose to exercise \n9  their preference for in-person votingโvote in person on election day at a county wide \n10  polling center regardless of their precinct per NRS ยงยง 293.3072โ.3075. (Id. at 6โ7; ECF \n11  No. 25 at 13.) The Court therefore concludes that Nevadaโs interests, reflected by the \n12  Secretary in implementing the Plan, far outweigh the burdens placed on Plaintiffsโ right to \n13  vote. Thus, Plaintiffsโ first claim fails on the merits. \n14  2. Plaintiffsโ Second and Fourth Claims\n15  For efficiency, the Court discusses Plaintiffsโ second and fourth claims in a single \n16  section because the two overlap. As noted above, Plaintiffsโ second argument is that the \n17  Plan violates the right to vote for legislative representatives to establish the manner of \n18  elections by substituting a scheme that replaces the Nevada Legislatureโs plan. (ECF No. \n19  2 at 15โ16.) This argument is expressly premised on Plaintiffsโ fourth contention. (See id. \n20  at 16; see also ECF No. 43 at 7โ8 (explaining that the violation in the second claim results \n21  due to the Plan allegedly disregarding the legislatureโs chosen manner of electionsโwhich \n22  is captured by the fourth claim).) The latter is that the Plan violates Plaintiffsโ right to have, \n23  and to vote in, federal elections where the manner of election is chosen by the stateโs \n24  legislature under Article I, section 4, clause 1 of the United States Constitution.13 (Id. at 3โ\n25  ///\n26 \n13Article I, section 4, clause 1 provides: \n27 \nThe  Times,  Places  and  Manner  of  holding  Elections  for  Senators  and \n28  Representatives,  shall  be  prescribed  in  each  State  by  the  Legislature \n14 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 15 of 24\n1  5, 17โ18.) To be clear, both arguments rest on the claim that the Plan contravenes \n2  Nevadaโs Legislature/representativesโ chosen manner of election. \n3  Plaintiffs appear to classify the June 9, 2020 Nevada Primary as a โfederalโ election \n4  because โ[c]andidates for the office of U.S. Representative are on the Primary ballot.โ (Id. \n5  at 17.) Assuming that this primary constitutes a โfederal election,โ the Court disagrees with \n6  Plaintiffsโ material premiseโthat the Plan is not the Legislatureโs chosen manner of \n7  election. \n8  The Nevada Legislature has authorized the Secretary to enact voting regulations \n9  under NRS ยง 293.124. The section provides: \n10 \n1. The Secretary of State shall serve as the Chief Officer of Elections for this\n11  State.  As  Chief  Officer,  the  Secretary  of  State  is  responsible  for  the\nexecution and enforcement of the provisions of title 24 of NRS and all other\n12  provisions of state and federal law relating to elections in this State.\n13  2. The Secretary of State shall adopt such regulations as are necessary to\ncarry out the provisions of [the election laws under Title 24โNRS Chapters\n14  293โ306].\n15  NRS ยง 293.124(1)โ(2). While at the Hearing Plaintiffsโ counsel argued that the Plan is not \n16  a regulationโbut instead a news releaseโsuch is an argument of mechanical semantics. \n17  The Plan is in fact a directive authorized by the Secretary regulating the upcoming Nevada \n18  primary. The Court therefore finds that, as a baseline, the Plan is effectively prescribed by \n19  the stateโs legislature because the Nevada Legislature has in the first instance authorized \n20  the Secretary to adopt regulations to carry out the stateโs election laws. \n21  Plaintiffs nonetheless argue that the Plan is inconsistent with the stateโs election \n22  laws, contrary to NRS ยง 293.247. (ECF No. 2 at 3โ5.) NRS ยง 293.247 pronounces: \n23 \n1. The Secretary of State shall adopt regulations, not inconsistent with the\nelection laws of this State, for the conduct of primary, general, special and\n24 \ndistrict elections in all cities and counties. Permanent regulations of the\nSecretary of State that regulate the conduct of a primary, general, special or\n25 \ndistrict election and are effective on or before the last business day of\n26  ///\n27  thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such \nRegulations, except as to the Places of ch[oo]sing Senators. \n28 \nU.S. Const. art. I, ยง 4, cl. 1. \n15 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 16 of 24\n1  February  immediately  preceding  a  primary,  general,  special  or  district \nelection govern the conduct of that election. \n2  . . . \n3  3. The regulations must prescribe: [inter alia]\n4 \n(j) Such other matters as determined necessary by the Secretary.\n5 \n4. The Secretary of State may provide interpretations and take other actions\n6  necessary for the effective administration of the statutes and regulations\ngoverning the conduct of primary, general, special and district elections in this\n7  State.\n8  (Emphasis added.) \n9  Plaintiffs  particularly  pinpoint  four  ways  in  which  they  believe  the  Plan  is \n10  โinconsistentโ with election laws. Defendants and Intervenor-Defendants largely ignore the \n11  minutiae of these purported inconsistencies. They instead directly argue that the all-mail \n12  provisions of the Plan were lawfully prescribed pursuant to, inter alia, NRS ยง 293.213(4)โ\n13  detailed supra (ECF No. 25 at 6; ECF No. 28 at 2, 4; ECF No. 27-1 at 13) NRS ยง \n14  293.247(4) (see ECF No. 25 at 5 (Washoe Registrarโs brief); and NRS ยงยง 293.343โ.355 \n15  (ECF No. 27-1 at 13)). Plaintiffs similarly fail to grapple with the statutes Defendants and \n16  Intervenor-Defendants contend authorize the all-mail in provisions of the Plan; Plaintiffs \n17  merely claim that NRS ยง 293.213(4) was not intended to apply to the whole state. (ECF \n18  No. 2 at 4 n.5.) Plaintiffs also do not particularly address subsections within NRS ยง \n19  293.247,  such  as  subsection  (4),14  which  the  Court  concludes  also  supports  the \n20  implementation of the Planโs mail-in provisions. In any event, upon considering each of \n21  Plaintiffsโ arguments of inconsistencies, the Court finds they are tenuous at best. The \n22  Court addresses each purported inconsistency in turn below.  \n23  ///\n24  ///\n25 \n14That is, Plaintiffs provide no argument beyond the claim at the Hearing that the \n26  Plan is not a regulation and therefore the subsection does not apply. But, if NRS ยง \n293.247(4) does not apply based on Plaintiffsโ โthe Plan is not a regulationโ contention, \n27  then NRS ยง 293.247(1), which Plaintiffs rely on for their claimed inconsistencies would be \nequally inapplicable. Plaintiffsโ reliance on NRS ยง 293.247(1) in briefing is an implicit \n28  concession that the Plan is a regulation.  \n16 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 17 of 24\n1  First,  Plaintiffs  argue  that  the  Plan  is  untimely,  seemingly  based  on  the  last \n2  sentence in subsection 1 of NRS ยง 293.247, because it was only announced on March 24, \n3  2020. (ECF No. 2 at 3โ4.) According to Plaintiffs, per subsection 1, the Plan had to be \n4  implemented on or before the last business day of February 2020. (Id.) Plaintiffsโ argument \n5  is flawed, at minimum, because the subject sentence clearly pertains to [p]ermanent \n6  regulations of the Secretary.โ NRS ยง 293.247(1). It is undisputed that the Plan is not \n7  intended to be permanentโit only applies to the upcoming June 9, 2020 primary. (See, \n8  e.g., ECF No. 1-2.)\n9  Second, Plaintiffs argue that the Plan is inconsistent with certain requirements \n10  under NRS ยงยง 293.205 and .206. (ECF No. 2 at 4.) It became clear at the Hearing that \n11  Plaintiffs were more precisely contending that the Planโs โdesignationโ of mailing precincts \n12  under NRS ยง 293.34315 was not timely per NRS ยง 293.205. Plaintiffsโ counsel appeared \n13  unaware that  the  PI Motion  also argues  NRS  ยง  293.206(1).  In  diligence, the  Court \n14  discusses both sections as briefed. \n15  The  first  provision,  NRS  ยง  293.205,  pertains  to  election  precincts.  Plaintiffs \n16  particularly rely on NRS ยง 293.205(1), noting that it requires county clerks to establish \n17  election precincts โon or before the third Wednesday in March of every even-numbered \n18  year.โ (Id.) NRS ยง 293.206 requires that โ[o]n or before the last day in March of every even-\n19  numbered year, the county clerk shall provide the Secretary of State and the Director of \n20  the Legislative Counsel Bureau with a copy or electronic file of a map showing the \n21  boundaries of all election precincts in the county,โ NRS ยง 293.206(1). (See id.) In making \n22  these arguments, Plaintiffs appear to recognize the obviousโthat these provisions on \n23  their face concern physical election precincts, not mail-in votes. (Id. (recognizing that \n24  county  clerks  may  establish  โmailing  precinctsโ  with  certain  exceptions  under  NRS \n25  293.343).) Plaintiffs nonetheless contend that based on NRS ยงยง 293.205(1) and .206(1) \n26  ///\n27 \n15While both the PI Motion and Plaintiffsโ reply once reference NRS ยง 293.343, \n28  neither even mentions the words โdesignateโ or โdesignation.โ (See generally ECF Nos. 2, \n43.) \n17 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 18 of 24\n1  election precincts and maps showing the precinctsโ boundaries had to be established by \n2  March 18, 2020. (Id.) \n3  However, the Plan would not violate the date requirements of NRS ยง 293.206(1) \n4  because March 24 is before the โlast day in March.โ Even accepting Plaintiffsโ position, in \n5  briefing, that the Plan is inconsistent with NRS ยงยง 293.205(1) and .206(1), based on the \n6  purported March 18 deadlines of these provisions and assuming such provisions apply \n7  here, Plaintiffsโ argument is transparently grounded on the technicality of a difference of \n8  six days. It is hard to imagine that a procedural difference of six days in implementation \n9  would render the Plan inconsistent with Nevadaโs election laws. \n10  In any event, the Court finds that Plaintiffsโ argument does not support a conclusion \n11  that the Plan is inconsistent. It is obvious that the Plan does not alter the establishment of \n12  precincts  nor  their  existence  as  a  matter  of  fact.  The  Secretary  echoes  this  in  her \n13  opposition. (See ECF No. 28 at 6 (โ[T]here were no changes to precinct boundaries . . . \n14  [t]he only change was to the method of voting within existing precinct boundaries.โ).) On\n15  its face, the Plan simply supersedes the need to appear at a physical precinct as the\n16  Secretary found โnecessaryโ due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (See ECF No. 1-1 (the\n17  Secretary explaining that the Plan was enacted because in light of the uncertainties\n18  surrounding  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  โit  became  necessary  for  me  to  take  action\n19  regarding how the election will be conductedโ).)\n20  Moreover, the Court finds that the Secretary has authority based on the plain \n21  reading of NRS ยงยง 293.213(4) and 293.247 to prescribe regulations, like the Plan here, to \n22  allow for voting by mail. Particularly, ยง 293.213(4) gives the Secretary authority to approve \n23  mailing precincts. As noted supra, Plaintiffs merely claim that NRS ยง 293.213(4) was not \n24  intended to apply to the whole state. (ECF No. 2 at 4 n.5.) But ยง 293.213(4) does not \n25  suggest such a reading because it effectively operates as an exception to the preceding \n26  sectionsโe.g., subsections (1) and (3), which permits mailing precincts if fewer than 20 \n27  registered voters reside in a precinct, or fewer than 200 ballots were cast in the precinct \n28  in the last general election, respectively. At minimum, the Secretary had the authority to \n18 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 19 of 24\n1  interpret ยง 293.213(4) to permit her to act in concert with county election officials to allow \n2  for voting by mail in all precincts pursuant to ยง 293.247(4). See NRS ยง 293.247(4) \n3  (โproviding  that  the  Secretary  โmay  provide  interpretations  and  take  other  actions \n4  necessary for the effective administration of the statutes and regulations governing the \n5  conductโ of the stateโs elections). Section 293.247(3) also requires the Secretary to \n6  prescribe, among other things, โ[s]uch other matters [i.e., forms, procedures, etc.,] as \n7  determined necessary by the Secretary of State.โ NRS ยง 293.247(3)(g). \n8  The  Courtโs  conclusion  regarding  the  Secretaryโs  authority  further  applies  to \n9  Plaintiffsโ  third  claimed  inconsistency.  (ECF  No.  2 at  4.)  Plaintiffsโ  third  assertion  of \n10  inconsistency also relies on NRS ยงยง 293.205 and .206 and similarly contends that these \n11  sections โindicate[] the [Nevada] Legislaturesโ intent for such precincts for in-person \n12  voting, not that the whole election be subsumed under an exception allowing mailing \n13  districts in certain circumstances.โ (Id.) Again, this argument in no way undermines the \n14  Secretaryโs  implementation  of  all-mail  voting  in  light  of  the  authority  the  Nevada \n15  Legislature  has  vested  with  the  Secretary  to,  for  example,  act  as  she  determines \n16  necessary. See NRS ยง 293.247(3)(g), (4). Nor does Plaintiffsโ follow-on claim that the \n17  noted NRS sections reflect the Nevada Legislatureโs intent โto have regular in-person \n18  voting and actual absentee-ballot as the controlling modelโ renders the Plan inconsistent. \n19  (Id. at 4โ5.) This latter argument is beside the point. Implementation of the Plan is a one-\n20  off situation triggered by a pandemic. It therefore would not contravene the legislatureโs \n21  intent โas [to] the controlling model.โ What is evident is that the Secretaryโs challenged \n22  action  here  also  comports  with  the  legislatureโs  intent.  Plaintiffsโ  third  argument  of \n23  inconsistency therefore fails. \n24  Finally, Plaintiffs contend in briefing, without citing to any particular provision, that \n25  where  mailing  precincts  are  created,  โcounty  clerk[s]  shall,  at  least  14  days  before \n26  establishing or designating a precinct as a mailing precinct . . . cause notice of such action \n27  to be: (a) Posted [as prescribed] . . . ; and (b) Mailed to each Assemblyman, [etc. as \n28  prescribed]โ and argue that the Plan โsupplant[s]โ this requirement. (Id. at 5.) The Court \n19 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 20 of 24\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 21 of 24\n1  4. Plaintiffsโ Third Claim\n2  Plaintiffsโ third claim is that the Plan violates the right to vote under the Purcell \n3  principle. (ECF No. 2 at 16โ17.) It is not clear that this is even a cognizable claim, though \n4  Plaintiffsโ contention contains other defects that render the purported claim meritless, \n5  which the Court discusses. \n6  In Purcell, the Supreme Court vacated an order of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n7  Circuit enjoining operation of Arizona voter identification procedures. 549 U.S. at 2.  The \n8  Supreme Courtโs ultimate ruling to vacate the Ninth Circuitโs order resulted in the subject \n9  Arizona election proceeding โwithout an injunction.โ Id. at 6. \n10  The ruling district court had denied the plaintiffsโ request for an injunction to enjoin \n11  Arizonaโs voter identification requirements. Id. at 3. In ruling, the district court did not issue \n12  findings of facts or conclusions of law. Id.17 The plaintiffs appealed and the Ninth Circuit \n13  set forth a briefing schedule that would have closed two weeks after the election. Id. The \n14  circuit court ultimately issued a four-panel order, about a month before the election, \n15  enjoining  the  enforcement  of  the  Arizona  requirement  pending  disposition  after  full \n16  briefing. Id. The court โoffered no explanation or justificationโ for its decision in the order \n17  or upon a subsequent reconsideration. Id. \n18  The Supreme Courtโs decision to vacate the Ninth Circuitโs order emphasized the \n19  โimminence of the election and the inadequate time to resolve the factual disputesโ as well \n20  as the possibility that a courtโs order, or conflicting orders concerning election provisions, \n21  may result in voter confusion. Id. at 4โ6.18 The Court underscored that such possibility \n22  ///\n23  ///\n24  17The Court noted that โ[t]hese findings were important because resolution of legal \nquestions in the Court of Appeals required evaluation of underlying factual issues.โ Purcell, \n25  549 U.S. at 3. \n26  18In vacating the circuit courtโs decision, the Court concluded that the Ninth Circuit \nfailed to necessarily give deference to the district court, although recognizing that the \n27  district court had not yet made factual findings. Purcell, 549 U.S. at 5. The Court also found \nthat the circuit courtโs decision failed to show that the โruling and findings of the District \n28  Court [were] incorrect.โ  Id. \n21 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 22 of 24\n1  should caution courts in deciding whether to grant or deny an injunction as an election \n2  draws closer. Id. \n3  This Court finds, as argued by Defendants (ECF No. 25 at 21โ23, ECF No. 28 at \n4  11), Plaintiffsโ reliance on Purcell is wholly inapposite to Plaintiffsโ position and ultimate \n5  goal hereโfor the Court to issue an injunction.19 To be sure, Purcell does not appear to \n6  support the Court deciding the PI Motion. Nonetheless, the Court considers and rejects \n7  Plaintiffsโ specific contention that, as to courts, Purcell โapplies to state and local election \n8  administratorsโ because โelection-alerting actions pose the same riskโ as to both. (Id. at \n9  16; see also id. at 17.) Plaintiffs provide no support for treating courts and states the same \n10  under Purcell. Clearly, courts and states serve very different functions in our system of \n11  governance, including in relation to prescribing the rules that govern an election. It is \n12  obvious in this regard that the states ordinarily do what the courts cannotโprescribe voting \n13  regulations. The Secretary, acting on behalf of the State of Nevada, has done so here, \n14  and the Court finds the contention that Purcell prohibits the state doing so meritless. \n15  Accordingly, Plaintiffsโ third claim fails. \n16  In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not established the merits of any of their \n17  five claims raised in the Verified Complaint. \n18  C. Balancing of the Equities\n19  The Court further finds that a balancing of the equities favors Defendants and\n20  Intervenor-Defendants. \n21  โTo determine which way the balance of the hardships tips, a court must identify \n22  the possible harm caused by the preliminary injunction against the possibility of the harm \n23  caused by not issuing it.โ Univ. of Haw. Profโl Assembly v. Cayetano, 183 F.3d 1096, 1108 \n24  ///\n25  19Plaintiffs also reference the recent Supreme Court decision in Republican Nat'l \nComm. v. Democratic Nat'l Comm. (โRNCโ), No. 19A1016, 2020 WL 1672702 (U.S. Apr. \n26  6, 2020). (ECF No. 2 at 16โ17.) In RNC, the Supreme Court relevantly stated: โThis Court \nhas repeatedly emphasized that lower federal courts should ordinarily not alter the election \n27 \nrules on the eve of an election.โ Id. at *1 (citing Purcell; Frank v. Walker, 574 U.S. 929 \n(2014); and Veasey v. Perry, 574 U. S. __, 135 S. Ct. 9 (2014)). Thus, RNC is equally \n28 \nunsupportive of Plaintiffsโ ultimate request for an injunction. \n22 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 23 of 24\n1  (9th Cir. 1999). The Court must then weigh โthe hardships of each party against one \n2  another.โ Id. \n3  As indicated above, even accepting Plaintiffsโ purported harm to them of being \n4  disenfranchised  due  to  vote  dilution,  such  disenfranchisement  could  be,  even  more \n5  concretely, claimed in the absence of the Plan (and additionally by confusion that may \n6  result by the Court enjoining the Plan, and appealโwhich would surely follow). The Court \n7  therefore  concludes  that,  at  minimum,  the  Planโs  all-mail  election  implementation  to \n8  protect the public during a public health crisis tips the scale of equity in favor of Defendants \n9  and Intervenor-Defendants (i.e., against the issuance of an injunction). \n10  D. The Public Interest\n11  โIn exercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should pay particular regard\n12  for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction.โ Winter, \n13  555 U.S. at 24. It is clear that as triggered by the uncertainties of COVID-19, the publicโs \n14  interests align with the Planโs all-mail election provisions. As provided above, an injunction \n15  precluding  Defendantsโ  use  of  mail  ballots  in  the  June  9,  2020  Primary  would  put \n16  Nevadans at risk and may result in the very type of confusion that Purcell cautions against. \n17  In short, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not proven that they are entitled to have \n18  this Court enjoin the Planโs challenged provisions. \n19  V. CONCLUSION\n20  The Court notes that the parties made several arguments and cited to several cases\n21  not discussed above. The Court has reviewed these arguments and cases and determines \n22  that they do not warrant discussion as they do not affect the outcome of the issues before \n23  the Court. \n24  /// \n25  /// \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28  /// \n23 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243-MMD-WGC   Document 57   Filed 04/30/20   Page 24 of 24\n \n1  It is therefore ordered that Plaintiffsโ motion for preliminary injunction (ECF No. 2) \n2  is denied for the reasons provided herein. \n3  DATED THIS 30th day of April 2020. \n4   \n5                           \n            MIRANDA M.

Nevada Secretary of State (โSecretaryโ) and Nevada county clerks and registrars of voters\n25\n(โCounty Administratorsโ) intend to conduct the June 9, 2020, Nevada state and federal primary\n26\nelection under the โall-mail electionโ plan (โPlanโ) on the Secretaryโs website. Under the Plan,\n27\nthe Secretary and County Administrators intend to mail unrequested absentee ballots (herein\n28\n1\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243   Document 1   Filed 04/21/20   Page 2 of 17\n1 โmail-in ballotsโ) to active registered voters only: โAll active registered voters in Nevada will be\n2 mailed an absentee ballot[1] for the primary election. No action or steps, such as submitting an\n3 absentee ballot request application, will be required by individual voters in order to receive a bal-\n4 lot in the mail.โ Ex. A. \n5 2.  The Plan strips vote-fraud-prevention safeguards established by the Legislature, which\n6 allows illegal voting that violates Votersโ right to vote by dilution. Among other constitutional\n7 flaws , the Plan is not what the Legislature chose as required, U.S. Const. art I, ยง 4, cl. 1, so it\n8 may not be used where as here federal candidates are on the ballot. See\n9 https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/home/showdocument?id=8461 (Nevada Secretary of State, โ2020\n10 Non-Judicial Candidates Filed with the Secretary of State,โ attached as Ex. F).\n11 3. The Plan violates Votersโ (i) right to vote under the U.S. Constitution (due to vote dilu-\n12 tion), (ii) right to vote in a federal election compliant with the U.S. Constitution at Article I, ยง 4,\n13 cl. 1, and (iii) right to a republican form of government under Article IV, ยง 4 of the U.S. Consti-\n14 tution.\n15 Jurisdiction and Venue\n16 4.  This action arises under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, the First and Fourteenth Amendments to\n17 the Constitution of the United States, and Article I, Section IV the Constitution of the United\n18 States.   \n19 5.   This Court has jurisdiction over all claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sections 1331 and\n20 1343(a). It also has jurisdiction pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act as codified at 28\n21 U.S.C. Sections 2201 and 2202. \n22 6.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. Section 1391(b) because it is where at least one of the\n23 Defendants reside. \n24\n25\n26\n1 The Secretary uses โabsentee ballotโ synonymously with the Nevada term โabsent bal-\nlot,โ Nevada Revised Statutes (โNRSโ) 293.013. Ex. A. But because the ballots are not sent per\n27\nthe legislatively required absent-ballot request procedure, they are actually like the  mail-in bal-\n28 lots sent in statutory all-mail-voting plans, such as used in California.\n2\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243   Document 1   Filed 04/21/20   Page 3 of 17\n1 Parties\n2 7.

Her responsibilities include, but are not limited to, execution and enforce-\n15 ment of all provisions of state and federal law relating to elections, and adoption of such regula-\n16 tions as necessary to carry out the provisions of the stateโs election code, including the manner,\n17 number, and form of ballots to be printed for the state, and the distribution of ballots to precincts\n18 and districts . \n19 11. Defendant Deanna Spikula is the Registrar of Voters in Washoe County, Nevada and is\n20 named as a Defendant in her official capacity. She is responsible for implementing Nevadaโs\n21 election laws, and her responsibilities include, but are not limited to establishing polling places,\n22 overseeing the election board, mailing ballots to registered voters, and implementing the Ballot\n23 Rejection Rules. See Generally Nev. Rev. Stat. ยง 293.\n24 Factual Allegations\n25 12. Under Nevada law, the primary election must be held on the second Tuesday in June of\n26 each even-numbered year. NRS 293.175(1). The 2020 Nevadaโs Primary is June 9. Candidates\n27 for the office of U.S. Representative are on the ballot for the June 9 primary. See Ex. F.\n28\n3\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243   Document 1   Filed 04/21/20   Page 4 of 17\n1 The Plan\n2 13. On March 24, 2020, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Secretary, and County\n3 Administrators announced the Plan: โto conduct an all-mail election for the June 9, 2020 primary\n4 election.โ Press Release, Nev. Secโy of State, Secretary Cegavske Announces Plan to Conduct the\n5 June 9, 2020 Primary Election by All Mail (Mar. 24, 2020),\n6 https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/Home/Components/News/News/2823/309 (Ex. A); see also\n7 https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/elections/voters/absentee-voting (Ex. B). \n8 14.  Under the Plan: โAll active registered voters in Nevada will be mailed an absentee ballot\n9 for the primary election. No action or steps, such as submitting an absentee ballot request appli-\n10 cation, will be required by individual voters in order to receive a ballot in the mail.โ Ex. A.\n11 15. Others who are qualified voters but not โactiveโ wonโt get an absentee ballot without ap-\n12 plying for one: โAny registered voter may request to vote by mail. To request an absent ballot,\n13 you must complete and submit an Absent Ballot Request Form to the County Clerk/Registrar of\n14 Voters in the county where you are registered to vote.โ Ex. B.\n15 16.  Voters will mark their ballot at home โand then return it by mail using a postage-prepaid\n16 envelope or by dropping it off in person at a designated county location.โ Id.\n17 17. Voters are reminded that mail-in ballots must be dropped off in person by the close of\n18 polls on Election Day, or postmarked by Election Day. Id.\n19 18.  Ballots that are postmarked by Election Day and received no later than seven days after\n20 the election will be counted.  Additionally, if a voter fails to sign the ballot return envelope or the\n21 voterโs signature does not match the one on file with the county election official, the voter will be\n22 contacted, and the voter will have up to the seventh day after the election to make the necessary\n23 correction.  It is important to understand that these statutory deadlines will result in updating vote\n24 totals and election results for up to seven days after the election. Id.\n25 19. In Washoe Countyโs notice, created on April 10, 2020, it details the Plan.Ex. C. Washoe\n26 County voters will receive a mail-in ballot. Voters may return these ballots either by mailing\n27 them through the U.S. Postal Service or by dropping them at the Registrarโs Office in Reno, Ne-\n28 vada. Id.\n4\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243   Document 1   Filed 04/21/20   Page 5 of 17\n1 20. As an example, the Elko County clerkโs office has similarly released the Plan. It has\n2 stated that it will mail ballots to โ[a]ll registered votersโ only โduring the first part of May 2020.โ\n3 Ex. D and E. Voters may return their ballots by mail or by dropping them off in person. Id.\n4 21. Similarly, the Clark County clerkโs notice, created April 2, 2020, details the Plan.Ex. G.\n5 All active voters in Clark County will receive a mail ballot. But Clark county will mail an addi-\n6 tional notice. โAll inactive voters will be receiving a notice in the mail asking them to update\n7 their information in order to be listed as active voters and receive a mail ballot for the 2020 Pri-\n8 mary Election.โ Id.\n9 Nevada Election Law\n10 22.  The Nevada Legislature has enacted detailed legislation governing how elections are to\n11 be conducted in NRS Title 24, Chapter 293 (titled โElections).2\n12 23. Chapter 293 requires the Secretary to enact implementing regulations, but ยง 247 limits\n13 that to when a regulation (i) is consistent with legislation and (ii) in place by the last business day\n14 of February before the primary:\n15 The Secretary of State shall adopt regulations, not inconsistent with the election laws of this\nState, for the conduct of primary, general, special and district elections in all cities and\n16 counties. Permanent regulations of the Secretary of State that regulate the conduct of a\nprimary, general, special or district election and are effective on or before the last business\n17 day of February immediately preceding a primary, general, special or district election govern\nthe conduct of that election.\n18\nNRS 293.247 (emphasis added). \n19\n24. The law mandates that county clerks โshall establish election precinctsโ3 โon or before the\n20\nthird Wednesday in March of every even-numbered year.โ NRS 293.205. Although county clerks\n21\nmay establish โmailing precinctsโ (where all ballots are mailed, with certain exceptions) under\n22\ncertain guidelines, NRS 293.343, those like all precincts had to be established by March 18 under\n23\nNRS 293.205. \n24\n25. Moreover, โon or before the last day in March of every even-numbered year, the county\n25\n26\n2 Available at https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-293.html.\n27\n3 โ[S]tatutes . . . that employ the term โshallโ are presumptively mandatory.โ Nev. Pub.\n28 Emps. Ret. Bd. v. Smith, 129 Nev. 618, 627, 310 P.3d 560, 566 (2013) (citation omitted).\n5\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243   Document 1   Filed 04/21/20   Page 6 of 17\n1 clerk shall provide the Secretary of State and the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau with\n2 a copy or electronic file of a map showing the boundaries of all election precincts in the county,โ\n3 NRS 293.206, and this was apparently not done given the substitution of the Plan. \n4 26. The law requires that clerks establish and the Secretary approve maps of precincts,\n5 293.205 and .206, indicates the Legislatureโs intent for such precincts for in-person voting, not\n6 that the whole election be subsumed under an exception allowing mailing districts in certain cir-\n7 cumstances, e.g., โwhenever there were not more than 20 voters registered in a precinct for the\n8 last preceding general election, the county clerk may establish that precinct as a mailing pre-\n9 cinct,โ NRS 293.213(1).\n10 27. The intent of the Legislature to have regular in-person voting and absentee procedures as\n11 the controlling model, with certain exceptions, is evidenced throughout Chapter 293 in its provi-\n12 sions for regular voting. The Plan is not the Legislatureโs prescribed manner.\n13 28. Where mailing precincts are created, โcounty clerk[s] shall, at least 14 days before estab-\n14 lishing or designating a precinct as a mailing precinct . . . cause notice of such action to be: (a)\n15 Posted [as prescribed] . . . ; and (b) Mailed to each Assemblyman, [etc. as prescribed]. Id.\n16 29. NRS 293.3568 requires provision for early in-person voting at permanent polling places,\n17 but the Clark County Registrar of Votersโ doesnโt identify locations for doing that. (Ex. G.)  The\n18 Secretary and County Administrators have apparently determined that ยง 3568 is no longer appli-\n19 cable and that โ[i]f a request is made to vote early by a registered voter in person, the election\n20 board shall issue a ballot for early voting to the voter,โ NRS 293.356, they need not comply. That\n21 โballot must be voted on the premises of a polling place,โ id., but in this case, the Registrar has\n22 decided to circumvent the Legislature and only provide a mail ballot drop-off location and not a\n23 permanent or temporary location to request a ballot and have it voted there.\n24 Anti-Vote-fraud Safeguards\n25 30. Nevada requires that โa person who registered by mail or computer shall, for the first\n26 election in which the person votes at which that registration is valid, vote in person unless he or\n27 she has previously voted in the county in which he or she is registered to vote.โ NRS 293.272(1).\n28 And an individual who registers at the Department of Motor vehicles, by mail, or by computer\n6\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243   Document 1   Filed 04/21/20   Page 7 of 17\n1 must present valid identification and a document establishing residence. NRS.293.2725.4\n2 31. For all in-person voters whose name appears on the roster of registered voters (or they\n3 provide an affirmation that they are entitled to vote), the voter โstate his or her name to the elec-\n4 tion board officer in charge of the roster,โ who โshall . . . [a]nnounce the name of the registered\n5 voter,โ require a signature and then authenticate it or resolve any discrepancy. NRS 293.285. The\n6 voter โmust sign his or her name in the roster or on a signature card when he or she applies to\n7 vote.โ NRS.293.277(1). This is all done before witnesses who may know the person, but in any\n8 case can watch the personโs demeanor and can see if the person is trying to duplicate a signature\n9 from an exemplar or produces the signature spontaneously. There are some exceptions, but those\n10 are the general rules, and they allow local poll workers and watchers to monitor who is voting\n11 and deny voting and issue challenges if appropriateโas does in-person voting in general. \n12 32. The signature is then compared by an election board officer with the signature on file or\n13 on approved identification cards, such as a driverโs license. Id. at (1)-(2). Records are checked to\n14 assure the voter has not already voted. Id. at (3). The law provides that any person who votes\n15 knowing he or she is not qualified commits a Class D felony, as does one attempting to vote in\n16 the name of another. NRS 293.775. The same penalty applies to those voting more than once in\n17 the same election. NRS 293.780\n18 33. Nevada requires the safeguard that a voter must request the ballot: โExcept as provided in\n19 NRS 293.272 and 293.502, a registered voter may request an absent ballot if, before 5 p.m. on\n20 the 14th calendar day preceding the election, the registered voter; (a) Provides sufficient written\n21 notice to the county clerk; and (b) Has identified himself or herself to the satisfaction of the\n22 county clerk.โ NRS 293.313. \n23 34. The Nevada Administrative Code provides that, โA clerk that receives a request for an\n24 absent ballot shall: (1) Compare the address of the voterโs residence in this State which is indi-\n25 cated on the request with the address which is indicated on the voterโs application to register to\n26\n4 Likewise, where mail voting has been authorized by law, individuals could only vote by\n27\nmail if they provide the county clerk the same information required at the polling location. NRS\n28 293.2725(1)(b)(1)-(2).\n7\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243   Document 1   Filed 04/21/20   Page 8 of 17\n1 vote.โ NAC 293.295. 293.295. If the address is different on the voter registration and absent bal-\n2 lot applications, the court will send a written notice including: โ(a) A copy and explanation of the\n3 provisions set forth in NRS 293.525; and (b) A postcard to be returned by the voter to the county\n4 clerk which includes verification of the address of the voterโs residence in this State.  The county\n5 clerk shall use a postcard that may not be forwarded to an address of the voter which is different\n6 from the address to which the notice is mailed.โ NAC 293.295(2). \n7 35. The safeguards in place when a registered voter moved โfrom one precinct to another or\n8 from one congressional district to another within the same countyโ require that the registered\n9 voter โmust be allowed to vote in the precinct where the elector previously residedโ but only after\n10 โproviding an oral or written affirmation before an election board officer attesting to his or her\n11 new address.โ NRS 293.525. Even if the registered voter moved within the same precinct, that\n12 elector must only be โallowed to vote after providing an oral or written affirmation before an\n13 election board officer attesting to his or her new address.โ Id.\n14 Claims for Relief\n15 Count I\n     The Plan violates the right to vote by removing safeguards against fraudulent votes that\n16 dilute legal votes.\n17 36. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all prior paragraphs of this Complaint and\n18 the paragraphs below as though fully set forth herein.\n19 37.  The federal right to vote is fundamental, Harper v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S.\n20 663, 667 (1966), and well-established: โUndeniably the Constitution of the United States protects\n21 the right of all qualified citizens to vote, in state as  well as in federal electionsโ and to have that\n22 vote counted. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 554 (1964). \n23 38. โThe right to vote can neither be denied outright, nor destroyed by alteration of ballots,\n24 nor diluted by ballot-box stuffing.โ Id. at 555 (internal citations omitted). โAnd the right of suf-\n25 frage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizenโs vote just as effec-\n26 tively as by  wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.โ Id.\n27 39. The right to vote inheres in, and is protected by, the First and Fourteenth Amendments of\n28 the U.S. Constitution.\n8\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243   Document 1   Filed 04/21/20   Page 9 of 17\n1\n40.  Nevada also recognizes a right to vote: โAll [qualified voters] shall be entitled to vote for\n2\nall officers that now or hereafter may be elected by the people, and upon all questions submitted\n3\nto the electors at such election.โ Nev. Const. art 2, ยง 1. Article 1, ยงยง 8 and 9 of the Nevada Con-\n4\nstitution protect against violations of due process (including for โlibertyโ deprivation) and free\n5\nspeech rights and provide protection for the right to vote, as does Article 4, ยง 21 safeguards equal\n6\nprotection and so protects the right to vote from disparate treatment.\n7\n41. Both in-person and absentee ballot voting laws encompass safeguards that protect against\n8\nvoter fraud. For in-person voting, among other protections see supra ยถยถ 31,33,34, a first-time\n9\nvoter generally must appear in person with identification and proof of residence location. NRS\n10\n293.272(1). To obtain an absentee ballot, among other protections see supra ยถยถ 32-36, a voter\n11\nmust request the ballot and โidentif[y] himself or herself to the satisfaction of the county\n12\nclerk.โ NRS 293.313. Yet, the Plan strips statutory protections by the Legislature to prevent such\n13\nfraud. \n14\n42. Both the in-person voting and absentee voting demonstrate a statutory scheme that en-\n15\nsures multiple levels of verification before voting to guarantee the integrity of the voting process.\n16\nVoters casting fraudulent ballots face the threat of felony prosecution. All of these protections\n17\nand penalties are provided by the Legislature and may not be overruled and replaced by govern-\n18\nment officials as in the Plan. \n19\n43.  The Plan would require the State to forego almost all in-person voting and instead con-\n20\nduct the Primary by mailed absent ballots. An election conducted by mail ballot only, per the\n21\nPlan, would all but ensure an election replete with both ballot fraud.\n22\n44. The Plan violates the Votersโ right to vote by diluting their votes with illegal votes given\n23\nthe removal of safeguards against illegal voting established by the Legislature. \n24\n25 Count II\n  The Plan violates the right to vote for legislative representatives to establish the manner of\n26 elections by substituting a scheme that replaces the legislaturesโ plan.\n27 45. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all prior paragraphs of this Complaint and\n28 the paragraphs below as though fully set forth herein.\n9\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243   Document 1   Filed 04/21/20   Page 10 of 17\n1 46. Voters voted for representatives with plenary power to govern the manner of voting to\n2 represent them and the Voters did not vote for the Secretary and County Administrators to repre-\n3 sent them. Yet the manner of voting proposed here is to be decided by the Secretary and County\n4 Administrators instead of the elected representatives in the Legislature. \n5 47.  While state and local officials face balloting, they are not elected to be representatives of\n6 the People in the Legislature. That eliminates representation, representatives, and the right to\n7 vote for representatives in the Legislature to decide the manner of elections. \n8 48. That right to vote is fundamental, Harper, 383 U.S. at 667, and protected by the First and\n9 Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, as well as Article 2, ยง 1 of the Nevada Consti-\n10 tution (โAll [qualified voters] shall be entitled to vote for all officers that now or hereafter may\n11 be elected by the people, and upon all questions submitted to the electors at such election.โ), and\n12 Article 1, ยงยง 8 and 9, which protect against violations of due process (including for โlibertyโ de-\n13 privation) and free speech rights and so provide protection for the right to vote. โUndeniably the\n14 Constitution of the United States protects the right of all qualified citizens to vote, in state as \n15 well as in federal electionsโ and to have that vote counted. Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 554.\n16 49. The Plan would overrule and replace the representativesโ chosen manner of election, the\n17 Votersโ votes for representatives who would decide the manner of elections is invalidated. That\n18 violates the Votersโ right to vote.\n19\nCount III\n20 The Plan violates the right to vote under the Purcell Principle.\n21 50. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all prior paragraphs of this Complaint and\n22 the paragraphs below as though fully set forth herein.\n23 51. The Purcell Principle is anchored in the right to vote and its potential for debasement. \n24 Purcell, 549 U.S. 1, 4 (citing Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 555). The Court held in Purcell that  โ[c]ourt\n25 orders affecting elections, especially conflicting orders, can themselves result in voter confusion\n26 and consequent incentive to remain away from the polls. As an election draws closer, that risk\n27 will increase.โ 549 U.S. at 4-5. \n28 52. The U.S. Supreme Court recently applied this principle in Republican National Commit-\n10\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243   Document 1   Filed 04/21/20   Page 11 of 17\n1 tee v. Democratic National Committee, No. 19A1016 (U.S. Apr. 6, 2020) (per curiam) and sum-\n2 marized: โThis Court has repeatedly emphasized that lower federal courts should ordinarily not\n3 alter the election rules on the eve of an election. See Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U. S. 1 (2006) (per\n4 curiam); Frank v. Walker, 574 U. S. 929 (2014); Veasey v. Perry, 574 U. S. __ (2014).\n5 53. The general rule is that no court order altering election procedures near an election is per-\n6 missible because it violates the right to vote. And because the Principle is anchored in the right to\n7 vote, it applies to state and local election administrators as well because their election-altering\n8 actions pose the same risk.\n9 54. The โpossibility that qualified voters might be turned away from the polls,โ Purcell at 4,\n10 violates their right to vote.\n11 55. The Plan alters the nature of Nevadaโs election, changing it from an in-person election\n12 with absentee ballots received by request to a scheme of mailing mail-in ballots to some, but not\n13 all, registered voters and highly restricted walk-in voting options. The same risk of voters losing\n14 their franchise because of the confusion caused by this recent Plan exists.\n15\nCount IV\n16 The Plan violates the Votersโ right to have, and to vote in, federal elections with the man-\nner of election is chosen by the legislature (U.S. Const. art I, ยง 4, cl. 1).\n17\n56. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all prior paragraphs of this Complaint and\n18\nthe paragraphs below as though fully set forth herein.\n19\n20 57. The Plan violates Votersโ right to have, and to vote in, a federal election where the โMan-\n21 nerโ of election is โprescribed . . . by the Legislature,โ as required: \n22\nThe Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representa-\n23 tives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress\nmay at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of\n24 chusing Senators.\n25 U.S. Const. art. I, ยง 4, cl. 1. \n26 58. Candidates for the office of U.S. Representative are on the ballot for the June 9 primary.\n27 Ex. F. Therefore, the June 9 primary must be conducted in the Legislatureโs prescribed manner. \n28 59. But the Plan is not at all what the Legislature chose and is contrary to controlling legisla-\n11\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243   Document 1   Filed 04/21/20   Page 12 of 17\n1 tion. See supra ยถยถ 24-31.  The Secretary and County Administrators chose a manner not autho-\n2 rized by the Legislature and contrary to the Legislatureโs choices. See supra ยถยถ 15-23 .\n3 60. They have eliminated safeguards against vote fraud that the Legislature chose. See Supra\n4 ยถยถ 32-37.\n5 61. The Plan violates Article I, ยง 4, cl. 1, including a violation of the Voterโs right to have,\n6 and to vote in, such an election as the U.S. Constitution prescribes. \n7\nCount V\n8 The Plan violates the right to a republican form of government under the United States\nConstitution.\n9\n10 62. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all prior paragraphs of this Complaint and\n11 the paragraphs below as though fully set forth herein.\n12 63. The loss of representative government and invalidation of votes for legislators identified\n13 in the preceding claims violates the Votersโ right to a republican form of government under the\n14 U.S. Constitution. Article IV, ยง 4, of the U.S. Constitution provides that โthe United States shall\n15 guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of governmentโ (โGuarantee Clauseโ). \n16 64.  A republican form of government is lost if a Secretary of State and County Administra-\n17 tors supplant the peopleโs elected representative in exercising powers entrusted entirely to the\n18 Legislature, in this case establishing the manner of elections. \n19 65. The U.S. Constitution is founded on and derived from the will of the people who hold the\n20 ultimate power, see U.S. Const. preamble (โWe the people . . . .โ), the people have a right to the\n21 republican government they chose in their own exercise of that political will and which the\n22 United States guarantees.\n23 66. The Plan would violate the very foundational rights of the Voters to a republican form of\n24 government and to vote in manner established under a republican form of government.\n25 Prayer for Relief\n26 Wherefore, Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court: \n27 1.  Declare that the Plan violates the right to vote the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the\n28 U.S. Constitution and Nev. Const. art 2, ยง 1. Article 1, ยงยง 8 and 9 of the Nevada Constitution and\n12\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00243   Document 1   Filed 04/21/20   Page 13 of 17\n1 strips safeguards against fraudulent votes that dilute legal votes; \n2 2. Declare that the Plan violates the right to vote under the First and Fourteenth Amendments\n3 of the U.S. Constitution, as well as Article 2, ยง 1 of the Nevada Constitution, because the Secre-\n4 tary and County Administratorsโ Plan overrules and replaces the legislatorโs chosen manner of\n5 elections; \n6 3. Declare that the Plan violates the right to vote under the Purcell Principle;\n7 4. Declare that the Plan violates Article I, ยง 4 , cl. 1 of the U.S. Constitution;\n8 5.
