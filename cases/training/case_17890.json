That Act provides that the authority to enact laws / rules restricting the use of union security agreements vests exclusively with the Illinois General Assembly. Plaintiffs support Illinois House Joint Resolution Constitutional Amendment (HJRCA) 37 (or Collective Bargaining Freedom Amendment), which proposes an amendment to the state constitution prohibiting laws that restrict or interfere with workers right to, among other things, to prohibit / restrict the right of private sector employers and employees to enter into and administer union security agreements. In order for constitutional amendments to make the ballot, Illinois state constitution (Art XIV, Section 2) requires satisfaction of one of three procedures, of which a constitutional convention or 3/5 vote of the general assembly at least 6 months prior to the next election, and for the amendment to be published to voters 1 month prior to the election, is one. The Collective Bargaining Freedom Amendment was introduce in January 2020 but then the state's response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the cancellation of a number of legislative sessions, and it became impossible for the amendment to satisfy the 6-month requirement. The Plaintiffs and other citizens of Illinois allege they lost their rights to petition for the advance of the amendment, and this constituted a violation of their rights under the state constitution (unreasonably restricting right to associate for political purposes and access to being on the ball and to have the opportunity to vote on the amendment) and the 1st and 4th amendments to the US constitution (unreasonably restricting associational and voting rights). The judge denied the TRO without prejudice as premature in May 2020, as it was then possible for the General Assembly to adopt the amendment proposal during its then current legislative session. In June 2020, the Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice.</blockquote>",

This case is an emergency in light of the current public health crisis caused \nby the novel coronavirus, which resulted in the Governorโs emergency orders effectively shutting \ndown the State.  Consequently, the General Assembly cancelled sessions in both the House and \nthe Senate from March 18, 2020, through at least May 3, 2020.   \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02791 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/08/20 Page 2 of 28 PageID #:2\nAccordingly, Plaintiffs Fight Back Fund, James M. Sweeney, and the International Union \nof Operating Engineers, Local 150, AFL-CIO, hereby file suit against the Illinois State Board of \nElections; William J. Cadigan, Katherine S. OโBrien, Laura K. Donahue, Cassandra B. Watson, \nWilliam R. Haine, Ian K. Linnabary, Charles W. Scholz, and William M. McGuffage, in their \nofficial capacities as Board Members for the Illinois State Board of Elections; and, Jesse White, in \nhis official capacity as Illinois Secretary of State, for constitutional violations arising under Article \nIII, Section 3, of the Illinois Constitution and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution and brought under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  In support thereof, Plaintiffs allege the \nfollowing: \nJurisdiction and Venue \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 because this action arises under \nthe  Constitution  and  laws  of  the  United  States.    This  Court  also  has  jurisdiction  under \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1343(a)(3) because this action seeks to redress the deprivation, under color of state \nlaw, of rights secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States. Finally, this Court has \nsupplemental  jurisdiction  over  the  claims  for  the  deprivation  of  rights  under  the  Illinois \nConstitution pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(a). \n2.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 because Defendants \nmaintain offices and/or reside in this District.  Plaintiffs Sweeney and Local 150 also maintain \noffices and/or reside in this District. \nParties \n3.  Plaintiff  Fight  Back  Fund  is  a  not-for-profit  social  welfare  organization \nheadquartered  in  Countryside,  Cook  County,  Illinois.    The  Fight  Back  Fund  is  funded  by \ncontributions from tens of thousands of working people who are taxpayers and voters in the state \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02791 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/08/20 Page 3 of 28 PageID #:3\nof Illinois and has the purpose of promoting fairness, opportunity, and equal pay.  Plaintiff Fight \nBack Fund is a strong supporter of House Joint Resolution Constitutional Amendment (โHJRCAโ) \n37, better known as the Collective Bargaining Freedom Amendment.  HJRCA 37, which was \nintroduced by Representative Lance Yednock on January 23, 2020, and supported by Senator \nRam Villivalam, proposes to amend the Bill of Rights Article of the Illinois Constitution to \nprohibit any law from being passed that restricts or interferes with the ability of workers to join \ntogether and collectively bargain over wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment, \nincluding union security agreements.   \n4.  While these taxpayer and voter contributors have standing to sue in their own right, \none purpose of the Fight Back Fund is to stand up for middle class families by opposing so-called \nโRight-to-Workโ laws.  The Fight Back Fund can help vindicate its contributorsโ rights and obtain \nappropriate relief in this case.   \n5.  Plaintiff Sweeney is a state and municipal taxpayer, registered voter, and resides in \nChicago,  Cook  County,  Illinois.    Plaintiff  Sweeney  is  President-Business  Manager  of  the \nInternational Union of Operating Engineers, Local 150, AFL-CIO, and strong supporter of the \nproposed Collective Bargaining Freedom Amendment. \n6.  Plaintiff International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 150, AFL-CIO (โLocal \n150โ or โthe Unionโ), is a โlabor organizationโ under federal law.  Local 150โs principal office is \nlocated in Countryside, Cook County, Illinois.  It negotiates and administers collective bargaining \nagreements which cover the work performed by employees within the geographic jurisdiction of \nthe Union and this Court.  Local 150 represents thousands of Illinois voters and taxpayers, most \nor all of which support the proposed Collective Bargaining Freedom Amendment to the Illinois \nConstitution that was introduced by Representative Yednock and supported by Senator Villivalam. \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02791 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/08/20 Page 4 of 28 PageID #:4\n7.  While these resident taxpayer and voter members have standing to sue in their own \nright, one purpose of a union is to help protect the constitutional and property rights of its members, \nand Local 150 can help vindicate its membersโ rights and obtain appropriate relief in this case. \n8.  Defendants  William  J.  Cadigan,  Katherine  S.  OโBrien,  Laura  K.  Donahue, \nCassandra  B.  Watson,  William  R.  Haine,  Ian  K.  Linnabary,  Charles  W.  Scholz,  and \nWilliam M. McGuffage are members of the Illinois Board of Elections and are empowered to \nenforce and administer Illinois election laws, including certifying to the several county clerks all \nproposals to amend the constitution. \n9.  Defendant Illinois Board of Elections is specifically empowered by Illinois law to \ncertify all proposals to amend the Constitution.  It maintains an office located in Chicago, Illinois. \n10.  Defendant  Jesse  White  is  named  in  his  official  capacity  as  the  duly  elected \nSecretary  of  State.

The Great Depression of the 1930s, triggered by the stock market crash of 1929, \nleft millions of Americans out of workโby some estimates, nearly 25 percent of the workforce.  \nU.S. Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1957, at \n78 (U.S. Govt. Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1960); Ira Katznelson, Fear Itself: The New \nDeal and the Origins of Our Time (Liveright Publishing Co., New York 2013).  Labor strikes and \nother forms of industrial unrest plagued an already weakened economy. \n14.  In 1932, Americans elected Democratic Party candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt to \nthe first of his four terms as President.  Along with Democratic majorities in Congress, FDR \npledged a New Deal for Americans to fight the Depression.  Chief among the New Deal Reforms \nwas the codification of the eight-hour workday, guaranteeing overtime over forty (40) hours \nworked and a minimum wage.  Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. ยง 203 (1935). \n15.  The New Deal also guaranteed for the first time the rights of all private sector \nemployees to โform, join, and assistโ unions.  29 U.S.C. ยง 157.  The purpose of the National Labor \nRelations Act (NLRA) as stated in the โFindings and Declaration of Policyโ of the NLRA states \n(29 U.S.C. ยง 151): \nIt is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States to eliminate the causes of \ncertain substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce and to mitigate and \neliminate these obstructions when they have occurred by encouraging the practice \nand procedure of collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers \nof full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives \nof their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of \ntheir employment or other mutual aid or protection. \n \nAccording to the U.S. Senate Committee Report: \nThe first objective of the Bill is to promote โindustrial peace.โ  II Leg. Hist. NLRA \n2300 (1935).  Congress relied on economic statistics showing productivity lost to \nstrikes, but also spoke repeatedly of the violence associated with โindustrial strifeโ \nand economic unrest. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02791 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/08/20 Page 6 of 28 PageID #:6\n \nThe second major objective of the Bill is to encourage, by developing the procedure \nof collective bargaining, that equality of bargaining power which is a prerequisite \nto equality and opportunity and freedom of contract.โ  II Leg. Hist. NLRA 2302 \n(1935).  Congress believed the โeconomic adjustmentโ necessary to end the Great \nDepression and fix the โboom-bust economicโ cycle was to improve the bargaining \npower of average workers so as โto stabilize competitive conditions and to spread \nadequate consumer purchasing power throughout the nation at large.โ \n \n16.  The passage of the Wagner Act in 1935 led to an explosion of union organizing and \nstrikes in America.  Opposition to the New Deal and the NLRA grew in the late 1930s.  Southern \nDemocrats in Congress abandoned President Roosevelt and aligned themselves with anti-union \nbusiness interests in the North.  As Professor Katznelson explained: \nLabor organizing, they saw, stimulated civil rights activism.  A powerful labor \nmovement that pressed against employment discrimination threatened to level \nwages across racial lines and directly challenged Jim Crow.  It also encouraged \nblacks to leave the South, and diminished the southern establishmentโs control over \nthose who stayedโฆDistressed by these developments and keenly aware of the \ndangers that threatened the Southโs racial order, southern members closed ranks in \nCongress to reshape the framework within which unions and the labor market could \noperate.  For their Republican partners, labor remained an issue of party and \nideology.  For southern legislators, labor had become race. \n \n17.  โThe โRight-to-Workโ label has a nice sound to it but is misleading,โ said federal \ndistrict court Judge Philip P. Simon in Sweeney v. Daniels, 2013 WL 209047, *1 (N.D. Ind. \nJanuary 17, 2013).  โWhat these types of laws actually prohibit are โunion security clauses,โ which \nare provisions in collective bargaining agreements between labor unions and employers that \ncondition employment on a worker joining a union.โ  Id.  Or, under well-settled Supreme Court \nlaw, the option to pay their โfair shareโ of the costs of union representation in lieu of union \nmembership.  Id. \n18.  In its modern usage, the phrase โRight-to-Workโ first appeared in 1941 in a Labor \nDay editorial published in the Dallas Morning News.  โCheryl Hall, DMN Writer Coined Term \nโRight to Workโ Opposed Forced Union Membership,โ The Dallas Morning News (July 12, 2010), \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02791 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/08/20 Page 7 of 28 PageID #:7\nhttp://tinurl.com/vance-muse.  Soon after reading the editorial, self-described white supremacist \nVance Muse sought and received permission to use the phrase in an anti-union, anti-integration \npolitical campaign.  Hearings Before a Special Committee to Investigate Lobbying Activities, \nUnited States Senate 75th Congress, Second Session, Part 6, April 14, 15, 16, and 17, 1936 at \n1972-1973 (U.S. Govโt Printing Office, Washington: 1936); Stetson Kennedy, Southern Exposure \npp. 84, 253 (Doubleday &  Co., Inc., Garden City, New York, 1946).  At least one author believes \nMuse  and  the  Christian  American  Association  to  have  been  linked  to  the  Ku  Klux  Klan.  \nMark Ames, โYou Hate โRight to Workโ More than You Know.  Hereโs Why.โ (nsfwcorp, \nDecember 12, 2012). \n19.  Texas lobbyist Muse and his Christian American Association had advanced so-\ncalled Anti-Violence laws throughout World War II designed to limit labor strikes.  Katznelson, \nFear Itself at 396; Mark Dixon, โLimiting Labor: Business Political Mobilization and Union \nSetback in the States,โ 19 The Journal of Policy History, 313, 321 (No. 3 Penn State Univ., 2007).  \nMuse and the CAA turned to promoting Right-to-Work laws soon thereafter.  In a letter to Stetson \nKennedy, Muse bragged, โWe have successfully sponsored anti-violence laws in Texas, Arkansas, \nMississippi, Florida and Alabama; we are directing a campaign in Arkansas for a RIGHT TO \nWORK  amendment  to  the  state  constitution  and  are  cooperating  with  Attorney  General \nTom Watson, who is sponsoring a somewhat similar movement in Florida.โ  Stetson Kennedy, \nSouthern Exposure, 253 (Doubleday & Co., N.W., 1946). \n20.  Between 1944 and 1947, twelve states adopted anti-closed-shop lawsโlaws which \nare now called โRight-to-Work.โ  Archibald Cox, et al., Labor Law at 1122 (Foundation Press 13th ed. \n2002).  In general, those laws outlawed the โclosed shopโโcontract clauses which required \nemployers to hire only union members.   \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02791 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/08/20 Page 8 of 28 PageID #:8\n21.  After World War II ended, the United States experienced an unprecedented wave \nof strikes as union members sought to recover from wage and price controls adopted in the name \nof winning the war.  Katznelson, Fear Itself, at 391 (โat one point nearly 2,000,000 workers were \non strike simultaneously; 3,470,000 workers struck in 1945, and 4,600,000 in 1946, when fully \n116,000,000 man days were lost to the economy.โ).  Public opinion turned sharply against \norganized labor, and in 1946, American voters returned Republicans to control of Congress for the \nfirst time in a generation.  David M. Oshinsky, Senator Joseph McCarthy and the American Labor \nMovement  (Univ.  of  Missouri  Press,  Columbia  Missouri,  1976)  (Gallup  poll  conducted  in \nDecember 1946 which asked โShould Congressโฆpass new laws to control labor unions?โ received \n66 percent support).  In 1946, Republicans gained 55 House seats to take a three-vote majority, \nand 13 seats in the Senate to go up 51 to 45.  Historical Statistics at 691, 139-145.  Reigning in \nlabor was at the top of the legislative agenda, and Republicans promptly introduced legislation \nwhich came to be known as the Taft-Hartley Act.  Formally named the Labor-Management \nRelations Act (LMRA), Taft-Hartley was a top-to-bottom overhaul of the NLRA. \n22.  At least nine states passed Right-to-Work closed shop laws in the spring of 1947 \nwhile the debates over the Taft-Hartley amendments to the NLRA heated up in Congress.1  Taft-\nHartley eliminated the protection of the closed shop from Section 8(3) of the NLRA, and allowed \nstates to regulate union security clauses requiring โmembershipโ in the union as a condition of \nemployment.2  When Congress adopted Taft-Hartley on June 23, 1947, it included a new Section \n \n1 They include: Virginia (January 21, 1947); Arkansas (February 19, 1947); Tennessee (February 21, 1947); \nArizona (March 20, 1947); Georgia (March 27, 1947); and, Iowa (April 28, 1947).  Texas considered and \nrejected a Right-to-Work law in 1945, but then passed it on September 7, 1947.  โTexas Ban on Closed \nShop,โ 20 LRRM 3004 (BNA 1947). \n2 The Wagner Act passed in 1935 specifically authorized closed-shop contract clauses in its proviso to \nSection 8(3): โProvided, that nothing in this Act,โฆshall preclude an employer from making an agreement \nwith a labor organizationโฆto require as a condition of employment membership thereinโฆโ  Outlawing the \nclosed shop was one of the principle objectives of the Taft-Hartley amendments to the Wagner Act.  NLRB \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02791 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/08/20 Page 9 of 28 PageID #:9\n14(b).  It states (29 U.S.C. ยง 164(b)): \n(b) Agreements requiring union membership in violation of State law \n  Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as authorizing the execution \nor application of agreements requiring membership in a labor organization as a \ncondition of employment in any State or Territory in which such execution or \napplication is prohibited by State or Territorial law. \n \n23.  In the years after the passage of Taft-Hartley, several more states passed Right-to-\nWork laws.  Their racist origins and pernicious effect on working people was obvious.  As \nReverend Martin Luther King, Jr., put it in 1961: \nIn our glorious fight for civil rights, we must guard against being fooled by false \nslogans, such as โright to work.โ  It is a law to rob us of our civil rights and job \nrights.  Its purpose is to destroy labor unions and the freedom of collective \nbargaining by which unions have improved wages and working conditions of \neveryoneโฆWherever  these  laws  have  been  passed,  wages  are  lower,  job \nopportunities are fewer and there are no civil rights.  We do not intend to let them \ndo this to us.  We demand this fraud be stopped.  Our weapon is our vote. \n \nThe Fight Against โRight-to-Workโ Laws in the Midwest \n24.  In recent years, the states surrounding Illinois have fought to prevent โRight-to-\nWorkโ from being enacted in their states.  Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Kentucky \nhave all engaged in legal and legislative battles to prevent bans on the ability to negotiate over the \ninclusion of union security clauses in collective bargaining agreements.    \n25.  For example, on February 1, 2012, Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels signed into law \nIndiana House Bill 1001, also known as Indiana Code ยง 22-6-6 and titled, โChapter 6.  Right to \nWork.โ  On February 22, 2012, James M. Sweeney and Local 150 filed suit in the U.S. District \nCourt for the Northern District of Indiana (Case No. 2:12-cv-00081).  In that complaint, the Union \nalleged that the Indiana Right-to-Work law violated various provisions of the Constitutions of the \nUnited States and the State of Indiana. \n \nv. General Motors Corp., 373 U.S. 734 (1963) (โthe most serious abuses of compulsory unionism were \neliminated by abolishing the closed shop.โ). \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02791 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/08/20 Page 10 of 28 PageID #:10\n26.  During the lame duck session on December 11, 2012, the Michigan legislature \nenacted its โRight to Workโ law, signed later that day by the Governor.  Michigan State AFL-CIO, \net al. v. Callaghan, Case No. 13-cv-10557 (filed February 11, 2013).  The core provision of the \nlaw is almost identical to that passed in Indiana, prohibiting as a condition of employment any \nrequirement that individuals โbecame or remain a member of a labor organization,โ or โpay any \ndues, fees, assessments or other chargesโ of any kind to a union.  MCL ยง 423.14(1) (b) and (c).   \n27.  Mother  Jones  magazine  attributed  the  passage  of  the  Right-to-Work  law  in \nMichigan  in  2013  to  Richard  โDickโ  DeVos,  the  right-wing  billionaire  owner  of  Amway.  \nAndy Knoll, โMeet the New Kochs.  The DeVos Clanโs Plan to Defund the Left: They beat Big \nLabor  in  its  own  backyard.  Next  up:  your  state?โ  (Mother  Jones,  January/February  2014).  \nDefeated in his campaign for Governor of Michigan in 2006, DeVos waited until the 2010 elections \nput Republicans in control of the state legislature and Governorโs mansion.  Governor Rick Snyder \nrepeatedly said Right-to-Work was not on his agenda, but money in support of the measure poured \nin from around the country.  By the end of 2012, DeVos and his allies had overcome resistance \nfrom Snyder and other moderate Republicans.  As Mother Jones concluded, โThe Michigan fight \nhas  given  hopeโand  a  road  mapโto  conservatives  across  the  country  working  to  cripple \norganized labor and defund the left.  Whereas party activists had for years viewed Right-to-Work \nas a pipe dream, a determined and very wealthy family, putting in place all the elements of a classic \npolitical campaign, was able to move the needle in a matter of months.โ \n28.  Meanwhile,  on  January  17,  2013,  the  District  Court  in  Indiana  entered  its \nMemorandum and Order dismissing Local 150โs Complaint challenging Indianaโs Right-to-Work \nlaw.  Sweeney v. Daniels, 2013 WL 209047 (N.D. Ill. January 17, 2013).  The Court dismissed all \nof the Unionโs claims under the U.S. Constitution (Counts I-VII, X-XI), id. at *4-11; and dismissed \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02791 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/08/20 Page 11 of 28 PageID #:11\nthe counts alleging violations of the Indiana Constitution without prejudice to those claims being \nrefiled in state court (Counts VIII-IX).  Id. at *12-13. \n29.  On February 11, 2013, Local 150 filed its โComplaint for Declaratory Judgment \nand Injunctive Reliefโ in the Indiana trial court.  In that Complaint, the Union challenged Indianaโs \nRight-to-Work law as a violation of the Indiana Constitution. \n30.  On September 5, 2013, the Indiana trial court declared Sections I.C. ยง 22-6-6-8 and \nI.C. ยง 22-6-6-10 of the Indiana Right-to-Work law unconstitutional.  The court held that the \nprovisions of the Indiana Right-to-Work law in issue violated Article 1, Section 21, of the Indiana \nConstitution, which states that โ[n]o personโs particular services shall be demanded, without just \ncompensation.โ  Ind. Const. art. 1, ยง 21.  As the trial court explained, because unions are required \nunder federal law to provide services to nonmembers regardless of their failure to make any \npayments to the union for those services, โthe effect of I.C. 22-6-6-8 and I.C. 22-6-6-10โฆis to \ndemand particular services without just compensation.โ  \n31.  Meanwhile, in Sweeney v. Pence, 767 F.3d 654 (7th Cir. 2014), the federal appeals \ncourt affirmed the dismissal of Local 150โs U.S. Constitution and preemption claims.  However, \nin dissent, Wood, C.J. said (id. at 671): \nThe plain language of Section 14(b)โฆdoes not support such sweeping force for \nIndianaโs Right-to-Work lawโฆno ruling of the Supreme Court has gone this far, \nand the legislative history is inconclusive.  I would find Sections 8(2) and 8(3) [of \nIndianaโs Right-to-Work law] preempted by federal statute. \n \n32.  On November 6, 2014, the Indiana Supreme Court reversed the Lake County \nCircuit Courtโs decision and upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana Right-to-Work Law.  \nZoeller v. Sweeney, 19 N.E. 3d 749 (Ind. 2014).  The Court ruled that there was no state demand \nfor the Unionโs particular services and hence no violation of the Indiana Constitution.   \n   \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02791 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/08/20 Page 12 of 28 PageID #:12\n33.  Shortly  before  receipt  of  the  Indiana  Supreme  Courtโs  decision,  Local  150 \npetitioned the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to rehear the Sweeney v. Pence case en banc.  On \nJanuary 13, 2015, the full Court denied the Petition by a tie vote, 5 to 5.  The judges voting to \nrehear the case adopted Judge Woodโs panel opinion dissent as their basis to do so. \n34.  For many years, the Missouri legislature had passed โRight-to-Workโ laws, only to \nhave them vetoed by the Governor.  In 2016, Missouri elected Republican Eric Greitens, who in \nshort order received another Right-to-Work bill and signed it in February 2017.  Jeff Stein, \nโMissouri voters defeat GOP-backed โright to workโ law, in victory for unions, Associated Press \nprotects,โ https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/08/08/missouri-voters-defeat-gop-\nbacked-right-work-law-victory-unions-associated-press-\nprojects/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.994f6e1b05b2. \n35.  Organized labor mounted an aggressive petition campaign to get a โvetoโ initiative \non the ballot.  An โinitiativeโ state, Missouri previously rejected a Right-to-Work law in 1978.  At \na time when about 20 percent of the workforce was organized, Missourians rejected Right-to-Work \nby a 67-percent/32-percent vote.  In 2018, the citizens of Missouri again rejected Right-to-Work \n60 to 40. \n36.  Conservative attacks on labor unions which focused on โRight-to-Workโ laws \nreached their apex in Wisconsin in 2015.  Like Republican governors in Indiana and Michigan, \nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker had deflected talk of a Right-to-Work bill as a โdistraction.โ  \nGordon Lafer, The One Percent Solution: How Corporations Are Remaking America One State at \na Time, at 79 (ILR Press, Cornell Univ. Ithaca and Lord, 2017).  In more candid conversations, \nhowever, Walker said, โThe first step is weโre going to deal with collective bargaining for all \npublic employee unions because you divide and conquerโฆThat opens the doorโ to Right-to-Work.  \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02791 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/08/20 Page 13 of 28 PageID #:13\nId.  Once Walker eviscerated public sector collective bargaining by limiting the subjects upon \nwhich unions and employers could agree and crippled public sector unions with onerous annual \nrecertification  requirements,  he  changed  his  mind  and  signed  a  Right-to-Work  law  in \nFebruary 2015.  Id. \n37.  Beginning in January 2015, several Kentucky  counties passed Right-to-Work \nordinances.  United Auto Workers v. Hardin County, Kentucky, 160 F. Supp. 3d 1004, 1006-1007 \n(W.D. Ky. 2016).  Opponents of the law succeeded in court challenges which argued Right-to-\nWork laws passed by units of government below the state level were preempted by the NLRA, id. \nat 1014, but the Court of Appeals reversed.  In January 2017, however, the State of Kentucky \npassed its own statewide Right-to-Work law. \n38.  Right-to-Work laws remain the most pernicious anti-union, anti-labor laws as they \nwere always intended to be.  Even before COVID-19, income inequality in America has increased, \nas wages stagnate and living standards erode.  See, e.g., F. Manzo, IV and R. Bruno, โWhich Labor \nMarket Institutions Reduce Income Inequality?: Labor Unions, Prevailing Wage Laws, and Right-\nto-Work Laws in the Construction Industry,โ at ii (Research Report, January 29, 2014) (โThe \nlargest contributor to rising income inequality has been the long-term decline of labor union \nmembershipโ).  Many economists believe U.S. unemployment could reach levels equal to the \nGreat Depression.  See, e.g., Michael D. Farren, โUnemployment Rate May Exceed the Great \nDepressionโs  Peak,โ  https://www.mercatus.org/bridge/commentary/unemployment-rate-may-\nexceed-great-depression%E2%80%99s-peak.  More than ever, American workers need the voice \nunions give them. \n   \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02791 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/08/20 Page 14 of 28 PageID #:14\nโRight-to-Workโ in Illinois \n39.  Illinois workers have fought their own battles over Right-to-Work in recent years.  \nAfter Governor Bruce Rauner took office in 2015, he immediately began attacking workersโ rights \nand specifically pushed for โRight-to-Workโ on a local government level as part of his so-called \nโTurnaround Agenda.โ  Later that year, the Village of Lincolnshire became the only government \nentity to pass a โRight-to-Workโ ordinance, but it was invalidated by this Court in Int'l Union of \nOperating Engineers, Local 399, AFL-CIO v. Vill. of Lincolnshire, Illinois, 228 F. Supp. 3d 824 \n(N.D.  Ill.  2017),  affโd  sub  nom.  Int'l  Union  of  Operating  Engineers  Local  399  v.

Ct. 2692 (2019). \n40.  In response to Governor Raunerโs efforts, the Illinois General Assembly passed a \nbill in 2017 which prohibited local governments from establishing so-called โRight-to-Work \nzones.โ  Governor Rauner vetoed the bill, and the Illinois House fell one vote short of overriding \nhim. \n41.  Despite Governor Raunerโs actions and beliefs, there was data in 2018 to suggest \nthat  Americansโ  approval  of  labor  unions  was  at  its  highest  level  since  2003.  \nhttps://illinoisepi.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/ilepi-pmcr-uci-state-of-the-unions-illinois-\n2019.pdf (citing Saad, Lydia (2018).  Labor Unions Approval Steady at 15-Year High. Gallup). \n42.  Three months after the people of Missouri overwhelmingly rejected โRight to \nWork,โ at the November 6, 2018, General Election, Lance Yednock was elected to the Illinois \nHouse of Representatives, and Governor J.B. Pritzker defeated incumbent Governor Rauner. \n43.  In an effort to undo some of the damage done to labor relations by the previous \nIllinoisโ governorโs administration, on February 13, 2019, Senator Villivalam filed Senate Bill \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02791 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/08/20 Page 15 of 28 PageID #:15\n1474, the Collective Bargaining Freedom Act, with the Secretary of the Illinois Senate, which, \ninter alia, provides that the authority to enact laws or rules that restrict the use of union security \nagreements between an employer and a labor organization vests exclusively with the General \nAssembly. \n44.  On March 7, 2019, the Illinois Senate voted 42 to 12 in favor of the bill.  Upon \npassing the Senate and arriving in the House, Representative Yednock was added as a Chief \nSponsor of the bill. \n45.  On April 3, 2019, the Illinois House voted 101 to 8 in favor of the bill, as amended \nin the House.  Soon after, on April 10, 2019, the Illinois Senate concurred with the House-amended \nbill by a vote of 51 to 0.  Governor Pritzker signed the Collective Bargaining Freedom Act into \nlaw on April 12, 2019. \n46.  The fight against Right-to-Work has been expensive, taxing the resources of unions \nand their supporters in opposition to some of the wealthiest individuals and corporations in the \nCountry.  After the Collective Bargaining Freedom Act was passed, many citizens in the State of \nIllinois, including Plaintiffs, sought to amend the Bill of Rights Article of the Illinois Constitution \nto prohibit any law from being passed that restricts or interferes with the ability of workers to join \ntogether and collectively bargain over wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment, \nincluding union security agreements.  However, the only way to put such an amendment before \nthe Illinois voters is through a constitutional convention or with a 3/5 vote of the General \nAssembly. \nRevisions to the Constitution of the State of Illinois \n47.

XIV): \n(1) by a constitutional convention approved by three-fifths of the members elected \nto each house of the Illinois General Assembly and voters at the general election; \n \n(2) by a proposed amendment approved by a three-fifths vote of the Illinois General \nAssembly, which becomes effective if approved at the general election by either \nthree-fifths of those voting on the question or a majority of those voting in the \nelection; or \n \n(3) by submitting to the Illinois Secretary of State a petition for an amendment to \nArticle IV of the constitution, signed by Illinois registered voters in an amount \nequal to at least eight percent of the total votes cast for Illinois Governor in the \npreceding gubernatorial election, and shall become effective if approved by either \nthree-fifths of those voting on the amendment or a majority of those voting in the \nelection. \n \n49.  In pertinent part, Article XIV, Section 2 (Amendments by General Assembly), \nstates that โ[a]mendments approved by the vote of three-fifths of the members elected to each \nhouse shall be submitted to the electors at the general election next occurring at least six months \nafter such legislative approval (emphasis added)โฆโ  Ill. Const. art. XIV, ยง 2(a). \n50.  The six-month โwaiting periodโ required by Article XIV, Section 2, was imposed \nat  the  Sixth  Illinois  Constitutional  Convention.    See  Record  of  Proceedings,  Sixth  Illinois \nConstitutional Convention. \n51.  Prior to its adoption, the Convention debated and discussed the purpose of the six-\nmonth waiting period for amendments to the Illinois Constitution.  See Record of Proceedings, \nSixth Illinois Constitutional Convention. \n52.  During the Convention, โCommittee Proposal 1,โ which contained the proposed \nsix-month requirement, was submitted to the delegates.  In the subsequent debate and records, the \nspokesperson for the responsible committee, Mr. Tomei, explained to the delegation that the \npurpose of six-month requirement was to allow the public time in which to โreview amendments \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02791 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/08/20 Page 17 of 28 PageID #:17\nsubmitted by the General Assembly,โ 2 Record of Proceeding, Sixth Illinois Constitutional \nConvention, 442, and to โgive the legislature itself the opportunity to reconsider and withdrawโ \nthe proposed amendment.  7 Record of Proceedings, Sixth Illinois Constitutional Convention, \n2293.  Mr. Tomei explained that the committee โfelt that the public ought to have an opportunity \nto  hear  the  argumentsโ  of  the  various  invested  parties,  either  for  or  against  the  proposed \namendment.  2 Record of Proceeding, Sixth Illinois Constitutional Convention, 444. \n53.  In further explaining the Committeeโs proposal regarding the six-month period, \nMr. Tomei cited to the โthree-month periodโ then-present in the Illinois Constitution of 1870 for \nsupport, noting, at that time, a proposed amendment to the constitution was required to be \npublished in full at least three months preceding the election upon which it would be voted.  \n2 Record of Proceeding, Sixth Illinois Constitutional Convention, 444; Illinois Constitution of \n1870, Article XIV, Section 2. \n54.  However,  while  the  Constitution  adopted  by  the  Sixth  Illinois  Constitutional \nConvention  included  the  six-month  requirement  found  in  Article  XIV,  it  requires  that  the \namendment proposal, along with explanations, be published to the voters only one month prior to \nthe election upon which it will be voted.  Ill. Const. art. XIV, ยง 2(b). \nCOVID-19 and the Collective Bargaining Freedom Amendment \n55.  Following the bipartisan success of the Collective Bargaining Freedom Act and the \nsession, generally, Representative Yednock and Senator Villivalam seized on the momentum and \ncontinued to craft ballot language for an amendment to the Illinois Constitution, to be voted on at \nthe November 3, 2020, General Election. \n56.  In  December  2019,  an  outbreak  of  respiratory  disease  caused  by  a  novel \ncoronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China.  The coronavirus disease, now known as โCOVID-19,โ is \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02791 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/08/20 Page 18 of 28 PageID #:18\nan infectious disease that can spread from person to person and can result in serious illness and \ndeath. \n57.  In the January 22, 2020, edition of Crainโs Chicago Business, political columnist \nGreg Hinz was the first to report on the Collective Bargaining Freedom Amendment. \n58.  In  his  column,  Mr.  Hinz  stated  that  โ[t]he  exact  language  of  the  proposed \namendment is not yet available.  But [IUOE Local 150] has begun discussing it with legislative \nleaders and Gov. J.B. Pritzker, and it says an actual amendment will be filed later this week by \nSen. Ram Villivalam, D-Chicago, and Rep. Lance Yednock, D-Ottawa.โ  Mr. Hinz also confirmed \nthat  Senator  Villavlam  intended  to  sponsor  the  proposed  amendment  in  the \nSenate.  https://www.chicagobusiness.com/greg-hinz-politics/powerful-union-pushes-right-work-\nban-illinois. \n59.  On January 23, 2020, Representative Lance Yednock filed with the Clerk of the \nIllinois House of Representatives legislation to initiate the procedure for the Collective Bargaining \nFreedom Amendment to be considered before the General Assembly.  The Bill, formally titled, \nHouse Joint Resolution Constitutional Amendment 37, provides that โno law shall be passed that \nrestricts or interferes with the ability of workers to join together and collectively bargain over \nwages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment, including any law that prohibits or restricts \nthe right of private sector employers and employees, through a representative of their own \nchoosing, to enter into and administer union security agreements.โ  101st General Assembly, State \nof Illinois, House Joint Resolution Constitutional Amendment 37 (HJRCA 37). \n60.  In the January 24, 2020, edition of Crainโs Chicago Business, the Crainโs Editorial \nBoard focused on the proposed Collective Bargaining Freedom Amendment.  The column, \nalthough hostile to the proposal, initiated the public debate regarding the merits of the proposed \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02791 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/08/20 Page 19 of 28 PageID #:19\nCollective Bargaining Freedom Amendment.  The Editorial Board noted that โthe reason for \nconcern now is that the [IUOE Local 150] has already begun discussions about it with legislative \nleaders and Gov. J.B. Pritzker.  Legislation could come at any moment, and there appears to be \nplenty of momentum in Springfield to make sure itโs heard.โ  https://www.chicagobusiness.com/\nopinion/wrongheaded-idea-about-right-work-illinois. \n61.
