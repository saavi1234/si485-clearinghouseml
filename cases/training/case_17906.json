    "summary": "<p>On July 31, 2020, a candidate for United States President from the Libertarian Party of Maine, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine, seeking to challenge Maine's petition signature requirements for independent candidates found at 21-A M.R.S. &sect;&sect; 353 and 354(5)(A), which had become more challenging to meet due to COVID-19 restrictions. Suing under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, the plaintiff sued the Secretary of State of Maine, alleging violations of her First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed the petition signature requirements violated her right to freedom of speech and association, equal protection, and due process, particularly because the COVID-19 restrictions on in-person gatherings had made it impracticable to obtain the signatures required, thus the requirements were overly broad and not narrowly tailored. The plaintiff sought injunctive relief, including a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and ultimately a permanent injunction to enjoin the defendant and require the petition signature requirement to be lowered from 4,000 to 2,000; the plaintiff also sought declaratory relief that 21-A M.R.S. &sect;&sect; 353 and 354(5)(A) violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment as applied to independent candidates as to the November 2020 election, and the plaintiff sought attorney's fees. The case was assigned to Judge Nancy Torresen.</p>\r\n<p>That same day, the plaintiff filed an emergency motion for injunctive relief, formally requesting the relief discussed in the complaint related to a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to reduce the statutorily-imposed signature requirements for the election from 4,000 to 2,000.</p>\r\n<p>After a hearing on August 3, 2020, the court requested the defendant to determine if the plaintiff had qualified for the general election based on the nominating petition she submitted. The defendant filed a notice to the court on August 10 that the plaintiff had submitted a petition with a sufficient number of valid signatures to qualify her for the ballot. That same day, the plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal and the case is closed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "An independent candidate for president, from the Libertarian Party of Maine, filed this action in the District of Maine seeking to lower the statutorily-imposed requirement for third-party or independent candidates in Maine to appear on the presidential ballot from 4,000 to 2,000. The plaintiff claimed that the restrictions on in-person gatherings and other difficulties created by the pandemic made it challenging to get as many valid signatures as were required, despite her best efforts to collect signatures. The plaintiff requested temporary relief for the signature requirements to be lowered, and ultimately permanent injunctive and declaratory relief that the law as applied to independent candidates for the 2020 election was unconstitutional as applied, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. After the statutory deadline, the defendants notified the court that the plaintiff had acquired enough signatures to meet the statutory requirement; the plaintiff filed a voluntary dismissal and the case is now closed.",

On July 31, 2020, the plaintiff, Jo Jorgensen, who is the national Libertarian Party \ncandidate for U.S. President, filed this action against the defendant, Secretary of State Matthew \nDunlap (Secretary), in his official capacity, along with a motion for preliminary injunction to \nenjoin the Secretary from enforcing the statutory requirement for non-party candidates to obtain a \nminimum of 4,000 valid signatures of Maine registered voters on a nomination petition for a slate \nof presidential electors in order to qualify for the general election ballot in November 2020.  \nPlaintiffโs Complaint (ECF 1); see 21-A M.R.S. ยง 354(5)(A).    \n2.  The Court held a telephone conference with the parties on the morning of Monday, \nAugust 3, 2020, to set a schedule for the preliminary injunction motion.  Plaintiffโs counsel \nreported that the candidate planned to submit nominating petitions to the Secretary later that day, \nand counsel for the Secretary indicated that it would be a few days before the Secretaryโs office \ncould complete its review to determine the validity of those petitions.  The Court asked to be \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 13   Filed 08/10/20   Page 2 of 2    PageID #: 81\ninformed if the Secretary determined that the candidate had qualified for the November general \nelection ballot.  \n3.   Before the close of business on August 3, 2020, which was the statutory deadline \npursuant to 21-A M.R.S. ยงยง 6 & 354(8-A), the plaintiff submitted her nominating petitions to the \nSecretary.   \n4.  Earlier today, the Secretary confirmed that the plaintiffโs nominating petitions do \ncontain a sufficient number of valid signatures to qualify her for the ballot.  See Letter from Deputy \nSecretary of State Julie L. Flynn, attached hereto as Attachment A. \n5.  The undersigned counsel for the Secretary immediately notified plaintiffโs counsel, \nwho has since confirmed to the undersigned counsel that plaintiff intends to dismiss this action.  \n6.  Based on the foregoing, the defendant does not intend to file an opposition to the \nmotion for preliminary injunction.   \nDated:  August 10, 2020        Respectfully submitted, \n              AARON FREY \n              ATTORNEY GENERAL \n \n \n/s/ Phyllis Gardiner________ \n              Phyllis Gardiner \n              Assistant Attorney General \nThomas A.

This 50% reduction from the statutory \namount  is  both  in  line  with  relief  provided  by  neighboring  states  and  represents  a  fair \nacknowledgment of the fact that out of 215 available petitioning days, 138 occurred while Maine \nwas under a state of emergency due to an infectious disease, and 51 occurred while Maine \nresidents were under a โstay at homeโ order. Plaintiffโs request is further justified by the fact that \nthe COVID-19 pandemic continues to engulf Maine, which has a total of 3,866 confirmed cases, \nwith 30 new cases reported just yesterday. Lastly, Plaintiffโs requested relief should be granted \nbecause 2,000 petition signatures is enough to guarantee that Defendant can uphold its duty to \nprotect the integrity of Maineโs elections and ensure that candidates have a sufficient modicum \nof support as evidenced by the fact that larger states require less signatures and Maine requires \nless signatures for other political offices.   \nFACTS \n \nA.  Maineโs Ballot Access Requirements for Independent Candidates \n \nEven during a typical election cycle, Maineโs statutory scheme presents independent \ncandidates for office with significant challenges that are not required of major party candidates. \nMaine classifies general election candidates into two groups: Primary (Party) Candidates and \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 5   Filed 07/31/20   Page 4 of 20    PageID #: 56\nNon-Party Candidates.1 A political party meeting the qualifications of 21-A M.R.S. c.5 is eligible \nto participate in the primary election with the winning candidate from the party automatically \nplaced on the general election ballot.2 All other candidates, including independent candidates for \nthe U.S. presidency, must collect a certain number of valid signatures from registered Maine \nvoters on nomination petitions titled โNomination by Petition (Non-Party)โ, in order to secure \naccess to the 2020 Maine general election ballot.3 Independent candidates seeking to qualify for \nMaineโs 2020 general election ballot must also file a Consent of Petition (Non-Party) Candidate.4 \nNomination petitions for independent candidates for the U.S. presidency may only be circulated \nstarting on January 1st of the year of the election.5  Nomination petitions may only be signed by \nregistered Maine voters.6 Each voter signing a nomination petition โmust personally sign their \nname in such a manner as to satisfy the register of his municipality that he is a registered voter.โ  \nAdditionally, either the voter or the circulator of the petition must print the voterโs name.7  \nIn Maine, access to the general election ballot through Nomination by Petition (Non-\nParty) requires independent candidates for the U.S. presidency to collect a minimum of 4,000 \nand a maximum of 6,000 valid signatures to secure ballot access.8 Collecting signatures by hand, \non paper nomination petitions, is inherently burdensome, labor-intensive and inefficient as a \nmeans of demonstrating voter support.  Many signatures are often invalidated due to illegibility, \nmissing information and other mere technical defects.  This obligates candidates and political \nparties to collect at least 25% to 50% more signatures than required, in order to account for those \nsignatures that might be later invalidated.

Maineโs Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic  \n \n  The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to an extraordinary set of circumstances in \nMaine and nationwide. In an effort to contain the virus and protect the public health, the State of \nMaine has implemented several emergency measures that, although perhaps reasonable in light \nof the public health crisis, make it incredibly difficult for Plaintiff and other citizens to lawfully \nor  safely  comply  with  the  statutory  procedures  they  must  follow  to  participate  in  Maineโs \nelectoral processes. In particular, as a presidential candidate in Maine, Plaintiff is required by \n                                                            \n9 See, 21-A M.R.S. ยง 354(7)(A). Incidentally, Governor Mills waived this requirement for everyone other than \ncandidate petition circulators.  \n10 See, 21-A M.R.S. ยง 354(7)(B)&(C). \n11 See, 21-A M.R.S. ยง 354(8)(A). \n12 See, 21-A M.R.S. ยง 354(9). \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 5   Filed 07/31/20   Page 6 of 20    PageID #: 58\nlaw to obtain 4000 registered votersโ signatures on petitions to qualify for placement on Maineโs \nNovember 3, 2020 general election ballot. Under the emergency measures and safety guidelines \nnow in place, however, it is incredibly difficult for Plaintiff to lawfully or safely comply with \nthese requirements. \n  In response to the virusโ increasing presence in Maine, on March 15, 2020, Governor \nMills declared a State of Emergency. See Plaintiffโs Exhibit 1. In her โProclamation of State of \nCivil Emergency to Further Protect Public Health,โ Governor Mills declared that COVID-19 is a \npublic health threat because it is a โhighly infectious agent that poses an imminent threat of \nsubstantial harm to our citizens.โ Id. Three days later on March 18, 2020, Governor Mills issued \nExecutive Order 14 FY 19/20 prohibiting gatherings of more than 10 people throughout the state \nand closing all barsโ and restaurantsโ dine in areas. See Plaintiffโs Exhibit 2. The order made no \nexception for First Amendment activity. Id. Then, on March 24, 2020, Governor Mills issued \nExecutive Order 19 FY 19/20, which further restricted commercial activity, restricted public \ngatherings, and extended public social distancing requirements through more detailed regulation \nof โessentialโ and โnon-essentialโ businesses. See Plaintiffโs Exhibit 3. Petitioning was not listed \nas an essential activity under the Order. Id. Finally, on March 31, 2020, Governor Mills issued \nExecutive Order 28 FY 19/20 containing a โStay at Homeโ Order, which ordered all persons \nliving in the State of Maine to stay at their homes except when leaving to conduct certain \nessential activities. See Plaintiffโs Exhibit 4. Petitioning was not listed as an essential activity \nunder the Order, and the Order remained in place until May 31, 2020. Id. Governor Millsโ โState \nof Civil Emergencyโ remains in place until August 6, 2020. See Plaintiffโs Exhibit 5. \n  In addition to the measures listed above, Defendant has undertaken certain actions in \nregards to Maineโs elections that while done in a good faith effort to protect the citizens of \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 5   Filed 07/31/20   Page 7 of 20    PageID #: 59\nMaine, have had the unintended effect of further burdening Plaintiffโs First and Fourteenth \nAmendment rights. First, Defendant encouraged voters to vote absentee in the July 14, 2020, \nprimary elections and extended the deadline by which they could request absentee ballots. See \nPlaintiffโs Exhibit 6. While done to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, this action caused Plaintiff \nto miss out on the lionโs share of her petition signatures, which are typically gathered at tables \nwithin the polling the places on election days. Further, Defendant required petition circulators to \nremain outside while soliciting signatures at the polling places on primary election day. See \nPlaintiffโs Exhibit 7. This not only had the unintended effect of greatly reducing the number of \nvoters petition circulators could interact with, but also led to the destruction of several petitions \nalready containing signatures due to the heavy rain that fell over most of Maine that day. See \nDeclaration of Christopher Thrasher ยถ ยถ 8, 9; Declaration of James Tracey ยถ 3. \nC.  Plaintiffโs Signature Gathering Efforts Hampered by the COVID-19 Pandemic and \nMaineโs Response Thereto \n \nThird parties and independent candidates for president in a normal election year have \naccess  to  significantly less  resources,  personnel,  and  equipment.  Decl.  Thrasher ยถ  3.  Their \ncampaigns rely on boots-on-the-ground volunteer work and community outreach. The COVID-\n19 outbreak has made the already arduous path to ballot access for third party and independent \ncandidates for president much more difficult. Decl. Thrasher ยถ 4. First, petition signatures are \ntypically collected during the spring and summer at public events and festivals. Decl. Thrasher ยถ \n5. However, this year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing social distancing mandates \nfrom Governor Mills, the vast majority of public events scheduled for the spring and summer in \nMaine were cancelled.13 Second, general public reluctance to engage in the sort of physical \n                                                            \n13 Burnham, Emily; Bangor Daily News (April 29, 2020); Hereโs a list of the Maine parades, festivals and concerts \nthat have been scrapped for 2020; (https://bangordailynews.com/2020/04/29/news/bangor/bangors-memorial-day-\nparade-has-been-canceled/).  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 5   Filed 07/31/20   Page 8 of 20    PageID #: 60\ncontact required to sign a petition has resulted in many of Plaintiffโs petition circulators being \nimmediately rejected upon attempting to solicit signatures. Decl. Thrasher ยถ 6. Third, primary \nelection  day  petitioning  at  the  polling  places  typically  represents  an  outsized  portion  of \nPlaintiffโs signature gathering efforts, but this year those efforts were hampered by Governor \nMills and the COVID-19 pandemic. Decl. Thrasher ยถยถ 7, 8; See also Plaintiffโs Exhibit 7. The \nincreased number of absentee voters resulted in far fewer individual voters traveling to the polls \nand thus far less voters signing petitions. Decl. Thrasher ยถ 8. Further, Governor Mills mandated \nthat all petition circulators must stand outside the polling place instead of at their usual tables \nindoors.  Plaintiffโs  Exhibit  7.  This  not  only  greatly  hindered  petition  circulators  ability  to \nintercept and solicit signatures from voters, but given the heavy rain that fell across most of \nMaine that day, it led to the actual destruction of several petition sheets. Decl. Thrasher ยถยถ 7, 8, \n9.  Fourth, as  a  result of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  the  Governorโs  executive  orders  in \nresponse, Plaintiffโs campaign was unable to hire enough professional petition circulators and \nnotaries. Decl. Thrasher ยถ 11. On more than one occasion, notaries and circulators refused to \nwork citing that the Governor had not opened up the state to the public. Id. Additionally, on more \nthan one occasion a petition circulator was denied a hotel room due to the ongoing restrictions. \nDecl. Thrasher ยถ 10. Fifth, Maineโs requirement that signature petitions be turned into each \nindividual town hall for certification prior to being turned in to the Secretary of State, has \nresulted in unnecessary difficulties and hampered Plaintiffโs ability to turn in signatures during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Decl. Thrasher ยถ 12. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many town \nhalls are operating on reduced hours and interact with the public by appointment only, with many \nclosed entirely. Id. Plaintiffโs campaign has collected signatures from more than 285 towns, but \nas a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing social distancing restrictions, reduced hours, \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 5   Filed 07/31/20   Page 9 of 20    PageID #: 61\nreduced staffing levels, reduced capacity, and unpublicized closures at local town halls, the \ncampaign has experienced significant delays and complications in receiving the certified petition \nsheets, which further reduces the amount of signatures that will be submitted to the Secretary of \nState. Id. Plaintiffโs campaign began its efforts to collect petition signatures as soon as it was \nable, January 1, 2020; however, as a result of the above, Plaintiffโs campaign was only able to \ncollect 4,400 unverified petition signatures. Thus, Plaintiff believes, that absent relief from this \nCourt, once signatures are verified, she will not have enough signatures to qualify her to appear \non Maineโs 2020 general election ballot.   \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiff is Entitled to Preliminary Relief. \nWhen making a request for a preliminary injunction, the Plaintiff must show that (1) she  \nwill suffer irreparable harm; (2) the remedies available to her at law are inadequate; (3) the harm \nto her outweighs the harm Defendant would suffer if an injunction were imposed; and (4) an \ninjunction will not adversely affect the public interest. Block v. Mollis, 618 F. Supp. 2d 142, 155 \n(D.R.I.  2009).  Of  the  four  factors,  the  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  is  of  primary \nimportance. See Esso Standard Oil Co. (Puerto Rico) v. Monroig-Zayas, 445 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. \n2006) (โThe sine qua non of this four-part inquiry is likelihood of success on the meritsโ). \nA.  Plaintiff Will Suffer Irreparable Harm if the Court Does Not Grant Her \nInjunctive Relief \n \nPlaintiff urgently needs relief from this Court because she is required to obtain a \nstatutorily prescribed number of votersโ signatures on petitions by August 3, 2020, and if she \nfails to do so she will be excluded from Maineโs November 3, 2020 general election ballot. At \nthe same time,  the ongoing  COVID-19 pandemic and the Stateโs orders made in response \nthereto, as described above, make it impossible for Plaintiff to gather enough signatures. Thus, \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 5   Filed 07/31/20   Page 10 of 20    PageID #: 62\nPlaintiff will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief. It is well-settled that the \nโloss  of  First  Amendment  freedoms,  for  even  minimal  periods  of  time,  unquestionably \nconstitutes irreparable injury.โ Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976). Plaintiff is suffering \nsuch harm now. โPetition circulation โฆ is โcore political speech,โ because it involves โinteractive \ncommunication  concerning  political  change.โโ  Buckley  v.  American  Constitutional  Law \nFoundation, Inc., 525 U.S. 182, 186 (1999) (quoting Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414, 422 (1988)). \nFirst  Amendment  protection  is  therefore  โat  its  zenithโ  with  respect  to  Plaintiffโs  right  to \ncirculate petitions in support of her candidacy. Id.  \nB.  Plaintiff Has a Strong Likelihood of Success on the Merits. \nThe extraordinary circumstances from which this case arise make it an easy one to \ndecide. Under Maine law, as it now exists during the  COVID-19 pandemic, it is  virtually \nimpossible for Plaintiff to collect enough signatures to qualify for the ballot, let alone to do so \nwithout risking her health or running afoul of social distancing requirements mandated by the \nState. In all six virtually identical cases that have reached a decision at the federal or state \nappellate  court  level,  the  courts  have  found  that  enforcing  statutorily  required  signature \nrequirements in order to secure a place on the ballot during the COVID-19 pandemic would \nplace a severe and unconstitutional burden on the First Amendment rights of the parties and \ncandidates seeking ballot access.. Esshaki v. Whitmer, 2020 WL 2185553, ____ Fed. Appx.____ \n(6thCir. May 5, 2020); Libertarian Party of Pennsylvania v. Pritzker, 2020 WL 1951687 (N.D. \nIll., April 23, 2020);Garbett v.

Virginia State Board of Elections, et al., No. 3:20-CV-00349-JAG (E.D.VA. July 15, \n2020)(reducing signature requirements for president by 50%). Plaintiff is also entitled to the \nrelief requested because Maineโs petitioning requirements, as applied here, cannot withstand \nconstitutional scrutiny under the analytic framework the Supreme Court set forth in Anderson v. \nCelebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983), and Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428 (1992). \n1.  Plaintiff is Entitled to Relief Because Maine Has Failed to Provide \nHer  With  An  Adequate  Procedure  for  Qualifying  for  the \nNovember 3, 2020 General Election Ballot \n \nWhen states fail to provide candidates and parties with a procedure by which they may \nqualify for the ballot, the Supreme Court and lower federal courts have not hesitated to remedy \nthe defect by placing candidates and parties on the ballot by court order. In 1976, for instance, \nseveral states provided no procedure for independent candidates to qualify for the ballot. In each \nof these states, independent presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy sought relief in federal \ncourt, and without exception the courts ordered that he be placed on the ballot. See McCarthy v. \nBriscoe, 429 U.S. 1317, 97 S. Ct. 10 (1976) (Powell, J. in Chambers) (placing McCarthy on \nTexas ballot); McCarthy v. Askew, 540 F.2d 1254, 1255 (5th Cir. 1976) (per curiam) (affirming \norder placing McCarthy on Floridaโs ballot); McCarthy v. Noel, 420 F. Supp. 799 (D. R.I. 1976) \n(placing McCarthy on Rhode Island ballot); McCarthy v. Tribbitt, 421 F. Supp. 1193 (D. Del. \n1976) (placing McCarthy on Delaware ballot); McCarthy v. Austin, 423 F. Supp. 990 (W.D. \nMich. 1976) (placing McCarthy on Michigan ballot). As Justice Powell observed in McCarthy v. \nBriscoe, the Supreme Court had followed the same procedure in 1968, when it ordered that \nseveral candidates who successfully challenged the constitutionality of Ohioโs ballot access laws \nbe placed on its ballot. See McCarthy v. Briscoe, supra, citing Williams v. Rhodes, 89 S. Ct. 1, 21 \nL.Ed.2d 69 (Stewart, J., in Chambers, 1968). \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 5   Filed 07/31/20   Page 12 of 20    PageID #: 64\n  In 1980, Michigan had failed to enact a procedure for independent candidates to access \nthe ballot following the decision in McCarthy v. Austin, supra, and two independent candidates \nrunning for president and vice-president filed suit. See Hall v. Austin, 495 F. Supp. 782 (E.D. \nMich. 1980). Once again, a federal court ordered that the independent candidates be placed on \nMichiganโs ballot. See id. at 791-92. The issue arose again in 1984, because Michigan still had \nnot enacted a procedure for independent candidates to qualify for the ballot. An independent \ncandidate for the State Board of Education filed suit, the district court again declared Michiganโs \nballot  access scheme unconstitutional, and the Secretary of State was  ordered to  place the \ncandidate on the ballot. See Goldman-Frankie v. Austin, 727 F.2d 603, 607-08 (6th Cir. 1984). \n  In Williams, the Supreme Court explained the rationale for federal courts to grant such \nrelief: the Constitution does not permit states to restrict access to the ballot in a manner that \nโfavors two particular parties โ the Republicans and the Democrats โ and in effect tends to give \nthem a complete monopoly.โ Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23, 32 (1968)). Here, the State of \nMaine โ albeit with the unwanted intrusion of a global pandemic โ has accomplished that same \nresult. Maine held its primary elections on July 14, 2020, and the Republican and Democratic \nnominees selected by means of that taxpayer-funded procedure are automatically qualified to \nappear on Maineโs 2020 general election ballot. Yet it is partially unlawful โ a violation of \nMaineโs social distancing requirements โ patently unsafe, and incredibly difficult for Plaintiff \nand all other independent candidates and parties to engage in petitioning, which is the only \nprocedure that  Maine provides  for them to  qualify for the general  election ballot. Further, \nMaineโs requirement that Plaintiff have her signatures verified at every individual municipality is \nnot only unnecessary (state and local officials have access to the same databases) but poses an \nextreme burden when coupled with the fact that town halls across Maine are operating under \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 5   Filed 07/31/20   Page 13 of 20    PageID #: 65\nreduced  hours  if  not  closed  altogether.  Decl.  Thrasher  ยถ  12.  The  grounds  for  this  Courtโs \nintervention could not be clearer. \n  Maine  did  not  cause  the  outbreak  of  the  COVID-19  virus,  of  course,  but  that  is \nimmaterial.  Maine  is  constitutionally  required  to  provide  its  citizens  with  a  lawful,  safe \nprocedure to qualify for its general election ballot, and it has failed to do so. Certainly, Maine \ncould have adopted measures to remedy this constitutional defect. Governor Mills has issued \nseveral executive orders that impose sweeping changes to Maine law โ and which incidentally \nmake it impossible for Plaintiff to qualify for Maineโs November 3, 2020 general election ballot \nโ but Defendant has declined to provide any relief to independent candidates for office. Under \nthese circumstances, Plaintiff is entitled to injunctive relief from this Court. \n2.  Maineโs  Statutory  Scheme  Cannot  Withstand  Constitutional \nScrutiny as Currently Applied \n \nPlaintiff is also entitled to relief because Maineโs statutory scheme, as currently \napplied, cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny under the Supreme Courtโs Anderson-Burdick \nanalytic framework. Under that analysis, a reviewing court must: \n  first consider the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by \nthe First and Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate. It then must \nidentify and evaluate the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the \nburden imposed by its rule. In passing judgment, the Court must not only determine the \nlegitimacy and strength of each of those interests, it also must consider the extent to \nwhich  those  interests  make  it  necessary  to  burden  the  plaintiffโs  rights.  Only  after \nweighing all these factors is the reviewing court in a position to decide whether the \nchallenged provision is unconstitutional. \n \nAnderson, 460 U.S. at 789. This framework establishes a โflexible standard,โ according to which \nโthe rigorousness of our inquiry into the propriety of a state election law depends upon the extent \nto which a challenged restriction burdens First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.โ Burdick, 504 \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 5   Filed 07/31/20   Page 14 of 20    PageID #: 66\nU.S. at 434; Marcellus v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 849 F.3d 169, 175 (4th Cir. 2017). Under \nthis standard, โreasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictionsโ are subject to less exacting review, \nwhereas laws that imposes โsevereโ burdens are subject to strict scrutiny. Burdick, 504 U.S. at \n434 (citations omitted). But in every case, โHowever slight [the] burden may appear ... it must be \njustified by relevant and legitimate state interests sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation.โ \nCrawford v. Marion County Election Bd., 128 S.Ct. 1610, 1616 (2008) (citation and quotation \nmarks omitted); McLaughlin v. N.C. Bd. of Elections, 65 F.3d 1215, 1221 n.6 (4th Cir. 1995) \n(โWe  believe  that  a  regulation  which  imposes  only  moderate  burdens  could  well  fail  the \nAnderson balancing test when the interests that it serves are minor, notwithstanding that the \nregulation is rational.โ). \nAs the Seventh Circuit has explained, โ[m]uch of the action takes place at the first stage \nof Andersonโs balancing inquiry,โ because the severity of the burden imposed is what determines \nwhether strict scrutiny or a less demanding level of review applies. Stone v. Board of Election \nCom'rs for City of Chicago, 750 F.3d 678, 681 (7th Cir. 2014) (citing Burdick, 504 U.S. at 534). \nAny burden treating independents as a suspect class for targeting is a severe burden. Anderson, \n460 U.S. at 792. \n Here, the burden imposed could not be more severe: Maine law as currently applied \nprohibits Plaintiff and all other independent candidates from seeking to qualify for the general \nelection ballot without violating social distancing requirements and placing their lives in danger. \nSuch โcomplete exclusion,โ the Seventh Circuit has concluded, constitutes a โsevereโ burden on \nthe First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the affected voters, candidates and parties. Lee v. \nKeith, 463 F.3d 768, 770 (7th Cir. 2006). \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 5   Filed 07/31/20   Page 15 of 20    PageID #: 67\n  โRestrictions  that  โseverelyโ  burden  the  exercise  of  constitutional  rights  must  be \nโnarrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance.โโ Lee, 463 F.3d at 768 \n(quoting Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434). But no state interest, compelling or otherwise, is sufficient to \njustify Maineโs unequal treatment of independent candidates for office. In Lee, for example, the \nSeventh Circuit acknowledged that promoting political stability and preventing ballot clutter โare \nimportant state interests,โ but it found them insufficient to justify the challenged restrictions. Id. \nat 770-71. Such interests, the Court concluded, do not โโpermit a State to completely insulate the \ntwo-party system from minor partiesโ or independent candidatesโ competition and influence,โ and \nthat is effectively what Illinois has done.โ Id. at 771 (quoting Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New \nParty, 520 U.S. 351, 366-67 (1997)). \nTo be sure, Maine has a strong and even compelling interest in protecting the public \nhealth  during  a  pandemic.  But  no  court  has  ever  upheld  a  ballot  access  restriction  that \ncategorically  excludes  all  candidates  except  Republicans  and  Democrats.  Because  petition \ncirculation has been made prohibitively difficult under Maine law, and Maine has failed to \nreduce the number of petition signatures independent candidates are required to gather, Maineโs \npetitioning requirements are unconstitutional as applied to Plaintiff in the 2020 general election \ncycle. \nC.  The Balance of Harms Weighs Strongly in Plaintiffsโ Favor. \nThe harm that Plaintiff will suffer in the absence of the requested relief is plain: her name \nwill not appear on Maineโs November 3, 2020 general election ballot; voters will be deprived of \nthe  opportunity  to  hear  her  political  views  and  to  associate  with  and  support  them;  The \nLibertarian Party of Maine (โLPMEโ) will be prevented from disseminating and building support \nfor its platforms among the general electorate. The Supreme Court has expressly relied on such \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 5   Filed 07/31/20   Page 16 of 20    PageID #: 68\nharms to justify granting the relief that Plaintiff request here. See, e.g., Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. \n279, 288-89 (1992); Anderson, 460 U.S. at 793-94; Williams, 393 U.S. at 30-31. The Courtโs \nadmonition in Williams bears repeating: \n  The right to form a party for the advancement of political goals means little if a party can \nbe kept off the election ballot and thus denied an equal opportunity to win votes. So also, \nthe right to vote is heavily burdened if that vote may be cast only for one of two parties at \na time when other parties are clamoring for a place on the ballot. \n \nWilliams, 393 U.S. at 31. This Courtโs intervention is amply justified to prevent such harm to \nPlaintiffโs โmost precious freedoms.โ Id. at 30. \nBy contrast, Defendant will not suffer any harm if the Court grants Plaintiff the  \nrequested relief. The LPME has qualified for Maineโs general election ballot with regularity in \npast election cycles, and there is no evidence that Maine sustained any harm to its electoral \nprocesses as a result of their participation. On the contrary, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly \nobserved, โ[h]istorically political figures outside the two major parties have been fertile sources \nof new ideas and new programs; many of their challenges to the status quo have in time made \ntheir way into the political mainstream.โ Anderson, 460 U.S. at 794; see Ill. Bd. of Elections v. \nSocialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 185-86 (1979); Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234, \n250-251 (1957). Thus, the continued participation of Plaintiff in Maineโs electoral process will \nbenefit, not harm, Defendant and the voters of Maine generally.   \n  Moreover, the relief that Plaintiff requests here is precisely the same relief that other \nstates have granted of their own volition and neighboring courts have ordered. On March 30, \n2020, for example, Vermont enacted legislation providing that โa person shall not be required to \ncollect voter signatures in order to have the personโs name placed on any ballot in the year \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 5   Filed 07/31/20   Page 17 of 20    PageID #: 69\n2020.โ14  Every  federal  court  that  has  addressed  this  issue  so  far  has  found  that  signature \nrequirements for ballot-access impose severe burdens on candidatesโ rights during the time of \nthis pandemic. See Garbett v. Herbert, Civ. No. 2:20-cv-245-RJS, 2020 WL 2064101 at *12 (D. \nUtah May 1, 2020); Libertarian Party of Ill. v. Pritzker, Civ. No. 1:20-cv-2112, 2020 WL \n1951687 at *4 (E.D. Ill. April 23, 2020); Esshaki v. Whitmer, Civ. No. 2:20-cv-10831, 2020 WL \n1910154 at *6 (E.D. Mich. April 20, 2020), affโd in part and reversed in part, No. 20-136, 2020 \nWL 2185553 at *1 (6th Cir. May 5, 2020)(โThe district court correctly determined that the \n[ballot-access restrictions] imposed a severe burden on the plaintiffsโ ballot access, so strict \nscrutiny appliedโฆโ). One state court that applied an analogous framework similarly found a \nsevere burden. See Goldstein v. Secretary of the Commonwealth, 125 N.E.3d 560, 571 (Ma. \n2020). In Virginia, a federal court found that the stateโs signature requirements for candidates for \npresident  unconstitutionally  burdened  the  candidatesโ  First  Amendment  rights  during  the \nCOVID-19 pandemic and lowered those requirements by 50%. Constitution Party of Virginia, et \nal. v. Virginia State Board of Elections, et al., No. 3:20-CV-00349-JAG (E.D.VA. July 15, \n2020). In New Hampshire, a federal court found the same and lowered those requirements by \n35%. Libertarian Party of New Hampshire, et al. v. Christopher T. Sununu, et al., No. 20-CV-\n688-JL, 2020 WL 4340308, at *23 (D.N.H. July 28, 2020). This Court should likewise conclude \nthat Maineโs signature requirements impose a severe burden under current circumstances and \nreduce the requirements. \n  Further, Maine requires that candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives only turn in \n2,000 verified signatures in order to qualify for the ballot.15 If 2,000 signatures are enough to \n                                                            \n14 See An Act Relating to Government Operations in Response to the COVID-19 Outbreak, HB 681 (2020), \navailable at https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2020/Docs/BILLS/H-0681/H \n0681%20As%20Passed%20by%20Both%20House%20and%20Senate%20Official.pdf (accessed June 5, 2020). \n15 See, 21-A M.R.S. ยง 354(5) \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 5   Filed 07/31/20   Page 18 of 20    PageID #: 70\ncertify that candidates for the House have a sufficient modicum of support, then 2,000 should be \nplenty to establish the same for candidates to the presidency. Indeed, state imposed restrictions \nimplicate a unique burden in the context of presidential elections because those burdens have \nimplications on the voting rights of individuals both within and beyond the state. Anderson, 460 \nU.S. at 794โ95. Such national interests are greater than the interest of any individual state. Id.  \nIn addition, other states similar to Maine in size require far less signatures for presidential \ncandidates.16 No signatures are required in Colorado or Louisiana; neither has experienced any \nvoter confusion from too many candidates on the presidential ballot. Id. Tennessee only requires \n275 signatures in a state more than four times larger than Maine; it has never experienced any \nvoter confusion from too many candidates on the presidential ballot. Id. Proportionate to the \npopulation, only seven states in the nation impose higher signature requirements on independent \npresidential candidates, and none of the 42 states with fewer signature requirements per capita \nhave ever experienced any voter confusion from too many candidates on the Presidential ballot. \nId. Indeed, the average signature requirement for the states approximates the 2,000 signature \nrequirement Maine recognizes as sufficient for candidates to the U.S. House of Representatives. \nId. \nNo harm will come to Defendant or the State of Maine if the Court grants similar relief \nhere. On the contrary, Defendant will be relieved of the considerable burden of validating 4,000 \npetition signatures during the crunch of the election cycle. The balance of harms therefore \nweighs strongly in Plaintiffโs favor. \nD.  The Requested Relief Is in the Public Interest. \nPreliminary relief will benefit the public because it will protect the First Amendment  \n                                                            \n16 https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_access_for_presidential_candidates \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 5   Filed 07/31/20   Page 19 of 20    PageID #: 71\nrights of Maine voters to cast their votes effectively and to associate with candidates and parties \nthey  support.  โInjunctions  protecting  First  Amendment  freedoms  are  always  in  the  public \ninterest.โ American Civil Liberties Union of Il. v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583, 589 (7th Cir. 2012) \n(quoting Christian Legal Socโy v. Walker, 453 F.3d 853, 859 (7th Cir. 2006) (footnote omitted)).  \nPlaintiff suspects that Defendant will argue that lowering the signature requirement for \nindependent candidates will result in an โovercrowded ballotโ or confusion at the polling place. \nHowever, Defendantโs fears are misguided. There has never been a single instance of voter \nconfusion from an overcrowded ballot in neither Maine nor the countryโs history. In fact, states \nhave held elections with dozens of candidates and no resulting confusion.17 \nThis factor therefore also weighs in Plaintiffโs favor. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully moves the Court to issue preliminary \nrelief. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                            \n17 The 2003 California Gubernatorial recall election is an instructive example. In that election 240 candidates turned \nin filing papers and 135 qualified to appear on the ballot. The election went forward without a hitch resulting in the \nelection of Arnold Schwarzenegger. PBS (August 14, 2003) California Certifies 135 Candidates in Recall Election. \n(https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/politics-july-dec03-recall_08-14).

Plaintiff Jo Jorgensen, the Libertarian Party of Maine candidate for U.S. President, by \nand through her counsel, Barnes Law, and pursuant to the First and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe  United  States  Constitution,  and  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1983,  states  the  following  complaint  for \ndeclaratory  judgment  and  permanent,  preliminary,  and  emergency  injunctive  relief  against \nMatthew Dunlap, in his official capacity as the Secretary of State of Maine, to restrain him, in \nthis election only as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, from enforcing in full the petition \nsignature requirements for independent candidates to the U.S. presidency found at 21-A M.R.S. \nยงยง 353 and 354(5)(A). Plaintiff requests this Court, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, lower \nthe petition signature requirement found in 21-A M.R.S. ยง 354(5)(A) from 4,000 to 2,000.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 1   Filed 07/31/20   Page 2 of 17    PageID #: 2\nPARTIES \n2.  Plaintiff Jo Jorgensen is the Libertarian Party of Maine (โLPMEโ) candidate for U.S. \nPresident, a petition circulator and voter. The LPME is a political party and the Maine affiliate of \nthe national Libertarian Party that seeks to have its candidate for U.S. President on the Maine \nballot for the 2020 general election. \n3.  Defendant Matthew Dunlap is the Secretary of State of Maine and is charged with \nenforcing and administering Maine election laws, including the petition signature requirements \nfor independent candidates for the 2020 general election. \n4.  Defendant  Dunlap  is  specifically  empowered  by  Maine  statute  to  determine  if \nindependent candidates for the U.S. presidency have collected the required number of valid \nsignatures necessary to secure access to Maineโs 2020 general election ballot.  \n5.  At all relevant times herein, Defendant Dunlap was engaged in state action under the \ncolor of state law. \n6.  Defendant Dunlap is being sued in his official capacity for declaratory and injunctive \nrelief under 42 U.S.C ยง 1983 and 28 U.SC. ยง 2201, as well as costs and attorneyโs fees under 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1988(b).  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343. \n8.  Plaintiffโs claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. ยงยง \n2201 and 2202, Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the general legal \nand equitable powers of this Court.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 1   Filed 07/31/20   Page 3 of 17    PageID #: 3\n9.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b) because the Defendant resides \nin this judicial district and because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nPlaintiffโs claims occurred in this judicial district.  \nFACTS \nA.  The COVID-19 Pandemic and Maineโs Response \n10.  In December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus \nemerged in Wuhan, China. It is an infectious disease, now known as โCOVID-19,โ that can \nspread from person to person and can result in serious illness and death. According to the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, older adults (particularly those over 65) and people \nof any age who have serious underlying medical conditions (including asthma, heart disease, \ncancer, and diabetes) may be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.  \n11.  On January 30, 2020, after the coronavirus outbreak had spread well beyond China, the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 constituted a Public Health \nEmergency of International Concern. 1 The next day, as a result of confirmed cases of COVID-\n19 in the United States, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M.

Maineโs Ballot Access Procedure for Independent Candidates \n24.  Maine classifies general election candidates into two groups: Primary (Party) Candidates \nand Non-Party Candidates.15 \n25.  A political party meeting the qualifications of 21-A M.R.S. c.5 is eligible to participate in \nthe primary election with the winning candidate from each qualified party automatically placed \non the general election ballot.16 \n26.  All other candidates, including independent candidates for the U.S. presidency, must \ncollect a certain number of valid signatures from registered Maine voters on nomination petitions \ncalled Nomination by Petition (Non-Party), in order to secure access to the 2020 Maine general \nelection ballot.17 \n27.  Independent candidates seeking to qualify for Maineโs 2020 general election ballot must \nalso file a Consent of Petition (Non-Party) Candidate.18 \n28.  Nomination petitions for independent candidates for the U.S. presidency may only be \ncirculated starting on January 1st of the year of the election.19  \n29.  Nomination petitions may only be signed by registered Maine voters.20 \n30.  Each voter signing a nomination petition โmust personally sign their name in such a \nmanner as to satisfy the register of his municipality that he is a registered voter.โ  Additionally, \neither the voter or the circulator of the petition must print the voterโs name.21 \n                                                            \n15 State of Maine 2020 Candidateโs Guide to Ballot Access at pp. 8-22. \n16 State of Maine 2020 Candidateโs Guide to Ballot Access at p. 8, 25. \n17 See, 21-A M.R.S. ยงยง 353, 354. \n18 See, 21-A M.R.S. ยง 355. \n19 See, 21-A M.R.S. ยง 354(6). \n20 See, 21-A M.R.S. ยง 354(2). \n21 See, 21-A M.R.S. ยง 354(3). \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 1   Filed 07/31/20   Page 9 of 17    PageID #: 9\n31.  In Maine, access to the general election ballot through Nomination by Petition (Non-\nParty) requires independent candidates for the U.S. presidency to collect a minimum of 4,000 \nand a maximum of 6,000 valid signatures to secure ballot access.22 \n32.  Collecting signatures by hand, on paper nomination petitions, is inherently burdensome, \nlabor-intensive and inefficient as a means of demonstrating voter support.  Many signatures are \noften invalidated due to illegibility, missing information and other mere technical defects.  This \nobligates candidates and political parties to collect at least 25% to 50% more signatures than \nrequired, in order to account for those signatures that might be later invalidated.  In fact, the \nMaine statute recognizes that at least 50% additional signatures above the minimum required \nshould be collected by permitting the collection and filing of up to 6,000 signatures to meet the \nminimum 4,000 valid signature threshold necessary to secure ballot access for  independent \ncandidates for the U.S. presidency. Id. \n33.  After signatures are collected the circulator of a nomination petition must verify by oath \nor affirmation before a notary public or other person authorized by law to administer oaths or \naffirmations that the circulator personally witnessed all of the signatures to the petition and that \nto the best of the circulatorโs knowledge and belief each signature is the signature of the person \nwhose name it purports to be.23 \n34.  Nomination petitions for independent presidential candidates must be submitted to the \nregistrar (or clerk at the request or upon the absence of the registrar), for certification by 5 p.m. \non July 25 of the election year.24 \n35.  Once nomination petition signatures are certified, the nomination petition must then be \nfiled with Defendant no later than 5 p.m. on August 1st of the election year.25 \n                                                            \n22 See, 21-A M.R.S. ยง 354(5)(A). \n23 See, 21-A M.R.S. ยง 354(7)(A). \n24 See, 21-A M.R.S. ยง 354(7)(B)&(C). \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 1   Filed 07/31/20   Page 10 of 17    PageID #: 10\n36.  For a candidate to qualify for the ballot, a nomination petition must meet all of the \nrequirements set forth in 21-A M.R.S. ยง354.26 \nC.  Plaintiffโs Signature Gathering Efforts Hampered by the COVID-19 Pandemic \n37.  Third parties and independent candidates for president in a normal election year have \naccess to significantly less resources, personnel, and equipment. Their campaigns rely on boots-\non-the-ground volunteer work and community outreach.  \n38.  The COVID-19 outbreak has made the already arduous path to ballot access for third \nparty and independent candidates for president now impossible.  \n39.  First, petition signatures are typically collected during the spring and summer at public \nevents and festivals. However, this year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing social \ndistancing mandates from Governor Mills, the vast majority of public events scheduled for the \nspring and summer in Maine were cancelled.27 \n40.  Second, general public reluctance to engage in the sort of physical contact required to \nsign a petition has resulted in many of Plaintiffโs petition circulators being immediately rejected \nupon attempting to solicit signatures.  \n41.  Third,  primary  election  day  petitioning  at  the  polling  places  typically  represents  an \noutsized  portion  of  Plaintiffโs  signature  gathering  efforts,  but  this  year  those  efforts  were \nhampered by Governor Mills and the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased number of absentee \nvoters resulted in far fewer individual voters traveling to the polls and thus far less voters signing \npetitions. Further, Governor Mills mandated that all petition circulators must stand outside the \npolling place instead of at their usual tables indoors. This not only greatly hindered petition \n                                                                                                                                                                                                \n25 See, 21-A M.R.S. ยง 354(8)(A). \n26 See, 21-A M.R.S. ยง 354(9). \n27 Burnham, Emily; Bangor Daily News (April 29, 2020); Hereโs a list of the Maine parades, festivals and concerts \nthat have been scrapped for 2020; (https://bangordailynews.com/2020/04/29/news/bangor/bangors-memorial-day-\nparade-has-been-canceled/).  \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 1   Filed 07/31/20   Page 11 of 17    PageID #: 11\ncirculators ability to intercept and solicit signatures from voters, but given the heavy rain that fell \nacross most of Maine that day, it led to the actual destruction of several petition sheets.  \n42.  Fourth, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Governorโs executive orders in \nresponse, Plaintiffโs campaign was unable to hire enough professional petition circulators and \nnotaries. On more than one occasion, notaries and circulators refused to work citing that the \nGovernor had not opened up the state to the public. Additionally, on more than one occasion a \npetition circulator was denied a hotel room due to the ongoing restrictions.  \n43.  Fifth, Maineโs requirement that signature petitions be turned into each individual town \nhall for certification prior to being turned in to the Secretary of State, has resulted in unnecessary \ndifficulties and hampered Plaintiffโs ability to turn in signatures during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, many town halls are operating on reduced hours and interact \nwith  the  public  by  appointment  only,  with  many  closed  entirely.  Plaintiffโs  campaign  has \ncollected signatures from more than 285 towns, but as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, \nongoing  social  distancing  restrictions,  reduced  town  hall  hours  and  days  of  operation,  and \nappointment-only mandates, the campaign has experienced significant delays and complications \nin receiving the certified petition sheets, which further reduces the amount of signatures that will \nbe submitted to the Secretary of State. \n44.  Plaintiffโs campaign began its efforts to collect petition signatures as soon as it was able, \nJanuary 1, 2020; however, as a result of the above, Plaintiffโs campaign was only able to collect \n4,400 unverified petition signatures. Thus, Plaintiff believes, that absent relief from this Court, \nonce signatures are verified, she will not have enough signatures to qualify her to appear on \nMaineโs 2020 general election ballot.   \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 1   Filed 07/31/20   Page 12 of 17    PageID #: 12\nD.  U.S. Constitutional Law \n45.  The First Amendment declares in no uncertain terms that Congress shall make no law \nabridging the freedom of speech. U.S. Const. amend. I. See also Citizens United v. FEC, 558 \nU.S. 310, 336 (2010). This restriction against governmental power is applied to the states \nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment. Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 135 S. Ct. 2218, 2226 (2015). \n46.  โIt is beyond debate that freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs \nand ideas is an inseparable aspect of the โlibertyโ assured by the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment, which embraces freedom of speech.โ NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. \n449, 460 (1958). \n47.  The Supreme Court has made clear, โwhether the beliefs sought to be advanced by \nassociation pertain to political, economic, religious or cultural matters โฆ state action which may \nhave the effect of curtailing the freedom to associate is subject to the closest scrutinyโ Id. at 460-\n61. \n48.  The right to โvoluntary political association โฆ is an important aspect of the First \nAmendment freedomโ that the Supreme Court โhas consistently found entitled to constitutional \nprotection.โ Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, 431 U.S. 801, 808 (1977). \n49.  A personโs ability to exercise their rights guaranteed under the First Amendment is \nโ[u]ndeniably enhanced by group association.โ Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 15 (1976) (quoting \nNAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. at 460. \n50.  Ballot restrictions that severely burden the right to vote and associate violate the First \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution. See Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 728-29 (1974). \n51.  Accordingly, โ[p]recision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely \ntouching our most precious freedoms. If the State has open to it a less drastic way of satisfying \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 1   Filed 07/31/20   Page 13 of 17    PageID #: 13\nits legitimate interests, it may not choose a legislative scheme that broadly stifles the exercise of \nfundamental personal liberties.โ Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 59 (1973) (internal quotation \nmarks and citations omitted). \n52.  Therefore, in recognizing that States must enact election codes for orderly, fair, and \nhonest elections, courts reviewing challenges to ballot access cases impose a flexible standard. \nBurdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433-34 (1992). If the election regulation imposes a severe \nburden, then the regulation must survive strict scrutiny. Id. at 434. By contrast, if the election \nregulation imposes a light burden, rational basis or intermediate scrutiny applies. Id. \n53.  Under the current conditions created by COVID-19, including a declared state of \nemergency in the state, Governor Millโs Stay At Home Order, as well as a declared National \nemergency, Maineโs signature requirement imposes a severe burden on Plaintiff. \n54.  This burden is compounded because of the various government recommendations that \nindividuals maintain at least six feet distance between them. \n55.  In analogous situations, courts have extended voter registration deadlines in light of \nnatural disasters, such as hurricanes. See Fla. Democratic Party v. Scott, 215 F. Supp. 3d 1250 \n(N.D. Fla. 2016). In that courtโs analysis of the burden, the court noted that in the final week \nbefore voter registration closed, an estimated 100,000 people were expected to register. Id. at \n1257. But because of Hurricane Matthew, these potential voters were forced to flee the State. Id. \nThus, these potential voters could not vote because they were unregistered. Id. Floridaโs voter \nregistration statute imposed a severe burden that it could not justify. Id. \n56.  Because the inability to register to vote meant these 100,000 people could not vote, the \ncourt ruled that was a severe burden. Id. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 1   Filed 07/31/20   Page 14 of 17    PageID #: 14\n57.  Florida could not justify its severe burden because, similar to here, several other states \nimpacted by Hurricane Matthew either extended their voter registration deadlines or permitted \nvoter registration on Election Day. Id. Accordingly, under the flexible approach explained in \nBurdick, the court ruled that under any standard, Florida could not justify its decision not to \nextend voter registration in light of Hurricane Matthew. Id. at 1257-58; see also Ga. Coalition \nfor the Peoples' Agenda, Inc. v. Deal, 214 F. Supp. 3d 1344 (S.D. Ga. 2016) (ordering an \nextension of voter registration deadline due to Hurricane Matthew because the loss of the right to \nvote would be an irreparable harm and when balanced to the administrative burden of extending \nregistration deadline, the harm to voting rights outweighed the administrative burden). \n58.  Accordingly, Maine does not have a compelling or even sufficiently important interest to \njustify maintaining its 4,000-signature requirement in light of the current public health \nemergency. \n59.  At all times stated herein Defendant was acting under color of state law.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT ONE \n(Violation of First and Fourteenth Amendment Rights, Equal Protection โ 1983 Action) \n60.  Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference the allegations contained in the  preceding \nparagraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n61.  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides โCongress shall make \nno  law  respecting  an establishment  of  religion,  or  prohibiting the  free  exercise  thereof;  or \nabridging  the  freedom  of  speech,  or  of  the  press;  or  the  right  of  the  people  peaceably  to \nassemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.โ U.S. Const. amend. I. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 1   Filed 07/31/20   Page 15 of 17    PageID #: 15\n62.  The First Amendmentโs guarantees of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom \nof assembly, freedom of religion, and freedom to petition for redress of grievances are applied to \nthe states and their political subdivisions under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution.  \n63.  Under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, every person who, under color of state law, subjects any citizen \nof the United States to the deprivation of โrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the \nConstitution and laws,โ shall be liable to the injured party. \n64.  Defendantโs actions effectively prohibit Plaintiff from obtaining the required number of \nsignatures, and in turn, prevents her from having her name placed on the ballot in violation of her \nfreedom of speech and association, equal protection, and due process rights as guaranteed by the \nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments, and as enforced by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n65.  Because  of  the  relevant  Declarations  of  Emergency  and  Governor  Millsโ  executive \norders,  it  is  impracticable  for  Plaintiff  and  her  campaign  to  obtain  4,000  verified  petition \nsignatures. \n66.  Because  of  the  relevant  Declarations  of  Emergency  and  Governor  Millsโ  executive \norders, Maineโs petition signature requirements are overly broad, in no way narrowly tailored, \nand deprive Plaintiff of her First and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. \n67.  Defendant  has  no  governmental  interest  so  compelling  as  to  justify  the  denial  of \nPlaintiffโs rights as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution.  \n68.  Defendant has less restrictive means by which his interests could be met. \n69.  Plaintiff has no adequate legal, administrative, or other remedy by which to prevent or \nminimize the continuing irreparable harm to her constitutional rights. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 1   Filed 07/31/20   Page 16 of 17    PageID #: 16\n70.  Plaintiff is therefore entitled to declaratory and permanent injunctive relief pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 2201, 2202.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs ask this Court: \nA.  To  immediately  issue  a  temporary  restraining  order,  followed  by  a  preliminary \ninjunction, and ultimately a permanent injunction, requiring Defendant, his officers, agents, \nservants, employees, and attorneys, and any persons in active concert or participation with him, \nto reduce the petition signature requirement found in 21-A M.R.S. ยง 354(5)(A) from 4,000 to \n2,000. \nB.  To enter a judgment declaring 21-A M.R.S. ยงยง 353 and 354(5)(A) as written violate the \nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution as applied to independent candidates \nduring this particular election; \nC.  To award Plaintiff her attorneyโs fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988; and \nD.  To grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00272-NT   Document 1   Filed 07/31/20   Page 17 of 17    PageID #: 17\n            Respectfully submitted,  \nMAHANY LAW PARTNERS LLC \n \n/s/ Brian Mahany         \nBrian Mahany, Bar #003269 \n8112 W.
