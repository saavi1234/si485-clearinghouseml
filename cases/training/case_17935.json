On August 27, 2020, the League of Women Voters Mississippi, Mississippi State Conference of the NAACP, and three individuals filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. The plaintiffs sued the state of Mississippi under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\r\n<p>Represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Lawyers&rsquo; Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and a private firm, the plaintiffs sought three declarations: 1) that that they were eligible to vote absentee due to the risk of contracting COVID-19 in-person; 2) the notarization requirement for a ballot violates the right to vote; and 3) the defendants&rsquo; failure to provide adequate notice and opportunity to cure (fix ballot and match signatures) the rejection of absentee ballots is illegal. The case was assigned to Judge F. Keith Ball.</p>\r\n<p>On September 17th, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which they withdrew on October 12th. On October 8th, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss due to lack of standing.&nbsp;On October 20, 2020, the court dismissed the suit without prejudice, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2), with agreement of the parties, in light of the state&rsquo;s new &lsquo;notice and cure&rsquo; process, as well as the availability of curbside voting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

WATSON,  JR.,  in  his  official \ncapacity as Secretary of State of Mississippi; and \nLYNN  FITCH,  in  her  official  capacity  as \nAttorney General of the State of Mississippi, \n                    Defendants. \nCOMPLAINT \nINTRODUCTION \n1. Plaintiffs Cynthia Parham, Jed Oppenheim, Cheryl Goggin, League of Women \nVoters of Mississippi, and Mississippi State Conference of the NAACP (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) \nbring this action for immediate injunctive and declaratory relief against Mississippi Secretary of \nState Michael Watson and Defendant Attorney General Lynn Fitch (collectively, “Defendants”) \nfor failing to protect Mississippi voters’ fundamental right to vote during the COVID-19 public \nhealth crisis, including during the November 3, 2020 general election (“November election”).  \n2. The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is the virus that causes COVID-19—an \ninfectious disease that has spread throughout the world at a rapid pace.  The COVID-19 pandemic \nhas created an unquestionable public health crisis that has disrupted—indeed, upended—all facets \n1\n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 2 of 58\nof public life across the United States.  At the date of filing this Complaint, at least 79,206 people \nin Mississippi have contracted COVID-19 and 2,315 have died.   \n3. Unfortunately, the toll of COVID-19 is steadily increasing—both in cases and in \ndeaths—and public health officials have been clear that the crisis will continue, if not worsen, into \nthe fall and winter.  Public health experts warn that the coronavirus will continue to pose a serious \nthreat to public health and safety until a vaccine becomes available and have projected that it is \nhighly unlikely that an FDA-approved vaccine will be mass-produced and widely available in time \nfor the November election. \n4. Because the coronavirus spreads through close contact between individuals, public \nhealth experts recommend that people protect themselves by staying home and maintaining at least \nsix feet of distance from people outside of their household.  Events that bring crowds of people \ntogether, particularly indoors, present high risk of mass transmission.  Social distancing guidelines \nhave been implemented and encouraged by federal, state, and local governments to slow the spread \nof the deadly disease.  Indeed, many have recognized that it is the best, most effective tool for \ncurbing the pandemic. \n5. COVID-19, therefore, poses a meaningful threat to in-person voters, especially \nthose voters at higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19.  Mississippi’s absentee voting \neligibility requirements force those voters to face a potentially devastating choice: put their health \n(perhaps life) at risk or not exercise their fundamental right to vote.  Given the persistent and grave \npublic health concerns, many Mississippi voters will be reluctant or unable to cast a ballot in person \nas long as the COVID-19 pandemic persists, including during the November election.  Defendants \nhave failed to take necessary steps to protect Mississippi voters’ fundamental right to vote despite \nthe public health risks of voting in person during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 3 of 58\n6. Voting absentee is available only to Mississippians who meet one of several \nexcuses  under  Mississippi  law.    Because  of  Defendants’  actions  and  omissions,  voters  in \nMississippi are confused as to whether they meet the absentee voting eligibility requirements if \nthey reasonably fear that voting in person may increase their risk of exposure to COVID-19.  The \ncomplete lack of clarity exists even if voters have preexisting medical conditions that make them \nhigher risk for COVID-19 and the severe complications that accompany the disease.  Defendants \nhave exacerbated, not remedied, this confusion. \n7. Further, other aspects of Mississippi’s absentee ballot law create unconstitutional \nburdens on Plaintiffs’ right to vote and deny Mississippi voters due process under law.  The \nrequirement that the voter’s signature be notarized or signed by an official authorized to administer \noaths is an untenable burden for any voters who fear contact with others may increase their risk of \ncontracting the coronavirus.  Additionally, Mississippi’s failure to provide notice of and an \nopportunity to cure ballots that have been rejected because of Mississippi’s error-prone signature \nmismatch process threatens to unconstitutionally deprive thousands of Mississippians their right \nto vote. \n8. Accordingly, Plaintiffs challenge three components of Mississippi’s election laws \nand  regulations in  the  context  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  (together,  the  “Challenged \nRequirements”). \n9. First, Plaintiffs challenge Defendants’ failure to advise voters unequivocally that, \npursuant to the express language of the controlling statute, Mississippi’s law allows voters to vote \nby absentee ballot if they reasonably fear that voting in person will expose themselves or others to \nthe risk of contracting the coronavirus. \n3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 4 of 58\n10. This result should be obvious from the plain language of the governing law that \nallows voters to vote absentee if they are “unable to vote in person without substantial hardship to \nhimself or others, or whose attendance at the voting place could reasonably cause danger to \nhimself, or others.” Miss. Code Ann. § 23-15-713(d).  The Mississippi Legislature also recently \nexplicitly  defined  “temporary  disability”  to  include  voters  subject  to  a  “physician-imposed \nquarantine” or “caring for a dependent under a physician-imposed quarantine” due to COVID-19 \nfor the remainder of 2020.  Id.  (referred to hereafter as “the Excuse Requirement”).  \n11. Despite the clear legislative intent to protect voters who are at risk of contracting \ncoronavirus and exposure to COVID-19 by allowing them to vote by absentee ballot, Defendant \nWatson has refused to say that is so, and has failed to contradict statements by state officials that \nthe statute’s protections are significantly limited.  For example, the Governor of Mississippi has \npublicly stated Mississippi law does not allow for voters with comorbidities or fear of contracting \nthe coronavirus to qualify for absentee voting, and Defendant Watson issued no response.  County \nelection officials are still awaiting concrete instructions from Defendant Watson on processing \nabsentee ballots in light of COVID-19 and the recent clarifications to the eligibility requirements \nunder House Bill 1521 (HB 1521).   \n12. Not surprisingly, Mississippi voters are in a state of confusion, burdened with the \nchoice between potentially violating the law by requesting an absentee ballot to preserve their \nhealth or putting their health at risk by voting in person. This unconstitutional burden is not \noutweighed by any legitimate state interest.  Thus, Plaintiffs ask this Court to order Defendants to \nrelieve this burden by publicly advising voters that Mississippi law allows all voters to vote \nabsentee who reasonably fear exposure to COVID-19 if they vote in person.  \n4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 5 of 58\n13. If the Court does not agree this result is mandated by the language of the statute, \nthen Plaintiffs ask the Court to find in the alternative that Mississippi’s absentee ballot law \nunconstitutionally burdens Mississippi voters during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Specifically, \nPlaintiffs seek an order from this Court declaring that Defendant’s application of the Excuse \nRequirement violates Plaintiffs’ fundamental right to vote when they are not allowed to vote by \nmail during the COVID-19 pandemic if they reasonably fear voting in person will increase their \nrisk of exposure to COVID-19, and ordering Defendants to provide such remedy.  Plaintiffs also \nseek in the alternative a declaration that the statute governing eligibility for absentee ballots is \nunconstitutionally vague, and state officials have contributed to its vagueness with their conflicting \nstatements as to the applicability of the law, and Plaintiffs ask this Court to construe the law so as \nto reach a constitutional result: that voters with a reasonable fear of exposure to COVID-19 if they \nvote in person may vote by absentee ballot.   \n14. Second, Plaintiffs challenge Mississippi law requiring notarization or attestation \nfrom an official authorized to administer oaths to apply for an absentee ballot and to vote absentee \nunder  Sections  23-15-627  and  23-15-715  of  the  Mississippi  Code  (the  “Notarization \nRequirement”).  Complying with the Notarization Requirement places a significant burden on \nvoters, particularly those at higher-risk for COVID-19 who have strictly socially distanced to \nprotect their health, because it forces them to break self-quarantine twice to comply.  Plaintiffs ask \nthe Court to declare that, under the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mississippi’s \nNotarization  Requirement  unconstitutionally  burdens  Plaintiff  Goggin’s  and  Organizational \nPlaintiffs’ members’ right to vote under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and enjoin its \nenforcement for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic \n5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 6 of 58\n15. Third, Plaintiffs challenge the lack of notice and opportunity to cure ballots rejected \nbased on faulty signature match procedures under Section 23-15-641(1) of the Mississippi Code \n(the “Cure Prohibition”), which stands to disenfranchise voters who cast their ballot by mail.  Even \nif Mississippians are able to comply with each of these requirements, local election officials may \nstill reject a voter’s ballot if the official believes the voter’s signature on the ballot envelope does \nnot match the signature on the voter’s absentee ballot application.  Signature match analysis is \nnotoriously inaccurate, and voters must be given notice that their ballots have been rejected on that \nbasis and an opportunity to cure the rejection.  Mississippi law does not provide either notice or \nan opportunity to cure.   \n16. Because Section 23-15-641 fails to provide absentee voters with notice of and an \nopportunity to cure signature verification deficiencies, its process for counting absentee ballots is \nunconstitutional and deprives absentee voters of procedural due process in violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment and their fundamental right to vote in violation of the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n17. Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 to redress the \ndeprivation under color of state law of rights secured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe U.S. Constitution.  \n18. This Court has original jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 because the matters in controversy arise under the Constitution and \nlaws of the United States.  Plaintiffs bring this action to redress the deprivation, under color of \nstate law, of rights, privileges, and immunities secured by the U.S. Constitution and federal law.   \n19. This Court has authority to grant both declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to \n§ 2201 (authority to grant declaratory relief) and § 2202 (authority to grant relief ancillary to \n6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 7 of 58\ndeclaratory judgment), in addition to its authority under the Civil Rights Act and its inherent \nequitable powers. \n20. The Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants, who are sued only in their \nofficial capacity as officers and officials of the State of Mississippi.  The violations complained of \nconcern their conduct in such capacity. \n21. Venue lies in the Southern District of Mississippi pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) \nbecause all Defendants are residents of Mississippi, and a substantial part of the events or \nomissions giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred and will occur in this judicial district. \nPLAINTIFFS \n22. Plaintiff CYNTHIA PARHAM is 61 years old, African-American, and a resident \nof Oxford, Mississippi.  She is a U.S. citizen and a lawfully registered Mississippi voter.  Ms. \nParham lives with her husband, who is 62 years old.  Ms. Parham suffers from heart disease, \ndiabetes, and kidney disease, and her husband suffers from pulmonary disease.  Because of these \nconditions, both Ms. Parham and her husband are at higher risk for contracting, suffering severe \ncomplications, and potentially dying from COVID-19.  Due to this increased risk, Ms. Parham has \nbeen limiting in-person interaction with individuals outside her family, avoiding contact with large \ngroups, and using personal protective equipment when she must go out.  Ms. Parham only leaves \nher home for necessary errands and for work, where she only interacts with one employee and a \nsmall number of clients.  She maintains a strict six-foot distance between herself and all other \npersons at work, and everyone is required to wear a mask.  Surfaces are disinfected frequently.  \nWhen Ms. Parham shops for groceries, she always wears a mask and stays six feet away from \nothers.  Ms. Parham is a regular voter and usually prefers to vote in-person.  Because of her and \nher husband’s health conditions, she will need to vote by absentee ballot during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including the November election.  Ms. Parham believes that voting in-person at her \n7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 8 of 58\npolling place presents a severe risk to her and her husband’s health and life.  Ms. Parham \nunderstands that to vote absentee in Mississippi, she must qualify for an excuse.  Although the law \nwas changed to allow people with a “physician-imposed quarantine,” or who are caring for a \n“dependent” under a “physician-imposed quarantine” to request an absentee ballot, Ms. Parham is \nunsure whether she qualifies to select that or any other existing excuse.  If Ms. Parham cannot vote \nby absentee ballot, she will be forced to either vote in person—risking her health and her husband’s \nhealth—or to not cast a ballot until the COVID-19 pandemic ends.  Ms. Parham is a dedicated, \nregular voter; she even ran for local office in March of 2020.  To not vote during the COVID-19 \npandemic would be devastating to Ms. Parham. \n23. Plaintiff JED OPPENHEIM is 40 years old, white, and a resident of Jackson, \nMississippi.  He is a U.S. citizen and a lawfully registered Mississippi voter.  He lives at home \nwith his wife, Harriett Oppenheim, who is 37 years old and a registered voter, and their one-year-\nold son.  Mr. Oppenheim’s wife has health conditions that put her at higher risk of contracting and \nsuffering severe complications, and potentially dying from COVID-19.  She has lupus, meaning \nshe is immunocompromised; high blood pressure; and is a kidney transplant recipient after renal \nfailure.  If anyone in the household tests positive for COVID-19, it is likely that Harriett would \nneed to go immediately to the hospital.  Harriett’s 69-year-old mother is also part of their family \nunit, although she does not physically live in the same house.  Mr. Oppenheim visits his mother-\nin-law to bring her grocery items, take her mail, and drop off his son for childcare a few times a \nweek.  His mother-in-law has moderate asthma, which makes her higher risk for contracting and \nsuffering severe complications and potentially dying from COVID-19.  Because of the risk \nCOVID-19 poses to his family’s health, Mr. Oppenheim limits his outside activity and avoids \ncontact with anyone outside his family unit.  When he must leave the house for necessary errands \n8 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 9 of 58\nor appointments, he always wears a mask and gloves.  Mr. Oppenheim is a lifelong, regular voter.  \nHe usually votes in-person on Election Day and prefers to do so.  He plans to vote in all upcoming \nelections in Mississippi, including the November election, but because of the severe risk that \nvoting in person poses to his wife’s life and his mother-in-law’s health, Mr. Oppenheim must vote \nby absentee ballot.  Yet, Mr. Oppenheim understands that although there is a new law providing \nan excuse on the application for an absentee ballot relating to COVID-19 for the November \nelection, it is not clear that he qualifies for that excuse.  Mr. Oppenheim sought clarity from the \nSecretary of State regarding his eligibility to vote by absentee ballot but has not received a \nresponse.  If Mr. Oppenheim is unable to vote by absentee ballot, he will have to decide whether \nto vote in person—risking the health of his family and possibly even the life of his wife—or not \nvote at all.  If he is forced to vote in person, risking his wife’s life and mother-in-law’s health, he \nwill need to take substantial safety measures to protect himself from contracting coronavirus at the \npolling  location;  these  include  wearing  personal  protective  equipment,  maintaining  6-foot \ndistance, and sanitizing his hands after touching any surfaces.  After voting, he will need to self-\nisolate away from his child and wife, potentially at a costly hotel or motel, until he tests negative \nfor COVID-19, which could take weeks.  During this time, he will not be able to care for and run \nessential and emergency errands for his family.  Being forced to vote in-person will significantly \ndisrupt his family’s lives.  \n24. Plaintiff CHERYL GOGGIN is 72 years old, white, and a resident of Hattiesburg, \nMississippi.  She is a U.S. citizen and a lawfully registered Mississippi voter, and is also a member \nof the Pine Belt chapter of the League of Women Voters of Mississippi.  Ms. Goggin lives alone \nin her home in Hattiesburg.  She is a retired art history professor and still conducts academic \nresearch.  Ms. Goggin suffers from hypertension and coronary artery disease, both of which put \n9 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 10 of 58\nher at higher risk for contracting, suffering severe complications, and potentially dying from \nCOVID-19.  Because of her age and medical conditions, since around March 11, 2020, Ms. Goggin \nhas been isolating herself as much as possible to prevent exposure to COVID-19.  She stays at \nhome except to run necessary errands and always complies with social distancing guidelines when \nshe must go out.  Ms. Goggin has also restricted visitors to her home to protect herself.  Ms. Goggin \nprefers to vote in-person at her local polling place, but because of her increased risk related to \nCOVID-19, she must vote by absentee ballot during the COVID-19 pandemic, including for the \nNovember election.  Ms. Goggin understands that because of her age, she qualifies to vote by \nabsentee ballot in Mississippi.  But Ms. Goggin also understands that, in Mississippi, her absentee \nballot application and ballot envelope must be notarized or signed by a specific official to be \ncounted because absentee voters age 65 and older are still subject to the Notarization Requirement.  \nTo comply with these requirements, Ms. Goggin would have to leave her home—where she has \nbeen self-isolating—twice and engage with the public at a location that provides notary services \nor signatures for absentee ballot materials, such as a post office or a bank.  If these requirements \nfor absentee ballot applications and ballots are not waived during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ms. \nGoggin will be forced to choose between exercising her fundamental right to vote and protecting \nher health and life.  Even if Ms. Goggin can overcome the challenges of the Notarization \nRequirement, her ballot is still subject to Mississippi’s signature verification law and she would \nnot have any notice or opportunity to cure signature-related deficiencies before her ballot is \nrejected.  \n25. Plaintiff LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF MISSISSIPPI (“LWVMS”) is the \nMississippi affiliate of the national League of Women Voters (the “LWVUS”).  LWVMS is a \nnonprofit 501(c)(4) membership organization, which relies on non-deductible dues to fund its \n10 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 11 of 58\naction and advocacy efforts.  The LWVMS also works with and through the LWVUS’s Voters \nEducation Fund, which is a 501(c)(3) organization, for which donations are tax-deductible.  \nLWVUS’s Voters Education Fund conducts voter service and education activities.  The LWVMS \nis  a  nonpartisan  civic  organization  that  neither  supports  nor opposes any political party or \ncandidate.  The mission of LWVMS is to improve governance in Mississippi by engaging all \nMississippians in the decisions that impact their lives.  LWVMS seeks to bring citizens into the \ncivic process through community outreach and capacity building, voter registration and education, \nand community-oriented policy advocacy.  \n26. The League is a grassroots organization, and most of the League’s work is made \npossible by members and volunteers.  LWVMS has five local Leagues: East-Central Mississippi \n(serving Meridian and Lauderdale County), Jackson-Area (serving Hinds, Madison, and Rankin \nCounties), Mississippi Gulf Coast (serving Hancock, Harrison, and Jackson Counties), Oxford-\nNorth Mississippi (serving Marshall, Union, Pontotoc, Calhoun, Yalobusha, Panola, Tate, Benton, \nLee, and Desoto Counties), and Pine Belt (serving Hattiesburg and the surrounding area, Forrest \nand Lamar Counties).  LWVMS has approximately 200 members, living in various communities \nacross the state.  The LWVMS is diverse, inclusive, and equitable.  The majority of LWVMS \nmembers are 55 years of age or older.  The largest local League is the Oxford-North Mississippi \nLeague with 75 members; 54 of its 75 members are over 60 years old, and the oldest Oxford-North \nLeague member is 102 years old.  \n27. Additionally, many LWVMS members are registered voters age 55-64 who are \nhigh risk for contracting, suffering severe complications, and potentially dying from COVID-19.  \nVoting in person would therefore put the health of these voters at significant risk because of the \n11 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 12 of 58\nperson-to-person contact at their polling place.  However, these members do not currently qualify \nfor an absentee ballot under Mississippi law. \n28. LWVMS regularly conducts voter service projects, including voter registration \ndrives and other events.  Local leagues lead much of the LWVMS’s voter services work and local \nleague members are essential to accomplishing voter services project goals.  Despite the person-\nto-person contact limitations posed by COVID-19, LWVMS continues to work to register and \neducate voters.  LWVMS is promoting VOTE411, a national initiative of the LWVUS’s Voter \nEducation Fund.  VOTE411 ensures all voters have the information they need to successfully \nparticipate in every election (local, state, and federal) because the League believes every election \nis important to guarantee that laws and policies reflect the values of the community.  VOTE411 \noffers a Ballot Lookup Tool for voters to enter their addresses to find their local polling place and \ncreate a personalized voter guide to take with them on Election Day for in-person voting.  LWVMS \npromotes VOTE411 in Mississippi by providing digital resources on voter registration, voter ID, \npolling locations, and absentee voting.  LWVMS also compiles voter guides for local races and \noffers  this  information  to  Mississippians  by  sending  questionnaires  to  candidates,  making \ntelephone calls, and conducting research through electronic platforms.  \n29. LWVMS has historically encouraged in-person voting on Election Day because \nabsentee ballot rules in Mississippi are complicated and burdensome.  LWVMS believes that \nabsentee ballot utilization is low in Mississippi because of these onerous requirements, including \nthe requirement that voters have an excuse to vote by absentee ballot and the requirement to have \nboth the absentee ballot application and the absentee ballot notarized or signed by a qualified \nwitness.  \n12 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 13 of 58\n30. During the COVID-19 pandemic, however, LWVMS believes in-person voting is \nnot an option for many, if not most, voters.  Because Defendants have failed to ensure safe voting \noptions during the COVID-19 pandemic and because many LWVMS members are at serious risk \nof severe complications or even death if they were to contract COVID-19, LWVMS has been and \nwill continue to help their members and Mississippi voters navigate the burdensome process for \nabsentee voting.  LWVMS is working to help Mississippi voters, including their members, vote \nsafely during the COVID-19 pandemic, including during the November general election. \n31.  For example, LWVMS is seeking and has sought guidance on the implementation \nof HB 1521, which defines absentee ballot eligibility.  Because Defendant Watson has not issued \nclear guidance to the public, LWVMS has had to expend its resources to ascertain how the new \nlaw will be implemented across the state and to educate voters about these new rules.  LWVMS \nGulf Coast recently contacted ten Circuit Court Clerks to discuss the implementation of HB 1521.  \nOf the ten Circuit Court Clerks called, only five answered the telephone.  Four of the Circuit Court \nClerks that the LWVMS spoke to were unaware of the passage of HB 1521 and had not received \nany guidance from Defendant Watson on its implementation.  \n32. The LWVMS, led by the Oxford-North local league, will also create a detailed voter \nguide to educate Mississippi voters on how to protect their health while voting during the COVID-\n19 pandemic.  The guide will explain how to navigate the absentee voting process, including the \nexcuse and notarization requirements.  All five local leagues working with their local election \nofficials to construct this pamphlet will be redirecting financial and other resources from their \nusual charitable purposes to support this initiative because of the Defendant Watson’s failure to \noffer clear guidance on implementation of the new law. \n13 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 14 of 58\n33.  The  LWVMS  plans  to  continue  this  new  voter  education  work  as  long  as \nDefendants fail to ensure safe voting for Mississippi voters during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The \nabsentee voting process in Mississippi is lengthy, complicated, and unfamiliar to most Mississippi \nvoters.  Defendants have not done enough to help voters determine whether they qualify to vote \nabsentee or to help voters navigate the absentee voting process safely during the COVID-19 \npandemic.  Defendants have failed to waive onerous requirements, issue adequate guidance to \ncounty election officials regarding absentee ballot eligibility and other requirements, conduct any \nsignificant voter education campaigns to assist voters in navigating the absentee ballot process, or \neducate voters on how to vote safely during the COVID-19 pandemic.   \n34. Additionally, many veteran poll workers are senior citizens who will be unable to \nstaff in-person polling places for the November election without severe risk to their health and life.  \nTo help address this poll worker shortage, LWVMS is launching a program to recruit new poll \nworkers from demographic groups at comparatively lower risk of serious illness from the COVID-\n19 pandemic.  This program was conceived to address the Defendants’ failure to adequately recruit, \ntrain, and support poll workers and his failure to ensure that voters who want to vote absentee can \ndo so to reduce stress on polling places and poll workers.  Without sufficient poll workers, \nLWVMS understands that election officials may close polling sites.  The LWVMS believes polling \nplace closures will lead to dangerous over-crowding and long lines at the polls in November and \nbeyond.  LWVMS Gulf Coast has already begun a pilot program to recruit new poll workers \nthrough peer-to-peer outreach and education.  As this program develops, the Gulf Coast league \nwill train other local leagues on how to implement similar programs in their regions.  The LWVMS \nwill need to divert resources from their usual voter registration work and other efforts to dedicate \nmember time, volunteer time, and other resources to this project.  \n14 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 15 of 58\n35. Plaintiff  MISSISSIPPI  STATE  CONFERENCE  OF  THE  NAACP  (“MS \nNAACP”) is a non-partisan, interracial, nonprofit membership organization headquartered in \nJackson, Mississippi.  The mission of the MS NAACP is to eliminate racial discrimination through \ndemocratic processes, protect the rights of voters, and ensure the equal political, educational, \nsocial, and economic rights of all persons, especially African Americans.  The MS NAACP \ncurrently consists of 112 units, which include branches, college chapters, and youth councils with \na revolving membership of over 11,000 members across the state and at least one member in 74 \nof the 82 counties in Mississippi.  \n36. The MS NAACP works to protect voting rights through litigation, advocacy, \nlegislation, communication, and outreach.  A considerable amount of the MS NAACP’s work and \nresources are devoted to promoting voter registration, voter education, get-out-the-vote efforts, \nelection protection, and Census participation.  The MS NAACP, along with its branches, regularly \nconducts voter registration drives and other activities to help Mississippians vote absentee or in \nperson throughout Mississippi.  \n37. During the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the MS NAACP believes in-person \nvoting is not an option for many, if not most, voters.  Because Defendants have failed to ensure \nsafe voting options during the COVID-19 pandemic, and because many MS NAACP members are \nat serious risk of severe complications or even death if they were to contract COVID-19, the MS \nNAACP has been and will continue to help their members and Mississippi voters navigate the \nburdensome process for absentee voting.  The MS NAACP is working to help Mississippi voters, \nincluding their members, vote safely during the COVID-19 pandemic, including during the \nNovember general election. \n15 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 16 of 58\n38. As a result of Mississippi’s failure to relieve its burdensome absentee voting \nprocedures in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the MS NAACP and its branches have been \nforced to divert resources, including staff and volunteer time and money, to educate voters about \nMississippi’s absentee ballot law and process by helping them (1) understand the meaning of the \nExcuse Requirement and its effect on voters’ ability to vote absentee; (2) understand how to \ncomply with the Notarization Requirement while protecting their own health during the COVID-\n19 pandemic so that their absentee ballot may be counted; and (3) decide whether and how to vote \nin person during the COVID-19 pandemic if they do not qualify for an absentee ballot.  MS \nNAACP Members and the public often turn to the MS NAACP’s branches and leadership to \nprovide voter information given that voter education is part of the mission of the organization.   \n39. To do so, the MS NAACP has spent considerable time and staff resources to \neducate its own leadership, branch leaders, members, and the general public about Mississippi’s \nabsentee voting laws and how to comply during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Its branch leaders are \nalso educating themselves about the Excuse Requirement to answer local members’ questions \nabout absentee voting during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n40. Voter registration and education campaigns are the hallmark of MS NAACP’s \nprogrammatic work.  MS NAACP has not been able to devote nearly as much time as it typically \ndoes on its statewide voter campaigns because it has had to shift its traditional voter education \nwork to focusing largely on absentee voting under the Excuse Requirement.  Due to the COVID-\n19 pandemic, the MS NAACP has spent additional staff time and resources toward informing its \nmembers about how to vote during the pandemic—including casting an absentee ballot under the \nExcuse  Requirement—which  has  taken  away  staff  and  volunteer  time  from  its  COVID-19 \nprogramming.  This programming provides support to its members and the public facing the \n16 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 17 of 58\nsocioeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with information related to healthcare, housing, \neducation, and other aspects of daily life outside of voting affected by the pandemic.  The COVID-\n19 absentee voting education is of particular importance to MS NAACP as absentee ballot \napplications become available soon.  \n41. MS NAACP also coordinates with partner advocacy organizations to run the \nstatewide voter protection hotline, which typically becomes more active leading up to an election \nonce absentee ballot applications become available.  Based on the amount of questions MS \nNAACP currently receives from community members and its own members about the Excuse \nRequirement and the current confusion, it anticipates a significant increase in questions on how to \ncast an absentee ballot during the COVID-19 pandemic.  MS NAACP and its partners are devoting \nstaff time to build out the hotline infrastructure, recruiting more volunteers for the hotline and \ntaking additional necessary steps to prepare for the increased volume in absentee voting calls.  \n42. Since the enactment of HB 1521, MS NAACP has held two virtual community \neducation conversations for the public and two virtual branch meetings discussing absentee voting \nprocedures, the Excuse Requirement, and HB 1521.  The most recent public education program \nwas on August 21, 2020.  While some MS NAACP members have voted by absentee ballot in past \nelections and most likely will vote by absentee ballot in future elections, many of them will be \nvoting absentee for the first time because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Additionally, many MS \nNAACP members are registered voters age 55-64 who are high risk for contracting, suffering \nsevere complications, and potentially dying from COVID-19.  Voting in person would therefore \nput the health of these voters at significant risk because of the person-to-person contact at their \npolling place.  But these members do not currently qualify for an absentee ballot under Mississippi \nlaw.  Members and the public at large have turned to MS NAACP and its branch leaders with \n17 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 18 of 58\nquestions on the Excuse Requirement because voter education is at the forefront of its work.  MS \nNAACP is developing fact sheets and materials to more clearly explain the Excuse Requirement, \nas many of its members are uncertain as to whether they can vote absentee during the pandemic \nunder this excuse.  \n43. MS NAACP plans to continue its COVID-19 absentee voter education work as long \nas Defendants fail to ensure safe voting for Mississippi voters during the pandemic.  The absentee \nvoting process in Mississippi is lengthy, complicated, and unfamiliar to most Mississippi voters.  \nDefendants have not done enough to help voters determine whether they qualify to vote absentee \nor to help voters navigate the absentee voting process safely during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nDefendant Watson has failed to waive onerous requirements, issue adequate guidance to county \nelection  officials  regarding  absentee  ballot  eligibility  and  other  requirements,  conduct  any \nsignificant voter education campaigns to assist voters in navigating the absentee ballot process, or \neducate voters on how to vote safely during the COVID-19 pandemic.   \nDEFENDANTS \n44. Defendant MICHAEL WATSON is the Secretary of State of Mississippi and is \nsued in his official capacity.  As head of the Elections Division, he is responsible for assuring that \nMississippians’ voices are heard clearly through the election process, training elections officials, \ncollecting election returns, and assisting local election officials in carrying out their election related \nresponsibilities.  Mississippi Secretary of State, “Elections & Voting” (last accessed August 12, \n2020), http://www.sos.ms.gov/Elections-Voting/Pages/default.aspx.  Secretary Watson is the chief \nelection officer for the purposes of the National Voter Registration Act. Miss. Code Ann. § 23-15-\n211.1.  Secretary Watson is also responsible for implementing voting system standards under the \nHelp America Vote Act and issuing supplementary instructions for the safe and efficient use of \nelectronic voting systems.  Id. §§ 23-15-169.5, 23-15-525.  Under Section 25-33-33 of the \n18 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 19 of 58\nMississippi Code, the Secretary of State may prescribe forms and establish fees for services not \notherwise provided by law.  In addition, under section 25-33-1 of the Mississippi Code, the \nSecretary of State is responsible for issuing notary public commissions on behalf of the Governor \nto all qualified applicants.  The Secretary of State has authority to promulgate regulations under \nthe Mississippi Administrative Procedures Act.  Id. § 25-43-1.101, et. seq.

Mississippi Secretary of State, “Election Code,” (last \naccessed August 12, 2020), https://www.sos.ms.gov/Policy-Research/Pages/Election-Code.aspx.  \nThe Governor of Mississippi can delegate their limited emergency powers to the Secretary of State \nfor the specific purpose of safeguarding Mississippi voters and elections.  Miss. Code Ann. § 33-\n15-11, et seq.  Once the Governor delegates this power, the Mississippi Secretary of State has the \npower to expand absentee voting to safeguard Mississippi voters and elections.  See Miss. Code \nAnn. § 23-15-713(d). \n45. Defendant LYNN FITCH is the Attorney General of the State of Mississippi and is \nsued in her official capacity.  In that capacity, she serves as the chief legal officer and advisor for \nthe state and is charged with managing all litigation on behalf of the state, except as otherwise \nspecifically  provided  by  law.    As  Attorney  General,  Defendant  Fitch  is  responsible  for \n“interven[ing] [and arguing] the constitutionality of any statute when notified of a challenge \nthereto.”  Miss. Code Ann. § 7-5-1.  The Attorney General also gives written opinion to the \nSecretary of State and other state and local officials on “any question of law relating to their \nrespective offices.”  Miss. Code Ann. § 7-5-25.  Defendant Watson has requested an Attorney \nGeneral opinion from Defendant Fitch regarding circuit clerks’ discretion to allow voters to request \nan absentee ballot under the Excuse Requirement for fear of contracting the coronavirus.   \n19 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 20 of 58\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI. The COVID-19 Pandemic Poses a Serious Threat to Public Health and Safety in \nMississippi. \nA. Public Health Impact of COVID-19 \n46. The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is highly contagious and spreads through a \nvariety of means, including respiratory droplets and contact between individuals. Once contracted, \nit can have a range of effects on the diagnosed individual, from recovery without any symptoms \nat all, to flu-like symptoms, to a severe immune system response that can cause fluid to build in \nthe person’s lungs and lead to death.  The disease poses a severe risk to all individuals, particularly \nthose who are either elderly, or, regardless of age, are immunocompromised, or have other \nunderlying conditions like chronic lung disease, diabetes, obesity, or moderate to severe asthma. \n47. Because of the highly contagious and potentially deadly nature of the disease, on \nMarch 13, 2020, President Trump declared a national state of emergency given the widespread \noutbreak of COVID-19.  Within a week, at least 48 states—including Mississippi—had declared \nlocal states of emergency.  \n48. Since then, the coronavirus has continued to spread throughout the United States, \nresulting in a higher number of COVID-19 cases than any other country. At the time of filing of \nthis Complaint, the confirmed number of infections in the United States has surpassed 5.7 million, \nand over 173,000 people have lost their lives nationwide. See Johns Hopkins University & \nMedicine, Coronavirus Resource Center, https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases (last updated \nAugust 26, 2020).  The number of confirmed cases and deaths is likely to be significantly lower \nthan the actual total. \n49. COVID-19  spreads  aggressively,  in  part  because  asymptomatic  and  pre-\nsymptomatic individuals can infect others with whom they come into contact without being aware \n20 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 21 of 58\nthey themselves are infected.  See Furukawa, Brooks & Sobel, Evidence Supporting Transmission \nof Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 While Presymptomatic or Asymptomatic, \nEmerg. Infect. Dis. Vol. 26, No. 7 (May 4, 2020).  Evidence from recent studies indicates that \nbetween 30% and 40% of infected individuals never develop symptoms but can carry as much of \nthe virus and be as contagious as those who do show symptoms—and may remain contagious for \nup to seventeen days after infection.  See Apoorva Mandavilli, Even Asymptomatic People Carry \nthe Coronavirus in High Amounts, N.Y. Times, Aug. 6, 2020.   \n50. There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19, and there will not be a widely \navailable  vaccine  before  the  November  2020  election.    According  to  Food  and  Drug \nAdministration (FDA) vaccine board member Dr. Paul Offit, this unprecedented public health \ncrisis is likely to continue until an effective vaccine is widely available, which is highly unlikely \nuntil 2021.  See Stacey Vanek Smith, FDA Adviser: Not Realistic To Expect A COVID-19 Vaccine \nin  2020,  NPR,  Aug.  5,  2020,  https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-\nupdates/2020/08/05/899411652/fda-adviser-not-realistic-to-expect-a-covid-19-vaccine-in-2020. \n51. There is also no cure for the virus that causes COVID-19, though treatments are \nunder investigation and being used to respond to the crisis on an emergency basis. \n52. Therefore, public health authorities at the federal and state level have made it clear \nthat there is one tool available to avoid infection on an individual level and slow the spread of \nCOVID-19 across a population: social distancing.  “Social distancing” involves avoiding crowds \nand large groups, ensuring at least 6 feet of distance when interacting with people outside one’s \nhousehold, and wearing a mask.  “Social distancing” measures and other guidance provided by \nfederal, state, and local governments have been crucial to slowing the spread and preventing even \nwider infection and death.  Because of the inability to contain the spread of the coronavirus, public \n21 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 22 of 58\nhealth experts predict the US death toll will double between now and the end of 2020, in part due \nto an increased rate of transmission during the fall.

Although COVID-19 has impacted Americans of all ages and backgrounds, public \nhealth experts have warned that it can be particularly dangerous for certain demographic groups, \nincluding older persons, individuals with underlying medical conditions, and people of color.  \n54. Even as coronavirus outbreaks have worsened in Mississippi and other states over \nthe summer, public health experts have warned that cases of COVID-19 may increase significantly \nin the fall and winter. \nB. COVID-19 in Mississippi\n55. Mississippi has seen a surge in infections in recent months.  Mississippi is currently \nconfirming over 1,000 new coronavirus cases and 50 deaths each day.  See Mississippi State \nDepartment  of  Health,  COVID-19  in  Mississippi, \nhttps://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/14,0,420.html#Mississippi (last updated August 23, 2020). \nTo date, the coronavirus has infected more than 79,000 Mississippians and resulted in over 2,300 \ndeaths in the state.  Id. \n56. On April 2, 2020, Governor Reeves rescheduled Mississippi’s special election for \nHouse District 88 from April 21, 2020 to June 23, 2020 to help “to slow the spread of COVID-\n19.”    Press  Release:  Governor  Tate  Reeves  Reschedules  Special  Election  (Apr.  2,  2020), \nhttps:/www.sos.ms.gov/Pages/Governor-Tate-Reeves-Reschedules-Special-Election-for-House-\nDisrict-88.aspx.  In making this announcement, Governor Reeves stated: “The health and well-\n22 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 23 of 58\nbeing of all Mississippians must and always will be our top priority.  We are closer to the beginning \nthan the end of this outbreak and conducting an election at this time would unnecessarily put our \npoll workers and voters at risk.  We must protect our rights as Americans to a free and fair election, \nbut not at the expense of the health and safety of our people.  Stay home, stay healthy.”  Id. \n57. On April 3, 2020, Governor Reeves issued a state-wide “Shelter in Place” stay-at-\nhome order in response to the crisis and urged residents to maintain social distancing to combat \nthe coronavirus’s spread.  State of Mississippi, Office of the Governor, Executive Order Nos. 1466, \n1473.  On April 6, 2020, the Mississippi Department of Public Health adopted guidance from the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) recommending that people wear cloth masks \nand observe social distancing practices in public to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Mississippi \nState  Department  of  Health,  News  Release  (Apr.  6,  2020), \nhttps://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite.index.cfm/23,21953,341,html.  On  April  14,  2020,  Governor \nReeves directed all Mississippi schools to remain closed through the end of the 2019-2020 school \nyear.  Press Release: Governor Tate Reeves Announces Signs Executive Order Closing Schools \nfor Academic Year (Apr. 23, 2020), https://www.sos.ms.gov/Pages/Governor-Tate-Reeves-Signs-\nExecutve-Order-Closing-Schools-for-Academic-Year.aspx. \n58. On April 24, 2020, Governor Reeves signed a Safer At Home Order, encouraging \nresidents to stay home as much as possible, while carefully opening certain Mississippi businesses.  \nState of Mississippi, Office of the Governor, Executive Order Nos. 1477, 1478, 1480, 1484, 1486, \n1487, 1488.  The State of Mississippi then underwent a gradual multi-phase reopening, and on \nMay 28, 2020, the Safer At Home Order was replaced with a Safe Return Order, under which all \nMississippi businesses could reopen, but which advised residents at heightened risk of infection \nand death to continue sheltering in place to protect their health.  This includes all elderly \n23 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 24 of 58\nindividuals (age 65 or older) and individuals “with serious underlying health conditions, including \nhigh blood pressure, chronic lung disease, diabetes, obesity, asthma, and those whose immune \nsystems are compromised as such by chemotherapy for cancer or any other condition requiring \nsuch  therapy.”    State  of  Mississippi,  Office  of  the  Governor,  Executive  Order  No.  1492, \nhttps://www.sos.ms.gov/Education-Publications/Pages/Executive-Orders.aspx. \n59. Although Governor Reeves provided guidance permitting Mississippi businesses \nto begin reopening on April 24, 2020, government offices—including the Office of the Secretary \nof State—remained closed to the public for safety reasons.  The Secretary of State’s office \nremained closed until June 15, 2020 “[i]n an effort to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.”  \nPress Release: Secretary of State’s Office Buildings Temporarily Closed To The Public (March \n17, 2020), https://www.sos.ms.gov/About/Pages/Press-Release.aspx?pr=1101.  Since reopening, \nthe Secretary of State’s Office “strongly encourage[s] visitors to make every effort to conduct SOS \nbusiness online or over the phone” to limit the number of people in the office.  Press Release: \nSecretary  of  State’s  Office  Set  to  Reopen  to  the  Public  Monday  (June  11,  2020), \nhttps://www.sos.ms.gov/About/Pages/Press-Release.aspx?pr=1107. \n60. Despite these efforts, the number of cases of COVID-19 in Mississippi continues \nto rise substantially.  Since issuing the Safe Return Order on April 24, 2020, Governor Reeves has \namended and extended the Order eight times (June 10, June 28, July 2, July 19, July 24, July 30, \nand August 14).  Executive Order 1518, currently in effect until Monday, August 31 at 8:00am, \nextends the face covering requirement established in Executive Order 1516 for Mississippians \n“inside a business, school or other building or space open to the public, or when in an outdoor \npublic space whenever it is not possible to maintain a minimum of six feet of social distancing \nfrom another person not in the same household.”  State of Mississippi, Office of the Governor, \n24 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 25 of 58\nExecutive Order Nos. 1516, 1518.  Executive Order 1518 notes that the “key to reducing the \ncommunity transmission of COVID-19” and keeping Mississippi schools open is to “consistently \nwear a face covering while in public spaces, to practice social distancing from persons not in the \nsame household and to maintain good hand hygiene.”  State of Mississippi, Office of the Governor, \nExecutive  Order  No.  1518, \nhttps://www.sos.ms.gov/content/executiveorders/ExecutiveOrders/1518.pdf.  \n61.  Infections in Mississippi have exploded through August, with the state on pace to \nexceed the number of deaths reported in July, the deadliest month since COVID-19 rapidly \nincreased nationwide in March.  Through Thursday, August 13, the Mississippi Department of \nHealth reported 530 deaths this month alone from COVID-19.  Magnolia State Live, Bump in \nCurve:  Mississippi’s  New  Coronavirus  Averages  Creep  Back  Up  (August  20,  2020), \nhttps://www.magnoliastatelive.com/2020/08/20/bump-in-curve-mississippis-new-coronavirus-\naverages-creep-back-up/.  Researchers from Johns Hopkins University indicate that Mississippi’s \nmost recent seven-day moving positive rate was around 20%.  Jimmie E.

The current rate of spread and the lack of imposition \nof more restrictive control measures suggest it is highly unlikely the situation will improve \nsignificantly prior to November 2020, and is likely to actually worsen through the fall as schools \ncontinue to reopen and COVID-19 overlaps with the typical flu season.

Mississippi’s Absentee Voting Procedures Significantly Burden the Fundamental \nRight to Vote and Deny Voters’ Due Process Rights. \nA. Mississippi’s Absentee Ballot Requirements \n62. Mississippi is an excuse-required absentee voting state.  Mississippi law only \nallows specific categories of voters with qualifying excuses to vote by absentee ballot.  Unless \nMississippi voters satisfy one of the enumerated excuses, they must either vote in person in the \nupcoming elections, or not vote at all.  \n63. The excuses permitted by law include: (1) the voter’s studies or employment at a \nschool necessitates their absence from the county on Election Day; (2) the voter is an employee of \na member of the Mississippi congressional delegation or a spouse or dependent of the employee \nresiding with the absentee voter away from their county of residence; (3) the voter is outside of \nthe county of residence on Election Day for any reason; (4) the voter has a temporary or permanent \nphysical disability and who, because of such disability, is unable to vote in person without \nsubstantial hardship to himself or others, or whose attendance at the voting place could reasonably \ncause danger to himself or others; (5) the voter is the parent, spouse, or dependent of a person with \na temporary or permanent physical disability who is hospitalized outside the county of residence \nor more than fifty (50) miles away from his residence and the voter will be with such person on \nElection Day; (6) the voter is sixty-five (65) years of age or older; (7) the voter is a member of the \nMississippi congressional delegation absent from Mississippi on Election Day, or the spouse or \ndependents of the member of the congressional delegation; or (8) the voter is required to be at \nwork on Election Day during the times at which the polls will be open.  Miss. Code Ann. § 23-15-\n713. \n64. Governor Reeves recently signed into law amendments to Mississippi’s Excuse \nRequirement under HB 1521, which explicitly defined an existing excuse to include voters under \n26 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 27 of 58\n“a physician-imposed quarantine due to COVID-19 during the year 2020” or “caring for a \ndependent who is under physician-imposed quarantine due to COVID-19” within the existing \ntemporary or permanent physical disability excuse.  The terms “physician-imposed quarantine”, \n“caring for”, and “dependent” are not defined.   \n65. To vote by absentee ballot, a voter may make a request for an absentee application \norally, in writing, or by calling the circuit clerk’s office.  Miss. Code Ann. §§ 23-15-627, 23-15-\n657. \n66. The absentee ballot application includes a warning in boldface that making a “false \nstatement” on an absentee ballot application and selling one’s vote is punishable with a fine of up \nto $5,000 and a state prison sentence of up to five years.  Miss. Code Ann. § 23-15-627. \n67. The application requires all applicants, except those who are “temporarily or \npermanently disabled” to have their application “notarized or signed by an official authorized to \nadminister oaths for absentee balloting.”  Miss. Code Ann. § 23-15-627.  Both notarization and \nofficials’  attestation  are  typically  conducted  in-person,  requiring  close  contact  between  the \nindividual receiving the notarization and the Notary. \n68. Once a request is made for an absentee ballot application, the county clerk can mail \nthe application to the voter if the voter cannot appear at the clerk’s office to complete the \napplication in person.  Miss. Code Ann. § 23-15-715(a)-(b). \n69. After receiving a properly completed and notarized absentee ballot application, “the \nregistrar shall send to such absent voter a proper absentee voter ballot within twenty-four (24) \nhours” of having received a notarized application, or “as soon thereafter as the ballots are \navailable.”  Miss. Code Ann. § 23-15-715(a).  The voter must then find a “postmaster,” “postal \n27 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 28 of 58\nsupervisor,” or “other officer having authority to administer an oath” to act as a witness and watch \nthem complete the ballot envelope.  Miss. Code Ann. § 23-15-631. \n70. Eligible absentee voters under the temporary or permanent physical disability must \nhave a witness eighteen (18) years of age or older sign both their absentee ballot application and \nballot envelope.  Miss. Code Ann. §§ 23-15-627, 23-15-631(1).  \nB. Voting in Person Imposes a Significant Burden on Mississippi Voters During \nthe COVID-19 Pandemic. \n71. Historically, most voters in Mississippi must vote in person on Election Day \nbecause the ability to vote by absentee ballot is limited to the narrow excuses in the statute.  For \nmost voters, this means physically appearing at a designated polling place where they must not \nonly be in close contact with other voters, observers, and poll workers, but must also repeatedly \ntouch  equipment  and  materials  such  as  voting  machines,  paper  ballots,  and  shared  writing \ninstruments.  At present, public health officials consider all these activities as risking exposure to \nthe transmission of COVID-19.  Ctrs. for Disease Control and Prevention, Considerations for \nElection  Polling  Locations  (June  22,  2020),  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/community/election-polling-locations.html.  The ongoing health risks posed by COVID-19 \nnecessitate expanded absentee ballot access that would prevent thousands of individuals from \nlining up with other voters at polling places (sometimes for hours), touching the same equipment, \nhaving face-to-face interactions with poll workers, and threatening their own health and the health \nof others.   \n72. Meaningful opportunities to vote in person are still necessary for many Mississippi \nvoters,  including  those  who  lack  access  to  reliable  mail  service  or  need  the  kinds  of \naccommodations that are only available at in-person sites, such as persons with disabilities and \npeople with limited literacy.   \n28 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 29 of 58\n73. To reduce the risk that individuals who need to vote in person will be exposed to \nCOVID-19, the CDC’s Considerations for Election Polling Locations report provides specific \nguidelines for voting during the COVID-19 pandemic, which recommends that states “[e]ncourage \nvoters to use voting methods that minimize direct contact with other people and reduce crowd size \nat polling stations,” including “mail-in methods of voting” like absentee voting.  Ctrs. for Disease \nControl & Prevention, Considerations for Election Polling Locations (updated June 22, 2020), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/election-polling-locations.html.  These \nare essential recommendations, especially because the risks of voting absentee are minimal. \n74. Most  states  have  already  entirely  eliminated  any  excuse  requirement  to  vote \nabsentee, even when their voters are not threatened by a public health crisis.1  Kate Rabinowitz \nand Brittany Renee Mayes, Washington Post, At Least 76% of American Voters Can Cast Ballots \nby  Mail  in  the  Fall (August  13,  2020), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/vote-by-mail-states/.  Other states, that \nin normal circumstances maintain similarly limited eligibility requirements for voting absentee, \nhave recognized that the extraordinary circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic require \nloosening such requirements.  Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and \nWest Virginia have all agreed to permit any voter to use COVID-19 as a valid excuse for requesting \nto vote absentee at least through the November general election.2\n1 National Conference of State Legislatures, Voting Outside the Polling Place: Absentee, All-Mail \nand other Voting at Home Options (July 10, 2020), https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-\ncampaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx (34 states and Washington, D.C., offer “no-excuse” \nabsentee/mailed ballot voting). \n2 See Ala.

Over the past three months, COVID-19 has spread throughout Mississippi at a rapid \npace—a trend experts say is unlikely to reverse—and may worsen—before the November election.  \nBecause as many as 40% of infected individuals never show symptoms—and yet can be just as \ncontagious, for up to two weeks after infection, see infra (cid:4161)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:23)(cid:3)(cid:178)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:68)(cid:69)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)\nvoters and poll workers will be present at in-person voting sites on November 3, creating an \ninfection risk for others. \n76. Because of these continued risks, many Mississippians—like Plaintiffs and the \nOrganizational Plaintiffs’ members—who would otherwise vote in person on Election Day will \nreasonably opt and/or be required to stay home and continue practicing social distancing for the \nforeseeable future, even after the peak of the current outbreak of COVID-19 in Mississippi.  They \nwill want to vote by mail.  \n77. Evidence of the health risks associated with in-person voting is unfortunately \naccumulating during this election season.  Multiple Florida poll workers tested positive for \nCOVID-19 in the aftermath of the in-person primary election on March 17, 2020 long before \nCOVID-19 was widespread in Florida and nationwide, leaving election officials to contact voters \nwho had voted at those locations and warn them they were at risk.

Chicago election officials reported that a poll worker for the city’s March 17, 2020 \nelection died of COVID-19, prompting officials to send letters notifying voters, poll workers, field \ninvestigators, and cartage companies who were present at the same polling site.  Mary Ann Ahern, \nPoll Worker at Chicago Voting Site Dies of Coronavirus, Election Officials Say, 5 Chicago, Apr. \n13,  2020,  https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicago-politics/poll-worker-at-chicago-\nvoting-site-dies-of-coronavirus-election-officials-say/2255072/.  Wisconsin officials reported 71 \nvoters contracted COVID-19 after voting in person in their April 7, 2020 election.  Poll workers \nhave tested positive after elections in other states including Alabama, Texas, and Pennsylvania.3\n78. CDC guidance on safe voting practices advises that “[t]he more an individual \ninteracts with others, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread” and \n“elections with only in-person voting on a single day are higher risk for COVID-19 spread because \nthere will be larger crowds and longer wait times.”  Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, \nConsiderations  for  Election  Polling  Locations:  Interim  Guidance  to  Prevent  Spread  of \nCoronavirus  Disease  2019  (COVID-19),  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/community/election-polling-locations.html (last updated June 22, 2020).  Accordingly, the \nCDC recommends “lower risk” election polling settings, including “a wide variety of voting \noptions”; “longer voting periods (more days and/or more hours)”; and “any other feasible options \nfor reducing the number of voters who congregate indoors in polling locations at the same time.”  \nId.\n3 See Eddie Burkhalter, Piedmont Poll Worker in Tuesday’s Runoff Tests Positive for COVID-19, \nHospitalized, Alabama Political Reporter (July 20, 2020); Tommy Witherspoon, Election \nWorkers Come Down With COVID-19 as Numbers Continue to Rise, Waco Tribune-Herald (July \n20, 2020); Katie Meyer & Emily Previti, A Philly Poll Watcher Got COVID-19, But The City \nIsn’t Notifying Voters, WHYY (June 24, 2020). \n31 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 32 of 58\n1. Voters with Underlying Medical Conditions & Their Loved Ones\n79. The CDC has warned that “people of any age who have certain underlying medical \nconditions are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19” and has identified certain \nconditions that are likely to exacerbate the impact of COVID-19, including asthma, chronic lung \ndisease, diabetes, serious heart conditions, chronic kidney disease being treated with dialysis, \nsevere  obesity,  liver  disease,  immune  deficiencies,  and  a  myriad  of  other  conditions  that \ncompromise an individual’s immune system.  Ctrs. for Disease Control and Prevention, People \nwith  Certain  Medical  Conditions (last  updated  July  30,  2020), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-\nconditions.html.  Plaintiffs Goggin and Parham, and some Organizational Plaintiffs’ members \nsuffer from one or more of these underlying medical conditions that increase their risk of serious \nillness and death from COVID-19.  Plaintiff Oppenheim lives with his wife and regularly interacts \nwith his mother-in-law, both of whom are high-risk for severe complications and potentially death \nif they contract coronavirus.  \n80. Because of these increased risks to their health and safety, Mississippi voters with \nany of these conditions—and their loved ones—would face especially significant burdens if forced \nto choose between potential exposure to COVID-19 and their fundamental right to vote. \n2. Black Voters \n81. Defendants’  application  of  the  current  Excuse  Requirement  and  Notarization \nRequirement during the COVID-19 pandemic also places a significant burden on Black voters, \nwho face heightened risks from exposure to COVID-19 because of well-documented disparities in \nhealth and health care that put them at higher risk for COVID-19 at every step of the process. \n32 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 33 of 58\n82. First, Black voters face a greater risk of contracting coronavirus on their way to the \npolls due to increased reliance on public transportation.  Black Americans are less likely to own \ncars than any other demographic of Americans, and they “represent about one-quarter of all public \ntransit  users.”    Rashawn  Ray,  Why  Are  Blacks  Dying  at  Higher  Rates  from  COVID-19?, \nBrookings,  Apr.  9,  2020,  https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/04/09/why-are-blacks-\ndying-at-higher-rates-from-covid-19.  Black voters without access to private transportation face \nadditional risks of contact with exposed individuals in close quarters on public transportation en \nroute to their polling places.  \n83. Second, Black voters are disproportionately burdened by long lines at the polls.  \nMaintaining the Excuse Requirement may result in closed polling places because of poll worker \nshortages which will result in longer lines with an inability to practice adequate social distancing.  \nFor Black voters, these problems are exacerbated by existing racial disparities in wait times: a \nrecent study based on data frommillions of smartphone users during the 2016 presidential election \nfound that residents of entirely-Black neighborhoods waited 29% longer to vote and were 74% \nmore likely to spend more than 30 minutes at their polling place than residents of all-white \nneighborhoods.4  And Black voters can least afford unnecessarily long wait times as the price to \npay for voting because Black people are “more likely to be working in jobs without flexibility or \npaid sick leave,” which means any delays at the polls disproportionately threaten their job \nsecurity.5\n4 M. Keith Chen, et al., Racial Disparities in Voting Wait Times: Evidence from Smartphone \nData (Nov. 14, 2019), \nhttps://www.kareemhaggag.com/f/Racial_Disparities_in_Voting_Wait_Times.pdf. \n5 Demos, How to Build a Racially Inclusive Democracy During COVID-19 and Beyond (Apr. 28, \n2020), https://www.demos.org/policy-briefs/how-build-racially-inclusive-democracy-during-\ncovid-19-and-beyond. \n33 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 34 of 58\n84. Third,  if  Black  voters  contract  coronavirus  while  voting  in  person  or  while \nobtaining a notary or authorized official’s attestation, they are more likely to suffer serious and \neven deadly consequences because they disproportionately suffer from the underlying medical \nconditions that exacerbate COVID-19.  Decades of research, statements from public health experts, \nand data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services all reflect that Black Americans \nhave disproportionately high rates of asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity.  The CDC \nand other reports have cited racial disparities in these underlying medical conditions as a factor \nthat influences the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on the Black community.  \n85. Fourth, if Black voters contract coronavirus while voting in person or obtaining \nnotarization  or  attestation  for  absentee  voting,  they  are  also  more  likely  to  suffer  serious \nconsequences because of inequalities in our health care system.  Studies conducted by the \nAmerican Journal of Public Health, The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other \norganizations over the past few decades indicate that Black people are less likely to have insurance \nand access to affordable medical testing.  See also Karen Bascom, University of Mississippi \nMedical Center, COVID-19 Impacts Black Communities More Heavily, Study Shows (May 7, \n2020),  https://www.umc.edu/news/News_Articles/2020/05/COVID-19-impacts-black-\ncommunities-more-heavily.html.  The CDC has cited “barriers to getting health care,” including \nlack of health insurance coverage, as one factor that “might make members of many racial and \nethnic minority groups especially vulnerable in public health emergencies like outbreaks of \nCOVID-19.”  Additionally, according to a U.S. News & World Report article, “African Americans \nare more likely than whites to rely on hospital emergency rooms for primary care – departments \nthat soon may be overwhelmed with anticipated surges of COVID-19 patients.”  Joseph P. \nWilliams, Rumor, Disparity and Distrust: Why Black Americans Face an Uphill Battle Against \n34 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 35 of 58\nCOVID-19, U.S.  News  and  World  Report, Mar.  25,  2020, \nhttps://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2020-03-25/why-black-\namericans-face-an-uphill-battle-against-the-coronavirus.  Some studies have shown that, even \nwhen Black people can obtain health care, it is of disparate quality compared to non-Black people.\n86. Fifth, if Black voters contract coronavirus while voting in person or obtaining \nnotarization or attestation for an absentee ballot, they also face increased risks of spreading \ncoronavirus to their loved ones and community.  See Karen Bascom, University of Mississippi \nMedical Center, COVID-19 Impacts Black Communities More Heavily, Study Shows (May 7, \n2020),  https://www.umc.edu/news/News_Articles/2020/05/COVID-19-impacts-black-\ncommunities-more-heavily.html.  As discussed above, Black voters are more likely to rely on \npublic transportation, and Black voters are more likely to live in “subpar neighborhoods [that] are \nrooted in the historical legacy of redlining” and in “densely populated areas, further heightening \ntheir potential contact with other people.” Rashawn Ray, Why Are Blacks Dying at Higher Rates \nfrom  COVID-19?,  Brookings,  Apr.  9,  2020, \nhttps://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/04/09/why-are-blacks-dying-at-higher-rates-from-\ncovid-19.\n87. These systemic failures help to explain why COVID-19 is currently ravaging Black \ncommunities in Mississippi and nationwide.  As the CDC has noted, “[h]istory shows that severe \nillness and death rates tend to be higher for racial and ethnic minority groups during public health \nemergencies,” and COVID-19 data demonstrates that the same is true of the current pandemic.  \nDemographic data reported by the CDC on the number of COVID-19 cases for which race was \navailable nationwide (48% of the 4,028,586 cases analyzed) shows that Black people make up \n19.8% of the reported COVID-19 cases although they only make up 13.4% of the total U.S. \n35 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 36 of 58\npopulation.  Although only 37.8% of the Mississippi population is Black, the Mississippi State \nDepartment of Health reports that 49.5% of Mississippians who have died from COVID-19 have \nbeen Black.  Out of the total persons infected with COVID-19 in Mississippi, 51.8% are Black. \nMississippi State Department of Health, COVID-19 Deaths by Race/Ethnicity through August 23, \n2020,  Mississippi  (last  updated  August  23,  2020),  \nhttps://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/14,21995,420,873.html.\n88. These risks, both individually and collectively, demonstrate that in-person voting \nand the requirement of obtaining a witness attestation or notary for an absentee ballot imposes an \nespecially significant and life-threatening burden on Black voters, including Plaintiff Parham and \nmany of MS NAACP’s members.  \n3. Older Voters \n89. Mississippi’s current Excuse Requirement will disproportionately burden older \nvoters and poll workers, who face heightened risks from contracting the coronavirus. \n90. If older voters contract the coronavirus while voting in person or while obtaining \nnotarization or attestation for an absentee ballot, they are more likely to suffer serious and even \ndeadly consequences. The CDC has warned that “[p]eople aged 65 years and older” are at higher \nrisk for severe illness and death from COVID-19 because “[t]he immune systems of older adults \nweaken with age, making it harder to fight off infections,” and “older adults commonly have \nchronic diseases that can increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19.”  Thus, “the older \nyou are, the higher your risk of serious disease.” \n91. Plaintiff Goggin and many members of the Organizational Plaintiffs are 65 or older \nand therefore have an increased risk of serious illness from COVID-19.   \n36 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 37 of 58\n92. COVID-19  is  already  having  a  devastating  impact  on  elderly  individuals  in \nMississippi.  More than 37% of Mississippians who have contracted COVID-19 are ages 50 and \nolder, and that same age group represents over 93% of Mississippi’s confirmed deaths.  Mississippi \nDepartment of Health, COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Age Group through August 24, 2020,\nhttps://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/14,0,420.html#map (last updated Aug. 24, 2020). \n93. If older voters contract the coronavirus while voting in person or while obtaining a \nnotary or oath attestation for absentee voting, they also face increased risks of spreading the \ncoronavirus to their loved ones and community, because they are more likely to require in-person \ncare or assistance.  The CDC has warned that the “communal nature of nursing homes and long-\nterm care facilities, and the population served (generally older adults often with underlying \nmedical conditions), put those living in nursing homes at higher risk of infection and severe illness \nfrom COVID-19.”  The impact of COVID-19 in Mississippi nursing homes serves as a stark \nexample: to date, there are 173 active outbreaks in Mississippi’s long-term care facilities, where \none or more resident or staff member has been infected.  Mississippi State Department of Health, \nLTCF  Cases  and  Deaths  Among  Residents  by  County  and  Race,\nhttps://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/resources/8578.pdf (last updated Aug. 24, 2020).  Over 41% \nof deaths in Mississippi are residents of long-term care facilities.  See Id.; Mississippi State \nDepartment  of  Health,  Mississippi  COVID-19  Cases  and  Deaths  by  Race  with  Ethnicity, \nhttps://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/14,21882,420,873.html (last updated Aug. 24, 2020). \n94. These same risks will also impact many older poll workers, who make up a large \nproportion of election officials.  A Pew Research report notes that, “[i]n the 2018 general election, \naround six-in-ten U.S. poll workers (58%) were ages 61 and older, including roughly a quarter \n(27%) who were over 70.”  Michael Barthiel and Galen Stocking, Pew Research Center, Older \n37 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 38 of 58\nPeople Account for Large Shares of Poll Workers and Voters in U.S. General Elections (April 6, \n2020), https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/06/older-people-account-for-large-shares-\nof-poll-workers-and-voters-in-u-s-general-elections/. \n4. Voters with Disabilities \n95. Mississippi’s current Excuse Requirement will disproportionately burden voters \nwith certain disabilities, especially those who need to vote in person during the COVID-19 \npandemic. \n96. Voters with certain disabilities face a significant risk of contracting coronavirus and \nexposing themselves to COVID-19 at the polls or on their way to polling locations.  According to \nthe CDC and Pew Trusts, “[m]any people with disabilities cannot mark paper ballots without \nassistance, so they rely on special voting machines” with features like touch screens, other manual \ninput devices, and earphones to vote, any of which could carry the coronavirus from previous users \nand poll workers.  Additionally, social distancing practices are more difficult for voters with \ncertain disabilities—for example, voters who are blind or have limited vision cannot see visual \nmarkers on the ground instructing voters to line up six feet apart from each other.   \n97. These difficulties are compounded by the fact that an inability to use paper ballots \nwithout assistance forecloses many voters with disabilities from voting by mail.  Because many \nvoters  with  disabilities  are  unable  to  submit  mail-in  absentee  ballots  without  assistance  or \naccommodations, they will continue to need to vote in person during the COVID-19 pandemic, \ndespite the risks posed by in-person voting. \n98. In addition to significantly burdening voters with disabilities who need to vote in \nperson  in  the  general  election  in  November  2020,  Mississippi’s  application  of  the  Excuse \nRequirement will likely dissuade some voters with disabilities from voting altogether, such as \n38 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 39 of 58\npeople whose disabilities serve as comorbidities for COVID-19, people whose disabilities make \nsocial distancing more difficult, and people whose physical disabilities make them unable to stand \nin long lines at the polls. \n99. The state has already determined that some voters can vote absentee and has \nexplicitly defined an existing excuse to include some voters impacted by COVID-19, conceding \nthat current pandemic conditions require a modification of existing restrictions on absentee by mail \nvoting.  Mississippi law provides many safeguards that protect the integrity of the absentee ballot \nprocess—voters must sign their absentee ballot application under penalty of perjury and include \neither the last four digits of their social security number or full driver’s license number before \nreceiving an absentee ballot.  Once received, voters must also sign their absentee ballot envelope \nunder penalty of perjury, which may be subject to challenge as with ballots cast in-person on \nelection day.  \nC. State and County Officials Have Created Confusion as to the Eligibility to Vote \nby Mail During the COVID-19 Pandemic, Burdening Voters.  \n100. Prior to the passage of HB 1521, Defendant Watson stated that circuit clerks had \ndiscretion to allow people to vote early for fear of COVID-19 under existing law, specifically, \nsection 23-15-713(d) of the Mississippi Code.  Bobby Harrison, Secretary of State Says Existing \nLaw  Allows  Mail-in  Voting  Expansion  During  Coronavirus  Pandemic.  Is  that  Enough?, \nMississippi Today, June 3, 2020, https://mississippitoday.org/2020/06/03/secretary-of-state-says-\nexisting-law-allows-mail-in-voting-expansion-during-coronavirus-pandemic-is-that-enough/.  \nDefendant Watson’s position is in accord with the “temporary disability” provision of the Excuse \nRequirement. \n101. Despite the plain language of section 23-15-713(d), the legislature passed HB 1521 \nthat was intended to broaden the category of people who were eligible to vote absentee. \n39 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 40 of 58\n102. In June 28, 2020 floor testimony before the Mississippi House of Representatives \nin connection with the passage of HB 1521, Mississippi legislators indicated that if a voter “ha[s] \nsymptoms [of COVID-19] but you have not been to a doctor, currently the department of Health \nand physicians are telling you to stay home and self-quarantine, that would count,” and that the \nstandard would be applied across the state.  This position is in accord with the “temporary \ndisability” provision of the Excuse Requirement found in section 23-15-713(d) of the Mississippi \nCode. \n103. HB 1521, which explicitly allows people to vote absentee if they or those they are \ncaring for are under “physician-imposed quarantine,”  provides no definition for “physician-\nimposed  quarantine,”  “caring  for,”  or  “dependent”  in  the  temporary  or  permanent  physical \ndisability excuse under Mississippi law.  Without clarification, the application of this excuse in \nconjunction with existing Mississippi absentee ballot law leaves voters uncertain of their ability to \nvote  absentee.    Defendant  Watson  has  requested  an  official  opinion  from  Defendant  Fitch \nregarding the definition of “physician-imposed quarantine,” and whether the qualifying language \nin Section 23-15-713(d) eliminates circuit clerks’ ability to determine what is a “temporary \ndisability” under Mississippi law.  Bobby Harrison, Watson Asking Attorney General Whether \nMississippi Legislature Made it Harder to Vote in Pandemic, Mississippi Today, July 20, 2020, \nhttps://mississippitoday.org/2020/07/20/watson-asking-attorney-general-whether-mississippi-\nlegislature-made-it-harder-to-vote-in-pandemic/.  \n104. Despite the existing “temporary disability” excuse and the explicit “physician-\nordered  quarantine”  excuse,  Governor  Reeves  stated  in  an  August  16,  2020  interview  that \nMississippi would not allow “someone who’s  afraid of their health, someone with asthma, \nsomeone with diabetes, someone who’s overweight to send in their ballot by mail” to send in an \n40 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 41 of 58\nabsentee ballot by mail “unless they legally qualify for an absentee ballot—which is certainly \nallowable under Mississippi state statute.”  When asked why not allow these voters to qualify based \non comorbidities or the fear of contracting the coronavirus, Governor Reeves indicated that this \n“is not what Mississippi state statute allows for.”  Interview with Governor Tate Reeves, Face the \nNation (August 16, 2020), https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-governor-tate-reeves-on-\nface-the-nation-august-16-2020/.  \n105. In Mississippi’s 82 counties, circuit court clerks serve as the registrars, and it is \ntheir responsibility to print and provide applications for absentee ballots.  See Miss. Code Ann. § \n23-15-625.  In response to a public records request regarding guidance received from Defendant \nWatson, 27 circuit clerks representing 30 districts replied that the Secretary of State has yet to \npromulgate policies specifically outlining COVID-19 procedures for absentee voting for the \nNovember election.  Circuit clerks in various counties are unsure of the procedures under the \nExcuse Requirement and are providing differing guidance to voters across counties.  See Anna \nKate Doiron, Requirements to Vote Absentee in the Upcoming General Election Still Undecided, \nThe Vicksburg Press, Aug. 18, 2020, https://www.vicksburgpost.com/2020/08/18/requirements-\nto-vote-absentee-in-the-upcoming-general-election-still-undecided/.\n106. The  conflicting  public  information  as  to  the  applicability  of  the  Excuse \nRequirement and Defendant Watson’s failure to clarify the situation has led to confusion among \nvoters and has imposed and will continue to impose substantial burdens on voters, including \nPlaintiffs Parham, Oppenheim, and LWVMS’s and MS NAACP’s members. \n107. Reflecting this confusion, Mississippi voters in Oppenheim, et. al. v. Watson, et. \nal., Case No. 25CH1:20-cv-961, filed a declaratory action on August 11, 2020 in state court \nseeking the meaning of Section 23-15-713(d) in the context of the challenges posed by the COVID-\n41 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 42 of 58\n19 pandemic.  The Oppenheim Plaintiffs assert that under this Section, absentee voting should be \navailable to any voters with health conditions that put them at higher risk of severe illness or death; \nany voters who want “to avoid voting in-person at a polling place due to guidance from the MDH \n[Mississippi  State  Department  of  Health],  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention \n(“CDC”), or other physicians or public health authorities to avoid unnecessary public gatherings \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic;” and any voters “caring for or supporting” voters with pre-\nexisting conditions.  Oppenheim,Case No. 25CH1:20-cv-961, Compl. at 31. \n108. The failure of Defendant Watson to definitively advise voters that they will be able \nto vote absentee if they reasonably fear risking contracting coronavirus and exposing themselves \nto COVID-19 by voting in person unconstitutionally burdens the right to vote because voters are \nplaced in the untenable position of having to choose between (1) voting in person and risking their \nhealth; (2) voting absentee and risking prosecution and; (3) not voting at all.   \nD. The  Notarization  Requirement  Significantly  Burdens  Mississippi  Voters \nWithout Meaningfully Advancing Any Valid State Interest. \n109. Fulfilling Mississippi’s Notarization Requirement for mail-in absentee ballots and \napplications brings its own life-threatening risks during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for \nthose with underlying health conditions.  Voters will have to leave their homes to obtain the \nrequired attestation or notarization on their absentee ballot application and to complete their \nabsentee ballot in front of an authorized witness.  See Miss. Code Ann. §§ 23-15-631, 23-15-627.   \n110. Although Governor Reeves permitted remote notarization for the duration of the \nState of Emergency in Mississippi, he has not reauthorized such remote notarization.  Even if he \nshould reauthorize it, though, this process does not resolve the risks created by the Notarization \nRequirement  because  it  comes  with  its  own  onerous  requirements  and  cannot  be  used  for \nnotarizing the absentee ballot.   \n42 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 43 of 58\n111. To use remote notarization for the absentee ballot application, a voter must have \naccess to video-call technology.  This requires sufficiently high-speed internet access and a device \nwith videoconference capabilities, to which many voters may not have access.  Further, Mississippi \nhas one of highest rates of households without internet access in the United States, and as of 2017, \n26.2% of Mississippians do not have access to the internet at home.  Even if voters have access to \nthe technology to use remote notarization, they must then obtain postage and envelopes and mail \nthe absentee application to the notary public for their official stamp and seal before mailing it back \nto the registrar.  Worse yet, the Governor’s prior Executive Order permitted notaries to charge up \nto $30.00 for performing remote notarization.  Given the lack of guidance regarding the actual cost \nof remote notarization, voters may be dissuaded from absentee voting due to uncertain costs and \neconomic constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.   \n112. Remote notarization does not resolve the problems created by the notarization \nrequirement.  The voter must physically sign their absentee ballot envelope in front of a notary, \nwho must also sign the absentee ballot envelope.  Because the absentee ballot envelope must be \npresent for notarization, the voter must also be present, defeating the benefit of remote notarization \nfor absentee voters.  \n113. Additionally, the United States Postal Service announced on August 18, 2020 that \npostal employees are prohibited from serving as witnesses on voters’ absentee ballots while on \nduty.  James Brooks, In Rule Change, Postal Service Forbids Employees from Signing Absentee \nBallots  as  Witnesses,  Anchorage  Daily  News,  Aug.  18,  2020, \nhttps://www.adn.com/politics/2020/08/18/in-rule-change-postal-service-forbids-employees-\nfrom-signing-absentee-ballots-as-witnesses/.  This restriction limits voters’ ability to comply with \nthe Notarization Requirement.   \n43 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 44 of 58\n114. Thus, in the middle of a pandemic, voters must choose between entering public \nestablishments and coming into face-to-face contact with notaries or authorized officials to obtain \nsignatures at least twice and losing the “precious” and “fundamental” right to vote.  Harper v. Va. \nState Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 670 (1966).  \n115. Mississippi’s Notarization Requirement will impose substantial burdens on a broad \ncross-section of the public, including but not limited to voters who have a heightened risk of \nsuffering from COVID-19 like Plaintiff Goggin; voters who live with, care for, or work with \nindividuals who have a heightened risk of suffering from COVID-19; and notaries and other \nofficials authorized to administer oaths.  The Notarization Requirement also burdens voters who \nare asymptomatic or fear contracting the coronavirus. \n116. Even though the “Safer at Home” order has been lifted, the public health crisis—\nand  the  corresponding  risks  to  voters—remains.    The  significant  burden  imposed  by  the \nNotarization Requirement is evident when compared with current CDC guidelines for elections.  \nThe CDC has recommended that election officials “offer alternative voting methods that minimize \ndirect contact and reduce crowd size at polling locations.”  Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, \nConsiderations  for  Election  Polling  Locations:  Interim  Guidance  to  Prevent  Spread  of \nCoronavirus  Disease  2019  (COVID-19),  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/community/election-polling-locations.html (last updated June 22, 2020).  But Mississippi’s \nabsentee voting laws do the exact opposite—they necessitate hazardous direct contact in public \nspaces to obtain a notary seal or attestation signature two times in the process of obtaining and \ncasting an absentee ballot.   \n117. Mississippi’s Notarization Requirement for absentee ballot applications and ballots \nis unrelated to any valid state interest.   \n44 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 45 of 58\n118. Mississippi utilizes other mechanisms that preclude claims that this requirement \nprevents voter fraud or safeguards voter confidence.  Voters must include identifying information \nsuch as the last four digits of their social security number or their driver’s license number on their \nabsentee ballot application.  Voters must also sign both their absentee ballot application and ballot \nenvelope under penalty of perjury, and their ballots are subject to challenge as with in-person \nvoting.  Furthermore, the absentee voting structure indicates that notarization of absentee ballots \nis not necessary for verification purposes, as absentee voters eligible under the temporary or \npermanent physical disability excuse are simply required to have an adult eighteen (18) years or \nolder witness their application and ballot. \nE. The  Cure  Prohibition  Significantly  Burdens  Mississippi  Voters  Without \nMeaningfully Advancing Any Valid State Interest and Violates Voters’ Due \nProcess Rights. \n119. In addition, Mississippi statute requires signature matching between the signatures \non a voter’s absentee application and the signature on the voter’s absentee ballot envelope for \nabsentee by mail ballots.  Specifically, Mississippi statute requires that: “The signature on the \napplication . . . be compared with the signature on the back of the envelope.”  Miss. Code Ann. \n§ 23-15-639.  If the signatures are found not to match, Mississippi election officials are required \nto reject the ballot outright.  Miss. Code Ann. § 23-15-641.  There is no provision of Mississippi \nlaw that provide for notice of or any opportunity to cure signature deficiencies prior to rejection of \nthe ballot.  \n120. Signature matching is a notoriously inaccurate method of verifying an individual’s \nidentity.  Handwriting analysis requires controlled conditions and significant, rigorous training to \nbe performed without excessive error.  Election officials are not trained forensic scientists, and \n45 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 46 of 58\nresearch suggests that election officials are prone to deciding in error that authentic voter signatures \ndo not match signatures on file with local election boards.  \n121. As part of this signature-comparison process, Mississippi gives broad authority to \nelection officials to challenge absentee ballots because of a mismatched signature but prescribes \nno process for doing so.  Neither the Mississippi Code, nor the County Election Manual specifies \nthe number of poll managers who must or may review any given ballot.  This lack of uniform \nprocess means that a Mississippi voter might be disenfranchised based on a handwriting analysis \nperformed by a single precinct official, decided according to that official’s subjective opinion, and \ngiven no further review.  Mississippi law also provides no meaningful guidance on what it means \nfor an official to “compare” the signatures on a ballot envelope and absentee ballot application.  \nMississippi Secretary of State, 2019 County Elections Handbook at 42 (revised Oct. 2019), \nhttps://www.sos.ms.gov/Documents/ElectionsDocuments/County%20Election%20Handbook_10\n%202019.pdf.  It provides no meaningful guidance on what it means for those signatures to \n“correspond.”  Miss. Code Ann. § 23-15-641(1).  Furthermore, the statute does not define a \n“signature.”  No Mississippi statute, regulation, or Secretary of State directive specifies how \nelection officials should compare voters’ signatures on their ballot envelopes to the signatures on \nabsentee ballot application forms.  Upon information and belief, the Secretary of State does not \nregularly conduct or organize training for election officials in handwriting analysis or signature \nmatching.  Similarly, no Mississippi law requires that election officials receive any such training.  \n122. The risk of disenfranchisement through a false signature-mismatch determination \nis especially high for elderly, disabled, ill, and non-native English signatories because those \npopulations have higher signature variability, and Mississippi’s system requires election officials \nto compare the signature on a voter’s absentee ballot envelope to the signature on the voter’s \n46 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 47 of 58\nabsentee ballot application form on file with the county board of elections.  Mississippi Secretary \nof  State,  2019  County  Elections  Handbook  at  42  (revised  Oct.  2019), \nhttps://www.sos.ms.gov/Documents/ElectionsDocuments/County%20Election%20Handbook_10\n%202019.pdf.    Even  trained  handwriting  analysts  require  multiple  comparison  samples  to \ndetermine whether a signature is authentic.  Natural variations in the voter’s signature may emerge \nor increase between the signature on the ballot application and the ballot envelope.  Especially \nconsidering the risk of incorrect mismatch determinations, Mississippi law does not provide voters \nwith notice of the signature discrepancy or the opportunity to cure before rejection of the ballot.  \n123. Mississippi law does not provide voters notice and an opportunity to cure absentee \nballots that have been rejected due to perceived signature mismatch.  To the contrary, Mississippi \nplaces  the  burden  on  Mississippi  voters  to  learn  the  status  of  their  absentee  ballot  after\ndisenfranchisement, only providing voters with “written information to inform the person how to \nascertain” whether their ballot was counted or rejected, and if so, the reason for rejection.  See\nMiss. Code Ann. § 23-15-641(5). \n124. The number of voters who will vote by absentee ballot for the November 2020 \nelection will increase substantially due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  It is reasonable to predict that \nthe number of ballots rejected under the Signature Verification Requirement is bound to increase \nproportionally.  As such, Mississippi voters, including Plaintiff Goggin and the Organizational \nPlaintiffs’ members face an increased rate of rejection of their absentee ballots.  \n47 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 48 of 58\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount 1:  During the COVID-19 Crisis, Defendants’ Failure To Advise the Public that \nMississippi’s Excuse Requirement Allows Plaintiffs and Other Voters Reasonably in Fear \nof COVID-19 To Vote by Absentee Ballot Burdens the Fundamental Right to Vote in \nViolation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments  \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n(Plaintiffs Parham, Oppenheim, MS NAACP, and LWVMS) \n(All Defendants) \n125. Plaintiffs  reallege  and  reincorporate  by  reference  all  prior  paragraphs  of  this \nComplaint and the paragraphs in the counts below as though fully set forth herein. \n126. Under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, a court considering a challenge to a \nstate election law must carefully balance the character and magnitude of injury to the plaintiff’s \nright to vote against “the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden \nimposed by its rule, taking into consideration the extent to which those interests make it necessary \nto burden the plaintiff’s rights.”  Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted); Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 789 (1983).  “However slight th[e] burden \nmay appear, . . . it must be justified by relevant and legitimate state interests sufficiently weighty \nto justify the limitation.”  Crawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 191 (2008) \n(Stevens, J., controlling opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n127. The Excuse Requirement, both the “temporary or permanent disability” provision \nand  the  explicitly  defined  “physician-imposed  quarantine”  provision,  allows  voters  who \nreasonably fear that voting in-person will put them or others at risk of contracting the coronavirus \nand suffering from COVID-19, or who follow the guidance of public health officials to quarantine \nthemselves, to vote absentee. \n48 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 49 of 58\n128. Defendant Watson has failed to advise the public that this is so, and, in fact, has \nallowed conflicting statements of state officials as to the applicability of the Excuse Requirement \nto confuse voters as to whether they can vote absentee during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n129. Defendants’ failure to advise the public that the Excuse Requirement allows voters \nin fear of contracting the coronavirus to vote absentee and the confusion emanating from that \nfailure and from the conflicting official statements on the issue impose a significant burden on \nMississippi voters’ fundamental right to vote in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments \nto the United States Constitution. \n130. Defendants’ actions and omissions have placed Plaintiffs Parham and Oppenheim \nand  members  of  the  MS  NAACP  and  LWVMS  who  are  qualified  Mississippi  voters  and \nreasonably fear contracting the coronavirus in the untenable position of potentially violating the \nlaw by voting absentee so as to protect their health or of risking their health or the health of their \nloved ones to cast their ballot in person, or not vote at all. \n131. There is no legitimate state interest that outweighs the burdens placed on Plaintiffs \nby Defendants’ failure to publicly advise voters that they can vote absentee if they reasonably fear \ncontracting the coronavirus by voting in-person. \nCount 2: Alternatively, During the COVID-19 Pandemic, Defendants’ Application of the \nExcuse Requirement Unconstitutionally Burdens the Fundamental Right to Vote in \nViolation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments  \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n(Plaintiffs Parham, Oppenheim, MS NAACP, and LWVMS) \n(All Defendants) \n132. Plaintiffs incorporate and re-allege each of the foregoing paragraphs. \n133. If this Court does not find for Plaintiffs on Count 1, then this Court should rule that \nthe Excuse Requirement unconstitutionally burdens the right to vote by denying voters who \nreasonably fear that voting in-person will increase their risk of exposure to COVID-19. \n49 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 50 of 58\n134. The Excuse Requirement, if not construed as allowing voters who reasonably fear \nthat voting in person will increase their risk of exposure to COVID-19, imposes a substantial \nburden on voters who must choose between voting in person and risking their health and their \nlives, or not voting at all. \n135. This burden is particularly severe on voters like Plaintiffs who include voters with \npreexisting medical conditions, their caretakers Black voters, and older voters.   \n136. There is no countervailing legitimate state interest that outweighs the potentially \nlife-threatening burden on Plaintiffs.  \nCount 3: Alternatively, During the COVID-19 Crisis, Defendants’ Application of the \nExcuse Requirement is Unconstitutionally Vague and Denies Plaintiffs’ Right to Due \nProcess Under the Fourteenth Amendment \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n(Plaintiffs Parham, Oppenheim, MS NAACP, and LWVMS) \n(All Defendants) \n137. Plaintiffs incorporate and re-allege each of the foregoing paragraphs. \n138. If the Court does not find for Plaintiffs on Count 1, the Court should declare that \nthe Excuse Requirement is unconstitutionally vague. \n139. A statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment based on vagueness if the terms “fail \nto provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it \nprohibits” or “authorize or even encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.”  Grayned \nv. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-09 (1972).  Federal courts can refrain from invalidating the \nstatute  if  the  court  determines  that  the  statute’s  vagueness  can  be  cured  by  a  reasonable \nconstruction.  Int’l Soc’y for Krishna Consciousness of Atlanta v. Eaves, 601 F.2d 809, 822 (5th \nCir. 1979).  One such remedy includes the court construing the statute itself if there is “only one \nplausible saving construction.”  Id.\n50 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 51 of 58\n140. Under  Mississippi’s  Excuse  Requirement,  voters  may  select  temporary  or \npermanent  physical  disability  based  on  a  “physician-imposed  quarantine”  as  an  excuse  for \nabsentee voting in 2020 elections.  Mississippi is expected to see a historic number of voters \nchoose, for the first time, to vote absentee by mail to further limit exposure to the coronavirus. \n141. The “temporary disability” requirement under the Excuse Requirement should be \nconstrued as allowing voters who reasonably fear that voting in person will subject them or others \nto increased risk of contracting coronavirus and exposure to COVID-19.  \n142. Mississippi  law  does  not  define  “physician-imposed  quarantine.”    Upon \ninformation and belief, Defendants have not provided the floor testimony from Mississippi \nlegislators regarding the meaning and application of the phrase as official guidance to county \nregistrars and the public.  \n143. Mississippi  law  also  does  not  define  “dependent”  as  applied  to  the  Excuse \nRequirement.  Voters, including Plaintiff Oppenheim, are uncertain of whether the meaning \napplies to “dependent[s]” for tax purposes or other loved ones for whom they are caretakers. \n144. Defendants’ failure to provide official guidance or interpretation creates confusion \nfor Plaintiff Parham and Organizational Plaintiffs MS NAACP’s and LWVMS’s members, who \ndo not know if they are eligible to vote absentee under the “temporary disability” clause or under \nthe “physician-imposed quarantine” clause in the temporary or permanent physical disability \nexcuse.  Voters who complete the absentee ballot application do so under penalty of perjury and \nthus risk criminal prosecution if they incorrectly interpret this excuse.  \n145. Upon information and belief, Defendants have not provided any guidance to county \nelection officials regarding the Excuse Requirement, HB 1521 implementation, absentee ballot \napplications, or absentee ballots during the COVID-19 pandemic, including for the upcoming \n51 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 52 of 58\nNovember election.  Circuit Clerks, therefore, are not able to provide accurate or uniform guidance \nto voters regarding eligibility for absentee ballots during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n146. Without a conclusive statement from Defendant Watson interpreting the Excuse \nRequirement to allow all voters to cast an absentee ballot, the Requirement will remain vague \nunder Grayned.  Plaintiffs will continue to face deprivation of their due process rights absent \ninterpretation by the Court correcting the Excuse Requirement’s constitutional defects. \n147. This Court should declare that the Excuse Requirement is unconstitutionally vague \nand construe it in a way that is constitutional, i.e., that it allows voters who reasonably fear that \nvoting in person will subject them or others to increased risk of contracting coronavirus and \nexposure to COVID-19, or who listen to public health authorities and quarantine themselves during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, to vote absentee. \nCount 4:  During the COVID-19 Crisis, Mississippi’s Notarization Requirement Burdens \nthe Fundamental Right to Vote in Violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments  \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n(Plaintiffs Goggin, MS NAACP, and LWVMS) \n(All Defendants) \n148. Plaintiffs  reallege  and  reincorporate  by  reference  all  prior  paragraphs  of  this \nComplaint and the paragraphs in the counts below as though fully set forth herein. \n149.  The Notarization Requirement in the ongoing public health crisis forces Plaintiff \nGoggin, MS NAACP’s and LWVMS’s members to enter businesses or public establishments and \nengage in face-to-face contact, putting them in danger of contracting and potentially dying from \nthe coronavirus.    \n150. The  Notarization  Requirement,  particularly  as  applied  during  the  COVID-19 \npandemic, does not advance any state interest sufficiently weighty to justify the resulting burdens \n52 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 53 of 58\non the right to vote, and it therefore violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments and must be \nenjoined. \nCount 5: Mississippi’s Cure Prohibition Is a Denial of Plaintiffs’ Right to Procedural Due \nProcess under the Fourteenth Amendment \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n(Plaintiffs Goggin, MS NAACP, and LWVMS) \n(All Defendants) \n151. Plaintiffs reallege and reincorporate by reference the allegations in the preceding \nparagraphs as though fully set forth herein. \n152. Mississippi has conferred on its eligible citizens a liberty interest in voting by mail, \nwhich is protected by the doctrine of procedural due process.  See Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. \n209, 221 (2005) (“A liberty interest may arise from the Constitution itself . . . or it may arise from \nan expectation or interest created by state laws or policies.”).  At a minimum, procedural due \nprocess requires that the State provide the voter pre-deprivation notice and an opportunity to be \nheard before being denied their protected liberty interest.  See Obama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d \n423, 436 (6th Cir. 2012).  \n153. Defendants’ failure to provide absentee voters with notice and an opportunity to \ncure perceived signature-related deficiencies with their absentee ballot—particularly given the \nunreliability of signature matching and election officials’ unfettered discretion to reject ballots—\nfails to meet these minimum requirements of procedural due process and is unconstitutional. \n154. The risk of erroneous deprivation caused by the unreliability of signature matching \nand election officials’ unfettered discretion to reject ballots is high.  Without the opportunity to \ncure, absentee voters might otherwise be deprived of their fundamental right to vote.  See Mathews \nv. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976). \n53 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 54 of 58\n155. Implementation  of  procedures  to  provide  absentee  voters  with  notice  and  an \nopportunity to cure for signature-related errors would impose only a minimal burden on the State.  \nFor example, Mississippi law already provides a notice mechanism for other types of absentee \nballot issues, such as when voters include more than one ballot in the ballot envelope, if the \naffidavit is insufficient, or if the voter is disqualified.  Miss. Code. Ann. §§ 23-15-641 (2), (3).  \n156. Voters in Mississippi will continue to face a substantial risk of being deprived of \ntheir fundamental right to vote without due process absent relief granted by the Court. \nCount 6:  Mississippi’s Cure Prohibition Burdens the Fundamental Right to Vote in \nViolation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments  \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n(Plaintiffs Goggin, MS NAACP, and LWVMS) \n(All Defendants) \n157. Plaintiffs reallege and reincorporate by reference the allegations in the preceding \nparagraphs as though fully set forth herein. \n158. This fall, Mississippi is expected to see a historic number of voters choose, for the \nfirst time, to vote absentee by mail.  This includes voters who meet the challenged Excuse \nRequirement, whose ballots—among other absentee by mail voters—are subject to state signature \nmatch requirements. \n159. Mississippi  law  does  not  provide  voters  with  notice  of  benign  or  technical \nsignature-related errors, including election officials subjectively believing—without any statutory \nor regulatory guidance—that the signature accompanying the voter’s ballot did not match the \nsignature on their absentee ballot application.  \n160. Compounding the harm, the deprivation will occur without an opportunity to cure \nthe issue by any alternative verification method.  Thus, voters whose ballots are rejected for \n54 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00572-DPJ-FKB   Document 1   Filed 08/27/20   Page 55 of 58\nsignature-related  errors  are  effectively  disenfranchised.    There  is  no  remedy  to  rehabilitate \ninfringement on the right to vote once the voter is disenfranchised. \n161. Such a system imposes a significant burden on absentee voters’ fundamental right \nto vote.  The state has no legitimate and relevant state interest sufficiently weighty to justify such \na burden.  Rejections will occur without any reliable indication that the rejected ballots were \nfraudulent or improper. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court: \na. Assume jurisdiction over this action; \nb.
