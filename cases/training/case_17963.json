For more information on litigation to disclose the warrants that inspired this case, please see <a href=\"../../../../case/16844\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this link</a>. For a summary of the warrants and information on ongoing efforts by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to protect the confidential information in them, see <a href=\"../../../../case/17114\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this link</a>.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>The FISA requires the government to obtain a warrant from the FISC before it may conduct any domestic electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information. The warrant applications are made ex parte and must include a sworn statement by a federal officer of the facts and circumstances relied upon to justify the government's belief that the target of surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Once a FISC judge receives a warrant application, the judge can order approval of the surveillance only if the judge finds that there is probable cause to believe that the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Because the orders only authorize surveillance up to 90 days, the government must file an application for an extension that meets the same requirements as the initial warrant application and obtain a renewal order from the FISC for continued surveillance. For the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse collection of FISA matters, see our <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250215012453/https://clearinghouse.net/collections/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">special collection</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On November 27, 2020, an informal foreign policy advisor to the Trump 2016 presidential campaign, represented by private counsel, filed this complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. He sued the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United States, and former DOJ officials that sought the warrant against him in their individual capacities. He alleged violations of his right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures due to improperly filed FISA warrants against him. He sought $75 million in compensatory damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief to amend government records about him, and attorneys' fees for both this case and a previous, failed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request related to the suit. Page filed this case under FISA (50 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1801-1812) for each FISA warrant and renewal sought against him, <em>Bivens</em>, the Federal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C. &sect; 2674), and the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a). The plaintiff added that, at the time of filing, he had an active administrative claim under the Patriot Act pending before the DOJ, and if this claim was unsuccessful, he would add that to this complaint.</p>\r\n<p>In his complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the government did not have probable cause to obtain a FISA warrant against him, because the information upon which the warrant was based came from one unreliable confidential source. He argued that the FBI and all of the agents involved in procuring this warrant were aware, either in an investigative or supervisory capacity, of the deficiencies in the source's testimony and did not follow up with relevant sub-sources to confirm the source's allegations. The plaintiff stated that the defendants still sought the warrants anyway, even after interviews with the plaintiff in connection to the warrant failed to establish probable cause that he was acting on behalf of a foreign power to sabotage the United States, the key preliminary findings needed to grant a FISA warrant. He added that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) and subsequent FBI investigations found that the FISA warrant against Page and each of its renewals were unlawfully obtained.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on November 30, 2020. On April 15, 2021, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, with the defendants filing motions to dismiss the amended complaint in mid-May. A seconded amended complaint was filed on June 8, mooting the pending motions to dismiss. The amended complaint corrected some of the material facts and added an additional claim arising under the Patriot Act, asserting that the defendants&rsquo; willful violation of the FISA Act entitled the plaintiff to commence an action against the United States to recover money damages. In June, Judge Jackson was elevated to the D.C. Circuit and the case was unassigned. In mid-September, 2021, the defendants filed motions to dismiss or, in the alternative, for partial summary judgment.</p>\r\n<p>With the defendants&rsquo; motions pending, the case was reassigned to Judge Florence Y. Pan in early October. Judge Pan announced on October 27, however, that she would recuse herself because of her longtime friendship with an attorney for one of the defendants. The case was reassigned to Judge James E. Boasberg, who recused himself the following day, citing his extensive involvement with the matter while a judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Ultimately, the case was reassigned to Judge Dabney L. Friedrich.</p>\r\n<p>On September 1, 2022, Judge Friedrich granted the defendants&rsquo; motions to dismiss, though she noted that the plaintiff had alleged unlawful surveillance that was very \"troubling.\" 628 F. Supp. 3d 103. The Court noted in its opinion that there was no statutory cause of action against individual federal officers for writing false or misleading FISA applications, and thus the plaintiff did not state a plausible claim against the individual defendants under 50 U.S.C. &sect; 1810 because they had not technically \"engaged in unlawful surveillance.\" On Page's claim that defendants misled the FISA court to obtain warrants without probable cause, the Court declined to expand the <em>Bivens&nbsp;</em>cause of action to this novel situation, and noted that Congress had declined to allow damages claims in this context. The court also held that Congress had not waived the United States&rsquo;s sovereign immunity for the plaintiffs' claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act or the Patriot Act. Finally, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' Privacy Act claims, holding that one was time-barred and the other was barred by the plaintiff's failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff subsequently moved to alter the court's decision due to new evidence, but the court denied the motion on January 18, 2023. 2023 WL 244350.</p>\r\n<p>The following month, on February 17, the plaintiff appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The appeal was docketed on February 24 (Case Number 23-5038). On Sep 6, 2024, oral arguments were held before Judges Henderson, Pillard and Childs. As of October 23, 2024, the appeal is ongoing.</p>",

No. 20-cv-3460 (DLF) \nJAMES B. COMEY et al., \nDefendants. \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nAs  part  of  its  investigation  into  the  alleged  connection  between  the  Trump  2016 \npresidential campaign and the Russian government, the Federal Bureau of Investigation obtained \nwarrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to electronically surveil Carter \nPage, an informal advisor to the campaign.  Page alleges that the surveillance was unlawful \nbecause the warrant applications were false and misleading.  He brings statutory and constitutional \nclaims against the United States, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and individuals who worked \nat the FBI.  Before the Court are the individual defendants’ Motions to Dismiss, Dkts. 80–87, and \nthe government defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, Dkt. 88.  For the reasons that follow, the Court \nwill grant each motion.  \nI. BACKGROUND\nA. Facts\n1. Operation Crossfire Hurricane\nOn July 31, 2016, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation named “Operation \nCrossfire Hurricane” to determine whether individuals associated with the Trump presidential \ncampaign were involved in coordinated activities with the Russian government.  Second Am. \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  25  ooff  5648\nCompl. (SAC) ¶ 5, Dkt. 73.1  Plaintiff Carter Page, a “volunteer member of an informal foreign \npolicy  advisory  committee”  to  the  Trump  campaign,  alleges  that  he  was  targeted  in  this \ninvestigation.  Id. ¶¶ 5, 21.  According to Page, the FBI obtained four successive FISA warrants to \nelectronically surveil him, despite there being no probable cause to suspect that he was a Russian \nagent.  Id. ¶ 3; 50 U.S.C. §§ 1804(a)(3)(A), 1805(a)(2)(A).  \nAllegedly, defendant Stephen Somma, then an FBI counterintelligence investigator, was \nthe first to propose the surveillance of Page.  SAC ¶ 202.  After asking about the possibility of \nseeking FISA warrants, the FBI Office of General Counsel told Somma on August 15, 2016, that \nhe needed more evidence to establish probable cause.  Id. ¶ 203.  Meanwhile, on August 17, the \nCIA told the Crossfire Hurricane team that Page had been a CIA “operational contact” from 2008 \nto 2013 and had helped the agency combat Russian and other foreign countries’ intelligence-\nrelated activities.  Id. ¶ 11.  And on September 7, the CIA allegedly told defendants James Comey, \nthen-director of the FBI, and Peter Strzok, then-Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence, \nthat 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had approved a plan to connect Trump and \nRussian hackers in order to distract the public from her use of a private email server.  Id. ¶ 12.   \nPage further alleges that soon after, on September 19, the FBI received information about \na connection between the Trump campaign and Russia.  Id. ¶ 14.  Christopher Steele, a confidential \nsource for the FBI, provided two reports alleging that Page engaged in “improper or unlawful \ncommunications or activities” with “two sanctioned Russians with close ties to Russian President \nVladimir Putin.”  Id. ¶¶ 14, 74.  Steele was paid by the Democratic National Committee and/or the \n \n1 In deciding these motions to dismiss, the Court accepts as true all material factual allegations in \nthe complaint.  See Am. Nat’l Ins. Co. v. FDIC, 642 F.3d 1137, 1139 (D.C. Cir. 2011). \n2 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  36  ooff  5648\nClinton campaign to perform political opposition research.  Id. ¶ 9.  The FBI used his reports as a \nbasis to obtain a FISA warrant to surveil Page.  Id. ¶ 14.  \nAccording to Page, Steele’s reports were “essentially the exclusive source of information \nsupporting probable cause for the FISA warrant applications.”  Id. ¶ 15.  FBI officials allegedly \nchose to proceed with and rely on Steele’s information without adequately investigating his \nreliability and motives.  See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 15, 91, 157, 170.  And they falsely elevated Steele’s \ncredibility in the warrant applications and omitted facts that cast doubt on his claims.  See, e.g., id. \n¶¶ 17, 111.  At the same time, they never disclosed Page’s previous work as an operational contact \nfor the CIA in any of the four warrant applications.  Id. ¶¶ 17–18.   \nThe DOJ Office of Inspector General (OIG) later investigated and revealed the FBI’s \n“material failures” during this process.  Id. ¶ 42.  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n(FISC) has indicated that Page’s surveillance was “unlawful.”  Id. ¶ 50.  Indeed, the government \nhas conceded that it lacked probable cause to surveil Page under the last two warrants and also \nagreed to sequester information obtained from all four of the warrants.  Id. ¶ 48.  Below, the Court \nwill describe Page’s allegations about each warrant application, see infra Part I.A.2–5, and about \neach individual defendant’s actions, see infra Part III.A.1.ii.c.  \n2.  First FISA Warrant \nOn September 23, 2016, soon after the FBI received Steele’s reports, a Yahoo! News article \nrepeated the allegations that Page met with two sanctioned Russians, according to a “well-placed \nWestern Intelligence source.”  SAC ¶ 76.  Although Steele’s confidential source agreement with \nthe FBI prohibited him from talking to the media about the information he provided to the FBI, \nallegedly he was the source for the article.  Id.  A draft application for the first FISA warrant \nacknowledged that he was the source for the article, though the draft was later changed to say that \n3 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  47  ooff  5648\nSteele’s business associate or client gave the information.  Id. ¶ 80.  The final version of the warrant \napplication cited the Yahoo article as corroboration for Steele’s allegations, even though he was \nthe source for both.  Id. ¶¶ 78, 80.   \nTwo days after publication of the Yahoo article, Page sent a letter to Comey denying that \nhe had contact with the sanctioned Russians and explaining his long history of interactions with \nthe CIA and the FBI.  Id. ¶ 81.  Comey gave the letter to the Crossfire Hurricane team and its \nsupervisor, Strzok.  Id.  Around the same time, Page told Stefan Halper, another FBI confidential \nsource, that he was never involved with Russia on behalf of the Trump campaign.  Id. ¶ 86.  This \nwas consistent with statements that other witnesses made during FBI interviews.  Id. ¶¶ 85, 87.  \nAllegedly, Page’s denials were never disclosed by the FBI to DOJ attorneys.  Id. ¶ 86.  Meanwhile, \neven though a DOJ attorney asked Somma whether Page was ever a source for the CIA, Somma \ndid not mention Page’s years as a CIA operational contact.  Id. ¶¶ 11, 72, 84, 205.   \n  Page alleges that in early October, a DOJ attorney learned that Steele was performing \npolitical opposition research and thus grew concerned about his credibility.  Id. ¶ 89.  Strzok \nbriefed Comey and defendant Andrew McCabe, then-Deputy Director of the FBI, about these \nconcerns, but they “brushed [them] aside” and urged DOJ to move forward with the warrant \napplication.  Id. ¶ 91.  Defendant Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer, told the DOJ attorney that Comey and \nMcCabe had approved the decision to apply for the warrant; she also told McCabe that a “high-\nlevel push” might be necessary to get it approved.  Id.  After the DOJ attorney asked the FBI \nwhether Steele had ties to any political campaign, a footnote was added to the application that \nindicated that Steele was hired to perform political opposition research.  Id. ¶¶ 89–92.  The footnote \ndid not, however, reveal that Steele was paid with Democratic National Committee funds, a fact \nallegedly known to senior DOJ and FBI officials.  Id. ¶¶ 93, 96.   \n4 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  58  ooff  5648\n  The warrant application was submitted to the FISC on October 21, 2016.  Id. ¶ 95.  \nDefendant Joe Pientka III, an FBI supervisory special agent on the Crossfire Hurricane team, \nsigned the authorization for its submission.  Id. ¶ 198.  Comey signed the warrant application.  Id. \n¶ 150.  Based on Steele’s reports, the application claimed that Page met with at least two Russian \nofficials during a July 2016 trip to Russia.  Id. ¶ 95.  Allegedly, Pientka did not verify or correct \nthe application’s false statement that “Steele’s reporting had been corroborated and used in \ncriminal proceedings.”  Id. ¶ 199.  Nor did he confirm, as FBI policy required, that Steele’s FBI \nhandling agent had reviewed and approved the application’s content.  Id.  In fact, Page alleges that \nthe handling agent had not done so because Somma failed to seek his review.  Id. ¶ 206.  According \nto the complaint, the application failed to disclose (1) Steele’s funding source, (2) Page’s work as \na CIA operational contact, or (3) a witness’s exculpatory statement that no one in the Trump \ncampaign coordinated with Russia.  Id. ¶¶ 87, 95–96.  Further, it did not contain a “cautionary \nwarning to be vigilant against politically motivated false reports” regarding Russia.  Id. ¶ 95.   \n3.  Second FISA Warrant \nOn October 31, 2016, Mother Jones published a story about Steele’s reports to the FBI.  Id. \n¶ 101.  After Steele admitted that he was the source for the story, his FBI handling agent told him \nto stop collecting information for the FBI and that it was unlikely that the agency would continue \nto work with him.  Id. ¶¶ 101–103.  On November 17, the FBI closed Steele as a source “for cause.”  \nId.  ¶ 104.    FBI  officials  including  Strzok  and  defendant  Brian  Auten,  an  FBI  supervisory \nintelligence analyst on the Crossfire Hurricane team, investigated Steele’s credibility during trips \nto London in November and December; several former colleagues reported on Steele’s poor \njudgment and habit of pursuing politically risky people.  Id. ¶¶ 105, 174–175, 180.  Allegedly, Lisa \nPage, Strzok, Pientka, and other FBI personnel then learned more about Steele’s anti-Trump bias \n5 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  69  ooff  5648\nfrom DOJ official Bruce Ohr, who told them that Steele’s reports were being relayed to the Clinton \ncampaign.  Id. ¶ 106.   \nYet the FBI continued to receive information from Steele through various intermediaries.  \nId. ¶¶ 107–108.  And his reliability continued to be called into question.  Page further alleges that \nafter Pientka and Somma received information from the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State that \ncast doubt on some of Steele’s claims, no one from the Crossfire Hurricane team followed up with \nher to learn more.  Id. ¶ 109.  The FBI also learned in December that one of Steele’s sources was \npossibly a Russian spy and intelligence officer.  Id. ¶ 110.   \nThe second warrant application to surveil Page was submitted to the FISC on January 12, \n2017, also signed by Comey.  Id. ¶¶ 111, 152.  It acknowledged that the FBI’s relationship with \nSteele was “suspended.”  Id. ¶ 111.  But according to Page, it asserted, falsely, that Steele’s \ninformation  was  reliable  because  earlier  reporting  had  been  verified  and  used  in  criminal \nproceedings.  Id.  The application did not mention Steele’s questionable credibility due to his \npolitical motivations and the fact that one of his sources was a possible Russian intelligence officer.  \nId. ¶¶ 112–113.  Nor did it include “any foreign intelligence information that had been gathered \nduring the first three months” of Page’s surveillance, as none had been produced.  Id. ¶¶ 114–115.   \n4.  Third FISA Warrant \nIn late January 2017, the FBI, including Auten and Somma, interviewed Igor Danchenko, \none of Steele’s sources, for information about Page.  Id. ¶¶ 120, 184, 209.  The complaint alleges \nthat  Danchenko’s  statements  “contradicted  or  undermined”  the  allegations  that  Steele  had \nattributed to him.  Id.  And in March, two FBI agents, including Somma, conducted an “ambush \ninterview” of Page.  Id. ¶¶ 122, 210.  They interviewed him four more times that month, and the \ninformation he provided did not support the contention that he was a Russian agent.  Id. ¶ 121.   \n6 \n\nCCaassee 1 1:2:200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF     D Dooccuummeennt t1 12185     F Filieledd 0 029/1/071/2/232     P Paaggee 1 70 o of f5 648\nThe third warrant application was submitted to the FISC on April 7, 2017, again signed by \nComey, who was aware of the results of the Danchenko interview.  Id. ¶¶ 122, 153.  The application \nstated that Danchenko was “truthful and cooperative,” but allegedly did not disclose that his \nanswers contradicted Steele’s allegations.  Id. ¶ 121.  And it claimed that the requested warrant \nwould “continue to produce foreign intelligence information,” even though no such evidence had \nbeen revealed in the past six months of surveillance.  Id. ¶ 123.  DOJ has since conceded to the \nFISC that it lacked probable cause when it sought the third warrant.  Id. ¶ 119. \n5.  Fourth FISA Warrant  \nBefore the submission of the fourth warrant application, Page publicly stated that he had \npreviously assisted the U.S. government.  Id. ¶ 129.  Accordingly, the affiant for the fourth \napplication asked defendant Kevin Clinesmith, then-FBI assistant general counsel, whether Page \nhad ever been a source for the CIA.  Id.  On June 15, a CIA liaison told Clinesmith in an email that \nPage had been a CIA source.  Id. ¶ 130.  Thereafter, Clinesmith falsely told the affiant that Page \nhad been a “sub source” but “never a source.”  Id. ¶ 131.  When the affiant asked for proof in \nwriting, Clinesmith altered the email from the CIA liaison to state that Page was “not a [CIA] \nsource.”  Id.2  Relying on this email, the affiant signed the application.  Id. ¶ 132.   \nThe fourth warrant application was submitted to the FISC on June 29, 2017 and signed by \nMcCabe.  Id. ¶¶ 133, 163.  Again, it did not disclose Page’s status as a CIA operational contact or \nthe results of the Danchenko interviews.  Id. ¶¶ 134–135.  It also asserted that the warrant would \n“continue to produce foreign intelligence information,” despite, as Page alleges, the lack of any \nsuch information produced during the previous nine months of surveillance.  Id. ¶ 136.  DOJ has \n \n2 On August 19, 2020, Clinesmith pled guilty to making a false statement under 18 U.S.C. \n§ 1001(a)(3).  SAC ¶ 131; see United States v. Clinesmith, Minute Entry, No. 20-cr-165 (D.D.C. \nAug. 19, 2020).   \n7 \n\nCCaassee 1 1:2:200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF     D Dooccuummeennt t1 12185     F Filieledd 0 029/1/071/2/232     P Paaggee 1 81 o of f5 648\nsince conceded to the FISC that it lacked probable cause when it sought the fourth warrant.  Id. \n¶ 127.   \nPage claims that the defendants, in seeking these four warrants, failed to comply with the \nFISA statute, FISC rules, and FBI policies.  Id. ¶¶ 52–62.  He also alleges that the defendants, after \nunlawfully  obtaining  the  four  warrants  and  thus  his  electronic  communications,  “used  and \ndisclosed” them to obtain the subsequent warrants, to “unlawfully pursue investigative ends,” and \nto leak information to the media.  Id. ¶¶ 140–142.  According to Page, the United States has \nconceded in filings with the FISC that it has used and disclosed information obtained from the \nwarrants in ways prohibited by that court.  Id. ¶ 231.   \n6.  Media coverage and investigation  \nOn April 11, 2017, the Washington Post first reported about the FISA warrants obtained to \nsurveil Page.  Id. ¶ 221.  The investigation of Page, it explained, was part of the FBI’s Russia probe \nthat had begun in July 2016.  Id.  The article revealed that a FISA warrant had been issued in 2016 \nand renewed at least once, based on a “lengthy declaration” with evidence that Page was a Russian \nagent.  Id.  It also mentioned Page’s alleged meeting with one of the two sanctioned Russians, as \ndisclosed by the Steele report.  Id.  Soon after, a New York Times article reported about the Russia \nprobe and the Steele dossier, briefly discussing Page’s alleged Russia ties.  Id. ¶ 224.  Lisa Page \nand Strzok exchanged texts about these articles.  Id. ¶¶ 220, 222–223, 225.  The complaint further \nalleges that they collaborated to leak protected information about Carter Page to the media, see id., \nand that McCabe approved this plan, id. ¶ 225.   \nThe DOJ OIG began investigating the Page warrants in March 2018.  Id. ¶ 232.  On \nDecember 9, 2019, the OIG released the Horowitz Report, which revealed that the FISA warrants \nlacked probable cause and were “unlawfully obtained.”  Id. ¶ 233.  In the months before the report’s \n8 \n\nCCaassee 1 1:2:200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF     D Dooccuummeennt t1 12185     F Filieledd 0 029/1/071/2/232     P Paaggee 1 92 o of f5 648\nrelease, the OIG provided it to some of the defendants in this case for review and comment.  Id. \n¶ 234.  During this time, Page sent numerous emails to DOJ and the OIG, asserting his right under \nthe Privacy Act to review and amend the forthcoming report.  Id. ¶¶ 238, 240, 242, 244.  But his \nrequests went largely unanswered; the OIG general counsel told him only that the OIG would not \ncontact him for an interview.  Id. ¶ 249.  Page alleges that the Horowitz Report contains numerous \nerrors that he has “a right to have amended.”  Id. ¶ 250.   \nB.  Procedural History \nOn November 27, 2020, Page filed suit, bringing claims against individual, institutional, \nand unknown defendants.  See Compl., Dkt. 1.  He brought claims under FISA, 50 U.S.C. § 1810, \nand Bivens against defendants Comey, McCabe, Clinesmith, Strzok, Lisa Page, Pientka, Somma, \nand Auten.  Id. ¶¶ 216–234, 243–250; see also SAC ¶¶ 256–274, 283–289.  He sued the United \nStates under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), Compl. ¶¶ 235–242; see also SAC ¶¶ 275–282, \nand DOJ and the FBI under the Privacy Act, Compl. ¶¶ 251–263; see also SAC ¶¶ 290–302.  He \nfiled an Amended Complaint on April 15, 2021.  Am. Compl., Dkt. 51.   \nMeanwhile, Page was in the process of exhausting his administrative remedies under the \nPATRIOT Act.  SAC ¶ 306; 18 U.S.C. § 2712(b)(1).  He presented an administrative claim to DOJ \non September 30, 2020, which was denied on April 22, 2021.  SAC ¶ 306.  Accordingly, Page \nfiled his Second Amended Complaint on June 8, 2021, adding a claim against the United States \nfor a violation of the PATRIOT Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2712.  Id. ¶¶ 303–311.   \nEach individual defendant separately moves to dismiss the FISA and Bivens claims.  See \nMots. to Dismiss, Dkts. 80–87.  The United States, the FBI, and DOJ move to dismiss the FTCA, \nPrivacy Act, and PATRIOT Act claims.  See Gov’t Mot. to Dismiss, Dkt 88.            \n9 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  1103  ooff  5648\nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS \nRule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows a defendant to move to \ndismiss an action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).  Federal law \nempowers federal district courts to hear only certain kinds of cases, and it is “presumed that a \ncause lies outside this limited jurisdiction.”  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins., 511 U.S. 375, 377 \n(1994).  When deciding a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, the court must “assume the truth of all material \nfactual allegations in the complaint and construe the complaint liberally, granting plaintiff the \nbenefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged, and upon such facts determine \n[the] jurisdictional questions.”  Am. Nat. Ins. Co. v. FDIC, 642 F.3d 1137, 1139 (D.C. Cir. 2011) \n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  But the court “may undertake an independent \ninvestigation” that examines “facts developed in the record beyond the complaint” in order to \n“assure itself of its own subject matter jurisdiction.”  Settles v. U.S. Parole Comm’n, 429 F.3d \n1098, 1107 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).  A court that lacks jurisdiction \nmust dismiss the action.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), 12(h)(3). \nRule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows a defendant to move to \ndismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(6).  To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must contain factual matter sufficient to \n“state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 \n(2007).  A facially plausible claim is one that “allows the court to draw the reasonable inference \nthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009).  This standard does not amount to a specific probability requirement, but it does require \n“more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.”  Id.; see also Twombly, 550 \nU.S. at 555 (“Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative \n10 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  1114  ooff  5648\nlevel.”).  A complaint need not contain “detailed factual allegations,” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, but \nalleging facts that are “merely consistent with a defendant’s liability . . . stops short of the line \nbetween possibility and plausibility,” id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \nWell-pleaded factual allegations are “entitled to [an] assumption of truth,” id. at 679, and \nthe court construes the complaint “in favor of the plaintiff, who must be granted the benefit of all \ninferences that can be derived from the facts alleged,” Hettinga v. United States, 677 F.3d 471, \n476 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The assumption of truth does not apply, \nhowever, to a “legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  An “unadorned, the defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation” is \nnot credited; likewise, “[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by \nmere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”  Id.  Ultimately, “[d]etermining whether a complaint \nstates a plausible claim for relief [is] a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to \ndraw on its judicial experience and common sense.”  Id. at 679. \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nThe defendants seek to dismiss the complaint on statute of limitations grounds and for \nfailure to state a claim.  The United States also moves to dismiss the FTCA claim and one of the \nPrivacy Act claims on the basis that the Court lacks jurisdiction over them.  The Court will first \naddress  the  claims  against  the  individual  defendants,  followed  by  the  claims  against  the \ninstitutional defendants.   \nA.  Individual Defendants \nPage brings four counts against the individual defendants for FISA violations, one for each \nwarrant, under 50 U.S.C. § 1810.  SAC ¶¶ 256–274.  He also brings a claim under Bivens v. Six \nUnknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), seeking damages for \n11 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  1125  ooff  5648\nalleged violations of his Fourth Amendment rights.  SAC ¶¶ 283–289.  The Court will address \neach claim in turn.  \n1.  FISA Claims \nFISA governs the procedures for “governmental electronic surveillance of communications \nfor foreign intelligence purposes.”  Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 402 (2013); 50 \nU.S.C. § 1801 et seq. (1978).  To obtain a surveillance order, a federal officer must submit an \napplication to a FISC judge that satisfies various statutory criteria.  50 U.S.C. § 1804(a)(1)–(9).  \nFor instance, the applicant must include, upon oath or affirmation, “a statement of the facts and \ncircumstances relied upon by the applicant to justify his belief that . . . the target of the electronic \nsurveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.”  Id. § 1804(a)(3), (a)(3)(A).  The \njudge shall approve the application if, among other requirements, “there is probable cause to \nbelieve that . . . the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign \npower.”  Id. § 1805(a)(2), (a)(2)(A).  The judge makes this determination “on the basis of the facts \nsubmitted by the applicant.”  Id. § 1805(a)(2). \nA person may be criminally liable “if he intentionally . . . (1) engages in electronic \nsurveillance under color of law except as authorized” by FISA, the Wiretap Act, and certain other \nfederal statutes, or “(2) discloses or uses information obtained under color of law by electronic \nsurveillance, knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through \nelectronic surveillance not authorized” by the same statutes.  Id. § 1809(a).  An “aggrieved person” \nhas a civil cause of action against those who violated § 1809(a).3  Id. § 1810.  Page alleges that the \nindividual defendants violated §§ 1809(a) and 1810 both by unlawfully engaging in electronic \n \n3 An “aggrieved person” is a “person who is the target of an electronic surveillance or any other \nperson whose communications or activities were subject to electronic surveillance.”  50 U.S.C. \n§ 1801(k).  \n12 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  1136  ooff  5648\nsurveillance and using or disclosing the fruits of that surveillance.  SAC ¶¶ 260, 264, 268, 272.  \nThe defendants argue that these claims are time-barred.  Alternatively, each defendant claims that \nPage fails to sufficiently allege that he or she violated the statute.  The Court finds that the claims \nare not time-barred but that Page does not state a claim against any of the individual defendants.   \ni.  Statute of Limitations \nA statute of limitations defense may be raised in a pre-answer Rule 12(b)(6) motion only \n“when the facts that give rise to the defense are clear from the face of the complaint.”  Smith-\nHaynie v. District of Columbia, 155 F.3d 575, 578 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  When a “cause of action \ncreated by a federal statute” has no express limitations period, courts “generally borrow the most \nclosely analogous state limitations period.”  Graham Cnty. Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. \nUnited States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U.S. 409, 414 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In rare \ncases, courts borrow analogous federal limitations periods but only where applying the state \nlimitations period would frustrate federal policy.  Id. at 415; N. Star Steel Co. v. Thomas, 515 U.S. \n29, 34–35 (1995).   \nFISA’s civil cause of action does not contain a statute of limitations.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1810.  \nThe Court cannot locate, and the parties do not provide, any case that has decided the appropriate \nstatute of limitations for a FISA claim.  The parties disagree over the proper statute of limitations \nperiod.  The defendants argue that Page’s FISA claim is most analogous to libel, slander, or \ninvasion of privacy, so D.C.’s one-year limitations period should apply.4  See D.C. Code § 12-\n301(4) (libel or slander); Greenpeace, Inc. v. Dow Chem. Co., 97 A.3d 1053, 1061–62 (D.C. 2014) \n \n4 See McCabe Mot. to Dismiss at 24–25 & n.9, Dkt. 80; Clinesmith Mot. to Dismiss at 15, Dkt. \n81; Strzok Mot. to Dismiss at 9, Dkt. 82; Lisa Page Mot. to Dismiss at 15, Dkt. 83; Pientka Mot. \nto Dismiss at 7, Dkt. 84; Somma Mot. to Dismiss at 10–11, Dkt. 85; Auten Mot. to Dismiss at 11, \nDkt. 86; Comey Mot. to Dismiss at 18, Dkt. 87.   \n13 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  1147  ooff  5648\n(invasion of privacy).  Alternatively, they point to the two-year limitation for violations of the \nfederal Wiretap Act, see 18 U.S.C. § 2520(e) (running from “the date upon which the claimant \nfirst  has  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  discover  the  violation”),  and  the  federal  Stored \nCommunications Act, see id. § 2707(f) (running from “the date upon which the claimant first \ndiscovered or had a reasonable opportunity to discover the violation”).5  Page rejects these and \ninstead relies on the three-year limitations period that D.C. law prescribes for actions “for which a \nlimitation is not otherwise specifically prescribed.”  Pl.’s Omnibus Opp’n at 65, Dkt. 98 (citing \nD.C. Code § 12-301(8)).6   \nThe Court agrees with Page.  As a starting point, applying an analogous federal limitations \nperiod is the “exception,” and the defendants provide nothing to overcome “[t]he presumption that \nstate law will be the source of a missing federal limitations period.”  N. Star Steel Co., 515 U.S. at \n35; see also Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Assocs., Inc., 483 U.S. 143, 157–70 (1987) \n(Scalia, J., concurring) (questioning the legitimacy of borrowing analogous federal limitations \nperiods).  Looking to D.C. law, the residual three-year limitations period, see D.C. Code § 12-\n301(8), fits best.  Page’s claim is for an unlawful search, which is not akin to the intentional torts \nlisted in D.C. Code § 12-301(4).  Courts in this district, when borrowing analogous state limitations \nperiods, have applied the residual three-year period when the claim at issue does not resemble \nthose enumerated intentional torts.  See Bame v. Clark, 466 F. Supp. 2d 105, 109 (D.D.C. 2006) \n(applying the three-year limit to an unlawful search claim); Berman v. Crook, 293 F. Supp. 3d 48, \n \n5 See McCabe Mot. to Dismiss at 24 n.10; Clinesmith Mot. to Dismiss at 18; Strzok Mot. to Dismiss \nat 9; Pientka Mot. to Dismiss at 7; Somma Mot. to Dismiss at 13; Auten Mot. to Dismiss at 11; \nComey Mot. to Dismiss at 18.   \n6 McCabe and Pientka recognize that the three-year limitations period could apply.  See McCabe \nMot. to Dismiss at 24–25; Pientka Mot. to Dismiss at 7. \n14 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  1158  ooff  5648\n56 (D.D.C. 2018) (applying the three-year limit to an unlawful search claim based on alleged \nfalsity in the warrant application); Lederman v. United States, 131 F. Supp. 2d 46, 61–62 (D.D.C. \n2001) (applying the three-year limit to First and Fourth Amendment claims).  Page’s FISA claim \nmore closely resembles these constitutional claims, as he alleges “unwarranted government \nintrusion,” Bame, 466 F. Supp. 2d at 109, as opposed to a common-law intentional tort committed \nby “private persons,” see Lederman, 131 F. Supp. 2d at 61 (quoting Payne v. Gov’t of Dist. of \nColumbia, 559 F.2d 809, 817 n.32 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).  Accordingly, the Court will apply the three-\nyear time bar, meaning Page’s claim must have accrued on or after November 27, 2017 to be \ntimely.  \nFederal law governs the accrual of federal claims, and it specifies that the statute of \nlimitations begins to run when the plaintiff has a “complete and present cause of action.”  Loumiet \nv. United States, 828 F.3d 935, 947 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (citation omitted).  Federal courts “generally \napply a discovery accrual rule when a statute is silent on the issue, as [FISA] is here.”  Rotella v. \nWood, 528 U.S. 549, 555 (2000).  And “discovery of the injury, not discovery of the other elements \nof a claim, is what starts the clock.”  Id.; see also Sprint Commc’ns Co. v. FCC, 76 F.3d 1221, \n1228 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“Accrual does not wait until the injured party has access to or constructive \nknowledge of all the facts required to support its claim.”).  \nThe complaint reveals that, at the latest, Page learned about the FISA warrants when the \nWashington Post broke the story on April 11, 2017.  SAC ¶ 221.  The article disclosed quite a bit \nof information about Page’s claim: (1) the FBI and DOJ were involved; (2) the agencies convinced \na FISC judge that there was probable cause to believe that Page was an agent of Russia; (3) a \npartially unverified “dossier compiled by a former British intelligence officer” alleged that Page \nmet with a Putin confidant in Russia; and (4) a warrant issued in 2016 and was renewed at least \n15 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  1169  ooff  5648\nonce.  Id.; see also Comey Mot. to Dismiss Ex. 5 (Wash. Post Article) at 2, Dkt. 87-7.  Plus, Page \nis quoted in the article, saying, “This confirms all of my suspicions about unjustified, politically \nmotivated government surveillance.”  Wash. Post Article at 3.7  He “dismissed what he called ‘the \ndodgy dossier’ of false allegations” and denied that he met with the Russian.  Id. at 4.  Accordingly, \nby April 11, 2017, Page knew that he was subject to surveillance by the FBI and DOJ, and he \nsuspected that the allegations, and the ensuing warrants, were baseless.   \nIn a typical case, that might be enough for a claim to accrue.  For example, in a medical \nmalpractice case, the claim accrues when the plaintiff knows that “he has been hurt and who has \ninflicted the injury.”  United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111, 122 (1979).  Accrual does not wait \nuntil he knows that “his injury was negligently inflicted,” because a “reasonably diligent” plaintiff \ncan “seek[] advice in the medical and legal community” and can thus learn “if he has been \nwronged.”  Id. at 122–23.  This holds true even where “a considerable effort may be required” to \ndetermine whether a claim is actionable.  Rotella, 528 U.S. at 556.   \nBut in some contexts, more is required before a plaintiff is deemed to be on notice of his \nclaim.  In Klein v. City of Beverly Hills, for instance, the plaintiff brought a § 1983 suit alleging \nthat police detectives obtained search warrants based on false statements and omissions.  865 F.3d \n1276, 1278 (9th Cir. 2017).  The court held that this judicial deception claim began accruing not \nwhen the unlawful search occurred, but rather when the underlying affidavit was “reasonably \navailable.”  Id. at 1278–79.  Without the affidavit, which revealed that the officers misled the \njudge, the plaintiff could not “discover the underlying illegality.”  Id. at 1279.  In order to ensure \n \n7 Page did not include this portion of the article in his complaint.  But because the complaint \n“specifically references” and relies on the article, the Court may consider it in its entirety without \nconverting the motion into one for summary judgment.  Banneker Ventures, LLC v. Graham, 798 \nF.3d 1119, 1133 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  Page does not object to the defendants’ reliance on the article.  \nSee Pl.’s Omnibus Opp’n at 64–67.  \n16 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  1270  ooff  5648\nthat plaintiffs not file “unripe and factually unsupported” suits to “preserve their claims,” the court \nruled that “accrual need not begin at the time of the search” as long as “a diligent plaintiff has \npursued the underlying affidavit without success.”  Id.; see also Berman, 293 F. Supp. 3d at 56 \n(plaintiff’s claim for unlawful search based on a faulty warrant accrued the year that he learned of \nthe search and received a redacted affidavit, “including the portions with the statements that he \nnow alleges were false”).  \nSimilarly, the plaintiffs in Hobson v. Wilson alleged that they were victims of an unlawful \nFBI program that infringed their First Amendment rights.  737 F.2d 1, 38–39 (D.C. Cir. 1984), \noverruled  in  part  on  other  grounds  by  Leatherman  v.  Tarrant  Cnty.  Narcotics  Intel.  & \nCoordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163 (1993).  Because the defendants “offered no evidence of what \nplaintiffs could have done to find out more about their claims, short of filing suit,” the D.C. Circuit \nfound  that  their  claims  accrued  only  when  they  knew  both  that  they  were  targets  of  FBI \ninvestigation and surveillance and that the program was unconstitutional.  Id. at 35 n.107, 38–41.  \nAs the Circuit explained, a plaintiff’s suspicion or awareness of government surveillance or \ninvestigation, standing alone, “cannot conceivably constitute [actual] notice of possible” illegality, \n“without creating the anomalous situation of requiring persons to file suit on a hunch, only to be \ndismissed for failure to state a claim.”  Id. at 38–39.    \nThus, in the context of government searches and surveillance, the rationale for the typical \napplication of the discovery rule—that a diligent plaintiff, after discovering his injury, can gather \nenough information to state a claim within the limitations period—does not necessarily apply.  \nThis is especially true for FISA claims given the “secrecy shrouding the FISA process.”  United \nStates v. Daoud, 755 F.3d 479, 486 (7th Cir. 2014) (Rovner, J., concurring).  Indeed, when the \ngovernment notifies a criminal defendant that it plans to introduce evidence obtained from FISA \n17 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  1281  ooff  5648\nsurveillance of him, even then he is rarely given access to the underlying FISA application.  Id. at \n484 (majority opinion); id. at 490 (Rovner, J., concurring).   \nHere, the face of the complaint does not reveal when Page’s claim accrued.  Even though \nPage knew in April 2017 that he was under FISA surveillance and suspected that it was unjustified, \nit is far from clear that a diligent investigation would have revealed enough evidence of illegality \nto avoid “fil[ing] suit on a hunch.”  Hobson, 737 F.2d at 39.  The complaint does not allege that \nPage had access to the underlying affidavits.  See generally SAC.  Nor did the April 2017 \nWashington Post article describe the contents of the affidavits, and it is unlikely that Page would \nhave been granted full access to them.  See Daoud, 755 F.3d at 486 (Rovner, J., concurring).  \nThough his suspicions of unlawful surveillance did not trigger the need to sue, it did “require[] \nhim to make inquiries in the exercise of due diligence.”  Hobson, 737 F.2d at 35; see also Klein, \n865 F.3d at 1279 (the accrual date is delayed to a point after notice of the search as long as the \nplaintiff has diligently “pursued the . . . affidavit without success”).  It is unclear from the \ncomplaint what investigative steps, if any, Page took or could have taken after April 2017.  It is \npossible that he failed to search for the facts needed for his claim, or that he was adequately on \nnotice of his claim well before the release of the Horowitz Report on December 9, 2019, which \nPage contends is the proper accrual date.  See Pl.’s Omnibus Opp’n at 9, 67.  But at this juncture, \nthe complaint does not conclusively show that Page was sufficiently on notice of his claims before \nNovember 27, 2017.  Accordingly, the Court will not dismiss his FISA claims as time-barred and \nwill instead proceed to the merits.8 \n \n8 The defendants refer to materials outside the complaint to demonstrate Page’s knowledge of his \nclaims.  See, e.g., Clinesmith Mot. to Dismiss at 17.  Even if the Court were inclined to take judicial \nnotice, none of these documents shows that, before November 27, 2017, Page was on sufficient \nnotice of his claims so as to trigger accrual.   \n18 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  1292  ooff  5648\nii.  Engaging in Electronic Surveillance  \nPage alleges that “the individual Defendants and others, known and unknown to [him], \nengaged in electronic surveillance against [him] that was not lawfully authorized by FISA” and \n“aided and abetted one another in doing so.”  SAC ¶ 260; see also id. ¶¶ 264, 268, 272.  As an \ninitial matter, the Court finds, and the defendants do not contest, that Page’s surveillance, at least \nas alleged, was unlawful.  Surveillance pursuant to a warrant obtained without probable cause is \nnot “authorized” by FISA.  50 U.S.C. § 1809; see also id. §§ 1804(a), 1805(a).   The complaint \nalleges material errors and omissions in each application that plausibly misled the FISC into an \nerroneous finding of probable cause.  See, e.g., SAC ¶¶ 16–19, 42–46.  Indeed, the government \nhas already conceded as much for the last two warrants.  Id. ¶¶ 50–51.   \nBecause Page’s claims are rooted in FISA §§ 1809(a) and 1810, the Court must look there \nto determine if he has a cause of action against these defendants for the concededly unlawful \nsearches.  Section 1810 provides “a cause of action against any person who committed [a] violation \n[of § 1809],” which in turn prohibits “intentionally . . . engag[ing] in [unauthorized] electronic \nsurveillance,” § 1809(a).9  Therefore, the relevant question is whether the complaint adequately \nalleges that these defendants  “intentionally engage[d] in  electronic surveillance” within the \nmeaning of the statute.  Id.  Page argues that the defendants are liable as both aiders and abettors \nas well as principals, because they “supervis[ed],” “facilitat[ed],” “prepar[ed],” “approv[ed],” and \n“submit[ted]” the “false” applications, which  “cause[d] others to physically engage in the \nunlawful surveillance.”  See Pl.’s Omnibus Opp’n at 32, 34, 49, 51.  But his FISA claim fails for \n \n9 The Court addresses Page’s “use or disclosure” claims under §§ 1809(a) and 1810 below in Part \nIII.A.1.iii. \n19 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  2203  ooff  5648\ntwo reasons: § 1810 does not allow for aiding and abetting liability, and the phrase “engage in \nelectronic surveillance” does not cover any of the defendants’ alleged actions.  \na.  Aiding and Abetting Liability  \n“[W]hen Congress enacts a statute under which a person may sue and recover damages \nfrom a private defendant for the defendant’s violation of some statutory norm, there is no general \npresumption that the plaintiff may also sue aiders and abettors.”  Cent. Bank of Denver v. First \nInterstate Bank of Denver, 511 U.S. 164, 182 (1994).  Instead, courts presume that “statutory \nsilence on the subject of secondary liability means there is none.”  Owens v. BNP Paribas S.A., \n235 F. Supp. 3d 85, 93 (D.D.C. 2017) (quoting Boim v. Holy Land Found. for Relief & Dev., 549 \nF.3d 685, 689 (7th Cir. 2008)).  Neither FISA § 1809(a) nor § 1810 reference any form of \nsecondary liability.  Thus, the statute’s “plain language shows that Congress had one category of \noffenders in mind—i.e., those who directly” engage in unauthorized surveillance.  Council on Am.-\nIslamic Rels. Action Network, Inc. v. Gaubatz, 891 F. Supp. 2d 13, 27 (D.D.C. 2012).  Congress’s \nexpress inclusion of an aiding and abetting provision in another section of FISA, see 50 U.S.C. § \n1801(b)(1)(B), (E) (defining “[a]gent of a foreign power”), further indicates that it did not “intend[] \n§ [1810] to authorize civil liability for aiding and abetting through its silence,” Owens, 235 F. \nSupp. 3d at 93 (citation omitted).   \nPage offers little in response.  Because the criminal aiding and abetting statute, 18 U.S.C. \n§ 2, applies to criminal violations of 50 U.S.C. § 1809(a), he assumes that aiding-and-abetting \nliability also applies to the civil cause of action in § 1810.  Pl.’s Omnibus Opp’n at 16.  But \nCongress has not enacted an analogous civil aiding and abetting provision and instead takes a \n“statute-by-statute approach.”  Cent. Bank of Denver, 511 U.S. at 182–83.  And § 1810 makes no \nmention of aiding and abetting liability.  Moreover, courts, including this one, have held that \n20 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  2214  ooff  5648\nplaintiffs  cannot  bring  a  civil  action  using  a  secondary  liability  theory  under  the  Stored \nCommunications Act, which similarly incorporates that Act’s criminal provision.

Thus, to state a claim under § 1810, Page must allege \nthat the individual defendants personally engaged in unauthorized surveillance, not simply that \nthey aided those who did.  See Cent. Bank of Denver, 511 U.S. at 177–78.   \nb.  “Engaging in Electronic Surveillance” Defined \nTo determine the meaning of the phrase “engage[] in electronic surveillance,” the Court \nstarts, as it must, with the text.  See Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997).  To \n“engage” means “to take part” or “participate.”  Engage, Merriam-Webster’s New Collegiate \nDictionary  378  (1977).    And  the  common  meaning  of  “electronic  surveillance”  is  akin  to \n“[e]avesdropping,” Electronic Surveillance, Black’s Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979), which in turn \nis defined as “listen[ing] surreptitiously to” or “observ[ing]” an individual in “a private place,” or \n“[i]nstalling or using . . . any device” to do so,” Eavesdropping, Black’s Law Dictionary (5th ed. \n1979).  See also Wiretapping, Black’s Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979) (“A form of electronic \neavesdropping where, upon court order, enforcement officials surreptitiously listen to phone \ncalls”); Surveillance, Oxford English Dictionary (2d ed. 1989) (“Watch or guard kept over a \nperson[.]”).  More importantly, FISA itself defines “electronic surveillance.”  That definition \nincludes, as relevant here:   \n[T]he acquisition by an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device of the \ncontents of any wire or radio communication sent by or intended to be received by \na particular, known United States person who is in the United States, if the contents \nare  acquired  by  intentionally  targeting  that  United  States  person,  under \ncircumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a \nwarrant would be required for law enforcement purposes.  \n \n21 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  2225  ooff  5648\n50 U.S.C. § 1801(f)(1).10 \nThe statute’s criminal and civil liability provisions cover those who participate in the \nacquisition, by a particular device, of the contents of certain communications sent or received by \na targeted person.  The breadth of the phrase “engage in electronic surveillance” depends on the \nterm “acquisition.”  If it were understood expansively to encompass the entire FISA surveillance \nprocess, the statute could presumably provide liability for many different actors: those who took \npart in the decision to surveil (with or without a warrant), the preparation and submission of the \nwarrant application (if any), and the collection of the communications, among other things.  But \ntext, structure, and context point toward a much narrower reading.  See Robinson, 519 U.S. at 341. \n  Turning first to the text, the ordinary meaning of “acquisition” is “the act of acquiring,” \nAcquisition, Merriam-Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary 11 (1977) (emphasis added), not the \nprocess behind it.  That “acquisition” is followed in the statute by the term “by an electronic, \nmechanical, or other surveillance device” further indicates that its statutory meaning is tethered to \nthe actual collection of the communications by specified means, as opposed to the pre-collection \ninvestigation or authorization stage.  One who engages in acquisition is one who takes part in the \nact of obtaining communications by using a device.  See also 50 U.S.C. § 1810(f)(4) (“[E]lectronic \nsurveillance” also means “the installation or use of an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance \ndevice in the United States for monitoring to acquire information.” (emphasis added)).   \n  This narrower reading of FISA’s definition of “electronic surveillance” comports with \ncommon usage of that term.  “Surveillance” has long been understood to refer to the specific act \n \n10 While this first definition is relevant to Page as a “target[ed]” and “known United States person \nwho is in the United States,” id., FISA also includes three other definitions for “electronic \nsurveillance,” see id. § 1801(f).  Each of the other three definitions is similarly limited to the \n“acquisition by an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device,” id. §§ 1801(f)(2), (3), or \n“installation or use of an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device,” id. § 1801(f)(4). \n22 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  2236  ooff  5648\nof collecting information by listening to or watching someone.  See, e.g., Katz v. United States, \n389 U.S. 347, 354 (1967) (“The agents confined their surveillance to the brief periods during which \n[the  petitioner]  used  the  telephone  booth,  and  they  took  great  care  to  overhear  only  the \nconversations of the petitioner himself.” (footnote omitted)); Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S. 427, \n465 (1963) (Brennan, J., dissenting) (comparing “electronic surveillance, whether the agents \nconceal the devices on their persons or in walls or under beds, and conventional police stratagems \nsuch as eavesdropping and disguise”).  That activity is distinct from the process of getting a \nwarrant.  See, e.g., United States v. U.S. Dist. Court (Keith), 407 U.S. 297, 315 (1972) (addressing \nwhether  the  Fourth  Amendment  “requir[es]  a  warrant  before  [electronic]  surveillance  is \nundertaken”); United States v. N.Y. Tel. Co., 434 U.S. 159, 179 (1977) (Stevens, J., dissenting) \n(referring to “the Government’s application for permission to engage in surveillance by means of \na pen register”).  To interpret the phrase “engage in electronic surveillance” to include the process \nof getting the warrant would trample on this common understanding.  The application for an order \napproving electronic surveillance and the actual surveillance are not one and the same. \nOther provisions of FISA confirm this interpretation.  FISA defines “[a]gent of a foreign \npower” to include, among others, “any person other than a United States person who . . . engages \nin the international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, or activities in preparation \ntherefor . . . or knowingly aids or abets [or conspires with] any person in the conduct of such \nproliferation or activities in preparation therefor[.]”  50 U.S.C. § 1801(b), (b)(1)(E) (emphasis \nadded).  This language implies that “engaging in” an activity does not include preparing for it or \naiding the primary actors.11  And unlike that section, FISA’s liability provisions omit any reference \n \n11 The defendants point to the Supreme Court’s decisions in Southwest Airlines Co. v. Saxon, 142 \nS. Ct. 1783 (2022), and Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105 (2001), to support their \n \n23 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  2247  ooff  5648\nto preparation, aiding, abetting, or conspiring.  See Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 \n(1983) (“[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in \nanother section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and \npurposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.” (quotation omitted)).  \nFurther, the FISA application must state “the period of time for which the electronic \nsurveillance is required to be maintained,” 50 U.S.C. § 1804(a)(9), implying that the surveillance \nhas not yet begun.  In fact, Page’s complaint recognizes this distinction: it alleges that the \ndefendants “unlawfully obtained the four warrants” and then “used the warrants to engage in \nsurveillance of him.”  SAC ¶ 140.  And § 1809(b), the statutory defense for a § 1809(a) violation, \nrefers to “electronic surveillance [that] was authorized by and conducted pursuant to a search \nwarrant or court order of a court of competent jurisdiction.”  If engaging in electronic surveillance \nincluded the process of getting the court order, this sentence would make very little sense. \nFISA’s provisions detailing “minimization procedures,” 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(h), 1804(a)(4), \n1805(c)(2)(A), likewise confirm that “acquisition” is a specific, narrow stage in the FISA process.  \nMinimization procedures, which balance privacy concerns with “the need of the United States to \nobtain,  produce,  and  disseminate  foreign  intelligence  information,”  specifically  differentiate \nbetween the “acquisition,” “retention,” and “dissemination” of information.  See id. § 1801(h)(1).  \nIn the minimization context, “acquisition” refers to the actual gathering of information, for \ninstance, by “tapp[ing]” a switchboard line.  In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, 731 (FISA Ct. Rev. \n \nargument that the phrase “engage in” means “to do.”  See Rough Hr’g Tr. at 5–6, 10–12.  In both \ncases, the Court indicated that “engaged in” has a narrower meaning than other formulations, such \nas “affecting” or “involving.”  Saxon, 142 S. Ct. at 1789 (citing Circuit City, 532 U.S. at 118).  \nThese decisions offer limited support, however, because both addressed the meaning of “engaged \nin foreign or interstate commerce” under 9 U.S.C. § 1, which has a particular statutory history that \nis not relevant here.  See Saxon, 142 S. Ct. at 1789–90; Circuit City, 532 U.S. at 111–21. \n24 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  2258  ooff  5648\n2002) (“By minimizing acquisition, Congress envisioned that, for example, ‘where a switchboard \nline is tapped but only one person in the organization is the target, the interception should probably \nbe discontinued where the target is not a party’ to the communication.” (quoting H. Rep. No. 95–\n1283, at 55–56)).12  Acquisition thus refers to the information collection phase of FISA.  \nA helpful parallel can be found in the “physical search” provision of FISA.  Like an \nelectronic surveillance, a physical search can occur only after the FISC approves an application \nthat establishes probable cause that the target is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power.  50 \nU.S.C. §§ 1823(a)(3)(A), 1824(a)(2)(A).13  But a person is liable for an unlawful physical search \nonly if he “intentionally . . . under color of law for the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence \ninformation, executes a physical search within the United States except as authorized by statute.”  \nId. § 1827(a) (emphasis added).  Section 1828 allows “any aggrieved person . . . whose premises, \nproperty, information, or material has been subjected to a physical search” to sue “any person who \ncommitted such violation.”  Id. § 1828.  Congress thus created a remedy only against those who \nexecute, or “carry out,” the unlawful search, as opposed to those who procure the order that allows \nthe search to happen.  Execute, Oxford English Dictionary (2d ed. 1989). \n \n12 The government properly minimizes information during the acquisition phase if, for instance, \n“before  executing  the  FISC  order  the  FBI  verified  the  facilities  subject  to  the  approved” \nsurveillance and “subsequently, the collections were conducted during the approved times using \nthe least physical intrusion necessary.”  United States v. Turner, 840 F.3d 336, 342 (7th Cir. 2016).  \nOn the other hand, minimization at the retention stage includes “destroy[ing]” information that has \nalready been collected, if it “is not necessary for obtaining[,] producing, or disseminating foreign \nintelligence information.”  In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 717 (quoting H. Rep. at 56) (second \nalteration in original).  And at the dissemination stage, minimization requires “restrict[ing]” \ncollected information “to those officials with a need for such information.”  Id.  \n13 A “physical search” means “any physical intrusion within the United States into premises or \nproperty (including examination of the interior of property by technical means) that is intended \nto result in a seizure, reproduction, inspection, or alteration of information, material, or property, \nunder circumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant \nwould be required for law enforcement purposes[.]”  50 U.S.C. § 1821(5).   \n25 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  2269  ooff  5648\n  The Wiretap Act also serves as a useful comparison.14  A person violates the Act if he \n“intentionally intercepts, endeavors to intercept, or procures any other person to intercept or \nendeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or electronic communication” unless it is authorized by \nstatute.  18 U.S.C. § 2511(1)(a).  The definition of “intercept” is nearly identical to one for \n“electronic surveillance”: “the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or \noral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device.”  Id. § 2510(4).  \nBy prohibiting both intercepting (i.e., acquiring) and procuring another to intercept, the Act implies \nthat “acquisition” itself does not include a procurement component.  And unlike the Wiretap Act, \nFISA does not include the procurement phrase, supporting the conclusion that FISA covers only \nacquisition, not the procurement of others to acquire the target’s communications.   \nAccordingly, one who “engage[s] in electronic surveillance” under §§ 1809(a) and 1810 is \none who participates in collecting the target’s communications using certain devices.15  To be sure, \n \n14 The Wiretap Act, enacted in 1968, “provided procedures for obtaining electronic surveillance \nwarrants in certain criminal investigations.”  United States v. Belfield, 692 F.2d 141, 144 (D.C. \nCir. 1982).  FISA was passed ten years later to address electronic surveillance in the national \nsecurity space.  Id. at 145.  The Wiretap Act and FISA prescribe “the exclusive means by which \nelectronic surveillance, as defined in [FISA], and the interception of domestic wire, oral, and \nelectronic communications may be conducted.”  18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(f).  \n15 The Court has found, and the parties have provided, very little caselaw on §§ 1809 and \n1810.  Although the few relevant cases do not analyze the meaning of phrase “engage in electronic \nsurveillance,” as the Court has done here, they are generally consistent with the Court’s ruling.  See \nUnited States v. Koyomejian, 946 F.2d 1450, 1459 n.16 (9th Cir. 1991) (“[Section] 1809(a) is best \nunderstood as subjecting to criminal liability anyone who performs electronic surveillance as \ndefined by FISA” without authorization (emphasis added)).  In Fazaga v. FBI, 965 F.3d 1015 (9th \nCir. 2020), rev’d on other grounds, 142 S. Ct. 1051 (2022), the court found that allegations that \nagents “had audio surveillance” in their house, “were responsible for planting [the] devices,” and \nhad once entered the mosque where they had electronic surveillance devices, plausibly stated a \nclaim under § 1810 for “install[ing] or us[ing] . . . [a] device . . . for monitoring to acquire \ninformation.”  Id. at 1038; 50 U.S.C. § 1801(f)(4).  That court went further by implying that \nsupervising agents might have been liable had the complaint alleged that they “ordered or arranged \nfor[] the planting of the recording devices,” id. at 1039, but the court did not decide that issue.  And \nit did not perform a textual analysis of the meaning of “engage in electronic surveillance,” as the \nCourt does here.   \n26 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  2370  ooff  5648\nsurveillance pursuant to a warrant cannot occur absent an application and order of approval from \nthe FISC.  See Pl.’s Omnibus Opp’n at 49.  But Congress chose to create individual liability only \nfor the actors involved in conducting the surveillance, rather than those responsible for gaining \napproval to do so.  Those who work on the FISA applications may “aid[], abet[], counsel[], \ncommand[], induce[], or procure[]” the eventual surveillance, see 18 U.S.C. § 2, but as explained \nabove, Congress did not provide for aiding and abetting liability in § 1810, and the statutory terms \nare not broad enough to encompass those actions.  \n  This plain-text understanding—that Congress allowed suit against only those who conduct \nunauthorized surveillance, and not those who at the application stage mislead the FISC to approve \nthat surveillance—may seem odd.  But it is not so “absurd when considered in the particular \nstatutory context,” as the Court must.  Mova Pharm. Corp. v. Shalala, 140 F.3d 1060, 1068 (D.C. \nCir. 1998).  FISA was enacted in 1978 to address the issue of warrantless surveillance in the \nnational security context.  In Katz, the Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment applied to \nelectronic surveillance, 389 U.S. at 353, but left open whether the warrant requirement applied \n“when the President was acting pursuant to his powers to protect the national security or to conduct \nthe nation’s foreign affairs,” Belfield, 692 F.2d at 145 (citing Katz, 389 U.S. at 358 n.23).  Later, \nin Keith, the Court explained that there was no national security exception to the  warrant \nrequirement with regard to “domestic threats to national security,” and left open whether warrants \nwere required “with respect to activities of foreign powers or their agents.”  407 U.S. at 321–22.   \nCongress, in response to Keith and “to post-Watergate concerns about the Executive’s use of \nwarrantless electronic surveillance,” enacted FISA to “establish a regularized procedure” for such \nsurveillance “in the foreign intelligence and counterintelligence field.”  Belfield, 692 F.2d at 145.  \nFISA generally, with a few exceptions, “requires a court order authorizing foreign intelligence \n27 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  2381  ooff  5648\nelectronic surveillance,” and details numerous steps that must be followed to get an order.  Id. at \n145–46. \nIn sum, FISA was passed to counter the abuses of warrantless surveillance.  This historical \ncontext helps explain why § 1809(a) applies to agents who conduct unauthorized surveillance—\ntypically, that means without a court order—rather than those who help obtain faulty warrants.  \nThis gap in coverage seems evident now, but it likely was not in 1978.  Accordingly, the Court’s \nunderstanding of § 1809(a)’s ordinary meaning is bolstered by FISA’s history.   \nFurther, those aggrieved by surveillance conducted pursuant to a warrant lacking in \nprobable cause are not entirely without a remedy.  As discussed, they can sue the agents who \nconduct the search, if the agents act intentionally.  And if the government seeks to use FISA-\nobtained evidence against them in a criminal trial, they may move to suppress such evidence on \nthe grounds that it was unlawfully acquired.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1806(e).  \nc.  Allegations Against Individual Defendants \nHaving defined FISA’s scope, the Court now turns to Page’s allegations against the \nindividual defendants.16  Though his allegations are troubling, Page does not allege that any of the \n \n16 Many of the defendants ask the Court to consider the Horowitz Report in full, claiming that its \nconclusions conflict with some of Page’s allegations.  See, e.g., Strzok Mot. to Dismiss at 4 n.3, \n13; Pientka Mot. to Dismiss at 2 n.3, 14–15; Somma Mot. to Dismiss at 3 n.2, 16–17.  At the \nhearing, the plaintiff did not oppose this request.  Rough Hr’g Tr. at 71.  The Court, however, \ndeclines to consider the entire Report.  True, the Report is extensively referenced in the complaint.  \nBut the Court cannot wholly incorporate it by reference because it is not “integral to [Page’s] \nclaim.”  Banneker, 798 F.3d at 1133 (citation omitted).  That is, it is not akin to a contract “that is \na necessary element of [a breach of contract] claim.”  Id.  Rather, Page references it “to show how \n[he] learned some facts in the complaint.”  Id. at 1134.  He does “not purport to and [is] not required \nto adopt the factual contents of the report wholesale.”  Id.  Indeed, he alleges that some of its \ncontents are inaccurate.  SAC ¶ 250.  The Court can certainly consider the Report to “show any \ninaccuracy in [Page’s] allegations about its contents.”  Id. at 1134 n.6.  But it cannot, as some of \nthe individual defendants argue, “tak[e] . . . as true” all of the Report’s contents, including its \nconclusions  about  the  individual  defendants’  intent  and  motivations,  to  contradict  Page’s \nallegations.  Id.  \n28 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  2392  ooff  5648\nindividual  defendants  personally  conducted  the  surveillance  or  acquired  or  collected  his \ncommunications.  For this reason, his FISA claims must be dismissed. \nComey, McCabe, Strzok, and Lisa Page.  Some of the defendants, such as Comey, McCabe, \nStrzok, and Lisa Page, allegedly approved, encouraged, and facilitated Page’s investigation and \nthe warrant applications.   \nJames Comey, the FBI director during the first three FISA warrant applications, SAC ¶ 26, \nread the first application and signed all three, id.  ¶¶ 150, 152, 153.  His “certification” confirmed \nto the FISC that the information sought was foreign intelligence information that could not \nreasonably be obtained by normal investigative techniques, and that a “significant purpose of the \nsurveillance [was] to obtain foreign intelligence information.”  50 U.S.C. § 1804(a)(6).  According \nto Page, Comey gave a “green light” to apply for the first FISA warrant “without further scrutiny” \nof Steele, despite some concerns about his bias.  SAC ¶¶ 91, 159.  He also was aware of certain \nkey information that was not fully disclosed in the various applications, including, among others, \nHillary Clinton’s plan to connect Trump and Russian election interference, Steele’s funding \nsource, and Page’s previous status as a CIA operational contact.  Id. ¶¶ 73, 81, 144, 146, 148, 153.   \nAndrew McCabe, the Deputy Director of the FBI during the Page surveillance, signed the \nforeign-intelligence certification for fourth FISA application.  Id. ¶ 27.  His alleged actions are \nsimilar to Comey’s—he too gave the “green light” to proceed with the FISA application despite \nthe concerns about Steele’s bias, id. ¶ 91, and “ignored warnings that more information about [his] \nmotives was needed before relying on his allegations,” id. ¶ 157.  He was told that Steele’s work \nwas political opposition research for a political party.  Id. ¶ 94.  DOJ supposedly would not approve \nthe FISA application “without a call from McCabe.”  Id. ¶ 158.   \n29 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  3303  ooff  5648\nPeter Strzok was the Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence at the FBI and \nsupervised the Page investigation until January 2017.  Id. ¶ 29.  Like Comey, he knew about \nClinton’s plan to connect Trump and Russia, id. ¶ 73, and that Page denied meeting with Russian \nofficials and had previously worked with the CIA and FBI, id. ¶¶ 81, 166.  He too “pushed to \nproceed with the application without further scrutiny of Steele” and “[fought] with [the DOJ \nattorney] for” it.  Id. ¶¶ 168, 170.  As the investigation continued, he learned more about Steele’s \nquestionable credibility.  Id. ¶¶ 105–106, 171–172.  Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer and Special Counsel \nto McCabe during the Page investigation, also learned about Steele’s bias, including that his work \nwas political opposition research.   SAC ¶ 94, 106, 195.  The complaint alleges that she “facilitated \nobtaining the initial FISA warrant for Dr. Page in the face of doubts voiced by the DOJ and others,” \nid. ¶ 195, and exchanged text messages with Strzok indicating a political motivation, id. ¶ 197.   \nAbsent from the complaint is any claim that these four defendants participated in drafting \nor substantively reviewing the faulty applications themselves, let alone that they performed the \nFISA surveillance and acquired Page’s communications.   \nPientka, Auten, Somma, and Clinesmith.  Even for the four defendants who did contribute \nto the material errors in the applications, Page does not claim that they “engage[d] in electronic \nsurveillance,” as defined above.   \nJoe Pientka, a Supervisory Special Agent in the FBI’s Washington Field Office, signed an \nauthorization to submit the first application that confirmed compliance with the FBI’s “Woods \nProcedures,” which are “designed to ensure the accuracy of the factual assertions in a [FISA] \napplication.”  SAC ¶¶ 31, 60, 198.  He was responsible for reviewing the “Woods File” to confirm \nthat there was appropriate documentation for each factual assertion in the application.

Id. ¶¶ 179, 206.  Brian Auten was an FBI Supervisory Intelligence \nAnalyst who worked on the Crossfire Hurricane investigation from its start in July 2016 through \n2017.  Id. ¶¶ 33, 175.  He helped the agents prepare the applications by reviewing the probable \ncause sections for accuracy, filling in gaps, and providing information about Steele and his sub-\nsources.  Id. ¶¶ 175–176.  He “falsely enhanced [Steele’s] credibility” by writing the misstatement \ndiscussed above and failing to disclose that Steele’s colleagues gave negative feedback about his \njudgment and that some of his reporting was inaccurate.  Id. ¶¶ 179–181.  In January 2017, he \ninterviewed Danchenko, one of Steele’s key sub-sources, and found that he “contradicted key \nclaims in Steele’s reports”; this was not reported to the FISC.

According to the OIG, Somma was “primarily responsible for some \nof the most significant errors and omissions in the FISA applications.”  Id. ¶ 32.   \nFinally,  Kevin  Clinesmith  was  an  FBI  Assistant  General  Counsel  during  the  Page \ninvestigation who provided support to the Crossfire Hurricane team.  SAC ¶¶ 28, 122, 185.  The \n31 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  3325  ooff  5648\naffiant for the fourth warrant application asked him whether Page had ever been a “source \n(operational contact) for the CIA.”  Id. ¶ 129.  Clinesmith knew that if Page had been a source, \nthat fact needed to be disclosed to the FISC, but including it “would expose the material omission \nof this information” from the first three warrants.  Id. ¶ 130.  A CIA liaison told him that Page had \nbeen a source, id., but Clinesmith told the affiant that Page was a “sub source” and “never a \nsource,” ultimately altering the liaison’s email to that effect, id. ¶ 131.  The affiant relied on the \ndoctored email to sign the fourth application, which did not include “information about [Page’s] \nhistory or status as a CIA operational contact.”  Id. ¶ 191–194.   \nIf proven, these allegations clearly demonstrate wrongdoing.  See Franks v. Delaware, 438 \nU.S. 154, 164–65 (1978) (“When the Fourth Amendment demands a factual showing sufficient to \ncomprise ‘probable cause,’ the obvious assumption is that there will be a truthful showing.” \n(quotation marks omitted and alteration adopted)); Daoud, 755 F.3d at 489 (Rovner, J., concurring) \n(“[I]t has been widely assumed, if not affirmatively stated, in the decisions of other courts that \nFranks applies to FISA applications.”).  Indeed, Clinesmith entered a plea in United States v. \nClinesmith for making a false statement, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001.17  But Page does not \nallege that any of the individual defendants, including the unknown John Doe defendants and those \nmost responsible for the applications’ critical errors, took part in obtaining the surveillance \ninformation, either by setting up the devices or gathering or listening to Page’s communications.18  \n \n17 See supra note 2.   \n18 In his opposition brief and at the hearing, Page concedes that he “has not named as a defendant \nany FBI who personally engaged in the physical execution of the unlawful warrants as these \npersons are as yet unknown and unknowable to him.”  Pl.’s Omnibus Opp’n at 32 n.5; Rough Hr’g \nTr. at 24–25.   \n32 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  3336  ooff  5648\nThus, the Court cannot plausibly infer from this complaint that any of the individual defendants, \nknown or unknown, “engaged in electronic surveillance,” in violation of §§ 1809(a) and 1810.  \niii.  Using or Disclosing Information from Electronic Surveillance \nSections 1809(a) and 1810 also create a remedy against those who intentionally “disclose[] \nor use[] information obtained under color of law by electronic surveillance, knowing or having \nreason to know” that the surveillance was unauthorized.  Page’s additional allegations that the \nindividual defendants used and disclosed the fruits of the allegedly unlawful surveillance in \nnumerous ways, SAC ¶¶ 229–230, are conclusory and thus do not state an actionable use or \ndisclosure claim. \nAccording to Page, the defendants used and disclosed FISA-acquired information to obtain \nthe renewal warrants and other investigative measures against him or others; to investigate and \nprosecute others; to request assistance from other law enforcement and intelligence agencies; to \ninclude in government databases; and to justify his ongoing surveillance to other officials.  Id. \n¶ 230.  But he does not allege that any particular defendant took any of these actions.  Id.; see also \nid. ¶ 229.  And “a plaintiff cannot satisfy the minimum pleading requirements under Rule 8 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure by lumping all the defendants together in each claim and \nproviding no factual basis to distinguish their conduct.”  Toumazou v. Turkish Republic of \nNorthern Cyprus, 71 F. Supp. 3d 7, 21 (D.D.C. 2014) (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Indeed, Page cannot show that a defendant intentionally used or disclosed information \nobtained through unlawful surveillance, as required by 50 U.S.C. §§ 1809(a) and 1810, without \nproviding any details about his or her individual actions.  To the extent Page claims that the \ndefendants aided and abetted each other’s use or disclosure violations, cf. Pl.’s Omnibus Opp’n at \n16–18, that claim also fails for the reasons explained above in Part III.A.1.ii.a.   \n33 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  3347  ooff  5648\nPage’s allegations are also vague in other respects: they do not explain what information \nwas leaked, to whom it was leaked, or when or how it was leaked.  And his allegations that the \nsurveillance produced “no evidence at all” that he acted as a Russian agent undercuts his claim \nthat its results were used to procure the renewal warrants.  SAC ¶¶ 123, 136.  Accordingly, the \nCourt cannot “draw the reasonable inference that [any of] the defendant[s] [are] liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. \nAlthough Page’s media leak allegations are stated with particularity, they too fail to state a \nclaim for another reason.  He asserts that Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Lisa Page, and others disclosed \n“the existence of the FISA Warrants, the contents of the warrant applications, and the results of \nthe Warrants” to the New York Times, the Washington Post, and others.  SAC ¶ 226.  But only \nthe use or disclosure of information “obtained” by the electronic surveillance, not the fact of the \nsurveillance or the basis for the warrants, violates § 1809(a).  Neither the Times nor the Post article \ncited in the complaint contains any mention of the fruits of Page’s surveillance.  See id. ¶¶ 221, \n224; Wash. Post Article; Comey Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. 6 (N.Y. Times Article), Dkt. 87-8.  And the \ncomplaint does not cite any other media reports that contained FISA-obtained information, nor do \nthe Strzok/Lisa Page text messages mention a plan to leak such information.  SAC ¶¶ 220, 222–\n223.  Page’s bare allegation that the defendants disclosed the results of his surveillance to the \nmedia, without any further detail, does not raise his “right to relief above the speculative level.”  \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  \nThe Court will thus dismiss the FISA claims in Counts One through Four against each \nindividual defendant.  Because the Court concludes that Page fails to state a claim that the \ndefendants engaged in electronic surveillance, or used or disclosed its results, it need not address \n34 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  3358  ooff  5648\nthe  defendants’  arguments  that  they  are  protected  by  a  statutory  defense  and/or  qualified \nimmunity.19 \n2.  Bivens Claims  \nThe defendants move to dismiss the Bivens claim for failure to state a claim, both on the \nmerits and on statute of limitations grounds.  For the reasons explained above in Part III.A.1.i, the \nCourt disagrees that the claim is time-barred.  Page’s Bivens claim is governed by the three-year \nlimitations period in D.C. Code § 12-301(8), see Berman, 293 F. Supp. 3d at 56, and the complaint \ndoes not show that the claim accrued before November 27, 2017.  The Court will nevertheless \ndismiss the claim because an extension of the Bivens remedy to this “new context” is unwarranted.  \nZiglar v. Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1859 (2017).   \nThe Supreme Court has set forth a two-step inquiry that governs whether an extension of \nBivens is appropriate.  First, a court must “inquire whether the request involves a claim that arises \nin a new context or involves a new category of defendants.”  Hernandez v. Mesa, 140 S. Ct. 735, \n743 (2020) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  The Supreme Court’s understanding \nof what constitutes “a new context” is “broad.”  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  The test is \nwhether “the case is different in a meaningful way from previous Bivens cases” decided by the \nSupreme Court.  Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1859.  Second, if the claim arises in a new context, the \nBivens claim must be rejected if there are “special factors indicating that the Judiciary is at least \narguably less equipped than Congress to weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action \nto proceed.”  Egbert v. Boule, 142 S. Ct. 1793, 1803 (2022) (citation and internal quotation marks \n \n19 As noted, § 1809 includes a statutory defense to prosecution if “the defendant was a law \nenforcement or investigative officer engaged in the course of his official duties and the electronic \nsurveillance was authorized by and conducted pursuant to a search warrant or court order of a court \nof competent jurisdiction.” 50 U.S.C. § 1809(b).   \n35 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  3369  ooff  5648\nomitted).  A court cannot recognize a Bivens remedy “[i]f there is even a single reason to pause” \nbefore applying it in a new context.  Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Page’s \nclaims arise in a new context, and there are several reasons to pause.   \nPage’s Bivens claim presents a new context because it is based on unlawfully obtained \nFISA warrants. SAC ¶ 287.  Although Page, like the plaintiff in Bivens, alleges a Fourth \nAmendment violation as the basis for his constitutional claim, see 403 U.S. at 389, “[a] claim may \narise in a new context even if it is based on the same constitutional provision as a claim in a case \nin which a damages remedy was previously recognized,” Hernandez, 140 S. Ct. at 743.  In Bivens, \nthe Supreme Court created an implied damages remedy under the Fourth Amendment for an \nallegedly unconstitutional search and arrest carried out in an apartment.  403 U.S. at 389.  But as \nthe Fourth Circuit has recognized, “a claim based on unlawful electronic surveillance presents \nwildly different facts and a vastly different statutory framework from a warrantless search and \narrest.”  Attkisson v. Holder, 925 F.3d 606, 621 (4th Cir. 2019).  And here, some of the defendants, \nsuch as Comey and McCabe, are high-ranking officials, unlike the “line-level” agents sued in \nBivens.  Id.  In this case, both the nature of Page’s Fourth Amendment claim and the “rank of the \nofficers involved,” Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1860, signal a new context.    \nSpecial factors also counsel against creating a Bivens remedy in this new context.  Page’s \nsurveillance occurred as part of a high-level investigation into alleged foreign interference in a \npresidential election.  SAC ¶¶ 5–6, 221, 224.  “[A] Bivens cause of action may not lie where, as \nhere, national security is at issue.”  Egbert, 142 S. Ct. at 1805.  Plus, a court cannot extend Bivens \nif Congress has already provided “an alternative remedial structure.”  Id. at 1804 (quoting Abbasi, \n137 S. Ct. at 1858).  Congress has comprehensively legislated in the electronic surveillance space \n“without authorizing damages for a Fourth Amendment violation.”  Attkisson, 925 F.3d at 621.  It \n36 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  3470  ooff  5648\nhas instead created several private causes of actions under a number of statutes governing \nsurveillance, including FISA, 50 U.S.C. § 1810, the Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2520(a), the Stored \nCommunications Act, id. § 2707(a), (g), and the PATRIOT Act, id. § 2712.  These alternatives \n“alone” are “reason enough to limit the power of the Judiciary to infer a new Bivens cause of \naction.”  Egbert, 142 S. Ct. at 1804 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  \n  Accordingly, the Court will dismiss the Bivens claim in Count Six against each individual \ndefendant. \nB.  Institutional Defendants  \nPage brings claims against the United States under the FTCA and the PATRIOT Act.  SAC \n¶¶ 275–282, 303–311.  He also asserts a Privacy Act claim against DOJ for failure to amend his \nrecords, id. ¶¶ 290–295, and a Privacy Act claim against DOJ and the FBI for unlawful disclosures, \nid. ¶¶ 296–302.  The Court will address each claim in turn.  \n1.  FTCA Claim  \nThe  FTCA “waive[s] the sovereign  immunity  of the United States  for certain  torts \ncommitted by federal employees.”  FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994) (citing 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1346(b)).  Federal courts have jurisdiction over these claims if they are “actionable” under \n§ 1346(b).  Id. at 477.  The claim must be  \n[1] against the United States, [2] for money damages, . . . [3] for injury or loss of \nproperty, or personal injury or death [4] caused by the negligent or wrongful act or \nomission of any employee of the Government [5] while acting within the scope of \nhis office or employment, [6] under circumstances where the United States, if a \nprivate person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the \nplace where the act or omission occurred.   \n \nId. (alteration in original) (quoting § 1346(b)).  Under the FTCA, “all elements of a meritorious \nclaim are also jurisdictional.”  Brownback v. King, 141 S. Ct. 740, 749 (2021).  Accordingly, for \n37 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  3481  ooff  5648\na court to have subject-matter jurisdiction, and “to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,” \nthe “plaintiff must plausibly allege all six FTCA elements.”  Id.   \nPage has not plausibly pleaded the sixth element: that the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable under D.C. law.  He alleges that the individual defendants committed an “abuse of \nprocess” by acting with an “ulterior motive to use the FISA warrant process to accomplish an end \nnot permitted by law: to obtain the surveillance of . . . Page and the Trump presidential campaign \nwithout probable cause.”  SAC ¶ 280 (emphasis omitted); see 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h).  Under D.C. \nlaw, however, abuse of process occurs when “process has been used to accomplish some end which \nis without the regular purview of the process, or which compels the party against whom it is used \nto do some collateral thing which he could not legally and regularly be required to do.”  Jacobson \nv. Thrifty Paper Boxes, Inc., 230 A.2d 710, 711 (D.C. 1967).  That an official has acted “spitefully, \nmaliciously, or with an ulterior motive in instituting” process is not enough.  Scott v. District of \nColumbia, 101 F.3d 748, 755 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Instead, the process must be used “for an \nimmediate purpose other than that for which it was designed and intended.”   Id. (quoting \nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 682 cmt. b).  For example, “[t]he usual case of abuse of process \nis one of some form of extortion, using the process to put pressure upon the other to compel him \nto pay a different debt or to take some other action or refrain from it.”  Id. at 755–56 (quoting \nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 682 cmt. b).   \nHere, Page points only to the defendants’ “unlawful end” or “ulterior motive” “to obtain \nthe surveillance of Dr. Page and the Trump presidential campaign without probable cause.”  SAC \n¶¶ 16, 280 (emphasis omitted); see also Pl.’s Opp’n at 21, Dkt. 99 (“[The SAC] alleges that the \nGovernment’s agents perverted the FISA warrant process by making material misstatements and \nomissions to obtain four successive warrants without probable cause for the ulterior motive of \n38 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  3492  ooff  5648\nsurveilling . . . Page and the Trump presidential campaign.”).  As D.C. courts have held, that alone \nis insufficient to state a claim for abuse of process.  See Bown v. Hamilton, 601 A.2d 1074, 1080 \n(D.C. 1992); Scott, 101 F.3d at 755.  True, Page alleges that the defendants made false statements \nin the FISA application process so that the warrants would be granted in the absence of probable \ncause.  SAC ¶ 16.  But neither allegation suffices to state an abuse of process claim.  See Dormu \nv. District of Columbia, 795 F. Supp. 2d 7, 33 (D.D.C. 2011) (granting summary judgment for \ndefendants on an abuse of process claim even though the officers lacked probable cause to arrest \nthe plaintiff); Rauh v. Coyne, 744 F. Supp. 1186, 1194 (D.D.C. 1990) (explaining that abuse of \nprocess “does not arise from a misrepresentation to the Court”); Moradi v. Protas, Kay, Spivok & \nProtas, Chartered, 494 A.2d 1329, 1330, 1333 n.7 (D.C. 1985) (noting that the plaintiff did not \nstate a claim for abuse of process where (1) the defendant’s agent had “negligently or falsely \nswor[n] that he had served summonses” on him in three cases, (2) the defendant had then obtained \na default judgment and writ of attachment in each case, and (3) the defendant, knowing the plaintiff \nwas not served, had obtained a judgment of condemnation (internal quotation marks omitted)).  \nPage’s reliance on out-of-jurisdiction cases, see Pl.’s Opp’n at 21–22, cannot overcome \nclear authority from D.C. courts, as the proper inquiry is only whether a private person would be \nliable under D.C. law.  28 U.S.C. § 1346(b).  Page cites one D.C. case, Hall v. Field Enterprises, \nInc., 94 A.2d 479 (D.C. 1953),20 but it also does not help.  In that case, the defendants had \n \n20 Page also cites Whelan v. Abell, 953 F.2d 663 (D.C. Cir. 1992), and Neumann v. Vidal, 710 F.2d \n856 (D.C. Cir. 1983), but both cases “have been superceded by more recent decisions embracing \nthe more restrictive standard of” Bown, 601 A.2d at 1079–80, and Morowitz v. Marvel, 423 A.2d \n196, 198–99 (D.C. 1980).  Nader v. Democratic Nat’l Comm., 555 F. Supp. 2d 137, 161 (D.D.C. \n2008) (citing Moore v. United States, 213 F.3d 705 (D.C. Cir. 2000); and Scott v. District of \nColumbia, 101 F.3d 748 (D.C. Cir. 1996)).  In these cases, the D.C. Court of Appeals decided that \nsimply initiating a legal proceeding with an ulterior motive is in and of itself insufficient to give \nrise to an abuse of process claim; the process instead must be used to accomplish “some end not \n \n39 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  4403  ooff  5648\n“fraudulently”  and  “without  legal  justification”  filed  suit  against  the  plaintiff,  achieved  a \nfraudulent judgment, “without proper justification caused to be issued a writ of attachment \npredicated” on that judgment, and unlawfully seized his wages.  Id. at 480–81.  Initially, the court \nheld that these allegations stated an abuse of process claim.  Id at 481.  But later, on a second \nappeal, the court held that the plaintiff’s abuse of process claim failed because the process “was \nused for its legally intended purpose: to obtain a judgment against the plaintiff and to obtain \nsatisfaction of that judgment” by garnishing his wages.  Hall v. Field Enters., Inc., 114 A.2d 840, \n841 (D.C. 1955).  Here, too, the warrants were used for their legally intended purpose: to surveil \nPage.  See SAC ¶ 3. \n“[T]he gist of the [abuse of process] action lies in the improper use after issuance” of \nprocess.  Hall v. Hollywood Credit Clothing Co., 147 A.2d 866, 868 (D.C. 1959).  As noted, Page’s \ncomplaint does not allege that the defendants used the warrants wrongfully, “to accomplish some \nend which the process was not intended by law to accomplish.”  Hall, 94 A.2d at 481.  Instead, it \nmerely alleges that he was surveilled pursuant to the warrants, SAC ¶ 3, and such surveillance is \nthe “ordinary purpose” of a FISA order.  See Morfessis v. Baum, 281 F.2d 938, 940 (D.C. Cir. \n1960).  Although Page claims that the purpose of the surveillance was to monitor the Trump \ncampaign, the complaint does not allege that the agents obtained the warrants to, for instance, \nmonitor campaign staffers who were not the proper targets of the warrants.  Nor does it allege that \nthe defendants used the FISA process to “pressure [Page] into taking any action or prevent him \nfrom taking action, or to achieve any other collateral purpose.”  Scott, 101 F.3d at 755.  Because \n \ncontemplated in the regular prosecution of the charge.”  Bown, 601 A.2d at 1080 (quoting \nMorowitz, 423 A.2d at 198).   \n40 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  4414  ooff  5648\nPage has failed to allege an actionable abuse of process claim, the Court will dismiss the FTCA \nclaim in Count Five for lack of jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1). \n2.  PATRIOT Act Claim \nIn the PATRIOT Act, Congress created a civil cause of action against the United States to \nrecover damages for willful violations of certain sections of FISA.  18 U.S.C. § 2712(a).  As \nrelevant here, § 2712(a) allows a person to sue if he has been “aggrieved by any willful violation \nof . . . [FISA] section[] 106(a) [50 U.S.C. § 1806(a)].”21  Section 1806(a), in turn, states that \n“information acquired from [FISA] electronic surveillance” about “any United States person may \nbe used and disclosed by Federal officers and employees” without that person’s consent “only in \naccordance with [FISA] minimization procedures” and only “for lawful purposes.”  See also Fikre \nv. FBI, 142 F. Supp. 3d 1152, 1169 (D. Or. 2015) (listing the elements that a plaintiff must allege \nto state a PATRIOT Act claim for a § 1806(a) violation).  Before bringing an action under \n§ 2712(a), the plaintiff must first present it to “the appropriate department or agency” within two \nyears after the claim accrues.  18 U.S.C. § 2712(b)(1)–(2); see Schuler v. United States, 628 F.2d \n199, 201 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (interpreting identical language in the FTCA).  The claim accrues “on \nthe date upon which the claimant first has a reasonable opportunity to discover the violation.”  18 \nU.S.C. § 2712(b)(2).   \nThe basis for Page’s PATRIOT Act claim is that “the individual Defendants, acting in \nviolation of the FISA, obtained, disclosed, or used information obtained by electronic surveillance \nof Mr. Page knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through \nelectronic surveillance not lawfully authorized by the FISA.”  SAC ¶ 307.  But this language \n \n21 An aggrieved person can also sue for violations of 50 U.S.C. § 1825(a), concerning physical \nsearches, and 50 U.S.C. § 1845(a), concerning pen registers or trap and trace devices.  18 U.S.C. \n§ 2712(a).  \n41 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  4425  ooff  5648\nmerely restates the elements for a violation under § 1809(a), rather than one under § 1806(a).  And \nCongress did not include a sovereign immunity waiver for § 1809(a) violations.  See 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1810 (“an aggrieved person . . . shall have a cause of action against any person who committed \nsuch violation”) (emphasis added);22 Al-Haramain Islamic Found., Inc. v. Obama, 705 F.3d 845, \n851–53 (9th Cir. 2012) (Under § 2712(a), a plaintiff “can bring a suit for damages against the \nUnited States for [unlawful] use of the collected information, but cannot bring suit against the \ngovernment for collection of the information itself.”).  Thus, to the extent that Page brings a \nPATRIOT Act claim for the unlawful acquisition of information, the Court lacks jurisdiction to \nhear it.   \nRelying on the same allegations that underlie his “use and disclosure” FISA claim against \nthe individual defendants, Page presents several theories to support his PATRIOT Act claim: \n(1) the media leaks; (2) the use of the warrant results in renewal applications; and (3) disclosures \nfor a host of investigative purposes—to obtain other investigative measures against him or others, \nto  investigate  and  prosecute  others,  to  request  assistance  from  other  law  enforcement  and \nintelligence agencies, to include the information in government databases, and to justify his \nongoing surveillance to other officials.  SAC ¶¶ 229–230; Pl.’s Opp’n at 11–12.   \nAs an initial matter, Page failed to present his third theory (about other investigative uses) \nto DOJ when he filed his administrative claim on September 30, 2020.  See Gov’t Mot. to Dismiss, \nEx. 1 (Page Admin. Claim) to Ex. T (Don Decl.), Dkt. 88-22; see also Gov’t Mot. To Dismiss at \n55.  Page does not contest this fact.  See Pl.’s Opp’n at 9–19.  The Court therefore treats this \nargument as conceded and finds that Page cannot bring a claim based on the disclosure of his \n \n22 “Person” is defined as “any individual, including any officer or employee of the Federal \nGovernment,  or  any  group,  entity,  association,  corporation,  or  foreign  power.”    50  U.S.C. \n§ 1801(m).  It does not include the United States.  \n42 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  4436  ooff  5648\ninformation for other investigative uses.  Davis v. TSA, 264 F. Supp. 3d 6, 10 (D.D.C. 2017) (noting \nthat a court may treat as conceded arguments in a motion to dismiss that a plaintiff failed to address \nin its response). \nThe Court will not dismiss the remainder of Page’s claim as time-barred.  Although it is \ntrue that Page had notice of the alleged violations before September 30, 2018 (two years prior to \nhis administrative claim), see Gov’t Mot. to Dismiss at 47–50, the face of the complaint does not \nconclusively reveal when he could have reasonably discovered every alleged violation.  18 U.S.C. \n§ 2712(b)(2).  Simply because Page knew about the FISA renewals does not mean that he knew\nthat the applications contained FISA-obtained information.  At least at this stage, the Court cannot \ndetermine that Page’s entire PATRIOT Act claim has expired under the statute of limitations, and \nthus, it will not dismiss it on this basis. \nThe Court will, however, dismiss the PATRIOT Act claim on the merits.  First, Page’s \nmedia leak theory fails for the reasons described in Part III.A.1.iii.23  Section 1806(a) prohibits the \ndisclosure of information “obtained” from FISA surveillance, but neither the Post nor the Times \narticle revealed any results from the FISA warrants.  See SAC ¶¶ 221, 224; Gov’t Mot. to Dismiss, \nEx. F. (Wash. Post Article), Dkt. 88-8; Gov’t Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. G (N.Y. Times Article), Dkt. \n88-9.24  And Page does not point to any other media reports containing FISA information.  It is not\nenough to say, as Page does in his opposition, that it is “not clear what unlawful disclosures of \nFISA-related information were made to the reporters who wrote these articles,” Pl.’s Opp’n at 12.  \n23 For the reasons explained below in Part III.B.3.ii, the Court could also dismiss the media-leak \nclaim as time-barred, because Page knew of the alleged leaks by April 2017.  SAC ¶¶ 221, 224.   \n24 As explained above, see supra note 7, the Court may consider these articles, referenced in the \ncomplaint, in full, without converting the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment.   \n43 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  4447  ooff  5648\nTo survive a motion to dismiss, he must allege facts in his complaint that allow the Court to \nplausibly infer that the defendants disclosed FISA-acquired information.  He has not.  \n  Second, Page’s alternate theory that the defendants violated the PATRIOT Act because \nthey knowingly used the unlawfully obtained information from the FISA warrants to obtain later \nwarrants, SAC ¶¶ 229, 307; Pl.’s Opp’n at 13, rests on a faulty legal premise.  To plead a violation \nof the PATRIOT Act relying on § 1806(a), Page must allege that the FISA information was used \nor disclosed in violation of the statutory minimization procedures or for an unlawful purpose.  The \ncomplaint does neither.  SAC ¶ 303–311.  Page instead claims that the federal officers knew that \nthe disclosed information had been acquired through unauthorized surveillance.  See SAC ¶ 307; \nPl.’s Opp’n at 11, 13 (misstating the applicable standard for a PATRIOT Act claim based on a \nviolation of § 1806(a)).  This is an element of §§ 1809(a) and 1810—but not § 1806(a)—claims.  \nAnd Congress has waived the United States’s sovereign immunity for § 1806(a) claims only.  See \nAl-Haramain Islamic Found., 705 F.3d at 851–53.  The use of information knowingly obtained \nthrough unauthorized surveillance itself does not, as Page argues, see Pl.’s Opp’n at 13, qualify as \nan unlawful purpose.  Absent clear statutory language, which does not exist here, the Court rejects \nPage’s invitation to graft § 1809(a)’s elements onto § 1806(a).25  See Loughrin v. United States, \n573 U.S. 351, 357 (2014) (“[W]hen Congress includes particular language in one section of a \nstatute but omits it in another . . . this Court presumes that Congress intended a difference in \nmeaning.” (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)); Bates v. United States, 522 U.S. 23, \n29 (1997) (“[W]e ordinarily resist reading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on \n \n25 Page’s citation to legislative history is irrelevant.  See Pl.’s Opp’n at 13 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. \n95-1720, at 33 (1978), a Committee Report that discusses the criminal penalty in § 1809(a), not \nthe use of information provision in § 1806(a)). \n44 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  4458  ooff  5648\nits face.”).  The unlawful collection of information is not equivalent to using the information, once \nobtained, for an unlawful purpose, in violation of § 1806(a).   \nPlus, this theory rests on factually thin and internally contradictory allegations.  As \nexplained in Part III.A.1.iii, Page’s unadorned allegation that the FISA warrant results were used \nto procure the renewal warrants is undercut by his other assertions that the second application “did \nnot outline any foreign intelligence information that had been gathered during the first three \nmonths” and that the surveillance under each warrant produced “no evidence at all” that he acted \nas a Russian agent.  SAC ¶¶ 114, 123, 136; see also Pl.’s Opp’n at 13 (merely speculating that the \napplications included FISA-acquired information).  Taken together, these are not “enough to raise \n[his] right to relief above the speculative level.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.     \nFinally, Page offers no factual detail that supports his single, conclusory assertion that the \nUnited States has conceded that it has used and disclosed the FISA information in some ways \n“which were then specifically prohibited by the FISC.”   SAC ¶ 231.  He points to only one specific \nadmission from the government—that it lacked probable cause for the third and fourth FISA \nwarrants.  SAC ¶ 43; see also Gov’t Mot. to Dismiss at 58.  Beyond that, he does not identify any \ngovernment concessions about improper disclosures, failures to minimize, or violations of specific \nFISC prohibitions.  SAC ¶ 231.  Nor does he reference any filings before the FISC.  Id.  Without \nmore, the Court cannot plausibly infer from the complaint that the government used or disclosed \nFISA information in violation of the minimization procedures or for an unlawful purpose.    \nThe Court will therefore dismiss Page’s PATRIOT Act claim in Count Nine. \n3. Privacy Act Claims\n“The  Privacy  Act  regulates  the  collection,  maintenance,  use,  and  dissemination  of \ninformation about individuals by federal agencies.”  Wilson v. Libby, 535 F.3d 697, 707 (D.C. Cir. \n45 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  4469  ooff  5648\n2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see 5 U.S.C. § 552a.  An “agency that \nmaintains a system of records shall,” upon request, permit an individual to access and/or amend \nrecords pertaining to him.  Id. § 552a(d).  The Act also “requires that an agency ‘permit’ an \nindividual ‘who disagrees with the refusal of the agency to amend his record’ to request a review \nof that decision.”  Doe v. Rogers, 498 F. Supp. 3d 59, 71 (D.D.C. 2020) (quoting 5 U.S.C. \n§552a(d)(3)).  And it allows individuals to file a civil action for injunctive relief against the agency\nif it has “refuse[d] to comply with” a request for access or has made a final determination “not to \namend an individual’s record in accordance with his request.”  Id. §§ 552a(g)(1)(A)–(B), (g)(2)–\n(3).  The Act also sets rules for the disclosure of records contained in a system of records.  Id. \n§552a(b).  An individual may bring a claim for improper disclosure under § 552a(g)(1)(D) and\nreceive monetary damages if the agency acted intentionally or willfully.  Id. § 552a(g)(1)(D), \n(g)(4).   \nPage brings two counts under the Privacy Act.  SAC ¶¶ 290–302.  He seeks injunctive \nrelief to compel DOJ to amend inaccurate records, id. ¶ 294, and requests damages from DOJ and \nthe FBI for unlawful disclosures to media outlets.  Id. ¶¶ 297, 300.  The Court will address each in \nturn.     \ni. Failure to Amend\nAccording to Page, the Horowitz Report “contains numerous errors,” and he requests an \norder requiring DOJ to amend it to correct those unspecified inaccuracies.  SAC ¶¶ 250, 292–294; \n5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(A), (g)(2)(A).   \nAfter an individual requests an amendment of a record, the Privacy Act requires the agency \nto either correct any portion “which the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely, or \ncomplete,” or explain its refusal to amend.  5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(2)(B).  The individual can then \n46 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  4570  ooff  5648\nrequest a review of any refusal.  Id. § 552a(d)(3).  And he may sue after the agency makes a final \ndetermination  not  to  amend  or  fails  to  comply  with  the  statute’s  review  provisions.    Id. \n§ 552a(g)(1)(A).   \nThe  parties  disagree  about  whether  Page  has  properly  exhausted  his  administrative \nremedies for his failure to amend claim.  The government contends that the exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies is jurisdictional.  Gov’t Mot. to Dismiss at 29–31 (citing, e.g., Dick v. \nHolder, 67 F. Supp. 3d 167, 187 (D.D.C. 2014)).  Page argues instead that exhaustion is an \naffirmative defense that the complaint must reveal on its face.  Pl.’s Opp’n at 29.26   \nThe Court agrees with the government.  Under D.C. Circuit precedent, “[e]xhaustion of \n[Privacy  Act]  administrative  remedies  is  a  prerequisite  to  bringing  civil  suit  to  compel \namendment.”  Nagel v. U.S. Dep’t of Health, Educ. & Welfare, 725 F.2d 1438, 1441 (D.C. Cir. \n1984); see also Haase v. Sessions, 893 F.2d 370, 373 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (same for access claims).  \nCourts in this circuit treat Privacy Act exhaustion as jurisdictional.  See Barouch v. DOJ, 962 F. \nSupp. 2d 30, 67 (D.D.C. 2013) (collecting cases).  \n Page  nonetheless  asserts  that  he  exhausted  his  administrative  remedies  before  the \nHorowitz Report was publicly released.  SAC ¶¶ 233, 238–244.  In particular, in fall 2019, after \nthe Inspector General’s investigation was nearly finished and was about to enter the “review and \ncomment phase,” id. ¶ 237, Page sent multiple emails to DOJ, the OIG, and various officials at \n \n26 That is true for certain statutes.  See, e.g., Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 216 (2007) (holding that \nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act’s exhaustion requirement for prisoner actions under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983  is  an  affirmative  defense).    But  under  others,  exhaustion  requirements  may  be \njurisdictional, and a court will dismiss an unexhausted claim under Rule 12(b)(1).  See Thompson \nv. DEA, 492 F.3d 428, 438 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  The authority that Page cites in support of his view \nthat exhaustion is an affirmative defense appears to be an outlier and relies on a Title VII, rather \nthan Privacy Act, case.  Pl.’s Opp’n at 29 (citing Ramstack v. Dep’t of the Army, 607 F. Supp. 2d \n94, 104 (D.D.C. 2009)). \n47 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  4581  ooff  5648\nthose agencies asking to view and amend the “forthcoming report” pursuant to the Privacy Act.  \nId. ¶¶ 238, 240, 242, 244 (referring to three emails from October 10, 16, and 21, and “no fewer \nthan two emails” from September).  On October 16, a DOJ official responded that his request was \nunder review.  Id. ¶ 243.  And on November 12, Page was told only that he would not be contacted \nfor an OIG interview.  Id. ¶ 249.   \nPage received the final Horowitz Report when it was made public on December 19.  See \nid. ¶ 233.27  But Page does not allege that he has contacted anyone at DOJ to seek an amendment \nof the finalized Horowitz Report.  See generally SAC.  And the government offers undisputed \nevidence that he did not.  See Gov’t Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. DD (Malis Decl.) ¶ 8, Dkt. 88-32; Pl.’s \nOpp’n at 28–29 (not claiming otherwise).28  Thus, the agency has not been given the chance “in \nthe first instance,” Dickson v. Off. of Pers. Mgmt., 828 F.2d 32, 40 (D.C. Cir. 1987), to correct any \nportion of the final report that Page might identify as “not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete,” \n5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(2)(B)(i).  Without having asked DOJ to make “specific amendments” to the \npublic report, his amendment claims are premature.  Hill v. U.S. Air Force, 795 F.2d 1067, 1069 \n(D.C. Cir. 1986).   \nTo be sure, DOJ never informed Page of his right to appeal.  Pl.’s Opp’n at 29–30 (citing \nHarper v. Kobelinski, 589 F.2d 721, 723 (D.C. Cir. 1978)).  But he does not allege that he received \na denial (either for access or amendment) in the first place, a prerequisite for an appeal.  SAC ¶ 249 \n(quoting the November 12 response letter from the DOJ official: “This letter does not address his \n \n27 Page does not assert an access claim under the Privacy Act for the draft Horowitz Report.  See \nSAC ¶¶ 290–295; Pl.’s Opp’n at 28–38.  Nor does he seek damages for the agency’s failure to \nmaintain accurate records under 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(4), a claim that does not require exhaustion.  \nNagel, 725 F.2d at 1441 n.2.  \n28 The Court may consider facts in the record outside the pleadings to determine the exhaustion \nquestion because it must assure itself of its own jurisdiction.  Settles, 429 F.3d at 1107.  \n48 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  4592  ooff  5648\nrequests under the Privacy Act[.]”).  And “[t]he statute provides no exemption from administrative \nreview when an agency fails, even by several months, to abide by a deadline [to respond to an \namendment request].”  Dickson, 828 F.2d at 40 (plaintiff could not file civil action before appealing \nthe agency’s denial, even though the agency was late to respond to the request for correction).  \nTherefore, DOJ’s failure to fully respond to Page’s access claims does not excuse him from \nparticipating in the administrative process (which, in any event, he only initiated for the draft \nreport).  Plus, a review of Page’s email requests reveals that he did not ask for any specific \namendments to either the draft or the final report.  See Malis Decl. Exs. A–C (for example, asking \non October 10, 2019 to “review . . . the FISA abuse Inspector General report draft” for “accuracy \npurposes”).29  Thus, he never identified any inaccuracies in the report for DOJ to consider.   \nPage can still, however, request that DOJ fix any mistakes in the final Horowitz Report \nthrough the normal administrative process.  See Hill, 795 F.2d at 1071 (“[N]othing in our \ndisposition of this case prevents appellant from seeking to have his official agency records \ncorrected.”).  But, at least as of now, Page has not exhausted his administrative remedies.  Because \n“failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the Privacy Act is a jurisdictional deficiency,” \nsee Barry v. Haaland, No. 19-cv-3380, 2021 WL 1177798, at *7 (D.D.C. Mar. 29, 2021) (citation \nomitted), the Court will dismiss his Privacy Act claim in Count Seven for lack of jurisdiction.30   \n \n29 The Court may consider these documents to assure itself of its jurisdiction, see Settles, 429 F.3d \nat 1107, and because they are documents on which the complaint necessarily relies, see Hinton v. \nCorrs. Corp. of Am., 624 F. Supp. 2d 45, 46 (D.D.C. 2009).  See Sandoval v. DOJ, 296 F. Supp. \n3d 1, 12 (D.D.C. 2017) (considering the plaintiff’s administrative requests, produced by the \ndefendant, to determine whether he exhausted). \n30 Page’s earlier Privacy Act suit against DOJ does not affect the exhaustion analysis because that \ncase alleged different Privacy Act violations from previous years.  See Compl., Dkt. 1, Page v. \nDOJ, 19-cv-3149 (D.D.C. Oct. 21, 2019).    \n49 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  5503  ooff  5648\nii. Unlawful Disclosures\nPage also sues DOJ and the FBI for leaks of his information in violation of the Privacy Act.  \nSAC ¶¶ 226, 296–302.  He alleges that the defendants, including Comey, McCabe, Strzok, and \nLisa Page, unlawfully disclosed “the existence of the FISA Warrants, the contents of the warrant \napplications, and the results of the Warrants” to media outlets such as the New York Times, the \nWashington Post, and “possibly others.”  Id. ¶ 226.  The Court concludes that Page’s unlawful \ndisclosure claim is time-barred because he knew about the alleged disclosures to the media for \nmore than two years before he filed this action.   \n“Privacy Act claims for monetary damages based on improper disclosure . . . have four \nelements: ‘1) the disclosed information is a record contained within a system of records; 2) the \nagency improperly disclosed the information; 3) the disclosure was willful or intentional; and 4) \nthe disclosure adversely affected the plaintiff.’”  Doe v. DOJ, 660 F. Supp. 2d 31, 44–45 (D.D.C. \n2009) (quoting Logan v. Dep’t of Veterans Affs., 357 F. Supp. 2d 149, 154 (D.D.C. 2004)).  An \naction under the Privacy Act “may be brought . . . within two years from the date on which the \ncause of action arises.”  5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(5).  “[T]he cause of action does not arise and the statute \nof limitation does not begin to run until the plaintiff knows or should know of the alleged \nviolation.”  Tijerina v. Walters, 821 F.2d 789, 798 (D.C. Cir. 1987).   \nThe Privacy Act section of the complaint identifies only two media reports: the April 11, \n2017 Washington Post article and the April 22, 2017 New York Times article.  SAC ¶¶ 221, 224; \nPl.’s Opp’n at 39 (not identifying any other disclosures).  The Post article, which broke the story \nabout the FISA warrants, cites anonymous “law enforcement and other U.S. officials” for details \nabout the Page investigation.  SAC ¶ 221; Wash. Post Article at 2.  The Times article, which is \nmainly about then-FBI Director Comey, mentions Page only once.  Citing a “former senior \n50 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  5514  ooff  5648\nAmerican intelligence official,” it describes how Page’s trips to Russia “rais[ed] new concerns \namong counterintelligence agents.”  SAC ¶ 224; N.Y. Times Article at 11.31  The rest of the article \nwas  sourced  from  “interviews  with  more  than  30  current  and  former  law  enforcement, \ncongressional and other government officials.”  Id. at 2.  Page himself is quoted in both articles.  \nSee  Wash.  Post  Article  at  3  (explaining  that  the  FISA  surveillance  was  “unjustified”  and \n“politically motivated”); N.Y. Times Article at 11 (describing the Russians he met as “mostly \nscholars”).   \nPage certainly had “inquiry notice,” if not actual notice, of these articles, and thus the \nalleged leaks, when they were published in April 2017.  See Agelli v. Burwell, 164 F. Supp. 3d 69, \n75 (D.D.C. 2016) (Privacy Act claim may accrue before the plaintiff “acquires actual knowledge \nof the agency’s alleged misconduct”).  And nowhere in Page’s complaint or opposition brief does \nhe claim that he was unaware of the articles, or the potential leaks, at the time.  See generally SAC; \nPl.’s  Opp’n  at  39.    Therefore,  his  Privacy  Act  disclosure  claims  expired  two  years  after \npublication—on April 11 and April 22, 2019.  See Hill v. DOD, 981 F. Supp. 2d 1, 8 (D.D.C. 2013) \n(“Each disclosure of protected information represents a separate violation” that might trigger a \nseparate limitations period.).  This is true even though Page did not necessarily have “knowledge \nof the precise details of the disclosure.”  Id. at 7.  \nThus, contrary to his contention otherwise, Pl.’s Opp’n at 39, Page’s cause of action \naccrued, and the clock started to run, on April 11 and April 22, 2019, even though he did not then \nknow the identities of the leakers.  True, a Privacy Act plaintiff must eventually show that the \ndisclosure was intentional or willful, which may require knowing who leaked the information.  \n31 As explained above, see supra note 7, the Court may consider the Post and Times articles, \nreferenced in the complaint, in full, without converting the motion to dismiss into one for summary \njudgment.   \n51 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  5525  ooff  5648\nConvertino v. DOJ, 684 F.3d 93, 99 (D.C. Cir. 2012).  But a Privacy Act claim runs against the \nagency, so a plaintiff does not need to name the responsible individual to sue.  And more \nimportantly, while a plaintiff will need to establish more detail at the summary judgment stage, \nsee id., he does not have to “allege the full details of . . . a disclosure at the pleading stage.”  \nFeldman v. CIA, 797 F. Supp. 2d 29, 41 (D.D.C. 2011) (denying motion to dismiss where the \nplaintiff alleged that the record was protected by the Privacy Act and pled sufficient facts to infer \nits leak because various agency employees learned of its details though they had no connection to \nthe underlying investigation).  After all, “a plaintiff can hardly be expected to know the full details \nbehind an improper disclosure prior to discovery, since those details are most likely to be under \nthe  control  of  the  defendant,”  id.,  particularly  here,  where  the  articles  disclosed  sensitive \ninformation possessed only by law enforcement and intelligence agencies.   \nIn sum, Page’s complaint shows that he knew of the alleged disclosure violations in April \n2017, yet he did not file suit until November 2020.  It is evident from the face of the complaint \nthat the statute of limitations period ran in April 2019, well before Page filed suit.  See Kursar v. \nTSA, 751 F. Supp. 2d 154, 166 (D.D.C. 2010).  For this reason, the Court will dismiss Page’s \nPrivacy Act claim in Count Eight as time-barred.   \n*** \n \nAs alleged, the FBI’s conduct in preparing the FISA warrant applications to electronically \nsurveil Page was deeply “troubling.”  In re Accuracy Concerns Regarding FBI Matters Submitted \nto the FISC, Order at 2, Misc. No. 19-02 (FISA Ct. Dec. 17, 2019).  Indeed, the government has \nconceded that it lacked probable cause for two of the warrants.  In re Carter W. Page, Op. and \nOrder Regarding Use and Disclosure of Information at 2 (FISA Ct. June 25, 2020).  And the FISC \nhas found that the government violated its “duty of candor in all four applications.”  Id. at 3.  \n52 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  5536  ooff  5648\nSimilarly, Page alleges that the individual defendants intentionally provided false information and \nomitted material facts in all four applications.  SAC ¶¶ 16–20.  To the extent these allegations are \ntrue, there is little question that many individual defendants, as well as the agency as a whole, \nengaged in wrongdoing.  Even so, Page has brought no actionable claim against any individual \ndefendant or against the United States.   \nIn part, that is because Page faces at least three statutory roadblocks.  First, Congress has \nnot  created  a  private  right  of  action  against  those  who  prepare  false  or  misleading  FISA \napplications.  Both the plain language and the structure of FISA make clear that civil liability under \n50 U.S.C. § 1810 attaches only to those who conduct or perform electronic surveillance.  Second, \nCongress has not provided for damages claims against federal officers for constitutional violations \nstemming from unlawful electronic surveillance in the national security context.  And third, \nCongress has not waived the United States’s sovereign immunity for this kind of claim.  \nFor those claims that are available to Page under the law, he has failed to sufficiently allege \nor exhaust them.  He has not adequately pled that any FISA-obtained information was improperly \nused or disclosed.  To the extent that he has a viable claim under the Privacy Act, he has neither \nexhausted his administrative remedies nor filed a timely claim.  And his abuse of process claim, \nas alleged, is not cognizable under D.C. law.   \nWhen it comes to Page’s core claim—that the defendants misled the FISC to obtain \nsurveillance warrants without probable cause—the Court cannot create a cause of action that \nCongress did not enact.  “[P]rivate rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by \nCongress,” Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 286 (2001), and courts may not usurp that power \n“no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter,” id. at 287.  Any future remedy for these \nalleged FISA abuses must come from Congress, not this Court.   \n53 \n\nCCaassee  11::2200--ccvv--0033446600--DDLLFF      DDooccuummeenntt  111258      FFiilleedd  0092//0117//2223      PPaaggee  5547  ooff  5648\nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court grants the individual defendants’ motions to dismiss \nand  the  government’s  motion  to  dismiss.    A  separate  order  consistent  with  this  decision \naccompanies this memorandum opinion.   \n________________________ \nDABNEY L.

No. 20-cv-3460 (DLF) \nJAMES B.

Pl.’s Mot. for \nRecons., Dkt. 119.  For the reasons that follow, the Court will deny the motion. \nI. BACKGROUND1\nAs explained at length in the Court’s initial opinion, see Mem. Op. at 1–9, Dkt. 115, this\ncase arises out of various FBI agents’ alleged actions to obtain four successive Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act (FISA) warrants to electronically surveil Page during the Trump 2016 campaign, \ndespite there being no probable cause to do so.  Id. at 2.  Among other things, Page alleged that \nthe FBI used reports by Christopher Steele, who “was paid by the Democratic National Committee \nand/or the Clinton campaign to perform political opposition research,” as a basis to obtain the \nFISA warrants “without adequately investigating [Steele’s] reliability and motives.”  Id. at 2–3.  \nAnd as relevant here, the complaint alleged that Igor Danchenko, “one of Steele’s key sub-\n1 The Court assumes familiarity with the extensive discussion of the facts set forth in its initial \nopinion.  See Mem. Op. at 1–10, Dkt. 115. \n\nCCaasese 1 1:2:200-c-vc-v0-033446600-D-DLLFF    D  Doocucummeennt 1t 12287    F  Fileiledd 0 021/1/178/2/233    P  Paaggee 6 21  ooff  968\nsources,” provided information to the FBI that “contradicted key claims in Steele’s reports” but \n“was not reported” in the FISA applications.  Id. at 31. \nPage’s Second Amended Complaint brought claims under the FISA and Bivens against \nindividual defendants James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Kevin Clinesmith, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, \nJoe Pientka, Stephen Somma, and Brian Auten, all individuals who worked at the FBI.  Second \nAm. Compl. (SAC) ¶¶ 256–274, 283–289, Dkt. 73.  The complaint also listed John Does 1–10 as \nindividual defendants “whose identities or specific involvement in the conduct alleged in this \nComplaint may not yet be known to the Plaintiff.”  Id. ¶¶ 34–35.  Finally, Page sued the United \nStates under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) and PATRIOT Act, id. ¶¶ 275–282, 303–311, \nand DOJ and the FBI under the Privacy Act, id. ¶¶ 290–302. \nEach of the named individual defendants and the institutional defendants moved to dismiss.  \nDkts. 80–88.  The Court granted the motions.  See Order, Dkt. 114.  It dismissed the FISA, Bivens, \nFTCA, and PATRIOT Act counts for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).  Mem. Op. at \n34–35,  38–39,  43–44.    It  further  dismissed  one  Privacy  Act  count  for  failure  to  exhaust \nadministrative remedies, id. at 49, and the other as time-barred, id. at 50.  Although the Court \ndismissed all claims without prejudice except for the Bivens claim, the Court directed that the case \nbe closed.2  Order at 1.  On September 29, 2022, Page moved to alter or amend the judgment under \nRule 59(e) and for relief from the judgment under Rule 60(b) based on newly discovered evidence \nabout the FBI’s relationship with Danchenko.  Pl’s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. for Recons. at \n2–3, Dkt. 119-1. \n \n2 The Order constituted “[t]he dismissal without prejudice of [the] action (or ‘case’),” which “is \nfinal and appealable.”  Ciralsky v. CIA, 355 F.3d 661, 666 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (“That the dismissal \nwas without prejudice to filing another suit does not make the cause unappealable, for denial of \nrelief and dismissal of the case ended this suit as far as the District Court was concerned.” (quoting \nUnited States v. Wallace & Tiernan Co., 336 U.S. 793, 794–95 n.1 (1949)). \n2 \n\nCCaasese 1 1:2:200-c-vc-v0-033446600-D-DLLFF    D  Doocucummeennt 1t 12287    F  Fileiledd 0 021/1/178/2/233    P  Paaggee 6 32  ooff  968\nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS \nRule 59(e) permits a party to file a “motion to alter or amend a judgment . . . no later than \n28 days after the entry of the judgment.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).  “A Rule 59(e) motion is \ndiscretionary and need not be granted unless the district court finds that there is an intervening \nchange of controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or \nprevent manifest injustice.”  Firestone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (per \ncuriam) (quotation marks omitted).  A movant cannot use a Rule 59(e) motion to raise new issues, \ntheories, or arguments that could have been presented in the course of the litigation.  Banister v. \nDavis, 140 S. Ct. 1698, 1703 (2020); Fox v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 389 F.3d 1291, 1296 (D.C. Cir. \n2004).  Instead, such a motion “must address new evidence or errors of law or fact and cannot \nmerely reargue previous factual and legal assertions,” and it will be granted “[o]nly if the moving \nparty presents new facts or a clear error of law which compel a change in the court’s ruling.”  New \nYork v. United States, 880 F. Supp. 37, 38 (D.D.C. 1995) (quotation marks omitted).   \nSimilarly, under Rule 60(b), “the court may relieve a party . . . from a final judgment” on \ngrounds including “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect”; “newly discovered \nevidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a \nnew trial under Rule 59(b)”; “fraud . . . , misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party”; \nor “any other reason that justifies relief.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (2), (3), (6).  “[A] district court \nenjoys significant discretion in deciding whether to grant or deny a Rule 60(b) motion . . . .”  \nComputer Pros. for Soc. Resp. v. U.S. Secret Serv., 72 F.3d 897, 903 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Like Rule \n59(e), “Rule 60(b) is not a vehicle for presenting theories or arguments that could have been raised \npreviously.”  Walsh v. Hagee, 10 F. Supp. 3d 15, 19 (D.D.C. 2013) (quotation marks omitted). \n3 \n\nCCaasese 1 1:2:200-c-vc-v0-033446600-D-DLLFF    D  Doocucummeennt 1t 12287    F  Fileiledd 0 021/1/178/2/233    P  Paaggee 6 43  ooff  968\nIII.  ANALYSIS \nIn his motion for reconsideration, Page asks the Court to reopen the case to “correct \nmistakes of fact and law” and grant him “leave to amend his SAC” based on newly discovered \nevidence.  Pl.’s Mem. at 13–14.  He also requests authorization to conduct “targeted discovery.”  \nId. at 13.  The Court will address each in turn. \nA.  Reopening the case based on newly discovered evidence \nPage alleges that, after the Court’s opinion and order issued, new evidence came to light \nthat Danchenko was a paid source for the FBI from March 2017 to October 2020 and thus had \n“been paid to assist each of the Defendants’ perpetration of their illegal activities,” which the \ndefendants “conceal[ed] . . . from this Court throughout the course of the current litigation.”  Id. at \n2, 5.  Page understands this new information to imply that the individual defendants “deliberately \nput one of the fabricators of the Steele Dossier on FBI payroll in order to keep him quiet and further \ncover up the individual FBI Defendants’ misdeeds.”  Id. at 17 (emphasis omitted); see also id. at \n16–19.  Based on this new evidence, Page “moves the Court to alter and/or amend the final order” \ndismissing his Second Amended Complaint and closing the case.  Id. at 13. \nSuch relief is not warranted.  Troubling as the Danchenko allegation may be, it does not \n“compel the court to change its prior position” on any count.  Nat’l Ctr. for Mfg. Scis. v. Dep’t of \nDef., 199 F.3d 507, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  Rather, the alleged new evidence would not affect the \nanalyses dismissing the claims against either the individual or institutional defendants.  \nAs to the individual defendants, the new facts have no bearing on the Court’s rationale for \ndismissing the FISA claims.3  The Court reasoned that Page’s FISA claims “fail[ed] for two \nreasons”:  (1) FISA “does not allow for aiding and abetting liability,” Mem. Op.  at 19–20; and \n \n3 Page does not challenge the dismissal of the Bivens claims against the individual defendants. \n4 \n\nCCaasese 1 1:2:200-c-vc-v0-033446600-D-DLLFF    D  Doocucummeennt 1t 12287    F  Fileiledd 0 021/1/178/2/233    P  Paaggee 6 54  ooff  968\n(2) it applies only to those “who participate[] in collecting the target’s communications using \ncertain devices,” which Page’s complaint did not allege for any individual defendant, id. at 26, 28–\n29.  Even assuming the new allegations about a coverup involving Danchenko are true, those two \nlegal conclusions remain unaffected.  While Page suggests that the Danchenko evidence supports \na “civil conspiracy” theory of liability, see Pl.’s Reply at 4–5, Dkt. 124, that argument fails for the \nsame reason his aiding-and-abetting theory failed.  Mem. Op. at 20 (“[S]tatutory silence on the \nsubject of secondary liability means there is none.” (quotation marks omitted)); see also Broidy \nCap. Mgmt. LLC v. Muzin, No. 19-cv-0150, 2020 WL 1536350, at *11 (D.D.C. Mar. 31, 2020), \naff’d,  12  F.4th  789  (D.C.  Cir.  2021)  (“The  same  principle  applies  to  bar  recovery  from \ncoconspirators . . . .”).   \nMoreover,  Page’s  assertion  that  Danchenko  himself  was  a  “device”  by  which  the \ndefendants collected communications, Pl.’s Reply at 17, is likewise unconvincing.  Page defines \n“device” to include “[a] scheme to trick or deceive.”  Id. (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary (11th \ned. 2019)).  But his definition is plainly at odds with the statutory language, which speaks of “the \ninstallation of . . . an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device,” 50 U.S.C. § 1801(f)(1), \n(4) (emphasis added), and the Court’s explanation of that term, which emphasizes that using a \ndevice “is distinct from the process of getting a warrant,” Mem. Op. at 22–23.  Therefore, even if \na coverup helped secure the warrants, it cannot be considered a “device” for purposes of FISA. \nAs to the institutional defendants, the new  evidence does not impact the statute of \nlimitations analysis for dismissing Page’s Privacy Act claim.4  See id. at 50–52.  The Court \nreasoned that Page knew about alleged leaks to media outlets “when [the relevant articles] were \npublished in April 2017,” even if “he did not then know the identities of the leakers” or details of \n \n4 Page does not challenge the dismissal of his other Privacy Act claim due to failure to exhaust.   \n5 \n\nCCaasese 1 1:2:200-c-vc-v0-033446600-D-DLLFF    D  Doocucummeennt 1t 12287    F  Fileiledd 0 021/1/178/2/233    P  Paaggee 6 65  ooff  968\nthe leaks.  Id. at 51.  Thus, the Court concluded, Page’s “Privacy Act disclosure claims expired \ntwo years after publication,” id., and his suit (brought more than three-and-a-half years later) was \ntime-barred.  Id. at 52.  Again, the Danchenko allegations are irrelevant.  Even if the new evidence \ndid show that the defendants engaged in “material and willfull [sic] misrepresentations,” Pl.’s \nReply at 23, those misrepresentations would not negate Page’s inquiry notice of any Privacy Act \nviolations when the articles containing alleged leaks were published.  See Mem. Op. at 51.  Page’s \narguments to the contrary reference the portion of the Court’s opinion discussing—and rejecting—\nwhether the FISA claims were time barred, see Pl.’s Mem. at 25–26 (citing Mem. Op. at 16), and \nare inapposite for the Privacy Act conclusion.5 \nTo the extent Page challenges the dismissal of the remaining claims against the institutional \ndefendants, see Pl.’s Reply at 12–13 (FTCA claim); id. at 18–22 (PATRIOT Act claim), he did \nnot raise those arguments in his motion and the Court will not consider “issues raised for the first \ntime in a reply brief.”  Rollins Env’t Servs. (NJ) Inc. v. EPA, 937 F.2d 649, 653 n.2 (D.C. Cir. \n1991).  And even if the Court did consider them, the arguments would fail for the same reason: \nwhether or not Danchenko was a paid FBI informant does not impact the analyses as to either \nclaim.  See Mem. Op. at 40 (dismissing FTCA claim because Page did not allege that “the \ndefendants used the warrants wrongfully”); id. at 41–45 (dismissing PATRIOT Act claim due to \nsovereign immunity, failure to exhaust, and failure to plausibly allege that the government \nimproperly “used or disclosed FISA information”). \n \n5 Page’s remaining arguments about FISA’s legislative history and statutory interpretation, see \nPl.’s Mem. at 20–23; Pl.’s Reply at 18–19, and the Privacy Act’s statute of limitations, see Pl.’s \nMem. at 26–27, are legal theories that “could have [been] raised before the decision issued” and \nthe Court will not address them now.  Banister, 140 S. Ct. at 1703. \n6 \n\nCCaasese 1 1:2:200-c-vc-v0-033446600-D-DLLFF    D  Doocucummeennt 1t 12287    F  Fileiledd 0 021/1/178/2/233    P  Paaggee 6 76  ooff  968\nBecause the newly discovered information about Danchenko would not “compel a change \nin the court’s ruling” on any claim, it does not support altering, amending, or granting relief from \nthe Court’s order dismissing Page’s complaint and closing the case.  New York, 880 F. Supp. at 38 \n(quotation marks omitted).  As a result, Page’s motion for leave to amend necessarily fails.  See \nPl.’s Mem. at 17, 19–20.  “[O]nce a final judgment has been entered, a court cannot permit an \namendment unless the plaintiff ‘first satisfies Rule 59(e)’s more stringent standard’ for setting \naside that judgment.”  Ciralsky, 355 F.3d at 673 (quoting Firestone, 76 F.3d at 1208 (alteration \nomitted)).  “Since the court decline[s] to set aside the judgment under Rule 59(e),” Page’s “motion \nto amend under Rule 15(a) [is] moot.”  Id.6 \nB.  Conducting targeted discovery \nPage also asks for discovery to enable him “to learn sufficient details to plead the relevant \ncauses of action.”  Pl.’s Mem. at 13.  Specifically, he seeks to uncover “[w]hat exactly the \n[d]efendants . . . disclosed to journalists,” “[w]hat . . . the [d]efendants kn[ew] about the partisan, \npolitical motivations of the surveillance of Page,” and the identities of John Does 1–10, “the \nindividuals who ‘engaged in’ the mechanics of the FISA surveillance.”  Id. at 24–25.  The Court \nwill deny these requests. \nFirst, Page has not provided grounds for this relief under Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b).  These \ndiscovery requests are not related to the newly discovered evidence, nor has Page identified any \n“intervening change of controlling law . . . or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest \n \n6 To the extent Page wishes to bring new causes of action, see, e.g., Pl.’s Reply at 14–15 (quoting \n42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)), the Court notes that his Second Amended Complaint was dismissed without \nprejudice to refiling a new suit.  See Order at 1.  Page has provided no argument or reason to \nbelieve that that dismissal unfairly prejudiced him due to, for example, a statute of limitations \nconcern.  See Ciralsky, 355 F.3d at 674 (remanding for the district court to consider “the [statute \nof limitations] consequences of denial” of a Rule 59(e) decision, but ultimately “leav[ing] the \nchoice entirely in the hands of the district court” (quotation marks omitted)). \n7 \n\nCCaasese 1 1:2:200-c-vc-v0-033446600-D-DLLFF    D  Doocucummeennt 1t 12287    F  Fileiledd 0 021/1/178/2/233    P  Paaggee 6 87  ooff  968\ninjustice.”  Firestone, 76 F.3d at 1208 (quotation marks omitted).  Rules 59(e) and 60(b) are thus \nnot the proper vehicle for these requests, which could have been presented earlier.  Id.; Walsh, 10 \nF. Supp. 3d at 19. \nIn any event, Page’s discovery requests fail for a second reason.  “A plaintiff may not ‘use \ndiscovery to obtain the facts necessary to establish a claim that is plausible on its face pursuant to \n[the] Twombly and Iqbal [pleading standards]—even when those facts are only within the head or \nhands of the defendant.’”  Ambellu v. Re’ese Adbarat Debre Selam Kidist Mariam, 406 F. Supp. \n3d 72, 83 (D.D.C. 2019), aff’d, No. 19-7124, 2020 WL 873574 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 14, 2020) (quoting \nFelder v. WMATA, 105 F. Supp. 3d 52, 59 (D.D.C. 2015)).  Page is not entitled to conduct “a \nfishing expedition” to discover new potential claims he may bring against the defendants.  Id. at \n82 (quoting Bastin v. Fed. Nat’l Mortgage Ass’n, 104 F.3d 1392, 1396 (D.C. Cir. 1997)); see also \nMama Cares Found. v. Nutriset Societe Par Actions Cimplifiee, 825 F. Supp. 2d 178, 184 (D.D.C. \n2011) (“[T]he discovery rules are designed to assist a party to prove a claim it reasonably believes \nto be viable without discovery, not to find out if it has any basis for a claim.” (quotation marks \nomitted)).   \nPage’s request for discovery to learn the identities of the John Does fares no better.  Courts \ndo sometimes allow cases to proceed against “‘John Doe’ defendants, but only in situations where \nthe otherwise unavailable identity of the defendant will eventually be made known through \ndiscovery.”  Newdow v. Roberts, 603 F.3d 1002, 1010 (D.C. Cir. 2010).  That exception is not \napplicable here.  Page’s complaint does not detail any alleged wrongdoing by the John Does.  See \nSAC ¶¶ 34–35 (stating that Does’ “specific involvement in the conduct alleged in this Complaint \n[was] not yet [] known to the Plaintiff”).  The complaint later states that unknown individuals \nengaged in surveillance of Page pursuant to the FISA warrants, id. ¶¶ 140–141, but makes no \n8 \n\nCCaasese 1 1:2:200-c-vc-v0-033446600-D-DLLFF    D  Doocucummeennt 1t 12287    F  Fileiledd 0 021/1/178/2/233    P  Paaggee 6 98  ooff  968\nattempt to link that action to any cause of action.7  Thus, this is a very different case from Malibu \nMedia, LLC v. Doe, 64 F. Supp. 3d 47, 48–50 (D.D.C. 2014), which permitted jurisdictional \ndiscovery “to learn the identity of putative defendants.”  See Pl.’s Mem. at 23.  There, the complaint \nplausibly alleged that John Doe violated the Copyright Act, and discovery was permitted to \nuncover his identity and ensure personal jurisdiction.  Malibu Media, 64 F. Supp. 3d at 48–50.  By \ncontrast, Page has not alleged any claim against John Does 1–10.  Thus, discovery would, once \nagain, “amount to nothing more than a fishing expedition” to uncover wrongdoing that he has not \nalready plausibly alleged.  Bastin, 104 F.3d at 1396.  Page’s “[m]ere conjecture or speculation” of \nwrongdoing by John Does 1–10 “is not enough to justify jurisdictional discovery.”   Malibu Media, \n64 F. Supp. 3d at 48 (quotation marks omitted); see also Landwehr v. FDIC, 282 F.R.D. 1, 4–5 \n(D.D.C. 2010) (explaining that plaintiffs could not “maintain their claims against the ‘Doe’ \ndefendants” given “the complete absence of any specific allegations against” them). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the plaintiff’s motion to alter or amend the judgment and for \nrelief from the judgment is denied.  A separate order consistent with this decision accompanies \nthis memorandum opinion.   \n________________________ \nDABNEY L.

No. 20-cv-3460 (DLF) \nJAMES B. COMEY et al., \nDefendants. \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nAs  part  of  its  investigation  into  the  alleged  connection  between  the  Trump  2016 \npresidential campaign and the Russian government, the Federal Bureau of Investigation obtained \nwarrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to electronically surveil Carter \nPage, an informal advisor to the campaign.  Page alleges that the surveillance was unlawful \nbecause the warrant applications were false and misleading.  He brings statutory and constitutional \nclaims against the United States, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and individuals who worked \nat the FBI.  Before the Court are the individual defendants’ Motions to Dismiss, Dkts. 80–87, and \nthe government defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, Dkt. 88.  For the reasons that follow, the Court \nwill grant each motion.  \nI. BACKGROUND\nA. Facts\n1. Operation Crossfire Hurricane\nOn July 31, 2016, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation named “Operation \nCrossfire Hurricane” to determine whether individuals associated with the Trump presidential \ncampaign were involved in coordinated activities with the Russian government.  Second Am. \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 2 of 54\nCompl. (SAC) ¶ 5, Dkt. 73.1  Plaintiff Carter Page, a “volunteer member of an informal foreign \npolicy  advisory  committee”  to  the  Trump  campaign,  alleges  that  he  was  targeted  in  this \ninvestigation.  Id. ¶¶ 5, 21.  According to Page, the FBI obtained four successive FISA warrants to \nelectronically surveil him, despite there being no probable cause to suspect that he was a Russian \nagent.  Id. ¶ 3; 50 U.S.C. §§ 1804(a)(3)(A), 1805(a)(2)(A).  \nAllegedly, defendant Stephen Somma, then an FBI counterintelligence investigator, was \nthe first to propose the surveillance of Page.  SAC ¶ 202.  After asking about the possibility of \nseeking FISA warrants, the FBI Office of General Counsel told Somma on August 15, 2016, that \nhe needed more evidence to establish probable cause.  Id. ¶ 203.  Meanwhile, on August 17, the \nCIA told the Crossfire Hurricane team that Page had been a CIA “operational contact” from 2008 \nto 2013 and had helped the agency combat Russian and other foreign countries’ intelligence-\nrelated activities.  Id. ¶ 11.  And on September 7, the CIA allegedly told defendants James Comey, \nthen-director of the FBI, and Peter Strzok, then-Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence, \nthat 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had approved a plan to connect Trump and \nRussian hackers in order to distract the public from her use of a private email server.  Id. ¶ 12.   \nPage further alleges that soon after, on September 19, the FBI received information about \na connection between the Trump campaign and Russia.  Id. ¶ 14.  Christopher Steele, a confidential \nsource for the FBI, provided two reports alleging that Page engaged in “improper or unlawful \ncommunications or activities” with “two sanctioned Russians with close ties to Russian President \nVladimir Putin.”  Id. ¶¶ 14, 74.  Steele was paid by the Democratic National Committee and/or the \n \n1 In deciding these motions to dismiss, the Court accepts as true all material factual allegations in \nthe complaint.  See Am. Nat’l Ins. Co. v. FDIC, 642 F.3d 1137, 1139 (D.C. Cir. 2011). \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 3 of 54\nClinton campaign to perform political opposition research.  Id. ¶ 9.  The FBI used his reports as a \nbasis to obtain a FISA warrant to surveil Page.  Id. ¶ 14.  \nAccording to Page, Steele’s reports were “essentially the exclusive source of information \nsupporting probable cause for the FISA warrant applications.”  Id. ¶ 15.  FBI officials allegedly \nchose to proceed with and rely on Steele’s information without adequately investigating his \nreliability and motives.  See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 15, 91, 157, 170.  And they falsely elevated Steele’s \ncredibility in the warrant applications and omitted facts that cast doubt on his claims.  See, e.g., id. \n¶¶ 17, 111.  At the same time, they never disclosed Page’s previous work as an operational contact \nfor the CIA in any of the four warrant applications.  Id. ¶¶ 17–18.   \nThe DOJ Office of Inspector General (OIG) later investigated and revealed the FBI’s \n“material failures” during this process.  Id. ¶ 42.  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n(FISC) has indicated that Page’s surveillance was “unlawful.”  Id. ¶ 50.  Indeed, the government \nhas conceded that it lacked probable cause to surveil Page under the last two warrants and also \nagreed to sequester information obtained from all four of the warrants.  Id. ¶ 48.  Below, the Court \nwill describe Page’s allegations about each warrant application, see infra Part I.A.2–5, and about \neach individual defendant’s actions, see infra Part III.A.1.ii.c.  \n2.  First FISA Warrant \nOn September 23, 2016, soon after the FBI received Steele’s reports, a Yahoo! News article \nrepeated the allegations that Page met with two sanctioned Russians, according to a “well-placed \nWestern Intelligence source.”  SAC ¶ 76.  Although Steele’s confidential source agreement with \nthe FBI prohibited him from talking to the media about the information he provided to the FBI, \nallegedly he was the source for the article.  Id.  A draft application for the first FISA warrant \nacknowledged that he was the source for the article, though the draft was later changed to say that \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 4 of 54\nSteele’s business associate or client gave the information.  Id. ¶ 80.  The final version of the warrant \napplication cited the Yahoo article as corroboration for Steele’s allegations, even though he was \nthe source for both.  Id. ¶¶ 78, 80.   \nTwo days after publication of the Yahoo article, Page sent a letter to Comey denying that \nhe had contact with the sanctioned Russians and explaining his long history of interactions with \nthe CIA and the FBI.  Id. ¶ 81.  Comey gave the letter to the Crossfire Hurricane team and its \nsupervisor, Strzok.  Id.  Around the same time, Page told Stefan Halper, another FBI confidential \nsource, that he was never involved with Russia on behalf of the Trump campaign.  Id. ¶ 86.  This \nwas consistent with statements that other witnesses made during FBI interviews.  Id. ¶¶ 85, 87.  \nAllegedly, Page’s denials were never disclosed by the FBI to DOJ attorneys.  Id. ¶ 86.  Meanwhile, \neven though a DOJ attorney asked Somma whether Page was ever a source for the CIA, Somma \ndid not mention Page’s years as a CIA operational contact.  Id. ¶¶ 11, 72, 84, 205.   \n  Page alleges that in early October, a DOJ attorney learned that Steele was performing \npolitical opposition research and thus grew concerned about his credibility.  Id. ¶ 89.  Strzok \nbriefed Comey and defendant Andrew McCabe, then-Deputy Director of the FBI, about these \nconcerns, but they “brushed [them] aside” and urged DOJ to move forward with the warrant \napplication.  Id. ¶ 91.  Defendant Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer, told the DOJ attorney that Comey and \nMcCabe had approved the decision to apply for the warrant; she also told McCabe that a “high-\nlevel push” might be necessary to get it approved.  Id.  After the DOJ attorney asked the FBI \nwhether Steele had ties to any political campaign, a footnote was added to the application that \nindicated that Steele was hired to perform political opposition research.  Id. ¶¶ 89–92.  The footnote \ndid not, however, reveal that Steele was paid with Democratic National Committee funds, a fact \nallegedly known to senior DOJ and FBI officials.  Id. ¶¶ 93, 96.   \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 5 of 54\n  The warrant application was submitted to the FISC on October 21, 2016.  Id. ¶ 95.  \nDefendant Joe Pientka III, an FBI supervisory special agent on the Crossfire Hurricane team, \nsigned the authorization for its submission.  Id. ¶ 198.  Comey signed the warrant application.  Id. \n¶ 150.  Based on Steele’s reports, the application claimed that Page met with at least two Russian \nofficials during a July 2016 trip to Russia.  Id. ¶ 95.  Allegedly, Pientka did not verify or correct \nthe application’s false statement that “Steele’s reporting had been corroborated and used in \ncriminal proceedings.”  Id. ¶ 199.  Nor did he confirm, as FBI policy required, that Steele’s FBI \nhandling agent had reviewed and approved the application’s content.  Id.  In fact, Page alleges that \nthe handling agent had not done so because Somma failed to seek his review.  Id. ¶ 206.  According \nto the complaint, the application failed to disclose (1) Steele’s funding source, (2) Page’s work as \na CIA operational contact, or (3) a witness’s exculpatory statement that no one in the Trump \ncampaign coordinated with Russia.  Id. ¶¶ 87, 95–96.  Further, it did not contain a “cautionary \nwarning to be vigilant against politically motivated false reports” regarding Russia.  Id. ¶ 95.   \n3.  Second FISA Warrant \nOn October 31, 2016, Mother Jones published a story about Steele’s reports to the FBI.  Id. \n¶ 101.  After Steele admitted that he was the source for the story, his FBI handling agent told him \nto stop collecting information for the FBI and that it was unlikely that the agency would continue \nto work with him.  Id. ¶¶ 101–103.  On November 17, the FBI closed Steele as a source “for cause.”  \nId.  ¶ 104.    FBI  officials  including  Strzok  and  defendant  Brian  Auten,  an  FBI  supervisory \nintelligence analyst on the Crossfire Hurricane team, investigated Steele’s credibility during trips \nto London in November and December; several former colleagues reported on Steele’s poor \njudgment and habit of pursuing politically risky people.  Id. ¶¶ 105, 174–175, 180.  Allegedly, Lisa \nPage, Strzok, Pientka, and other FBI personnel then learned more about Steele’s anti-Trump bias \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 6 of 54\nfrom DOJ official Bruce Ohr, who told them that Steele’s reports were being relayed to the Clinton \ncampaign.  Id. ¶ 106.   \nYet the FBI continued to receive information from Steele through various intermediaries.  \nId. ¶¶ 107–108.  And his reliability continued to be called into question.  Page further alleges that \nafter Pientka and Somma received information from the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State that \ncast doubt on some of Steele’s claims, no one from the Crossfire Hurricane team followed up with \nher to learn more.  Id. ¶ 109.  The FBI also learned in December that one of Steele’s sources was \npossibly a Russian spy and intelligence officer.  Id. ¶ 110.   \nThe second warrant application to surveil Page was submitted to the FISC on January 12, \n2017, also signed by Comey.  Id. ¶¶ 111, 152.  It acknowledged that the FBI’s relationship with \nSteele was “suspended.”  Id. ¶ 111.  But according to Page, it asserted, falsely, that Steele’s \ninformation  was  reliable  because  earlier  reporting  had  been  verified  and  used  in  criminal \nproceedings.  Id.  The application did not mention Steele’s questionable credibility due to his \npolitical motivations and the fact that one of his sources was a possible Russian intelligence officer.  \nId. ¶¶ 112–113.  Nor did it include “any foreign intelligence information that had been gathered \nduring the first three months” of Page’s surveillance, as none had been produced.  Id. ¶¶ 114–115.   \n4.  Third FISA Warrant \nIn late January 2017, the FBI, including Auten and Somma, interviewed Igor Danchenko, \none of Steele’s sources, for information about Page.  Id. ¶¶ 120, 184, 209.  The complaint alleges \nthat  Danchenko’s  statements  “contradicted  or  undermined”  the  allegations  that  Steele  had \nattributed to him.  Id.  And in March, two FBI agents, including Somma, conducted an “ambush \ninterview” of Page.  Id. ¶¶ 122, 210.  They interviewed him four more times that month, and the \ninformation he provided did not support the contention that he was a Russian agent.  Id. ¶ 121.   \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 7 of 54\nThe third warrant application was submitted to the FISC on April 7, 2017, again signed by \nComey, who was aware of the results of the Danchenko interview.  Id. ¶¶ 122, 153.  The application \nstated that Danchenko was “truthful and cooperative,” but allegedly did not disclose that his \nanswers contradicted Steele’s allegations.  Id. ¶ 121.  And it claimed that the requested warrant \nwould “continue to produce foreign intelligence information,” even though no such evidence had \nbeen revealed in the past six months of surveillance.  Id. ¶ 123.  DOJ has since conceded to the \nFISC that it lacked probable cause when it sought the third warrant.  Id. ¶ 119. \n5.  Fourth FISA Warrant  \nBefore the submission of the fourth warrant application, Page publicly stated that he had \npreviously assisted the U.S. government.  Id. ¶ 129.  Accordingly, the affiant for the fourth \napplication asked defendant Kevin Clinesmith, then-FBI assistant general counsel, whether Page \nhad ever been a source for the CIA.  Id.  On June 15, a CIA liaison told Clinesmith in an email that \nPage had been a CIA source.  Id. ¶ 130.  Thereafter, Clinesmith falsely told the affiant that Page \nhad been a “sub source” but “never a source.”  Id. ¶ 131.  When the affiant asked for proof in \nwriting, Clinesmith altered the email from the CIA liaison to state that Page was “not a [CIA] \nsource.”  Id.2  Relying on this email, the affiant signed the application.  Id. ¶ 132.   \nThe fourth warrant application was submitted to the FISC on June 29, 2017 and signed by \nMcCabe.  Id. ¶¶ 133, 163.  Again, it did not disclose Page’s status as a CIA operational contact or \nthe results of the Danchenko interviews.  Id. ¶¶ 134–135.  It also asserted that the warrant would \n“continue to produce foreign intelligence information,” despite, as Page alleges, the lack of any \nsuch information produced during the previous nine months of surveillance.  Id. ¶ 136.  DOJ has \n \n2 On August 19, 2020, Clinesmith pled guilty to making a false statement under 18 U.S.C. \n§ 1001(a)(3).  SAC ¶ 131; see United States v. Clinesmith, Minute Entry, No. 20-cr-165 (D.D.C. \nAug. 19, 2020).   \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 8 of 54\nsince conceded to the FISC that it lacked probable cause when it sought the fourth warrant.  Id. \n¶ 127.   \nPage claims that the defendants, in seeking these four warrants, failed to comply with the \nFISA statute, FISC rules, and FBI policies.  Id. ¶¶ 52–62.  He also alleges that the defendants, after \nunlawfully  obtaining  the  four  warrants  and  thus  his  electronic  communications,  “used  and \ndisclosed” them to obtain the subsequent warrants, to “unlawfully pursue investigative ends,” and \nto leak information to the media.  Id. ¶¶ 140–142.  According to Page, the United States has \nconceded in filings with the FISC that it has used and disclosed information obtained from the \nwarrants in ways prohibited by that court.  Id. ¶ 231.   \n6.  Media coverage and investigation  \nOn April 11, 2017, the Washington Post first reported about the FISA warrants obtained to \nsurveil Page.  Id. ¶ 221.  The investigation of Page, it explained, was part of the FBI’s Russia probe \nthat had begun in July 2016.  Id.  The article revealed that a FISA warrant had been issued in 2016 \nand renewed at least once, based on a “lengthy declaration” with evidence that Page was a Russian \nagent.  Id.  It also mentioned Page’s alleged meeting with one of the two sanctioned Russians, as \ndisclosed by the Steele report.  Id.  Soon after, a New York Times article reported about the Russia \nprobe and the Steele dossier, briefly discussing Page’s alleged Russia ties.  Id. ¶ 224.  Lisa Page \nand Strzok exchanged texts about these articles.  Id. ¶¶ 220, 222–223, 225.  The complaint further \nalleges that they collaborated to leak protected information about Carter Page to the media, see id., \nand that McCabe approved this plan, id. ¶ 225.   \nThe DOJ OIG began investigating the Page warrants in March 2018.  Id. ¶ 232.  On \nDecember 9, 2019, the OIG released the Horowitz Report, which revealed that the FISA warrants \nlacked probable cause and were “unlawfully obtained.”  Id. ¶ 233.  In the months before the report’s \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 9 of 54\nrelease, the OIG provided it to some of the defendants in this case for review and comment.  Id. \n¶ 234.  During this time, Page sent numerous emails to DOJ and the OIG, asserting his right under \nthe Privacy Act to review and amend the forthcoming report.  Id. ¶¶ 238, 240, 242, 244.  But his \nrequests went largely unanswered; the OIG general counsel told him only that the OIG would not \ncontact him for an interview.  Id. ¶ 249.  Page alleges that the Horowitz Report contains numerous \nerrors that he has “a right to have amended.”  Id. ¶ 250.   \nB.  Procedural History \nOn November 27, 2020, Page filed suit, bringing claims against individual, institutional, \nand unknown defendants.  See Compl., Dkt. 1.  He brought claims under FISA, 50 U.S.C. § 1810, \nand Bivens against defendants Comey, McCabe, Clinesmith, Strzok, Lisa Page, Pientka, Somma, \nand Auten.  Id. ¶¶ 216–234, 243–250; see also SAC ¶¶ 256–274, 283–289.  He sued the United \nStates under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), Compl. ¶¶ 235–242; see also SAC ¶¶ 275–282, \nand DOJ and the FBI under the Privacy Act, Compl. ¶¶ 251–263; see also SAC ¶¶ 290–302.  He \nfiled an Amended Complaint on April 15, 2021.  Am. Compl., Dkt. 51.   \nMeanwhile, Page was in the process of exhausting his administrative remedies under the \nPATRIOT Act.  SAC ¶ 306; 18 U.S.C. § 2712(b)(1).  He presented an administrative claim to DOJ \non September 30, 2020, which was denied on April 22, 2021.  SAC ¶ 306.  Accordingly, Page \nfiled his Second Amended Complaint on June 8, 2021, adding a claim against the United States \nfor a violation of the PATRIOT Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2712.  Id. ¶¶ 303–311.   \nEach individual defendant separately moves to dismiss the FISA and Bivens claims.  See \nMots. to Dismiss, Dkts. 80–87.  The United States, the FBI, and DOJ move to dismiss the FTCA, \nPrivacy Act, and PATRIOT Act claims.  See Gov’t Mot. to Dismiss, Dkt 88.            \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 10 of 54\nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS \nRule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows a defendant to move to \ndismiss an action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).  Federal law \nempowers federal district courts to hear only certain kinds of cases, and it is “presumed that a \ncause lies outside this limited jurisdiction.”  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins., 511 U.S. 375, 377 \n(1994).  When deciding a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, the court must “assume the truth of all material \nfactual allegations in the complaint and construe the complaint liberally, granting plaintiff the \nbenefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged, and upon such facts determine \n[the] jurisdictional questions.”  Am. Nat. Ins. Co. v. FDIC, 642 F.3d 1137, 1139 (D.C. Cir. 2011) \n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  But the court “may undertake an independent \ninvestigation” that examines “facts developed in the record beyond the complaint” in order to \n“assure itself of its own subject matter jurisdiction.”  Settles v. U.S. Parole Comm’n, 429 F.3d \n1098, 1107 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).  A court that lacks jurisdiction \nmust dismiss the action.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), 12(h)(3). \nRule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows a defendant to move to \ndismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(6).  To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must contain factual matter sufficient to \n“state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 \n(2007).  A facially plausible claim is one that “allows the court to draw the reasonable inference \nthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009).  This standard does not amount to a specific probability requirement, but it does require \n“more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.”  Id.; see also Twombly, 550 \nU.S. at 555 (“Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 11 of 54\nlevel.”).  A complaint need not contain “detailed factual allegations,” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, but \nalleging facts that are “merely consistent with a defendant’s liability . . . stops short of the line \nbetween possibility and plausibility,” id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \nWell-pleaded factual allegations are “entitled to [an] assumption of truth,” id. at 679, and \nthe court construes the complaint “in favor of the plaintiff, who must be granted the benefit of all \ninferences that can be derived from the facts alleged,” Hettinga v. United States, 677 F.3d 471, \n476 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The assumption of truth does not apply, \nhowever, to a “legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  An “unadorned, the defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation” is \nnot credited; likewise, “[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by \nmere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”  Id.  Ultimately, “[d]etermining whether a complaint \nstates a plausible claim for relief [is] a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to \ndraw on its judicial experience and common sense.”  Id. at 679. \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nThe defendants seek to dismiss the complaint on statute of limitations grounds and for \nfailure to state a claim.  The United States also moves to dismiss the FTCA claim and one of the \nPrivacy Act claims on the basis that the Court lacks jurisdiction over them.  The Court will first \naddress  the  claims  against  the  individual  defendants,  followed  by  the  claims  against  the \ninstitutional defendants.   \nA.  Individual Defendants \nPage brings four counts against the individual defendants for FISA violations, one for each \nwarrant, under 50 U.S.C. § 1810.  SAC ¶¶ 256–274.  He also brings a claim under Bivens v. Six \nUnknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), seeking damages for \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 12 of 54\nalleged violations of his Fourth Amendment rights.  SAC ¶¶ 283–289.  The Court will address \neach claim in turn.  \n1.  FISA Claims \nFISA governs the procedures for “governmental electronic surveillance of communications \nfor foreign intelligence purposes.”  Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 402 (2013); 50 \nU.S.C. § 1801 et seq. (1978).  To obtain a surveillance order, a federal officer must submit an \napplication to a FISC judge that satisfies various statutory criteria.  50 U.S.C. § 1804(a)(1)–(9).  \nFor instance, the applicant must include, upon oath or affirmation, “a statement of the facts and \ncircumstances relied upon by the applicant to justify his belief that . . . the target of the electronic \nsurveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.”  Id. § 1804(a)(3), (a)(3)(A).  The \njudge shall approve the application if, among other requirements, “there is probable cause to \nbelieve that . . . the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign \npower.”  Id. § 1805(a)(2), (a)(2)(A).  The judge makes this determination “on the basis of the facts \nsubmitted by the applicant.”  Id. § 1805(a)(2). \nA person may be criminally liable “if he intentionally . . . (1) engages in electronic \nsurveillance under color of law except as authorized” by FISA, the Wiretap Act, and certain other \nfederal statutes, or “(2) discloses or uses information obtained under color of law by electronic \nsurveillance, knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through \nelectronic surveillance not authorized” by the same statutes.  Id. § 1809(a).  An “aggrieved person” \nhas a civil cause of action against those who violated § 1809(a).3  Id. § 1810.  Page alleges that the \nindividual defendants violated §§ 1809(a) and 1810 both by unlawfully engaging in electronic \n \n3 An “aggrieved person” is a “person who is the target of an electronic surveillance or any other \nperson whose communications or activities were subject to electronic surveillance.”  50 U.S.C. \n§ 1801(k).  \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 13 of 54\nsurveillance and using or disclosing the fruits of that surveillance.  SAC ¶¶ 260, 264, 268, 272.  \nThe defendants argue that these claims are time-barred.  Alternatively, each defendant claims that \nPage fails to sufficiently allege that he or she violated the statute.  The Court finds that the claims \nare not time-barred but that Page does not state a claim against any of the individual defendants.   \ni.  Statute of Limitations \nA statute of limitations defense may be raised in a pre-answer Rule 12(b)(6) motion only \n“when the facts that give rise to the defense are clear from the face of the complaint.”  Smith-\nHaynie v. District of Columbia, 155 F.3d 575, 578 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  When a “cause of action \ncreated by a federal statute” has no express limitations period, courts “generally borrow the most \nclosely analogous state limitations period.”  Graham Cnty. Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. \nUnited States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U.S. 409, 414 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In rare \ncases, courts borrow analogous federal limitations periods but only where applying the state \nlimitations period would frustrate federal policy.  Id. at 415; N. Star Steel Co. v. Thomas, 515 U.S. \n29, 34–35 (1995).   \nFISA’s civil cause of action does not contain a statute of limitations.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1810.  \nThe Court cannot locate, and the parties do not provide, any case that has decided the appropriate \nstatute of limitations for a FISA claim.  The parties disagree over the proper statute of limitations \nperiod.  The defendants argue that Page’s FISA claim is most analogous to libel, slander, or \ninvasion of privacy, so D.C.’s one-year limitations period should apply.4  See D.C. Code § 12-\n301(4) (libel or slander); Greenpeace, Inc. v. Dow Chem. Co., 97 A.3d 1053, 1061–62 (D.C. 2014) \n \n4 See McCabe Mot. to Dismiss at 24–25 & n.9, Dkt. 80; Clinesmith Mot. to Dismiss at 15, Dkt. \n81; Strzok Mot. to Dismiss at 9, Dkt. 82; Lisa Page Mot. to Dismiss at 15, Dkt. 83; Pientka Mot. \nto Dismiss at 7, Dkt. 84; Somma Mot. to Dismiss at 10–11, Dkt. 85; Auten Mot. to Dismiss at 11, \nDkt. 86; Comey Mot. to Dismiss at 18, Dkt. 87.   \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 14 of 54\n(invasion of privacy).  Alternatively, they point to the two-year limitation for violations of the \nfederal Wiretap Act, see 18 U.S.C. § 2520(e) (running from “the date upon which the claimant \nfirst  has  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  discover  the  violation”),  and  the  federal  Stored \nCommunications Act, see id. § 2707(f) (running from “the date upon which the claimant first \ndiscovered or had a reasonable opportunity to discover the violation”).5  Page rejects these and \ninstead relies on the three-year limitations period that D.C. law prescribes for actions “for which a \nlimitation is not otherwise specifically prescribed.”  Pl.’s Omnibus Opp’n at 65, Dkt. 98 (citing \nD.C. Code § 12-301(8)).6   \nThe Court agrees with Page.  As a starting point, applying an analogous federal limitations \nperiod is the “exception,” and the defendants provide nothing to overcome “[t]he presumption that \nstate law will be the source of a missing federal limitations period.”  N. Star Steel Co., 515 U.S. at \n35; see also Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Assocs., Inc., 483 U.S. 143, 157–70 (1987) \n(Scalia, J., concurring) (questioning the legitimacy of borrowing analogous federal limitations \nperiods).  Looking to D.C. law, the residual three-year limitations period, see D.C. Code § 12-\n301(8), fits best.  Page’s claim is for an unlawful search, which is not akin to the intentional torts \nlisted in D.C. Code § 12-301(4).  Courts in this district, when borrowing analogous state limitations \nperiods, have applied the residual three-year period when the claim at issue does not resemble \nthose enumerated intentional torts.  See Bame v. Clark, 466 F. Supp. 2d 105, 109 (D.D.C. 2006) \n(applying the three-year limit to an unlawful search claim); Berman v. Crook, 293 F. Supp. 3d 48, \n \n5 See McCabe Mot. to Dismiss at 24 n.10; Clinesmith Mot. to Dismiss at 18; Strzok Mot. to Dismiss \nat 9; Pientka Mot. to Dismiss at 7; Somma Mot. to Dismiss at 13; Auten Mot. to Dismiss at 11; \nComey Mot. to Dismiss at 18.   \n6 McCabe and Pientka recognize that the three-year limitations period could apply.  See McCabe \nMot. to Dismiss at 24–25; Pientka Mot. to Dismiss at 7. \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 15 of 54\n56 (D.D.C. 2018) (applying the three-year limit to an unlawful search claim based on alleged \nfalsity in the warrant application); Lederman v. United States, 131 F. Supp. 2d 46, 61–62 (D.D.C. \n2001) (applying the three-year limit to First and Fourth Amendment claims).  Page’s FISA claim \nmore closely resembles these constitutional  claims, as he alleges “unwarranted government \nintrusion,” Bame, 466 F. Supp. 2d at 109, as opposed to a common-law intentional tort committed \nby “private persons,” see Lederman, 131 F. Supp. 2d at 61 (quoting Payne v. Gov’t of Dist. of \nColumbia, 559 F.2d 809, 817 n.32 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).  Accordingly, the Court will apply the three-\nyear time bar, meaning Page’s claim must have accrued on or after November 27, 2017 to be \ntimely.  \nFederal law governs the accrual of federal claims, and it specifies that the statute of \nlimitations begins to run when the plaintiff has a “complete and present cause of action.”  Loumiet \nv. United States, 828 F.3d 935, 947 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (citation omitted).  Federal courts “generally \napply a discovery accrual rule when a statute is silent on the issue, as [FISA] is here.”  Rotella v. \nWood, 528 U.S. 549, 555 (2000).  And “discovery of the injury, not discovery of the other elements \nof a claim, is what starts the clock.”  Id.; see also Sprint Commc’ns Co. v. FCC, 76 F.3d 1221, \n1228 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“Accrual does not wait until the injured party has access to or constructive \nknowledge of all the facts required to support its claim.”).  \nThe complaint reveals that, at the latest, Page learned about the FISA warrants when the \nWashington Post broke the story on April 11, 2017.  SAC ¶ 221.  The article disclosed quite a bit \nof information about Page’s claim: (1) the FBI and DOJ were involved; (2) the agencies convinced \na FISC judge that there was probable cause to believe that Page was an agent of Russia; (3) a \npartially unverified “dossier compiled by a former British intelligence officer” alleged that Page \nmet with a Putin confidant in Russia; and (4) a warrant issued in 2016 and was renewed at least \n15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 16 of 54\nonce.  Id.; see also Comey Mot. to Dismiss Ex. 5 (Wash. Post Article) at 2, Dkt. 87-7.  Plus, Page \nis quoted in the article, saying, “This confirms all of my suspicions about unjustified, politically \nmotivated government surveillance.”  Wash. Post Article at 3.7  He “dismissed what he called ‘the \ndodgy dossier’ of false allegations” and denied that he met with the Russian.  Id. at 4.  Accordingly, \nby April 11, 2017, Page knew that he was subject to surveillance by the FBI and DOJ, and he \nsuspected that the allegations, and the ensuing warrants, were baseless.   \nIn a typical case, that might be enough for a claim to accrue.  For example, in a medical \nmalpractice case, the claim accrues when the plaintiff knows that “he has been hurt and who has \ninflicted the injury.”  United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111, 122 (1979).  Accrual does not wait \nuntil he knows that “his injury was negligently inflicted,” because a “reasonably diligent” plaintiff \ncan “seek[] advice in the medical and legal community” and can thus learn “if he has been \nwronged.”  Id. at 122–23.  This holds true even where “a considerable effort may be required” to \ndetermine whether a claim is actionable.  Rotella, 528 U.S. at 556.   \nBut in some contexts, more is required before a plaintiff is deemed to be on notice of his \nclaim.  In Klein v. City of Beverly Hills, for instance, the plaintiff brought a § 1983 suit alleging \nthat police detectives obtained search warrants based on false statements and omissions.  865 F.3d \n1276, 1278 (9th Cir. 2017).  The court held that this judicial deception claim began accruing not \nwhen the unlawful search occurred, but rather when the underlying affidavit was “reasonably \navailable.”  Id. at 1278–79.  Without the affidavit, which revealed that the officers misled the \njudge, the plaintiff could not “discover the underlying illegality.”  Id. at 1279.  In order to ensure \n \n7 Page did not include this portion of the article in his complaint.  But because the complaint \n“specifically references” and relies on the article, the Court may consider it in its entirety without \nconverting the motion into one for summary judgment.  Banneker Ventures, LLC v. Graham, 798 \nF.3d 1119, 1133 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  Page does not object to the defendants’ reliance on the article.  \nSee Pl.’s Omnibus Opp’n at 64–67.  \n16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 17 of 54\nthat plaintiffs not file “unripe and factually unsupported” suits to “preserve their claims,” the court \nruled that “accrual need not begin at the time of the search” as long as “a diligent plaintiff has \npursued the underlying affidavit without success.”  Id.; see also Berman, 293 F. Supp. 3d at 56 \n(plaintiff’s claim for unlawful search based on a faulty warrant accrued the year that he learned of \nthe search and received a redacted affidavit, “including the portions with the statements that he \nnow alleges were false”).  \nSimilarly, the plaintiffs in Hobson v. Wilson alleged that they were victims of an unlawful \nFBI program that infringed their First Amendment rights.  737 F.2d 1, 38–39 (D.C. Cir. 1984), \noverruled  in  part  on  other  grounds  by  Leatherman  v.  Tarrant  Cnty.  Narcotics  Intel.  & \nCoordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163 (1993).  Because the defendants “offered no evidence of what \nplaintiffs could have done to find out more about their claims, short of filing suit,” the D.C. Circuit \nfound  that  their  claims  accrued  only  when  they  knew  both  that  they  were  targets  of  FBI \ninvestigation and surveillance and that the program was unconstitutional.  Id. at 35 n.107, 38–41.  \nAs the Circuit explained, a plaintiff’s suspicion or awareness of government surveillance or \ninvestigation, standing alone, “cannot conceivably constitute [actual] notice of possible” illegality, \n“without creating the anomalous situation of requiring persons to file suit on a hunch, only to be \ndismissed for failure to state a claim.”  Id. at 38–39.    \nThus, in the context of government searches and surveillance, the rationale for the typical \napplication of the discovery rule—that a diligent plaintiff, after discovering his injury, can gather \nenough information to state a claim within the limitations period—does not necessarily apply.  \nThis is especially true for FISA claims given the “secrecy shrouding the FISA process.”  United \nStates v. Daoud, 755 F.3d 479, 486 (7th Cir. 2014) (Rovner, J., concurring).  Indeed, when the \ngovernment notifies a criminal defendant that it plans to introduce evidence obtained from FISA \n17 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 18 of 54\nsurveillance of him, even then he is rarely given access to the underlying FISA application.  Id. at \n484 (majority opinion); id. at 490 (Rovner, J., concurring).   \nHere, the face of the complaint does not reveal when Page’s claim accrued.  Even though \nPage knew in April 2017 that he was under FISA surveillance and suspected that it was unjustified, \nit is far from clear that a diligent investigation would have revealed enough evidence of illegality \nto avoid “fil[ing] suit on a hunch.”  Hobson, 737 F.2d at 39.  The complaint does not allege that \nPage had access to the underlying affidavits.  See generally SAC.  Nor did the April 2017 \nWashington Post article describe the contents of the affidavits, and it is unlikely that Page would \nhave been granted full access to them.  See Daoud, 755 F.3d at 486 (Rovner, J., concurring).  \nThough his suspicions of unlawful surveillance did not trigger the need to sue, it did “require[] \nhim to make inquiries in the exercise of due diligence.”  Hobson, 737 F.2d at 35; see also Klein, \n865 F.3d at 1279 (the accrual date is delayed to a point after notice of the search as long as the \nplaintiff has diligently “pursued the . . . affidavit without success”).  It is unclear from the \ncomplaint what investigative steps, if any, Page took or could have taken after April 2017.  It is \npossible that he failed to search for the facts needed for his claim, or that he was adequately on \nnotice of his claim well before the release of the Horowitz Report on December 9, 2019, which \nPage contends is the proper accrual date.  See Pl.’s Omnibus Opp’n at 9, 67.  But at this juncture, \nthe complaint does not conclusively show that Page was sufficiently on notice of his claims before \nNovember 27, 2017.  Accordingly, the Court will not dismiss his FISA claims as time-barred and \nwill instead proceed to the merits.8 \n \n8 The defendants refer to materials outside the complaint to demonstrate Page’s knowledge of his \nclaims.  See, e.g., Clinesmith Mot. to Dismiss at 17.  Even if the Court were inclined to take judicial \nnotice, none of these documents shows that, before November 27, 2017, Page was on sufficient \nnotice of his claims so as to trigger accrual.   \n18 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 19 of 54\nii.  Engaging in Electronic Surveillance  \nPage alleges that “the individual Defendants and others, known and unknown to [him], \nengaged in electronic surveillance against [him] that was not lawfully authorized by FISA” and \n“aided and abetted one another in doing so.”  SAC ¶ 260; see also id. ¶¶ 264, 268, 272.  As an \ninitial matter, the Court finds, and the defendants do not contest, that Page’s surveillance, at least \nas alleged, was unlawful.  Surveillance pursuant to a warrant obtained without probable cause is \nnot “authorized” by FISA.  50 U.S.C. § 1809; see also id. §§ 1804(a), 1805(a).   The complaint \nalleges material errors and omissions in each application that plausibly misled the FISC into an \nerroneous finding of probable cause.  See, e.g., SAC ¶¶ 16–19, 42–46.  Indeed, the government \nhas already conceded as much for the last two warrants.  Id. ¶¶ 50–51.   \nBecause Page’s claims are rooted in FISA §§ 1809(a) and 1810, the Court must look there \nto determine if he has a cause of action against these defendants for the concededly unlawful \nsearches.  Section 1810 provides “a cause of action against any person who committed [a] violation \n[of § 1809],” which in turn prohibits “intentionally . . . engag[ing] in [unauthorized] electronic \nsurveillance,” § 1809(a).9  Therefore, the relevant question is whether the complaint adequately \nalleges  that  these  defendants  “intentionally  engage[d]  in  electronic  surveillance”  within  the \nmeaning of the statute.  Id.  Page argues that the defendants are liable as both aiders and abettors \nas well as principals, because they “supervis[ed],” “facilitat[ed],” “prepar[ed],” “approv[ed],” and \n“submit[ted]” the “false” applications, which   “cause[d] others to  physically engage in  the \nunlawful surveillance.”  See Pl.’s Omnibus Opp’n at 32, 34, 49, 51.  But his FISA claim fails for \n \n9 The Court addresses Page’s “use or disclosure” claims under §§ 1809(a) and 1810 below in Part \nIII.A.1.iii. \n19 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 20 of 54\ntwo reasons: § 1810 does not allow for aiding and abetting liability, and the phrase “engage in \nelectronic surveillance” does not cover any of the defendants’ alleged actions.  \na.  Aiding and Abetting Liability  \n“[W]hen Congress enacts a statute under which a person may sue and recover damages \nfrom a private defendant for the defendant’s violation of some statutory norm, there is no general \npresumption that the plaintiff may also sue aiders and abettors.”  Cent. Bank of Denver v. First \nInterstate Bank of Denver, 511 U.S. 164, 182 (1994).  Instead, courts presume that “statutory \nsilence on the subject of secondary liability means there is none.”  Owens v. BNP Paribas S.A., \n235 F. Supp. 3d 85, 93 (D.D.C. 2017) (quoting Boim v. Holy Land Found. for Relief & Dev., 549 \nF.3d 685, 689 (7th Cir. 2008)).  Neither FISA § 1809(a) nor § 1810 reference any form of \nsecondary liability.  Thus, the statute’s “plain language shows that Congress had one category of \noffenders in mind—i.e., those who directly” engage in unauthorized surveillance.  Council on Am.-\nIslamic Rels. Action Network, Inc. v. Gaubatz, 891 F. Supp. 2d 13, 27 (D.D.C. 2012).  Congress’s \nexpress inclusion of an aiding and abetting provision in another section of FISA, see 50 U.S.C. § \n1801(b)(1)(B), (E) (defining “[a]gent of a foreign power”), further indicates that it did not “intend[] \n§ [1810] to authorize civil liability for aiding and abetting through its silence,” Owens, 235 F. \nSupp. 3d at 93 (citation omitted).   \nPage offers little in response.  Because the criminal aiding and abetting statute, 18 U.S.C. \n§ 2, applies to criminal violations of 50 U.S.C. § 1809(a), he assumes that aiding-and-abetting \nliability also applies to the civil cause of action in § 1810.  Pl.’s Omnibus Opp’n at 16.  But \nCongress has not enacted an analogous civil aiding and abetting provision and instead takes a \n“statute-by-statute approach.”  Cent. Bank of Denver, 511 U.S. at 182–83.  And § 1810 makes no \nmention of aiding and abetting liability.  Moreover, courts, including this one, have held that \n20 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 21 of 54\nplaintiffs  cannot  bring  a  civil  action  using  a  secondary  liability  theory  under  the  Stored \nCommunications Act, which similarly incorporates that Act’s criminal provision.  See Gaubatz, \n891 F. Supp. 2d at 27; Broidy Cap. Mgmt. v. Muzin, No. 19-cv-150, 2020 WL 1536350, at *11 \n(D.D.C. Mar. 31, 2020) (collecting cases).  Thus, to state a claim under § 1810, Page must allege \nthat the individual defendants personally engaged in unauthorized surveillance, not simply that \nthey aided those who did.  See Cent. Bank of Denver, 511 U.S. at 177–78.   \nb.  “Engaging in Electronic Surveillance” Defined \nTo determine the meaning of the phrase “engage[] in electronic surveillance,” the Court \nstarts, as it must, with the text.  See Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997).  To \n“engage” means “to take part” or “participate.”  Engage, Merriam-Webster’s New Collegiate \nDictionary  378  (1977).    And  the  common  meaning  of  “electronic  surveillance”  is  akin  to \n“[e]avesdropping,” Electronic Surveillance, Black’s Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979), which in turn \nis defined as “listen[ing] surreptitiously to” or “observ[ing]” an individual in “a private place,” or \n“[i]nstalling or using . . . any device” to do so,” Eavesdropping, Black’s Law Dictionary (5th ed. \n1979).

More importantly, FISA itself defines “electronic surveillance.”  That definition \nincludes, as relevant here:   \n[T]he acquisition by an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device of the \ncontents of any wire or radio communication sent by or intended to be received by \na particular, known United States person who is in the United States, if the contents \nare  acquired  by  intentionally  targeting  that  United  States  person,  under \ncircumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a \nwarrant would be required for law enforcement purposes.  \n \n21 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 22 of 54\n50 U.S.C. § 1801(f)(1).10 \nThe statute’s criminal and civil liability provisions cover those who participate in the \nacquisition, by a particular device, of the contents of certain communications sent or received by \na targeted person.  The breadth of the phrase “engage in electronic surveillance” depends on the \nterm “acquisition.”  If it were understood expansively to encompass the entire FISA surveillance \nprocess, the statute could presumably provide liability for many different actors: those who took \npart in the decision to surveil (with or without a warrant), the preparation and submission of the \nwarrant application (if any), and the collection of the communications, among other things.  But \ntext, structure, and context point toward a much narrower reading.  See Robinson, 519 U.S. at 341. \n  Turning first to the text, the ordinary meaning of “acquisition” is “the act of acquiring,” \nAcquisition, Merriam-Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary 11 (1977) (emphasis added), not the \nprocess behind it.  That “acquisition” is followed in the statute by the term “by an electronic, \nmechanical, or other surveillance device” further indicates that its statutory meaning is tethered to \nthe actual collection of the communications by specified means, as opposed to the pre-collection \ninvestigation or authorization stage.  One who engages in acquisition is one who takes part in the \nact of obtaining communications by using a device.  See also 50 U.S.C. § 1810(f)(4) (“[E]lectronic \nsurveillance” also means “the installation or use of an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance \ndevice in the United States for monitoring to acquire information.” (emphasis added)).   \n  This narrower reading of FISA’s definition of “electronic surveillance” comports with \ncommon usage of that term.  “Surveillance” has long been understood to refer to the specific act \n \n10 While this first definition is relevant to Page as a “target[ed]” and “known United States person \nwho is in the United States,” id., FISA also includes three other definitions for “electronic \nsurveillance,” see id. § 1801(f).  Each of the other three definitions is similarly limited to the \n“acquisition by an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device,” id. §§ 1801(f)(2), (3), or \n“installation or use of an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device,” id. § 1801(f)(4). \n22 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 23 of 54\nof collecting information by listening to or watching someone.  See, e.g., Katz v. United States, \n389 U.S. 347, 354 (1967) (“The agents confined their surveillance to the brief periods during which \n[the  petitioner]  used  the  telephone  booth,  and  they  took  great  care  to  overhear  only  the \nconversations of the petitioner himself.” (footnote omitted)); Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S. 427, \n465 (1963) (Brennan, J., dissenting) (comparing “electronic surveillance, whether the agents \nconceal the devices on their persons or in walls or under beds, and conventional police stratagems \nsuch as eavesdropping and disguise”).  That activity is distinct from the process of getting a \nwarrant.  See, e.g., United States v. U.S. Dist. Court (Keith), 407 U.S. 297, 315 (1972) (addressing \nwhether  the  Fourth  Amendment  “requir[es]  a  warrant  before  [electronic]  surveillance  is \nundertaken”); United States v. N.Y. Tel. Co., 434 U.S. 159, 179 (1977) (Stevens, J., dissenting) \n(referring to “the Government’s application for permission to engage in surveillance by means of \na pen register”).  To interpret the phrase “engage in electronic surveillance” to include the process \nof getting the warrant would trample on this common understanding.  The application for an order \napproving electronic surveillance and the actual surveillance are not one and the same. \nOther provisions of FISA confirm this interpretation.  FISA defines “[a]gent of a foreign \npower” to include, among others, “any person other than a United States person who . . . engages \nin the international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, or activities in preparation \ntherefor . . . or knowingly aids or abets [or conspires with] any person in the conduct of such \nproliferation or activities in preparation therefor[.]”  50 U.S.C. § 1801(b), (b)(1)(E) (emphasis \nadded).  This language implies that “engaging in” an activity does not include preparing for it or \naiding the primary actors.11  And unlike that section, FISA’s liability provisions omit any reference \n \n11 The defendants point to the Supreme Court’s decisions in Southwest Airlines Co. v. Saxon, 142 \nS. Ct. 1783 (2022), and Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105 (2001), to support their \n \n23 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 24 of 54\nto preparation, aiding, abetting, or conspiring.  See Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 \n(1983) (“[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in \nanother section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and \npurposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.” (quotation omitted)).  \nFurther, the FISA application must state “the period of time for which the electronic \nsurveillance is required to be maintained,” 50 U.S.C. § 1804(a)(9), implying that the surveillance \nhas not yet begun.  In fact, Page’s complaint recognizes this distinction: it alleges that the \ndefendants “unlawfully obtained the four warrants” and then “used the warrants to engage in \nsurveillance of him.”  SAC ¶ 140.  And § 1809(b), the statutory defense for a § 1809(a) violation, \nrefers to “electronic surveillance [that] was authorized by and conducted pursuant to a search \nwarrant or court order of a court of competent jurisdiction.”  If engaging in electronic surveillance \nincluded the process of getting the court order, this sentence would make very little sense. \nFISA’s provisions detailing “minimization procedures,” 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(h), 1804(a)(4), \n1805(c)(2)(A), likewise confirm that “acquisition” is a specific, narrow stage in the FISA process.  \nMinimization procedures, which balance privacy concerns with “the need of the United States to \nobtain,  produce,  and  disseminate  foreign  intelligence  information,”  specifically  differentiate \nbetween the “acquisition,” “retention,” and “dissemination” of information.  See id. § 1801(h)(1).  \nIn the minimization context, “acquisition” refers to the actual gathering of information, for \ninstance, by “tapp[ing]” a switchboard line.  In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, 731 (FISA Ct. Rev. \n \nargument that the phrase “engage in” means “to do.”  See Rough Hr’g Tr. at 5–6, 10–12.  In both \ncases, the Court indicated that “engaged in” has a narrower meaning than other formulations, such \nas “affecting” or “involving.”  Saxon, 142 S. Ct. at 1789 (citing Circuit City, 532 U.S. at 118).  \nThese decisions offer limited support, however, because both addressed the meaning of “engaged \nin foreign or interstate commerce” under 9 U.S.C. § 1, which has a particular statutory history that \nis not relevant here.  See Saxon, 142 S. Ct. at 1789–90; Circuit City, 532 U.S. at 111–21. \n24 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 25 of 54\n2002) (“By minimizing acquisition, Congress envisioned that, for example, ‘where a switchboard \nline is tapped but only one person in the organization is the target, the interception should probably \nbe discontinued where the target is not a party’ to the communication.” (quoting H. Rep. No. 95–\n1283, at 55–56)).12  Acquisition thus refers to the information collection phase of FISA.  \nA helpful parallel can be found in the “physical search” provision of FISA.  Like an \nelectronic surveillance, a physical search can occur only after the FISC approves an application \nthat establishes probable cause that the target is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power.  50 \nU.S.C. §§ 1823(a)(3)(A), 1824(a)(2)(A).13  But a person is liable for an unlawful physical search \nonly if he “intentionally . . . under color of law for the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence \ninformation, executes a physical search within the United States except as authorized by statute.”  \nId. § 1827(a) (emphasis added).  Section 1828 allows “any aggrieved person . . . whose premises, \nproperty, information, or material has been subjected to a physical search” to sue “any person who \ncommitted such violation.”  Id. § 1828.  Congress thus created a remedy only against those who \nexecute, or “carry out,” the unlawful search, as opposed to those who procure the order that allows \nthe search to happen.  Execute, Oxford English Dictionary (2d ed. 1989). \n \n12 The government properly minimizes information during the acquisition phase if, for instance, \n“before  executing  the  FISC  order  the  FBI  verified  the  facilities  subject  to  the  approved” \nsurveillance and “subsequently, the collections were conducted during the approved times using \nthe least physical intrusion necessary.”  United States v. Turner, 840 F.3d 336, 342 (7th Cir. 2016).  \nOn the other hand, minimization at the retention stage includes “destroy[ing]” information that has \nalready been collected, if it “is not necessary for obtaining[,] producing, or disseminating foreign \nintelligence information.”  In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 717 (quoting H. Rep. at 56) (second \nalteration in original).  And at the dissemination stage, minimization requires “restrict[ing]” \ncollected information “to those officials with a need for such information.”  Id.  \n13 A “physical search” means “any physical intrusion within the United States into premises or \nproperty (including examination of the interior of property by technical means) that is intended \nto result in a seizure, reproduction, inspection, or alteration of information, material, or property, \nunder circumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant \nwould be required for law enforcement purposes[.]”  50 U.S.C. § 1821(5).   \n25 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 26 of 54\n  The Wiretap Act also serves as a useful comparison.14  A person violates the Act if he \n“intentionally intercepts, endeavors to intercept, or procures any other person to intercept or \nendeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or electronic communication” unless it is authorized by \nstatute.  18 U.S.C. § 2511(1)(a).  The definition of “intercept” is nearly identical to one for \n“electronic surveillance”: “the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or \noral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device.”  Id. § 2510(4).  \nBy prohibiting both intercepting (i.e., acquiring) and procuring another to intercept, the Act implies \nthat “acquisition” itself does not include a procurement component.  And unlike the Wiretap Act, \nFISA does not include the procurement phrase, supporting the conclusion that FISA covers only \nacquisition, not the procurement of others to acquire the target’s communications.   \nAccordingly, one who “engage[s] in electronic surveillance” under §§ 1809(a) and 1810 is \none who participates in collecting the target’s communications using certain devices.15  To be sure, \n \n14 The Wiretap Act, enacted in 1968, “provided procedures for obtaining electronic surveillance \nwarrants in certain criminal investigations.”  United States v. Belfield, 692 F.2d 141, 144 (D.C. \nCir. 1982).  FISA was passed ten years later to address electronic surveillance in the national \nsecurity space.  Id. at 145.  The Wiretap Act and FISA prescribe “the exclusive means by which \nelectronic surveillance, as defined in [FISA], and the interception of domestic wire, oral, and \nelectronic communications may be conducted.”  18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(f).  \n15 The Court has found, and the parties have provided, very little caselaw on §§ 1809 and \n1810.  Although the few relevant cases do not analyze the meaning of phrase “engage in electronic \nsurveillance,” as the Court has done here, they are generally consistent with the Court’s ruling.  See \nUnited States v. Koyomejian, 946 F.2d 1450, 1459 n.16 (9th Cir. 1991) (“[Section] 1809(a) is best \nunderstood as subjecting to criminal liability anyone who performs electronic surveillance as \ndefined by FISA” without authorization (emphasis added)).  In Fazaga v. FBI, 965 F.3d 1015 (9th \nCir. 2020), rev’d on other grounds, 142 S. Ct. 1051 (2022), the court found that allegations that \nagents “had audio surveillance” in their house, “were responsible for planting [the] devices,” and \nhad once entered the mosque where they had electronic surveillance devices, plausibly stated a \nclaim under § 1810 for “install[ing] or us[ing] . . . [a] device . . . for monitoring to acquire \ninformation.”  Id. at 1038; 50 U.S.C. § 1801(f)(4).  That court went further by implying that \nsupervising agents might have been liable had the complaint alleged that they “ordered or arranged \nfor[] the planting of the recording devices,” id. at 1039, but the court did not decide that issue.  And \nit did not perform a textual analysis of the meaning of “engage in electronic surveillance,” as the \nCourt does here.   \n26 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 27 of 54\nsurveillance pursuant to a warrant cannot occur absent an application and order of approval from \nthe FISC.  See Pl.’s Omnibus Opp’n at 49.  But Congress chose to create individual liability only \nfor the actors involved in conducting the surveillance, rather than those responsible for gaining \napproval to do so.  Those who work on the FISA applications may “aid[], abet[], counsel[], \ncommand[], induce[], or procure[]” the eventual surveillance, see 18 U.S.C. § 2, but as explained \nabove, Congress did not provide for aiding and abetting liability in § 1810, and the statutory terms \nare not broad enough to encompass those actions.  \n  This plain-text understanding—that Congress allowed suit against only those who conduct \nunauthorized surveillance, and not those who at the application stage mislead the FISC to approve \nthat surveillance—may seem odd.  But it is not so “absurd when considered in the particular \nstatutory context,” as the Court must.  Mova Pharm. Corp. v. Shalala, 140 F.3d 1060, 1068 (D.C. \nCir. 1998).  FISA was enacted in 1978 to address the issue of warrantless surveillance in the \nnational security context.  In Katz, the Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment applied to \nelectronic surveillance, 389 U.S. at 353, but left open whether the warrant requirement applied \n“when the President was acting pursuant to his powers to protect the national security or to conduct \nthe nation’s foreign affairs,” Belfield, 692 F.2d at 145 (citing Katz, 389 U.S. at 358 n.23).  Later, \nin  Keith, the Court explained that there was no national  security exception to  the  warrant \nrequirement with regard to “domestic threats to national security,” and left open whether warrants \nwere required “with respect to activities of foreign powers or their agents.”  407 U.S. at 321–22.   \nCongress, in response to Keith and “to post-Watergate concerns about the Executive’s use of \nwarrantless electronic surveillance,” enacted FISA to “establish a regularized procedure” for such \nsurveillance “in the foreign intelligence and counterintelligence field.”  Belfield, 692 F.2d at 145.  \nFISA generally, with a few exceptions, “requires a court order authorizing foreign intelligence \n27 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 28 of 54\nelectronic surveillance,” and details numerous steps that must be followed to get an order.  Id. at \n145–46. \nIn sum, FISA was passed to counter the abuses of warrantless surveillance.  This historical \ncontext helps explain why § 1809(a) applies to agents who conduct unauthorized surveillance—\ntypically, that means without a court order—rather than those who help obtain faulty warrants.  \nThis gap in coverage seems evident now, but it likely was not in 1978.  Accordingly, the Court’s \nunderstanding of § 1809(a)’s ordinary meaning is bolstered by FISA’s history.   \nFurther, those aggrieved by surveillance conducted pursuant to a warrant lacking in \nprobable cause are not entirely without a remedy.  As discussed, they can sue the agents who \nconduct the search, if the agents act intentionally.  And if the government seeks to use FISA-\nobtained evidence against them in a criminal trial, they may move to suppress such evidence on \nthe grounds that it was unlawfully acquired.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1806(e).  \nc.  Allegations Against Individual Defendants \nHaving defined FISA’s scope, the Court now turns to Page’s allegations against the \nindividual defendants.16  Though his allegations are troubling, Page does not allege that any of the \n \n16 Many of the defendants ask the Court to consider the Horowitz Report in full, claiming that its \nconclusions conflict with some of Page’s allegations.  See, e.g., Strzok Mot. to Dismiss at 4 n.3, \n13; Pientka Mot. to Dismiss at 2 n.3, 14–15; Somma Mot. to Dismiss at 3 n.2, 16–17.  At the \nhearing, the plaintiff did not oppose this request.  Rough Hr’g Tr. at 71.  The Court, however, \ndeclines to consider the entire Report.  True, the Report is extensively referenced in the complaint.  \nBut the Court cannot wholly incorporate it by reference because it is not “integral to [Page’s] \nclaim.”  Banneker, 798 F.3d at 1133 (citation omitted).  That is, it is not akin to a contract “that is \na necessary element of [a breach of contract] claim.”  Id.  Rather, Page references it “to show how \n[he] learned some facts in the complaint.”  Id. at 1134.  He does “not purport to and [is] not required \nto adopt the factual contents of the report wholesale.”  Id.  Indeed, he alleges that some of its \ncontents are inaccurate.  SAC ¶ 250.  The Court can certainly consider the Report to “show any \ninaccuracy in [Page’s] allegations about its contents.”  Id. at 1134 n.6.  But it cannot, as some of \nthe individual defendants argue, “tak[e] . . . as true” all of the Report’s contents, including its \nconclusions  about  the  individual  defendants’  intent  and  motivations,  to  contradict  Page’s \nallegations.  Id.  \n28 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 29 of 54\nindividual  defendants  personally  conducted  the  surveillance  or  acquired  or  collected  his \ncommunications.  For this reason, his FISA claims must be dismissed. \nComey, McCabe, Strzok, and Lisa Page.  Some of the defendants, such as Comey, McCabe, \nStrzok, and Lisa Page, allegedly approved, encouraged, and facilitated Page’s investigation and \nthe warrant applications.   \nJames Comey, the FBI director during the first three FISA warrant applications, SAC ¶ 26, \nread the first application and signed all three, id.  ¶¶ 150, 152, 153.  His “certification” confirmed \nto the FISC that the information sought was foreign intelligence information that could not \nreasonably be obtained by normal investigative techniques, and that a “significant purpose of the \nsurveillance [was] to obtain foreign intelligence information.”  50 U.S.C. § 1804(a)(6).  According \nto Page, Comey gave a “green light” to apply for the first FISA warrant “without further scrutiny” \nof Steele, despite some concerns about his bias.  SAC ¶¶ 91, 159.  He also was aware of certain \nkey information that was not fully disclosed in the various applications, including, among others, \nHillary Clinton’s plan to connect Trump and Russian election interference, Steele’s funding \nsource, and Page’s previous status as a CIA operational contact.  Id. ¶¶ 73, 81, 144, 146, 148, 153.   \nAndrew McCabe, the Deputy Director of the FBI during the Page surveillance, signed the \nforeign-intelligence certification for fourth FISA application.  Id. ¶ 27.  His alleged actions are \nsimilar to Comey’s—he too gave the “green light” to proceed with the FISA application despite \nthe concerns about Steele’s bias, id. ¶ 91, and “ignored warnings that more information about [his] \nmotives was needed before relying on his allegations,” id. ¶ 157.  He was told that Steele’s work \nwas political opposition research for a political party.  Id. ¶ 94.  DOJ supposedly would not approve \nthe FISA application “without a call from McCabe.”  Id. ¶ 158.   \n29 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 30 of 54\nPeter Strzok was the Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence at the FBI and \nsupervised the Page investigation until January 2017.  Id. ¶ 29.  Like Comey, he knew about \nClinton’s plan to connect Trump and Russia, id. ¶ 73, and that Page denied meeting with Russian \nofficials and had previously worked with the CIA and FBI, id. ¶¶ 81, 166.  He too “pushed to \nproceed with the application without further scrutiny of Steele” and “[fought] with [the DOJ \nattorney] for” it.  Id. ¶¶ 168, 170.  As the investigation continued, he learned more about Steele’s \nquestionable credibility.  Id. ¶¶ 105–106, 171–172.  Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer and Special Counsel \nto McCabe during the Page investigation, also learned about Steele’s bias, including that his work \nwas political opposition research.   SAC ¶ 94, 106, 195.  The complaint alleges that she “facilitated \nobtaining the initial FISA warrant for Dr. Page in the face of doubts voiced by the DOJ and others,” \nid. ¶ 195, and exchanged text messages with Strzok indicating a political motivation, id. ¶ 197.   \nAbsent from the complaint is any claim that these four defendants participated in drafting \nor substantively reviewing the faulty applications themselves, let alone that they performed the \nFISA surveillance and acquired Page’s communications.   \nPientka, Auten, Somma, and Clinesmith.  Even for the four defendants who did contribute \nto the material errors in the applications, Page does not claim that they “engage[d] in electronic \nsurveillance,” as defined above.   \nJoe Pientka, a Supervisory Special Agent in the FBI’s Washington Field Office, signed an \nauthorization to submit the first application that confirmed compliance with the FBI’s “Woods \nProcedures,” which are “designed to ensure the accuracy of the factual assertions in a [FISA] \napplication.”  SAC ¶¶ 31, 60, 198.  He was responsible for reviewing the “Woods File” to confirm \nthat there was appropriate documentation for each factual assertion in the application.  Id. ¶ 198.  \nBut the file was “inaccurate, incomplete, and unsupported by appropriate documentation,” id., and \n30 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 31 of 54\nPientka allegedly “failed to verify and correct the false statement” that “Steele’s reporting had \nbeen corroborated and used in criminal proceedings,” id. ¶ 199.   \nAuten and Somma were allegedly responsible for that false statement, along with numerous \nother material omissions.  Id. ¶¶ 179, 206.  Brian Auten was an FBI Supervisory Intelligence \nAnalyst who worked on the Crossfire Hurricane investigation from its start in July 2016 through \n2017.  Id. ¶¶ 33, 175.  He helped the agents prepare the applications by reviewing the probable \ncause sections for accuracy, filling in gaps, and providing information about Steele and his sub-\nsources.  Id. ¶¶ 175–176.  He “falsely enhanced [Steele’s] credibility” by writing the misstatement \ndiscussed above and failing to disclose that Steele’s colleagues gave negative feedback about his \njudgment and that some of his reporting was inaccurate.  Id. ¶¶ 179–181.  In January 2017, he \ninterviewed Danchenko, one of Steele’s key sub-sources, and found that he “contradicted key \nclaims in Steele’s reports”; this was not reported to the FISC.  Id. ¶¶ 184, 209.    \nStephen Somma was an FBI counterintelligence investigator and “Case Agent 1” on the \nPage investigation.  Id. ¶ 201.  He allegedly failed to disclose exculpatory statements from Page \nand other witnesses that he did not, contrary to Steele’s reports, meet with sanctioned Russians.  \nId. ¶ 203.  And he misled and withheld information from DOJ attorneys regarding Page’s status as \na CIA operational contact and Steele’s political bias and funding source.  Id. ¶¶ 205, 207.  Like \nAuten, he “mischaracterized the extent to which the FBI had previously relied on . . . Steele’s prior \nreporting” and did not disclose that Danchenko contradicted assertions made in the initial FISA \napplication.  Id. ¶¶ 206, 209.  According to the OIG, Somma was “primarily responsible for some \nof the most significant errors and omissions in the FISA applications.”  Id. ¶ 32.   \nFinally,  Kevin  Clinesmith  was  an  FBI  Assistant  General  Counsel  during  the  Page \ninvestigation who provided support to the Crossfire Hurricane team.  SAC ¶¶ 28, 122, 185.  The \n31 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 32 of 54\naffiant for the fourth warrant application asked him whether Page had ever been a “source \n(operational contact) for the CIA.”  Id. ¶ 129.  Clinesmith knew that if Page had been a source, \nthat fact needed to be disclosed to the FISC, but including it “would expose the material omission \nof this information” from the first three warrants.  Id. ¶ 130.  A CIA liaison told him that Page had \nbeen a source, id., but Clinesmith told the affiant that Page was a “sub source” and “never a \nsource,” ultimately altering the liaison’s email to that effect, id. ¶ 131.  The affiant relied on the \ndoctored email to sign the fourth application, which did not include “information about [Page’s] \nhistory or status as a CIA operational contact.”  Id. ¶ 191–194.   \nIf proven, these allegations clearly demonstrate wrongdoing.  See Franks v. Delaware, 438 \nU.S. 154, 164–65 (1978) (“When the Fourth Amendment demands a factual showing sufficient to \ncomprise ‘probable cause,’ the obvious assumption is that there will be a truthful showing.” \n(quotation marks omitted and alteration adopted)); Daoud, 755 F.3d at 489 (Rovner, J., concurring) \n(“[I]t has been widely assumed, if not affirmatively stated, in the decisions of other courts that \nFranks applies to FISA applications.”).  Indeed, Clinesmith entered a plea in United States v. \nClinesmith for making a false statement, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001.17  But Page does not \nallege that any of the individual defendants, including the unknown John Doe defendants and those \nmost responsible for the applications’ critical errors, took part in obtaining the surveillance \ninformation, either by setting up the devices or gathering or listening to Page’s communications.18  \n \n17 See supra note 2.   \n18 In his opposition brief and at the hearing, Page concedes that he “has not named as a defendant \nany FBI who personally engaged in the physical execution of the unlawful warrants as these \npersons are as yet unknown and unknowable to him.”  Pl.’s Omnibus Opp’n at 32 n.5; Rough Hr’g \nTr. at 24–25.   \n32 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 33 of 54\nThus, the Court cannot plausibly infer from this complaint that any of the individual defendants, \nknown or unknown, “engaged in electronic surveillance,” in violation of §§ 1809(a) and 1810.  \niii.  Using or Disclosing Information from Electronic Surveillance \nSections 1809(a) and 1810 also create a remedy against those who intentionally “disclose[] \nor use[] information obtained under color of law by electronic surveillance, knowing or having \nreason to know” that the surveillance was unauthorized.  Page’s additional allegations that the \nindividual defendants used and disclosed the fruits of the allegedly unlawful surveillance in \nnumerous ways, SAC ¶¶ 229–230, are conclusory and thus do not state an actionable use or \ndisclosure claim. \nAccording to Page, the defendants used and disclosed FISA-acquired information to obtain \nthe renewal warrants and other investigative measures against him or others; to investigate and \nprosecute others; to request assistance from other law enforcement and intelligence agencies; to \ninclude in government databases; and to justify his ongoing surveillance to other officials.  Id. \n¶ 230.  But he does not allege that any particular defendant took any of these actions.  Id.; see also \nid. ¶ 229.  And “a plaintiff cannot satisfy the minimum pleading requirements under Rule 8 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure by lumping all the defendants together in each claim and \nproviding no factual basis to distinguish their conduct.”  Toumazou v. Turkish Republic of \nNorthern Cyprus, 71 F. Supp. 3d 7, 21 (D.D.C. 2014) (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Indeed, Page cannot show that a defendant intentionally used or disclosed information \nobtained through unlawful surveillance, as required by 50 U.S.C. §§ 1809(a) and 1810, without \nproviding any details about his or her individual actions.  To the extent Page claims that the \ndefendants aided and abetted each other’s use or disclosure violations, cf. Pl.’s Omnibus Opp’n at \n16–18, that claim also fails for the reasons explained above in Part III.A.1.ii.a.   \n33 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 34 of 54\nPage’s allegations are also vague in other respects: they do not explain what information \nwas leaked, to whom it was leaked, or when or how it was leaked.  And his allegations that the \nsurveillance produced “no evidence at all” that he acted as a Russian agent undercuts his claim \nthat its results were used to procure the renewal warrants.  SAC ¶¶ 123, 136.  Accordingly, the \nCourt cannot “draw the reasonable inference that [any of] the defendant[s] [are] liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. \nAlthough Page’s media leak allegations are stated with particularity, they too fail to state a \nclaim for another reason.  He asserts that Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Lisa Page, and others disclosed \n“the existence of the FISA Warrants, the contents of the warrant applications, and the results of \nthe Warrants” to the New York Times, the Washington Post, and others.  SAC ¶ 226.  But only \nthe use or disclosure of information “obtained” by the electronic surveillance, not the fact of the \nsurveillance or the basis for the warrants, violates § 1809(a).  Neither the Times nor the Post article \ncited in the complaint contains any mention of the fruits of Page’s surveillance.  See id. ¶¶ 221, \n224; Wash. Post Article; Comey Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. 6 (N.Y. Times Article), Dkt. 87-8.  And the \ncomplaint does not cite any other media reports that contained FISA-obtained information, nor do \nthe Strzok/Lisa Page text messages mention a plan to leak such information.  SAC ¶¶ 220, 222–\n223.  Page’s bare allegation that the defendants disclosed the results of his surveillance to the \nmedia, without any further detail, does not raise his “right to relief above the speculative level.”  \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  \nThe Court will thus dismiss the FISA claims in Counts One through Four against each \nindividual defendant.  Because the Court concludes that Page fails to state a claim that the \ndefendants engaged in electronic surveillance, or used or disclosed its results, it need not address \n34 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 35 of 54\nthe  defendants’  arguments  that  they  are  protected  by  a  statutory  defense  and/or  qualified \nimmunity.19 \n2.  Bivens Claims  \nThe defendants move to dismiss the Bivens claim for failure to state a claim, both on the \nmerits and on statute of limitations grounds.  For the reasons explained above in Part III.A.1.i, the \nCourt disagrees that the claim is time-barred.  Page’s Bivens claim is governed by the three-year \nlimitations period in D.C. Code § 12-301(8), see Berman, 293 F. Supp. 3d at 56, and the complaint \ndoes not show that the claim accrued before November 27, 2017.  The Court will nevertheless \ndismiss the claim because an extension of the Bivens remedy to this “new context” is unwarranted.  \nZiglar v. Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1859 (2017).   \nThe Supreme Court has set forth a two-step inquiry that governs whether an extension of \nBivens is appropriate.  First, a court must “inquire whether the request involves a claim that arises \nin a new context or involves a new category of defendants.”  Hernandez v. Mesa, 140 S. Ct. 735, \n743 (2020) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  The Supreme Court’s understanding \nof what constitutes “a new context” is “broad.”  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  The test is \nwhether “the case is different in a meaningful way from previous Bivens cases” decided by the \nSupreme Court.  Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1859.  Second, if the claim arises in a new context, the \nBivens claim must be rejected if there are “special factors indicating that the Judiciary is at least \narguably less equipped than Congress to weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action \nto proceed.”  Egbert v. Boule, 142 S. Ct. 1793, 1803 (2022) (citation and internal quotation marks \n \n19 As noted, § 1809 includes a statutory defense to prosecution if “the defendant was a law \nenforcement or investigative officer engaged in the course of his official duties and the electronic \nsurveillance was authorized by and conducted pursuant to a search warrant or court order of a court \nof competent jurisdiction.” 50 U.S.C. § 1809(b).   \n35 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 36 of 54\nomitted).  A court cannot recognize a Bivens remedy “[i]f there is even a single reason to pause” \nbefore applying it in a new context.  Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Page’s \nclaims arise in a new context, and there are several reasons to pause.   \nPage’s Bivens claim presents a new context because it is based on unlawfully obtained \nFISA warrants.  SAC ¶ 287.  Although  Page, like the plaintiff in  Bivens, alleges a  Fourth \nAmendment violation as the basis for his constitutional claim, see 403 U.S. at 389, “[a] claim may \narise in a new context even if it is based on the same constitutional provision as a claim in a case \nin which a damages remedy was previously recognized,” Hernandez, 140 S. Ct. at 743.  In Bivens, \nthe Supreme Court created an implied damages remedy under the Fourth Amendment for an \nallegedly unconstitutional search and arrest carried out in an apartment.  403 U.S. at 389.  But as \nthe Fourth Circuit has recognized, “a claim based on unlawful electronic surveillance presents \nwildly different facts and a vastly different statutory framework from a warrantless search and \narrest.”  Attkisson v. Holder, 925 F.3d 606, 621 (4th Cir. 2019).  And here, some of the defendants, \nsuch as Comey and McCabe, are high-ranking officials, unlike the “line-level” agents sued in \nBivens.  Id.  In this case, both the nature of Page’s Fourth Amendment claim and the “rank of the \nofficers involved,” Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1860, signal a new context.    \nSpecial factors also counsel against creating a Bivens remedy in this new context.  Page’s \nsurveillance occurred as part of a high-level investigation into alleged foreign interference in a \npresidential election.  SAC ¶¶ 5–6, 221, 224.  “[A] Bivens cause of action may not lie where, as \nhere, national security is at issue.”  Egbert, 142 S. Ct. at 1805.  Plus, a court cannot extend Bivens \nif Congress has already provided “an alternative remedial structure.”  Id. at 1804 (quoting Abbasi, \n137 S. Ct. at 1858).  Congress has comprehensively legislated in the electronic surveillance space \n“without authorizing damages for a Fourth Amendment violation.”  Attkisson, 925 F.3d at 621.  It \n36 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 37 of 54\nhas instead created several private causes of actions under a number of statutes governing \nsurveillance, including FISA, 50 U.S.C. § 1810, the Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2520(a), the Stored \nCommunications Act, id. § 2707(a), (g), and the PATRIOT Act, id. § 2712.  These alternatives \n“alone” are “reason enough to limit the power of the Judiciary to infer a new Bivens cause of \naction.”  Egbert, 142 S. Ct. at 1804 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  \n  Accordingly, the Court will dismiss the Bivens claim in Count Six against each individual \ndefendant. \nB.  Institutional Defendants  \nPage brings claims against the United States under the FTCA and the PATRIOT Act.  SAC \n¶¶ 275–282, 303–311.  He also asserts a Privacy Act claim against DOJ for failure to amend his \nrecords, id. ¶¶ 290–295, and a Privacy Act claim against DOJ and the FBI for unlawful disclosures, \nid. ¶¶ 296–302.  The Court will address each claim in turn.  \n1.  FTCA Claim  \nThe  FTCA  “waive[s]  the  sovereign  immunity  of  the  United  States  for  certain  torts \ncommitted by federal employees.”  FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994) (citing 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1346(b)).  Federal courts have jurisdiction over these claims if they are “actionable” under \n§ 1346(b).  Id. at 477.  The claim must be  \n[1] against the United States, [2] for money damages, . . . [3] for injury or loss of \nproperty, or personal injury or death [4] caused by the negligent or wrongful act or \nomission of any employee of the Government [5] while acting within the scope of \nhis office or employment, [6] under circumstances where the United States, if a \nprivate person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the \nplace where the act or omission occurred.   \n \nId. (alteration in original) (quoting § 1346(b)).  Under the FTCA, “all elements of a meritorious \nclaim are also jurisdictional.”  Brownback v. King, 141 S. Ct. 740, 749 (2021).  Accordingly, for \n37 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 38 of 54\na court to have subject-matter jurisdiction, and “to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,” \nthe “plaintiff must plausibly allege all six FTCA elements.”  Id.   \nPage has not plausibly pleaded the sixth element: that the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable under D.C. law.  He alleges that the individual defendants committed an “abuse of \nprocess” by acting with an “ulterior motive to use the FISA warrant process to accomplish an end \nnot permitted by law: to obtain the surveillance of . . . Page and the Trump presidential campaign \nwithout probable cause.”  SAC ¶ 280 (emphasis omitted); see 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h).  Under D.C. \nlaw, however, abuse of process occurs when “process has been used to accomplish some end which \nis without the regular purview of the process, or which compels the party against whom it is used \nto do some collateral thing which he could not legally and regularly be required to do.”  Jacobson \nv. Thrifty Paper Boxes, Inc., 230 A.2d 710, 711 (D.C. 1967).  That an official has acted “spitefully, \nmaliciously, or with an ulterior motive in instituting” process is not enough.  Scott v. District of \nColumbia, 101 F.3d 748, 755 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Instead, the process must be used “for an \nimmediate purpose other than that for  which it was designed  and intended.”   Id.  (quoting \nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 682 cmt. b).  For example, “[t]he usual case of abuse of process \nis one of some form of extortion, using the process to put pressure upon the other to compel him \nto pay a different debt or to take some other action or refrain from it.”  Id. at 755–56 (quoting \nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 682 cmt. b).   \nHere, Page points only to the defendants’ “unlawful end” or “ulterior motive” “to obtain \nthe surveillance of Dr. Page and the Trump presidential campaign without probable cause.”  SAC \n¶¶ 16, 280 (emphasis omitted); see also Pl.’s Opp’n at 21, Dkt. 99 (“[The SAC] alleges that the \nGovernment’s agents perverted the FISA warrant process by making material misstatements and \nomissions to obtain four successive warrants without probable cause for the ulterior motive of \n38 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 39 of 54\nsurveilling . . . Page and the Trump presidential campaign.”).  As D.C. courts have held, that alone \nis insufficient to state a claim for abuse of process.  See Bown v. Hamilton, 601 A.2d 1074, 1080 \n(D.C. 1992); Scott, 101 F.3d at 755.  True, Page alleges that the defendants made false statements \nin the FISA application process so that the warrants would be granted in the absence of probable \ncause.  SAC ¶ 16.  But neither allegation suffices to state an abuse of process claim.  See Dormu \nv. District of Columbia, 795 F. Supp. 2d 7, 33 (D.D.C. 2011) (granting summary judgment for \ndefendants on an abuse of process claim even though the officers lacked probable cause to arrest \nthe plaintiff); Rauh v. Coyne, 744 F. Supp. 1186, 1194 (D.D.C. 1990) (explaining that abuse of \nprocess “does not arise from a misrepresentation to the Court”); Moradi v. Protas, Kay, Spivok & \nProtas, Chartered, 494 A.2d 1329, 1330, 1333 n.7 (D.C. 1985) (noting that the plaintiff did not \nstate a claim for abuse of process where (1) the defendant’s agent had “negligently or falsely \nswor[n] that he had served summonses” on him in three cases, (2) the defendant had then obtained \na default judgment and writ of attachment in each case, and (3) the defendant, knowing the plaintiff \nwas not served, had obtained a judgment of condemnation (internal quotation marks omitted)).  \nPage’s reliance on out-of-jurisdiction cases, see Pl.’s Opp’n at 21–22, cannot overcome \nclear authority from D.C. courts, as the proper inquiry is only whether a private person would be \nliable under D.C. law.  28 U.S.C. § 1346(b).  Page cites one D.C. case, Hall v. Field Enterprises, \nInc., 94 A.2d 479 (D.C. 1953),20 but it also does not help.  In that case, the defendants had \n \n20 Page also cites Whelan v. Abell, 953 F.2d 663 (D.C. Cir. 1992), and Neumann v. Vidal, 710 F.2d \n856 (D.C. Cir. 1983), but both cases “have been superceded by more recent decisions embracing \nthe more restrictive standard of” Bown, 601 A.2d at 1079–80, and Morowitz v. Marvel, 423 A.2d \n196, 198–99 (D.C. 1980).  Nader v. Democratic Nat’l Comm., 555 F. Supp. 2d 137, 161 (D.D.C. \n2008) (citing Moore v. United States, 213 F.3d 705 (D.C. Cir. 2000); and Scott v. District of \nColumbia, 101 F.3d 748 (D.C. Cir. 1996)).  In these cases, the D.C. Court of Appeals decided that \nsimply initiating a legal proceeding with an ulterior motive is in and of itself insufficient to give \nrise to an abuse of process claim; the process instead must be used to accomplish “some end not \n \n39 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 40 of 54\n“fraudulently”  and  “without  legal  justification”  filed  suit  against  the  plaintiff,  achieved  a \nfraudulent judgment, “without proper justification caused to be issued a writ of attachment \npredicated” on that judgment, and unlawfully seized his wages.  Id. at 480–81.  Initially, the court \nheld that these allegations stated an abuse of process claim.  Id at 481.  But later, on a second \nappeal, the court held that the plaintiff’s abuse of process claim failed because the process “was \nused for its legally intended purpose: to obtain a judgment against the plaintiff and to obtain \nsatisfaction of that judgment” by garnishing his wages.  Hall v. Field Enters., Inc., 114 A.2d 840, \n841 (D.C. 1955).  Here, too, the warrants were used for their legally intended purpose: to surveil \nPage.  See SAC ¶ 3. \n“[T]he gist of the [abuse of process] action lies in the improper use after issuance” of \nprocess.  Hall v. Hollywood Credit Clothing Co., 147 A.2d 866, 868 (D.C. 1959).  As noted, Page’s \ncomplaint does not allege that the defendants used the warrants wrongfully, “to accomplish some \nend which the process was not intended by law to accomplish.”  Hall, 94 A.2d at 481.  Instead, it \nmerely alleges that he was surveilled pursuant to the warrants, SAC ¶ 3, and such surveillance is \nthe “ordinary purpose” of a FISA order.  See Morfessis v. Baum, 281 F.2d 938, 940 (D.C. Cir. \n1960).  Although Page claims that the purpose of the surveillance was to monitor the Trump \ncampaign, the complaint does not allege that the agents obtained the warrants to, for instance, \nmonitor campaign staffers who were not the proper targets of the warrants.  Nor does it allege that \nthe defendants used the FISA process to “pressure [Page] into taking any action or prevent him \nfrom taking action, or to achieve any other collateral purpose.”  Scott, 101 F.3d at 755.  Because \n \ncontemplated in the regular prosecution of the charge.”  Bown, 601 A.2d at 1080 (quoting \nMorowitz, 423 A.2d at 198).   \n40 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 41 of 54\nPage has failed to allege an actionable abuse of process claim, the Court will dismiss the FTCA \nclaim in Count Five for lack of jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1). \n2.  PATRIOT Act Claim \nIn the PATRIOT Act, Congress created a civil cause of action against the United States to \nrecover damages for willful violations of certain sections of FISA.  18 U.S.C. § 2712(a).  As \nrelevant here, § 2712(a) allows a person to sue if he has been “aggrieved by any willful violation \nof . . . [FISA] section[] 106(a) [50 U.S.C. § 1806(a)].”21  Section 1806(a), in turn, states that \n“information acquired from [FISA] electronic surveillance” about “any United States person may \nbe used and disclosed by Federal officers and employees” without that person’s consent “only in \naccordance with [FISA] minimization procedures” and only “for lawful purposes.”  See also Fikre \nv. FBI, 142 F. Supp. 3d 1152, 1169 (D. Or. 2015) (listing the elements that a plaintiff must allege \nto state a PATRIOT Act claim for a § 1806(a) violation).  Before bringing an action under \n§ 2712(a), the plaintiff must first present it to “the appropriate department or agency” within two \nyears after the claim accrues.  18 U.S.C. § 2712(b)(1)–(2); see Schuler v. United States, 628 F.2d \n199, 201 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (interpreting identical language in the FTCA).  The claim accrues “on \nthe date upon which the claimant first has a reasonable opportunity to discover the violation.”  18 \nU.S.C. § 2712(b)(2).   \nThe basis for Page’s PATRIOT Act claim is that “the individual Defendants, acting in \nviolation of the FISA, obtained, disclosed, or used information obtained by electronic surveillance \nof Mr. Page knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through \nelectronic surveillance not lawfully authorized by the FISA.”  SAC ¶ 307.  But this language \n \n21 An aggrieved person can also sue for violations of 50 U.S.C. § 1825(a), concerning physical \nsearches, and 50 U.S.C. § 1845(a), concerning pen registers or trap and trace devices.  18 U.S.C. \n§ 2712(a).  \n41 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 42 of 54\nmerely restates the elements for a violation under § 1809(a), rather than one under § 1806(a).  And \nCongress did not include a sovereign immunity waiver for § 1809(a) violations.  See 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1810 (“an aggrieved person . . . shall have a cause of action against any person who committed \nsuch violation”) (emphasis added);22 Al-Haramain Islamic Found., Inc. v. Obama, 705 F.3d 845, \n851–53 (9th Cir. 2012) (Under § 2712(a), a plaintiff “can bring a suit for damages against the \nUnited States for [unlawful] use of the collected information, but cannot bring suit against the \ngovernment for collection of the information itself.”).  Thus, to the extent that Page brings a \nPATRIOT Act claim for the unlawful acquisition of information, the Court lacks jurisdiction to \nhear it.   \nRelying on the same allegations that underlie his “use and disclosure” FISA claim against \nthe individual defendants, Page presents several theories to support his PATRIOT Act claim: \n(1) the media leaks; (2) the use of the warrant results in renewal applications; and (3) disclosures \nfor a host of investigative purposes—to obtain other investigative measures against him or others, \nto  investigate  and  prosecute  others,  to  request  assistance  from  other  law  enforcement  and \nintelligence agencies, to include the information in government databases, and to justify his \nongoing surveillance to other officials.  SAC ¶¶ 229–230; Pl.’s Opp’n at 11–12.   \nAs an initial matter, Page failed to present his third theory (about other investigative uses) \nto DOJ when he filed his administrative claim on September 30, 2020.  See Gov’t Mot. to Dismiss, \nEx. 1 (Page Admin. Claim) to Ex. T (Don Decl.), Dkt. 88-22; see also Gov’t Mot. To Dismiss at \n55.  Page does not contest this fact.  See Pl.’s Opp’n at 9–19.  The Court therefore treats this \nargument as conceded and finds that Page cannot bring a claim based on the disclosure of his \n \n22 “Person” is defined as “any individual, including any officer or employee of the Federal \nGovernment,  or  any  group,  entity,  association,  corporation,  or  foreign  power.”    50  U.S.C. \n§ 1801(m).  It does not include the United States.  \n42 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 43 of 54\ninformation for other investigative uses.  Davis v. TSA, 264 F. Supp. 3d 6, 10 (D.D.C. 2017) (noting \nthat a court may treat as conceded arguments in a motion to dismiss that a plaintiff failed to address \nin its response). \nThe Court will not dismiss the remainder of Page’s claim as time-barred.  Although it is \ntrue that Page had notice of the alleged violations before September 30, 2018 (two years prior to \nhis administrative claim), see Gov’t Mot. to Dismiss at 47–50, the face of the complaint does not \nconclusively reveal when he could have reasonably discovered every alleged violation.  18 U.S.C. \n§ 2712(b)(2).  Simply because Page knew about the FISA renewals does not mean that he knew\nthat the applications contained FISA-obtained information.  At least at this stage, the Court cannot \ndetermine that Page’s entire PATRIOT Act claim has expired under the statute of limitations, and \nthus, it will not dismiss it on this basis. \nThe Court will, however, dismiss the PATRIOT Act claim on the merits.  First, Page’s \nmedia leak theory fails for the reasons described in Part III.A.1.iii.23  Section 1806(a) prohibits the \ndisclosure of information “obtained” from FISA surveillance, but neither the Post nor the Times \narticle revealed any results from the FISA warrants.  See SAC ¶¶ 221, 224; Gov’t Mot. to Dismiss, \nEx. F. (Wash. Post Article), Dkt. 88-8; Gov’t Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. G (N.Y. Times Article), Dkt. \n88-9.24  And Page does not point to any other media reports containing FISA information.  It is not\nenough to say, as Page does in his opposition, that it is “not clear what unlawful disclosures of \nFISA-related information were made to the reporters who wrote these articles,” Pl.’s Opp’n at 12.  \n23 For the reasons explained below in Part III.B.3.ii, the Court could also dismiss the media-leak \nclaim as time-barred, because Page knew of the alleged leaks by April 2017.  SAC ¶¶ 221, 224.   \n24 As explained above, see supra note 7, the Court may consider these articles, referenced in the \ncomplaint, in full, without converting the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment.   \n43 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 44 of 54\nTo survive a motion to dismiss, he must allege facts in his complaint that allow the Court to \nplausibly infer that the defendants disclosed FISA-acquired information.  He has not.  \n  Second, Page’s alternate theory that the defendants violated the PATRIOT Act because \nthey knowingly used the unlawfully obtained information from the FISA warrants to obtain later \nwarrants, SAC ¶¶ 229, 307; Pl.’s Opp’n at 13, rests on a faulty legal premise.  To plead a violation \nof the PATRIOT Act relying on § 1806(a), Page must allege that the FISA information was used \nor disclosed in violation of the statutory minimization procedures or for an unlawful purpose.  The \ncomplaint does neither.  SAC ¶ 303–311.  Page instead claims that the federal officers knew that \nthe disclosed information had been acquired through unauthorized surveillance.  See SAC ¶ 307; \nPl.’s Opp’n at 11, 13 (misstating the applicable standard for a PATRIOT Act claim based on a \nviolation of § 1806(a)).  This is an element of §§ 1809(a) and 1810—but not § 1806(a)—claims.  \nAnd Congress has waived the United States’s sovereign immunity for § 1806(a) claims only.  See \nAl-Haramain Islamic Found., 705 F.3d at 851–53.  The use of information knowingly obtained \nthrough unauthorized surveillance itself does not, as Page argues, see Pl.’s Opp’n at 13, qualify as \nan unlawful purpose.  Absent clear statutory language, which does not exist here, the Court rejects \nPage’s invitation to graft § 1809(a)’s elements onto § 1806(a).25  See Loughrin v. United States, \n573 U.S. 351, 357 (2014) (“[W]hen Congress includes particular language in one section of a \nstatute but omits it in another . . . this Court presumes that Congress intended a difference in \nmeaning.” (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)); Bates v. United States, 522 U.S. 23, \n29 (1997) (“[W]e ordinarily resist reading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on \n \n25 Page’s citation to legislative history is irrelevant.  See Pl.’s Opp’n at 13 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. \n95-1720, at 33 (1978), a Committee Report that discusses the criminal penalty in § 1809(a), not \nthe use of information provision in § 1806(a)). \n44 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 45 of 54\nits face.”).  The unlawful collection of information is not equivalent to using the information, once \nobtained, for an unlawful purpose, in violation of § 1806(a).   \nPlus, this theory rests on factually thin and internally contradictory allegations.  As \nexplained in Part III.A.1.iii, Page’s unadorned allegation that the FISA warrant results were used \nto procure the renewal warrants is undercut by his other assertions that the second application “did \nnot outline any foreign intelligence information that had been gathered during the first three \nmonths” and that the surveillance under each warrant produced “no evidence at all” that he acted \nas a Russian agent.  SAC ¶¶ 114, 123, 136; see also Pl.’s Opp’n at 13 (merely speculating that the \napplications included FISA-acquired information).  Taken together, these are not “enough to raise \n[his] right to relief above the speculative level.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.     \nFinally, Page offers no factual detail that supports his single, conclusory assertion that the \nUnited States has conceded that it has used and disclosed the FISA information in some ways \n“which were then specifically prohibited by the FISC.”   SAC ¶ 231.  He points to only one specific \nadmission from the government—that it lacked probable cause for the third and fourth FISA \nwarrants.  SAC ¶ 43; see also Gov’t Mot. to Dismiss at 58.  Beyond that, he does not identify any \ngovernment concessions about improper disclosures, failures to minimize, or violations of specific \nFISC prohibitions.  SAC ¶ 231.  Nor does he reference any filings before the FISC.  Id.  Without \nmore, the Court cannot plausibly infer from the complaint that the government used or disclosed \nFISA information in violation of the minimization procedures or for an unlawful purpose.    \nThe Court will therefore dismiss Page’s PATRIOT Act claim in Count Nine. \n3. Privacy Act Claims\n“The  Privacy  Act  regulates  the  collection,  maintenance,  use,  and  dissemination  of \ninformation about individuals by federal agencies.”  Wilson v. Libby, 535 F.3d 697, 707 (D.C. Cir. \n45 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 46 of 54\n2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see 5 U.S.C. § 552a.  An “agency that \nmaintains a system of records shall,” upon request, permit an individual to access and/or amend \nrecords pertaining to him.  Id. § 552a(d).  The Act also “requires that an agency ‘permit’ an \nindividual ‘who disagrees with the refusal of the agency to amend his record’ to request a review \nof that decision.”  Doe v. Rogers, 498 F. Supp. 3d 59, 71 (D.D.C. 2020) (quoting 5 U.S.C. \n§552a(d)(3)).  And it allows individuals to file a civil action for injunctive relief against the agency\nif it has “refuse[d] to comply with” a request for access or has made a final determination “not to \namend an individual’s record in accordance with his request.”  Id. §§ 552a(g)(1)(A)–(B), (g)(2)–\n(3).  The Act also sets rules for the disclosure of records contained in a system of records.  Id. \n§552a(b).  An individual may bring a claim for improper disclosure under § 552a(g)(1)(D) and\nreceive monetary damages if the agency acted intentionally or willfully.  Id. § 552a(g)(1)(D), \n(g)(4).   \nPage brings two counts under the Privacy Act.  SAC ¶¶ 290–302.  He seeks injunctive \nrelief to compel DOJ to amend inaccurate records, id. ¶ 294, and requests damages from DOJ and \nthe FBI for unlawful disclosures to media outlets.  Id. ¶¶ 297, 300.  The Court will address each in \nturn.     \ni. Failure to Amend\nAccording to Page, the Horowitz Report “contains numerous errors,” and he requests an \norder requiring DOJ to amend it to correct those unspecified inaccuracies.  SAC ¶¶ 250, 292–294; \n5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(A), (g)(2)(A).   \nAfter an individual requests an amendment of a record, the Privacy Act requires the agency \nto either correct any portion “which the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely, or \ncomplete,” or explain its refusal to amend.  5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(2)(B).  The individual can then \n46 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 47 of 54\nrequest a review of any refusal.  Id. § 552a(d)(3).  And he may sue after the agency makes a final \ndetermination  not  to  amend  or  fails  to  comply  with  the  statute’s  review  provisions.    Id. \n§ 552a(g)(1)(A).   \nThe  parties  disagree  about  whether  Page  has  properly  exhausted  his  administrative \nremedies for his failure to amend claim.  The government contends that the exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies is jurisdictional.  Gov’t Mot. to Dismiss at 29–31 (citing, e.g., Dick v. \nHolder, 67 F. Supp. 3d 167, 187 (D.D.C. 2014)).  Page argues instead that exhaustion is an \naffirmative defense that the complaint must reveal on its face.  Pl.’s Opp’n at 29.26   \nThe Court agrees with the government.  Under D.C. Circuit precedent, “[e]xhaustion of \n[Privacy  Act]  administrative  remedies  is  a  prerequisite  to  bringing  civil  suit  to  compel \namendment.”  Nagel v. U.S. Dep’t of Health, Educ. & Welfare, 725 F.2d 1438, 1441 (D.C. Cir. \n1984); see also Haase v. Sessions, 893 F.2d 370, 373 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (same for access claims).  \nCourts in this circuit treat Privacy Act exhaustion as jurisdictional.  See Barouch v. DOJ, 962 F. \nSupp. 2d 30, 67 (D.D.C. 2013) (collecting cases).  \n Page  nonetheless  asserts  that  he  exhausted  his  administrative  remedies  before  the \nHorowitz Report was publicly released.  SAC ¶¶ 233, 238–244.  In particular, in fall 2019, after \nthe Inspector General’s investigation was nearly finished and was about to enter the “review and \ncomment phase,” id. ¶ 237, Page sent multiple emails to DOJ, the OIG, and various officials at \n \n26 That is true for certain statutes.  See, e.g., Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 216 (2007) (holding that \nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act’s exhaustion requirement for prisoner actions under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983  is  an  affirmative  defense).    But  under  others,  exhaustion  requirements  may  be \njurisdictional, and a court will dismiss an unexhausted claim under Rule 12(b)(1).  See Thompson \nv. DEA, 492 F.3d 428, 438 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  The authority that Page cites in support of his view \nthat exhaustion is an affirmative defense appears to be an outlier and relies on a Title VII, rather \nthan Privacy Act, case.  Pl.’s Opp’n at 29 (citing Ramstack v. Dep’t of the Army, 607 F. Supp. 2d \n94, 104 (D.D.C. 2009)). \n47 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 48 of 54\nthose agencies asking to view and amend the “forthcoming report” pursuant to the Privacy Act.  \nId. ¶¶ 238, 240, 242, 244 (referring to three emails from October 10, 16, and 21, and “no fewer \nthan two emails” from September).  On October 16, a DOJ official responded that his request was \nunder review.  Id. ¶ 243.  And on November 12, Page was told only that he would not be contacted \nfor an OIG interview.  Id. ¶ 249.   \nPage received the final Horowitz Report when it was made public on December 19.  See \nid. ¶ 233.27  But Page does not allege that he has contacted anyone at DOJ to seek an amendment \nof the finalized Horowitz Report.  See generally SAC.  And the government offers undisputed \nevidence that he did not.  See Gov’t Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. DD (Malis Decl.) ¶ 8, Dkt. 88-32; Pl.’s \nOpp’n at 28–29 (not claiming otherwise).28  Thus, the agency has not been given the chance “in \nthe first instance,” Dickson v. Off. of Pers. Mgmt., 828 F.2d 32, 40 (D.C. Cir. 1987), to correct any \nportion of the final report that Page might identify as “not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete,” \n5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(2)(B)(i).  Without having asked DOJ to make “specific amendments” to the \npublic report, his amendment claims are premature.  Hill v. U.S. Air Force, 795 F.2d 1067, 1069 \n(D.C. Cir. 1986).   \nTo be sure, DOJ never informed Page of his right to appeal.  Pl.’s Opp’n at 29–30 (citing \nHarper v. Kobelinski, 589 F.2d 721, 723 (D.C. Cir. 1978)).  But he does not allege that he received \na denial (either for access or amendment) in the first place, a prerequisite for an appeal.  SAC ¶ 249 \n(quoting the November 12 response letter from the DOJ official: “This letter does not address his \n \n27 Page does not assert an access claim under the Privacy Act for the draft Horowitz Report.  See \nSAC ¶¶ 290–295; Pl.’s Opp’n at 28–38.  Nor does he seek damages for the agency’s failure to \nmaintain accurate records under 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(4), a claim that does not require exhaustion.  \nNagel, 725 F.2d at 1441 n.2.  \n28 The Court may consider facts in the record outside the pleadings to determine the exhaustion \nquestion because it must assure itself of its own jurisdiction.  Settles, 429 F.3d at 1107.  \n48 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 49 of 54\nrequests under the Privacy Act[.]”).  And “[t]he statute provides no exemption from administrative \nreview when an agency fails, even by several months, to abide by a deadline [to respond to an \namendment request].”  Dickson, 828 F.2d at 40 (plaintiff could not file civil action before appealing \nthe agency’s denial, even though the agency was late to respond to the request for correction).  \nTherefore, DOJ’s failure to fully respond to Page’s access claims does not excuse him from \nparticipating in the administrative process (which, in any event, he only initiated for the draft \nreport).  Plus, a review of Page’s email requests reveals that he did not ask for any specific \namendments to either the draft or the final report.  See Malis Decl. Exs. A–C (for example, asking \non October 10, 2019 to “review . . . the FISA abuse Inspector General report draft” for “accuracy \npurposes”).29  Thus, he never identified any inaccuracies in the report for DOJ to consider.   \nPage can still, however, request that DOJ fix any mistakes in the final Horowitz Report \nthrough the normal administrative process.   See Hill, 795 F.2d at 1071 (“[N]othing in our \ndisposition of this case prevents appellant from seeking to have his official agency records \ncorrected.”).  But, at least as of now, Page has not exhausted his administrative remedies.  Because \n“failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the Privacy Act is a jurisdictional deficiency,” \nsee Barry v. Haaland, No. 19-cv-3380, 2021 WL 1177798, at *7 (D.D.C. Mar. 29, 2021) (citation \nomitted), the Court will dismiss his Privacy Act claim in Count Seven for lack of jurisdiction.30   \n \n29 The Court may consider these documents to assure itself of its jurisdiction, see Settles, 429 F.3d \nat 1107, and because they are documents on which the complaint necessarily relies, see Hinton v. \nCorrs. Corp. of Am., 624 F. Supp. 2d 45, 46 (D.D.C. 2009).  See Sandoval v. DOJ, 296 F. Supp. \n3d 1, 12 (D.D.C. 2017) (considering the plaintiff’s administrative requests, produced by the \ndefendant, to determine whether he exhausted). \n30 Page’s earlier Privacy Act suit against DOJ does not affect the exhaustion analysis because that \ncase alleged different Privacy Act violations from previous years.  See Compl., Dkt. 1, Page v. \nDOJ, 19-cv-3149 (D.D.C. Oct. 21, 2019).    \n49 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 50 of 54\nii. Unlawful Disclosures\nPage also sues DOJ and the FBI for leaks of his information in violation of the Privacy Act.  \nSAC ¶¶ 226, 296–302.  He alleges that the defendants, including Comey, McCabe, Strzok, and \nLisa Page, unlawfully disclosed “the existence of the FISA Warrants, the contents of the warrant \napplications, and the results of the Warrants” to media outlets such as the New York Times, the \nWashington Post, and “possibly others.”  Id. ¶ 226.  The Court concludes that Page’s unlawful \ndisclosure claim is time-barred because he knew about the alleged disclosures to the media for \nmore than two years before he filed this action.   \n“Privacy Act claims for monetary damages based on improper disclosure . . . have four \nelements: ‘1) the disclosed information is a record contained within a system of records; 2) the \nagency improperly disclosed the information; 3) the disclosure was willful or intentional; and 4) \nthe disclosure adversely affected the plaintiff.’”  Doe v. DOJ, 660 F. Supp. 2d 31, 44–45 (D.D.C. \n2009) (quoting Logan v. Dep’t of Veterans Affs., 357 F. Supp. 2d 149, 154 (D.D.C. 2004)).  An \naction under the Privacy Act “may be brought . . . within two years from the date on which the \ncause of action arises.”  5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(5).  “[T]he cause of action does not arise and the statute \nof limitation does not begin to run until the plaintiff knows or should know of the alleged \nviolation.”  Tijerina v. Walters, 821 F.2d 789, 798 (D.C. Cir. 1987).   \nThe Privacy Act section of the complaint identifies only two media reports: the April 11, \n2017 Washington Post article and the April 22, 2017 New York Times article.  SAC ¶¶ 221, 224; \nPl.’s Opp’n at 39 (not identifying any other disclosures).  The Post article, which broke the story \nabout the FISA warrants, cites anonymous “law enforcement and other U.S. officials” for details \nabout the Page investigation.  SAC ¶ 221; Wash. Post Article at 2.  The Times article, which is \nmainly about then-FBI Director Comey, mentions Page only once.  Citing a “former senior \n50 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 51 of 54\nAmerican intelligence official,” it describes how Page’s trips to Russia “rais[ed] new concerns \namong counterintelligence agents.”  SAC ¶ 224; N.Y. Times Article at 11.31  The rest of the article \nwas  sourced  from  “interviews  with  more  than  30  current  and  former  law  enforcement, \ncongressional and other government officials.”  Id. at 2.  Page himself is quoted in both articles.  \nSee  Wash.  Post  Article  at  3  (explaining  that  the  FISA  surveillance  was  “unjustified”  and \n“politically motivated”); N.Y. Times Article at 11 (describing the Russians he met as “mostly \nscholars”).   \nPage certainly had “inquiry notice,” if not actual notice, of these articles, and thus the \nalleged leaks, when they were published in April 2017.  See Agelli v. Burwell, 164 F. Supp. 3d 69, \n75 (D.D.C. 2016) (Privacy Act claim may accrue before the plaintiff “acquires actual knowledge \nof the agency’s alleged misconduct”).  And nowhere in Page’s complaint or opposition brief does \nhe claim that he was unaware of the articles, or the potential leaks, at the time.  See generally SAC; \nPl.’s  Opp’n  at  39.    Therefore,  his  Privacy  Act  disclosure  claims  expired  two  years  after \npublication—on April 11 and April 22, 2019.  See Hill v. DOD, 981 F. Supp. 2d 1, 8 (D.D.C. 2013) \n(“Each disclosure of protected information represents a separate violation” that might trigger a \nseparate limitations period.).  This is true even though Page did not necessarily have “knowledge \nof the precise details of the disclosure.”  Id. at 7.  \nThus, contrary to his contention otherwise, Pl.’s Opp’n at 39, Page’s cause of action \naccrued, and the clock started to run, on April 11 and April 22, 2019, even though he did not then \nknow the identities of the leakers.  True, a Privacy Act plaintiff must eventually show that the \ndisclosure was intentional or willful, which may require knowing who leaked the information.  \n31 As explained above, see supra note 7, the Court may consider the Post and Times articles, \nreferenced in the complaint, in full, without converting the motion to dismiss into one for summary \njudgment.   \n51 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 52 of 54\nConvertino v. DOJ, 684 F.3d 93, 99 (D.C. Cir. 2012).  But a Privacy Act claim runs against the \nagency, so a plaintiff does not need to name the responsible individual to sue.  And more \nimportantly, while a plaintiff will need to establish more detail at the summary judgment stage, \nsee id., he does not have to “allege the full details of . . . a disclosure at the pleading stage.”  \nFeldman v. CIA, 797 F. Supp. 2d 29, 41 (D.D.C. 2011) (denying motion to dismiss where the \nplaintiff alleged that the record was protected by the Privacy Act and pled sufficient facts to infer \nits leak because various agency employees learned of its details though they had no connection to \nthe underlying investigation).  After all, “a plaintiff can hardly be expected to know the full details \nbehind an improper disclosure prior to discovery, since those details are most likely to be under \nthe  control  of  the  defendant,”  id.,  particularly  here,  where  the  articles  disclosed  sensitive \ninformation possessed only by law enforcement and intelligence agencies.   \nIn sum, Page’s complaint shows that he knew of the alleged disclosure violations in April \n2017, yet he did not file suit until November 2020.  It is evident from the face of the complaint \nthat the statute of limitations period ran in April 2019, well before Page filed suit.  See Kursar v. \nTSA, 751 F. Supp. 2d 154, 166 (D.D.C. 2010).  For this reason, the Court will dismiss Page’s \nPrivacy Act claim in Count Eight as time-barred.   \n*** \n \nAs alleged, the FBI’s conduct in preparing the FISA warrant applications to electronically \nsurveil Page was deeply “troubling.”  In re Accuracy Concerns Regarding FBI Matters Submitted \nto the FISC, Order at 2, Misc. No. 19-02 (FISA Ct. Dec. 17, 2019).  Indeed, the government has \nconceded that it lacked probable cause for two of the warrants.  In re Carter W. Page, Op. and \nOrder Regarding Use and Disclosure of Information at 2 (FISA Ct. June 25, 2020).  And the FISC \nhas found that the government violated its “duty of candor in all four applications.”  Id. at 3.  \n52 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 53 of 54\nSimilarly, Page alleges that the individual defendants intentionally provided false information and \nomitted material facts in all four applications.  SAC ¶¶ 16–20.  To the extent these allegations are \ntrue, there is little question that many individual defendants, as well as the agency as a whole, \nengaged in wrongdoing.  Even so, Page has brought no actionable claim against any individual \ndefendant or against the United States.   \nIn part, that is because Page faces at least three statutory roadblocks.  First, Congress has \nnot  created  a  private  right  of  action  against  those  who  prepare  false  or  misleading  FISA \napplications.  Both the plain language and the structure of FISA make clear that civil liability under \n50 U.S.C. § 1810 attaches only to those who conduct or perform electronic surveillance.  Second, \nCongress has not provided for damages claims against federal officers for constitutional violations \nstemming from unlawful electronic surveillance in the national security context.  And third, \nCongress has not waived the United States’s sovereign immunity for this kind of claim.  \nFor those claims that are available to Page under the law, he has failed to sufficiently allege \nor exhaust them.  He has not adequately pled that any FISA-obtained information was improperly \nused or disclosed.  To the extent that he has a viable claim under the Privacy Act, he has neither \nexhausted his administrative remedies nor filed a timely claim.  And his abuse of process claim, \nas alleged, is not cognizable under D.C. law.   \nWhen it comes to Page’s core claim—that the defendants misled the FISC to obtain \nsurveillance warrants without probable cause—the Court cannot create a cause of action that \nCongress did not enact.  “[P]rivate rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by \nCongress,” Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 286 (2001), and courts may not usurp that power \n“no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter,” id. at 287.  Any future remedy for these \nalleged FISA abuses must come from Congress, not this Court.   \n53 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 115   Filed 09/01/22   Page 54 of 54\nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court grants the individual defendants’ motions to dismiss \nand  the  government’s  motion  to  dismiss.    A  separate  order  consistent  with  this  decision \naccompanies this memorandum opinion.   \n________________________ \nDABNEY L.

No. 20-cv-3460 (DLF) \n \nJAMES B. COMEY et al., \n \n  Defendants. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nFollowing the Court’s order granting the defendants’ motions to dismiss and closing this \ncase, Carter Page filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59(e) and for relief \nfrom the judgment under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Pl.’s Mot. for \nRecons., Dkt. 119.  For the reasons that follow, the Court will deny the motion. \nI.  BACKGROUND1 \nAs explained at length in the Court’s initial opinion, see Mem. Op. at 1–9, Dkt. 115, this \ncase arises out of various FBI agents’ alleged actions to obtain four successive Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act (FISA) warrants to electronically surveil Page during the Trump 2016 campaign, \ndespite there being no probable cause to do so.  Id. at 2.  Among other things, Page alleged that \nthe FBI used reports by Christopher Steele, who “was paid by the Democratic National Committee \nand/or the Clinton campaign to perform political opposition research,” as a basis to obtain the \nFISA warrants “without adequately investigating [Steele’s] reliability and motives.”  Id. at 2–3.  \nAnd as relevant here, the complaint alleged that Igor Danchenko, “one of Steele’s key sub-\n \n1 The Court assumes familiarity with the extensive discussion of the facts set forth in its initial \nopinion.  See Mem. Op. at 1–10, Dkt. 115. \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 127   Filed 01/18/23   Page 2 of 9\nsources,” provided information to the FBI that “contradicted key claims in Steele’s reports” but \n“was not reported” in the FISA applications.  Id. at 31. \nPage’s Second Amended Complaint brought claims under the FISA and Bivens against \nindividual defendants James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Kevin Clinesmith, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, \nJoe Pientka, Stephen Somma, and Brian Auten, all individuals who worked at the FBI.  Second \nAm. Compl. (SAC) ¶¶ 256–274, 283–289, Dkt. 73.  The complaint also listed John Does 1–10 as \nindividual defendants “whose identities or specific involvement in the conduct alleged in this \nComplaint may not yet be known to the Plaintiff.”  Id. ¶¶ 34–35.  Finally, Page sued the United \nStates under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) and PATRIOT Act, id. ¶¶ 275–282, 303–311, \nand DOJ and the FBI under the Privacy Act, id. ¶¶ 290–302. \nEach of the named individual defendants and the institutional defendants moved to dismiss.  \nDkts. 80–88.  The Court granted the motions.  See Order, Dkt. 114.  It dismissed the FISA, Bivens, \nFTCA, and PATRIOT Act counts for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).  Mem. Op. at \n34–35,  38–39,  43–44.    It  further  dismissed  one  Privacy  Act  count  for  failure  to  exhaust \nadministrative remedies, id. at 49, and the other as time-barred, id. at 50.  Although the Court \ndismissed all claims without prejudice except for the Bivens claim, the Court directed that the case \nbe closed.2  Order at 1.  On September 29, 2022, Page moved to alter or amend the judgment under \nRule 59(e) and for relief from the judgment under Rule 60(b) based on newly discovered evidence \nabout the FBI’s relationship with Danchenko.  Pl’s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. for Recons. at \n2–3, Dkt. 119-1. \n \n2 The Order constituted “[t]he dismissal without prejudice of [the] action (or ‘case’),” which “is \nfinal and appealable.”  Ciralsky v. CIA, 355 F.3d 661, 666 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (“That the dismissal \nwas without prejudice to filing another suit does not make the cause unappealable, for denial of \nrelief and dismissal of the case ended this suit as far as the District Court was concerned.” (quoting \nUnited States v. Wallace & Tiernan Co., 336 U.S. 793, 794–95 n.1 (1949)). \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 127   Filed 01/18/23   Page 3 of 9\nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS \nRule 59(e) permits a party to file a “motion to alter or amend a judgment . . . no later than \n28 days after the entry of the judgment.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).  “A Rule 59(e) motion is \ndiscretionary and need not be granted unless the district court finds that there is an intervening \nchange of controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or \nprevent manifest injustice.”  Firestone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (per \ncuriam) (quotation marks omitted).  A movant cannot use a Rule 59(e) motion to raise new issues, \ntheories, or arguments that could have been presented in the course of the litigation.  Banister v. \nDavis, 140 S. Ct. 1698, 1703 (2020); Fox v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 389 F.3d 1291, 1296 (D.C. Cir. \n2004).  Instead, such a motion “must address new evidence or errors of law or fact and cannot \nmerely reargue previous factual and legal assertions,” and it will be granted “[o]nly if the moving \nparty presents new facts or a clear error of law which compel a change in the court’s ruling.”  New \nYork v. United States, 880 F. Supp. 37, 38 (D.D.C. 1995) (quotation marks omitted).   \nSimilarly, under Rule 60(b), “the court may relieve a party . . . from a final judgment” on \ngrounds including “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect”; “newly discovered \nevidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a \nnew trial under Rule 59(b)”; “fraud . . . , misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party”; \nor “any other reason that justifies relief.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (2), (3), (6).  “[A] district court \nenjoys significant discretion in deciding whether to grant or deny a Rule 60(b) motion . . . .”  \nComputer Pros. for Soc. Resp. v. U.S. Secret Serv., 72 F.3d 897, 903 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Like Rule \n59(e), “Rule 60(b) is not a vehicle for presenting theories or arguments that could have been raised \npreviously.”  Walsh v. Hagee, 10 F. Supp. 3d 15, 19 (D.D.C. 2013) (quotation marks omitted). \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 127   Filed 01/18/23   Page 4 of 9\nIII.  ANALYSIS \nIn his motion for reconsideration, Page asks the Court to reopen the case to “correct \nmistakes of fact and law” and grant him “leave to amend his SAC” based on newly discovered \nevidence.  Pl.’s Mem. at 13–14.  He also requests authorization to conduct “targeted discovery.”  \nId. at 13.  The Court will address each in turn. \nA.  Reopening the case based on newly discovered evidence \nPage alleges that, after the Court’s opinion and order issued, new evidence came to light \nthat Danchenko was a paid source for the FBI from March 2017 to October 2020 and thus had \n“been paid to assist each of the Defendants’ perpetration of their illegal activities,” which the \ndefendants “conceal[ed] . . . from this Court throughout the course of the current litigation.”  Id. at \n2, 5.  Page understands this new information to imply that the individual defendants “deliberately \nput one of the fabricators of the Steele Dossier on FBI payroll in order to keep him quiet and further \ncover up the individual FBI Defendants’ misdeeds.”  Id. at 17 (emphasis omitted); see also id. at \n16–19.  Based on this new evidence, Page “moves the Court to alter and/or amend the final order” \ndismissing his Second Amended Complaint and closing the case.  Id. at 13. \nSuch relief is not warranted.  Troubling as the Danchenko allegation may be, it does not \n“compel the court to change its prior position” on any count.  Nat’l Ctr. for Mfg. Scis. v. Dep’t of \nDef., 199 F.3d 507, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  Rather, the alleged new evidence would not affect the \nanalyses dismissing the claims against either the individual or institutional defendants.  \nAs to the individual defendants, the new facts have no bearing on the Court’s rationale for \ndismissing the FISA claims.3  The Court reasoned that Page’s FISA claims “fail[ed] for two \nreasons”:  (1) FISA “does not allow for aiding and abetting liability,” Mem. Op.  at 19–20; and \n \n3 Page does not challenge the dismissal of the Bivens claims against the individual defendants. \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 127   Filed 01/18/23   Page 5 of 9\n(2) it applies only to those “who participate[] in collecting the target’s communications using \ncertain devices,” which Page’s complaint did not allege for any individual defendant, id. at 26, 28–\n29.  Even assuming the new allegations about a coverup involving Danchenko are true, those two \nlegal conclusions remain unaffected.  While Page suggests that the Danchenko evidence supports \na “civil conspiracy” theory of liability, see Pl.’s Reply at 4–5, Dkt. 124, that argument fails for the \nsame reason his aiding-and-abetting theory failed.  Mem. Op. at 20 (“[S]tatutory silence on the \nsubject of secondary liability means there is none.” (quotation marks omitted)); see also Broidy \nCap. Mgmt. LLC v. Muzin, No. 19-cv-0150, 2020 WL 1536350, at *11 (D.D.C. Mar. 31, 2020), \naff’d,  12  F.4th  789  (D.C.  Cir.  2021)  (“The  same  principle  applies  to  bar  recovery  from \ncoconspirators . . . .”).   \nMoreover,  Page’s  assertion  that  Danchenko  himself  was  a  “device”  by  which  the \ndefendants collected communications, Pl.’s Reply at 17, is likewise unconvincing.  Page defines \n“device” to include “[a] scheme to trick or deceive.”  Id. (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary (11th \ned. 2019)).  But his definition is plainly at odds with the statutory language, which speaks of “the \ninstallation of . . . an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device,” 50 U.S.C. § 1801(f)(1), \n(4) (emphasis added), and the Court’s explanation of that term, which emphasizes that using a \ndevice “is distinct from the process of getting a warrant,” Mem. Op. at 22–23.  Therefore, even if \na coverup helped secure the warrants, it cannot be considered a “device” for purposes of FISA. \nAs  to  the  institutional defendants,  the  new  evidence  does  not  impact  the  statute  of \nlimitations analysis for dismissing Page’s Privacy Act claim.4  See id. at 50–52.  The Court \nreasoned that Page knew about alleged leaks to media outlets “when [the relevant articles] were \npublished in April 2017,” even if “he did not then know the identities of the leakers” or details of \n \n4 Page does not challenge the dismissal of his other Privacy Act claim due to failure to exhaust.   \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 127   Filed 01/18/23   Page 6 of 9\nthe leaks.  Id. at 51.  Thus, the Court concluded, Page’s “Privacy Act disclosure claims expired \ntwo years after publication,” id., and his suit (brought more than three-and-a-half years later) was \ntime-barred.  Id. at 52.  Again, the Danchenko allegations are irrelevant.  Even if the new evidence \ndid show that the defendants engaged in “material and willfull [sic] misrepresentations,” Pl.’s \nReply at 23, those misrepresentations would not negate Page’s inquiry notice of any Privacy Act \nviolations when the articles containing alleged leaks were published.  See Mem. Op. at 51.  Page’s \narguments to the contrary reference the portion of the Court’s opinion discussing—and rejecting—\nwhether the FISA claims were time barred, see Pl.’s Mem. at 25–26 (citing Mem. Op. at 16), and \nare inapposite for the Privacy Act conclusion.5 \nTo the extent Page challenges the dismissal of the remaining claims against the institutional \ndefendants, see Pl.’s Reply at 12–13 (FTCA claim); id. at 18–22 (PATRIOT Act claim), he did \nnot raise those arguments in his motion and the Court will not consider “issues raised for the first \ntime in a reply brief.”  Rollins Env’t Servs. (NJ) Inc. v. EPA, 937 F.2d 649, 653 n.2 (D.C. Cir. \n1991).  And even if the Court did consider them, the arguments would fail for the same reason: \nwhether or not Danchenko was a paid FBI informant does not impact the analyses as to either \nclaim.  See Mem. Op. at 40 (dismissing FTCA claim because Page did not allege that “the \ndefendants used the warrants wrongfully”); id. at 41–45 (dismissing PATRIOT Act claim due to \nsovereign immunity, failure to exhaust, and failure to plausibly allege that the government \nimproperly “used or disclosed FISA information”). \n \n5 Page’s remaining arguments about FISA’s legislative history and statutory interpretation, see \nPl.’s Mem. at 20–23; Pl.’s Reply at 18–19, and the Privacy Act’s statute of limitations, see Pl.’s \nMem. at 26–27, are legal theories that “could have [been] raised before the decision issued” and \nthe Court will not address them now.  Banister, 140 S. Ct. at 1703. \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 127   Filed 01/18/23   Page 7 of 9\nBecause the newly discovered information about Danchenko would not “compel a change \nin the court’s ruling” on any claim, it does not support altering, amending, or granting relief from \nthe Court’s order dismissing Page’s complaint and closing the case.  New York, 880 F. Supp. at 38 \n(quotation marks omitted).  As a result, Page’s motion for leave to amend necessarily fails.  See \nPl.’s Mem. at 17, 19–20.  “[O]nce a final judgment has been entered, a court cannot permit an \namendment unless the plaintiff ‘first satisfies Rule 59(e)’s more stringent standard’ for setting \naside that judgment.”  Ciralsky, 355 F.3d at 673 (quoting Firestone, 76 F.3d at 1208 (alteration \nomitted)).  “Since the court decline[s] to set aside the judgment under Rule 59(e),” Page’s “motion \nto amend under Rule 15(a) [is] moot.”  Id.6 \nB.  Conducting targeted discovery \nPage also asks for discovery to enable him “to learn sufficient details to plead the relevant \ncauses of action.”  Pl.’s Mem. at 13.  Specifically, he seeks to uncover “[w]hat exactly the \n[d]efendants . . . disclosed to journalists,” “[w]hat . . . the [d]efendants kn[ew] about the partisan, \npolitical motivations of the surveillance of Page,” and the identities of John Does 1–10, “the \nindividuals who ‘engaged in’ the mechanics of the FISA surveillance.”  Id. at 24–25.  The Court \nwill deny these requests. \nFirst, Page has not provided grounds for this relief under Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b).  These \ndiscovery requests are not related to the newly discovered evidence, nor has Page identified any \n“intervening change of controlling law . . . or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest \n \n6 To the extent Page wishes to bring new causes of action, see, e.g., Pl.’s Reply at 14–15 (quoting \n42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)), the Court notes that his Second Amended Complaint was dismissed without \nprejudice to refiling a new suit.  See Order at 1.  Page has provided no argument or reason to \nbelieve that that dismissal unfairly prejudiced him due to, for example, a statute of limitations \nconcern.  See Ciralsky, 355 F.3d at 674 (remanding for the district court to consider “the [statute \nof limitations] consequences of denial” of a Rule 59(e) decision, but ultimately “leav[ing] the \nchoice entirely in the hands of the district court” (quotation marks omitted)). \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 127   Filed 01/18/23   Page 8 of 9\ninjustice.”  Firestone, 76 F.3d at 1208 (quotation marks omitted).  Rules 59(e) and 60(b) are thus \nnot the proper vehicle for these requests, which could have been presented earlier.  Id.; Walsh, 10 \nF. Supp. 3d at 19. \nIn any event, Page’s discovery requests fail for a second reason.  “A plaintiff may not ‘use \ndiscovery to obtain the facts necessary to establish a claim that is plausible on its face pursuant to \n[the] Twombly and Iqbal [pleading standards]—even when those facts are only within the head or \nhands of the defendant.’”  Ambellu v. Re’ese Adbarat Debre Selam Kidist Mariam, 406 F. Supp. \n3d 72, 83 (D.D.C. 2019), aff’d, No. 19-7124, 2020 WL 873574 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 14, 2020) (quoting \nFelder v. WMATA, 105 F. Supp. 3d 52, 59 (D.D.C. 2015)).  Page is not entitled to conduct “a \nfishing expedition” to discover new potential claims he may bring against the defendants.  Id. at \n82 (quoting Bastin v. Fed. Nat’l Mortgage Ass’n, 104 F.3d 1392, 1396 (D.C. Cir. 1997)); see also \nMama Cares Found. v. Nutriset Societe Par Actions Cimplifiee, 825 F. Supp. 2d 178, 184 (D.D.C. \n2011) (“[T]he discovery rules are designed to assist a party to prove a claim it reasonably believes \nto be viable without discovery, not to find out if it has any basis for a claim.” (quotation marks \nomitted)).   \nPage’s request for discovery to learn the identities of the John Does fares no better.  Courts \ndo sometimes allow cases to proceed against “‘John Doe’ defendants, but only in situations where \nthe otherwise unavailable identity of the defendant will eventually be made known through \ndiscovery.”  Newdow v. Roberts, 603 F.3d 1002, 1010 (D.C. Cir. 2010).  That exception is not \napplicable here.  Page’s complaint does not detail any alleged wrongdoing by the John Does.  See \nSAC ¶¶ 34–35 (stating that Does’ “specific involvement in the conduct alleged in this Complaint \n[was] not yet [] known to the Plaintiff”).  The complaint later states that unknown individuals \nengaged in surveillance of Page pursuant to the FISA warrants, id. ¶¶ 140–141, but makes no \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460-DLF   Document 127   Filed 01/18/23   Page 9 of 9\nattempt to link that action to any cause of action.7  Thus, this is a very different case from Malibu \nMedia, LLC v. Doe, 64 F. Supp. 3d 47, 48–50 (D.D.C. 2014), which permitted jurisdictional \ndiscovery “to learn the identity of putative defendants.”  See Pl.’s Mem. at 23.  There, the complaint \nplausibly alleged that John Doe violated the Copyright Act, and discovery was permitted to \nuncover his identity and ensure personal jurisdiction.  Malibu Media, 64 F. Supp. 3d at 48–50.  By \ncontrast, Page has not alleged any claim against John Does 1–10.  Thus, discovery would, once \nagain, “amount to nothing more than a fishing expedition” to uncover wrongdoing that he has not \nalready plausibly alleged.  Bastin, 104 F.3d at 1396.  Page’s “[m]ere conjecture or speculation” of \nwrongdoing by John Does 1–10 “is not enough to justify jurisdictional discovery.”   Malibu Media, \n64 F. Supp. 3d at 48 (quotation marks omitted); see also Landwehr v. FDIC, 282 F.R.D. 1, 4–5 \n(D.D.C. 2010) (explaining that plaintiffs could not “maintain their claims against the ‘Doe’ \ndefendants” given “the complete absence of any specific allegations against” them). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the plaintiff’s motion to alter or amend the judgment and for \nrelief from the judgment is denied.  A separate order consistent with this decision accompanies \nthis memorandum opinion.   \n________________________ \nDABNEY L.

On November 10, 2020, Defendant Andrew McCabe testified in front of the Senate \nJudiciary  Hearing  that  “any  material  misrepresentation  or  error  in  a  FISA  application  is \nunacceptable. Period. The FBI should be held to the standard of scrupulous accuracy that the \n[FISA] court demands.”  When pushed to explain “Who is responsible for ruining Mr. Carter \nPage’s life?” McCabe finally responded, “We are all responsible for the work that went into that \nFISA.”  This lawsuit seeks that accountability and damages against the individuals and agencies \nwho wronged Plaintiff, Carter W. Page (“Dr. Page”). \n2.  Specifically, Dr. Page seeks relief herein for Defendants’ multiple violations of his \nConstitutional and other legal rights in connection with unlawful surveillance and investigation of \nhim by the United States Government. Dr. Page was targeted because of his lawful association \nwith  the  2016  Presidential  campaign  of  Donald  Trump.  Dr.  Page  is  entitled  to  relief  for \nDefendants’ unjustified and illegal actions (including violations of federal criminal law), which \nviolated federal statutes enacted to prevent unlawful spying on United States persons, as well as \nthe Constitution.  \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 3 of 59\n \n3.  The complained of misconduct occurred in connection with the submission of four \nfalse and misleading warrant  applications to engage in electronic surveillance of Dr. Page, \nostensibly pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”). Four separate Article \nIII judges unwittingly approved the false applications, submitted in October 2016, January 2017, \nApril 2017, and June 2017, thereby unlawfully resulting in spying on Dr. Page. As has now been \nadmitted  by  (i)    the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  (“DOJ”),  (and  (ii)  the  Federal  Bureau  of \nInvestigation (“FBI”), and/or has been acknowledged by (iii) the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt (“FISC”), the four separate applications for FISA warrants and renewals (collectively, the \n“FISA Warrants”1) to surveil Dr. Page were submitted despite there being no probable cause to \nsuspect that Dr. Page was acting as a Foreign Agent of Russia. Consequently, the Defendants’ \nunlawful actions allowed them to illegally spy (domestically and internationally) on Dr. Page, a \npatriotic American citizen. \n4.  The Defendants’ conduct, which began not later than August 2016, and continued \nthrough at least September 2017, constituted a fraud on the FISC and violated the Constitutional \nand other rights of Dr. Page.  \nI.  OVERVIEW OF THE VIOLATIONS \n5.  On July  31, 2016, the  FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation named \nOperation Crossfire Hurricane, putatively concerning the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA), \nto determine whether “individual(s) associated with the Trump campaign are witting of and/or \n \n1 For clarity, the four separate FISA Warrants when discussed individually are referred to \nherein in the order of the application submitted to the FISC. For example, the October 2016 \nFISA application is the “First FISA Warrant”, and first renewal submitted in January 2017 is \nreferenced as the “Second FISA Warrant”, while  the April and June 2017 FISA renewal \napplications are referenced as the “Third FISA Warrant” and “Fourth FISA Warrant,” \nrespectively.  \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 4 of 59\n \ncoordinating activities with the Government of Russia.” Soon thereafter, Dr. Page and three other \nindividuals with whom he had little or no relationship were targeted by the FBI in the Crossfire \nHurricane investigation.  \n6.  The FBI investigation soon devolved into an effort to obtain from the FISC a FISA \nwarrant authorizing spying and electronic surveillance on Dr. Page. \n7.  The FBI did not have probable cause to lawfully obtain a FISA warrant.  Instead, \nthe FBI used documents furnished by Christopher Steele, a Confidential Human Source (“CHS”). \nAs the Crossfire Hurricane team knew, CHS Steele had been paid by the Democratic Party and/or \nthe Hillary Clinton presidential campaign to perform “political opposition research” and dig up \ndirt on a connection between the Trump campaign and Russia in order to divert attention from the \ninvestigation of Clinton’s email practices while she was Secretary of State. \n8.  In accordance with core principles of the U.S. Constitution, reinforced by the \nnation’s legal and cultural aversion to spying on its citizens, Congress and the executive branch \nhave enacted rigorous requirements that must be met before electronic surveillance of a U.S. \ncitizen is legally permitted.  To surveil an American citizen, the FISA requires that there be \nprobable cause that the target is an “agent of a foreign power” who is “knowingly engag[ing]…in \nclandestine intelligence activities.”  In short, to legitimately obtain a FISA warrant against Dr. \nPage, the FBI had to demonstrate that he was a Russian agent who was knowingly engaging in \nintelligence activities on behalf of Russia. \n9.  On  August  17,  2016,  shortly  after  the  inception  of  the  Crossfire  Hurricane \ninvestigation, the Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”), provided information regarding Dr. Page \nto members of the Crossfire Hurricane team. This information established that Dr. Page had been \na CIA “operational contact” from 2008 – 2013 (and had similar interactions with the FBI).  \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 5 of 59\n \nDr. Page had assisted the CIA in combatting intelligence-related activities pursued by Russia and \nother foreign countries against the United States’ interests. Further, the CIA’s employee had given \na positive assessment of Dr. Page’s candor. Further, on September 7, 2016, the CIA sent an \ninvestigative  referral  to  FBI  Director  James  Comey  and  Deputy  Assistant  Director  of \nCounterintelligence  Peter  Strzok  advising  them  that  Hillary  Clinton  had  approved  a  plan \nconcerning U.S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian hackers hampering U.S. \nelections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private mail server. (Letter of \nDirector of National Intelligence, dated September 29, 2020.) \n10.  During this same investigative phase, the FBI used a second CHS to surreptitiously \nask Dr. Page about his activities.  In this monitored conversation,  Dr. Page denied that he either: \n(i) knew anything about improper or unlawful communications or activities between Russian and \nAmerican citizens, or (ii) had engaged in any improper—much less illegal—activity with any \nindividual that was harmful to the interests of the United States.  This conversation was recorded \nwithout Dr. Page’s knowledge and was provided to the FBI. \n11.  On  September  19,  2016,  as  referenced  above,  the  FBI  received  information \nregarding Dr. Page from CHS Steele.  In particular, two documents, prepared by CHS Steele, \nfalsely alleged unlawful communications and activities involving Dr. Page and two Russians with \nclose ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.  The FBI “focused on” these two documents from \nSteele to base its claim that there was probable cause to obtain a FISA warrant against Dr. Page.   \n12.  On September 23, 2016, an article was published in  YAHOO! NEWS alleging \nmeetings between Dr. Page and the same two Russian individuals.  The FBI treated this article as \ncorroboration for CHS Steele’s claims when, in fact, Steele was also the source for the Yahoo \narticle.  Further, on September 25, 2016, Dr. Page sent a letter to then-FBI Director Comey in \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 6 of 59\n \nwhich he categorically denied that he had any such communications with the Russian individuals \nand documented his previous cooperation with the CIA and the FBI to combat Russian spying. \nThese false allegations against Dr. Page made by CHS Steele were not investigated by the FBI in \naccordance with its own manuals and procedures. For the FBI to disregard its procedures was \nparticularly egregious in this case because the FBI knew that CHS Steele: (a) was being paid to \nprovide political “opposition research” on this topic; (b) was essentially the exclusive source of \ninformation supporting probable cause for the FISA warrant applications, and (c) the CIA had \nwarned the FBI of a potential political scheme involving false reporting of collaboration between \nthe Trump campaign and Russians.   \n13.  The more fundamental problem was that the FBI was so intent on obtaining a FISA \nwarrant to enable it to spy on the Trump campaign that it did not fully and accurately disclose to \nthe FISC the evidence it had obtained as to whether Dr. Page was a Russian agent.  To persuade \nthe FISC that there was probable cause to believe that Dr. Page was a Russian agent, the \nDefendants provided false or misleading information to the FISC.      \n14.  The FBI did not advise the FISC that Page had been for many years an “operational \ncontact” of the CIA.  The FBI did not advise the FISC that CHS Steele had been paid by the \nDemocrat party and/or the Clinton campaign to provide opposition research on Donald Trump.  \nThe FBI did not advise the FISC that Steele’s source (“Primary Sub-source\") of information \nagainst Dr. Page had himself been investigated for attempting to recruit Americans to help spy for \nRussia.  The FBI did not advise the FISC that Steele’s Primary Sub-source contradicted critical \ninformation that Steele attributed to him.  Instead, the FBI represented to the FISC that the Primary \nSub-source was “credible,” without disclosing to the FISC that what the Primary Sub-Source had \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 7 of 59\n \n“credibly” reported to the FBI was that the information Steele attributed to him was inaccurate and \nmisleading. \n15.  Ultimately an FBI attorney altered an email from the CIA in order to falsely deny \nthat Dr. Page had been a CIA source serving for many years as an operational contact.   \n16.  In reality, there was no “probable cause” to support surveillance of Dr. Page. If FBI \nprocedures had been followed and an honest and thorough investigation conducted, and if the FBI \nhad fully and accurately reported what it knew, the FISA warrants against Dr. Page would neither \nhave been sought nor issued.     \n17.  The individual Defendants fabricated or intentionally disregarded critical evidence, \nand misled the FISC, in order to obtain the FISA warrants. This case is about holding accountable \nthe entities and individuals who are responsible for the most egregious violation and abuse of the \nFISA statute since it was enacted over forty years ago. \n \nII.  PARTIES \n18.  Plaintiff Carter W. Page is a natural person who is a United States citizen. Dr. Page \nis a graduate of the United States Naval Academy who served on active duty in the United States \nNavy (including deployments at sea and other assignments worldwide, many in intelligence-\nrelated billets) from 1993 until 1998, reaching the rank of Lieutenant. After completing his active \nmilitary service, Dr. Page served as an International Affairs Fellow at the Council on Foreign \nRelations and focused his research on energy-related developments in the strategically important \nCaspian  Sea  region.  Dr.  Page  earned  a  Master  of  Arts  degree  in  National  Security  from \nGeorgetown University while on active duty, and subsequently completed the MBA program at \nNew York University (“NYU”) in 2001. This led to a position as an investment banker with Merrill \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 8 of 59\n \nLynch. Dr. Page eventually became the Chief Operating Officer of Merrill Lynch's energy and \npower group in New York. In 2012, Dr. Page was awarded his Ph.D. degree from SOAS University \nof London (School of Oriental and African Studies). He ran the Globalization and International \nAffairs program at Bard College in New York, and subsequently returned to NYU to teach courses \non energy and politics. During the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, Dr. Page was a volunteer \nmember of an informal foreign policy advisory committee to then-candidate Donald J. Trump's \nelection campaign.  Although a campaign volunteer, Dr. Carter never met or spoke to then-\ncandidate Trump. \nA.  Entity Defendants \n19.  Defendant United States of America is sued for Dr. Page’s injuries caused by the \nwrongful acts of its employees acting within the scope or office of their employment. \n20.  Defendant Federal Bureau of Investigation is a bureau within the United States \nDepartment of Justice with offices at 935 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20535. \nReferences to any actions taken by FBI in this Complaint encompass its officials, appointees, \nemployees, agents, and/or contractors, both known and unknown to Plaintiff.  \n21.  Defendant United States Department of Justice is an executive agency of the United \nStates with offices at 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20530, and includes its \nOffice of Inspector General (“DOJ OIG”). References to any actions taken by DOJ or DOJ OIG \nin this Complaint encompass their officials, appointees, employees, agents, and/or contractors, \nboth known and unknown to Plaintiff. \nB.  Individual Defendants \n22.  The individuals named herein have responsibility and liability for the legal claims \nidentified herein, as set forth above and below. In addition, individuals as yet unidentified or \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 9 of 59\n \nunknown to Plaintiff are also responsible and liable for the legal claims set forth herein. Because \nof the clandestine and classified or “law enforcement sensitive” protected nature of the actions \ntaken in pursuit of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation and the FISA warrant applications, and \nthe protection given to the identity of individuals by the DOJ OIG in the Horowitz Report, Plaintiff \nis as yet unable to identify by name these additional individuals. \n23.  Defendant James Comey was the Director of the FBI from September 2013 to May \n2017. Defendant verified under penalty of perjury three false FISA warrant affidavits regarding \nDr. Page in October 2016, January 2017, and April 2017. He was dismissed by the President of \nthe United States on May 9, 2017. He is sued in his individual capacity. \n24.  Defendant Andrew McCabe was the Deputy Director of the FBI from February \n2016 to January 2018. He was an original and primary participant in the Crossfire Hurricane \ninvestigation. Defendant McCabe was the FBI’s lead signatory of the final FISA renewal affidavit \nagainst Dr. Page in June 2017. He is sued in his individual capacity. \n25.  Defendant Kevin Clinesmith was an Assistant General Counsel in the National \nSecurity and Cyber Law Branch of the FBI’s Office of General Counsel from July 2015 to \nSeptember 2019.  In August 2020, Mr. Clinesmith “pleaded guilty . . . in the U.S. District Court \nfor the District of Columbia to a false statement offense based on intentionally altering an email \nin connection with the submission of the FISA renewal application against Dr. Page.”  (DOJ Press \nRelease, Aug. 19, 2020).  See Information, U.S.A. v. Clinesmith, No. 20-cr-00165-JEB (D.D.C. \nAug. 14, 2020).  He is sued in his individual capacity. \n26.  Defendant Peter Strzok was a career FBI agent until August 2018 and served as \nDeputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence.  He supervised the investigation of Dr. Page \nuntil approximately January 2017.  He is sued in his individual capacity. \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 10 of 59\n \n27.  Defendant Lisa Page is a former lawyer at the FBI.  She is sued in her individual \ncapacity. \n28.  Joe Pientka III, during the relevant period, served as a Supervisory Special Agent \nof a Foreign Counterintelligence Squad at the FBI's Washington Field Office.  He is sued in his \nindividual capacity. \n29.  Stephen Somma, a.k.a. “Steve Holt,” is an FBI agent. (He originally presented \nhimself as “Steve Holt” to Dr. Page during a series of meetings in March 2017.) According to the \nDOJ OIG, Mr. Somma is “primarily responsible for some of the most significant errors and \nomissions in the FISA applications” against Dr. Page.”  He is sued in his individual capacity. \n30.  Brian J. Auten was an FBI Supervisory Intelligence Analyst.  He is sued in his \nindividual capacity. \n31.  John Does #1 – 10, individuals whose identities or specific involvement in the \nconduct alleged in this Complaint may not yet be known to the Plaintiff, are sued in their respective \nindividual capacities. \n32.  Jane Does #1 – 10, individuals whose identities or specific involvement in the \nconduct alleged in this Complaint may not yet be known to the Plaintiff, are sued in their respective \nindividual capacities. \n \nIII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE  \n33.  This Court has original subject matter jurisdiction over Dr. Page’s federal claims \nunder 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1346(b)(1) because they arise under federal law and because the \nUnited States is a defendant.  \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 11 of 59\n \n34.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over the individual defendants who reside \noutside the District of Columbia, pursuant to D.C. Code § 13-423(a)(3), as Plaintiff’s claims for \nrelief arise from their acts, directly or by an agent, causing tortious injury in the District of \nColumbia by an act or omission in the District of Columbia. \n35.  This  Court  has  personal  jurisdiction  over  the  federal  government  defendants \npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2712, 28 U.S.C. § 2674, 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(1)(D), and 5 U.S.C. § \n552(a)(4)(B).   \n36.  Venue is proper in the District of Columbia pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) \nbecause this is where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred \nand this is where the government entities are located. \n \nIV.  THE FISA APPLICATIONS AND WARRANTS \nA.  The FISA Warrants Were Unlawful - Admissions and Rulings \n37.  The four FISA warrants to surveil Dr. Page were obtained unlawfully because there \nwas not probable cause to seek them.  The warrants were issued only because of the FBI’s \nomissions and misrepresentations to the FISC. \n38.  The December 2019 report entitled Review of Four FISA Applications and Other \nAspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation issued by the DOJ OIG (“Horowitz \nReport”), the analysis from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, findings in Special \nCounsel Mueller’s Report, and rulings of the FISC establish that there is not and never was any \nevidence that Dr. Page acted in concert with Russia or its agents—because he did not—and that \nthe four FISA warrants to surveil him were unlawful.  \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 12 of 59\n \n39.  The Horowitz Report established numerous material failures by the FBI to follow \nthe Woods Procedures and other DOJ and FBI policies. Among other things, the FBI failed to \nverify the accuracy of information included in the warrant applications. In many instances, the FBI \neither had no supporting documentation, misrepresented what the supporting documentation \nstated, or the supporting documentation showed that the factual assertion made in the application \nwas incorrect. In total, the Horowitz Report found 17 distinct, significant errors and omissions in \nthe FISA Warrant applications submitted regarding Dr. Page.  \n40.  Since not a single proven fact ever established complicity with Russia involving \nDr. Page, there never was probable cause to seek or obtain the FISA Warrants targeting him on \nthis basis.  The DOJ now assesses, and has formally admitted to the FISC, that with respect to at \nleast the last two warrant applications, \"if not earlier, there was insufficient predication to establish \nprobable cause to believe that [Dr.] Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power.\" \n41.  In this vein, two Deputy Attorney Generals, Sally Yates and Rod Rosenstein, who \nsigned and approved FISA warrant applications regarding Dr. Page, have testified they would not \nhave signed the applications had they known of the misrepresentations and omissions at the time \nthey signed the applications.  \n42.  Further, the DOJ has admitted in letters submitted to the FISC, under FISC Rule \n13(a), that there were material omissions and misstatements in the FISA warrants applications. \nThese letters include but are not limited to, the following:  Preliminary Supplemental Rule 13(a) \nletter regarding applications submitted to the Court targeting Carter W Page in Docket Numbers \n2016-1182, 2017-0052, 2017-0375, and 2017-0679 (Oct. 25, 2019); Supplemental Rule 13(a) \nletter regarding applications submitted to the Court targeting Carter W. Page in Docket Numbers \n2016-1182, 2017-0052, 2017-0375, and 2017-0679 (Nov. 27, 2019); Additional Rule 13(a) letter \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 13 of 59\n \nregarding applications submitted to the Court targeting Carter W. Page in Docket Numbers 2016-\n1182, 2017-0052, 2017-0375, and 2017-0679 (Dec. 9, 2019). \n43.  In addition, the FISC has issued several rulings, (authored by the former FISC chief, \nthe Honorable Rosemary M. Collyer, and the current FISC Chief, the Honorable James E. \nBoasberg),  finding  that  the  warrants  to  surveil  Dr.  Page  contained  material  omissions  and \nmisstatements, lacked candor, and/or that the warrants were not lawfully obtained. \n44.  For example, by order dated December 17, 2019 at page 3, the FISC stated: “The \nfrequency with which representations made by FBI personnel turned out to be unsupported or \ncontradicted  by  information  in  their  possession,  and  with  which  they  withheld  information \ndetrimental  to  their  case,  calls  into  question  whether  information  contained  in  other  FBI \napplications is reliable.” \n45.  And, by Order of Jan. 7, 2020 Regarding Handling and Disposition of Information, \nthe FISC states: “The Court understands the government to have concluded, in view of the material \nmisstatements and omissions, that the Court's authorizations in Docket Numbers 17-375 and 17- \n679 were not valid. The government apparently does not take a position on the validity of the \nauthorizations in Docket Numbers 16-1182 and 17-52, but intends to sequester information \nacquired pursuant to those dockets in the same manner as information acquired pursuant to the \nsubsequent dockets.” \n46.  In an order dated March 5, 2020, the FISC said: “There is thus little doubt that the \ngovernment breached its duty of candor to the Court with respect to those applications [involving \nDr. Page].” The FISC then said: “The frequency and seriousness of these errors in a case that, \ngiven its sensitive nature, had an unusually high level of review at both DOJ and the Federal \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 14 of 59\n \nBureau of Investigation have called into question the reliability of the information proffered in \nother FBI applications.” \n47.  Further, in an order dated June 25, 2020 (declassified on September 11, 2020), the \nFISC said: “The government acknowledges that there were material omissions, and the Court has \nfound violations of the government's duty of candor, in all four applications [regarding Dr. Page].”   \nIn analyzing what lawful use may now be made of the results of the surveillance of Dr. Page (such \nas Dr. Page using them as proof in a lawsuit against the government) the FISC observed: “[50 \nU.S.C.] §§ 1809(a)(2) and 1827(a)(2) specifically address the circumstances of this case, where \nwe already know that information was obtained through unlawful surveillance and search,  . . .”  \n(emphasis added).  \n48.  While the DOJ admitted to the FISC that the third and fourth FISA warrants were \nnot valid, neither was it prepared to defend the first and second warrants.  As the FISC noted in its \norder of June 25, 2020: \nAs noted above, the government admits that at least the third and fourth Page applications \nlacked adequate factual support. See Dec. 9, 2019, Letter at 2, 19. It further admits that \n\"the  restrictions  on  use  or  disclosure  in  Sections  1809  and  1827  apply  at  least\"  to \ninformation acquired under color of the third and fourth dockets, without addressing \nwhether they apply to information acquired under color of the first two dockets. See Feb. \n5, 2020, Resp. at 28. In fact, in response to the Court's directive to explain why retaining \nthe  Page  FISA  information  \"in  the  manner  intended  by  the  government,  and  any \ncontemplated use or disclosure of it,\" comport with§§ 1809(a)(2) and 1827(a)(2), Jan. 7, \n2020,  Order  at  2,  the  government  declined  to  argue,  even  alternatively,  that  those \nprovisions do not apply (or apply differently) to information obtained under the first two \ndockets. See Feb. 5, 2020, Resp. at 28-29. Under the circumstances, the Court will assume \nthat§§ l 809(a)(2) and l 827(a)(2) apply to information acquired under color of the first and \nsecond dockets just as, per the government's admission, they apply to information acquired \nunder color of the third and fourth. \n \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 15 of 59\n \nB.  The FISA Warrants Were Unlawful - Federal Laws and Procedures Violated \n49.  To obtain these unlawful warrants, the Defendants, known and unknown, violated \nnumerous laws, rules, regulations, policies, and procedures. \n50.  To surveil an American citizen, the FISA requires that there be probable cause \nestablishing two elements. First, that the person is acting on behalf of a foreign power. And second, \nthat the American citizen is engaged, in their capacity as a foreign agent, in one of five specified \nactivities: current or future criminal conduct, sabotage, terrorism, using a false identity, or abetting \nsomeone engaged these activities. (50 USC 1801(b)(2)). \n51.  Moreover, the FISA requires that certain information be represented to the FISC to \nobtain an initial warrant and to obtain a renewal of a warrant. (50 USC §§ 1804; 1805.) \n52.  The Defendants, known and unknown, failed in numerous and material ways to \ncomply with the requirements of the FISA, made misstatements and misrepresentations, and \nomitted relevant and necessary information in seeking the FISA warrants against Dr. Page. \n53.  The FISC also has a set of rules governing the presentation of warrant applications \nto it. Significantly, one of these rules, Rule 13a, requires the government to immediately correct \nany misstatement or omission of material fact in a warrant application.   \n54.  FISC Rule 13 provides: \nCorrection  of  Material  Facts.  If  the  government  discovers  that  a \nsubmission to the Court contained a misstatement or omission of material fact, the \ngovernment,  in  writing,  must  immediately  inform  the  Judge  to  whom  the \nsubmission was made of:  \n(1) the misstatement or omission;  \n(2) any necessary correction;  \n(3) the facts and circumstances relevant to the misstatement or omission;  \n(4) any modifications the government has made or proposes to make in how \nit will implement any authority or approval granted by the Court; and  \n(5) how the government proposes to dispose of or treat any information \nobtained as a result of the misstatement or omission. \n \n15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 16 of 59\n \n55.  Defendants, known and unknown, did not comply with the FISC rules, made \nmisstatements and misrepresentations, and omitted relevant and necessary information in seeking \nthe FISA warrants against Dr. Page. \n56.  In addition, Defendants, known and unknown, were required to follow the FBI’s \nown policies and procedures for conducting investigations (criminal and counterintelligence), but \nfailed to do so in numerous and material ways in the investigation of Dr. Page. \n57.  Defendants, known and unknown, were required to comply with the “Woods \nProcedures,” dated April 5, 2001 (as amended), which are a set of procedures designed to ensure \nthe accuracy of the factual assertions in an application for a FISA Warrant.   Each warrant \napplication submitted with respect to Dr. Page included a certification to the FISC that “The FBI \nhas reviewed this verified application for accuracy in accordance with its April 5, 2001 procedures \n….”  But Defendants, known and unknown, failed in numerous and material ways to comply with \nthe Woods Procedures, as explained in the Horowitz Report and DOJ letters and filings to the \nFISC. \n58.  As a result of their failure to follow these laws, rules, regulations, policies and \nprocedures, and as a result of the way they conducted these investigations, and the way they \nmisrepresented, misstated and omitted information, Defendants, known and unknown, violated Dr. \nPage’s right under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to be free of unreasonable \nsearches and seizures. \n   \n16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 17 of 59\n \nV.  THE FOUR FISA WARRANTS \nThis complaint discusses some, but not all, of the material misrepresentations and \nomissions infecting each of the FISA Warrants. \nA.  The First FISA Warrant \n59.  On or about August 17, 2016, the CIA delivered materials to “certain members” of \nthe Crossfire Hurricane team documenting that Carter Page was an “operational contact.”    \n60.  On September 7, 2016, the CIA sent an investigation referral to FBI Director James \nComey and Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Strzok regarding \"U.S. Presidential \ncandidate Hillary Clinton's approval of a plan concerning U.S. Presidential candidate Donald \nTrump and Russian hackers hampering U.S. elections as a means of distracting the public from \nher use of a private mail server.\"  \n61.  In August 2016, then-Associate Attorney General Bruce Ohr, whose wife worked \nfor political opposition research firm Fusion GPS, briefed Steele’s accusations regarding Dr. Page \nto Andrew McCabe and his counsel, Lisa Page.  \n62.  On or about September 19, 2016, Steele gave six reports to the FBI, with two of \nthese  reports  mentioning  Dr.  Page  by  name.  These  reports  alleged  improper  or  unlawful \ncommunications or activities between Dr. Page and two sanctioned Russians with close ties to \nRussian President Vladimir Putin.  Michael Gaeta, the FBI Agent assigned to “handle” Steele as a \nCHS, said that it was “obvious” Steele’s work was “politically motivated.”  \n63.  The FBI did not conduct any meaningful investigation of Steele’s allegation- that \nthere was a “well-developed conspiracy of cooperation between the Trump Campaign and Russia,” \nutilizing Dr. Page as an intermediary. \n17 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 18 of 59\n \n64.  Pursuant to the terms of his CHS agreement with the FBI, Steele was prohibited \nfrom talking to the media about the allegations in the Steele Reports. A September 23, 2016 \nYAHOO! NEWS article alleged that meetings had occurred between Dr. Page and two sanctioned \nRussian individuals according to a “well-placed Western Intelligence source.” Yet the FBI did not \nask Steele if he was the source referenced in this article.  Instead, the FBI cited the Yahoo! News \narticle in the warrant application as independent corroboration of the allegations in the Steele \nreports. \n65.  Furthermore, on September 25, 2016, Dr. Page sent Defendant Comey a letter \ndenying communications with any sanctioned Russian officials.  Dr. Page stated in the letter that \nhe had a decades’ long record of interactions with the CIA and FBI.  This was consistent with the \nprior CIA reports provided to the FBI involving Dr. Page, which established that he had such a \nrecord. Comey received this letter and distributed it to the Crossfire Hurricane team, including its \nsupervisor Peter Strzok.   \n66.  In addition, CHS Steele was also found to be offering his “Dossier” to the State \nDepartment, conduct that was against FBI protocol, which required Steele to deal with his FBI \nHandling Agent solely.  \n67.  Kathleen Kavalec, then the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, met with Steele on \nOctober 11, 2016, and forwarded her notes of the meeting to the FBI. During the meeting, Steele \nadmitted he was encouraged by his client to get his research out before the 2016 election, signaling \na political motivation. Kavalec’s notes also show she found flaws with Steele’s allegations and \ncast doubt on his credibility. \n68.  On or about September 29, 2016, FBI agent Stephen Somma provided “incomplete, \ninaccurate, and in certain respects contrary [information] to the information the [CIA] provided to \n18 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 19 of 59\n \nthe Crossfire Hurricane team” when an DOJ Office of Intelligence (OI) attorney asked whether \nDr.  Page had been a “source” for the CIA.  The FBI then knew that Dr. Page had been a CIA \n“operational contact” from 2008-2013, which was the time period relevant to the Crossfire \nHurricane investigation and the FISA Warrants. \n69.  Other witness interviews conducted by the FBI were wholly inconsistent with the \nallegations against Dr. Page in the two documents Steele provided, but the FBI purposefully \nwithheld this information from the DOJ. \n70.  In monitored communications between Dr. Page and another CHS (Stefan Halper), \nDr. Page repeatedly denied that he had any involvement with Russia on behalf of the Trump \ncampaign before, during, and after his affiliation with the Trump campaign. This relevant and \nexculpatory information was never disclosed by the FBI to DOJ attorneys. \n71.  Similarly,  statements  made  by  George  Papadopoulos  in  FBI-monitored \nconversations with a CHS that took place in September and October 2016, denied that anyone \ninvolved in the Trump Campaign was coordinating with Russia.  This exculpatory information \nwas not disclosed in the First FISA Warrant application. \n72.  According to a document circulated among FBI Crossfire Hurricane team members \nand supervisors in early October 2016, Igor Danchenko – CHS Steele’s Primary Sub-Source for \nthe allegations against Dr. Page -- had historical contact with persons and entities suspected of \nbeing linked to Russian Intelligence. Yet the FBI did not follow up by interviewing Danchenko \nbefore proceeding to seek the First FISA Warrant against Dr. Page. Nor did the FBI disclose its \nfailure to verify the information provided by Steele in its application for the First FISA Warrant in \nOctober 2016. \n19 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 20 of 59\n \n73.  On October 7, 2016, DOJ attorney Stuart Evans asked the FBI whether Steele was \naffiliated with a political campaign.  On October 10, 2016, FBI agent Stephen Somma provided \nan answer that was only partially responsive.  On October 11, Evans learned that Steele had been \nperforming political opposition research and expressed concerns about Steele’s reliability due to \nhis political bias and its impact on information provided to the FBI.  On October 12, Peter Strzok \nand other FBI personnel briefed Comey and McCabe about Evans’ concerns.  The FBI brushed \naside those concerns and pressed the DOJ to proceed with the warrant application. \n74.  DOJ then held up the warrant application because of concerns that Steele’s bias \nmay need to be disclosed to the FISC.  Ultimately a footnote was added to the application which \nstated that: \nSource #1 [Steele], who now owns a foreign business/financial \nintelligence  firm,  was  approached  by  an  identified  U.S.  person,  who \nindicated to Source #1 that a U.S.-based law firm had hired the identified \nU.S. person to conduct research regarding Candidate #1’s ties to Russia (the \nidentified  U.S.  person  and  Source  #1  have  a  long-standing  business \nrelationship). The identified U.S. person hired Source #1 to conduct this \nresearch. The identified U.S. person never advised Source #1 as to the \nmotivation behind the research into Candidate #1’s ties to Russia. The FBI \nspeculates that the identified U.S. person was likely looking for information \nthat could be used to discredit Candidate #1's campaign. \n \n75.  This  misleading  footnote  ignores  the  fact  that  Steele  was  being  paid  with \nDemocratic National Committee funds, which its law firm, Perkins Coie, funneled to CHS Steele \nthrough the political opposition research firm Fusion GPS.  The FBI knew that fully and accurately \ndisclosing the motivations behind Steele’s critical allegations on which it was relying would \nundermine any finding of probable cause and would prevent it from obtaining a warrant. \n76.  The First FISA Warrant application was submitted to the FISC on October 21, \n2016.  It asserted that “the FBI has learned that Page met with at least two Russian officials during \n[a trip to Russia in July 2016],” relying on CHS Steele’s allegations.  But it did not fully disclose \n20 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 21 of 59\n \nSteele’s bias and motives.  Nor did it disclose the information provided by the CIA to the FBI, \neither that Dr. Page had been an operational contact for many years, or the cautionary warning \nabout politically motivated false reports alleging connections between Russian individuals and \nU.S. citizens.   \n77.  Neither the First FISA Warrant application nor any of the subsequent renewal \napplications disclosed or referenced any role that the Democratic National Committee or any \nparty/campaign had in funding the efforts by Steele, even though those efforts were known to \nsenior DOJ and FBI officials. \n78.   The application for the First FISA Warrant also falsely represented that “The FBI \nhas reviewed this verified application for accuracy in accordance with its April 5, 2001 procedures \n[the Woods Procedures], which include sending a copy of the draft to the appropriate field \noffice(s).”   \n79.  There was insufficient evidence to support issuance of a warrant against Dr. Page \nwhen the application for the First FISA Warrant was submitted to the FISC. \n80.  The application for the First FISA warrant was false and misleading. \n81.  If the application for the First FISA warrant had not been false and misleading, the \nwarrant would not have been issued by the FISC.       \nB.  The Second FISA Warrant \n82.  On October 31, 2016, an article appeared in Mother Jones titled “A Veteran Spy \nHas Given the FBI Information Alleging a Russian Operation to Cultivate Donald Trump.” The \nsub-headline asked, “Has the bureau investigated this material?”  FBI Agent Michael Gaeta, who \nwas the assigned “handler” for CHS Steele, was convinced Steele was the source for the article \nand confronted him about it. Steele admitted he was behind the Mother Jones story.  \n21 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 22 of 59\n \n83.  Agent Gaeta’s reaction to CHS Steele’s behavior was surprise and disbelief. Gaeta \nthought that Steele’s actions and attitude were not just “crazy source-related stuff,” but “one of the \ncraziest” he had seen in two decades of handling sources.   \n84.  On or about November 1, 2016, Agent Gaeta advised Steele that he must cease \ncollecting information for the FBI, and it was unlikely that the FBI would continue a relationship \nwith him because of this serious violation of the CHS protocols.   \n85.  Agent Gaeta reported Steele’s misbehavior to FBI supervisors, including William \nPriestap, and on November 17, 2016, the FBI officially closed Steele as a source for cause. \n86.  In November 2016, Priestap and Peter Strzok went to London to assess Steele’s \ncredibility by gathering the opinions of persons who previously had professional contacts with \nSteele. They found some who described Steele as “smart” and a “person of integrity.” But several \nlamented Steele’s “poor judgment” or “lack of judgment” and his habit of “pursuing people [with] \npolitical risk but no intel value.”   \n87.  On November 21, 2016, DOJ official Bruce Ohr met with Lisa Page, Peter Strzok, \nJoe Pientka, and other FBI officials to discuss “Steele’s background and reliability as a source and \nto identify his source network.”  Ohr advised them that Steele “was desperate that Donald Trump \nnot get elected and was passionate about him not becoming the U.S. president.”  He also said that \nSteele had been hired by “a lawyer who does opposition research” and the information about \nTrump and Russia was being relayed to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. \n88.  Thereafter,  Ohr  communicated  with  the  FBI  on  13  separate  occasions  in  a \nsuccessful  effort  to  provide  information  he  received  from  former  CHS  Steele,  as  well  as \ninformation received from Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS, and also a thumb drive of opposition \nresearch created by Ohr’s wife, who was a Fusion GPS employee. In essence, Ohr became a go-\n22 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 23 of 59\n \nbetween by which the FBI maintained ongoing contact with former CHS Steele and continued to \nrely on his allegations notwithstanding that Steele had been fired and supposedly terminated as a \nsource of reliable information. \n89.  Another back-channel by which the FBI continued to gather new “reporting” by \nSteele was David Corn, the Mother Jones reporter who had written the article about Steele’s \naccusations. Corn was a longtime friend of then-FBI General Counsel James Baker.  Corn gave \nSteele memos to Baker and then Baker passed them on to Priestap.  \n90.  An FBI liaison informed the Crossfire Hurricane team (at a minimum Agents Joe \nPientka and Stephen Somma) in late November 2016 that Deputy Assistant Secretary of State \nKavalec had met with Steele, she had taken notes of their meeting, the liaison could obtain \ninformation from Kavalec about the meeting, and, according to Kavalec, the information from \nSteele's reporting about a Russian consulate being located in Miami was inaccurate. But the FBI \nliaison received no directives from the Crossfire Hurricane team to gather information from \nKavalec regarding her contact with Steele. The FBI did continue to receive information from \nSteele even though he had been terminated as a CHS source - for cause. \n91.  In December 2016, the FBI learned that Steele’s primary sub-source was “Igor \nDanchenko,” who had been the subject of an investigation by the FBI in 2009-2010 as a “National \nSecurity Threat” and possible Russian spy.  In 2010 the FBI had initiated a request for FISA \nsurveillance of Danchenko but withdrew the request after Danchenko left the United States.  The \nFBI was to consider reopening the investigation if Danchenko ever returned to the United States.  \nIn addition, in late December 2016, Mr. Ohr told the FBI that he had met with Glenn Simpson of \nFusion GPS and that Simpson had assessed that Igor Danchenko was a Russian intelligence officer \nwho was central in connecting Trump to Russia.  \n23 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 24 of 59\n \n92.  The application for the Second FISA Warrant was submitted to the FISC on January \n12, 2017.  It asserted that its relationship with Steele had been “suspended” (not terminated) \nbecause of his unauthorized disclosure of information to the press.  Nonetheless, the FBI assessed \nthat Steele’s information was still reliable because previous information he had reported to the FBI \nhad been verified and used in criminal proceedings.  This was not true. \n93.  The  FBI  also  failed  to  include  relevant  information  provided  to  the  FBI  in \nNovember and December 2016 related to Steele's motivations and reliability, which undermined \nhis credibility and the trustworthiness of the information he provided. \n94.  Nor did the application disclose the evidence that Danchenko, the ultimate source \nof the allegations against Dr. Page, might well be a Russian intelligence officer. \n95.   Notably, the application did not outline any foreign intelligence information that \nhad been gathered during the first three months.  Instead, the application contained the misleading \nconclusory statement that the requested warrant would “continue to produce foreign intelligence \ninformation.”  \n96.  On information and belief, the initial three months of FISA surveillance of Dr. Page \nhad produced no foreign intelligence information and revealed no evidence at all of Dr. Page acting \nas a foreign agent of Russia.   \n97.  There was insufficient evidence to support issuance of a warrant against Dr. Page \nwhen the application for the Second FISA Warrant was submitted to the FISC. \n98.  The application for the Second FISA Warrant was false and misleading. \n99.  If the application for the Second for the FISA Warrant had not been false and \nmisleading, the warrant would not have been issued by the FISC. \n24 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 25 of 59\n \nC.  The Third FISA Warrant \n100.  The Department of Justice has conceded to the FISC that there was insufficient \nevidence to support a finding of probable cause when it sought the Third FISA Warrant. \n101.  The FBI interviewed Igor Danchenko over the course of three days, from January \n24-26, 2017.  Danchenko gave the FBI information that contradicted or undermined the allegations \nabout  Dr. Page that Steele attributed to  him. He said  Steele’s reporting was “misstated or \nexaggerated,” and some of Danchenko’s information was based on “rumor and speculation”; \nDanchenko “never expected Steele to put [Danchenko’s] statements in reports or present them as \nfacts”; Danchenko “made it clear to Steele that he/she had no proof to support the statements from \n[his] sub-sources and that ‘it was just talk’”; Danchenko’s information was “word of mouth and \nhearsay”; “conversations that [he] had with friends over beers”; statements made in ‘”jest.”  \n102.  These inconsistencies were not disclosed to the FISC in the application for the Third \nFISA Warrant.  Rather, the application stated that Danchenko had been interviewed and found to \nbe “truthful and cooperative.”  This was deliberately misleading because it invoked Danchenko’s \napparent credibility to buttress the allegations attributed to him in the two previous applications \nwhen, in fact, the information he provided undercut those allegations. \n103.  In March 2017, two FBI agents conducted an “ambush interview” of Dr. Page, who \nspoke freely with them, without the benefit of counsel.  These two agents subsequently interviewed \nDr. Page four additional times during March 2017. These interviews lasted a total of approximately \nten hours. Dr. Page was candid and cooperative with the agents, and his answers undermined any \ncontention that he was acting as an agent of a foreign power. An attorney advising Dr. Page then \nspoke to FBI attorney (and now defendant) Kevin Clinesmith about the FBI’s interest in Dr. Page. \nClinesmith was (unbeknownst to Dr. Page) assigned to provide support to FBI personnel working \n25 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 26 of 59\n \non Crossfire Hurricane. One topic they discussed was Evgeny Buryakov, a Russian spy who had \nposed as a New York banker. Dr. Page had cooperated with the FBI’s investigation of Buryakov, \nwho was convicted and sentenced to prison. Buryakov had just completed his sentence and was \nabout to be deported to Russia. Further, Dr. Page’s role as an FBI informant against the Russians \nin that case had recently been publicly revealed which meant that Dr. Page was certain to be \ncontacted by the media for comment. Media reports of Dr. Page’s comments would highlight that \nDr. Page was a loyal American and not a Russian agent.  Clinesmith told Dr. Page’s attorney that \nhe would prefer Dr. Page not comment or else hold off comment. Several days later, on April 7, \n2017, the application for the Third FISA Warrant was submitted.  \n104.  The FBI again asserted that the requested warrant would “continue to produce \nforeign intelligence information” although the prior six months of FISA surveillance of Dr. Page \nhad  revealed no evidence at all of Dr. Page acting as a foreign agent of Russia.   \n105.  There was insufficient evidence to support issuance of a warrant against Dr. Page \nwhen the application for the Third FISA Warrant was submitted to the FISC. \n106.  The application for the Third FISA Warrant was false and misleading. \n107.  If the application for the Third FISA Warrant had not been false and misleading, \nthe warrant would not have been issued by the FISC. \nD.  The Fourth FISA Warrant  \n108.  The Department of Justice has conceded to the FISC that there was insufficient \nevidence to support a finding of probable cause when it sought the Fourth FISA Warrant.  \n109.  The previous three FISA Warrant applications had concealed the fact that Dr. Page \nhad been a CIA “operational contact.”   \n26 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 27 of 59\n \n110.  Prior to the submission of the application for the Fourth FISA Warrant, Dr. Page \nhad publicly stated that he had assisted the U.S. government in the past. During the preparation of \nthe application, an FBI Supervisory Special Agent (“SSA”) who would be the affiant for the \napplication, asked Clinesmith to inquire of the CIA whether Dr. Page had ever been a source \n(operational contact) for the CIA. \n111.  Clinesmith knew that if Dr. Page had been a source for the CIA, that information \nmust be disclosed to the FISC.  However, disclosing this exculpatory fact now would expose the \nmaterial omission of this same information from the prior three FISA Warrants. On June 15, 2017, \nClinesmith sent a disingenuous email to a CIA liaison inquiring whether Dr. Page had ever been a \nsource for the CIA, and the CIA liaison responded by email that Dr. Page had been a CIA source. \nThe  CIA  liaison  directed  Clinesmith’s  attention  to  the  August  17,  2016  memorandum  and \nsupporting materials that CIA had previously provided to the FBI. \n112.  On June 19, 2017, in response to further inquiry from the SSA who was designated \nto sign the Fourth FISA Warrant on behalf of the FBI, Clinesmith falsely advised the SSA that Dr. \nPage had been a “sub source” but was “never a source” for the CIA.  The SSA asked whether the \nFBI had this representation in writing and Clinesmith falsely stated that it did and that he would \nforward the document to the SSA. To conceal the exculpatory fact that Dr. Page had been a CIA \nsource, and the omission of that fact from the prior three FISA Warrant applications, Clinesmith \naltered the email from the CIA liaison to falsely state that Dr. Page was “not a source” for the CIA.   \n113.  In reliance on the email altered by Clinesmith, the SSA designated to sign the \nFourth FISA Warrant application did so.  \n114.  On June 29, 2017, the application for the Fourth FISA Warrant was submitted to \nthe FISC.  \n27 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 28 of 59\n \n115.  The application for the Fourth FISA Warrant, like the three preceding applications, \ndid not advise the FISC that Dr. Page had been an operational contact for the CIA, although the \nFBI Crossfire Hurricane team had this information in its possession since August 2016. \n116.  The application for the Fourth FISA Warrant again stated that Steele’s primary sub-\nsource, Danchenko, had been interviewed and found to be “truthful and cooperative.”  This was \ndeliberately misleading  because it invoked Danchenko’s  apparent  credibility  to  buttress  the \nallegations attributed to him in the three previous applications when, in fact, the information he \nprovided undercut those allegations. \n117.  The FBI again asserted that the requested warrant would “continue to produce \nforeign intelligence information” although the prior nine months of FISA surveillance of Dr. Page \nhad  revealed no evidence at all of Dr. Page acting as a foreign agent of Russia.   \n118.  There was insufficient evidence to support issuance of a warrant against Dr. Page \nwhen the application for the Fourth FISA Warrant was submitted to the FISC. \n119.  The application for the Fourth FISA Warrant was false and misleading. \n120.  If the application for the Fourth FISA Warrant had not been false and misleading, \nthe warrant would not have been issued by the FISC. \n121.  Having unlawfully obtained the four warrants to surveil Dr. Page, the individual \nDefendants and other FBI personnel, both known and unknown to Dr. Page, used the warrants to \nengage in surveillance of him in the manner and for the time periods prescribed in the four \nwarrants.  \n122.  Pursuant to each of the FISA warrants and all of them collectively, Defendants, \nknown and unknown to Dr. Page, obtained Dr. Page’s electronic communications, both written \nand oral, in the manner and for the time periods prescribed in the four warrants. \n28 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 29 of 59\n \n123.  Having obtained communications pursuant to each of the four FISA Warrants, the \nDefendants, both known and unknown, thereafter used and disclosed those communications, to \namong other things, obtain the subsequent FISA Warrants, unlawfully pursue investigative ends, \nand for unlawful leaks to the media and others. \n \nVI.  INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ ACTIONS, OMISSIONS AND \nMISREPRESENTATIONS \n \nA.  James Comey \n124.  On or about August 17, 2016, FBI Director Comey received information from the \nCIA establishing that Dr. Page was an “operational contact” for the CIA during the period of 2008-\n2013.  This information was consistent with the FBI’s records from briefing Dr. Page about his \nreporting to the CIA on an ongoing basis.  \n125.  On or about September 7, 2016, a senior CIA official forwarded an investigative \nreferral to Comey and Peter Strzok about a potential plan to divert attention from presidential \ncandidate Hillary Clinton’s alleged mis-use of a private email server when she was Secretary of \nState by alleging the existence of collaboration between the Trump campaign and Russian hackers \nto interfere in the election.  \n126.  Dr. Page subsequently wrote to Comey on September 25, 2016 denying that he \nparticipated in any collaboration with Russians on behalf of the Trump campaign. He also referred \nto his long-term interactions with the CIA and FBI.  \n127.  Dr. Page’s letter to Comey was received and shared with the Crossfire Hurricane \nteam. “At a minimum, the letter provides us a pretext to interview,” Peter Strzok wrote to Lisa \nPage on Sept. 26, 2016.  \n29 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 30 of 59\n \n128.  Comey approved the FBI’s monitoring and surveillance of Dr. Page by CHS Stefan \nHalper and, on information and belief, was advised about the results of the conversation in which \nDr. Page refuted the allegations that he was an agent of Russia. \n129.  Despite the foregoing, the FBI did not interview Dr. Page before applying for the \nFirst FISA Warrant. And the application did not advise the FISC that Dr. Page had been a source \nfor the CIA.   \n130.  Nonetheless, Comey signed the first three FISA Warrant applications to surveil Dr. \nPage. Comey signed the application for the First FISA Warrant that was submitted to the FISC on \nOctober 21, 2016. He signed the application for the Second FISA Warrant that was submitted on \nJanuary 12, 2017.  In that same month, Comey described the information from CHS Steele —\nwhich was relied on by the FBI for the ‘probable cause” required in order to obtain the FISA \nWarrants—as “unverified” in a conversation with President Trump.  On or about April 7, 2017, \nComey signed the application for  the Third FISA Warrant. Comey’s endorsement of these \napplications falsely assured the FISC that the Woods Procedures had been followed. \nB.  Andrew McCabe \n131.  McCabe served as the deputy director of the FBI under Comey and was involved \nin decisions to surveil Dr. Page from early in the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.  \n132.  In August 2016, then-Associate Attorney General Bruce Ohr briefed McCabe about \nSteele’s accusations regarding Dr. Page. On or about August 25, 2016, McCabe directed a \nsupervisor working on the Crossfire Hurricane investigation to contact the FBI New York Field \nOffice for information that could assist the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. At that time, agents \nin the New York Field Office had possession of Steele’s reports. \n30 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 31 of 59\n \n133.  On information and belief, McCabe approved the Crossfire Hurricane team’s use \nof Steele in the investigation. McCabe ignored warnings that more information about Steele’s \nmotives was needed before relying on his allegations. Specifically, DOJ Principal Deputy Attorney \nGeneral Mary McCord told McCabe during a phone call that the FISA application needed more \ninformation about who hired Steele.  \n134.  On October 11, 2016, Strzok messaged Lisa Page that the FISA application to \nsurveil Dr. Page could not gain approval at DOJ without a call from McCabe.  \n135.  On October 12, 2016, Strzok and others briefed McCabe and Comey about the \nconcerns of DOJ attorney Stuart Evans had about Steele.  Evans wanted more scrutiny of Steele’s \nmotives, and believed that before pursuing a surveillance warrant against someone associated with \na presidential campaign, leadership of both the FBI and DOJ should explicitly sign off on the \nrequest.  McCabe and Comey were “supportive” and approved moving forward with the FISA \nwarrant application without further scrutiny of CHS Steele, from whom the FBI’s “probable cause” \ninformation was received.   \n136.  McCabe approved the application for the Second FISA Warrant, including the \nassertion that the three-month surveillance of Dr. Page, pursuant to the First FISA Warrant, had \nbeen “very productive” although the surveillance had yielded no evidence of any coordination \nbetween Dr. Page and Russian officials.  \n137.  McCabe signed the application for the Fourth FISA Warrant. \nC.  Peter Strzok \n138.  Peter Strzok was the FBI Deputy Assistant Director for Counterintelligence and \nperformed a supervisory role for the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.   \n31 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 32 of 59\n \n139.  Strzok was aware that, in August 2016, the CIA had confirmed that Carter Page \nwas an “operational contact” for that agency.    \n140.  Strzok was a recipient of the September 7, 2016, investigation referral from the CIA \nregarding \"U.S. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's approval of a plan concerning U.S. \nPresidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian hackers hampering U.S. elections as a means \nof distracting the public from her use of a private mail server.\" \n141.  In October 2016, as the FBI Crossfire Hurricane team was attempting to complete \nthe application for the First FISA Warrant, DOJ attorney Stuart Evans expressed reluctance to \nproceed with the application.  Evans wanted more scrutiny of Steele’s motives, and believed that \nbefore pursuing a surveillance warrant against someone associated with a presidential campaign, \nleadership of both the FBI and DOJ should sign off on the request.  In messages to Lisa Page, he \nsaid, “Currently fighting with Stu for this fisa” and “Hey-The FISA will probably not go forward \nwithout a call from [McCabe].” \n142.  Strzok and the FBI Crossfire Hurricane team assumed the Hillary Clinton campaign \nor the Democratic Party was paying for Steele’s research.  \n143.  On October 12, 2016, Strzok briefed McCabe and Comey about Evans’ concerns \nand pushed to proceed with the application without further scrutiny of Steele. \n144.  Strzok made typewritten annotations to/comments on a February 14, 2017 New \nYork  Times  article  about  alleged  Russian  intelligence  ties  to  the  Trump  campaign.  These \ncomments show that Strzok and others in the FBI were well aware of the issues with the Steele \nreports that had been revealed by the FBI’s January 2017 interview with Steele’s primary sub-\nsource, Igor Danchenko.  Strzok commented that “[r]ecent interviews and investigation, however, \nreveal Steele may not be in a position to judge the reliability of his sub-source network.”  \n32 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 33 of 59\n \n145.  The document further shows that the FBI’s assertion to the FISC that “the FBI \nbelieves that Russia’s efforts to influence U.S. policy were likely being coordinated between the \nRIS  [Russian  Intelligence  Services]  and  Page,  and  possibly  others”  was  a  knowing \nmisrepresentation. This is evident from comments on the Times article made by Strzok in which \nhe asserted that “[w]e have not seen evidence of any individuals affiliated with the Trump team in \ncontact with IOs [Intelligence Officials] . . . We are unaware of ANY Trump advisors engaging in \nconversations with Russian intelligence officials. \nD.  Brian Auten \n146.  Brian Auten served as a supervisory intelligence analyst in the FBI. He also worked \nas an adjunct professor and writer on spying ethics.  \n147.  Auten was assigned to the Crossfire Hurricane investigation from its inception in \nJuly 2016 and supervised its analytical efforts throughout 2017. He played a key supportive role \nfor the agents preparing the FISA applications, including reviewing the probable-cause section of \nthe applications and providing the agents with information about Steele’s sub-sources noted in the \napplications. He also helped prepare and review the renewal drafts.   \n148.  Auten assisted the case agents in providing information on the reliability of Steele \nand his sources and reviewing for accuracy their information cited in the body of the applications, \nas well as all the footnotes. His job was also to fill gaps in the FISA applications or bolster weak \nareas.   \n149.  Auten falsely enhanced the credibility of Steele. While most of Steele’s past \nreporting as an informant for the FBI had not been corroborated and had never been used in a \ncriminal proceeding, Auten wrote that it had in fact been \"corroborated and used in criminal \nproceedings.”  \n33 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 34 of 59\n \n150.  Auten failed to disclose to the FISC negative feedback from British Intelligence \nService colleagues of Steele. They told Auten during a visit he made to London in December 2016 \nthat Steele exercised \"poor judgment” and pursued as sources \"people with political risk but no \nintel value.”  \n151.   Auten determined that some of the allegations in Steele’s reports were inaccurate, \nsuch as the allegation that Paul Manafort used Dr. Page as an intermediary. But he did not include \nthis information in any of the applications for the FISA Warrants. \n152.  Auten also identified issues with Steele’s sub-sources. Auten knew of, and met, \nwith Steele’s Primary Sub-source, Igor Danchenko. Auten knew that Danchenko was based in the \nUnited States, yet intentionally mispresented or failed to correct the statement in the applications \nfor the Third and Fourth FISA Warrants that Danchenko was Russia-based. While Auten found \nDanchenko to be truthful and cooperative, he also found that Danchenko contradicted key claims \nin Steele’s reports.  Even though Auten knew Steele was working for the Clinton campaign by \nearly January 2017, he did not seek to include this information in the applications for the Third \nand Fourth FISA Warrants. \nE.  Kevin Clinesmith \n153.  Kevin Clinesmith served with the FBI as Assistant General Counsel in the National \nSecurity  and  Cyber  Law  Branch  of  the  FBI’s  Office  of  General  Counsel.  Clinesmith  was \nresponsible for providing legal support to FBI personnel working on Crossfire Hurricane. He was \none of the FBI personnel who communicated with the CIA with respect to the Crossfire Hurricane \ninvestigation.  \n34 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 35 of 59\n \n154.  Clinesmith also provided support to FBI personnel working with the National \nSecurity Division of the DOJ to prepare FISA applications to obtain authority from the FISC to \nconduct surveillance on Dr. Page.  \n155.  On June 15, 2017, Clinesmith sent an email to a CIA liaison inquiring whether Dr. \nPage was a CIA source in any capacity because the FBI would need to disclose that on the next \nFISA application.  \n156.  The CIA liaison responded the same day and included a list of documents that the \nCIA previously provided to members of the Crossfire Hurricane team that provided the answer \nand also confirmed that Dr. Page “was or is” a source for the CIA. Clinesmith acknowledged the \nemail, stated he was examining the documents, and thanked the CIA liaison for the information.  \n157.  The FBI SSA who would be the affiant for the application for the Fourth FISA \nWarrant  followed  up  with  Clinesmith  a  few  days  later  and  asked  whether  Clinesmith  had \nconfirmed if Dr. Page was a CIA source. During a series of instant messages, Clinesmith reported \nthat Dr. Page was a “sub-source” and “was never a source.” Clinesmith further stated that the CIA \nconfirmed  explicitly  that  Dr.  Page  was  never  a  source.  The  SSA  asked  if  they  had  that \nrepresentation in writing and Clinesmith agreed to forward the email from the CIA liaison.  \n158.  On June 19, 2017, after this instant message exchange, Clinesmith forwarded an \naltered version of the CIA liaison’s email to the SSA. Clinesmith altered the original text of the \nemail to read that Dr. Page was “not a ‘source.’” \n159.  Clinesmith had expressed dismay at the prospect of having to write a “terrible \nfootnote” apprising the FISC that such a salient fact – that Dr. Page had been a source for the CIA \n-- was only at this late date being brought to the Court’s attention.   \n35 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 36 of 59\n \n160.  Consequently, information about Dr. Page’s history or status as a CIA operational \ncontact was not included in the application for the Fourth FISA Warrant.  Clinesmith was \nsubsequently criminally charged on August 14, 2020, with one count of making false statements \nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(3) for his actions in misleading the SSA and altering the email \nregarding Dr. Page’s status as an operational contact of the CIA.  \nF.  Lisa Page \n161.  Lisa  Page  was  an  FBI  attorney  and  was  Special  Counsel  to  Andrew \nMcCabe.  She facilitated the leaks of information about the FBI’s FISA warrants regarding Dr. \nPage.  \nG.  Joe Pientka III \n162.  Joe Pientka served as an FBI supervisory special agent on Crossfire Hurricane. He \nsigned an authorization to  submit the application for the First  FISA  Warrant.  Pientka was \nresponsible for compliance with the Woods Procedures by confirming the completion of the \nWoods File for the warrant application, and for double checking the factual accuracy review to \nconfirm that the file contained appropriate documentation for each of the factual assertions in the \nFISA  application.  Contrary  to  Pientka’s  representation,  the  Woods  File  was  inaccurate, \nincomplete, or unsupported by appropriate documentation. \n163.  Among other things, Pientka failed to verify and correct the false statement in the \napplication for the First FISA Warrant that Steele’s reporting had been corroborated and used in \ncriminal proceedings. Pientka also disregarded a requirement in the Woods Procedure to confirm \nthat Steele’s Handling Agent, Michael Gaeta, had reviewed and approved the content in the \napplication for the First FISA Warrant.  \n36 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 37 of 59\n \nH.  Stephen Somma \n164.  Stephen Somma was an FBI counterintelligence investigator in the New York Field \nOffice and was referred to as “Case Agent 1” in the Horowitz Report. He was one of the original \nteam members of Crossfire Hurricane who had primary responsibility over the investigation of Dr. \nPage.  \n165.  He opened the case file on Page, and he first proposed surveillance on Page.  In \napproximately August 2016, Somma contacted FBI's Office of the General Counsel (OGC) about \nthe possibility of seeking FISA authority targeting Dr. Page to conduct electronic surveillance. \n166.  On August 15, 2016, the FBI’s OGC told Somma that he needed more to establish \nprobable cause for a FISA warrant targeting Dr. Page.  Thereafter, Somma seized on the allegations \nabout Dr. Page provided by CHS Steele as a basis to obtain a FISA Warrant. Somma was also the \nFBI handler for Stefan Halper, a longtime confidential human source who was tasked with meeting \nPage and other associates of the Trump campaign. He failed to disclose exculpatory statements \nthat both Page and George Papadopoulos made to Halper during secretly recorded conversations \nbefore the 2016 election. Page told Halper that he had no communications with Paul Manafort and \ndenied the alleged meetings with Sechin and Divyekin (the two sanctioned Russians with close \nties to Russian President Vladimir Putin).   \n167.  Somma also received information from the CIA in August 2016 that Page had a \nlongstanding  relationship  with  that  agency.  He  did  not  fully  and  accurately  divulge  that \ninformation to others at the FBI. \n168.  When Somma was explicitly asked in late September 2016 by a DOJ attorney \nassisting on the FISA application about Page's prior relationship with the CIA, Somma did not \naccurately describe the nature and extent of the information the FBI received from the CIA. Somma \n37 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 38 of 59\n \nadvised  the  attorney  that  Dr.  Page  did  meet  with  a  U.S.  government  agency,  but  that  the \ninteractions took place while Dr. Page was in Moscow (which was between 2004 and 2007) and \nwere \"outside scope.\" Based upon this response, the attorney did not include information about \nDr. Page's prior interactions with the CIA in the application for the First FISA Warrant.  \n169.  In seeking the First FISA Warrant, Somma mischaracterized the extent to which \nthe FBI had previously relied on CHS Steele’s prior reporting.  This resulted from his failure to \nseek review and approval from Steele’s handling agent, as the Woods Procedures required. \n170.  Somma also sought to hide from DOJ attorneys the political bias that made Steele’s \nreports about Dr. Page suspect.  Stuart Evans asked whether Steele \"is affiliated with either \ncampaign and/or has contributed to either campaign.\" On October 7, 2016, the DOJ Unit Chief \nthis  question  was  emailed  to  the  Crossfire  Hurricane  team.  On  October  10,  2016,  Somma \nresponded but addressed only the second part of the question, stating that Steele was most likely a \nforeign national and therefore unable to contribute to either campaign. Because he did not fully \naddress the question, the Unit Chief asked him again, on October 11, 2016, whether Steele was \naffiliated with and/or had contributed to either presidential campaign. Again, Somma answered \nonly the second part of the question, confirming that Steele had not contributed to any campaign \nand was not a U.S. person. Evans was frustrated and annoyed by this answer and asked the question \na third time.  At that point, the FBI finally responded that they assumed Steele had been paid to \ndevelop political opposition research.  \n171.  Somma’s handwritten notes from a December 2016 team meeting reflect that the \nCrossfire Hurricane team was told that Steele \"may have some judgment problems,” but this \ninformation was never disclosed in subsequent applications to renew the FISA Warrant. \n38 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 39 of 59\n \n172.  Somma participated in the FBI’s January 2017 interview of Igor Danchenko, the \nPrimary Sub-Source in the Steele reports for the allegations about Dr. Page. During this interview, \nDanchenko gave the FBI information that contradicted assertions made in the initial application \nfor the FISA Warrant. But Somma withheld this development from the FISC in the applications \nfor the Third and Fourth FISA Warrants. \n173.  In March 2017, Somma and another FBI agent conducted an “ambush interview” \nof Dr. Page.  Dr. Page spoke freely to them, without the benefit of counsel. Somma and the second \nagent  subsequently  interviewed  Dr.  Page  four  additional  times  during  March  2017.  These \ninterviews lasted a total of approximately ten hours. Dr. Page was completely honest with the \nagents, and his answers undermined any contention that he was acting as an agent of a foreign \npower.  \nVII.  CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS \n174.  After  the  FISA  abuse  targeting  Dr.  Page  was  exposed,  there  were  various \nCongressional investigations. Defendants Comey, McCabe, and others were questioned under oath \nduring those investigations and made significant admission that the FISA Warrant application \nprocess - which they conducted – was flawed, while nevertheless trying to avoid responsibility for \nit. \n175.  On September 30, 2020, Comey testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee \nHearing on the Oversight of the Crossfire Hurricane Investigation, as follows:  \nSenator Graham:  \nOne last question to you, Director Comey, and I’ll turn it over to Senator Lee. \nKnowing then what you know now about all the things that we’ve come to find, \nwould you have still signed the warrant application against Carter Page in October, \nJanuary, and April? \n \n \n39 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 40 of 59\n \nComey:  \nNo. I would want a much more complete understanding of what we- \n.  .  . \nComey:  \nMy answer was no, not without a much fuller discussion of how they were \nthinking about their disclosure obligations to the court. \n \n176.  On November 10, 2020, McCabe testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Hearing \non the Oversight of the Crossfire Hurricane Investigation, and in his opening statement testified: \n“To me, any material misrepresentation or error in a FISA application is \nunacceptable. Period. The FBI should be held to the standard of scrupulous \naccuracy that the court demands. FISA remains one of the most important \ntools in our country’s efforts to protect national security.” \n \n \n177.  Senator Graham questioned McCabe about the FISA warrants: \nSenator Graham: \nIf you knew then  what you know now, would you have signed the  warrant \napplication in June of 2017 against Carter Page? \n \n \nMcCabe:   \nNo, sir. \n \n178.  Senator Graham further questioned McCabe:  \nSenator Graham: \nOkay. Finally, who is responsible for ruining Mr. Carter Page’s life? If it’s not \nyou, if not Rosenstein, if it’s not Comey, if it’s not Sally Yates, who’s responsible \nfor putting together the information provided to the FISA court that was \ncompletely devoid of the truth, lacking material facts, completely misrepresented \nwhat Mr. Page did and how he did it, who we look to for that responsibility? \n40 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 41 of 59\n \nMcCabe:  \nWell, sir, I don’t agree with the way that you’ve characterized the entirety of the- \nSenator Graham:  \nThat’s what the court said. \nMcCabe:  \nI think as the IG pointed out in the conclusions of their report, that- \nSenator Graham:  \nWho’s responsible, Mr. McCabe? \nMcCabe:  \nEveryone who … Every person who played a role- \n.  .  .  \nSenator Graham:  \nOkay. The question is who’s responsible? \nMcCabe:  \nAnd I think that we are all responsible for the work that went into that FISA. I am \ncertainly responsible as a person in a leadership position with oversight over these \nmatters. I accept that responsibility fully. I cannot- \n \nSenator Graham:  \nDid you mislead the FISA court? \nMcCabe:  \nI signed a package that included numerous factual errors or failed to include \ninformation that should have been brought to the court. \n   \n41 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 42 of 59\n \n179.  Senator Cornyn also questioned McCabe \nSenator Cornyn: \nMr. McCabe, who should be held accountable for the submission of a foreign \nintelligence surveillance act application that contained a lie about Carter Page \nwith regard to his activities on behalf of another agency of the federal \ngovernment? And who should be held accountable for relying on the now \ndiscredited Steele dossier? I think that’s the question people would like an answer \nto. Who should be held accountable? \n \nMcCabe:  \nSenator, I think all of the people involved in this work should be and have been \nheld accountable. I feel like the oversight process that we’re engaged in now, the \nparticipation and cooperation and the efforts of the inspector general, I think all of \nthese elements of the work that the FBI has done internally to address everything \nfrom individuals to processes involved, I think those are all essential steps to \nensure that these errors are fixed and that we take appropriate steps not to make \nthem in the future. \n \n \n180.  Senator Kennedy also questioned McCabe \nSenator Kennedy: \nThank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. McCabe, who is responsible for the misbehavior \noutlined by an Inspector General Horowitz in his report about [sic] Misfire \nHurricane? \n \nMcCabe:  \nWell, it depends on what you’re referring to, Senator. If you’re referring to the \nintentional misconduct committed by Mr. Clinesmith, quite obviously, Mr. \nClinesmith’s responsible for that. I think from a command perspective, Director \nComey and myself and our subordinate leaders are all responsible for the failures \nin that package that we allowed to go forward \n.   .   . \n   \n42 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 43 of 59\n \nVIII.  UNLAWFUL  DISCLOSURES  OF  PROTECTED  INFORMATION  AND \nFAILURE TO PERMIT REVIEW AND AMENDMENT OF GOVERNMENT \nRECORDS \n \nA.  Unlawful disclosure of FISA and Privacy Act protected records and \ninformation \n \n181.  Defendants, known and unknown to Dr. Page, unlawfully leaked FISA and Privacy \nAct protected records and information concerning Dr. Page to the media.   \n182.  Defendants,  known  and  unknown  to  Dr.  Page,  possessed  this  information \nconcerning Dr. Page from the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, the FISA Warrant applications, \nand the results of the FISA surveillance. \n183.  On Monday, April 10, 2017, Peter Strzok texted Lisa Page to discuss a “media leak \nstrategy,” stating \"I had literally just gone to find this phone to tell you I want to talk to you about \nmedia leak strategy with DOJ before you go.\"  \n184.  On Tuesday, April 11, 2017, the Washington Post broke the story about the FISA \nWarrants targeting Dr. Page, including that a FISA warrant had been issued in 2016 and had been \nrenewed at least once.  The article included the following statements: \na.  The FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Page’s \ncommunications after convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge \nthat there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign \npower, in this case Russia, according to the officials. \n \nb.  The  counterintelligence  investigation  into  Russian  efforts  to  influence  U.S. \nelections began in July, officials have said. The FBI also began investigating Page \nin July as part of the probe, officials said.   \n \nc.  The government’s application for the surveillance order targeting Page included a \nlengthy declaration that laid out investigators’ basis for believing that Page was an \nagent  of  the  Russian  government  and  knowingly  engaged  in  clandestine \nintelligence activities on behalf of Moscow, officials said. \n \nd.  In July, Page traveled to Moscow, where he delivered a speech harshly critical of \nthe United States’ policy toward Russia. \n \n43 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 44 of 59\n \ne.  While there, Page allegedly met with Igor Sechin, a Putin confidant and chief \nexecutive of the energy company Rosneft, according to a dossier compiled by a \nformer British intelligence officer and cited at a congressional hearing by Rep. \nAdam  B.  Schiff  (Calif.),  the  ranking  Democrat  on  the  House  Intelligence \nCommittee. Officials said some of the information in the dossier has been verified \nby U.S. intelligence agencies, and some of it hasn’t, while other parts are unlikely \nto ever be proved or disproved. \n \nf.  Page is the only American to have had his communications directly targeted with a \nFISA warrant in 2016 as part of the Russia probe, officials said. \n \n185.  On Wednesday, April 12, 2017, Peter Strzok texted Lisa Page to warn her that two \nmedia articles were coming out about her “namesake” Carter Page and one was worse than the \nother. \n186.  On Saturday, April 22, 2017, Peter Strzok sent another text to Lisa Page stating that \nthe “article is out!”  congratulating her on a job well done, saying \"Well done, Page.\" \n187.  That same day the New York Times published a lengthy article entitled “Comey \nTried to Shield the F.B.I. From Politics.  Then He Shaped an Election.”  Much of this article \nfocused on the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails but the article then turned to Dr. Page and \nincluded the following statements: \na.  Days after Mr. Comey’s news conference, Carter Page, an American businessman, \ngave a speech in Moscow criticizing American foreign policy. Such a trip would \ntypically be unremarkable, but Mr. Page had previously been under F.B.I. scrutiny \nyears earlier, as he was believed to have been marked for recruitment by Russian \nspies. And he was now a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trump. \n \nb.  In late July, the F.B.I. opened an investigation into possible collusion between \nmembers of Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russian operatives. Besides Mr. Comey \nand a small team of agents, officials said, only a dozen or so people at the F.B.I. \nknew about the investigation. Mr. Strzok, just days removed from the Clinton case, \nwas selected to supervise it. \n \nc.  In late August, Mr. Comey and his deputies were briefed on a provocative set of \ndocuments about purported dealings between shadowy Russian figures and Mr. \nTrump’s campaign. One report, filled with references to secret meetings, spoke \nominously of Mr. Trump’s “compromising relationship with the Kremlin” and \nthreats of “blackmail.” \n44 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 45 of 59\n \n \nd.  The reports came from a former British intelligence agent named Christopher \nSteele, who was working as a private investigator hired by a firm working for a \nTrump opponent. He provided the documents to an F.B.I. contact in Europe on \nthe same day as Mr. Comey’s news conference about Mrs. Clinton. It took weeks \nfor this information to land with Mr. Strzok and his team. \n \ne.  Mr. Steele had been a covert agent for MI6 in Moscow, maintained deep ties with \nRussians and worked with the F.B.I., but his claims were largely unverified. It \nwas increasingly clear at the F.B.I. that Russia was trying to interfere with the \nelection. \n \n188.  On information and belief, Strzok and Lisa Page collaborated to disclose protected \ninformation regarding Dr. Page to the media and sought and obtained approval to do so from \nMcCabe.  \n189.  On information and belief, Defendants, known and unknown to Dr. Page, but \nincluding but not limited to,  Comey, McCabe, Strzok, and Page, leaked information and records \nconcerning Dr. Page that were protected from disclosure under the FISA and the Privacy Act to \nmedia outlets, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and Yahoo News, among \nothers.  \n190.  The FISA warrant applications targeting Dr. Page identify him by name. The \napplications are retrievable by Dr. Page’s name in DOJ and FBI record systems.  \n191.  On information and belief, the results obtained from the FISA Warrants approving \nsurveillance of Dr. Page identify him by name and are retrievable by Dr. Page’s name in an FBI \nrecords system. \nB.  DOJ OIG Investigation \n \n192.  The DOJ OIG began an investigation into the FBI and DOJ’s handling of the FISA \nWarrants targeting Dr. Page in March 2018. \n193.  The Horowitz Report was released on December 9, 2019. \n45 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 46 of 59\n \n194.  In the Fall of 2019, in advance of its release, the Horowitz Report was provided by \nthe DOJ OIG to various Defendants and others for review and comment. \n195.  Dr. Page was not contacted about or afforded an opportunity for review and \ncomment, however, in advance of the report’s release. \n196.  At  that  time,  it  was  evident  that  the  release  of  the  Horowitz  Report  was \nforthcoming, but no date had been publicly set for its release, and the release could have come at \nany time.  \n197.  On September 13, 2019, IG Horowitz wrote to members of Congress to advise them \nthat his office had nearly concluded its work and would be entering the review and comment phase \nof its investigation. \n198.  Both before and immediately upon publication of IG Horowitz’s letter, Dr. Page \nsent emails to DOJ and DOJ OIG seeking his right to review and amend the forthcoming report \npursuant to the Privacy Act. Dr. Page sent no fewer than two emails in September asserting his \nrights, but received no reply to them. \n199.  Media reports in early October 2019 began to describe the release of the Horowitz \nReport as imminent. \n200.  Thus, on October 10, 2019, Dr. Page requested the right to view and amend the \nHorowitz Report pertaining to the FISA warrants to surveil him, citing his rights to do so under \nthe Privacy Act.  He made these requests by email to the DOJ Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties \nand copied IG Horowitz and Mr. Durham. \n201.  DOJ OIG did not respond to Dr. Page’s requests of October 10, 2019. \n202.  On October 16, 2019, Dr. Page inquired into the status of his requests to view and \namend the Horowitz Report. He made this inquiry by email to the DOJ Office of Privacy and Civil \n46 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 47 of 59\n \nLiberties, and copied IG Horowitz, Mr. Durham, and Peter A. Winn, the Acting Chief Privacy and \nCivil Liberties Officer of the DOJ. \n203.  On October 16, 2019, Mr. Winn replied that they were reviewing Dr. Page’s email \nrequest. This response did not constitute the “prompt” reply to Dr. Page’s request to review and \namend records required by the Privacy Act.  \n204.  On October 21, 2019, Dr. Page wrote a third time to DOJ OIG demanding his right \nto review and amend the Horowitz Report and advising that he would promptly file suit if he was \nnot afforded these rights. He emailed this demand to Mr. Winn and IG Horowitz and copied the \nDOJ Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties.  \n205.  Dr. Page’s repeated demands for his rights to review and amend the Horowitz \nReport constituted exhaustion of his administrative remedies under the Privacy Act and DOJ \nregulations. \n206.  DOJ OIG failed to comply with the Privacy Act and its own regulations regarding \nadministrative remedies in response to Dr. Page’s requests. \n207.  DOJ OIG never complied with its obligations under the Privacy Act or with Dr. \nPage’s rights under the Privacy Act to review and amend information contained in the Horowitz \nReport. \n208.  On October 21, 2019, Dr. Page filed suit against the DOJ in the U.S. District Court \nfor the District of Columbia for violation of his rights under the Privacy Act under docket no. 1:19-\ncv-03149. \n209.  On November 12, 2019, Dr. Page received a letter from Jonathan Malis, General \nCounsel for DOJ OIG, in response to his request to view and amend the Horowitz Report. This \nletter does not address his requests under the Privacy Act, but instead informs Dr. Page that he \n47 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 48 of 59\n \nwould not be contacted for an OIG interview. Dr. Page has had no further communication from \nDOJ regarding his request to view and amend the Horowitz Report.  \n210.  The Horowitz Report contains numerous errors that Dr. Page has a right to have \namended to reflect accurate information. \n211.  On September 11, 2020, Dr. Page filed a stipulation dismissing without prejudice \nthe Privacy Act case, docket no. 1:19-cv-03149, in the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia. \n212.  The Horowitz Report is a record which identifies Dr. Page by name. The report \ncontains many approximately 558 references to Dr. Page and the subject of the report is the \nunlawful surveillance of Dr. Page by Defendants. \n213.  The Horowitz Report is contained in a system of records which is retrievable by \npersonal identifiers and the agency in practice retrieves records from the system this way. \n \nIX.  DAMAGES TO DR. PAGE \n214.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, Dr. Page has suffered the following kinds of \nharm and damages, among others: \na.  Receiving death and kidnapping threats; \nb.  Inability to travel safely and freely, either domestically or internationally; \nc.  Irreparable damage to his reputation; \nd.  Economic losses, (past, present and future) from the destruction of his ability to \ncontinue conducting any kind of business through his own companies, because for \nexample, persons, governments and entities would not contract with him, \nincluding banks and other business entities with whom he had previously worked; \n48 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 49 of 59\n \ne.  Economic losses (past, present and future), from being rendered effectively \nunemployable; \nf.  Economic losses due to previously unnecessary expenses directly caused from \nhaving to relocate and travel and other security measures in response to death and \nkidnapping threats; \ng.  Economic losses due to the otherwise unnecessary expenses of responding to \ngovernment investigations and being involved in litigation, including document \npreparation, costs, expenses, expert fees, and attorneys’ fees, for this and other \ncases, \nh.  Pain and suffering damages – anxiety, stress, etc., for himself, and in response to \nthe effects on close family members of death and kidnapping threats against him. \n \nX.  PENDING ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIM UNDER THE PATRIOT ACT \n215.  Dr. Page also has a claim against the United States under the Patriot Act.  18 USC \n§ 2712.  Dr. Page has submitted that claim to DOJ through the administrative claims process as \nrequired by the Act.  If that claim is denied, Dr. Page will move to amend this Complaint to add \nthat cause of action. \n \n   \n49 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 50 of 59\n \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nFOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT \n(OCTOBER 21, 2016 FISA WARRANT – ORIGINAL) \n(Against All Individual Defendants) \n216.  Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1-\n215 above, as if fully set forth herein.  \n217.  It is a criminal offense to “intentionally . . . (1) engage[ ] in electronic surveillance \nunder color of law except as authorized by” identified statutory provisions, or “(2) disclose[ ] or \nuse[ ] information obtained under color of law by electronic surveillance, knowing or having \nreason to know that the information was obtained through electronic surveillance not authorized\" \nby FISA or another “express statutory authorization.”  50 U.S.C. § 1809(a)(2); 18 U.S.C. § 2.  \n218.  Surveillance is not authorized when the authorization for it has been obtained by \nfalse and misleading statements.  As the Supreme Court stated in Franks v. Delaware, \"[W]hen \nthe Fourth Amendment demands a factual showing sufficient to comprise 'probable cause,' the \nobvious assumption is that there will be a truthful showing.\" 438 U.S. 154, 164-165 (1978) \n(internal quotation omitted, alteration and emphasis in original). \n219.  The FISA provides that “[a]n aggrieved person . . . who has been subjected to an \nelectronic surveillance or about whom information obtained by electronic surveillance of such \nperson has been disclosed or used in violation of section 1809 of this title shall have a cause of \naction against any person who committed such violation.”  50 U.S.C. § 1810. \n220.  As set forth above, pursuant to the First FISA Warrant issued on October 21, 2016, \nwhich was procured on the basis of false and misleading information provided to the FISC, the \nindividual Defendants  and others, known and  unknown to  Dr. Page,  engaged in electronic \nsurveillance against Dr. Page that was not lawfully authorized by FISA, and disclosed or used \n50 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 51 of 59\n \ninformation obtained by that electronic surveillance knowing or having reason to know that the \ninformation was obtained through electronic surveillance not lawfully authorized by FISA, and \naided and abetted one another in doing so. \n221.  The individual Defendants’ acts were willful, knowing, deliberate and malicious. \n222.   As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ actions, Dr. Page suffered harm. \nHe was falsely portrayed as a traitor to his country, lost at least tens of millions of dollars of \nbusiness opportunities and future lifetime earning potential, and has suffered and will continue to \nsuffer mental and emotional pain for his lifetime, in addition to other pecuniary harms such as \ncosts, fees, attorneys’ fees and other losses. \n \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nFOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT \n(JANUARY 12th, 2017 FISA WARRANT – FIRST RENEWAL) \n(Against All Individual Defendants) \n223.  Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1-\n222 above, as if fully set forth herein.  \n224.  As set forth above, pursuant to the Second FISA Warrant issued on January 12, \n2017, which was procured on the basis of false and misleading information provided to the FISC, \nthe individual Defendants and others, known and unknown to Dr. Page, engaged in electronic \nsurveillance against Dr. Page that was not lawfully authorized by FISA, and disclosed or used \ninformation obtained by that electronic surveillance knowing or having reason to know that the \ninformation was obtained through electronic surveillance not lawfully authorized by FISA, and \naided and abetted one another in doing so. \n225.  The individual Defendants’ acts were willful, knowing, deliberate and malicious. \n51 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 52 of 59\n \n226.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ actions, Dr. Page suffered harm. \nHe was falsely portrayed as a traitor to his country, lost at least tens of millions of dollars of \nbusiness opportunities and future lifetime earning potential, and has suffered and will continue to \nsuffer mental and emotional pain for his lifetime, in addition to other pecuniary harms such as \ncosts, fees, attorneys’ fees and other losses. \n \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nFOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT \n(APRIL 7th, 2017 FISA WARRANT – SECOND RENEWAL) \n(Against All Individual Defendants) \n227.  Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1-\n226 above, as if fully set forth herein.  \n228.  As set forth above, pursuant to the Third FISA Warrant issued on April 7, 2017, \nwhich was procured on the basis of false and misleading information provided to the FISC, the \nindividual Defendants  and others, known and  unknown to  Dr. Page,  engaged in electronic \nsurveillance against Dr. Page that was not lawfully authorized by FISA, and disclosed or used \ninformation obtained by that electronic surveillance knowing or having reason to know that the \ninformation was obtained through electronic surveillance not lawfully authorized by FISA, and \naided and abetted one another in doing so. \n229.  The individual Defendants’ acts were willful, knowing, deliberate and malicious. \n230.   As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ actions, Dr. Page suffered harm. \nHe was falsely portrayed as a traitor to his country, lost at least tens of millions of dollars of \nbusiness opportunities and future lifetime earning potential, and has suffered and will continue to \nsuffer mental and emotional pain for his lifetime, in addition to other pecuniary harms such as \ncosts, fees, attorneys’ fees and other losses. \n52 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 53 of 59\n \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nFOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT \n(JUNE 29th, 2017 FISA WARRANT – THIRD RENEWAL) \n(Against All Individual Defendants) \n231.  Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1-\n230 above, as if fully set forth herein.  \n232.  As set forth above, pursuant to the Fourth FISA Warrant issued on June 29th, 2017, \nwhich was procured on the basis of false and misleading information provided to the FISC, the \nindividual Defendants  and others, known and  unknown to  Dr. Page,  engaged in electronic \nsurveillance against Dr. Page that was not lawfully authorized by FISA, and disclosed or used \ninformation obtained by that electronic surveillance knowing or having reason to know that the \ninformation was obtained through electronic surveillance not lawfully authorized by FISA, and \naided and abetted one another in doing so. \n233.  The individual Defendants’ acts were willful, knowing, deliberate and malicious. \n234.   As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ actions, Dr. Page suffered harm. \nHe was falsely portrayed as a traitor to his country, lost at least tens of millions of dollars of \nbusiness opportunities and future lifetime earning potential, and has suffered and will continue to \nsuffer mental and emotional pain for his lifetime, in addition to other pecuniary harms such as \ncosts, fees, attorneys’ fees and other losses. \n \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nFEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT \n(Against Defendant United States of America) \n235.  Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1-\n234 above, as if fully set forth herein.  \n53 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 54 of 59\n \n236.  The  Federal  Tort  Claims  Act  provides  “[t]he  United  States  shall  be  liable, \nrespecting the provisions of this title relating to tort claims, in the same manner and to the same \nextent as a private individual under like circumstances.” 28 U.S.C. § 2674.  \n237.  Plaintiff has exhausted his administrative remedies under 28 U.S.C. § 2675 of the \nFederal Tort Claims Act as a prerequisite to instituting a claim against the United States for money \ndamages for injury or loss of property or personal injury caused by the negligent or wrongful act \nor omission of any employee of the United States Government while acting within the scope of his \nor her office or employment. \n238.  By letter dated May 1, 2020, Plaintiff presented his administrative claim to DOJ.  \nBy letter dated May 26, 2020, DOJ issued a final denial of the claim.  The May 26, 2020 letter also \nstates that it constitutes DOJ’s issuance to Dr. Page of a “right-to-sue\" letter. \n239.  The individual Defendants, known and unknown to Dr. Page, are investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h). \n240.  The individual Defendants, known and unknown to Dr. Page, committed an abuse \nof process because they acted with an ulterior motive in using the FISA warrant process to \naccomplish an end unintended and not permitted by law, to wit, to spy on the Trump presidential \ncampaign by unlawfully invading the privacy of Dr. Page without probable cause. \n241.  The individual Defendants’ acts were willful, knowing, deliberate and malicious. \n242.   As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ actions, Dr. Page suffered harm. \nHe was falsely branded as a traitor to his country, lost at least tens of millions of dollars of business \nopportunities and future lifetime earning potential, and has suffered and will continue to suffer \nmental and emotional pain for his lifetime, in addition to other pecuniary harms such as costs, fees, \nattorneys’ fees and other losses. \n54 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 55 of 59\n \nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nBIVENS CLAIM \n(Against All Individual Defendants) \n243.  Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1-\n242 above, as if fully set forth herein.  \n244.  The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution “guarantees to citizens of \nthe United States the absolute right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures carried out \nby virtue of federal authority.” Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, \n403 U.S. 388, 392 (1971).  \n245.  The individual Defendants knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard \nfor the truth, made or caused to be made false and misleading statements in the applications for \nthe FISA Warrants against Dr. Page, and those false statements were necessary to the finding of \nprobable cause. \n246.  Reasonable officers in the same circumstances and possessing the same knowledge \nas the Defendants could not have believed that probable cause existed for a FISA warrant to issue \nagainst Dr. Page.  \n247.  A Plaintiff is entitled to damages for injuries resulting from a violation of Fourth \nAmendment rights by federal officers. See Bivens, 403 U.S. at 395-96. \n248.

The Privacy Act provides a civil action when an agency discloses “any record \nwhich is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to \nanother agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the \nindividual to whom the record pertains.”  5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(3)(D); 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b). \n259.  If the agency acted in an intentional or willful manner in violation of either 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552a(d)(3)(D), the individual is entitled to the sum of “actual damages sustained by the individual \nas a result of the refusal or failure . . . and the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney \nfees as determined by the court” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(4).  \n260.

Plaintiff is entitled to damages for Defendants’ willful violation of Plaintiff’s rights \nunder 5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(3)(D).  \n262.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ actions, Dr. Page suffered harm. \nHe was falsely portrayed as a traitor to his country, lost at least tens of millions of dollars of \nbusiness opportunities and future lifetime earning potential, and has suffered and will continue to \nsuffer mental and emotional pain for his lifetime, in addition to other pecuniary harms such as \ncosts, fees, attorneys’ fees and other losses. \n57 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-03460   Document 1   Filed 11/27/20   Page 58 of 59\n \n263.
