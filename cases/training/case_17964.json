    "summary": "<p>Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, 50 U.S.C. &sect; 1881a, permits the Attorney General (AG) and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance targeting the communications of non-U.S. persons located abroad. The government need not establish probable cause that the target of electronic surveillance is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power, nor must the government specify the nature and location of the facilities or places that surveillance will occur. Communications of U.S. citizens and residents are frequently collected \"incidentally\" if those U.S. persons are communicating with or about a targeted foreigner.</p>\r\n<p>Section 702 requires that the AG, through the Department of Justice (DOJ), and DNI, through the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), submit annual &ldquo;certifications&rdquo; that define the categories of foreign actors that may be appropriately targeted. By law, these certifications must include specific targeting and minimization procedures adopted by the AG in consultation with the DNI. These certifications must be approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) before Section 702 surveillance may be conducted. For a more in-depth overview of the certification process, see <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14411\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">[In re DNI/AG 702(i) Certification 2008]</a> in this Clearinghouse.</p>\r\n<p>This entry describes the 2019 certification. On September 17, 2019, the Attorney General and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence submitted the targeting, minimization, and querying procedures of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), and the National Counter-Terrorism Center (NCTC) to the FISC for their annual review. Judge James E. Boasberg took the case, and he issued an order on December 6, 2019 approving all procedures.</p>\r\n<p>The 2019 minimization procedures were submitted a little later than usual because of the longer than typical approval process in 2018; for more information on that set of FISC cases, see <a href=\"../../../../detail.php?id=17386\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">[Caption Redacted] DNI/AG 702(h) Cerifications 2018 (July 2019) (702, Cabranes, J.; Tallman, J.; Sentelle, J.)</a>. Judge Boasberg dedicated part of this opinion to discuss the status of the implementation of the changes that the FBI promised to make to their querying procedures, essentially search terms of data collected under 702 of FISA, in the 2018 minimization procedures approval process. Specifically, the FBI promised to collect the query terms used on 702 data and improve procedures for justifying a search of the 702 data, which are typically used to target foreign individuals, for queries about a U.S. person. Judge Boasberg noted that the FBI had made progress in recording its query terms, highlighting the use of a SharePoint site to document the terms. Though this was a temporary fix, he was satisfied that it showed progress toward the ultimate goal. Judge Boasberg next discussed the justification process, saying that there were still \"widespread violations\" of FISC querying standards within the FBI, even after the approval of the 2018 procedures. However, he noted that FBI employees still needed time to adjust to the new protocols, and highlighted the use of a new FBI program to make it easier to opt out of searching 702 data. He found these remedies to be satisfactory, and did not allow these issues to hold up approval.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Boasberg also discussed changes to the NSA's targeting procedures. First, he noted new opt-out procedures in the upstream data collection process. The circumstances under which the opt-out procedures would occur were redacted. Judge Boasberg was confident that this procedure did not put U.S. citizens at significantly greater risk of surveillance under 702, though. He also discussed new procedures surrounding the transfer of targeting information between the NSA and the FBI. While he said that the change left the NSA with leeway to determine what information it shares with the FBI when it refers a target to the FBI for surveillance, he was satisfied with the NSA's proposal to provide updates to the court every 45 days on the standardization of this information transfer.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Boasberg also analyzed the querying and minimization procedures of all the agencies. Most of this section focused on User Activity Monitoring (UAM), or the surveillance of employees on the agency's computer network to make sure they're using the internet appropriately. Judge Boasberg was pleased with the CIA and FBI's protocols here, saying that limiting access to this information to insider threat analysts and regularly deleting information that did not pose a threat satisfied requirements in the FISA. Though the NSA did not regularly review or delete irrelevant UAM, Judge Boasberg allowed it, buying the NSA's argument that it may take time to identify an insider threat, and that there was a very low risk of this information being used in a 702 context in the first place. Another highlight of Judge Boasberg's opinion noted the extension of the NSA's retention of upstream communications data from two years to five years. He stated that this was acceptable because changes in upstream monitoring in previous 702 approvals greatly reduced the risk of U.S. citizens being caught up in 702 monitoring.</p>\r\n<p>From an administrative standpoint, Judge Boasberg said that the filing conformed to statutory requirements for information to include, and that the procedures, considered as a unit, met the Fourth Amendment's requirements, making them reasonable searches and seizures.</p>\r\n<p>With the approval, the case is now closed. The next 702 approval process occurred in 2020.</p>",

This assessment must be particularized and fact-based, \ninformed by analytic judgment, the specialized training and experience of the analyst, as well as \nthe nature of the foreign intelligence information expected to be obtained.

(U) POST-TARGETING ANALYSIS BY NSA \n(U) After a person has been targeted for acquisition by NSA, NSA will cdnduct post-targeting \nanalysis as described herein.  Such analysis is designed to detect those occasions when a person \nwho when targeted was reasonably believed to be located outside the United States is located in \nthe United States, and will enable NSA to take steps to prevent the intentional acquisition of any \ncommunication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of \nacquisition to be located in the United States, or the intentional targeting of a person who is . \ninside the United States.  Such analysis may include: \na)  eg,)HF5 For telephone numbers: \nâ€¢  NSA analysts may analyze content for indications that a foreign target is located in or \nintends to enter the United States.

(U) DOCUMENTATION \n(U) Analysts who request tasking will document in the tasking database a citation or citations to \nthe information that led them to reasonably believe that a targeted person is located outside the \nUnited States.  Before tasking is approved, the database entry for that tasking will be reviewed in \norder to verify that the database entry contains the necessary citations. \n(U)\n(SI INF) A citation is a reference that identifies the source of the information, such as a report \nnumber or communications intercept identifier, which NSA will maintain.  The citation will \nenable those responsible for conducting oversight to locate and review the information that led \nNSA analysts to conclude that a target is reasonably believed to be located outside the United \nStates. \n(U) Analysts also will identify the authorized foreign power or foreign territory about which they \nexpect to obtain foreign intelligence information pursuant to the proposed targeting, and will \nprovide a written explanation of the basis for their assessment, at the time of targeting, that the \ntarget possesses, is expected to receive, and/or is likely to communicate foreign intelliÂ°gence \ninformation concerning that authorized foreign power or foreign territory. \nIV. (U) OVERSIGHT AND COMPLIANCE \n(U) NSA will conduct compliance and oversight activities, on an ongoing basis, with respect to \nits exercise of the authority under section 702 of the Act, including the associated targeting, \nminimization, and querying procedures adopted in accordance with section 702.  NSA will \ndevelop and deliver training regarding the applicable procedures to ensure NSA personnel \nresponsible for approving the targeting of persons under these procedures, as well as NSA \npersonnel with access to the acquired foreign intelligence information understand their \nresponsibilities and the procedures that apply to this acquisition.  NSA has established processes \nfor ensuring that raw traffic is labeled and stored only in authorized repositories, and is \naccessible only to those who have had the proper training.  NSA will conduct ongoing oversight \nactivities and will make any necessary reports, including those relating to incidents of \nnoncompliance, to the NSA Inspector General and OGC, in accordance with its NSA \ncharter.  NSA will also ensure that necessary corrective actions are taken to address any \nidentified deficiencies. To that end, NSA will conduct periodic spot checks of targeting decisions \nand intelligence disseminations to ensure compliance with established procedures, and conduct \nperiodic spot checks of queries in data repositories. \n(U) The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence \n(ODNI) will conduct oversight ofNSA's exercise of the authority under section 702 of the Act, \nwhich will include periodic reviews by DOJ and ODNI personnel to evaluate the implementation \nof the procedures.  Such reviews will occur approximately once every two months. \n9 \nAuthorized for Public Release on:  September 4, 2020  Page 9 of 11 NSA's Section 702 Targeting Procedures, Sep. 17, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nI bi SEEi& Ill Sill 14 61 GIG t \n(U) NSA will report to DOJ, to the ODNI Office of General Counsel, and to the ODNI Civil \nLiberties Protection Officer any incidents of noncompliance with these procedures by NSA \npersonnel that result in the intentional targeting of a person reasonably believed to be located in \nthe United States, the intentional targeting of a United States person, or the intentional \nacquisition of any communication in which the sender and all intended recipients are known at \nthe time of acquisition to be located within the United States.  NSA will provide such reports \nwithin five business days oflearning of the incident.  Any information acquired by intentionally \ntargeting a United States person or a person not reasonably believed to be outside the United \nStates at the time of such targeting will be purged from NSA databases. \n(U) NSA will report to DOJ through the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the National \nSecurity Division with responsibility for intelligence operations and oversight, to the ODNI \nOffice of General Counsel, and to the ODNI Civil Liberties Protection Officer, -any incidents of \nnoncompliance (including overcollection) by any electronic communication service provider to \nwhom the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence issued a directive under \nsection 702.  Such report will be made within five business days after determining that the \nelectronic communication service provider has not complied or does not intend to comply with a \ndirective. \n(U) In the event that NSA concludes that a person is reasonably believed to be located outside \nthe United States and after targeting this person learns that the person is inside the United States, \nor ifNSA concludes that a person who at the time of targeting was believed to be a non-United \nStates person is believed to be a United States person, it will take the following steps: \n1)  Terminate the acquisition without delay from all facilities tasked in accordance with \nthese procedures and used by that target, and determine whether to obtain \nauthorization under another section of the Act.  IfNSA inadvertently acquires a \ncommunication sent to or from the target while the target is or was located inside the \nUnited States, including any communication where the sender and all intended \nrecipients are reasonably believed to be located inside the United States at the time of \nacquisition, such communication will be treated in accordance with the applicable \nminimization and querying procedures. \n2)  Report the incident to DOJ through the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the \nNational Security Division with responsibility for intelligence operations and \noversight, to the ODNI Office of General Counsel, and to the ODNI Civil Liberties \nProtection Officer within five business days. \nV. (U) DEPARTURE FROM PROCEDURES \n(U) If, in order to protect against an immediate threat to the nation.al security, NSA determines \nthat it must take action, on a temporary basis, in apparent departure from these procedures and \nthat it is not feasible to obtain a timely modification of these procedures from the Attorney \nGeneral and Director of National Intelligence, NSA may take such action and will report that \nactivity promptly to ODNI and to DOJ's National Security Division, which will promptly notify \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of such activity.

On the \ngovernment's motion, and in order to allow for a full consideration of the issues presented, the \nCourt extended this period by 60 days, until December 16, 2019, under Section 702(k)(2).  See \nOrder, Oct. 1, 2019.  By order dated October 3, 2019, the Court further ordered the government \nto submit updates on certain compliance incidents that arose in connection with prior acquisitions \nunder Section 702.  Specifically, the Court required further information regarding: (i) NSA's \nnd steps that NSA was taking to \nremedy that failure; and (ii) NCTC and potentially other agencies' failure to delete reports that \nwere subject to recall by NSA for compliance or other reasons.  See Order, Oct. 3, 2019.  The \ngovernment filed responsive submissions on November 4 and November 13, 2019. \nB.

The President appointed Vice Admiral Maguire to serve as \nacting DNI after the resignations, effective August 15, 2019, of the DNI and Principal Deputy \nDNI.  See September 17, 2019, Memorandum, at 2 n.1.  At the time of such appointment, he had \nserved as the Director of NCTC, with the confirmation of the Senate, since December 2 7, 2018. \nSee id.  He was eligible to be appointed acting DNI because he was serving \"in an office \n[Director of NCTC] for which appointment is required to be made by the President, by and with \nthe advice and consent of the Senate.\"  5 U.S.C. Â§ 3345(a)(2).  (It appears that he was separately \neligible for such appointment underÂ§ 3345(a)(3), but subsection (a)(2) suffices on its own.) \nSimilarly, the Court has reviewed the certifications in the Prior 702 Dockets, as amended \nby the 2019 Certifications, and finds that they also contain all the elements required by the \nstatute.  Those amendments have the same effective dates as the 2019 Certifications.

The following discussion primarily \nfocuses on proposed changes to the previously approved procedures, but the procedures as a \nwhole must be consistent with statutory and constitutional requirements.  Some technical, \nconforming edits and other changes are not specifically discussed because they raise no issues \nmaterial to the Court's review. \nIII.  THE TARGETING PROCEDURES \nTargeting procedures must be \"reasonably designed\" to \"ensure that any acquisition \nauthorized under[Â§ 702(a)] is limited to targeting persons reasonably believed to be located \noutside the United States\" and to \"prevent the intentional acquisition of any communication as to \nwhich the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of the acquisition to be located \nin the United States.\"  Â§ 702(d)(l); see alsoÂ§ 702(b)(l) (acquisitions \"may not intentionally \ntarget any person known at the time of acquisition to be located in the United States\"); Â§ \n702(b)(4) (acquisitions \"may not intentionally acquire any communication as to which the sender \nand all intended recipients are known at the time of acquisition to be located in the United \nStates'}  Additionally, the government uses the targeting procedures to ensure that acquisitions \ndo \"not intentionally target a United States person reasonably believed to be located outside the \nUnited States.\"  Â§ 702(b)(3).  Pursuant toÂ§ 702U)(2)(B), the Court assesses whether the targeting \nprocedures satisfy those criteria.  The Court must also determine whether the targeting \nprocedures, along with the querying and minimization procedures, are consistent with the \nrequirements of the Fourth Amendment.

It may not task \na selector without first determining that the target is reasonably believed to be a non-U.S. person \noutside the United States (a \"foreignness determination\").

The Court expects NSA to make \nsuc.h detem1inations on an individualized, case-by-case basis, by assessing the totality of \ninformation available about a particular target or selector.  In close cases, the Court expects NSA \nto err on the side of providing information to the FBI, rather than withholding it, so that the FBI \nis better able to make informed and accurate decisions under its targeting procedures. \nThe government reports that it will take time to implement these new information-sharing \nrequirements, but has not provided an estimate of how much time.  The Court views these \nrequirements as important enhancements and expects them to be implemented expeditiously. \nThe government has undertaken to report to the Court on such implementation every 45 days, \nand the Court intends to monitor closely the agencies' progress on implementing these new \nrequirements. \nort, submitted on November 1, 2019, the  ovemment advised that NSA has \nI OP SELKE I nsrnORCOMNOFORN  Page 17 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 17 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\n11-12.

But it \nmust also be noted that Section V of the NSA targeting procedures similarly permits that agency, \nwhen faced with an immediate threat, to forgo steps and assessments it ordinarily is required to \ntake before tasking  If the same account were the occasion \nfor departures by both agencies, it theoretically could be tasked \nithout any research regarding, or assessment of, whether the account's user is a non \nU.S. person located outside the United States.  NSA's emergency-departure provision requires \nthe government to \"continue to adhere to all of the statutory limitations set forth\" in Section \n702(b), so intentional targeting of U.S. persons or persons known to be in the United States \nwould be prohibited, even in exigent circumstances.  See 2019 NSA Targeting Procedures Â§ V. \nAnd the requirement that the FBI take the otherwise required steps no later than the next business \nday and notification to NSD and ODNI, and ultimately the FISC, act as further checks against \npotential abuse of this provision.  On balance, the Court finds it reasonable to approve this \nprovision, on the expectation that it will be promptly informed of any circumstances in which it \nis invoked. \nD.  Conclusion \nThis Court has previously found the current versions of the FBI's and NSA's targeting \nprocedures to comply with statutory requirements.  See October 18, 2018, Opinion at 132.  The \nabove-described changes to those procedures, individually and taken together, do not undermine \nthe bases for those prior findings.

Although the FBI need not conduct certain checks when they are likely to be \nredundant of steps recently taken by NSA, NSA now \nbefore tasking a selector \nnet effect of those changes should be earlier detection of any indication that a proposed \nacquisition may concern a target who is a U.S. person or in the United States.  The new \ninformation-sharing requirements should enhance the FBI's ability to research and evaluate \nwhether a target is a U.S. person or in the United States \nThe Court concludes, accordingly, that the 2019 NSA Targeting Procedures and the 2019 \nFBI Targeting Procedures, as written, are reasonably designed, as required by Section 702(d)(l), \nto: (1) ensure that any acquisition authorized under the 2019 Certifications is limited to targeting \npersons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States, and (2) prevent the \nintentional acquisition of any communication as to which the sender and all intended recipients \nare known at the time of the acquisition to be located in the United States.  For the reasons stated \nabove and in the Court's opinions in the Prior 702 Dockets, moreover, it concludes that the NSA \nand FBI Targeting Procedures, as written, are reasonably designed to prevent United States \npers.ons from being targeted for acquisition - a finding that is relevant to the Court's analysis of \nwhether those procedures are consistent with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.

THE MINIMIZATION PROCEDURES AND QUERYING PROCEDURES \nPursuant to Â§ 702(i)(2)(C), the Court must assess whether the minimization procedures \ncomply with specified statutory requirements.  Section 702(e)(l) requires that the procedures \n\"meet the definition of minimization procedures under [50 U.S.C. Â§ l 80l(h) or 1821(4)].\"  That \ndefinition requires \n(1) specific procedures ... that are reasonably designed in light of the purpose and \ntechnique  of the  particular surveillance  [or physical  search],  to  minimize the \nacquisition and retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly available \ninformation concerning unconsenting United States persons consistent with the need \nof the  United  States  to  obtain,  produce,  and  disseminate  foreign  intelligence \ninformation; \n(2) procedures that require that nonpublicly available information, which is  not \nforeign intelligence information, as defined in [50 U.S.C. Â§ l 801(e)(l)], shall not be \ndisseminated in a manner that identifies any United States person, without such \nperson's consent, unless such person's identity is necessary to understand foreign \nintelligence information or assess its importance; [and] \n(3) notwithstanding paragraphs (I) and (2), procedures that allow for the retention \nand dissemination of information that is evidence of a crime which has been, is \nbeing, or is about to be committed and that is to be retained or disseminated for law \nenforcement purposes[.] \nÂ§ 180l(h).  The definition of \"minimization procedures\" atÂ§ 1821(4) is substantively identical to \nthe definition atÂ§ l 80l(h) (although Â§ 1821(4)(A) refers to \"the purposes ... of the particular \nphysical search\").  For simplicity, subsequent citations refer only to Â§ 1801 (h). \nIn applying these statutory requirements, the Court is mindful that Section 702 \nacquisitions target persons reasonably believed to be non-U.S. persons outside the United States. \nAlthough such targets may communicate with or about U.S. persons, Section 702 acquisitions, as \na general matter, are less likely to acquire information about U.S. persons that is unrelated to the \nTOP lJE OftiiT ':'Bl'.'.ODOOII '.tiOS@Plf  Page 24 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 24 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTO F 2JE@MJ I i\\101:\\IOR OOHlf fO PO Rf f \nforeign-intelligence purpose of the acquisition than, for example, electronic surveillance or \nphysical search of a home or workplace within the United States that a target shares with U.S. \npersons.

The FISC must determine whether querying procedures satisfy the \nrequirements ofÂ§ 702(Â±)(1).  SeeÂ§ 702(j)(3)(A)-(B). \nEach agency's procedures make clear that the qu~rying and minimization procedures are \nto be read and applied together.  See, e.g .â€¢ 2019 NSA Querying ProceduresÂ§ I (\"These querying \nprocedures should be read and applied in conjunction with [the separate] minimization \nprocedures, and nothing in these procedures permits any actions that would otherwise be \nprohibited by those minimization procedures.\"); 2019 FBI Querying Procedures Â§ I at l (same); \n2019 NSA Minimization Procedures Â§ I at 1 (\"These minimization procedures apply in addition \nto separate querying procedures ....

Background on Section 702 Minimization and Querying \nEach agency with access to \"raw,\" or unminimized, information obtained under Section \n702 (NSA, FBI, CIA, and NCTC) is governed by its own set of minimization procedures in \nhandling that information.  This opinion uses the terms \"raw\" and \"unminimized\" \ninterchangeably.  The NCTC Minimization Procedures define \"raw\" information as: \nsection 702-acquired information that (i) is in the same or substantially the same \nformat as when NSA or FBI acquired it, or (ii) has been processed only as necessary \nto  render  it into  a form  in which it can be evaluated to  detennine whether it \nreasonably appears to be foreign  intelligence information or to  be  necessary to \nunderstand foreign intelligence information or assess its importance. \n2019 NCTC Minimization ProceduresÂ§ A.3.d at 2. \nThere are significant differences among the various sets of minimization procedures \nbased on factors such as the agencies' differing missions, legal and policy constraints, and \ntechnical infrastructure, but they share several important features in common.  Regarding \nacquisition, NSA is required to conduct acquisitions \"in a manner designed, to the greatest extent \nreasonably feasible, to minimize the acquisition of information not relevant to the authorized \npurpose of the acquisition.\"  2019 NSA Minimization ProceduresÂ§ 4(a) at 5.

The government submitted those \nreports on March 29, 2019. \nThey explain that the CIA, NSA, and FBI \"routinely conduct consensual monitoring of \ntheir classified and unclassified computer systems to ensure that the systems remain secure and \nthat sensitive information that is transmitted, stored, or processed on the systems is not used for \nunauthorized purposes.\"  September 17, 2019, Memorandum, at 37. \nTSP EJ@CMTi'!'9108ftC8Hllf fO~SIUf  Page 29 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 29 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOP SFGPFT'.'.SJ'.:OPGON'.tlOFOPtJ  Page 30 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 30 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nThe CIA, NSA, and FBI all conduct certain forms of monitoring routinely, as well as \n11QP SFSRF11'.'.SJ'.'.OPGODI'.tl0FOPN  Page 31 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 31 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nThe government describes its understanding that the agencies' UAM activities are \nauthorized by various statutes, see NSA UAM Submission at 7-11 (discussing, among other \nprovisions, 50 U.S.C. Â§ 3232(a) and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2012 Â§ 922, Pub. L. 112-81), as well as by Executive Order No. 13587 and guidance issued \nthereunder.  See id. at 11-15.

SeeÂ§ 702(e)(l), (f)(l)(A). \nInformation about the conduct of users of agency systems recorded by UAM activities - ~. that \nJohn Doe downloaded a particular file - is neither an acquisition authorized under Section 702(a) \nnor information collected pursuant to such an authorization, regardless of whether the \ndownloaded file happened to contain Section 702-acquired information.  The Court's \nresponsibility is to determine whether the procedures properly protect private U.S.-person \ninformation that was acquired pursuant to a  Section 702 authorization, which is typically found \nin Section 702-acquired communications to which a U.S. person is a party or that discuss a U.S. \nperson. \n2.  Minimization Provisions for UAM Activities \nThe proposed minimization procedures have protections against the improper use of \nSection 702 information in UAM systems, including limiting access and use of information to \npersonnel involved in the agency's insider threat mission.  Specifically for each agency: \nFBI The FBI's proposed procedures permit retention of Section 702-acquired \ninformation in UAM systems only in furtherance of authorized UAM purposes.

See \n2019 CIA Minimization ProceduresÂ§ 7.e. \nNSA.  The proposed NSA minimization procedures would permit indefinite retention of \nunminimized Section 702-acquired information in NSA's UAM systems.  See 2019 NSA \nMinimization Procedures Â§ 10.  NSA may use such information \"solely to deter, detect, and \notherwise protect against unauthorized access and use ofNSA's systems and networks.\"  Id. \nAccess to such UAM systems is limited to personnel with UAM duties \nwho have been trained on the procedures.

NSA's UAM systems are not \ncapable of \"aging off data at set intervals or deleting individual records.\"  NSA UAM \nSubmission at 17; accord September 17, 2019, Memorandum, at 46.  The Court understands that \nlack of capability to have resulted from a policy deten11ination that \"it is critical for [NSA's] \nUAM personnel to retain all of the information stored in its UAM repositories indefinitely.\" \nNSA UAM Submission at 17.  In addition, even the FBI and CIA would not be required to \nsystematically review their UAM systems to find any unminimized Section 702-acquired \ninformation and, if they discover such infom1ation on a UAM system, they may retain it there for \nas long as doing so serves a UAM purpose, subject to the above-described reporting requirement. \nThe government contends that these relatively lax retention standards are justified because \"it \nmay take years to detect an insider threat, and once detected, UAM personnel will likely need to \nreview older information captured through UAM processes with new context.\"  September 17, \n2019, Memorandum, at 41. \nThe Court finds that rationale persuasive, in the context of the limited amount of \nunminimized Section 702 information likely to be contained in UAM systems, the limited \nnumber of personnel with access to those systems, and the limited purposes for which such \nsystems are used.  The government's reporting on how UAM systems are currently configured \nand operated indicates that such access restrictions are largely in place.

Â§ 1801(h). \n3.  Exclusion of Searches of UAM Systems From Querying Procedures \nThe government proposes to exclude searches of agency systems from the definition of a \n\"query\" for purposes of the querying procedures for the FBI, CIA, and NSA, \"so long as the only \nunminimized section 702-acquired information that the searches run against are in records \ncaptured through user activity monitoring.\"  NSA Querying Procedures Â§ III.A; FBI Querying \nProceduresÂ§ III.A; CIA Querying Procedures Â§ III.A. \nFor purposes of Section 702 querying procedures, FISA defines \"query\" as \"the use of \none or more terms to retrieve the unminimized contents or noncontents located in electronic and \ndata storage systems of communications of or concerning United States persons obtained through \nacquisitions authorized\" under Section 702(a).

(Recall that the proposed minimization procedures require any \nsearch of a UAM system that contains unminimized Section 702 information to have a UAM \npurpose.)  And, in the government's view, any search for a UAM purpose would not involve the \nuse of one or more terms to retrieve unminimized communications of or concerning U.S. persons \nobtained under Section 702 and therefore would not be a query as defined by the statute.  See \nSeptember 17, 2019, Memorandum, at 49-53.  The Court concludes that it is pem1issible to \nexclude searches of UAM systems for UAM purposes from the querying procedures, but its \nanalysis deviates somewhat from the government's arguments. \nThe government relies on a statement in the legislative history of Section 702(f) that \n\"query refers only to retrievals of 'of or concerning United States persons,' and, therefore, the \nnew querying procedures requirement does not apply to queries that are not specifically intended \nto return communications 'of or concerning United States persons.\"' H.R. Rep. No. 115-475 part \nI, at 18 (2017) (cited by September 17, 2019, Memorandum, .at 49 n.29).  At the same time, \nhowever, the government concedes that the lack of a subjective intent to retrieve unminimized \nSection 702-acquired information does not necessarily mean that no query has occurred: it \nregards the use of terms to search the main repositories of unminimized Section 702 information \nas a \"query,\" even if the person conducting it did not intend to search Section 702 information, \nbut rather did so by mistake.  Id. at 50 n.30.  In the government's view, searching \"analytical \nrepositories ... designed to store unminimized FISA-acquired information\" justifies imputing \nthe personnel who conducted the search \"with the degree of intent necessary to trigger the \nstatutory definition of query.\"  Id. \nâ€¢or BtUÂ§Mlf:l;fBl:':101UiOJJ:liQFQlllI  Page 37 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 37 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nrrer \"12Cftl2ifh'\"I//OftCOU/N10fJOftcl', \nIn the Court's assessment, searches ofUAM systems conducted for UAM purposes and \notherwise in compliance with applicable minimization requirements (hereinafter \"UAM \nsearches\") are unlikely to retrieve unminimized U.S.-person communications.  That is due in part \nto the fact that UAM systems contain a limited amount of unminimized Section 702 information, \nparticularly in comparison to the main repositories of such information.  The nature of the UAM \npurposes for which such searches are conducted also supports that assessment.  Those purposes \nfocus on the conduct of users of agency systems, not on U.S.-person communications contained \nwithin such raw Section 702 data as was incidentally copied in the course of UAM.  Based on the \nsame considerations, moreover, the Court assesses that it is not reasonable to regard UAM \nsearches as intended to retrieve unminimized U.S.-person communications that were acquired \nunder Section 702. \nThe Court concludes that searches of government systems that are neither likely to \nretrieve such unminimized communications nor intended to do so fall outside the statutory \ndefinition of \"query.\" First, it would be an odd reading of the statutory text to conclude that a \nsearch involved \"the use of one or more terms to retrieve\" such communications, even though the \nsearch was not likely to retrieve them and the person running it did not intend to retrieve them.  It \nwould be anomalous, moreover, for unlikely and unintended search results to compel an after \nthe-fact conclusion that a particular search was a \"query,\" particularly in view of requirements \nthat agency personnel can satisfy only before they run a query.  See, e.g., 2019 CIA Querying \nProcedures Â§ IV.A (\"Each query of CIA systems ... must be reasonably likely to retrieve foreign \nintelligence information ... unless otherwise specifically excepted in these procedures.\"). \n'FOP SIBCRE'FHSJNOftOO\"N,'NOFOl@l  Page 38 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 38 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\noneo, \nI 01 el!!@HEJ;;Qfjj  fJf JOP0RP f \nFinally, it is congruent with the purpose of Section 702(f) to conclude that the statutory \ndefinition of \"query\" does not encompass searches that are neither likely nor intended to return \nunminimized U.S.-person communications obtained under Section 702.  Querying procedures \nmust be \"consistent with the requirements of the fourth amendment.\"  Section 702(f)(l)(A).  The \nlegislative history underscores the connection between the requirement to adopt querying \nprocedures and Fourth Amendment concerns: \nThe [House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence] is dedicated to \nproviding assurances to  the American public that the procedures and processes \ncurrently in place satisfy the Fourth Amendment, and do not impede on United States \nperson privacy. Therefore, the Committee believes that the Intelligence Community \nshould have separate procedures documenting their current policies and practices \nrelated to the querying of lawfully acquired FISA Section 702 data. \nH.R. Rep. No. 115-475 part I, at 17-18.  (The Court adverts to this legislative history for aid in \nresolving any ambiguity regarding the statutory definition of \"query.\")  The more specific \nstatutory requirements for queries of Section 702 information are naturally understood as means \nchosen by Congress to further the ends of ensuring and demonstrating compliance with the \nFourth Amendment and due protection of U.S. persons' privacy.  For example, Section 702(f)(2) \n(discussed further at pages 69-73 infra), requires the FBI to obtain a probable cause-based order \nfrom the FISC before examining the results of certain queries conducted using U.S.-person query \nterms in support of a predicated criminal investigation.  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt of Review has stated that \"Section 702(f)(2), it appears to us, is intended to address ... \ncompliance with the Fourth Amendment\" and \"to avert any constitutional challenge to the FBI's \nconduct,\" particularly \"in everyday criminal investigations unrelated to national security and \nforeign intelligence needs.\"  Docket No. 18-03, In re DNVAG 702 h  Certification \n161 SEEi& I l, Sil, GRESi UI  I6  1 GIG t  Page 39 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 39 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nt 29  (FISCR July 12, 2019) (per curiam) \n(\"In re DNI/AG Certifications\"). \nQueries of the main repositories of unminimized Section 702 information substantially \nimplicate Fourth Amendment interests, particularly when U.S.-person query terms are used.  The \ntargets of acquisition under Section 702 are reasonably believed to be non-U.S. persons outside \nof the United States, and those acquisitions have a significant purpose of acquiring foreign \nintelligence information.  See pages 8-11 supra; Â§ 702(h)(2)(A)(v).  But the use of U.S.-person \nidentifiers to query the main repositories of unminimized Section 702 information indicates an \ninterest in retrieving information about non-target U.S. persons.  In the case of FBI queries \nintended to retrieve evidence of a crime, the interest in the retrieved information may be \nunrelated to  national security.  Consequently, the unjustified use of U.S.-person query terms to \nsearch the main repositories of unminimized Section 702 info1mation presents \"a serious risk of \nunwarranted intrusion into the private communications of ... U.S. persons,\" which \"weighs \nsubstantially in the assessment ofreasonableness.\" October 18, 2018, Opinion at 89. \nIn contrast, UAM searches do not present remotely comparable Fourth Amendment \nconcerns.  UAM systems contain a limited amount of unminimized Section 702 information.  If \nsomeone wanted to find and examine Section 702 information concerning a particular person, \nsearching a UAM system would be a poor means of doing so.  Searches that are conducted for a \nUAM purpose, moreover, will not generally be formulated in a way that is likely to retrieve \nunminimized communications of or concerning U.S. persons acquired under Section 702.  It is \npossible to construct hypothetical counterexamples - ~' a UAM search that is designed to \n1'QP ili.'11l:i1'11il(GQEGQN'NQFOPN  Page 40 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 40 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOR SFCPFT11Sl1fOPCONO>IOFORN \nretrieve infonnation about the system usage of a particular intelligence analyst during a particular \ntime, and it is known that at such time the analyst was tracking a Section 702 target who \ncommunicates with U.S. persons.  But even in such circumstances, any Fourth Amendment \nconcerns are substantially allayed by the limited amount of Section 702 information subject to \nsearch on a UAM system, as well as the UAM purpose of the search, to which the substance of \nany retrieved Section 702 information will be generally irrelevant.  (In the above hypothetical, \nthe purpose of the UAM search is to retrieve infommtion about the analyst's use of agency \nsystems, not to retrieve or examine any Section 702 information.) \nThe Court accordingly will approve the proposed exclusion of UAM searches from the \ndefinition of \"query\" in the CIA, NSA, and FBI querying procedures and concomitant exemption \nof such searches from the requirements of those procedures.  As explained above, however, that \napproval rests substantially on the factual premise that UAM searches are conducted against only \na limited amount of unminimized Section 702 infonnation that was incidentally copied during \nUAM processes.  The validity of that premise could be affected by changes in the scope or \nfunctioning of the agencies' UAM activities.  The Court, as a result, directs the government to \nupdate its descriptions of the UAM systems and processes employed by the FBI, CIA, and NSA \nby no later than March 26, 2021 - i.e., two years from the government's prior UAM submissions. \nC.  FBI Archival Systems \nThe FBI maintains systems to archive copies of messages from its classified email and \ninstant message systems.

As discussed below, \nthe FBI's current minimization procedures prohibit the transmission of such information in \nemails or instant messages.

The Court also approved the indefinite retention of such information that had already been \nplaced in these archival systems, notwithstanding otherwise-applicable retention limits, subject to \naccess to the systems being limited to \"FBI personnel who require access to perform their official \nduties or assist in a lawful and authorized governmental function, including system \nadministrators and other technical personnel, and who have received training on these \nminimization procedures and the Querying Procedures.\"  Id. at 119-20.

Id. at 119.  The Court also ordered that, in the event the FBI \nidentified data in such an archival system as unminimized Section 702-acquired information and \nsought to retain it in that system, the government must state in its next quarterly report to the \nCourt on Section 702 compliance matters: (1) whether the information could be retained on an \nFBI classified email or instant-messaging system as described in Sections III.F.4 or III.F.5 of the \n2018 FBI Minimization Procedures or in connection with litigation matters as described in \nSection III.I.3 of those procedures; and (2) if not, the reason retention of the infonnation in the \narchival system is necessary to the purposes served by that system.  Id. at 138. \nFinally, searches of the archival systems are currently subject to the FBI's querying \nprocedures.  See  2018 FBI Minimization Procedures Â§ III.F.5 (''Because the classified e-mails in \nthis archive may contain raw Section 702-acquired information, any queries in this archive must \nbe conducted in accordance with the Querying Procedures.\"); id. Â§ 111.F.6 (same for instant \nmessaging archive). \n2.  Proposed Rules for Retention in Archival Systems \nThe proposed FBI minimization procedures treat retention of unminimized Section 702 \ninformation in these archival systems in the same manner as they treat retention of such \ninformation in UAM systems.  If FBI personnel identify unminimized Section 702 information in \none of these archival systems, they must remove it from the system unless (1) it meets generally \nâ€¢Qr JHlllliiil;i;ifll'.'.BD iBJiilIOFOP!I  Page 43 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 43 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nI bi BECKE I;; Si!l UICCOIC H Ci CRH \napplicable retention criteria and is not otherwise subject to purge; or (2) \"it is necessary to retain \n[it] for the purposes served by\" the archival system in question, in which case the retention, and \nthe reason therefor, must be included in the next quarterly report to the Court on Section 702 \ncompliance matters, and the FBI must delete the infom1ation when it is no longer needed for such \npurpose.  See 2019 FBI Minimization ProceduresÂ§ 111.F.5 andÂ§ 111.F.6. \nThe proposed reporting requirement is narrower than the one that the Court adopted in \nOctober 2018, which requires reporting of every identified instance of continued retention of raw \nSection 702 data in an archival system, regardless of whether it is consistent with generally \napplicable retention criteria.  On the merits that is a reasonable modification, particularly in view \nof the prohibition against putting such data in classified FBI emails and instant messages.  For \nthat reason, the Court approves the narrower reporting requirement on a prospective basis. \nIt must be noted, however, that the government has unjustifiably disregarded the current \nreporting requirement.  Instead of taking concrete steps to comply even partially with the Court's \ndirective  (or timely seeking relief from it), it chose to wait while the FBI reportedly worked on \nguidance to instruct its personnel on how to handle unminimized Section 702 information on \nthese archival systems.  See Letter Regarding the FBI's Steps to Implement an Aspect of the \nCourt's 2018 Section 702 Opinion and Order, Sept. 27, 2019, at 3.  In fact, it has taken so long to \nprepare this guidance that, instead of using it to instruct personnel on the October 2018 reporting \nrequirement, which the government reports was the original plan, the FBI now intends to address \nonly the narrower reporting requirement incorporated into the FBI's proposed minimization \nifOF etf!l8Rf!lif;',lfU1\\'0IUOHJ,1ffQli8fllf  Page 44 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 44 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nT 8 P (JI] OlllJT,t1BUOROQf J;'.Jf QPOPltI \nprocedures.  See Letter Regarding the FBI's Steps taken by the FBI to implement an aspect of the \nComt's 2018 Section 702 Opinion and Order, Nov. 20, 2019, at 4. \nIt should be unnecessary to state that government officials are not free to decide for \nthemselves whether or to what extent they should comply with Court orders.  The government \nhas not sought retrospective relief from the reporting requirement imposed by the Court on \nOctober 18, 2018.  Although the AG and DNI have amended the prior Section 702 certifications \nto authorize the FBI to apply its proposed minimization procedures to information acquired under \nprior certifications, that authorization only becomes \"effective on October 17, 2019, or on the \ndate upon which [this Court] issues an order concerning [the] amendments pursuant to subsection \n702(j)(3) of the Act, whichever is later.\" \nThe Court's approval of those amendments does not have any nunc \npro tune effect, nor does it excuse the government from reporting instances of retention that it is \nalready obligated to report.  With respect to those instances of retention, the October 2018 \nreporting requirement remains in effect. \n3.  Proposed Rules for Searching Archival Systems \nIn another parallel with the proposed rules for UAM systems, the FBI's proposed \nquerying procedures would exclude searches of these archival systems from the definition of \n. \"query\" and therefore from the requirements of the querying procedures.  Specifically, the \ndefinition of \"query\" in the FBI Querying Procedures exempts \"searches conducted in the \n[archival] systems defined in Sections III.F.5 and 6 of the FBI's section 702 minimization \nprocedures in furtherance of an authorized use specified in those provisions.\"  2019 FBI \nI OP SELKE f ))Â§l))bktbMNUFOMâ—„  Page 45 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 45 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTef 211!JCftl!JiflHJIXOft@OPfi!f@OFO Mi \nQuerying Procedures Â§Â·III.A.  As noted above; those minimization provisions authorize searching \nsuch systems \"to assist in security, insider threat, inspection, and FBI-internal counterintelligence \ninquiries, functions, and investigations, and to respond to inguiries related to records \nmanagement and discovery.\"  2019 FBI Minimization ProceduresÂ§ III.F.5 andÂ§ III.F.6 \n( emphasis added).  The underscored language describes purposes quite different from UAM \npurposes; however, it is also the case that searches in furtherance of records management and \ndiscovery, like UAM searches, will generally not be fonnulated to retrieve unminimized \ninformation about U.S. persons acquired under Section 702.  In addition, the amount of \nunminimized Section 702 information in these archival systems is also limited, and, unlike UAM \nsystems, there is no prospect of more such inf01mation being added to the archival systems.  The \nCourt concludes accordingly that the reasons for approving an equivalent exemption for \nsearching UAM systems also apply to searches of these archival systems. \nD.  NSA's Retention Period for Upstream Collection Results \nThe government proposes to increase the general retention period for infonnation \nacquired by NSA 's upstream collection from two to five years.  See 2019 NSA Minimization \nProceduresÂ§ 4(c)(2).  NSA's general retention period for results of downstream collection \nremains five years.  Id.Â§ 4(c)(I).  The reasons for the historical distinction have been described \nin prior opinions, see, e.g., October 18, 2018, Opinion at 12-14, and are summarized here. \nInternet transactions acquired by upstream collection before March 17, 2017, contained a \ngreater proportion of information (including U. S.-person information) unrelated to 702 targets \nthan other forms of 702 collection for several reasons.  First, NSA sometimes acquired \"multiple \n-- - ~- -- -- ----- - -- - - ...  - -- ..

An MCT is a bundle of \ncommunications transiting part of the Internet togethe\n containing multiple \nmessages  See \nDocket Nos  Mem. Op. and Order, Apr. 26, 2017, \nat 15-16 (\"April 26, 2017, Opinion\").  (\"Active user\" refers to the user of a communication \nservice to or from whom an MCI is in transit when it is acquired. Id. at 16.)  Prior to March 17, \n2017, NSA acquired MCTs without regard to whether the active user was a Section 702 target. \nId. at 16-17.  Moreover, NSA acquired communications, including MCis, \"about\" -i.e., \ncontaining a reference to - a tasked selector, in addition to communications to or from a tasked \nselector. For example, if a single email message within an MCT contained a reference to a \ntasked email account, the entire MCI could be acquired, including numerous additional \nmessages that did not contain a reference to, and were not to or from, the tasked account.  Id. \nThose additional email messages could be wholly unrelated to the target.  Id. \nBecause upstream collection prior to March 17, 2017, was more likely than other forms \nof Section 702 collection to acquire information concerning U.S. persons with no foreign \nintelligence value, heightened restrictions were placed on NSA 's retention, use, and \ndissemination of the results of upstream collection.  One of those restrictions was a shorter, twoÂ­\nyear retention period.  See April 26, 2017, Opinion at 17-18, 26 n.29. As a result of compliance \nissues involving NSA's failure to follow some of those heightened restrictions (specifically, a \nprohibition on U.S.-person queries), NSA\nPage 47 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 47 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nJ\"CM!:'Pi i1:Jt,ren@er VNO 130:RN \nId. at 18-27.  Specifically, that collection acquires MCTs only \nif a Section 702 target is the active user or - i.e., a sender or recipient of - the entire MCT, \nincluding each discrete communication contained within it.  Id. at 26.  NSA 's cmTent \nminimization procedures now provide that \"[a]ny communications acquired pursuant to section \n702 that contain a reference to, but are not to or from, a person targeted in accordance with \nsection 702 targeting procedures are unauthorized acquisitions and therefore will be destroyed \nupon recognition.\"  2018 NSA Minimization ProceduresÂ§ 4(c)(3) (emphasis added). \nThe NSA's minimization procedures, as amended in March 2017 and approved in April \n2017, required the sequestration and destruction of all upstream Internet transactions collected \nprior to March 17, 2017.  See April 26, 2017, Opinion at 23-25.  Aside from information retained \nsubject to restricted access for litigation-hold purposes, NSA has completed its processes to \ndestroy those transactions, see October 18, 2018, Opinion at 14; and any that might remain in \nNSA systems are subject to destruction upon recognition under the proposed NSA minimization \nprocedures.  See 2019 NSA Minimization ProceduresÂ§ 4(c)(2). \nIn January 2018, Congress enacted the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017 \n(\"Reauthorization Act\"), Pub. L. No. 115-118, 132 Stat. 3 (2018).  The Reauthorization Act \nincluded Section 702(b )(5), which limits the acquisition of \"abouts\" communications - i.e., \n\"communications that contain a reference to, but are not to or from, a target of an acquisition \nauthorized\" under Section 702(a).  See Reauthorization ActÂ§ 103(a)(3).  That provision imposes, \nwith narrow exceptions for exigent circumstances, a requirement of congressional notification \nI Of SELKE I /I sr;; Ofteorn nepeftH  Page 48 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 48 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nI Gt  SEEi& I;; Sf)) OftCOi Cl 14 OPOIU f \nand a 30-day congressional-review period before the government can resume abouts collection \nunder Section 702.  Id. Â§ 103(b)(l)-(4). \nIn short, as of March I 7, 2017, NSA eliminated the features of upstream collection that \nmade it more likely than other forms of Section 702 collection to acquire non-target \ncommunications concerning U.S. persons and has purged Internet transactions acquired through \nupstream collection prior that date.  The government contends that the results of upstream \ncollection conducted after that date and currently possessed by NSA are no more sensitive, from \na U.S.-person-privacy perspective, than the results of downstream collection, such that a five \nyear retention period is appropriate for both sets of data.  The Court finds that approach \nreasonable.  It is directing the government to provide prompt notice in the event that new types of \nselectors are tasked for upstream collection.  See pages 81-82 infra.  Such notification, together \nwith the statutory pre-conditions to resuming acquisition of \"abouts\" communications, will \npermit the Court to examine whether future developments present a heightened risk to the \nprivacy of U.S.-person information and warrant additional minimization protections. \nE.  NSA's Retention of Technical Information \nNSA's current minimization procedures have special retention rules for \"technical data \nbase information,\" which is defined as \"information\" - apparently of any type - that is \"retained \nfor cryptanalytic, traffic analytic, or signal exploitation purposes.\"  2018 NSA Minimization \nProcedures Â§ 3(j).  What constitutes a cryptanalytic, traffic-analytic or signal-exploitation \npurpose is not further described.  Under the current procedures, a five-year retention period \ngenerally applies to foreign communications of or concerning U.S. persons.  Id. Â§ 7(a).  But NSA \nTOP S\"@ft@,if;i;'SI0OD@8f Ji1Pf8F8NT  Page 49 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 49 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nI bl SECRRT;; :n,' etteeru,o,ottJ( \nmay retain such communications \"if necessary for the maintenance of technical data bases,\" \nwhich the Court understands to mean necessary for one of the purposes identified above, as long \nas necessary \"to allow a thorough exploitation and to permit access to data that are, or are \nreasonably believed likely to become, relevant to a current or future foreign intelligence \nrequirement,\" which may be for longer than five years.  Id. Â§ 7(a)(l).  And while NSA is \ngenerally required to destroy domestic communications promptly upon recognition, id. Â§ 6, they \nmay be retained as long as necessary \"to allow a thorough exploitation and to permit access to \ndata that is, or is reasonably believed likely to become, relevant to a current or future foreign \nintelligence requirement,\" provided that the Director, Operations Directorate, NSA makes a \nspecific written determination that the communications are \"reasonably believed to contain \ntechnical data base information\" and that the sender or intended recipient of the communications \nwas properly targeted under Section 702.  Id. Â§ 6(3).  (A foreign communication is \"a \ncommunication that has at least one communicant outside of the United States\"; all other \ncommunications are domestic communications.  Id. Â§ 3(e).) \nThe government reports: \nNSA  undertook  an  examination  of its  holdings  and  determined  that the  only \ninformation which  it  is  potentially  currently retaining  as  \"technical  data  base \ninformation\" is information that is encrypted or reasonably believed to contain secret \nmeaning,  or technical  information (e.g.,  encryption algorithms,  keys,  credential \nrecords) that has  previously been addressed in various compliance notices and \nupdates to the Court regarding NSA 's modernization of its cryptographic systems. \nAs described previously to the Court, such technical information does not include the \nunderlying communications originally containing such information. \nf Sf 31!! @Rl!!,;i;iQl;lji QA fHJ If IJf QF  ON f  Page 50 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 50 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\n101' SELREl)}Sf})QRLOMNOFUMQ \nSeptember 17, 2019, Memorandum, at 30 (footnote omitted).  Accordingly, the proposed NSA \nprocedures dispense with the term \"technical data base information\" and include narrower \nretention provisions for information needed for decryption and decipherment efforts. \nWith regard to foreign communications of or concerning United States persons, NSA may \nretain infonnation \"that reasonably appears to be encrypted or to contain secret meaning for a \nsufficient duration to permit exploitation.\"  2019 NSA Minimization ProceduresÂ§ 7(a)(l)a. \nOnce the information is decrypted or deciphered, the general five-year retention period is \ncalculated  \"from the date of decryption or decipher.\"  Id.  NSA may also retain \"technical \ninformation (e.g. encryption algorithms, keys, credentials) contained in, or derived from/' such \ncommunications \"for any period of time during which such information is used for cryptanalysis \nor processing information into intelligible form.\"  Id. Â§ 7(a).  Technical information to be \nretained under this provision \"does not include the underlying communications\" from which the \ntechnical infotmation was derived.  See September 17, 2019, Memorandum, at 30.  It is possible \nthat such technical infonnation could be used for other purposes \nany use or dissemination of such information is \"in accordance with the requirements in these \nprocedures.\"  2019 NSA Minimization ProceduresÂ§ 7(a). \nWith regard to domestic communications, the proposed procedures do not include any \nprovisions for exempting information from the generally applicablerequirement to destroy such \ncommunications upon recognition because it is useful in decryption and decipherment efforts. \nSee September 17, 2019, Memorandum, at 32. \nifi8P BE8Hifi;f;'.81:VOH00Jf:if fOFOHJf  Page 51 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 51 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOP SFGPFT11ST1f2PGONNPFOPN \nBecause these new provisions clarify and narrow the circumstances in which NSA may \nretain information for certain purposes, they present no difficulty in finding that the proposed \nNSA minimization procedures comport with statutory and Fourth Amendment requirements. \nF.  NSA's Retention of Information Regarding Communications~Security \nVulnerabilities \nThe current procedures provide that NSA may retain a domestic communication, \nnotwithstanding the prompt-destruction requirement that generally applies to such \ncommunications, if the Director of NSA makes a specific written detennination that the sender or \nintended recipient of the communication was properly targeted and the communication is \n\"necessary to understand or assess a communications security vulnerability.\"  2018 NSA \nMinimization Procedures Â§ 6(3).  The proposed procedures clarify that the communications \nsecurity vulnerability must be \"of a United States Government or National Security system\" and \nthat the doliiestic communication and, if applicable, the transaction in which it is contained may \nbe retained while the infonnation \"is of use in identifying or defending against such a \nvulnerability.\"  2019 NSA Minimization Procedures Â§ 6(3).  NSA may also disseminate the \ninformation to the FBI or other parts of the U.S. government.  The Court understands that \ndisseminations under this provision must be for the same purpose, and with that understanding, it \nfinds the revised provision to be reasonable. \nG.  NCTC Procedures Re2arding Automated Translation Assistance from CIA \nThe current NCTC minimization procedures pennit NCTC to provide unminimized \ninformation to another federal agency when, \"because of [its] technical or linguistic content, \n[such infonnation] may require further analysis\" by the recipient agency \"to assist NCTC in \nâ€¢ or .till IE aw ::Si'.

Relying on that access \nrestriction and the government's representations, the Court concludes that the five-year retention_ \nperiod does not preclude a finding that the proposed NCTC minimization procedures satisfy the \ndefinition of \"minimization procedures.\"  It views Section D.5.f as a narrow exception to the \ngeneral rule that agencies providing technical or linguistic assistance should not retain \nunminimized data after that assistance has been completed.  If the government seeks additional \nexceptions, the Court expects to scrutinize closely the need for longer retention in other contexts. \nH.  Other Provisions \nThe Court has examined the following provisions, as revised in the proposed \nminimization procedures, and concludes that they are consistent with finding that the proposed \nprocedures satisfy the applicable definition of \"minimization procedures.\" \n1.  Retention of U.S.-Person Information by the CIA \nUnder both its current and proposed minimization procedures, the CIA may generally \nretain unminimized information that may contain U.S.-person information for five years.

Section 3 of \nthe proposed procedures is revised to omit reference to \"outside of access-controlled \nrepositories,\" 2018 CIA Minimization Procedures Â§ 3, so that its retention requirements \nunambiguously apply to retention in any form.  The government advises that the revisions are \nalso intended to clarify that those requirements apply \"to both the communication of a United \nStates person and information concerning a United States person in any communication.\" \nSeptember 17, 2019, Memorandum, at 32-33. \n2.  Court Notification Requirements \nEach agency's minimization procedures contain provisions under which a high-level \nofficial, upon making a specified determination, can approve actions that contravene otherwise \napplicable minimization requirements, such as retaining information that otherwise would have \nto be destroyed.  In the proposed procedures, a number of such provisions have been revised to \nrequire the government to report such approvals to the Court.  See 2019 NSA Minimization \nProcedures Â§ 6 (retention and handling of domestic communications); id, Â§ 7(a)(l) (retention of \nforeign communications of or concerning United States persons beyond five years); 2019 FBI \nMinimization Procedures Â§ III.D.4.b (retention of unreviewed information in electronic and data \nstorage systems beyond five years); id.

Such reporting should better enable the \nCourt to ensure that the agencies are implementing those provisions reasonably. \n3.  Loss or Abandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status \nA lawful permanent resident (LPR) of the United States is a U.S. person for purposes of \nSection 702.  See 50 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 180l(i), 1881a(a).  The NSA, FBI, NCTC, and CIA minimization \nprocedures now provide that a determination that a person has lost or abandoned LPR status, and \ntherefore is no longer a U.S. person, may be made in one of two ways: (a) in consultation with \nthe agency's Office of General Counsel and based on either a court order revoking the person's \nU.S. person status or an official abandonment of LPR status executed by the person and filed \nwith the U.S. Customs Citizenship and Immigration Services; or (b) in consultation with the \nagency's OGC and the National Security Division of the Department ofJustice.  See 2019 NSA \nMinimization Procedures Â§ 3(j)(3); 2019 FBI Minimization Procedures Â§ I.D; 2019 NCTC \nMinimization Procedures Â§ A.4.c; 2019 CIA Minimization Procedures Â§ l .d(3 ).  Parallel changes \nare made to the agencies' respective querying procedures, see 2019 NSA Querying Procedures Â§ \nIII.B.3; 2019 FBI Querying ProceduresÂ§ 111.B.3; 2019 CIA Querying ProceduresÂ§ 111.B.3; 2019 \nNCTC Querying Procedures Â§ 111.B .3, and the NSA' s targeting procedures, see 2019 NSA \nTargeting Procedures Â§ I at 4.  The Court regards these changes as an improvement because they \nrequire an appropriate level of scrutiny for these consequential determinations. \nl30iR fiilFCRJi'T11SWOPCONNOFORN  Page 56 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 56 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\n'f6P SIBCRIBTh'Slh'ORCON11NOfilORN \nI.  Conclusion \nFor the reasons stated above and in the Court's opinions in the Prior 702 Dockets, the \nCourt concludes that, as written, the proposed minimization procedures for the FBI, NSA, CIA, \nand NCTC, in conjunction with the querying procedures for those agencies, satisfy the definition \nof minimization procedures at 50 U.S.C. Â§ 1801 (h); and that those querying procedures satisfy \nthe requirements of Section 702(Â£)(1). \nV.  FOURTH AMENDMENT REQUIREMENTS \nThe Court must also assess whether the proposed targeting, minimization, a11d querying \nprocedures are consistent with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.  SeeÂ§ 702U)(3)(A). \nThat Amendment states: \nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, \nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants \nshall  issue,  but  upon  probable  cause,  supported  by  Oath  or affirmation,  and \nparticularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to  be \nseized. \n\"The touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness.\"  In re Certified Question \nof Law, 858 F.3d 591,604 (FISA Ct. Rev. 2016) (per curiam) (\"In re Certified Question\"). \nAlthough \"[t]he warrant requirement is generally a tolerable proxy for 'reasonableness' when the \ngovernment is seeking to unearth evidence of criminal wrongdoing, ... it fails properly to \nbalance the interests at stake when the government is instead seeking to preserve and protect the \nnation's security from foreign threat.\"  Id. at 593.

Rev. \n2008) (\"In re Directives\").  The FISC has repeatedly reached the same conclusion regarding \nÂ· Section 702 acquisitions.  See, e.g .. Docket Nos. \nMem. Op. and Order, Nov. 6, 2015, at 36-37 (\"November 6, 2015, Opinion\"); September 4, \n2008, Opinion at 34-36. \nIn prior reviews of Section 702 procedures, the Court has assessed the reasonableness of \nthe government's procedures as a whole.  See, e.g., November 6, 2015, Opinion at 39 (assessing \n\"the combined effect\" of the targeting and minimization procedures ); October 18, 2018, Opinion \nat 85-88 ( declining invitation of amici curiae to conduct Fourth Amendment evaluation of \nquerying practices in isolation ).  Restrictions on how the government targets acquisitions under \nSection 702 aqd how it handles information post-acquisition limit the degree of intrusion on \nindividual privacy interests protected by the Fourth Amendment.  For reasons explained above, \nthe Court has found that the proposed targeting procedures, as written, are reasonably designed to \nlimit acquisitions to targeted persons reasonably believed to be non-United States persons located \noutside the United States.  The Fomth Amendment does not protect the privacy interests of such \npersons.  See, e.g., November 6, 2015, Opinion at 38; September 4, 2008, Opinion at 37 (citing \nUnited States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 274-75 (1990)). \nTo the extent U.S.-person information is acquired under Section 702 - ~' when a \ncommunication between a U.S. person and a Section 702 target is intercepted - the government \ncan reduce the intrusiveness of the acquisition for Fourth Amendment purposes by restricting use \nor disclosure of such information.  See In re Certified Question at 609.  The FISC has previously \nI Ci i!ll!@M11Wl!llf:10Rf!!Of f:'.Jf 8Jil01Vf  Page 58 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 58 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nIOP SELREl}}SfoURLUlMâ—„OfilbltHI \nfound that \"earlier versions of the various agencies' targeting and minimization procedures \nadequately protected the substantial Fourth Amendment interests that are implicated by the \nacquisition of communications of such United States persons.\"  November 6, 2015, Opinion at \n38-39 (citing Docket Nos. \nAugust 26, 2014 (\"August 26, 2014, Opinion\");  and \nMem. Op., Aug. 30, 2013, at 6-11 (\"August 30, 2013, Opinion\")).  Specifically, \n'\"the combined effect of these procedures\"' was \"'to substantially reduce the risk that non-target \ninfom1ation concerning United States persons or persons inside the United States will be used or \ndisseminated' and to ensure that 'non-target information that is subject to protection under FISA \nor the Fomth Amendment is not retained any longer than is reasonably necessary.\"'  November \n6, 2015, Opinion at 39 ( citing August 26, 2014, Opinion at 40). \nThe Comt takes all of these factors into account in assessing the reasonableness of the \nprocedures under the Fourth Amendment.  Under the applicable totality-of-circumstances \napproach, it must balance \"'the degree to which [governmental action] intmdes upon an \nindividual's privacy\"' against \"'the degree to which it is needed for the promotion oflegitimate \ngovernmental interests.'\" In re Certified Question, 858 F.3d at 604-05 (quoting Wyoming v. \nHoughton, 526 U.S. 295,300 (1999)).  \"The more important the government's interest, the \ngreater the intrusion that may be constitutionally tolerated.\"  In re Directives, 55 1 F .3d at 1012. \nThe Court regards the privacy interests at stake in Section 702 acquisition as substantial. \nThe government tasks a large number of selectors used by non-U.S. persons for acquisition under \nSection 702.  See, e.g., DNI Statistical Transparency Report Regarding Use of National Security \nTSE RFSPET'.'.SI'.'.OPGOll'.llOFOPN  Page 59 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 59 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOR SFCPFTUSV(ORCDNO>IOFORN \nAuthorities (April 2019), at 13 (reporting an estimated amount of over 164,000 Section 702 \ntargets in 2018).  Although not separately quantified, there is presumably a substantial amount of \ninformation of or concerning United States persons acquired under Section 702, as described \nabove. \nOn the other side of the constitutional balance, acquiring \"foreign intelligence with an eye \ntoward safeguarding the nation's security serves ... a particularly intense interest.\"  In re \nCertified Question, 858 F.3d at 606 (internal quotation marks omitted).  For that reason, the \nFISCR has observed that ''the government's investigative interest in cases arising under FISA is \nat the highest level and weighs heavily in the constitutional balancing process.\"  Id. at 608. \nMeasures to protect individual privacy can be decisive in the proper balancing of these \ninterests: \nIf the protections that are in place for individual privacy interests are sufficient in \nlight of the governmental interest at stake, the constitutional scales will tilt in favor \nof upholding  the  government's  actions.  If,  however,  those  protections  are \ninsufficient to alleviate the risks of government error and abuse, the scales will tip \ntoward a finding of unconstitutionality. \nIn re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1012. \nIn this case, the Court has carefully considered how the proposed procedures seek to \nprotect private U.S.-person infonnation from misuse. \nThe Cow-t concludes that, in combination, the proposed targeting, minimization, and \nquerying procedures will adequately guard against error and abuse, taking into account the \nindividual and governmental interests at stake.  It therefore finds that those procedures, as \n'fO  P Â§l]l CRE'f//81//0R COJtV:Pi OFOlti>l  Page 60 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 60 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nIf8P 0O@ltO1fi;l;01X81t@8H'MOFOilUf \n1\nwritten, are consistent with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.  The Court next \nconsiders questions of implementation. \nVI.  IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLIANCE ISSUES \nFISC review of the sufficiency of Section 702 procedures is not limited to the procedures \nas written, but also encompasses how they are implemented.  See, e.g., October 18, 2018, \nOpinion at 68.  It is appropriate, accordingly, to examine significant issues regarding such \nimplementation. \nA.  FBI Querying Issues \nFBI querying practices raise significant questions regarding (1) recordkeeping and \ndocumentation requirements for use of U.S.-person query terms; (2) the substantive standard for \nconducting queries; and (3) queries that are designed to retrieve or in fact retrieve evidence of a \ncrime that is not foreign-intelligence information. \nl.  Recordkeeping and Documentation Requirements for U.S.-Person \nQuery Terms \nRecordkeeping and documentation requirements for the FBI's use of U.S.-person query \nterms have been extensively considered in prior proceedings, as briefly summarized below. \n.  In October 2018, the Court found two deficiencies regarding the FBI's procedures as then \nproposed: \n(1) the querying procedures were inconsistent with Section 702(f)(l)(B) because they did \nnot require the FBI to keep records that identify which terms used to query unminimized \nSection 702 information are United States-person query terms, see October 18, 2018, \nOpinion at 52-62, 133; and \n(2) the minimization procedures and querying procedures were inconsistent with the \nrequirements of Section 702(e) and Section 702(f)(l)(A), respectively, and also with \nIll Ullâ– IIIISl'.ISGS??Il?J?F?P?I  Page 61 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 61 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\n'i'OP liiitil iellliiT ViilHQE GODUtIQFOPN \nFourth Amendment requirements, because they did not require adequate documentation \nof the justifications for queries that use United States-person query terms. Id. at 13 3-34. \nThe second finding of deficiency rested substantially on the prevalence of queries that did not \nmeet the substantive standard for the FBI to query unminimized Section 702 infonnation.  The \nBureau's procedures authorized such queries if they were reasonably likely to return foreign \nintelligence information or evidence of a crime.  Id. at 66-67.  In practice, however, the FBI \nconducted a large number of suspicionless queries that did not meet that standard, some of which \ninvolved a large number of U.S.-person query terms.  Id. at 68-72. \nUpon appeal by the government, the FISCR affirmed this Court's finding that the \nquerying procedures were inconsistent with the recordkeeping requirement of Section \n702(f)(l)(B).  See In re DNVAG Certifications at 4-5, 22-38, 42-43.  The FISCR did not decide \nwhether the FBI's procedures were deficient for the second reason identified by the FISC.  See \nid. at 38, 43. \nIn response to the FISCR's affirmance, the government amended the FBI's querying \nprocedures.  This Court approved those amendments on September 4, 2019.  See Docket Nos. \nem. Op. and Order, Sept. 4, 2019, at 16-17 \nC'September 4, 2019, Opinion\").  The amended querying procedures require the FBI: \n(1) to keep records that identify which terms used to query unminimized Section 702 \ninformation are U.S.-person query terms, id. at 7-8, and \n(2) to document in writing why a query involving a U.S.-person query term satisfies the \nquerying standard before accessing the contents of communications retrieved by the query \n( except for queries that are subject to Section 702(Â£)(2), which is discussed at pages 69-73 \ninfra.).  Id.  at 8-9.  (This documentation requirement adopts a recommendation made by \namici curiae.

See Â§ 702(f)(3)(A); 18 U.S.C. Â§ 2510(8).  In its October 18, \n2018, Opinion, the Court directed the government ''to describe the types of information acquired \nby the FBI under Section 702 that the government regards as [non-contents] metadata.\"  October \n18, 2018, Opinion at 114.  The government's response described, among other things, the FBI's \ncurrent practices of treating certain  as contents information.  See Gov't \nResponse to the Court's Oct. 18, 2018, Order and Motion for Extension of Time, Feb. 1, 2019, at \n10-18.  The Court's approval of the FBI' s querying and minimization procedures relies on those \ndescriptions, and the Court expects the FBI to implement those procedures in accordance with \nthem. \nWhen it submitted the amended procedures, the government reported that the FBI could \nnot immediately comply with the new recordkeeping and documentation requirements and \nproposed a timetable for their full implementation, including the requisite training of FBI \npersonnel.  See September 4, 2019, Opinion at 10-16.  For the systems primarily used by the FBI \nto query unminimized Section 702-acquired information -\n- the FBI expected to have completed \nnecessary training and systems modifications, which will support the generation of the required \nrecords, by mid-December 2019.

See \nSeptember 4, 2019, Opinion at 14-15, 17.  The government has filed two such reports.  See 45-\nDay Report Regarding the FBI's Implementation of the FBl's Section 702 Que1ying Procedures, \nSept. 26, 2019 (\"45-Day Report, September 26, 2019) and 45-Day Report, November 8, 2019. \nThey advise that the training efforts, as well as the systems modifications  fo \nare on schedule.  When FBI pers01mel seek to run a query of unminimized Section 702 \ninformation on the modified systems, they will first be required to state whether the query \ninvolves a U.S.-person or presumed U.S.-person query term.  If it does, they must record why it \nmeets the querying standard before they can access any Section 702-acquired contents returned \nby the query.  See 45-Day Report, September 26, 2019, at 9-13.

Violations of the Querying Standard \nIt must be noted, however, that there still appear to be widespread violations of the \nquerying standard by the FBI.Â· For example, NSD's oversight review of the Bureau's \nin June 2019 revealed queries of unminimized Section 702 information that \nwere not reasonably likely to retrieve foreign-intelligence information or evidence of crime, \nincluding: \n'FOP SECRE'fHSli'i'ORCO~,'JiJOFOR'\\I  Page 65 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 65 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nqueries to vet a potential source; \nâ€¢  queries to vet a candidate to become a local police officer; and \nâ€¢  queries to find information related to a planned visi  by foreign \ngovernment officials. \nNotice of compliance incidents regarding the FBI's  uerying of raw \nFISA-acquired information, Sept. 18, 2019, at 2-3. \nintelligence information or evidence of a crime, including: \nâ€¢  queries of college students participating in a \"Collegiate Academy\"; and \nqueries of individuals who had visited the FBI office (~, for maintenance). \nNotice of compliance incidents regarding the FBI'  uerying of raw FISA-\nacquired information, Sept. 6, 2019, at 1-2. \nAdditional improper queries include: \nÂ·  otential sour  nd to get \nqueries \nconducted queries using a complainant's identifying \ndata; \nidentifiers of individuals \nonducted queries using identifiers of police officer \nI bl SELi& I)) Bf)) Olt@l'H f;ff8P8ftif f  Page 66 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 66 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\n101  SECRÂ£1))31))0RCOIC)l40fibl6C \nQuarterly Report to the FISC Concerning Compliance Matters Under Section 702, Sept. 20, 2019 \n(\"September 2019 Quarterly Report\"), at 115-117, 1 l 9-122. \nMost recently, the government has reported that, in August 2019, \nuery unminimized Section 702 information using the identifiers for \napproximately 16,000 persons who \nNotice of compliance incidents regarding the FBI' \nacquired information, Nov. 25, 2019, at 2.

Apart from the seven individuals referenced above, there was no indication that \nas involved in criminal activity or foreign intelli \nother reason to believe that running queries using identifiers for  ould return \nil'OP 013 elll1!lfll1%11Jl:';!OllwOJl:!ltIOFOllll  Page 67 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 67 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\n't'8f 812CH't'h'Olh'81tC8N,~il8ifOIOi \nforeign-intelligence information or evidence of a crime.  There is no relevant distinction between \nqueries and other broad, suspicionless queries previously identified by the \ngovernment and the Com1 as violations of the querying standard.  See October 18, 2018, Opinion \nat 68-69. \nThe Court has previously assessed that requiring FBI personnel to document why a query \ninvolving a U.S.-person query term is reasonably likely to have returned foreign-intelligence \ninformation or evidence of crime before examining contents returned by the query should \"help \nensure that FBI personnel ... have thought about the querying standard and articulated why they \nbelieve it has been met\" and prompt them \"to recall and apply the guidance and training they \nhave received on the querying standard.\"  See id. at 93; see also In re DNI/AG Certifications at \n41 (that requirement may \"motivate FBI personnel to carefully consider ... whether a query \nsatisfies\" the standard).  The recently reported querying violations suggest that some FBI \npersonnel still need such help.  That is not altogether surprising.  As discussed above, the FBI is \nreally just sta11ing to implement that documentation requirement on a comprehensive basis.  For \nthat reason, the improper queries described above do not undermine the Court's prior \ndetermination that, with that requirement, the FBI's querying and minimization procedures meet \nstatutory and Fourth Amendment requirements. \nA number of violations apparently result, moreover, from the failure of FBI personnel to \nopt out of querying raw FISA-acquired information when they did not intend to query it.

See 45-Day Report, \nNovember 8, 2019, at 2-3.  Such modifications provide additional reason to expect improvement \nin the FBl's compliance with the querying standard. \n3.  Evidence-of-Crime Queries \nSection 702(f)(2)(A) requires the FBI (not other agencies) in specified circumstances to \nobtain a FISC order before accessing the contents of unminimized Section 702 information. \nSpecifically, that requirement applies only to contents retrieved by a query involving a US. \nperson query term, where the query is made \"in connection with a predicated criminal \ninvestigation ... that does not relate to the national security\" and is \"not designed to find and \nextract foreign intelligence information.\" Id.  To issue such an order, a FISC judge must find \nprobable cause to believe that the contents in question would provide evidence of criminal \nactivity, contraband or the fruits or instrumentalities of crime.  See Section 702(f)(2)(C)(ii), (D). \nThe FBI need not obtain a Court order if it \"determines there is a reasonable belief' that the \ncontents sought \"could assist in mitigating or eliminating a threat to life or serious bodily harm.\" \nSection 702(f)(2)(E). \nThe government has never applied to the FISC for an order under Section 702(f)(2), but \nFBI personnel have violated Section 702(Â£)(2) by accessing Section 702-acquired contents \nreturned by a query under circumstances in which they were required to first obtain such an \norder.  Some violations resulted in part from the manner in which FBI systems displayed \nI Of SELKE f ))Â§l))Uktbh)ICUf!Utc4  Page 69 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 69 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nI OP SELKE I 11SIJJ ORLOtâ€¢i râ€¢oPOM, \ninformation in response to queries.

In \nsome cases, moreover, FBI personnel are known to have taken further steps in response to such \ndisplays(~, opening \"products\" containing contents returned by a query), thereby accessing \nSection 702-acquired contents beyond what was  initially displayed to them.

Given how the manner in which FBI systems \ndisplayed query results contributed to the reported violations, it is likely that similar violations of \nSection 702(f)(2  have occuned across the Bureau.  It is therefore important that the systems \nmodifications to  are also designed to facilitate compliance with Section \n702(f)(2).  Users of those systems who state that a query involves a U.S.-person or presumed \nU.S.â€¢person query term will be required to state whether the query is being conducted in \nconnection with a predicated criminal investigation that is unrelated to national security.  If so, \nthe system will prevent access to responsive Section 702â€¢acquired contents unless the user states \nthat either a FISC order has been obtained or the contents could assist in mitigating or \neliminating a threat to life or serious bodily harm such that an order is not required under Section \n702(f)(2)(E).

Id. at 9 n.6; see also 45-Day \nReport, November 8, 2019, at 4-5 (FBI users required to complete mandatory training via FBI's \nVirtual Academy by December 13, 2019). \nIn view of the government's efforts to improve compliance with Section 702(f)(2), the \nComt is prepared to approve the FBI's querying procedures.  It intends, however, to monitor \ncompliance with Section 702(f)(2) closely. \nRelatedly, the government seeks relief from a reporting requirement that has been in \neffect since November 2015.  The October 18, 2018, Opinion carried it forward as follows: \nThe government shall promptly submit in writing a report concerning each instance \nin which FBI personnel receive and review Section 702-acquired information that the \nFBI identifies as con~erning a United States person in response to a query that is not \ndesigned to find and extract foreign-intelligence information.  The report should \ninclude a detailed description of the information at issue and the manner in which it \nhas been or will be used for analytical, investigative, or evidentiary purposes. It shall \nalso identify the query terms used to elicit the information and provide the FBI's \nbasis for concluding that the query was consistent with applicable minimization \nprocedures. The government need not file such a report for a query for which it files \nan application with the FISC pursuant to Section 702(f)(2). \nOctober 18, 2018, Opinion at 136.  This reporting requirement was first imposed because a prior \nFISC opinion relied on the government's representation that \"queries designed to elicit evidence \nof crimes unrelated to foreign intelligence rarely, if ever, produce responsive results from the \nI Ci  3L@!Rf9 ill Qt;HJR00Uif fBPQRf f  Page 71 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 71 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nSf 8 P 013 OR:IJ'F1!1!6l1!;'Qft6QN,li>JQliaQU N \nSection 702-acquired data,\" and the Court sought reassurance that its \"risk assessment is valid.\" \nNovember 6, 2015, Opinion at 44. \nThe government has not reported such instances in timely fashion.  Rather, they have \nbeen reported to the Court belatedly, usually after they were uncovered during oversight reviews. \nThe government now seeks relief from this reporting requirement \"because the requirements in \nSection 702(f)(2) are a sufficient mechanism for the Court to assess the risk that the results of a \nquery designed to elicit evidence of crimes unrelated to foreign intelligence will be viewed or \notherwise used in connection with an investigation that is unrelated to national security.\" \nOctober 4, 2019, Request at 8.  But it would be premature to regard the government's \nimplementation of Section 702(f)(2) as a sufficient source of information.  As discussed above, \nthe FBI has repeatedly accessed Section 702-acquired contents under circumstances requiring a \nFISC order under Section 702(Â£)(2), but has never applied for such an order. \nCloser to the mark is the government's contention that implementing both Section \n702(f)(2) and the November 2015 rep01iing requirement could complicate training and systems \ndesign.  See October 4, 2019, Request at 8-9.  For example, Section 702(f)(2) looks to whether a \nquery involves a U.S.-person query term, while the applicability of the November 2015 reporting \nrequirement depends on whether U.S.-person information is retrieved.  And Section 702(f)(2) is \nimplicated only when contents are accessed, while the November 2015 reporting requirement \nÂ· does not distinguish between contents and non-contents information. \nThe Court has decided to retain a reporting requirement separate from Section 702(f)(2) \nbecause the obligation to get a FISC order under that section is limited to queries conducted in \nTOP ~~CliH!::T//~1:','0aCOJ>I~OWRN  Page 72 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 72 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\n101 SECREIJH!H11UReon;no,om, \nthe context of a predicated criminal investigation.  The FBI conducts numerous queries of \nSection 702 information at earlier investigative stages.  See October 18, 2018, Opinion at 75. \nReports about queries at those stages remain relevant to the Court's interest in receiving \ninformation about the extent to which U.S.-person privacy interests are implicated by queries that \nare not designed to find and extract foreign-intelligence information.  The Court has concluded, \nhowever, that it is appropriate to modify the prior reporting requirement so that it will focus on \nthe use of U.S.-person query terms, rather than on whether U.S.-person information is accessed \nas a result of a query, and will be triggered only when contents information is accessed.  Such \nmodifications should make it considerably simpler for the government to implement the \nrequirement in combination with Section 702(f)(2), while still requiring reporting in situations \nwhere Fourth Amendment concerns are likely to be implicated.  See October 18, 2018, Opinion \nat 93 (queries that use U.S.-person query terms and result in review of contents are \"the subset of \nqueries that are particularly likely to result in significant intrusion into U.S. persons' privacy\"). \nB.  NSA Querying Issues \nNSA 's procedures require that every query \"must be reasonably likely to retrieve foreign \nintelligence information.\"  2018 NSA Querying Procedures Â§ IV.A.  In a Notice filed on October \n10, 2019, the government reported that, in November 2018, NSA ran a series of queries using \nU.S.-person identifiers associated with \nNotice of Compliance Incident regarding Section 702 Metadata \nTOil iii '11Wi a; 4fiel:4'0Q'10tl {l)JQEOP N  Page 73 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 73 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nTOI i]IM~lfflTH':]100ftC@UVN8f181UJ \nQueries Conducted by the NSA, Oct. 10, 2019, at 2 (\"October 10, 2019, Notice\").  NSD, after \nreviewing these queries as apaii of routine oversight, reported: \nAlthough  the  NSA  anal  who  ran  the  queries  were  searching  for  possible \nconnections between  nd international terrorist or  anizations due to the \nattenuation between  queried,  nd the \nforeign intelligence information sought, the November  me a  a a queries were \nnot reasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence infonnation and did not meet the \nrequirements of the NSA Querying Procedures. \nId. at 3.  In a separate incident that was reported by the analyst involved, NSA queried Section \n702-acquired content information using twenty-three U.S.-person identifiers that were \ndetermined not to meet the querying standard because they  were too attenuated from the foreign \nintelligence they were intended to return.  See Notice of Compliance Incidents Regarding \nImproper Queries, Nov. 13, 2019, at 2.  The queries did not return any PISA results.  Id.  In both \ncases, the personnel involved received instruction on Section 702 querying requirements.  Id.; \nOctober 10, 2019, Notice at 3.  The Court will continue to monitor closely the manner in which \nU.S.-person identifiers are used by all relevant agencies to query Section 702-acquired \ninformation. \nC.  Failure to Purge Recalled Reports \nThe government has reported incidents of non-compliance resulting from NCTC's failure \nto purge its copies of NSA reports, which NSA had recalled for FISA-compliance reasons.  See \nPreliminary Notice of Compliance Incident Regarding Incomplete Purges of Data Acquired \nPursuant to the PISA, March 13, 2019; Supplemental Notice of Compliance Incident Regarding \nIncomplete Purges of Data Acquired Pursuant to the PISA, September 17, 2019 (\"September 17, \n2019, Supplemental Notice\").

See September 17, 2019, Supplemental Notice, at 2.  Intelligence \nCommunity (IC) agencies sometimes recall reports for reasons unrelated to FISA compliance -\n~. inaccurate information included in the report, changed analysis, or typographical mistakes. \nIn July 2019, ODNI sent a data call to the IC \"to identify if other agencies are similarly \nimpacted by this issue and how each agency handles recalled and revised NSA reports.\"  Id. \nPending the results of the data call, the government ceased all remedial measures with respect to \nNCTC systems.  Id.  By order dated October 3, 2019, the Court directed the government to \nprovide the results of the ODNI data call and describe how each IC agency is handling any \nimproperly retained reports or, if the results of the ODNI data call are pending at the time of \nsubmission, to provide updated information and a proposed timetable for completion.  See Order, \nOct. 3, 2019, at 3.  The government's responsive submission outlined IC policy on revising or \nrecalling intelligence products and assessed that the CIA, NSA, and NCTC may be retaining \ncopies of reports which had been recalled for FISA compliance reasons.  See [Corrected] Report \nin Response to the Court's Order Dated October 3, 2019, Nov. 13, 2019, at 8.  Specifically, \nrecalled reports can still be viewed on some NCTC systems, NSA does not delete recalled reports \nfrom all of its data stores, and the CIA does not purge recalled reports from its systems because \nthe recall does not specify whether the report contains information subject to purge.  Id. at 5-8. \nThe government describes as \"[ o] ne potential solution\" a requirement for \"issuing \nagencies to specifically identify when reports are recalled due to FISA compliance reasons,'' \n161  DL@llb ll)Sl!I Gii@Gli!li 21 Sidi  Page 75 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 75 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nwhich reportedly would require the DNI \"to revise current policy.\"  Id. at 8.  Although \"ODNI \nand the IC agencies are exploring possible changes to the reports recall process that would \ninvolve a change in policy, ... there is no estimated time line for resolution of this matter.\" Id. at \n8-9. \nThe agency that is recalling a report knows whether it is being recalled for a FISA \ncompliance reason.  It appears to the Court that a substantial improvement would be for the \nrecalling agency, when applicable, to communicate to recipient agencies that a report is being \nrecalled for a FISA-compliance reason and to request that they take steps to remove it from their \nsystems and prevent its use or disclosure.  The Comi is directing the government to submit a \nwritten report by February 28, 2020, specifying, as applicable: (1) steps taken or to be taken by \nthe FBI, NSA, CIA, and NCTC to identify to recipient agencies when reports are recalled for a \nFISA-compliance reason; (2) other steps the government has taken or will take to improve \nprocesses for identifying and removing reports that are recalled for FJSA-compliance reasons; \nand (3) an anticipated timetable for completing any steps that remain to be taken. \nD.  NSA Pnrt:e Backlo2 \nThe October 18, 2018, Opinion discussed NSA' s backlog of purge-discovery orders, \nwhich had resulted in significant delays in placing infonnation acquired pursuant to Section 702 \non NSA's Master Purge List.  See October 18, 2018, Opinion at 128-30.  NSA had eliminated \nthis backlog by the time that Opinion was issued, but had not yet provided to the Court a \nproposed standard for determining whether a backlog emerges in the future.  Id. at 130.  On \nFebruary 26, 2019, after reviewing the government's proposal in that regard, the Court issued an \nTtJP s~:e:Mrf;';'.Stfi'OR@8HJ'N8F8Df f  Page 76 \nAuthorized for Public Release on Date:  September 4, 2020 Page 76 of 83 FISC Opinion, Dec. 6, 2019\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2019 Certification Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nIb  f Sklkkl ))Â§f))bltlbit)f(bflbldC \nOrder directing it to continue-to take specified steps to ensure that information subject to purge is \nnot included in a FISA application; report to the Court if there is a significant and persistent \ndelay in NSA's purge process; and submit quarterly reports that assess the timeliness ofNSA's \npurge process.  See  rder, In re NSA's Purge Discovery Backlog for \nInforn1ation Acquired Pursuant to FISA, Feb. 26, 20 I 9.  The quarterly reports filed to date \nindicate that NSA 's purge process has been operating in a timely manner.  See Docket No. \novemment's First Quarterly Report in Response to the Court's Order of February 26; \n2019, June 6, 2019; Docket No  ovemment's Second Quarterly Report in Response to \nthe Court's Order of February 26, 2019, Nov. 22, 2019. \nE.  Other Incidents of Non-Compliance \nThe government has identified a number of other incidents of noncompliance since the \nOctober 18, 2018, Opinion.  For example, NSA sometimes has tasked selectors for acquisition \nwithout properly implementing the pre-tasking requirements of its targeting procedures.  See, \n~. September 2019 Qua1ierly Report at 6-32.  In other instances, an agency failed to timely \ndetask selectors when required to do so under applicable targeting procedures, for reasons such \nas human error, communication failures among agencies, and misunderstanding of the \nprocedures.  See, e.g., id. at 33-73.  There have also been cases in which the FBI did not properly \nestablish a review-team process to protect attorney-client communications after a Section 702 \ntarget had been charged with a federal crime.  See Supplemental Notice of Compliance Incident \nRegarding Implementation of the Review Team Requirements in the FBI's FISA Minimization \nProcedures, Sept. 3 0, 2019.

These minimization procedures apply in addition to \nseparate querying procedures adopted pursuant to subsection 702(f)(l) of the Act.  These \nminimization procedures should be read and applied in conjunction with those querying \nprocedures, and nothing in these procedures permits any actions that would otherwise be \nprohibited by those querying procedures. \n(U)  If NSA determines that it must take action in apparent departure from these \nminimization procedures to protect against an immediate threat to human life (e.g., force \nprotection or hostage situations) and that it is not feasible to obtain a timely modification of \nthese procedures, NSA may take such action immediately.  NSA will report the action taken \nto the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and to the National Security Division of \nthe Department of Justice, which will promptly notify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt (FISC) of such activity. \n(U)  For the purposes of these procedures, the terms \"National Security Agency\" and \"NSA \npersonnel\" refer to any employees of the National Security Agency/Central Security Service \n(\"NSNCSS\" or \"NSA\") and any other personnel engaged in Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) \noperations authorized pursuant to section 702 of the Act if such operations are executed \nunder the direction, authority, or control of the Director, NSNChief, CSS (DIRNSA). \n(U)  Section 2 - Exceptions, Oversight, and Training \n(a)  (U)  NSA will conduct oversight (to include compliance) activities on an ongoing basis, \nwith respect to its exercise of the authority under section 702 of the Act, including the \ntargeting, minimization, and querying procedures adopted in accordance with section 702. \nNSA will develop and deliver training regarding the applicable procedures to ensure NSA \npersonnel responsible for approving the targeting of persons for acquisition under section \n702, as well as NSA personnel with access to information thereby acquired, understand \ntheir responsibilities and the applicable procedures that apply to this acquisition.
