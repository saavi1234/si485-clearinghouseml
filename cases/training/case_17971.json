    "summary": "<p>This class action relates to an immigration detainee's access to bond hearings under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)(8 U.S.C. Ch. 12) when that person has been placed in withholding-only proceedings, which happen when an Immigration Judge (IJ) or asylum officer determines that the petitioner has a reasonable fear of persecution/torture if they are deported.</p>\r\n<p>Petitioners were all individually removed from the United States following deportation orders. Each petitioner received death threats upon returning to their native countries, prompting them to return illegally to the US. Upon returning, the petitioners were detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at Immigration Centers of America Farmfille in Virginia and were placed in withholding-only proceedings. The plaintiffs were represented by the Legal Aid Justice Center. The case was filed on December 7, 2017, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, with Judge Leonie M. Brinkema presiding. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241, the petitioners filed a habeas corpus petition seeking class certification and an order directing the Attorney General (then Jeff Sessions) and the Field Office Director for ICE to grant the plaintiffs bond hearings.</p>\r\n<p>On January 12, 2018, the petitioners filed a motion for summary judgment. The government filed a cross motion for summary judgment on February 2. In a memorandum opinion from February 26, 2018, Judge Brinkema granted the petitioner&rsquo;s motion for summary judgement on the grounds that the petitioners had been detained under &sect; 1226(a) of the INA and that such detainees were entitled to bond hearings. Judge Brinkema also certified the class of petitioners and denied the government&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment. 297 F.Supp.3d 618.</p>\r\n<p>The government appealed the District Court summary judgment order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on April 19, 2018. The Fourth Circuit consolidated this appeal with an appeal from a very similar case, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17970\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> Romero v. Evans</em></a>. On October 10, 2019, the Fourth Circuit affirmed the lower court rulings in both cases and ruled in favor of the petitioners. 940 F.3d 867.</p>\r\n<p>The government petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari on January 21, 2020. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on June 15, 2020 and designated the case <em>Johnson v. Guzman Chavez</em>. 141 S.Ct. 107.</p>\r\n<p>On June 29, 2021, the Supreme Court reversed the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and ruled in favor of the government. First, the Court held that &sect;1231 of the INA is the provision which applies to immigration detainees who sought to withhold removal proceedings based on fear of persecution if deported. Second, the Court held that &sect;1231 of the INA doesn&rsquo;t allow individualized bond hearings, and that therefore, the petitioners in this case were not entitled to such hearings. 141 S.Ct. 2271.</p>\r\n<p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling in favor of the government effectively ended the case.</p>",

ICE placed each of the petitioners in withholding-only proceedings after finding that their fear of bodily harm or death if deported was reasonable. The petitioners filed a petition for habeas corpus on December 7, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The petitioners argued they were being held pursuant to §1226 of the Immigration and Nationality Act and thus were entitled to individualized bond hearings. On February 26, 2018, Judge Brinkema of the Eastern District granted class certification and summary judgment in favor of the petitioners. The government appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. On October 10, 2019, the Fourth Circuit affirmed the lower court ruling. The government then appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari in June of 2020. On June 29, 2021, the Supreme Court reversed the lower courts, found in favor of the government, and ruled that the petitioners were covered by §1231 of the INA, not §1226, and therefore were not entitled to individualized bond hearings.

Those sections are followed by § 1225,  bond hearing as permitted by § 1231. \nwhich  provides  instructions  for  inspecting  the  aliens,    \nexpediting  removal  of  certain  “arriving  aliens,”  and \nreferring  others  for  a  removal  hearing.  Next,  §  1226  All Citations \nconcerns  the  “[a]pprehension  and  detention  of  aliens” \nwho are still “pending a decision on whether the alien is  940 F.3d 867 \nto be removed from the United States.” § 1226(a). It is not   \nuntil three statutory provisions later, in § 1229, that the \nAct *888 explains the structure of the alien’s removal \nFootnotes \n \n1  We use “withholding-only” proceedings and “withholding of removal” to encompass three distinct forms of relief: \n  persecution-based withholding of removal under the INA, see 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b); torture-based withholding of \nremoval under the Convention Against Torture, see id. § 1208.16(c); and torture-based deferral of removal under \nthe Convention, see id. § 1208.17. The details of these forms of relief vary, but not in ways material to the issues \nbefore us. \n \n2  The district court issued a separate decision on the second petition before it, relying on its reasoning in Romero. See \n  Diaz v. Hott, 297 F. Supp. 3d 618 (E.D. Va. 2018). Both those decisions are before us now on appeal. Because the \ndistrict court first spelled out its analysis in Romero, we focus on that decision here. \n \n3  Specifically, § 1226(a) provides in relevant part: \n \n(a) Arrest, detention, and release \nOn a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an alien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on \nwhether the alien is to be removed from the United States. Except as provided in subsection (c) [“Detention of \ncriminal aliens”] and pending such decision, the Attorney General— \n \n\n \n(1) may continue to detain the arrested alien; and \n(2) may release the alien on— \n(A) bond of at least $1,500 with security approved by, and containing conditions prescribed by, the Attorney \nGeneral; or \n(B) conditional parole .... \n8 U.S.C. § 1226(a). \n \n4  The removal period may be extended beyond 90 days in certain cases involving a noncitizen’s refusal to cooperate \n  with efforts to arrange for removal. See 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(C). There is no indication that this exception applies \nhere, and the government has not argued otherwise. Accordingly, we refer throughout to a 90-day removal period. \n \n5  The full text of the relevant portion of § 1231 provides: \n \n(a) Detention, release, and removal of aliens ordered removed \n(1) Removal period \n(A) In general \nExcept as otherwise provided in this section, when an alien is ordered removed, the Attorney General shall \nremove the alien from the United States within a period of 90 days (in this section referred to as the “removal \nperiod”). \n(B) Beginning of period \nThe removal period begins on the latest of the following: \n(i) The date the order of removal becomes administratively final. \n(ii) If the removal order is judicially reviewed and if a court orders a stay of the removal of the alien, the date of \nthe court’s final order. \n(iii) If the alien is detained or confined (except under an immigration process), the date the alien is released \nfrom detention or confinement. \n8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(A)–(B). \n \n6  The dissent suggests that the petitioners may have been detained under a different portion of § 1231(a)(6), \n  providing for discretionary detention of noncitizens “inadmissible under section 1182.” Section 1182(a)(9), to which \nthe dissent points, governs certain noncitizens previously removed who “seek[ ] admission” to the United States. 8 \nU.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(A)(i)-(ii). It is not clear to us that this provision applies to noncitizens in withholding-only \nproceedings, who may not seek any substantive change in their immigration status but only “protection from having \n[a prior removal order] executed to a particular country,” Romero, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 843. In any event, there is no \ndispute that all post-removal-period detention under § 1231(a)(6), whatever the precise basis, is discretionary and \nnot mandatory. \n \n\n \n \n7  Even under § 1231, however, there is an agency process to ensure compliance with the due process rights of \n  noncitizens, providing for conditional release when “there is no significant likelihood of removal” in the “reasonably \nforeseeable future.” 8 C.F.R. § 241.13(a); see also Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491 (“[A]n alien may be held \nin confinement until it has been determined that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably \nforeseeable future.”). The petitioners here have not raised Zadvydas-based claims. \n \n8  Before the district court, the government argued that the petitioners are subject to mandatory detention under 8 \n  U.S.C. § 1231. But if, as the government also contends, each petitioner’s 90-day removal period was triggered upon \nreinstatement of her removal order, then that removal period has come and gone, and with it, § 1231(a)(2)’s \nmandatory detention provision. Accordingly, we understand the government’s current position to be that the \npetitioners are detained under  §  1231(a)(6), which  makes detention discretionary  but does not provide for \nindividualized hearings. Though the government was unable to clarify this point at argument, it pointed to no other \nsource of authority for the petitioners’ detention once the 90-day removal period has expired. \n \n9  Given the restrictions on third-country removal, that is not surprising. Other courts have suggested that noncitizens \n  who prevail in withholding-only proceedings are only very rarely removed to third countries. See Kumarasamy v. \nAtt’y Gen. of U.S., 453 F.3d 169, 171 n.1 (3d Cir. 2006). \n \n10  The dissent, unlike the government, does suggest that a reinstated removal order becomes “final” for purposes of \n  judicial review under § 1252 before withholding-only proceedings conclude, which presumably would render the \nwithholding-only determination nonreviewable. But as the district court explained, Mejia v. Sessions, 866 F.3d 573 \n(4th Cir. 2017), on which the dissent relies, applied § 1252’s finality provision and time bar to an underlying removal \norder, not to a withholding-only determination. Romero, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 847 n.23; see Mejia, 866 F.3d at 588-89 \n(declining to “allow[ ] a challenge to an underlying removal order any time a reinstated order is issued”). Mejia did \nnot address finality in the context of a challenge to withholding-only proceedings, and so had no occasion to \nconsider the line of cases described above. Without more, we do not read Mejia as putting us in conflict with the \ncircuits  that  have  held,  in  agreement  with  the  government,  that  when  a  noncitizen  seeks  review  of  a \nwithholding-only determination, the reinstated order of removal is not “final” for purposes of appellate review until \nwithholding-only proceedings are completed. \n \n11  The government also argues that the petitioners’ reinstated removal orders are “administratively final” under § \n  1231(a)(1)(B)(i), triggering the 90-day removal period, by virtue of the INA’s definitions provision, which makes a \nremoval order “final” when it is affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals or the time for such review has \npassed. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(47)(B). But as even one court that otherwise agreed with the government has \nexplained, that general definition has “limited utility in the context of reinstated removal orders” because the \nunderlying removal order in most circumstances may not be reviewed by the Board of Immigration Appeals. \nPadilla-Ramirez, 882 F.3d at 831; see also Luna-Garcia, 777 F.3d at 1185. And because the same definition applies \nequally to the judicial review provision at § 1252 as it does to § 1231, one position that § 1101(a)(47)(B) clearly \ncannot support is the government’s: that finality means something different under those two provisions. \n \n12  The government also argues that this question was resolved by Zadvydas v. Davis, in which the Supreme Court \n  addressed a challenge to indefinite post-removal-period detention under § 1231(a)(6). 533 U.S. at 682, 121 S.Ct. \n2491. In that case, the parties assumed, and the Court did not question, that § 1231(a)(6) governed the post-90-day \n \n\n \ndetention of two noncitizens who had yet to be removed because their designated countries of removal (as well as \nalternative third countries) refused to accept them. Id. at 684–86, 121 S.Ct. 2491. But unlike the petitioners here, \nthose detainees never challenged their designated countries of removal, and never were placed in withholding-only \nproceedings; as a result, there never was any question that the government had the actual legal authority to remove \nthem. Zadvydas, in other  words, does not implicate the withholding-only proceedings and persecution- and \ntorture-based restrictions on removal that are at the heart of this appeal. \n \n1  Section 1231(a)(1)(C)’s language suggests that seeking withholding of removal qualifies as an “act[ ] to prevent the \n  alien’s removal,” which would extend the removal period. The parties have not argued this issue, and it is left for a \nfuture case. \n \n2  Mejia was an alien with a prior order of removal reinstated under § 1231(a)(5). Mejia, 866 F.3d at 577. She then \n  applied for asylum and withholding of removal and was placed in withholding-only proceedings. Id. at 578. The \nimmigration judge granted her withholding of removal but rejected her asylum claim. Id. Mejia sought review of \nboth her asylum claim and her challenge to the validity of her removal order based on defects in the underlying \nremoval order. Id. at 576. As for the latter, the Court found that it had no jurisdiction to consider this issue because \nMejia did not timely file her challenge. Id. at 588. Mejia urged the Court to read “§ 1252(b)(1)’s deadline to refer to \nthe date on which the reinstated order of removal—not the original order—becomes final.” Id. at 589. But the Court \nheld that “the 30-day deadline runs from the date an original order of removal becomes final.” Id. As this Court \nexplained, it is “feasible that an individual removed to her home country could illegally re-enter the United States, \nhave the original removal order reinstated by DHS, and petition for review—all within a month’s time.” Id. at 590. \nThus, the Court’s holding did not abolish “review of all underlying orders in reinstatement.” Id. (citations and \nemphasis omitted). There could be judicial review if the alien petitioned for review no more than thirty days from \nthe date the original order of removal became final. \n \n \n \n \n ",

A memorandum opin-\nion of the district court (App., infra, 45a-72a) is pub-\nlished in the Federal Supplement at 280 F. Supp. 3d 835. \nAn additional memorandum opinion of the district court \n(App., infra, 73a-91a) is published in the Federal Sup-\nplement at 297 F. Supp. 3d 618.  \n(1) \n\n2 \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nOctober 10, 2019.  On December 30, 2019, the Chief Jus-\ntice extended the time within which to file a petition for \na writ of certiorari to and including February 7, 2020.  \nThe jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in the \nappendix to this petition.  App., infra, 92a-100a.   \nSTATEMENT \n1.  The  Immigration  and  Nationality  Act  (INA),  \n8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., provides that, when the Depart-\nment of Homeland Security (DHS) finds that an alien \nhas illegally reentered the United States after having \nbeen removed, “the prior order of removal is reinstated \nfrom its original date.”  8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(5).  The rein-\nstated order “is not subject to being reopened or re-\nviewed”; the alien “is not eligible and may not apply for \nany relief ” from the order; and the government may re-\nmove the alien under the order “at any time after the \nreentry.”  Ibid.   \nNotwithstanding those general restrictions, an alien \nsubject to a reinstated removal order may seek with-\nholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. 1231(b)(3) and with-\nholding  and  deferral  of  removal  under  regulations \npromulgated pursuant to Section 2242(b) of the Foreign \nAffairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub. L. \nNo. 105-277, Div. G, 112 Stat. 2681-822, to implement \nthe  United  States’  obligations  under  the  Convention \nAgainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrad-\ning Treatment or Punishment, adopted Dec. 10, 1984,  \nS. Treaty Doc. No. 20, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. (1988),  \n \n\n3 \n1465 U.N.T.S. 85.  Those forms of protection ensure \nthat aliens are not removed to places where they face \npersecution  or  torture.    See  8  U.S.C.  1231(b)(3)(A);  \n8  U.S.C.  1231  note;  Fernandez-Vargas  v.  Gonzales,  \n548 U.S. 30, 35 n.4 (2006).  A grant of withholding or \ndeferral of removal provides country-specific protec-\ntion; it precludes the government from returning the al-\nien to the country of risk, but leaves the final order of \nremoval undisturbed and leaves the government free  \nto remove the alien to another country.  See 8 U.S.C. \n1231(b)(2)(E);  8  C.F.R.  1208.16(f ),  1208.17(f );  In  re  \nI-S- & C-S-, 24 I. & N. Dec. 432, 433 (B.I.A 2008).   \nIf an alien with a reinstated order of removal ex-\npresses a fear of returning to the country of removal, an \nasylum  officer,  subject  to  review  by  an  immigration \njudge, interviews the alien to determine whether he has \na “reasonable fear” of persecution or torture.  8 C.F.R. \n208.31(b) and (f ).  If that initial screening process re-\nveals no reasonable fear, DHS may remove the alien \nwithout  further  administrative  review.    8  C.F.R. \n208.31(g)(1).  But if the alien establishes a reasonable \nfear  in  the  screening  process,  the  alien  is  placed  in \n“withholding-only” proceedings before an immigration \njudge, with a right of appeal to the Board of Immigra-\ntion Appeals, to determine the ultimate merits of the \nclaim for relief.  8 C.F.R. 208.16, 1208.16. \n2.  This case involves a dispute over whether an alien \nplaced in withholding-only proceedings is subject to the \ndetention procedures set out in 8 U.S.C. 1231, or instead \nto the detention procedures set out in 8 U.S.C. 1226.  \nSection 1231 authorizes the detention of an alien who “is \nordered removed.”  8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(1)(A).  It provides \nthat the government “shall” detain the alien during an \n \n\n4 \ninitial 90-day “removal period,” and that the govern-\nment “may” detain the alien beyond that initial period \nif the alien poses a “risk to the community” or is “un-\nlikely to comply with the order of removal.”  8 U.S.C. \n1231(a)(6).  This Court has held that discretionary de-\ntention beyond the initial 90-day period may last only \nfor “a period reasonably necessary to bring about that \nalien’s removal from the United States.”  Zadvydas v. \nDavis, 533 U.S. 678, 689 (2001).  The Court has recog-\nnized that a six-month period is presumptively reason-\nable; after that time, detention may continue only “until \nit has been determined that there is no significant like-\nlihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.”  \nId. at 701.  Under the applicable regulations, an alien \nmay obtain administrative review to determine whether \nthere is a significant likelihood of removal in the reason-\nably foreseeable future.  8 C.F.R. 241.13. \nSection 1226(a), meanwhile, authorizes the detention \nof an alien “pending a decision on whether the alien is \nto  be  removed  from  the  United  States.”    8  U.S.C. \n1226(a).  In general, the statute expressly authorizes \nthe government, in its discretion, to “release the alien” \non “bond” or “conditional parole.”  8 U.S.C. 1226(a)(2).  \nUnder the applicable regulations, immigration officials \nmake the initial determination whether to release the \nalien on bond, but an alien may seek a redetermination \nbefore an immigration judge.  8 C.F.R. 236.1(c)-(d).  \n3.  Each respondent is an alien who was previously \nremoved from the United States under an order of re-\nmoval.  App., infra, 6a-7a.  Each illegally reentered the \nUnited States.  Id. at 7a.  Each was apprehended by the \ngovernment, and each had the prior removal order re-\ninstated.  Ibid.  Each then expressed a fear of persecu-\ntion or torture in his or her native country.  Ibid.  In \n \n\n5 \neach case, the asylum officer found, after an initial in-\nterview, that the alien had a reasonable fear of persecu-\ntion or torture in his or her native country.  Ibid.  As a \nresult, each respondent was placed in withholding-only \nproceedings before an immigration judge.  Ibid.  “[A]ll \nultimately were detained by the government.”  Ibid.  \nEach respondent sought an individualized bond deter-\nmination before an immigration judge under Section \n1226(a), but the government denied such a determina-\ntion on the ground that respondents’ detentions were \ninstead governed by Section 1231. Ibid. \nRespondents filed two separate cases—Romero v. \nEvans, No. 17-cv-754 (E.D. Va. June 29, 2017), and Diaz \nv.  Hott,  No.  17-cv-1405  (E.D.  Va.  Dec.  7,  2017)— \nchallenging the government’s decisions.  App., infra, 8a \n& n.2.  In both cases, respondents sought writs of ha-\nbeas corpus, declarations that Section 1226 rather than \nSection 1231 governed their detention, and injunctions \nrequiring  individualized  bond  determinations  con-\nsistent with Section 1226.  Id. at 8a.  In Diaz, the district \ncourt certified a Virginia-wide class of aliens detained \nduring withholding-only proceedings.  Ibid. \nThe district court awarded summary judgment to \nthe Romero respondents in November 2017 and to the \nDiaz respondents in February 2018.  App., infra, 45a-\n72a, 73a-91a.  In Romero, the court stated that this case \n“presents a difficult question of statutory interpreta-\ntion” and that the government’s arguments “have some \nforce.”  Id. at 65a, 71a.  The court concluded, however, \nthat Section 1226 rather than Section 1231 governs re-\nspondents’ detention.  Id. at 65a-71a.  The court ob-\nserved that Section 1226 governs the detention of an al-\nien “detained pending a decision on whether the alien is \n \n\n6 \nto be removed from the United States.”  Id. at 66a (quot-\ning 8 U.S.C. 1226(a)).  The court reasoned that, “until \nthe government determines that there is a country to \nwhich [respondents] can legally be removed, the deci-\nsion on whether they are ‘to be removed’ remains ‘pend-\ning.’ ”  Ibid.  The court adopted similar reasoning in \nDiaz.  Id. at 73a-91a.  \n4.  The court of appeals consolidated Romero and \nDiaz.  See App., infra, 11a.  A divided court affirmed, \nholding that the detention of an alien in withholding-\nonly proceedings is governed by Section 1226 rather \nthan Section 1231.  See id. at 1a-44a.  \nThe  court  of  appeals  began  by  analyzing  Section \n1226, which authorizes detention “pending a decision on \nwhether the alien is to be removed from the United \nStates.”  App., infra, 18a.  The court read Section 1226 \n“to focus on” the “practical question whether the gov-\nernment has the authority to execute a removal,” rather \nthan on “ ‘whether the alien is theoretically  remova-\nble.’ ”  Id. at 18a-19a (citation omitted).  The court rea-\nsoned that, although an alien in withholding-only pro-\nceedings is “clearly removable,” the “practical” decision \nwhether that alien “ ‘is to be removed’ ” remains pend-\ning.  Id. at 19a (citations omitted).    \nThe  court  of  appeals  then  concluded  that  Section \n1231 confirmed that reading.  App., infra, 19a.  The \ncourt observed that Section 1231’s detention provisions \nare triggered “only when the ‘removal period’ begins.”  \nIbid. (quoting 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(2)).  The court stated \nthat the removal period “does not begin until the gov-\nernment  has  the  actual  legal  authority  to  remove  a \nnoncitizen from the country.”  Ibid.  The court further \n \n\n7 \nstated  that, “until  withholding-only proceedings  con-\nclude, the removal period has not begun and § 1231’s \ndetention provisions do not apply.”  Id. at 22a.   \nJudge Richardson dissented.  App., infra, 33a-44a. \nHe concluded that “[b]oth the plain language and the \nstructure of the Immigration and Nationality Act com-\npel the conclusion that § 1231, not § 1226, governs the \ndetention of aliens with reinstated orders of removal.”  \nId.  at  33a.    He  observed  that  “Section  1231  applies \n‘when an alien is ordered removed.’ ”  Id. at 44a.  He ex-\nplained that, because respondents’ prior orders of re-\nmoval had been “ ‘reinstated,’ ” and because those re-\nmoval orders are “ ‘not subject to being reopened,’ ” re-\nspondents  “have,  once  and  for  all,  been  ordered  re-\nmoved.”  Id. at 33a-34a.  He further explained that the \nwithholding-only proceedings do not change that analy-\nsis, because “withholding does not address whether an \nalien is ordered removed—that has already been deter-\nmined.  It only addresses how, and more specifically \nwhere, the removal will occur.”  Id. at 36a.  \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe court of appeals held that the detention of an al-\nien who is subject to a reinstated order of removal, and \nwho has been placed in withholding-only proceedings, is \ngoverned by 8 U.S.C. 1226 rather than 8 U.S.C. 1231.  \nThe court’s decision misconstrues both Section 1226 and \nSection 1231.  The court’s decision also deepens a circuit \nconflict:  The Second and now the Fourth Circuits have \nheld that Section 1226 governs the detention of an alien \nin withholding-only proceedings, while the Third and \nNinth Circuits have held that Section 1231 does so.  This \nCourt’s review is warranted. \n \n\n8 \nA.  The Court Of Appeals’ Decision Is Incorrect \nThe court of appeals erred in holding that Section \n1226, rather than Section 1231, governs the detention of \nan alien in withholding-only proceedings.   \n1.  Section 1226 governs the detention of aliens who \nare awaiting a decision on whether they will be ordered \nremoved from the United States.  By contrast, Section \n1231, with limited exceptions inapplicable here, governs \nthe detention of aliens who, like respondents here, have \nalready been ordered removed from the United States.    \nThat conclusion follows from the plain terms of the \nstatutory provisions.  Section 1226 authorizes the de-\ntention of an alien “pending a decision on whether the \nalien is to be removed from the United States.”  8 U.S.C. \n1226(a).  “The term ‘pending’ means ‘remaining unde-\ncided; awaiting decision.’ ”  Kellogg Brown & Root Servs., \nInc. v. United States ex rel. Carter, 135 S. Ct. 1970, 1978 \n(2015) (brackets and citation omitted).  Section 1226 \nthus applies to an alien who is awaiting a decision on \nwhether he will be ordered removed from the United \nStates.  \nSection 1231 takes over once an order of removal is \nin place.  Section 1231(a)’s caption reads:  “Detention, \nrelease,  and  removal  of  aliens  ordered  removed.”   \n8 U.S.C. 1231(a) (capitalization and emphasis altered).  \nSection 1231 states that, “when an alien is ordered re-\nmoved,”  the  government  must  remove  that  alien.   \n8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added).  Section 1231 \ndirects  the  Attorney  General  (now  the  Secretary  of \nHomeland Security1) to remove the alien within a pe-\nriod of 90 days, termed the “removal period.”  Ibid.  The \n                                                      \n1  Congress has transferred from the Attorney General to the Sec-\nretary of Homeland Security the enforcement of the INA, but the \n \n\n9 \nremoval period begins on “[t]he date the order of re-\nmoval becomes administratively final” (subject to ex-\nceptions for cases where the removal is stayed or where \nthe alien is detained for other reasons, such as when \nserving a criminal sentence).  8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(1)(B)(i) \n(emphasis added).  Finally, Section 1231 provides that \nthe Secretary “shall detain” the alien during the re-\nmoval period, 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(2), and that the alien \n“may be detained” beyond the removal period if the al-\nien has been determined by the Secretary to be a risk \nto the community or unlikely to comply with the order \nof removal.  8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(6).  \n2.  An alien who is subject to a reinstated order of \nremoval is subject to detention under Section 1231, not \nSection 1226.  The INA provides that, for such an alien, \n“the prior order of removal is reinstated from its origi-\nnal date”; the order “is not subject to being reopened or \nreviewed”; and the government may remove the alien \nunder  the  order  “at  any  time  after  the  reentry.”   \n8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(5).  Because the prior order of removal \nhas been “reinstated,” ibid. the alien has been “ordered \nremoved” within the meaning of Section 1231.  And be-\ncause the order “is not subject to being reopened or re-\nviewed,” 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(5), a decision on whether the \nalien is to be removed is in no sense “pending” within \nthe meaning of Section 1226.  The decision has already \nbeen made.   \nThe statutory structure confirms that reading.  The \nprovision authorizing the reinstatement of a removal or-\nder itself appears in Section 1231, see 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(5) \n                                                      \nAttorney General retains authority over the administration of re-\nmoval proceedings under 8 U.S.C. 1229a and questions of law.  See, \ne.g., 6 U.S.C. 202(3), 251, 271(b), 542 note, 557; 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(1) \nand (g), 1551 note.  \n \n\n10 \n—suggesting that an alien subject to such an order is \nsubject to the procedures set out in the nearby provi-\nsions of Section 1231.  In addition, as Judge Richardson \nobserved, Section 1226 and Section 1231 both appear in \na part of the INA entitled “Inspection, Apprehension, \nExamination, Exclusion, and Removal.”  App., infra, \n43a.  “As the title implies, this part provides a timeline \nof events that spans eleven statutory provisions from  \n§ 1221 to § 1232.”  Ibid.  Sections 1221 to 1224 address \nthe arrival of aliens.  Ibid.  Section 1225 addresses the \ninspection of arriving aliens.  Ibid.  Next, Section 1226 \naddresses the detention of aliens pending a decision on \nremoval.  Id. at 43a-44a.  Section 1229 sets forth the \nstructure of the alien’s removal proceedings; Section \n1230 explains what happens if the alien is admitted; and \nSection 1231 explains what happens if the alien is or-\ndered removed.  Id. at 44a.  “This series of events re-\nflects that, once the alien has been ordered removed \nfrom the United States in a removal proceeding under \n§  1229a  and  that  order  has  been  reinstated  under  \n§ 1231(a)(5), the alien cannot go back in time, so to \nspeak, to § 1226.”  Ibid.   \nThe alien’s placement in withholding-only proceed-\nings does not change that textual and structural analy-\nsis.  As Judge Richardson explained, “[a] withholding \nproceeding permits an alien to seek protection from be-\ning removed to a particular country,” but it does not \npermit the alien to “attack a reinstated order requiring \nremoval from the United States.”  App., infra, 36a.  “In \nother words, withholding does not address whether an \nalien is ordered removed—that has already been deter-\nmined.  It only addresses how, and more specifically \nwhere, the removal will occur.”  Ibid.  Even if such with-\nholding-only  proceedings  remain  ongoing—indeed, \n \n\n11 \neven if the alien succeeds in obtaining withholding—the \ngovernment remains free to remove the alien to any \ncountry apart from the country of risk.  See p. 3, supra.  \nAs a result, an alien in withholding-only proceedings \nhas still been “ordered removed.”  8 U.S.C. 1231(a).  The \n“decision on whether the alien is to be removed” is no \nlonger “pending.”  8 U.S.C. 1226(a) (emphasis added).   \n3.  The court of appeals’ contrary analysis is flawed.  \nThe court read Section 1226 “to focus on” the “practical \nquestion of whether the government has the authority \nto execute a removal,” rather than on “ ‘whether the al-\nien is theoretically removable.’ ”  App., infra, 18a-19a. \n(citation omitted).  That test lacks a sound basis in the \nstatutory  text.    Section  1226  asks  if  “a  decision  on \nwhether the alien is to be removed” is still “pending”—\nnot whether the government has acquired the “practi-\ncal” ability to remove an alien.  Indeed, the very purpose \nof the removal period under Section 1231 is to enable \nthe government to detain the alien while it resolves \n“practical” questions about when, where, and how to ex-\necute the order of removal.   \nThe  court  of  appeals  also  reasoned  that  Section \n1231’s detention provisions are triggered “only when \nthe ‘removal period’ begins,” and that the removal pe-\nriod, in turn, “does not begin until the government has \nthe actual legal authority to remove a noncitizen from \nthe country.”  App., infra, 19a.  That is incorrect.  “The \nremoval period begins on the latest of the following”:  \n(1) “[t]he date the order of removal becomes adminis-\ntratively final,” (2) “[i]f the removal order is judicially \nreviewed and if a court orders a stay of the removal of \nthe alien, the date of the court’s final order,” and (3) “[i]f \nthe alien is detained or confined” for non-immigration \nreasons, “the date the alien is released from detention \n \n\n12 \nor confinement.”  8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(1)(B).  For each re-\nspondent in this case, the reinstated removal order is \n“administratively final,” 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(1)(B)(i); the \norder “is reinstated from its original date and is not sub-\nject to being reopened or reviewed,” 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(5); \nand respondents have not been detained for non-immi-\ngration reasons.  Under the plain terms of the statute, \nthen, the removal period has begun, and the detention \nprovisions in Section 1231(c)(6) have been triggered.  As \nJudge Richardson explained, the court of appeals’ con-\ntrary analysis of Section 1231 rested on a “sleight of \nhand”—converting  the  three  specific  “triggering \nevents” for the removal period into “some amorphous \nfinal ‘authority’ ” for removal.  App., infra, 41a.   \n4.  Applying Section 1231 to aliens in withholding-\nonly proceedings does not leave them unprotected or \nsubject to indefinite detention.  As an initial matter, \nmandatory detention under Section 1231 lasts only for \n90 days (subject to suspension under certain circum-\nstances).  See 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(1)-(2).  After that period, \ncontinued detention of the alien becomes discretionary.  \nSee 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(6).  Federal regulations set forth a \nframework  for  the  exercise  of  that  discretion.    See  \n8 C.F.R. 241.4.  Under that framework, the relevant \nfield office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforce-\nment (ICE) conducts an initial review at the outset of \nthe discretionary  detention; further periodic  reviews \nare conducted by a review panel at ICE headquarters.  \nSee 8 C.F.R. 241.4(i)(3) and (k)(1)-(2).  During those re-\nviews, officials must decide whether to release or detain \nthe alien on the basis of both “[f ]avorable factors” (such \nas “close relatives residing here lawfully”) and unfavor-\nable factors (such as the likelihood that “the alien is a \n \n\n13 \nsignificant flight risk” or that he would “[e]ngage in fu-\nture criminal activity”).  8 C.F.R. 241.4(f )(5), (7), and \n(8)(iii).  During those reviews, the alien may submit in-\nformation that he believes provides a basis for release; \nmay be assisted by an attorney or other representative; \nand may, if appropriate, seek a government-provided \ntranslator.  8 C.F.R. 241.4(h)(2) and (i)(3).   \nQuite apart from those regulations, this Court held \nin Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001), that Section \n1231 “does not permit indefinite detention.”  Id. at 689.  \nIt concluded that, if detention lasts for more than six \nmonths and “the alien provides good reason to believe \nthat there is no significant likelihood of removal in the \nreasonably foreseeable future, the Government must \nrespond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing.”  \nId. at 701.  Federal regulations set out special review \nprocedures to implement that holding.  See 8 C.F.R. \n241.13.  Under those procedures, an eligible alien “may \nsubmit a written request for release,” together with \n“whatever documentation” he wishes “in support of the \nassertion that there is no significant likelihood of re-\nmoval in the reasonably foreseeable future.”  8 C.F.R. \n241.13(d)(1).  Adjudicators at ICE headquarters must \nthen review the alien’s case, allow the alien to respond \nto the government’s evidence, allow the alien to submit \nadditional relevant evidence, allow the alien to be rep-\nresented by an attorney, and, ultimately, “issue a writ-\nten  decision  based  on  the  administrative  record.”   \n8 C.F.R. 241.13(g); see 8 C.F.R. 241.13(d)-(e).  The reg-\nulations  expressly  provide  that  these  special  review \nprocedures supplement, rather than supplant, the dis-\ncretionary release framework discussed in the preced-\ning paragraph; thus, under that framework, the govern-\n \n\n14 \nment may release an alien “without regard to the likeli-\nhood of the alien’s removal in the reasonably foreseea-\nble future.”  8 C.F.R. 241.13(b).  \nB. The Question Presented Warrants Review \n1.  As a result of the decision below, there is now a 2-\n2 circuit conflict over which statutory provision governs \nthe detention of aliens with reinstated removal orders \nwho are in withholding-only proceedings.  The Second \nCircuit and now the Fourth Circuit have held that Sec-\ntion 1226 governs the detention of such aliens.  See \nGuerra v. Shanahan, 831 F.3d 59 (2d Cir. 2016); App., \ninfra, 31a-32a.  In contrast, the Third and Ninth Cir-\ncuits have both held that Section 1231 governs the de-\ntention of such aliens.  See Guerrero-Sanchez v. War-\nden York County Prison, 905 F.3d 208, 213-219 (3d Cir. \n2018); Padilla-Ramirez v. Bible, 882 F.3d 826, 829-837 \n(9th Cir.), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 411 (2018).  The courts \nof appeals have acknowledged that conflict of authority.  \nSee App., infra, 11a (“The courts of appeals are divided \non this question.”); Guerrero-Sanchez, 905 F.3d at 214 \n(“We note at the outset that this is a question that has \ndivided  our  sister  circuits.”);  Padilla-Ramirez,  882 \nF.3d at 835 (“[W]e respectfully disagree with the Sec-\nond Circuit’s reading of section 1226(a).”). \nThe Third and Ninth Circuits have both held that, \neven under Section 1231, an alien may still be entitled \nto a bond hearing in some circumstances.  See Guerrero- \nSanchez,  905  F.3d  at  219-228;  Diouf  v.  Napolitano,  \n634 F.3d 1081, 1084-1092 (9th Cir. 2011).  As discussed \nbelow, the government is seeking review of that reading \nof Section 1231 in a separate certiorari petition filed \nsimultaneously with this one.  See pp. 16-17, infra.  Ir-\nrespective of those decisions, however, the conflict over \n \n\n15 \nwhether Section 1226 or Section 1231 governs deten-\ntions remains significant.  Each provision triggers a dif-\nferent set of substantive and procedural standards un-\nder the statute and the regulations, and the relevant dif-\nferences go beyond the availability of bond hearings.  \nSee pp. 3-4, 12-14, supra.  In addition, even focusing \nsolely on bond hearings, the source of the government’s \ndetention authority still matters.  An alien detained un-\nder Section 1226 ordinarily may obtain a bond determi-\nnation from an immigration judge “at any time” after \nthe  “initial  custody  determination.”    8  C.F.R. \n236.1(d)(1).  In contrast, the Third and Ninth Circuits \nhave read Section 1231 to require bond determinations \nonly after a “prolonged detention”—which they have \ndefined as a detention lasting “six months.”  Guerrero-\nSanchez, 905 F.3d at 211, 226; see Diouf, 634 F.3d at \n1091-1092.   \n2.  This Court’s review is warranted to resolve that \ncircuit conflict.  The question presented is important.  \nThe United States has an overriding interest in protect-\ning its territorial sovereignty through the use of all the \ntools made available by Congress, including detention \nof aliens, to address and diminish illegal immigration.  \nSee Sale v. Haitian Ctrs. Council, Inc., 509 U.S. 155, \n163 (1993).  The Fourth Circuit’s interpretation compro-\nmises that interest by providing a new mechanism for \naliens in withholding-only proceedings to obtain release \nover DHS’s objection.  Those aliens have been ordered \nremoved from the United States—meaning that they \nwould have a strong incentive to abscond in order to \navoid removal.  And those aliens, by definition, have al-\nready “reentered the United States illegally after hav-\ning been removed,” 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(5)—meaning that \nthey have demonstrated a willingness to evade federal \n \n\n16 \nimmigration law and authorities and a disregard for \ntheir removal orders, and thus present a distinct risk \nthat they will fail to comply with an order of removal.  \nMoreover, ICE would have to identify, track, and re- \napprehend the released aliens, diverting the agency’s \nresources from other immigration enforcement actions.  \nThe question presented also has significant opera-\ntional consequences for the federal government.  DHS \nand the Department of Justice have explained that “the \nU.S. immigration system” already faces an “extraordi-\nnary,” “extreme,” and “unsustainable” administrative \n“strain.”  Asylum Eligibility and Procedural Modifica-\ntions, 84 Fed. Reg. 33,829, 33,831, 33,838, 33,841 (July \n16, 2019).  The Fourth Circuit’s decision adds to those \nadministrative burdens by requiring the government to \naddress the continued detention of aliens such as re-\nspondents  under  Section  1226  rather  than  the  more \nstreamlined procedures of Section 1231.  Further, the \nexistence  of  a circuit  conflict  over  the  question  pre-\nsented itself poses significant operational challenges.  \nAn alien’s illegal reentry, detention, and withholding-\nonly proceedings could each occur in a different circuit.  \nThis Office has been informed by DHS and EOIR that, \nas  a  result,  immigration  officials  and  immigration \njudges now must often resolve complex choice-of-law \nquestions about which circuit’s precedents apply to a \ngiven alien. \nOn  a  number  of  other  occasions,  this  Court  has \ngranted review to address the substantive and proce-\ndural rules that govern the detention of aliens in con-\nnection with their removal from the United States.  See, \ne.g., Nielsen v. Preap, 139 S. Ct. 954 (2019); Jennings v. \nRodriguez,  138  S.  Ct.  830  (2018);  Demore  v.  Kim,  \n \n\n17 \n538 U.S. 510 (2003); Zadvydas, supra.  The same course \nis appropriate here.   \n3.  In addition to warranting review in its own right, \nthe question presented warrants review in connection \nwith the government’s petition for a writ of certiorari in \nAlbence v. Arteaga-Martinez (filed Jan. 17, 2020), which \nthe government is filing simultaneously with the peti-\ntion in this case.  The petition in Arteaga-Martinez pre-\nsents the question whether, when the government de-\ntains an alien for more than six months under Section \n1231, it must provide the alien with a bond hearing at \nwhich the government bears the burden of proving, by \nclear and convincing evidence, that the alien poses a \nrisk of flight or a danger to the community.  As noted \nearlier, the Third and Ninth Circuits have both read \nSection  1231 to  impose  a bond-hearing requirement.  \nSee pp. 14-15, supra.   \nThe  question  presented  in  Arteaga-Martinez  is \nclosely related to the question presented in this case.  \nThis case concerns which aliens Section 1231 covers, \nwhile Arteaga-Martinez concerns what procedures Sec-\ntion 1231 makes available to the aliens covered by that \nprovision.  As a practical matter, the category of people \naffected by this case (aliens with reinstated orders of \nremoval seeking  withholding or  deferral  of  removal) \nsignificantly overlaps with the category of people af-\nfected by Arteaga-Martinez (all aliens who have been \nordered removed and whom the government has de-\ntained for more than six months).  Moreover, the issues \nposed by both cases often come up in tandem.  For in-\nstance,  in  Guerrero-Sanchez,  the  Third  Circuit  held \nthat the detention was governed by Section 1231 (con-\ntributing to the circuit split at issue in this case), but \nalso that Section 1231 contained implicit bond-hearing \n \n\n18 \nand clear-and-convincing-evidence requirements (rais-\ning the question presented in Arteaga-Martinez).  See \n905 F.3d at 213-219.  Because the issues raised in the \ntwo cases are closely related, the government respect-\nfully requests that the Court grant review in this case \nas well as Arteaga-Martinez, and hear the cases in tan-\ndem.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe  petition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari  should  be \ngranted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n  NOEL J.

Brinkema, District Judge.    \n(1:17-cv-01405-LMB-MSN) \n \n \n \n\n3a \n \nAffirmed by published opinion.    Judge Harris wrote \nthe opinion, in which Judge Floyd joined.     \nJudge Richardson wrote a dissenting opinion. \n \nBefore  FLOYD,  HARRIS,  and  RICHARDSON,  Circuit \nJudges. \nPAMELA HARRIS, Circuit Judge:   \n  The petitioners in this case are a class of noncitizens \nsubject to reinstated removal orders, which generally \nare not open to challenge.    The petitioners may, how-\never, pursue withholding of removal if they have a rea-\nsonable fear of persecution or torture in the countries \ndesignated  in  their  removal  orders.    Availing  them-\nselves of that right, these petitioners sought withholding \nof removal, and they are being detained by the govern-\nment while they await the outcome of their “withholding- \nonly” proceedings.    The question before us is whether \nthey have the right to individualized bond hearings that \ncould lead to their release during those proceedings.   \n  Answering that question requires that we determine \nthe statutory authority under which the government de-\ntains noncitizens who seek withholding of removal after \na prior removal order has been reinstated.    The peti-\ntioners  argue  that  their  detention  is  governed  by   \n8 U.S.C. § 1226, which authorizes detention “pending a \ndecision on whether the alien is to be removed,” and \nwould allow them to seek release on bond and to make \ntheir case before an immigration judge.    The govern-\nment, on the other hand, points to 8 U.S.C. § 1231, which \napplies “when an alien is ordered removed”—as the pe-\ntitioners were, the government says, by virtue of their \n \n\n4a \n \nreinstated removal orders—and makes that detention \nmandatory during a 90-day “removal period.”   \n  The district court granted summary judgment to the \npetitioners, holding that they are detained under § 1226 \nbecause a decision on removal remains “pending” until \ntheir withholding-only proceedings are complete.    We \nagree with the district court’s careful analysis of the rel-\nevant statutes and affirm its judgment. \nI. \nA. \n  For context, we begin with a brief description of the \nlaw governing reinstated removal orders and withholding- \nonly proceedings under the Immigration and National-\nity Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.   \n  When a noncitizen who has been ordered removed \nfrom the United States reenters the country without au-\nthorization, the “prior order of removal is reinstated \nfrom its original date.”    Id. § 1231(a)(5).    That rein-\nstated order “is not subject to being reopened or re-\nviewed,” and the noncitizen “may not apply for any re-\nlief” but instead “shall be removed under the prior or-\n \nder.”    Id.    Implementing regulations track the stat-\nute, providing that a noncitizen who unlawfully reenters \nafter a prior removal order “shall be removed from the \nUnited States by reinstating the prior order” without \nany  right  to  a  hearing before  an immigration  judge.     \n8 C.F.R. § 241.8(a).    In the great majority of cases, this \nprocess plays out exactly as contemplated, and a noncit-\nizen facing a reinstated removal order is removed from \nthe country without further legal proceedings.   \n  But there is an exception to that rule, which produces \nthe issue we face today.    Consistent with our country’s \n \n\n5a \n \nobligations under international law, Congress has pro-\nvided that a noncitizen may not be removed to a country \nwhere she would be persecuted—that is, her “life or \nfreedom    .  .  .    threatened”  based  on  a  protected \nground, such as race or religion, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A) \n—or tortured, see 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note (United States \nPolicy With Respect to Involuntary Return of Persons \nin Danger of Subjection to Torture); see also 8 C.F.R.   \n§ 208.16(c) (implementing regulations).    Where an indi-\nvidual meets the high standard for showing that she will \nface persecution or torture in a given country, relief   \nis mandatory, and the government must withhold re-\nmoval to that country.    See Salgado-Sosa v. Sessions, \n882 F.3d 451, 456 (4th Cir. 2018); Dankam v. Gonzales, \n495 F.3d 113, 115-16 (4th Cir. 2007).   \n  Thus, as the district court explained, although a non-\ncitizen “cannot otherwise challenge a reinstated removal \norder, he can seek protection from having that order ex-\necuted to a particular country by initiating a withholding- \nonly proceeding.”    Romero v. Evans, 280 F. Supp. 3d \n835, 843 (E.D. Va. 2017); see Fernandez-Vargas v. Gon-\nzales, 548 U.S. 30, 35 n.4 (2006) (“[E]ven an alien subject \nto [a reinstated removal order] may seek withholding of \nremoval.”).    Those  proceedings  ensure  that  removal \ncomplies with the limited statutory restrictions outlined \nabove; if a claim is successful, it bars the government \nfrom removing an individual only to the specific country \ndesignated in the removal order.    See 8 C.F.R. § 208.31.   \nA grant of withholding of removal with respect to one \ncountry does not preclude the government from remov-\ning a noncitizen to a third country, see id. § 208.16(f), \n \nnor affect a noncitizen’s status as a removable individ-\nual, see id. § 208.2(c)(2)-(3).   \n \n\n6a \n \n  The process works as follows.    When a noncitizen \nsubject to a reinstated removal order expresses a fear of \npersecution  or  torture  in  the  country  designated  on   \nthe order, an asylum officer conducts a screening inter-\nview to make a “reasonable fear” determination.    Id.   \n§ 208.31(b).    If the asylum officer identifies a “reason-\nable possibility” of torture or persecution in the desig-\nnated country, then the noncitizen is permitted to apply \nfor withholding of removal.    See id. § 208.31(c), (e).    At \nthat point, the case goes to an immigration judge for an \nadministrative hearing to determine whether the noncit-\nizen can meet her burden of establishing eligibility for \nwithholding of removal.    Id. § 208.31(e).    The nonciti-\nzen may appeal the immigration judge’s determination \nto  the  Board  of  Immigration  Appeals,  id.,  and  the \nBoard’s decision is subject to judicial review, 8 U.S.C.   \n§ 1252(a)(1), (a)(4).    Throughout, the only issue that \nmay be raised is eligibility for withholding of removal; \nthe underlying (and now reinstated) removal order is not \nsubject  to  collateral  attach  during  these  “withholding- \nonly” proceedings.    See 8 C.F.R. § 208.2(c)(3)(i).1 \nB. \n1. \n  We turn now to the facts underlying this appeal, which \nare similar for each petitioner and may be sketched out \nbriefly.    Each petitioner was removed from the United \n                                                 \n1  We use “withholding-only” proceedings and “withholding of re-\nmoval” to encompass three distinct forms of relief:  persecution-based \nwithholding of removal under the INA, see 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b); \ntorture-based withholding of removal under the Convention Against \nTorture, see id. § 1208.16(c); and torture-based deferral of removal \nunder the Convention, see id. § 1208.17.  The details of these forms \nof relief vary, but not in ways material to the issues before us. \n \n\n7a \n \nStates pursuant to an order of removal.    On their re-\nturn to their designated countries of removal, the peti-\ntioners allege, they were confronted with persecution or \ntorture, or threats of persecution or torture that in sev-\neral cases included death threats.    Fearing for their \nsafety, the petitioners returned to the United States, \nreentering without authorization and despite their prior \nremoval orders. \n  When  the  government  discovered  the  petitioners’ \npresence, their original removal orders were reinstated \nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5).    As noted above, those or-\nders are “not subject to being reopened or reviewed,” \nid., so the petitioners could not challenge their underly-\ning removability.    But they did initiate the withholding- \nonly process by expressing fear of persecution or tor-\nture in their native countries, designated as their coun-\ntries of removal.    In every case, the asylum officer, af-\nter an initial screening interview, found that the peti-\ntioner had a “reasonable fear” of persecution or torture.   \nAccordingly, the petitioners were placed in withholding-\nonly proceedings before immigration judges.     \n  Although some of the petitioners initially were granted \nsupervised release, all ultimately were detained by the \ngovernment. \n2. \n  This case arose out of a dispute over whether the pe-\ntitioners could seek release on bond—and do so in hear-\nings before immigration judges—while their withholding- \nonly proceedings were pending.    The government took \nthe position that they could not, because they were sub-\nject to mandatory detention under 8 U.S.C. § 1231, and \nbond hearings were denied. \n \n\n8a \n \n  Two sets of petitioners then filed habeas petitions in \nthe same district court in Virginia.    Each sought a dec-\nlaration  that  8  U.S.C.  §  1226,  rather  than  8  U.S.C.   \n§ 1231, governs their detention, and an injunction order-\ning individualized bond hearings consistent with § 1226.   \nThe second set of petitioners also moved to certify a   \nVirginia-wide  class  of  individuals  detained  during   \nwithholding-only proceedings.  The district court certified \nthe class, and that decision is unchallenged on appeal. \n  In November 2017, the district court entered sum-\nmary judgment in favor of the first set of petitioners and \nordered the requested relief.    See Romero v. Evans,   \n280 F. Supp. 3d 835 (E.D. Va. 2017).2    The district court \nbegan its merits analysis by identifying the statutory is-\nsue at the heart of this case.    According to the petition-\ners, they were being detained under 8 U.S.C. § 1226, \nwhich  provides  for  detention  “pending  a  decision  on \nwhether the alien is to be removed from the United \nStates” and, critically, allows for discretionary release \non bond.    8 U.S.C. § 1226(a).    But the government \npointed to a different statute—8 U.S.C. § 1231—which \napplies “when an alien is ordered removed” and provides \nfor mandatory detention during a 90-day “removal pe-\nriod” within which the noncitizen “shall” be removed.     \n8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(A), (a)(2).    So the “deceptively \nsimple question” in this case, the court explained, is this:   \nAre the petitioners—subject to reinstated removal or-\nders,  but  with  pending  claims  for  withholding  of   \n                                                 \n2  The district court issued a separate decision on the second peti-\ntion before it, relying on its reasoning in Romero.  See Diaz v. Hott, \n297 F. Supp. 3d 618 (E.D. Va. 2018).  Both those decisions are be-\nfore us now on appeal.  Because the district court first spelled out \nits analysis in Romero, we focus on that decision here. \n \n\n9a \n \nremoval—“detained under 8 U.S.C. § 1226[ ] or under   \n8 U.S.C. § 1231?”    Romero, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 846. \n  The answer, the district court concluded, is § 1226, \nwhich by plain terms covers detention when a “decision \non whether the alien is to be removed from the United \nStates” is “pending.”    Id. (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a)).   \n“[T]his text governs petitioners’ detention because until \nwithholding-only proceedings are complete, a decision \nhas not been made on whether they will in fact be re-\nmoved from the United States.”    Id.    The court recog-\nnized that by virtue of their reinstated removal orders, \nthe petitioners’ “removability” already had been deter-\nmined.    Id.    But the text of § 1226 is concerned with \nthe “more concrete determination whether petitioners \nwill actually be removed,” the court reasoned, and that \ndecision  “remains  ‘pending’”  during  withholding-only \n \nproceedings and “until the government determines that \nthere is a country to which [the] petitioners can legally \nbe removed.”    Id. (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a)). \n  That conclusion, the court went on, is reinforced by \nthe structure of § 1231—the provision mandating deten-\ntion during a 90-day “removal period.”    Under § 1231, \nthe “removal period” begins on the latest of three dates:   \nthe  date  a  removal  order  becomes  “administratively   \nfinal,” the date any judicial stay of a removal order is \nlifted, or the date on which a noncitizen is released from \nnon-immigration detention.    8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(B)(i)-\n(iii); see also Romero, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 846.    Each of \nthose triggers, the court explained, relates to “a differ-\nent legal impediment to actual removal”:    the adminis-\ntrative process is not complete, or a judicial stay pre-\nvents removal, or a noncitizen is in criminal custody and \nso cannot be removed.    Romero, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 846.   \n \n\n10a \n \nUnder § 1231, in other words, it is not enough that the \nagency “may have already determined that the nonciti-\nzen is, like petitioners here, removable.”    Id.    Instead, \n§ 1231 does not come into play until the government has \n“the present and final legal authority to actually execute \nthat order of removal.”    Id. \n  That reading, the court determined, also makes sense \nof the standard 90-day removal period during which the \ngovernment “shall” remove a noncitizen from the coun-\ntry, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(A) (“Except as otherwise pro-\nvided    .  .  .    when an alien is ordered removed, the At-\ntorney General shall remove the alien from the United \nStates within a period of 90 days.”).    Limiting that pe-\nriod to 90 days is reasonable if § 1231 is intended to “gov-\nern only the final logistical period, in which the govern-\nment has actual authority to remove the alien and need \nonly schedule and execute the deportation.”    Romero, \n280 F. Supp. 3d at 846.    Noncitizens like the petitioners \nin  this  case,  on  the  other hand,  are detained  during   \nwithholding-only proceedings that “typically far exceed \n90 days.”    Id. at 847. \n  The court rejected the government’s argument that \na reinstated removal order, because it is “not subject to \nbeing reopened or reviewed,” 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5), is an \n“administratively final” order of removal that triggers   \n§ 1231’s 90-day removal period and mandatory detention \nprovision, see id. § 1231(a)(1)(B)(i) (listing “date the or-\nder of removal becomes administratively final” as poten-\ntial start of removal period).    For purposes of judicial \nreview, the court explained, it is widely accepted that a \nreinstated removal order is not final and reviewable un-\ntil after the adjudication of any withholding applications.   \n \n\n11a \n \nThe court found no reason to adopt a “bifurcated defini-\ntion of finality” that would render the same orders “ad-\nministratively final” under § 1231 before withholding-\nonly proceedings conclude.    Romero, 280 F. Supp. 3d at \n847 (internal quotation marks omitted).    Nor are the \npetitioners’ removal orders “final” under general ad-\nministrative law principles, the court reasoned, because \nthe agency’s “decisionmaking process” has yet to be con-\nsummated while withholding-only proceedings are pend-\ning before an immigration court.    Id. \n  Having concluded that § 1226, rather than § 1231, \nprovides the statutory authority for the petitioners’ de-\ntention, the court granted the petitioners’ requested re-\nlief in two separate decisions, ordering the government \nto provide individualized bond hearings under § 1226.   \nThe government timely appealed both cases, which we \nconsolidated for purposes of appeal. \nII. \n  This appeal requires that we resolve a single question \nof statutory interpretation:    whether § 1226 or § 1231 \ngoverns the petitioners’ detention and, specifically, their \nentitlement to individualized bond hearings.    We re-\nview that legal question de novo.    Stone v. Instrumen-\ntation Lab. Co., 591 F.3d 239, 242-43 (4th Cir. 2009). \n  The courts of appeals are divided on this question.   \nCompare Guerra v. Shanahan, 831 F.3d 59 (2d Cir. 2016) \n(holding that § 1226 applies), with Guerrero-Sanchez v. \nWarden York Cty. Prison, 905 F.3d 208 (3d Cir. 2018), \nand Padilla-Ramirez v. Bible, 882 F.3d 826 (9th Cir. \n2017) (both holding that § 1231 applies).    “The statu-\ntory  scheme  governing  the  [petitioners’]  detention   \n.  .  .    is not a model of clarity,” Prieto-Romero v. Clark, \n \n\n12a \n \n534 F.3d 1053, 1058 (9th Cir. 2008) (analyzing same pro-\nvisions), and as the district court recognized, there are \narguments of at least “some force” on both sides of the \nissue, Romero, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 846.    But reading the \ntwo provisions together, we conclude, like the district \ncourt and the Second Circuit, that it is § 1226 that gov-\nerns the petitioners’ detention, entitling them to bond \nhearings.    Section 1231’s “removal period”—and with \nit,  the  requirement  of  mandatory  detention—begins \nonly when the government acquires the “present and fi-\nnal legal authority” to execute a removal order, id., and \nso long as withholding-only proceedings are pending, \nthe government lacks that authority. \nA. \n  We begin with a description of the two statutory sec-\ntions at issue and, in particular, their provisions regard-\ning release on bond.    Like the parties and the district \ncourt, we have used general terms in framing the ques-\ntion as whether § 1226 or § 1231 applies to the petition-\ners.    But that is shorthand for the parties’ more spe-\ncific dispute:    whether the petitioners are entitled to in-\ndividualized bond hearings before immigration judges, \nwhich might lead to their release during the pendency \nof their withholding-only proceedings.    Our focus here \nis on the provisions bearing directly on that question. \n  Section 1226, as noted above, authorizes the arrest \nand  detention  of  noncitizens  “pending  a  decision  on \nwhether the alien is to be removed from the United \nStates.”    8 U.S.C. § 1226(a).    For certain individuals \nwith  criminal  histories,  that  detention  is  mandatory.   \nSee id. § 1226(c) (providing, with limited exceptions, for \nmandatory detention of noncitizens who have committed \n \n\n13a \n \nspecified criminal offenses).    But for all other nonciti-\nzens, detention under § 1226 is not mandatory; instead, \n§ 1226 permits discretionary release on bond or condi-\ntional parole.    Id. § 1226(a)(1)-(2).3 \n  Agency regulations set out the procedures governing \ndiscretionary  release  under  §  1226.    See  8  C.F.R.   \n§ 236.1.    Most important here, a noncitizen detained \nunder § 1226 is entitled to an individualized hearing be-\nfore an immigration judge to determine whether contin-\nued detention is necessary while immigration proceed-\nings continue.    See id. § 236.1(d)(1).    At that hearing, \nthe noncitizen bears the burden of showing that her re-\nlease would pose no danger to the public and that she is \nlikely to appear for future proceedings.    Id. § 236.1(c)(8).   \nAnd even if she makes that showing, agency officials re-\ntain broad discretion in deciding whether to grant re-\nlease and on what conditions.    See id. \n                                                 \n3 Specifically, § 1226(a) provides in relevant part: \n  (a)  Arrest, detention, and release \nOn a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an alien may be \narrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is \nto be removed from the United States.  Except as provided in \nsubsection (c) [“Detention of criminal aliens”] and pending such \ndecision, the Attorney General— \n    (1)  may continue to detain the arrested alien; and \n    (2)  may release the alien on— \n (A)  bond of at least $1,500 with security approved by, and \ncontaining conditions prescribed by, the Attorney Gen-\neral; or \n (B)  conditional parole.    . . .  \n8 U.S.C. § 1226(a). \n \n\n14a \n \n  Section 1231, on the other hand, authorizes the de-\ntention  of  a  noncitizen  who  “is  ordered  removed,”   \n8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(A), and it makes that detention \nmandatory  during  a  statutory  “removal  period,”  id.   \n§ 1231(a)(2) (“During the removal period, the Attorney \nGeneral  shall  detain  the  alien.”    (emphasis  added)).   \nThe “removal period” is defined as “a period of 90 days” \nduring which “the Attorney General shall remove the al-\nien from the United States.”    Id. § 1231(a)(1)(A) (em-\nphasis added).4    That 90-day window for removal be-\ngins on the latest of three dates:    the date the removal \norder becomes “administratively final”; the date of a re-\nviewing court’s final order, if that court has issued a stay \nof removal; or the date on which a noncitizen subject to \nremoval  is  released  from  non-immigration  detention.   \nId. § 1231(a)(1)(B)(i)-(iii).5 \n                                                 \n4  The removal period may be extended beyond 90 days in certain \ncases involving a noncitizen’s refusal to cooperate with efforts to ar-\nrange for removal.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(C).  There is no indi-\ncation that this exception applies here, and the government has not \nargued otherwise.  Accordingly, we refer throughout to a 90-day \nremoval period. \n5  The full text of the relevant portion of § 1231 provides: \n(a) Detention, release, and removal of aliens ordered removed \n  (1)  Removal period \n    (A)  In general \nExcept as otherwise provided in this section, when an alien is \nordered removed, the Attorney General shall remove the al-\nien from the United States within a period of 90 days (in this \nsection referred to as the “removal period”). \n \n \n\n15a \n \n  Again, during that 90-day period, detention is man-\ndatory.    Once the 90-day window closes, however, a \nnoncitizen who has not been removed normally is sub-\nject to supervised release.    Id. § 1231(a)(3); see also   \n8 C.F.R. § 241.5 (governing release on bond after expi-\nration of removal period).    Detention beyond the 90-day \nremoval period is governed by § 1231(a)(6), which allows \nfor the discretionary extension of detention in certain \ncases, including those in which the government deter-\nmines that a noncitizen is a “risk to the community or \nunlikely to comply with the order of removal.”    8 U.S.C. \n§ 1231(a)(6) (certain noncitizens “may be detained be-\nyond the removal period and, if released, shall be sub-\nject to [supervised release]”) (emphasis added); see also \nZadvydas  v.  Davis,  533  U.S.  678,  683-84  (discussing \npost-removal-period detention provisions).6  But—critically \n                                                 \n    (B)  Beginning of period \n  The removal period begins on the latest of the following: \n(i)  The date the order of removal becomes administra-\ntively final. \n(ii)  If the removal order is judicially reviewed and if a \ncourt orders a stay of the removal of the alien, the date of \nthe court’s final order. \n(iii)  If the alien is detained or confined (except under an \nimmigration process), the date the alien is released from \ndetention or confinement. \n8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(A)-(B). \n6  The dissent suggests that the petitioners may have been de-\ntained under a different portion of § 1231(a)(6), providing for discre-\ntionary detention of noncitizens “inadmissible under section 1182.”  \nSection 1182(a)(9), to which the dissent points, governs certain non-\ncitizens previously removed who “seek[] admission” to the United \nStates.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(A)(i)-(ii).  It is not clear to us that \n \n\n16a \n \nfor this case—while detainees seeking release on bond \nunder § 1226 are entitled to individualized hearings be-\nfore immigration judges, such hearings are not afforded \nin connection with § 1231(a)(6) determinations.    See 8 \nC.F.R. § 241.4 (establishing custody review procedures \nunder § 1231(a)(6)); see also Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 683-\n84 (describing procedures); Prieto-Romero, 534 F.3d at \n1057  (whether  §  1226  or  §  1231  governs  “can  affect \nwhether    .  .  .    detention is mandatory or discretion-\nary, as well as the kind of review process available”).7 \n  In short, if the petitioners are detained “pending a \ndecision on whether [they are] to be removed from the \nUnited States” under § 1226, then they are eligible to \nseek  discretionary  release  during  their  withholding-\nonly proceedings and to do so before immigration judges \nin individualized bond hearings.    If, on the other hand, \n§ 1231’s 90-day “removal period” governs, then they are \nnot entitled to those hearings—either because their de-\ntention is mandatory (if the 90-day window has not yet \n                                                 \nthis provision applies to noncitizens in withholding-only proceed-\nings, who may not seek any substantive change in their immigration \nstatus but only “protection from having [a prior removal order] exe-\ncuted to a particular country,” Romero, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 843.  In \nany event, there is no dispute that all post-removal-period detention \nunder § 1231(a)(6), whatever the precise basis, is discretionary and \nnot mandatory. \n7 Even under § 1231, however, there is an agency process to ensure \ncompliance with the due process rights of noncitizens, providing for \nconditional release when “there is no significant likelihood of re-\nmoval” in the “reasonably foreseeable future.”  8 C.F.R. § 241.13(a); \nsee also Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 701 (“[A]n alien may be held in con-\nfinement until it has been determined that there is no significant \nlikelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.”).  The \npetitioners here have not raised Zadvydas-based claims. \n \n\n17a \n \nclosed) or (if it has) because the government may extend \ntheir  detention  beyond  the  removal  period  under   \n§ 1231(a)(6) without affording them a hearing.8 \nB. \n  The government’s central argument on appeal can be \nsummarized like this:    Each of the petitioners is sub-\nject to a reinstated removal order which may not be “re-\nopened or reviewed,” 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5).    It follows, \naccording to the government, that there is no “pending” \ndecision on removability under § 1226(a).    Instead, the \npetitioners already have been “ordered removed” within \nthe meaning of § 1231(a), and those removal orders are \n“administratively final,” triggering the 90-day “removal \nperiod” under § 1231(a)(1)(B).    It is thus § 1231’s de-\ntention provisions, and not those of § 1226, that govern \nthe petitioners’ claim for individualized bond hearings.   \nThat is a perfectly straightforward argument, and as \nnoted above, it has been adopted by some of our sister \ncircuits. \n \n                                                 \n8  Before the district court, the government argued that the peti-\ntioners are subject to mandatory detention under 8 U.S.C. § 1231.  \nBut if, as the government also contends, each petitioner’s 90-day re-\nmoval period was triggered upon reinstatement of her removal or-\nder, then that removal period has come and gone, and with it,  \n§ 1231(a)(2)’s mandatory detention provision.  Accordingly, we un-\nderstand the government’s current position to be that the petition-\ners are detained under § 1231(a)(6), which makes detention discre-\ntionary but does not provide for individualized hearings.  Though \nthe government was unable to clarify this point at argument, it \npointed to no other source of authority for the petitioners’ detention \nonce the 90-day removal period has expired. \n \n\n18a \n \n  We are persuaded, however, that the district court’s \nreading of the two statutory provisions—also adopted \nby a sister circuit—is the better one.    That reading \nfully effectuates the plain text of the provisions and also \nensures that § 1226 and § 1231 fit together to form a \nworkable statutory framework:    Before the government \nhas the actual authority to remove a noncitizen from the \ncountry, § 1226 applies; once the government has that \nauthority, § 1231 governs.    Because the government \nlacks the authority to “actually execute    .  .  .    order[s] \nof removal” while withholding-only proceedings are on-\ngoing, Romero, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 846, the petitioners \nare detained under § 1226. \n1. \n  We begin, like the district court, with the plain text \nof § 1226, which authorizes detention “pending a deci-\nsion on whether the alien is to be removed from the \nUnited States.”    8 U.S.C. § 1226(a).    There is no ques-\ntion that the petitioners are legally “removable” from \nthe United States; they are subject to reinstated and un-\nreviewable removal orders, and may not relitigate their \nremovability.    See id. § 1231(a)(5).    But at the same \ntime, thanks to the exception allowing for withholding-\nonly relief notwithstanding reinstated removal orders, \nthere are now “pending” immigration proceedings that \nmust be concluded before the petitioners may be re-\nmoved.    And we agree with the district court that the \nlanguage of § 1226(a) is better read to focus on this \n“more concrete determination,” Romero, 280 F. Supp. \n3d at 846.    Subsection 1226(a) does not reference legal \n“removability,”  or  use  other  language  that  captures \n“whether the alien is theoretically removable.”    Guerra, \n \n\n19a \n \n831 F.3d at 62 (emphasis added).   Instead, the statute ap-\nplies “pending a decision on whether the alien is to be \nremoved,” 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) (emphasis added), invoking \nthe practical question of whether the government has \nthe authority to execute a removal.    As the Second Cir-\ncuit explained, “[a]n alien subject to a reinstated re-\nmoval order is clearly removable, but the purpose of \nwithholding-only proceedings is to determine precisely \nwhether ‘the alien is to be removed from the United \nStates.’”    Guerra,  831  F.3d  at  62 (quoting  8 U.S.C.   \n \n§ 1226(a)). \n  That reading is confirmed by the text and structure \nof § 1231.    The government sees it differently, emphasiz-\ning that the introductory language of § 1231(a)(1)(A) re-\nfers to “an alien [who] is ordered removed,” and arguing \nthat a noncitizen subject to a reinstated removal order \nby definition has been “ordered removed.”   But whether \nthe petitioners are a match for this introductory phrase \ndoes  not  control  the  outcome  here.    As  explained \nabove, the issue in this case is not whether § 1231 applies \nin the abstract; it is whether § 1231’s detention provi-\nsions govern the petitioners.    And under § 1231, those \ndetention provisions are triggered not when “an alien is \nordered removed,” as the government would have it, but \nonly when the “removal period” begins.    See 8 U.S.C.   \n§ 1231(a)(2) (providing for mandatory detention “[d]uring \nthe removal period”); id. § 1231(a)(6) (providing for dis-\ncretionary detention “beyond the removal period”). \n  So our focus is on § 1231’s “removal period,” and that \nperiod does not begin until the government has the ac-\ntual  legal  authority to  remove  a  noncitizen  from  the \ncountry.    It is only when all of three potential legal im-\npediments to removal have been overcome, that is—the \n \n\n20a \n \nremoval order has become “administratively final,” any \ncourt-issued stay of removal has been lifted, and the \nnoncitizen has been released from any non-immigration \ncustody so that there is jurisdiction to remove—that   \nthe 90 days of the removal period start to run.    Id.   \n§ 1231(a)(1)(B)(i)-(iii) (listing three conditions that must \nbe met before removal period starts).    As the district \ncourt explained, those preconditions are concerned with \n“legal impediment[s] to actual removal” rather than initial \ndeterminations of removability.    Romero, 280 F. Supp. \n3d at 846.    A noncitizen in criminal custody, for instance, \nmay already have been determined (and finally so) to be \n“removable.”    Nevertheless, the 90-day removal period \nwill not begin, and § 1231’s detention provisions will   \nnot apply, until that noncitizen is released from non- \nimmigration  custody  so  that  immigration  authorities \nwill have jurisdiction to execute the removal order.    See \nid.; see also 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(B)(iii). \n  Thus, the text and structure of § 1226 and § 1231 \nalign:    Section 1226 applies when there is still “pend-\ning” a legal determination that must be made before a \nnoncitizen may be removed; and once there are no re-\nmaining legal impediments to removal, § 1231’s 90-day \nremoval period begins.    That result also is consistent \nwith the nature and duration of the removal period it-\nself.    As the Second Circuit explained, § 1231 is con-\ncerned primarily not with detention at all, but with de-\nfining the 90-day removal period within which the gov-\nernment must remove a noncitizen.    Guerra, 831 F.3d \nat 62-63 (government “shall remove the alien” during re-\nmoval period (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a))).    But at the \nsame time, if a noncitizen prevails on a withholding-only \nclaim,  then  she  may  not  be  removed  to  the  country   \ndesignated on the removal order.    See Salgado-Sosa, \n \n\n21a \n \n882 F.3d at 456 (persecution-based withholding of re-\nmoval is mandatory when noncitizen makes necessary \nshowing); Dankam, 495 F.3d at 115-16 (same for torture- \nbased withholding of removal).    Reading § 1226, rather \nthan § 1231, to apply to noncitizens in withholding-only \nproceedings is “more logical,” Guerra, 831 F.3d at 63, \nthan  an  alternative  that  could  leave  agency  officials \ncaught between competing mandates. \n  Similarly, the fact that the removal period is limited \nto 90 days strongly suggests that it is intended to apply \nonly when all legal barriers to removal are cleared away, \nleaving just the “travel, consular, and various other ad-\nministrative arrangements that are necessary” to exe-\ncute a removal order, Diouf v. Mukasey, 542 F.3d 1222, \n1231 (9th Cir. 2008) (explaining that purpose of 90-day \nremoval period is to “afford the government a reasona-\nble amount of time” for administrative arrangements as-\nsociated with execution of removal order).    As the dis-\ntrict court reasoned, the 90-day limitation “makes sense \nif the removal period is only meant to govern the final \nlogistical steps of physically removing an alien.”  Romero, \n280 F. Supp. 3d at 846.  But “it is obvious that withholding- \nonly proceedings take substantially longer than 90 days.”   \nId. at 847.  The government does not dispute this common- \nsense assessment, and we have no reason to doubt it:   \nWithholding-only proceedings are lengthy, beginning, \nas here, with a screening interview by an asylum officer, \nfollowed by referral to an immigration judge for an ad-\nministrative  hearing,  a  subsequent  decision  by  that \njudge, and the opportunity for appeal to the Board of \nImmigration Appeals.    See 8 C.F.R. § 208.31. \n  So if § 1231’s removal period—and its associated de-\ntention provisions—apply to noncitizens in withholding-\n \n\n22a \n \nonly proceedings, then agency officials regularly and \npredictably  will  find  themselves  unable  to  meet  the   \n90-day  removal  deadline.    That  does  not  mean  that   \n§ 1231 cannot bear that meaning; as the government ar-\ngues, the statute expressly contemplates that there will \nbe at least some instances in which the removal process \nexceeds 90 days.    See 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(6) (providing \nin certain cases for detention “beyond the removal pe-\nriod”).    But absent a clearer textual command, we are \nmost reluctant to adopt a construction of § 1231 that in \nan entire class of cases will put government officials—\nroutinely and completely foreseeably—in dereliction of \ntheir statutory duties. \n  The result is that until withholding-only proceedings \nconclude, the removal period has not begun and § 1231’s \ndetention provisions do not apply.    Instead, the deci-\nsion regarding whether petitioners are “to be removed” \nremains “pending,” and § 1226 governs. \n2. \n  The government has a two-fold response to this un-\nderstanding of § 1226 and § 1231 and the way in which \nthey work together.    First, the government argues, it \nmisconceives the nature of withholding-only proceed-\nings and relief.    Section 1226 applies only when there is \na pending decision on whether the alien is to be removed, \nthe government emphasizes, whereas withholding-only \nproceedings are about the where of removal:    Remova-\nbility  is  not  and  may  not  be  contested,  and  all  that   \nremains  “pending”  is  a  determination  of  the  specific \ncountries  to  which  the  petitioners  will  be  removed.   \nAnd while § 1226 by terms does not apply to the peti-\ntioners, the government finishes, § 1231 does, because \n \n\n23a \n \nthe petitioners’ reinstated removal orders are “adminis-\ntratively final” and thus trigger the removal period un-\nder § 1231(a)(1)(B)(i).    We disagree. \n  The government’s first argument centers on the lim-\nited nature of relief available in withholding-only pro-\nceedings.    As the government emphasizes and we ex-\nplain above, withholding-only proceedings are country-\nspecific:    A grant of withholding to a petitioner would \nmean only that the government could not remove that \npetitioner to the country designated on her order of re-\nmoval, usually the country from which she arrived.    It \nwould not preclude the government from taking steps to \nremove the petitioner to some third country, in which \nshe would not face persecution or torture.    See 8 C.F.R. \n§ 208.16(f); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(2) (describing al-\n \nternative countries for removal).    It follows, the gov-\nernment argues—and two circuits have agreed—that \nwhile  withholding-only  proceedings  are  ongoing,  the \nonly question “pending” is to where and not “whether the \nalien is to be removed,” 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) (emphasis \nadded).    See Guerrero-Sanchez, 905 F.3d at 216 (“[T]he \ndecision  that  was  before  the  Immigration  Judge  [in \nwithholding-only  proceedings]  was  not  whether  [the \nnoncitizen] should be removed from the United States—\nas is required to trigger § 1226(a)—but rather, whether \nhe may be removed to Mexico, i.e., to where he should be \nremoved.”    (internal quotation marks omitted)); Padilla- \nRamirez,  882  F.3d  at  832  (“This  narrow  question  of   \nto where an alien may be removed is distinct from the \nbroader  question  of  whether  the  alien  may  be  re-\nmoved.”). \n  We do not think the “whether” and “where” ques-\ntions can be separated so cleanly.    Instead, we agree \n \n\n24a \n \nwith the district court that both legally and practically, \nthe two are intertwined:    Because the government’s re-\nmoval authority turns on the ultimate identification of \nan appropriate country for removal, “it is not clear” \nwhile withholding-only proceedings are pending “that \npetitioners are in fact ‘to be removed’ from the United \nStates.”    Romero,  280  F.  Supp.  3d  at  848  (quoting   \n8 U.S.C. § 1226(a)).    First, as the district court ex-\nplained,  the  provisions  allowing  for  removal  to  third \ncountries put “sharp limitations” on the countries that \nmay be designated for such removal.    Id. (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted); see, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(2)(D) \n(allowing for removal to “country of which alien is a sub-\nject, national, or citizen,” but only with permission of \nthat country); id. § 1231(b)(2)(E) (allowing for removal \nto countries from which noncitizen was admitted or in \nwhich noncitizen resided or was born).    And as a prac-\ntical matter, the government generally cannot “simply \nsua sponte deport an alien to a country where he or she \ndoes not have citizenship; instead, the government must \ntypically get permission to deport from the third coun-\ntry.”    Romero, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 848; see also 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1231(b)(2)(E)(vii) (where no other alternative country \nis available, government may remove to a “country whose \ngovernment will accept the alien into that country”); \nZadvydas, 533 U.S. at 684-86 (explaining that detainees \nhad not been removed because their designated coun-\ntries refused to accept them or lacked a repatriation \ntreaty with the United States).    The bottom line, ac-\ncording to the district court, is that the government has \nnot shown that there are “any countries that meet those \nlimitations  for  petitioners”—that  is,  third  countries   \nto which they could be removed were they to succeed   \n \n\n25a \n \nin  their  withholding-only  proceedings.    Romero,   \n280 F. Supp. 3d at 848.9 \n  Second,  the  prohibition  on  removal  to  a  country \nwhere a noncitizen would face persecution or torture re-\nmains absolute.    And precisely because withholding of \nremoval is country-specific, as the government says, if a \nnoncitizen who has been granted withholding as to one \ncountry faces removal to an alternative country, then \nshe must be given notice and an opportunity to request \nwithholding of removal to that particular country.    See \nKossov v. INS, 132 F.3d 405, 409 (7th Cir. 1998).    At a \nminimum, as the district court explained, “third-country \nremoval would require additional proceedings,” includ-\ning the opportunity for a hearing—which means that the \ngovernment lacks the “present and final legal authority” \nto remove the petitioners during their initial withholding- \nonly proceedings.    Romero, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 846, 847.   \nUnless  and  until  the  government  can  ensure  that   \nthird-country removal would comply with the statutory   \ntorture- and persecution-based limits on its removal au-\nthority, in other words, “it is not clear    .  .  .    that peti-\ntioners  are  in  fact  ‘to  be  removed’  from  the  United \nStates.”    Id. at 848.    That determination remains “pend-\ning,” and § 1226(a) applies. \n  The government’s second argument focuses not on   \n§ 1226 but on § 1231, and specifically on the subsection \nof § 1231 that makes an “administratively final” order of \nremoval a trigger for the 90-day removal period.    See   \n                                                 \n9  Given the restrictions on third-country removal, that is not sur-\nprising.  Other courts have suggested that noncitizens who prevail \nin withholding-only proceedings are only very rarely removed to \nthird countries.  See Kumarasamy v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 453 F.3d \n169, 171 n.1 (3d Cir. 2006). \n \n\n26a \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(B)(i).    According to the govern-\nment, a reinstated removal order, which cannot be “reo-\npened or reviewed,” id. § 1231(a)(5), constitutes an “ad-\nministratively final” order that initiates § 1231’s 90-day \nremoval period and related detention provisions.    See \nGuerrero-Sanchez, 905 F.3d at 217; Padilla-Ramirez, \n882 F.3d at 831-32.    Like the district court and the Sec-\nond Circuit, we disagree. \n  To be clear, we do not doubt that in most cases, a re-\ninstated removal order will qualify as “administratively \nfinal” and—so long as there is no other legal impediment \nto removal, see 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(B)(ii) (judicial stay); \n \nid. § 1231(a)(1)(B)(iii) (non-immigration detention)—will \nstart the § 1231 removal-period clock, giving agency of-\nficials 90 days to make travel and administrative ar-\nrangements.    That  would  explain  why  Congress  lo-\ncated § 1231(a)(5), governing reinstatement of removal \norders, in the same provision that establishes the 90-day \nremoval period.    In the ordinary case, reinstatement of \na removal order, which does not allow for review of the \nunderlying removal determination, will “mark the con-\nsummation  of  the  agency’s  decisionmaking  process,” \nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997) (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (defining “finality” for admin-\nistrative law purposes), leaving for the 90-day window \nonly administrative execution of the removal order. \n  But the question here is about the exceptional case, \nnot the ordinary case:    The small percentage of cases \nin  which—notwithstanding  §  1231(a)(5)’s  general  bar \nagainst relief from reinstated removal orders—a noncit-\nizen with a “reasonable fear” of persecution or torture is \npermitted  to  apply  for  withholding  of  removal.    In \nthose cases, “the reinstated removal order is not final in \n \n\n27a \n \nthe usual legal sense because it cannot be executed until \nfurther  agency  proceedings  are  complete.”    Luna- \nGarcia v. Holder, 777 F.3d 1182, 1185 (10th Cir. 2015).   \nAs the district court explained, “[i]n agency law, finality \nis generally achieved when an action both ‘mark[s] the \nconsummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process’ \nand also determines legal rights or obligations.”    Ro-\nmero, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 847 (quoting Bennett, 520 U.S. \nat 177-78.    The petitioners’ legal status as “removable” \nalready has been determined.    But the decisionmaking \nprocess in their cases remains “ongoing —i.e., it has not \nbeen consummated—as the agency is still determining \nwhether petitioners will be granted withholding of re-\nmoval or will be removed.”    Id. (emphasis added); see \nalso Guerra, 831 F.3d at 63 (treating reinstated removal \norders as “final” under § 1231 during withholding-only \nproceedings “runs counter to principles of administra-\ntive law which counsel that to be final, an agency action \nmust  mark  the  consummation  of  the  agency’s  deci-\nsionmaking  process”  (internal  quotation  marks  omit-\nted)). \n  Consistent with this general definition of administra-\ntive finality, courts routinely have held—and the gov-\nernment has agreed, see Luna-Garcia, 777 F.3d at 1183 \n—that a reinstated order of removal is not “final” for \npurposes of judicial review until the agency completes \nadjudication of a noncitizen’s request for withholding of \nremoval.    See Romero, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 847; see also \nGuerra,  831  F.3d  at  63;  Ponce-Osorio  v.  Johnson,   \n824 F.3d 502, 505-06 (5th Cir. 2016) (per curiam); Ortiz-\nAlfaro v. Holder, 694 F.3d 955, 958 (9th Cir. 2012).    Un-\nder 8 U.S.C. § 1252, judicial review is limited to “final \norder[s] of removal,” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1), and must be \nsought no more than 30 days after the date of a “final \n \n\n28a \n \norder,” id. § 1252(b)(1).    In holding that a reinstated \nremoval order is not “final” under § 1252 until after the \ncompletion of withholding-only proceedings, some courts \nhave expressed concern that the 30-day deadline other-\nwise would make it impossible to timely petition for re-\nview  of  those  proceedings.    See,  e.g.,  Ortiz-Alfaro,   \n694 F.3d at 958.    As the Tenth Circuit has explained, \nhowever, those decisions also rest on the more general \nadministrative-law proposition that an order is not “fi-\nnal”  when  there  are  pending  applications  for  relief.   \nSee  Luna-Garcia,  777  F.3d  at  1186;  see  also  Ortiz- \nAlfaro, 694 F.3d at 958 (noting that holding is consistent \nwith cases determining finality in “different contexts \nthan the one presented here”). \n  The government does not dispute that a removal or-\nder is “final” under § 1252’s judicial review provisions \nonly when withholding-only proceedings end.10    Instead, \n                                                 \n10 The dissent, unlike the government, does suggest that a rein-\nstated removal order becomes “final” for purposes of judicial review \nunder § 1252 before withholding-only proceedings conclude, which \npresumably would render the withholding-only determination non-\nreviewable.  But as the district court explained, Mejia v. Sessions, \n866 F.3d 573 (4th Cir. 2017), on which the dissent relies, applied  \n§ 1252’s finality provision and time bar to an underlying removal or-\nder, not to a withholding-only determination.  Romero, 280 F. Supp. \n3d at 847 n.23; see Mejia, 866 F.3d at 588-89 (declining to “allow[ ] a \nchallenge to an underlying removal order any time a reinstated or-\nder is issued”).  Mejia did not address finality in the context of a \nchallenge to withholding-only proceedings, and so had no occasion to \nconsider the line of cases described above.  Without more, we do \nnot read Mejia as putting us in conflict with the circuits that have \nheld, in agreement with the government, that when a noncitizen \nseeks review of a withholding-only determination, the reinstated or-\nder of removal is not “final” for purposes of appellate review until \nwithholding-only proceedings are completed. \n \n\n29a \n \nit argues that we should adopt a “bifurcated definition \nof finality,” Guerra, 831 F.3d at 63, under which a rein-\nstated removal order is simultaneously final for pur-\nposes of detention under § 1231 and not final for pur-\nposes  of  judicial  review  under  §  1252.    The  district \ncourt, like the Second Circuit, see id., rejected that pro-\nposal, and so do we.    It is possible, of course, for the \nsame word—here, “final”—to mean two different things \nin two different parts of this statute; context matters, \nand not all the arguments that support the case law on \nfinality under § 1252 translate directly to § 1231.    See   \nPadilla-Ramirez, 882 F.3d at 833-34 (adopting govern-\nment’s bifurcated definition of “finality”).    But the pre-\nsumption is that finality should mean the same thing   \nin  both  these  provisions,  see  Gen.  Dynamics  Land   \nSys., Inc. v. Cline, 540 U.S. 581, 595 (2004), making for \na far more workable statutory structure.    And as de-\nscribed above, we find no clear indication that Congress \nintended § 1231 to apply while withholding-only pro-\nceedings remain pending; indeed, we think the better \nreading is that § 1226 governs such cases.    Cf. id. (ex-\nplaining that presumption of same meaning “yields” to \nindications  of  contrary  congressional  intent  (internal \nquotation marks omitted)).    Without some compelling \nreason to do so, we decline to graft a two-tiered system \nof finality onto immigration cases involving withholding-\nonly proceedings.    See Guerra, 831 F.3d at 63 (because \nnoncitizens with pending withholding-only proceedings \nclearly fall under § 1226 and not § 1231, court “need not \ncreate new principles parsing administrative finality”).11 \n                                                 \n11 The government also argues that the petitioners’ reinstated re-\nmoval orders are “administratively final” under § 1231(a)(1)(B)(i), \n \n\n30a \n \n  In addition to the two primary arguments addressed \nabove, the government has a fallback position:    Even if \nthe text and structure of § 1226 and § 1231 do not make \nclear  that  the  petitioners’  detention  is  governed  by   \n§ 1231, we should adopt that position as a matter of def-\nerence  to  reasonable  agency  regulations.    Although   \nthe courts are divided, as we have discussed, on the ulti-\nmate merits of this dispute, there is one point on which \nthey are unanimous:    The regulations cited by the gov-\nernment do not actually specify which section—§ 1226 \nor § 1231—authorizes detention of noncitizens subject   \nto  reinstated  removal  orders  who  have  been  placed  \nin withholding-only proceedings.  See Romero, 280 F. Supp. \n3d at 845 (“These regulations do not answer the question \nraised  by  petitioners.”);  see  also  Guerrero-Sanchez,   \n905  F.3d  at  215  (“Chevron  deference  is  inapplicable   \n.  .  .    because  [the  regulation]  does  not  resolve  the \nquestion of whether § 1226(a) or § 1231(a) governs [the \npetitioner’s] detention.”); Padilla-Ramirez, 882 F.3d at \n831  (“This  regulation  therefore  does  not  answer  the \nquestion of when the removal period begins.”); Guerra, \n831 F.3d at 63 (“The regulations [the government] cite[s], \n                                                 \ntriggering the 90-day removal period, by virtue of the INA’s defini-\ntions provision, which makes a removal order “final” when it is af-\nfirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals or the time for such \nreview has passed.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(47)(B).  But as even one \ncourt that otherwise agreed with the government has explained, that \ngeneral definition has “limited utility in the context of reinstated re-\nmoval orders” because the underlying removal order in most circum-\nstances may not be reviewed by the Board of Immigration Appeals.  \nPadilla-Ramirez, 882 F.3d at 831; see also Luna-Garcia, 777 F.3d \nat 1185.  And because the same definition applies equally to the ju-\ndicial review provision at § 1252 as it does to § 1231, one position that \n§ 1101(a)(47)(B) clearly cannot support is the government’s:  that \nfinality means something different under those two provisions. \n \n\n31a \n \nhowever, do not provide which section authorizes deten-\ntion of aliens in [the petitioner’s] position.”).    We agree.   \nBecause there are no regulations to which we could de-\nfer under Chevron, we must “conduct our own review of \nthe statute.”    Padilla-Ramirez, 882 F.3d at 831.12 \nIII. \n  For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the district \ncourt that the relevant provisions of § 1226, rather than \n§ 1231, govern the petitioners’ detention, entitling the \npetitioners to individualized bond hearings.    Accord-\ningly, we affirm the district court’s judgments. \n  Our holding does not, of course, guarantee the peti-\ntioners’ release from custody.    The petitioners must \ncarry their burden of proving that they are eligible for \nconditional release, and agency officials enjoy broad dis-\ncretion  in  making  detention-related  decisions.    See   \n8 C.F.R. § 236.1(c)(8); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a).    All \nthat is at issue in this appeal is whether the petitioners \nare entitled to make their case for release on bond to \n                                                 \n12 The government also argues that this question was resolved by \nZadvydas v. Davis, in which the Supreme Court addressed a chal-\nlenge to indefinite post-removal-period detention under § 1231(a)(6). \n533 U.S. at 682.  In that case, the parties assumed, and the Court \ndid not question, that § 1231(a)(6) governed the post-90-day deten-\ntion of two noncitizens who had yet to be removed because their des-\nignated countries of removal (as well as alternative third countries) \nrefused to accept them.  Id. at 684-86.  But unlike the petitioners \nhere, those detainees never challenged their designated countries of \nremoval, and never were placed in withholding-only proceedings; as \na result, there never was any question that the government had the \nactual legal authority to remove them.  Zadvydas, in other words, \ndoes not implicate the withholding-only proceedings and persecution- \nand torture-based restrictions on removal that are at the heart of \nthis appeal. \n \n\n32a \n \nimmigration judges in individualized hearings.    Like \nthe district court and the Second Circuit, we find that \nthe statutory framework entitles them to that process. \nAFFIRMED \n \n\n33a \n \nRICHARDSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \n  This case presents a question of statutory interpre-\ntation.    Are previously removed aliens, who are subject \nto a reinstated order of removal from the United States, \nentitled to a bond hearing when they seek withholding \nof removal?    The answer turns on which provision of \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act governs their de-\ntention.    Section 1231 applies “when an alien is ordered \nremoved” and provides no right to a bond hearing.    On \nthe other hand, § 1226 applies to an alien awaiting “a de-\ncision on whether the alien is to be removed” and per-\nmits the alien’s release on bond after a hearing.    The \nmajority holds that § 1226 controls. \n  I respectfully dissent.    Both the plain language and \nthe structure of the Immigration and Nationality Act \ncompel the conclusion that § 1231, not § 1226, governs \nthe  detention  of  aliens  with  reinstated  orders  of  re-\nmoval.    Petitioners are thus not entitled to a bond hear-\ning while they seek withholding of removal under their \nreinstated orders of removal. \nI. \nA. \n  Petitioners are aliens previously ordered removed \nfrom the United States.    After their removal, each re-\nturned illegally.    When they were later located by im-\nmigration  authorities,  each  “prior  order  of  removal \n[was]  reinstated  from  its  original  date.”    8  U.S.C.   \n§ 1231(a)(5).    Once reinstated, the removal order “is \nnot subject to being reopened or reviewed, [and] the   \nalien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief   \nunder  [the  Immigration  and  Nationality  Act].”    Id.;   \nsee  Fernandez-Vargas  v.  Gonzales,  548  U.S.  30,  35 \n \n\n34a \n \n(2006).    Instead, “the alien shall be removed under the \nprior order.”    § 1231(a)(5).    Thus, Petitioners have, \nonce and for all, been ordered removed. \n  Section 1231(a) governs the “[d]etention, release, and \nremoval of aliens ordered removed.”    It provides for a \nninety-day “removal period,” during which “the Attor-\nney General shall detain” an alien and then “shall remove \nthe alien from the United States.”  §§ 1231(a)(1)(A), (a)(2) \n(emphasis added).    The “removal period” begins on the \n“date the order of removal becomes administratively fi-\nnal,” unless the alien is confined for non-immigration \nreasons or the “removal order” is stayed during judicial \nreview.    § 1231(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). \n  Two paths may extend detention beyond ninety days.   \nFirst, § 1231(a)(1)(C) requires that the “removal period \nshall be extended    .  .  .    and the alien may remain in \ndetention” if the alien “acts to prevent the alien’s re-\nmoval subject to an order of removal.”1    Second, even \nwhere the removal period is not extended, § 1231(a)(6) \nauthorizes continued detention:    an alien ordered re-\nmoved “may be detained beyond the removal period” if \nthe alien is either (i) “inadmissible” under § 1182 or (ii) \nfound to be a risk to the community or unlikely to com-\nply with the removal order.    § 1231(a)(6). \n  But extended detention is not indefinite detention.   \nThe Supreme Court has held that under § 1231(a)(6) “an \nalien may be held in confinement until it has been deter-\nmined that there is no significant likelihood of removal \n                                                 \n1 Section 1231(a)(1)(C)’s language suggests that seeking withhold-\ning of removal qualifies as an “act[ ] to prevent the alien’s removal,” \nwhich would extend the removal period.  The parties have not ar-\ngued this issue, and it is left for a future case. \n \n\n35a \n \nin  the  reasonably  foreseeable  future.”    Zadvydas  v. \nDavis, 533 U.S. 678, 701 (2001).    So an alien detained \nbeyond the removal period may seek release from cus-\ntody by showing that “there is no significant likelihood \nof removal to the country to which he or she was ordered \nremoved, or to a third country, in the reasonably fore-\nseeable future.”    8 C.F.R. § 241.13(a); see also Zadvy-\ndas, 533 U.S. at 701.    In other words, an alien granted \nwithholding of removal to his native country can seek re-\nlease from detention if no substitute country can be found.   \nDespite this potential avenue for relief, Petitioners chose \nnot to make a claim under Zadvydas.    J.A. 210 n.8. \n  As long as removal remains likely in the foreseeable \nfuture, § 1231’s commands easily apply to an alien who \nillegally returns to the United States after being re-\nmoved.    The alien’s prior order of removal must be “re-\ninstated  from  its  original  date”  under  §  1231(a)(5).   \nThis reinstated order may not be challenged.    Id.    In-\nside the removal period, the alien must be detained and \nremoved  from  the  United  States.    §§  1231(a)(1)(A), \n(a)(2).    Outside the removal period, the returning alien \nis inadmissible and may be detained beyond that period.     \n§ 1231(a)(6). \nB. \n  Despite the seemingly “absolute terms” of § 1231’s \nbar on applying for relief from the reinstated removal \norder and the mandate to remove the alien, the Supreme \nCourt has recognized that aliens like Petitioners may \nseek  withholding  of  removal  under  §  1231(b)(3)(A).   \nFernandez-Vargas,  548  U.S.  at  35  n.4.    Section \n1231(b)(3)(A)  bars  removing  an  alien  to  a  particular \ncountry if the alien’s “life or freedom would be threat-\nened in that country because of the alien’s race, religion, \n \n\n36a \n \nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or \npolitical opinion.”    See also 8 C.F.R. § 208.17 (deferral \nof  removal  under  the  Convention  Against  Torture).   \nThis limitation on how the order of removal is executed \nprovides for the withholding proceeding that Petitioners \nhave invoked. \n  This withholding proceeding permits an alien to seek \nprotection from being removed to a particular country. \n8 C.F.R. § 1208.31; Majority Op. at 6.    The alien cannot \nattack a reinstated order requiring removal from the \nUnited States.    See Mejia v. Sessions, 866 F.3d 573, \n578-79 (4th Cir. 2017).    The alien cannot raise any other \nissues, “including but not limited to issues of admissibil-\nity, deportability, eligibility for waivers, and eligibility \nfor any other form of relief.”    8 C.F.R. § 1208.2(c)(3)(i).   \nIn other words, withholding does not address whether \nan alien is ordered removed—that has already been de-\ntermined.    It only addresses how, and more specifically \nwhere, the removal will occur. \n  Moreover, this withholding proceeding does not af-\nfect the finality of the order of removal that was rein-\nstated from its original date.    See Guerrero-Sanchez v. \nWarden York Cty. Prison, 905 F.3d 208, 216-17 (3d. Cir. \n2018); Padilla-Ramirez v. Bible, 882 F.3d 826, 831 (9th \nCir. 2017).    An order of removal “shall become final” \nunder the Immigration and Nationality Act when either \nthe order is affirmed by the Board of Immigration Ap-\npeals or the period for review expires, whichever occurs \nfirst.    § 1101(a)(47)(B) (The order of deportation “shall \nbecome final upon the earlier of—(i) a determination by \nthe Board of Immigration Appeals affirming such order; \nor (ii) the expiration of the period in which the alien is \npermitted to seek review of such order by the Board of \n \n\n37a \n \nImmigration Appeals.”).    And for each Petitioner, the \norder of removal was “final” long ago—either because \nthe Board has already affirmed the order or the time for \nany review has passed, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(b) (notice \nof appeal shall be filed with the Board of Immigration \nAppeals within thirty days of the Immigration Judge’s \ndecision). \n  The order of removal applicable here is the same or-\nder that already removed Petitioners.    Section 1231(a)(5) \ndirects that “the prior order of removal is reinstated \nfrom its original date.”    That reinstatement does not cre-\nate a new or second order of removal.    It simply rein-\nstates the prior order.   And it is the original “date the or-\nder of removal be[came] administratively final” that trig-\ngers Petitioner’s detention and removal.  § 1231(a)(1)(B)(i) \n(emphasis added).    The order was final then and is final \nnow. \nC. \n  The Majority rejects this plain application of § 1231’s \ndictates  and  the  statutory  definition  of  finality  in   \n§ 1101(a)(47)(B).    Instead, the Majority suggests that \nthe otherwise final order of removal is converted into a \nnon-final order once a withholding proceeding begins.   \nBut none of the bases for this suggestion is convincing. \n  The Majority first claims that reinstatement some-\nhow resets finality for the order of removal.    If rein-\nstatement somehow creates a separate and “new” order \nof removal, they argue, then the statutory definition of \nfinality’s focus on Board review does not fit because   \n§ 1231(a)(5) prohibits the Board from reviewing the re-\ninstated order at all.    But § 1231(a)(5) does not create \n \n\n38a \n \na new order of removal; it simply “restore[s]” the old or-\nder, to its “former state.”    Reinstate, BLACK’S LAW \nDICTIONARY (11th ed. 2019).    There is only one order \nof removal, and the opportunity for review by the Board \nof Immigration Appeals has long since passed. \n  Also flowing from this false premise is the Majority’s \nclaim that applying the statutorily required definition of \nfinality would not make sense under the finality require-\nments for judicial review under § 1252.    As we just dis-\ncussed,  the  single  order  of  removal  is  not  reset  by   \n§ 1231(a)(5).    So it is final as of when it originally be-\ncame final.    And the finality required under § 1252(b)(1) \nruns from the original finality, not the date of reinstate-\nment. \n  We  addressed  this  relationship  between  the  rein-\nstatement provision, § 1231(a)(5), and the judicial review \nprovision, § 1252, in Mejia v. Sessions, 866 F.3d 573   \n(4th Cir. 2017).2    There, we explained that “§ 1231(a)(5) \n \n                                                 \n2  Mejia was an alien with a prior order of removal reinstated under \n§ 1231(a)(5).  Mejia, 866 F.3d at 577.  She then applied for asylum \nand withholding of removal and was placed in withholding-only pro-\nceedings.  Id. at 578.  The immigration judge granted her withhold-\ning of removal but rejected her asylum claim.  Id.  Mejia sought re-\nview of both her asylum claim and her challenge to the validity of her \nremoval order based on defects in the underlying removal order.  \nId. at 576.  As for the latter, the Court found that it had no jurisdic-\ntion to consider this issue because Mejia did not timely file her chal-\nlenge.  Id. at 588.  Mejia urged the Court to read “§ 1252(b)(1)’s \ndeadline to refer to the date on which the reinstated order of removal \n—not the original order—becomes final.”  Id. at 589.  But the Court \nheld that “the 30-day deadline runs from the date an original order \nof removal becomes final.”  Id.  As this Court explained, it is “fea-\nsible that an individual removed to her home country could illegally \n \n\n39a \n \ndoesn’t deprive us of jurisdiction to review the constitu-\ntional claims and questions of law that arise from an un-\nderlying removal order in the reinstatement context.”   \nId. at 589.    So while “the underlying removal order in \nmost circumstances may not be reviewed by the Board \nof Immigration Appeals,” Majority Op. at 30 n.11, there \ncan still be judicial review of certain claims raised upon \nreinstatement of a removal order, if the petition for ju-\ndicial  review  is  “filed    .  .  .    in  accordance  with   \n[§ 1252].”   Mejia, 866 F.3d at 589 (citing § 1252(a)(2)(D)). \n  Section 1252(b)(1) requires that “[t]he petition for re-\nview must be filed not later than 30 days after the date \nof the final order of removal.”    And we interpreted the \nphrase, “final order of removal,” to refer to the “original \norder of removal,” not the reinstated order.    See Mejia, \n866 F.3d at 589 (holding “that the 30-day deadline [for \npetitioning for judicial review] runs from the date an \noriginal order of removal becomes final” and rejecting \nthe argument that the deadline refers to the date when \nthe reinstated removal order becomes final).    Thus, in \nthis Circuit, determining whether we have jurisdiction \nunder § 1252 turns on whether the alien filed his petition \nfor judicial review within thirty days from the date when \nthe  “original  order  of  removal  becomes  final.”    Id.   \nThe statutory definition of finality applies “equally to \nthe judicial review provision,” Majority Op. at 30 n.11, \nand our jurisdictional inquiry is whether the original, \n                                                 \nre-enter the United States, have the original removal order rein-\nstated by DHS, and petition for review—all within a month’s time.”  \nId. at 590.  Thus, the Court’s holding did not abolish “review of all \nunderlying orders in reinstatement.”  Id. (citations and emphasis \nomitted).  There could be judicial review if the alien petitioned for \nreview no more than thirty days from the date the original order of \nremoval became final. \n \n\n40a \n \nnot the reinstated, removal order meets the definition of \nfinality in § 1101(a)(47)(B). \n  Yet the Majority still argues that a reinstated re-\nmoval order is not “final” for judicial review until the \ncompletion of the proceeding for withholding of removal, \nrelying on decisions from the Second, Fifth, and Ninth \nCircuits for support.    But these cases are improperly \nbased on a pragmatic desire to permit judicial review \nthat we rejected in Mejia.    As this Court explained, if \nwe were to accept the argument that the period for ju-\ndicial review of a reinstated removal order depends on \nwhen the reinstatement is “final,” this “‘would defeat \n \nthe purpose of the statute’s time bar by allowing a chal-\nlenge to an underlying removal order any time a rein-\nstated order is issued.’”    Mejia, 866 F.3d at 589 (quot-\n \ning Verde-Rodriguez v. Att’y Gen. U.S., 734 F.3d 198, \n203 (3d Cir. 2013)). \n  In another attempt to avoid the finality of the order \nof removal, the Majority focuses on purported practical-\nities,  arguing  that  the  “finality”  required  under   \n§ 1231(a)(1)(B) is the final “authority” to physically re-\nmove the alien.    Majority Op. at 20, 24.    But nowhere \ndoes  the  statute  refer  to  “actual  legal  authority”  to   \nremove an alien.3    Section 1231(a)(1)(B) is triggered   \n                                                 \n3  The Majority purports to derive the “actual legal authority” \nstandard based on the three dates listed in § 1231(a)(1)(B), the latest \nof which begins the removal period: \n(i)  The date the order of removal becomes administratively \nfinal. \n(ii)  If the removal order is judicially reviewed and if a court \norders a stay of the removal of the alien, the date of the \ncourt’s final order. \n \n\n41a \n \nby the administrative finality of the “order of removal.”   \nOnly by this sleight of hand—converting the finality of \nan “order” to some amorphous final “authority”—can \none avoid the conclusion that the reinstated removal or-\nder under § 1231(a)(5) is an administratively final order. \n  Finally, the Majority claims that “the fact the re-\nmoval period is limited to 90 days strongly suggests that \n[§ 1231] is intended to apply only when all legal barriers \nto  removal  are  cleared  away.”    Majority  Op.  at  21.   \nBut § 1231 provides that aliens with orders of removal \nreinstated under § 1231(a)(5) “may be detained beyond \nthe removal period.”   § 1231(a)(6).    Among other ways, \nthis extended detention applies to any alien “ordered re-\nmoved who is inadmissible under Section 1182.”    Id.   \n                                                 \n(iii) If the alien is detained or confined (except under an immi-\ngration process), the date the alien is released from deten-\ntion or confinement. \nThose dates, it reasons, are “potential legal impediments to re-\nmoval,” suggesting that, rather than determine which date applies, \nthe court should determine whether any “legal impediment” exists.  \nMajority Op. at 20, 26.  Apparently, that includes impediments that \nare not listed, such as the withholding proceedings at issue here. \n  Creating this standard requires a judicial addition to the clear \nstatutory language.   Section 1231(a)(1)(B) lists only three events \nthat trigger the beginning of the removal period.  And the list is \nexclusive, not merely illustrative.    Section 1231(a)(1)(B) provides \nthat “[t]he removal period begins on the latest of the following.”  \nThe provision does not wait for “all legal barriers to removal [to be] \ncleared away.”  Majority Op. at 21 (emphasis added).  While the \nthree triggering events listed in § 1231(a)(1)(B) are themselves legal \nimpediments, this does not mean that the list includes all other  \npotential barriers to removal.    Instead, as the expressio unius \ncanon explains, “expressing one item of an associated group or series \nexcludes another left unmentioned.”    N.L.R.B. v. SW Gen., Inc., \n137 S. Ct. 929, 940 (2017) (citation and alterations omitted). \n \n\n42a \n \nAnd  aliens  with  orders  of  removal  reinstated  under   \n§ 1231(a)(5) are “inadmissible” under § 1182(a)(9).    See \nGarcia-Villeda v. Mukasey, 531 F.3d 141, 151 (2d Cir. \n2008)  (an  alien  with  a  reinstated  removal  order  was \n“permanently  inadmissible”  under  §  1182);  see  also   \nTerrazas-Hernandez v. Barr, 924 F.3d 768, 775 (5th Cir. \n2019); Mendez-Gomez v. Barr, 928 F.3d 728, 732-33 (8th \nCir.  2019).    Thus,  each  Petitioner  is  subject  to  ex-\n \ntended detention under § 1231(a)(6). \n  And failing to effectuate removal within ninety days \nis no dereliction of statutory duties:    § 1231(a)(1) di-\nrects removal within ninety days, but § 1231(b)(3)(A) \nbars removal to a country where life or freedom would \nbe threatened on protected grounds.    So where an alien \nseeks withholding from removal to one country under   \n§ 1231(b)(3), see Fernandez-Vargas, 548 U.S. at 35 n.4, \nthe statutory scheme itself contemplates that the alien \nmay be removed to another country, § 1231(b)(2), and con-\ntinued in detention under § 1231(a)(6). \n  In sum, the language of § 1231 governs every step:   \nthe order of removal’s reinstatement from its original \ndate (§ 1231(a)(5)), the bar on reviewing the order of re-\nmoval (§ 1231(a)(5)), the direction to promptly remove \nthe alien (§ 1231(a)(1)(A)), the extension of the removal \nperiod (§ 1231(a)(1)(C)), the withholding challenge to \nthe execution of the order (§ 1231(b)(3)(A)), and the al-\nien’s detention (§§ 1231(a)(2), 1231(a)(6)). \nII. \n  Despite the directives in § 1231, Petitioners argue \nthat they should be treated under § 1226 and not § 1231.   \nBut § 1226 applies in a different context:    when an alien \n \n\n43a \n \nis “pending a decision on whether the alien is to be re-\nmoved from the United States.”    § 1226(a).    For this \nprovision to apply, the decision that must remain unde-\ncided is not whether the alien is to be removed to a cer-\ntain country but, as § 1226 states, “whether the alien is \nto be removed from the United States” at all. \n  The Petitioners are not awaiting that decision.    As \nexplained  above,  they  illegally  reentered  the  United \nStates after being “ordered removed.”    § 1231(a)(1)(A).   \nTheir “prior order of removal [was] reinstated from its \noriginal date and is not subject to being reopened or re-\nviewed.”    § 1231(a)(5).    They are barred from apply-\ning “for any relief under this chapter,” which includes \nthe possibility of release from detention under § 1226. \n  The statutory structure of the Immigration and Na-\ntionality Act confirms that it is § 1231, not § 1226, that \napplies to the Petitioners.    We cannot read the text of \nthese two provisions in a vacuum but must consider the \nstatutory structure as one of the “tools of divining mean-\ning.”    Abramski v. United States, 573 U.S. 169, 179 \n(2014). \n  Both § 1226 and § 1231 are in a part of the Act enti-\ntled  “Inspection,  Apprehension,  Examination,  Exclu-\nsion, and Removal.”    As the title implies, this part pro-\nvides a timeline of events that spans eleven statutory \nprovisions from § 1221 to § 1232.    Sections 1221 to 1224 \ndiscuss the arrival of aliens.    Those sections are fol-\nlowed by § 1225, which provides instructions for inspect-\ning the aliens, expediting removal of certain “arriving \naliens,”  and  referring  others  for  a  removal  hearing.   \nNext, § 1226 concerns the “[a]pprehension and deten-\ntion  of  aliens”  who  are  still  “pending  a  decision  on \nwhether the alien is to be removed from the United \n \n\n44a \n \nStates.”    § 1226(a).    It is not until three statutory pro-\nvisions later, in § 1229, that the Act explains the struc-\nture of the alien’s removal proceedings.    See §§ 1229-\n1229c.    If the alien is admitted into the United States, \n§ 1230 explains how to record admission.    On the other \nhand, “when an alien is ordered removed,” § 1231 directs \nhow the alien is treated.    This series of events reflects \nthat, once the alien has been ordered removed from the \nUnited States in a removal proceeding under § 1229a \nand that order has been reinstated under § 1231(a)(5), \nthe alien cannot go back in time, so to speak, to § 1226.   \nSection 1226 simply does not apply here.   \n*  *  *   \n  Section 1231 speaks directly to those, like Petition-\ners, who illegally return to the United States after hav-\ning previously been ordered removed.    Section 1226 \ndoes not.    While their detention remains subject to a \nZadvydas claim that there is no significant likelihood of \nremoval in the  foreseeable  future,  the statutory  lan-\nguage and structure dictates that each Petitioner may \nbe detained without a bond hearing as permitted by   \n§ 1231. \n \n\n45a \n \nAPPENDIX B \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA \nALEXANDRIA DIVISION \n \nNo. 1:17-cv-754 (LMB/JFA) \nCRISTIAN FLORES ROMERO, ET AL., PETITIONERS \nv. \nYVONNE EVANS, ET AL., RESPONDENTS \n \nFiled:  Nov. 17, 2017 \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n \n  Before the Court are petitioners’ Motion for Sum-\nmary Judgment [Dkt. No. 24] and respondents’ Motion \nto Dismiss in Part [Dkt. No. 27] and Motion for Sum-\nmary Judgment [Dkt. No. 28].    The motions have been \nfully briefed, oral argument has been heard, and for the \nreasons  discussed  in  this  Memorandum  Opinion,  re-\nspondents’ Motion to Dismiss in Part will be granted and \npetitioner Maria Angelica Guzman Chavez will be dis-\nmissed from this civil action.    In addition, respondents’ \nMotion for Summary Judgment will be denied, petition-\ners’ Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted, and \nrespondents will be directed to provide petitioners with \nindividualized bond hearings. \n \n \n \n\n46a \n \nI.    BACKGROUND \n  Petitioners Maria Angelica Guzman Chavez (“Guz-\nman Chavez”), Jose Alfonso Serrano Colocho (“Serrano \nColocho”), Danis Faustino Castro Castro (“Castro Cas-\ntro”), and Cristian Flores Romero (“Flores Romero”) \n(collectively, “petitioners”)1  are currently detained under \nthe  authority of respondents Mary Yvonne Evans (“Ev-\nans”), the Field Office Director of the Washington Field \nOffice of Enforcement and Removal Operations, United \nStates Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”); \nThomas D. Homan (“Homan”), the Acting Director of \nICE; Brenda Cook (“Cook”), the Court Administrator of \nthe Executive Office for Immigration Review (“EOIR”), \nBaltimore  Immigration  Court;  and  Jefferson  B.  Ses-\nsions  III  (“Sessions”),  the  Attorney  General  of  the \nUnited States (collectively, “respondents”).2   In this ac-\ntion, petitioners seek a writ of habeas corpus (Count 1) \nand a declaratory judgment (Count 2) stating that peti-\ntioners  are  detained  under  8  U.S.C.  §  1226(a),  not   \n8 U.S.C. § 1231, and ordering respondents to either re-\nlease petitioners or grant them bond hearings, along \nwith miscellaneous associated relief.3 \n  The material facts in this action are clear and uncon-\ntroverted.    All four petitioners are natives and citizens \n                                                 \n1  When this habeas petition was filed, there was an additional pe-\ntitioner, Wilber Rodriguez Zometa.  On September 21, 2017, he vol-\nuntarily dismissed his claims.  See Dkt. No. 33.  In addition, the \namended habeas petition contained three counts.  On August 25, \n2017, petitioners dismissed Count 3.  See Dkt. No. 26. \n2  All respondents are sued in their official capacities. \n3  Petitioners purport to represent a class of detained individuals \nbut have not yet filed for class certification.  As such, their claims \nwill be discussed as individual claims. \n \n\n47a \n \nof either Guatemala or El Salvador.    See  Resp. Mem. \n[Dkt. No. 29] Ex. 1, at 2;  id.  Ex. 3, at 2;  id.  Ex. 4, at \n2;  id.  Ex. 5, at 1, 4.    At various times between 1999 and \n2013, all four entered or attempted to enter the United \nStates without being admitted by an immigration of-\nficer.    Id.  Ex.  1,  at  2;  id.  Ex.  3,  at  2;  id.  Ex.  4,  at \n2;  id.  Ex. 5, at 3, 6.    All were arrested and placed in \nremoval proceedings, ordered removed, and removed to \ntheir native countries.    Id.  Ex. 1, at 2;  id.  Ex. 3, at \n2;  id.  Ex. 4, at 2;  id.  Ex. 5, at 5, 6.    After removal, all \nfour reentered the United States without receiving per-\nmission from the appropriate authorities, and their re-\nmoval orders were reinstated.   Id. Ex. 1, at 2-3;  id.  Ex. \n3, at 3;  id.  Ex. 4, at 2-3;  id.  Ex. 5, at 7.4      Each peti-\ntioner expressed a fear of removal back to his or her \nhome country and was referred to a United States Citi-\nzenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) officer for \na reasonable fear interview.    Id.  Ex. 1, at 3;  id.  Ex. 3, \nat 3;  id.  Ex. 4, at 2-3;  id.  Ex. 5, at 7.    In each case, the \nUSCIS asylum officer determined that the petitioner \nexpressed a reasonable fear of persecution or torture \nand referred the matter to the Immigration Court, which \nis conducting withholding-only proceedings.    Id.  Ex. 1, at \n3-4; id. Ex. 3, at 3; id. Ex. 4, at 2-3; id. Ex. 5, at 7, 9-10.   \nEach petitioner remains detained pending resolution of \n                                                 \n4 Alone among petitioners, Guzman Chavez has reentered the \nUnited States without authorization twice.  In 2012, after her initial \nremoval, she reentered the country, her removal order was rein-\nstated, she pled guilty to a criminal charge of illegal reentry, and she \nwas removed.   See Resp. Mem. Ex. 5, at 5, 13.    This additional \nreentry is not relevant to the legal arguments in this action. \n \n\n48a \n \nthose  proceedings.    Id.  Ex.  1,  at  3-4;  id.  Ex.  3,  at \n3;  id.  Ex. 4, at 2-3;  id.  Ex. 5, at 7.5 \n  Flores Romero originally brought a petition for a \nwrit of habeas corpus under  28 U.S.C. § 2241, naming \nEvans and the EOIR as respondents.    [Dkt. No. 1], but \nlater filed an amended petition adding the other peti-\ntioners and new respondents, dropping the EOIR as a \nrespondent, and including class action claims [Dkt. No. \n5].    The core argument in the habeas petition is that pe-\ntitioners are detained under 28 U.S.C. § 1226(a) and, as \nsuch, are entitled to bond hearings. \nII.    DISCUSSION \n    A.  Standard of Review \n  A party is entitled to summary judgment if the party \ncan show “that there is no genuine dispute as to any ma-\nterial fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law.”    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).    A genuine dis-\npute of material fact exists “if the evidence is such that \na reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmov-\ning party.”    Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. \n242, 249 (1986).    In general, bare allegations or asser-\ntions by the nonmoving party are not sufficient to gen-\nerate a genuine dispute; instead, the nonmoving party \nmust produce “significantly probative” evidence to avoid \nsummary  judgment.    Abcor  Corp.  v.  AM  Int’l,  Inc.,   \n916 F.2d 924, 929-30 (4th Cir. 1990)  (quoting  Anderson, \n477 U.S. at 242).    That being said, in ruling on a motion \n                                                 \n5 Flores Romero, Serrano Colocho, Castro Castro, and Guzman \nChavez have been detained by ICE respectively since October 5, \n2016, Resp. Mem. Ex. 1, at 3; July 5, 2017, id. Ex. 3, at 3; May 19, \n2017, id. Ex. 4, at 3; and July 24, 2017, id. Ex. 5, at 8, 11. \n \n\n49a \n \nfor summary judgment, a court should accept the evi-\ndence of the nonmovant, and all justifiable inferences \nmust be drawn in her favor.    Anderson, 477 U.S. at \n255,. \n    B.  Motion to Dismiss in Part for Lack of Jurisdic-\n  tion \n  Respondents  first  argue  that  Guzman  Chavez’s \nclaims  should  be  dismissed  for  lack  of  jurisdiction.   \nResp. Mem. 13-14.    According to respondents, in gen-\neral the “proper respondent for a writ of habeas cor-\npus”  is the “immediate custodian” of the petitioner—\nthe “warden of the facility where the petitioner is con-\nfined.”    Id.  at 13 (citing  Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. \n426  (2004)).    Unlike  the  other  petitioners,  Guzman \nChavez was detained in Florida, not in Virginia, when \nthis action was filed; as such, respondents argue that her \nclaims should be dismissed because the Court lacks ju-\nrisdiction over the warden of the Florida detention facil-\nity, who is the only proper respondent.    Id.  at 14. \n  In response, Guzman Chavez argues that the rule \nfrom  Padilla  should not be applied in the immigration \ncontext because “the individuals who can provide relief \nin a habeas petition to an immigrant detainee    .  .  .   \n[are] the Attorney General and the Director of ICE,” not \nthe warden of the detention facility where the petitioner \nis held.    Guzman Chavez Opp. [Dkt. No. 34] 2.    Guz-\nman Chavez supports this argument by pointing to a cir-\ncuit split on this question, which the Fourth Circuit has \nnot addressed, and by emphasizing that, as a matter of \nlaw, the warden of a detention facility cannot order a \n \n\n50a \n bond hearing.    See  id.  at 3-7.6    In addition, Guzman \nChavez appears to argue that any concerns that a rule \nallowing immigrant detainees to sue the Attorney Gen-\neral  rather  than  the  warden  would  incentivize  forum \nshopping can be limited by a set of venue rules,7 such as \nrequiring that the action be filed in the  district where the \nimmigration proceedings are ongoing.    See id.  at 7-9. \n  As both parties recognize, the seminal case address-\ning who constitutes a proper habeas respondent is  Pa-\ndilla, which involved an American citizen detained pur-\nsuant to President Bush’s determination that he was an \n“enemy combatant.”    Padilla brought a habeas petition \nnaming as respondents President Bush, Secretary of \nDefense Donald Rumsfeld, and Melanie Marr (“Marr”), \nthe Commander of the Naval Brig where Padilla was be-\ning held.    See Padilla, 542 U.S. at 432.    Padilla had \noriginally been arrested in Chicago by federal agents \nexecuting  a  material  witness  warrant  issued  by  the \n                                                 \n6  Guzman Chavez also argues in a footnote, and without further \nelaboration, that she is “also asking for injunctive relief, which is re-\nlief for which [r]espondents are clearly proper parties and that could \nbe provided in Virginia.”  Guzman Chavez Opp. 2 n.1.  As respond-\nents correctly argue, to obtain injunctive relief, Guzman Chavez first \nneeds to identify a cause of action that gives the Court jurisdiction \nover her claims; if respondents are correct that her habeas petition \nmust be brought against her immediate custodian, over whom this \nCourt apparently does not have personal jurisdiction, there is no vi-\nable cause of action that allows her to seek injunctive relief from this \nCourt.  See Resp. Reply [Dkt. No. 36] 5 n.2. \n7  Guzman Chavez in fact uses the term “venue” repeatedly in her \nbrief, but she does not appear to be making an argument about the \nactual venue statute.    In Justice Kennedy’s concurrence in Pa-\ndilla, he conceptualized proper-respondent rules as something akin \nto “venue,” rather than “personal jurisdiction,” rules, and the Court \ninterprets Guzman Chavez’s argument as invoking this discussion. \n \n\n51a \n \nUnited States District Court for the Southern District \nof New York.    See  id.  at 430-31.    He was transferred \nto New York, where he was held on federal criminal \ncharges for approximately one month before he was des-\nignated an enemy combatant, transferred to Depart-\nment  of  Defense  custody,  and  moved  to  a  brig  in \nCharleston, South Carolina.    See  id.  at 431-32.    After \nhe was moved to South Carolina, Padilla filed his habeas \npetition in the Southern District of New York.    Id.  at \n432.    The government moved to dismiss, arguing that \nthe court did not have jurisdiction over Marr, the imme-\ndiate custodian and only proper respondent.    See id.   \nOn that preliminary question, the district court held that \nRumsfeld’s “personal involvement” in Padilla’s custody \nrendered him a proper respondent; the Second Circuit \nagreed, finding in addition that on the “unique” facts of \nthe case, Rumsfeld’s exercise of the “legal reality of con-\ntrol” over Padilla made him an appropriate respond-\nent.    Id.  at 432-33. \n  The Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit af-\nter finding that Marr was the only proper respondent. \nAccording to the Court, the “question whether the South-\nern District has jurisdiction over Padilla’s habeas peti-\ntion breaks down into two related subquestions.    First, \nwho is the proper respondent to that petition?    And \nsecond, does the Southern District have jurisdiction over \nhim or her?”   Id. at 434.    The Court addressed each \nquestion in turn. \n  Beginning  with  the  first  question—the  proper   \nrespondent—the Court started its analysis with the text \nof the habeas statute, which “straightforwardly provides \nthat the proper respondent” is “the person who has cus-\ntody over” the petitioner.   Id. at 434 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \n \n\n52a \n \n§ 2242).    The statute’s “consistent use of the definite \narticle” suggested to the Court that “there is generally \nonly one proper respondent” for a given petitioner and \nthat this proper respondent is the person “with the abil-\nity to produce the prisoner’s body before the habeas \ncourt.”    Id.  at 434-35.    As the Court explained, this \nlanguage provides the basis for the general rule that has \nbeen “confirm[ed]” by “longstanding practice”:    “[I]n \nhabeas  challenges  to  present  physical  confinement—\n‘core challenges’—the default rule is that the proper re-\nspondent is the warden of the facility where the prisoner \nis being held, not the Attorney General or some other \nremote supervisory official.”    Id.  at 435.8 \n  Padilla relied on three cases—Braden v. 30th Judicial \nCircuit  Court,  410  U.S.  484  (1973);  Strait  v.  Laird,   \n406 U.S. 341 (1972); and Ex parte Endo, 323 U.S. 283 (1944) \n—to argue that there should be an exception to this gen-\neral rule that would enable prisoners who are not de-\ntained under criminal charges to sue the individual with \nlegal, rather than physical, control over the prisoner.   \nThe Court rejected that reliance by pointing out that the \npetitioners in  Braden  and  Strait were not challenging \n                                                 \n8  At this point, the Court included a footnote acknowledging that \nit had previously “left open the question whether the Attorney Gen-\neral is a proper respondent to a habeas petition filed by an alien de-\ntained pending deportation.”   Padilla, 542 U.S. at 435 n.8.    The \nCourt recognized that the lower courts had split (with the majority \napplying the immediate custodian rule) but, because the issue was \nnot squarely presented in Padilla, the Court “again decline[d] to re-\nsolve it.”   Id.   Since Padilla was decided, the availability of ha-\nbeas relief to immigration detainees has been significantly curtailed \nand it is unclear how the pre-Padilla lower court decisions would ap-\nply to the new immigrant habeas landscape.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252; \n \n\n53a \n \ntheir immediate physical custody; therefore, “the imme-\ndiate custodian rule did not apply because  there was \nno  immediate  physical  custodian  with  respect  to  the \n‘custody’  being  challenged.”    Padilla,  542  U.S.  at \n439.9    Moreover, the Court determined  Endo  to be in-\napplicable, as it read that case to stand for “the im-\nportant but limited proposition” that if the government \nmoves a habeas petitioner after the petition is properly \nfiled, the district court retains jurisdiction over the pe-\ntition.    Id.  at 441.    The Court held that none of those \ncases established a broad exception to the general rule \ngoverning habeas petitions that, like Padilla’s, challenged \nthe  petitioner’s  present  physical  confinement.    Id.  at \n441-42. \n  Having determined that  Marr  was  the proper re-\nspondent, the  Padilla  Court  moved  on to the second \nquestion:    whether the district court had jurisdiction \nover Marr.   See id. at 442.10   The Court first observed \nthat the longstanding interpretation of habeas jurisdic-\ntion was that jurisdiction was available only in the dis-\ntrict of confinement, an interpretation supported by var-\nious provisions of the habeas statutes and implicitly con-\nfirmed by Congress.  See id. at 442-43.  Then, the Court \n                                                 \n9  In Braden, the  petitioner,  who  was  in  custody  in  Alabama, \nbrought a habeas corpus proceeding against a Kentucky court where \nhe had a separate indictment pending, arguing that he had a right to \na speedy trial on the Kentucky indictment.    410 U.S. at 485-86.  \nIn Strait, the petitioner, who was an Army Reserve officer, brought \na habeas corpus proceeding in which he requested a discharge as a \nconscientious objector against the commanding officer of the Army \nrecords center.  406 U.S. at 342. \n10 This requirement comes not from notions of personal jurisdic-\ntion but from 28 U.S.C. § 2241(a), which limits district courts to \ngranting habeas relief “within their respective jurisdictions.” \n \n\n54a \n \nrejected  Padilla’s  argument  that  Braden  and  Strait \nstand for the proposition that “jurisdiction will lie in any \ndistrict in which the respondent is amenable to service \nof  process.”    Id.  at  443.    As  the  Court  explained, \nthe  Braden  petitioner, who was detained in Alabama, \nwas challenging his future confinement in Kentucky and \nhe sued the future custodian in the Western District of \nKentucky, where that custodian was located.    Id.  at \n444-45.    The Court held that the Western District had \njurisdiction because the custodian was properly served \n“in that district.”   Id. at 445 (quoting Braden, 410 U.S. \nat 500).    According to the  Padilla  Court, this decision \n“does not derogate from the traditional district of con-\nfinement rule for core habeas petitions challenging pre-\nsent physical custody” and, in fact,  Braden  cites favor-\nably to a case “squarely holding that the custodian’s ab-\nsence  from  the  territorial  jurisdiction  of  the  district \ncourt is fatal to habeas jurisdiction.”    Id.  at 445. \n  In  Strait, the petitioner was an Army reserve officer \nwho  was  physically  located  in  California.    Id.    He \nbrought a habeas action against the commanding officer \nof the Army records center, who was located in Indiana, \nasking the court to require the  Army to process his dis-\ncharge as a conscientious objector.    Id.    The respond-\nent objected to the filing of the action in California, as \nhe was not physically present in that state.    See id.   \nAs the  Padilla  Court explained, the  Strait  Court was \nconfined by the then-existing  Ahrens  rule, which “re-\nquired that both the petitioner and his custodian be pre-\nsent” in the district of suit.    Id.  at 446.    To fit Strait’s \nhabeas  petition  into  the  confines  of  this  rule,  the \nStrait  Court “invoke[d] concepts of personal jurisdic-\ntion to hold that the custodian was ‘present’ in California \nthrough the actions of his agents.”    Id.    Because the \n \n\n55a \n \nPadilla  Court had already held that Marr was the pro-\nper respondent and both Marr and Padilla were physi-\ncally present in South Carolina, the Court found “no oc-\ncasion” to engage in designation of nominal custodians \nor other such work-arounds.    Id. \n  Therefore, the Court held that the “proviso that dis-\ntrict courts may issue the writ only ‘within their respec-\ntive jurisdictions’ forms an important corollary to the \nimmediate custodian rule in challenges to present phys-\nical custody under  § 2241” and the two rules together \n“compose a simple rule”:    “Whenever a  § 2241  habeas \npetitioner seeks to challenge his present physical cus-\ntody within the United States, he should name his war-\nden as respondent and file the petition in the district of \nconfinement.”    Id.  at 447. \n  Although  Padilla  has some initial force, ultimately it \nfails to account for a key difference between this action \nand  Padilla.    In  Padilla, the petitioner was challeng-\ning his physical detention.    Although the Secretary of \nDefense exercised legal control over that detention and \nwould have been able to order Padilla’s release, the com-\nmander of the brig where Padilla was held also exercised \ncontrol  over  his  detention  and  could  release  him.   \nTherefore,  the  Padilla  Court’s  holding  is  more  pro-\nperly viewed as applying to situations where there are \nmultiple officials—some lower-level, such as the war-\nden, and some higher-level, such as the Secretary of   \nDefense—in the chain of custody, all of whom have the \ncapacity to order the requested relief:    the release of \nthe prisoner.    In such a context,  Padilla holds that the \npetitioner cannot have his pick of officials to sue; in-\nstead, he must sue his immediate custodian. \n \n\n56a \n \n  The  present  action  does  not  fit  into  this  context.   \nAlthough  there  are  a  variety  of  officials—including   \nthe Attorney General and the warden of the Florida   \nfacility—who could order Guzman Chavez’s release, she \nis not actually seeking release.    Instead, she is seeking \nan individualized bond hearing, relief which the warden \nis unable to provide.    Therefore, forcing her to sue the \nwarden would be an act of futility.    Even if she won a \njudgment requiring that a bond hearing be held, the \nwarden would not have any ability to provide the relief \nobtained.  Guzman Chavez Opp. 4.  The more logical rule \nis that an immigrant habeas petitioner must sue the war-\nden if and only if the warden can provide the requested \nrelief.    If the warden is unable to provide the relief, the \nimmigrant detainee may name as respondent any official \nwho is legally authorized to provide the relief requested.11 \n  In  addition  to  conforming  to  the  underlying  logic \nof Padilla, this result accords with the conclusion reached \nby the one in-circuit district court opinion to have fully \nconsidered  the  question.    See  Jarpa  v.  Mumford,   \n211 F. Supp. 3d 706 (D. Md. 2016)  (Xinis, J.),  appeal \nfiled, No. 16-7665 (4th Cir. Dec. 2, 2016).    In  Jarpa, the \npetitioner named as respondents both the warden of the \n                                                 \n11 Respondents appear at times to incorrectly characterize this as \na “core” habeas case where Guzman Chavez is challenging her “pre-\nsent physical confinement.”  Resp. Reply 3-4.  So characterized, \nGuzman Chavez’s petition seems bound by the “default rule” an-\nnounced in Padilla.  But in reality, Guzman Chavez is not challeng-\ning her present physical confinement; instead, she is challenging the \ndecision to confine her without giving her access to an individualized \nbond determination.  Characterized in this more precise way, Guz-\nman Chavez’s petition avoids the default Padilla rule and allows her \nto name as respondents the officials who can actually provide her a \nbond hearing. \n \n\n57a \n \nfacility where he was detained as well as various higher-\nlevel officials, including the Secretary of Homeland Se-\ncurity and the Attorney General.   Id. at 708.    The gov-\nernment moved to dismiss all of the respondents except \nthe warden, citing the immediate custodian rule.    Id. at \n723.    The court declined to apply the immediate custo-\ndian rule and dismiss the higher-level officials because \n“the relief sought can only practically be delivered by \nthe head of the agency in charge of interpreting and ex-\necuting the immigration laws,” id.  at 724; however, be-\ncause the petitioner sued the warden along with the \nhigher-level officials, the court did not have to decide \nwhether a petitioner can properly name only higher-\nlevel officials and not the appropriate warden.12 \n  The second question identified in  Padilla—whether \nthe  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  the  appropriate   \nrespondent(s)—involves determining whether the court \nshould use traditional “service of process” principles to \nanalyze jurisdiction or whether, as in  Padilla, a more \nlimited locational analysis is appropriate.    If the for-\nmer, the Court has jurisdiction over respondents.    If \nthe latter, the Court likely does not have jurisdiction \nover respondents, as neither Guzman Chavez nor any \n                                                 \n12 The briefing in Jarpa has been stayed pending the Supreme \nCourt’s resolution of Jennings v. Rodriguez, No. 15-1204, in which \ndetained aliens are arguing that the Constitution requires that aliens \nsubject to mandatory detention under the Immigration and Nation-\nality Act (“INA”) receive bond hearings if their detention reaches \nsix months.  Unlike petitioners in the present action, the Jarpa pe-\ntitioner included a due process claim that may be resolved by the \nSupreme Court’s decision in Jennings.  See 211 F. Supp. 3d at 710. \n \n\n58a \n \nproper  respondent  is  apparently  located  in  this  dis-\ntrict.13    Based on the principles laid out in  Padilla, a lo-\ncational analysis is appropriate:    the  Padilla  Court ex-\nplicitly rejected the “service of process” test and all of \nthe cases it cites involved petitions filed in districts with \nsome locational nexus to the petitioner or a respondent.   \nThe  hard  question  presented in some  of  those cases \narises when the proper respondent and the petitioner \nare  located  in  different  districts,  as  in  Braden  and \nStrait; however, even in those cases, the courts have lim-\nited themselves to finding jurisdiction appropriate ei-\nther where the petitioner resides (in  Strait) or where \nthe respondent is located (in  Braden).    Given the his-\ntorical focus on territoriality in habeas cases, as alluded \nto in  Padilla, as well as the fear respondents express \nthat an expansive rule would allow immigrant detainees \nto engage in forum shopping, this locational limitation is \nappropriate. \n  Therefore, in situations such as Guzman Chavez’s, \nwhere an immigrant detainee requesting a bond hearing \nis located in a different district from the officials who \nhave the ability to grant her a hearing, those officials are \nproper respondents but the detainee must file her peti-\ntion either where she is located or where the officials are \nlocated.    Filing a petition in a third district where nei-\nther the petitioner nor  any proper respondent is located \n                                                 \n13 Guzman Chavez, who is currently detained in Florida, identifies \nthe Attorney General and the Director of ICE as the two respond-\nents with authority to order a bond hearing.  Guzman Chavez Opp. \n5-6 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), 6 U.S.C. § 557).  Respondents do not \ncontest that position.  Although the habeas petition does not iden-\ntify a location for either the Attorney General or the Director of ICE, \nthe headquarters of both ICE and the Department of Justice are lo-\ncated in the District of Columbia. \n \n\n59a \n \ndoes not satisfy the limitation in the habeas statutes, \nwhich only allow courts to grant habeas petitions within \ntheir respective jurisdictions.    As such, respondents’ \nMotion to Dismiss in Part will be granted and petitioner \nGuzman Chavez’s claims will be dismissed without prej-\nudice. \n    C.  Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment \n  As both parties agree, all relevant facts in this action \nare undisputed and the resolution of the habeas petition \nturns on a pure question of law:    whether ICE’s author-\nity to detain petitioners arises from  8 U.S.C. § 1226, as \npetitioners contend, or  8 U.S.C. § 1231, as respondents \ncontend.    If petitioners are held under  § 1226, they are \nentitled to a bond hearing under  § 1226(a).    If petition-\ners are held under  § 1231, they are subject to manda-\ntory detention without a bond hearing.14    Petitioners \nrely on a Second Circuit opinion holding that aliens in \npetitioners’ position are detained under  § 1226(a)  and \nare entitled to bond hearings.    Guerra v. Shanahan,   \n831 F.3d 59 (2d Cir. 2016).    Respondents rely on Ninth \nCircuit  and  Eastern  District  of  Virginia  decisions   \nholding that detainees in petitioners’ position are de-\ntained  under §  1231 and  are  not  entitled  to  bond   \nhearings.    See  Padilla-Ramirez v. Bible, 862 F.3d 881 \n(9th Cir. 2017);  Crespin v. Evans, 256 F. Supp. 3d 641, \n                                                 \n14 The Supreme Court has recognized a limited due process right \nto release from mandatory detention in certain narrow circum-\nstances.  See Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001).  Petitioners \nhave expressly declined to pursue a Zadvydas-based due process \nclaim, although they have indicated that they may seek leave to \namend their petition to add such a claim as the length of their deten-\ntions increase.  See Pet. Reply [Dkt. No. 35] 16 n.8. \n \n\n60a \n \nNo. 1:17-cv-140, 2017 WL 2385330 (E.D. Va. May 31, \n2017),  appeal pending, No. 17-6835 (4th Cir.). \n  The context of petitioners’ detention and the legal \nclaims raised by both parties involve the nature of rein-\nstated final removal orders and the effect of withholding- \nonly proceedings on those orders, as well as the statutes \ngoverning detention during and after removal proceed-\nings. \n1.  Reinstated  Removal  Orders  and  Withholding-\nOnly Proceedings \n  When an alien who has been ordered removed from \nthe United States and has either been removed or de-\nparted voluntarily under the order of removal illegally \nreenters the country, the original order of removal “is re-\ninstated from its original date.”   8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5).   \nSuch an order “is not subject to being reopened or re-\nviewed” and the alien “may not apply for any relief” un-\nder the INA.    See id.    In general, this provision “fore-\ncloses discretionary relief from the terms of the rein-\nstated order,”  Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales, 548 U.S. \n30, 35 (2006); however, there is one exception to this rule.   \nCongress  has  provided,  consistent  with  the  United \nStates’s obligations under international law, that the At-\ntorney General may not remove an alien to a country \nwhere  the  alien’s  life  or  freedom  would  be  threat-\nened.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3).15   This restriction ap-\nplies even to aliens with reinstated removal orders.    See \n                                                 \n15 In addition to applying for withholding of removal under the \nstatutory provision, aliens may also apply for withholding of removal \nunder the Convention Against Torture.   The standards for with-\nholding are slightly different under the two provisions, but the pro-\ncess is the same.  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.16. \n \n\n61a \n \nid.    Therefore, although an alien cannot otherwise chal-\nlenge a reinstated removal order, he can seek protection \nfrom having that order executed to a particular country \nby initiating a withholding-only proceeding. \n  When an alien subject to a reinstated removal order \nexpresses a fear of removal to the country indicated in \nhis removal order, the Department of Homeland Secu-\nrity (“DHS”) refers the alien to an asylum officer for a \npre-withholding  screening  interview.    See  8  C.F.R.   \n§ 208.31(b).    If the asylum officer determines that the \nalien “has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture,” \nthe alien may apply for withholding of removal.    See id. \n§ 208.31(e).16 \n  If the alien passes this screening process, then the \nalien is permitted to apply for withholding or deferral17 \nof removal and the application goes to an IJ for an initial \nreview to determine whether the alien has met his bur-\nden.18    Should the burden be met, the IJ will grant the \n                                                 \n16 Alternatively, if the asylum officer determines that the alien has \nnot established a reasonable fear, the alien can appeal that decision \nto an immigration judge (“IJ”).  Id. § 203.31(f ).  If the IJ agrees \nwith the asylum officer, the process ends (there is no appeal) and \nDHS will execute the reinstated removal order.  Id. § 203.31(g)(1).  \nIf, on the other hand, the IJ finds the alien has established a reason-\nable fear of persecution or torture, then the alien may apply for with-\nholding of removal.  Id. § 203.31(g)(2). \n17 Under § 1231(b)(3), an alien applies for “withholding” of re-\nmoval.  Under the Convention Against Torture, an alien applies for \n“withholding or deferral” of removal.  The difference is not relevant \nto this action. \n18 Under § 1231(b)(3), the alien bears the burden of establishing \nthat “his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed \ncountry of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, member-\nship in a particular social group, or political opinion.”   8 C.F.R.  \n \n\n62a \n \nalien’s request for deferral or withholding of removal; \nhowever, if the IJ determines that the alien has not met \nhis burden, the alien may appeal that determination to \nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) and, ulti-\nmately, to a federal court of appeals.    In these “with-\nholding-only” proceedings, the only issue is whether the \nalien is entitled to withholding or deferral of removal; \nthe alien may not collaterally attack the underlying re-\nmoval order.    See id.  § 208.2(c)(3)(i). \n  In this litigation, each petitioner has passed the ini-\ntial screening process, has applied for withholding of re-\nmoval, and is in the process of applying to an IJ for an \ninitial review of whether withholding or deferral of re-\nmoval should be granted or, in the case of Flores Romero, \nis appealing the IJ’s adverse initial determination. \n  2.  Statutes Governing Alien Detention \n  There are two separate provisions in the INA that \ngive the government authority to detain aliens during \nremoval proceedings or while awaiting the execution of \nan order of removal.    When an alien is first arrested, \nhe or she is detained under  8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), which \nallows DHS to “arrest[ ] and detain[ ]” the person “pend-\ning a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from \nthe United States.”    Under this section, the alien may \nbe released on bond; however, once the “removal pe-\nriod”  begins,  the  authority  for  detention  shifts  to \n                                                 \n§ 208.16(b).  To quality for protection under the Convention Against \nTorture, the alien bears the burden of showing it is “more likely than \nnot that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed coun-\ntry of removal.”  Id. § 208.16(c). \n \n\n63a \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1231.    The “removal period,” which is typi-\ncally a 90-day period19  in which the alien ought to be re-\nmoved,  begins  on  the  latest  of  three  dates:    (1) \nthe  “date  the  order  of  removal  becomes  administra-\ntively final”; (2) the “date of the court’s final order” if \n“the removal order is judicially reviewed” and “a court \norders a stay of the removal of the alien”; or (3) the “date \nthe alien is released from detention or confinement” if \n“the alien is detained or confined (except under an im-\nmigration process).”    Id. § 1231(a)(1)(B).    During the \n“removal period,” DHS “shall detain the alien.”    Id. \n§ 1231(a)(2). \n  3.  Regulations Addressing Detention \n  Respondents argue that DHS regulations, which de-\nserve deference under  Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural \nResources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837 (1984),20  pro-\nvide that aliens in petitioners’ position are detained un-\nder  § 1231.    Respondents primarily argue two points \nhere.    First, they contend that because under 8 C.F.R.   \n                                                 \n19 There are some circumstances in which the removal period may \nbe extended beyond 90 days.  At a certain point after these 90 days, \ndue process protections may require a bond hearing or the release \nof the alien.  Cf. Zadvydas, 533 U.S. 678.  To implement these pro-\ntections, DHS has instituted regulations governing post-removal-or-\nder custody reviews.  See 8 C.F.R. § 241.4.  These regulations are \nnot at issue in this action. \n20 Respondents also make a brief reference to Auer v. Robbins, \n519 U.S. 452 (1997).  Resp. Reply 18.  To the extent respondents are \narguing that their interpretation of these regulations should be given \ndeference  under Auer, their  argument  is  rejected.    See  Guerra,  \n831 F.3d at 64 (“An agency may not convert an issue of statutory \ninterpretation into one of deference to an agency’s interpretation of \nits own regulations simply by pointing to the existence of regulations \nwhose relevance is tenuous at best.”). \n \n\n64a \n \n§  241.8(e),  a  removal  order  is  reinstated  before  the   \nwithholding-only proceedings begin, individuals in peti-\ntioners’ position are subject to a final removal order.   \nResp. Mem. 25.  Second, they argue that § 241.8(f)  states \n \nthat “[e]xecution of the reinstated order of removal and \ndetention of the alien shall be administered in accord-\nance with this part” and that Part 241 clearly lines up \nwith § 1231.    Id. at 25-26.21 \n  These regulations do not answer the question raised \nby petitioners,  see  Padilla-Ramirez, 862 F.3d at 885; \nGuerra, 831 F.3d at 63;  Crespin, 2017 WL 2385330, at \n*6  n.17,  because it is  not clear  from  the  regulations \nwhether § 241.8(f)  even applies to individuals who have \n \napplied for withholding of removal.    The immediately \nprior subsection, § 241.8(e), provides an “[e]xception” \nfor such individuals by directing that aliens who express \na fear of removal should be “immediately referred to an \nasylum officer for an interview to determine whether the \nalien has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture pur-\nsuant to  § 208.31  of this chapter.”    Therefore, to the \nextent that respondents believe the process of detention \n                                                 \n21 Respondents also state, without further elaboration:  “[T]he reg-\nulation at § 241.4(b)(3) provides that even an alien who is granted \nwithholding of removal is subject to the final-removal-order deten-\ntion provisions of § 1231(a)(6).”  Resp. Mem. 26.  Although respond-\nents do not construct a full argument from this provision, it is worth \nnoting  that §  241.4(b)(3) only  provides  that  individuals  granted \nwithholding of removal “who are otherwise subject to detention are \nsubject to the provisions of this part.”  Even assuming that being \n“subject to the provisions of this part” means these individuals may \ncontinue to be detained under § 1231, the regulation is inapposite \nbecause it only applies to individuals who are “otherwise subject to \ndetention” (for example, criminal aliens). \n \n\n65a \n \nand removal proceeds sequentially through the chap-\nters, § 241.8(e) provides a detour out of Part 241 for in-\ndividuals in withholding-only proceedings.    Moreover, \nthe only sections in Part 241 that even discuss detention \nare § 241.3-.4.    Section 241.3 provides that  “[o]nce the \nremoval period    .  .  .    begins, an alien in the United \nStates will be taken into custody pursuant to the war-\nrant of removal,” while  § 241.4 provides for detention of \ncertain aliens “beyond the removal period.”    Applica-\ntion of both of these sections would “beg the very ques-\ntion[  ]  at  issue,”  Padilla-Ramirez,  862  F.3d  at  885:   \nwhether aliens in withholding-only proceedings are in \nthe  “removal  period.”    Therefore,  in  the  absence  of \nmore specific  regulations clarifying the meaning of “re-\nmoval period” and the effect of withholding-only pro-\nceedings on the removal period, respondents’ position \ncannot be given deference under  Chevron. \n  4.  The Source of Authority to Detain Petitioners \n  The  legal  question  presented  by  petitioners  boils \ndown to a deceptively simple question:    Are petitioners \ndetained under  8 U.S.C. § 1226(a)  or under  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1231?22    Both parties employ a variety of statutory in-\nterpretation techniques to answer this question.    In the \nend, although respondents’ arguments have some force, \n                                                 \n22 Respondents appear to believe that the relevant question in this \ncase is simply whether petitioners’ removal orders are “administra-\ntively final”; if so, then the “removal period” has begun under  \n§ 1231 and petitioners are detained under that section.  See Resp. \nReply 5; see also Padilla-Ramirez, 862 F.3d at 884 (“The question \nbefore us, then, is whether Padilla-Ramirez's reinstated removal or-\nder is administratively final.”).  Although administrative finality is \nthe relevant dividing line in § 1231, the Court must analyze both \n§ 1226 and § 1231 and attempt to harmonize the two statutes ra-\nther than unduly focusing on the § 1231 provisions. \n \n\n66a \n \nthe text, structure, and intent of the INA compel the \nconclusion that petitioners are detained under 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1226(a). \n  Beginning with the statutory text, § 1226(a) governs \ndetention for an alien “detained pending a decision on \nwhether the alien is to be removed from the United \nStates.”    As an initial matter, this text governs peti-\ntioners’ detention because until withholding-only pro-\nceedings are complete, a decision has not been made on \nwhether they will in fact be removed from the United \nStates.    See  Pet. Mem. [Dkt. No. 20] 10-11.    As peti-\ntioners argue, § 1226(a)  focuses not on a determination \nof removability (which has already been made) but in-\nstead on a more concrete determination of whether pe-\ntitioners will actually be removed—a determination that \nhas not yet been made in petitioners’ cases.    See id.    As \nsuch, until the government determines that there is a \ncountry to which petitioners can legally be removed, the \ndecision on whether they are “to be removed” remains \n“pending,” and  § 1226(a)  governs their detention. \n  This conclusion is reinforced by the statutory struc-\nture of the INA and evidence of Congress’s intent.    Sec-\ntion 1231 provides that the removal period will begin on \nthe latest of three dates:    the date the removal order \nbecomes final, the date any judicial stay stopping re-\nmoval is lifted, or the date the alien is released from non-\nimmigration detention.    8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(B).    As \npetitioners explain, each of these three preconditions \nsimply relates to a different legal impediment to actual \nremoval:    either DHS has not completed its own re-\nmoval process (the order is not final) or the judicial \nbranch has deprived DHS of authority to execute the re-\nmoval process (a judicial stay stopping removal is in \n \n\n67a \n \nplace) or the criminal authorities, rather than ICE, have \ncustody of the individual and ICE does not have juris-\ndiction to remove the noncitizen (the alien is in non-im-\nmigration  detention).    In  each  situation,  DHS  may \nhave already determined that the noncitizen is, like pe-\ntitioners here, removable, but ICE lacks the present and \nfinal legal authority to actually execute that order of re-\nmoval. \n  Moreover,  Congress  clearly  intended  to  have  \n§ 1231  govern only the final logistical period, in which \nthe government has actual authority to remove the alien \nand need only schedule and execute the deportation.   \nCongress has specifically limited the normal “removal \nperiod” to 90 days, a limitation that makes sense if the \nremoval period is only meant to govern the final logisti-\ncal steps of physically removing an alien.    Based on the \nlength of petitioners’  detentions to date, it is obvious \nthat  withholding-only  proceedings  take  substantially \nlonger than 90 days.    As such, it would be contrary to \ncongressional intent to shoehorn a class of aliens whose \nproceedings will typically far exceed 90 days into the \n“removal period” for which Congress has specifically in-\ntended a 90-day limit. \n  Background legal principles of finality also support \npetitioners’ view.    The INA limits judicial review to a \n“final order of removal,” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1), and aliens \nmay appeal adverse decisions in withholding-only pro-\nceedings only “as part of the review of a final order of \nremoval,”  id.  § 1231  note (d).    Addressing these stat-\nutes, many courts have held that a reinstated removal \norder is not final for purposes of judicial review until af-\nter the adjudication of any withholding applications, an \n \n\n68a \n \ninterpretation  the  government  has  itself  en-\ndorsed.   See Pet. Mem. 16 (collecting cases).23   It would \nbe nonsensical to adopt a “bifurcated definition of final-\nity” with respect to removal orders in withholding-only \nproceedings.    Guerra, 831 F.3d at 63.    As such, the \nCourt must conclude that reinstated removal orders do \nnot  become  “administratively  final”  for  purposes  of  \n§ 1231 until they are final for purposes of appellate re-\nview. \n  Moving beyond the INA context, principles of admin-\nistrative law support the conclusion that a reinstated re-\nmoval order is not final until after the conclusion of any \nwithholding-only proceedings.    See  Pet. Mem. 17.    In \nagency law, finality is generally achieved when an action \nboth “mark[s] the consummation of the agency’s deci-\nsionmaking process” and also determines legal rights or \nobligations.    Id.  at  18  (quoting  Bennett  v.  Spear,   \n520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997)).    In this case, although some \nlegal rights or obligations have already been determined \n(the petitioners are removable), the decisionmaking pro-\ncess is ongoing—i.e., it has not been consummated—as \nthe  agency  is  still  determining  whether  petitioners   \nwill be granted withholding of removal or will be re-\nmoved.    See id.    As such, under principles of adminis-\ntrative law, petitioners’ removal orders are not “final”; \n                                                 \n23 Respondents argue that the Fourth Circuit has held that a rein-\nstated removal order’s date of finality is the date of the original entry \nof the order of removal, Resp. Reply 17 (citing Mejia, 866 F.3d 573); \nhowever,  that  case  involved  the  date  of  finality  for  determining \nwhether a challenge to the underlying removal order was timely.  It \nis not clear how the Fourth Circuit would analyze finality dates in the \ncontext of a challenge to the eventual withholding-only proceedings. \n \n\n69a \n \ntherefore,  petitioners  are  being  detained  under  \n§ 1226(a). \n  Respondents’ arguments to the contrary are unavail-\ning.    First, they argue that the text of  § 1226(a)  sup-\nports their position because petitioners’ removal orders \nhave already been reinstated; as such, the decision on \nwhether petitioners are “to be removed” is no longer \n“pending.”    Resp. Mem. 16-17.    In addition, they ar-\ngue that there is no legal requirement that they amend \nthe final removal order if they wish to remove petition-\ners to a third country.    Id. at 20.    Therefore, because \nrespondents may “immediately remove” petitioners “to \na third country based on their reinstated orders with-\nout”  any  “additional  proceedings,  the  reinstated  re-\nmoval  orders  must  necessarily  be  final.”    Id.    This \nreasoning is incomplete.    Although DHS may eventu-\nally be able to remove petitioners to some third country \neven if their application for withholding of removal is \ngranted, third-country removal would require additional \nproceedings.    At the least, DHS would be required to \ngive petitioners notice and the opportunity for a hear-\ning.    Pet. Mem. 12.24    Moreover, the provision allow-\ning for the removal of detainees to additional countries, \n                                                 \n24 The parties argue about whether the government can deport an \nalien to a third country without amending the removal order and \nwhether an IJ who grants withholding of removal has the authority \nto alter the actual underlying removal order.  See Pet. Mem. 12; \nResp. Mem. 19-20; Resp. Reply 9-12.  Respondents are correct that \nan IJ in withholding-only proceedings does not have the authority to \namend the underlying removal order, see 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5); In \nre Balbi, 2006 WL 3203536 (BIA Oct. 2, 2006), and that the govern-\nment has the ability to deport an alien in withholding-only proceed-\nings to a country not specified in the removal order, see 8 C.F.R.  \n§ 1240.12(d).  At the same time, petitioners are correct that DHS \n \n\n70a \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(2), places “sharp limitations on the \ncountries”  that  the  government  may  designate  for   \nremoval—and respondents have not shown that there \nare any countries that meet those limitations for peti-\ntioners.    Pet. Reply 5.    Finally, as a practical matter, \nthe United States of America generally cannot simply  sua \nsponte deport an alien to a country where he or she does \nnot have citizenship; instead, the government must typ-\nically  get  permission  to  deport  from  the  third  coun-\ntry.    Cf.  Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 684 (explaining that the \ngovernment could not deport the petitioner to Germany, \nLithuania, or the Dominican Republic despite his ties to \nthose countries because those countries would not accept \nhim).    As such, it is not clear at the present time that \npetitioners are in fact “to be removed” from the United \nStates.    All that is clear is that they are removable. \n  Turning to the text of  § 1231(a)(5), respondents ar-\ngue that the provision makes clear that the removal pe-\nriod has begun for petitioners.    Because a reinstated \nremoval order “is not subject to being reopened or re-\nviewed,” respondents argue that petitioners’ removal \norders are “administratively final” and petitioners are \ndetained under § 1231.    Resp. Mem. 14.    This argument \nis unpersuasive.    Although the INA indicates that rein-\nstated removal orders are final in the ordinary case, \nother regulatory provisions that bear more closely on \nwithholding-only proceedings emphasize that aliens in \nthese proceeds are situated differently from the ordi-\n                                                 \ncould not immediately remove petitioners to a third country, as DHS \nwould first need to give petitioners notice and the opportunity to \nraise any reasonable fear claims.  Cf. Kossov v. INS, 132 F.3d 405, \n408-09 (7th Cir. 1998). \n \n\n71a \n \nnary alien subject to a reinstated removal order.    For ex-\nample, as discussed above, 8 C.F.R. § 241.8(e)  provides \nan “[e]xception” to the reinstatement-of-removal regu-\nlations when an alien applies for withholding of removal.   \nIn addition, the text of § 1231(a)(5) does not squarely \nanswer the question presented.    Indeed,  § 1231(a)(5) \ndoes  not even  mention  withholding-only  proceedings, \nmuch less does it speak clearly to the source of the au-\nthority to detain individuals in those proceedings. \n  Respondents emphasize that the INA dictates that \nan order of deportation “shall become final” once the \nBIA affirms it or the time for seeking BIA review of the \norder runs out.    8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(47)(B);  see  Resp. \nReply 6.    They go on to argue that because petitioners \ncannot seek BIA review of their underlying removal or-\nder, the order is administratively final.    This argument \nis not especially persuasive.    As even respondents rec-\nognize, finality may have different meanings in different \ncontexts.    The INA definition respondents point to de-\nfines “final,” but § 1231(a)(5) speaks of orders that are \n“administratively final.”    The addition of the modifier \n“administratively” indicates that Congress intended for \nfinality in the § 1231(a)(5) context to mean something \ndifferent from finality in the normal § 1101(a)(47)(B) con-\ntext.    If Congress intended for the meanings of the two \nprovisions to be the same, it presumably would have \nused the same unqualified word “final.” \nIII.    CONCLUSION \n  All told, this petition presents a difficult question of \nstatutory interpretation.    Although respondents’ argu-\nments have some merit, petitioners’ position, which at-\ntempts to harmonize § 1226  and § 1231  by locating the \ndividing line between the two sections as the moment \n \n\n72a \n \nwhen the government has final legal authority to remove \nthe alien, better accords with the text, structure, and in-\ntent of the relevant provisions.    Accordingly, the Court \nconcludes that petitioners are detained under § 1226(a), \nnot § 1231, and therefore are entitled to individualized \nbond hearings. \n  For the reasons stated above, respondents’ Motion to \nDismiss in Part will be granted, petitioners’ Motion for \nSummary Judgment will be granted, and respondents’ \nMotion for Summary Judgment will be denied by an ap-\npropriate Order to be issued with this Memorandum \nOpinion. \n  Entered this [17th] day of Nov., 2017. \n \nAlexandria, Virginia \n                  /s/  LMB                                       \n                LEONIE M.

For the reasons that \nfollow, petitioners’ motions will be granted and respond-\nents’ motions will be denied.   \nI.    BACKGROUND \n  Petitioners Rogelio Amilcar Cabrera Diaz (“Cabrera \nDiaz”), Jennry Francisco Moran Barrera (“Moran Bar-\nrera”), and Rodolfo Eduardo Rivers Flamenco (“Rivera \nFlamenco”) (collectively, “petitioners”) have filed a class \n \n\n74a \n \naction  habeas  corpus  petition  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.   \n§ 2241, seeking class action certification and an order di-\nrecting respondents Russell Hott (“Hott”), the Field Of-\nfice Director for U.S. Immigration and Customs En-\nforcement  (“ICE”),  and  Jefferson  B.  Sesssions,  III \n(“Sessions”), the Attorney General of the United States \nof America, (collectively, “respondents”) to grant the \nclass members bond hearings. \n  The relevant facts are simple and undisputed.    Each \nindividual petitioner has been removed from the United \nStates under an order of removal.    Second Am. Pet. \nFor Writ of Habeas Corpus [Dkt. No. 4] ¶¶ 13, 19, 23.   \nWhen each petitioner  returned  to his  native  country \n(two of the petitioners are from El Salvador and one if \nfrom Honduras), he received death threats.    Id. ¶¶ 14, \n20, 24.    As a result, each petitioner returned to the \nUnited States without permission from the appropriate \nauthorities.    Id. ¶¶ 15, 20, 25.    Each petitioner has \nbeen issued a Notice of Intent/Decision to Reinstate \nPrior Order, which reinstated the prior order of removal \nand rendered him deportable, and each has been de-\ntained  by  ICE  at  Immigration  Centers  of  America-\nFarmville (in Farmville, Virginia) since such issuance.   \nId. ¶¶ 17, 21-22, 25.    Each petitioner has expressed a \nfear of returning to his native country and, after either \nan asylum officer or an immigration judge (“IJ”) deter-\nmined that he had a reasonable fear of persecution or \ntorture, he was placed in withholding-only proceedings, \nwhich remain pending.    Id. ¶¶ 18, 22, 26.       \n  Petitioners  believe  that  they,  and  other  detainees \nwho are similarly in withholding-only proceedings, are \nentitled  under  the  Immigration  and  Nationality  Act \n(“INA”)  to  bond  hearings,  because  they  believe  that   \n \n\n75a \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1226, not 8 U.S.C. § 1231, provides the source \nof authority for their detention.    Id. ¶¶ 41-44.    This \nCourt has agreed.    See Romero v. Evans,        F. Supp. \n3d      , No. 1:17-cv-754, 2017 WL 5560659 (E.D. Va. Nov. \n17, 2017).    Accordingly, petitioners seek to represent a \nclass of all individuals: \nwho are in ‘withholding-only proceedings, having es-\ntablished a reasonable fear of persecution or torture, \nand such proceedings are not administratively final, \nor if final, a stay of removal has been granted by a \nU.S. Court of Appeals, and   \nwho, as of the time of filing the initial pleading in this \ncase or at any time thereafter, are detained by, or on \nthe authority of, U.S. Immigration and Customs En-\nforcement, within the state of Virginia. \n  Id. ¶ 47.    Respondents disagree that class certifica-\ntion is appropriate and that petitioners are being held \npursuant to § 1226.    Accordingly, petitioners have filed \na Motion for Class Certification [Dkt. No. 11] and each \nparty has filed a Motion for Summary Judgment [Dkt. \nNos. 16 & 21].   \nII.    DISCUSSION \n    A.  Standard of Review   \n  A party is entitled to summary judgment if the party \ncan show “that there is no genuine dispute as to any ma-\nterial fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law.”    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).    A genuine dis-\npute of material fact exists “if the evidence is such that \na reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmov-\ning party.”    Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. \n242, 249 (1986).    In general, bare allegations or asser-\n \n\n76a \n \ntions by the nonmoving party are not sufficient to gen-\nerate a genuine dispute; instead, the nonmoving party \nmust produce “significantly probative” evidence to avoid \nsummary  judgment.    Abcor  Corp.  v.  AM  Int’l,  Inc.,   \n916 F.2d 924, 929-30 (4th Cir. 1990) (quoting Anderson, \n477 U.S. at 242).    That being said, in ruling on a motion \nfor summary judgment, a court should accept the evi-\ndence of the nonmovant, and all justifiable inferences \nmust be drawn in her favor.    Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255. \n  Class certification is appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23 if petitioners can show that there are sufficiently \nnumerous parties (“numerosity”); there are questions of \nlaw or fact common to the class (“commonality”); the \nclaims or defenses of the named petitioners are typical \nof the claims or defenses of the class (“typicality”); and \nthe named petitioners will fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the class (“adequacy”).    In addition, a \nproposed class must qualify under Rule 23(b)(1), (2), or \n(3).    Petitioners seek certification under Rule 23(b)(2), \nwhich permits certification where “the party opposing \nthe class has acted or refused to act on grounds that ap-\nply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief \nor corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate re-\nspecting the class as a whole.”    Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).   \nB.  Summary Judgment \n  As both parties agree, all relevant facts in this action \nare undisputed and the resolution of the habeas petition \nturns on a pure question of law:    whether ICE’s author-\nity to detain petitioners arises from 8 U.S.C. § 1226, as \npetitioners contend, or 8 U.S.C. § 1231, as respondents \ncontend.    If petitioners are held under § 1226, they are \nentitled to a bond hearing under § 1226(a) unless the \ngovernment determines that they are criminal aliens \n \n\n77a \n subject to mandatory detention under § 1226(c).1    If pe-\ntitioners are held under § 1231, they are subject to man-\ndatory detention without a bond hearing.2    Petitioners \nrely on an opinion from this Court, as well as a Second \nCircuit opinion, holding that aliens in petitioners’ posi-\ntion are detained under § 1226 and are entitled to bond \nhearings.    See Romero, F. Supp. 3d, 2017 WL 5560659, \nappeal pending, No. 18-6086 (4th Cir.); see also Guerra \nv. Shanahan, 831 F.3d 59 (2d Cir. 2016).    Respondents \nrely on Ninth Circuit and Eastern District of Virginia \ndecisions holding that detainees in petitioners’ position \nare detained under § 1231 and are not entitled to bond \nhearings.    See Padilla-Ramirez v. Bible, 862 F.3d 881 \n(9th Cir. 2017); Crespin v. Evans, 256 F. Supp. 3d 641, \nNo. 1:17-cv-140, 2017 WL 2385330 (E.D. Va. May 31, \n2017), appeal dismissed as moot, No. 17-6835 (4th Cir. \nFeb. 23, 2018).3 \n                                                 \n1  A petitioner classified as a criminal alien under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c) \nwould have the opportunity to challenge his classification in a hear-\ning conducted under In re Joseph, 22 I. & N. Dec. 799 (BIA 1999), \nwhich gives an alien allegedly subject to mandatory detention the \nability to seek a “bond ruling as to whether the alien is properly in-\ncluded in a mandatory detention category” from an IJ, id. at 800 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). \n2  The Supreme Court has recognized a limited due process right \nto release from mandatory detention in certain narrow circum-\nstances.  See Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001).  Petitioners \nhave declined to pursue a Zadvydas-based due process claim. \n3  At oral argument, counsel explained to the Court that the peti-\ntioner in Crespin was granted withholding of removal and was re-\nleased from custody, which mooted Crespin before the Fourth Cir-\ncuit could decide the appeal.  Similarly, counsel explained that each \nof the three original petitioners in Romero has concluded withholding- \nonly proceedings and that the appeal in that action will be moot once \n \n\n78a \n \n  The context of petitioners’ detention and the legal \nclaims raised by both parties involve the nature of rein-\nstates final removal orders and the effect of withholding- \nonly proceeding on those orders, as well as the statutes \ngoverning detention during and after removal proceed-\nings.   \n    1.  Reinstated Removal Orders and Withholding-\nOnly Proceedings \n  When an alien who has been ordered removed from \nthe United States and has either been removed or de-\nparted voluntarily under the order of removal illegally \nreenters the country, the original order of removal “as \nreinstated from its original date.”    8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5).   \nSuch an order “is not subject to being reopened or re-\nviewed” and the alien “may not apply for any relief” \nfrom that order under the INA.    See id.    In general, \nthis provision “forecloses discretionary relief from the \nterms  of  the  reinstated  order,”  Fernandez-Vargas  v. \nGonzales, 548 U.S. 30, 35 (2006); however, there is one \nexception to this rule.    Congress has provided, consis-\ntent with the United States’s obligations under interna-\ntional law, that the Attorney General may not remove an \nalien to a country where the alien’s life or freedom would \nbe threatened.    See 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3).4    This re-\nstriction applies even to aliens with reinstated removal \norders.    See id.    Therefore, although an alien cannot \n                                                 \nthe IJ in the remaining petitioner’s withholding-only proceedings \nformally enters an Order granting him relief. \n4 In addition to applying for withholding of removal under the stat-\nutory provision, aliens may also apply for withholding of removal un-\nder the Convention Against Torture.  The standards for withhold-\ning are slightly different under the two provisions, but the process \nis the same.  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.16. \n \n\n79a \n \notherwise challenge a reinstated removal order, he can \nseek protection from having that order executed to a \nparticular country by initiating a withholding-only pro-\nceeding.   \n  When an alien subject to a reinstates removal order \nexpresses a fear of removal to the country indicated in \nhis removal order, the Department of Homeland Secu-\nrity (“DHS”) refers the alien to an asylum officer for a \npre-withholding  screening  interview.    See  8  C.F.R.   \n§ 208.31(b).    If the asylum officer determines that the \nalien “has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture,” \nthe alien may apply for withholding of removal.    See id.   \n§ 208.31(e).5     \n  If the alien passes this screening process, then the \nalien is permitted to apply for withholding or deferral6 \nof removal and the application goes to an IJ for an initial \nreview to determine whether the alien has met his bur-\nden.7    Should the burden  be  met, the IJ will grant   \n                                                 \n5 Alternatively, if the asylum officer determines that the alien has \nnot established a reasonable fear, the alien can appeal that decision \nto an IJ.  Id. § 203.31(f ).  If the IJ agrees with the asylum officer, \nthe process ends (there is no appeal) and DHS will execute the rein-\nstated removal order.  Id. § 203.31(g)(1).  If, on the other hand, the \nIJ finds the alien has established a reasonable fear of persecution or \ntorture, then the alien may apply for withholding of removal.  Id.  \n§ 203.31(g)(2). \n6 Under § 1231(b)(3), an alien applies for “withholding” of removal.  \nUnder the Convention Against Torture, an alien applies for “with-\nholding or deferral” of removal.  The difference is not relevant to \nthis action. \n7 Under § 1231(b)(3), the alien bears the burden of establishing \nthat “his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed \ncountry of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, member-\nship in a particular social group, or political opinion.”    8 C.F.R.  \n \n\n80a \n \nthe alien’s request for deferral or withholding of re-\nmoval; however, if the IJ determines that the alien has \nnot met his burden, the alien may appeal that determi-\nnation to the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) \nand, ultimately, to a federal court of appeals.    In these \n“withholding-only” proceedings, the only issue is whether \nthe alien is entitled to withholding or deferral of re-\nmoval; the alien may not collaterally attack the underly-\ning removal order.    See id. § 208.2(c)(3)(i). \n  In this litigation, each petitioner has passed the ini-\ntial screening process, has applied for withholding of re-\nmoval, and is in the process of applying to an IJ for an \ninitial review of whether withholding or deferral of re-\nmoval should be granted. \n    2.  Statutes Governing Alien Detention \n  There are two separate provisions in the INA that \ngive the government authority to detain aliens during \nremoval proceedings or while awaiting the execution of \nan order or removal.    When an alien is first arrested, \nhe or she is detained under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), which al-\nlows DHS to “arrest[] and detain[]” the person “pending \na decision on whether the alien is to be removed from \nthe United States.”    Under this section, the alien may be \nreleased on bond;8  however, once the removal period” be-\ngins,  the  authority  for  detention  shifts  to  8  U.S.C.   \n                                                 \n§ 208.16(b).  To qualify for protection under the Convention Against \nTorture, the alien bears the burden of showing it is “more likely than \nnot that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed coun-\ntry of removal.”  Id. § 208.16(c). \n8 As discussed above, Congress has provided for mandatory deten-\ntion for some aliens with certain criminal convictions who would oth-\nerwise be detained under § 1226(a) and entitled to a bond hearing.  \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c). \n \n\n81a \n \n§ 1231.    The “removal period,” which is typically a 90-\nday period9  in which the alien ought to be removed, be-\ngins on the latest of three dates:    (1) the “date the or-\nder of removal becomes administratively final”; (2) the \n“dated of the court’s final order” if “the removal order \nis judicially reviewed” and “a court orders a stay of the \nremoval of the alien’” or (3) the “date the alien is re-\n \nleased from detention or confinement” if “the alien is de-\ntained or confined (except under an immigration pro-\ncess).”    Id. § 1231(a)(1)(B).    During the “removal pe-\nriod,” DHS “shall detain the alien.”    Id. § 1231(a)(2). \n3.  The Source of Authority to Detain Petitioners \n  The  legal  question  presented  by  petitioners  boils \ndown to a deceptively simple question:    Are petitioners \ndetained under 8 U.S.C. § 1231?10    Both parties employ \na variety of statutory interpretation techniques to an-\nswer this question.    In the end, although respondents’ \n                                                 \n9 There are some circumstances in which the removal period may \nbe extended beyond 90 days.  At a certain point after these 90 days, \ndue process protections may require a bond hearing or the release \nof the alien.  Cf. Zadvydas, 533 U.S. 678.  To implement these pro-\ntections, DHS has instituted regulations governing post-removal-order \ncustody reviews.  See 8 C.F.R. § 241.4.  These regulations are not \nat issue in this action. \n10 Respondents appear to believe that the relevant question in this \ncase is simply whether petitioners’ removal orders are “administra-\ntively final”; if so, then the removal period has begun under § 1231 \nand petitioners are detained under that section.  See Resp. Mem. \n[Dkt. No. 22] 12; see also Padilla–Ramirez, 862 F.3d at 884 (“The \nquestion before us, then, is whether Padilla–Ramirez’s reinstated re-\nmoval order is administratively final.”).  Although administrative \nfinality is the relevant dividing line in § 1231, the Court must analyze \nboth § 1226 and § 1231 and attempt to harmonize the two statutes \nrather than unduly focusing on the § 1231 provisions. \n \n\n82a \n \narguments have some force, the text, structure, and in-\ntent of the INA compel the conclusion that petitioners \nare detained under 8 U.S.C. § 1226. \n  Beginning with the statutory text, § 1226(a) governs \ndetention for an alien “detained pending a decision on \nwhether the alien is to be removed from the United \nStates.”    As an initial matter, this text governs peti-\ntioners’ detention because until withholding-only pro-\nceedings are complete, a decision has not been made on \nwhether petitioners will in fact be removed from the \nUnited States.    See Pet. Mem. [Dkt. No. 17] 6.    As pe-\ntitioners argue, § 1226(a) focuses not on a determination \nof removability (which has already been made) but in-\nstead on a more concrete determination of whether pe-\ntitioners will actually be removed—a determination that \nhas not yet been made in petitioners’ cases.    See id.   \nAs such, until the government determines that there is \na country to which petitioners can legally be removed, \nthe decision on whether they are “to be removed” re-\nmains “pending,” and § 1226(a) governs their detention. \n  This conclusion is reinforced by the statutory struc-\nture  of  the  INA  and  evidence  of  Congress’s  intent.   \nSection 1231 provides that the removal period will begin \non the latest of three dates:    the date the removal order \nbecomes final, the date any judicial stay stopping re-\nmoval is lifted, or the date the alien is released from non-\nimmigration detention.    8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(B).    As \npetitioners explain, each of these three preconditions \nsimply relates to a different legal impediment to actual \nremoval:    either DHS has not completed its own removal \nprocess (the order is not final) or the judicial branch has \ndeprived DHS of authority to execute the removal pro-\ncess (a judicial stay stopping removal is in place) or the \n \n\n83a \n \ncriminal authorities, rather than ICE, have custody of \nthe individual and ICE does not have jurisdiction to re-\nmove the noncitizen (the alien is in non-immigration de-\ntention).    In each situation, DHS may have already de-\ntermined that the noncitizen is, like petitioners here, re-\nmovable, but ICE lacks the present and final legal au-\nthority to actually execute that order of removal. \n  Moreover, Congress clearly intended to have § 1231 \ngovern only the final logistical period, in which the gov-\nernment has actual authority to remove the alien and \nneed only schedule and execute the deportation.    Con-\ngress has specifically limited the normal “removal pe-\nriod” to 90 days, a limitation that makes sense if the re-\nmoval period is only meant to govern the final logistical \nsteps of physically removing an alien.    Based on the \nlength of petitioners’ detentions to date, see Second Am. \nPet. ¶¶ 17, 21, 25, it is obvious that withholding-only pro-\nceedings take substantially longer than 90 days.    As \nsuch, it would be contrary to congressional intent to \nshoehorn a class of aliens whose proceedings will typi-\ncally far exceed 90 days into the “removal period” for \nwhich Congress has specifically intended a 90-day limit. \n  Background legal principles of finality also support \npetitioners’ view.    The INA limits judicial review to a \n“final order of removal,” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1), and aliens \nmay appeal adverse decisions in withholding-only pro-\nceedings only “as part of the review of a final order of \nremoval,” id. § 1231 note (d).    Addressing these stat-\nutes, many courts have held that a reinstated removal \norder is not final for purposes of judicial review until af-\nter the adjudication of any withholding applications, and \ninterpretation  the  government  has  itself  endorsed.   \n \n\n84a \n See Pet. Mem. 7.11    It would be nonsensical to adopt a \n“bifurcated  definition  of  finality”  with  respect  to  re-\nmoval orders in withholding-only proceedings.    Guerra, \n831 F.3d at 63.    As such, the Court concludes that rein-\nstated removal orders do not become “administratively \nfinal” for purposes of § 1231 until they are final for pur-\nposes of appellate review. \n  Moving beyond the INA context, principles of admin-\nistrative law support the conclusion that a reinstated re-\nmoval order is not final until after the conclusion of any \nwithholding-only proceedings.    See Pet. Mem. 7.    In \nagency law, finality is generally achieved when an action \nboth “mark[s] the consummation of the agency’s deci-\nsionmaking process” and also determines legal rights or \nobligations.    Bennett  v. Spear, 520  U.S.  154,  177-78 \n(1997)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).    In  this \ncase, although some legal rights or obligations have al-\nready been determined (the petitioners are removable), \nthe decisionmaking process is ongoing—i.e., it has not \nbeen consummated—as the agency is still determining \nwhether petitioners will be granted withholding of re-\nmoval or will be removed.    As such, under principles of \nadministrative law, petitioners’ removal orders are not \n“final”; therefore, petitioners are being detained under \n§ 1226(a). \n                                                 \n11 Respondents argue that the Fourth Circuit has held that a rein-\nstated removal order’s date of finality is the date of the original entry \nof the order of removal, Resp. Mem. 25-26 (citing Mejia v. Sessions, \n866 F.3d 573 (4th Cir. 2017) ); however, that case involved the date \nof finality for determining whether a challenge to the underlying re-\nmoval order was timely.  It is not clear how the Fourth Circuit would \nanalyze finality dates in the context of a challenge to the eventual \nwithholding-only proceedings. \n \n\n85a \n \n  Respondents’ arguments to the contrary are unavail-\ning.    First, they argue that the text of § 1226(a) sup-\nports their position because petitioners’ removal orders \nhave already been reinstated; as such, the decision on \nwhether petitioners are “to be removed” is no longer \n“pending.”    Resp. Mem. 4.    In addition, they argue that \nwithholding-only proceedings only address the possibil-\nity of executing a removal order to a particular country \nbut do not prohibit immediate removal of petitioners to \na different country based on the reinstated orders.    Id. \nat  14-15.    This  reasoning  is  incomplete.    Although \nDHS may eventually be able to remove petitioners to \nsome third country even if their application for with-\nholding of removal is granted, third-country removal \nwould  require  additional  proceedings.    At  the  least, \nDHS would be required to give petitioners notice and \nthe  opportunity  for  a  hearing.    Cf.  Kossov  v.  INS,   \n132 F.3d 405, 408-09 (7th Cir. 1998).    Moreover, the pro-\nvision allowing for the removal of detainees to additional \ncountries, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(2), places sharp limitations \non the countries that the government may designate for \nremoval—and respondents have not shown that there \nare any countries that meet those limitations for peti-\ntioners.    Finally, as a practical matter, the United States \nof America generally cannot simply sua sponte depart \nan alien to a country where he or she does not have citi-\nzenship; instead, the government must typically get per-\nmission to deport from the third country.    Cf. Zadvydas, \n533 U.S. at 684 (explaining that the government could \nnot deport the petitioner to Germany, Lithuania, or the \nDominican Republic despite his ties to those countries \nbecause  those  countries  would  not  accept  him).    As \nsuch, it is not clear at the present time that petitioners \n \n\n86a \n \nare in fact “to be removed” from the United States.    All \nthat is clear is that they are removable.   \n  Turning to the text of § 1231(a)(5), respondents argue \nthat the provision makes clear that the removal period \nhas begun for petitioners.    Because a reinstated re-\nmoval order “is not subject to being reopened or re-\nviewed,” respondents argue that petitioners’ removal \norders  are  “administratively  final”  and  petitioners   \nare detained under § 1231.    Resp. Mem. 15-17 (internal \nquotation marks omitted).    This argument is unpersua-\nsive.    Although the INA indicates that reinstated re-\nmoval orders are final in the ordinary case, other regu-\nlatory provisions that bear more closely on withholding-\nonly proceedings emphasize that aliens in these pro-\nceedings  are  situated  differently  from  the  ordinary   \nalien subject to a reinstated removed order.   For exam-\nple, 8 C.F.R. § 241.8(e) provides an “[e]xception” to the   \nreinstatement-of-removal regulations when an alien ap-\nplies for withholding of removal.    In addition, the text \nof § 1231(a)(5) does not squarely answer the question \npresented.    Indeed, § 1231(a)(5) does not even mention \nwithholding-only proceedings, much less does it speak \nclearly to the source of the authority to detain individu-\nals in those proceedings. \n  Therefore,  petitioners  are  detained  pursuant  to   \n8 U.S.C. § 1226, not 8 U.S.C. § 1231, and summary judg-\nment will be granted in their favor. \nC.  Class Certification \n  Respondents do not challenge petitioners’ ability to \nsatisfy the numerosity and adequacy requirements, see \nResp. Opp. [Dkt. No. 24] 7 n.2, but do argue that peti-\n \n\n87a \n \ntioners fail to satisfy the commonality and typicality re-\nquirements.    They also argue that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1) \n \nprecludes class certification under Rule 23(b)(2). \n  Commonality is satisfied if petitioners can identify a \n“common  contention  capable  of  being  proven  or  dis-\nproven  in  ‘one  stroke.’”    Brown  v.  Nucor  Corp.,   \n \n785 F.3d 895, 909 (4th Cir. 2015) (quoting Wal-Mart \nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011)); however, \nthe “determination of [the common contention’s] truth \nor falsity” must “resolve an issue that is central to the \nvalidity of each one of the claims,” Wal-Mart Stores,   \n564 U.S. at 350.    Petitioners argue that the central le-\ngal question presented by their habeas petition—whether \nindividuals in withholding-only proceedings are detained \npursuant to § 1226 or § 1231—is exactly such a question \ncapable  of  common  resolution  in  “one  stroke.”    Re-\nspondents argue that because Judge Ellis and this Court \nhave disagreed about the appropriate resolution of that \nquestion “and no Fourth Circuit decision has resolved \nthe issue there can be no commonality to the cases and \nno common injury as Petitioners allege.”    Resp. Opp. \n10.    This argument is nonsensical.    That courts might \ndisagree on the appropriate resolution of this admit-\ntedly complex question of statutory interpretation does \nnot change the fundamental nature of the question as \none that is common to all individuals in the proposed \nclass and that can be resolved in “one stroke.” \n  In addition, respondents argue that petitioners have \nnot met the commonality requirement because the pro-\nposed class “includes [criminal] aliens who would be sub-\nject to detention under both 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) and 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1226(c).”    Id. at 11.    As discussed above, the funda-\nmental question is whether individuals in withholding-\n \n\n88a \n \nonly proceedings are detained under § 1226 or § 1231.   \nResolving that question is not dependent on whether a \nparticular alien is subject to § 1226(c) and is therefore \nineligible for bond.    Accordingly, the core legal ques-\ntion raised by the petition is common among all mem-\nbers of the proposed class, regardless of whether any \nindividual member is subject to § 1226(c). \n  With respect to the criminal aliens subject to manda-\ntory detention under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c), respondents \nalso argue that aliens detained under § 1226(c) are gen-\nerally permitted a Joseph hearing to challenge the basis \nof their mandatory detention and that the issues pre-\nsented in a Joseph hearing will often implicate the core \nquestion of removability because the grounds for man-\ndatory  detention  and  for  removability  often  overlap.   \nId. at 11-12.    Because individuals in withholding-only \nproceedings may not challenge their underlying order of \nremoval, respondents appear to argue that it would be \ninappropriate to allow them to access Joseph hearings.   \nSee id.    This argument is unavailing.    It is clear that \nindividuals in withholding-only proceedings may not le-\ngally challenge the reinstated order of removal; how-\never, if the government determines that any particular \ncovered individual is subject to mandatory detention un-\nder § 1226(c), there is no reason that the individual could \nnot challenge that determination in a Joseph hearing as \nlong as doing so does not require him to challenge the un-\nderlying removal order.12    In addition, the potential Jo-\n                                                 \n12 To the extent that the classification decision is based on the un-\nderlying removal order, the individual alien may not have a substan-\ntive opportunity to challenge the determination; however, if the gov-\nernment seeks to detain individuals under § 1226(c) for reasons that \n \n\n89a \n \nseph wrinkle does not change the fundamentally com-\nmon nature of petitioners’ core contention:    that they \nare detained under § 1226, not § 1231.    Because a single \ncommon question is sufficient to satisfy the commonality \nrequirement, it is clear that petitioners have met that \nrequirement.   \n  Respondents’ argument that petitioners also fail to \nsatisfy the typicality requirement is unavailing for the \nsame reasons.    As respondents concede, the “common-\nality and typically requirements occasionally merge” be-\ncause both relate to the question whether the claims of \nclass members and, particularly the claims of the named \nclass members vis-à-vis the claims of the rest of the \nclass, are so interrelated that class certification is eco-\nnomical and fair.    Resp. Opp. 13.    Respondents argue \nthat petitioners are not typical because none of them is \nsubject to mandatory detention under § 1226(c) and, \ntherefore, petitioners seek only bond hearings and not \nJoseph hearings in their individual cases; however, as \ndiscussed above, the core legal question raised by the \npetition is the same across all class members.13    As \nsuch, the named petitioners are typical of the class in the \n                                                 \nare not based on the underlying removal order, then the individual \nhas the opportunity to contest that determination just like any other \nalien detained pursuant to § 1226(c). \n13 Petitioners also note that a “Joseph hearing” is “simply short-\nhand for a bond hearing which involves the threshold question of \nwhether the noncitizen is subject to mandatory detention,” which \nsuggests that a bond hearing and a Joseph hearing are substantially \nsimilar.  Pl. Reply [Dkt. No. 27] 6-7. \n \n\n90a \n \nrelevant ways, even if there may be some differences be-\ntween their situations and some of the situations of other \nclass members.14 \n  Finally, respondents argue that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1) \n \nprecludes class certification because it prohibits class-\nwide injunctive relief.    Section 1252(f)(1) states, in full:   \n \n“Regardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the \nidentity of the party or parties bringing the action, no \ncourt (other than the Supreme Court) shall have juris-\ndiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation \nof the provisions of part IV of this subchapter,15 as amended \nby the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Re-\nsponsibility Act of 1996, other than with respect to the \napplication  of  such  provisions  to  an  individual  alien \nagainst whom proceedings under such part have been \ninitiated.”    Although this provision does prohibit class-\nwide injunctive relief in some circumstances, the prohi-\nbition is limited to injunction “against the operation of” \n \nthe relevant INA provisions.    Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-\nDiscrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 481 (1999).    Peti-\ntioners are not seeking an injunction “against the oper-\nation of” the INA but are instead seeking an injunction \nrequiring  respondents  to  comply  with  the  terms  of   \nthe INA, as interpreted by this Court.    Accordingly,   \n§ 1252(f)(1), by its terms, does not act as a bar to class-\n \nwide relief in this civil action.    See also Abdi v. Duke,         \n                                                 \n14 In addition, as discussed at oral argument, class certification in \npetitioners’ circumstance is both economical, as there are apparently \nnearly 50 potential class members at any one time who could file in-\ndividual habeas petitioners, and necessary to allow the Fourth Cir-\ncuit to decide the important legal question presented in this petition, \nbecause experience demonstrates that individual claims are often \nrendered moot during the appellate process. \n15 Part IV includes both § 1226 and § 1231. \n \n\n91a \n \nF.

Except as provided in subsection (c) and pend-\ning such decision, the Attorney General— \n  (1)  may continue to detain the arrested alien; \nand \n  (2)  may release the alien on— \n  (A)  bond of at least $1,500 with security ap-\nproved by, and containing conditions prescribed \nby, the Attorney General; or \n  (B)  conditional parole; but \n  (3)  may not provide the alien with work authori-\nzation  (including  an  “employment  authorized”  en-\ndorsement or other appropriate work permit), unless \nthe alien is lawfully admitted for permanent residence \nor otherwise would (without regard to removal pro-\nceedings) be provided such authorization. \n(b)  Revocation of bond or parole \nThe Attorney General at any time may revoke a bond \nor parole authorized under subsection (a), rearrest the \nalien under the original warrant, and detain the alien. \n \n \n\n93a \n \n(c)  Detention of criminal aliens \n(1)  Custody \n  The Attorney General shall take into custody any \nalien who— \n  (A)  is inadmissible by reason of having com-\nmitted any offense covered in section 1182(a)(2) of \nthis title, \n  (B)  is deportable by reason of having commit-\nted any offense covered in section 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), \n(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D) of this title, \n  (C)  is deportable under section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) \nof this title on the basis of an offense for which the \nalien has been sentence1  to a term of imprison-\nment of at least 1 year, or \n  (D)  is inadmissible under section 1182(a)(3)(B) \nof this title or deportable under section 1227(a)(4)(B) \nof this title, \nwhen the alien is released, without regard to whether \nthe alien is released on parole, supervised release, or \nprobation, and without regard to whether the alien \nmay be arrested or imprisoned again for the same of-\nfense. \n(2)  Release \n  The Attorney General may release an alien de-\nscribed in paragraph (1) only if the Attorney General \ndecides pursuant to section 3521 of title 18 that re-\nlease of the alien from custody is necessary to provide \nprotection to a witness, a potential witness, a person \n                                                 \n1  So in original.  Probably should be “sentenced”. \n \n\n94a \n \ncooperating with an investigation into major criminal \nactivity, or an immediate family member or close as-\nsociate of a witness, potential witness, or person co-\noperating with such an investigation, and the alien \nsatisfies the Attorney General that the alien will not \npose a danger to the safety of other persons or of \nproperty and is likely to appear for any scheduled \nproceeding.    A  decision  relating  to  such  release \nshall take place in accordance with a procedure that \nconsiders the severity of the offense committed by \nthe alien. \n(d)  Identification of criminal aliens \n(1)  The Attorney General shall devise and imple-\nment a system— \n  (A)  to make available, daily (on a 24-hour basis), \nto Federal, State, and local authorities the investiga-\ntive resources of the Service to determine whether \nindividuals arrested by such authorities for aggra-\nvated felonies are aliens; \n  (B)  to designate and train officers and employees \nof the Service to serve as a liaison to Federal, State, \nand local law enforcement and correctional agencies \nand courts with respect to the arrest, conviction, and \nrelease of any alien charged with an aggravated fel-\nony; and \n  (C)  which uses computer resources to maintain a \ncurrent record of aliens who have been convicted of \nan aggravated felony, and indicates those who have \nbeen removed. \n(2)  The record under paragraph (1)(C) shall be made \navailable—  \n \n\n95a \n \n  (A)  to inspectors at ports of entry and to border \npatrol agents at sector headquarters for purposes of \nimmediate identification of any alien who was previ-\nously ordered removed and is seeking to reenter the \nUnited States, and \n  (B)  to officials of the Department of State for use \nin its automated visa lookout system. \n(3)  Upon the request of the governor or chief exec-\nutive officer of any State, the Service shall provide as-\nsistance to State courts in the identification of aliens un-\nlawfully present in the United States pending criminal \nprosecution. \n(e)  Judicial review \nThe Attorney General’s discretionary judgment re-\ngarding the application of this section shall not be sub-\nject to review.    No court may set aside any action or \ndecision by the Attorney General under this section re-\ngarding  the detention  or release  of  any  alien  or  the \ngrant, revocation, or denial of bond or parole. \n \n2.  8 U.S.C. 1231(a) provides: \nDetention and removal of aliens ordered removed \n(a)  Detention, release, and removal of aliens ordered re-\nmoved \n(1)  Removal period \n  (A)  In general \n  Except as otherwise provided in this section, \nwhen an alien is ordered removed, the Attorney \nGeneral shall remove the alien from the United \n \n\n96a \n \nStates within a period of 90 days (in this section \nreferred to as the “removal period”). \n  (B)  Beginning of period \n  The removal period begins on the latest of the \nfollowing: \n  (i)  The date the order of removal becomes \nadministratively final. \n  (ii)  If the removal order is judicially re-\nviewed and if a court orders a stay of the re-\nmoval of the alien, the date of the court’s final \norder. \n  (iii)  If the alien is detained or confined (ex-\ncept under an immigration process), the date \nthe alien is released from detention or confine-\nment. \n  (C)  Suspension of period \n  The removal period shall be extended beyond a \nperiod of 90 days and the alien may remain in de-\ntention during such extended period if the alien \nfails or refuses to make timely application in good \nfaith for travel or other documents necessary to \nthe alien’s departure or conspires or acts to pre-\nvent the alien’s removal subject to an order of re-\nmoval. \n(2)  Detention \n  During the removal period, the Attorney General \nshall detain the alien.    Under no circumstance dur-\ning the removal period shall the Attorney General re-\nlease an alien who has been found inadmissible under \n \n\n97a \n \nsection 1182(a)(2) or 1182(a)(3)(B) of this title or de-\nportable under section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4)(B) of \nthis title. \n(3)  Supervision after 90-day period \n  If the alien does not leave or is not removed within \nthe removal period, the alien, pending removal, shall \nbe subject to supervision under regulations prescribed \nby the Attorney General.    The regulations shall in-\nclude provisions requiring the alien— \n  (A)  to appear before an immigration officer \nperiodically for identification; \n  (B)  to submit, if necessary, to a medical and \npsychiatric  examination  at  the  expense  of  the \nUnited States Government; \n  (C)  to give information under oath about the \nalien’s nationality, circumstances, habits, associa-\ntions, and activities, and other information the At-\ntorney General considers appropriate; and \n  (D)  to  obey  reasonable  written restrictions \non the alien’s conduct or activities that the Attor-\nney General prescribes for the alien. \n(4)  Aliens imprisoned, arrested, or on parole, super-\nvised release, or probation \n  (A)  In general \n  Except as provided in section 259(a)1 of title 42 \nand paragraph (2),2 the Attorney General may not \nremove an alien who is sentenced to imprisonment \n                                                 \n1  See References in text note below. \n2  So in original.  Probably should be “subparagraph (B),”. \n \n\n98a \n \nuntil  the  alien  is  released  from  imprisonment.   \nParole, supervised release, probation, or possibil-\nity of arrest or further imprisonment is not a rea-\nson to defer removal. \n  (B)  Exception for removal of nonviolent offenders \nprior to completion of sentence of imprison-\nment \n  The Attorney General is authorized to remove \nan alien in accordance with applicable procedures \nunder this chapter before the alien has completed \na sentence of imprisonment— \n  (i)  in the case of an alien in the custody of \nthe Attorney General, if the Attorney General \ndetermines that (I) the alien is confined pursu-\nant to a final conviction for a nonviolent offense \n(other than an offense related to smuggling or \nharboring of aliens or an offense described in \nsection 1101(a)(43)(B), (C), (E), (I), or (L) of \nthis title3 and (II) the removal of the alien is ap-\npropriate and in the best interest of the United \nStates; or \n  (ii)  in the case of an alien in the custody of \na State (or a political subdivision of a State), if \nthe  chief  State  official  exercising  authority   \nwith respect to the incarceration of the alien \ndetermines that (I) the alien is confined pursu-\nant to a final conviction for a nonviolent offense \n(other  than  an  offense  described  in  section \n1101(a)(43)(C) or (E) of this title), (II) the re-\nmoval is appropriate and in the best interest of \n                                                 \n3  So in original.  Probably should be followed by a closing paren-\nthesis. \n \n\n99a \n \nthe State, and (III) submits a written request \nto the Attorney General that such alien be so \nremoved. \n  (C)  Notice \n  Any alien removed pursuant to this paragraph \nshall be notified of the penalties under the laws of \nthe United States relating to the reentry of de-\nported aliens, particularly the expanded penalties \nfor aliens removed under subparagraph (B). \n  (D)  No private right \n  No cause or claim may be asserted under this \nparagraph against any official of the United States \nor of any State to compel the release, removal, or \nconsideration for release or removal of any alien. \n(5)  Reinstatement of removal orders against aliens \nillegally reentering \n  If the Attorney General finds that an alien has \nreentered  the  United  States  illegally  after  having \nbeen removed or having departed voluntarily, under \nan order of removal, the prior order of removal is re-\ninstated from its original date and is not subject to \nbeing reopened or reviewed, the alien is not eligible \nand may not apply for any relief under this chapter, \nand the alien shall be removed under the prior order \nat any time after the reentry. \n(6)  Inadmissible or criminal aliens \n  An alien ordered removed who is inadmissible un-\nder section 1182 of this title, removable under section \n1227(a)(1)(C), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(4) of this title or \nwho has been determined by the Attorney General to \nbe a risk to the community or unlikely to comply with \n \n\n100a \n \nthe order of removal, may be detained beyond the re-\nmoval period and, if released, shall be subject to the \nterms of supervision in paragraph (3). \n(7)  Employment authorization \n  No alien ordered removed shall be eligible to re-\nceive  authorization  to  be  employed  in  the  United \nStates unless the Attorney General makes a specific \nfinding that— \n  (A)  the alien cannot be removed due to the \nrefusal of all countries designated by the alien or \nunder this section to receive the alien, or \n  (B)  the removal of the alien is otherwise im-\npracticable or contrary to the public interest. \n \n \n ",

The government takes the position that Sec \ntion 1231 detainees are not entitled to bond hearings. \nThe question presented is which provision governs \nthe detention of noncitizens who are subject to rein \nstated removal orders, but who are pursuing lengthy \nproceedings for withholding or deferral of removal \nrelief that, if successful, would prevent removal to the \ngovernment's designated countries. \n\n11 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQuestion Presented ..................................................... i \nTable of Authorities ................................................... iii \nStatement .................................................................... 1 \nA.

Because immigration proceedings are often \nquite prolonged, Congress has provided that (absent \ncertain disqualifying criminal convictions not at issue \nhere) immigration judges are to consider release of an \nindividual on bond or parole, as that person's particu \nlar circumstances warrant. Ibid. That is, if an individ \nual demonstrates that she is neither a danger to her \ncommunity nor a flight risk, she may post bond and \nreturn to her family for the pendency of removal pro \nceedings- a process which frequently takes multiple \nyears. If an individual cannot make that showing, Sec \ntion 1226 provides for detention authority. \nSection 1231 provides mandatory detention au \nthority during the statutorily  defined \"removal pe \nriod.\" This period is 90 days long (unless extended), \nduring which time \"the Attorney General shall re \nmove  the alien from  the  United  States.\"  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1231.  Detention  thus  facilitates  the physical  re \nmoval of an individual from the United States. \nThis case concems how those statutes apply to a \nrelatively  small  sub-category  of noncitizens:  those \nwho are subject to reinstated removal orders, but who \ncredibly invoke bedrock legal protections against de-\n\n2 \nportation to countries where they are likely to be per \nsecuted, tortured, or killed. Like removal proceedings \nmore generally, this process often takes years or more. \nThe  government  long  took  the  position  that \nnoncitizens  in such \"withholding-only\"  proceedings \nwere detained subject to Section 1226. Thus, except \nfor those with serious criminal histories, these indi \nviduals could request a bond hearing from an immi \ngration judge and-if warranted-remain with their \nfamilies  and  communities  during lengthy  removal \nproceedings. \nRecently, however, the government changed its \nposition. It now takes the view that, if an individual \nwith a reinstated order of removal wishes to assert his \nrights to avoid persecution or torture upon removal, \nthe  result  is  mandatory  detention  under  Section \n1231-for periods usually lasting longer than a year, \nand often for  multiple years.  The government has \nnever articulated a rationale for its change in position. \nAnd it cannot explain how its stance accords with the \nshort-term nature of Section 1231's detention author \nity. \nUltimately, the Court should deny the petition for \nreview. The court of appeals reached the correct re \nsult-and, in any event, review of this issue is cur \nrently premature. \nA.  Legal background. \nThe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) pro \nvides the governing framework for the removal  of \nnoncitizens from the United States, and for the Exec \nutive's powers to detain them during that process. \n1. As relevant here, when a noncitizen who has \npreviously been removed from the country is found to \nhave reentered unlawfully, that person's \"prior order \n\n3 \nof removal is reinstated from its original date and is \nnot subject to being reopened or reviewed,\" and \"the \nalien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief' \nunder the INA. 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5). \nNotwithstanding that seemingly unqualified pro \nhibition, the individual may apply for withholding of \nremoval: \"Consistent with our country's obligations \nunder international law, Congress has provided that \na noncitizen may not be removed to a country where \n*sh *e * w ould be persecuted-that is, her 'life or freedom \nthreatened' based on a protected ground, such as \nrace or religion-or tortured.\" Pet. App. 4a-5a (quot \ning 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A); and citing Foreign Affairs \nReform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (FARRA), Pub. \nL. 105-277, div. G, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681-761, 2681-\n822 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note)). \nBecause it is \"the policy of the United States not \nto * * * effect the involuntary return of any person to \na country in which there are substantial grounds for \nbelieving the person would be in danger of being sub \njected  to  torture\"  (FARRA  §  2242(a)  (emphasis \nadded)), these forms of relief-known collectively as \nwithholding of removal-may be  pursued even by \nnoncitizens with reinstated removal orders. Fernan \ndez-Vargas v. Gonzales, 548 U.S. 30,35 n.4 (2006).1 \nNoncitizens with reinstated removal orders are \ntherefore placed in so-called withholding-only admin-\n1  The court of appeals used the umbrella term '\"withholding of \nremoval' to encompass three distinct forms of relief: persecution \nbased  withholding of removal under  the INA\" (see 8  U.S.C. \n§ 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)); \"torture-based withholding \nof removal under  the Convention Against  Torture\" (CAT) (8 \nC.F.R.  § 1208.16(c)); and torture-based deferral ofremoval un \nder the [CAT)\" (see id. § 1208.17). See Pet. App. 6a n.l. \n\n4 \nistrative proceedings if they \"expressO a  fear of re \nturning to the country''  designated  for  removal  (8 \nC.F.R. § 241.8(e)), and an asylum officer determines, \nafter an interview, that the individual has \"a reason \nable fear of persecution or torture\" (id. § 208.31(c)). In \nthat event, the case is referred to an immigration \njudge (IJ) \"for full consideration of the request for \nwithholding of removal only.\" Id. § 208.31(e); see also \nid. § 1208.16 (procedure before IJ). An appeal of the \nIJ's withholding determination may be taken to the \nBoard of Immigration Appeals (BIA), whose decision \nis in turn judicially reviewable through a petition to \nthe court of appeals.  Id.  §  1208.31(e),  8  U.S.C.  § \n1252(a)(l), (4); FARRA§ 2242(d). \n2.  Meanwhile, the INA contains two detention \nprovisions relevant here. \nFirst, under 8 U.S.C. § 1226, \"an alien may bear \nrested and detained pending a  decision on whether \nthe alien is to be removed from the United States.\" 8 \nU.S.C. § 1226(a). That statute authorizes the Execu \ntive to release a detained noncitizen on bond, and the \nimmigration agencies have issued regulations provid \ning that \"a noncitizen detained under [Section] 1226 \nis entitled to an individualized hearing before an im \nmigration judge to determine whether continued de \ntention is necessary while immigration proceedings \ncontinue.\" Pet. App. 13a (citing 8 C.F.R. § 236.1(d)(1)); \nsee 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a)(l)-(2). Section 1226(c) requires \nmandatory detention for noncitizens previously con \nvicted  of certain  criminal  offenses.  See  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1226(c). \nSecond, a separate section of the INA provides for \ndetention for the duration of a  90-day \"removal pe \nriod\" during which \"the  Attorney General shall re \nmove the alien from  the United  States.\"  8  U.S.C. \n\n5 \n§ 1231(a)(l)(A). The removal period begins \"on the lat \nest of' three dates: \n(i)  The date the order of removal becomes ad \nministratively final. \n(ii)  If the removal order is judicially reviewed \nand if a court orders a stay of the removal \nof the alien, the date of the court's final \norder. \n(iii) If the alien is detained or confined (except \nunder an immigration process), the date \nthe alien is released from  detention  or \nconfinement. \nld. § 1231(a)(l)(B). Detention is mandatory during the \n90-day removal period. !d. § 1231(a)(2). If the nonciti \nzen is not removed within the 90 days, he or she \"nor \nmally is subject to supervised release\" (Pet. App. 15a \n(citing 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(3)), although the govern \nment is empowered to continue the detention of cer \ntain categories of noncitizens beyond the 90-day pe \nriod (see 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(6)). No bond hearing is \nprovided by the statute or regulations for noncitizens \ndetained under Section 1231. \nB.  Factual and procedural background. \n1. Respondents are noncitizens who were removed \nfrom the United States and then either persecuted, \ntortured, or threatened with such conduct in the coun \ntries to which they had been removed. Pet. App. 6a-\n7a. \"Fearing for their safety, [they] returned to the \nUnited States, reentering without authorization and \ndespite their prior removal orders.\" Id. at 7a. \nThe  government  reinstated  each  respondent's \nprior order of removal under Section 1231(a)(5), but \neach expressed a reasonable fear of persecution or tor-\n\n6 \nture, and each passed a reasonable fear interview be \nfore an asylum officer or an IJ on review. Pet. App. 7a. \nEach respondent was therefore placed in withholding \nonly proceedings. Ibid. The government detained all \nof the respondents during those proceedings without \nproviding bond hearings. Ibid. \n2. Two sets of respondents filed habeas actions in \ndistrict court in the Eastern District of Virginia, seek \ning declarations that they were detained under Sec \ntion 1226, as well as injunctive relief ordering individ \nualized bond hearings. Pet. App. 8a. In one of the two \nactions, the district court certified a statewide class of \nsimilarly situated detainees, and \"that decision is un \nchallenged on appeal.\" Ibid. \nJudge Brinkema entered summary judgment for \nrespondents  in both cases,  holding that \"the text, \nstructure, and intent of the INA compel the conclusion \nthat  [respondents  were]  detained  under\"  Section \n1226(a). Pet. App. 66a; see id.  at 45a-72a, 73a-91a. \nJudge Brinkema observed that Section 1226-which \napplies \"pending a decision on whether the alien is to \nbe removed\" (8 U.S.C. § 1226(a))-must control, \"be \ncause  until withholding-only  proceedings  are com \nplete, a decision has not been made on whether [re \nspondents] will in fact be removed from the United \nStates.\" Pet. App. 66a. \nAs for Section 1231, Judge Brinkema concluded \nthat its detention provisions \"govern only the final lo \ngistical period, in which the government has actual \nauthority to remove the alien and need only schedule \nand execute  the deportation.\" Pet.  App.  67a.  That \nmuch is clear from both the triggering conditions \nwhich center around \"legal impediment[s] to actual \nremoval\"-and the 90-day duration of the removal pe-\n\n7 \nriod itself: \"[I]t would be contrary to congressional in \ntent to shoehorn a class of aliens whose proceedings \nwill typically far exceed 90 days into the 'removal pe \nriod' for which Congress has specifically intended a \n90-day limit.\" Id. at 66a-67a. For these and other rea \nsons, the court concluded, Section 1226 is the better \nfit. \n3. The Fourth Circuit affirmed. Based on a thor \nough examination of the text and structure of the two \nprovisions, the court of appeals concluded that-un \nlike the government's reading-the district court's in \nterpretation \"fully effectuates the plain text ofthe pro \nvisions and also ensures that [Section] 1226 and [Sec \ntion] 1231 fit together to form a workable statutory \nframework.\" Pet. App. 18a. That is, \"[b]efore the gov \nernment has the actual authority to remove a noncit \nizen from the country, [Section] 1226 applies; once the \ngovernment has that authority, [Section]  1231 gov \nerns.\" Ibid. And \"[b]ecause the government lacks the \nauthority to actually execute orders of removal while \nwithholding-only proceedings are ongoing, [respond \nents] are detained under [Section] 1226.\" Ibid. (alter \nations incorporated; quotation marks omitted). \nDissenting,  Judge Richardson  agreed  with the \ngovernment's position that Section 1231 governs, and \nthat respondents therefore need not be provided with \nindividualized bond hearings. Pet. App. 33a-44a. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThis Court's review is not warranted, for two prin \ncipal reasons. First, the decision ofthe Fourth Circuit \nis correct: Section 1226, not Section 1231, governs the \ndetention of noncitizens with reinstated removal or \nders  while  their withholding-only  proceedings  are \n\n8 \npending. Second, intervention now would be prema \nture, in light of further proceedings in the courts of \nappeals. \nA.  The decision below is correct. \nThe court of appeals correctly joined the Second \nCircuit in holding that respondents' detention is gov \nerned by Section 1226, entitling them to bond hear \nings. Pet. App. 1a-32a; see Guerra v. Shanahan, 831 \nF.3d 59, 62-64 (2d Cir. 2016). \n1. \"As in any case of statutory construction, our \nanalysis  begins with the language of the statute.\" \nHughes Aircraft Co.  v. Jacobson, 525 U.S. 432, 438 \n(1999) (quotation marks omitted). \na. Section 1226 governs the detention of a noncit \nizen \"pending a decision on whether the alien is to be \nremoved from the United States.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a). \nAs the court of appeals correctly concluded, the \nphrase \"to be removed\" demonstrates  that Section \n1226(a)  is  concerned  with  concrete,  practical  out \ncomes. The statute \"does not reference legal 'remova \nbility,' or use other language that captures whether \nthe alien is theoretically removable. Instead, the stat \nute applies 'pending a decision on whether [an] alien \nis to be removed,' invoking the practical question of \nwhether the government has the authority to execute \na removal.\" Pet. App. 18a-19a (quotation marks and \ncitation omitted) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a)). In other \nwords, \"[a]n alien subject to a reinstated removal or \nder is clearly removable, but the purpose of withhold \ning-only  proceedings  is  to  determine  precisely \nwhether 'the alien is to be removed from the United \nStates.\"' Guerra, 831 F.3d at 62 (quoting 8  U.S.C. \n§ 1226(a)). \n\n9 \nCongress's decision not to use the language of re \nmovability in Section 1226(a)-indicating its intent to \nfocus  on practical authority to remove rather than \ntheoretical  status- is  particularly  telling  because \nCongress did employ that language elsewhere in the \nremoval provisions ofthe INA. Section 1229a lays out \nthe procedure for removal proceedings before an im \nmigration judge, and then provides that \"[a]t the con \nclusion of the proceeding the immigration judge shall \ndecide whether an alien is removable from the United \nStates.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(l)(A) (emphasis added). \nWhere, as here, \"the legislature uses certain lan \nguage in one part of the statute and different language \nin another,  the court assumes  different meanings \nwere intended.\" Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. \n692, 711 n.9 (2004) (quoting 2A Sutherland Statutes \n& Statutory Construction§ 46:06 (6th rev. ed. 2000)); \naccord, e.g., Mohamad v. Palestinian Auth., 566 U.S. \n449, 456 (2012) (\"We generally seek to respect Con \ngress' decision to use different terms to describe dif \nferent categories of people or things.\"); Antonin Scalia \n& Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law 170 (2012) (\"[A] ma \nterial variation in terms suggests a variation in mean \ning.\").  \"[W]hether an alien is removable\" (8 U.S.C. \n§ 1229a(c)(1)(A)) must therefore be a different ques \ntion than \"whether [that] alien is to be removed\" (id. \n§ 1226(a)). \nIn other words, \"[i]fCongress had wanted to\" limit \nSection 1226(a) detention to those with pending deter \nminations of theoretical removability, \"it knew exactly \nhow to do so-it could have simply borrowed from the \nstatute next door.\" SAS Inst., Inc. v. lancu, 138 S. Ct. \n1348, 1355 (2018). \nThat conclusion is only strengthened by the fact \nthat both  provisions-Section  1226(a)  and  Section \n\n10 \n1229a(c)-were added to the INA as part of the same \nlegislative act, separated by just a few pages of the \nStatutes at Large.  See Illegal Immigration Reform \nand Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), \nPub. L.  104-208, div.  C,  110 Stat. 3009,  3009-585, \n3009-591; cf. Scalia &  Garner, supra, at 173 (\"[T]he \nmore connection the cited statute has with the statute \nunder consideration, the more plausible the argument \nbecomes.\"). 2 That Congress chose to use different lan \nguage in Section 1226(a) indicates strongly that a dif \nferent  meaning-that  is,  an  inquiry  into  present, \npractical authority to execute removal-was intended. \nThe  government  attempts  to  disregard  this \nstraightforward  construction,  repeatedly  asserting \nthat, by its \"plain terms,\" Section 1226(a) \"governs the \ndetention of aliens who are awaiting a  decision on \nwhether they will be ordered removed.\" Pet. 8. But \nthat is not what the statute says: Section 1226 gov \nerns \"pending a decision on whether the alien is to be \nremoved\" (8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) (emphasis added)), not \n\"whether he will be ordered removed\" (Pet. 8 (empha \nsis added)). Those are not the same thing. \nb. That Section 1226(a) applies until, as a practi \ncal matter, \"the government has the authority to exe \ncute a removal\" (Pet. App. 19a) is confirmed by the \ncomplementary text and structure of Section 1231. \n2  What is more, it was IIRIRA that first introduced the concept \nof \"removal\" and \"removability\" to the INA, replacing the legacy \nnomenclature of \"inadmissibility\" and \"deportability.\" See Cal \ncano-Martinez v. INS, 533 U.S. 348, 350 & n.l (2001) (describing \nthis \"statute-wide change in terminology\"); Jama v. ICE, 543 \nU.S. 335, 345 (2005). Given this context, it would be especially \ninappropriate to assume that Congress failed to use its newly \nminted terminology with precision. \n\n11 \nThat section provides for mandatory detention \"[d)ur \ning the removal period,\" defined as the \"period of 90 \ndays\" during which \"the Attorney General shall re \nmove  the  alien  from  the United States.\"  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1231(a)(1)(A), (a)(2) (emphasis added). The purpose \nof this \"90-day period is to afford the government a \nreasonable amount of time within which to make the \ntravel, consular, and various other administrative ar \nrangements that are necessary to secure removal.\" \nDioufv. Mukasey, 542 F.3d 1222, 1231 (9th Cir. 2008); \nsee also Leslie v. Attorney Gen. of U.S., 678 F.3d 265, \n270 (3d Cir. 2012) (\"[T]he purpose of [Section]  1231 \ndetention is to secure an alien pending the alien's cer \ntain removal[.]\"). \nConsistent with this purpose, Congress expressly \ncontemplated that the \"removal period\"-and thus the \nlength of Section 1231 detention-would last 90 days \nor less. And \"the 90-day limitation makes sense if the \nremoval period is only meant to govern the final logis \ntical steps of physically removing an alien. But it is \nobvious that withholding-only proceedings take sub \nstantially longer than 90 days.\" Pet. App. 21a (quota \ntion marks and citation omitted). Confronted with this \npotential inconsistency, the court of appeals rightly \nwas \"most reluctant to adopt a construction of [Sec \ntion] 1231 that in an entire class of cases will put gov \nernment officials-routinely and completely foreseea \nbly-in dereliction of their statutory duties.\" Id. at \n22a; see also Guerra, 831 F.3d at 62-63 (since Section \n1231 \"is concerned mainly with defining the 90-day \nremoval period during which the Attorney General \n'shall remove the alien[,]\"' Section 1226 \"is the more \n\n12 \nlogical source of authorization for the detention of al \niens currently in withholding-only proceedings.\"). 3 \nThe statutory triggers for the beginning of the \nSection 1231(a) removal period are further clues to its \nintended operation: \nIt is only when all of three potential legal im \npediments to removal have  been  overcome, \nthat is-the removal order has become \"ad \nministratively final,\" any court-issued stay of \nremoval has been lifted, and the noncitizen \nhas been released from any non-immigration \ncustody  so  that there is jurisdiction to  re \nmove-that the 90 days of the removal period \nstart to run. \nPet. App.  19a-20a (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(l)(B)(i) \n(iii)). \nAs the court of appeals explained, these \"precon \nditions are concerned with legal impediments to ac \ntual removal rather than initial determinations of re \nmovability.\" Pet. App.  20a (alteration incorporated; \nquotation marks omitted). 4 \"A noncitizen in criminal \n3  True, \"Section 1231 also contemplates delays to removal\" be \nyond the 90-day period, \"but the contemplated delays are of a \nlogistical nature, not a [substantive legal] one.\" Hechavarria v. \nSessions, 891 F.3d 49, 55 n.4 (2d Cir. 2018). \n4  The government focuses on Section 123l(a)'s heading and pref \natory language, which references \"aliens ordered removed\" (8 \nU.S.C. § 1231(a), (a)(1)(A)), contending that a noncitizen with a \nreinstated removal order has indeed been ordered removed. Pet. \n9, 11. But that prefatory language is not operative with respect \nto the boundaries of the statutory \"removal period\" when the \nthree-pronged definition in Section 123l(a)(1)(B) explicitly con \ntrols that topic. See, e.g., RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amal \ngamated Bank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 (2012) (discussing the \"com \nmonplace of statutory construction that the specific governs the \n\n13 \ncustody, for instance, may already have been deter \nmined (and finally so) to be 'removable.' Nevertheless, \nthe 90-day removal period will not begin, and [Sec \ntion] 1231's detention provisions will not apply, until \nthat noncitizen is released from nonimmigration cus \ntody so that immigration authorities will have juris \ndiction to execute the removal order.\" Ibid. \nIn other words, \"Section 1231 assumes that the \nimmigrant's removal is both imminent and certain. \nThe  definition  of the removal period is  dependent \nupon  the  assumption  that no  substantive  impedi \nments remain to the immigrant's removal.\" Hechavar \nria, 891 F.3d at 55. With withholding proceedings on \ngoing, a noncitizen's removal is neither imminent nor \ncertain, and legal impediments indeed remain. \nThe  two  detention provisions  thus fit  together \nseamlessly: \"Before the government has the actual au \nthority to remove a noncitizen from the country, [Sec \ntion] 1226 applies; once the government has that au \nthority, [Section] 1231 governs.\" Pet. App. 18a. That \nis, \"Section 1226 applies when there is still 'pending' \na  legal determination that must be made before a \nnoncitizen may be removed; and once there are no re \nmaining  legal  impediments  to  removal,  [Section] \n1231's 90-day removal period begins.\" ld. at 20a. \"The \nresult is that until withholding-only proceedings con \nclude, the removal period has not begun and [Section] \n1231's detention provisions do not apply. Instead, the \ndecision regarding whether [respondents] are 'to be \ngeneral\") (quoting Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. \n374, 384 (1992)); cf. Digital Realty Tr., Inc. v. Somers, 138 S. Ct. \n767, 776 (2018) (''When a statute includes an explicit definition, \nwe must follow that definition[.]\") (quotation marks omitted)). \n\n14 \nremoved' remains 'pending,' and [Section] 1226 gov \nerns.\" Pet. App. 22a. \n2. The government's objections to the Fourth Cir \ncuit's analysis do not withstand scrutiny. \na. The government first suggests that the text of \nSection 1226 excludes those with reinstated removal \norders: Because withholding only provides \"protection \nfrom being removed to a particular country *** the \ngovernment remains free to remove the alien to any \ncountry apart from the country of risk.\" Pet. 10-11. \nThus, the argument goes, for those in withholding \nonly proceedings, \"[t]he 'decision on whether the alien \nis to be removed\"' has been made; withholding only \ndetermines  to  where. ld.  at  11  (quoting  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1226(a)); see also Pet. App. 42a-43a (Richardson, J., \ndissenting). \nAs the court of appeals rightly noted, though, \"the \n'whether' and 'where' questions [cannot] be separated \nso cleanly.\" Pet. App. 23a. Rather, \"both legally and \npractically, the two are intertwined: Because the gov \nernment's removal authority turns on the ultimate \nidentification of an appropriate country for removal, \n'it is not clear' while withholding-only proceedings are \npending 'that [respondents] are in fact \"to be removed\" \nfrom the United States.\"' Pet App. 24a (quoting Pet. \nApp. 70a). \nIn other words, the argument about \"whether\" \nversus \"where\" overlooks that the government cannot \ndeport someone without deporting him or her to some \nwhere. And if the government's first-choice removal \ndestination is off the table due to pending withholding \nproceedings, the INA \"places sharp limitations\" on re \nmoval to alternative countries. Pet. App. 60a-70a; see \n\n15 \n8 U.S. C. § 1231(b). 5 That is, \"the government gener \nally cannot simply sua sponte deport an alien to a \ncountry where he or she does not have citizenship.\" \nPet. App. 24a (quotation marks omitted). \nMoreover,  even  if a  third country is available \nwithin the statutory structures, the government must \nfirst notify the noncitizen of the country to which it \nintends to  effectuate removal,  allowing \"an oppor \ntunity to request withholding of removal to that par \nticular country.\" Pet. App. 25a (citing Kossov v. INS, \n132 F.3d 405, 409 (7th Cir. 1998)). For this reason, \n\"'third-country removal would require additional pro \nceedings,' including the opportunity for a hearing \nwhich means that the government lacks the 'present \nand final legal authority' to remove the petitioners \nduring  their  initial withholding-only  proceedings.\" \nIbid. \nThe result is that, \"in practice * * * non-citizens \nwho are granted restrictions on removal are almost \nnever removed from the U.S.\" Kumarasamy v. Attor \nney Gen. of U.S., 453 F.3d 169, 171 n.l (3d Cir. 2006) \n5  Section 1231(b)(2) sets out an ordered list of countries to which \nthe government is empowered to remove a noncitizen; except in \nthe case of an unusually multinational individual, most of the \nputative options are likely either  to be the same country for \nwhich withholding is being sought, or to not exist at all. See, e.g., \n8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(2)(D) (\"a country of which the alien is a sub \nject, national, or citizen\"), (E)(iii) (\"[a] country in which the alien \nresided before the alien entered the country from which the alien \nentered the United States\"), (E)(iv) (\"[t]he country in which the \nalien was born\"). And while there is a residual clause authorizing \nremoval to \"another country whose government will accept the \nalien into that country\" (ld. § 1231(b)(2)(E)(vii)), the Court has \nmade clear  that the government lacks the power to deport a \nnoncitizen to such an unaffiliated third country without that \ncountry's consent. See Jama, 543 U.S. at 347. \n\n16 \n(quoting David Weissbrodt & Laura Danielson, Immi \ngration Law & Procedure 303 (5th ed. 2005)) (altera \ntion incorporated); cf. Pet. App. 24a (\"government has \nnot shown\" that any alternative removal countries ex \nist for respondents). That is, withholding proceedings \nalmost always do determine \"whether the alien is to \nbe removed,\" not just to where. 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a). \nb. The government also asserts that the Fourth \nCircuit's construction of Section 1231-that it is con \ncerned with \"legal impediments to actual removal\" \n(Pet.  App.  20a  (alteration incorporated))-\"lacks  a \nsound basis in the statutory text.\" Pet. 11. Not so. \nThe \"removal period\" of Section 1231 cannot begin \nuntil a noncitizen's removal order is \"administratively \nfinal.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(l)(B)(i). Under the settled \nmeaning of that concept in administrative law, agency \naction is not \"final\" unless it \"mark[s] the consumma \ntion  of the  agency's  decisionmaking process.\"  U.S. \nArmy Corps of Eng'rs v. Hawkes Co., 136 S. Ct. 1807, \n1813 (2016) (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, \n177-178 (1997)). And when withholding-only proceed \nings are ongoing, the agency's removal decision can \nhardly be  said to  be \"consummated\";  rather,  \"[i]n \nthose cases, 'the reinstated removal order is not final \nin the usual legal sense because it cannot be executed \nuntil further agency proceedings are complete.\"' Pet. \nApp.  26a-27a (quoting Luna-Garcia v. Holder,  777 \nF.3d 1182, 1185 (lOth Cir. 2015)). It is hard to imagine \nanother administrative context in which an agency or \nder would be considered \"final\"-and thus subject to \nimmediate challenge in court-while further proceed \nings about the legality of executing that order were \npending before the same agency. \nTo be sure, in most cases, a reinstated removal or \nder will be administratively final. This fact \"explain[s] \n\n17 \nwhy Congress located [Section] 1231(a)(5), governing \nreinstatement of removal orders, in the same provi \nsion that establishes the 90-day removal period. In the \nordinary case, reinstatement of a removal order* ** \nwill 'mark  the consummation of the agency's  deci \nsionmaking process,' leaving for the 90-day window \nonly administrative execution of the removal order.\" \nPet. App. 26a (quoting Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177-178); \ncf.  Pet.  9-10  (relying on the placement of Section \n1231(a)(5)). \nAs the court of appeals explained, though, \"the \nquestion here is about the exceptional case, not the or \ndinary case: The small percentage of cases in which \nnotwithstanding  [Section]  1231(a)(5)'s  general  bar \nagainst  relief  from  reinstated  removal  orders-a \nnoncitizen with a  'reasonable fear' of persecution or \ntorture is permitted to apply for withholding of re \nmoval.\" Pet. App. 26a. Because the government's de \ncisionmaking process with respect to respondents' re \nmoval remains ongoing, their removal orders are not \n\"administratively final,\" and Section 1231's removal \nperiod has not yet begun. 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(B)(i). \nThat is the \"sound basis in the statutory text\" the gov \nernment claims is missing. Pet. 11. \n3. Ultimately, the proper functioning of this stat \nutory framework is non-controversial in the vast ma \njority of normal,  non-reinstatement removal cases: \nSection 1226(a) applies, thereby permitting the gov \nernment the flexibility to make a bond determination \nand respecting the noncitizen's liberty interests, dur \ning the often-lengthy proceedings leading up to a \"de \ncision on whether the alien is to be removed.\" 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1226(a). \nOnce that decision is made and finalized, deten \ntion authority shifts to Section 1231, which requires \n\n18 \nthe government to detain the noncitizen during a rel \natively short period while it \"make[s] the travel, con \nsular, and various other administrative arrangements \nthat are necessary to secure removal.\" Diouf, 542 F.3d \nat 1231. In that context, mandatory detention makes \nsense: The government has an interest in maintaining \nphysical control over someone while that person's \"re \nmoval is both imminent and certain.\" Hechavarria, \n891 F.3d at 55. \nThe question here is simply where in that statu \ntory structure to locate the sub-class of noncitizens \nwhose removal orders have been reinstated, but who \nare pursuing often years-long proceedings that, if suc \ncessful, will almost certainly preclude their deporta \ntion. In light of the undisputed statutory context, the \nFourth Circuit resolved that issue in commonsense \nfashion:  \"Section  1226  applies  when  there  is  still \n'pending' a legal determination that must be made be \nfore a noncitizen may be removed; and once there are \nno remaining legal impediments to removal, [Section] \n1231's 90-day removal period begins.\" Pet. App. 20a; \nsee, e.g., Torres v. Lynch, 136 S. Ct. 1619, 1626 (2016) \n(\"[W]e must, as usual, interpret the relevant words \nnot in a vacuum, but with reference to the statutory \ncontext.\") (quotation marks omitted). \nThe Fourth Circuit's decision is true to both the \ntext and the context of the INA Further review of that \ndecision is thus unwarranted. \nB.  Review is presently premature. \nRegardless of the merits of the Fourth Circuit's \nholding, it would be premature at this juncture for the \nCourt to review the question presented. \n1.  To  start,  the  government  fails  to  directly \nacknowledge that the Court denied certiorari on this \n\n19 \nexact question just last Term. See Padilla-Ramirez v. \nCulley, 139 S. Ct. 411 (2018). \n2.  Additional percolation on this \"difficult ques \ntion\" (Pet. App. 71a), would be beneficial. See Arizona \nv. Evans, 514 U.S. 1, 23 n.1 (1995) (Ginsberg, J., dis \nsenting) (\"We have in many instances recognized that \nwhen frontier legal problems are presented, periods of \n'percolation' in, and diverse opinions from, state and \nfederal appellate courts may yield a better informed \nand  more  enduring  final  pronouncement  by  this \nCourt.\"). \nIndeed, the Fourth Circuit's decision below pro \nvides robust explanation for why Section 1226 governs \nin these  circumstances.  Compare  Pet. App.  1a-32a \nwith Guerra, 831 F.3d at 62-64 (treating the question \nin significantly less depth). The lower courts should be \nallowed the benefit of the Fourth Circuit's analysis, \ngiving \"the issue * * * further study before it is ad \ndressed by this Court.\" McCray v. New York, 461 U.S. \n961, 963 (1983) (Stevens, J., respecting denial of cer \ntiorari); cf., e.g., Box v. Planned Parenthood of Ind. & \nKent., Inc., 139 S. Ct. 1780, 1784 (2019) (Thomas, J., \nconcurring) (\"[B]ecause further percolation may assist \nour review * * * I join the Court in declining to take \nup the issue now.\"). \nMoreover, valuable  additional perspectives will \nnot be long in coming. A decision on the question pre \nsented by the Sixth Circuit, for example, is likely im \nminent. See Melara Martinez v. Barr, No.  19-3908 \n(6th Cir.) (argued Jan. 30, 2020). If the Court wishes \nto take up this issue, it may do so in that case-with \nthe benefit of an additional opinion from an as-yet un \ncommitted court of appeals. \nIn fact, the Sixth Circuit case presents a more at \ntractive vehicle, because it also cleanly presents the \n\n20 \nnext logical question that flows from the government's \nposition: If the government is right that the statutory \nscheme does not provide for bond hearings, whether \nthe  resulting  mandatory  detention-for  the  fre \nquently years-long duration of prolonged administra \ntive proceedings-is consistent with due process. \nFor example, the habeas petitioner in the Sixth \nCircuit  case  has  been  in  government  custody  for \ntwenty-seven months without an individualized deter \nmination of his flight risk or danger to the community. \nSee, e.g.,  Pet'r  Br. 1, No.  19-3908 (6th Cir. Nov.  7, \n2019), Dkt. 28. That is flatly inconsistent with a \"soci \nety [in which] liberty is the norm, and detention * * * \nwithout  trial  is  the  carefully  limited  exception.\" \nUnited States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 755 (1987); see \nalso Zadvydas  v.  Davis,  533  U.S.  678,  690  (2001) \n(\"[G]overnment detention violates [the Due Process] \nClause unless the detention is ordered in a criminal \nproceeding with adequate procedural protections, or, \nin certain special  and narrow  nonpunitive circum \nstances where a special justification, such as harm \nthreatening mental illness, outweighs the individual's \nconstitutionally protected interest in avoiding physi \ncal restraint.\") (quotation marks and citations omit \nted). \nIf the government is right about the statute, the \nCourt will likely have to answer the constitutional \nquestion one way or another. Cf. Jennings v. Rodri \nguez,  138 S.  Ct. 830, 852 (2018) (remanding to the \ncourt of appeals to consider the due process issue). Un \nlike this case, the pending Sixth Circuit case provides \n\n21 \nan opportunity to address both Issues in one inte \ngrated proceeding. 6 \n3. Nor is the need for immediate review as press \ning as the government contends. The government ob \njects to \"providing a  new mechanism for  aliens in \nwithholding-only proceedings to obtain release over \nDRS's objection,\" when people in that category have \nsupposedly \"demonstrated a willingness to evade fed \neral immigration law and authorities and a disregard \nfor their removal orders, and thus present a distinct \nrisk that they will fail to comply with an order of re \nmoval.\" Pet. 15-16. \nEven assuming that flight from \"a reasonable fear \nof persecution or torture\"  (8  C.F.R.  § 208.31)  may \nfairly be described as \"disregard for * * * removal or \nders\" (Pet. 16), the government's argument disregards \nthat the purpose of a bond hearing is to determine pre \ncisely whether an individual person is likely to ab \nscond.  See  Guerrero-Sanchez  v.  Warden  York  Cty. \nPrison, 905 F.3d 208, 223 (3d Cir. 2018) (explaining \nthat \"the government's interest\" in preventing flight \n\"is served by the bond hearing process itself.\") (quot \ning Dioufv. Napolitano, 634 F.3d 1081, 1088 (9th Cir. \n2011)). That is, \"[i]f the alien poses a flight risk, con \ntinued detention is permitted.\" Ibid. (alteration incor \nporated). All the Fourth Circuit's decision provides to \nrespondents is process-something the government \nhas no legitimate reason to fear. \n6  The pending petition in Albence v. Arteaga-Martinez, No. 19-\n896, provides no opportunity for consideration of this issue, as \nthe decision in that case construes statutory text in light of con \nstitutional avoidance. By contrast, Melara Martinez presents the \nconstitutional question directly. \n\n22 \nThe government's policy concerns, moreover, are \nbelied by the fact that, for many years, the govern \nment itself took the position that noncitizens in re \nspondents' circumstances are subject to Section 1226 \ndetention, not Section 1231. See, e.g., Lopez v. Napoli \ntano, 2014 WL 1091336, at *3 (E.D. CaL 2014) (\"Re \nspondent asserts that Petitioner is being detained \npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a).\"); Castillo v. ICE Field \nOffice Dir., 907 F. Supp. 2d 1235, 1241 (W.D. Wash. \n2012)  (\"Respondent agrees  * * * that because Peti \ntioner's  application  for  withholding  of removal  is \npending, he is currently not subject to a final rein \nstated order of removal.\"). Treating individuals like \nrespondents as subject to Section 1226 cannot have \nbaleful consequences for  the government, since the \ngovernment previously took this very position. \nMoreover,  the district court's  statewide injunc \ntion-mandating bond hearings for all noncitizens in \nrespondents' position detained in Virginia-was en \ntered in February 2018, over two years ago. See Order, \nDiaz v. Hott, No. 17-cv-1405 (Feb. 26, 2018), Dkt. 32. \nIf the  government's  concerns  about  widespread \n\"fail[ure] to comply with an order of removal\" (Pet. 16) \nby noncitizens released on bond were well-founded, \nthose concerns would have materialized by now-and \nwe would have heard about them in the government's \npetition. \n\n23 \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should deny the petition. \nRespectfully submitted. \nSIMONY.

ALBENCE, ACTING DIRECTOR OF  \nU.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT,  \nET AL., PETITIONERS \nv. \nMARIA ANGELICA GUZMAN CHAVEZ, ET AL. \n \nON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT \n \nREPLY BRIEF FOR THE PETITIONERS \n \nThe court of appeals held that the detention of an al-\nien who is subject to a reinstated order of removal, and \nwho has been placed in withholding-only proceedings, is \ngoverned by 8 U.S.C. 1226 rather than 8 U.S.C. 1231.  \nIn the petition for a writ of certiorari (at 14-15), the gov-\nernment explains that the court’s decision deepens a \ncircuit  conflict  on  an  important  and  recurring issue:    \nThe  Second  and  now  the  Fourth  Circuits  have  held  \nthat Section 1226 governs the detention of an alien in \nwithholding-only  proceedings,  while  the  Third  and \nNinth Circuits have held that Section 1231 does so.   \nIn their brief in opposition, respondents do not deny \nthat the question presented is the subject of a circuit \nconflict.  They also do not deny that the question pre-\nsented is recurring and important.  Nor, finally, do they \nsuggest that this case suffers from any vehicle problems \n(1) \n\n2 \nthat would preclude the Court from reaching the ques-\ntion presented if it were to grant review.   \nRespondents nonetheless advance three arguments \nfor denying review: that the decision below is correct, \nthat the Court denied review on the same question in \nanother case last Term, and that review would be prem-\nature.  None of those arguments is sound.    \nA.  The Decision Below Is Wrong \nRespondents principally contend (Br. in Opp. 8-18) \nthat the decision below is correct on the merits.  But \nthat contention is more appropriately presented to this \nCourt on plenary review.  Even if the court of appeals’ \ndecision were correct, it would still warrant review, be-\ncause two circuits have adopted the opposite position.  \nIn any event, respondents’ arguments on the merits are \nunconvincing.   \nRespondents principally argue that Section 1226—\nwhich governs detention “pending a decision on whether \nthe alien is to be removed from the United States,”  \n8 U.S.C. 1226(a)—“is concerned with concrete, practical \noutcomes,” not simply with “whether the alien is theo-\nretically removable.”  Br. in Opp. 8 (citation omitted).  \nThat argument is incorrect.  The statutory text focuses \non whether “a decision on whether the alien is to be re-\nmoved” is still “pending,” not on whether the govern-\nment has acquired the “practical” ability to remove the \nalien.  The term “practical,” although prominent in the \ncourt  of  appeals’  decision  and  in  respondents’  argu-\nment, appears nowhere in the statutory text.  In any \nevent, an alien who is subject to a reinstated order of \nremoval is not simply “theoretically removable.”  By the \nterms of the statute, such an alien has been ordered re-\nmoved, and his order of removal “is not subject to being \nreopened or reviewed.”  8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(5).   \n \n\n3 \nRespondents also argue that the text and structure \nof Section 1231 show that that provision governs a per-\nson’s detention only at the point when the statutory re-\nmoval period begins, and that the removal period in \nturn begins when, “as a practical matter, ‘the govern-\nment has the authority to execute a removal.’”  Br. in \n \nOpp. 10 (quoting Pet. App. 19a).  Section 1231, however, \nspecifically provides that the removal period begins “on \nthe latest of the following:”  (1) the “date the order of \nremoval becomes administratively final,” (2) if the re-\nmoval order is stayed pending judicial review, “the date \nof the court’s final order,” and (3) if the alien is detained \nor confined except under an immigration process, “the \ndate the alien is released from detention or confine-\nment.”  8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(1)(B).  All of those dates have \npassed in this case, and Section 1231 accordingly has \nnow become applicable.  See Pet. App. 40a-41a & n.3 \n(Richardson, J., dissenting).  There is no sound basis in \nthe text for the contention that, even when those dates \nhave passed, the removal period still does not begin un-\ntil the government acquires the “practical” authority to \nexecute the removal.    \nFinally, respondents contend that the removal pe-\nriod under Section 1231 cannot begin until an alien’s or-\nder of removal is “administratively final,” and that an or-\nder cannot be administratively final while withholding- \nonly proceedings remain pending.  Br. in Opp. 17 (quot-\ning 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(1)(B)(i)).  That is incorrect.  This \ncase involves aliens who have already been removed \nfrom the United States pursuant to a final order of re-\nmoval, who have reentered the United States, and who \nhave had that previous order of removal reinstated.  As \nJudge Richardson explained:  “That reinstatement does \nnot create a new or second order of removal.  It simply \n \n\n4 \nreinstates the prior order.  * * *  The order was final \nthen and is final now.”  Pet. App. 37a.  The pendency of \nwithholding-only proceedings does not detract from the \nfinality of that initial order.  Ibid.   \nB. This Court’s Denial Of Certiorari In Padilla-Ramirez v. \nCulley Does Not Support Denial Of Certiorari Here \nRespondents next argue (Br. in Opp. 18-19) that this \nCourt should deny review here because it denied review \non  the  same  question  in Padilla-Ramirez  v.  Culley,  \n139 S. Ct. 411 (2018).  That is mistaken.  \nIn Culley, the government filed a brief in opposition \nacknowledging that the question presented may war-\nrant this Court’s review, but arguing that Culley was a \npoor vehicle for resolving it.  Specifically, the govern-\nment acknowledged that “two courts of appeals” had \nrendered conflicting decisions:  The Second Circuit had \nheld that Section 1226 governs detention of an alien who \nis subject to a reinstated final order of removal and who \nis in withholding-only proceedings, while the Ninth Cir-\ncuit had held that Section 1231(a) does so.  Gov’t Br. in \nOpp. at 12-13, Padilla-Ramirez, supra (No. 17-1568).  \nThe  government  explained  that,  “although  only  two \ncourts of appeals ha[d] thus far considered the issue, re-\nview by this Court may be warranted in an appropriate \ncase,” because “[t]he question presented recurs with \nsome frequency” and because it has important “legal \nand practical consequences.”  Id. at 12-13.  The govern-\nment argued, however, that that case was a poor vehicle \nfor resolving the question presented, because the peti-\ntioner in that case “ha[d] been released on bond (and \nthus  [wa]s  no  longer  detained)  for  independent  rea-\nsons,” eliminating the “immediate practical importance” \nof the question presented for him.  Id. at 13.  The gov-\nernment also noted that the case “would become moot if \n \n\n5 \npetitioner’s  withholding-only  proceedings  were  com-\npleted before this Court could render any decision.”  Id. \nat 14 n.4.   \nSince Padilla-Ramirez, the question presented has \nbecome even more clearly deserving of this Court’s re-\nview.  What was then a 1-1 circuit conflict has now de-\nveloped into a 2-2 circuit conflict, with the Fourth Cir-\ncuit joining the Second Circuit in holding that the de-\ntention of aliens with reinstated removal orders who are \nin withholding-only proceedings is governed by Section \n1226, and the Third Circuit joining the Ninth Circuit in \nholding that it is governed by Section 1231.  See Pet. 6.  \nThe development of the circuit conflict also underscores \nthe government’s observation in Padilla-Ramirez that \nthe  question  presented  recurs  with  some  frequency.  \nSee  Br. in  Opp.  at  12, Padilla-Ramirez, supra (No.  \n17-1568).   \nIn addition, unlike Padilla-Ramirez, this case would \nbe an appropriate vehicle for resolving the question pre-\nsented.  This suit was brought on behalf of a class of \naliens—not a single alien who has already been released \non bond for independent reasons and whose case could \nbecome  moot.    See  Pet.  6;  see  also  Sosna  v.  Iowa,  \n419 U.S. 393, 402 (1975) (holding that a live controversy \nbetween a named defendant and a certified class may \npersist “even though the claim of the named plaintiff has \nbecome moot”).  Moreover, respondents do not identify \nany procedural or other obstacle that would preclude \nthe Court from reaching the question presented.   \nC.  This Court’s Review Is Warranted Now \nFinally, respondents argue (Br. in Opp. 2) that “re-\nview of this issue is currently premature.”  In respond-\nents’ view, this Court should postpone review in order \nto  enable  “[a]dditional  percolation”  and  “‘further \n \n \n\n6 \nstudy’” in the courts of appeals.  Id. at 19 (citation omit-\n \nted).  Four courts of appeals, however, have already \nstudied the question presented and have provided con-\nflicting answers.  See Pet. 14.  Further, the majority and \nthe dissent in this case have developed the arguments \nfor and against the holding below at significant length.  \nSee Pet. App. 1a-32a; id. at 33a-44a (Richardson, J., dis-\nsenting).  Under these circumstances, there is no merit \nto  respondents’  contention  that  further  percolation \nwould materially assist this Court in its consideration of \nthe question presented.  \nRespondents argue (Br. in Opp. 19) that this Court \nshould await Martinez v. LaRose, No. 19-3908 (6th Cir.) \n(argued Jan. 30, 2020), which they claim “presents a \nmore attractive vehicle” than this case because it pre-\nsents not only the statutory question raised here, but \nalso the related question whether “prolonged” deten-\ntion under Section 1231 “is consistent with due pro-\ncess.”  The Sixth Circuit, however, has not yet issued a \ndecision in Martinez.  As a result, respondents’ conten-\ntions about what issues Martinez will ultimately pre-\nsent and about whether that case will prove to be a good \nvehicle are, at this stage, speculative and premature.  \nFurther, respondents do not suggest that this Court’s \nconsideration of the statutory question presented here \nis logically dependent on or intertwined with the consid-\neration of the constitutional question that they assert is \npresented in Martinez.  Indeed, all four courts of ap-\npeals to have addressed the question presented have re-\nsolved the statutory question presented here without \naddressing  the  constitutional  issue  that  respondents \nidentify.  See Guerrero-Sanchez v. Warden York County \nPrison, 905 F.3d 208, 213-219 (3d Cir. 2018); Padilla-\nRamirez v. Bible, 882 F.3d 826, 829-837 (9th Cir. 2017), \n \n\n7 \ncert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 411 (2018); Guerra v. Shanahan, \n831 F.3d 59 (2d Cir. 2016); Pet. App. 31a-32a.   \nLast, respondents contend (Br. in Opp. 21-22) that, \nbecause “[a]ll the Fourth Circuit’s decision provides to \nrespondents is [additional] process,” the decision causes \nno “baleful consequences” that justify this Court’s im-\nmediate intervention.  The government has explained, \nhowever, that the additional process that the Fourth \nCircuit has required itself has significant operational \nconsequences for an immigration system that already \nfaces an “extraordinary,” “extreme,” and “unsustaina-\nble” administrative “strain.”  Asylum Eligibility and \nProcedural Modifications, 84 Fed. Reg. 33,829, 33,831, \n33,838, 33,841 (July 16, 2019); see Pet. 16.  The govern-\nment also has explained that the existence of a circuit \nconflict itself creates additional challenges, because im-\nmigration officials and immigration judges must now \nresolve complex questions about which circuit’s prece-\ndents to apply to a given alien.  See Pet. 16.  In addition, \nthe  question  presented  determines  whether  Section \n1226(c)—which provides for the mandatory detention of \ncertain criminal aliens—applies to aliens who have re-\ninstated orders of removal and are in withholding-only \nproceedings.  Those consequences further justify this \nCourt’s intervention. \nCONCLUSION \nThe  petition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari  should  be \ngranted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n  NOEL J.

(And, as I said, the majority \n“except[ion]?”  assumes that § 1231 allows the Government to deny bond \n   hearings during the 90-day “removal period.”) \nRead on.

Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 \n  (2001), by arguing that there is a difference between the Government’s inability to remove an alien due to the grant \nof withholding-only relief and its inability to remove an alien because of the geopolitical and practical concerns that \nprevented removal in that case. But the premise of respondents’ argument is that a decision about whether an alien \n“is to be removed” remains pending during withholding-only proceedings because it is not certain that the \nGovernment will actually be able to remove the alien from the country. The same lack of certainty existed in \nZadvydas, where the Government’s attempt to return an alien to the country listed in the removal order was \nrebuffed for geopolitical or practical reasons, and the Government had to search for an alternative. \n \n8  The dissent contends that the second of these provisions, § 1231(c)(2)(A), is “beside the point” because another \n  provision in that subsection and a regulation provide that DHS has the authority to release on bond an alien for \nwhom it had previously stayed immediate removal so that the alien could testify in a prosecution. See post, at 2296 \n– 2297. But DHS’s ability to release certain aliens on bond tells us nothing about the meaning of the phrase “[e]xcept \nas otherwise provided” in § 1231(a)(1)(A). The point is that other provisions in § 1231 contemplate situations in \nwhich DHS is not required to remove an alien in less than 90 days. The dissent otherwise dismisses the remaining \ntwo provisions as “unlike the restriction-on-removal provision” in that they “sugges[t] ... an extension of the \nremoval period beyond ninety days.” Post, at 2296. But that is the very feature that makes these provisions relevant \nto § 1231(a)(1)(A). \n \n9  The parties offer two other arguments, neither of which we need address. The Government asks that we apply \n  deference under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 \nL.Ed.2d 694 (1984), to its interpretation of § 1231. But Chevron deference does not apply where the statute is clear. \nFor their part, respondents argue that the canon of constitutional avoidance favors application of § 1226, not § \n1231, to their detention. But that canon “comes into play only when, after the application of ordinary textual \nanalysis, the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one construction.” Jennings, 583 U. S., at ––––, 138 \nS.Ct., at 841 – 842 (internal quotation marks omitted). As already explained, the text makes plain that § 1231, not § \n1226, governs. \n \n \n \n \n ",

No. 11] and Motion for \nSummary Judgment [Dkt. No. 16] as well as respondents' Motion for Summary Judgment [Dkt. \nNo. 21].  For the reasons that follow, petitioners' motions will be granted and respondents' \nmotion will be denied. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nPetitioners Rogelio Amilcar Cabrera Diaz (\"Cabrera Diaz\"), Jennry Francisco Moran \nBarrera (\"Moran Barrera\"), and Rodolfo Eduardo Rivera Flamenco (\"Rivera Flamenco\") \n(collectively, \"petitioners\") have filed a class action habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2241, seeking class action certification and an order directing respondents Russell Hott \n(\"Hott\"), the Field Office Director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), and \nJefferson B. Sessions, III (\"Sessions\"), the Attorney General of the United States of America, \n(collectively, \"respondents\") to grant the class members bond hearings. \nThe relevant facts are simple and undisputed. Each individual petitioner has been \nremoved from the United States under an order of removal. Second Am. Pet. for Writ of Habeas \n\nCorpus [Dkt. No. 4] ~~ 13, 19, 23. When each petitioner returned to his native country (two of \nthe petitioners are from El Salvador and one is from Honduras), he received death threats. Id. ~~ \n14, 20, 24. As a result, each petitioner returned to the United States without permission from the \nappropriate authorities. Id. ~~ 15, 20, 25. Each petitioner has been issued a Notice of \nIntent/Decision to Reinstate Prior Order, which reinstated the prior order of removal and \nrendered him deportable, and each has been detained by ICE at Immigration Centers of America-\nFarmville (in Farmville, Virginia) since such issuance. ld. ~~ 17, 21-22, 25. Each petitioner has \nexpressed a fear of returning to his native country and, after either an asylum officer or an \nimmigration judge (\"IJ\") determined that he had a reasonable fear of persecution or torture, he \nwas placed in withholding-only proceedings, which remain pending. Id. ~~ 18, 22, 26. \nPetitioners believe that they, and other detainees who are similarly in withholding-only \nproceedings, are entitled under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") to bond hearings, \nbecause they believe that 8 U.S.C. § 1226, not 8 U.S.C. § 1231, provides the source of authority \nfor their detention. Id. ~~ 41-44. This Court has agreed. See Romero v. Evans,_ F. Supp. 3d_, \nNo. 1:17-cv-754, 2017 WL 5560659 (E.D. Va. Nov. 17, 2017). Accordingly, petitioners seek to \nrepresent a class of all individuals: \nwho are in 'withholding-only proceedings, having established a reasonable fear of \npersecution or torture, and such proceedings are not administratively final, or if final, \na stay of removal has been granted by a U.S. Court of Appeals, and \nwho, as of the time of filing the initial pleading in this case or at any time thereafter, \nare detained by, or on the authority of, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, \nwithin the state of Virginia. \nI d. ~ 4 7. Respondents disagree that class certification is appropriate and that petitioners \nare being held pursuant to § 1226. Accordingly, petitioners have filed a Motion for Class \n2 \n\nCertification [Dkt. No. 11] and each party has filed a Motion for Summary Judgment [Dkt. Nos. \n16 & 21]. \nII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Standard of Review \nA party is entitled to summary judgment if the party can show \"that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(a). A genuine dispute of material fact exists \"if the evidence is such that a reasonable \njury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. \n242,249 (1986). In general, bare allegations or assertions by the nonmoving party are not \nsufficient to generate a genuine dispute; instead, the nonmoving party must produce \n\"significantly probative\" evidence to avoid summary judgment. Abcor Corp. v. AM Int'l, Inc., \n916 F.2d 924, 929-30 (4th Cir. 1990) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 242). That being said, in \nruling on a motion for summary judgment, a court should accept the evidence of the nonmovant, \nand all justifiable inferences must be drawn in her favor. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255. \nClass certification is appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 if petitioners can show that \nthere are sufficiently numerous parties (\"numerosity\"); there are questions of law or fact \ncommon to the class (\"commonality\"); the claims or defenses of the named petitioners are \ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class (\"typicality\"); and the named petitioners will fairly \nand adequately protect the interests of the class (\"adequacy\"). In addition, a proposed class must \nqualify under Rule 23(b)(1), (2), or (3). Petitioners seek certification under Rule 23(b)(2), which \npermits certification where \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds \nthat apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief \nis appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \n3 \n\nB.  Summarv Judgment \nAs both parties agree, all relevant facts in this action are undisputed and the resolution of \nthe habeas petition turns on a pure question of law: whether ICE's authority to detain petitioners \narises from 8 U.S.C. § 1226, as petitioners contend, or 8 U.S.C. § 1231, as respondents contend. \nIf petitioners are held under§ 1226, they are entitled to a bond hearing under§ 1226(a) unless \nthe government determines that they are criminal aliens subject to mandatory detention under \n§ 1226(c ). 1 If petitioners are held under § 1231, they are subject to mandatory detention without \n2 \na bond hearing.  Petitioners rely on an opinion from this Court, as well as a Second Circuit \nopinion, holding that aliens in petitioners' position are detained under § 1226 and are entitled to \nbond hearings. See Romero,_ F. Supp. 3d_, 2017 WL 5560659, appeal pending, No. 18-6086 \n(4th Cir.); see also Guerra v. Shanahan, 831 F.3d 59 (2d Cir. 2016). Respondents rely on Ninth \nCircuit and Eastern District of Virginia decisions holding that detainees in petitioners' position \nare detained under§ 1231 and are not entitled to bond hearings. See Padilla-Ramirez v. Bible, \n862 F.3d 881 (9th Cir. 2017); Crespin v. Evans, 256 F. Supp. 3d 641, No. 1:17-cv-140, 2017 WL \n2385330 (E.D. Va. May 31, 2017), appeal dismissed as moot, No. 17-6835 (4th Cir. Feb. 23, \n3 \n2018).\n1 A petitioner classified as a criminal alien under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c) would have the opportunity \nto challenge his classification in a hearing conducted under In re Joseph, 221. & N. Dec. 799 \n(BIA 1999), which gives an alien allegedly subject to mandatory detention the ability to seek a \n\"bond ruling as to whether the alien is properly included in a mandatory detention category\" \nfrom an IJ, id. at 800 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n2 The Supreme Court has recognized a limited due process right to release from mandatory \ndetention in certain narrow circumstances. See Zadvvdas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001). \nPetitioners have declined to pursue a Zadvydas-based due process claim. \n3 \nAt oral argument, counsel explained to the Court that the petitioner in Crespin was granted \nwithholding of removal and was released from custody, which mooted Crespin before the Fourth \nCircuit could decide the appeal. Similarly, counsel explained that each of the three original \npetitioners in Romero has concluded withholding-only proceedings and that the appeal in that \n4 \n\nThe context of petitioners' detention and the legal claims raised by both parties involve \nthe nature of reinstated final removal orders and the effect of withholding-only proceedings on \nthose orders, as well as the statutes governing detention during and after removal proceedings. \n1.  Reinstated Removal Orders and Withholding-Only Proceedings \nWhen an alien who has been ordered removed from the United States and has either been \nremoved or departed voluntarily under the order of removal illegally reenters the country, the \noriginal order of removal \"is reinstated from its original date.\" 8 U.S.C. § 123l(a)(5). Such an \norder \"is not subject to being reopened or reviewed\" and the alien \"may not apply for any relief' \nfrom that order under the INA. See id. In general, this provision \"forecloses discretionary relief \nfrom the terms of the reinstated order,\" Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales, 548 U.S. 30, 35 (2006); \nhowever, there is one exception to this rule. Congress has provided, consistent with the United \nStates's obligations under international law, that the Attorney General may not remove an alien \nto a country where the alien's life or freedom would be threatened. See 8 U.S.C. § 123l(b)(3).4 \nThis restriction applies even to aliens with reinstated removal orders. See id. Therefore, although \nan alien cannot otherwise challenge a reinstated removal order, he can seek protection from \nhaving that order executed to a particular country by initiating a withholding-only proceeding. \nWhen an alien subject to a reinstated removal order expresses a fear of removal to the \ncountry indicated in his removal order, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") refers the \nalien to an asylum officer for a pre-withholding screening interview. See 8 C.P.R.§ 208.3l(b). If \naction will be moot once the IJ in the remaining petitioner's withholding-only proceedings \nformally enters an Order granting him relief. \n4 In addition to applying for withholding of removal under the statutory provision, aliens may \nalso apply for withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture. The standards for \nwithholding are slightly different under the two provisions, but the process is the same. See 8 \nC.P.R.§ 208.16. \n5 \n\nthe asylum officer determines that the alien \"has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture,\" the \n5 \nalien may apply for withholding of removal. See id. § 208.31 (e). \nIf the alien passes this screening process, then the alien is permitted to apply for \nwithholding or deferral6 of removal and the application goes to an IJ for an initial review to \ndetermine whether the alien has met his burden. 7 Should the burden be met, the IJ will grant the \nalien's request for deferral or withholding of removal; however, if the IJ determines that the alien \nhas not met his burden, the alien may appeal that determination to the Board of Immigration \nAppeals (\"BIA\") and, ultimately, to a federal court of appeals. In these \"withholding-only\" \nproceedings, the only issue is whether the alien is entitled to withholding or deferral of removal; \nthe alien may not collaterally attack the underlying removal order. See id. §208.2(c)(3)(i). \nIn this litigation, each petitioner has passed the initial screening process, has applied for \nwithholding of removal, and is in the process of applying to an IJ for an initial review of whether \nwithholding or deferral of removal should be granted. \n2.  Statutes Governing Alien Detention \nThere are two separate provisions in the INA that give the government authority to detain \naliens during removal proceedings or while awaiting the execution of an order of removal. When \n5 \nAlternatively, if the asylum officer determines that the alien has not established a reasonable \nfear, the alien can appeal that decision to an IJ. Id. § 203.31(f). If the IJ agrees with the asylum \nofficer, the process ends (there is no appeal) and DHS will execute the reinstated removal order. \nId . § 203.31 (g)( 1) . If, on the other hand, the IJ finds the alien has established a reasonable fear of \nfersecution or torture, then the alien may apply for withholding of removal. Id. § 203.31(g)(2). \nUnder § 1231 (b )(3), an alien applies for \"withholding\" of removal. Under the Convention \nAgainst Torture, an alien applies for \"withholding or deferral\" of removal. The difference is not \nrelevant to this action. \n7 Under§ 1231(b)(3), the alien bears the burden of establishing that \"his or her life or freedom \nwould be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, \nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 C.F .R. § 208.16(b) . To qualify \nfor protection under the Convention Against Torture, the alien bears the burden of showing it is \n\"more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of \nremoval.\" Id . § 208.16( c). \n6 \n\nan alien is first arrested, he or she is detained under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), which allows DHS to \n\"arrest[] and detain[]\" the person \"pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from \nthe United States.\" Under this section, the alien may be released on bond;8 however, once the \n\"removal period\" begins, the authority for detention shifts to 8 U.S.C. § 1231. The ''removal \nperiod,\" which is typically a 90-day period9 in which the alien ought to be removed, begins on \nthe latest of three dates: ( 1) the \"date the order of removal becomes administratively final\"; (2) \nthe \"date of the court's final order\" if\"the removal order is judicially reviewed\" and \"a court \norders a stay of the removal of the alien\"; or (3) the \"date the alien is released from detention or \nconfmement\" if \"the alien is detained or confined (except under an immigration process).\" Id . \n§ 1231(a)(1)(B). During the \"removal period,\" DHS \"shall detain the alien.\" Id. § 1231(a)(2). \n3.  The Source of Authority to Detain Petitioners \nThe legal question presented by petitioners boils down to a deceptively simple question: \nAre petitioners detained under 8 U.S.C. § 1226 or under 8 U.S.C. § 1231 ?10 Both parties employ \na variety of statutory interpretation techniques to answer this question. In the end, although \n8 \nAs discussed above, Congress has provided for mandatory detention for some aliens with \ncertain criminal convictions who would otherwise be detained under§ 1226(a) and entitled to a \nbond hearing. See 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c). \n9 \nThere are some circumstances in which the removal period may be extended beyond 90 days. \nAt a certain point after these 90 days, due process protections may require a bond hearing or the \nrelease of the alien. Cf. Zadvvdas, 533 U.S. 678. To implement these protections, DHS has \ninstituted regulations governing post-removal-order custody reviews. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.4. \nThese regulations are not at issue in this action. \n10 \nRespondents appear to believe that the relevant question in this case is simply whether \npetitioners' removal orders are \"administratively final\"; if so, then the removal period has begun \nunder§ 1231 and petitioners are detained under that section. See Resp. Mem. [Dkt. No. 22] 12; \nsee also Padilla-Ramirez, 862 F.3d at 884 (\"The question before us, then, is whether Padilla \nRamirez's reinstated removal order is administratively final.\"). Although administrative finality \nis the relevant dividing line in§ 1231, the Court must analyze both§ 1226 and§ 1231 and \nattempt to harmonize the two statutes rather than unduly focusing on the § 1231 provisions. \n7 \n\nrespondents' arguments have some force, the text, structure, and intent of the INA compel the \nconclusion that petitioners are detained under 8 U .S.C. § 1226. \nBeginning with the statutory text,§ 1226(a) governs detention for an alien \"detained \npending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States.\" As an initial \nmatter, this text governs petitioners' detention because until withholding-only proceedings are \ncomplete, a decision has not been made on whether petitioners will in fact be removed from the \nUnited States. See Pet. Mem. [Dkt. No. 17] 6. As petitioners argue,§ 1226(a) focuses not on a \ndetermination of removability (which has already been made) but instead on a more concrete \ndetermination of whether petitioners will actually be removed-a determination that has not yet \nbeen made in petitioners' cases. See id. As such, until the government determines that there is a \ncountry to which petitioners can legally be removed, the decision on whether they are \"to be \nremoved\" remains \"pending,\" and§ 1226(a) governs their detention. \nThis conclusion is reinforced by the statutory structure of the INA and evidence of \nCongress's intent. Section 1231 provides that the removal period will begin on the latest of three \ndates: the date the removal order becomes final, the date any judicial stay stopping removal is \nlifted, or the date the alien is released from non-immigration detention. 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(B). \nAs petitioners explain, each of these three preconditions simply relates to a different legal \nimpediment to actual removal: either DHS has not completed its own removal process (the order \nis not final) or the judicial branch has deprived DHS of authority to execute the removal process \n(a judicial stay stopping removal is in place) or the criminal authorities, rather than ICE, have \ncustody of the individual and ICE does not have jurisdiction to remove the noncitizen (the alien \nis in non-immigration detention). In each situation, DHS may have already determined that the \n8 \n\nnoncitizen is, like petitioners here, removable, but ICE lacks the present and final legal authority \nto actually execute that order of removal. \nMoreover, Congress clearly intended to have § 1231 govern only the final logistical \nperiod, in which the government has actual authority to remove the alien and need only schedule \nand execute the deportation. Congress has specifically limited the normal \"removal period\" to 90 \ndays, a limitation that makes sense if the removal period is only meant to govern the final \nlogistical steps of physically removing an alien. Based on the length of petitioners' detentions to \ndate, see Second Am. Pet.~~ 17, 21, 25, it is obvious that withholding-only proceedings take \nsubstantially longer than 90 days. As such, it would be contrary to congressional intent to \nshoehorn a class of aliens whose proceedings will typically far exceed 90 days into the \"removal \nperiod\" for which Congress has specifically intended a 90-day limit. \nBackground legal principles of finality also support petitioners' view. The INA limits \njudicial review to a \"final order of removal,\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1 ), and aliens may appeal \nadverse decisions in withholding-only proceedings only \"as part of the review of a final order of \nremoval,\" id. § 1231 note (d). Addressing these statutes, many courts have held that a reinstated \nremoval order is not final for purposes ofj udicial review until after the adjudication of any \nwithholding applications, an interpretation the government has itself endorsed. See Pet. Mem. \n11 \n7. It would be nonsensical to adopt a \"bifurcated definition of finality\" with respect to removal \norders in withholding-only proceedings. Guerr~ 831 F.3d at 63. As such, the Court concludes \n11 \nRespondents argue that the Fourth Circuit has held that a reinstated removal order's date of \nfinality is the date of the original entry of the order of removal, Resp. Mem. 25-26 (citing Meiia \nv. Sessions, 866 F.3d 573 (4th Cir. 2017)); however, that case involved the date of finality for \ndetermining whether a challenge to the underlying removal order was timely. It is not clear how \nthe Fourth Circuit would analyze finality dates in the context of a challenge to the eventual \nwithholding-only proceedings. \n9 \n\nthat reinstated removal orders do not become \"administratively final\" for purposes of§ 1231 \nuntil they are final for purposes of appellate review. \nMoving beyond the INA context, principles of administrative law support the conclusion \nthat a reinstated removal order is not final until after the conclusion of any withholding-only \nproceedings. See Pet. Mem. 7. In agency law, finality is generally achieved when an action both \n\"mark[s] the consummation of the agency's decisionmaking process\" and also determines legal \nrights or obligations. Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). In this case, although some legal rights or obligations have already been determined \n(the petitioners are removable), the decisionmaking process is ongoing-i.e., it has not been \nconsummated-as the agency is still determining whether petitioners will be granted withholding \nof removal or will be removed. As such, under principles of administrative law, petitioners' \nremoval orders are not \"final\"; therefore, petitioners are being detained under§ 1226(a). \nRespondents' arguments to the contrary are unavailing. First, they argue that the text of \n§ 1226(a) supports their position because petitioners' removal orders have already been \nreinstated; as such, the decision on whether petitioners are \"to be removed\" is no longer \n\"pending.\" Resp. Mem. 4. In addition, they argue that withholding-only proceedings only \naddress the possibility of executing a removal order to a particular country but do not prohibit \nimmediate removal of petitioners to a different country based on the reinstated orders. Id . at 14-\n15. This reasoning is incomplete. Although DHS may eventually be able to remove petitioners to \nsome third country even if their application for withholding of removal is granted, third-country \nremoval would require additional proceedings. At the least, DHS would be required to give \npetitioners notice and the opportunity for a hearing. Cf. Kossov v. INS, 132 F.3d 405,408-09 \n(7th Cir. 1998). Moreover, the provision allowing for the removal of detainees to additional \n10 \n\ncountries, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(2), places sharp limitations on the countries that the government \nmay designate for removal-and respondents have not shown that there are any countries that \nmeet those limitations for petitioners. Finally, as a practical matter, the United States of America \ngenerally cannot simply sua sponte deport an alien to a country where he or she does not have \ncitizenship; instead, the government must typically get permission to deport from the third \ncountry. Cf. Zadvvdas, 533 U.S. at 684 (explaining that the government could not deport the \npetitioner to Germany, Lithuania, or the Dominican Republic despite his ties to those countries \nbecause those countries would not accept him). As such, it is not clear at the present time that \npetitioners are in fact \"to be removed\" from the United States. All that is clear is that they are \nremovable. \nTurning to the text of§ 1231(a)(5), respondents argue that the provision makes clear that \nthe removal period has begun for petitioners. Because a reinstated removal order \"is not subject \nto being reopened or reviewed,\" respondents argue that petitioners' removal orders are \n\"administratively final\" and petitioners are detained under§ 1231. Resp. Mem. 15-17 (internal \nquotation marks omitted). This argument is unpersuasive. Although the INA indicates that \nreinstated removal orders are final in the ordinary case, other regulatory provisions that bear \nmore closely on withholding-only proceedings emphasize that aliens in these proceedings are \nsituated differently from the ordinary alien subject to a reinstated removal order. For example, 8 \nC.F.R. § 241.8(e) provides an \"[e]xception\" to the reinstatement-of-removal regulations when an \nalien applies for withholding of removal. In addition, the text of§ 1231(a)(5) does not squarely \nanswer the question presented. Indeed,§ 1231(a)(5) does not even mention withholding-only \nproceedings, much less does it speak clearly to the source of the authority to detain individuals in \nthose proceedings. \n11 \n\nTherefore, petitioners are detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1226, not 8 U.S.C. § 1231, and \nsummary judgment will be granted in their favor. \nC.  Class Certification \nRespondents do not challenge petitioners' ability to satisfy the numerosity and adequacy \nrequirements, see Resp. Opp. [Dkt. No. 24] 7 n.2, but do argue that petitioners fail to satisfy the \ncommonality and typicality requirements. They also argue that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(l) precludes \nclass certification under Rule 23(b) (2). \nCommonality is satisfied if petitioners can identify a \"common contention capable of \nbeing proven or disproven in 'one stroke.\"' Brown v. Nucor Com., 785 F.3d 895, 909 (4th Cir. \n2015) (quoting Wal-Mart Stores. Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011)); however, the \n\"determination of [the common contention's] truth or falsity\" must \"resolve an issue that is \ncentral to the validity of each one of the claims,\" Wal-Mart Stores, 564 U.S. at 350. Petitioners \nargue that the central legal question presented by their habeas petition-whether individuals in \nwithholding-only proceedings are detained pursuant to§ 1226 or§ 1231-is exactly such a \nquestion capable of common resolution in \"one stroke.\" Respondents argue that because Judge \nEllis and this Court have disagreed about the appropriate resolution of that question \"and no \nFourth Circuit decision has resolved the issue there can be no commonality to the cases and no \ncommon injury as Petitioners allege.\" Resp. Opp. 10. This argument is nonsensical. That courts \nmight disagree on the appropriate resolution of this admittedly complex question of statutory \ninterpretation does not change the fundamental nature of the question as one that is common to \nall individuals in the proposed class and that can be resolved in \"one stroke.\" \nIn addition, respondents argue that petitioners have not met the commonality requirement \nbecause the proposed class \"includes [criminal] aliens who would be subject to detention under \n12 \n\nboth 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) and 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c).\" Id. at 11. As discussed above, the fundamental \nquestion is whether individuals in withholding-only proceedings are detained under § 1226 or \n§ 1231. Resolving that question is not dependent on whether a particular alien is subject to § \n1226(c) and is therefore ineligible for bond. Accordingly, the core legal question raised by the \npetition is common among all members of the proposed class, regardless of whether any \nindividual member is subject to § 1226(c ). \nWith respect to the criminal aliens subject to mandatory detention under 8 U.S.C. § \n1226(c), respondents also argue that aliens detained under§ 1226(c) are generally permitted a \nJoseoh hearing to challenge the basis of their mandatory detention and that the issues presented \nin a Joseph hearing will often implicate the core question of removability because the grounds \nfor mandatory detention and for removability often overlap. Id. at 11-12. Because individuals in \nwithholding-only proceedings may not challenge their underlying order of removal, respondents \nappear to argue that it would be inappropriate to allow them to access Joseph hearings. See \nid. This argument is unavailing. It is clear that individuals in withholding-only proceedings may \nnot legally challenge the reinstated order of removal; however, if the government determines that \nany particular covered individual is subject to mandatory detention under § 1226(c ), there is no \nreason that the individual could not challenge that determination in a Joseph hearing as long as \ndoing so does not require him to challenge the underlying removal order. 12 In addition, the \npotential Joseph wrinkle does not change the fundamentally common nature of petitioners' core \ncontention: that they are detained under § 1226, not § 1231. Because a single common question \n12 \nTo the extent that the classification decision is based on the underlying removal order, the \nindividual alien may not have a substantive opportunity to challenge the determination; however, \nif the government seeks to detain individuals under§ 1226(c) for reasons that are not based on \nthe underlying removal order, then the individual has the opportunity to contest that \ndetermination just like any other alien detained pursuant to § 1226(c ). \n13 \n\nis sufficient to satisfy the commonality requirement, it is clear that petitioners have met that \nrequirement. \nRespondents' argument that petitioners also fail to satisfy the typicality requirement is \nunavailing for the same reasons. As respondents concede, the \"commonality and typicality \nrequirements occasionally merge\" because both relate to the question whether the claims of class \nmembers and, particularly the claims of the named class members vis-a-vis the claims of the rest \nof the class, are so interrelated that class certification is economical and fair. Resp. Opp. 13. \nRespondents argue that petitioners are not typical because none of them is subject to mandatory \ndetention under§ 1226(c) and, therefore, petitioners seek only bond hearings and not Joseph \nhearings in their individual cases; however, as discussed above, the core legal question raised by \nthe petition is the same across all class members.13 As such, the named petitioners are typical of \nthe class in the relevant ways, even if there may be some differences between their situations and \nsome of the situations of other class members.14 \nFinally, respondents argue that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(t)(l) precludes class certification because \nit prohibits class-wide injunctive relief. Section 1252(t)(l) states, in full: \"Regardless of the \nnature of the action or claim or of the identity of the party or parties bringing the action, no court \n(other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the \n13 Petitioners also note that a \"Joseph hearing\" is \"simply shorthand for a bond hearing which \ninvolves the threshold question of whether the noncitizen is subject to mandatory detention,\" \nwhich suggests that a bond hearing and a Joseph hearing are substantially similar. Pl. Reply [Dkt. \nNo. 27] 6-7. \n14 \nIn addition, as discussed at oral argument, class certification in petitioners' circumstance is \nboth economical, as there are apparently nearly 50 potential class members at any one time who \ncould file individual habeas petitioners, and necessary to allow the Fourth Circuit to decide the \nimportant legal question presented in this petition, because experience demonstrates that \nindividual claims are often rendered moot during the appellate process. \n14 \n\noperation of the provisions of part IV of this subchapter, 15 as amended by the Illegal Immigration \nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, other than with respect to the application of \nsuch provisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings under such pati have been \ninitiated.\" Although this provision does prohibit class-wide injunctive relief in some \ncircumstances, the prohibition is limited to injunctions \"against the operation of' the relevant \nINA provisions. Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471,481 (1999). \nPetitioners are not seeking an injunction \"against the operation of' the INA but are instead \nseeking an injunction requiring respondents to comply with the terms of the INA, as interpreted \nby this Court. Accordingly, § 1252( f)( 1) , by its terms, does not act as a bar to class-wide relief in \nthis civil action. See also Abdi v. Duke,_ F. Supp. 3d _, 2017 WL 5599521, at *26 (W.D.N.Y. \nNov. 17, 2017); R.I.L.-R v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 184 (D.D.C. 2015); Preap v. Johnson, \n303 F.R.D. 566,584 (N.D. Cal. 2014), affd, 831  F.3d 1193 (9th Cir. 2016). \nTherefore, petitioners meet each of the necessary requirements for class certification and \ntheir motion will be granted. \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, petitioners' Motion to Certify Class [Dkt. No. 11] and \nMotion for Summary Judgment [Dkt. No. 16] will be granted and respondents' Motion for \nSummary Judgment [Dkt. No. 21] will be denied by an appropriate Order to be issued with this \nMemorandum Opinion. \n~ \nEntered thisJ.fL day of February, 2018. \nLeonie M.
