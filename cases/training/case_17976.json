    "summary": "<p>This case is part of the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse's coverage of the Carter Page Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants. For more information on litigation to disclose the warrants that inspired this case, please see <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16844\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this link</a>. For a summary of the warrants and information on ongoing efforts by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to protect the confidential information in them, see <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17114\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this link</a>.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>The FISA requires the government to obtain a warrant from the FISC before it may conduct any domestic electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information. The warrant applications are made ex parte and must include a sworn statement by a federal officer of the facts and circumstances relied upon to justify the government's belief that the target of surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Once a FISC judge receives a warrant application, the judge can order approval of the surveillance only if the judge finds that there is probable cause to believe that the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Because the orders only authorize surveillance up to 90 days, the government must file an application for an extension that meets the same requirements as the initial warrant application and obtain a renewal order from the FISC for continued surveillance. For the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse collection of FISA matters, see our <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">special collection</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On April 4, 2017, the James Madison Project (a Washington, DC-based nonprofit dedicated to promoting public transparency in the intelligence community) and a <em>USA Today</em> national security reporter filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. &sect; 552), requesting that the Department of Justice (DOJ) release documents from the FISC relating to surveillance on the Trump 2016 campaign and any minimization procedures related to them. The case was assigned to Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly. In a separate case, the FISC released an opinion (<a href=\"../../../../detail.php?id=17114\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In re Carter W. Page: A U.S. Person [FISA dockets 16-1182, 17-52, 17-375, 17-679]</a>) emphasizing this case as one that could lead to lawful release of information in the Carter Page FISA warrants.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs, in their complaint in this case, said that the initial FOIA request and ensuing lawsuit were based on a tweet from President Trump's Twitter account on March 4, 2017 accusing the Obama administration of illegally monitoring his campaign. They argued that subsequent statements from President Trump and Press Secretary Sean Spicer constituted prior official disclosure of the surveillance, and the documents should be released. The initial FOIA request sent to the DOJ on March 6, 2017 asked for copies of the orders authorizing surveillance on the Trump campaign, any applications for those orders, and any minimization procedures applied to the orders. The plaintiffs alleged that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had not provided any responsive documents at the time of filing the complaint.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March 15, 2017, saying that six hours after they filed the initial complaint, the FBI filed a response (known as a Glomar response) to their initial FOIA request saying it could not confirm or deny the existence of the FISC documents. The plaintiffs noted that since this response was received after they filed the complaint in District Court, they were exempt from exhausting administrative remedies and could proceed with the litigation. The new complaint added an extra count against the DOJ National Security Division, alleging that the plaintiffs had exhausted all administrative avenues to get the requested documents through the DOJ without success and therefore could add the DOJ National Security Division to this complaint as a defendant.</p>\r\n<p>The DOJ filed a motion for summary judgment on July 14, 2017. The government alleged that the Glomar response was proper under the following exceptions to FOIA: the national security exception (1), the exception to protect sources in an ongoing intelligence investigation as required by the National Security Act (3), the exception to information collected as part of an ongoing investigation (7a), and the exception for information that would reveal law enforcement techniques (7e). The DOJ added that it had properly filed national security disclosures describing why the requested information had to be protected in line with exception 1's requirements. The DOJ also argued that the President's broad statements related to some form of surveillance were not an official acknowledgement of the requested records, since the tweets and press statements were broad and did not acknowledge a specific investigation.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a cross motion for summary judgment in response to the DOJ's motion on August 18, 2017 contesting the DOJ's characterization of the administration's conduct as not an acknowledgement of an investigation. They provided quotations from the President and Spicer repeating that Trump himself was not the target of surveillance in the 2016 campaign. In addition, they cited a lengthy press statement from Spicer responding to news reports about specific FISA warrants against the campaign; they argued that the response to specific investigations was enough to acknowledge their existence. The plaintiffs also highlighted denials of investigations into President Trump directly from FBI Director James Comey and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper as proof that there was some sort of investigation going on.</p>\r\n<p>The DOJ responded to this motion on September 17, saying that no amount of media speculation or response to media speculation could amount to official disclosure of an investigation. Instead, they alleged that disclosure of an investigation must be officially done. The plaintiffs contested this in a September 29, 2017 response, saying that, if the court applied the DOJ's logic, an intelligence agency could simply protect information about an intelligence by saying it is responding to a media request.</p>\r\n<p>The case was reassigned to Judge Timothy J. Kelly on September 18, 2017. It was randomly reassigned to Judge Amit P. Mehta on November 2.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Mehta allowed the parties to provide supplemental briefs distinguishing or analogizing this case from separate James Madison Project FOIA litigation (<em>James Madison Project v. Dep't of Justice</em>, No. 17-cv-144) decided on January 4, 2018, which said that \"political statements\" were not official acknowledgements of FISA investigations. In their response brief dated January 17, the DOJ reiterated previous arguments about the breadth of the contested government statements, saying they did not amount to disclosure. The James Madison Project, in its January 22 response, stressed that the White House statements responded to news reports of specific FISA investigations, and the specificity present here made them not like the \"political statements\" in the previous case.</p>\r\n<p>On February 14, after the release of new information from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) officially acknowledging FISA investigations into the Trump campaign in January 2018, the DOJ provided a proposed schedule for settlement negotiations, which the plaintiffs accepted two days later. The plaintiffs filed a status report on July 24 asking for renewed briefing, in light of new tweets from the President contesting the legitimacy of redactions of the Carter Page FISA applications released as part of this litigation. Judge Mehta did not grant the request immediately, referring the parties to new rounds of negotiation on August 8. These negotiations fell apart, and Judge Mehta set a new briefing schedule on August 22.</p>\r\n<p>The DOJ's motion for summary judgment, filed on October 19, 2018, recited the same FOIA exceptions as the first motion for summary judgment and added in a 7d exception, saying that disclosing certain information would reveal the identity of confidential sources. The plaintiffs responded on November 9 requesting partial summary judgment. They focused on a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-34/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">September 17, 2018 White House press release</a> that said the President \"directed . . . immediate declassification\" of the Page FISA warrants and subsequent tweets from the President that read:</p>\r\n<blockquote>I met with the DOJ concerning the declassification of various UNREDACTED documents. They agreed to release them but stated that so doing may have a perceived negative impact on the Russia probe. Also, key Allies&rsquo; [sic] called to ask not to release. Therefore, the Inspector General . . . has been asked to review these documents on an expedited basis. I believe he will move quickly on this (and hopefully other things which he is looking at). In the end, I can always declassify if it proves necessary. Speed is very important to me &ndash; and everyone!</blockquote>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs argued that this warranted discovery into 21 pages of the Page warrants, since the DOJ apparently promised to release unredacted versions of them in response to a Presidential \"order.\" Even if such a promise did not exist, the plaintiffs argued that discovery was warranted to know if it did exist or not. Finally, the plaintiffs alleged that the President's statement should still impact review of the redactions, and summary judgment in favor of the defense was not warranted.</p>\r\n<p>The DOJ replied to the plaintiffs on November 30, 2018, contesting the plaintiffs' characterization of the tweet and prior press releases as an \"order\" to disclose the Page FISA warrants, saying that it instead was a statement from the Press Secretary. The defendants denied the existence of any such order and argued that there was no issue of material fact that justified more discovery. The plaintiffs responded on December 20 that this statement from the Twitter account could not be a Press Secretary statement, the tweet was specific enough to allow discovery into this particular FISA warrant, and that the current record was not enough to show that there was no issue of material fact regarding the existence of an order or not.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Mehta released an opinion denying the defendant's motion for summary judgment on July 30, 2019. He stated that, under FOIA, the agency protecting the information has the responsibility to show that the information is protected by a national security exemption (exemption 1) and not disclosed by the government, and that enough ambiguity remains surrounding the President's supposed order to disclose the Page FISA warrants to allow more discovery into the matter. He added that there remains a dispute over whether exemptions 7d and 7e covered this content, since the President's order to declassify the documents might impact the sources and methods in the contested section. 2019 WL 3430728.</p>\r\n<p>The government filed another motion for summary judgment on August 30, 2019, including a statement from DOJ officials saying that they never received a declassification order for the information at issue. They argued that this settled the issue as to whether the press releases and tweets amounted to a declassification order. The plaintiffs submitted a response contesting this claim on September 13.</p>\r\n<p>The release of the FBI Inspector General's \"Crossfire Hurricane\" report into surveillance of the Trump campaign impacted this case; some of the confidential information requested in this case was released in that report. However, some information still remained classified, and litigation continued. For more information on the Crossfire Hurricane report, see <a href=\"../../../../detail.php?id=17413\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In re Accuracy Concerns Regarding FBI Matters Submitted to the FISC.</a></p>\r\n<p>Judge Mehta granted the defendant's renewed motion for summary judgment on March 3, 2020. Upon reviewing the declaration from DOJ officials, he found that the lack of direction to declassify the documents at issue meant that the press release and tweets were not official orders, and summary judgment was warranted. 2020 WL 1033301.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider on March 13, 2020, arguing that, while the issue on the classification of the 21 pages was decided by the new statements from DOJ officials, outstanding questions remained as to the remaining classified pages in the Page FISA warrants, focusing on two other tweets from the President that cast doubt on the redactions in the warrants overall. The plaintiffs did admit that they failed to contest this issue in later motions, and in their response brief on March 26, the defendants argued that the plaintiffs' lack of action on this issue meant they had abandoned it.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Mehta did allow reconsideration of the issue and released an opinion on May 4, 2020. However, he granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the issue, because the tweets the plaintiffs highlighted did not reveal any personal knowledge of a declassification order and were just \"bad faith assertions\" that were not enough to stand up to a motion for summary judgment.</p>\r\n<p>With all contested issues decided, the plaintiffs filed a notice of dismissal on July 31, 2020. The case is now closed.</p>",

This action arises from FOIA requests submitted by the Plaintiffs to the Federal \nBureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and DOJ’s National Security Division (“NSD”).  By letter dated \nMarch 6, 2017, Plaintiffs sought: \n1)  Any orders by the FISC authorizing surveillance of and/or \ncollection of information concerning the Trump Organization, \nPresident Trump, President Trump’s campaign for presidency, or \npeople associated with President Trump. \n2)  Any applications to the FISC seeking authorization for \nsurveillance of and/or collection of information concerning the \nTrump Organization, President Trump, President Trump’s \ncampaign for presidency, or people associated with President \nTrump. \n3)  Any minimization procedures issued by the FISC and that \napplied to any orders issued that fall within the scope of #1 or #2. \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 3 of 64\nSee Third Declaration of David Hardy, dated October 19, 2018, ¶ 6 (citing 1st Hardy Decl., Dkt. \n13-3, ¶ 5 & Exhibit A (FOIA Request));1 Declaration of Patrick N. Findlay, dated October 19, \n2018, ¶ 4 & Exhibit A (FOIA Request). \n2.  By email dated March 17, 2017, NSD refused to confirm or deny the existence of \nresponsive records pursuant to Exemption 1, explaining that to confirm or deny the existence of \nresponsive records would reveal information that is properly classified under Executive Order \n13526.  See Findlay Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. B (NSD Response). \n3.  On the same day, Plaintiffs appealed the determination to the DOJ Office of \nInformation Policy (“OIP”).  On April 12, 2017, OIP affirmed the determination of NSD – that \nthe existence or non-existence of responsive records is a properly classified fact.  See Findlay \nDecl. ¶ 6 & Ex. C (OIP Determination). \n4.  By letter dated March 16, 2017, the FBI acknowledged receipt of Plaintiffs’ \nrequest, and on April 4, 2017, the FBI also issued a Glomar response.   The FBI’s Glomar \nresponse was based on FOIA Exemptions (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(7)(A), and (b)(7)(E).  See 3rd Hardy \nDecl. ¶ 7 (citing 1st Hardy Decl., Dkt. 13-3, ¶ 11 & Ex. D). \nFactual Background. \n5.  DOJ has acknowledged a national security investigation of “the Russian \ngovernment’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election[, including] the nature of any \nlinks between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and \nwhether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts [and] an \nassessment of whether any crimes were committed.”  See The Washington Post, Full transcript: \n                                                           \n1 A redacted version of the Third Hardy Declaration is filed herewith on the public record.  A \nclassified version of the declaration is being concurrently lodged with the Court ex parte and in \ncamera, in order to more fully explain the basis for the withholding of exempt information. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 4 of 64\nFBI Director James Comey testifies on Russian interference in 2016 election (Mar. 20, 2017), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/03/20/full-transcript-fbi-director-\njames-comey-testifies-on-russian-interference-in-2016-election/?utm_term=.b9f19a0cf9cf; 3rd \nHardy Decl. ¶ 14 & n.3.  The investigation of Russian election interference is now under the \ndirection of Special Counsel Robert Mueller.  See Office of the Dep. Att’y General, Order No. \n3915-2017, Appointment of Special Counsel to Investigate Russian Interference with the 2016 \nPresidential Election and Related Matters (May 17, 2017), https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-\nrelease/file/967231/download; 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 16. \n6.  On March 4, 2017, President Trump’s Twitter account made a four-part post, \ncomplaining that President Obama had Mr. Trump’s “wires tapped in Trump Tower just before \nthe victory.”  See https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump.  During sworn testimony before the \nHouse Permanent Selection Committee on Intelligence (“HPSCI”) on March 20, 2017, then-FBI \nDirector James B. Comey was asked about this by Congressman Schiff and responded to address \nthis specific statement: \nWith respect to the President’s tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at \nhim by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those \ntweets and we have looked carefully inside the FBI. The Department of \nJustice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the \nDepartment of Justice and all its components. The Department has no \ninformation that supports those tweets. \n \nSee Full transcript: FBI Director James Comey testifies on Russian interference in 2016 election \n(Mar. 20, 2017); 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 26. \n  7.  In March 2017, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence \n(“HPSCI”) announced an investigation into “the Russian active measures campaign targeting the \n2016 U.S. election” and later added additional areas of inquiry, including allegations regarding \nthe purported “FISA abuse.”  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 15.  HPSCI’s review led to competing \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 5 of 64\nmemoranda authored by the Majority and the Minority members – often referred to by the names \nof the Chairman and the Ranking Member, i.e., as the “Nunes Memo” and the “Schiff Memo.”  \nBoth memoranda were initially classified because, at a minimum, they revealed FISA coverage \non an identified target – Carter Page – which was a properly classified fact.  Id. ¶ 17. \n  8.  In February 2018, President Trump authorized the declassification of the Nunes \nMemo, dated January 18, 2018.  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 19; Findlay Decl. ¶ 9; \nhttp://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/memo_and_white_house_letter.pdf.  As set forth in a \nFebruary 2, 2018, letter from the White House Counsel, the Nunes Memo was declassified “in \nlight of the significant public interest in the memorandum,” and “reflects the judgments of its \ncongressional authors.”  Id. \n  9.  Approximately three weeks after the public disclosure of the Nunes Memo, an \nunclassified, redacted version of the Schiff Memo, dated January 29, 2018, addressed to All \nMembers of the House of Representatives, and entitled “Correcting the Record – The Russia \nInvestigations” (“Minority Memo”), was released.  See \nhttps://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/ hpsci_redacted_minority_memo.pdf (last visited \nSept. 13, 2018).  Prior to its release, the FBI reviewed the Schiff Memo and redacted classified \ninformation unaffected by the President’s declassification of the Nunes Memo.  The FBI did not \ndeclassify additional information as part of this review.  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 20-22. \n  10.  Neither the Majority nor the Minority asked the FBI or the Department to opine \non their judgment or conclusions, and neither the FBI nor the Department did so; rather, both \nmemoranda reflect the judgments of their congressional authors.  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 20-22. \nFOIA Determination \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 6 of 64\n11.  Because the declassification of the Majority Memo and the subsequent release of \nthe redacted Minority Memo both revealed the existence of certain FISA applications and orders \nto conduct surveillance of Carter Page, the Department reviewed the FISA applications and \norders for potential release of segregable information in response to Plaintiffs’ FOIA request.  \nSee 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 24, 31-34, 134; Findlay Decl. ¶ 12.  On July 20, 2018, DOJ and the FBI \nreleased all responsive, non-exempt and reasonably segregable information subject to FOIA – \nreleasing 412 pages with redactions and withholding 186 pages in full.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 4, \n134-35; Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 11-12; see also https://vault.fbi.gov/d1-release/d1-release.  DOJ is thus \nno longer asserting a Glomar response with respect to the fact that Page was the subject of these \nFISA applications and orders.  Id. ¶ 4; Findlay Decl. ¶ 13.  This FOIA release was \nunprecedented—prior to the release, there had never been any public disclosure of an application \nto the FISC or an order from the FISC pertaining to a specific individual surveillance target.  3rd \nHardy Decl. ¶ 13. \n   12.  Other than the above-described disclosures, no authorized Government official \nhas confirmed or denied the existence of responsive FISA-related records.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ \n27, 143; Findlay Decl. ¶ 23.  Accordingly, DOJ maintains its Glomar response with respect to \nthe remainder of Plaintiffs’ request and refuses to confirm or deny the existence of other \nresponsive records. \nSearch for Documents Related to Acknowledged Carter Page Surveillance \n  13.  NSD and the FBI conducted a reasonable search for records responsive to \nPlaintiffs’ FOIA request insofar as it relates to the acknowledged Carter Page FISA applications.  \nThe official acknowledgement at issue here was limited to four specific FISA applications, \nsubmitted for surveillance on Carter Page, starting in October 2016 and continuing through three \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 7 of 64\nrenewals, with accompanying FISA orders.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 28.  Given the information \npinpointing the specific responsive records, FBI and NSD FOIA personnel consulted with \nknowledgeable officials in both components familiar with the investigation to locate the four \nresponsive FISA packages, encompassing the acknowledged applications and orders related to \nCarter Page.  Id. ¶¶ 28-30; Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 10-11.   As set forth in the Hardy Declaration, the \nrequest for minimization procedures did not require a separate search because those procedures \nare set forth in the packages.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 30.  The FBI and NSD compared records and \nconfirmed that they had complete copies of each of the four FISA packages whose existence had \nbeen officially acknowledged.  Id. ¶ 28. \n  14.  The FBI coordinated the review of these documents, and NSD participated in the \nprocess.  Accordingly, the FBI is asserting all applicable exemptions over these materials.  \nFindlay Decl. ¶ 12 & n.6; 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 31. \nExemption One and Carter Page Documents \n  15.  David M. Hardy is an original classification authority.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 2. \n  16.  Mr. Hardy determined that information withheld from the Carter Page documents \npursuant to Exemption 1 is under control of the United States Government, and contains \ninformation pertaining to intelligence activities, sources or methods.  See Executive Order 13526 \n§§ 1.4(c).  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 43, 46-63. \n  17.  In particular, Mr. Hardy has determined that the information pertaining to \nintelligence activities, sources and methods includes the FBI’s intelligence interests, priorities, \nactivities and methods; undisclosed intelligence sources or methods upon which the FBI relied in \nsupport of its application for FISA coverage on Carter Page, as well as undisclosed portions of \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 8 of 64\nintelligence information provided by Source #1; and information about the use and \nimplementation of various intelligence methods.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 49. \n  18.  Mr. Hardy has determined that disclosure of this information pertaining to \nintelligence sources and methods in these documents would cause harm to national security, and \nhas articulated the harm that could be expected to occur.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 49-63. \n  19.  Mr. Hardy has further determined that information in the Carter Page documents \npertains to foreign relations, and determined that disclosure of such information would cause \nharm to national security.  Mr. Hardy has articulated the harm that could be expected to occur.  \n3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 49, 64-67. \nExemption Three and Carter Page Documents \n  20.  DOJ also withheld information in the Carter Page documents to protect \nintelligence sources and methods from disclosure under Exemption 3 and the National Security \nAct.  Mr. Hardy articulated the risk of disclosure of intelligence sources and methods.  3rd Hardy \nDecl. ¶¶ 68-72. \n  21.  DOJ also redacted information pursuant to another Exemption 3 statute, which \ncannot be publicly identified without revealing the very information to be protected.  Id. ¶ 73. \nExemption 7 and the Carter Page Documents \n  22.  The FISA applications and orders are compiled in part for law enforcement \npurposes.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 74-79. \n  23.  DOJ withheld information from these documents pursuant to Exemption 7(A).  \nMr. Hardy has determined that disclosure of redacted information in the Carter Page FISA \ndocuments could reasonably be expected to interfere with the pending investigation into Russian \nelection interference if publicly disclosed at this time, and has articulated the harms that would \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 9 of 64\noccur.  The types of information that could reasonably be expected to harm the investigation if \ndisclosed include:  aspects of the investigation not previously made public, what information or \nactivities are or are not of interest to the investigators, areas in which there may be gaps in \ninvestigators’ knowledge that could be exploited, and the identities of potential witnesses and the \ninformation they provided.  3rd  Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 80-91. \n24.  DOJ withheld information under Exemption 7(D) because certain investigatory \ninformation would reveal the identity or information of confidential sources.  This includes \nnonpublic information about and provided by Christopher Steele, as well as information about \nand provided by other confidential sources, all of whom were provided express assurances of \nconfidentiality.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 112-18. \n  25.  DOJ withheld eight categories of information in the Carter Page documents \npursuant to Exemption 7(E):  information about the investigative focus of these applications; \ninformation about collection and analysis of information; information about specific techniques \nused in the national security investigations; information about specific databases used for law \nenforcement purposes; information about payments to confidential sources; detailed information \nabout targets, dates and scope of surveillance; information about dates and types of \ninvestigations; and investigative strategies for particular evidence.  Mr. Hardy determined each \nof the nine categories encompasses nonpublic information about law enforcement techniques and \nhas articulated how its disclosure risks circumvention of the law.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 119-33. \nPrivate Information in the Carter Page Documents \n  26.  DOJ withheld four categories of private information in the Carter Page documents \npursuant to Exemption 6 and Exemption 7(E):  identifying information for FBI agents; personal \ninformation about Carter Page; identifying information about a FISC deputy clerk and an NSD \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 10 of 64\nattorney; and identifying information about a third party source.  For each category, the FBI \narticulated and balanced the person’s substantial privacy interest in nondisclosure and the public \ninterest in the withheld information.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 92-111. \nWithheld in Full Pages from FISA Packages \n  27.  DOJ withheld 186 pages in full from the Carter Page FISA packages pursuant to \nExemptions 1, 3, 7(A), and 7(E).  Mr. Hardy determined that disclosure would reveal classified \nintelligence methods and law enforcement techniques.  There is no additional information that \ncan be provided on the public record but the justification for withholding is similar to the \njustification for other redactions under these exemptions.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 135-41. \nSegregability Analysis \n  28.  DOJ released all reasonably segregable, non-exempt information from the Carter \nPage documents.  DOJ conducted a document- by-document and line-by-line review to ensure \nthat all reasonably segregable, non-exempt information was released, taking into account the \npublic disclosures related to this matter.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 134. \nPartial Glomar \n29.  DOJ has refused to confirm or deny the existence of FISA applications and orders \nbeyond the four previously acknowledged Carter Page packages.  Accordingly, DOJ has refused \nto confirm or deny whether there are responsive record beyond the limited disclosures outlined \nabove, pursuant to Exemptions 1, 3, 7(A) and 7(E).  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 142-46; Findlay Decl. ¶¶ \n14-15 (asserting Exemption 1). \n30.  Patrick Findlay is an original classification authority.  He determined that the \ninformation withheld by NSD – the existence or nonexistence of other responsive records – is \nprotected by Exemption 1.  Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 2, 14-22. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 11 of 64\n31.  David M. Hardy is an original classification authority.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 2.  He \ndetermined that the information withheld by FBI – the existence or nonexistence of other \nresponsive records – is protected by Exemption 1.  Id. ¶¶ 143-44, 152-60. \n32.  Mr. Hardy has determined that the existence or nonexistence of other responsive \nrecords pertains to intelligence activities, sources and methods, and Mr. Hardy has articulated the \nharm to national security that would result from disclosure of the existence or nonexistence of \nother responsive records.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 147-55. \n33.  Mr. Findlay has determined that the existence or nonexistence of other responsive \nrecords is currently and properly classified and is therefore properly withheld pursuant to \nExemption 1.   That information pertains to intelligence activities, sources and methods, and Mr. \nFindlay has articulated the harm to national security that would result from disclosure of the \nexistence or nonexistence of other responsive records.  Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 14-22. \n34.  The information withheld pursuant to Exemption 1 also pertains to foreign \nrelations, and Mr. Hardy has articulated the harm to national security that would result from \ndisclosure of the existence or nonexistence of other responsive records.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶  156-\n60.    \n35.  Mr. Hardy further determined that disclosure of the existence or non-existence of \nresponsive records risks disclosure of intelligence sources and methods and is therefore protected \nby the National Security Act and Exemption 3.   See 3rd Hardy Decl. at ¶¶ 161-64. \n36.  Mr. Hardy further determined that FISA applications and FISC orders – when \nthey exist – are records compiled for law enforcement purposes within the meaning of \nExemption 7.  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 164-65. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 12 of 64\n37.  Mr. Hardy further determined that disclosure of the existence or non-existence of \nother responsive records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings \nthat are pending or reasonably anticipated, and that the information is therefore properly \nwithheld under Exemption 7(A).   The withheld information pertains to the pending Russia \ninvestigation and that its disclosure could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement \nproceedings.  Mr. Hardy has articulated the anticipated harm.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 166-69. \n38.  Mr. Hardy further determined that disclosure of the existence or non-existence of \nother responsive records would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement \ninvestigations and that such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the \nlaw, and that the information is therefore properly withheld under Exemption 7(E).  Disclosure \nwould reveal nonpublic information about whether the FBI is employing specific investigative \ntechniques against specific targets and would reveal nonpublic information when and under what \ncircumstances the FBI relies upon FISA-authorized techniques.  Mr. Hardy has articulated how \nsuch disclosure risks circumvention of the law.   3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 170-72. \nOfficial Acknowledgement \n39.  No authorized government official has disclosed the precise information withheld.  \nSee 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 13, 25, 27, 44, 134, 143; Findlay Decl. ¶ 23. \n \n \nDated:  October 19, 2018        Respectfully Submitted, \n \nCHAD READLER \nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Attorney General \n   \nMARCIA BERMAN \nAssistant Director, Federal Programs Branch \n \n/s/Amy E.

More specifically, Plaintiffs seek to \ncompel production of FISA applications and orders dating from mid-2016, “concerning the \nTrump Organization, President Trump, President Trump’s campaign for presidency, or people \nassociated with President Trump.” \nThe Government has made two acknowledgments arguably relevant to this request.  First, \nthe Department of Justice acknowledged, based upon the Congressional testimony of then-FBI \nDirector James B. Comey, that it has no records of alleged wiretapping of then-candidate Trump \nin Trump Tower by the Obama administration prior to the 2016 presidential election, as \nreferenced in President Trump’s Twitter post on March 4, 2017.  In addition, following the \nPresident’s declassification of a memorandum prepared by staff of the House Permanent Select \nCommittee on Intelligence (“HPSCI”), and the subsequent release of a different memorandum \nprepared by certain HPSCI members, the Department has acknowledged responsive Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”) applications and orders to conduct surveillance of Carter \nPage, and produced redacted versions of those documents.  With these limited exceptions, DOJ \nhas otherwise provided a “Glomar” response, declining to confirm or deny the existence of \nrecords for any other FISA surveillance responsive to Plaintiffs’ FOIA request. \nThe applications and orders related to Carter Page were properly located, processed, \nredacted and produced, with some pages being withheld in full.  These documents, at issue in \nseveral pending FOIA matters, are the first FISA applications ever processed for public release, \nand the FBI and DOJ devoted considerable resources to ensure that they were carefully \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 24 of 64\nprocessed, releasing information that matched prior public disclosures as well as other \ninformation that is not currently exempt.  The FBI declaration establishes that some withheld \ninformation is properly classified and exempt from disclosure because it pertains to intelligence \nactivities, sources, and methods, and/or foreign relations or foreign activities of the United \nStates, and its disclosure would cause harm to national security; it is therefore properly withheld \nunder Exemption 1.  The FBI’s declaration further establishes that disclosure of the withheld \ninformation would reveal intelligence sources and methods protected by Exemption 3 and the \nNational Security Act, as well as law enforcement information protected by Exemptions 7(A), \n7(D) and 7(E), and private information protected by Exemptions 6 and 7(C).  These records \nrelate to an ongoing national security investigation, and full disclosure would undermine and \nobstruct that investigation, compromise sources, and reveal nonpublic information about \nimportant law enforcement methods, disclosure of which risks circumvention of the law. \nThe partial Glomar response to the remainder of Plaintiffs’ FOIA request is proper.  The \ndeclarations establish that confirming or denying the existence of other responsive records would \nreveal classified information pertaining to intelligence sources and methods.  DOJ and the FBI \ndetermined that disclosure of the existence or non-existence of records for any other FISA \nsurveillance responsive to Plaintiffs’ FOIA request could reasonably be expected to cause harm \nto national security, and is exempt from disclosure pursuant to FOIA Exemption 1.  FBI has \nfurther determined that this information is exempt from disclosure under Exemptions 3, 7(A) and \n7(E).  This determination is entitled to substantial deference from this Court under well-settled \nlaw. \nThere has been no official acknowledgement of the existence or non-existence of FISA \napplications or orders as to a range of potential surveillance targets.  The limited official \nacknowledgements relevant to Plaintiffs’ FOIA request—then-Director Comey’s Congressional \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 25 of 64\ntestimony regarding the non-existence of records of alleged wiretapping of then-candidate \nTrump in Trump Tower by the Obama Administration prior to the 2016 presidential election, and \nthe extraordinary and unprecedented acknowledgement of the existence of FISA applications and \norders to conduct surveillance of Carter Page—satisfy the exacting criteria for official disclosure \nof classified information responsive to Plaintiffs’ FOIA request, and the Department’s response \nis consistent with those disclosures.  But there have been no other official disclosures that \nspecifically reveal the existence or non-existence of the particular alleged FISA surveillance that \nPlaintiffs seek to discover.  Accordingly, the Glomar response as to the remaining portions of \nPlaintiffs’ request is proper.  The Court should defer to Defendant’s determination in this regard \nand grant the Government summary judgment. \nBACKGROUND \nAdministrative and Procedural Background \nThis matter arises from nearly identical FOIA requests submitted to the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation (“FBI”) and DOJ’s National Security Division (“NSD”) on March 6, 2017, in \nwhich Plaintiffs sought records related to specific individuals and organizations allegedly subject \nto surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”).  Specifically, Plaintiffs \nsought: \n1)  Any orders by the FISC authorizing surveillance of and/or \ncollection of information concerning the Trump Organization, \nPresident Trump, President Trump’s campaign for presidency, or \npeople associated with President Trump. \n2)  Any applications to the FISC seeking authorization for \nsurveillance of and/or collection of information concerning the \nTrump Organization, President Trump, President Trump’s \ncampaign for presidency, or people associated with President \nTrump. \n3)  Any minimization procedures issued by the FISC and that \napplied to any orders issued that fall within the scope of #1 or #2. \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 26 of 64\nSee Third Declaration of David Hardy, dated October 19, 2018, ¶ 6 (citing 1st Hardy Decl., Dkt. \n13-3, ¶ 5 & Exhibit A (FOIA Request));1 Declaration of Patrick N. Findlay, dated October 19, \n2018, ¶ 4 & Exhibit A (FOIA Request).  The requests limited the search to June 2016 to the date \nof the request.  Id.  JMP quoted certain public statements by President Trump and asserted that \nthe requesters “are pre-emptively asserting that President Trump’s public comments constitute \nprior official disclosure of the existence of at least one, if not more, FISA warrants.”  Id. \n  By email dated March 17, 2017, NSD refused to confirm or deny the existence of \nresponsive records pursuant to Exemption 1, explaining that to confirm or deny the existence of \nresponsive records would reveal information that is properly classified under Executive Order \n13526.  See Findlay Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. B (NSD Response).  This is known as a “Glomar” response, \nand is proper if the fact of the existence or non-existence of agency records is protected by a \nFOIA exemption.  See Phillippi v. CIA, 546 F.2d 1009, 1011 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (acknowledging \nCIA refusal to confirm or deny existence of records regarding activities of a ship named Hughes \nGlomar Explorer).   On the same day, Plaintiffs appealed the determination to the DOJ Office of \nInformation Policy (“OIP”).  On April 12, 2017, OIP affirmed the determination of NSD – that \nthe existence or non-existence of responsive records is a properly classified fact.  See Findlay \nDecl. ¶ 6 & Ex. C (OIP Determination).  \n  By letter dated March 16, 2017, the FBI acknowledged receipt of Plaintiffs’ request, and \non April 4, 2017, the FBI also issued a Glomar response.  The FBI’s Glomar response was based \non FOIA Exemptions (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(7)(A), and (b)(7)(E).  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 7 (citing 1st \nHardy Decl., Dkt. 13-3, ¶ 11 & Ex. D). \n                                                           \n1 A redacted version of the Hardy Declaration is filed herewith on the public record.  A classified \nversion of the declaration is being concurrently lodged with the Court ex parte and in camera, in \norder to more fully explain the basis for the withholding of exempt information. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 27 of 64\n  Plaintiffs filed a Complaint on April 4, 2017 and an Amended Complaint was filed on \nApril 15, 2017.  See Compl., ECF No. 1; Am. Compl. ECF No. 5. \n  The parties briefed cross-motions for summary judgment in summer and fall of 2017, and \nDefendant defended the Glomar response.  In light of subsequent disclosures, DOJ sought to \nwithdraw its motion for summary judgment and set a schedule for processing the acknowledged \nCarter Page materials.  After the Carter Page materials were processed and released, the Court \nset a schedule for further briefing.  Dkt. No. 38. \nFactual Background \nPlaintiffs’ FOIA request arises in a factual context in which there is an ongoing, \nacknowledged official investigation related to the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the \n2016 presidential election.  Specifically, the Department has acknowledged a national security \ninvestigation of “the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election[, \nincluding] the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and \nthe Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and \nRussia’s efforts [and] an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.”  See The \nWashington Post, Full transcript: FBI Director James Comey testifies on Russian interference in \n2016 election (Mar. 20, 2017), https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-\npolitics/wp/2017/03/20/full-transcript-fbi-director-james-comey-testifies-on-russian-interference-\nin-2016-election/?utm_term=.b9f19a0cf9cf; 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 14 & n.3.  The investigation into \nRussian election interference is now under the direction of Special Counsel Robert Mueller.  See \nOffice of the Dep. Att’y General, Order No. 3915-2017, Appointment of Special Counsel to \nInvestigate Russian Interference with the 2016 Presidential Election and Related Matters (May \n17, 2017), https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/967231 /download; 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ \n16. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 28 of 64\nOn March 4, 2017, President Trump’s Twitter account made a four-part post, \ncomplaining that President Obama had Mr. Trump’s “wires tapped in Trump Tower just before \nthe victory.”  See https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump.  During sworn testimony before the \nHouse Permanent Selection Committee on Intelligence (“HPSCI”) on March 20, 2017, then-FBI \nDirector James B. Comey was asked about this by Congressman Schiff and responded to address \nthis specific statement: \nWith respect to the President’s tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at \nhim by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those \ntweets and we have looked carefully inside the FBI. The Department of \nJustice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the \nDepartment of Justice and all its components. The Department has no \ninformation that supports those tweets. \n \nSee Full transcript: FBI Director James Comey testifies on Russian interference in 2016 election \n(Mar. 20, 2017); 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 26; Findlay Decl. ¶ 8.2   \n  In March 2017, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (“HPSCI”) \nannounced an investigation into “the Russian active measures campaign targeting the 2016 U.S. \nelection” and later added additional areas of inquiry, including allegations regarding the \npurported “FISA abuse.”  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 15.  HPSCI’s review led to competing \nmemoranda authored by the Majority and the Minority members – often referred to by the names \nof the Chairman and the Ranking Member, i.e., as the “Nunes Memo” and the “Schiff Memo.”  \nBoth memoranda were initially classified because, at a minimum, they revealed FISA-authorized \nsurveillance on an identified target – Carter Page – which was a properly classified fact.  Id. ¶ 17. \n                                                           \n2 The Department has subsequently confirmed Director Comey’s conclusion in several FOIA \nmatters.  In the first round of summary judgment briefing in this case, Defendant specifically \nacknowledged this statement and noted that “Had plaintiff more specifically tied his FOIA \nrequest to the information in the tweets, he likely would have received a no-records response \nfrom the FBI and DOJ.”  Dkt. No. 13, at 20. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 29 of 64\nIn February 2018, President Trump authorized the declassification of the Nunes Memo, dated \nJanuary 18, 2018.  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 19; Findlay Decl. ¶ 9; \nhttp://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/memo_and_white_house_letter.pdf.   \nAs set forth in a February 2, 2018, letter from the White House Counsel, the Nunes \nMemo was declassified “in light of the significant public interest in the memorandum,” and \n“reflects the judgments of its congressional authors.”  Id.  Approximately three weeks after the \npublic disclosure of the Nunes Memo, an unclassified, redacted version of the Schiff Memo, \ndated January 29, 2018, addressed to All Members of the House of Representatives, and entitled \n“Correcting the Record – The Russia Investigations” (“Minority Memo”), was released.  See 3rd \nHardy Decl. ¶¶ 20-22, also available at https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/ \nhpsci_redacted_minority_memo.pdf (last visited Sept. 13, 2018).  Prior to its release, the FBI \nreviewed the Schiff Memo and redacted classified information unaffected by the President’s \ndeclassification of the Nunes Memo.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 21.  The FBI did not declassify additional \ninformation as part of this review.  Id.  Neither the Majority nor the Minority asked the FBI or \nthe Department to opine on their judgment or conclusions, and neither the FBI nor the \nDepartment did so; rather, both memoranda reflect the judgments of their congressional authors.  \nId. ¶ 22.3 \nBecause the declassification of the Majority Memo and the subsequent release of the \nredacted Minority Memo both revealed the existence of certain FISA applications and orders to \nconduct surveillance of Carter Page, the Department reviewed the FISA applications and orders \n                                                           \n3 One other Congressional memorandum references the Page FISA applications.  After the \ndeclassification of the Nunes Memo, the FBI conducted a classification review of a January 4, \n2018 memorandum from Senators Grassley and Graham as well.  As with the other memoranda, \nthis memorandum reflects the judgments of its Congressional authors.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 22 & n. \n6. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 30 of 64\nfor potential release of segregable information in response to Plaintiffs’ FOIA request.4  See 3rd \nHardy Decl. ¶¶ 24, 31-34, 134; Findlay Decl. ¶ 9.  On July 20, 2018, DOJ and the FBI released \nall responsive, non-exempt and reasonably segregable information subject to FOIA – releasing \n412 pages with redactions and withholding 186 pages in full.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 4, 134-35; \nFindlay Decl. ¶¶ 9-12; see also https://vault.fbi.gov/d1-release/d1-release.   The redactions are \ncoded by application exemption and certain categories within exemptions.  3rd Hardy Decl.  ¶¶ \n31-34.  DOJ is thus no longer asserting a Glomar response with respect to the fact that Page was \nthe subject of these FISA applications and orders.  Id. ¶ 4; Findlay Decl. ¶ 13.  This FOIA release \nwas unprecedented—prior to the release, there had never been any public disclosure of an \napplication to the FISC or an order from the FISC pertaining to a specific individual surveillance \ntarget.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 13; Findlay Decl. ¶ 12. \nOther than the above-described disclosures, no authorized Government official has \nconfirmed or denied the existence of responsive FISA-related records.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 27, \n143; Findlay Decl. ¶ 23.5  Accordingly, DOJ maintains its Glomar response with respect to the \nremainder of Plaintiffs’ request and refuses to confirm or deny the existence of other responsive \nrecords. \n \n \n                                                           \n4 Although Page was not associated with the Trump campaign when the initial FISA order was \nobtained, the Page FISA applications and orders were deemed to be responsive at least to that \nportion of Plaintiffs’ FOIA request that seeks FISA applications and orders “concerning . . . \npeople associated with President Trump.” \n5 On September 17, 2018, the White House Press Secretary announced that President Trump was \ndirecting DOJ and ODNI to “provide for immediate declassification of” certain documents, \nincluding additional pages of the Page documents.  See Statement from the Press Secretary, \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-34/.   The President \nlater indicated that he was no longer requiring immediate declassification of these documents at \nthis time. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 31 of 64\nARGUMENT \nI.  Statutory Standards.  \nA.  The Freedom of Information Act  \nThe “basic purpose” of FOIA reflects a “general philosophy of full agency disclosure \nunless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language.” John Doe Agency v. \nJohn Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146, 152 (1989) (citation omitted).  “Congress recognized, however, \nthat public disclosure is not always in the public interest . . . .”  CIA v. Sims, 471 U.S. 159, 166–\n67 (1985).  Accordingly, in passing FOIA, “Congress sought ‘to reach a workable balance \nbetween the right of the public to know and the need of the Government to keep information in \nconfidence to the extent necessary without permitting indiscriminate secrecy.’”  John Doe \nAgency, 493 U.S. at 152 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 89-1497, at 6 (1966), reprinted in 1966 \nU.S.C.C.A.N. 2418, 2423).  As the D.C. Circuit has recognized, “FOIA represents a balance \nstruck by Congress between the public’s right to know and the [G]overnment’s legitimate \ninterest in keeping certain information confidential.”  Ctr. for Nat’l Sec. Studies v. DOJ, 331 \nF.3d 918, 925 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (citing John Doe Agency, 493 U.S. at 152).  \nFOIA mandates disclosure of government records unless the requested information falls \nwithin one of nine enumerated exemptions.  See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b).  “A district court only has \njurisdiction to compel an agency to disclose improperly withheld agency records,” i.e. records \nthat do “not fall within an exemption.”  Minier v. CIA, 88 F.3d 796, 803 (9th Cir. 1996); see also \n5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) (providing the district court with jurisdiction only “to enjoin the agency \nfrom withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly \nwithheld from the complainant”); Kissinger v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 445 \nU.S. 136, 150 (1980) (“Under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B)[,] federal jurisdiction is dependent upon a \nshowing that an agency has (1) ‘improperly’; (2) ‘withheld’; (3) ‘agency records.’”).  While \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 32 of 64\nnarrowly construed, FOIA’s statutory exemptions “are intended to have meaningful reach and \napplication.” John Doe Agency, 493 U.S. at 152; accord DiBacco v.U.S. Army, 795 F.3d 178, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  \nThe courts resolve most FOIA actions on summary judgment.  See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. \nDep't of the Navy, 25 F. Supp. 3d 131, 136 (D.D.C. 2014).  The Government bears the burden of \nproving that the withheld information falls within the exemptions it invokes.  See 5 U.S.C. § \n552(a)(4)(B); King v. DOJ, 830 F.2d 210, 217 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  A court may grant summary \njudgment to the Government based entirely on an agency’s declarations, provided they articulate \n“the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific detail, demonstrate that the \ninformation withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption, and are not controverted by \neither contrary evidence in the record nor by evidence of agency bad faith.” Military Audit \nProject v. Casey, 656 F.2d 724, 738 (D.C. Cir. 1981); accord Gov’t Accountability Project v. \nFood & Drug Admin., 206 F. Supp. 3d 420, 430 (D.D.C. 2016).  Such declarations are accorded \n“a presumption of good faith, which cannot be rebutted by purely speculative claims[.]” \nSafeCard Servs., Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (citation omitted).  \nB.  Special Considerations in National Security Cases \nThe issues presented in this case directly “implicat[e] national security, a uniquely \nexecutive purview.” Ctr. for Nat’l Sec. Studies, 331 F.3d at 926–27.  While courts review de \nnovo an agency’s withholding of information pursuant to a FOIA request, “de novo review in \nFOIA cases is not everywhere alike . . . .”  Ass’n of Retired R.R. Workers, Inc. v. U.S. R.R. Ret. \nBd., 830 F.2d 331, 336 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  Indeed, the courts have specifically recognized the \n“propriety of deference to the executive in the context of FOIA claims which implicate national \nsecurity.”  Ctr. for Nat’l Sec. Studies, 331 F.3d at 927; see Ray v. Turner, 587 F.2d 1187, 1194 \n(D.C. Cir. 1978) (“[T]he executive ha[s] unique insights into what adverse [e]ffects might occur \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 33 of 64\nas a result of public disclosure of a particular classified record.”). “[A]ccordingly, the \ngovernment’s ‘arguments needs only be both ‘plausible’ and ‘logical’ to justify the invocation of \na FOIA exemption in the national security context.’” Unrow Human Rights Impact Litig. Clinic \nv. Dep’t of State, 134 F. Supp. 3d 263, 272 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting ACLU v. Dep’t of Def., 628 \nF.3d 612, 624 (D.C. Cir. 2011)).  \nFor these reasons, the courts have “consistently deferred to executive affidavits predicting \nharm to the national security, and have found it unwise to undertake searching judicial review.”  \nCtr. for Nat’l Sec. Studies, 331 F.3d at 927; see Larson v. Dep’t of State, 565 F.3d 857, 865 \n(D.C. Cir. 2009) (citation omitted) (“Today we reaffirm our deferential posture in FOIA cases \nregarding the ‘uniquely executive purview’ of national security.”); accord Unrow Human Rights \nImpact Litig. Clinic, 134 F. Supp. 3d at 272.  Consequently, a reviewing court must afford \n“substantial weight” to agency declarations “in the national security context.”  King, 830 F.2d at \n217; see Fitzgibbon v. CIA, 911 F.2d 755, 766 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (holding that the district court \nerred in “perform[ing] its own calculus as to whether or not harm to the national security or to \nintelligence sources and methods would result from disclosure . . . .”); Frugone v. CIA, 169 F.3d \n772, 775 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (because “courts have little expertise in either international diplomacy \nor counterintelligence operations, we are in no position to dismiss the CIA’s facially reasonable \nconcerns” about the harm that disclosure could cause to national security).  FOIA “bars the \ncourts from prying loose from the government even the smallest bit of information that is \nproperly classified or would disclose intelligence sources or methods.” Afshar v. Dep’t of State, \n702 F.2d 1125, 1130 (D.C. Cir. 1983). \nC.  The Glomar Response. \nA Glomar response allows the Government to “refuse to confirm or deny the existence of \nrecords where to answer the FOIA inquiry would cause harm cognizable under an FOIA \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 34 of 64\nexception.”  Wolf v. CIA, 473 F.3d 370, 374 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (quoting Gardels v. CIA, 689 F.2d \n1100, 1103 (D.C. Cir. 1982)); accord Wilner v. NSA, 592 F.3d 60, 68 (2d Cir. 2009) (“The \nGlomar doctrine is well settled as a proper response to a FOIA request because it is the only way \nin which an agency may assert that a particular FOIA statutory exemption covers the ‘existence \nor non-existence of the requested records[.]’” (quoting Phillippi v. CIA, 546 F.2d 1009, 1012 \n(D.C. Cir. 1976)).  In support of a Glomar response, the asserting agency “must explain why it \ncan neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records.”  James Madison Project v. \nDOJ, 208 F. Supp. 3d 265, 283 (D.D.C. 2016) (quoting Parker v. EOUSA, 852 F. Supp. 2d 1, 10 \n(D.D.C. 2012)).  The agency can satisfy this obligation by providing “public affidavit[s] \nexplaining in as much detail as is possible the basis for its claim that it can be required neither to \nconfirm nor to deny the existence of the requested records.”  Phillippi, 546 F.2d at 1013. \nThe courts in this Circuit have consistently upheld Glomar responses where, as here, confirming \nor denying the existence of records would reveal classified information protected by FOIA \nExemption 1.  See, e.g., Frugone, 169 F.3d at 774–75 (finding that CIA properly refused to \nconfirm or deny the existence of records concerning the plaintiff’s alleged employment \nrelationship with CIA pursuant to Exemptions 1 and 3); Larson, 565 F.3d at 861–62 (upholding \nthe National Security Agency’s use of the Glomar response to the plaintiffs’ FOIA requests \nregarding past violence in Guatemala pursuant to Exemptions 1 and 3); Wheeler v. CIA, 271 F. \nSupp. 2d 132, 140 (D.D.C. 2003) (ruling that CIA properly invoked a Glomar response to a \nrequest for records concerning the plaintiff’s activities as a journalist in Cuba during the 1960s \npursuant to Exemption 1). \n \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 35 of 64\nII.  DOJ Conducted a Reasonable Search for Responsive Records Related to \nAcknowledged Surveillance of Carter Page and Properly Released Redacted \nRecords. \n \nNSD and the FBI searched for the acknowledged FISA applications and orders related to \nCarter Page.  The 412 released pages reflect information properly redacted under Exemptions 1, \n3, 6, 7(A), 7(C), 7(D), 7(E).   The withheld in full pages from the FISA applications and orders \nwere properly withheld pursuant to Exemptions 1, 3, 7(A) and 7(E). \nA.   DOJ Conducted a Reasonable Search. \nAn agency is entitled to summary judgment in a FOIA case with respect to the adequacy \nof its search if it shows “‘that it made a good faith effort to conduct a search for the requested \nrecords, using methods which can be reasonably expected to produce the information \nrequested.’” Clemente v. FBI, 867 F.3d 111, 117 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quoting Oglesby v. Dep’t of \nthe Army, 920 F.2d 57, 68 (D.C. Cir. 1990)); DiBacco, 795 F.3d at 188.  “[T]he issue to be \nresolved is not whether there might exist any other documents possibly responsive to the request, \nbut rather whether the search for those documents was adequate.”  Weisberg v. DOJ, 745 F.2d \n1476, 1485 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (emphasis in original).  The search is thus gauged “not by the fruits \nof the search, but by the appropriateness of the methods used to carry out the search.” Ancient \nCoin Collectors Guild v. Dep’t of State, 641 F.3d 504, 514 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Iturralde v. \nComptroller of Currency, 315 F.3d 311, 315 (D.C. Cir. 2003)).  An agency can establish the \nreasonableness of its search by “reasonably detailed, nonconclusory affidavits describing its \nefforts.”  Baker & Hostetler LLP v. Dep’t of Commerce, 473 F.3d 312, 318 (D.C. Cir. 2006). \nSuch affidavits are sufficient if they “set[] forth the search terms and the type of search \nperformed, and aver[] that all files likely to contain responsive materials (if such records exist) \nwere searched.”  Chambers v. Dep’t of Interior, 568 F.3d 998, 1003 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting \nMcCready v. Nicholson, 465 F.3d 1, 14 (D.C. Cir. 2006)).  This standard is not demanding. “[I]n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 36 of 64\nthe absence of countervailing evidence or apparent inconsistency of proof, affidavits that explain \nin reasonable detail the scope and method of the search conducted by the agency will suffice . . . \n. “ Perry v. Block, 684 F.2d 121, 127 (D.C. Cir. 1982).  “Agency affidavits are accorded a \npresumption of good faith, which cannot be rebutted by ‘purely speculative claims about the \nexistence and discoverability of other documents.’” SafeCard Servs., Inc., 926 F.2d at 1200 \n(citation omitted). \n  The declarations demonstrate that NSD and the FBI conducted a reasonable search for \nrecords responsive to Plaintiffs’ FOIA request insofar as it relates to the acknowledged Carter \nPage FISA applications.  The official acknowledgement at issue here was limited to four specific \nFISA applications, submitted for surveillance on Carter Page, starting in October 2016 and \ncontinuing through three renewals, with accompanying FISA orders.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 28.  \nGiven the information pinpointing the specific responsive records, FBI and NSD FOIA \npersonnel consulted with knowledgeable officials in both components familiar with the \ninvestigation to locate the four responsive FISA packages, encompassing the acknowledged \napplications and orders related to Carter Page.  Id. ¶¶ 28-30; Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 10-11.   As set \nforth in the Hardy Declaration, the request for minimization procedures did not require a separate \nsearch because those procedures are set forth in the packages.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 30.  The FBI \nand the National Security Division compared records and confirmed that they had complete \ncopies of each of the four FISA packages whose existence had been officially acknowledged.  Id. \n¶ 28.  FBI then coordinated the processing of the documents, in consultation with interested \ncomponents.  Id. ¶ 31; Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 11-12 & n. 6. \n  This strategy – identifying the personnel responsible for the requested FISC information, \nand asking them to search their records – is a “method[] which can be reasonably expected to \nproduce the information requested.” Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68; see also James Madison Project v. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 37 of 64\nDOJ, 267 F. Supp. 3d 154, 160-61 (D.D.C. 2017).  Therefore, DOJ is entitled to summary \njudgment on this issue. \nB.  DOJ Properly Redacted Classified Information in the Carter Page Documents \nPursuant to Exemption 1.6 \n \n(1) Exemption One Standards. \nFOIA Exemption 1 exempts from disclosure information that is “specifically authorized \nunder criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national \ndefense or foreign policy” and “are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order.” \n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1).  Under Executive Order No. 13,526, an agency may withhold information \nthat an official with original classification authority has determined to be classified because its \n“unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause identifiable or describable \ndamage to the national security[.]”  Exec. Order No. 13,526 § 1.4, 75 Fed. Reg. 707, 709 (Dec. \n29, 2009).  The information must also “pertain[] to” one of the categories of information \nspecified in the Executive Order, including “intelligence activities (including covert action), \nintelligence sources or methods,” Exec. Order No. 13,526 §§ 1.4(c); or “foreign relations or \nforeign activities of the United States, including confidential sources,” id. §1.4(d).  See also \nJudicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Defense, 715 F.3d 937, 941 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (citation omitted) \n(“‘[P]ertains’ is ‘not a very demanding verb.’”).  As discussed above, a court “accord[s] \nsubstantial weight to an agency’s affidavit concerning the details of the classified status of the \ndisputed record because the Executive departments responsible for national defense and foreign \npolicy matters have unique insights into what adverse [e]ffects might occur as a result of a \nparticular classified record.”  Larson, 565 F.3d at 864 (citation omitted). \n                                                           \n6 The FBI coordinated the review of these documents, and NSD participated in the process.  \nAccordingly, the FBI is asserting all applicable exemptions over these materials.  Findlay Decl. ¶ \n12 & n.6; 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 31. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 38 of 64\n(2) DOJ Properly Withheld Information Pertaining to Intelligence Activities, \nSources and Methods. \n \nDefendant redacted portions of the Carter Page FISA applications and orders to safeguard \ncurrently and properly classified information involving categories of information set forth in \nSection 1.4 of Executive Order 13,526.  See 3rd Hardy Decl. at ¶¶ 35-67.  Id.  First, the redacted \ninformation pertains to “intelligence activities (including covert action), intelligence sources or \nmethods, or cryptology.” Exec. Order 13,526 §1.4(c).  FISA surveillance is an intelligence \nmethod, and the request on its face seeks information pertaining to FISA surveillance.  The \nsupporting declaration establishes that information redacted from these FISA packages \nencompasses “the FBI’s intelligence interests, priorities, activities and methods; undisclosed \nintelligence sources or methods upon which the FBI relied in support of its application for FISA \nauthorized surveillance of Carter Page, as well as undisclosed portions of intelligence \ninformation provided by Source #1; and information about the use and implementation of \nvarious intelligence methods.”  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 49. \nThe Third Hardy Declaration identifies two general categories of information withheld on \nthis basis and describes the specific harm to national security that would result from disclosure:  \nactivities and methods; and intelligence sources.  First, the redacted information includes details \nabout the FISA surveillance sought and obtained through the FISA applications and orders – \nsuch as dates, locations, intended purposes, and specific methods -- as well as detailed, \nundisclosed information about other intelligence activities and methods forming part of the \nunderlying basis for the applications.  3rd Hardy Decl.  ¶ 50.  The withheld information includes, \nfor example, detailed information about investigation of individuals other than Page, undisclosed \nmethods used to gather information about Page, detailed undisclosed information about a \nsource’s activities, and information about the specific amounts and timeframes for payments to \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 39 of 64\nhuman sources.   Id. ¶¶ 56-59.  Additionally, the FBI redacted information that would reveal the \nexact timeframes of authorized surveillance and descriptions of exactly what was authorized, \nincluding minimization procedures.  Id. ¶¶ 51-53.  None of that information has been previously \ndisclosed and all of it would be valuable to adversaries seeking to analyze, undermine, and evade \nour counterintelligence apparatus.  This type of information reveals actual intelligence activities \nundertaken regarding specific targets during a specific timeframe, discloses intelligence-\ngathering capabilities of those methods, and provides an assessment of the level of FBI \npenetration of specific targets during a specific time frame.  Id. ¶ 58.  “Armed with such \ninformation, adversaries, including hostile foreign governments, could implement actions to \nthwart the FBI’s intelligence activities and weaken or negate the particular intelligence methods, \nwhich would severely disrupt the FBI’s intelligence-gathering capabilities.”  Id.  \nSecond, DOJ has redacted information that tends to identify particular intelligence \nsources.  As explained in the Third Hardy Declaration, “an intelligence source who requires \ncontinued classification is one that provided or is currently providing information that pertains to \nnational security matters, the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to result in \nserious damage to FBI’s intelligence-gathering capabilities.”  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 60.  Although the \nidentity of one source has been disclosed, the Page applications include identifying information \nfor other sources as well.  Id. ¶¶ 61-63.  Disclosure of intelligence sources “could reasonably be \nexpected to jeopardize their livelihoods, their families and other relationships, and even their \nlives” and disclosure of one source can cause other current and potential sources to fear \ndisclosure.  Id. ¶¶ 62-63.  Thus, disclosure of source-identifying information could reasonably be \nexpected to damage national security by endangering current and past sources and by \ndiscouraging current and potential sources from reporting.  Id.  Accordingly, such information is \nproperly redacted pursuant to Exemption 1. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 40 of 64\n(3) DOJ Properly Redacted Information Pertaining to Foreign Relations. \nThe Hardy Declaration establishes that DOJ also redacted certain information pertaining \nto foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, and that disclosure of this \ninformation would cause harm to national security.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 64-67.  Although Mr. \nHardy explains that further details cannot be provided on the public record, the redacted \ninformation relates to the United States’ interactions with foreign countries.  Id.  If disclosed, \nsuch information “can reasonably be expected to lead to diplomatic or economic retaliation, the \nloss of cooperation, or the compromise of cooperative foreign sources.”  Id.   The disclosure of \nspecific relationships could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to national security.  \nId.  Accordingly, such information is properly redacted pursuant to Exemption 1. 7 \nC.  DOJ Properly Withheld Information in the Carter Page Documents Pursuant to \nExemption 3, Including Information Protected By the National Security Act. \n \nExemption 3 exempts from disclosure records that are “specifically exempted from \ndisclosure by [another] statute” if the relevant statute “requires that the matters be withheld from \nthe public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue” or “establishes particular \ncriteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.”  5 U.S.C. § \n552(b)(3)(A).  The Government’s mandate to withhold information under FOIA Exemption 3 is \nbroader than its authority under FOIA Exemption 1, as it does not have to demonstrate that the \ndisclosure will harm national security.  See Sims, 471 U.S. at 167; Gardels, 689 F.2d at 1106–07. \nInstead, “the sole issue for decision is the existence of a relevant statute and the inclusion of \nwithheld material within the statute’s coverage.  It is particularly important to protect intelligence \nsources and methods from public disclosure.”  Morley v. CIA, 508 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. \n                                                           \n7 The classified Hardy Declaration provides additional information about the redaction of \nclassified information and the harm to national security that would result from disclosure. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 41 of 64\n2007).  In analyzing the propriety of a withholding made pursuant to FOIA Exemption 3, the \nCourt need not examine “the detailed factual contents of specific documents[.]” Id. \nDOJ has invoked Section 102A(i)(1) of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended \n(now codified at 50 U.S.C. § 3024(i)(1)), which requires the Director of National Intelligence to \n“protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.”  It is well-established \nthat Section 102A qualifies as a withholding statute for the purposes of FOIA Exemption 3.  See, \ne.g., ACLU v. Dep’t of Defense, 628 F.3d at 619.   In fact, the Supreme Court has recognized the \n“wide-ranging authority” provided by the National Security Act to protect intelligence sources \nand methods.  See Sims, 471 U.S. at 169–70, 177, 180; see Halperin v. CIA, 629 F.2d 144, 147 \n(D.C. Cir. 1980) (explaining that the only question for the court is whether the agency has shown \nthat responding to a FOIA request “could reasonably be expected to lead to unauthorized \ndisclosure of intelligence sources and methods”).  The Act has been properly invoked to \nwithhold information about FISA and other surveillance techniques.  See, e.g., Agility Pub. \nWarehousing Co. K.S.C. v. NSA, 113 F. Supp. 3d 313, 329 (D.D.C. 2015). \nAs explained above, information redacted from the Page FISA applications and orders \nincludes information that would disclose intelligence sources and methods.   See Part II.B.2, \nsupra.  Accordingly, DOJ properly concluded that it is also prohibited from disclosing such \ninformation under the National Security Act.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 68-72.   \nDOJ also redacted information pursuant to another Exemption 3 statute, which cannot be \npublicly identified without revealing the very information to be protected.  Id. ¶ 73.  The Court is \nreferred to the ex parte, in camera declaration for additional explanation. \n \n \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 42 of 64\nD.  DOJ Properly Withheld Information in the Carter Page Documents Pursuant to \nExemption 7(A). \n \n(1) Exemption 7 Threshold.  \nExemption 7 protects from disclosure all “records or information compiled for law \nenforcement purposes” that could reasonably be expected to cause one of the six harms outlined \nin the Exemption’s subparts. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7). “To fall within any of the exemptions under \nthe umbrella of Exemption 7, a record must have been ‘compiled for law enforcement \npurposes.’” Pub. Emps. for Envtl. Responsibility v. U.S. Section, Int’l Boundary & Water \nComm’n, U.S.-Mexico, 740 F.3d 195, 202 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)).  \nHere, DOJ records regarding FISA applications and orders are compiled in part for law \nenforcement purposes.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 74-79. \n(2) Exemption 7(A) Standards. \nExemption 7(A) “exempts from FOIA disclosure records or information compiled for \n‘law enforcement purposes . . . to the extent that the production . . . could reasonably be expected \nto interfere with enforcement proceedings.’” Shannahan v. IRS., 672 F.3d 1142, 1145 (9th Cir. \n2012) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A)).  “Exemption 7(A) reflects the Congress’s recognition \nthat ‘law enforcement agencies ha[ve] legitimate needs to keep certain records confidential, lest \nthe agencies be hindered in their investigations or placed at a disadvantage when it [comes] time \nto present their case.’” Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. DOJ, 746 F.3d 1082, \n1096 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (hereinafter “CREW”) (quoting NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 \nU.S. 214, 224 (1978)). \nAn ongoing investigation typically triggers Exemption 7(A).  See CREW, 746 F.3d at \n1098 (quoting Juarez v. DOJ, 518 F.3d 54, 59 (D.C. Cir. 2008)).  “In the typical case,” therefore, \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 43 of 64\n“the requested records relate to a specific individual or entity that is the subject of the ongoing \ninvestigation, making the likelihood of interference readily apparent.”  Id. \n(3) Disclosure of the Withheld Information Could Reasonably Be Expected to \nInterfere with the Russia Investigation. \n \nHere, the FBI sought and received authority under FISA to surveil Carter Page as part of \nand in furtherance of a pending proceeding – the ongoing Russian interference investigation.  See \n3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 82-83.  The redacted information reflects details relevant to the ongoing \ninvestigation, “making the likelihood of interference readily apparent.”  See CREW, 746 F.3d at \n1098. \nThe Third Hardy Declaration explains that disclosure of redacted information in the \nCarter Page FISA documents “could reasonably be expected to interfere with the pending \nRussian election interference investigation if publicly disclosed at this time.”  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ \n83.  The Third Hardy Declaration explains that the types of information that could reasonably be \nexpected to harm the investigation if disclosed include:  aspects of the investigation not \npreviously made public, what information or activities are or are not of interest to the \ninvestigators, areas in which there may be gaps in investigators’ knowledge that could be \nexploited, and the identities of potential witnesses and the information they provided.  Hardy \nDecl. ¶ 85.  Moreover, disclosure of confidential or classified sources risks curtailing their \ncooperation.  Id. ¶ 87.  Disclosure of the evidence relied upon risks influencing, compromising or \ntainting these or other witnesses, and risks revealing gaps in investigative information that can be \nexploited.  Id. ¶ 88.  Disclosure of specific investigative techniques used during specific time \nperiods and regarding specific subject matters creates similar risks, including efforts by \nadversaries or targets to undermine the techniques.  Id. ¶ 89.   \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 44 of 64\nThe FBI carefully considered whether information would match public information and \nwhether its disclosure would reasonably be expected to harm the investigation.  Id. ¶ 90.  \nAdditionally, although there has been widespread media coverage of the Russia investigation, \nofficial disclosures would cause greater harm to the investigation, regardless of whether it \nconfirmed or refuted media reporting.  Id. ¶ 84.  Accordingly, such information is properly \nwithheld pursuant to Exemption 7(A). \nE.  DOJ Properly Withheld Information in the Carter Page Documents Pursuant to \nExemption 7(D). \n \nDOJ properly withheld information under Exemption 7(D) because certain investigatory \ninformation would reveal the identity or information of confidential sources. \n(1) 7(D) Standards. \nExemption 7(D) permits the withholding or redacting of law enforcement records, the \nrelease of which “could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source . . \n. and, . . . [in the case of] an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence \ninvestigation, information furnished by a confidential source.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(D).  \nExemption 7(D) requires no balancing of public and private interests.  See Dow Jones & Co. v. \nDOJ, 917 F.2d 571, 575–76 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  The agency is entitled to withhold any \ninformation that could disclose a confidential source’s identity and, in the context of an agency \nconducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, to withhold the substance of the \ninformation furnished by such source.  See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(D); Dep’t of Justice v. Landano, \n508 U.S. 165, 172 (1993); Canning v. DOJ, 567 F. Supp. 2d 104, 111 (D.D.C. 2008). \nA confidential source is one who “provided information under an express assurance of \nconfidentiality or in circumstances from which such an assurance could be reasonably inferred.” \nLandano, 508 U.S. at 172.  Thus, Exemption 7(D) applies to protect the identity of a source if an \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 45 of 64\nagency establishes that a source has provided information under either an express or implied \npromise of confidentiality.  See Williams v. FBI, 69 F.3d 1155, 1159 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  In cases, \nsuch as this one, where the Government provides an express promise of confidentiality, “the \nissue is simple enough: The agency must present ‘probative evidence that the source . . . \nreceive[d] an express grant of confidentiality.’” Hodge v. FBI, 703 F.3d 575, 581 (D.C. Cir. \n2013) (quoting Campbell v. DOJ, 164 F.3d 20, 34 (D.C. Cir. 1998). \n(2) DOJ Properly Withheld Information Regarding Confidential Sources. \nHere, the FBI redacted certain non-public information regarding Christopher Steele \n(identified as “Source #1” in the documents), and all information about and from other \nconfidential human sources.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 112-17.  First, the Hardy Declaration establishes \nthat the FBI provided an express promise of confidentiality to Steele as part of the FBI’s \nprotocols for confidential human sources, and Steele in fact provided information in furtherance \nof a national security investigation.  Id. ¶¶ 115-16.  His information is therefore categorically \nexempt from disclosure under 7(D).  Nonetheless, Steele’s identity and some of his reporting has \nbeen publicly disclosed, and the FBI therefore has not redacted information that matches his \ninformation as disclosed in the Nunes and Schiff memoranda.  Id.  \nSecond, the FISA applications contain information from and about other sources who \nprovided information to the FBI and did so pursuant to express assurances of confidentiality.  Id. \n¶ 117.  Thus, the requirements of Exemption 7(D) are satisfied.  Confidential human sources \nproviding information to the FBI pursuant to assurances of confidentiality should be secure in the \nknowledge that their assistance will be held in confidence.  Id. ¶¶ 113-14.  Release of such \ninformation may eliminate a source and have a chilling effect on other current and potential \nsources, who need to know they can trust the FBI’s assurances of confidentiality.  Id.  \nAccordingly, the FBI properly redacted information pursuant to Exemption 7(D). \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 46 of 64\nF.  DOJ Properly Withheld Information in the Carter Page Documents Pursuant to \nExemption 7(E). \n \n(1) 7(E) Standards. \nExemption 7(E) authorizes withholding of information compiled for law enforcement \npurposes if release of the information “would disclose techniques and procedures for law \nenforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement \ninvestigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk \ncircumvention of the law.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E).  Congress intended that Exemption 7(E) \nprotect law enforcement techniques and procedures from disclosure, as well as techniques and \nprocedures used in all manner of investigations after crimes or other incidents have occurred. \nExemption 7(E) is written in broad and general terms to cover not only information that \nwill definitively lead to the circumvention of the law, but also information that risks \ncircumvention of the law.  Mayer Brown, LLP v. Internal Revenue Serv., 562 F.3d 1190, 1193 \n(D.C. Cir. 2009); Bigwood v. Dep’t of Defense, 132 F. Supp. 3d 124, 152–53 (D.D.C. 2015).  \nSatisfying the exemption is a “relatively low bar”.  See Blackwell v. FBI, 646 F.3d 37, 42 (D.C. \nCir. 2011).  The agency need not make a “highly specific ... showing” of risk of circumvention of \nthe law, but only “demonstrate logically how the release of the requested information might \ncreate” such a risk.  Id. (quoting Mayer Brown, 562 F.3d at 1194).  Nor must the agency \ndemonstrate “an actual or certain risk of circumvention” of the law; rather the agency need only \nshow “the chance of a reasonably expected risk.”  Mayer Brown, 562 F.3d at 1193. \nImportantly, the range of “law enforcement purposes” covered by Exemption 7(E) \nincludes not only traditional criminal law enforcement duties, but also proactive steps taken by \nthe government designed to prevent terrorism and to maintain national security.  See Ctr. for \nNat’l Sec. Studies, 331 F.3d at 926; Bigwood, 132 F. Supp. 3d at 152; see also Milner v. Dep’t of \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 47 of 64\nthe Navy, 562 U.S. 562, 582 (2011) (“Particularly in recent years, terrorism prevention and \nnational security measures have been recognized as vital to effective law enforcement efforts in \nour Nation.”) (Alito, J., concurring).  \n(2) DOJ Properly Withheld Information About Law Enforcement Techniques that \nRisks Circumvention of the Law. \n \nThe withholdings easily satisfy the “relatively low” Exemption 7(E) standard here.  The \nentirety of the FISA packages are a law enforcement technique, whose details were not \npreviously known to the public, and such FISA applications have never previously been \nprocessed for public release.  Accordingly, the applications and orders contain a substantial \namount of still nonpublic information about this law enforcement technique and how it is used in \nparticular contexts.  The Third Hardy Declaration describes eight categories of information \nwithheld under 7(E).8  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 119-33. \nFirst, DOJ withheld information about the investigative focus of these particular FISA \napplications and orders.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 120.  Together, the information in these applications \nreveals how the FBI conducted certain aspects of the investigation to that date and a road-map of \ncertain contemplated investigative steps.  Id.  Although the general techniques authorized by the \nFISA are publicly known, this detailed information about how, when, where and why such \nauthorities are employed in this particular investigation is not publicly known.  Id.  Such details \nwould be useful to criminals and other adversaries as a guide to adjust their own behavior and \ndevelop effective countermeasures.  Id.  \nSecond, DOJ withheld information about the collection and analysis of information it \n                                                           \n8 Each category is separately coded on the redacted documents.  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 34.  These \ncategories often overlap, and redactions may be coded to more than one category.  For example, \nspecific techniques described to the Court are protected under category three, but also tend to \nshow the focus of the investigation under category one based on which investigative activities \nwere ongoing when and where. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 48 of 64\nobtains for investigative purposes, including how and where the FBI collects particular types of \ninformation and the methodologies employed to analyze it.   Id. ¶¶ 121-23. Such disclosures \nwould enable subjects of investigations to identify when these or similar techniques are or might \nbe used and take countermeasures.  Id.  \nThird, DOJ withheld specific techniques authorized for and used in national security \ninvestigations.  Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 124-26.  This category includes:  techniques that have not been \npublicly disclosed in this specific context, details about other techniques that have been disclosed \ngenerally, and those techniques specifically considered or authorized by the FISC here.  Id. ¶ \n124.  The disclosure of techniques in this particular context would have important ramifications \non the use of such techniques in other national security cases.  Id.  Although the techniques \nauthorized by FISA are publicly known, detailed information about how, when, where and why \nsuch authorities are employed in a particular investigation is not publicly known.   Id.  \nAggregated, such information provides a roadmap to counterintelligence investigations and \nwould give sophisticated adversaries the information necessary to take countermeasures.  Id.  \nFourth, DOJ redacted specific databases used by the FBI for investigative purposes.  It is \nnot publicly known under what circumstances the FBI utilizes these particular databases, \nparticularly in the context of a national security investigation.  Id. ¶ 127.  And their disclosure \nwould provide another useful data point useful to spies, criminals and others intent on avoiding \nFBI attention and developing countermeasures.  Id.  \nFifth, DOJ withheld specific information about payments to confidential human sources.  \nWhile it is publicly known that FBI pays such sources, the details of when, for what, and how \nmuch sources are paid are aspects of this technique that are not made public in order to protect \nthe viability of this technique.   Id. ¶ 128.  Moreover, the amount paid to a particular confidential \nhuman source could suggest the relative volume or importance of information provided by a \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 49 of 64\nsource, leading people who believe they are subjects of such source reporting to assess the \nlikelihood that their activities have come to the FBI’s attention.  Id. ¶¶ 128-29.  And it could \nreveal important non-public information about the level of resources devoted to particular \ninvestigations or subjects.  Id.  \nSixth, DOJ withheld detailed information about the targets, dates and scope of \nsurveillance.  While it is known that the FBI conducts FISA surveillance and specifically \nconducted surveillance directed at Page, the details about how such surveillance was \ninvestigatively or technically implemented, the locations targeted by the surveillance, and the \nspecific time periods under which the surveillance was conducted are not public.  Id. ¶ 130.  \nDisclosure of such details about how and when the FBI conducts surveillance would create a \nmosaic that criminals and other adversaries could use to predict when and where such \nsurveillance may occur, detect it, and to develop and utilize countermeasures.  Id.  \nSeventh, DOJ redacted information regarding dates and types of FBI investigations.  In \nparticular, the FBI protected information that identifies the type of a particular investigation, \nwhether it is a “preliminary” or “full” investigation, and the time period of the particular \ninvestigation.  Id. ¶ 131.  Disclosure would allow individuals to know what types of activities \nwould trigger which type of investigation and allow them to deduce applicable time periods.  Id. \nDisclosure that a particular activity warrants investigation could cause individuals to adjust \nconduct to avoid detection.  Id.  \nEighth, DOJ redacted investigative strategies for particular evidence.  The FBI redacted \ninformation that describes a specific purpose for which it might use information gathered as a \nresult of its FISA authorized surveillance of Page.  Id. ¶¶ 132-33.  Publicly disclosing this \ninformation would permit targets of FBI investigative activities to anticipate such activities and \ntake effective countermeasures.  Id.  \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 50 of 64\nG. DOJ Properly Withheld Private Information in the Carter Page Documents \nPursuant to Exemptions 6 and/or 7(C). \n \n(1) Applicable Exemptions. \nTwo FOIA exemptions cover different types of private information redacted in these \ndocuments.  First, Exemption 6 allows agencies to withhold “personnel and medical files and \nsimilar files” whenever “disclosure . . . would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of \npersonal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6).  To determine whether a file qualifies as “similar” to \n“personnel or medical files,” courts examine whether information in that file “applies to a \nparticular individual.”  Dep’t of State v. Wash. Post Co., 456 U.S. 595, 601-02 (1982).  \nTherefore, not only does the exemption protect files, “but also bits of personal information, such \nas names and addresses, the release of which would create a palpable threat to privacy.”  Prison \nLegal News v. Samuels, 787 F.3d 1142, 1147 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citation omitted).  If the threshold \nrequirement is met, a court must next ask whether disclosure would compromise a “substantial” \nprivacy interest, since FOIA requires the release of information “[i]f no significant privacy \ninterest is implicated . . . .”  Multi Ag Media LLC v. Dep’t of Agric., 515 F.3d 1224, 1229 (D.C. \nCir. 2008) (citation omitted).  “Anything greater than a de minimis privacy interest” is generally \nsufficient.  Id. at 1229–30.  Finally, courts test whether release of such information would \nconstitute a “clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,” Wash. Post Co. v. Dep’t of \nHealth & Human Servs., 690 F.2d 252, 260 (D.C. Cir. 1982), by balancing “the privacy interest \nthat would be compromised by disclosure against any public interest in the requested \ninformation,” Multi Ag Media, 515 F.3d at 1228.  Courts examine the “public need for the \ninformation” in light of “the basic purpose of [FOIA] to open agency action to the light of public \nscrutiny, rather than . . . the particular purpose for which the document is being requested.” DOJ \nv. Reporters Comm. For Freedom of Press, 489 U.S. 749, 772 (1989) (internal citations omitted). \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 51 of 64\n“That purpose . . . is not fostered by disclosure of information about private citizens that is \naccumulated in various governmental files but that reveals little or nothing about an agency’s \nown conduct.”  Id. at 773. \nSecond, under Exemption 7(C), an agency is exempt from producing “records or \ninformation compiled for law enforcement purposes . . . to the extent that the production of such \nlaw enforcement records or information . . . could reasonably be expected to constitute an \nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C).  In determining whether \nthis exemption applies to particular information, a court must balance the privacy interests of \nindividuals mentioned in the records against the public interest in disclosure.  See ACLU v. DOJ, \n655 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  The privacy interest at stake belongs to the individual, not the \ngovernment agency, see Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 763–65, and “individuals have a strong \ninterest in not being associated unwarrantedly with alleged criminal activity,” Stern v. FBI, 737 \nF.2d 84, 91–92 (D.C. Cir. 1984). \n(2) DOJ Properly Withheld Private Information. \nHere, the Third Hardy Declaration establishes that several categories of private or \npersonally identifying information are properly redacted.  First, DOJ withheld the names of the \nFBI agents who signed the Page FISA applications under Exemption 6 and 7(C).  Such agents \ncan become the target of harassing inquiries or threats, a risk that is heightened in the context of \nnational security or counterintelligence cases.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 96-101.  They have substantial \nprivacy interests in avoiding such harassment or threats, an interest that is heightened by the high \nprofile nature of the investigation.  Id.  Finally, there is no legitimate public interest in these \nidentities, which would not inform the public understanding of the Page warrants, the Russia \ninvestigation or anything else.  Id.  Accordingly, the FBI properly protected these names. \nSecond, DOJ withheld certain personal information about Carter Page.  While FISC-\n29 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 52 of 64\nauthorized surveillance of Carter Page has been officially acknowledged, there remains \ninformation not previously made public by the Government and in which he retains a privacy \ninterest.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 102-05.  Although there is a demonstrated public interest in these \napplications, the particular information redacted would not substantially increase the public’s \nunderstanding of this matter.  Id.  \nThird, DOJ withheld identifying information about a FISC deputy clerk and the career \nNSD attorney who submitted the FISA applications to the FISC.  Id. ¶¶ 106-109.  Such \nemployees could become targets of harassing inquiries or threats, and they may be targeted by \nforeign powers; in contrast, there is no public interest in their identities.  Id.  Accordingly, their \nidentifying information was properly redacted. \nFinally, DOJ redacted identifying information regarding a third party source.  This \nparticular source is mentioned twice in the released documents and did not provide information \ndirectly to the FBI.  Id. ¶¶ 110-11.  The individual has a substantial privacy interest in not being \npublicly linked to the investigation and could face harassment, retaliation, threats or physical \nharm if revealed publicly in connection with a sensitive national security investigation.  Id.  And \nthe public interest in an individual mentioned in two footnotes is quite limited and would not \nincrease the public’s understanding of FBI operations or this investigation.  Id.  Accordingly, this \ninformation was properly redacted.  \nH. DOJ Properly Withheld in Full Certain Portions of the Carter Page Documents \nPursuant to Exemptions 1, 3, 7(A), and 7(E). \n \nDOJ withheld 186 pages in full from the Carter Page FISA packages.  Disclosure would \nreveal classified intelligence methods and law enforcement techniques.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 135-\n41.  There is no additional information that can be provided on the public record but the \njustification for withholding is similar to the justification for other redactions under these \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 53 of 64\nexemptions.  The classified ex parte, in camera submission provides additional information. \nI.  DOJ Released All Reasonably Segregable Information. \nUnder FOIA, “any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any \nperson requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt . . . .” 5 U.S.C. § \n552(b).  Accordingly, “non-exempt portions of a document must be disclosed unless they are \ninextricably intertwined with exempt portions.” Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. Dep’t of Air Force, 566 \nF.2d 242, 260 (D.C. Cir. 1977).  An agency has no obligation to segregate non-exempt material \nthat is so “inextricably intertwined” with exempt material that “the excision of exempt \ninformation would impose significant costs on the agency and produce an edited document with \nlittle informational value.”  Neufeld v. IRS, 646 F.2d 661, 666 (D.C. Cir. 1981), abrogated on \nother grounds by Church of Scientology of Calif. v. IRS, 792 F.2d 153 (D.C. Cir. 1986); see also \nNat’l Sec. Archive Fund, Inc. v. CIA, 402 F. Supp. 2d 211, 220–21 (D.D.C. 2005) (same).  A \ncourt “may rely on government affidavits that show with reasonable specificity why documents \nwithheld pursuant to a valid exemption cannot be further segregated . . . .”  Juarez, 518 F.3d at \n61 (internal citation omitted).  “Agencies are entitled to a presumption that they complied with \nthe obligation to disclose reasonably segregable material.” Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 494 \nF.3d 1106, 1117 (D.C. Cir. 2007). \nHere, DOJ has shown that it released all reasonably segregable material through the \ndeclaration of Mr. Hardy.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 134.  Mr. Hardy indicates that the agency conducted \na document-by-document and line-by-line review to ensure that all reasonably segregable, non-\nexempt information was released, taking into account the public disclosures related to this \nmatter.  Id.  See Johnson v. Exec. Office for U.S. Attorneys, 310 F.3d 771, 776-77 (D.C. Cir. \n2002) (holding that agency had demonstrated there was no reasonably segregable non-\ndeliberative material when it had submitted an affidavit by an agency official confirming that “a \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 54 of 64\nline-by-line review of each document withheld in full [had] determined that ‘no documents \ncontained releasable information which could be reasonably segregated from the nonreleasable \nportions.’”).  This segregability conclusion is borne out by the released documents: redactions \nhave been taken narrowly and only where specific information protected by exemptions is at \nissue. \nBecause the Hardy Declaration establishes that all reasonably segregable, non-exempt \ninformation has been released, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment. \nIII.  DOJ Properly Refused to Confirm or Deny the Existence of Other Responsive \nRecords. \n \nDOJ has refused to confirm or deny the existence of FISA applications and orders beyond \nthe four previously acknowledged Carter Page packages.  DOJ has established that this partial \nGlomar response is proper, pursuant to Exemptions 1, 3, 7(A) and 7(E).  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 142-\n46; Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 14-15. \nThe standards for these exemptions are outlined in Part II of this memorandum, and the \napplication of FOIA standards to refuse to confirm or deny the use of particular surveillance \ntechniques against particular individuals ought to be non-controversial.  The Government \nroutinely makes Glomar responses to similar requests for information about particular \nsurveillance subjects, see 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 13, 143 (confirming that with extremely limited \nexceptions, the FBI does not confirm or deny FISA surveillance of particular individuals or \nentities); Findlay Decl. ¶ 16 (same), and courts routinely uphold such responses.  See, e.g., \nMarrera v. DOJ, 622 F. Supp. 51, 53–54 (D.D.C. 1985) (“[T]his Court finds that OIPR’s refusal \nto confirm or deny the existence of FISA records pertaining to this particular plaintiff to be \njustified in the interests of national security as part of an overall policy of [the Executive Order] \nwith respect to all FISA FOIA requests.”); Schwarz v. Dep’t of Treasury, 131 F. Supp. 2d 142, \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 55 of 64\n149 (D.D.C. 2000) (“The Office properly refused to confirm or deny that it had any responsive \nrecords maintained under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) and in non-\nFISA files relating to various intelligence techniques.”), aff’d, No. 00-5453, 2001 WL 674636 \n(D.C. Cir. May 10, 2001); Competitive Enter. Inst. v. NSA, 78 F. Supp. 3d 45, 60 (D.D.C. 2015) \n(upholding NSA Glomar response to request for metadata records with respect to two particular \nindividuals); Agility Pub. Warehousing Co. K.S.C., 113 F. Supp. 3d at 329 (upholding NSA \nGlomar in response to request for particular surveillance records); see also Carter v. NSA, No. \n1:12-CV-00968-CKK, 2014 WL 2178708, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 23, 2014) (upholding Glomar \nresponse to request for records related to alleged NSA surveillance of plaintiff); Moore v. \nObama, No. 09-5072, 2009 WL 2762827, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 24, 2009) (same); Wilner, 592 \nF.3d at 65 (“Glomar responses are available, when appropriate, to agencies when responding to \nFOIA requests for information obtained under a ‘publicly acknowledged’ intelligence program, \nsuch as the [Terrorist Surveillance Program], at least when the existence of such information has \nnot already been publicly disclosed.”). \nA.  The Partial Glomar is Proper Pursuant to Exemption One Because the \nExistence or Non-Existence of Responsive Records is Properly Classified. \n \nThe Glomar response with respect to the existence or non-existence of other FISA \nsurveillance applications is proper under FOIA Exemption 1.  DOJ has logically and plausibly \nexplained why it cannot confirm or deny the existence of additional responsive records that \nwould identify other FISA targets, if any, without revealing information that is currently and \nproperly classified and exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 1.  First, the existence or \nnon-existence of additional responsive records “pertains to” one of the categories of information \nprotected by Executive Order 13526, namely, “intelligence sources and methods” and “foreign \nrelations and foreign activities of the United States.”  And the disclosure of either category \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 56 of 64\nwould cause harm to national security. \nThe existence or non-existence of responsive records pertains to intelligence sources and \nmethods because the request, on its face, seeks information about whether there has been \nadditional FISA surveillance, beyond that already acknowledged.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 152-55; \nFindlay Decl. ¶¶ 16-19.  Confirming or denying whether other responsive records exist “would \nbe tantamount to confirming whether or not the FBI has relied on a particular intelligence \nactivity or method targeted at particular individuals or organizations” and “reveal otherwise non-\npublic information regarding the nature of the FBI’s intelligence interests, priorities, activities \nand methods– information that is highly desired by hostile actors who seek to thwart the FBI’s \nintelligence-gathering mission.”  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 155; Findlay Decl. ¶ 17 (“To disclose the \nexistence or non-existence of responsive documents in NSD files would disclose whether or not \nparticular individuals or organizations were targets of FISC-authorized surveillance.”).   Such \nactivities and methods “are valuable only so long as they remain unknown and unsuspected” and \nthat disclosure would “seriously jeopardize[]” the use of such methods.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 153-\n54; Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 20-21.   Mr. Hardy further explains that hostile groups review officially \nreleased information like this; they have “the ability to gather information from myriad sources, \nanalyze it, and deduce means and methods from disparate details to defeat the U.S. \nGovernment’s collection efforts.”  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 154; Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 20-21.   Disclosure of \nthe withheld information “would pose at least a serious risk to national security.” 3rd Hardy Decl. \n¶ 155; Findlay Decl. ¶ 20.   \nFurther, the Hardy Declaration establishes that confirming the existence or non-existence \nof other responsive documents would reveal information about the United States Government’s \nforeign relations, the disclosure of which could cause damage to national security.  3rd Hardy \nDecl. ¶¶ 156-60.   Such disclosure could “weaken, or even sever, the relationship between the \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 57 of 64\nUnited States and its foreign partners (present and future), thus degrading the Government’s \nability to combat hostile threats abroad.”  Id. 9 \nAccordingly, the partial Glomar response was proper under Exemption One. \nB.  The FBI Established that the Partial Glomar is Proper Pursuant to \nExemption 3 and the National Security Act.  \n \nAs discussed in Part II, Exemption 3 and the National Security Act prohibit the disclosure \nof intelligence sources and methods.  For the reasons discussed above with regard to Exemption \n1, confirming the existence or non-existence of responsive records could divulge information \nabout the existence or nonexistence of intelligence sources and methods protected from \ndisclosure under the National Security Act.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 161-63.  No additional showing is \nnecessary under the National Security Act. \nC.  The FBI Established that the Partial Glomar is Proper Pursuant to \nExemption 7(A). \n \nHere, the Hardy Declaration justifies the FBI’s use of Exemption 7(A) to protect the \ncurrently undisclosed fact of the existence or non-existence of any investigative records that \nwould be responsive to Plaintiffs’ requests.  As an initial matter, FISA records are plainly \ncompiled for law enforcement purposes.  As the Hardy Declaration establishes, the “only \ncircumstance under which the FBI can request a FISA order is when the FBI is conducting an \nauthorized, predicated national security investigation within the scope of its law enforcement and \nforeign intelligence responsibilities.”  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 77.   Accordingly, FISA applications and \nFISC orders – when they exist – are records compiled for law enforcement purposes. \n                                                           \n9 The Government is not arguing that such disclosure of the existence or nonexistence of records \nwould reveal the existence of the Russia investigation.  The existence of the Russia investigation \nis officially acknowledged information.  Additional information about the harm to foreign \nrelations that would result from disclosure is available in the ex parte, in camera declaration. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 58 of 64\nAdditionally, the information requested purportedly relates to an ongoing investigation.  \nPlaintiffs’ request explicitly mentions the investigation into the Russian government’s efforts to \ninterfere in the 2016 presidential election.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 14 (describing opening of \ninvestigation); 168 (describing ongoing investigation).  Any sort of investigation involving such \nFISA records would be the sort of active investigation protected by Exemption 7(A).  See, e.g., \nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. NIH, 745 F.3d 535, 541 (D.C. Cir. 2014) \n(Exemption 7’s threshold requirement satisfied in a Glomar response case because FOIA \nrequester did not dispute that “any responsive documents,” if they existed, “would constitute \nrecords or information compiled for law enforcement purposes . . .”). \nThe Hardy Declaration further describes the harm to an investigation that may result: \nConfirming or denying the existence or non-existence of \nresponsive records would reveal non-public information about the \nfocus, scope, and conduct of that investigation.  Specifically, it \nwould reveal whether or not specific investigative techniques have \nbeen used; when and to what extent they were used, if they were; \ntheir relative value or benefit if they were used; and the targets \nthey were used against, if any.  Prematurely disclosing nonpublic \ninformation about the Russia investigation could give targets and \nothers intent on interfering with the FBI’s investigative efforts the \ninformation necessary to:  take defensive actions to conceal \ncriminal activities; develop and implement countermeasures to \nelude detection; suppress, destroy, or fabricate evidence; and \nidentify potential witnesses or sources, exposing them to \nharassment, intimidation, coercion, and/or physical threats.  \nAccordingly, confirming or denying the existence or non-existence \nof responsive records, beyond the four Carter Page FISA \napplications . . . , could reasonably be expected to adversely affect \nthe pending investigation. \n \n3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 169.    \nAccordingly, a Glomar response is available under these circumstances to protect the \nintegrity of confidential law-enforcement investigations, and to therefore prevent harm \ncognizable by FOIA Exemption 7(A).  See, e.g., Cozen O’Connor v. Dep’t of Treasury, 570 F. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 59 of 64\nSupp. 2d 749, 788 (E.D. Pa. 2008); see also CREW, 746 F.3d at 1096 (“Exemption 7(A) reflects \nthe Congress’s recognition that ‘law enforcement agencies ha[ve] legitimate needs to keep \ncertain records confidential, lest the agencies be hindered in their investigations or placed at a \ndisadvantage when it [comes] time to present their case.’” (quoting Robbins Tire, 437 U.S. at \n224)).  For these reasons, the FBI’s Glomar response is justified by Exemption 7(A). \nD.  The FBI Established that the Partial Glomar Response is Proper Pursuant to \nExemption 7(E). \n \nAs discussed in Part II, Exemption 7(E) protects law enforcement techniques and \nprocedures, where disclosure risks circumvention of the law.  Here, the Third Hardy Declaration \nestablishes that disclosure of existence or non-existence of responsive records would reveal a law \nenforcement technique or procedure.  “How the FBI applies its investigative resources (or not) \nagainst a particular allegation, report of criminal activity, or perceived threat is itself a law \nenforcement technique or procedure that the FBI protects.”  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 171.  Such an \nacknowledgment of the existence or non-existence of responsive records “would reveal when \nand under what circumstances the FBI relies upon FISA-authorized techniques in an \ninvestigation,” and “provide pieces of information that adversaries could use to ascertain at what \npoint, and against whom we might use particular techniques.”  Id. ¶ 172.  “Armed with this \ninformation, adversaries could glean significant insight into the activities likely to attract – or not \nattract – the FBI’s law enforcement attention.  These individuals would then be able to alter their \nbehavior to avoid attention by law enforcement, making it more difficult for the FBI to be \nproactive in assessing threats and investigating crimes.”  Id.  Accordingly, the FBI properly \ninvoked Exemption 7(E) to refuse to confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records, \nbeyond the Carter Page documents discussed in detail above. \n \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 60 of 64\nIV.  The Withheld Information Has Not Been Officially Acknowledged. \n \nAs a general matter, under FOIA, “when an agency has officially acknowledged \notherwise exempt information through prior disclosure, the agency has waived its right to claim \nan exemption with respect to that information.”  ACLU v. CIA, 710 F.3d 422, 426 (D.C. Cir. \n2013).  This “official acknowledgement” principle applies to the Glomar context, so a requester \n“can overcome a Glomar response by showing that the agency has already disclosed the fact of \nthe existence (or non-existence) of responsive records, since that is the purportedly exempt \ninformation that a Glomar response is designed to protect.”  Id. at 427.  But the plaintiff “must \nbear the initial burden of pointing to specific information in the public domain that appears to \nduplicate that being withheld.”  Id. (quoting Wolf, 473 F.3d at 378).   \nThe D.C. Circuit has narrowly construed the “official acknowledgment” doctrine, \nhowever, and to bring such a challenge plaintiff must satisfy three stringent criteria, none of \nwhich are satisfied here.  “First, the information requested must be as specific as the information \npreviously released.”  Wolf, 473 F.3d at 378 (quoting Fitzgibbon, 911 F.2d at 765); James \nMadison Project v. DOJ, No. CV 17-1392 (ABJ), 2018 WL 4283562, at *6 (D.D.C. Sept. 7, \n2018).  “Prior disclosure of similar information does not suffice; instead, the specific information \nsought by the plaintiff must already be in the public domain by official disclosure.  This \ninsistence on exactitude [by the D.C. Circuit] recognizes ‘the Government’s vital interest in \ninformation relating to national security and foreign affairs.”  Id. (quoting Pub. Citizen v. Dep’t \nof State, 11 F.3d 198, 203 (D.C. Cir. 1993)); Competitive Enter. Inst., 78 F. Supp. 3d at 54 \n(“Plaintiffs in this case must therefore point to specific information in the public domain \nestablishing that the NSA has [the claimed information.]”).  The information already released \nmust also be of the same level of generality as the information sought—broadly crafted \ndisclosures, even on the same general topic, do not waive the Glomar response.  See, e.g., Afshar, \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 61 of 64\n702 F.2d at 1133 (previous disclosure that plaintiff had “‘created a problem’ in U.S.-Iranian \nrelations” was too general to justify releasing documents detailing the nature of that problem). \n“Second, the information requested must match the information previously disclosed.”  \nWolf, 473 F.3d at 378 (quoting Fitzgibbon, 911 F.2d at 765).  If there are “substantive \ndifferences” between the two, an official-acknowledgment claim must fail.  ACLU v. DOD, 628 \nF.3d at 621.  That is true even if the previous disclosures are on the same topic.  See, e.g., \nCompetitive Enter. Inst., 78 F. Supp. 3d at 57 (a Presidential statement that “the intelligence \ncommunity . . . is looking at phone numbers and durations of calls,” was not adequately \ncongruent with a request seeking the companies that had provided that data to U.S. intelligence \nagencies); Wolf, 473 F.3d at 379 (holding that CIA could not claim Glomar protection when it \nhad previously read excerpts from materials sought into the record during congressional \nhearing); James Madison Project v. DOJ, 2018 WL 4283562, at *8-*16 (various Presidential \nstatements failed to meet matching and specificity requirements). \n“Third, . . . the information requested must already have been made public through an \nofficial and documented disclosure.”  Id. at 378 (quoting Fitzgibbon, 911 F.2d at 765).  Key to \nthis element is that the source must be official; non-governmental releases, or anonymous leaks \nby government officials or former government officials do not qualify.  See, e.g., ACLU v. Dep’t \nof Defense, 628 F.3d at 621-22; Agility Public Warehousing Co.  K.S.C., 113 F. Supp. 3d at 330 \nn.8; Competitive Enter. Inst., 78 F. Supp. 3d at 55.  In other words, “mere public speculation, no \nmatter how widespread,” cannot undermine the agency’s Glomar prerogative.  Wolf, 473 F.3d at \n378.  And Congressional statements also cannot waive Executive Branch classification or other \nExemptions.  See Military Audit Project, 656 F.2d at 742-745; see also Moore v. CIA, 666 F.3d \n1330, 1333 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“[W]e do not deem ‘official’ a disclosure made by someone \nother than the agency from which the information is being sought.”). \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 62 of 64\nPlaintiffs cannot meet their burden of pointing to an official disclosure of the information \nthey seek.  The declarations establish that no authorized government official has disclosed the \nprecise information withheld and that the declarants carefully considered the known public \ninformation related to this issue.  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 23-27, 31-32, 134, 143; Findlay Decl. ¶ \n23.   \nThe Amended Complaint cites a number of public statements that Plaintiffs allege \nconstitute official acknowledgement of properly classified facts.  See Am. Compl. ¶ 11 (“The \ncomments of President Trump and Press Secretary Sean Spicer constitute prior official disclosure \nof the existence of surveillance orders issued by the FISC and that authorized collection of \ninformation that, at a minimum, incidentally implicated President Trump and/or his associates. \nThis lawsuit ultimately will seek to determine the circumstances in which specific \nsurveillance/collection orders were issued by the FISC.”).  But these cited public statements \nabout an investigation and alleged surveillance do not come close to meeting the standard for \nofficial acknowledgement of the information sought by Plaintiffs. \nPlaintiffs appear to rely on President Trump’s four-part post on Twitter on March 4, \n2017, discussed supra.  See https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump; see also Am. Compl. ¶ 7; 3rd \nHardy Decl. ¶ 26; Findlay Decl. ¶ 8.  As discussed above, DOJ – through the testimony of then-\nFBI Director James Comey – has confirmed that it has no records that support this statement.  \nHardy Decl. ¶ 26; Findlay Decl. ¶ 8 & Ex. E.10 \n                                                           \n10 In any event, this series of tweets contains a constellation of specific opinions and allegations \nregarding wiretapping, including that (1) his phones were tapped; (2) at Trump Tower; (3) in \nOctober just prior to the election; (4) by the Obama Administration; and (5) that such actions \nwere comparable to “Nixon/Watergate.”  Nowhere do these tweets mention FISA, the FISC, any \ntargets other than President Trump, or the involvement of DOJ or FBI.  Moreover, the statements \nare limited to a particular time, a particular target, and a particular place, in contrast to Plaintiffs’ \nFOIA request.  Thus, the statements do not match the information sought in this FOIA request.  \nThe follow-up statements to the media by the President or his Press Secretary as cited in the \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 63 of 64\nNeither the Complaint nor the request point to any statements that could constitute \nofficial acknowledgment, and the agency has carefully considered the known public information \non this issue.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs cannot establish official acknowledgment. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant the Government’s motion for summary \njudgment. \nDated:  October 19, 2018        Respectfully Submitted, \n \nCHAD A.

Furthermore, as previouslynoted, the\nmaterials containinvestigative informationrelevantto the pendinginvestigationinto Russia's\ninterferenceinthe 2016 Presidential election.

As discussed further below, the FBI's original Glomarresponse was\npiercedonly in a very limited fashion for those four acknowledged applications and resulting\norders. It remains in placeas to any otherresponsive applications and orders, with one other\nexception. Specifically, on March 20, 2017, then FBI DirectorJames B.

Sucha\nsearchwas not necessary here. In this case, a known universe ofresponsive records was\nrevealed through the release ofthe Nunes and SchiffMemos. Specifically, the memoranda\nrevealed the existence offour FISA applications submitted for surveillance on CarterPage,\nstartingin October2016 and continuingthroughthree renewals, with accompanying FISA\norders. FBI FOIApersonnel consulted with FBI personnel familiar with the Russia\ninvestigationto locate the four Page FISApackages. Throughthese efforts, the FBI was able to\nlocate each ofthe four packages. At the same time, the FBI also contactedDOJ'sNational\nSecurityDivision(\"NSD\"), which represents the Governmentbefore the FISC, to obtaincopies\nofall four applicationsthatNSD had submittedto the FISC and all accompanying orders on the\napplications. NSD providedthe FBI copies ofall four packages for processing. The FBI then\nconfirmedthatbetweenits records and the NSD records, it had complete copies ofeachofthe\nfour FISA packages on CarterPage thathad been revealed by the Nunes and SchiffMemos.\n(29) (U) Withregard to Item 2 ofplaintiffs' request, the FBI interpreted this to include\nthe four final applications actuallysubmitted to the FISC seeking authorizationfor surveillance\nofCarterPage, whichresulted inordersfrom the FISC authorizing surveillance. The FBI did not\ninterpretItem2to includeallversionsordraftsofthoseapplications,asplaintiffsdidnot\nspecificallyreference other versions or drafts.\n11\nSECRET//NQFORN\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 12 of 66\nSECRET//NOFORN\n(30) (tJ) WithregardtoItem3ofplaintiffs'request, aseparate searchwasnot\nrequired because the minimizationprocedures that DOJ proposedand that the FISC orderedwith\nregard to the Page surveillanceare included withinthe four applications and resulting FISC\norders.\n(U) FOIAExemptions\n(31) (U) The FBI carefullyreviewed, processed, releasedto plaintiff(and others), and\nposted to The Vault all non-exemptportions ofthe four Page FISApackages (applications and\norders) thatwere revealedintheNunes Memo.^° InconjunctionwithDOJ, theFBIconducted a\nthorough reviewofeach page and redacted informationor withheld pages in full pursuantto\nFOIAExemptions (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(6), (b)(7)(A), (b)(7)(C), (b)(7)(D), and (b)(7)(E).\n(32) (U) Every effortwas made to provide plaintiffwith allmaterial in thepublic\ndomain and with all reasonably segregable portions ofnon-exemptmaterial.

This contextincludes not only the surrounding unclassified information,\nbut also other informationalready in the publicdomain, as well as informationlikelyknown or\nsuspected by other hostile intelligence entities. It is myjudgmentthat any greaterspecificityin\nthe descriptions andjustifications set forth withrespectto informationrelating to intelligence\nactivities, sources, and methods and foreign relations/activities ofthe United Statescould\nreasonably be expected to harm interests that FOIAexemptions wete designed to protect.\n(U) E.0.13526§ 1.4(c)- IntelligenceActivities, SourcesandMethods\n(U) Overview\n(46) (U) E.G. 13526 § 1.4(c)authorizes the classification of\"intelligence activities\n(includingcovert action), intelligence sources ormethods, or cryptology.\" An intelligence\nactivity, source, or method includes any intelligence actionor technique utilizedbythe FBI\nagainstatargetedindividualororganizationthathasbeendeterminedtobe ofnationalsecurity\ninterest, andincludes anyprocedure (human ornon-human) utilized to obtain information\nconcerningsuch individual or organization.

First,the intelligence activity, source, ormethod, andinformation generatedby\nit, isneededby United States Intelligence/Counterintelligence agencies to carry outtheir\nmissions. Second,confidentiality must be maintained withrespect tothe use ornon-use ofthe\nactivity,source,ormethod,includingintelligencesources,ifthe viability,productivity,and\nusefulness ofthe activity, source, and method are to be preserved.\n(47) (U) Intelligence activities, sources, andmethods must beprotected from\ndisclosure inevery situation in which acertain intelligence capability, technique, orinterest- or\nits specificuse- isunknowntothe groupsagainstwhichit isdeployed,sincethosegroupscould\ntake countermeasures to nullify its effectiveness. Intelligence activities, sources, and methods\narevaluable onlyso long as they remainunknown and unsuspected. Once an intelligence\nactivity, source, or method- or the fact ofits use or non-use in a certainsituation- is discovered,\nits continuedsuccessful use is seriouslyjeopardized.\n(48) (U) Moreover, the U.S. Governmentmust domore thanpreventexplicit\nreferences to intelligence activities, sources, and methods; it mustalso preventindirect\nreferences to them. One vehicle for gathering informationaboutthe U.S. Government's\ncapabilities is by reviewing officially-releasedinformation. We knowthat terroristorganizations\nand otherhostile or ForeignIntelligence groups havethe capacity and abilityto gather\ninformationfrom myriad sources, analyze it, and deduce means and methods from disparate\ndetails to defeat the U.S. Government's collectionefforts. Thus, even seemingly innocuous,\nindirectreferences to an intelligence activity, source, or method couldhave significantadverse\neffects whenjuxtaposedwithotherpublicly-available data. •\n(U) Information Protected In This Case\n(49) (U) As discussed below, informationwithheld under Exemption (b)(1)in\n18\nSECRET//NOFORN\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 19 of 66\nSECRET//MOFORN\nconjunctionwith E.O. 13526 § 1.4(c)would, ifdisclosed, reveal otherwise non-public\ninformationregarding: the FBI's intelligence interests,priorities, activities, andmethods;\nundisclosed intelligence sources ormethods upon whichthe FBI relied in support ofits\napplication forFISA authorized surveillance ofCarter Page, aswell asundisclosed portions of\nintelligence informationprovided by Source#1; and information about the use and\nimplementationofvariousintelligencemethods,includingthespecificdetailsofthesurveillance\nofCarterPage authorized by the FISC viathe four applications and orders publiclyrevealed in\nthe HSPCI memoranda.

Using the fourth application\nand resulting orders as an example, this informationwas protectedon Bates pages 17-cv-\n597(FBI)-308-316.\n(58) (U)' Thedisclosure oftheabove-describedtypes ofinformationcould reasonably\nbe expectedto cause serious damage to the national security, as it would: (a) reveal actual\nintelligence activities undertakenbythe FBI, and the methods used in doing so, regarding\nspecific targets and during specific periods oftime; (b) disclosethe intelligence-gathering\ncapabilities ofthe methods; and (c) provide an assessmentofthe levelofpenetrationby the FBI\nofspecifictargets during the specific time period. Armedwith suchinformation, adversaries,\nincluding hostile foreign governments, could implementactions to thwartthe FBI's intelligence\nactivities and weaken or negate the particularintelligencemethods, whichwould severelydisrupt\nthe FBI's intelligence-gathering capabilities. Accordingly, this information is currently and\nproperly classifiedpursuant to E.G. 13526, § 1.4(c)atthe SECRET level, and the FBIproperly\nwithheld itimderExemption (b)(1).\n(59) (U) The FBI also concluded that the specific amounts ofpayments made to\n22\nSECRET//MOFORH\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 23 of 66\nSECRET//HOFORN\nintelligence sourcesreflected inthe records isclassified intelligence method information.\nWithout adequate context, the particularamountpaidto aparticularintelligence source could be\nviewedto suggestthe relativevoliime ofinformationprovided by aparticularsource, which\ncouldcause individuals who believethey are the subjects ofsuchsource reporting to assess the\nlikelihoodthattheir activities have cometo the FBI's attentionand thentake countermeasures,\ndestroy or fabricate evidence, or otherwise actin a way to thwartthe FBI's intelligence activities.\nMoreover, disclosure wouldrevealnon-public informationaboutthe level ofresources devoted\nto particulartargets or subjectmatters. The FBI has limited resources thatit must allocate\nstrategicallyin order to effectivelypursue its intelligence gathering mission. Revealingthe\namount ofmoneythe FBI has paidto particularintelligence sources and overparticularperiods\noftime wouldreveal the FBI's level offocus on certainintelligence gathering efforts. Revealing\nthis level offocus would reveal howthe FBI has allocated and is allocating its limitedresources.\nI\nIfaggregated over time, this informationwouldpaintahigh-level picture ofthe resources\ndevotedto particularthreat areas, and reveal wherethe FBI's strengths and weaknesses lie within\nthe spectrumofits intelligence-gathering activities. This would give sophisticatedadversaries\nand hostile governments the informationnecessaryto adjusttheir activities in accordance with\nthe FBI's perceivedpriorities, in orderto avoidthe FBI's strengthareas and exploitits weak\nones. Accordingly, the disclosure ofthis informationcould reasonably be expectedto cause\nserious damage to the national security, and is currentlyand properlyclassifiedpursuantto E.O.\n13526,§ 1.4(c)atthe SECRET level, and the FBI properly withheld it under Exemption (b)(1).\n(U) IntelligenceSources\n(60) (U) An intelligence sourcewhorequires continued classification is onethat\nprovided or is currentlyproviding information that pertainsto national securitymatters, the\n23\nSECRET//NOFORN\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 24 of 66\nSECRET//NOFORN\ndisclosure ofwhich could reasonablybe expected to result in serious damage to the FBI's\nintelligence-gatheringcapabilities.\n(61) (U) Although some information about Source#1 and his activities has been\ndeclassifiedandpubliclydisclosed,thefourPagePISAapplicationsincludeinformationabout\notherintelligencesources. This information,includingspecificinformationaboutthesources\nthemselves aswell asthe information theyprovided, is singular in nature and,ifdisclosed,\nreasonably could be expected to identify the contributing sources.\n(62) (U) Disclosure ofthe identities ofintelligence sources couldreasonably be\nexpectedtojeopardize their livelihoods, their families andotherrelationships, andeventheir\nlives. Moreover, disclosure ofone source can reasonablybe expectedto cause other currentand\npotential intelligence sources to fearthat their identities will bepublicly revealed atsome point.\nUsingthe fourth application and resulting orders as an example, this informationwas protected\non Bates pages 17-cv-597(FBI)-308-319.\n(63) (U) Thus, the release ofsource-identifyinginformationcanreasonably be\nexpectedto cause damage to the national security by causingcurrentintelligence sources to\ncease providing information, and discouragingpotentialintelligence sourcesfrom cooperating\nwiththe FBIfor fear theiridentities wouldbe publiclyrevealed at somepoint. Sucha source\nreactionwould eliminate one ofthe Intelligence Community's most crucial means ofcollecting\nintelligenceinformationand, therefore, severelyhamperthe FBI's intelligenceand investigative\nmissions. Accordingly, some ofthe protected intelligence source informationhere is currently\nand properlyclassifiedpursuantto E.G. 13526, § 1.4(c) atthe TOP SECRETlevel, for\nintelligence sourceinformation that could reasonably be expectedto cause exceptionally grave\ndamage to the national security, and some ofthe protected intelligence sourceinformationhere is\n24\nSECRET//NOFORN\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 25 of 66\nSECRET//NOFORN\ncurrently andproperly classified at the SECRETlevel, for intelligence source informationthat\ncould reasonablybe expectedto cause serious damage to the national security. The FBI properly\nwithheldthisinformationunderExemption (b)(l).^^\n(U) E,0.13526§ L4(d) - ForeignRelations orForeignActivities\n(64) (U) E.G. 13526 § 1.4(d) authorizes the classification ofinformation about\nforeign relations or foreign activities ofthe United States, includingconfidential sources. Such\ninformation includes information gatheredfrom/withthe assistance ofand/or aboutforeign\ncountries. It is sensitive due in partto the delicate nature ofinternational diplomacy, and must\nbe handled with care so as not tojeopardizethe fragile relationshipsthat existbetweenthe\nUnited States and certainforeign governments.\n(65) (U) The unauthorized disclosure ofinformationconcerningforeignrelations Or\nforeign activities ofthe United States can reasonablybe expectedto lead to diplomatic or\neconomic retaliation againstthe United States; the loss ofthe cooperationand assistance of\nfriendly nations; orthe compromiseofcooperative foreign sources, whichmayjeopardizetheir\nsafety and curtailthe flow ofinformationfrom these sources. Dueto the nature ofthe\ninformationhere,the FBI carmotprovide any more specific details onthe public recordabout its\nbasis for redacting informationpursuantto E.G. 13526, § 1.4(d) and Exemption (b)(1).\nHowever, as the FBI'sclassifiedportions ofthis declarationdemonstrate, this informationis\ncurrentlyand properly classified and was appropriatelyredactedby the FBI.\n(66) (S//NF)\n(U) TheintelligencesourceinformationprotectedintheFISCordersisclassifiedattheSECRETlevel\nonly.

Because this information\nremainscurrentlyandproperlyclassified,pursuantto E.O. 13526§ 1.4(c),theFBIproperly\nprotectedit underExemption(b)(1).\n(U) Exemption (b)(3)~InformationProtectedbyStatute\n(68) (U) Exemption (b)(3)protects informationthat is specifically exempted from\npublicdisclosurebyastatutethatrequiresthatthemattersbewithheldfromthepublicin sucha\nmannerasto leavenodiscretionontheissue,establishesparticularcriteriaforwithholding, or\nreferstoparticulartypesofmattersto bewithheld. 5U.S.C. §552(b)(3)(A).

The FBI is one ofthe member agencies comprisingtheIC, and as such must\nprotectintelligence sources and methods.\n(72) (U) Accordingly, the informationin the Page FISAapplications and resulting\nFISC ordersthat reveals intelligence sources and methods isprohibited from disclosurepursuant\nto 50U.S.C. §3024(i)(l) and thus exempt from disclosure under Exemption (b)(3).\n(73) (S//NF)\n27\nSECRET//NOFORN\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 28 of 66\nSECRET//NOFORN\n(U) Exemption (b)(7)- LawEnforcementInformation\n(U) Threshold\n(74) (U) ThefirststepinapplyinganyofExemption(b)(7)'ssubparts isto\ndemonstrate that the records or informationat issue were compiledfor law enforcement\npurposes. 5U.S.C. §552(b)(7).

Moreover, while unclear thatHSPCI's disclosures oftheNunes and SchiffMemos\nlegallyprecluded the FBI'sability to assert FOIA exemptions overmatching information inthe\nfourPage FISApackages processed here, the FBI nevertheless didnot redact any exactly\nmatching information. Furthermore, the FBI carefullyconsidered whetherto disclose similar\ninformationthatwas notan exactmatchto the memoranda, and asserted Exemption(b)(7)(A)\nonly upon concludingthat disclosure ofthe non-matching informationcould reasonably be\nexpected to harm the investigation.\n(91) (U) Forthe reasons discussed above, combined withthejustifications for\nprotecting information under the other exemptions discussed herein, the FBI concluded that\ndisclosure ofinformationmarked as \"(b)(7)(A)-1\" could reasonably be expectedto interfere with\nthe pendinginvestigation. Accordingly, the FBI withheld that informationpursuantto\nExemption(b)(7)(A).\n(U) Exemption (b)(7)(C) - UnwarrantedInvasionsofPersonalPrivacy\n(92) (U) Exemption(b)(7)(C) exempts from disclosure \"records or information\ncompiledfor law enforcementpurposes [when disclosure] could reasonably be expected to\nconstitute an unwarranted invasionofpersonal privacy.\" 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C).\n(93) (U) As previously noted in the sectionofthis declaration concerning Exemption\n(b)(6), the practiceofthe FBI is to conjunctivelyassertExemptions (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C) as they\nprovide overlappingprotections forpersonal privacy.

Each exemption\nbalances individuals' privacy interests againstthe public's interest in disclosure.\n(94) (U) Forpurposes ofboth exemptions, apublic interest exists onlywhen\ninformation would significantly increasethe public's understanding ofthe FBI's performance of\nits missionto protect anddefendthe United Statesagainst terrorist and foreign intelligence\nthreats;upholdandenforcethecriminallawsofthe UnitedStates;andprovideleadershipand\ncriminaljustice servicesto federal, state, municipal, andinternational agencies andpartners.\n(95) (U) The FBI has relied onExemptions (b)(6)and(b)(7)(C) here to protectthe\nnames ofor informationabout FBI SpecialAgents and FISC and NSD employees; information\nsufficientto identifyathird partywho was the source ofsome informationrelied upon in the\nfourPage FISA applications; andcertain personally-identifyingand othernon-public private\ninformationabout CarterPage.\n(U) (h)(6VmTi(C)-l FBISpecialAgents\n(96) (U) The FBI withheld the names ofthe FBI Special Agents who signedthe Page\nFISAapplications processed in responseto plaintiffs request.

See 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(b)(7)(E).\n(U) FOIAExemption(b)(1)asa BasisforthePartialGlomarResponse\n(147) (U) FOIA Exemption (b)(1)protects records that are:\"(A) specifically authorized\nundercriteriaestablished by an Executive order to be kept secretin the interestofnational\n55\nSECRET//NOFORN\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 56 of 66\nSECRET//NOFQRN\ndefenseor foreignpolicy and (B)are infact properly classified pursuant to suchExecutive\norder.\" 5U.S.C. § 552(b)(1).\n(148) (U) E.0.13526 § 1.1(a)providesthatinformationmaybe originallyclassified\nimder the terms ofthis orderonly ifall ofthe following conditions are met: (1) an original\nclassification authorityis classifying the information; (2)the information isownedby, produced\nby or for, oris underthe control ofthe U.S. Government; (3)the information falls within oneor\nmore ofthe categories ofinformationlisted in § 1.4ofE.G. 13526; and (4) the original\nclassificationauthoritydetermines that the unauthorized disclosure ofthe informationreasonably\ncouldbe expectedto result in some level ofdamage to the national security, and the original\nclassificationauthority is able to identifyor describethe damage.\n(149) (U) E.G. 13526explicitly authorizes precisely the type ofresponsethat the FBI\nhas provided toplaintiffin this case. Specifically, §3.6(a) provides that \"[a]nagency mayrefuse\nto confirmor deny the existenceor nonexistence ofrequested records wheneverthe fact oftheir\nexistence or nonexistence is itselfclassified under this order or its predecessors.\"\n(150) (U) ConsistentwithE.G. 13526 and as described below, I have determinedthat\nacknowledgingthe existence or nonexistence ofthe records requested by plaintiff, beyond the\nfour Carter Page FISAapplications and orders discussed in detail above, wouldrequire the FBI\nto disclose properlyclassifiedfacts thatconcern § i.4(c) (\"intelligence activities, sources, and\nmethods\") and § 1.4(d) (\"foreign relations and foreign activities ofthe United States\").\nMoreover, responsive records, ifthey exist, wouldbe owned by and underthe control ofthe U.S.\nGovernment. Finally, I have determinedthat acknowledgingthe existence or non-existence of\ntherequestedrecordsreasonablycouldbeexpectedtoresultin damagetonationalsecurity.\n56\nSECRET//NOFORN\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 57 of 66\nSECRET//NOFORN\n(151) (U) My determinationthat theexistence or nonexistence ofthe requested records\nis classified has not been made to conceal violations oflaw, inefficiency, or administrative error;\nto prevent embarrassment to aperson, organization, oragency; to restrain competition; orto\nprevent or delaythe release ofinformation that does not requireprotection in the interests of\nnational security\n(U) IntelligenceActivities,Sources, andMethods\n(152) (U) The records requested byplaintiffs, ifthey exist, implicate classified\nintelligence activities and methods, andacknowledgingthe existence ornon-existence ofany\nsuch records reasonably can be expectedto cause damage to national security. An intelligence\nactivityor method includes anyintelligence action ortechnique utilized by the FBI against a\ntargetedindividual or organization that has beendetermined to be ofnational securityinterest,\nandincludes anyprocedure (humanor non-human) utilized to obtain information concerning\nsuch individual or organization. An intelligence activity or method has two characteristics.\nFirst, the intelligence activity or method, and informationgenerated by it, is needed by United\nStatesIntelligence/Counterintelligence agencies to carryouttheirmissions. Second,\nconfidentiality must be maintainedwithrespectto the use or non-use ofthe activity or method,\nincluding intelligence sources, ifthe viability, productivity, and usefulness ofthe activity,\nmethod, and source are to be preserved.\n(153) (U) Intelligence activities and methods mustbe protectedfrom disclosure in\nevery situationin which a certainintelligence capability, technique, or interest- or its specific\n^ (U) Totheextentpossibleonthepublicrecord, Ihaveexplainedtheharmtonational securitythat\nwould result from confirmingordenying the existence ornon-existenceresponsiverecords here.

Onevehiclefor\ngatheringinformation about the U.S. Government's capabilities is byreviewing officially-\nreleased information. We knowthat terroristorganizations and other hostile or Foreign\nIntelligence groupshave the capacity and abilityto gather information from myriad sources,\nanalyze it, and deduce means and methods from disparate details to defeat the U.S.\nGovernment's collectionefforts. Thus, even seeminglyinnocuous, indirectreferences to an\nintelligence activity, source, or method could have significant adverse effects whenjuxtaposed\nwith other publicly-availabledata.\n(155) (U) Here, acknowledgingthe existenceor non-existence ofrecords responsive to\nplaintiffs request, beyond the four Carter Page FISA applications and resulting FISC orders,and\nformer DirectorComey's March20, 2017 statementthat neitherthe FBI norDOJ have any\ninformationabout the alleged wiretapping referredto inPresidentTrump's March 4, 2017\ntweets, wouldbetantamounttoconfirmingwhetherornottheFBIhasreliedonaparticular\nintelligence activity or method targeted at particularindividuals or organizations. The FBI has\nnot confirmedor deniedthe existence ofany other FISA surveillance records responsiveto\nplaintiffs request. Confirming or denying whether any ornot other responsive records exist\nwould reveal otherwisenon-public information regarding the nature ofthe FBI's intelligence\n58\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 59 of 66\nSECRET//NOFORN\ninterests,priorities,activities,andmethods—informationthatis highlydesiredbyhostileactors\nwho seek to thwartthe FBI's intelligence-gatheringmission. Accordingly, to confirm or deny\nthattheFBIpossessesor doesnotpossessrecordsresponsiveto plaintiffs requestcouldrisk\ncompromisingintelligenceactivitiesormethods,andthuswouldposeat leastaseriousriskto\nthenational security.^^\n(U) ForeignRelations andForeignActivities ofthe UnitedStates\n(156) (U) Respondingtoplaintiffs requestwithanythingotherthanaGlomarresponse\nwould also reveal informationconcerning U.S. foreign relations and foreign activities, the\ndisclosure ofwhichreasonably can be expected to cause damage to national security.

Law enforcement agencies such astheFBI must\ndemonstrate thatthe records at issue arerelated to the enforcementoffederal laws and thatthe\nenforcementactivity is withinthe law enforcementduty ofthatagency.\n(165) (U) The only circumstance under whichthe FBI can request aFISAorder is\nwhenthe FBI is conducting an authorized, predicatednational securityinvestigation withinthe\nscope ofits law enforcementand foreign intelligence responsibilities.

The FBIsought and obtaineda FISA warrant in October 2016 to\nconductsurveillance ofCarterPage in the course ofthat investigation. The FBI thereafter sought\nand obtained three renewals from the FISC to continue surveilling Page. The FISA applications\nwere compiled aspart ofthe investigation into Russian election interference. In May 2017, the\nActingAttorney General appointed Special Counsel Mueller and authorizedhim to conductthe\nRussian electioninterference investigation confirmed by then-FBI Director James Comey on\nMarch20,2017. That investigationis on-going. Plaintiffs request specificallyseeks FISA\napplications and FISC orders related tothe Russian election interference investigation. Thus, the\nrequirement ofapendingenforcementproceeding in Exemption(b)(7)(A) is satisfied.\n(169) (U) The final element—interference with that investigation- isreadily\nestablished. Confirmingor denying the existence or non-existence ofresponsiverecords would\nreveal non-public informationaboutthe focus, scope, and conductofthat investigation.\nSpecifically, it wouldreveal whether or not specificinvestigative techniques have been used;\nwhen and to what extentthey were used, iftheywere; theirrelative value orbenefitiftheywere\nused; and the targets they were used against, ifany. Prematurelydisclosing non-public\ninformationaboutthe Russia investigationcould givetargets and others intent oninterfering\nwith the FBI's investigative efforts the informationnecessaryto: take defensive actions to\nconceal criminal activities; develop and implementcountermeasures to elude detection; suppress,\ndestroy, or fabricate evidence; and identifypotential witnesses or sources, exposingthemto\nharassment, intimidation, coercion, and/or physical threats. Accordingly, confirming or denying\nthe existence ornon-existence ofresponsive records, beyondthe four Carter Page FISA\napplicationsandordersdiscussedindetailabove,couldreasonablybeexpectedtoadversely\nm\n63\nSECRET//NOFORN\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 64 of 66\nSECRET//NQFORN\naffectthependinginvestigation.

This exemptionaffords categorical\nprotectiontotechniquesandproceduresusedin lawenforcementinvestigations; itprotects\ntechniques andprocedures that arenot well-known tothe public aswell asnon-public details\nabouttheuse ofwell-knowntechniques and procedures.\n(171) (U) Howthe FBI applies its investigative resources (or not) againstaparticular\nallegation, report ofcriminal activity, or perceived threat is itselfa law enforcementtechnique or\nprocedure that the FBI protects pursuantto Exemption(b)(7)(E).\n(172) (U) As previouslydemonstrated, acknowledging or denying the existence or non-\nexistence ofthe lawenforcementrecords thatplaintiffseeks, beyond the four Carter Page FISA\napplications and orders discussedin detail above, wouldbe tantamountto confirming or denying\nwhetheror not the FBI is employingspecificinvestigative techniques authorized underthe FISA\nagainstspecifictargets as partofthe pendingRussianinterference investigation. Even in\nacknowledged investigations, the FBI does not routinely disclose whether or not it has employed\nthis particular classifiedinvestigative technique against aparticular target.

Armed withlthis information, adversaries\ncould gleansignificant insight into the activities likelyto attract- or not attract- the FBI'slaw\nenforcementattention. These individuals wouldthenbeable altertheirbehaviorto avoid\nattention by law enforcement, making it more difficult for the FBI to be proactivein assessing\nthreats and investigatingcrimes. Therefore, the FBI can neither confirmnor deny the existence\nofrecords responsive to plaintiffs request, beyond the four Carter Page FISAapplications and\norders discussed in detail above, without causing harms protected againstby FOIAExemption\n(b)(7)(E), and Exemption(b)(7)(E) provides independentjustificationfor the FBI's partial\nGlomarresponse here.\n(U) CONCLUSION\n(173) (U) For the reasons described above, the FBI's Glomarresponse toplaintiffs\nrequest, exceptastorecords that have been officiallypublicly revealed, was proper; the FBI's\nsearchfor records responsive to the portionofplaintiffs request for whichthe Glomar response\nhas been pierced- i.e.,the four FISAapplications and orders on Carter Page revealed in the\nHPSCImemoranda- was reasonably calculatedto, andinfact did, locatethe responsive records;\nthe FBI properlyprotectedinformation in the four Page FISA applications and orders pursuant to\nFOIA Exemptions (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(6), and (b)(7)(A) and (C)-(E); and the FBI reasonably\nsegregatedand released non-exempt information onthepages released inpart andproperly\nconcludedthatit could notdo so on the pages withheld in full.\n65\nSECRET//NOFORN\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 66 of 66\nSECRBT//NOFORN\n(U) Pursuantto28U.S.C. §1746,1declareunderpenaltyofperjurythattheforegoing is\ntrue andcorrect,andthatExhibitsAai^>B^^chedhereto aretrueand correctcopies.\n(U) Executedthis CTSOlS.\nDAVID M.

See The James Madison Project v. Dep’t of Justice, 2020 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 36303 (D.D.C. Mar. 3, 2020). \nIn its 2020 Opinion, this Court granted summary judgment to the defendant, \nDepartment of Justice (“DOJ”), with respect to two issues: (1) the 21 pages of DOJ’s \noriginal production that the Plaintiffs argued had been declassified by way of the press \nrelease issued on behalf of President Donald J. Trump (hereinafter referred to as the \n“Declassification Dispute”); and (2) the appropriateness of the redactions and \nwithholdings applied to the production as a whole (“Remaining Pages”). Id.1 It is only the \nlatter issue that is the subject of this Rule 59(e) Motion. With all due respect, it is the \nPlaintiffs’ contention that this Court erred in its determination the Plaintiffs had conceded \nor otherwise abandoned their opportunity to contest the redactions and withholdings in \nthe Remaining Pages.  \nFor the reasons outlined below, this Court should grant the Rule 59(e) Motion, vacate \nin part its 2020 Opinion with respect to the Remaining Pages and issue a supplemental \nmemorandum opinion adjudicating the appropriateness of the redactions and \nwithholdings in the Remaining Pages. DOJ opposes the Plaintiff’s requested relief. \n \n1 To clarify, there were 412 pages of records that DOJ released in whole or in part as part \nof this action, and 186 pages that were withheld in their entirety. See Dkt. No. 42 at *3 \n(filed November 9, 2018). Only 21 pages were at issue in the competing cross-motions \nfor summary judgment regarding the Declassification Dispute. Id. at *4. \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 64   Filed 03/13/20   Page 3 of 7\nARGUMENT \n \nMotions to alter or amend a judgment under Rule 59(e) lie within the discretion of the \nCourt. See Mercy Gen. Hosp. v. Azar, 410 F. Supp. 3d 63, 70 (D.D.C. 2019). Although \nRule 59(e) motions are “disfavored”, and the movant party bears the burden of \nestablishing “extraordinary circumstances” warranting relief, see Niedermeier v. Office \nof Baucus, 153 F. Supp. 2d 23, 28 (D.D.C. 2001), such motions can be granted if there is \na need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice. See Anyanwutaku v. Moore, \n151 F.3d 1053, 1057-58 (D.C. Cir. 1998); see also Firestone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, \n1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996)(applying “abuse of discretion” standard for appellate review of a \ndenial of a Rule 59(e) motion). A motion for reconsideration under Rule 59(e) can only \nbe filed after the court’s entry of a final judgment, and the filing of a proper motion under \nRule 59(e) stops the appeal clock until after the motion is decided. See Cobell v. Jewell, \n802 F.3d 12, 19 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  \nWith due respect, this Court’s 2020 Opinion – which was a final, appealable order – \nincludes a clear error that requires correction by way of this Rule 59(e) Motion.  \nSubsequent to the release (in part) of the 412 pages (as well as withholding in full of \nthe other 186 pages) at issue in this action, DOJ filed a Motion for Summary Judgment \n(“2018 Motion”).2 See Dkt. No. 40 (dated October 19, 2018). In the 2018 Motion, DOJ \nargued that information had been redacted and/or withheld in full in reliance upon \nExemptions 1, 3, 6, 7(A), 7(C), 7(D) and 7(E). See id. at *15-*32. In their memorandum \nin opposition to the 2018 Motion, and separate and distinct from their cross-motion \n \n2 These pages were not implicated by the Government’s continued refusal to confirm or \ndeny the existence or non-existence of other responsive records. See Dkt. No. 40 at *32. \nThat “Glomar response” is no longer in dispute. \n  2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 64   Filed 03/13/20   Page 4 of 7\nregarding the Declassification Dispute, the Plaintiffs outlined the basis for their argument \nthat summary judgment was not warranted with respect to the Government’s redactions \nand/or withholdings of the Remaining Pages. See Dkt. No. 42 at *10-*14 (filed \nNovember 9, 2018). Specifically, the Plaintiffs alleged that the public statements of \nPresident Donald J. Trump had called into question the good faith bases of the \nGovernment’s redactions and/or withholdings. Id. The Government responded to these \narguments in its reply brief in support of their 2018 Motion. See Dkt. No. 43 at *8-*12 \n(filed November 30, 2018). \nIn a Memorandum Opinion, issued July 30, 2019, this Court focused on the \nDeclassification Dispute, and specifically noted that the 21 pages were the “sole \ncontested issue in the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment”. See The James \nMadison Project v. Dep’t of Justice, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126575 at *2 (D.D.C.  \nJul. 30, 2019)(“2019 Opinion”). With the benefit of hindsight, and particularly given this \nCourt’s confusion expressed in the 2020 Opinion, the Plaintiffs realize that they may \nhave misconstrued the nature of this Court’s meaning with that sentence. As a simple \nfactual matter, this Court’s statement was accurate, as the 21 pages were the extent of the \nDeclassification Dispute that required competing cross-motions for summary judgment. \nConsequently, the Plaintiffs believed in good faith that this Court’s decision to rule only \nupon that narrow matter, and ultimately require supplemental briefing to resolve the \nDeclassification Dispute, was a practical decision by this Court to address the more \nabstract and novel constitutional question surrounding presidential declassification before \nreturning to and ultimately addressing the properly-briefed matter of the Remaining \nPages. \n  3 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 64   Filed 03/13/20   Page 5 of 7\nAgain, with hindsight, it may have been advisable for the Plaintiffs to have more \nforcefully sought clarification from this Court after the issuance of the 2019 Opinion. \nHowever, it was arguably reasonable for the Plaintiffs to have construed the  \n2019 Opinion in the manner in which they did, especially since the parties had still \nproperly briefed out the legal issue surrounding the Remaining Pages in their respective \npleadings. There was no identifiable reason for the Plaintiffs to have concluded that this \nCourt believed the only issue left in this action was the Declassification Dispute.  \n Furthermore, the Plaintiffs respectfully dispute the rationale by which this Court \ninterpreted the Plaintiffs’ statements in their prior pleadings. This Court stated in its 2020 \nOpinion that it concluded the only issue remaining in this action was the Declassification \nDispute based upon the Plaintiffs’ statement they had “confined their Cross-Motion for \nPartial Summary Judgment (“Cross-Motion”), as well as their Memorandum in \nOpposition to the Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment, strictly to the legal \nappropriateness of the redactions and withholdings made to the documents that have been \nproduced as part of this litigation.” See The James Madison Project, 2020 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 36303 at *9. With all due respect, that statement in no way stipulates to the idea \nthat the 21 pages subject to the Declassification Dispute were all that remained at issue. \nThe Plaintiffs’ statement clearly outlined how their challenges, as outlined in the cross-\nmotion and the memorandum in opposition, concerned the redactions and withholdings \n“made to the documents that have been produced as part of this litigation.” Id.  \nThere were 412 pages produced (in whole or in part), and 186 pages withheld in their \nentirety, as part of this litigation: not merely the 21 pages at issue in the Declassification \nDispute. The Plaintiffs properly and distinctly addressed the narrow Declassification \n  4 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 64   Filed 03/13/20   Page 6 of 7\nDispute in a partial cross-motion for summary judgment, while also separately addressing \nthe legal appropriateness of the redactions and withholdings made to the entirety of \nGovernment’s production in their memorandum in opposition. See Dkt. No. 41 at *3-*7 \n(filed November 9, 2018)(cross-motion); Dkt. No. 42 at *10-*14 (memorandum in \nopposition). The Plaintiffs did exactly what they were supposed to do given the different \nlegal issues before them: they cross-moved for summary judgment in their favor with \nrespect to the Declassification Dispute, which they argued was a strictly legal matter, and \nthey opposed the Government’s summary judgment pleading regarding the redactions \nand withholdings to the Remaining Pages, as they were only contending that the \nGovernment had not yet met its burden warranting that relief. \nIt is unclear what more this Court expected the Plaintiffs to have done in this \nsituation.3 Given the reasonable interpretation by the Plaintiffs of the meaning of this \nCourt’s 2019 Opinion, the Plaintiffs only addressed the Declassification Dispute in the \nsubsequent pleadings both parties filed in 2019 and that were adjudicated by this Court in \nits 2020 Opinion. The Plaintiffs had no reasonable basis to conclude this Court had, for \nall intents and purposes, overlooked the dispute over the Remaining Pages. \n  Respectfully, these circumstances more than sufficiently meet the standard of “clear \nerror” that warrant granting the Plaintiffs’ Rule 59(e) Motion. See Firestone, 76 F.3d at \n1209. This is not a situation where the Plaintiffs are seeking to relitigate an adjudicated \nmatter, see Estate of Gaither ex rel. Gaither v. District of Columbia, 771 F. Supp. 2d 5, 10 \n(D.D.C. 2011), as the Plaintiffs are not seeking a second bite at the proverbial apple. The \nPlaintiffs merely seek a supplemental memorandum opinion adjudicating the legal \n \n3 To the best of the undersigned’s recollection, there were no status conferences or \nhearings in this matter subsequent to the parties filing their respective pleadings in 2018.  \n  5 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 64   Filed 03/13/20   Page 7 of 7\ndispute surrounding the Remaining Pages that the parties both properly briefed back in \n2018 and that the Plaintiffs reasonably believed had been held in abeyance pending \nresolution of the Declassification Dispute.  \n  It was clearly erroneous for this Court to construe that issue as conceded or \nabandoned given the existence of properly filed pleadings by both parties, and this Court \nshould grant the Plaintiffs’ Rule 59(e) Motion as a result.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant the Rule 59(e) Motion, vacate in \npart its 2020 Opinion with respect to the Remaining Pages and issue a supplemental \nmemorandum opinion adjudicating the appropriateness of the redactions and \nwithholdings in the Remaining Pages. \nDate: March 13, 2020 \n            Respectfully submitted, \n \n                 /s/ \n            ________________________ \nBradley P.

The Court’s July 2019 conclusion that the “sole contested issue” was the \ndisputed pages allegedly declassified was a reasonable reading of Plaintiffs’ submissions at the \ntime.  See Dkt. 51 (“July 2019 Op.”).  And Plaintiffs thereafter abandoned the argument by \nfailing to raise it in response to Defendants’ renewed motion for summary judgment.  In any \nevent, Plaintiffs have had ample opportunity since July 2019 to correct the record or seek \nreconsideration but failed to do so.  Finally, to the extent the Court entertains Plaintiffs’ request \nfor adjudication of the other pages, it can do so in summary fashion –the Government’s \ndeclarations were more than adequate to meet Defendants’ burden with respect to the remaining \npages. \nBACKGROUND \nThe Court fully set forth the background of this FOIA case in its July 2019 Opinion and \nin the Final Opinion issued March 3, 2020.  See generally Dkt. 51, 62.  In brief, Plaintiffs sought \ndocuments related to alleged FISA surveillance of the Trump Campaign.  Id. Defendant DOJ \nmoved for summary judgment as to both its partial Glomar response, and its processing and \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 65   Filed 03/26/20   Page 2 of 7\nrelease of the redacted FISA applications and orders related to Carter Page.  Id.  Plaintiffs’ \nopposition and cross-motion argued primarily: (1) that 21 pages had been declassified by the \nPresident; and (2) that the Government’s redactions lacked a good faith basis.  See Dkt. 41, 42.  \nThe first argument relied on a White House press release related to those specific 21 pages, and \non posts on the President’s twitter feed.  See Dkt. 42, at 4-10.  The latter argument was made \nvaguely, without reference to particular redactions or even the declarations, instead relying on \nadditional tweets by the President, id. at 10-14, and it was unclear whether Plaintiffs were \nchallenging the sufficiency of the Government’s case only with respect to the 21 pages at issue in \n(1).   The Government responded to both arguments.  See Dkt. 43.  Plaintiffs’ reply brief focused \nnarrowly only on the 21 disputed pages, and mentioned the “bad faith” argument only in passing \nin support of its position as to the 21 pages.  See Dkt. 45, at 5 n.3. \nThe Court interpreted Plaintiffs’ argument as narrowed to the twenty-one pages that \nPlaintiffs argued were declassified.  In the July 2019 opinion, the Court referred to these 21 \npages at the “sole contested issue” and denied summary judgment solely on the basis of the lack \nof information about the alleged declassification.  Dkt. 51.  The Court denied both motions for \nsummary judgment, but allowed Defendant to submit a renewed motion and an additional \ndeclaration.  Id.  Defendants filed a new motion for summary judgment that incorporated \nprevious filings by reference, see Dkt. 52, and that motion was fully briefed, see Dkt. 53, 55.  \nThe parties then filed additional notices and reports with the Court, including about the ongoing \ndeclassification review of the FISA applications.  See Dkt. 56, 57, 60, 61.1   In their response to \n                                                           \n1 As set forth in Defendant’s status report, DOJ has not yet completed its subsequent \ndeclassification review of the Page FISA applications as a result of the OIG Report, but that \nreview does not affect this Court’s review of the previously made redactions.  See Dkt. 57.  The \nreview is likely to be further extended as a result of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, \nincluding the temporary suspension of operations at the FBI’s Record/Information Dissemination \nSection, which is coordinating review of these records.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 65   Filed 03/26/20   Page 3 of 7\nDefendant’s status report about that ongoing review, Plaintiffs raised for the first time (as a \n“housekeeping matter”) their position that the July 2019 Opinion was wrong and that they never \nabandoned their claim for the other pages beyond the 21 pages that were the focus of the \nPlaintiffs’ first round of briefing. See Dkt. 60.   \nOn March 3, 2020, the Court granted Defendant’s renewed motion for summary \njudgment.  See Dkt. 62.  With respect to Plaintiffs’ “housekeeping matter,” the Court explained: \nPlaintiffs had every opportunity to oppose and cross-move as to any and all \nissues raised in Defendant’s original motion for summary judgment, or as to \nany other issue they wished. They chose instead to contest only one discrete \nissue. Plaintiffs cannot now revive what they long ago abandoned.  \n \nDkt. 62, at 6-7.  Plaintiffs now bring this motion to reconsider that conclusion, arguing that they \nnever intended to abandon their claim for the remainder of the pages processed in response to \ntheir FOIA request. \nARGUMENT \nI.  Reconsideration is an Extraordinary Remedy. \nRule 59(e) is an “extraordinary measure” permitting reconsideration of a final judgment.  \nLeidos, Inc. v. Hellenic Republic, 881 F.3d 213, 217 (D.C. Cir. 2018).  “Under Rule 59(e), the \ncourt may grant a motion to amend or alter a judgment under three circumstances only: (1) if \nthere is an ‘intervening change of controlling law’; (2) if new evidence becomes available; or (3) \nif the judgment should be amended in order to ‘correct a clear error or prevent manifest \ninjustice.’” Id. (quoting Firestone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (per \ncuriam)). Rule 59(e) “may not be used to relitigate old matters, or to raise arguments or present \nevidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.” Leidos, Inc., 881 F.3d at \n217 (quoting Exxon Shipping v. Baker, 554 U.S. 471, 486 n.5 (2008).  It is “not a vehicle to \npresent a new legal theory that was available prior to judgment.” Patton Boggs LLP v. Chevron \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 65   Filed 03/26/20   Page 4 of 7\nCorp., 683 F.3d 397, 403 (D.C. Cir. 2012); Koch v. Clayton, No. 12-CV-01934 (APM), 2017 \nWL 2389921, at *1 (D.D.C. June 1, 2017) (“The moving party may not rely on a Rule 59(e) \nmotion to present facts or argument upon which the court has already ruled or to present for the \nfirst time arguments or theories that could and should have been raised previously.”). \n“To constitute ‘clear error’ within the meaning of Rule 59(e), courts have required ‘a \nvery exacting standard.’”  Slate v. Am. Broad. Companies, Inc., 12 F. Supp. 3d 30, 35 (D.D.C. \n2013).  “[T]o be clearly erroneous, a decision must strike [a court] as more than just maybe or \nprobably wrong; it must ... strike [the court] as wrong with the force of a five-week-old, \nunrefrigerated dead fish.” Id. (quoting Parts & Elec. Motors, Inc. v. Sterling Elec., Inc., 866 F.2d \n228, 233 (7th Cir. 1988)).  Similarly, manifest injustice “does not exist where ... a party could \nhave easily avoided the outcome, but instead elected not to act until after a final order had been \nentered.”  Ciralsky v. CIA, 355 F.3d 661, 665 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  “[M]anifest injustice” requires \n“at least (1) a clear and certain prejudice to the moving party that (2) is fundamentally unfair in \nlight of governing law.” Mohammadi v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 947 F. Supp. 2d 48, 78 (D.D.C. \n2013), aff’d, 782 F.3d 9 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nII.  Plaintiffs Have Not Shown Clear Error in the March 2020 Opinion. \nPlaintiffs cannot show error, much less “clear error” or “manifest injustice,” because the \nCourt correctly concluded that Plaintiffs abandoned these arguments about the other pages long \nago.  It is, at best, questionable as to whether Plaintiffs ever made an argument that Defendants’ \nsubmissions were inadequate beyond the 21 disputed pages.  The “bad faith” argument was \nseparately treated in Plaintiffs’ briefs on summary judgment, see Dkt. 41, 42, at 10-14 (in both \nbriefs), but it was not clear whether the alleged “bad faith” applied to all records at issue or just \nthe 21 pages in the previous section.   In reply, Plaintiffs seemed to clarify, or perhaps to narrow \ntheir arguments – they failed to answer any of the arguments made by Defendants in response to \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 65   Filed 03/26/20   Page 5 of 7\nthe “bad faith” argument and focused exclusively on the 21 pages.  Dkt. 47.  It is thus entirely \nreasonable that the Court concluded, in July 2019, that the “sole contested issue” was the \nredactions in the 21 disputed pages mentioned in the White House press release. Dkt. 51, at 2. \nEven if that is incorrect, and Plaintiffs never intended to so narrow their claims during the \nbriefing prior to July 2019, the Court certainly reasonably concluded that Plaintiffs’ failure to \nraise the alleged error immediately after July 2019, or even in response to the renewed motion to \ndismiss, was sufficient to constitute abandonment.  On August 30, 2019, Defendant moved for \nsummary judgment as to all issues in the case; if this were truly an issue, Plaintiffs should have \nraised it then in opposition.  But they mention those pages only in a confusing footnote.  See Dkt. \n53, at 2 n.2 (“This Court has not yet ruled on the extent to which DOJ’s remaining redactions \nand/or withholdings that the Plaintiffs are challenging were appropriate as a matter of law.”).  \nThe statement in that footnote is incorrect; the Court had already identified the 21 pages as the \n“sole contested issue.”  Dkt. 51, at 2.  And a footnote is not to sufficient to preserve the alleged \nissue that was explained, for the first time in supplemental briefing on tangential issues, nearly \nsix months after the supposed error, and after substantive briefing was completed on the renewed \nmotion.   See Dkt. 62, at 7 (citing Hayes v. District of Columbia, 923 F. Supp. 2d 44, 51 (D.D.C. \n2013) (treating a claim as conceded when the plaintiff did not “specifically dispute the \ndefendant’s argument” regarding the claim in her opposition); Valles-Hall v. Ctr. For Nonprofit \nAdvancement, 481 F. Supp. 2d 118, 140 (D.D.C. 2007) (deeming abandoned claims not raised by \nthe plaintiff in her revised opposition to the defendant’s summary judgment motion); Brodie v. \nBurwell, No. 15-322 (JEB), 2016 WL 3248197, at *14 (D.D.C. June 13, 2016) (treating as \nabandoned a claim that a party only mentions “in passing” in his opposition motion)). \nPlaintiffs’ explanation to the contrary is unconvincing.  They explain their belief that \n“this Court’s decision to rule only upon that narrow matter, and ultimately require supplemental \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 65   Filed 03/26/20   Page 6 of 7\nbriefing to resolve the Declassification Dispute, was a practical decision by this Court to address \nthe more abstract and novel constitutional question surrounding presidential declassification \nbefore returning to and ultimately addressing the properly-briefed matter of the Remaining \nPages.”  Dkt. 64, at 3.  But that theory finds no support in the July 2019 opinion, which \nspecifically identifies that 21 pages as the “sole contested issue in the parties’ cross-motions for \nsummary judgment.”  Dkt. 51, at 2.  Plaintiffs could not have plausibly read that statement as a \n“practical” decision to resolve the declassification issue first.  And Defendant’s renewed motion \nfor summary judgment was clearly made for complete summary judgment, not partial summary \njudgment as to a narrow issue.  Dkt. 52.  Nor does Plaintiffs’ theoretical bifurcated handling of \nthe case make any sense because the propriety of the redactions as to other pages does not turn \nupon the declassification issue.  In any case, even if Defendant is incorrect, and Plaintiffs’ \nconfusion was perfectly reasonable, the Court did not commit “clear error” under Rule 59(e).  \nDefendants moved for summary judgment as to all issues in August 2019, and Plaintiffs did not \nraise this issue in response.   It is accordingly abandoned. \nPlaintiffs also express confusion as to “what more this Court expected the Plaintiffs to \nhave done in this situation.”  Dkt. 64, at 5.  But Plaintiffs could have moved to reconsider the \nJuly 2019 opinion, or at a minimum, they could have raised this issue in response to Defendant’s \nrenewed motion for summary judgment.  They did not.  And the Court has not committed clear \nerror by refusing to allow the claim’s resurrection. \nIII.  Defendants Are Entitled to Summary Judgment. \n  Even if the Court were to reach the issue, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment.  \nPlaintiffs’ vague complaints that the Defendants’ declarations may have been made in bad faith \nare insufficient to raise a genuine dispute of material fact.  See generally Dkt. 41, 42, at 10-14.   \nAs set forth in Defendant’s opposition, agency declarants are entitled to a presumption of good \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 65   Filed 03/26/20   Page 7 of 7\nfaith, and Plaintiffs failed to challenge any particular statement in the Hardy or Findlay \ndeclarations.  See generally Dkt. 43, at 8-12.  Rather, even in their own motion for summary \njudgment, Plaintiffs have wholly conceded the applicability of the government’s claimed \nexemptions in general. Plaintiffs cannot therefore manufacture an issue of material fact as to the \nprocessing in general by relying on generalized, vague allegations based on no personal \nknowledge.  In their motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs relied on two tweets that they \nclaim reflect the President’s criticism of the redactions, but these vague and nonspecific tweets, \nbased on no personal knowledge and not commenting on the precise issues presented to the \nCourt, are insufficient to overcome the presumption.  Dkt. 43, at 9-11.  Accordingly the Court’s \ndecision granting summary judgment for the Government was entirely correct. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration. \nDated:  March 26, 2020        Respectfully Submitted, \n \nETHAN P.

In the \ncontext of this present case, the specific potential targets of surveillance originally at \nissue in the Plaintiffs’ underlying FOIA requests were President Donald J. Trump \n(“President Trump”), his presidential campaign, his private company, or his associates.  \nThe factual background with respect to how this litigation unfolded – including the \nunprecedented disclosure by the defendant Department of Justice (“DOJ”) of four \napplications made to the FISC to authorize the surveillance of Carter W. Page  \n(“Mr. Page”) – has already been well-documented for this Court by both parties,  \nsee Dkt. #5 (First Amended Complaint)(filed April 15, 2017); Dkt. #40 (Defendant’s \nStatement of Material Facts in Support of Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment) \n(filed October 19, 2018); Dkt. #52 (Supplemental Statement of Material Facts in Support \nof Defendant’s Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment)(filed August 30, 2019), and the \nPlaintiffs have no desire to further burden it with details regarding which it is already \nwell aware.1  \n \n \n1 The Plaintiffs respectfully incorporate the Government’s two statements of material \nfacts herein by reference, subject to the caveat – as done previously, see Dkt. #42 at *2 \n(filed November 9, 2018) – that the Plaintiffs are only incorporating the statements to the \nextent they do not constitute legal characterizations or conclusions regarding the \nappropriateness of DOJ’s invocations of particular FOIA exemptions. \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 53   Filed 09/13/19   Page 5 of 14\nIn its Memorandum Opinion issued on July 30, 2019, this Court denied both parties \nrespective motions for summary judgment with respect to a particular issue: the 21 pages \nof one FISC application for authorization for surveillance of Mr. Page (the “Pages”).  \nSee The James Madison Project, et al. v. Dep’t of Justice, 2019 U.S Dist. LEXIS 126575 \n(D.D.C. Jul. 30, 2019). This Court specifically made two conclusions: (1) that DOJ had \nfailed to sufficiently clarify the legal impact of President Trump’s September 17, 2018, \npress release ordering the declassification of the Pages (the “Order”), as well as  \nPresident Trump’s subsequent tweets possibly rescinding the declassification; and (2) that \nDOJ had failed to sufficiently explain the authority of DOJ to still invoke other \nexemptions to justify withholding the Pages in light of the existence of the Order.  \nId., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126575 at *2, *6, *8.2 \nDOJ has now filed a Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment (“Renewed Motion”), \ncomplete with a declaration from G. Bradley Weinsheimer (“Weinsheimer Declaration”) \nthat seeks to fill in the gaps identified by this Court in its recent ruling. However, for the \nreasons set forth in detail below, the Weinsheimer Declaration fails to sufficiently resolve \nthe factual disputes for purpose of summary judgment.  \nAccordingly, this Court should deny DOJ’s Renewed Motion without prejudice and \nauthorize limited discovery. \n \n \n \n \n2 This Court has not yet ruled on the extent to which DOJ’s remaining redactions and/or \nwithholdings that the Plaintiffs are challenging were appropriate as a matter of law. \nPresumably, that is a matter this Court will address once the dispute over the Pages is \nresolved. \n  2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 53   Filed 09/13/19   Page 6 of 14\nARGUMENT \n \nI.  THE WEINSHEIMER DECLARATION DOES NOT DEMONSTRATE THAT \nDOJ RECEIVED AUTHORIZED INSTRUCTIONS THAT THE ORDER HAD \nBEEN RESCINDED OR OTHERWISE POSTPONED AS A MATTER OF \nLAW \n \nThe Order could not have been clearer in its instructions, and bears repeating it in its \nentirety if only for the sake of factual accuracy. \nAt the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of \ntransparency, the President has directed the Office of the Director of \nNational Intelligence and the Department of Justice (including the FBI) to \nprovide for the immediate declassification of the following materials: (1) \npages 10-12 and 17-34 of the June 2017 application to the FISA court in \nthe matter of Carter W. Page; (2) all FBI reports of interviews with Bruce \nG. Ohr prepared in connection with the Russia investigation; and (3) all \nFBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all Carter Page \nFISA applications. \n \nIn addition, President Donald J. Trump has directed the Department of \nJustice (including the FBI) to publicly release all text messages relating to \nthe Russia investigation, without redaction, of James Comey, Andrew \nMcCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr. \n \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-34/  \n(last accessed September 3, 2019)(emphasis added). \nThis Court previously stated that, contrary to claims by DOJ, “…[i]t would appear \nthat the President did make ‘his intentions clear … to declassify information.’”  \nSee The James Madison Project, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126575 at *5. Nowhere within \nthe four corners of the Weinsheimer Declaration, however, does the Government ever \naddress whether the Order was treated by DOJ as a declassification order from the outset. \nThe Weinsheimer Declaration instead makes three points: (a) that DOJ did not receive \nwhat it views to be a “declassification order” separate from the Order itself; (b) that in \nsubsequent discussions with unidentified White House personnel DOJ was purportedly \n  3 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 53   Filed 09/13/19   Page 7 of 14\ninformed that there was no order requiring “immediate declassification or disclosure” of \nthe Pages; and (c) that DOJ did not receive a separate “declassification order” in its \nmeeting with President Trump. See Dkt. #52-1 at ¶¶4-5. \nThe Weinsheimer Declaration quite simply fails to address the initial threshold \nquestion raised by this Court in its previous ruling, namely what basis in law DOJ had for \ncontending the Order was anything other than a declassification order. See The James \nMadison Project, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126575 at *4-*5. The Weinsheimer Declaration \npoints to no citation or source of authority demonstrating why a separate document \ndistinct from the Order itself was required for purposes of concluding that a \n“declassification order” had been issued and required implementation. Declaration of \nBradley P. Moss at ¶9 (dated September 13, 2019)(“Moss Decl.”), attached as  \nExhibit “1”. Ironically, it is the Government that has previously argued successfully that \nPresident Trump’s mere tweets, to say nothing of an official White House press release \nfrom the president, can carry the force of law. See United States v. Valencia, 2018 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 200564, *18 (W.D. Tex. Nov. 27, 2018)(concluding that nothing beyond \nPresident’s tweets was needed to legally demonstrate Matthew Whitaker had been \nappointed by President Trump as acting Attorney General of United States in compliance \nwith legal restrictions imposed by 5 U.S.C. § 3346).  \nTherefore, from the outset, the Plaintiffs respectfully submit DOJ failed to provide \nthis Court with clarity regarding why the Order, in and of itself, does not qualify as a \ndeclassification order as a matter of law. Consequently, it is the Plaintiffs’ position that, \nas a matter of law, the Order qualified as a declassification order.  \n \n  4\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 53   Filed 09/13/19   Page 8 of 14\nTo explain why the Order was not implemented, the Weinsheimer Declaration \nvaguely references consultations with unidentified White House personnel. Dkt. #52-1 at \n¶5. The description of those consultations leaves much to be desired. The Weinsheimer \nDeclaration does not provide this Court with any substantive insight into the identities \nand/or positions of the White House personnel, including to what extent those individuals \nprovided DOJ with any basis to conclude they (the White House personnel) had been \ndelegated the authority to convey that the Order did not require immediate \nimplementation. Moss Decl. at ¶10.  \nThis lack of clarity is particularly important in the present case. This was not a mere \nincident of subordinate Executive Branch personnel working to flesh out broad policy \nguidance from the President of the United States. The Order was a declassification order \nfrom no less an authority than President Trump himself directing the relevant agencies to \nimmediately declassify the Pages (among other things). Absent a proper delegation of \nauthority from President Trump (or his designee), the White House personnel referenced \nin the Weinsheimer Declaration lacked any basis to convey to DOJ that the Order did not \nrequire immediate implementation. To conclude otherwise would be to accept an \nexplanation from the Government that unidentified bureaucratic officials in the White \nHouse overrode the Constitutional authority of President Trump to order the immediate \ndeclassification of classified information. The Plaintiffs are willing to assume for the \nmoment the Government is not seriously suggesting to this Court that the unidentified \nWhite House officials broke the law and defied President Trump’s Article II powers. \n \n  5 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 53   Filed 09/13/19   Page 9 of 14\nBut even if these unidentified individual White House personnel held some type of \ndelegation of authority from President Trump, the Weinsheimer Declaration still \nunequivocally fails to explain what that delegation was or if the relevant DOJ officials \never asked the White House personnel for relevant documentation or descriptions of the \ndelegation of authority. Moss Decl. at ¶10. Again, the Plaintiffs are forced to reiterate the \nconstitutional sensitivity of the discussions referenced in the Weinsheimer Declaration, \nand why this was not just another routine meeting of government officials in which their \nrespective authority was not of particular importance. This was a meeting to coordinate \nthe implementation of a declassification order issued by the Commander in Chief \nhimself. If the White House personnel were going to inform DOJ personnel the Order did \nnot require what it clearly stated was required –  namely, the immediate declassification \nof the Pages – then logic and the presumption of regularity, see Sussman v. United States \nMarshals Serv., 494 F.3d 1106, 1117 (D.C. Cir. 2007), would suggest DOJ personnel \nasked for an explanation of the White House personnel’s respective authority to \ncontravene the Order and the White House personnel provided DOJ with something more \nsubstantive than their stated word. Moss Decl. at ¶11. \nTo permit anything less than clarification from the Government regarding those \ndiscrepancies would be to conclude that what the Weinsheimer Declaration describes is \nunidentified bureaucrats contravening and obstructing the Article II authority of the \npresident of the United States with respect to declassification of the Pages. Moss Decl. at \n¶11. That is a factual scenario this Court should not sanction.  \n \n  6\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 53   Filed 09/13/19   Page 10 of 14\nThe follow up question obviously becomes how this Court should require such \nclarification. The Plaintiffs respectfully submit the present case satisfies the \ncircumstances of those rare FOIA cases in which limited discovery is appropriate due to \nthe absence of good faith by the Government in the sufficiency of its sworn pleadings \npresented to this Court, see Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. Nat’l Indian \nGaming Comm’n, 467 F. Supp. 2d 50, 56 (D.D.C. 2006)(identifying material conflict in \nagency affidavits as exception to rule that such affidavits are accorded presumption of \ngood faith), as well as evidence of misconduct by the government in its response.  \nSee Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of State, 344 F. Supp. 3d 77, 80 (D.D.C. 2018) \n(authorizing discovery with respect to manner in which State Department and former \nSecretary of State Clinton’s personal staff handled maintenance of records on a personal \ne-mail server). \nThe Government has already had not one but two separate occasions in which to \nrespond to a specific challenge to its description of the impact of the Order. The Plaintiffs \ndirectly challenged the Government’s description in their original opposition to DOJ’s \nMotion for Summary Judgment, see Dkt. #42 at *8-*9, but the Government declined to \nsupplement their original sworn declarations with anything beyond legal arguments in a \nreply brief, see Dkt. #43. This Court specifically highlighted the lack of supplemental \nsworn declarations in its ruling denying DOJ’s previous motion for summary judgment. \nSee The James Madison Project, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126575 at *4, *7. To remedy \nthat deficiency, the Government provided the Weinsheimer Declaration: however, for the \nreasons just outlined above, supra at 4-6, that supplemental pleading still does not satisfy \nthe Government’s legal burden. Instead, the Weinsheimer Declaration paints a picture of \n  7 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 53   Filed 09/13/19   Page 11 of 14\nwhat at best can only be described as bureaucratic confusion regarding the legal \nimplications of the Order upon its issuance, and which at worst memorializes unidentified \nbureaucrats obstructing the constitutional authority of the president of the United States.  \nThe Plaintiffs respectfully submit that the Government should not be permitted to \ndelay this proceeding further in order to formulate yet another sworn declaration to once \nagain provide only a slightly greater amount of detail. Instead, the sensitivities of this \nlegal issue and the public interest in ensuring that procedures for implementing \ndeclassification orders direct from the President of the United States warrants authorizing \nlimited discovery by the Plaintiffs. Moss Decl. at ¶15. \nThis discovery need not be overly invasive nor extensive, and more than likely will \nbe confined to a narrow set of document production requests and depositions. \nSpecifically, the Plaintiffs propose the following: \n1)  The release of any records provided to DOJ at the meetings referenced in the \nWeinsheimer Declaration that memorialized instructions, guidance or directions \nfrom President Trump (or his designee) to the unidentified White House \npersonnel regarding their authority to convey that the Order did not have to be \nimplemented; and/or \n \n2)  Depositions of relevant DOJ personnel who attended the meetings referenced in \nthe Weinsheimer Declaration for the strict purpose of addressing the threshold \nquestion of the extent to which DOJ confirmed the White House personnel had \nthe lawful authority to convey the instructions that ran contrary to the mandate of \nthe Order. \n \nMoss Decl. at ¶16.3 \n \n3 It is plausible there may be issues of classification and privilege that will have to be \naddressed to protect legitimate interests of the U.S. Government. See Judicial Watch, Inc. \nv. Dep’t of Commerce, 34 F. Supp. 2d 28, 41 (D.D.C. 1998)(appointing magistrate judge \nto closely supervise discovery). However, this discovery is not seeking the substantive \ncontents of the discussions referenced in the Weinsheimer Declaration but rather only \nconfirmation that the relevant officials in the discussions had the authority to provide \nguidance that contradicted the requirements of the Order regarding declassification. \n  8 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 53   Filed 09/13/19   Page 12 of 14\nAbsent this clarification through discovery, a genuine issue of material fact remains \nin dispute regarding the status of the Order that precludes granting summary judgment to \nthe Government.  \nII. THERE REMAINS A GENUINE ISSUE OF MATERIAL FACT IN DISPUTE \nREGARDING THE ABILITY OF DOJ TO ASSERT OTHER EXEMPTIONS \nIN ORDER TO JUSTIFY WITHHOLDING THE PAGES \n \nIn its previous ruling, this Court also identified the need for the Government to \nprovide greater clarity (through a sworn declaration) with respect to the basis or bases \nupon which it was relying upon other exemptions – Exemption 3, Exemption 7(D) and  \nExemption 7(E) – to continue withholding the Pages (whether in whole or in part) even if \nthe Order was construed as nullifying the Exemption 1 invocation. See The James \nMadison Project, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126575 at *8. \nThe Weinsheimer Declaration, once again, simply does not satisfy that requirement in \nany way, shape or form. The sole reference to the issue is the assertion that  \nMr. Weinsheimer is not aware of any “order, guidance, policy or other facts” that prevent \nDOJ from invoking other exemptions. See Dkt. #52-1 at ¶5. That was not the question \nposed to DOJ by this Court, however: the ambiguity laid bare by the Order was why this \nCourt should view the Order’s requirement for immediate declassification of the Pages as \nsimultaneously not actually demanding release of the Pages subsequent to that \ndeclassification. See The James Madison Project, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126575 at *8. \nThe Weinsheimer Declaration’s statement does not clear up that ambiguity, and the \nburden is on DOJ (as the movant party) to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact in dispute. See Holcomb v. Powell, 433 F.3d 889, 895 (D.C. Cir. 2006). \n  9 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 53   Filed 09/13/19   Page 13 of 14\nThe inclusion of “legal spin” by DOJ on possible alternative explanations for why the \nOrder would not necessarily have been meant to require public release of the Pages,  \nsee Dkt. #52 at *5, cannot serve as a substitute for factual explanations in a sworn \ndeclaration, as this Court has already warned the Government once before in this \nlitigation. See The James Madison Project, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126575 at *4. Were \nDOJ personnel informed by the White House (or President Trump directly) that the \ndeclassification of the Pages was only designed to facilitate broader information sharing \nwithin the Executive Branch, with Congress, and with other governmental entities and \npartners? Moss Decl. at ¶13. That certainly may be the case, but the Weinsheimer \nDeclaration is silent on the issue.  \n  This continued discrepancy represents a genuine issue of material fact that needs to \nbe clarified, preferably through the limited discovery outlined above, before this Court \ncan render a determination on summary judgment.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, DOJ’s Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment should be \ndenied without prejudice and this Court should authorize limited discovery. \n  10 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 53   Filed 09/13/19   Page 14 of 14\nDate: September 13, 2019 \n            Respectfully submitted, \n \n                 /s/ \n            ________________________ \nBradley P.

I have been litigating cases \ninvolving the federal government, including with respect to the Freedom of Information \nAct (“FOIA”), since 2007. I also actively represent individuals associated with or within \nthe intelligence, law enforcement or military communities in administrative proceedings. \nBoth Mr. Zaid and I hold U.S. Government security clearances, granted by the \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 53-1   Filed 09/13/19   Page 3 of 8\n \nDepartment of Justice, for the purpose of representing specific clients, some of whose \naffiliation to the U.S. Government is a classified fact. \n  3.  In support of its Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment (“Motion”),  \nsee Dkt. #52 (filed August 30, 2019), the defendant Department of Justice (“DOJ”) \nprovided a sworn declaration from G. Bradley Weinsheimer (“Weinsheimer \nDeclaration”) to respond to the mandate set forth in this Court’s memorandum opinion, \nissued on July 30, 2019. See Dkt. #52-1 (filed August 30, 2019). For the reasons outlined \nbelow, the Weinsheimer Declaration simply fails to satisfy the factual disputes identified \nby this Court. \n  The Declassification Order \n  4.  On September 17, 2018, President Donald J. Trump (“President Trump”) \nexercised his constitutional authority to order the immediate declassification of twenty-\none specific pages (“the Pages”) from the 412-page production of FISA records released \nin this litigation and that relate to Carter W. Page (“Mr. Page)”. https://www.white \nhouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-34/ (last accessed September \n10, 2019). The Pages are derived from the June 2017 FISC application regarding  \nMr. Page. President Trump’s order was memorialized in a White House press release  \n(the “Order”). \n  5.  President Trump did issue a two-part tweet on September 21, 2018, in which he \nstated that the Department of Justice had agreed to release an unspecified number of \ndocuments subject to the Order. President Trump further noted, however, that due to \nconcerns raised about the “Russia probe” and by unidentified “Allies”, he was asking the \nInspector General (“OIG”) to review an unspecified set of documents on an expedited \n2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 53-1   Filed 09/13/19   Page 4 of 8\n \nbasis. https://www.vox.com/2018/9/21/17886720/trump-russia-declassification-order-\ntweets-mueller (last accessed September 10, 2019).  \n  6.  There is no evidence in the written record demonstrating that the documents at \nissue in the two-part tweet on September 21, 2018, overlap with the Pages subject to the \nOrder.  \n  7.  In the Weinsheimer Declaration, DOJ provided some more details about what \ntranspired “behind the scenes” in the aftermath of the issuance of the Order. The \nWeinsheimer Declaration states that unidentified White House officials met with \nunidentified DOJ officials (and Mr. Weinsheimer) regarding the impact of the Order. The \nWeinsheimer Declaration claims that White House personnel informed DOJ “there was \nno order requiring immediate declassification or disclosure of [the Carter Page \ndocuments].” See Dkt. #52-1 at ¶5. The Weinsheimer Declaration further claims that no \nseparate “declassification order” was ever received by DOJ independent of the Order \nitself. \n  8.  The Weinsheimer Declaration does not provide any factual or legal basis, \nhowever, for concluding that the consultations described should be construed as \noverruling or otherwise nullifying the declassifying impact of the Order.  \n  9.  First, the Weinsheimer Declaration fails to address why the Order, on its own, \ndoes not qualify as a declassification order. The text of the Order was clear and \nunequivocal in expressing the order from President Trump that the Pages be immediately \ndeclassified. The Government at no point, in either the Weinsheimer Declaration or in its \nMotion, provides any authoritative basis to conclude that the Order does not, as a matter \nof law, qualify as a declassification order. The Government certainly does not explain on \n3 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 53-1   Filed 09/13/19   Page 5 of 8\n \nwhat basis it believes a separate “declassification order” is required and has to be \nsubmitted to DOJ independent of the issuance of the Order. It certainly may be the case \nthat has been routinely done in the past for purposes of documentation but that it may be \na common practice does not render it legally obligatory.   \n  10. Even if the Government could rectify that threshold question, the Weinsheimer \nDeclaration provides no information regarding the authority of the White House \npersonnel to convey to DOJ that the Order was not a declassification order and/or that \nthere was no requirement for immediate declassification. Did President Trump delegate \nauthority to the White House officials to state that the Order did not, in fact, have to be \nimplemented (at least not immediately)? Did DOJ secure clarification from White House \npersonnel regarding any such delegation of authority, or did they merely take their word \nfor it?  \n  11. These are not trivial questions. To the contrary, they strike at the heart of one of \nthe legal questions still unresolved in the present case, namely the authority of \nbureaucrats in the White House and the DOJ to take actions that appear to conflict with \nthe clear instructions of the Commander in Chief. It is entirely possible that President \nTrump (or his authorized designee) did in fact delegate necessary authority to the White \nHouse officials in question, and that authority was properly explained to DOJ. Until such \ntime, however, as the Government verifies that in a sworn declaration, there remains a \ngenuine issue of material fact in dispute regarding the legal basis for concluding the \nOrder was nullified or otherwise postponed.  \n \n \n4 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 53-1   Filed 09/13/19   Page 6 of 8\n \n  The Other Exemptions Invoked \n  12. The Weinsheimer Declaration separately tries to address this Court’s question \nregarding the Government’s ability to invoke Exemption 3 Exemption 7(C),  \nExemption 7(D) and Exemption 7(E) to withhold some or all of the Pages. See Dkt. #52-\n1 at ¶5. Once again, the Weinsheimer Declaration fails to live up to the standard set forth \nin the case law, to say nothing of that set by this Court. \n  13. The Weinsheimer Declaration simply provides nothing in the way of factual \ninformation to resolve why this Court should construe the Order’s declassification \nrequirement as not also indicating that the Pages should be released subsequent to that \ndeclassification. Although the Government posits some plausible explanations in their \nMotion, see Dkt. #52 at *5, those explanations are noticeably absent from the \nWeinsheimer Declaration itself. This Court already made clear once before the need for \nthe Government to resolve these factual disputes in sworn declarations, not in legal \npleadings, and the Weinsheimer Declaration’s factual deficiencies do not satisfy that \nburden. \n  Limited Discovery \n  14. The Plaintiffs respectfully submit that limited discovery, consisting most likely of \ndocument production and depositions, is warranted at this juncture. The Government has \nalready had two bites at the proverbial apple to resolve these factual disputes through the \nsubmission of sworn declarations. This Court rejected the Government’s first attempt \nand, for the reasons outlined above, the Plaintiffs submit that the Government still has not \nsufficiently corrected the deficiencies previously identified by this Court. With due \nrespect, the Government should not be afforded a third chance. \n5 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 53-1   Filed 09/13/19   Page 7 of 8\n \n  15. The Plaintiffs particularly wish to reiterate the intense public interest in the \ninformation at issue in the present case. The disclosure by DOJ of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”) applications targeting Mr. Page was \nunprecedented and was due specifically to the initiation of the present case and similar \nFOIA cases brought by other FOIA plaintiffs. Media interest in the debate over \ndeclassification of the remaining portions of the FISA applications remains ongoing, \nincluding with remarks by President Trump himself indicating he want to ultimately see \nmuch (if not all) of the documentation declassified and released. https://www.washington \nexaminer.com/news/trump-says-everything-will-be-declassified (last accessed September \n12, 2019). That the Plaintiffs are being forced to pry this information out of the \nGovernment bit by bit is contrary to the spirit and purpose of the FOIA.  \n  16. The scope of the anticipated discovery need not be extensive. The Plaintiffs \nwould particularly seek to secure the following, which could afford this Court sufficient \ninformation to render a determination with prejudice. \n1)  Records provided to DOJ at the meetings referenced in the Weinsheimer \nDeclaration that memorialized instructions, guidance or directions from President \nTrump (or his designee) to the unidentified White House personnel regarding \ntheir authority to convey to DOJ that the Order did not have to be implemented;  \n \n2)  Depositions of the relevant DOJ personnel who attended the meetings referenced \nin the Weinsheimer Declaration for the strict purpose of addressing the threshold \nquestion of the extent to which DOJ confirmed the White House personnel had \nthe lawful authority to convey the instructions that ran contrary to the mandate of \nthe Order. \n \n  17. It is entirely possible that the information sought in that discovery would \nultimately demonstrate as a matter of fact and law that the Government is entitled to \nsummary judgment. However, absent that information, there remain genuine issues of \nmaterial fact in dispute that prohibit this Court from ruling in the Government’s favor. \n6 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 53-1   Filed 09/13/19   Page 8 of 8\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 53-2   Filed 09/13/19   Page 1 of 2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n   \n              * \nTHE JAMES MADISON PROJECT,  * \net al.,             * \n              * \n  Plaintiffs,          * \n              *     \n    v.          *    Civil Action No. 17-597 (APM) \n              * \nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,    *   \n              * \n  Defendant.         * \n              * \n*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * \nRESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS  \nIN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT’S RENEWED MOTION  \nFOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n  Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1 (h), the plaintiffs The James Madison Project and  \nBrad Heath (referred to jointly as “Plaintiffs”) respectfully respond to the defendant \nDepartment of Justice’s Statement of Material Facts in Support of Defendant’s Renewed \nMotion for Summary Judgment.  \n  40.

The underlying FOIA requests specifically \nsought copies of any orders issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n(“FISC”) authorizing surveillance of President Donald J. Trump (“President Trump”), his \npresidential campaign, his private company, or his associates, as well as any relevant \napplications for orders submitted to the FISC and minimization procedures issued by the \nFISC.  \nPresently before this Court for consideration is a Motion for Summary Judgment \n(“Motion”) filed by the DOJ, as well as the Plaintiffs’ Cross-Motion for Summary \nJudgment (“Cross-Motion”).  \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 18-1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 5 of 25\nFor the reasons set forth in detail below, this Court should grant the Plaintiffs’  \nCross-Motion and deny the DOJ’s Motion in its entirety.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nThe factual and procedural background of this proceeding was largely set forth in two \ndocuments: the First Amended Complaint, see Dkt. #5 at ¶¶7-32 (filed April 15, 2017), \nand the Statement of Material Facts in Support of Defendant’s Motion for Summary \nJudgment, see Dkt. #13 (filed July 14, 2017)(“Statement of Material Facts”).  \nIn the interest of not repeating information already set forth before this Court in \nDOJ’s Statement of Material Facts, the Plaintiffs incorporate that document herein by \nreference. However, the Plaintiffs are only incorporating the factual statements in relation \nto paragraphs 1-4, and only to the extent that they do not constitute legal \ncharacterizations and conclusions regarding the appropriateness of DOJ’s invocations of \nparticular FOIA exemptions. \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n \nSummary judgment pursuant to FRCP 56 should be awarded to a movant if “the \npleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that \nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). In evaluating the appropriateness of \nsummary judgment, the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the \nnon-moving party, Holcomb v. Powell, 433 F.3d 889, 895 (D.C. Cir. 2006), accepting the \nnon-moving party’s evidence as true and drawing “all justifiable inferences” in the \nnonmoving party’s favor. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986). \n  2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 18-1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 6 of 25\nHowever, the Court need not rely on any “conclusory allegations unsupported by factual \ndata,” Pub. Citizen Health Research Group v. FDA, 185 F.3d 898, 908 (D.C. Cir. 1999) \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted), and should only find that “there is a \ngenuine issue for trial” where “there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party \nfor a jury to return a verdict for that party.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249 (citation omitted). \nThe mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat \nsummary judgment; the requirement is that there is no genuine issue of material fact. \nSee Holcomb, 433 F.3d at 895 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). A fact is \n“material” if a dispute over it might affect the outcome of a suit under governing law; \nfactual disputes that are “irrelevant or unnecessary” do not affect the summary judgment \ndetermination. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. An issue is “genuine” if “the evidence is such \nthat a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Id.  \nII. THE PLAINTIFFS ARE ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT WITH \nRESPECT TO THE APPROPRIATENESS OF DOJ’S GLOMAR RESPONSES \nAS A MATTER OF LAW \n \nAgencies can, in limited circumstances, refuse to confirm or deny the existence or \nnon-existence of records, better known as a “Glomar response”. See Wolf v. CIA,  \n473 F.3d 370, 374 (D.C. Cir. 2007); see also Roth v. Dep’t of Justice, 642 F.3d 1161, \n1178 (D.C. Cir. 2011)(Glomar response permitted only when confirming or denying \nwould itself cause harm cognizable under a FOIA exemption). When an agency has \nofficially acknowledged otherwise exempt information through prior disclosure, the \ndisclosure of the information may be compelled notwithstanding the agency’s otherwise \nvalid exemption claim. See Fitzgibbon v. CIA, 911 F.2d 755, 765 (D.C. Cir. 1990). \n  3 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 18-1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 7 of 25\n In the context of a Glomar response, the evidentiary burden that falls upon a plaintiff \nto establish official acknowledgment is merely to demonstrate that agency has already \ndisclosed the fact of the existence or non-existence of responsive records. See Wolf,  \n473 F.3d at 379-380. It is not required, at least in terms of countering a Glomar response, \nfor the plaintiff to demonstrate that the contents of particular records have actually been \nofficially disclosed. See Marino v. DEA, 685 F.3d 1076, 1082 (D.C. Cir. 2012). \nThe D.C. Circuit’s analysis and reasoning in ACLU v. CIA, 710 F.3d 422  \n(D.C. Cir. 2013), is particularly instructive and informative. In ACLU, the Circuit \nrejected a Glomar response invoked by CIA with respect to whether it had any records \nreflecting involvement or interest in drone strikes. Id. at 432. In explaining its’ reasoning, \nthe Circuit stated the following: \nAlthough these statements do not acknowledge that the CIA itself operates \ndrones, they leave no doubt that some U.S. agency does. The CIA does not \ndispute that these statements qualify as official acknowledgments of at \nleast that much. To the contrary, it concedes that ‘Mr. Brennan officially \nacknowledged that the United States conducts drone strikes,’ albeit \nwithout ‘reveal[ing] whether the CIA (as opposed to another federal entity \nsuch as the Department of Defense) is involved in these drone strikes.’ \n \nGiven these official acknowledgments that the United States has \nparticipated in drone strikes, it is neither logical nor plausible for the CIA \nto maintain that it would reveal anything not already in the public domain \nto say that the Agency at least has an intelligence interest in such strikes. \nThe defendant is, after all, the Central Intelligence Agency. And it strains \ncredulity to suggest that an agency charged with gathering intelligence \naffecting the national security does not have an ‘intelligence interest’ in \ndrone strikes, even if that agency does not operate the drones itself. \n \nId. at 429-30 (emphasis added)(internal citations omitted). \nIn its Motion, DOJ devoted ten pages to outlining the various arguments why  \nGlomar responses relying upon FOIA Exemptions 1, 3, 7(A) and 7(E) were appropriate. \nSee Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant’s Motion for \n  4 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 18-1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 8 of 25\nSummary Judgment at *7-*16 (Dkt. #13)(filed July 14, 2017)(“Def’s Memo”). The crux \nof the present dispute, however, concerns whether there have been public, official \ndisclosures of information that render those Glomar responses inappropriate as a matter \nof law. DOJ’s Motion spent only four pages addressing this issue, two of which involved \nmerely citing the relevant case law. See id. at *17-*20. DOJ’s Motion too cavalierly \nglosses over the public, official disclosures of information that are relevant to the present \ncase. Indeed, absent those public, official disclosures of information, it borders on \naxiomatic that the Plaintiffs would not have brought this lawsuit.  \nIn this Cross-Motion, the Plaintiffs outline in extensive, clarifying detail the factual \nbases upon which this Court can rely in concluding there is no genuine issue of material \nfact in dispute that public, official disclosures of information have rendered DOJ’s \ninvocation of Glomar responses improper as a matter of law. This Court should further \norder DOJ to conduct searches for records responsive to the Plaintiffs’ requests. Whether \napplicable FOIA exemptions will apply to justify DOJ’s substantive withholdings is an \nissue to be addressed later. \nA.  The Information That Has Been Disclosed \n \n1.  Disclosures made by President Trump and the White House \nPresident Trump, as well as former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (“Mr. \nSpicer”), made several official disclosures of information that are relevant to this Court’s \nanalysis. The President, in particular, has publicly and officially disclosed on several \noccasions that he is not under investigation, including that he has been officially informed \nhe is not under investigation: \n  5 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 18-1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 9 of 25\n(1) In a letter, dated May 9, 2017, terminating the employment of  \nDirector Comey, President Trump stated that former FBI Director \nJames Comey (“Director Comey”) had informed him on three separate \noccasions that he (President Trump) was not under investigation,  \nsee https://www.usatoday.com/story/ news/politics/onpolitics/2017/ \n05/09/full-text-trump-letter-comey-firing/101491982/ (last accessed \nAugust 2, 2017); \n \n(2) On May 11, 2017, in an interview with NBC News, President Trump \ndisclosed that he spoke with Director Comey once over dinner, and \ntwice by phone, and that Director Comey informed President Trump \nthat he (President Trump) was not under investigation, see \nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-reveals-he-asked-\ncomey-whether-he-was-under-investigation-n757821 (last accessed \nAugust 2, 2017); and, \n \n(3) On July 19, 2017, in an interview with The New York Times, \nPresident Trump denied that he is under investigation,  \nsee https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/us/politics/trump-interview-\nsessions-russia.html?action=Click&contentCollection=BreakingNews \n&contentID=65596145 &pgtype=article&_r=0 (last accessed  \nJuly 27, 2017). \n \nMore specific to the possibility of the existence of orders issued by the FISC, \nPresident Trump made public, official disclosures on March 4, 2017, in which he claimed \nthat former President Barack Obama (“President Obama”) had President Trump’s “wires \ntapped” in Trump Tower, that President Obama’s “wire tapping” of President Trump had \nbeen “turned down by court earlier”, and particularly that President Obama had been \n“tapping” President Trump’s phones in October 2016. See Def’s Memo at *19-*20. \nOn March 6, 2017, Mr. Spicer answered the initial set of questions that \nunderstandably arose in the aftermath of President Trump’s March 4, 2017, tweets. \nQ:    And does he believe it’s a FISA warrant. Is it some other -- of surveillance? \n \nMR. SPICER:  It could be FISA. It could be surveillance. There’s no cameras, \nslow it down. \n \nQ:    So he doesn’t know? \n \n  6 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 18-1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 10 of 25\nMR. SPICER:  Look, I think he has made it clear that there are continued reports \nthat have been out there. I’m not going to continue to -- I think the President made \nit clear yesterday that he wants Congress to go in and look at this. I think there is \nsubstantial reporting out there from individuals and from sources. \n \nQ:    But what sources -- \n \nMR. SPICER:  Okay. Sara, you’re not on camera. You don’t need to jump in.  \nWe’ll get to your question in turn. Hold on.   \n \nThe answer is, is that the President has made it clear he wants Congress to look \ninto this. And we’re encouraging the House and Senate intelligence committees to \nuse their oversight capabilities and look into this. \n \nJohn Gizzi. \n \nQ:    Sean, does he not know whether -- what kind of surveillance it was? \n \nMR. SPICER:  Well, I think that there’s no question that something happened.  \nThe question is, is it surveillance, is it a wiretap, or whatever. But there’s been \nenough reporting that strongly suggests that something occurred. And I think that \nthat’s why what he has said yesterday is that he wants Congress to look into this.  \nAnd I think that there is enough out there now that makes one wonder how some \nof this happened without the existence of surveillance \n \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/06/press-gaggle-press-secretary-\nsean-spicer (last accessed August 15, 2017)(emphasis added). \nOn March 13, 2017, Mr. Spicer clarified that President Trump’s comments were \nmade in the context of media reports circulating at the time concerning possible \nsurveillance authorized by the Obama Administration that implicated President Trump \nand/or his associates. https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/13/press-\nbriefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-3132017-22 (last accessed August 14, 2017) \n(“He said they were in quotes, [President Trump] was referring to surveillance overall. \nIt’s something that had been referred to in other reports.”).  \n  7 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 18-1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 11 of 25\nOn March 15, 2017, in an interview with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson,  \nPresident Trump specifically explained that he wrote the March 4, 2017, tweets in the \ncontext of having read an article in The New York Times and watching a Fox News \nsegment concerning allegations of “wiretapping” and surveillance. http://www.foxnews. \ncom/politics/2017/03/15/trump-calls-tax-return-leak-illegal-thinks-msnbc-report-is-\ndisgrace.html (last accessed August 15, 2017); https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-\ninterview-fox-march-15-2017 (last accessed August 15, 2017). \nOn March 16, 2017, Mr. Spicer elaborated in detail on the various media reports that \nhad addressed the alleged surveillance regarding which President Trump had referenced \nin his March 15, 2017, interview, and that provided context for President Trump’s \noriginal claims in the March 4, 2017, tweets. The Plaintiffs beg this Court’s indulgence in \nproviding such a lengthy quote, but it is necessary in order to provide a comprehensive \ndescription of the information regarding which Mr. Spicer stated was being considered by \nPresident Trump. \nIf you look at what The New York Times reported on January 12th, 2017, \nthey said, “In its final days, the Obama administration has expanded the \npower of the National Security Agency to share globally intercepted \npersonal communications with the government’s 16 other intelligence \nagencies before applying privacy protections.  The new rules significantly \nrelax longstanding limits on what the NSA may do with the information \ngathered by its most powerful surveillance operation, which are largely \nunregulated by wiretapping laws.” \n \nWhen Sara Carter reported that “by the start of the new year, it brought \nwith it unexpected politicizing of the intelligence gathered in secret.  \nSeparately, the Obama administration amended a longstanding executive \norder, allowing information intercepted through FISA warrants or by the \nNational Security Agency to be shared by a wider audience and 16 \ngovernment agencies as Obama was leave office, intelligence normally \nreserved for just a handful of intelligence leaders was spread throughout \nbriefings to scores of workers, and soon leaks began appearing in news \n  8 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 18-1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 12 of 25\nmedia office organizations, often in stories lacking context of how \nnational security investigations are actually concluded.” \n \nOn March 3rd, Fox News chief anchor Bret Baier said that the following: \n“There was a report in June 2016 -- a FISA request by the Obama \nadministration -- Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court -- to monitor \ncommunications involving Donald Trump and several other campaign \nofficials.  Then they got turned down.  Then in October, then they renewed \nit and did a startup wiretap at Trump Tower with some computer and \nRussian banks.”  Baier continues, “A June FISA request that foreign \nintelligence surveillance courts gets shot down.  A judge says” -- hold -- \nJonathan, I’m going to -- you can ask -- you can follow up -- “A judge \nsays no-go to monitoring Trump Tower.  They go back in October.  They \ndo get a FISA granted.  This is wiretap going on and a monitoring of \ncomputers that have some ties, they believe, to Russian accounts.  By all \naccounts, they don’t come up with anything in the investigation, but the \ninvestigation continues and we don’t know it. \n \nOn November 11th, 2016, days after the election, Heat Street reported, \n“Two separate sources with links to the counter-intelligence community \nhad confirmed to Heat Street that the FBI sought and was granted a FISA \nwarrant in October, giving counter-surveillance intelligence permission to \nexamine the activities of U.S. persons in Donald Trump’s campaign with \nties to Russia. The first request, which sources say named Trump, was \ndenied back in June.  But the second was drawn more narrowly and \ngranted in October after evidence was presented of a server, possibly \nrelated to the Trump campaign and its alleged links to two banks -- SVB \nbank and Russia’s Alfa-Bank.  Sources suggest that a FISA warrant was \ngranted to look at the full context of related documents that concern U.S. \npersons.  Two separate sources with links to the counter-intelligence \ncommunity have confirmed that the FBI sought and was granted a FISA \nwarrant in October giving counter-intelligence permission to examine the \nactivity of U.S. persons in Donald Trump’s campaign with ties to Russia.” \n \nThey go on: “The FISA warrant was granted in connection with \ninvestigation of suspected activities between the server and two banks.  \nHowever, it is thought that the intelligence community that the warrant \ncovers any U.S. person connected to this U.N. investigation, and thus \ncovers Donald Trump and at least three further men who have either \nformed part of his campaign or acted as media surrogates.” \n \nOn January 19th, the New York Times reported the following: “American \nlaw enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted \ncommunication and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation \nof possible links between Russian officials and associates of President-\nelect Donald J. Trump.  One official said intelligence reports based on \n  9 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 18-1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 13 of 25\nsome of the wiretapped communications have been provided to the White \nHouse.  It is unclear which Russian officials under investigation or what \nparticular conversations caught the attention of American eavesdroppers.  \nThe legal standard for opening these investigations is low. \n \nAndy McCarthy, writing in National Review, suggested: “From three \nreports, from the Guardian, Heat Street and the New York Times, it \nappears the FBI has concerns about a private server in Trump Tower that \nwas connected to one or two Russian banks.  Heat Street describes these \nconcerns as centering on “possible financial and banking offenses.”  This \nis his quote -- “I italicized the word “offenses” because it denotes crimes.  \nOrdinarily, when crimes are suspected, there is a criminal investigation, \nnot a national security investigation.” \n \nWe go on.  Sara Carter from Circa, reporting, “Intelligence professionals \ntell Circa News they were concerned that some of the Russian intelligence \nwas spread through group briefings to a much-larger-than-usual audience \nback in January.  This would have happened during the final days of the \nObama administration when it expanded executive order 12333, which \nallows employees with a “need to know” have further unfettered access to \nraw data stowed by the NSA.  The new rules allowed the NSA to share \n“raw signals intelligence information, including the names of those \ninvolved in phone conversations and emails.  The expansion of the order \nmakes it difficult to narrow in on the leaks and, frankly, it allows too many \npeople access to the raw data, which only used to be available to a select \nfew, said a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity and was \nnot granted to speak on the authority.  Numerous outlets, including the \nNew York Times, have reported on the FBI investigation into Mr. \nTrump’s advisors; BBC, and then McClatchy revealed the existence of a \nmulti-agency working group to coordinate investigations across the thing.   \n \nOn February 14th, the New York Times again refers to phone record and \nintercepted calls -- let me quote them -- “American law enforcement \nintelligence agency intercepted the communications around the same times \nthey were discovering the evidence that Russia was trying to disrupt the \npresidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee, \nthree officials said.   \n \nThe intelligence agencies then thought to learn whether the Trump \ncampaign was colluding with the Russians on hacking or other efforts to \ninfluence the election.  The officials interviewed in recent weeks said that \nso far they have seen no evidence of such cooperation.  The official said \nthat the intercepted communications are not limited to Trump campaign \nofficials and other associates of Mr. Trump.  The call logs and intercepted \ncommunications are part of a larger trove of information that the FBI is \nsifting through. \n  10 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 18-1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 14 of 25\n \nDays later, the New York Times then reports, “In the Obama \nadministration’s last days, some White House officials scrambled to \nspread information about Russian efforts to undermine the presidential \nelection of Donald Trump, connections between the President-elect and \nRussians across the government.  But the increasingly hard-to-escape \nconclusion that in our government -- that individuals in our government \nwere instead trying to undermine the new President by saying, quote -- \nthis is the New York Times again -- “At intelligence agencies, there was a \npush to process as much raw intelligence in a possible analysis to keep the \nreport at relatively low classification levels to ensure a widespread \nreadership across the government.  And in some cases, “among them, \nEuropean allies.”  This allowed the upload of as much information -- \nintelligence as possible to Intellipedia, a secret Wiki used by American \nanalysts to share information.   \n \nSean Hannity went on Fox to say, “But protections which are known as \nminimization procedures have been put in place to protect Americans that \nare not under warrant, American citizens that are caught up in their \nsurveillance.”  And, “By the way, their identities are protected.  Their \nconstitutional rights are protected.  Now, of course, this was not the case \nwith Lieutenant General Flynn, because a transcript of his call was created \nand then given to intelligence officials who then leaked this information, \nwhich is a felony, to the press that printed it.” \n \nLast, on Fox News on March 14th, Judge Andrew Napolitano made the \nfollowing statement.  “Three intelligence sources have informed Fox \nNews that President Obama went outside the chain of command.  He \ndidn’t use the NSA, he didn’t use the CIA, he didn’t use the FBI, and he \ndidn’t use the Department of Justice.  He used GCHQ, what is that?  It’s \nthe initials for the British Intelligence Spying Agency.  So simply, by \nhaving two people saying to them, ‘the President needs transcripts of \nconversations involved in candidate Trump’s conversations involving \nPresident-elect Trump,’ he was able to get it and there’s no American \nfingerprints on this.” \n \nPutting the published accounts and common sense together, this leads to a \nlot. \n \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/16/press-briefing-press-secretary-\nsean-spicer-3162017-25 (last accessed August 15, 2017); see also id. (“I think that there \nhas been a vast amount of reporting, which I just detailed, about activity that was going \n  11 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 18-1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 15 of 25\non in the 2016 election.  There’s no question that there was surveillance techniques used \nthroughout this I think by a variety of outlets that have reported this activity concluded.”) \nIn this lengthy recitation provided by Mr. Spicer, he references media reports in \nwhich the following claims were made and upon which Mr. Spicer was relying to justify \nthe evidentiary basis for President Trump’s March 4, 2017, and March 15, 2017, \nstatements: \n(a) The Obama Administration submitted an application to the FISC for an \norder authorizing surveillance of President Trump and some of his \ncampaign associates, but the FISC denied the application in June 2016, see \nhttps://www.youtube.com /watch?v=WpyidroM9XA (last accessed August \n16, 2017)(Bret Baier interview); https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/ \nfact-checker/wp/2017/03/05/trumps-evidence-for-obama-wiretap-claims-\nrelies-on-sketchy-anonymously-sourced-reports/?utm_term= \n.22e347c0e0c0 (last accessed August 16, 2017)(referencing the details of \nthe original Heat Street article, which is no longer publicly accessible);  \n \n(b) The FISC later approved in October 2016, a separate application \nsubmitted by the Obama Administration and authorized surveillance of \ninformation between Russian bank servers and a server at Trump Tower, \nincluding communications involving associates of President Trump, see \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch ?v=WpyidroM9XA (last accessed August \n16, 2017)(Bret Baier interview); https://www.washingtonpost.com/news \n/fact-checker/wp/2017/03/05/trumps-evidence-for-obama-wiretap-claims-\nrelies-on-sketchy-anonymously-sourced-reports/?utm_term= \n.22e347c0e0c0 (last accessed August 16, 2017)(referencing the details of \nthe original Heat Street article, which is no longer publicly accessible); \nand, \n \n(c) The intercepted communications authorized by the FISC in October 2016 \nconcern financial transactions of investigative interest in the broader \ninquiry into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian \nofficials, and the intelligence reports drafted in reliance upon those \nintercepted communications were provided to the White House, see \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/trump-russia-associates-\ninvestigation.html (last accessed August 16, 2017).  \n \nAlthough these media reports ordinarily would not, on their own, qualify as official \ndisclosures of information, President Trump and Mr. Spicer’s specific reliance upon the \n  12 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 18-1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 16 of 25\ninformation in the media reports – particularly in terms of forming the basis for President \nTrump’s specific claims in his March 4, 2017, tweets – constitute “official \nacknowledgement” of at least those portions of the media reports that overlap with \nPresident Trump’s claims.  \n2.  Disclosures made by Director Comey and Admiral Rogers \nIn the aftermath of President Trump’s March 4, 2017, tweets, there was \nunderstandable interest in securing answers from relevant U.S. Government agencies \nregarding the truth or falsity of the claims. On March 20, 2017, in a hearing before the \nHouse Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, then-Director of the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation, James Comey (“Director Comey”) and Director of the National Security \nAgency, Admiral Mike Rogers (“Admiral Rogers”) were specifically asked about the \nPresident’s claims. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics \n/wp/2017/03/20/full-transcript-fbi-director-james-comey-testifies-on-russian-\ninterference-in-2016-election/?utm_term=.77a224733add (last accessed  \nAugust 15, 2017).  \nDirector Comey stated the following: \nWith respect to the president’s tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at \nhim by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those \ntweets and we have looked carefully inside the FBI. The Department of \nJustice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the \nDepartment of Justice and all its components. The department has no \ninformation that supports those tweets. \n \nId. \nAdmiral Rogers was asked to specifically address Mr. Spicer’s reference to the media \nreport that President Obama had relied upon the GCHQ to “tapp” President Trump and/or \nTrump Tower. Admiral Rogers categorically denied that he had ever requested GCHQ \n  13 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 18-1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 17 of 25\nwiretap President Trump, and stated that he had not seen any evidence that anyone at the \nNSA had engaged in any such activity. Id. \n3.  Other disclosures made \nThere have been separate, non-official disclosures of information that we believe not \nonly are informative but that sufficiently overlap with official disclosures of information \nso as to render them relevant as a matter of law. \nOn March 5, 2017, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (“Director \nClapper”) spoke on the matter of President Trump’s March 4, 2017, tweets with  \nNBC News’ Chuck Todd. \nCHUCK TODD: \n \nLet me start with the President's tweets yesterday, this idea that maybe \nPresident Obama ordered an illegal wiretap of his offices. If something \nlike that happened, would this be something you would be aware of? \n \nJAMES CLAPPER: \n \nI would certainly hope so. I can’t say-- obviously, I’m not, I can’t speak \nofficially anymore. But I will say that, for the part of the national security \napparatus that I oversaw as DNI, there was no such wiretap activity \nmounted against-- the president elect at the time, or as a candidate, or \nagainst his campaign.

In the first press conference, held prior to \nCongressman Nunes briefing President Trump at the White House, Congressman Nunes \nstated that he had confirmed “that on numerous occasions, the intelligence community \nincidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involves in the Trump transition.” \nhttp://www.ajc.com/news/national/read-transcripts-rep-devin-nunes-news-conferences-\nabout-trump-surveillance/NdZ4qQv7uBnjcH9E3HSRPJ/ (last accessed August 15, 2017).  \nIn a second press conference, held in front of the White House, Congressman Nunes \nelaborated further on the context of the information collection: \nNunes: Because what I saw has nothing to do with Russia and nothing to do with \nthe Russia investigation. It has everything to do with surveillance activities, and \nthe President needs to know that these intelligence reports are out there, and I \nhave a duty to tell him that. \n \nReporter: Is it appropriate to be drawing conclusions before it was completed? \n \nNunes: I’m not drawing any conclusions, I’m just telling the President what exists \nin intelligence reports. \n \nReporter: Are the subjects of surveillance under FISA orders? \n \nNunes: It appears so. \n \nId. (emphasis added). \n \n  16 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 18-1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 20 of 25\nThe legal question of whether these disclosures by Director Clapper and \nCongressman Nunes qualify as “official disclosures” is a murky one. The D.C. Circuit \nhas concluded that, for example, disclosures in books written by former government \nofficials do not qualify as “official disclosures” for purposes of FOIA. See Public Citizen \nv. Dep’t of State, 11 F.3d 198, 201-02 (D.C. Cir. 1993); see also Afshar v. Dep’t of State, \n702 F.2d 1125, 1133-34 (D.C. Cir. 1983)(books published by former CIA officials were \nnot tantamount to official executive acknowledgments). The Plaintiffs further concede \nthat statements by former officials, even in Congressional testimony, do not, on their \nown, constitute an official disclosure of information. See Frugone v. CIA, 169 F.3d 772, \n774 (D.C. Cir. 1999); see also Wilson v. CIA, 586 F.3d 171, 186-86 (2d. Cir. 2009) \n(“[T]he law will not infer official disclosure of information classified by the CIA from … \n[s]tatements made by a person not authorized to speak for the Agency.”); Hudson River \nSloop Clearwater, Inc. v. Dep’t of Navy, 891 F.2d 414, 421-22 (2d. Cir. 1989)(sworn \naffidavit submitted by former Navy Admiral did not qualify as official disclosure). \nAbsent official corroborating disclosures of information, the existing case law with \nrespect to “official disclosures” arguably might be viewed as precluding consideration of \nthe disclosures by Director Clapper and Congressman Nunes. However, separate but \nrelated official disclosures of information constitute sufficient corroboration and warrant \nthe conclusion that the remarks by Director Clapper and Congressman Nunes can be \nconsidered by this Court in the context of evaluating the propriety of DOJ’s Glomar \nresponses.  \n \n  17 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 18-1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 21 of 25\nDirector Comey and Admiral Rogers both publicly and officially denied knowledge \nof any information that indicated President Trump’s claim that his “wires” had been \ntapped was accurate. Supra at 13-14. Those official, public statements directly overlap \nwith the public disclosure by Director Clapper during his March 5, 2017, interview, in \nwhich he denied knowledge of any wiretap or surveillance activity mounted against \nPresident Trump and/or his associates, including with respect to a possible FISA \nwarrant(s). The overlap is more than sufficient for the purpose of rendering Director \nClapper’s comments relevant as a matter of law in the context of countering a Glomar \nresponse. \nThose same public, official disclosures of information by Director Comey and \nAdmiral Rogers are separately but similarly relevant in evaluating Congressman Nunes’ \nremarks during his March 23, 2017, press conferences. Although Congressman Nunes’ \nstatements contradict Director Comey and Admiral Rogers on substance – Congressman \nNunes stated that the information he saw indicated the existence of a possible FISA \nwarrant in particular, and surveillance of the Trump transition team in general – it \nnonetheless sufficiently overlaps for the purpose of addressing the appropriateness of a \nGlomar response.  \nB.  There Is More Than Sufficient Evidence Of Public, Official Disclosures Of \nInformation To Conclude That A Glomar Response Is Not Permissible As A \nMatter Of Law \n \nWith due respect to the essence of DOJ’s argument that a Glomar response is \nappropriate, see Def’s Memo at *17-*20, the Government relies upon a misapplication of \nexisting case law. DOJ claims that the Plaintiffs are required to demonstrate the existence \nof public, official disclosures of information that is as specific as the information sought.  \n  18 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 18-1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 22 of 25\nSee id. at *17-*18.  \nIn taking that position, however, DOJ has erroneously applied to a challenge to a \nGlomar response the standard of specificity required only in the context of substantive \nwithholdings and/or redactions of actual responsive records. The D.C. Circuit clarified in \nrulings such as ACLU and Marino that the more exacting standard set forth in Wolf for \ndemonstrating an “official acknowledgment” of specific information within documents \nneed not be met when countering a Glomar response. The Circuit explained in ACLU and \nMarino that it is not necessary for a plaintiff to demonstrate that the specific content of \nthe records have been officially disclosed, but rather only that the existence or non-\nexistence of the records has been officially acknowledged. See supra at 4; see also Smith \nv. CIA, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47230, *10 (D.D.C. Mar. 30, 2017)(“The match between \nPlaintiff’s request and President Obama’s statement, although the statement did not \nconsist of the specific words ‘CIA’ of ‘budget line items’, is as close as the match in \nACLU v. CIA.”). \nThe following from ACLU is prescient: \nThe Glomar doctrine is in large measure a judicial construct, an \ninterpretation of FOIA exemptions that flows from their purpose rather \nthan their express language. In this case, the CIA asked the courts to \nstretch that doctrine too far -- to give their imprimatur to a fiction of \ndeniability that no reasonable person would regard as plausible. “There \ncomes a point where . . . Court[s] should not be ignorant as judges of what \n[they] know as men\" and women. Watts v. Indiana, 338 U.S. 49, 52, 69 S. \nCt. 1347, 93 L. Ed. 1801 (1949)(opinion of Frankfurter, J.). \n \nACLU, 710 F.3d at 431. \nAs in ACLU, permitting the fiction of deniability with respect to the existence or non-\nexistence of records responsive to Plaintiffs’ requests simply stretches the feasibility of a \nGlomar response beyond acceptable limits. It is neither logical nor plausible that \n  19 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 18-1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 23 of 25\ndisclosure of the existence or non-existence of FISA orders, applications for FISA orders, \nand/or applicable minimization procedures would reveal anything not already placed in \nthe public domain by way of official disclosures (due in no small part to the calculated \ndisclosures of President Trump and Mr. Spicer).  \nTo summarize, the following points have been officially disclosed: \na)  President Trump is not and has not been personally under investigation,  \nsupra at 5-6;  \n \nb)  President Trump stated on March 4, 2017, that he “just found out” \nPresident Obama had his “wires tapped”, that President Obama \nspecifically was tapping his phones in October 2016, and that President \nObama had been “turned down by court earlier” in getting authorization to \n“tapp” President Trump’s “wires” or phones, supra at 6; \n \nc)  Mr. Spicer later incorporated by reference during press briefings on March \n6, 2017, March 13, 2017, and March 16, 2017, , and President Trump \nincorporated by reference during his March 15, 2017, interview, media \nreports indicating that an application for a FISA warrant had been denied \nin June 2016, that a separate application had been approved in October \n2016, and that intelligence reports derived from the information \nintercepted as part of the latter FISA warrant had been provided to the \nWhite House, supra at 6-12;  \n \nd)  Director Comey and Admiral Rogers denied any knowledge of any \nauthorization to “wiretap” Trump Tower or President Trump’s phones, \nand those denials overlap with Director Clapper’s unofficial disclosure of \nthe fact that he was not aware of the issuance of any FISA warrants \ntargeting President Trump or his associates, supra at 13-16; and \n \ne)  The denials by Director Comey and Admiral Rogers appear to conflict \nwith the unofficial disclosure by Congressman Nunes that he had been \nshown classified documentation indicating that at least one FISA warrant \nhad been issued that, at a minimum, had permitted incidental collection of \ninformation implicating President Trump’s associates, supra at 16. \n \nThe conflicting official disclosures candidly make a mockery of DOJ’s Glomar \nresponse invocation. The denials made by Director Comey and Admiral Rogers have \nbeen contradicted by none other than the President of the United States and the  \n  20 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 18-1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 24 of 25\nWhite House Press Secretary, both of whom made official statements incorporating \nmedia reports as the evidentiary bases for their claims. Coupled with the overlapping \n(albeit contradictory) public disclosures by Director Clapper and Congressman Nunes, it \nsimply defies credulity to conclude that there have been insufficient official disclosures \nof the existence or non-existence of responsive records.  \nIf anything, the conflicting official claims that underlie this matter render a \nsubstantive response by DOJ as a practical necessity as a matter of policy, to say nothing \nof law. The President of the United States has made allegations that at least one FISA \nwarrant seeking authorization to surveil him and/or his associates was denied, and both \nhe and the White House Press Secretary incorporated media claims that a separate \nwarrant was issued that did authorize surveillance implicating the president’s associates. \nThose claims have been at least partially (if not entirely) contradicted by the NSA and \nFBI. This is exactly the type of scenario that FOIA alone can resolve to the benefit of the \npublic, as it would clarify a public dispute between portions of the Executive Branch \nregarding what the “government was up to” (or, as it may be, what it was not up to).  \nIt bears noting that denying DOJ’s Motion and granting the Plaintiffs’ Cross-Motion \ndoes not necessarily mandate that documents will ultimately be produced to the Plaintiffs. \nIt is certainly plausible (although the Plaintiffs are not conceding anything) that this \nCourt would ultimately conclude in later briefing that any actual responsive records are \nexempt from production, likely for many of the same substantive reasons outlined by \nDOJ in its current Motion. However, that legal issue is not currently before this Court and \nit cannot be addressed one way or the other until this Court first adjudicates the \nappropriateness of DOJ’s Glomar response.  \n  21 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 18-1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 25 of 25\nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, DOJ’s Motion for Summary Judgment should be denied \nand the Plaintiffs’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment should be granted. \nDate: August 18, 2017 \n            Respectfully submitted, \n \n                 /s/ \n            ________________________ \nBradley P.

See Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. \n40 [hereinafter Def.’s Mot.], Def.’s Stmt. of Material Facts, ECF No. 40 at 1–11 [hereinafter Def.’s \nFacts],  ¶  1;  see  also  Pls.’  Mot.  for  Summ.  J.,  ECF  No.  41  [hereinafter  Pl.’s  Mot.],  at  2 \n(incorporating Defendant’s fact).  On July 20, 2018, in response to multiple FOIA requests like \nthe one at issue here, Defendant made public 412 pages, which constituted “all responsive, non-\nexempt  and  reasonably  segregable  information”  from  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Act \n(“FISA”) applications related to Carter Page.  See Def.’s Facts ¶ 11; see also Pl.’s Mot. at 2.1  \n                                                           \n1 The Carter Page FISA applications were publicly acknowledged following release of a declassified memorandum \nfrom Devin Nunes, Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and an unclassified, redacted \nmemorandum from Adam Schiff, Ranking Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.  \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 51   Filed 07/30/19   Page 2 of 6\nThe released 412 pages were heavily redacted and identified a range of FOIA exemptions to justify \nthe withholdings.  See https://vault.fbi.gov/d1-release/d1-release (last visited July 30, 2019).   \nDefendant’s continued redaction of 21 of the 412 pages is the sole contested issue in the \nparties’ cross-motions for summary judgment.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 1.  The dispute arises because, \nnearly two months after releasing the 412 pages, on September 17, 2018, the White House \nannounced in a Press Release that President Trump had  \ndirected the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the \nDepartment  of  Justice  (including  the  FBI)  to  provide  for  the \nimmediate declassification of the following materials:  (1) pages 10-\n12 and 17-34 of the June 2017 application to the FISA court in the \nmatter of Carter W. Page . . . \n \nSee Pl.’s Mot. at 4; see also Press Release, White House Press Secretary (Sept. 17, 2018), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-34/ (last visited July \n30,  2019)  [hereinafter  Press  Release].    Plaintiffs  contend  that  the  Press  Release  reflects  a \npresidential order to declassify the referenced 21 pages (“the Pages”) in full.  Yet, in this FOIA \nlitigation, Defendant has not withdrawn Exemptions 1 and 3—both based on the purported \nclassification of the redacted material—as a basis for withholding information from the Pages.  \nIt also continues to assert other exemptions, including Exemptions 7(D) and 7(E), to justify \nwithholding the same information.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 4–8.2  Plaintiffs contend that the Press Release \ncreates a genuine dispute of material fact as to (1) whether Defendant validly can maintain \n                                                           \nSee Def.’s Facts ¶¶ 7–11.  “[N]o authorized government official has confirmed or denied the existence of any other \nresponsive FISA-related records.”  See id. ¶ 12. \n2 Defendant at first invoked multiple exemptions for each of the redacted portions from the Pages.  The complete line \nup  of  exemptions  included  some  combination  of  Exemptions  1,  3,  6,  7(A),  7(C),  7(D),  and  7(E).    See \nhttps://vaultfbi.gov/d1-release/d1-release (the Pages are at 301–03, 308–25).  Since the start of this litigation, \nDefendant has withdrawn Exemptions 6 and 7(C), because Carter Page supplied a privacy waiver, see Def.’s Opp’n \nto Pl.’s Mot., ECF No. 43, at 12, and Exemption 7(A), as the Russia investigation has since concluded, see Def.’s \nSupp. Memo., ECF No. 49, at 3.  Thus, what remains asserted as to the Pages is Exemptions 1, 3, 7(D), and 7(E).       \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 51   Filed 07/30/19   Page 3 of 6\nExemptions 1 and 3, and (2) whether the court can in good faith rely on Exemptions 7(D) and 7(E) \nin the alternative to affirm the withholdings.   \nII. \n  In FOIA cases, “the agency bears the burden of justifying its decision to withhold requested \ninformation.”  King v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 217 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  The agency here \nrelies on FOIA Exemption 1 to justify the redactions.3  That exemption protects against disclosing \nmatters that are “(A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be \nkept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and (B) are in fact properly classified \npursuant to such Executive order.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1).  Conversely, Exemption 1 cannot apply \nto information that has been declassified.    \nNo  one  disputes  that  “the  President,  as  head  of  the  Executive  Branch,  has  broad \ndeclassification authority.”  New York Times Co. v. CIA, 314 F. Supp. 3d 519, 526 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) \n(citing Dep’t of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988)).  The question here is whether President \nTrump exercised that authority with respect to the Pages.  Because the agency is asserting \nExemption 1 with respect to the Pages, it bears the burden of showing that the President did not \ndeclassify the Pages in full.4   \nDefendant asserts that “[t]here is no presidential declassification order, and the President \nhas  publicly  indicated  that  he  is  not  requiring  declassification  at  this  time,  much  less  full \ndisclosure.”  See Def.’s Opp’n to Pl.’s Mot., ECF No. 43 [hereinafter Def.’s Opp’n], at 1.  To \nsupport its position, Defendant relies on legal arguments, and not sworn declarations.  To start, \n                                                           \n3 Defendant’s assertion of Exemption 3 is predicated entirely on Exemption 1.  See Def.’s Mot., Decl. of David M. \nHardy, ECF No. 40-1, ¶¶ 68–72.  For ease of reference, the court refers to both as “Exemption 1.” \n4 By phrasing the issue in this way, the court does not mean to suggest that in every Exemption 1 case the agency must \nprove the record was not declassified.  This question arises in this case only because of the President’s public \ndeclassification announcement of these specific documents.     \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 51   Filed 07/30/19   Page 4 of 6\nDefendant insists that the Press Release is, “indisputably, a statement from the press secretary, not \nan order from the President.”  Id. at 3.  That argument, however, ignores the plain text of the Press \nRelease.  It says that the President “directed . . . the Department of Justice . . . to provide for the \nimmediate declassification” of the Pages.  Press Release (emphasis added).  The Release’s use of \nthe word “direct” suggests that the President ordered the Department of Justice to declassify the \nPages.5  And, while it is true that the Press Release is a statement of the Press Secretary, and not \nthe President, see Def.’s Opp’n at 3, Defendant offers no reason to believe that the Press Release \ninaccurately conveys the President’s “directive.”  Thus, contrary to what Defendant says, it would \nappear that the President did make “his intentions clear . . . to declassify information.”  Id.     \nNext, Defendant contends the Pages were not declassified because the Press Release is \n“ambiguous as to what the President may have directed.”  Def.’s Opp’n at 3.  That argument has \nit precisely backwards.  The agency bears the burden to show that Exemption 1 applies.  It cannot \ncarry that burden by suggesting that a potential declassification order is ambiguous.  Rather, the \nagency must dispel any ambiguity.  In this case, that means Defendant must establish that the Pages \nwere not declassified in full.  Defendant has not done so.      \nAdditionally,  Defendant  argues  that,  whatever  was  meant  by  the  Press  Release,  the \nPresident later “made clear . . . that he had not ordered the documents declassified.”  Id.  Defendant \npoints to a tweet from the President four days after the Press Release, stating: \nI  met  with  the  DOJ  concerning  the  declassification  of  various \nUNREDACTED documents.  They agreed to release them but stated \nthat so doing may have a perceived negative impact on the Russia \nprobe . . . Therefore, the Inspector General has been asked to review \nthese documents on an expedited basis . . . In the end I can always \ndeclassify if it proves necessary. \n \n                                                           \n5  One  common  definition  of  “direct”  is  “[t]o  give  an  order  to;  command.”    See \nhttps://www.thefreedictionary.com/directed. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 51   Filed 07/30/19   Page 5 of 6\nDef.’s Opp’n at 3–4.  Defendant maintains that this tweet makes “crystal clear” that the President \ndid not declassify documents relating to the Russia probe.  Id. at 4.  Far from it.  The tweet only \ninjects ambiguity as to the President’s intentions.  The tweet does not identify the documents to \nwhich the President is referring, let alone refer to the Pages, and it leaves unclear whether the \nPresident rescinded the directive announced in the Press Release.  Ultimately, as Defendant \nconcedes, the tweet is “fac[ially] equivocal” about the President’s instructions to the Department \nof Justice.  Id. at 4.   \nThe court in New York Times Company observed that “the courts are [not] in a position to \ndecide  whether  a  President’s  statements,  absent  an  unequivocal  declaration  that  [he]  is \ndeclassifying information, have the effect of declassifying secret information.”  New York Times \nCompany, 314 F. Supp. 3d at 527 (cleaned up).  On its face, the Press Release would appear to be \nsuch an “unequivocal declaration.”  But the President’s subsequent tweets and the agency’s \ninsistence that there is no declassification order render what seems to be unequivocal less so.  \nDefendant should have provided some clarification about what instructions the Department of \nJustice received concerning the “declassification” of the Pages’ contents.  But none of the \ndeclarations submitted by Defendant even mention the Press Release.  Therefore, on the present \nrecord, the court cannot find that Defendant’s withholding of information from the Pages was \nproper under FOIA Exemption 1.   \nIII. \nAlternatively, Defendant contends that, even if it has not met its burden as to Exemption 1, \nit has asserted other exemptions, namely, Exemptions 7(D) or 7(E), which Plaintiffs have not \nchallenged and serve as an independent ground to affirm the agency’s withholdings.  See Def.’s \nOpp’n at 5 (citing to the Pages, which list the alternative exemptions).  It is true that Plaintiffs have \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 51   Filed 07/30/19   Page 6 of 6\nnot challenged the factual basis for either Exemption 7(D) or 7(E).  But that does not resolve the \nissue.  There still remains a genuine dispute of material fact about the agency’s authority to invoke \nthose Exemptions.   \nThe  President  “directed”  the  Department  of  Justice  “to  provide  for  the  immediate \ndeclassification” of the Pages.  Did the President narrowly mean only to “declassify” the Pages, or \ndid he more broadly intend to release the Pages in full, without redactions?  To be sure, the Press \nRelease refers  only to  “immediate declassification” and is silent as to the  other applicable \nexemptions.  But why would the President order declassification of the Pages, if the agency could \nstill rely on other already-asserted exemptions to withhold the very same material?  Such an order \nwould  not  result  in  any  additional  public  information.    And  it  would  not  promote  the \n“transparency” that the Press Release identified as a reason for the President’s action.  The court \ncannot presume that the President’s declassification order was meant to have no practical effect.  \nFor that reason, there remains a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the agency here has \nthe authority to rely on Exemptions 7(D) and 7(E).       \nIV. \n  The court, therefore, denies the parties’ motions for summary judgment.  Defendant may \nsubmit an additional declaration and renew its motion for summary judgment by August 30, 2019.  \nAny supplemental declaration should provide information about (1) the effect, if any, the Press \nRelease and the President’s subsequent tweets (including the meeting referenced in the tweets) had \non the classification status of the Pages, and (2) whether the agency is authorized to assert \nExemptions 7(D) and 7(E) to shield portions of the Pages from disclosure.    \n \n                                                  \nDated:  July 30, 2019         Amit P.

Trump \n(“President Trump”), his presidential campaign, his private company, or his associates, as \nwell as any relevant applications for orders submitted to the FISC and minimization \nprocedures issued by the FISC.  \nThe DOJ filed its Motion for Summary Judgment (“Motion”) on July 14, 2017.  \nDkt. #13. The Plaintiffs simultaneously filed an Opposition to DOJ’s Motion, as well as \ntheir own Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (“Cross-Motion”), on August 18, 2017. \nDkt. #17; Dkt. #18. The DOJ filed its Reply in support of its Motion, as well as its \nOpposition to the Plaintiffs’ Cross-Motion, on September 15, 2017. Dkt. #21; Dkt. #22. \nFor the reasons set forth in detail below, this Court should grant the Plaintiffs’  \nCross-Motion with respect to DOJ’s invocation of Glomar responses.  \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  THE OFFICIAL DISCLOSURES OF INFORMATION ARE SUFFICIENT ON \nTHEIR OWN TO CONCLUDE, AS A MATTER OF LAW, THAT THE \nGLOMAR RESPONSES ARE NOT PERMISSIBLE \n \nIn their Cross-Motion, the Plaintiffs outlined the material information that had already \nbeen officially disclosed that was relevant to this Court’s assessment of DOJ’s Glomar \nresponses. Dkt. #18-1 at 5-14. \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 23   Filed 09/29/17   Page 5 of 14\nPossibly most importantly, the Plaintiffs noted that President Donald Trump has \nofficially disclosed – once in writing, and verbally during two media interviews – that \nformer FBI Director James Comey (“Director Comey”) informed him on three separate \noccasions that he (President Trump) was not under investigation. Id. at 6. That disclosure, \non its own, sets the broad parameters for any inquiry into the reasonableness of the DOJ’s \nGlomar response; if President Trump is not and has not been under investigation it is \naxiomatic that he cannot have been the subject of any type of surveillance order.  \nIt also bears noting that DOJ continues to invoke a Glomar response with respect to at \nleast parts of President Trump’s now-infamous tweets on March 4, 2017. See Dkt. #18-1 \nat 6. The DOJ’s contention in their response notwithstanding, see Dkt. #21 at 3, the \ndeclarations filed in American Oversight v. DOJ, Civil Action No. 17-718 (D.D.C.) \n(RCL), do not constitute “no responsive records” determinations with respect to the \nentirety of the March 4, 2017, tweets. Rather, a review of the declarations filed in that \ncase by the DOJ National Security Division and the Federal Bureau of Investigation \nreflect that the DOJ components were only stating they did not locate any “records of \nalleged wiretapping of Trump Tower by President Obama prior to the election.”  \nSee American Oversight, Dkt. #12-1 at ¶8 (filed September 1, 2017), Dkt. #12-3 at ¶15 \n(filed September 1, 2017).  \nNeither declaration indicated in a clear or direct manner that the “no records \nresponsive” determination concerned the separate assertions in President Trump’s tweets \nthat a court had turned down a request to conduct “wiretapping” or that there had been \nspecific “tapping” authorized in October 2016. Nor did Director Comey’s testimony,  \n  2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 23   Filed 09/29/17   Page 6 of 14\nsee Dkt. #13-3 at ¶15, clearly address those portions of the President’s official statements \nfrom his March 4, 2017, tweets.  \nA.  The Court Can “Incorporate By Reference” Portions Of Media Reports Relied \nUpon By Government Officials To Justify Their Official Disclosures \n \nThe Plaintiffs outlined in detail in their Cross-Motion how President Trump and  \nthen-White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (“Mr. Spicer”) made official disclosures \nin the aftermath of the March 4, 2017, tweets. Those official disclosures cited to \ninformation contained in media reports, the substance of which President Trump and  \nMr. Spicer asserted they were relying upon as the factual justification for  \nPresident Trump’s original March 4, 2017, tweets. Dkt. #18-1 at 6-13. DOJ contends that \nthe incorporation of media reports by Government officials to validate official statements \nis of no consequence in terms of whether that incorporation renders the portions of the \nmedia reports officially acknowledged. See Dkt. #21 at 4-5; see also id. at 5 (“Mere \ncommenting on them, or even relying on them, without any statement they are accurate, \nsurely does not either.”)(emphasis added). \nThe policy implications of DOJ’s position are startling. DOJ is effectively arguing \nthat when Government officials – including the President of the United States – make \nofficial statements and subsequently cite to unofficial information in media reports as the \nfactual basis for their official statements, the Government officials are not actually \nvouching for the accuracy of those portions of the media reports, to say nothing of the \naccuracy of their official statements themselves. In effect, unless Government officials \ninclude the magic words “I am confirming the accuracy of these media reports”, DOJ is \nasserting they can make official statements to their heart’s content based upon what they \n  3 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 23   Filed 09/29/17   Page 7 of 14\nread in the newspaper that morning and yet the statements will have no legal value nor \nfactual legitimacy. \nTo adhere to DOJ’s position would decimate the “official acknowledgment” \nexception. Consider the following hypothetical:  \na)  the President posts on Twitter tomorrow morning that he just learned there is a \nplot by “the Deep State” to poison him;  \n \nb)  at a White House press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee-\nSanders (“Mrs. Sanders”) explains that the President had just read an article on \nthe InfoWars website in which anonymous sources claim “Deep State operatives” \nare putting sedatives in the President’s food and drink, see https://www.infowars. \ncom/deep-state-drugging-trump-ahead-of-coup-sources-say/ (last accessed \nSeptember 27, 2017), and that he issued his tweet in response to the claims in that \nstory;  \n \nc)  the President subsequently gives a media interview in which he confirms he \nissued his tweet after reviewing the InfoWars story and says he wants Congress to \ninvestigate the matter; and \n \nd)  Neither President Trump nor Mrs. Sanders ever specifically state that the \naccusations in the InfoWars story are accurate. \n \nUnder DOJ’s view of the case law, neither President Trump nor Mrs. Sanders made \nofficial disclosures about the accuracy of the claims in the InfoWars article. Any \nargument subsequently made in a FOIA request that President Trump had officially \nacknowledged the existence of records reflecting such poisoning would have to fail. \nHowever, at the same time, the President would have been able to make an official \nstatement indicating that he was in fact being poisoned.  \nWith due respect, this simply cannot nor should it be the law. This appears to be a \nmatter of first impression. The undersigned has not been able to identify – nor, \napparently, has the Government – any case law on-point that address the novel factual \ndilemma posed by President Trump’s unconventional communication methods. DOJ’s \n  4 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 23   Filed 09/29/17   Page 8 of 14\ncitations to case law regarding unofficial disclosures and media speculation, see Dkt. #21 \nat 5, are inapposite, as none of those cases involved a factual scenario similar to the \npresent case. See Public Citizen v. Dep’t of State, 11 F.3d 198, 201 (D.C. Cir. 1993) \n(official disclosures did not encompass broader information sought); Fitzgibbon v. CIA, \n911 F.2d 755, 766 (D.C. Cir. 1990)(agency disclosure of station location in congressional \nreport for particular years does not apply to other years not tied to the specific \ndisclosure); Afshar v. Dep’t of State, 702 F.2d 1125, 1133-34 (D.C. Cir. 1983) \n(books published by former officials cannot create an official disclosure on their own).  \nIn contrast, here it was the President of the United States making unprompted official \ndisclosures, and then subsequent official statements by both the President and the  \nWhite House Press Secretary specifically relied upon media reports to factually justify \nthe context of the President’s unprompted official disclosures. This was not something as \nbanal as Mr. Spicer merely commenting on media reports in a vacuum. Both  \nPresident Trump and Mr. Spicer unequivocally cited to the media reports to validate the \ntruth of President Trump’s claims in his March 4, 2017, tweets. Mr. Spicer in particular \nwas unambiguously clear in stating that some manner of surveillance had occurred.  \nSee Dkt. #18-1 at 7 (“Well, I think that there’s no question that something happened. The \nquestion is, it is surveillance, is it a wiretap, or whatever.”); see also id. at 12 (“There’s \nno question that there was surveillance techniques used throughout this I think by a \nvariety of outlets that have reported this activity concluded.”).  \n  The interests of public policy support the conclusion that when Government officials \nincorporate by reference into their official statements otherwise-unofficial disclosures in \nmedia reports they render that information “officially acknowledged” for purposes of \n  5 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 23   Filed 09/29/17   Page 9 of 14\nevaluating a Glomar response. Cf. FBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615, 630 (1982)(finding \nFOIA Exemption 5 protection for predecisional communications no longer applied when \nthose communications were incorporated into a final agency decision). \nB.  DOJ’s Glomar Responses Fail As A Matter Of Law \nThe Plaintiffs have more than sufficiently outlined how official disclosures by \nPresident Trump and Mr. Spicer have already placed into the public domain the existence \nof records responsive to the underlying FOIA requests. Dkt. #18-1 at 5-14.  \nDOJ responded by arguing that the Plaintiffs have misconstrued and misapplied the \nprecedent set forth in ACLU v. CIA, 710 F.3d 422 (D.C. Cir. 2013). See Dkt. #21 at 1-5.  \nDOJ, however, has overplayed its hand in construing the ACLU ruling in such a cramped \nmanner. Not a single one of the official disclosures in the ACLU case specifically stated \nthat the CIA conducted or was involved in drone strikes; rather, the official disclosures \nonly stated that the United States in general conducts drone strikes. Id. at 429-31. The \nD.C. Circuit nonetheless found CIA’s Glomar response to be illogical and implausible, \nconcluding that the idea that the Nation’s most famous intelligence agency would not \nhave some interest in otherwise-officially acknowledged drone strikes would perpetuate a \n“fiction of deniability that no reasonable person would regard as plausible.” Id. at 431. \nThe ACLU precedent for Glomar responses was further clarified just six months ago \nby one of this Court’s brethren. In Smith v. CIA, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47230  \n(D.D.C. Mar. 30, 2017), U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan concluded that it was \npermissible to interpret an official statement by then-President Barack Obama about \nproviding “military and intelligence assistance” to Israel as sufficiently similar enough to \n  6 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 23   Filed 09/29/17   Page 10 of 14\nthe plaintiff’s FOIA request seeking a copy of intelligence budget line items concerning \nIsrael so as to justify rejecting CIA’s Glomar response. Id. at *6-*10. \nThe official disclosures made by President Trump and Mr. Spicer, whether done \ndeliberately or recklessly, are more than sufficient to fall within the ambit of ACLU and \nSmith. No less an authoritative source than President Trump has stated on multiple \noccasions that he was informed by Director Comey that he is not the subject of an \ninvestigation. President Trump further stated that a “wire tapping” request had been \n“turned down by court earlier”, and that there had been surveillance implicating him in \nOctober 2016. Dkt. #18-1 at 5-6. Mr. Spicer reiterated on two separate occasions that \nthere had been some means of “surveillance” that had occurred, supra at 5, and both \nPresident Trump and Mr. Spicer deliberately incorporated by reference information in \nmedia reports concerning FISA warrants (including an allegedly declined FISA warrant \napplication) in order to justify the veracity of President Trump’s original  \nMarch 4, 2017, tweets. Dkt. #18-1 at 6-13. In short, President Trump and Mr. Spicer both \nofficially acknowledged that there was surveillance that was conducted of President \nTrump during the previous administration, and President Trump specifically cited to at \nleast one failed application for surveillance.  \nTo adhere to DOJ’s cramped interpretation of the ACLU standard, however, would \nperpetuate a fiction in which it is plausible that President Trump (per his own statements) \nis not the subject of an investigation despite the fact that he might be the subject of a \nFISA warrant. It beggars belief to view such a circumstance as plausible or logical in any \nfactual sense of the word. \n \n  7 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 23   Filed 09/29/17   Page 11 of 14\nII. IT WOULD CONSTITUTE A REASONABLE EXERCISE OF THIS \nCOURT’S DISCRETION TO INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE THE \nUNOFFICIAL STATEMENTS MADE BY DIRECTOR CLAPPER AND \nCONGRESSMAN NUNES \n \nThe Plaintiffs concede that, ordinarily, the unofficial statements made by  \nFormer Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (“Director Clapper”) and \nCongressman Devon Nunes (“Congressman Nunes”) would not be admissible here.  \nSee Dkt. #18-1 at 14-16. The Plaintiffs argued in their Cross-Motion that this Court \nwould be within its discretion to nonetheless consider those unofficial statements to the \nextent they overlapped with and/or corroborated separate official statements. Id. at ¶¶17-\n18. The Plaintiffs wish to clarify and revise the argument they put forward in their Cross-\nMotion by noting that they are only seeking to incorporate by reference these unofficial \ndisclosures for the limited purpose of demonstrating the existence of a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact in dispute warranting the denial of DOJ’s Motion.1 \nDOJ not surprisingly rejected the Plaintiffs’ argument. See Dkt. #21 at 6-8. However, \nthe Plaintiffs maintain that the relevant case law has not contemplated a set of facts like \nthose that exist in the present case. To the best of the undersigned’s knowledge, the case \nlaw has only contemplated a situation where a plaintiff seeks to establish official \ndisclosure primarily (if not exclusively) by way of unofficial statements. See e.g., \nMobley v. CIA, 806 F.3d 568, 583-84 (D.C. Cir. 2015)(disclosure of an FBI record by a \nforeign government did not qualify as an official disclosure); Afshar v. Dep’t of State, \n702 F.2d 1125, 1133-34 (D.C. Cir. 1983)(books published by former CIA officials were \nnot tantamount to official executive acknowledgments); Hayden v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, \n                                                 \n1 Given this modification of the Plaintiffs’ argument, they do not object to DOJ being \npermitted by this Court to file a short sur-reply addressing this particular issue. \n  8 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 23   Filed 09/29/17   Page 12 of 14\n608 F.2d 1381, 1388 (D.C. Cir. 1979)(uninformed speculation regarding which foreign \ncommunications channels are known to be monitored did not render improper \nclassification of relevant documentation);  \nThat is not the case here. As explained earlier, supra at 2, 6-7, the Plaintiffs contend \nthat the official disclosures by President Trump and Mr. Spicer alone are more than \nsufficient to render improper DOJ’s Glomar responses as a matter of law. The Plaintiffs \nseek incorporation of these unofficial disclosures only as supplemental information to be \nconsidered, not as the primary basis for evaluating an official acknowledgment argument, \nand only for the alternative purpose of demonstrating the existence of a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact in dispute (if necessary).  \nThe Plaintiffs request this Court assess this proposition carefully. The Plaintiffs \nrespectfully submit that the interests of public policy support the conclusion that federal \ncourts can consider supplemental unofficial evidence to the extent the content of those \nunofficial disclosures substantially overlaps with that of separate official disclosures.  \nCf. Stillman v. CIA, 319 F.3d 546, 548 (D.C. Cir. 2003)(concluding that trial court \nshould consider pleadings filed by the Government, as well as plaintiff, regarding the \nappropriateness of classification claims in a First Amendment case before reaching \nconstitutional question of whether the court can compel the Government to grant \nplaintiff’s private attorney access to the purported classified manuscript). \nThis would be a narrow exception to the “unofficial statement” rule. In all honesty, \nabsent President Trump’s calculated (albeit somewhat reckless) official disclosures – and \nMr. Spicer’s unorthodox attempt to legitimize those disclosures by incorporating claims \nmade in media reports – the Glomar responses issued by DOJ would stand on much \n  9 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 23   Filed 09/29/17   Page 13 of 14\nfirmer legal ground. The actions of President Trump and Mr. Spicer have undercut the \nlegal feasibility of DOJ’s legal position. By doing so, they arguably opened the door to \ndiscretionary consideration of supplemental evidence that otherwise would ordinarily be \nprecluded. \nFor example, and as outlined in the Plaintiffs’ Cross-Motion, Dkt. #18-1 at 16, \nCongressman Nunes provided unofficial disclosures of the existence of at least one FISA \nwarrant authorizing surveillance that implicated President Trump’s associates. The \nPlaintiffs do not require incorporation of this unofficial disclosure by a Member of \nCongress to establish official acknowledgment of this information as a matter of law. \nPresident Trump and Mr. Spicer already officially acknowledged the existence of some \ntype of surveillance that implicated the President and/or his associates. The context of \nCongressman Nunes’ unofficial statements merely supplement and clarify the nature of \nthe surveillance to which both President Trump and Mr. Spicer were referring in their \nremarks. That context would be relevant to this Court’s analysis of the extent to which \nthere is a genuine issue of material fact in dispute warranting denial of DOJ’s Glomar \nresponses. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiffs’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment \nshould be granted. \n  10 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 23   Filed 09/29/17   Page 14 of 14\nDate: September 29, 2017 \n            Respectfully submitted, \n \n                 /s/ \n            ________________________ \nBradley P.

Defendant Department of Justice (“DOJ”) is an agency within the meaning of  \n5 U.S.C. § 552 (e), and is in possession and/or control of the records requested by the plaintiffs \nthat are the subject of this action. DOJ controls – and consequently serves as the proper party \ndefendant for litigation purposes for – the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”). \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n6.  This lawsuit is brought under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) and seeks the \nproduction to the American public of information resolving whether there was an order issued by \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (“FISC”) authorizing surveillance of and/or \ncollection of information implicating President Donald J. Trump (“President Trump”), as well as \nhis campaign and transition team. \n  7.  On March 4, 2017, President Trump sent out a four-part post on Twitter accusing former \nPresident Barack Obama’s Administration of a “Nixon/Watergate” effort to “tap” the phones of \nPresident Trump and/or his associates during the 2016 presidential campaign. President Trump \nsuggested the surveillance was unlawful. https://www.washingtonpost.com /politics/trump-\n2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597   Document 1   Filed 04/04/17   Page 3 of 7\n \naccuses-obama-of-nixonwatergate-wiretap--but-offers-no-evidence/2017 /03/04/1ddc35e6-0114-\n11e7-8ebe-6e0dbe4f2bca_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_ trumpwiretap-8pm%3A \nhomepage%2Fstory&tid=a_inl&utm_term=.23f02d72f083 (last accessed March 6, 2017).  \n  8.  President Trump’s accusations have prompted a series of additional disclosures about \nintelligence matters related to the 2016 election. The Chairman of the House Permanent Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, Devin Nunes (“Chairman Nunes”), specifically disclosed the \nexistence of surveillance authorized under FISA. https://www.washingtonpost.com \n/powerpost/house-intelligence-chair-says-its-possible-trumps-communications-were-\nintercepted/2017/03/22/f45e18ba-0f2d-11e7-9b0d-d27c98455440_story.html?utm_term \n=.677004ae4431 (last accessed April 3, 2017).

Press \nSecretary Sean Spicer has sought to clarify President Trump’s tweets by suggesting that the \n3 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597   Document 1   Filed 04/04/17   Page 4 of 7\n \ncomments were referencing surveillance in general. http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/spicer-trump-\ntalking-general-surveillance-wiretapping-tweets/story?id=46101282 (last accessed  \nMarch 20, 2017). President Trump, however, has continued to publicly suggest he was the target \nof “wiretapping” ordered by the prior administration. http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/17/ \npolitics/donald-trump-angela-merkel/ (last accessed April 3, 2017). \n  10. Chairman Nunes has publicly stated that a “source” within the intelligence community \nshowed him “dozens” of reports that allegedly reflect incidentally collected communications \nbetween members of President Trump’s transition team and foreign targets. Chairman Nunes \nfurther stated that the information was based on a FISA warrant. President Trump, in response to \nthose disclosures by Chairman Nunes, stated that he felt that meant his original comments were \nright. http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/23/trump-basks-in-nunes-surveillance-news-so-\nthat-means-im-right.html (last accessed April 3, 2017). Later media reports indicated that \nChairman Nunes received this information from two White House officials with whom he met on \nthe White House grounds so that he could have access to specific classified systems on which the \ninformation resided. http://www.thedailybeast.com /articles/2017/03/30/things-go-from-bad-to-\nworse-for-devin-nunes-and-team-trump.html (last accessed April 3, 2017). Press Secretary Sean \nSpicer has confirmed that Chairman Nunes reviewed the classified information on the White \nHouse grounds. http://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/politics/trump%E2%80%99s-white-house-\nstruggles-to-get-out-from-under-russia-controversy/ar-BBz8CPn (last accessed April 3, 2017). \n  11. The comments of President Trump and Press Secretary Sean Spicer constitute prior \nofficial disclosure of the existence of surveillance orders issued by the FISC and that authorized \ncollection of information that, at a minimum, incidentally implicated President Trump and/or his \n4 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597   Document 1   Filed 04/04/17   Page 5 of 7\n \nassociates. This lawsuit ultimately will seek to determine the circumstances in which specific \nsurveillance/collection orders were issued by the FISC. \nCOUNT ONE (FBI) \n  12. The plaintiffs JMP and Heath (referred to jointly as “the Requesters”) repeat and \nreallege paragraphs 6 through 10 above, inclusive. \n  13. By letter dated March 6, 2017, the Requesters submitted to the FBI a FOIA request. \n  14. The FOIA request specifically sought the following records: \n1)  A copy of any order(s) by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n(“FISC”) authorizing surveillance of and/or collection of information \nconcerning the Trump Organization, President Trump, President Trump’s \ncampaign for the presidency, or people associated with President Trump;  \n \n2)  A complete copy of any application(s) to the FISC seeking authorization \nfor surveillance of and/or collection of information concerning the Trump \nOrganization, President Trump, President Trump’s campaign for the \npresidency, or people associated with President Trump; and \n \n3)  A copy of any minimization procedures issued by the FISC and that \napplied to any order(s) issued that fall within the scope of categories #1 or \n2. \n \n  15. The Requesters noted that the scope of the search should be construed to include all \ntypes of applications for “orders” or “warrants” regarding which the FISC is authorized to issue, \nincluding but not limited to, an order authorizing surveillance of an “agent of a foreign power” \nor an order authorizing the collection of “business records” through Section 215 of the USA \nPatriot Act. The Requesters stated that the FBI could limit the timeframe of its search from  \nJune 1, 2016, up until the date of acceptance of the request. \n  16. The Requesters pre-emptively asserted that President Trump’s public comments \nconstitute prior official disclosure of the existence of at least one, if not more, FISA warrants. \nThe Requesters argued that as a result they would dispute any legal claim justifying a refusal to \n5 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597   Document 1   Filed 04/04/17   Page 6 of 7\n \nconfirm or deny the existence or non-existence of responsive records, as well as any legal claim \njustifying withholdings or redactions based exclusively upon Exemption 1, as implicating \nclassified information. The FOIA request also explained that the Requesters were seeking \nexpedited processing.  \n  17. By letter dated March 20, 2017, the FBI granted expedited processing. The FBI \ndesignated the request as Request No. 1368992-000. \n  18. To date, no substantive response has been received by the Requesters from the FBI. The \nRequesters have constructively exhausted all required administrative remedies. \n  19. The Requesters have a legal right under the FOIA to obtain the information they seek, and \nthere is no legal basis for the denial by the FBI of said right. \nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs The James Madison Project and Brad Heath pray that this Court: \n  (1) Orders the defendant federal agency to disclose the requested records in their entirety and \nmake copies promptly available to the plaintiffs; \n  (2) Award reasonable costs and attorney’s fees as provided in 5 U.S.C. § 552 (a)(4)(E) and/or \n28 U.S.C. § 2412 (d); \n  (3) expedite this action in every way pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1657 (a); and \n  (4) grant such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \n6 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597   Document 1   Filed 04/04/17   Page 7 of 7\n \nDate:  April 4, 2017 \n            Respectfully submitted, \n              /s/ \n            __________________________ \n            Bradley P.

By letter dated March 6, 2017, the Requesters submitted to the FBI a FOIA request. \n  14. The FOIA request specifically sought the following records: \n1)  A copy of any order(s) by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n(“FISC”) authorizing surveillance of and/or collection of information \nconcerning the Trump Organization, President Trump, President Trump’s \ncampaign for the presidency, or people associated with President Trump;  \n \n2)  A complete copy of any application(s) to the FISC seeking authorization \nfor surveillance of and/or collection of information concerning the Trump \nOrganization, President Trump, President Trump’s campaign for the \npresidency, or people associated with President Trump; and \n \n3)  A copy of any minimization procedures issued by the FISC and that \napplied to any order(s) issued that fall within the scope of categories #1 or \n2. \n \n  15. The Requesters noted that the scope of the search should be construed to include all \ntypes of applications for “orders” or “warrants” regarding which the FISC is authorized to issue, \nincluding but not limited to, an order authorizing surveillance of an “agent of a foreign power” \nor an order authorizing the collection of “business records” through Section 215 of the USA \nPatriot Act. The Requesters stated that the FBI could limit the timeframe of its search from  \nJune 1, 2016, up until the date of acceptance of the request. \n  16. The Requesters pre-emptively asserted that President Trump’s public comments \nconstitute prior official disclosure of the existence of at least one, if not more, FISA warrants. \nThe Requesters argued that as a result they would dispute any legal claim justifying a refusal to \n5 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 5   Filed 04/15/17   Page 6 of 8\n \nconfirm or deny the existence or non-existence of responsive records, as well as any legal claim \njustifying withholdings or redactions based exclusively upon Exemption 1, as implicating \nclassified information. The FOIA request also explained that the Requesters were seeking \nexpedited processing.  \n  17. By letter dated March 20, 2017, the FBI granted expedited processing. The FBI \ndesignated the request as Request No. 1368992-000. \n  18. On April 4, 2017, the Requesters initiated this litigation on behalf of the FBI. At the \ntime of the filing of the Complaint, no substantive response had yet been received by the \nRequesters from the FBI, and the Requesters had therefore constructively exhausted all required \nadministrative remedies.  \n  19. Approximately six hours after the initiation of this litigation, the FBI issued a response \nto the Requesters. In that response, the FBI stated that it could not confirm or deny the existence \nof responsive records, as doing so would trigger harm to national security interests under \nExemptions (b)(1) and (b)(3). As this substantive response was issued after the initiation of the \nlitigation, the Requesters are not obligated to file an administrative appeal.  \n  20. The Requesters have a legal right under the FOIA to obtain the information they seek, and \nthere is no legal basis for the denial by the FBI of said right. \nCOUNT TWO (DOJ NSD) \n  21. The Requesters repeat and reallege paragraphs 6 through 10 above, inclusive. \n  22. By letter dated March 6, 2017, the Requesters submitted a FOIA request to DOJ NSD. \n  23. The Requesters repeat and reallege paragraphs 14 through 16, as the scope of the request \nand issues such as categorical privacy rights and expedited processing were addressed in similar \nfashion in the request to DOJ NSD as they were addressed in the request to the FBI. \n6 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 5   Filed 04/15/17   Page 7 of 8\n \n  24. By e-mail dated March 17, 2017, DOJ NSD issued a substantive response in which it \nrefused to confirm or deny the existence of responsive records. It designated the request as \nFOIA/PA #17-094. \n  25. The Requesters timely filed an administrative appeal. \n  26. By letter dated April 12, 2017, the DOJ Office of Information Policy denied the \nRequesters’ appeal. \n  27. The Requesters have a legal right under the FOIA to obtain the information they seek, and \nthere is no legal basis for the denial by the DOJ NSD of said right. \nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs The James Madison Project and Brad Heath pray that this Court: \n  (1) Orders the defendant federal agencies to disclose the requested records in their entirety \nand make copies promptly available to the plaintiffs; \n  (2) Award reasonable costs and attorney’s fees as provided in 5 U.S.C. § 552 (a)(4)(E) and/or \n28 U.S.C. § 2412 (d); \n  (3) expedite this action in every way pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1657 (a); and \n  (4) grant such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \n7 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 5   Filed 04/15/17   Page 8 of 8\n \nDate:  April 15, 2017 \n            Respectfully submitted, \n              /s/ \n            __________________________ \n            Bradley P.

Defendant United \nStates Department of Justice (“DOJ”) explained that FISA information pertaining to particular \nindividuals and entities is currently and properly classified and subject to FOIA exemptions 1, 3, \n7(A) and 7(E).   Moreover, Defendant explained that, even considering the information in the \npublic sphere, disclosure of the specific information sought by Plaintiffs is reasonably expected \nto harm national security and ongoing law enforcement efforts.  In response, Plaintiffs maintain \nonly that the applicable exemptions have been waived through various public statements, none of \nwhich match the specific information requested here.  Plaintiffs attempt to cast vague, irrelevant, \nunsourced or non-official statements as waivers, apparently believing that a sufficient volume of \ninnuendo and media speculation amounts to official acknowledgement.  It does not. \nARGUMENT \nI.  The Standard for Official Acknowledgment. \nThe standard for finding an official acknowledgement is settled law in this Circuit: the \nprecise information at issue must have been officially and specifically disclosed by an authorized \nofficial and be in the public domain as such.  See Wolf v. CIA, 473 F.3d 370, 378 (D.C. Cir. \n2007); Mem in Supp. of Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. (MSJ) at 17-20, ECF No. 13.  Not a single \nstatement cited by Plaintiffs meets this standard. \nPlaintiffs rely heavily on the D.C. Circuit decision in ACLU v. CIA, 710 F.3d 422 (D.C. \nCir. 2013), but that case does not stand for the proposition that sufficient accumulation of media \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 22   Filed 09/15/17   Page 6 of 16\nattention or innuendo amounts to waiver.  Plaintiffs erroneously suppose that the decision in \nACLU v. CIA changed the standard for official acknowledgement as applied to Glomar \nresponses, and that the requirement of “specificity” no longer applies.  Mem. in Opp’n to Def.’s \nMSJ and in Supp. of Pls.’ Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. (Pls.’ MSJ) at 19, ECF No. 18-1.  That \nreading of ACLU v. CIA is unsupported by text or logic.  Rather, the Court found that several \ndirect statements of authorized officials acknowledged the very fact sought to be protected by the \nGlomar – that CIA had an intelligence interest in U.S. drone strikes.  710 F.3d at 429.  The Court \ndid not require an agency to respond to a request that was both more and less extensive than a \npublic disclosure and thus clearly delineate the scope of ambiguous official statements, revealing \nthe very information previously kept secret. \nHere, by contrast to ACLU, the request seeks specific undisclosed details allegedly \npertaining to an ongoing and acknowledged investigation.  The fact sought to be protected is not \nthe FBI’s general interest in a national security investigation; it is the investigatory details at \nissue, which have not been confirmed or denied by any authorized source.  Indeed, the purpose \nof the FOIA request appears to be to ferret out the existence or nonexistence of authorized FISA \nwarrants with respect to the acknowledged investigation.  There is no official acknowledgement \nof the precise information at issue here. \nII.  The Cited White House Statements Do Not Foreclose the Glomar Response. \nPlaintiffs cite a number of statements from the President or the Press Secretary that do \nnot constitute acknowledgement of the information sought here.  As discussed in Defendants’ \nMotion for Summary Judgment, the President’s March 4 tweets do not confirm or deny the \nexistence of FISA materials.  Def.’s MSJ at 19-20.  Nor do they amount to implicit \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 22   Filed 09/15/17   Page 7 of 16\nacknowledgement of the existence or nonexistence of FISA materials.  See Pls.’ MSJ at 4.1  The \ncategory of records sought by Plaintiffs, however, is both narrower than that addressed by the \nMarch 4 tweets (because the request is limited to FISA information) and broader than that \naddressed by the March 4 tweets (because the request is not limited in time, location, or other \nspecifics.) 2  The Glomar response thus remains appropriate for the category of records sought by \nPlaintiff.  The Government has not generally confirmed or denied the use of this particular \nelectronic surveillance technique pertaining to particular individuals or organizations, \nparticularly those allegedly related to ongoing national security investigations.  This information \nis currently and properly classified, and otherwise exempt.   Plaintiffs fail to respond to those \narguments and instead just repeat portions of the tweets.  Pls.’ MSJ at 6. \nPlaintiffs also rely on the President’s statements that he was not personally under \ninvestigation at the time.  See Pls.’ MSJ at 5-6.  Such statements have no arguable bearing on the \nprecise issue here – whether or not there are any FISA materials pertaining to President Trump, \nthe Trump Organization, President Donald Trump, or the Trump campaign.  “Prior disclosure of \nsimilar information does not suffice; instead, the specific information sought by the plaintiff \nmust already be in the public domain by official disclosure.”  Wolf, 473 F.3d at 378; Pub. Citizen \n                                                           \n1 As discussed in the Hardy Declaration, then-FBI Director James Comey stated that DOJ has no \ninformation to support the tweets.  Def.’s MSJ at 20; Hardy Decl. ¶ 15.  In another FOIA matter \nin this district, in which the requestor sought records more clearly encompassing the matters \nmentioned by the President, DOJ submitted declarations again confirming that DOJ has no such \nrecords.  See Declarations of David Hardy and G. Bradley Weinsheimer, American Oversight v. \nDOJ, No.17-718 (September 1, 2017).  Regardless, the nonexistence of a set of records that is in \nways both broader and narrower than the requested records does not waive a Glomar as to the \ncross-cutting request. \n2 Former Director Comey also testified about the need for continued secrecy in his March 20th \ntestimony before HPSCI, where he discussed why the FBI does not confirm or refute unsourced \nmedia reports.  See Transcript of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Hearing \non Russian Interference in the 2016 U.S. Election, March 20, 2017 (question and answer \nexchanges between former Director Comey and Representative Trey Gowdy). \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 22   Filed 09/15/17   Page 8 of 16\nv. Dep’t of State, 11 F.3d 198, 201 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (explaining that the information officially \nacknowledged must “duplicate[ ] that being withheld”); Shapiro v. CIA, 170 F. Supp. 3d 147, \n159 (D.D.C. 2016).  As noted by the D.C. Circuit, “[t]he insistence on exactitude recognizes ‘the \nGovernment’s vital interest in information relating to national security and foreign affairs.’” \nWolf, 473 F.3d at 378. \nPlaintiffs then quote at length certain statements by the then-White House Press Secretary \nabout press reports, in which he does not confirm or deny whether there were FISA materials.  \nFor example, Plaintiffs quote a statement from March 6, 2017: Commenting on news reports, \nMr. Spicer states that “something happened,” that it “could be FISA,” “that it could be \nsurveillance,” that “the question is, is it surveillance, is it a wiretap, or whatever,” and that the \nPresident “wants Congress to look into this.”  See Pls.’ MSJ at 6-7.  And the lengthy quote from \nhis March 16 statement concludes only that “this leads to a lot.”   Id. at 8-11.  It recounts certain \nmedia reporting, but contains not a single definitive statement from Mr. Spicer that there was in \nfact surveillance, much less that there was in fact FISA material at issue.  Such a vague \ngenerality does not waive the right to withhold the far more specific information sought here – \nwhether or not there are specifically FISA documents pertaining to surveillance of particular \nindividuals.  See Afshar v. Dep’t of State, 702 F.2d 1125, 1133 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (holding release \nof information that “provide[s] only the most general outline” of an intelligence effort does not \nwaive right to withhold documents giving “a far more precise idea” of that effort because \nwithheld information must have “already been specifically revealed to the public”). \nPlaintiffs argue that “[a]lthough these media reports would not, on their own, qualify as \nofficial disclosures of information, President Trump and Mr. Spicer’s specific reliance upon the \ninformation in the media reports – particularly in terms of forming the basis for President \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 22   Filed 09/15/17   Page 9 of 16\nTrump’s specific claims in his March 4, 2017, tweets – constitute ‘official acknowledgement’ of \nat least those portions of the media reports that overlap with President Trump’s claims.”  Pls.’ \nMSJ at 12-13, id. at 20-21.  This novel theory that consideration of news reports and \n“incorporation by reference” amounts to official acknowledgement of the details contained in \nsuch news reports is unsupported by any citation, and is fundamentally inconsistent with the \nwell-settled criteria for finding official acknowledgement. \nMr. Spicer, in fact, clarifies that neither he nor the President were disclosing any official \ninformation but instead commenting on news reports.  See Pls.’ MSJ at 6-13.  For example, \nPlaintiffs note that the President stated that the tweets were in the context of having read an \narticle in the New York Times and watched a news report.  Pls.’ MSJ at 8.  And Mr. Spicer later \ndescribed in detail the various news reports about alleged surveillance.  Pls.’ MSJ at 8-11.   It is \nbeyond cavil that media reports quoting unnamed and unofficial sources do not constitute official \ndisclosure.  See Fitzgibbon v. C.I.A., 911 F.2d 755, 765 (D.C .Cir. 1990) (“‘[I]t is one thing for a \nreporter or author to speculate or guess that a thing may be so or even, quoting undisclosed \nsources, to say that it is so; it is quite another thing for one in a position to know of it officially to \nsay that it is so.’”); Afshar, 702 F.2d at 1130 (rejecting suggestion that public and media \nspeculation about CIA liaison with Iranian government constituted prior disclosure); Public \nCitizen, 11 F.3d at 201 (“even if a fact has been the subject of media speculation, its official \nacknowledgment could” cause damage).  Mere commenting on them, or even relying on them, \nwithout any statement that they are accurate, surely does not either.   \nIII.   Other Official Statements Do Not Foreclose the Glomar Response. \nPlaintiffs cite two official statements that do not confirm or deny the existence of FISA \nmaterial pertaining to the specified individuals and entities.  First, consistent with the \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 22   Filed 09/15/17   Page 10 of 16\nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgement, Plaintiffs quote then-FBI Director Comey’s \nstatement that FBI and DOJ have no records to support the President’s tweets.  See Pls.’ MSJ at \n13; Def.’s MSJ at 20.  As noted above, the President’s tweets do not specify the existence or \nnonexistence of FISA material but do specify other details.  Mr. Comey’s general statement in \nresponse does not mean that there is or is not responsive FISC material.     \nSecond, Plaintiffs cite a wholly irrelevant statement by Admiral Mike Rogers, Director of \nthe NSA.  In response to a question from Congressman Schiff, “Did you ever request that your \ncounterparts in GCHQ [(Government Communications Headquarters, a British intelligence and \nsecurity agency)] should wiretap Mr. Trump on behalf of President Obama?”, Admiral Rogers \nresponded directly, “No sir, nor would I, that would be expressly against the construct of the \nFive Eyes agreement that’s been in place for decades.”  See Full Transcript: FBI Director James \nComey testifies on Russian interference in 2016 election, WashingtonPost.com (Mar. 20, 2017), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/03/20/full-transcript-fbi-director-\njames-comey-testifies-on-russian-interference-in-2016-election/.   It is hard to see how this \nstatement regarding British intelligence has any bearing on the existence or nonexistence of \nFISA materials at DOJ or FBI pertaining to the named individuals or entities.  In any event, the \nNSA Director could not waive a Glomar on behalf of DOJ.  See Frugone v. CIA, 169 F.3d 772, \n774–75 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (protecting the CIA’s right to make a Glomar response despite official \ndisclosure of the same information by the Office of Personnel Management). \nIV.  Unofficial Statements Do Not Foreclose the Glomar Response. \nPlaintiffs also cite a statement from a former Government official and statement from a \nMember of Congress as evidence of official acknowledgement.  Pls.’ MSJ at 14-18.  Although \nPlaintiffs characterize the caselaw as “murky,” it is in fact quite clear.  Former officials do not \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 22   Filed 09/15/17   Page 11 of 16\nspeak for the Government.  See Public Citizen, 11 F.3d at 201; Afshar, 702 F.2d at 1133.  The \nfact that some information related to a certain subject exists in the public domain, however, \n“does not eliminate the possibility that further disclosures can cause harm to intelligence sources, \nmethods, and operations.”  Students Against Genocide v. Dep’t of State, 257 F.3d 828, 835 (D.C. \nCir. 2001) (citing Fitzgibbon, 911 F.2d at 766); Afshar, 702 F.2d at 1130; Military Audit Project \nv. Casey, 656 F.2d 724, 745 (D.C. Cir. 1981); Riquelme v. CIA, 453 F. Supp. 2d 103, 109 \n(D.D.C. 2006).  It would set a dangerous precedent if unauthorized public statements could cause \notherwise classified or protected information to become unclassified and that is why this \nproposition has been resoundingly rejected by the courts. \nMoreover, Members of Congress cannot waive FOIA exemptions on behalf of the \nExecutive Branch.  The release of information by Congress (and, presumably, an individual \nMember of Congress) does not constitute official disclosure of classified information by the \nrelevant Executive Branch agency.  See Military Audit Project, 656 F.2d at 742-745; see also \nMoore v. CIA, 666 F.3d 1330, 1333 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“[W]e do not deem ‘official’ a \ndisclosure made by someone other than the agency from which the information is being sought.” \n(quoting Frugone v. CIA, 169 F.3d 772, 774 (D.C. Cir. 1999)); Earth Pledge Found. v. CIA, 988 \nF. Supp. 623, 627-628 (S.D.N.Y. 1996), aff ’d, 128 F.3d 788 (2d Cir. 1997) (cited with approval \nin Wilson v. CIA, 586 F.3d 171, 186-187 (2d Cir. 2009)). \nTo hold otherwise would permit Members of Congress who might have been provided \nwith classified information in the course of their official duties to override an Executive Branch \nclassification decision without authorization to do so.  See Murphy v. Dep’t of Army, 613 F.2d \n1151, 1156 & n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (rejecting an interpretation of FOIA that would “effectively \ntransform section [552(d)] into a congressional declassification scheme,” which would pose \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 22   Filed 09/15/17   Page 12 of 16\n“obvious problems, constitutional and otherwise,” with regard to national security information \nprotected under Exemption 1); Salisbury v. United States, 690 F.2d 966, 971 (D.C. Cir. 1982) \n(“bare discussions by this court and the Congress of NSA’s methods generally cannot be equated \nwith disclosure by the agency itself of its methods of information gathering”); McKinley v. Bd. of \nGovernors of the Fed. Reserve Sys., 849 F. Supp. 2d 47, 60 (D.D.C. 2012) (holding that a \ncongressional committee’s publication of records provided to it in confidence without \nauthorization does not constitute a waiver of the applicable FOIA Exemptions).  Indeed, it would \npose serious Constitutional questions if, as a result of legislative oversight responsibilities, \nmembers of Congress could override the Executive Branch determination that information was \ncurrently and properly classified.  Cf. Dep’t of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  \nNeither FOIA nor the Executive Order contemplate Congress taking on such a role. \nV.  Plaintiffs’ Speculation Does Not Waive the Glomar Response. \nPlaintiffs repeatedly attempt to infer a broad waiver from limited and careful official \nstatements by the Department.  As explained with respect to each statement above, Plaintiffs’ list \nof “officially disclosed” points is equal parts erroneous, irrelevant, and overstated.  This attempt \nis inconsistent with case law requiring precision in a waiver, and it is inconsistent with the \npurposes of FOIA.  Inferring broad waivers from limited public disclosures, after all, perversely \npenalizes transparency and discourages Government efforts to make information public to the \nextent possible consistent with national security and law enforcement interests.   \nFinally, Plaintiffs opine that “the conflicting official claims that underlie this matter \nrender a substantive response by DOJ as a practical necessity as a matter of policy,” and that \ndisclosure would “clarify a public dispute between portions of the Executive Branch.”  Pls.’ MSJ \nat 21.  Plaintiffs’ policy judgments, however, are not at issue.  The Executive Branch has \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 22   Filed 09/15/17   Page 13 of 16\ndetermined that further disclosures at this time would cause harm to national security and to law \nenforcement interests.  Plaintiffs have not met their burden of pointing to official information in \nthe public sphere that precisely matches the information at issue here (the existence or \nnonexistence of responsive FISA records).  There has been no such official confirmation, and \nPlaintiffs’ inferences about what they believe the White House Press Secretary meant to say do \nnot suffice.3  As this Circuit’s precedent makes clear, the purported intelligence expertise of the \nFOIA requestor should not be substituted for that of the responsible federal agency.  See \nPhillippi v. CIA, 655 F.2d 1325, 1331 (D.C. Cir. 1981); Military Audit Project, 656 F.2d at 745; \nAfshar, 702 F.2d at 1130-31. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant Defendant’s Motion for Summary \nJudgment and deny Plaintiff’s motion. \n \n \nDated:  September 15, 2017        Respectfully Submitted, \n \nCHAD READLER \nActing Assistant Attorney General \n   \nMARCIA BERMAN \nAssistant Director, Federal Programs Branch \n \n/s/Amy E.

This action arises from FOIA requests submitted by the Plaintiffs to the Federal \nBureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and DOJ National Security Division (“NSD”).  By letter dated \nMarch 6, 2017, Plaintiffs sought: \n1)  Any orders by the FISC authorizing surveillance of and/or \ncollection of information concerning the Trump Organization, \nPresident Trump, President Trump’s campaign for presidency, or \npeople associated with President Trump. \n2)  Any applications to the FISC seeking authorization for \nsurveillance of and/or collection of information concerning the \nTrump Organization, President Trump, President Trump’s \ncampaign for presidency, or people associated with President \nTrump. \n3)  Any minimization procedures issued by the FISC and that \napplied to any orders issued that fall within the scope of #1 or #2. \n \nSee Declaration of David Hardy, dated July 14, 2017, ¶ 5 & Exhibit A (FOIA Request); \nDeclaration of G. Bradley Weinsheimer, dated July 13, 2017, ¶ 4 & Exhibit A (FOIA Request). \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 3 of 33\n2.  By email dated March 17, 2017, NSD refused to confirm or deny the existence of \nresponsive records pursuant to Exemption 1, explaining that to confirm or deny the existence of \nresponsive records would reveal information that is properly classified under Executive Order \n13526.  See Weinsheimer Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. B (NSD Response). \n3.  On the same day, Plaintiffs appealed the determination to the DOJ Office of \nInformation Policy (“OIP”).  On April 12, 2017, OIP affirmed the determination of NSD – that \nthe existence or non-existence of responsive records is a properly classified fact.  See \nWeinsheimer Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. C (NSD Appeal Determination). \n4.  By letter dated March 16, 2017, the FBI acknowledged receipt of Plaintiffs’ \nrequest, and on April 4, 2017, the FBI also issued a Glomar response.   The FBI’s Glomar \nresponse was based on FOIA Exemptions (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(7)(A), and (b)(7)(E).  See Hardy \nDecl. ¶ 11 & Ex. D. \n5.  G. Bradley Weinsheimer is an original classification authority.  Weinsheimer \nDecl. ¶ 2.  He determined that the information withheld by NSD is protected by Exemption 1.  \nId. ¶¶ 7-12. \n6.  David Hardy is an original classification authority.  Hardy Decl. ¶ 2.  He \ndetermined that the information withheld by FBI is protected by Exemption 1.  Id. ¶¶ 24-33. \n7.  The information withheld pursuant to Exemption 1 is under control of the United \nStates Government, and contains information pertaining to intelligence activities, sources or \nmethods.  See Executive Order 13526 §§ 1.4(c); Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 26-29; Weinsheimer Decl. ¶ 8. \n8.  The information withheld pursuant to Exemption 1 also pertains to foreign \nrelations.  Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 30-33. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 4 of 33\n9.  Mr. Weinsheimer and Mr. Hardy both determined that disclosure of the existence \nor non-existence of responsive records would cause harm to national security, and have \narticulated the harm that could be expected to occur.  Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 26-33; Weinsheimer Decl. \n¶¶ 9-12. \n10.  Mr. Hardy further determined that disclosure of the existence or non-existence of \nresponsive records risks disclosure of intelligence sources and methods and is therefore protected \nby the National Security Act and Exemption 3.   See Hardy Decl. at ¶¶ 34-36. \n11.  Mr. Hardy further determined that FISA applications and FISC orders – when \nthey exist – are records compiled for law enforcement purposes within the meaning of \nExemption 7.  See Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 37-39. \n12.  Mr. Hardy further determined that disclosure of the existence or non-existence of \nresponsive records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings that \nare pending or reasonably anticipated, and that the information is therefore properly withheld \nunder Exemption 7A.   Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 40-45. \n13.  Mr. Hardy further determined that disclosure of the existence or non-existence of \nresponsive records would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations \nand that such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law, and that \nthe information is therefore properly withheld under Exemption 7E.  Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 47-48. \n14.  No authorized Executive Branch official has disclosed the information withheld in \nthis matter.

More specifically, they seek \napplications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (“FISC”) regarding the Trump \nOrganization, President Donald Trump, or the Trump campaign, as well as related FISC orders \nand minimization procedures.  Two components of the Defendant United States Department of \nJustice have properly refused to confirm or deny the existence of responsive records, and no \nauthorized Executive Branch official has disclosed the specific information at issue – namely, the \nexistence of non-existence of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants and orders with \nrespect to these specific individuals or organizations.   \nThe Government’s supporting declarations establish that providing a substantive response \nwould reveal classified information protected by Freedom Information Act (“FOIA”) Exemption \n1, the disclosure of which would cause harm to national security.  The FBI’s declaration further \nestablishes that disclosure of the existence or non-existence of responsive records would reveal \nintelligence sources and methods protected by Exemption 3 and the National Security Act, as \nwell as law enforcement information protected by Exemptions 7(A) and 7(E).  The Court should \ndefer to Defendant’s determination in this regard and grant the Government summary judgment. \nBACKGROUND \n \n  This matter arises from nearly identical FOIA requests submitted to the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation (“FBI”) and DOJ National Security Division (“NSD”) on March 6, 2017, in \nwhich Plaintiffs sought records related to specific individuals and organizations allegedly subject \nto surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”).  Specifically, Plaintiffs \nsought: \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 13 of 33\n1)  Any orders by the FISC authorizing surveillance of and/or \ncollection of information concerning the Trump Organization, \nPresident Trump, President Trump’s campaign for presidency, or \npeople associated with President Trump. \n2)  Any applications to the FISC seeking authorization for \nsurveillance of and/or collection of information concerning the \nTrump Organization, President Trump, President Trump’s \ncampaign for presidency, or people associated with President \nTrump. \n3)  Any minimization procedures issued by the FISC and that \napplied to any orders issued that fall within the scope of #1 or #2. \n \nSee Declaration of David Hardy, dated July 14, 2017, ¶ 5 & Exhibit A (FOIA Request); \nDeclaration of G. Bradley Weinsheimer, dated July 13, 2017, ¶ 4 & Exhibit A (FOIA Request).  \nJMP quoted certain public statements by President Trump and asserted that the requesters “are \npre-emptively asserting that President Trump’s public comments constitute prior official \ndisclosure of the existence of at least one, if not more, FISA warrants.”  Id. \n  By email dated March 17, 2017, NSD refused to confirm or deny the existence of \nresponsive records pursuant to Exemption 1, explaining that to confirm or deny the existence of \nresponsive records would reveal information that is properly classified under Executive Order \n13526.  See Weinsheimer Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. B (NSD Response).  This is known as a “Glomar” \nresponse, and is proper if the fact of the existence or non-existence of agency records falls within \na FOIA exemption.  See Phillippi v. CIA, 546 F.2d 1009, 1011 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (acknowledging \nCIA refusal to confirm or deny existence of records regarding activities of a ship named Hughes \nGlomar Explorer).   On the same day, Plaintiffs appealed the determination to the DOJ Office of \nInformation Policy (“OIP”).  On April 12, 2017, OIP affirmed the determination of NSD – that \nthe existence or non-existence of responsive records is a properly classified fact.  See \nWeinsheimer Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. C (OIP Determination).  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 14 of 33\n  By letter dated March 16, 2017, the FBI acknowledged receipt of Plaintiffs’ request, and \non April 4, 2017, the FBI also issued a Glomar response.   The FBI’s Glomar response was based \non FOIA Exemptions (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(7)(A), and (b)(7)(E).  See Hardy Decl. ¶ 11 & Ex. D. \n  Plaintiffs filed a Complaint on April 4, 2017 and an Amended Complaint was filed on \nApril 15, 2017.  See Compl., ECF No. 1; Am. Compl. ECF No. 5. \nARGUMENT \nI.  STATUTORY STANDARDS  \nA.  The Freedom of Information Act  \nThe “basic purpose” of FOIA reflects a “general philosophy of full agency disclosure \nunless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language.” John Doe Agency v. \nJohn Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146, 152 (1989).  “Congress recognized, however, that public \ndisclosure is not always in the public interest.”  CIA v. Sims, 471 U.S. 159, 166–67 (1985). \nAccordingly, in passing FOIA, “Congress sought ‘to reach a workable balance between the right \nof the public to know and the need of the Government to keep information in confidence to the \nextent necessary without permitting indiscriminate secrecy.’”  John Doe Agency, 493 U.S. at 152 \n(quoting H.R. Rep. No. 89-1497, at 6 (1966), reprinted in 1966 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2418, 2423).  As \nthe D.C. Circuit has recognized, “FOIA represents a balance struck by Congress between the \npublic’s right to know and the [G]overnment’s legitimate interest in keeping certain information \nconfidential.”  Ctr. for Nat’l Sec. Studies v. Dep’t of Justice, 331 F.3d 918, 925 (D.C. Cir. 2003) \n(citing John Doe Agency, 493 U.S. at 152).  \nFOIA mandates disclosure of government records unless the requested information falls \nwithin one of nine enumerated exemptions.  See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b).  “A district court only has \njurisdiction to compel an agency to disclose improperly withheld agency records,” i.e. records \nthat do “not fall within an exemption.”  Minier v. CIA, 88 F.3d 796, 803 (9th Cir. 1996); see also \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 15 of 33\n5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) (providing the district court with jurisdiction only “to enjoin the agency \nfrom withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly \nwithheld from the complainant”); Kissinger v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 445 \nU.S. 136, 150 (1980) (“Under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B)[,] federal jurisdiction is dependent upon a \nshowing that an agency has (1) ‘improperly’; (2) ‘withheld’; (3) ‘agency records.’”).  While \nnarrowly construed, FOIA’s statutory exemptions “are intended to have meaningful reach and \napplication.” John Doe Agency, 493 U.S. at 152; accord DiBacco v.U.S. Army, 795 F.3d 178, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  \nThe courts resolve most FOIA actions on summary judgment.  See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. \nDep't of the Navy, 25 F. Supp. 3d 131, 136 (D.D.C. 2014).  The Government bears the burden of \nproving that the withheld information falls within the exemptions it invokes.  See 5 U.S.C. § \n552(a)(4)(B); King v. Dep’t of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 217 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  A court may grant \nsummary judgment to the Government based entirely on an agency’s declarations, provided they \narticulate “the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific detail, demonstrate that \nthe information withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption, and are not controverted \nby either contrary evidence in the record nor by evidence of agency bad faith.” Military Audit \nProject v. Casey, 656 F.2d 724, 738 (D.C. Cir. 1981); accord Gov’t Accountability Project v. \nFood & Drug Admin., 206 F. Supp. 3d 420, 430 (D.D.C. 2016).  Such declarations are accorded \n“a presumption of good faith, which cannot be rebutted by purely speculative claims[.]” \nSafeCard Servs., Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  \nB.  Special Considerations in National Security Cases  \nThe issues presented in this case directly “implicat[e] national security, a uniquely \nexecutive purview.” Ctr. for Nat’l Sec. Studies, 331 F.3d at 926–27.  While courts review de \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 16 of 33\nnovo an agency’s withholding of information pursuant to a FOIA request, “de novo review in \nFOIA cases is not everywhere alike.”  Ass’n of Retired R.R. Workers, Inc. v. U.S. R.R. Ret. Bd., \n830 F.2d 331, 336 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  Indeed, the courts have specifically recognized the \n“propriety of deference to the executive in the context of FOIA claims which implicate national \nsecurity.”  Ctr. for Nat’l Sec. Studies, 331 F.3d at 927–28; see Ray v. Turner, 587 F.2d 1187, \n1193 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (“[T]he executive ha[s] unique insights into what adverse [e]ffects might \noccur as a result of public disclosure of a particular classified record.”). “[A]ccordingly, the \ngovernment’s ‘arguments needs only be both “plausible” and “logical” to justify the invocation \nof a FOIA exemption in the national security context.’” Unrow Human Rights Litig. Clinic v. \nDep’t of State, 134 F. Supp. 3d 263, 272 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting ACLU v. Dep’t of Def., 628 \nF.3d 612, 624 (D.C. Cir. 2011)).  \nFor these reasons, the courts have “consistently deferred to executive affidavits predicting \nharm to the national security, and have found it unwise to undertake searching judicial review.”  \nCtr. for Nat’l Sec. Studies, 331 F.3d at 927; see Larson v. Dep’t of State, 565 F.3d 857, 865 \n(D.C. Cir. 2009) (“Today we reaffirm our deferential posture in FOIA cases regarding the \n‘uniquely executive purview’ of national security.”); accord Unrow Human Rights Impact Litig. \nClinic, 134 F. Supp. 3d at 272.  Consequently, a reviewing court must afford “substantial \nweight” to agency declarations “in the national security context.” King, 830 F.2d at 217; see \nFitzgibbon v. CIA, 911 F.2d 755, 766 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (holding that the district court erred in \n“perform[ing] its own calculus as to whether or not harm to the national security or to \nintelligence sources and methods would result from disclosure . . . .”); Frugone v. CIA, 169 F.3d \n772, 775 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (because “courts have little expertise in either international diplomacy \nor counterintelligence operations, we are in no position to dismiss the CIA’s facially reasonable \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 17 of 33\nconcerns” about the harm that disclosure could cause to national security).  FOIA “bars the \ncourts from prying loose from the government even the smallest bit of information that is \nproperly classified or would disclose intelligence sources or methods.” Afshar v. Dep’t of State, \n702 F.2d 1125, 1130 (D.C. Cir. 1983). \nC.  The Glomar Response. \nA Glomar response allows the Government to “refuse to confirm or deny the existence of \nrecords where to answer the FOIA inquiry would cause harm cognizable under an FOIA \nexception.”  Wolf v. CIA, 473 F.3d 370, 374 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (quoting Gardels v. CIA, 689 F.2d \n1100, 1103 (D.C. Cir. 1982)); accord Wilner v. NSA, 592 F.3d 60, 68 (2d Cir. 2009) (“The \nGlomar doctrine is well settled as a proper response to a FOIA request because it is the only way \nin which an agency may assert that a particular FOIA statutory exemption covers the ‘existence \nor non-existence of the requested records[.]’” (quoting Phillippi v. CIA, 546 F.2d 1009, 1012 \n(D.C. Cir. 1976)).  In support of a Glomar response, the asserting agency “must explain why it \ncan neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records.”  James Madison Project v. \nDep’t of Justice, 208 F. Supp. 3d 265, 283 (D.D.C. 2016) (quoting Parker v. EOUSA, 852 F. \nSupp. 2d 1, 10 (D.D.C. 2012)).  The agency can satisfy this obligation by providing “public \naffidavit[s] explaining in as much detail as is possible the basis for its claim that it can be \nrequired neither to confirm nor to deny the existence of the requested records.”  Phillippi, 546 \nF.2d at 1013. \nThe courts in this Circuit have consistently upheld Glomar responses where, as here, \nconfirming or denying the existence of records would reveal classified information protected by \nFOIA Exemption 1 or disclose information protected by statute in contravention of FOIA \nExemption 3.  See, e.g., Frugone, 169 F.3d at 774–75 (finding that CIA properly refused to \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 18 of 33\nconfirm or deny the existence of records concerning the plaintiff’s alleged employment \nrelationship with CIA pursuant to Exemptions 1 and 3); Larson, 565 F.3d at 861–62 (upholding \nthe National Security Agency’s use of the Glomar response to the plaintiffs’ FOIA requests \nregarding past violence in Guatemala pursuant to Exemptions 1 and 3); Wheeler v. CIA, 271 F. \nSupp. 2d 132, 140 (D.D.C. 2003) (ruling that CIA properly invoked a Glomar response to a \nrequest for records concerning the plaintiff’s activities as a journalist in Cuba during the 1960s \npursuant to Exemption 1). \nII.  NSD AND FBI PROPERLY REFUSED TO CONFIRM OR DENY THE \nEXISTENCE OF RESPONSIVE RECORDS PURSUANT TO EXEMPTION ONE. \n \nFOIA Exemption 1 exempts from disclosure information that is “specifically authorized \nunder criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national \ndefense or foreign policy” and “are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order.” \n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1).  Under Executive Order 13,526, an agency may withhold information that \nan official with original classification authority has determined to be classified because its \n“unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause identifiable or describable \ndamage to the national security[.]”  Exec. Order No. 13,526 § 1.4, 75 Fed. Reg. 707, 709 (Dec. \n29, 2009).  The information must also “pertain[] to” one of the categories of information \nspecified in the Executive Order, including “intelligence activities (including covert action), \nintelligence sources or methods,” and “foreign relations or foreign activities of the United \nStates.”  Exec. Order 13,526 §§ 1.4(c), (d); see also Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Defense, 715 \nF.3d 937, 941 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“[P]ertains is not a very demanding verb.”).  As addressed \nabove, when it comes to matters affecting national security, the courts afford “substantial \nweight” to an agency’s declarations addressing classified information, King, 830 F.2d at 217, and \ndefer to the expertise of agencies involved in national security and foreign relations.  See \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 19 of 33\nFitzgibbon, 911 F.2d at 766; see also Unrow Human Rights Impact Litig. Clinic, 134 F. Supp. 3d \nat 272. \nDefendants invoked their Glomar responses in order to safeguard currently and properly \nclassified information involving categories of information set forth in Section 1.4 of Executive \nOrder 13,526.  See Hardy Decl. at ¶ 24; Weinsheimer Decl. at ¶ 8.  First, the existence or non-\nexistence of responsive records implicates “intelligence activities (including covert action), \nintelligence sources or methods, or cryptology.” Exec. Order 13,526 §1.4(c).  The supporting \ndeclarations establish that disclosing whether or not the defendant agencies possessed responsive \nrecords would disclose the existence or non-existence of FISA records related to a particular \nindividual or organization.  See Hardy Decl. at ¶¶ 26-29; Weinsheimer Decl. at ¶ 8.  Surveillance \nauthorized by the FISC under any of its authorities is itself an intelligence method, and thus its \nuse in any particular matter thus “pertains to” an intelligence source or method.  Cf. Clapper v. \nAmnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398 (2013) (describing FISA authorities). \nSecond, the Hardy Declaration confirms that presence or non-presence of responsive \nrecords implicates “foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including \nconfidential sources.” Exec. Order 13,526 § 1.4(d).  Verifying whether or not the defendant \nagencies possessed responsive records would tend to reveal a specific type of counterintelligence \nactivity with respect to one or more foreign governments.  Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 30-33.  \nThe supporting declarations demonstrate that confirming whether or not Defendants \npossessed responsive records reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national \nsecurity of the United States by disclosing the existence or non-existence of intelligence sources \nand methods.  See Hardy Decl. at ¶¶ 26-29; Weinsheimer Decl. at ¶¶ 9-12.   As explained in the \nHardy Declaration, “acknowledging the existence or non-existence of records responsive to \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 20 of 33\nPlaintiffs’ request would be tantamount to confirming whether or not the FBI has relied on a \nparticular intelligence activity or method targeted at particular individuals or organizations” and \n“would reveal otherwise non-public information regarding the nature of the FBI’s intelligence \ninterests, priorities, activities, and methods—information that is highly desired by hostile actors \nwho seek to thwart the FBI’s intelligence-gathering mission.”  Id. ¶ 29. “Once an intelligence \nactivity or method – or the fact of its use or non-use in a certain situation – is discovered, its \ncontinued successful use is seriously jeopardized.”  Hardy Decl. ¶ 27; see Weinsheimer Decl.     \n¶ 9.  Moreover, U.S. adversaries review publicly available information to deduce intelligence \nmethods, catalogue information, and take countermeasures, and disclosure of the existence or \nnon-existence of responsive records would reasonably be expected to harm national security.  \nSee id.   \nFurther, the Hardy Declaration establishes that confirming the existence or non-existence \nof responsive documents would reveal information about the United States Government’s \nforeign relations, the disclosure of which could cause damage to national security.  Hardy Decl. \n¶¶ 30-33.   Such disclosure could “weaken, or even sever, the relationship between the United \nStates and its foreign partners (present and future), thus degrading the Government’s ability to \ncombat hostile threats abroad,” and “any confirmation of records could be interpreted by some to \nmean that certain foreign liaison partners were involved in espionage against the United States, \nwhich could have political implications in those and other countries and also make them less \nwilling to cooperate with the U.S. Government in the future.”  Id.1   \n                                                           \n1 To the extent possible on the public record, the declarations explain the harm to national security that would result \nfrom disclosure of the properly classified information at issue here.  If the Court finds that explanation inadequate, \nDefendants could offer further explanation ex parte and in camera. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 21 of 33\nThe Government routinely makes a Glomar response to similar requests for information \nabout particular FISA or surveillance subjects, and Courts routinely uphold such responses.  See, \ne.g., Marrera v. Dep’t of Justice, 622 F. Supp. 51, 53–54 (D.D.C. 1985) (this Court finds that \nOIPR’s refusal to confirm or deny the existence of FISA records pertaining to this particular \nplaintiff to be justified in the interests of national security as part of an overall policy of [the \nExecutive Order] with respect to all FISA FOIA requests.”); Schwarz v. Dep’t of Treasury, 131 \nF. Supp. 2d 142, 149 (D.D.C. 2000) (“The Office properly refused to confirm or deny that it had \nany responsive records maintained under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 \n(FISA) and in non-FISA files relating to various intelligence techniques.”), aff'd, No. 00-5453, \n2001 WL 674636 (D.C. Cir. May 10, 2001); Competitive Enter. Inst. v. NSA, 78 F. Supp. 3d 45, \n60 (D.D.C. 2015) (upholding NSA Glomar response to request for metadata records with respect \nto two particular individuals); Agility Pub. Warehousing Co. K.S.C. v. NSA, 113 F. Supp. 3d 313, \n329 (D.D.C. 2015) (upholding NSA Glomar in response to request for particular surveillance \nrecords); see also Wilner, 592 F.3d at 65 (“Glomar responses are available, when appropriate, to \nagencies when responding to FOIA requests for information obtained under a publicly \nacknowledged intelligence program, such as the TSP, at least when the existence of such \ninformation has not already been publicly disclosed.”). \n  Accordingly, the Glomar response was proper under Exemption One. \n \nIII.   THE GLOMAR RESPONSE WAS PROPER UNDER EXEMPTION THREE AND \nTHE NATIONAL SECURITY ACT \n \n  FOIA Exemption 3 exempts from disclosure records that are “specifically exempted from \ndisclosure by [another] statute” if the relevant statute “requires that the matters be withheld from \nthe public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue” or “establishes particular \ncriteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.”  5 U.S.C. § \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 22 of 33\n552(b)(3)(A).  The Government’s mandate to withhold information under FOIA Exemption 3 is \nbroader than its authority under FOIA Exemption 1, as it does not have to demonstrate that the \ndisclosure will harm national security.  See Sims, 471 U.S. at 167; Gardels, 689 F.2d at 1106–07. \nInstead, “the sole issue for decision is the existence of a relevant statute and the inclusion of \nwithheld material within the statute’s coverage.  It is particularly important to protect intelligence \nsources and methods from public disclosure.”  Morley v. CIA, 508 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. \n2007).  In analyzing the propriety of a withholding made pursuant to FOIA Exemption 3, the \nCourt need not examine “the detailed factual contents of specific documents[.]”  Id.   \nDefendants invoke Section 102A(i)(1) of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended \n(now codified at 50 U.S.C. § 3024(i)(1)) (“NSA”), which requires the Director of National \nIntelligence to “protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.”2  It is \nwell-established that Section 102A qualifies as a withholding statute for the purposes of FOIA \nExemption 3.  See, e.g., ACLU v. DOD, 628 F.3d at 619.  In fact, the Supreme Court has \nrecognized the “wide-ranging authority” provided by the NSA to protect intelligence sources and \nmethods.  See Sims, 471 U.S. at 169–70, 177, 180; see Halperin v. CIA, 629 F.2d 144, 147 (D.C. \nCir. 1980) (explaining that the only question for the court is whether the agency has shown that \nresponding to a FOIA request “could reasonably be expected to lead to unauthorized disclosure \nof intelligence sources and methods”).  The NSA has been properly invoked to withhold \ninformation about FISA and other surveillance techniques. See, e.g., Agility Pub. Warehousing \nCo. K.S.C., 113 F. Supp. 3d at 329 \n                                                           \n2 The courts have recognized that not just the Director of National Intelligence, but also other agencies may rely \nupon the amended NSA to withhold records under FOIA.  See, e.g., Larson, 565 F.3d at 862–63, 865; Talbot v. CIA, \n578 F. Supp. 2d 24, 28–29 n.3 (D.D.C. 2008). \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 23 of 33\nThe Hardy Declaration attests that Defendants have properly invoked the Glomar \nresponse to protect classified information under the NSA and FOIA Exemption 3.  See Hardy \nDecl. at ¶¶ 34-36.  For the reasons discussed above with regard to Exemption 1, confirming the \nexistence or non-existence of responsive records could divulge information about the existence \nor non-existence of intelligence sources and methods protected from disclosure under the NSA. \nId.  Indeed, the declaration explains that a substantive response to Plaintiffs’ request could reveal \nwhether or not the United States Government has intelligence sharing relationships with foreign \nliaison partners.  See id.  Accordingly, the FBI has demonstrated the appropriateness of the \nGlomar response under FOIA Exemption 3.  \nIV.  THE GLOMAR RESPONSE WAS PROPER UNDER EXEMPTION 7(A) \nFOIA Exemption 7 protects from disclosure all “records or information compiled for law \nenforcement purposes” that could reasonably be expected to cause one of the six harms outlined \nin the Exemption’s subparts. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7).  “To fall within any of the exemptions under \nthe umbrella of Exemption 7, a record must have been ‘compiled for law enforcement \npurposes.’” Pub. Emps. for Envtl. Responsibility v. U.S. Section, Int’l Boundary & Water \nComm’n, U.S.-Mexico, 740 F.3d 195, 202 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)).  \n“According to the Supreme Court, the term ‘compiled’ in Exemption 7 requires that information \nbe created, gathered, or used by an agency for law enforcement purposes at some time before the \nagency invokes the exemption.” Id. at 203. \nExemption 7(A) “exempts from disclosure ‘records or information compiled for law \nenforcement purposes . . . to the extent that the production of [the] records or information . . . \ncould reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.’”  Citizens for \nResponsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. Dep’t of Justice, 746 F.3d 1082, 1096 (D.C. Cir. 2014) \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 24 of 33\n(hereinafter “CREW”) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A)).  “Exemption 7(A) reflects the \nCongress’s recognition that ‘law enforcement agencies ha[ve] legitimate needs to keep certain \nrecords confidential, lest the agencies be hindered in their investigations or placed at a \ndisadvantage when it [comes] time to present their case.’”  Id. (quoting NLRB v. Robbins Tire & \nRubber Co., 437 U.S. 214, 224 (1978)).  “To justify withholding, [an agency] must therefore \ndemonstrate that ‘disclosure (1) could reasonably be expected to interfere with (2) enforcement \nproceedings that are (3) pending or reasonably anticipated.’”  Id. (quoting Mapother v. Dep’t of \nJustice, 3 F.3d 1533, 1540 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). \nAn ongoing investigation typically triggers Exemption 7(A).  See CREW, 746 F.3d at \n1098 (quoting Juarez v. Dep’t of Justice, 518 F.3d 54, 59 (D.C. Cir. 2008)).  “In the typical \ncase,” therefore, “the requested records relate to a specific individual or entity that is the subject \nof the ongoing investigation, making the likelihood of interference readily apparent.”  Id. \nHere, the Hardy Declaration justifies the FBI’s use of Exemption 7(A) to protect the \ncurrently undisclosed fact of the existence or non-existence of any investigative records that \nwould be responsive to Plaintiffs’ requests.   As an initial matter, FBI records related to FISA \nrecords are plainly compiled for law enforcement purposes.  As the Hardy Declaration \nestablishes, the “only circumstance under which the FBI can request – and the Department of \nJustice can and would seek on the FBI’s behalf – a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) \norder is when the FBI is conducting an authorized, predicated national security investigation \nwithin the scope of its law enforcement and foreign intelligence responsibilities.”  Hardy Decl. ¶ \n39.   Accordingly, FISA applications and FISC orders – when they exist – are records compiled \nfor law enforcement purposes. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 25 of 33\nAdditionally, the information requested purportedly relates to an ongoing investigation.  \nPlaintiffs describe their request as relating to the FBI’s investigation into the Russian \ngovernment’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.  Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 19, 42; Am. \nCompl. ¶ 8 (discussing FBI’s acknowledgement of investigation into Russian interference in the \nelection, including any attempts to coordinate with President Trump’s campaign).  Any sort of \ninvestigation involving such FISA records would be the sort of active investigation protected by \nExemption 7(A).  See, e.g., People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. NIH, 745 F.3d 535, \n541 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (Exemption 7’s threshold requirement satisfied in a Glomar response case \nbecause FOIA requester did not dispute that “any responsive documents,” if they existed, “would \nconstitute records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes”). \nThe Hardy Declaration further describes the harm to an investigation that may result: \nConfirming or denying the existence or non-existence of \nresponsive records would reveal non-public information about the \nfocus, scope, and conduct of that investigation.  Specifically, it \nwould reveal whether or not specific investigative techniques have \nbeen used; when and to what extent they were used, if they were; \ntheir relative value or benefit if they were used; and the targets \nthey were used against, if any.  None of this information about the \nRussian interference investigation has been publicly disclosed and \nprematurely disclosing it here would give targets and others intent \non interfering with the FBI’s investigative efforts the information \nnecessary to:  take defensive actions to conceal criminal activities; \ndevelop and implement countermeasures to elude detection; \nsuppress, destroy, or fabricate evidence; and identify potential \nwitnesses or sources, exposing them to harassment, intimidation, \ncoercion, and/or physical threats.  Accordingly, to the extent that \nPlaintiffs’ request seeks records in relation to this investigation, \nconfirming or denying the existence or non-existence of responsive \nrecords could reasonably be expected to adversely affect it. \n \nHardy Decl. ¶¶ 43-44.  Moreover, to the extent the request implicates some investigation other \nthan that alleged by Plaintiffs, revealing such an investigation prematurely would cause the same \ntype of harm.  Id. ¶ 44.  Accordingly, a Glomar response is available under these circumstances \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 26 of 33\nto protect the integrity of confidential law-enforcement investigations, and to therefore prevent \nharm cognizable by FOIA Exemption 7(A).  See, e.g., Cozen O’Connor v. Dep’t of Treasury, \n570 F. Supp. 2d 749, 788 (E.D. Pa. 2008); see also CREW, 746 F.3d at 1096 (“Exemption 7(A) \nreflects the Congress’s recognition that ‘law enforcement agencies ha[ve] legitimate needs to \nkeep certain records confidential, lest the agencies be hindered in their investigations or placed at \na disadvantage when it [comes] time to present their case.’” (quoting Robbins Tire, 437 U.S. at \n224)). \nFor these reasons, the FBI’s Glomar response is justified by Exemption 7(A).   \nV.  THE GLOMAR RESPONSE WAS PROPER UNDER EXEMPTION 7(E) \nExemption 7(E) authorizes withholding of information compiled for law enforcement \npurposes if release of the information “would disclose techniques and procedures for law \nenforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement \ninvestigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk \ncircumvention of the law.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E).  Congress intended that Exemption 7(E) \nprotect law enforcement techniques and procedures from disclosure, as well as techniques and \nprocedures used in all manner of investigations after crimes or other incidents have occurred.  \nSee, e.g., PHE, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 983 F.2d 248, 250–51 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  “[T]he \nexemption is written in broad and general terms” to avoid assisting lawbreakers.  Mayer Brown \nLLP v. IRS, 562 F.3d 1190, 1193 (D.C. Cir. 2009). \nThe terms of the statute provide that, to withhold records that would reveal law \nenforcement “guidelines,” an agency must show that “disclosure could reasonably be expected to \nrisk circumvention of the law.”  It is not clear whether this requirement also applies to \nwithholding of records that would reveal “techniques and procedures.”  See CREW, 746 F.3d at \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 27 of 33\n1102 n.8.  However, the D.C. Circuit has stressed that the risk-of-circumvention requirement sets \na “low bar.”  Blackwell v. FBI, 646 F.3d 37, 42 (D.C. Cir. 2011); accord Gosen v. USCIS, 75 F. \nSupp. 3d 279, 291 (D.D.C. 2014) (describing the risk-of-circumvention requirement as a “low \nbar”).  Given the low threshold for meeting the risk-of-circumvention requirement, and given \nthat disclosure of law enforcement techniques and procedures usually has obvious potential to \ncreate a risk of circumvention, it generally makes little practical difference whether the risk-of-\ncircumvention requirement applies to all of Exemption 7(E) or only the part dealing with \n“guidelines.”  See Pub. Emps. for Envtl. Responsibility, 740 F.3d at 204 n.4.  In any event, FBI’s \nGlomar response under Exemption 7(E) meets the requirement if it applies. \nHere, the Hardy Declaration establishes that disclosure of existence or non-existence of \nresponsive records would reveal a law enforcement technique or procedure.  “How the FBI \napplies its investigative resources (or not) against a particular allegation, report of criminal \nactivity, or perceived threat is itself a law enforcement technique or procedure that the FBI \nprotects.”  Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 47-48.  Such an acknowledgment of the existence or non-existence of \nresponsive records “would reveal when and under what circumstances the FBI relies upon FISA-\nauthorized techniques in an investigation,” and “provide pieces of information that adversaries \ncould use to ascertain at what point, and against whom we might use particular techniques.”    \nHardy Decl. ¶ 48.   “Armed with this information, adversaries could glean significant insight into \nthe activities likely to attract – or not attract – the FBI’s law enforcement attention.  These \nindividuals would then be able alter their behavior to avoid attention by law enforcement, \nmaking it more difficult for the FBI to be proactive in assessing threats and investigating \ncrimes.”    Id.  Accordingly, the FBI properly invoked Exemption 7(E). \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 28 of 33\nVI.  DEFENDANTS HAVE NOT OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE \nEXISTENCE OR NON-EXISTENCE OF RESPONSIVE RECORDS \n \nAs a general matter, under FOIA, “when an agency has officially acknowledged \notherwise exempt information through prior disclosure, the agency has waived its right to claim \nan exemption with respect to that information.”  Am. Civil Liberties Union v. CIA, 710 F.3d 422, \n426 (D.C. Cir. 2013).  This “official acknowledgement” principle applies to the Glomar context, \nso a requester “can overcome a Glomar response by showing that the agency has already \ndisclosed the fact of the existence (or non-existence) of responsive records, since that is the \npurportedly exempt information that a Glomar response is designed to protect.”  Id. at 427.  But \nthe plaintiff “must bear the initial burden of pointing to specific information in the public domain \nthat appears to duplicate that being withheld.”  Id. (quoting Wolf, 473 F.3d at 378).   \nThe D.C. Circuit has narrowly construed the “official acknowledgment” doctrine, however, and \nto bring such a challenge plaintiff must satisfy three stringent criteria, none of which are satisfied \nhere. \n“First, the information requested must be as specific as the information previously \nreleased.”  Wolf, 473 F.3d at 378 (quoting Fitzgibbon, 911 F.2d at 765).  “Prior disclosure of \nsimilar information does not suffice; instead, the specific information sought by the plaintiff must \nalready be in the public domain by official disclosure.  This insistence on exactitude by the D.C. \nCircuit recognizes ‘the Government’s vital interest in information relating to national security \nand foreign affairs.”  Id. (quoting Pub. Citizen v. Dep’t of State, 11 F.3d 198, 203 (D.C. Cir. \n1993); Competitive Enter. Inst., 78 F. Supp. 3d at 54 (“Plaintiffs in this case must therefore point \nto specific information in the public domain establishing that the NSA has [the claimed \ninformation.]”).  The information already released must also be of the same level of generality as \nthe information sought—broadly crafted disclosures, even on the same general topic, do not \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 29 of 33\nwaive the Glomar response.  See, e.g., Afshar, 702 F.2d at 1133 (previous disclosure that plaintiff \nhad “‘created a problem’ in U.S.-Iranian relations” was too general to justify releasing \ndocuments detailing the nature of that problem). \n“Second, the information requested must match the information previously disclosed.”  \nWolf, 473 F.3d at 378 (quoting Fitzgibbon, 911 F.2d at 765).  If there are “substantive \ndifferences” between the two, an official-acknowledgment claim must fail.  ACLU v. DOD, 628 \nF.3d at 621.  That is true even if the previous disclosures are on the same topic.  See, e.g., \nCompetitive Enter. Inst., 78 F. Supp. 3d at 57 (a Presidential statement that “the intelligence \ncommunity . . . is looking at phone numbers and durations of calls,” was not adequately \ncongruent with a request seeking the companies that had provided that data to U.S. intelligence \nagencies); Wolf, 473 F.3d at 379 (holding that CIA could not claim Glomar protection when it \nhad previously read excerpts from materials sought into the record during congressional \nhearing). \n“Third, . . . the information requested must already have been made public through an \nofficial and documented disclosure.”  Id. at 378 (quoting Fitzgibbon, 911 F.2d at 765).  Key to \nthis element is that the source must be official; non-governmental releases, or anonymous leaks \nby government officials or former government officials do not qualify.  See, e.g., ACLU v. DOD, \n628 F.3d at 621-22; Agility Public Warehousing Co.  K.S.C., 113 F. Supp. 3d at 330 n.8; \nCompetitive Enter. Inst., 78 F. Supp. 3d at 55.  In other words, “mere public speculation, no \nmatter how widespread,” cannot undermine the agency’s Glomar prerogative.  Wolf, 473 F.3d at \n378.  And Congressional statements also cannot waive Executive Branch classification or other \nExemptions.  See Military Audit Project v. Casey, 656 F.2d 724, 742-745 (D.C. Cir. 1981); see \nalso Moore v. CIA, 666 F.3d 1330, 1333 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“[W]e do not deem ‘official’ a \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 30 of 33\ndisclosure made by someone other than the agency from which the information is being \nsought.”) \nPlaintiffs cannot meet their burden of pointing to an official disclosure of the information \nthey seek.  The Hardy Declaration and the Weinsheimer Declaration establish that no authorized \ngovernment official has disclosed the precise information withheld.   See Hardy Decl. ¶ 17; \nWeinsheimer Decl. ¶ 13.   \nThe Amended Complaint cites a number of public statements that Plaintiffs allege \nconstitute official acknowledgement of properly classified facts.  See Am. Compl. ¶ 11 (“The \ncomments of President Trump and Press Secretary Sean Spicer constitute prior official disclosure \nof the existence of surveillance orders issued by the FISC and that authorized collection of \ninformation that, at a minimum, incidentally implicated President Trump and/or his associates. \nThis lawsuit ultimately will seek to determine the circumstances in which specific \nsurveillance/collection orders were issued by the FISC.”).  But these cited public statements \nabout an investigation and alleged surveillance do not come close to meeting the standard for \nofficial acknowledgement of the information sought by Plaintiffs.   \nPrimarily, Plaintiffs appear to rely on President Trump’s four-part post on Twitter on \nMarch 4, 2017:  \n•  “Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my \"wires tapped\" in Trump Tower just \nbefore the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!” \n•  “Is it legal for a sitting President to be \"wire tapping\" a race for president prior to \nan election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!” \n•  “I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President \nObama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!” \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 31 of 33\n•  “How low has President Obama gone to tapp [sic] my phones during the very \nsacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!” \nAvailable at https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump; see also Am. Compl. ¶ 7.  This series of \ntweets contains a constellation of specific opinions and allegations regarding wiretapping, \nincluding that (1) his phones were tapped; (2) at Trump Tower; (3) in October just prior to the \nelection; (4) on the orders of President Obama; and (5) that such actions were comparable to \n“Nixon/Watergate.”  Even assuming these tweets are official statements, nowhere do these \ntweets mention FISA, the FISC, any targets other than President Trump, or the involvement of \nDOJ or FBI.  Moreover, the statements are limited to a particular time, a particular target, and a \nparticular place, in contrast to plaintiff’s FOIA request.  Thus, the statements are not as specific \nand do not match the information sought in this FOIA request.3  The follow-up statements to the \nmedia by the President or his Press Secretary as cited in the complaint also do not match the \nspecific information sought by Plaintiffs here.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 7-11.   \nAs explained above, and as plaintiff notes, the FBI has also publicly disclosed generally \nthe existence of an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and the \nnature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian \ngovernment.  Hardy Decl. ¶ 19.  This ongoing investigation is overseen by Special Counsel \nRobert Mueller.  The Government has not confirmed or denied the use of FISA in connection \nwith that investigation, much less the use of FISA pertaining to any particular individual or \norganization.  See id. \n                                                           \n3 Moreover, FBI Director James Comey later denied the existence of any information to support the  President’s \ntweets, stating that “With respect to the president's tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior \nadministration, I have no information that supports those tweets and we have looked carefully inside the FBI. The \nDepartment of Justice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the Department of Justice and \nall its components.”  Hardy Decl. ¶ 15.  Had plaintiff more specifically tied his FOIA request to the information in \nthe tweets, he likely would have received a no-records response from the FBI and DOJ.  \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 13   Filed 07/14/17   Page 32 of 33\nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant the Defendants’ Motion for Summary \nJudgment. \n \nDated:  July 14, 2017         Respectfully Submitted, \n \nCHAD READLER \nActing Assistant Attorney General \n   \nMARCIA BERMAN \nAssistant Director, Federal Programs Branch \n \n/s/Amy E.

Defendant  released  412  pages,  which  constituted  “all \nresponsive, non-exempt and reasonably segregable information subject to FOIA,” including any \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”) applications related to Carter Page.  See Def.’s \nFacts ¶ 11; see also Pls.’ Mot. at 2.  The released pages were heavily redacted and identified a \nrange of FOIA exemptions to justify the withholdings.  See https://vault.fbi.gov/d1-release/d1-\nrelease (last visited February 24, 2020).   \nPlaintiffs disputed Defendant’s redaction of 21 of the 412 pages (“the Pages”) based on \npost-disclosure events.  See Pls.’ Mot. at 1.  Nearly two months after releasing the 412 pages, the \nWhite House issued a Press Release stating that President Trump had “directed the Office of the \nDirector of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice (including the FBI) to provide for \nthe immediate declassification of the following materials:  (1) pages 10-12 and 17-34 of the June \n2017 application to the FISA court in the matter of Carter W. Page.”  See Press Release, White \nHouse  Press  Secretary  (Sept.  17,  2018),  https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-\nstatements/statement-press-secretary-34/  (last  visited  February  24,  2020)  [hereinafter  Press \nRelease]; see also Pls.’ Mot. at 4.  Notwithstanding the Press Release, Defendant continued to \nwithhold the Pages pursuant to Exemptions 1, 3, 6, 7(A), 7(C), 7(D), and 7(E).  See Def.’s Mot. at \n13.   \nThe parties moved for summary judgment.  See Def.’s Mot.; Pls.’ Mot.  With respect to \nExemption 1, Plaintiffs argued that the Press Release reflected a presidential order to declassify \nthe referenced Pages in full.  See Pls.’ Mot. at 4.  Defendant countered that there had been “no \npresidential declassification order, and the President has publicly indicated that he is not requiring \ndeclassification at this time, much less full disclosure.”  See Def.’s Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot., ECF No. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 62   Filed 03/03/20   Page 3 of 7\n43 [hereinafter Def.’s Opp’n], at 1.1  Further, Defendant insisted that the Press Release is, \n“indisputably, a statement from the press secretary, not an order from the President.”  Id. at 3.   \nThe court denied both motions for summary judgment, but allowed Defendant to submit a \nrenewed motion and an additional declaration providing information about “(1) the effect, if any, \nthe Press Release and the President’s subsequent tweets (including the meeting referenced in the \ntweets) had on the classification status of the Pages, and (2) whether the agency is authorized to \nassert [other Exemptions] to shield portions of the Pages from disclosure.”  Mem. Op. at 6.  \nDefendant accepted the court’s invitation, and now pending is Defendant’s Renewed Motion for \nSummary Judgment.  Def.’s Renewed Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 52 [hereinafter Def.’s Renewed \nMot.].   \nII. \n  In a FOIA case, “the agency bears the burden of justifying its decision to withhold \nrequested information.”  King v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 217 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  Here, \nthe agency withheld the Pages pursuant to Exemption 1, which protects against disclosures that \nare “(A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret \nin the interest of national defense or foreign policy and (B) are in fact properly classified pursuant \n                                                           \n1 Defendant’s later argument relied on presidential tweets coming four days after the Press Release.  The two tweets \nwere as follows: \n \nI met with the DOJ concerning the declassification of various UNREDACTED \ndocuments.  They agreed to release them but stated that so doing may have a \nperceived negative impact on the Russia probe.  Also, key Allies’ [sic] called to \nask not to release.  Therefore, the Inspector General . . . has been asked to \nreview these documents on an expedited basis.  I believe he will move quickly \non this (and hopefully other things which he is looking at).  In the end I can \nalways declassify if it proves necessary.  Speed is very important to me – and \neveryone! \n \nDonald  J.  Trump  (@realDonald  Trump),  TWITTER  (Sept.  21,  2018,  10:35  AM), \nhttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1043146627576258561;  Donald  J.  Trump  (@realDonaldTrump), \nTWITTER (Sept. 21, 2018, 10:41 AM), https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1043148165883416576.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 62   Filed 03/03/20   Page 4 of 7\nto such Executive order.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1).  Exemption 1 cannot apply to information that has \nbeen declassified. \nA. \nIn its previous opinion, the court found that the Press Release was ambiguous as to whether \nit had the effect of a declassification order.  Mem. Op. at 4.  Recognizing that “[t]he agency bears \nthe burden to show that Exemption 1 applies” and to “dispel any ambiguity,” the court afforded \nDefendant an opportunity to “establish that the Pages were not declassified in full.”  Id.  Defendant \nhas now done so.   \nWith  its  renewed  motion,  Defendant  submitted  a  declaration  from  G.  Bradley \nWeinsheimer, an Associate Deputy Attorney General in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General \n(“ODAG”) at the DOJ.  Decl. of G. Bradley Weinsheimer, ECF No. 52-1 [hereinafter Weinsheimer \nDecl.].  In that declaration, Weinsheimer affirms that “[a]fter the press secretary statement was \nissued, ODAG personnel, including [Weinsheimer], consulted with personnel at the White House \nabout the matters discussed in that statement, including potential declassification of certain \ndocuments related to the Carter Page FISA applications and orders,” and “DOJ did not receive at \nany time a declassification order related to the materials remaining at issue in this case.”  Id. ¶ 4; \nsee also id. ¶ 5 (stating that, during the consultations with the White House, the “DOJ was informed \nthat there was no order requiring immediate declassification or disclosure of those documents”).  \nFurther, Weinsheimer explains, in May 2019, the President delegated to the Attorney General of \nthe United States the  authority to  “declassify  documents as part of his ongoing  review of \nintelligence activities relating to the campaigns in the 2016 Presidential election and certain related \nmatters,” and to date, “the Attorney General has not exercised that declassification authority over \nthe materials at issue in this case.”  Id. ¶ 5. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 62   Filed 03/03/20   Page 5 of 7\nAfter reviewing the Weinsheimer Declaration, the court is satisfied that Defendant has met \nits burden of establishing that the Press Release from September 17, 2018, did not constitute or \nreflect a presidential order to declassify the Pages.  Accordingly, the Pages were properly withheld \npursuant to Exemption 1.  See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1).2       \nB. \n  Plaintiffs try to avoid this conclusion by asserting that the Weinsheimer Declaration fails \nto explain why the Press Release itself “does not qualify as a declassification order as a matter of \nlaw,” Pls.’ Opp’n to Def.’s Renewed Mot., ECF No. 53 [hereinafter Pls.’ Opp’n to Renewed Mot.], \nat 4, and “does not demonstrate that DOJ received authorized instructions that the [Press Release] \nhad been rescinded or otherwise postponed as a matter of law,” id. at 3 (cleaned up).  This argument \nmisses the point.  Plaintiffs assume that the Press Release is, in fact, as a declassification order and \nthat it is Defendant’s job to prove otherwise, or alternatively, to prove that the order was rescinded.   \nBut the court never held that the Press Release was a declassification order or its equivalent.  To \nthe contrary, the court observed that the Press Release’s text “suggests” it might be or “would \nappear” to be a declassification order or reflect one, but ultimately found the Press Release and the \nevents that followed to be ambiguous.  See Mem. Op. at 4–6.  For that reason, the court ordered \nthe DOJ to “provide information about [ ] the effect, if any, the Press Release and the President’s \nsubsequent tweets . . . had on the classification status of the Pages.”  Id. at 6.  DOJ’s declaration \nnow makes clear that the Press Release was not a declassification order.3  See Weinsheimer Decl.  \nPlaintiffs’ protestations to the contrary, which lack any evidentiary support, therefore ring hollow. \n                                                           \n2 Except as discussed below, Plaintiffs do not dispute that the withheld material from the Pages satisfies the \nrequirements of Exemption 1.   \n3 Because the court is satisfied that the DOJ has properly withheld the Pages at issue pursuant to Exemption 1, it need \nnot address whether the DOJ was entitled to withhold the Pages pursuant to any other statutory exemptions.  See Def.’s \nRenewed Mot. at 4–6; Pls.’ Opp’n to Renewed Mot. at 9–10.    \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 62   Filed 03/03/20   Page 6 of 7\nIII. \n  In a supplemental filing, Plaintiffs state that the Pages are not the only documents that \nremain  in  dispute  in  this  litigation.    They  write:  “[T]he  Plaintiffs  did  not  concede  the \nappropriateness of the remainder of the redactions and/or withholdings made by the government \nwith respect to the other 391 pages of the Page FISA warrants.”  Pls.’ Resp. to Def.’s Status Report, \nECF No. 60.  That is news to the court.   \nOn October 19, 2018, Defendant filed a comprehensive motion for summary judgment that \ndefended its search; its withholding and redaction of records based on Exemptions 1, 3, 6, 7(A),  \n7(C), 7(D), and 7(E); and its invocation of a Glomar response as to other records.  See generally \nDef.’s Mot. Plaintiffs opposed Defendant’s motion and filed a partial cross-motion for summary \njudgment.  Pls.’ Mot.; Pls.’ Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 42 [hereinafter Pls.’ \nOpp’n].  In their papers, Plaintiffs stated: \nUpon review of the Government’s Motion and its supporting sworn \ndeclarations, the Plaintiffs have chosen to concede the adequacy of \nthe  searches  conducted,  as  well  as  the  Government’s  Glomar \nresponses . . . .  The Plaintiffs have confined their Cross-Motion for \nPartial  Summary  Judgment  (“Cross-Motion”),  as  well  as  their \nMemorandum  in  Opposition  to  the  Defendant’s  Motion  for \nSummary Judgment, strictly to the legal appropriateness of the \nredactions and withholdings made to the documents that have been \nproduced as part of this litigation.   \n \nPls.’ Mot. at 1; Pls.’ Opp’n at 1 (same).  As a consequence of Plaintiffs having “confined” their \narguments, the court wrote in its earlier opinion that “Defendant’s continued redaction of 21 of the \n412 pages is the sole contested issue in the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment.”  \nSee Mem. Op. at 2 (emphasis added).  Plaintiffs never sought to disabuse the court of the notion \nthat the “sole contested issue” pertained to redaction of the Pages—until now.  Thus, it is for the \nfirst time in their supplemental filing, submitted after the second round of summary judgment \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 62   Filed 03/03/20   Page 7 of 7\nbriefing closed and permitted by the court only to address new developments, that Plaintiffs \nsuggest that there is more left to resolve in this case.  There is not.  Plaintiffs had every opportunity \nto oppose and cross-move as to any and all issues raised in Defendant’s original motion for \nsummary judgment, or as to any other issue they wished.  They chose instead to contest only one \ndiscrete issue.  Plaintiffs cannot now revive what they long ago abandoned.  See Hayes v. District \nof Columbia, 923 F. Supp. 2d 44, 51 (D.D.C. 2013) (treating a claim as conceded when the plaintiff \ndid not “specifically dispute the defendant’s argument” regarding the claim in her opposition); \nValles-Hall v. Ctr. For Nonprofit Advancement, 481 F. Supp. 2d 118, 140 (D.D.C. 2007) (deeming \nabandoned claims not raised by the plaintiff in her revised opposition to the defendant’s summary \njudgment motion); Brodie v. Burwell, No. 15-322 (JEB), 2016 WL 3248197, at *14 (D.D.C. June \n13, 2016) (treating as abandoned a claim that a party only mentions “in passing” in his opposition \nmotion). Therefore, having resolved the sole remaining issue in the second summary judgment \nmotion, the court considers this matter closed.   \nIV. \nFor the foregoing reasons, the court grants Defendant’s Renewed Motion for Summary \nJudgment, ECF No. 52, and enters judgment in favor of Defendant.  A separate, final order \naccompanies this Memorandum Opinion.       \n \n \n                                                  \nDated:  March 3, 2020          Amit P.

The underlying FOIA requests specifically \nsought copies of any orders issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n(“FISC”) authorizing surveillance of President Donald J. Trump (“President Trump”), his \npresidential campaign, his private company, or his associates, as well as any relevant \napplications for orders submitted to the FISC and minimization procedures issued by the \nFISC.  \nPresently before this Court for consideration is DOJ’s Motion for Summary Judgment \n(“Motion”). Upon review of the Government’s Motion and its supporting sworn \ndeclarations, the Plaintiffs have chosen to concede the adequacy of the searches \nconducted, as well as the Government’s Glomar responses with respect to the existence \nor non-existence of responsive records other than those already produced. The Plaintiffs \nhave confined their Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (“Cross-Motion”), as \nwell as their Memorandum in Opposition to the Defendant’s Motion for Summary \nJudgment, strictly to the legal appropriateness of the redactions and withholdings made to \nthe documents that have been produced as part of this litigation.  \nFor the reasons set forth in detail below, this Court should grant the Plaintiffs’  \nCross-Motion and deny DOJ’s Motion in part.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nThe convoluted drama underlying the factual background of this proceeding was \nlargely set forth in two documents: the First Amended Complaint, see Dkt. #5 at ¶¶7-32 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41   Filed 11/09/18   Page 7 of 22\n(filed April 15, 2017), and the Statement of Material Facts in Support of Defendant’s \nMotion for Summary Judgment, see Dkt. #40 (filed October 19, 2018)(“Statement of \nMaterial Facts”).  \nIn the interest of not repeating information already set forth before this Court in \nDOJ’s Statement of Material Facts, the Plaintiffs incorporate that document herein by \nreference. However, the Plaintiffs are only incorporating the factual statements in relation \nto paragraphs 1-9 and 11, and only to the extent that they do not constitute legal \ncharacterizations and conclusions regarding the adequacy of DOJ’s searches for \nresponsive records or the appropriateness of its invocations of particular FOIA \nexemptions. \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n \nSummary judgment pursuant to FRCP 56 should be awarded to a movant if “the \npleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that \nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). In evaluating the appropriateness of \nsummary judgment, the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the \nnon-moving party, Holcomb v. Powell, 433 F.3d 889, 895 (D.C. Cir. 2006), accepting the \nnon-moving party’s evidence as true and drawing “all justifiable inferences” in the \nnonmoving party’s favor. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986). \nHowever, the Court need not rely on any “conclusory allegations unsupported by factual \ndata,” Pub. Citizen Health Research Group v. FDA, 185 F.3d 898, 908 (D.C. Cir. 1999) \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted), and should only find that “there is a \n  2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41   Filed 11/09/18   Page 8 of 22\ngenuine issue for trial” where “there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party \nfor a jury to return a verdict for that party.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249 (citation omitted). \nII. THE PLAINTIFFS ARE ENTITLED TO PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nWITH RESPECT TO REDACTIONS MADE TO 21 PAGES IN THE JUNE \n2017 FISC APPLICATION OR, ALTERNATIVELY, TO LIMITED \nDISCOVERY TO RESOLVE ANY GENUINE ISSUES OF MATERIAL FACT \nIN DISPUTE REGARDING THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE \nPRESIDENT’S DECLASSIFICATION ORDER \n \nA.  The President’s Declassification Order Remains In Effect \n \nThis litigation presents an arguably-unprecedented legal scenario regarding the \nimpact of a presidential declassification order that was issued while the present case was \nalready in briefing. The undersigned are not aware of any previous case that has \npresented a court with this particular situation.  \nOn July 20, 2018, DOJ produced 412 pages of records memorializing four separate \napplications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (“FISC”) for authorization to \nconduct surveillance of Carter W. Page (“Mr. Page”). https://www.usatoday.com/story/ \nnews/2018/07/21/fbi-releases-carter-page-fisa-records/813984002/ (last accessed \nOctober 22, 2018). This was the first time the U.S. Government had ever released to the \npublic FISC records regarding surveillance of a specific individual. \nAs the Government states in its opening brief, see Defendant’s Memorandum of \nPoints and Authorities in Support of Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment at 15-\n31 (Dkt. #40)(filed October 19, 2018)(“Def’s Memo”), redactions were applied relying \nupon Exemptions 1, 3, 6 and 7 and 186 pages were withheld in their entirety in reliance \nupon Exemption 1, 3 and 7. If the present case had proceeded in a manner similar to most \nroutine FOIA litigation, the briefing on this matter would be simpler and limited only to \nthe question of the legal sufficiency of the Government’s affidavit(s) with respect to \n  3 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41   Filed 11/09/18   Page 9 of 22\nthose redactions and withholdings. Alas, nothing in the era of President Trump is ever \nsimple or routine. \nOn September 17, 2018, President Trump exercised his constitutional authority to \norder the immediate declassification of 21 specific pages (“the Pages”) from the 412-page \nproduction. https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-\n34/ (last accessed October 22, 2018). The Pages are derived from the June 2017 FISC \napplication regarding Mr. Page.  \nTo date, that official declassification order (“the Order”) by President Trump has not \nbeen rescinded in any clear or explicit manner. On its own and as a matter of law, the \nOrder nullifies the ability of the Government to justify redactions from the Pages and \nwarrants summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs with respect to the Pages. \nThe Government nonetheless seeks to sidestep this problem by merely arguing \n(without citation) that President Trump “… [l]ater indicated he was no longer requiring \nimmediate declassification of these documents at this time.” See Def’s Memo at 8 n.5. \nThis appears to be a reference to a pair of tweets (consolidated into one body of text \nbelow) issued by President Trump on September 21, 2018, in which he stated the \nfollowing: \nI met with the DOJ concerning the declassification of various \nUNREDACTED documents. They agreed to release them but stated that \nso doing may have a perceived negative impact on the Russia probe. Also, \nkey Allies’ called to ask not to release. Therefore, the Inspector General [] \nhas been asked to review these documents on an expedited basis. I believe \nhe will move quickly on this (and hopefully other things which he is \nlooking at). In the end, I can always declassify if it proves necessary. \nSpeed is very important to me – and everyone! \n \n  4 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41   Filed 11/09/18   Page 10 of 22\nhttps://www.vox.com/2018/9/21/17886720/trump-russia-declassification-order-tweets-\nmueller (last accessed October 22, 2018).1 \nThe language of these tweets poses several problems for the Government and its \nattempt to argue to this Court that the Order is no longer in effect.  \nThe reference by President Trump to “various UNREDACTED documents” makes \nlittle logical sense, at least in the context of the Pages, as they all contain some manner of \nredactions (with the exception of page 30 of the June 2017 FISC application, which was \nreleased without redactions). Unredacted documents would not, by their very nature, \nrequire declassification as there would be nothing to declassify nor redactions to remove.  \nThe president’s lack of clarity aside, the very next sentence in his two-part tweet \nstates that DOJ conveyed to President Trump it would release the documents that are the \nsubject of the Order. This statement unequivocally demonstrates that DOJ has informed \nPresident Trump that any redactions will be removed. This was not merely President \nTrump engaging in the type of political commentary as to what he “hopes” will happen or \nwhat he “believes” should happen that this Court has previously found insufficiently \nexacting, for example, for the purpose of an official disclosure. See James Madison \nProject, et al., v. Dep’t of Justice, et al., 302 F. Supp. 3d 12, 35 (D.D.C. 2018)(finding \nPresident Trump’s descriptions of “Steele Dossier” as “phony” or “fake” as insufficient \nto even create genuine issue of material fact in dispute). Nor does the statement leave it \nopen to interpretation whether President Trump is actually relying upon government \ninformation in making his assertion. See id. at 35 (“But it does not follow that just \nbecause a tweet is an ‘official’ statement of the President that its substance is necessarily \n                                                 \n1 The grammar and syntax errors made in these tweets issued by the Commander-in-Chief \nhave been left “as is” for the sake of factual and historical accuracy. \n  5 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41   Filed 11/09/18   Page 11 of 22\ngrounded in information contained in government records.”); see also James Madison \nProject, et al., v. Dep’t of Justice, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152807, *23 (D.D.C. Sept. 7, \n2018)(“…[I]t is imperative that both the context and substance of the official disclosures \n‘leave no doubt’ as to [whether responsive records exist.]”).2  \nTo the contrary, President Trump makes it explicitly clear that in his discussions with \nDOJ he was informed that the documents subject to the Order will in fact be declassified \nand released. This reflects official confirmation that President Trump and DOJ officials \ndiscussed the declassification and agreed on a course of action that would lead to the \nrelease of, among other things, the Pages.  \nNothing in the remainder of the two-part tweet or in the entirety of the written record \nfor that matter constitutes a rescission of the Order or, alternatively, even a postponement \nof the impact of the Order. The Government certainly has not produced any written \norders or directives from President Trump or DOJ stating that the Order has been \nrescinded or its impact postponed. The two sworn affidavits submitted by the \nGovernment in support of its Motion, see Third Declaration of David M. Hardy  \n(Dkt. #40-1)(filed October 19, 2018)(“Hardy Decl.”); Declaration of Patrick M. Findlay \n(Dkt. #40-3)(filed October 19, 2018)(“Findlay Decl.”), both of whom are government \nofficials far below the level of the President and therefore cannot overrule his position, \ncontain no reference to any documentation indicating any change to the impact of the \nOrder either. \n                                                 \n2 Respectfully, the Plaintiffs are not conceding the legal validity of the analysis in the \ncited rulings by this Court or its brethren, U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman \nJackson. However, as neither of those rulings have yet to be reviewed on the merits by \nthe appellate courts and therefore remain valid and current case law, the Plaintiffs are \nrelying upon those analyses for purposes of the present case.  \n  6 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41   Filed 11/09/18   Page 12 of 22\nThe entirety of the Government’s claim that the Order is effectively “on hold” \nappears to be factually premised on nothing more than President Trump’s two-part tweet. \nThe tweets certainly do not specifically say that the Order has been rescinded or put on \nhold. The only thing they say is that President Trump has asked the Office of the \nInspector General to review an unspecified set of documents “on an expedited basis.”  \nThat assertion is too thin a reed upon which to hang the Government’s defense. Even \nif the OIG had the authority to conduct a review of the appropriateness of the various \nredactions (and there is no indication that the OIG is the proper office to conduct such a \nreview),3 this vague assertion by President Trump (without any particular timeframe) \nsimply cannot alone satisfy the Government’s evidentiary burden here to demonstrate \nthat the Order is no longer in effect (or at least in effect with respect to the Pages in \nparticular). President Trump’s tweets do not specify whether the “expedited review” \nbeing conducted by the OIG relates to the Pages specifically or rather to the other \ncategories of information and records that were also subject to the Order (such as reports \nof interviews with DOJ official Bruce G. Ohr or reports of interviews prepared in \nconnection with FISC applications targeting Mr. Page). What is good for the goose is \ngood for the gander, see James Madison Project, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152807 at *23 \n(referencing need to meet matching and specificity requirements for official disclosures), \nand DOJ cannot point to any specific or exacting official statements in the record that \ndemonstrates OIG is reviewing the Pages in particular.  \n                                                 \n3 The OIG’s mandate is typically limited to matters involving misconduct in DOJ \nprograms and personnel, as well as audits of DOJ programs. https://oig.justice.gov/about/  \n(last accessed October 23, 2018). Unless the review is to reassure President Trump that \nredactions and withholdings made were not the result of improper political bias, the OIG \ndoes not appear to be the proper forum for conducting this review. Nor is there any \nevidence the OIG is actually conducting a review. \n  7 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41   Filed 11/09/18   Page 13 of 22\n Indeed, it would defy logic to believe that OIG is currently conducting an \noverlapping review of the Pages (and, hypothetically, could conclude some redactions \nwere inappropriate) while at the same time the Government is expending time and \nresources to argue before this Court that all of the redactions in the Pages are justified. If \nthe OIG’s “expedited review” did relate to the Pages, it is more than plausible to imagine \nthat the review would be finished before the current briefing even concluded, let alone \nbefore this Court has a chance to issue a ruling. The undersigned find it unlikely that the \nGovernment has chosen to risk disrupting the briefing process in this case for a second \ntime due to external events and can only reasonably surmise (as the written record would \nseem to confirm) that the OIG’s review is not of the Pages.  \nIf the Government wishes to produce actual evidence demonstrating that the Order \nhas been rescinded or otherwise postponed with respect to the Pages, it is certainly within \nits discretion and authority to do so. Until such time as that evidence is provided, \nhowever, this Court should conclude that the President’s Order remains in effect (at least \nwith respect to the Pages) and that partial summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs is \nwarranted with respect to the Pages. \nB.  Alternatively, If Partial Summary Judgment Is Not Currently Warranted \nFor The Plaintiffs, Limited Discovery Is Justified To Determine The Current \nStatus Of The Order \n \nEven if this Court were to conclude that partial summary judgment is not warranted at \nthis time in favor of the Plaintiffs with respect to the Pages, it borders on axiomatic that \nthe Government has failed to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact \nin dispute justifying summary judgment in its favor on the same matter. As previously \nexplained, supra at 6-7, the Government has provided no evidence beyond  \n  8 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41   Filed 11/09/18   Page 14 of 22\nPresident Trump’s two-part tweet to suggest that the Order has been stayed, particularly \nwith respect to the Pages. \nThese circumstances more than reasonably justify authorizing supplemental \ndeclarations or limited discovery to resolve the material fact in dispute. Although FOIA \nactions are typically resolved without the need for discovery, see Wheeler v. CIA, 271 F. \nSupp. 2d 132, 139 (D.D.C. 2003), it has been permitted when there is evidence of bad \nfaith or other tangible evidence that an exemption claimed by the agency is inappropriate.  \nSee Voinche v. FBI, 412 F. Supp. 2d 60, 72 (D.D.C. 2006).  \nIn the present case, limited discovery is justified given the existence of the Order \nrequiring the declassification and release of the Pages and the Government’s argument \n(without sufficient evidence) that the Order does not currently remain in effect as a matter \nof law. Discovery would be confined to answering the following questions: (1) has \nPresident Trump (or his appropriate designee) specifically informed the appropriate DOJ \nofficials – whether in writing or verbally – that the Order can be considered as rescinded \nor otherwise postponed with respect to the Pages; (2) does the OIG’s review encompass \nthe appropriateness of the redactions made in the Pages and, if so, what is the timeframe \nfor a completion of that review; and (3) if President Trump (or his appropriate designee) \nhas not specifically given instructions that the Order can considered as rescinded or \notherwise postponed, and the OIG’s review does not encompass the Pages, upon what \nbasis is DOJ concluding that the Order remains in effect with respect to the Pages? \nDeclaration of Bradley P. Moss at ¶7 (dated November 9, 2018)(“Moss Decl.”), attached \nas Exhibit “1”. \n  9 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41   Filed 11/09/18   Page 15 of 22\nAbsent this clarification, whether through supplemental agency declarations or \nlimited discovery, a genuine issue of material fact remains in dispute regarding the status \nof the Order and its impact upon the redactions found in the Pages.  \nIII. AT A MINIMUM, SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF THE \nGOVERNMENT IS NOT WARRANTED AT THIS TIME WITH RESPECT \nTO THE REDACTIONS AND WITHHOLDINGS MADE TO THE \nRELEASED RECORDS \n \nIn the event this Court concludes that the Order is not in effect or otherwise has no \nlegal relevance to the current pleadings, the Plaintiffs nonetheless respectfully submit that \nsummary judgment still is not warranted at this time with respect to the various \nredactions and withholdings made to the responsive records processed and released by \nthe Government.  \nA.  THERE IS A GENUINE ISSUE OF MATERIAL FACT IN DISPUTE \nREGARDING THE GOOD FAITH BASIS OF THE GOVERNMENT’S \nREDACTIONS AND WITHHOLDINGS \n \n“The significance of agency affidavits in a FOIA case cannot be underestimated.” \nKing v. Dep’t of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 218 (D.C. Cir. 1987). The rationale behind this \nwell-established axiom is clear and apparent given that in FOIA cases “the agency alone \npossesses knowledge of the precise content of documents withheld,” thereby forcing both \nthe FOIA requester and the court to “rely upon the agency’s representations for an \nunderstanding of the material sought to be protected.” Id. In order to withhold \ninformation an agency must provide “a relatively detailed justification, specifically \nidentifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those \nclaims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.” Id. at 219.  \nVague or conclusory explanations by the agency will not suffice. See also Church of \nScientology, Inc. v. Turner, 662 F.2d 784, 787 (D.C. Cir. 1980)(“We have consistently \n  10 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41   Filed 11/09/18   Page 16 of 22\nmaintained that vague, conclusory affidavits, or those that merely paraphrase the words \nof a statute, do not allow a reviewing judge to safeguard the public’s right of access to \ngovernment records.”). Rather, specificity is paramount. See Gardels v. CIA, 689 F.2d \n1100, 1105 (D.C. Cir. 1982). \n  The burden of demonstrating that the material in question was properly withheld \ncommonly requires the preparation of a detailed Vaughn Index, which must “show \nspecifically and clearly that the requested materials fall into the category of documents” \nthat Congress has exempted. Hayden v. NSA, 608 F.2d 1381, 1390 (D.C. Cir. 1979); see \nalso PHE, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 983 F.2d 248, 250 (D.C. Cir. 1993)(“[A]n affidavit \nthat contains merely a ‘categorical description of redacted material coupled with a \ncategorical indication of anticipated consequences of disclosure is clearly inadequate.’”), \nquoting King, 830 F.2d at 224; King, 830 F.2d at 225 (“The measure of a Vaughn Index \nis its descriptive accuracy, and we are willing to accept innovations in its form so long, \nbut only so long, as they contribute to that end.”). \n  In its pleadings, the Government laid out its arguments and justifications for why \nredactions and withholdings relying upon Exemptions 1, 3, 6 and 7 should be upheld by \nthis Court. See Def’s Memo at 15-32. However, despite having been put on notice by the \nPlaintiffs, see Dkt. #36 (joint status report)(filed July 24, 2018), the Government made no \neffort to proactively address the “bad faith” suggestions made by President Trump in the \nwake of the release of responsive records in this FOIA action.  \n  Summary judgment may not be warranted when an agency’s declaration is \ncontradicted by evidence of possible agency bad faith. See DiBacco v. Army, 795 F.3d \n178, 196 (D.C. Cir. 2015); see also Davidson v. Dep’t of State, 206 F. Supp. 3d 178, 202 \n  11 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41   Filed 11/09/18   Page 17 of 22\n(D.D.C. 2016)(allegations of bad faith can place the credibility of an agency declaration \nin doubt and warrant further evidentiary inquiry). To be sure, an earnestly held but \nmistaken view of the law typically (but not exclusively) will not ultimately suffice to \ndemonstrate agency bad faith on the merits. See Hall & Assocs. LLC v. EPA, 315 F. \nSupp. 3d 519, 545 (D.D.C. 2018). However, for the purpose of resolving the initial \nindication of a material fact in dispute, evidence of wrongdoing or bad faith can suffice to \njustify limited discovery. See Landmark Legal Found. v. EPA, 959 F. Supp. 2d 175, 184 \n(D.D.C. 2013)(authorizing limited discovery to resolve possible factual questions of \npossible bad faith by agency in how it conducted searches for records).  \nIn the present case, the Plaintiffs can more than sufficiently demonstrate the existence \nof evidence coming from the highest government authority – namely, President Trump – \ncasting doubt on the good faith bases for the redactions and withholdings made by the \nGovernment.  \nWithin 48 hours of the public disclosure of the responsive records in this action, \nPresident Trump described the specific redactions in the records as “ridiculous” and \nrepeated remarks claiming that the classified redactions in particular were done to \n“…[c]over up misconduct by the FBI and the Justice Department in misleading the Court \n…”. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1020978929 736265729 (last accessed \nOctober 23, 2018); https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/ status/10213472300 22807552 \n(last accessed October 23, 2018). President Trump subsequently issued the Order that \nstated he was directly overriding the specific redaction determinations in the Pages, \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-34/  \n  12 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41   Filed 11/09/18   Page 18 of 22\n(last accessed October 22, 2018), and has since stated that the OIG is conducting a review \nof an unspecified set of the records. https://www.vox.com/2018/9/21/17886720/trump-\nrussia-declassification-order-tweets-mueller (last accessed October 22, 2018). \n  To the best of the undersigned’s knowledge, there is no precedent for a sitting \nPresident of the United States to so publicly question the good faith bases for redactions \nand withholdings put in place by his own Executive Branch agencies in a FOIA action. \nThis reality requires this Court to look for guidance from a similar legal dilemma faced \nby the judiciary in the era of President Trump with respect to how much value to apply to \nthe president’s public commentary. \n  The U.S. Supreme Court recently expressed a willingness to consider the relevance \nand materiality of official presidential statements that conflict with the legal justifications \nseparately made by the Executive Branch to support policy determinations. See Trump v. \nHawaii, 2018 U.S. LEXIS 4026, *55 (U.S. June 26, 2018). Although the Supreme Court \nultimately upheld the policy at issue in that litigation – President Trump’s travel ban, \ncommonly referred to as the “Muslim ban” – it did so only after determining that the \nGovernment had sufficiently demonstrated through the written record that the policy’s \nformulation and implementation was facially legitimate irrespective of President Trump’s \nseparate inflammatory rhetoric and commentary. See id., 2018 U.S. LEXIS 4026 at *53, \n*57 (referencing multi-agency review process that developed “Muslim ban”). \n  The Trump ruling could serve as a roadmap for this Court in the present case. The \nsufficiency of factual evidence that existed in Trump does not currently exist in an \nanalogous fashion to the present FOIA action. The Government has provided no evidence \nto rebut or otherwise address the official statements by President Trump decrying the \n  13 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41   Filed 11/09/18   Page 19 of 22\nredactions as “ridiculous”. Nor has the Government provided evidence to rebut President \nTrump’s suggestion that political bias (not facially legitimate national security and policy \nconsiderations) served as the justification for the redaction and withholding \ndeterminations. The Government has similarly provided no evidence to address the \nrelevance of the OIG’s apparent ongoing review of the appropriateness of the redactions \nand withholdings. All three of these factors are relevant evidentiary considerations that \nconflict with and contradict the good faith bases for the Government’s redaction and \nwithholdings. Moss Decl. at ¶10.  \n  It may come to pass that the Government can ultimately demonstrate that the \nredactions and withholding determinations were done properly and independent of any \nperceived political bias that would undermine the presumptive good faith bases for the \nGovernment’s actions. Until the factual dispute underlying that issue has been resolved, \nhowever, summary judgment is not yet warranted for the Government.  \nB.  THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE PROVIDED A PRIVACY WAIVER FROM \nCARTER PAGE THAT WARRANTS RECONSIDERATION OF \nAPPLICABLE PRIVACY REDACTIONS \n \nIn its Motion, the Government notes that it redacted “certain personal information” \nabout Page that was contained in the responsive records. See Def’s Memo at 29-30. The \nGovernment relied upon FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) as the legal bases for these \nredactions. Id. \nPrivacy redactions can be overcome if a FOIA requester can do one of the following: \n(1) provide proof of death; (2) demonstrate an overriding public interest in disclosure of \nthe responsive records; or (3) provide a privacy waiver from the third party. See Graff v. \n  14 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41   Filed 11/09/18   Page 20 of 22\nFBI, 822 F. Supp. 2d 23, 36-37 (D.D.C. 2011). Upon review of the Motion, the Plaintiffs \nsecured a signed privacy waiver from Mr. Page and provided it to Government counsel.  \nMoss Decl. at ¶13. \nAccordingly, summary judgment is not currently warranted for the Government with \nrespect to these particular privacy redactions and should be denied without prejudice.  \nC.  THERE IS A GENUINE ISSUE OF MATERIAL FACT IN DISPUTE \nREGARDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS \nMET ITS SEGREGABILITY OBLIGATIONS \n \nThe Plaintiffs further submit that the Government has not sufficiently demonstrated it \ncomplied with FOIA’s segregability requirements. At a minimum, the Plaintiffs \nrespectfully requests that this Court conduct an in camera review of at least a random \nsampling (if not the entirety) of the 598 pages at issue to satisfy for itself that the \nsegregability requirements have been met as a matter of law. \nThe requirement regarding segregability obligates agencies to divulge all portions of \ndocuments that are not specifically exempted by statute from disclosure. See Kimberlin v. \nDep’t of Justice, 139 F.3d 944, 950 (D.C.

MOSS, ESQ. \n \nThe undersigned hereby declares as follows: \n  1.  I am a person over eighteen (18) years of age and competent to testify. I am \nmaking this Declaration on personal knowledge. This Declaration is submitted in support \nof the Plaintiffs’ Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, as well as in support of \nthe Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Opposition to the Defendant’s Motion for \nSummary Judgment.  \n  2.  I am one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs The James Madison Project and Brad \nHeath (hereinafter referred to collectively as the “Plaintiffs”) in this matter, along with \nmy firm’s Managing Partner, Mark S. Zaid (“Mr. Zaid”). I am admitted to practice law in \nthe State of Illinois and the District of Columbia, as well as the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe D.C. Circuit and the United States District Courts for the District of Columbia, \nDistrict of Maryland and the Northern District of Illinois. I have been litigating cases \ninvolving the federal government, including with respect to the Freedom of Information \nAct (“FOIA”), since 2007. I also actively represent individuals associated with or within \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41-1   Filed 11/09/18   Page 3 of 7\n \nthe intelligence, law enforcement or military communities in administrative proceedings. \nBoth Mr. Zaid and I hold U.S. Government security clearances, granted by the \nDepartment of Justice, for the purpose of representing specific clients, some of whose \naffiliation to the U.S. Government is a classified fact. \n  The Declassification Order \n  3.  On September 17, 2018, President Donald J. Trump (“President Trump”) \nexercised his constitutional authority to order the immediate declassification of twenty-\none specific pages (“the Pages”) from the 412-page production of FISA records released \nin this litigation and that relate to Carter W. Page (“Mr. Page)”. https://www.white \nhouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-34/ (last accessed October 22, \n2018). The Pages are derived from the June 2017 FISC application regarding Mr. Page. \n  4.  Since the issuance of the declassification order (the “Order”), neither President \nTrump nor any authorized U.S. Government official have made public, official statements \nindicating that the Order no longer remains in effect.  \n  5.  President Trump did issue a two-part tweet on September 21, 2018, in which he \nstated that the Department of Justice had agreed to release an unspecified number of \ndocuments subject to the Order. President Trump further noted, however, that due to \nconcerns raised about the “Russia probe” and by unidentified “Allies”, he was asking the \nInspector General (“OIG”) to review an unspecified set of documents on an expedited \nbasis. https://www.vox.com/2018/9/21/17886720/trump-russia-declassification-order-\ntweets-mueller (last accessed October 22, 2018).  \n \n \n2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41-1   Filed 11/09/18   Page 4 of 7\n \n  6.  There is no evidence in the written record demonstrating that the documents at \nissue in the two-part tweet on September 21, 2018, overlap with the Pages subject to the \nOrder. Nowhere within the four corners of the two supporting declarations submitted by \nDOJ in support of its Motion for Summary Judgment, see Dkt. #40-1; Dkt. #40-3, is there \nany reference to any documentation or authoritative sources of information indicating that \nthe Order no longer remains in effect. The entirety of the evidence supporting DOJ’s \ncontention that the Order is not currently in effect consists merely of President Trump’s \ntwo-part tweet on September 21, 2018. \n  7.  At a minimum, the Plaintiffs have provided more than sufficient evidence of a \ngenuine issue of material fact in dispute regarding whether the Order remains in effect, \nparticularly with respect to the Pages. Supplemental information – whether through \nadditional agency declarations or limited discovery – is necessary to address the following \nquestions: (a) has President Trump (or his appropriate designee) specifically informed the \nappropriate DOJ officials – whether in writing or verbally – that the Order can be \nconsidered as rescinded or otherwise postponed with respect to the Pages; (b) does the \nOIG’s review encompass the appropriateness of the redactions made in the Pages and, if \nso, what is the timeframe for a completion of that review; and (c) if President Trump  \n(or his appropriate designee) has not specifically given instructions that the Order can \nconsidered as rescinded or otherwise postponed, and the OIG’s review does not \nencompass the Pages, upon what basis is DOJ concluding that the Order remains in effect \nwith respect to the Pages? \n \n \n3 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41-1   Filed 11/09/18   Page 5 of 7\n \n  Good Faith Basis for Redactions and Withholdings \n  8.  DOJ provided two sworn declarations in support of their Motion for Summary \nJudgment. See Dkt. #40-1; Dkt. #40-3. The Third Declaration of David M. Hardy \n(“Hardy Declaration”) specifically addressed the justifications for the redactions and \nwithholdings made to the 598 pages of responsive records. Dkt. #40-1. \n  9.  In a status report filed with this Court four months ago, see Dkt. #36 (filed  \nJuly 24, 2018), the Plaintiffs notified DOJ that the Plaintiffs intended to challenge the \ngood faith basis of the redactions and withholdings. Specifically, the Plaintiffs indicated \nthey would raise before this Court the question of whether the President’s public \ndisparagement of the legitimacy of the redactions and withholdings sufficiently \nundermined the good faith justifications otherwise put forth by the Government. Despite \nthat advance warning, the Hardy Declaration makes no reference to this issue at all. The \nHardy Declaration similarly makes no reference to the relevance of President Trump’s \nsubsequent further actions questioning the legitimacy of the redactions and withholdings, \nnamely the issuance of the Order and the subsequent initiation of an “expedited review” \nby the OIG.  \n  10. By themselves, the President’s official statements and official actions raise a \ngenuine issue of material fact in dispute regarding the good faith basis for DOJ’s \nredactions and withholdings. What evidence can DOJ provide to specifically rebut \nPresident Trump’s description of the redactions as “ridiculous”? What evidence can DOJ \nprovide to specifically counter President Trump’s promotion of commentary stating that \nthe redactions and withholdings are due to political bias, particularly in light of the \n“expedited review” that President Trump has since ordered to be conducted by the OIG?  \n4 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41-1   Filed 11/09/18   Page 6 of 7\n \n  11. At a minimum, additional clarification is needed from DOJ addressing these \nquestions before this Court can conclude that summary judgment is warranted in favor of \nDOJ. \n  The Carter Page Privacy Redactions \n  12. At various points in the responsive records released as part of this litigation, the \nGovernment redacted what it has identified as “certain personal information” regarding \nPage in reliance upon privacy FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C).  \n  13. The undersigned coordinated with Page’s private counsel and secured an executed \nprivacy waiver from Page waiving his rights with respect to the redaction of that “certain \npersonal information”. The undersigned has provided Government counsel with that \nprivacy waiver. \n  Segregability \n  14. The Plaintiffs respectfully submit that the Hardy Declaration’s language regarding \nsegregability is too conclusory and lacking in detail. The Hardy Declaration provides this \nCourt with nothing more than boilerplate language stating that no reasonably segregable \nnon-exempt information could be released. These types of boilerplate descriptions have \nbeen viewed skeptically by courts in the past and should be done so here as well.  \n  15. Of particular significance is the complete withholding of 186 pages of responsive \nrecords, including the minimization orders that would have accompanied each of the four \nFISC applications produced in part by DOJ as part of this litigation. Is DOJ truly arguing \nthat no part of those minimization orders can be released in part? It may be the case that \nthe DOJ’s argument can eventually meet the legal threshold to answer that question in the \naffirmative but, in its current form, the Hardy Declaration simply fails to meet the \n5 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41-1   Filed 11/09/18   Page 7 of 7\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41-2   Filed 11/09/18   Page 1 of 4\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n   \n              * \nTHE JAMES MADISON PROJECT,  * \net al.,             * \n              * \n  Plaintiffs,          * \n              *     \n    v.          *    Civil Action No. 17-597 (APM) \n              * \nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,    *   \n              * \n  Defendant.         * \n              * \n*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * \nPLAINTIFFS’ STATEMENT OF  \nMATERIAL FACTS AS TO WHICH THERE IS NO GENUINE DISPUTE \n \n  Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1 (h), the plaintiffs The James Madison Project and  \nBrad Heath (referred to jointly as “Plaintiffs”) respectfully submit the following \nStatement of Material Facts as to Which There is No Genuine Dispute.  \n  1.  By letters dated March 6, 2017, the Plaintiffs submitted FOIA requests to the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and the Department of Justice’s National \nSecurity Division, respectively. In each of the FOIA requests, the Plaintiffs sought three \ncategories of records: (a) a copy of any order(s) by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt (“FISC”) authorizing surveillance of and/or collection of information concerning \nthe Trump Organization, President Trump, President Trump’s campaign for the \npresidency, or people associated with President Trump; (b) a complete copy of any \napplication(s) to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court seeking authorization of \nand/or collection of information concerning the Trump Organization, President Trump, \nPresident Trump’s campaign for the presidency, or people associated with President \nTrump; and (c) a copy of any minimization procedures issued by the Foreign Intelligence \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41-2   Filed 11/09/18   Page 2 of 4\nSurveillance Court and that applied to any order(s) issued that fell within the scope of \ncategories (a) or (b). First Amended Complaint at ¶¶13-14, 22-23 (Dkt. #5). \n  2.  In February 2018, President Donald J. Trump (“President Trump”) authorized the \ndeclassification and release of two competing memoranda authored by the Majority and \nthe Minority members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Those \ntwo memoranda are commonly referred to as the “Nunes Memo” and the “Schiff Memo”, \nrespectively. Both memoranda revealed the existence of multiple FISA warrant \napplications targeting Carter W. Page (“Mr. Page”). See Dkt. #40-1 at ¶¶17, 19, 20-22. \n  3.  On July 20, 2018, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the FBI released 412 \npages of responsive materials derived from four separate FISA warrant applications \ntargeting Mr. Page. See id. at ¶4. \n  4.  On September 17, 2018, President Trump exercised his constitutional authority to \norder the immediate declassification of 21 specific pages (“the Pages”) from the 412-page \nproduction. The Pages are derived from the June 2017 FISC application regarding  \nMr. Page. https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-\n34/ (last accessed October 22, 2018).  \n  5.  To date, that official declassification order (“the Order”) by President Trump has \nnot been rescinded in any clear or explicit manner. \n  6.  President Trump did issue a two-part tweet on September 21, 2018, in which he \nstated the following: \nI met with the DOJ concerning the declassification of various \nUNREDACTED documents. They agreed to release them but stated that \nso doing may have a perceived negative impact on the Russia probe. Also, \nkey Allies’ called to ask not to release. Therefore, the Inspector General [] \nhas been asked to review these documents on an expedited basis. I believe \nhe will move quickly on this (and hopefully other things which he is \n  2 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41-2   Filed 11/09/18   Page 3 of 4\nlooking at). In the end, I can always declassify if it proves necessary. \nSpeed is very important to me – and everyone! \n \nhttps://www.vox.com/2018/9/21/17886720/trump-russia-declassification-order-tweets-\nmueller (last accessed October 22, 2018). \n  7.  Nowhere within the four corners of President Trump’s September 21, 2018, two-\npart tweet does he clearly or explicitly state that the Order has been rescinded or its \nimplementation otherwise placed on hold. President Trump’s two-part tweet states that \nunidentified documents will be released but that similarly-unspecified documents are first \nbeing subject to expedited review by the “Inspector General”.  \n  8.  Nowhere within the two-part tweet does President Trump identify which set of \ndocuments (if not all of them) that were subject to the Order are being reviewed by the \nInspector General. Nowhere within the two-part tweet does President Trump identify \nwhich set of documents (if not all of them) that were subject to the Order the DOJ has \nalready agreed to release. \n  9.  The Government has not produced any evidence beyond President Trump’s two-\npart tweet to demonstrate that the Order has been rescinded or otherwise placed on hold, \nwhether in general or specifically with respect to the Pages.  \n  10. The Order remains in effect as a matter of law and requires compliance with its \ninstruction to immediately declassify and release the Pages. \n \n \n \n \n \n  3 \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 41-2   Filed 11/09/18   Page 4 of 4\nDate:  November 9, 2018 \n              Respectfully submitted, \n             \n              /s/ \n            ___________________ \nBradley P.

On May 23, 2019, the President delegated to the Attorney General the authority to \ndeclassify documents as part of his ongoing review of intelligence activities relating to the \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 52   Filed 08/30/19   Page 4 of 12\ncampaigns in the 2016 Presidential election and certain related matters.  To this point, the \nAttorney General has not exercised that declassification authority over the materials at issue in \nthis case.  Weinsheimer Decl. ¶ 5. \n43.  There is no order, guidance, policy, or other facts that currently prevent the \nDepartment from asserting other FOIA Exemptions over the redacted portions of the documents \nat issue now.

The Court raised \nquestions about whether, as a factual matter, the President had declassified or ordered disclosure \nof 21 pages of the acknowledged Carter Page FISA materials, and directed DOJ to submit a \ndeclaration regarding whether those pages were declassified and whether the agency is \nauthorized to continue to assert other exemptions with respect to these pages.  The Supplemental \nDeclaration of G. Bradley Weinsheimer, dated August 30, 2019, establishes that the President \nhas not ordered the declassification or disclosure of these pages.  Defendant is therefore entitled \nto summary judgment.  \nBACKGROUND \nThe procedural background of this matter is set forth fully in previous filings, which are \nfully incorporated here, see ECF Nos. 40, 43, 46, 48, 49, and summarized in the Opinion, see \nECF No. 51.   Defendant will not repeat all of this background here, but in general, this matter \narises from FOIA requests submitted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and DOJ’s \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 52   Filed 08/30/19   Page 6 of 12\nNational Security Division (“NSD”) on March 6, 2017, in which Plaintiffs sought records related \nto specific individuals and organizations allegedly subject to surveillance under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”).  See Third Declaration of David Hardy, dated October \n19, 2018, ECF No. 40-1, ¶ 6 (citing 1st Hardy Decl., ECF No. 13-3, ¶ 5 & Exhibit A (FOIA \nRequest)); Declaration of Patrick N. Findlay, dated October 19, 2018, ECF No. 40-3, ¶ 4 & \nExhibit A (FOIA Request).  DOJ maintained a Glomar response in part, but NSD and the FBI \nsearched for the acknowledged FISA applications and orders related to Carter Page.  On July 20, \n2018, DOJ and the FBI released all responsive, non-exempt and reasonably segregable \ninformation subject to FOIA – releasing 412 pages with redactions and withholding 186 pages in \nfull.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 4, 134-35; Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 9-12; see also https://vault.fbi.gov/d1-\nrelease/d1-release.   As set forth in previous filings, the 412 released pages reflect information \nproperly redacted under Exemptions 1, 3, 6, 7(A), 7(C), 7(D), 7(E).  The withheld in full pages \nfrom the FISA applications and orders were properly withheld pursuant to Exemptions 1, 3, 7(A) \nand 7(E). \nAs set forth in the Opinion, “Defendant’s continued redaction of 21 of the 412 pages is \nthe sole contested issue in the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment.”  Opinion, at 2.  \nThis issue arises because of a White House press secretary statement that the President had \n“directed” ODNI and DOJ “to provide for the immediate declassification of . . . pages 10-12 and \n17-34 of the June 2017 application to the FISA court in the matter of Carter W. Page.”  Id.; see \nalso Press Release, White House Press Secretary (Sept. 17, 2018), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-34/.  The press \nrelease was followed by two tweets from the President’s twitter account: \nI met with the DOJ concerning the declassification of various UNREDACTED \ndocuments. They agreed to release them but stated that so doing may have a \nperceived negative impact on the Russia probe. Also, key Allies’ called to ask \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 52   Filed 08/30/19   Page 7 of 12\nnot to release. Therefore, the Inspector General . . . has been asked to review \nthese documents on an expedited basis. I believe he will move quickly on this \n(and hopefully other things which he is looking at). In the end I can always \ndeclassify if it proves necessary. Speed is very important to me - and everyone! \n \nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1043146627576258561; \nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1043148165883416576. \nDOJ explained that the press secretary statement was not a declassification order, that it \nwas superseded by the subsequent tweets, that DOJ was not aware of any other presidential \ndeclassification order, and that in any event, DOJ could redact the same information on the basis \nof other exemptions, regardless of whether or not they were classified.  Def.’s Combined Mem. \nin Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Summ. J. & Reply in Supp. of Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 44 \nat 3.  The Court found that it could not grant summary judgment because of two ambiguities in \nthe record.  First, the Court explained that because of the press secretary statement, the burden \nwas on DOJ to establish that the President did not declassify these pages.  Opinion at 3 & n.4.  \nThe Court found that DOJ did not meet this burden because it did not provide in its declarations \n(as opposed to its legal argument) “clarification about what instructions the Department of \nJustice received concerning the ‘declassification’ of the Pages’ contents.”  Id. at 5.  Thus, the \nCourt could not “find that Defendant’s withholding of information from the Pages was proper \nunder FOIA Exemption 1.”  Id. \nSecond, the Court found that, in light of the press release, there was also a “genuine \ndispute of material fact about the agency’s authority” to invoke other Exemptions because even \nthough the press release only speaks about “declassification,” the Court questioned why the \nPresident would have ordered declassification only to have the same material withheld under \nanother FOIA exemption.  Id. at 6.     \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 52   Filed 08/30/19   Page 8 of 12\nIn light of these ambiguities, the Court denied the parties’ cross-motions for summary \njudgment and invited Defendant to renew its motion and file a supplemental declaration \nexplaining: “(1) the effect, if any, the Press Release and the President’s subsequent tweets \n(including the meeting referenced in the tweets) had on the classification status of the Pages, and \n(2) whether the agency is authorized to assert Exemptions 7(D) and 7(E) to shield portions of the \nPages from disclosure.”  Opinion, at 6. \nARGUMENT \nI.  The President Did Not Order Declassification or Disclosure of the \nInformation at Issue. \n \nWith this memorandum, DOJ submits a declaration from G. Bradley Weinsheimer, an \nAssociate Deputy Attorney General in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General (“ODAG”).  \nThe Weinsheimer Declaration addresses the issues raised in the Opinion, and confirms in a \nsworn declaration DOJ’s previous explanations.   As explained there, “DOJ did not receive a \ndeclassification order related to the materials at issue in this case.  After the press secretary \nstatement was issued, ODAG personnel, including me [Mr. Weinsheimer], consulted with \npersonnel at the White House about the matters discussed in that statement, including potential \ndeclassification of certain documents related to the Carter Page FISA applications and orders.”  \nWeinsheimer Decl. ¶ 4.  Mr. Weinsheimer explains that “[i]n connection with those \nconsultations, DOJ was informed that there was no order requiring immediate declassification or \ndisclosure of those documents.”  Id. ¶ 5.  “DOJ also did not receive any order to declassify the \nmaterials at issue in this case during the meeting the President referenced in his tweet, or at any \ntime.”  Id.1 \n                                                           \n1  Nor has the Attorney General declassified these materials:  “On May 23, 2019, the President \ndelegated to the Attorney General the authority to declassify documents as part of his ongoing \nreview of intelligence activities relating to the campaigns in the 2016 Presidential election and \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 52   Filed 08/30/19   Page 9 of 12\nDOJ maintains that the press release describing a direction to “provide for immediate \ndeclassification” was ambiguous at best.  See Poulsen v. Dep’t of Def., 373 F. Supp. 3d 1249, \n1279 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (“The President’s September 2018 ‘declassification’ directive was not an \n‘order’ from the President covering this material, just a statement from the White House asking \nthe executive agencies to undertake a review and further justify the redactions.”); ECF 43, at 3-4.  \nThe President has previously clearly declassified and disclosed information when he wished to \ndo so.  See, e.g., 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 19 (describing declassification of the Nunes Memorandum); \nFebruary 2, 2018 Letter from White House Counsel, \nhttps://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/memo_and_white_house_letter.pdf (explaining that \nmemorandum was declassified “in light of the significant public interest in the memorandum,” \nand attaching the memorandum for public release).  DOJ has now clarified, however, that DOJ \ndid not receive a declassification order with respect to the Carter Page FISA pages either before \nor after the press secretary statement.  Although the President did delegate declassification \nauthority to the Attorney General, to date, the Attorney General has not exercised that \ndeclassification authority to declassify the materials remaining at issue in this case.  \nWeinsheimer Decl. ¶ 5.  \nDOJ is therefore entitled to summary judgment on its Exemption 1 withholdings. \nII.  DOJ Has Properly Asserted Other Exemptions as Well. \nThe press secretary statement does not affect the applicability of other exemptions, and \nredactions based on other exemptions continue to be proper as well, including Exemptions 3, 6 \nand 7(C), 7(D), and 7(E).  ECF No. 43, at 5.  The Court acknowledged that the press secretary \nstatement only refers to declassification, not other applicable FOIA exemptions, but questioned \n                                                           \ncertain related matters.  To this point, the Attorney General has not exercised that \ndeclassification authority over the materials at issue in this case.”  Weinsheimer Decl. ¶ 5. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 52   Filed 08/30/19   Page 10 of 12\nwhy the President would order declassification if the agency could just rely on other exemptions \nto withhold the same material.   Opinion at 6.  As an initial matter, declassification without \ndisclosure to the public could be done to facilitate broader information sharing within the \nExecutive Branch, with Congress, and with other governmental entities and partners, or to \nfacilitate future public disclosure when other claimed exemptions expire or fall by the wayside.  \nIn any event, Mr. Weinsheimer answers the Court’s question of whether the agency is authorized \nto assert other exemptions over the pages by attesting that he is “not aware of any order, \nguidance, policy, or other facts that would prevent the Department from asserting other FOIA \nExemptions over the redacted portions of the documents at issue here.”  Weinsheimer Decl. ¶ 5. \nDefendants further note that the Opinion misidentified the exemptions remaining at issue \nin addition to Exemption 1, which are not limited to 7(D) and 7(E).  Although those remain at \nissue in these pages, Exemptions 3, 6 and 7(C) remain at issue as well.  The Court assumed that \nExemption 3 “is predicated entirely on Exemption 1,” but that is not the case.  Opinion at 3 n.3.   \nIn asserting Exemption 3, DOJ relied on Section 102A(i)(1) of the National Security Act of \n1947, as amended (now codified at 50 U.S.C. § 3024(i)(1)), which requires the Director of \nNational Intelligence to “protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized \ndisclosure.”  Invocation of the National Security Act therefore shares one factual predicate with \nExemption 1, which was invoked specifically with respect to intelligence sources and methods.  \nSee 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 69 (“Those same intelligence sources and methods [protected by \nExemption 1] are also exempt here under Exemption (b)(3).  Specifically, their disclosure is \nprohibited pursuant to the National Security Act of 1947, as amended.”).  But sharing a factual \npredicate does not mean that Exemption 3 hinges on whether the information meets the \nExemption 1 requirements and is actually classified.  The declassification of information \nprotected by Exemption 1 would not make that information any less about intelligence sources \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 52   Filed 08/30/19   Page 11 of 12\nand methods, does not automatically authorize disclosure, and would not remove the protections \nof the National Security Act.  Nothing in the press release, tweets, or any other public statement \neven suggests that the redacted information would not disclose intelligence sources and methods.  \nAnd it is well settled that Exemption 3 and the National Security Act provide broader protection \nfor intelligence sources and methods than Exemption 1, which has additional requirements.  See \ngenerally CIA v. Sims, 471 U.S. 159, 167 (1985); Gardels v. CIA, 689 F.2d 1100, 1106-07 (D.C. \nCir. 1982). \nMoreover, DOJ continues to protect the private information of individuals who are not \nCarter Page.  FBI asserted Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect private information of four \ncategories of individuals; this assertion was withdrawn only with respect to information about \nCarter Page.  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 92-111 (invoking 6 and 7(C) with respect to other \nindividuals as well); ECF No. 43 at 12 (explaining that the privacy waiver from Carter Page \nmeans that the FBI cannot claim Exemptions 6 and 7(C) over Carter Page’s private information).  \nA review of the coded redactions on the pages at issue shows that at least one of these categories \nremains at issue in these specific pages – a third-party source coded as (b)(6)-4 on p. 23 of the \nJune 2017 FISA application.  See https://vault.fbi.gov/d1-release/d1-release (p. 314 of the release \npdf); 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 34 (explaining codes), ¶¶ 110-11 (explaining these redactions). \nAccordingly, the Court should grant the Defendant’s renewed motion for summary \njudgment on the grounds of other exemptions as well. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, as well as the reasons set forth in the briefing on Defendants’ \nmost recent motion for summary judgment, the Court should grant the Government’s renewed \nmotion for summary judgment. \nDated:  August 30, 2019        Respectfully Submitted, \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 52   Filed 08/30/19   Page 12 of 12\n \nHASHIM MOOPAN \nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Attorney General \n   \nMARCIA BERMAN \nAssistant Director, Federal Programs Branch \n \n/s/Amy E.

This action arises from FOIA requests submitted by the Plaintiffs to the Federal \nBureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and DOJ’s National Security Division (“NSD”).  By letter dated \nMarch 6, 2017, Plaintiffs sought: \n1)  Any orders by the FISC authorizing surveillance of and/or \ncollection of information concerning the Trump Organization, \nPresident Trump, President Trump’s campaign for presidency, or \npeople associated with President Trump. \n2)  Any applications to the FISC seeking authorization for \nsurveillance of and/or collection of information concerning the \nTrump Organization, President Trump, President Trump’s \ncampaign for presidency, or people associated with President \nTrump. \n3)  Any minimization procedures issued by the FISC and that \napplied to any orders issued that fall within the scope of #1 or #2. \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 3 of 64\nSee Third Declaration of David Hardy, dated October 19, 2018, ¶ 6 (citing 1st Hardy Decl., Dkt. \n13-3, ¶ 5 & Exhibit A (FOIA Request));1 Declaration of Patrick N. Findlay, dated October 19, \n2018, ¶ 4 & Exhibit A (FOIA Request). \n2.  By email dated March 17, 2017, NSD refused to confirm or deny the existence of \nresponsive records pursuant to Exemption 1, explaining that to confirm or deny the existence of \nresponsive records would reveal information that is properly classified under Executive Order \n13526.  See Findlay Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. B (NSD Response). \n3.  On the same day, Plaintiffs appealed the determination to the DOJ Office of \nInformation Policy (“OIP”).  On April 12, 2017, OIP affirmed the determination of NSD – that \nthe existence or non-existence of responsive records is a properly classified fact.  See Findlay \nDecl. ¶ 6 & Ex. C (OIP Determination). \n4.  By letter dated March 16, 2017, the FBI acknowledged receipt of Plaintiffs’ \nrequest, and on April 4, 2017, the FBI also issued a Glomar response.   The FBI’s Glomar \nresponse was based on FOIA Exemptions (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(7)(A), and (b)(7)(E).  See 3rd Hardy \nDecl. ¶ 7 (citing 1st Hardy Decl., Dkt. 13-3, ¶ 11 & Ex. D). \nFactual Background. \n5.  DOJ has acknowledged a national security investigation of “the Russian \ngovernment’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election[, including] the nature of any \nlinks between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and \nwhether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts [and] an \nassessment of whether any crimes were committed.”  See The Washington Post, Full transcript: \n                                                           \n1 A redacted version of the Third Hardy Declaration is filed herewith on the public record.  A \nclassified version of the declaration is being concurrently lodged with the Court ex parte and in \ncamera, in order to more fully explain the basis for the withholding of exempt information. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 4 of 64\nFBI Director James Comey testifies on Russian interference in 2016 election (Mar. 20, 2017), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/03/20/full-transcript-fbi-director-\njames-comey-testifies-on-russian-interference-in-2016-election/?utm_term=.b9f19a0cf9cf; 3rd \nHardy Decl. ¶ 14 & n.3.

On March 4, 2017, President Trump’s Twitter account made a four-part post, \ncomplaining that President Obama had Mr. Trump’s “wires tapped in Trump Tower just before \nthe victory.”  See https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump.  During sworn testimony before the \nHouse Permanent Selection Committee on Intelligence (“HPSCI”) on March 20, 2017, then-FBI \nDirector James B. Comey was asked about this by Congressman Schiff and responded to address \nthis specific statement: \nWith respect to the President’s tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at \nhim by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those \ntweets and we have looked carefully inside the FBI. The Department of \nJustice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the \nDepartment of Justice and all its components. The Department has no \ninformation that supports those tweets. \n \nSee Full transcript: FBI Director James Comey testifies on Russian interference in 2016 election \n(Mar. 20, 2017); 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 26. \n  7.  In March 2017, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence \n(“HPSCI”) announced an investigation into “the Russian active measures campaign targeting the \n2016 U.S. election” and later added additional areas of inquiry, including allegations regarding \nthe purported “FISA abuse.”  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 15.  HPSCI’s review led to competing \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 5 of 64\nmemoranda authored by the Majority and the Minority members – often referred to by the names \nof the Chairman and the Ranking Member, i.e., as the “Nunes Memo” and the “Schiff Memo.”  \nBoth memoranda were initially classified because, at a minimum, they revealed FISA coverage \non an identified target – Carter Page – which was a properly classified fact.  Id. ¶ 17. \n  8.  In February 2018, President Trump authorized the declassification of the Nunes \nMemo, dated January 18, 2018.  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 19; Findlay Decl. ¶ 9; \nhttp://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/memo_and_white_house_letter.pdf.  As set forth in a \nFebruary 2, 2018, letter from the White House Counsel, the Nunes Memo was declassified “in \nlight of the significant public interest in the memorandum,” and “reflects the judgments of its \ncongressional authors.”  Id. \n  9.  Approximately three weeks after the public disclosure of the Nunes Memo, an \nunclassified, redacted version of the Schiff Memo, dated January 29, 2018, addressed to All \nMembers of the House of Representatives, and entitled “Correcting the Record – The Russia \nInvestigations” (“Minority Memo”), was released.  See \nhttps://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/ hpsci_redacted_minority_memo.pdf (last visited \nSept. 13, 2018).  Prior to its release, the FBI reviewed the Schiff Memo and redacted classified \ninformation unaffected by the President’s declassification of the Nunes Memo.  The FBI did not \ndeclassify additional information as part of this review.  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 20-22. \n  10.  Neither the Majority nor the Minority asked the FBI or the Department to opine \non their judgment or conclusions, and neither the FBI nor the Department did so; rather, both \nmemoranda reflect the judgments of their congressional authors.  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 20-22. \nFOIA Determination \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 6 of 64\n11.  Because the declassification of the Majority Memo and the subsequent release of \nthe redacted Minority Memo both revealed the existence of certain FISA applications and orders \nto conduct surveillance of Carter Page, the Department reviewed the FISA applications and \norders for potential release of segregable information in response to Plaintiffs’ FOIA request.  \nSee 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 24, 31-34, 134; Findlay Decl. ¶ 12.  On July 20, 2018, DOJ and the FBI \nreleased all responsive, non-exempt and reasonably segregable information subject to FOIA – \nreleasing 412 pages with redactions and withholding 186 pages in full.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 4, \n134-35; Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 11-12; see also https://vault.fbi.gov/d1-release/d1-release.  DOJ is thus \nno longer asserting a Glomar response with respect to the fact that Page was the subject of these \nFISA applications and orders.  Id. ¶ 4; Findlay Decl. ¶ 13.  This FOIA release was \nunprecedented—prior to the release, there had never been any public disclosure of an application \nto the FISC or an order from the FISC pertaining to a specific individual surveillance target.  3rd \nHardy Decl. ¶ 13. \n   12.  Other than the above-described disclosures, no authorized Government official \nhas confirmed or denied the existence of responsive FISA-related records.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ \n27, 143; Findlay Decl. ¶ 23.  Accordingly, DOJ maintains its Glomar response with respect to \nthe remainder of Plaintiffs’ request and refuses to confirm or deny the existence of other \nresponsive records. \nSearch for Documents Related to Acknowledged Carter Page Surveillance \n  13.  NSD and the FBI conducted a reasonable search for records responsive to \nPlaintiffs’ FOIA request insofar as it relates to the acknowledged Carter Page FISA applications.  \nThe official acknowledgement at issue here was limited to four specific FISA applications, \nsubmitted for surveillance on Carter Page, starting in October 2016 and continuing through three \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 7 of 64\nrenewals, with accompanying FISA orders.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 28.  Given the information \npinpointing the specific responsive records, FBI and NSD FOIA personnel consulted with \nknowledgeable officials in both components familiar with the investigation to locate the four \nresponsive FISA packages, encompassing the acknowledged applications and orders related to \nCarter Page.  Id. ¶¶ 28-30; Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 10-11.   As set forth in the Hardy Declaration, the \nrequest for minimization procedures did not require a separate search because those procedures \nare set forth in the packages.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 30.  The FBI and NSD compared records and \nconfirmed that they had complete copies of each of the four FISA packages whose existence had \nbeen officially acknowledged.  Id. ¶ 28. \n  14.  The FBI coordinated the review of these documents, and NSD participated in the \nprocess.  Accordingly, the FBI is asserting all applicable exemptions over these materials.  \nFindlay Decl. ¶ 12 & n.6; 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 31. \nExemption One and Carter Page Documents \n  15.  David M. Hardy is an original classification authority.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 2. \n  16.  Mr. Hardy determined that information withheld from the Carter Page documents \npursuant to Exemption 1 is under control of the United States Government, and contains \ninformation pertaining to intelligence activities, sources or methods.  See Executive Order 13526 \n§§ 1.4(c).  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 43, 46-63. \n  17.  In particular, Mr. Hardy has determined that the information pertaining to \nintelligence activities, sources and methods includes the FBI’s intelligence interests, priorities, \nactivities and methods; undisclosed intelligence sources or methods upon which the FBI relied in \nsupport of its application for FISA coverage on Carter Page, as well as undisclosed portions of \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 8 of 64\nintelligence information provided by Source #1; and information about the use and \nimplementation of various intelligence methods.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 49. \n  18.  Mr. Hardy has determined that disclosure of this information pertaining to \nintelligence sources and methods in these documents would cause harm to national security, and \nhas articulated the harm that could be expected to occur.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 49-63. \n  19.  Mr. Hardy has further determined that information in the Carter Page documents \npertains to foreign relations, and determined that disclosure of such information would cause \nharm to national security.  Mr. Hardy has articulated the harm that could be expected to occur.  \n3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 49, 64-67. \nExemption Three and Carter Page Documents \n  20.  DOJ also withheld information in the Carter Page documents to protect \nintelligence sources and methods from disclosure under Exemption 3 and the National Security \nAct.  Mr. Hardy articulated the risk of disclosure of intelligence sources and methods.  3rd Hardy \nDecl. ¶¶ 68-72. \n  21.  DOJ also redacted information pursuant to another Exemption 3 statute, which \ncannot be publicly identified without revealing the very information to be protected.  Id. ¶ 73. \nExemption 7 and the Carter Page Documents \n  22.  The FISA applications and orders are compiled in part for law enforcement \npurposes.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 74-79. \n  23.  DOJ withheld information from these documents pursuant to Exemption 7(A).  \nMr. Hardy has determined that disclosure of redacted information in the Carter Page FISA \ndocuments could reasonably be expected to interfere with the pending investigation into Russian \nelection interference if publicly disclosed at this time, and has articulated the harms that would \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 9 of 64\noccur.  The types of information that could reasonably be expected to harm the investigation if \ndisclosed include:  aspects of the investigation not previously made public, what information or \nactivities are or are not of interest to the investigators, areas in which there may be gaps in \ninvestigators’ knowledge that could be exploited, and the identities of potential witnesses and the \ninformation they provided.  3rd  Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 80-91. \n24.  DOJ withheld information under Exemption 7(D) because certain investigatory \ninformation would reveal the identity or information of confidential sources.  This includes \nnonpublic information about and provided by Christopher Steele, as well as information about \nand provided by other confidential sources, all of whom were provided express assurances of \nconfidentiality.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 112-18. \n  25.  DOJ withheld eight categories of information in the Carter Page documents \npursuant to Exemption 7(E):  information about the investigative focus of these applications; \ninformation about collection and analysis of information; information about specific techniques \nused in the national security investigations; information about specific databases used for law \nenforcement purposes; information about payments to confidential sources; detailed information \nabout targets, dates and scope of surveillance; information about dates and types of \ninvestigations; and investigative strategies for particular evidence.  Mr. Hardy determined each \nof the nine categories encompasses nonpublic information about law enforcement techniques and \nhas articulated how its disclosure risks circumvention of the law.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 119-33. \nPrivate Information in the Carter Page Documents \n  26.  DOJ withheld four categories of private information in the Carter Page documents \npursuant to Exemption 6 and Exemption 7(E):  identifying information for FBI agents; personal \ninformation about Carter Page; identifying information about a FISC deputy clerk and an NSD \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 10 of 64\nattorney; and identifying information about a third party source.  For each category, the FBI \narticulated and balanced the person’s substantial privacy interest in nondisclosure and the public \ninterest in the withheld information.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 92-111. \nWithheld in Full Pages from FISA Packages \n  27.  DOJ withheld 186 pages in full from the Carter Page FISA packages pursuant to \nExemptions 1, 3, 7(A), and 7(E).  Mr. Hardy determined that disclosure would reveal classified \nintelligence methods and law enforcement techniques.  There is no additional information that \ncan be provided on the public record but the justification for withholding is similar to the \njustification for other redactions under these exemptions.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 135-41. \nSegregability Analysis \n  28.  DOJ released all reasonably segregable, non-exempt information from the Carter \nPage documents.  DOJ conducted a document- by-document and line-by-line review to ensure \nthat all reasonably segregable, non-exempt information was released, taking into account the \npublic disclosures related to this matter.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 134. \nPartial Glomar \n29.  DOJ has refused to confirm or deny the existence of FISA applications and orders \nbeyond the four previously acknowledged Carter Page packages.  Accordingly, DOJ has refused \nto confirm or deny whether there are responsive record beyond the limited disclosures outlined \nabove, pursuant to Exemptions 1, 3, 7(A) and 7(E).  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 142-46; Findlay Decl. ¶¶ \n14-15 (asserting Exemption 1). \n30.  Patrick Findlay is an original classification authority.  He determined that the \ninformation withheld by NSD – the existence or nonexistence of other responsive records – is \nprotected by Exemption 1.  Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 2, 14-22. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 11 of 64\n31.  David M. Hardy is an original classification authority.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 2.  He \ndetermined that the information withheld by FBI – the existence or nonexistence of other \nresponsive records – is protected by Exemption 1.  Id. ¶¶ 143-44, 152-60. \n32.  Mr. Hardy has determined that the existence or nonexistence of other responsive \nrecords pertains to intelligence activities, sources and methods, and Mr. Hardy has articulated the \nharm to national security that would result from disclosure of the existence or nonexistence of \nother responsive records.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 147-55. \n33.  Mr. Findlay has determined that the existence or nonexistence of other responsive \nrecords is currently and properly classified and is therefore properly withheld pursuant to \nExemption 1.   That information pertains to intelligence activities, sources and methods, and Mr. \nFindlay has articulated the harm to national security that would result from disclosure of the \nexistence or nonexistence of other responsive records.  Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 14-22. \n34.  The information withheld pursuant to Exemption 1 also pertains to foreign \nrelations, and Mr. Hardy has articulated the harm to national security that would result from \ndisclosure of the existence or nonexistence of other responsive records.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶  156-\n60.    \n35.  Mr. Hardy further determined that disclosure of the existence or non-existence of \nresponsive records risks disclosure of intelligence sources and methods and is therefore protected \nby the National Security Act and Exemption 3.   See 3rd Hardy Decl. at ¶¶ 161-64. \n36.  Mr. Hardy further determined that FISA applications and FISC orders – when \nthey exist – are records compiled for law enforcement purposes within the meaning of \nExemption 7.  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 164-65. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 12 of 64\n37.  Mr. Hardy further determined that disclosure of the existence or non-existence of \nother responsive records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings \nthat are pending or reasonably anticipated, and that the information is therefore properly \nwithheld under Exemption 7(A).   The withheld information pertains to the pending Russia \ninvestigation and that its disclosure could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement \nproceedings.  Mr. Hardy has articulated the anticipated harm.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 166-69. \n38.  Mr. Hardy further determined that disclosure of the existence or non-existence of \nother responsive records would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement \ninvestigations and that such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the \nlaw, and that the information is therefore properly withheld under Exemption 7(E).  Disclosure \nwould reveal nonpublic information about whether the FBI is employing specific investigative \ntechniques against specific targets and would reveal nonpublic information when and under what \ncircumstances the FBI relies upon FISA-authorized techniques.  Mr. Hardy has articulated how \nsuch disclosure risks circumvention of the law.   3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 170-72. \nOfficial Acknowledgement \n39.  No authorized government official has disclosed the precise information withheld.  \nSee 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 13, 25, 27, 44, 134, 143; Findlay Decl. ¶ 23. \n \n \nDated:  October 19, 2018        Respectfully Submitted, \n \nCHAD READLER \nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Attorney General \n   \nMARCIA BERMAN \nAssistant Director, Federal Programs Branch \n \n/s/Amy E.

More specifically, Plaintiffs seek to \ncompel production of FISA applications and orders dating from mid-2016, “concerning the \nTrump Organization, President Trump, President Trump’s campaign for presidency, or people \nassociated with President Trump.” \nThe Government has made two acknowledgments arguably relevant to this request.  First, \nthe Department of Justice acknowledged, based upon the Congressional testimony of then-FBI \nDirector James B. Comey, that it has no records of alleged wiretapping of then-candidate Trump \nin Trump Tower by the Obama administration prior to the 2016 presidential election, as \nreferenced in President Trump’s Twitter post on March 4, 2017.  In addition, following the \nPresident’s declassification of a memorandum prepared by staff of the House Permanent Select \nCommittee on Intelligence (“HPSCI”), and the subsequent release of a different memorandum \nprepared by certain HPSCI members, the Department has acknowledged responsive Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”) applications and orders to conduct surveillance of Carter \nPage, and produced redacted versions of those documents.  With these limited exceptions, DOJ \nhas otherwise provided a “Glomar” response, declining to confirm or deny the existence of \nrecords for any other FISA surveillance responsive to Plaintiffs’ FOIA request. \nThe applications and orders related to Carter Page were properly located, processed, \nredacted and produced, with some pages being withheld in full.  These documents, at issue in \nseveral pending FOIA matters, are the first FISA applications ever processed for public release, \nand the FBI and DOJ devoted considerable resources to ensure that they were carefully \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 24 of 64\nprocessed, releasing information that matched prior public disclosures as well as other \ninformation that is not currently exempt.  The FBI declaration establishes that some withheld \ninformation is properly classified and exempt from disclosure because it pertains to intelligence \nactivities, sources, and methods, and/or foreign relations or foreign activities of the United \nStates, and its disclosure would cause harm to national security; it is therefore properly withheld \nunder Exemption 1.  The FBI’s declaration further establishes that disclosure of the withheld \ninformation would reveal intelligence sources and methods protected by Exemption 3 and the \nNational Security Act, as well as law enforcement information protected by Exemptions 7(A), \n7(D) and 7(E), and private information protected by Exemptions 6 and 7(C).  These records \nrelate to an ongoing national security investigation, and full disclosure would undermine and \nobstruct that investigation, compromise sources, and reveal nonpublic information about \nimportant law enforcement methods, disclosure of which risks circumvention of the law. \nThe partial Glomar response to the remainder of Plaintiffs’ FOIA request is proper.  The \ndeclarations establish that confirming or denying the existence of other responsive records would \nreveal classified information pertaining to intelligence sources and methods.  DOJ and the FBI \ndetermined that disclosure of the existence or non-existence of records for any other FISA \nsurveillance responsive to Plaintiffs’ FOIA request could reasonably be expected to cause harm \nto national security, and is exempt from disclosure pursuant to FOIA Exemption 1.  FBI has \nfurther determined that this information is exempt from disclosure under Exemptions 3, 7(A) and \n7(E).  This determination is entitled to substantial deference from this Court under well-settled \nlaw. \nThere has been no official acknowledgement of the existence or non-existence of FISA \napplications or orders as to a range of potential surveillance targets.  The limited official \nacknowledgements relevant to Plaintiffs’ FOIA request—then-Director Comey’s Congressional \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 25 of 64\ntestimony regarding the non-existence of records of alleged wiretapping of then-candidate \nTrump in Trump Tower by the Obama Administration prior to the 2016 presidential election, and \nthe extraordinary and unprecedented acknowledgement of the existence of FISA applications and \norders to conduct surveillance of Carter Page—satisfy the exacting criteria for official disclosure \nof classified information responsive to Plaintiffs’ FOIA request, and the Department’s response \nis consistent with those disclosures.  But there have been no other official disclosures that \nspecifically reveal the existence or non-existence of the particular alleged FISA surveillance that \nPlaintiffs seek to discover.  Accordingly, the Glomar response as to the remaining portions of \nPlaintiffs’ request is proper.  The Court should defer to Defendant’s determination in this regard \nand grant the Government summary judgment. \nBACKGROUND \nAdministrative and Procedural Background \nThis matter arises from nearly identical FOIA requests submitted to the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation (“FBI”) and DOJ’s National Security Division (“NSD”) on March 6, 2017, in \nwhich Plaintiffs sought records related to specific individuals and organizations allegedly subject \nto surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”).  Specifically, Plaintiffs \nsought: \n1)  Any orders by the FISC authorizing surveillance of and/or \ncollection of information concerning the Trump Organization, \nPresident Trump, President Trump’s campaign for presidency, or \npeople associated with President Trump. \n2)  Any applications to the FISC seeking authorization for \nsurveillance of and/or collection of information concerning the \nTrump Organization, President Trump, President Trump’s \ncampaign for presidency, or people associated with President \nTrump. \n3)  Any minimization procedures issued by the FISC and that \napplied to any orders issued that fall within the scope of #1 or #2. \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 26 of 64\nSee Third Declaration of David Hardy, dated October 19, 2018, ¶ 6 (citing 1st Hardy Decl., Dkt. \n13-3, ¶ 5 & Exhibit A (FOIA Request));1 Declaration of Patrick N. Findlay, dated October 19, \n2018, ¶ 4 & Exhibit A (FOIA Request).  The requests limited the search to June 2016 to the date \nof the request.  Id.  JMP quoted certain public statements by President Trump and asserted that \nthe requesters “are pre-emptively asserting that President Trump’s public comments constitute \nprior official disclosure of the existence of at least one, if not more, FISA warrants.”  Id. \n  By email dated March 17, 2017, NSD refused to confirm or deny the existence of \nresponsive records pursuant to Exemption 1, explaining that to confirm or deny the existence of \nresponsive records would reveal information that is properly classified under Executive Order \n13526.  See Findlay Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. B (NSD Response).  This is known as a “Glomar” response, \nand is proper if the fact of the existence or non-existence of agency records is protected by a \nFOIA exemption.  See Phillippi v. CIA, 546 F.2d 1009, 1011 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (acknowledging \nCIA refusal to confirm or deny existence of records regarding activities of a ship named Hughes \nGlomar Explorer).   On the same day, Plaintiffs appealed the determination to the DOJ Office of \nInformation Policy (“OIP”).  On April 12, 2017, OIP affirmed the determination of NSD – that \nthe existence or non-existence of responsive records is a properly classified fact.  See Findlay \nDecl. ¶ 6 & Ex. C (OIP Determination).  \n  By letter dated March 16, 2017, the FBI acknowledged receipt of Plaintiffs’ request, and \non April 4, 2017, the FBI also issued a Glomar response.  The FBI’s Glomar response was based \non FOIA Exemptions (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(7)(A), and (b)(7)(E).  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 7 (citing 1st \nHardy Decl., Dkt. 13-3, ¶ 11 & Ex. D). \n                                                           \n1 A redacted version of the Hardy Declaration is filed herewith on the public record.  A classified \nversion of the declaration is being concurrently lodged with the Court ex parte and in camera, in \norder to more fully explain the basis for the withholding of exempt information. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 27 of 64\n  Plaintiffs filed a Complaint on April 4, 2017 and an Amended Complaint was filed on \nApril 15, 2017.  See Compl., ECF No. 1; Am. Compl. ECF No. 5. \n  The parties briefed cross-motions for summary judgment in summer and fall of 2017, and \nDefendant defended the Glomar response.  In light of subsequent disclosures, DOJ sought to \nwithdraw its motion for summary judgment and set a schedule for processing the acknowledged \nCarter Page materials.  After the Carter Page materials were processed and released, the Court \nset a schedule for further briefing.  Dkt. No. 38. \nFactual Background \nPlaintiffs’ FOIA request arises in a factual context in which there is an ongoing, \nacknowledged official investigation related to the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the \n2016 presidential election.  Specifically, the Department has acknowledged a national security \ninvestigation of “the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election[, \nincluding] the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and \nthe Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and \nRussia’s efforts [and] an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.”  See The \nWashington Post, Full transcript: FBI Director James Comey testifies on Russian interference in \n2016 election (Mar. 20, 2017), https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-\npolitics/wp/2017/03/20/full-transcript-fbi-director-james-comey-testifies-on-russian-interference-\nin-2016-election/?utm_term=.b9f19a0cf9cf; 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 14 & n.3.  The investigation into \nRussian election interference is now under the direction of Special Counsel Robert Mueller.  See \nOffice of the Dep. Att’y General, Order No. 3915-2017, Appointment of Special Counsel to \nInvestigate Russian Interference with the 2016 Presidential Election and Related Matters (May \n17, 2017), https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/967231 /download; 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ \n16. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 28 of 64\nOn March 4, 2017, President Trump’s Twitter account made a four-part post, \ncomplaining that President Obama had Mr. Trump’s “wires tapped in Trump Tower just before \nthe victory.”  See https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump.  During sworn testimony before the \nHouse Permanent Selection Committee on Intelligence (“HPSCI”) on March 20, 2017, then-FBI \nDirector James B. Comey was asked about this by Congressman Schiff and responded to address \nthis specific statement: \nWith respect to the President’s tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at \nhim by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those \ntweets and we have looked carefully inside the FBI. The Department of \nJustice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the \nDepartment of Justice and all its components. The Department has no \ninformation that supports those tweets. \n \nSee Full transcript: FBI Director James Comey testifies on Russian interference in 2016 election \n(Mar. 20, 2017); 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 26; Findlay Decl. ¶ 8.2   \n  In March 2017, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (“HPSCI”) \nannounced an investigation into “the Russian active measures campaign targeting the 2016 U.S. \nelection” and later added additional areas of inquiry, including allegations regarding the \npurported “FISA abuse.”  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 15.  HPSCI’s review led to competing \nmemoranda authored by the Majority and the Minority members – often referred to by the names \nof the Chairman and the Ranking Member, i.e., as the “Nunes Memo” and the “Schiff Memo.”  \nBoth memoranda were initially classified because, at a minimum, they revealed FISA-authorized \nsurveillance on an identified target – Carter Page – which was a properly classified fact.  Id. ¶ 17. \n                                                           \n2 The Department has subsequently confirmed Director Comey’s conclusion in several FOIA \nmatters.  In the first round of summary judgment briefing in this case, Defendant specifically \nacknowledged this statement and noted that “Had plaintiff more specifically tied his FOIA \nrequest to the information in the tweets, he likely would have received a no-records response \nfrom the FBI and DOJ.”  Dkt. No. 13, at 20. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 29 of 64\nIn February 2018, President Trump authorized the declassification of the Nunes Memo, dated \nJanuary 18, 2018.  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 19; Findlay Decl. ¶ 9; \nhttp://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/memo_and_white_house_letter.pdf.   \nAs set forth in a February 2, 2018, letter from the White House Counsel, the Nunes \nMemo was declassified “in light of the significant public interest in the memorandum,” and \n“reflects the judgments of its congressional authors.”  Id.  Approximately three weeks after the \npublic disclosure of the Nunes Memo, an unclassified, redacted version of the Schiff Memo, \ndated January 29, 2018, addressed to All Members of the House of Representatives, and entitled \n“Correcting the Record – The Russia Investigations” (“Minority Memo”), was released.  See 3rd \nHardy Decl. ¶¶ 20-22, also available at https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/ \nhpsci_redacted_minority_memo.pdf (last visited Sept. 13, 2018).  Prior to its release, the FBI \nreviewed the Schiff Memo and redacted classified information unaffected by the President’s \ndeclassification of the Nunes Memo.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 21.  The FBI did not declassify additional \ninformation as part of this review.  Id.  Neither the Majority nor the Minority asked the FBI or \nthe Department to opine on their judgment or conclusions, and neither the FBI nor the \nDepartment did so; rather, both memoranda reflect the judgments of their congressional authors.  \nId. ¶ 22.3 \nBecause the declassification of the Majority Memo and the subsequent release of the \nredacted Minority Memo both revealed the existence of certain FISA applications and orders to \nconduct surveillance of Carter Page, the Department reviewed the FISA applications and orders \n                                                           \n3 One other Congressional memorandum references the Page FISA applications.  After the \ndeclassification of the Nunes Memo, the FBI conducted a classification review of a January 4, \n2018 memorandum from Senators Grassley and Graham as well.  As with the other memoranda, \nthis memorandum reflects the judgments of its Congressional authors.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 22 & n. \n6. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 30 of 64\nfor potential release of segregable information in response to Plaintiffs’ FOIA request.4  See 3rd \nHardy Decl. ¶¶ 24, 31-34, 134; Findlay Decl. ¶ 9.  On July 20, 2018, DOJ and the FBI released \nall responsive, non-exempt and reasonably segregable information subject to FOIA – releasing \n412 pages with redactions and withholding 186 pages in full.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 4, 134-35; \nFindlay Decl. ¶¶ 9-12; see also https://vault.fbi.gov/d1-release/d1-release.   The redactions are \ncoded by application exemption and certain categories within exemptions.  3rd Hardy Decl.  ¶¶ \n31-34.  DOJ is thus no longer asserting a Glomar response with respect to the fact that Page was \nthe subject of these FISA applications and orders.  Id. ¶ 4; Findlay Decl. ¶ 13.  This FOIA release \nwas unprecedented—prior to the release, there had never been any public disclosure of an \napplication to the FISC or an order from the FISC pertaining to a specific individual surveillance \ntarget.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 13; Findlay Decl. ¶ 12. \nOther than the above-described disclosures, no authorized Government official has \nconfirmed or denied the existence of responsive FISA-related records.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 27, \n143; Findlay Decl. ¶ 23.5  Accordingly, DOJ maintains its Glomar response with respect to the \nremainder of Plaintiffs’ request and refuses to confirm or deny the existence of other responsive \nrecords. \n \n \n                                                           \n4 Although Page was not associated with the Trump campaign when the initial FISA order was \nobtained, the Page FISA applications and orders were deemed to be responsive at least to that \nportion of Plaintiffs’ FOIA request that seeks FISA applications and orders “concerning . . . \npeople associated with President Trump.” \n5 On September 17, 2018, the White House Press Secretary announced that President Trump was \ndirecting DOJ and ODNI to “provide for immediate declassification of” certain documents, \nincluding additional pages of the Page documents.  See Statement from the Press Secretary, \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-34/.   The President \nlater indicated that he was no longer requiring immediate declassification of these documents at \nthis time. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 31 of 64\nARGUMENT \nI.  Statutory Standards.  \nA.  The Freedom of Information Act  \nThe “basic purpose” of FOIA reflects a “general philosophy of full agency disclosure \nunless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language.” John Doe Agency v. \nJohn Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146, 152 (1989) (citation omitted).  “Congress recognized, however, \nthat public disclosure is not always in the public interest . . . .”  CIA v. Sims, 471 U.S. 159, 166–\n67 (1985).  Accordingly, in passing FOIA, “Congress sought ‘to reach a workable balance \nbetween the right of the public to know and the need of the Government to keep information in \nconfidence to the extent necessary without permitting indiscriminate secrecy.’”  John Doe \nAgency, 493 U.S. at 152 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 89-1497, at 6 (1966), reprinted in 1966 \nU.S.C.C.A.N. 2418, 2423).  As the D.C. Circuit has recognized, “FOIA represents a balance \nstruck by Congress between the public’s right to know and the [G]overnment’s legitimate \ninterest in keeping certain information confidential.”  Ctr. for Nat’l Sec. Studies v. DOJ, 331 \nF.3d 918, 925 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (citing John Doe Agency, 493 U.S. at 152).  \nFOIA mandates disclosure of government records unless the requested information falls \nwithin one of nine enumerated exemptions.  See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b).  “A district court only has \njurisdiction to compel an agency to disclose improperly withheld agency records,” i.e. records \nthat do “not fall within an exemption.”  Minier v. CIA, 88 F.3d 796, 803 (9th Cir. 1996); see also \n5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) (providing the district court with jurisdiction only “to enjoin the agency \nfrom withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly \nwithheld from the complainant”); Kissinger v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 445 \nU.S. 136, 150 (1980) (“Under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B)[,] federal jurisdiction is dependent upon a \nshowing that an agency has (1) ‘improperly’; (2) ‘withheld’; (3) ‘agency records.’”).  While \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 32 of 64\nnarrowly construed, FOIA’s statutory exemptions “are intended to have meaningful reach and \napplication.” John Doe Agency, 493 U.S. at 152; accord DiBacco v.U.S. Army, 795 F.3d 178, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  \nThe courts resolve most FOIA actions on summary judgment.  See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. \nDep't of the Navy, 25 F. Supp. 3d 131, 136 (D.D.C. 2014).  The Government bears the burden of \nproving that the withheld information falls within the exemptions it invokes.  See 5 U.S.C. § \n552(a)(4)(B); King v. DOJ, 830 F.2d 210, 217 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  A court may grant summary \njudgment to the Government based entirely on an agency’s declarations, provided they articulate \n“the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific detail, demonstrate that the \ninformation withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption, and are not controverted by \neither contrary evidence in the record nor by evidence of agency bad faith.” Military Audit \nProject v. Casey, 656 F.2d 724, 738 (D.C. Cir. 1981); accord Gov’t Accountability Project v. \nFood & Drug Admin., 206 F. Supp. 3d 420, 430 (D.D.C. 2016).  Such declarations are accorded \n“a presumption of good faith, which cannot be rebutted by purely speculative claims[.]” \nSafeCard Servs., Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (citation omitted).  \nB.  Special Considerations in National Security Cases \nThe issues presented in this case directly “implicat[e] national security, a uniquely \nexecutive purview.” Ctr. for Nat’l Sec. Studies, 331 F.3d at 926–27.  While courts review de \nnovo an agency’s withholding of information pursuant to a FOIA request, “de novo review in \nFOIA cases is not everywhere alike . . . .”  Ass’n of Retired R.R. Workers, Inc. v. U.S. R.R. Ret. \nBd., 830 F.2d 331, 336 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  Indeed, the courts have specifically recognized the \n“propriety of deference to the executive in the context of FOIA claims which implicate national \nsecurity.”  Ctr. for Nat’l Sec. Studies, 331 F.3d at 927; see Ray v. Turner, 587 F.2d 1187, 1194 \n(D.C. Cir. 1978) (“[T]he executive ha[s] unique insights into what adverse [e]ffects might occur \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 33 of 64\nas a result of public disclosure of a particular classified record.”). “[A]ccordingly, the \ngovernment’s ‘arguments needs only be both ‘plausible’ and ‘logical’ to justify the invocation of \na FOIA exemption in the national security context.’” Unrow Human Rights Impact Litig. Clinic \nv. Dep’t of State, 134 F. Supp. 3d 263, 272 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting ACLU v. Dep’t of Def., 628 \nF.3d 612, 624 (D.C. Cir. 2011)).  \nFor these reasons, the courts have “consistently deferred to executive affidavits predicting \nharm to the national security, and have found it unwise to undertake searching judicial review.”  \nCtr. for Nat’l Sec. Studies, 331 F.3d at 927; see Larson v. Dep’t of State, 565 F.3d 857, 865 \n(D.C. Cir. 2009) (citation omitted) (“Today we reaffirm our deferential posture in FOIA cases \nregarding the ‘uniquely executive purview’ of national security.”); accord Unrow Human Rights \nImpact Litig. Clinic, 134 F. Supp. 3d at 272.  Consequently, a reviewing court must afford \n“substantial weight” to agency declarations “in the national security context.”  King, 830 F.2d at \n217; see Fitzgibbon v. CIA, 911 F.2d 755, 766 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (holding that the district court \nerred in “perform[ing] its own calculus as to whether or not harm to the national security or to \nintelligence sources and methods would result from disclosure . . . .”); Frugone v. CIA, 169 F.3d \n772, 775 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (because “courts have little expertise in either international diplomacy \nor counterintelligence operations, we are in no position to dismiss the CIA’s facially reasonable \nconcerns” about the harm that disclosure could cause to national security).  FOIA “bars the \ncourts from prying loose from the government even the smallest bit of information that is \nproperly classified or would disclose intelligence sources or methods.” Afshar v. Dep’t of State, \n702 F.2d 1125, 1130 (D.C. Cir. 1983). \nC.  The Glomar Response. \nA Glomar response allows the Government to “refuse to confirm or deny the existence of \nrecords where to answer the FOIA inquiry would cause harm cognizable under an FOIA \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 34 of 64\nexception.”  Wolf v. CIA, 473 F.3d 370, 374 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (quoting Gardels v. CIA, 689 F.2d \n1100, 1103 (D.C. Cir. 1982)); accord Wilner v. NSA, 592 F.3d 60, 68 (2d Cir. 2009) (“The \nGlomar doctrine is well settled as a proper response to a FOIA request because it is the only way \nin which an agency may assert that a particular FOIA statutory exemption covers the ‘existence \nor non-existence of the requested records[.]’” (quoting Phillippi v. CIA, 546 F.2d 1009, 1012 \n(D.C. Cir. 1976)).  In support of a Glomar response, the asserting agency “must explain why it \ncan neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records.”  James Madison Project v. \nDOJ, 208 F. Supp. 3d 265, 283 (D.D.C. 2016) (quoting Parker v. EOUSA, 852 F. Supp. 2d 1, 10 \n(D.D.C. 2012)).  The agency can satisfy this obligation by providing “public affidavit[s] \nexplaining in as much detail as is possible the basis for its claim that it can be required neither to \nconfirm nor to deny the existence of the requested records.”  Phillippi, 546 F.2d at 1013. \nThe courts in this Circuit have consistently upheld Glomar responses where, as here, confirming \nor denying the existence of records would reveal classified information protected by FOIA \nExemption 1.  See, e.g., Frugone, 169 F.3d at 774–75 (finding that CIA properly refused to \nconfirm or deny the existence of records concerning the plaintiff’s alleged employment \nrelationship with CIA pursuant to Exemptions 1 and 3); Larson, 565 F.3d at 861–62 (upholding \nthe National Security Agency’s use of the Glomar response to the plaintiffs’ FOIA requests \nregarding past violence in Guatemala pursuant to Exemptions 1 and 3); Wheeler v. CIA, 271 F. \nSupp. 2d 132, 140 (D.D.C. 2003) (ruling that CIA properly invoked a Glomar response to a \nrequest for records concerning the plaintiff’s activities as a journalist in Cuba during the 1960s \npursuant to Exemption 1). \n \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 35 of 64\nII.  DOJ Conducted a Reasonable Search for Responsive Records Related to \nAcknowledged Surveillance of Carter Page and Properly Released Redacted \nRecords. \n \nNSD and the FBI searched for the acknowledged FISA applications and orders related to \nCarter Page.  The 412 released pages reflect information properly redacted under Exemptions 1, \n3, 6, 7(A), 7(C), 7(D), 7(E).   The withheld in full pages from the FISA applications and orders \nwere properly withheld pursuant to Exemptions 1, 3, 7(A) and 7(E). \nA.   DOJ Conducted a Reasonable Search. \nAn agency is entitled to summary judgment in a FOIA case with respect to the adequacy \nof its search if it shows “‘that it made a good faith effort to conduct a search for the requested \nrecords, using methods which can be reasonably expected to produce the information \nrequested.’” Clemente v. FBI, 867 F.3d 111, 117 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quoting Oglesby v. Dep’t of \nthe Army, 920 F.2d 57, 68 (D.C. Cir. 1990)); DiBacco, 795 F.3d at 188.  “[T]he issue to be \nresolved is not whether there might exist any other documents possibly responsive to the request, \nbut rather whether the search for those documents was adequate.”  Weisberg v. DOJ, 745 F.2d \n1476, 1485 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (emphasis in original).  The search is thus gauged “not by the fruits \nof the search, but by the appropriateness of the methods used to carry out the search.” Ancient \nCoin Collectors Guild v. Dep’t of State, 641 F.3d 504, 514 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Iturralde v. \nComptroller of Currency, 315 F.3d 311, 315 (D.C. Cir. 2003)).  An agency can establish the \nreasonableness of its search by “reasonably detailed, nonconclusory affidavits describing its \nefforts.”  Baker & Hostetler LLP v. Dep’t of Commerce, 473 F.3d 312, 318 (D.C. Cir. 2006). \nSuch affidavits are sufficient if they “set[] forth the search terms and the type of search \nperformed, and aver[] that all files likely to contain responsive materials (if such records exist) \nwere searched.”  Chambers v. Dep’t of Interior, 568 F.3d 998, 1003 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting \nMcCready v. Nicholson, 465 F.3d 1, 14 (D.C. Cir. 2006)).  This standard is not demanding. “[I]n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 36 of 64\nthe absence of countervailing evidence or apparent inconsistency of proof, affidavits that explain \nin reasonable detail the scope and method of the search conducted by the agency will suffice . . . \n. “ Perry v. Block, 684 F.2d 121, 127 (D.C. Cir. 1982).  “Agency affidavits are accorded a \npresumption of good faith, which cannot be rebutted by ‘purely speculative claims about the \nexistence and discoverability of other documents.’” SafeCard Servs., Inc., 926 F.2d at 1200 \n(citation omitted). \n  The declarations demonstrate that NSD and the FBI conducted a reasonable search for \nrecords responsive to Plaintiffs’ FOIA request insofar as it relates to the acknowledged Carter \nPage FISA applications.  The official acknowledgement at issue here was limited to four specific \nFISA applications, submitted for surveillance on Carter Page, starting in October 2016 and \ncontinuing through three renewals, with accompanying FISA orders.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 28.  \nGiven the information pinpointing the specific responsive records, FBI and NSD FOIA \npersonnel consulted with knowledgeable officials in both components familiar with the \ninvestigation to locate the four responsive FISA packages, encompassing the acknowledged \napplications and orders related to Carter Page.  Id. ¶¶ 28-30; Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 10-11.   As set \nforth in the Hardy Declaration, the request for minimization procedures did not require a separate \nsearch because those procedures are set forth in the packages.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 30.  The FBI \nand the National Security Division compared records and confirmed that they had complete \ncopies of each of the four FISA packages whose existence had been officially acknowledged.  Id. \n¶ 28.  FBI then coordinated the processing of the documents, in consultation with interested \ncomponents.  Id. ¶ 31; Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 11-12 & n. 6. \n  This strategy – identifying the personnel responsible for the requested FISC information, \nand asking them to search their records – is a “method[] which can be reasonably expected to \nproduce the information requested.” Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68; see also James Madison Project v. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 37 of 64\nDOJ, 267 F. Supp. 3d 154, 160-61 (D.D.C. 2017).  Therefore, DOJ is entitled to summary \njudgment on this issue. \nB.  DOJ Properly Redacted Classified Information in the Carter Page Documents \nPursuant to Exemption 1.6 \n \n(1) Exemption One Standards. \nFOIA Exemption 1 exempts from disclosure information that is “specifically authorized \nunder criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national \ndefense or foreign policy” and “are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order.” \n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1).  Under Executive Order No. 13,526, an agency may withhold information \nthat an official with original classification authority has determined to be classified because its \n“unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause identifiable or describable \ndamage to the national security[.]”  Exec. Order No. 13,526 § 1.4, 75 Fed. Reg. 707, 709 (Dec. \n29, 2009).  The information must also “pertain[] to” one of the categories of information \nspecified in the Executive Order, including “intelligence activities (including covert action), \nintelligence sources or methods,” Exec. Order No. 13,526 §§ 1.4(c); or “foreign relations or \nforeign activities of the United States, including confidential sources,” id. §1.4(d).  See also \nJudicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Defense, 715 F.3d 937, 941 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (citation omitted) \n(“‘[P]ertains’ is ‘not a very demanding verb.’”).  As discussed above, a court “accord[s] \nsubstantial weight to an agency’s affidavit concerning the details of the classified status of the \ndisputed record because the Executive departments responsible for national defense and foreign \npolicy matters have unique insights into what adverse [e]ffects might occur as a result of a \nparticular classified record.”  Larson, 565 F.3d at 864 (citation omitted). \n                                                           \n6 The FBI coordinated the review of these documents, and NSD participated in the process.  \nAccordingly, the FBI is asserting all applicable exemptions over these materials.  Findlay Decl. ¶ \n12 & n.6; 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 31. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 38 of 64\n(2) DOJ Properly Withheld Information Pertaining to Intelligence Activities, \nSources and Methods. \n \nDefendant redacted portions of the Carter Page FISA applications and orders to safeguard \ncurrently and properly classified information involving categories of information set forth in \nSection 1.4 of Executive Order 13,526.  See 3rd Hardy Decl. at ¶¶ 35-67.  Id.  First, the redacted \ninformation pertains to “intelligence activities (including covert action), intelligence sources or \nmethods, or cryptology.” Exec. Order 13,526 §1.4(c).  FISA surveillance is an intelligence \nmethod, and the request on its face seeks information pertaining to FISA surveillance.  The \nsupporting declaration establishes that information redacted from these FISA packages \nencompasses “the FBI’s intelligence interests, priorities, activities and methods; undisclosed \nintelligence sources or methods upon which the FBI relied in support of its application for FISA \nauthorized surveillance of Carter Page, as well as undisclosed portions of intelligence \ninformation provided by Source #1; and information about the use and implementation of \nvarious intelligence methods.”  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 49. \nThe Third Hardy Declaration identifies two general categories of information withheld on \nthis basis and describes the specific harm to national security that would result from disclosure:  \nactivities and methods; and intelligence sources.  First, the redacted information includes details \nabout the FISA surveillance sought and obtained through the FISA applications and orders – \nsuch as dates, locations, intended purposes, and specific methods -- as well as detailed, \nundisclosed information about other intelligence activities and methods forming part of the \nunderlying basis for the applications.  3rd Hardy Decl.  ¶ 50.  The withheld information includes, \nfor example, detailed information about investigation of individuals other than Page, undisclosed \nmethods used to gather information about Page, detailed undisclosed information about a \nsource’s activities, and information about the specific amounts and timeframes for payments to \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 39 of 64\nhuman sources.   Id. ¶¶ 56-59.  Additionally, the FBI redacted information that would reveal the \nexact timeframes of authorized surveillance and descriptions of exactly what was authorized, \nincluding minimization procedures.  Id. ¶¶ 51-53.  None of that information has been previously \ndisclosed and all of it would be valuable to adversaries seeking to analyze, undermine, and evade \nour counterintelligence apparatus.  This type of information reveals actual intelligence activities \nundertaken regarding specific targets during a specific timeframe, discloses intelligence-\ngathering capabilities of those methods, and provides an assessment of the level of FBI \npenetration of specific targets during a specific time frame.  Id. ¶ 58.  “Armed with such \ninformation, adversaries, including hostile foreign governments, could implement actions to \nthwart the FBI’s intelligence activities and weaken or negate the particular intelligence methods, \nwhich would severely disrupt the FBI’s intelligence-gathering capabilities.”  Id.  \nSecond, DOJ has redacted information that tends to identify particular intelligence \nsources.  As explained in the Third Hardy Declaration, “an intelligence source who requires \ncontinued classification is one that provided or is currently providing information that pertains to \nnational security matters, the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to result in \nserious damage to FBI’s intelligence-gathering capabilities.”  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 60.  Although the \nidentity of one source has been disclosed, the Page applications include identifying information \nfor other sources as well.  Id. ¶¶ 61-63.  Disclosure of intelligence sources “could reasonably be \nexpected to jeopardize their livelihoods, their families and other relationships, and even their \nlives” and disclosure of one source can cause other current and potential sources to fear \ndisclosure.  Id. ¶¶ 62-63.  Thus, disclosure of source-identifying information could reasonably be \nexpected to damage national security by endangering current and past sources and by \ndiscouraging current and potential sources from reporting.  Id.  Accordingly, such information is \nproperly redacted pursuant to Exemption 1. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 40 of 64\n(3) DOJ Properly Redacted Information Pertaining to Foreign Relations. \nThe Hardy Declaration establishes that DOJ also redacted certain information pertaining \nto foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, and that disclosure of this \ninformation would cause harm to national security.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 64-67.  Although Mr. \nHardy explains that further details cannot be provided on the public record, the redacted \ninformation relates to the United States’ interactions with foreign countries.  Id.  If disclosed, \nsuch information “can reasonably be expected to lead to diplomatic or economic retaliation, the \nloss of cooperation, or the compromise of cooperative foreign sources.”  Id.   The disclosure of \nspecific relationships could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to national security.  \nId.  Accordingly, such information is properly redacted pursuant to Exemption 1. 7 \nC.  DOJ Properly Withheld Information in the Carter Page Documents Pursuant to \nExemption 3, Including Information Protected By the National Security Act. \n \nExemption 3 exempts from disclosure records that are “specifically exempted from \ndisclosure by [another] statute” if the relevant statute “requires that the matters be withheld from \nthe public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue” or “establishes particular \ncriteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.”  5 U.S.C. § \n552(b)(3)(A).  The Government’s mandate to withhold information under FOIA Exemption 3 is \nbroader than its authority under FOIA Exemption 1, as it does not have to demonstrate that the \ndisclosure will harm national security.  See Sims, 471 U.S. at 167; Gardels, 689 F.2d at 1106–07. \nInstead, “the sole issue for decision is the existence of a relevant statute and the inclusion of \nwithheld material within the statute’s coverage.  It is particularly important to protect intelligence \nsources and methods from public disclosure.”  Morley v. CIA, 508 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. \n                                                           \n7 The classified Hardy Declaration provides additional information about the redaction of \nclassified information and the harm to national security that would result from disclosure. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 41 of 64\n2007).  In analyzing the propriety of a withholding made pursuant to FOIA Exemption 3, the \nCourt need not examine “the detailed factual contents of specific documents[.]” Id. \nDOJ has invoked Section 102A(i)(1) of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended \n(now codified at 50 U.S.C. § 3024(i)(1)), which requires the Director of National Intelligence to \n“protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.”  It is well-established \nthat Section 102A qualifies as a withholding statute for the purposes of FOIA Exemption 3.  See, \ne.g., ACLU v. Dep’t of Defense, 628 F.3d at 619.   In fact, the Supreme Court has recognized the \n“wide-ranging authority” provided by the National Security Act to protect intelligence sources \nand methods.  See Sims, 471 U.S. at 169–70, 177, 180; see Halperin v. CIA, 629 F.2d 144, 147 \n(D.C. Cir. 1980) (explaining that the only question for the court is whether the agency has shown \nthat responding to a FOIA request “could reasonably be expected to lead to unauthorized \ndisclosure of intelligence sources and methods”).  The Act has been properly invoked to \nwithhold information about FISA and other surveillance techniques.  See, e.g., Agility Pub. \nWarehousing Co. K.S.C. v. NSA, 113 F. Supp. 3d 313, 329 (D.D.C. 2015). \nAs explained above, information redacted from the Page FISA applications and orders \nincludes information that would disclose intelligence sources and methods.   See Part II.B.2, \nsupra.  Accordingly, DOJ properly concluded that it is also prohibited from disclosing such \ninformation under the National Security Act.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 68-72.   \nDOJ also redacted information pursuant to another Exemption 3 statute, which cannot be \npublicly identified without revealing the very information to be protected.  Id. ¶ 73.  The Court is \nreferred to the ex parte, in camera declaration for additional explanation. \n \n \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 42 of 64\nD.  DOJ Properly Withheld Information in the Carter Page Documents Pursuant to \nExemption 7(A). \n \n(1) Exemption 7 Threshold.  \nExemption 7 protects from disclosure all “records or information compiled for law \nenforcement purposes” that could reasonably be expected to cause one of the six harms outlined \nin the Exemption’s subparts. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7). “To fall within any of the exemptions under \nthe umbrella of Exemption 7, a record must have been ‘compiled for law enforcement \npurposes.’” Pub. Emps. for Envtl. Responsibility v. U.S. Section, Int’l Boundary & Water \nComm’n, U.S.-Mexico, 740 F.3d 195, 202 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)).  \nHere, DOJ records regarding FISA applications and orders are compiled in part for law \nenforcement purposes.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 74-79. \n(2) Exemption 7(A) Standards. \nExemption 7(A) “exempts from FOIA disclosure records or information compiled for \n‘law enforcement purposes . . . to the extent that the production . . . could reasonably be expected \nto interfere with enforcement proceedings.’” Shannahan v. IRS., 672 F.3d 1142, 1145 (9th Cir. \n2012) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A)).  “Exemption 7(A) reflects the Congress’s recognition \nthat ‘law enforcement agencies ha[ve] legitimate needs to keep certain records confidential, lest \nthe agencies be hindered in their investigations or placed at a disadvantage when it [comes] time \nto present their case.’” Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. DOJ, 746 F.3d 1082, \n1096 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (hereinafter “CREW”) (quoting NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 \nU.S. 214, 224 (1978)). \nAn ongoing investigation typically triggers Exemption 7(A).  See CREW, 746 F.3d at \n1098 (quoting Juarez v. DOJ, 518 F.3d 54, 59 (D.C. Cir. 2008)).  “In the typical case,” therefore, \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 43 of 64\n“the requested records relate to a specific individual or entity that is the subject of the ongoing \ninvestigation, making the likelihood of interference readily apparent.”  Id. \n(3) Disclosure of the Withheld Information Could Reasonably Be Expected to \nInterfere with the Russia Investigation. \n \nHere, the FBI sought and received authority under FISA to surveil Carter Page as part of \nand in furtherance of a pending proceeding – the ongoing Russian interference investigation.  See \n3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 82-83.  The redacted information reflects details relevant to the ongoing \ninvestigation, “making the likelihood of interference readily apparent.”  See CREW, 746 F.3d at \n1098. \nThe Third Hardy Declaration explains that disclosure of redacted information in the \nCarter Page FISA documents “could reasonably be expected to interfere with the pending \nRussian election interference investigation if publicly disclosed at this time.”  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ \n83.  The Third Hardy Declaration explains that the types of information that could reasonably be \nexpected to harm the investigation if disclosed include:  aspects of the investigation not \npreviously made public, what information or activities are or are not of interest to the \ninvestigators, areas in which there may be gaps in investigators’ knowledge that could be \nexploited, and the identities of potential witnesses and the information they provided.  Hardy \nDecl. ¶ 85.  Moreover, disclosure of confidential or classified sources risks curtailing their \ncooperation.  Id. ¶ 87.  Disclosure of the evidence relied upon risks influencing, compromising or \ntainting these or other witnesses, and risks revealing gaps in investigative information that can be \nexploited.  Id. ¶ 88.  Disclosure of specific investigative techniques used during specific time \nperiods and regarding specific subject matters creates similar risks, including efforts by \nadversaries or targets to undermine the techniques.  Id. ¶ 89.   \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 44 of 64\nThe FBI carefully considered whether information would match public information and \nwhether its disclosure would reasonably be expected to harm the investigation.  Id. ¶ 90.  \nAdditionally, although there has been widespread media coverage of the Russia investigation, \nofficial disclosures would cause greater harm to the investigation, regardless of whether it \nconfirmed or refuted media reporting.  Id. ¶ 84.  Accordingly, such information is properly \nwithheld pursuant to Exemption 7(A). \nE.  DOJ Properly Withheld Information in the Carter Page Documents Pursuant to \nExemption 7(D). \n \nDOJ properly withheld information under Exemption 7(D) because certain investigatory \ninformation would reveal the identity or information of confidential sources. \n(1) 7(D) Standards. \nExemption 7(D) permits the withholding or redacting of law enforcement records, the \nrelease of which “could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source . . \n. and, . . . [in the case of] an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence \ninvestigation, information furnished by a confidential source.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(D).  \nExemption 7(D) requires no balancing of public and private interests.  See Dow Jones & Co. v. \nDOJ, 917 F.2d 571, 575–76 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  The agency is entitled to withhold any \ninformation that could disclose a confidential source’s identity and, in the context of an agency \nconducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, to withhold the substance of the \ninformation furnished by such source.  See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(D); Dep’t of Justice v. Landano, \n508 U.S. 165, 172 (1993); Canning v. DOJ, 567 F. Supp. 2d 104, 111 (D.D.C. 2008). \nA confidential source is one who “provided information under an express assurance of \nconfidentiality or in circumstances from which such an assurance could be reasonably inferred.” \nLandano, 508 U.S. at 172.  Thus, Exemption 7(D) applies to protect the identity of a source if an \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 45 of 64\nagency establishes that a source has provided information under either an express or implied \npromise of confidentiality.  See Williams v. FBI, 69 F.3d 1155, 1159 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  In cases, \nsuch as this one, where the Government provides an express promise of confidentiality, “the \nissue is simple enough: The agency must present ‘probative evidence that the source . . . \nreceive[d] an express grant of confidentiality.’” Hodge v. FBI, 703 F.3d 575, 581 (D.C. Cir. \n2013) (quoting Campbell v. DOJ, 164 F.3d 20, 34 (D.C. Cir. 1998). \n(2) DOJ Properly Withheld Information Regarding Confidential Sources. \nHere, the FBI redacted certain non-public information regarding Christopher Steele \n(identified as “Source #1” in the documents), and all information about and from other \nconfidential human sources.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 112-17.  First, the Hardy Declaration establishes \nthat the FBI provided an express promise of confidentiality to Steele as part of the FBI’s \nprotocols for confidential human sources, and Steele in fact provided information in furtherance \nof a national security investigation.  Id. ¶¶ 115-16.  His information is therefore categorically \nexempt from disclosure under 7(D).  Nonetheless, Steele’s identity and some of his reporting has \nbeen publicly disclosed, and the FBI therefore has not redacted information that matches his \ninformation as disclosed in the Nunes and Schiff memoranda.  Id.  \nSecond, the FISA applications contain information from and about other sources who \nprovided information to the FBI and did so pursuant to express assurances of confidentiality.  Id. \n¶ 117.  Thus, the requirements of Exemption 7(D) are satisfied.  Confidential human sources \nproviding information to the FBI pursuant to assurances of confidentiality should be secure in the \nknowledge that their assistance will be held in confidence.  Id. ¶¶ 113-14.  Release of such \ninformation may eliminate a source and have a chilling effect on other current and potential \nsources, who need to know they can trust the FBI’s assurances of confidentiality.  Id.  \nAccordingly, the FBI properly redacted information pursuant to Exemption 7(D). \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 46 of 64\nF.  DOJ Properly Withheld Information in the Carter Page Documents Pursuant to \nExemption 7(E). \n \n(1) 7(E) Standards. \nExemption 7(E) authorizes withholding of information compiled for law enforcement \npurposes if release of the information “would disclose techniques and procedures for law \nenforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement \ninvestigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk \ncircumvention of the law.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E).  Congress intended that Exemption 7(E) \nprotect law enforcement techniques and procedures from disclosure, as well as techniques and \nprocedures used in all manner of investigations after crimes or other incidents have occurred. \nExemption 7(E) is written in broad and general terms to cover not only information that \nwill definitively lead to the circumvention of the law, but also information that risks \ncircumvention of the law.  Mayer Brown, LLP v. Internal Revenue Serv., 562 F.3d 1190, 1193 \n(D.C. Cir. 2009); Bigwood v. Dep’t of Defense, 132 F. Supp. 3d 124, 152–53 (D.D.C. 2015).  \nSatisfying the exemption is a “relatively low bar”.  See Blackwell v. FBI, 646 F.3d 37, 42 (D.C. \nCir. 2011).  The agency need not make a “highly specific ... showing” of risk of circumvention of \nthe law, but only “demonstrate logically how the release of the requested information might \ncreate” such a risk.  Id. (quoting Mayer Brown, 562 F.3d at 1194).  Nor must the agency \ndemonstrate “an actual or certain risk of circumvention” of the law; rather the agency need only \nshow “the chance of a reasonably expected risk.”  Mayer Brown, 562 F.3d at 1193. \nImportantly, the range of “law enforcement purposes” covered by Exemption 7(E) \nincludes not only traditional criminal law enforcement duties, but also proactive steps taken by \nthe government designed to prevent terrorism and to maintain national security.  See Ctr. for \nNat’l Sec. Studies, 331 F.3d at 926; Bigwood, 132 F. Supp. 3d at 152; see also Milner v. Dep’t of \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 47 of 64\nthe Navy, 562 U.S. 562, 582 (2011) (“Particularly in recent years, terrorism prevention and \nnational security measures have been recognized as vital to effective law enforcement efforts in \nour Nation.”) (Alito, J., concurring).  \n(2) DOJ Properly Withheld Information About Law Enforcement Techniques that \nRisks Circumvention of the Law. \n \nThe withholdings easily satisfy the “relatively low” Exemption 7(E) standard here.  The \nentirety of the FISA packages are a law enforcement technique, whose details were not \npreviously known to the public, and such FISA applications have never previously been \nprocessed for public release.  Accordingly, the applications and orders contain a substantial \namount of still nonpublic information about this law enforcement technique and how it is used in \nparticular contexts.  The Third Hardy Declaration describes eight categories of information \nwithheld under 7(E).8  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 119-33. \nFirst, DOJ withheld information about the investigative focus of these particular FISA \napplications and orders.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 120.  Together, the information in these applications \nreveals how the FBI conducted certain aspects of the investigation to that date and a road-map of \ncertain contemplated investigative steps.  Id.  Although the general techniques authorized by the \nFISA are publicly known, this detailed information about how, when, where and why such \nauthorities are employed in this particular investigation is not publicly known.  Id.  Such details \nwould be useful to criminals and other adversaries as a guide to adjust their own behavior and \ndevelop effective countermeasures.  Id.  \nSecond, DOJ withheld information about the collection and analysis of information it \n                                                           \n8 Each category is separately coded on the redacted documents.  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 34.  These \ncategories often overlap, and redactions may be coded to more than one category.  For example, \nspecific techniques described to the Court are protected under category three, but also tend to \nshow the focus of the investigation under category one based on which investigative activities \nwere ongoing when and where. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 48 of 64\nobtains for investigative purposes, including how and where the FBI collects particular types of \ninformation and the methodologies employed to analyze it.   Id. ¶¶ 121-23. Such disclosures \nwould enable subjects of investigations to identify when these or similar techniques are or might \nbe used and take countermeasures.  Id.  \nThird, DOJ withheld specific techniques authorized for and used in national security \ninvestigations.  Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 124-26.  This category includes:  techniques that have not been \npublicly disclosed in this specific context, details about other techniques that have been disclosed \ngenerally, and those techniques specifically considered or authorized by the FISC here.  Id. ¶ \n124.  The disclosure of techniques in this particular context would have important ramifications \non the use of such techniques in other national security cases.  Id.  Although the techniques \nauthorized by FISA are publicly known, detailed information about how, when, where and why \nsuch authorities are employed in a particular investigation is not publicly known.   Id.  \nAggregated, such information provides a roadmap to counterintelligence investigations and \nwould give sophisticated adversaries the information necessary to take countermeasures.  Id.  \nFourth, DOJ redacted specific databases used by the FBI for investigative purposes.  It is \nnot publicly known under what circumstances the FBI utilizes these particular databases, \nparticularly in the context of a national security investigation.  Id. ¶ 127.  And their disclosure \nwould provide another useful data point useful to spies, criminals and others intent on avoiding \nFBI attention and developing countermeasures.  Id.  \nFifth, DOJ withheld specific information about payments to confidential human sources.  \nWhile it is publicly known that FBI pays such sources, the details of when, for what, and how \nmuch sources are paid are aspects of this technique that are not made public in order to protect \nthe viability of this technique.   Id. ¶ 128.  Moreover, the amount paid to a particular confidential \nhuman source could suggest the relative volume or importance of information provided by a \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 49 of 64\nsource, leading people who believe they are subjects of such source reporting to assess the \nlikelihood that their activities have come to the FBI’s attention.  Id. ¶¶ 128-29.  And it could \nreveal important non-public information about the level of resources devoted to particular \ninvestigations or subjects.  Id.  \nSixth, DOJ withheld detailed information about the targets, dates and scope of \nsurveillance.  While it is known that the FBI conducts FISA surveillance and specifically \nconducted surveillance directed at Page, the details about how such surveillance was \ninvestigatively or technically implemented, the locations targeted by the surveillance, and the \nspecific time periods under which the surveillance was conducted are not public.  Id. ¶ 130.  \nDisclosure of such details about how and when the FBI conducts surveillance would create a \nmosaic that criminals and other adversaries could use to predict when and where such \nsurveillance may occur, detect it, and to develop and utilize countermeasures.  Id.  \nSeventh, DOJ redacted information regarding dates and types of FBI investigations.  In \nparticular, the FBI protected information that identifies the type of a particular investigation, \nwhether it is a “preliminary” or “full” investigation, and the time period of the particular \ninvestigation.  Id. ¶ 131.  Disclosure would allow individuals to know what types of activities \nwould trigger which type of investigation and allow them to deduce applicable time periods.  Id. \nDisclosure that a particular activity warrants investigation could cause individuals to adjust \nconduct to avoid detection.  Id.  \nEighth, DOJ redacted investigative strategies for particular evidence.  The FBI redacted \ninformation that describes a specific purpose for which it might use information gathered as a \nresult of its FISA authorized surveillance of Page.  Id. ¶¶ 132-33.  Publicly disclosing this \ninformation would permit targets of FBI investigative activities to anticipate such activities and \ntake effective countermeasures.  Id.  \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 50 of 64\nG. DOJ Properly Withheld Private Information in the Carter Page Documents \nPursuant to Exemptions 6 and/or 7(C). \n \n(1) Applicable Exemptions. \nTwo FOIA exemptions cover different types of private information redacted in these \ndocuments.  First, Exemption 6 allows agencies to withhold “personnel and medical files and \nsimilar files” whenever “disclosure . . . would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of \npersonal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6).  To determine whether a file qualifies as “similar” to \n“personnel or medical files,” courts examine whether information in that file “applies to a \nparticular individual.”  Dep’t of State v. Wash. Post Co., 456 U.S. 595, 601-02 (1982).  \nTherefore, not only does the exemption protect files, “but also bits of personal information, such \nas names and addresses, the release of which would create a palpable threat to privacy.”  Prison \nLegal News v. Samuels, 787 F.3d 1142, 1147 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citation omitted).  If the threshold \nrequirement is met, a court must next ask whether disclosure would compromise a “substantial” \nprivacy interest, since FOIA requires the release of information “[i]f no significant privacy \ninterest is implicated . . . .”  Multi Ag Media LLC v. Dep’t of Agric., 515 F.3d 1224, 1229 (D.C. \nCir. 2008) (citation omitted).  “Anything greater than a de minimis privacy interest” is generally \nsufficient.  Id. at 1229–30.  Finally, courts test whether release of such information would \nconstitute a “clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,” Wash. Post Co. v. Dep’t of \nHealth & Human Servs., 690 F.2d 252, 260 (D.C. Cir. 1982), by balancing “the privacy interest \nthat would be compromised by disclosure against any public interest in the requested \ninformation,” Multi Ag Media, 515 F.3d at 1228.  Courts examine the “public need for the \ninformation” in light of “the basic purpose of [FOIA] to open agency action to the light of public \nscrutiny, rather than . . . the particular purpose for which the document is being requested.” DOJ \nv. Reporters Comm. For Freedom of Press, 489 U.S. 749, 772 (1989) (internal citations omitted). \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 51 of 64\n“That purpose . . . is not fostered by disclosure of information about private citizens that is \naccumulated in various governmental files but that reveals little or nothing about an agency’s \nown conduct.”  Id. at 773. \nSecond, under Exemption 7(C), an agency is exempt from producing “records or \ninformation compiled for law enforcement purposes . . . to the extent that the production of such \nlaw enforcement records or information . . . could reasonably be expected to constitute an \nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C).  In determining whether \nthis exemption applies to particular information, a court must balance the privacy interests of \nindividuals mentioned in the records against the public interest in disclosure.  See ACLU v. DOJ, \n655 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  The privacy interest at stake belongs to the individual, not the \ngovernment agency, see Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 763–65, and “individuals have a strong \ninterest in not being associated unwarrantedly with alleged criminal activity,” Stern v. FBI, 737 \nF.2d 84, 91–92 (D.C. Cir. 1984). \n(2) DOJ Properly Withheld Private Information. \nHere, the Third Hardy Declaration establishes that several categories of private or \npersonally identifying information are properly redacted.  First, DOJ withheld the names of the \nFBI agents who signed the Page FISA applications under Exemption 6 and 7(C).  Such agents \ncan become the target of harassing inquiries or threats, a risk that is heightened in the context of \nnational security or counterintelligence cases.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 96-101.  They have substantial \nprivacy interests in avoiding such harassment or threats, an interest that is heightened by the high \nprofile nature of the investigation.  Id.  Finally, there is no legitimate public interest in these \nidentities, which would not inform the public understanding of the Page warrants, the Russia \ninvestigation or anything else.  Id.  Accordingly, the FBI properly protected these names. \nSecond, DOJ withheld certain personal information about Carter Page.  While FISC-\n29 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 52 of 64\nauthorized surveillance of Carter Page has been officially acknowledged, there remains \ninformation not previously made public by the Government and in which he retains a privacy \ninterest.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 102-05.  Although there is a demonstrated public interest in these \napplications, the particular information redacted would not substantially increase the public’s \nunderstanding of this matter.  Id.  \nThird, DOJ withheld identifying information about a FISC deputy clerk and the career \nNSD attorney who submitted the FISA applications to the FISC.  Id. ¶¶ 106-109.  Such \nemployees could become targets of harassing inquiries or threats, and they may be targeted by \nforeign powers; in contrast, there is no public interest in their identities.  Id.  Accordingly, their \nidentifying information was properly redacted. \nFinally, DOJ redacted identifying information regarding a third party source.  This \nparticular source is mentioned twice in the released documents and did not provide information \ndirectly to the FBI.  Id. ¶¶ 110-11.  The individual has a substantial privacy interest in not being \npublicly linked to the investigation and could face harassment, retaliation, threats or physical \nharm if revealed publicly in connection with a sensitive national security investigation.  Id.  And \nthe public interest in an individual mentioned in two footnotes is quite limited and would not \nincrease the public’s understanding of FBI operations or this investigation.  Id.  Accordingly, this \ninformation was properly redacted.  \nH. DOJ Properly Withheld in Full Certain Portions of the Carter Page Documents \nPursuant to Exemptions 1, 3, 7(A), and 7(E). \n \nDOJ withheld 186 pages in full from the Carter Page FISA packages.  Disclosure would \nreveal classified intelligence methods and law enforcement techniques.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 135-\n41.  There is no additional information that can be provided on the public record but the \njustification for withholding is similar to the justification for other redactions under these \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 53 of 64\nexemptions.  The classified ex parte, in camera submission provides additional information. \nI.  DOJ Released All Reasonably Segregable Information. \nUnder FOIA, “any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any \nperson requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt . . . .” 5 U.S.C. § \n552(b).  Accordingly, “non-exempt portions of a document must be disclosed unless they are \ninextricably intertwined with exempt portions.” Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. Dep’t of Air Force, 566 \nF.2d 242, 260 (D.C. Cir. 1977).  An agency has no obligation to segregate non-exempt material \nthat is so “inextricably intertwined” with exempt material that “the excision of exempt \ninformation would impose significant costs on the agency and produce an edited document with \nlittle informational value.”  Neufeld v. IRS, 646 F.2d 661, 666 (D.C. Cir. 1981), abrogated on \nother grounds by Church of Scientology of Calif. v. IRS, 792 F.2d 153 (D.C. Cir. 1986); see also \nNat’l Sec. Archive Fund, Inc. v. CIA, 402 F. Supp. 2d 211, 220–21 (D.D.C. 2005) (same).  A \ncourt “may rely on government affidavits that show with reasonable specificity why documents \nwithheld pursuant to a valid exemption cannot be further segregated . . . .”  Juarez, 518 F.3d at \n61 (internal citation omitted).  “Agencies are entitled to a presumption that they complied with \nthe obligation to disclose reasonably segregable material.” Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 494 \nF.3d 1106, 1117 (D.C. Cir. 2007). \nHere, DOJ has shown that it released all reasonably segregable material through the \ndeclaration of Mr. Hardy.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 134.  Mr. Hardy indicates that the agency conducted \na document-by-document and line-by-line review to ensure that all reasonably segregable, non-\nexempt information was released, taking into account the public disclosures related to this \nmatter.  Id.  See Johnson v. Exec. Office for U.S. Attorneys, 310 F.3d 771, 776-77 (D.C. Cir. \n2002) (holding that agency had demonstrated there was no reasonably segregable non-\ndeliberative material when it had submitted an affidavit by an agency official confirming that “a \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 54 of 64\nline-by-line review of each document withheld in full [had] determined that ‘no documents \ncontained releasable information which could be reasonably segregated from the nonreleasable \nportions.’”).  This segregability conclusion is borne out by the released documents: redactions \nhave been taken narrowly and only where specific information protected by exemptions is at \nissue. \nBecause the Hardy Declaration establishes that all reasonably segregable, non-exempt \ninformation has been released, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment. \nIII.  DOJ Properly Refused to Confirm or Deny the Existence of Other Responsive \nRecords. \n \nDOJ has refused to confirm or deny the existence of FISA applications and orders beyond \nthe four previously acknowledged Carter Page packages.  DOJ has established that this partial \nGlomar response is proper, pursuant to Exemptions 1, 3, 7(A) and 7(E).  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 142-\n46; Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 14-15. \nThe standards for these exemptions are outlined in Part II of this memorandum, and the \napplication of FOIA standards to refuse to confirm or deny the use of particular surveillance \ntechniques against particular individuals ought to be non-controversial.  The Government \nroutinely makes Glomar responses to similar requests for information about particular \nsurveillance subjects, see 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 13, 143 (confirming that with extremely limited \nexceptions, the FBI does not confirm or deny FISA surveillance of particular individuals or \nentities); Findlay Decl. ¶ 16 (same), and courts routinely uphold such responses.  See, e.g., \nMarrera v. DOJ, 622 F.

The Partial Glomar is Proper Pursuant to Exemption One Because the \nExistence or Non-Existence of Responsive Records is Properly Classified. \n \nThe Glomar response with respect to the existence or non-existence of other FISA \nsurveillance applications is proper under FOIA Exemption 1.  DOJ has logically and plausibly \nexplained why it cannot confirm or deny the existence of additional responsive records that \nwould identify other FISA targets, if any, without revealing information that is currently and \nproperly classified and exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 1.  First, the existence or \nnon-existence of additional responsive records “pertains to” one of the categories of information \nprotected by Executive Order 13526, namely, “intelligence sources and methods” and “foreign \nrelations and foreign activities of the United States.”  And the disclosure of either category \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 56 of 64\nwould cause harm to national security. \nThe existence or non-existence of responsive records pertains to intelligence sources and \nmethods because the request, on its face, seeks information about whether there has been \nadditional FISA surveillance, beyond that already acknowledged.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 152-55; \nFindlay Decl. ¶¶ 16-19.  Confirming or denying whether other responsive records exist “would \nbe tantamount to confirming whether or not the FBI has relied on a particular intelligence \nactivity or method targeted at particular individuals or organizations” and “reveal otherwise non-\npublic information regarding the nature of the FBI’s intelligence interests, priorities, activities \nand methods– information that is highly desired by hostile actors who seek to thwart the FBI’s \nintelligence-gathering mission.”  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 155; Findlay Decl. ¶ 17 (“To disclose the \nexistence or non-existence of responsive documents in NSD files would disclose whether or not \nparticular individuals or organizations were targets of FISC-authorized surveillance.”).   Such \nactivities and methods “are valuable only so long as they remain unknown and unsuspected” and \nthat disclosure would “seriously jeopardize[]” the use of such methods.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 153-\n54; Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 20-21.   Mr. Hardy further explains that hostile groups review officially \nreleased information like this; they have “the ability to gather information from myriad sources, \nanalyze it, and deduce means and methods from disparate details to defeat the U.S. \nGovernment’s collection efforts.”  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 154; Findlay Decl. ¶¶ 20-21.   Disclosure of \nthe withheld information “would pose at least a serious risk to national security.” 3rd Hardy Decl. \n¶ 155; Findlay Decl. ¶ 20.   \nFurther, the Hardy Declaration establishes that confirming the existence or non-existence \nof other responsive documents would reveal information about the United States Government’s \nforeign relations, the disclosure of which could cause damage to national security.  3rd Hardy \nDecl. ¶¶ 156-60.   Such disclosure could “weaken, or even sever, the relationship between the \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 57 of 64\nUnited States and its foreign partners (present and future), thus degrading the Government’s \nability to combat hostile threats abroad.”  Id. 9 \nAccordingly, the partial Glomar response was proper under Exemption One. \nB.  The FBI Established that the Partial Glomar is Proper Pursuant to \nExemption 3 and the National Security Act.  \n \nAs discussed in Part II, Exemption 3 and the National Security Act prohibit the disclosure \nof intelligence sources and methods.  For the reasons discussed above with regard to Exemption \n1, confirming the existence or non-existence of responsive records could divulge information \nabout the existence or nonexistence of intelligence sources and methods protected from \ndisclosure under the National Security Act.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 161-63.  No additional showing is \nnecessary under the National Security Act. \nC.  The FBI Established that the Partial Glomar is Proper Pursuant to \nExemption 7(A). \n \nHere, the Hardy Declaration justifies the FBI’s use of Exemption 7(A) to protect the \ncurrently undisclosed fact of the existence or non-existence of any investigative records that \nwould be responsive to Plaintiffs’ requests.  As an initial matter, FISA records are plainly \ncompiled for law enforcement purposes.  As the Hardy Declaration establishes, the “only \ncircumstance under which the FBI can request a FISA order is when the FBI is conducting an \nauthorized, predicated national security investigation within the scope of its law enforcement and \nforeign intelligence responsibilities.”  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 77.   Accordingly, FISA applications and \nFISC orders – when they exist – are records compiled for law enforcement purposes. \n                                                           \n9 The Government is not arguing that such disclosure of the existence or nonexistence of records \nwould reveal the existence of the Russia investigation.  The existence of the Russia investigation \nis officially acknowledged information.  Additional information about the harm to foreign \nrelations that would result from disclosure is available in the ex parte, in camera declaration. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 58 of 64\nAdditionally, the information requested purportedly relates to an ongoing investigation.  \nPlaintiffs’ request explicitly mentions the investigation into the Russian government’s efforts to \ninterfere in the 2016 presidential election.  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 14 (describing opening of \ninvestigation); 168 (describing ongoing investigation).  Any sort of investigation involving such \nFISA records would be the sort of active investigation protected by Exemption 7(A).  See, e.g., \nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. NIH, 745 F.3d 535, 541 (D.C. Cir. 2014) \n(Exemption 7’s threshold requirement satisfied in a Glomar response case because FOIA \nrequester did not dispute that “any responsive documents,” if they existed, “would constitute \nrecords or information compiled for law enforcement purposes . . .”). \nThe Hardy Declaration further describes the harm to an investigation that may result: \nConfirming or denying the existence or non-existence of \nresponsive records would reveal non-public information about the \nfocus, scope, and conduct of that investigation.  Specifically, it \nwould reveal whether or not specific investigative techniques have \nbeen used; when and to what extent they were used, if they were; \ntheir relative value or benefit if they were used; and the targets \nthey were used against, if any.  Prematurely disclosing nonpublic \ninformation about the Russia investigation could give targets and \nothers intent on interfering with the FBI’s investigative efforts the \ninformation necessary to:  take defensive actions to conceal \ncriminal activities; develop and implement countermeasures to \nelude detection; suppress, destroy, or fabricate evidence; and \nidentify potential witnesses or sources, exposing them to \nharassment, intimidation, coercion, and/or physical threats.  \nAccordingly, confirming or denying the existence or non-existence \nof responsive records, beyond the four Carter Page FISA \napplications . . . , could reasonably be expected to adversely affect \nthe pending investigation. \n \n3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 169.    \nAccordingly, a Glomar response is available under these circumstances to protect the \nintegrity of confidential law-enforcement investigations, and to therefore prevent harm \ncognizable by FOIA Exemption 7(A).  See, e.g., Cozen O’Connor v. Dep’t of Treasury, 570 F. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 59 of 64\nSupp. 2d 749, 788 (E.D. Pa. 2008); see also CREW, 746 F.3d at 1096 (“Exemption 7(A) reflects \nthe Congress’s recognition that ‘law enforcement agencies ha[ve] legitimate needs to keep \ncertain records confidential, lest the agencies be hindered in their investigations or placed at a \ndisadvantage when it [comes] time to present their case.’” (quoting Robbins Tire, 437 U.S. at \n224)).  For these reasons, the FBI’s Glomar response is justified by Exemption 7(A). \nD.  The FBI Established that the Partial Glomar Response is Proper Pursuant to \nExemption 7(E). \n \nAs discussed in Part II, Exemption 7(E) protects law enforcement techniques and \nprocedures, where disclosure risks circumvention of the law.  Here, the Third Hardy Declaration \nestablishes that disclosure of existence or non-existence of responsive records would reveal a law \nenforcement technique or procedure.  “How the FBI applies its investigative resources (or not) \nagainst a particular allegation, report of criminal activity, or perceived threat is itself a law \nenforcement technique or procedure that the FBI protects.”  3rd Hardy Decl. ¶ 171.  Such an \nacknowledgment of the existence or non-existence of responsive records “would reveal when \nand under what circumstances the FBI relies upon FISA-authorized techniques in an \ninvestigation,” and “provide pieces of information that adversaries could use to ascertain at what \npoint, and against whom we might use particular techniques.”  Id. ¶ 172.  “Armed with this \ninformation, adversaries could glean significant insight into the activities likely to attract – or not \nattract – the FBI’s law enforcement attention.  These individuals would then be able to alter their \nbehavior to avoid attention by law enforcement, making it more difficult for the FBI to be \nproactive in assessing threats and investigating crimes.”  Id.  Accordingly, the FBI properly \ninvoked Exemption 7(E) to refuse to confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records, \nbeyond the Carter Page documents discussed in detail above. \n \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 60 of 64\nIV.  The Withheld Information Has Not Been Officially Acknowledged. \n \nAs a general matter, under FOIA, “when an agency has officially acknowledged \notherwise exempt information through prior disclosure, the agency has waived its right to claim \nan exemption with respect to that information.”  ACLU v. CIA, 710 F.3d 422, 426 (D.C. Cir. \n2013).  This “official acknowledgement” principle applies to the Glomar context, so a requester \n“can overcome a Glomar response by showing that the agency has already disclosed the fact of \nthe existence (or non-existence) of responsive records, since that is the purportedly exempt \ninformation that a Glomar response is designed to protect.”  Id. at 427.  But the plaintiff “must \nbear the initial burden of pointing to specific information in the public domain that appears to \nduplicate that being withheld.”  Id. (quoting Wolf, 473 F.3d at 378).   \nThe D.C. Circuit has narrowly construed the “official acknowledgment” doctrine, \nhowever, and to bring such a challenge plaintiff must satisfy three stringent criteria, none of \nwhich are satisfied here.  “First, the information requested must be as specific as the information \npreviously released.”  Wolf, 473 F.3d at 378 (quoting Fitzgibbon, 911 F.2d at 765); James \nMadison Project v. DOJ, No. CV 17-1392 (ABJ), 2018 WL 4283562, at *6 (D.D.C. Sept. 7, \n2018).  “Prior disclosure of similar information does not suffice; instead, the specific information \nsought by the plaintiff must already be in the public domain by official disclosure.  This \ninsistence on exactitude [by the D.C. Circuit] recognizes ‘the Government’s vital interest in \ninformation relating to national security and foreign affairs.”  Id. (quoting Pub. Citizen v. Dep’t \nof State, 11 F.3d 198, 203 (D.C. Cir. 1993)); Competitive Enter. Inst., 78 F. Supp. 3d at 54 \n(“Plaintiffs in this case must therefore point to specific information in the public domain \nestablishing that the NSA has [the claimed information.]”).  The information already released \nmust also be of the same level of generality as the information sought—broadly crafted \ndisclosures, even on the same general topic, do not waive the Glomar response.  See, e.g., Afshar, \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 61 of 64\n702 F.2d at 1133 (previous disclosure that plaintiff had “‘created a problem’ in U.S.-Iranian \nrelations” was too general to justify releasing documents detailing the nature of that problem). \n“Second, the information requested must match the information previously disclosed.”  \nWolf, 473 F.3d at 378 (quoting Fitzgibbon, 911 F.2d at 765).  If there are “substantive \ndifferences” between the two, an official-acknowledgment claim must fail.  ACLU v. DOD, 628 \nF.3d at 621.  That is true even if the previous disclosures are on the same topic.  See, e.g., \nCompetitive Enter. Inst., 78 F. Supp. 3d at 57 (a Presidential statement that “the intelligence \ncommunity . . . is looking at phone numbers and durations of calls,” was not adequately \ncongruent with a request seeking the companies that had provided that data to U.S. intelligence \nagencies); Wolf, 473 F.3d at 379 (holding that CIA could not claim Glomar protection when it \nhad previously read excerpts from materials sought into the record during congressional \nhearing); James Madison Project v. DOJ, 2018 WL 4283562, at *8-*16 (various Presidential \nstatements failed to meet matching and specificity requirements). \n“Third, . . . the information requested must already have been made public through an \nofficial and documented disclosure.”  Id. at 378 (quoting Fitzgibbon, 911 F.2d at 765).  Key to \nthis element is that the source must be official; non-governmental releases, or anonymous leaks \nby government officials or former government officials do not qualify.  See, e.g., ACLU v. Dep’t \nof Defense, 628 F.3d at 621-22; Agility Public Warehousing Co.  K.S.C., 113 F. Supp. 3d at 330 \nn.8; Competitive Enter. Inst., 78 F. Supp. 3d at 55.  In other words, “mere public speculation, no \nmatter how widespread,” cannot undermine the agency’s Glomar prerogative.  Wolf, 473 F.3d at \n378.  And Congressional statements also cannot waive Executive Branch classification or other \nExemptions.  See Military Audit Project, 656 F.2d at 742-745; see also Moore v. CIA, 666 F.3d \n1330, 1333 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“[W]e do not deem ‘official’ a disclosure made by someone \nother than the agency from which the information is being sought.”). \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 62 of 64\nPlaintiffs cannot meet their burden of pointing to an official disclosure of the information \nthey seek.  The declarations establish that no authorized government official has disclosed the \nprecise information withheld and that the declarants carefully considered the known public \ninformation related to this issue.  See 3rd Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 23-27, 31-32, 134, 143; Findlay Decl. ¶ \n23.   \nThe Amended Complaint cites a number of public statements that Plaintiffs allege \nconstitute official acknowledgement of properly classified facts.  See Am. Compl. ¶ 11 (“The \ncomments of President Trump and Press Secretary Sean Spicer constitute prior official disclosure \nof the existence of surveillance orders issued by the FISC and that authorized collection of \ninformation that, at a minimum, incidentally implicated President Trump and/or his associates. \nThis lawsuit ultimately will seek to determine the circumstances in which specific \nsurveillance/collection orders were issued by the FISC.”).  But these cited public statements \nabout an investigation and alleged surveillance do not come close to meeting the standard for \nofficial acknowledgement of the information sought by Plaintiffs. \nPlaintiffs appear to rely on President Trump’s four-part post on Twitter on March 4, \n2017, discussed supra.  See https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump; see also Am. Compl. ¶ 7; 3rd \nHardy Decl. ¶ 26; Findlay Decl. ¶ 8.  As discussed above, DOJ – through the testimony of then-\nFBI Director James Comey – has confirmed that it has no records that support this statement.  \nHardy Decl. ¶ 26; Findlay Decl. ¶ 8 & Ex. E.10 \n                                                           \n10 In any event, this series of tweets contains a constellation of specific opinions and allegations \nregarding wiretapping, including that (1) his phones were tapped; (2) at Trump Tower; (3) in \nOctober just prior to the election; (4) by the Obama Administration; and (5) that such actions \nwere comparable to “Nixon/Watergate.”  Nowhere do these tweets mention FISA, the FISC, any \ntargets other than President Trump, or the involvement of DOJ or FBI.  Moreover, the statements \nare limited to a particular time, a particular target, and a particular place, in contrast to Plaintiffs’ \nFOIA request.  Thus, the statements do not match the information sought in this FOIA request.  \nThe follow-up statements to the media by the President or his Press Secretary as cited in the \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40   Filed 10/19/18   Page 63 of 64\nNeither the Complaint nor the request point to any statements that could constitute \nofficial acknowledgment, and the agency has carefully considered the known public information \non this issue.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs cannot establish official acknowledgment. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant the Government’s motion for summary \njudgment. \nDated:  October 19, 2018        Respectfully Submitted, \n \nCHAD A.

As discussed further below, the FBI's original Glomarresponse was\npiercedonly in a very limited fashion for those four acknowledged applications and resulting\norders. It remains in placeas to any otherresponsive applications and orders, with one other\nexception. Specifically, on March 20, 2017, then FBI DirectorJames B.

Sucha\nsearchwas not necessary here. In this case, a known universe ofresponsive records was\nrevealed through the release ofthe Nunes and SchiffMemos. Specifically, the memoranda\nrevealed the existence offour FISA applications submitted for surveillance on CarterPage,\nstartingin October2016 and continuingthroughthree renewals, with accompanying FISA\norders. FBI FOIApersonnel consulted with FBI personnel familiar with the Russia\ninvestigationto locate the four Page FISApackages. Throughthese efforts, the FBI was able to\nlocate each ofthe four packages. At the same time, the FBI also contactedDOJ'sNational\nSecurityDivision(\"NSD\"), which represents the Governmentbefore the FISC, to obtaincopies\nofall four applicationsthatNSD had submittedto the FISC and all accompanying orders on the\napplications. NSD providedthe FBI copies ofall four packages for processing. The FBI then\nconfirmedthatbetweenits records and the NSD records, it had complete copies ofeachofthe\nfour FISA packages on CarterPage thathad been revealed by the Nunes and SchiffMemos.\n(29) (U) Withregard to Item 2 ofplaintiffs' request, the FBI interpreted this to include\nthe four final applications actuallysubmitted to the FISC seeking authorizationfor surveillance\nofCarterPage, whichresulted inordersfrom the FISC authorizing surveillance. The FBI did not\ninterpretItem2to includeallversionsordraftsofthoseapplications,asplaintiffsdidnot\nspecificallyreference other versions or drafts.\n11\nSECRET//NQFORN\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 12 of 66\nSECRET//NOFORN\n(30) (tJ) WithregardtoItem3ofplaintiffs'request, aseparate searchwasnot\nrequired because the minimizationprocedures that DOJ proposedand that the FISC orderedwith\nregard to the Page surveillanceare included withinthe four applications and resulting FISC\norders.\n(U) FOIAExemptions\n(31) (U) The FBI carefullyreviewed, processed, releasedto plaintiff(and others), and\nposted to The Vault all non-exemptportions ofthe four Page FISApackages (applications and\norders) thatwere revealedintheNunes Memo.^° InconjunctionwithDOJ, theFBIconducted a\nthorough reviewofeach page and redacted informationor withheld pages in full pursuantto\nFOIAExemptions (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(6), (b)(7)(A), (b)(7)(C), (b)(7)(D), and (b)(7)(E).\n(32) (U) Every effortwas made to provide plaintiffwith allmaterial in thepublic\ndomain and with all reasonably segregable portions ofnon-exemptmaterial.

An intelligence activity, source, ormethodhas two\n17\nSECRET//MOFORM\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 18 of 66\nSECRET//NOFORN\ncharacteristics. First,the intelligence activity, source, ormethod, andinformation generatedby\nit, isneededby United States Intelligence/Counterintelligence agencies to carry outtheir\nmissions. Second,confidentiality must be maintained withrespect tothe use ornon-use ofthe\nactivity,source,ormethod,includingintelligencesources,ifthe viability,productivity,and\nusefulness ofthe activity, source, and method are to be preserved.\n(47) (U) Intelligence activities, sources, andmethods must beprotected from\ndisclosure inevery situation in which acertain intelligence capability, technique, orinterest- or\nits specificuse- isunknowntothe groupsagainstwhichit isdeployed,sincethosegroupscould\ntake countermeasures to nullify its effectiveness. Intelligence activities, sources, and methods\narevaluable onlyso long as they remainunknown and unsuspected. Once an intelligence\nactivity, source, or method- or the fact ofits use or non-use in a certainsituation- is discovered,\nits continuedsuccessful use is seriouslyjeopardized.\n(48) (U) Moreover, the U.S. Governmentmust domore thanpreventexplicit\nreferences to intelligence activities, sources, and methods; it mustalso preventindirect\nreferences to them. One vehicle for gathering informationaboutthe U.S. Government's\ncapabilities is by reviewing officially-releasedinformation. We knowthat terroristorganizations\nand otherhostile or ForeignIntelligence groups havethe capacity and abilityto gather\ninformationfrom myriad sources, analyze it, and deduce means and methods from disparate\ndetails to defeat the U.S. Government's collectionefforts. Thus, even seemingly innocuous,\nindirectreferences to an intelligence activity, source, or method couldhave significantadverse\neffects whenjuxtaposedwithotherpublicly-available data. •\n(U) Information Protected In This Case\n(49) (U) As discussed below, informationwithheld under Exemption (b)(1)in\n18\nSECRET//NOFORN\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 19 of 66\nSECRET//MOFORN\nconjunctionwith E.O. 13526 § 1.4(c)would, ifdisclosed, reveal otherwise non-public\ninformationregarding: the FBI's intelligence interests,priorities, activities, andmethods;\nundisclosed intelligence sources ormethods upon whichthe FBI relied in support ofits\napplication forFISA authorized surveillance ofCarter Page, aswell asundisclosed portions of\nintelligence informationprovided by Source#1; and information about the use and\nimplementationofvariousintelligencemethods,includingthespecificdetailsofthesurveillance\nofCarterPage authorized by the FISC viathe four applications and orders publiclyrevealed in\nthe HSPCI memoranda.

Using the fourth application\nand resulting orders as an example, this informationwas protectedon Bates pages 17-cv-\n597(FBI)-308-316.\n(58) (U)' Thedisclosure oftheabove-describedtypes ofinformationcould reasonably\nbe expectedto cause serious damage to the national security, as it would: (a) reveal actual\nintelligence activities undertakenbythe FBI, and the methods used in doing so, regarding\nspecific targets and during specific periods oftime; (b) disclosethe intelligence-gathering\ncapabilities ofthe methods; and (c) provide an assessmentofthe levelofpenetrationby the FBI\nofspecifictargets during the specific time period. Armedwith suchinformation, adversaries,\nincluding hostile foreign governments, could implementactions to thwartthe FBI's intelligence\nactivities and weaken or negate the particularintelligencemethods, whichwould severelydisrupt\nthe FBI's intelligence-gathering capabilities. Accordingly, this information is currently and\nproperly classifiedpursuant to E.G. 13526, § 1.4(c)atthe SECRET level, and the FBIproperly\nwithheld itimderExemption (b)(1).\n(59) (U) The FBI also concluded that the specific amounts ofpayments made to\n22\nSECRET//MOFORH\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 23 of 66\nSECRET//HOFORN\nintelligence sourcesreflected inthe records isclassified intelligence method information.\nWithout adequate context, the particularamountpaidto aparticularintelligence source could be\nviewedto suggestthe relativevoliime ofinformationprovided by aparticularsource, which\ncouldcause individuals who believethey are the subjects ofsuchsource reporting to assess the\nlikelihoodthattheir activities have cometo the FBI's attentionand thentake countermeasures,\ndestroy or fabricate evidence, or otherwise actin a way to thwartthe FBI's intelligence activities.\nMoreover, disclosure wouldrevealnon-public informationaboutthe level ofresources devoted\nto particulartargets or subjectmatters. The FBI has limited resources thatit must allocate\nstrategicallyin order to effectivelypursue its intelligence gathering mission. Revealingthe\namount ofmoneythe FBI has paidto particularintelligence sources and overparticularperiods\noftime wouldreveal the FBI's level offocus on certainintelligence gathering efforts. Revealing\nthis level offocus would reveal howthe FBI has allocated and is allocating its limitedresources.\nI\nIfaggregated over time, this informationwouldpaintahigh-level picture ofthe resources\ndevotedto particularthreat areas, and reveal wherethe FBI's strengths and weaknesses lie within\nthe spectrumofits intelligence-gathering activities. This would give sophisticatedadversaries\nand hostile governments the informationnecessaryto adjusttheir activities in accordance with\nthe FBI's perceivedpriorities, in orderto avoidthe FBI's strengthareas and exploitits weak\nones. Accordingly, the disclosure ofthis informationcould reasonably be expectedto cause\nserious damage to the national security, and is currentlyand properlyclassifiedpursuantto E.O.\n13526,§ 1.4(c)atthe SECRET level, and the FBI properly withheld it under Exemption (b)(1).\n(U) IntelligenceSources\n(60) (U) An intelligence sourcewhorequires continued classification is onethat\nprovided or is currentlyproviding information that pertainsto national securitymatters, the\n23\nSECRET//NOFORN\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 24 of 66\nSECRET//NOFORN\ndisclosure ofwhich could reasonablybe expected to result in serious damage to the FBI's\nintelligence-gatheringcapabilities.\n(61) (U) Although some information about Source#1 and his activities has been\ndeclassifiedandpubliclydisclosed,thefourPagePISAapplicationsincludeinformationabout\notherintelligencesources. This information,includingspecificinformationaboutthesources\nthemselves aswell asthe information theyprovided, is singular in nature and,ifdisclosed,\nreasonably could be expected to identify the contributing sources.\n(62) (U) Disclosure ofthe identities ofintelligence sources couldreasonably be\nexpectedtojeopardize their livelihoods, their families andotherrelationships, andeventheir\nlives. Moreover, disclosure ofone source can reasonablybe expectedto cause other currentand\npotential intelligence sources to fearthat their identities will bepublicly revealed atsome point.\nUsingthe fourth application and resulting orders as an example, this informationwas protected\non Bates pages 17-cv-597(FBI)-308-319.\n(63) (U) Thus, the release ofsource-identifyinginformationcanreasonably be\nexpectedto cause damage to the national security by causingcurrentintelligence sources to\ncease providing information, and discouragingpotentialintelligence sourcesfrom cooperating\nwiththe FBIfor fear theiridentities wouldbe publiclyrevealed at somepoint. Sucha source\nreactionwould eliminate one ofthe Intelligence Community's most crucial means ofcollecting\nintelligenceinformationand, therefore, severelyhamperthe FBI's intelligenceand investigative\nmissions. Accordingly, some ofthe protected intelligence source informationhere is currently\nand properlyclassifiedpursuantto E.G. 13526, § 1.4(c) atthe TOP SECRETlevel, for\nintelligence sourceinformation that could reasonably be expectedto cause exceptionally grave\ndamage to the national security, and some ofthe protected intelligence sourceinformationhere is\n24\nSECRET//NOFORN\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 25 of 66\nSECRET//NOFORN\ncurrently andproperly classified at the SECRETlevel, for intelligence source informationthat\ncould reasonablybe expectedto cause serious damage to the national security. The FBI properly\nwithheldthisinformationunderExemption (b)(l).^^\n(U) E,0.13526§ L4(d) - ForeignRelations orForeignActivities\n(64) (U) E.G. 13526 § 1.4(d) authorizes the classification ofinformation about\nforeign relations or foreign activities ofthe United States, includingconfidential sources. Such\ninformation includes information gatheredfrom/withthe assistance ofand/or aboutforeign\ncountries. It is sensitive due in partto the delicate nature ofinternational diplomacy, and must\nbe handled with care so as not tojeopardizethe fragile relationshipsthat existbetweenthe\nUnited States and certainforeign governments.\n(65) (U) The unauthorized disclosure ofinformationconcerningforeignrelations Or\nforeign activities ofthe United States can reasonablybe expectedto lead to diplomatic or\neconomic retaliation againstthe United States; the loss ofthe cooperationand assistance of\nfriendly nations; orthe compromiseofcooperative foreign sources, whichmayjeopardizetheir\nsafety and curtailthe flow ofinformationfrom these sources. Dueto the nature ofthe\ninformationhere,the FBI carmotprovide any more specific details onthe public recordabout its\nbasis for redacting informationpursuantto E.G. 13526, § 1.4(d) and Exemption (b)(1).\nHowever, as the FBI'sclassifiedportions ofthis declarationdemonstrate, this informationis\ncurrentlyand properly classified and was appropriatelyredactedby the FBI.\n(66) (S//NF)\n(U) TheintelligencesourceinformationprotectedintheFISCordersisclassifiedattheSECRETlevel\nonly.

The FBI is one ofthe member agencies comprisingtheIC, and as such must\nprotectintelligence sources and methods.\n(72) (U) Accordingly, the informationin the Page FISAapplications and resulting\nFISC ordersthat reveals intelligence sources and methods isprohibited from disclosurepursuant\nto 50U.S.C. §3024(i)(l) and thus exempt from disclosure under Exemption (b)(3).\n(73) (S//NF)\n27\nSECRET//NOFORN\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 28 of 66\nSECRET//NOFORN\n(U) Exemption (b)(7)- LawEnforcementInformation\n(U) Threshold\n(74) (U) ThefirststepinapplyinganyofExemption(b)(7)'ssubparts isto\ndemonstrate that the records or informationat issue were compiledfor law enforcement\npurposes. 5U.S.C. §552(b)(7).

Moreover, while unclear thatHSPCI's disclosures oftheNunes and SchiffMemos\nlegallyprecluded the FBI'sability to assert FOIA exemptions overmatching information inthe\nfourPage FISApackages processed here, the FBI nevertheless didnot redact any exactly\nmatching information. Furthermore, the FBI carefullyconsidered whetherto disclose similar\ninformationthatwas notan exactmatchto the memoranda, and asserted Exemption(b)(7)(A)\nonly upon concludingthat disclosure ofthe non-matching informationcould reasonably be\nexpected to harm the investigation.\n(91) (U) Forthe reasons discussed above, combined withthejustifications for\nprotecting information under the other exemptions discussed herein, the FBI concluded that\ndisclosure ofinformationmarked as \"(b)(7)(A)-1\" could reasonably be expectedto interfere with\nthe pendinginvestigation. Accordingly, the FBI withheld that informationpursuantto\nExemption(b)(7)(A).\n(U) Exemption (b)(7)(C) - UnwarrantedInvasionsofPersonalPrivacy\n(92) (U) Exemption(b)(7)(C) exempts from disclosure \"records or information\ncompiledfor law enforcementpurposes [when disclosure] could reasonably be expected to\nconstitute an unwarranted invasionofpersonal privacy.\" 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C).\n(93) (U) As previously noted in the sectionofthis declaration concerning Exemption\n(b)(6), the practiceofthe FBI is to conjunctivelyassertExemptions (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C) as they\nprovide overlappingprotections forpersonal privacy.

Each exemption\nbalances individuals' privacy interests againstthe public's interest in disclosure.\n(94) (U) Forpurposes ofboth exemptions, apublic interest exists onlywhen\ninformation would significantly increasethe public's understanding ofthe FBI's performance of\nits missionto protect anddefendthe United Statesagainst terrorist and foreign intelligence\nthreats;upholdandenforcethecriminallawsofthe UnitedStates;andprovideleadershipand\ncriminaljustice servicesto federal, state, municipal, andinternational agencies andpartners.\n(95) (U) The FBI has relied onExemptions (b)(6)and(b)(7)(C) here to protectthe\nnames ofor informationabout FBI SpecialAgents and FISC and NSD employees; information\nsufficientto identifyathird partywho was the source ofsome informationrelied upon in the\nfourPage FISA applications; andcertain personally-identifyingand othernon-public private\ninformationabout CarterPage.\n(U) (h)(6VmTi(C)-l FBISpecialAgents\n(96) (U) The FBI withheld the names ofthe FBI Special Agents who signedthe Page\nFISAapplications processed in responseto plaintiffs request.

DOJ OrderNo. 3915-2017, Appointment ofSpecial\nCounsel to Investigate Russian Interference with the 2016 Presidential Electionand Related\nMatters (May 17,2017)).\nB. (U) As plaintiffspecificallyrequested FISA/FISC records relatedto\nRussianinterferencein the 2016 election, the FBI cannot confirmor denythe existence or non-\nexistence ofresponsive records, beyond those already acknowledged and processed, because that\ncouldreasonablybe expectedto adversely affectthe pending investigation.\n(146) (U) Finally, acknowledging the existence or non-existence ofany other\nresponsive records couldreasonably be expected to risk circumventionofthe law. See 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(b)(7)(E).\n(U) FOIAExemption(b)(1)asa BasisforthePartialGlomarResponse\n(147) (U) FOIA Exemption (b)(1)protects records that are:\"(A) specifically authorized\nundercriteriaestablished by an Executive order to be kept secretin the interestofnational\n55\nSECRET//NOFORN\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 56 of 66\nSECRET//NOFQRN\ndefenseor foreignpolicy and (B)are infact properly classified pursuant to suchExecutive\norder.\" 5U.S.C. § 552(b)(1).\n(148) (U) E.0.13526 § 1.1(a)providesthatinformationmaybe originallyclassified\nimder the terms ofthis orderonly ifall ofthe following conditions are met: (1) an original\nclassification authorityis classifying the information; (2)the information isownedby, produced\nby or for, oris underthe control ofthe U.S. Government; (3)the information falls within oneor\nmore ofthe categories ofinformationlisted in § 1.4ofE.G. 13526; and (4) the original\nclassificationauthoritydetermines that the unauthorized disclosure ofthe informationreasonably\ncouldbe expectedto result in some level ofdamage to the national security, and the original\nclassificationauthority is able to identifyor describethe damage.\n(149) (U) E.G. 13526explicitly authorizes precisely the type ofresponsethat the FBI\nhas provided toplaintiffin this case. Specifically, §3.6(a) provides that \"[a]nagency mayrefuse\nto confirmor deny the existenceor nonexistence ofrequested records wheneverthe fact oftheir\nexistence or nonexistence is itselfclassified under this order or its predecessors.\"\n(150) (U) ConsistentwithE.G. 13526 and as described below, I have determinedthat\nacknowledgingthe existence or nonexistence ofthe records requested by plaintiff, beyond the\nfour Carter Page FISAapplications and orders discussed in detail above, wouldrequire the FBI\nto disclose properlyclassifiedfacts thatconcern § i.4(c) (\"intelligence activities, sources, and\nmethods\") and § 1.4(d) (\"foreign relations and foreign activities ofthe United States\").\nMoreover, responsive records, ifthey exist, wouldbe owned by and underthe control ofthe U.S.\nGovernment. Finally, I have determinedthat acknowledgingthe existence or non-existence of\ntherequestedrecordsreasonablycouldbeexpectedtoresultin damagetonationalsecurity.\n56\nSECRET//NOFORN\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 57 of 66\nSECRET//NOFORN\n(151) (U) My determinationthat theexistence or nonexistence ofthe requested records\nis classified has not been made to conceal violations oflaw, inefficiency, or administrative error;\nto prevent embarrassment to aperson, organization, oragency; to restrain competition; orto\nprevent or delaythe release ofinformation that does not requireprotection in the interests of\nnational security\n(U) IntelligenceActivities,Sources, andMethods\n(152) (U) The records requested byplaintiffs, ifthey exist, implicate classified\nintelligence activities and methods, andacknowledgingthe existence ornon-existence ofany\nsuch records reasonably can be expectedto cause damage to national security. An intelligence\nactivityor method includes anyintelligence action ortechnique utilized by the FBI against a\ntargetedindividual or organization that has beendetermined to be ofnational securityinterest,\nandincludes anyprocedure (humanor non-human) utilized to obtain information concerning\nsuch individual or organization. An intelligence activity or method has two characteristics.\nFirst, the intelligence activity or method, and informationgenerated by it, is needed by United\nStatesIntelligence/Counterintelligence agencies to carryouttheirmissions. Second,\nconfidentiality must be maintainedwithrespectto the use or non-use ofthe activity or method,\nincluding intelligence sources, ifthe viability, productivity, and usefulness ofthe activity,\nmethod, and source are to be preserved.\n(153) (U) Intelligence activities and methods mustbe protectedfrom disclosure in\nevery situationin which a certainintelligence capability, technique, or interest- or its specific\n^ (U) Totheextentpossibleonthepublicrecord, Ihaveexplainedtheharmtonational securitythat\nwould result from confirmingordenying the existence ornon-existenceresponsiverecords here.

Onevehiclefor\ngatheringinformation about the U.S. Government's capabilities is byreviewing officially-\nreleased information. We knowthat terroristorganizations and other hostile or Foreign\nIntelligence groupshave the capacity and abilityto gather information from myriad sources,\nanalyze it, and deduce means and methods from disparate details to defeat the U.S.\nGovernment's collectionefforts. Thus, even seeminglyinnocuous, indirectreferences to an\nintelligence activity, source, or method could have significant adverse effects whenjuxtaposed\nwith other publicly-availabledata.\n(155) (U) Here, acknowledgingthe existenceor non-existence ofrecords responsive to\nplaintiffs request, beyond the four Carter Page FISA applications and resulting FISC orders,and\nformer DirectorComey's March20, 2017 statementthat neitherthe FBI norDOJ have any\ninformationabout the alleged wiretapping referredto inPresidentTrump's March 4, 2017\ntweets, wouldbetantamounttoconfirmingwhetherornottheFBIhasreliedonaparticular\nintelligence activity or method targeted at particularindividuals or organizations. The FBI has\nnot confirmedor deniedthe existence ofany other FISA surveillance records responsiveto\nplaintiffs request. Confirming or denying whether any ornot other responsive records exist\nwould reveal otherwisenon-public information regarding the nature ofthe FBI's intelligence\n58\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 59 of 66\nSECRET//NOFORN\ninterests,priorities,activities,andmethods—informationthatis highlydesiredbyhostileactors\nwho seek to thwartthe FBI's intelligence-gatheringmission.

Underthe direction ofthe DNI, othercomponents withinthe\nU.S. Governmentare authorized to protectintelligencesources andmethods from unauthorized\ndisclosure.\n(163) (U) As previouslydescribed in relationto the Exemption (b)(1) Glomar\nexplanation, acknowledging the existence or non-existence ofrecords responsive toplaintiffs\nrequest, beyondthe four Carter Page EISA applications and orders discussed in detail above,\nwould tendtoreveal whether anintelligencemethod^^ isbeingdeployed against aparticular\n(U) AnintelligencemethodincludesanyintelligenceactionortechniqueutilizedbytheFBIagainsta\ntargetedindividual ororganizationdeterminedtobeofnationalsecurityinterest; anyprocedure(humanornon-\nhuman)orintelligencesource,usedtoobtaininformationconcerningtheindividual ororganization;andforeign\nliaisonrelationships.\n61\nSECRET//NOFORN\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 62 of 66\nSECRET//NOFORN\ntarget or organization, thus compromising the nationalsecurityinterests ofthe United States.\nAccordingly, the National SecurityAct, in conjunctionwith Exemption (b)(3), provides an\nadditional andindependent basis for the FBI's partial Glomarresponse to plaintiffs request.\n(U) FOIAExemptions(b)(7)(A)and (b)(7)(E)asBasesfortheGlomarResponse\n(U) Exemption (b)(7) Threshold\n(164) (U) As discussed above, before an agency can invoke any ofthe harms\nenumeratedin Exemption(b)(7), it must first demonstratethatthe records or informationat issue\nwere compiled for law enforcement purposes. Law enforcement agencies such astheFBI must\ndemonstrate thatthe records at issue arerelated to the enforcementoffederal laws and thatthe\nenforcementactivity is withinthe law enforcementduty ofthatagency.\n(165) (U) The only circumstance under whichthe FBI can request aFISAorder is\nwhenthe FBI is conducting an authorized, predicatednational securityinvestigation withinthe\nscope ofits law enforcementand foreign intelligence responsibilities.

The FBIsought and obtaineda FISA warrant in October 2016 to\nconductsurveillance ofCarterPage in the course ofthat investigation. The FBI thereafter sought\nand obtained three renewals from the FISC to continue surveilling Page. The FISA applications\nwere compiled aspart ofthe investigation into Russian election interference. In May 2017, the\nActingAttorney General appointed Special Counsel Mueller and authorizedhim to conductthe\nRussian electioninterference investigation confirmed by then-FBI Director James Comey on\nMarch20,2017. That investigationis on-going. Plaintiffs request specificallyseeks FISA\napplications and FISC orders related tothe Russian election interference investigation. Thus, the\nrequirement ofapendingenforcementproceeding in Exemption(b)(7)(A) is satisfied.\n(169) (U) The final element—interference with that investigation- isreadily\nestablished. Confirmingor denying the existence or non-existence ofresponsiverecords would\nreveal non-public informationaboutthe focus, scope, and conductofthat investigation.\nSpecifically, it wouldreveal whether or not specificinvestigative techniques have been used;\nwhen and to what extentthey were used, iftheywere; theirrelative value orbenefitiftheywere\nused; and the targets they were used against, ifany. Prematurelydisclosing non-public\ninformationaboutthe Russia investigationcould givetargets and others intent oninterfering\nwith the FBI's investigative efforts the informationnecessaryto: take defensive actions to\nconceal criminal activities; develop and implementcountermeasures to elude detection; suppress,\ndestroy, or fabricate evidence; and identifypotential witnesses or sources, exposingthemto\nharassment, intimidation, coercion, and/or physical threats. Accordingly, confirming or denying\nthe existence ornon-existence ofresponsive records, beyondthe four Carter Page FISA\napplicationsandordersdiscussedindetailabove,couldreasonablybeexpectedtoadversely\nm\n63\nSECRET//NOFORN\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 40-1   Filed 10/19/18   Page 64 of 66\nSECRET//NQFORN\naffectthependinginvestigation.

Even in\nacknowledged investigations, the FBI does not routinely disclose whether or not it has employed\nthis particular classifiedinvestigative technique against aparticular target.

See Mem. Op., ECF No. 62, at 6–7.  Plaintiffs now ask the court \nto reconsider that decision, asserting that they in fact challenged those withholdings and the court \nsimply did not reach their argument.  See Pls.’ Partial Mot. for Recons., ECF No. 64.  Having re-\nreviewed both rounds of the parties’ summary judgment briefs, the court agrees with Plaintiffs.   \nThey did contest the withholdings made to the 391 pages in their opposition to Defendant’s initial \nmotion for summary judgment.  See Pls.’ Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 42 \n[hereinafter Pls.’ Opp’n], at 10–14.  And, although Plaintiffs merely noted that challenge in a \nfootnote in response to Defendant’s renewed motion for summary judgment, see Pls.’ Opp’n to \nDef.’s Renewed Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 53, at 2 n.2—Plaintiffs would have done better to \nhighlight their argument in the text—the court nevertheless will consider the challenge preserved.  \nThe court therefore proceeds to the merits.   \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00597-APM   Document 67   Filed 05/04/20   Page 2 of 3\n  Plaintiffs argue that the court should reject Defendant’s withholdings from the 391 pages, \nbecause two tweets from the President “cast[] doubt on the good faith bases for the redactions and \nwithholdings made by the Government.”  See Pls.’ Opp’n at 12.  In the first, the President tweeted:  \n“Congratulations to @JudicialWatch and @TomFitton on being successful in getting the Carter \nPage FISA documents.  As usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little \ndoubt that the Department of ‘Justice’ and FBI misled the courts.  Witch Hunt Rigged, a Scam!”1  \nIn the second tweet, he stated:  “It was classified to cover up misconduct by the FBI and the Justice \nDepartment in misleading the Court by using this Dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to \ntarget the Trump Team.  This is a Clinton Campaign document.  It was a fraud and a hoax designed \nto target Trump....”2  Neither tweet causes the court to doubt the agency’s declarations in this case.   \nThe President’s tweets amount to little more than “[a] mere assertion of bad faith [that] is \nnot sufficient to overcome a motion for summary judgment.”  Baker & Hostetler LLP v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Commerce, 473 F.3d 312, 318 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting Assassination Archives & Research \nCtr. v. CIA, 177 F.Supp.2d 1, 8 (D.D.C. 2001)).  Although Plaintiffs tout that the tweets “come[] \nfrom the highest governmental authority,” Pls.’ Opp’n at 12, neither tweet reveals any personal \nknowledge on the part of the President with respect to the actual withholdings and the exemptions \ninvoked.  Cf. James Madison Project v. Dep’t of Justice, 302 F. Supp. 3d 12, 35 (D.D.C. 2018) \n(“But it does not follow that just because a tweet is an ‘official’ statement of the President that its \nsubstance is necessarily grounded in information contained in  government records.”).   The \nPresident’s statement that the disclosed records are “ridiculously heavily redacted” does not \nundermine the validity of the declarants’ invocation of Exemptions 1 and 3.  And his insistence \n                                                           \n1  Donald  J.

See Am. Civil Liberties Union v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 628 F.3d 612, 619 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011) (“Because courts lack the expertise necessary to second-guess such agency \nopinions in the typical national security FOIA case, we must accord substantial weight to an \nagency’s affidavit concerning the details of the classified status of [a] disputed record.” (cleaned \nup)).      \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration, ECF No. 64, is granted, \nand Defendant’s Motions for Summary Judgment, ECF Nos. 40, 52, are granted as to the remaining \n391 pages of the Carter Page FISA application.   \nThis is a final, appealable order.        \n \n \n                                                  \nDated:  May 4, 2020            Amit P.
