For more information on litigation to disclose the warrants that inspired this case, please see <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16844\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this link</a>. For a summary of the warrants and information on ongoing efforts by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to protect the confidential information in them, see <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17114\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this link</a>.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>The FISA requires the government to obtain a warrant from the FISC before it may conduct any domestic electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information. The warrant applications are made ex parte and must include a sworn statement by a federal officer of the facts and circumstances relied upon to justify the government's belief that the target of surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Once a FISC judge receives a warrant application, the judge can order approval of the surveillance only if the judge finds that there is probable cause to believe that the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Because the orders only authorize surveillance up to 90 days, the government must file an application for an extension that meets the same requirements as the initial warrant application and obtain a renewal order from the FISC for continued surveillance. For the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse collection of FISA matters, see our <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">special collection</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On August 7, 2018, Judicial Watch, a conservative-leaning nonprofit specializing in Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation to expose government mismanagement, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia under FOIA (5 U.S.C. &sect; 552) against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) seeking records surrounding surveillance of the 2016 Trump presidential campaign. In a separate case, the FISC released an opinion (<a href=\"../../../../detail.php?id=17114\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In re Carter W. Page: A U.S. Person [FISA dockets 16-1182, 17-52, 17-375, 17-679]</a>) flagging this case as one that could lead to lawful release of information in the Carter Page FISA warrants. The case was assigned to Judge Amy Berman Jackson.</p>\r\n<p>The complaint stated that the plaintiff initially submitted its FOIA request with the DOJ on May 29, 2018, and that as of the date of the complaint, the DOJ had not provided any responsive information to the request. The plaintiff sought information from three offices within the DOJ: the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the office of a particular former Associate Deputy Attorney General, and the Office of the Director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force. It was looking for any information these offices had pertaining to communications and background information on Fusion GPS, a commercial research and intelligence firm, and various sources publicly disclosed as the basis for the \"Steele Dossier,\" the primary document the DOJ used to pursue FISA surveillance of Trump 2016 campaign advisor Carter Page.</p>\r\n<p>After the complaint was filed, representatives from the plaintiff organization and the DOJ met to discuss a schedule for releasing relevant, non-exempt records under FOIA. In an October 19, 2018 status report, the parties agreed to produce documents on a six-month timeframe, with more updates to come as needed. As investigation commenced, more responsive documents were found that necessitated other searches, and this, combined with the government shutdown in late 2018 and the COVID-19 pandemic, delayed completion of this document request. As of the most recent status report, filed on December 11, 2020, the parties anticipate that the DOJ will be able to estimate a date for final document production in early 2021.</p>\r\n<p>The case and document production is still ongoing; Judicial Watch has not yet contested any of the DOJ's withholdings.</p>",

Additionally, the Executive Office for the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement \nTask Forces responded by letter dated July 16, 2018 in which it acknowledged receipt of \nPlaintiffโs FOIA request on June 7, 2018 and advised Plaintiff that the request had been assigned \nnumber FOIA-OCD2018-0029. \n9.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(6)(A)(i), the Defendant was required to determine \nwhether to comply with Plaintiffโs request within (20) working days after its receipt of the \nrequest and to notify Plaintiff immediately of its determination, the records thereof, and the right \nto appeal any adverse determination.  Defendantโs determination was due by July 20, 2018 with \nthe additional ten days.  5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(A)(viii)(II)(aa).     \n  10.  As of the date of this Complaint, Defendant has failed to: (i) produce the \nrequested records or demonstrate that the requested records are lawfully exempt from \nproduction; (ii) notify Plaintiff of the scope of any responsive records Defendant intends to \nproduce or withhold and the reasons for any withholdings; or (iii) inform Plaintiff that it may \nappeal any adequately specific, adverse determination. \nCOUNT I \n(Violation of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. ยง 552) \n \n  11.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 10 as if fully stated herein. \n- 3 - \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01854-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 08/07/18   Page 4 of 5\n  12.  Plaintiff is being irreparably harmed by Defendantโs violation of FOIA, and \nPlaintiff will continue to be irreparably harmed unless Defendant is compelled to comply with \nFOIA. \n13.  To trigger FOIAโs administrative exhaustion requirement, Defendant was \nrequired to determine whether to comply with Plaintiffโs request within the time limits set by \nFOIA.  Accordingly, Defendantโs determination was due on or about July 20, 2018.  By this \ndate, Defendant was obligated to: (i) gather and review the requested documents; (ii) determine \nand communicate to Plaintiff the scope of any responsive records Defendant intended to produce \nor withhold and the reasons for any withholdings; and (iii) inform Plaintiff that it may appeal any \nadequately specific, adverse determination.  See, e.g., Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in \nWashington v. Federal Election Commission, 711 F.3d 180, 188-89 (D.C. Cir. 2013). \n14.   Because Defendant failed to determine whether to comply with Plaintiffโs request \nwithin the time required by FOIA, Plaintiff is deemed to have exhausted its administrative appeal \nremedies.  5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(6)(C)(i).   \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court: (1) order Defendant to \nconduct a search for any and all records responsive to Plaintiffโs FOIA request and demonstrate \nthat it employed search methods reasonably likely to lead to the discovery of records responsive \nto Plaintiffโs FOIA request; (2) order Defendant to produce, by a date certain, any and all non-\nexempt records responsive to Plaintiffโs FOIA request and a Vaughn index of any responsive \nrecords withheld under claim of exemption; (3) enjoin Defendant from continuing to withhold \nany and all non-exempt records responsive to Plaintiffโs FOIA request; (4) grant Plaintiff an \naward of attorneysโ fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in this action pursuant to  \n- 4 - \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01854-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 08/07/18   Page 5 of 5\n5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(E); and (5) grant Plaintiff such other relief as the Court deems just and \nproper. \nDated:  August 7, 2018        Respectfully submitted,   \n              /s/ Ramona R.

OIP completed processing an additional 1,195 pages containing records \nresponsive to Plaintiffโs requests, and released 196 of those pages.   \n3.  Towards the end of OIPโs review process for the remaining potentially responsive \nclassified records it has collected to date in response to Plaintiffโs request (which currently stands \nat approximately 1600 pages of potentially responsive records), OIP discovered possible leads \nfor other potentially responsive documents that previously conducted searches may not have \ncaptured.  OIP will send all potentially responsive records out for consultation once these \nsupplemental searches are completed and the results have been processed by OIP.  OIP \nanticipates that it will be in a position to send records out for consultation on January 29, 2021.    \nIn light of these circumstances, the parties will submit a further joint status report on February \n10, 2021, at which point the parties anticipate they will be able to provide the Court with an \nestimated date for the completion of consultation and the release of the remaining records to \nPlaintiff. \n \n \nRespectfully submitted,  December 11, 2020 \n   \n/s/Ramona R.

At issue in this Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit is Plaintiff Judicial \nWatch, Inc.โs May 29, 2018 request for the following records.  This request seeks the following \nrecords from January 2016 to the present: \na.  All records from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General relating to \nFusion GPS, Nellie Ohr and/or British national Christopher Steele, \nincluding but not limted to all records of communications about and \nwith Fusion GPS officials, Nellie Ohr and Christopher Steele. \n \nb.  All records from the office of former Associate Deputy Attorney \nGeneral Bruce G.

Defendant determined that the records Plaintiff seeks are reasonably expected to \nbe within the Office of Information Policy (โOIPโ), the Criminal Division (โCRMโ), and the \nOrganized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (โOCDETFโ), all components of Defendant, the \nUnited States Department of Justice. \n3.  Plaintiff filed its complaint on August 7, 2018.  Defendant answered on \nSeptember 13, 2018.  The parties have met and conferred regarding a schedule by which each \nDefendant component will make its production of any non-exempt portions of responsive records \nsubject to the FOIA. \n4.  With respect to part (a), OIP has identified twelve custodians in the Office of the \nDeputy Attorney General (โDAGโ),1 including Mr. Ohr, who are reasonably likely to have \nrecords potentially responsive to Plaintiffโs request.  In light of OIPโs current backlog of FOIA \ncases, OIP estimates it will take at least six months to complete this search without displacing \nother equally meritorious FOIA requests received by OIP from other requesters.  Plaintiff \nrecognizes that Defendant will undertake other searches and document productions during this \ntime in response to parts (b) and (c) of Plaintiffโs FOIA request as set forth below and therefore, \nPlaintiff requests, and the parties agree, that Defendant will provide an update on the search in \nresponse part (a) of the request with the partiesโ next joint status report. \n5.  With respect to part (b) of Plaintiffโs request, Defendant states the request \noverlaps in part with a previous request that Plaintiff made to OIP.  OIP conducted a search in \n                                                 \n1 OIPโs Initial Request Staff is responsible for processing FOIA requests for records within OIP and \nfrom six senior leadership offices of the Department of Justice, specifically the Offices of the \nAttorney General (OAG), the Deputy Attorney General (ODAG), and the Associate Attorney \nGeneral (OASG), and the Offices of Legislative Affairs (OLA), Legal Policy (OLP), and Public \nAffairs (PAO). \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01854-ABJ   Document 8   Filed 10/19/18   Page 3 of 4\nresponse to that previous request and is now reviewing the results of that search to assess \nresponsiveness as to the present request.   CRM is also in the process of conducting a search in \nresponse to Part (b), and this search is ongoing.  Both OIP and CRM request an additional month \nto complete these tasks, after which time they will each propose a processing schedule as \nappropriate. \n6.  With respect to part (c), OCDETF has completed its search for potentially \nresponsive records, and is currently reviewing and seeking consultations on approximately 1,500 \npages of potentially responsive records.  OCDETF will make its initial response to Plaintiffโs \nrequest on December 1, 2018, with monthly rolling responses to follow, if necessary. \n7.  The parties submit that they will file a joint status report by December 7, 2018 to \nupdate the Court on the progress of the case and any recommendations for further proceedings, \nas appropriate.  \n \nRespectfully submitted,  October 19, 2018 \n   \n/s/Ramona R.
