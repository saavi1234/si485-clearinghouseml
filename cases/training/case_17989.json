    "summary": "<p>After eleven years of litigation and five failed consent decrees, Camden County, New Jersey corrections officials agreed to pay $160,000 to settle a federal civil rights suit that alleged severe overcrowding, sanitation, poor nutrition, and environmental violations of prisoners&rsquo; rights.</p>\r\n<p>On January 6, 2005, plaintiffs filed pro se action alleging that severe overcrowding at the Camden County Correctional Facility (&ldquo;CCCF&rdquo;) had caused serious deprivations of their health and safety in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. 2005 WL 6022128. CCCF housed inmates awaiting trial or sentenced to less than one year in prison. The complaint sought court-ordered improvements for the CCCF, rather than monetary awards for all inmates.</p>\r\n<p>Magistrate Judge Rosen appointed pro bono counsel for the plaintiffs, and plaintiffs subsequently filed an amended complaint.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that CCCF was constructed in 1988 and designed to house 1,267 prisoners. By March 2004, the population exceeded 1,800 prisoners and at other points, exceeded 2,000 prisoners, which resulted in an extremely overpopulated and understaffed facility that created an unsafe, unhealthy, and unsanitary environment for people incarcerated therein. 2005 WL 6022128.</p>\r\n<p>On July 31, 2007, the court granted the defendants' motion for class certification, certifying a class of all individuals incarcerated at CCCF from the inception of the lawsuit to January 6, 2005, including pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners. 2005 WL 6022128.</p>\r\n<p>In January 2009, the parties entered into a consent decree (&ldquo;First Consent Decree&rdquo;) which authorized the retention of a criminal justice planning firm, that provided a number of recommendations to improve the conditions at CCCF. Chief among those conditions was the creation by the County of a &ldquo;Jail Population Manager&rdquo; who would be responsible for monitoring, coordinating, and ensuring the efficient processing of the jail population and would serve as a liaison to the Superior Court of New Jersey, the municipal courts, the prosecutor, the defense bar, and other community corrections programs. 2005 WL 6022128.</p>\r\n<p>In August 2009, the parties entered into another consent decree (&ldquo;Second Consent Decree&rdquo;) which the court approved. The Second Consent Decree authorized the implementation of many of the criminal justice planning firm&rsquo;s recommendations. In April 2011, the parties entered into another consent decree (&ldquo;Third Consent Decree&rdquo;). At that time, a full-time jail population manager was hired. The court awarded attorneys' fees on October 5, 2009. 2005 WL 6022128.</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, on June 30, 2017, U.S. District Court Judge Jerome Simandle approved a final consent decree. This decree established a system in which population levels at the CCCF would be maintained at lower levels, more efficient jail-management practices would be implemented, and conditions of confinement would be substantially improved.</p>\r\n<p>Under the terms of the consent decree, in addition to improvements at CCCF, attorneys representing the prisoners received $155,000 in legal fees, two of the four named plaintiffs were each paid $1,500 and the other two were paid $1,000 each. The case was closed, but the court retained jurisdiction to enforce the decree for two years from the date of approval.</p>\r\n<p>The case was reassigned to Judge Karen M. Williams on September 20, 2022 to deal with an issue related to disbursement of the settlement funds. As of March 26, 2025, there has been no further action and the case remains closed.</p>",

The  current  Class \nRepresentatives are four former inmates of CCCF (referred to in this Notice as โthe \nPlaintiffsโ). The certified class is defined as: All individuals incarcerated at the \nCamden County Correctional Facility, either as pretrial detainees or as convicted \nprisoners,  from  the  inception  of  this  lawsuit  on  January  6,  2005  until  its \ntermination. \nThe original complaint in this matter was filed on January 6, 2005. By Order dated \nNovember 5, 2006, the Honorable Magistrate Judge Joel Rosen appointed the law \nfirm of Trujillo Rodriguez & Richards, LLC1 as pro bono counsel. On March 31, \n2006,  Plaintiffs,  through  their  new  counsel,  filed  an  Amended  Class  Action \nComplaint against CCCF, Camden County Department of Corrections, Camden \nCounty, Warden Eric Taylor, former Deputy Warden Frank Loberto and Joseph \nRipa. In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that the policies and practices \nof Defendants have created unconstitutional conditions that both pretrial detainees \nand convicted prisoners are forced to endure while incarcerated at CCCF. These \nincluded overcrowded cells, inadequate sleeping arrangements, and unsanitary meal \nservice. Defendants filed an Answer to Plaintiffsโ Amended Complaint on April 19, \n2006. \nBy Order entered July 31, 2007 the United States District Court for the District of \nNew Jersey certified this case as a Class Action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2). The \nCourtโs Order states that the Class shall consist of: \nAll individuals incarcerated at  the  Camden  County \nCorrectional Facility, either as pretrial detainees or as \nconvicted prisoners, from the inception of the lawsuit \non January 6, 2005 until its termination. \nThe class action was not certified for individual damage claims.  Plaintiffs have \nonly  sought  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief.    This  includes:  (i)  a  court  order \nfinding  and  declaring  the  CCCF  conditions  violated  the  plaintiffsโ  constitution \nrights (declaratory relief); (ii) a court order enjoining the defendants from engaging \n1 In July 2013, Lisa J. Rodriguez of Trujillo Rodriguez & Richards joined \nSchnader Harrison Segal & Lewis, LLP and continues to represent the certified \nclass. \nPHDATA 5869026_2\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 211   Filed 02/22/17   Page 21 of 24 PageID: 3713\nin actions which violated constitution rights (injunctive relief); and (iii) ordering \ninjunctive relief in the form of measures to address the overcrowding. \nFollowing  discovery,  the  parties  engaged  in  protracted  settlement \nnegotiations with the assistance of several experts, including Pulitzer Bogard & \nAssociates, Luminosity, Inc., and Urban Engineers. The parties also engaged the \nvoluntary participation of the Jail Population Reduction Subcommittee, comprised \nof  representatives  from  various  divisions  within  the  criminal  justice  system \nincluding the Courts, the Public Defenderโs Office, the Prosecutorโs Office, the \nSheriffโs Department, the Jail, and others. Through the combined efforts of the \nparties and the Jail Population Reduction Subcommittee, policies and practices \nhave been implemented that effectively reduced the population. The population is \nnow managed and actively monitored. For a more detailed understanding of the \nvarious measures put into place through this settlement, please review the Second \nand Third Consent Decrees entered in this litigation, copies of which are attached. \nCopies are also available on the Camden County website at www.         Through \nthis settlement, the Defendants have also remediated the air quality in the inmate \ncells. Defendants have denied the allegations of the Plaintiffsโ Complaint and this \nSettlement does not constitute any admission by the Defendants. \nWHY IS THERE A SETTLEMENT? \nAny effective, long term solution to the overcrowded conditions at CCCF required \nthe participation of not only the Defendants in this case, but also the participation \nof various stakeholders within the Camden County criminal justice system, such as \nthe courts, the prosecutorโs office, the public defender and the police. As a result of \ntheir  participation,  through  a  settlement,  the  parties  were  able  to  implement \ncreative solutions, including the creation of a Pretrial Services Program, designed \nto address the long term management of the Jailโs population. When the litigation \nwas initiated the jail population was at 1,823, well above the rated capacity of \n1,267.  Since  the  implementation  of  the  new  programs  and  the  hiring  of  a \npermanent  Jail  Population  Manager,  the  population  numbers  have  been \nconsistently below the rated capacity of CCCF. \nWHAT ARE THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT \nThe  Final  Consent  Decree  entered  into  by  the  parties  includes  the  following \ninjunctive relief: \nPHDATA 5869026_2\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 211   Filed 02/22/17   Page 22 of 24 PageID: 3714\n1. The hiring of a Jail Population Manager to monitor, coordinate and \nefficiently process inmates at the CCCF; \n2. The formation of a jail population reduction sub-committee comprised \nof members of many different entities, including the Camden County \nVicinage  of  the  Superior  Court,  the  Camden  County  Prosecutorโs \noffice, the Camden County Public Defenderโs office, and the Jail.  The \ncommittee  is  charged  with  monitoring  the  jail  population  and \nidentifying additional opportunities to reduce unnecessary detention; \n3. The creation of a Camden County Pretrial Services Agency; \n4. Increasing  in  the  number  of  inmates  released  on  home  electronic \ndevices; \n5. The creation of additional attorney visitation rooms to provide defense \ncounsel with better access to incarcerated clients; \n6. The  implementation  of  a  new  policy  to  track  inmate  bookings  to \nreflect the date and time an inmate was taken into custody; \n7. The implementation of proposals to address the issues of elevated CO\n2\nlevels at the CCCF. \nThis list is not exhaustive.  A detailed description of the measures put in place \nthrough this settlement is contained in the Second and Third Consent Decrees. \nCAN I GET OUT OF THE SETTLEMENT? \nYOU MAY NOT WITHDRAW OR OPT OUT OF THIS LITIGATION. You do \nnot have the right to exclude yourself from this settlement. The litigation was \ncertified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2), meaning that the remedy \nPlaintiffsโ sought in this litigation was for declaratory and injunctive relief, rather \nthan a monetary award. As a class member in this type of case, you do not have the \nright to opt out of this settlement. \nAs a Class Member, you are represented by the Class Representatives and their \nCounsel, unless you enter an appearance through privately retained Counsel of \nyour own choice (at your own expense). Counsel for the Class is Lisa J. Rodriguez \nof the law firm Schnader Harrison Segal & Lewis, LLP. \nPHDATA 5869026_2\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 211   Filed 02/22/17   Page 23 of 24 PageID: 3715\nAs a class member, you are not required to pay the attorneysโ fees of the litigation \nprovided that you continue to be represented by Plaintiffsโ Counsel. Plaintiffsโ \nCounsel  will  seek  court  approval  for  an  award  of  attorneysโ  fees  and \nreimbursement of litigation expenses. \nBecause  this  class  action  seeks  only  class-based  injunctive  relief  against \nthese defendants, nothing in this case precludes you individually from filing your \nown  separate  claim  for  monetary  relief  for  injury  arising  from  allegedly \nunconstitutional conditions of confinement at CCCF, since such individual claims \nare not part of this case. Any such individual claim for money damages, of course, \nmust comply with all applicable laws and procedures for an individual case, and it \nwill not be part of this class action.\nEFFECT ON OTHER LITIGATION \nThis  Settlement  does  not  foreclose  any  individual  member  of  the  class  from \nbringing  an  action  for  money  damages  relating  to  any  injuries  suffered  by \nthat  individual.  The  Settlement  does  preclude  members  of  the  class  from \ninitiating lawsuits concerning the issues identified and addressed in the Consent \nDecrees. Issues not identified and addressed in the Final Consent Decree may be \nthe subject of other class actions. \nIf you have already filed your own lawsuit seeking damages for your confinement \nat  CCCF,  you  will  be  barred  from  seeking  declaratory  or  injunctive  relief \nfor conditions  and  confinement  at  CCCF  from  January  6,  2005  to  the  date \nthis settlement is finally approved. \nFAIRNESS HEARING \nThe Court will hold a hearing to decide whether to approve the Final Settlement as \nfair,  reasonable  and  adequate  (the  โFairness  Hearingโ).  All  timely \nwritten objections  will  be  considered  by  the  Judge.  Only  class  members \nwho  have submitted written objections before the deadline may ask to speak at \nthe  Fairness  Hearing, but  you  do  not have  to  attend.

See generally \nPACER Docket Entry No. 1.  The Complaint alleged, among other things, that these inmates \nwere forced to live in overcrowded conditions at the Jail, which included up to four individuals \nliving in a cell designed for a single inmate.  See id. \nWHEREAS, on November 4, 2005, the Court granted Plaintiff Corri Dittimus-Bey's \nMotion for the appointment of counsel under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915(e).  See PACER Docket Entry \nNo. 35.  In this same Order, the Court appointed Lisa Rodriguez of Trujillo, Rodriguez and \nRichards, LLC to represent Plaintiffs.  See id. \nWHEREAS, on March 31, 2006, Plaintiffs, through their newly appointed counsel, filed \nan Amended Class Action Complaint (\"Amended Complaint\") against Defendants.  See PACER \nDocket Entry No. 60.  In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that the policies and \npractices of Defendants have created unconstitutional conditions that both pretrial detainees and \nconvicted prisoners are forced to endure while incarcerated at the Jail.  See generally id. at ~,-r 13-\n35.  These include, inter alia, overcrowded cells, inadequate sleeping arrangements. insufficient \nmedical and dental care, unsanitary meal service. understaffed maintenance personnel, and \ninadequate laundry service and cleaning supplies.  !d.  Plaintiffs sought both declaratory and \ninjunctive relief.  !d. \nWHEREAS, by Order dated July 31, 2007, this Court certified a class pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b )(2), consisting of: \n-2-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 90   Filed 01/22/08   Page 5 of 8 PageID: 777\nall individuals incarcerated at [the Jail], either as pretrial detainees or as convicted \nprisoners, from the inception of this lawsuit on January 6, 2005 until its \ntermination. \nSee PACER Docket Entry No. 80; and \nWHEREAS, the Jail is grossly overpopulated with a current population that far exceeds \nits current rated capacity of 1267, resulting in the triple and quadruple bunking of cells; and \nWHEREAS, the parties recognize that the Jail can not, by statute, refuse admission to any \ninmate regardless of the Jail's current population levels; and \nWHEREAS, the parties recognize that the Jail does not operate in a vacuum and any \nlong-term, effective remedy to the overcrowding population must involve the criminal justice \nsystem as a whole; \nWHEREAS, Plaintiffs' overcrowding expert, Steve Martin, opined in his June 29, 2007 \nreport: \nIt cannot he overemphasized that the conditions of confinement that currently \nexist at [the Jail] are a manifestation of larger more systemic problems related to \nthe county criminal justice system.  While there certainly may be short term \nstrategies that provide some reduction of the overcrowding, such as temporary or \nfast-track housing in combination with maximizing/expanding existing diversion \nand release mechanisms, the magnitude of such systemic problems that face \ncounty officials will require a total systems approach from profession criminal \njustice planners for long term solutions. \nSee Exhibit B, p. 16, attached to the Declaration of Nicole M. Acchione (\"Acchione Cert.''), filed \nherewith.  Mr. Martin rendered a Supplemental Report dated September 28, 2007 in which he \nspecifically recommended the retention of a criminal justice planner.  See Exhibit C to the \nAcchione Cert. \nWHEREAS. subject to the approval of the Court, the parties wish to effect an interim \ncompromise in the form of an Interim Consent Decree, providing for the retention of two \ncriminal justice planning firms. described in greater detail below; \n-3-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 90   Filed 01/22/08   Page 6 of 8 PageID: 778\nWHEREAS, Class Counsel represent that they have conducted a thorough study and \ninvestigation of the law and the facts relating to the claims asserted, and have consulted \nextensively with their overcrowding expert, and have concluded, taking into account the \nsubstantial benefits that the Class members, and future imnates of the Jail, will receive as a result \nof the terms of the Interim Consent Decree, and \nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED by and between \nthe undersigned that the parties have agreed to the following interim reliet: subject to the \napproval of the Court pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, upon and subject to the \nfollowing terms and conditions: \nI.

The study will focus on determining what improvements or changes in \ncriminal process and what changes or expansions in criminal offender diversion programs may \nbe feasible to implement in order to reduce the demand for secure adult pretrial detention and/or \nthe use ofthe County Jail as a sanction for convicted offenders.  For a more detailed explanation, \nsee Exhibit D to Acchione Cert. filed herewith. \n4.  Pulitzer Bogard & Associates, LLC has been retained for the purpose of \ndetermining capacity and staffing needs at the Jail.

Under applicable \nfederal and state Jaw, the County is liable for the conduct of its governmental subdivisions, \nincluding, inter alia, the CCCF and the Department of Corrections. \n10.  Defendant Eric Taylor (\"Taylor\") is an individual residing in or around Camden \nCounty, New Jersey.  During the time period relevant to this lawsuit, Taylor served as Warden of \nCan1den County Correctional Facility and head of the Camden County Department of \nCorrections and, in fact, actually exercised such functions and performed such duties. \n11.  Defendant Frank Loberto (\"Loberto\") is an individual residing in or around \nCamden County, New .Jersey.  During the time period relevant to this lawsuit, Loberto served as \nDeputy Warden of Camden County Correctional Facility and, in fact, actually exercised such \nfunctions and perfom1ed such duties. \n12.  Defendant Joseph Ripa (\"Ripa\") is a Camden County Freeholder and resident of \nCamden County, New Jersey.  During the time period relevant to this lawsuit, Ripa served as the \ncounty freeholder liaison to the Camden County Department of Corrections and, in fact, actually \nexercised such functions and performed such duties. \n3 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 60   Filed 03/31/06   Page 4 of 21 PageID: 251\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nThe Defendants' Custom, Policy, and Practice \nof Deliberate Indifference to Inmate Safety and Health Conditions \n13.  CCCF is located in the city of Camden and was first occupied by inmates in \nFebruary 1988. \n14.  CCCF was initially built to house 499 single bed cells, but by 1993 was double \nbunking cells, allowing the inmate population to reach 900. \n15.  In order to address the growing population at CCCF, prefabricated brick housing \nunits were constructed which increased the facility's capacity to 1,267 beds.  However, this \nalteration has done little to amend the extreme overcrowded environment that currently exists at \nCCCF ..  The nnmber of inmates incarcerated at CCCF has continued to grow in the subsequent \nyears, reaching a previously unseen high of 1,823 inmates in March of 2004 ..  This has led to \ntriple and quadruple bunking cells in sections of CCCF.  The result is an extremely \noverpopulated facility that is exceptionally understaffed creating an unsafe, unhealthy, and \nunsanitary environment for the inmates incarcerated at CCCF. \n16.  The policy, practice, and custom of inadequately housing inmates and \nunderstaffing CCCF was implemented and/or knowingly tolerated by high-ranking County and \nCCCF officials. \n17.  During the relevant time period, County and CCCF officials were aware that the \nCCCF was severely overcrowded and understaffed. \n18.  In or about March 2004, the National Institute of Corrections issued a report titled \n\"Local System Assessment (LSA) for Camden County NJ Correctional Facility,\" (\"NIC Report\") \nwhich took note of the \"extreme\" crowding at the CCCF, stating that the \"[c  ]urrent population \nlevels exceed the rated capacity by 140% .. \"  (NIC Report at 7). \n4 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 60   Filed 03/31/06   Page 5 of 21 PageID: 252\n19.  The NIC Report also noted that the CCCF did not employ sufficient staff to \nsupport the overcrowded population that resided at the facility.  (NIC Report at 9) (\"Overall \nstaffing appears short for the amount of work that is needed.'}  The NIC Report took special \nnote of the understaffing in the kitchen and other ancillary services, stating that they \"have \nsimply been overwhelmed by the sheer number of inmates.\"  (!d.)  \"For instance, the kitchen was \ndesigned to produce meals for 499 inmates.  In a standard year that equates to 546,405 meals ... \nThis year at current levels 1900 meals will be produced each meal for a yearly total of 2,086,200 \nmeals.  The kitchen was never designed to produce this number of meals.\"  (I d.)  This \nquadrupling of meals, the report concluded, \"has completely overwhelmed the production \ncapability of [CCCF's] kitchen.\"  (Id. at 14). \n20.  The NIC Report also found that \"[t]he crowding of this jail facility may be the \nsi11gle most importa11t issue facing Camden County\" and CCCF \"as a whole is suffering from \nthe effects of the crowding.\"  (NIC Report at 14) (emphasis added).  Thus, the report concluded: \n[Can1den County] is a relatively affluent county that can afford to \ninvest money to save money and alleviatejail crowding.  There are \ninformed jail administrators capable of resolving problems.  There \nis  a  sophisticated  justice  system  comprised  of the  court,  the \nprosecutor  and  the  public  defense.  There  is  a  knowledgeable \ncow1ty  government  and  finally,  Camden  County  is  a  caring \ncommunity. \n(Id. at 30). \n21.  Despite these independent findings, many of the conditions observed by the NIC \npersist today and have resulted, in part, to the nwnerous violations of Plaintiffs' rights w1der the \nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Eighth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution. \n22.  Despite the findings of the NIC Report, the County continues to implement and \n5 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 60   Filed 03/31/06   Page 6 of 21 PageID: 253\ntolerate a custom, policy, and practice of failing to adequately house inmates of CCCF, as well as \nprovide sufficient staff to support the overgrown population incarcerated at the facility. \n2.3.  In addition to the NIC Report, the County also conm1issioned a report titled \n\"Individuals with Mental Illness in the Camden County Criminal Justice System:  An Analysis of \nthe Implications of a Tragedy and Recommendations for Cross Systems Improvements\" \n(\"Mental Illness Report\").  While the report specifically addressed circumstances surrounding \nthe beating death of Joel Seidel while he was incarcerated at CCCF in January 2004, it also noted \nthat CCCF \"was severelv overcrowded and inmate population exceeded the rated capacity of \n1,267 irunates by approximately 500 (39%) on any given day.\"  (Mental Illness Report at 7) \n(emphasis added). \n24.  The above-described customs, policies and practices create a substantial and \numeasonable risk that inmates within CCCF will either be injured during their incarceration or \nforced to endure unsafe and unsanitary conditions. \n25..  During all relevant times, County and Prison officials knew of the excessive risk \nto inmate safety witl1in CCCF, and, furthermore, the excessive risk to inmate safety was so \nobvious that it was commonly known both within and outside County goverrm1ent  Indeed, \nfollowing the murder of Joel Seidel, countless newspaper articles and numerous independent \nstudies articulated the overcrowded envirorunent \n26.  During the relevant time period, County ar1d CCCF officials, acting with \ndeliberate indifference to the dangerous conditions within CCCF, knowingly disregarded the \nexcessive risks to inmate safety within CCCF.  During the relevar1t time-period, these Cour1ty \nand CCCF officials failed to take reasonable steps to reduce the im11ate population at CCCF in \norder to remedy the dangerous environment  Acting with deliberate indifference to the \n6 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 60   Filed 03/31/06   Page 7 of 21 PageID: 254\ndangerous conditions within CCCF, County and CCCF officials continued to ignore obvious \nunsanitary, unhealthy and unsafe conditions within CCCF, and continued to profoundly \nunderstaff the facility, \nFacts Directly Pertaining to Plaintiffs \n27.  As a direct result of the severe overcrowding and understaffing noted supra, \nPlaintiffs have been forced to live in an enviromnent that is unhealthy, unsafe, and unsanitary. \n28.  The environment at CCCF has resulted in a number of violations of Plaintiffs' \nright to safe and healthy prison conditions w1der the Eighth Amendment and the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment \n29.  Examples of the unhealthy, unsafe, and unsanitary enviromnent that has resulted \nfrom the overcrowded and understaffed conditions at CCCF, include, inter alia; \nInadequate Sleeping Arrangements: \n(a)  Due to severe overcrowding, cells designed for one or two inmates \nroutinely and regularly sleep three to four imnates at a time. \n(b)  Tlris arrangement forces one or two of the imnates in a cell to sleep on \nextremely tlrin mattresses, on the floor near the cell's toilet \n(c)  Plaintiffs Dittimus Bey, Clark, Elliott, and Rudd have each been forced \nshare a cell with two or three other imnates, for lengthy periods of time, \nduring their incarceration at CCCF and have all been forced to sleep on \nthe floor next to the toilet \n(d)  Imnates in protective custody cells, such as Plaintiffs Clark, Elliott, and \nRudd are locked in their cell for up to 24 hours at a time with up to as \nmany as three other cellmates and are not provided with adequate \n7 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 60   Filed 03/31/06   Page 8 of 21 PageID: 255\nrecreation time. \nInadequate Plumbing System: \n(a)  Disruption in CCCF's plumbing system frequently results in clogged and \noverflowing toilets that spill over onto tl1e floor space where inmates are \nforced to sleep due to an insufficient number of bunks. \n(b)  W11en toilets overflow, inmates, including Plaintiffs Clark, Elliott and \nRudd, are not given adequate cleaning supplies to clean tl1e floor, often \nbeing provided with no more than a dan1p mop without bleach or other \ndisinfectant \n(c)  During one week in January 2005, tl1ere was no running water in the \nindividual cells or showers forcing Plaintiffs Rudd and Clark to defecate \nin plastic trash bags at the instruction of CCCF persolll1eL \n(d)  On another occasion, Rudd was unable to get cold water in his cell for \nmonths at a time. \n(e)  In addition, the water provided in the individual cells of Plaintiffs Clark, \nElliott and Rudd for drinking and cleaning is often a brownish color. \nInadequate Cleaning Materials: \n(a)  Inmates are often not provided proper cleaning materials for individual \ncells and conm1on areas such as showers. \n(b)  Sometimes i1TI11ates, such as Plaintiffs Rudd, are forced to clean their cell \nwith water that has already been used to clean 12 other cells. \n(c)  Other times inmates such as Plaintiff Clark were not given a broom or \nscrub brush to clean their cells with and were forced to use their hands or \n8 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 60   Filed 03/31/06   Page 9 of 21 PageID: 256\ntheir personal shower toweL \n(d)  In addition, inmates such as Plaintiff Clark and Rudd have been instructed \nby CCCF persmmel to simply paint over mold, mildew and dirt rather than \nclean it first \n(e)  This, and other, unsanitruy conditions has resulted in severe boil and \nscabies outbreaks an1ong inmates\" \n(f)  Inmates with contagious diseases, including but not limited to boils, \nscabies and tuberculosis, are housed in the general population thereby \npromoting the spread of highly contagious diseases. \nInadequate Medical Staff: \n(a)  Due to an insufficient medical staff, imnates are often forced to wait days \neven weeks before receiving treatment for illnesses and ir\\juries. \n(b)  Exrunples include Plaintiff Elliott who was hurt following a fall from the \ntop bunk of his cell, seriously injuring his hip.  Despite nwnerous requests, \nElliott was forced to endure the pain from his injwies for approximately \nI 0 days before he was allowed to see the prison doctor.  And, after the \ndoctor instructed that Elliott be moved from the top tier and top bunk to \nprevent further injury, Elliott was transferred to protective custody which \nis located on the top tier of CCCF requiring him to negotiate stairs, with \nan injured hip, on a daily basis ..  Elliott is also now forced to sleep on the \nfloor on a thin mattress pad, with his head near the toilet, causing further \naggravation and injury to his hip. \n(c)  On another occasion, Plaintiff Elliott was not seen by a doctor for a full \n9 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 60   Filed 03/31/06   Page 10 of 21 PageID: 257\nmonth concerning a severe and initating skin rash, despite repeated \nwritten ru1d oral requests.  After finally being seen by a doctor, Elliott was \ndiagnosed with scabies, a highly contagious skin condition. \n(d)  Plaintiff Rudd had ru1 existing back condition when he anived at CCCF, \nbut despite numerous requests to be exan1ined, he was not seen by CCCF \nmedical staff for approximately one month. \n(e)  On another occasion Plaintiff Rudd injured his hand, yet it took a week \nbefore any of his requests to see CCCF medical pers01mel were \nacknowledged and an additional4 days before an X-ray of his had was \nactually taken. \n(f)  Plaintiff Rudd also suffers from asthma, requiring the regulru use of an \ninhaler.  It routinely takes days before Rudd is provided with an inhaler, \ndespite repeated requests. \nInadequate Dental Staff: \n(a)  Inmates are also deprived of sufficient dental care and are only given the \noption of extraction to alleviate any dental pain they are enduring. \n(b)  Plaintiff Rudd was forced to wait for days before he could have a tooth \npulled by a member ofthe dental staff, even though a nerve was exposed \nin his mouth resulting in severe pain.  The tooth was eventually pulled \ndespite Mr. Rudd's request to have the filling re-done; \nUnsanitary Meal Service: \n(a)  Meal trays are distributed in a marmer in which dirt, hair and other objects \nfrom the floor often end up on inmate trays and in their food. \n10 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 60   Filed 03/31/06   Page 11 of 21 PageID: 258\n(b)  Meal trays and plastic cups used for beverages often have dried food from \nprevious meals and dirt marks on them. \n(c)  In addition, many of the meal trays used are cracked, allowing for pockets \nof spoiled dishwasher water to collect inside of the trays creating a \ndisgusting stench. \n(d)  CCCF also suffers from an ongoing, severe fruit fly infestation.  Fruit fly \nnests can be found, among many other places, in or around the hot water \ntanks that are used to provide imnates with hot water for their soups and \ndrinks. \nUnderstaffed Maintenance Crew: \n(a)  The maintenance staff can often take a number of days to respond to \nurgent repairs such as clogged toilets, including the toilet of Plaintiff \nClark \nInadequate Toiletry Supplies: \n(a)  All cells, including those cells housing three and four inmates at a time, \nare forced to share only a single roll of toilet paper a week. \n(b)  At times imnates, including Plaintiffs Rudd and Clark, have been forced to \nuse their personal showering towel instead of toilet paper once their \nallotted weekly roll runs out \nInadequate Laundrv Service: \n(a)  Imnates are only given the opportunity to have personal items (e .. g ..  socks, \nboxer shorts, t-shirts, etc) laundered once a week and often items are \nstolen. \nII \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 60   Filed 03/31/06   Page 12 of 21 PageID: 259\n(b)  Plaintiffs Clark, Elliott and Rudd have all gone without personal laundry \nservice for weeks at time during different periods of their incarceration at \nCCCF. \n(c)  As a result, inmates, including Plaintiffs Clark and Rudd have been forced \nto wash their clothes in the small cell sink using only their bath soap in \nlieu of laundry detergent. \n(d)  Plaintiff Elliott has been forced to wash clothes in his toilet. \n(e)  Plaintiff Clark has also had numerous personallaw1dry items stolen while \nsupposedly being cleaned, and other irunates have had clothes come back \nfrom laundry with holes. \n30.  The conditions described above are just a few exan1ples of the ways in which the \nsevere overcrowding and w1derstaffing of CCCF has created an unsafe, w1sanitary and unhealthy \nenvirorm1ent  Plaintiffs have suffered ir~juries as a result of these violations of their rights under \nthe Eighth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n31.  Plaintiffs Dittimus Bey, Clark, Elliott and Rudd have submitted Irunate Grievance \nForms (\"Forms\") concerning all the above-mentioned conditions.  Frequently, however, the \nForms are never returned to the irunates for their signature, as required by the inmate handbook. \nMoreover, inmates, including tl1e Plaintiffs, are not provided with requisite information or \ndocun1entation to allow them to follow-up on an already filed grievance, or to appeal a grievance \ndetern1ination. Instead, irunates are forced to submit multiple Forms, concerning the san1e \ngrievance, day after day..  These grievance forms are deposited in bins that are often not emptied \nor reviewed for months at a time. \n32.  As a result of the conduct and events described herein, Plaintiff Dittimus Bey has \n12 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 60   Filed 03/31/06   Page 13 of 21 PageID: 260\nsuffered serious emotional and physical injuries, and has suffered real and measurable monetary \ndamages. \n33.  As a result of the conduct and events described herein, Plaintiff Clark has suffered \nserious emotional injuries, and has suffered real and measurable monetary dan1ages. \n34.  As a result of the conduct and events described herein, Plaintiff Elliott has \nsuffered serious emotional and physical injuries, and has suffered real and measurable monetary \ndamages. \n3 5.  As a result of the conduct and events described herein, Plaintiff Rudd has suffered \nserious emotional and physical injuries, and has suffered real and measurable monetary dan1ages. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n36.  Upon completion of discovery with respect to the scope of the Class and the Class \nPeriod, Plaintiffs reserve the right to amend the definition of the Class and/or the Class Period . \n.3 7.  Plaintiffs bring their claims under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment and Eighth Amendment to the Constitution pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23 as a class action on behalf of the following class (the \"Class\"): \nAll pre-trial detainees awaiting trial and convicted prisoners who \nare now, or who during the pendency of this suit would become, \nincarcerated in the Can1den County Correctional Facility . \n.38.  The Class, as defined above, is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable. \n39.  There are questions oflaw and fact that are common to the Class and predominate \nover any individual questions.  Among such common questions of Jaw and fact include, inter \nalia, the following: \na.  Whether the Camden County Correctional Facility is an overcrowded \n13 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 60   Filed 03/31/06   Page 14 of 21 PageID: 261\nfacility? \nb.  Whether the overcrowded conditions at the Camden County Correctional \nFacility create an unsafe, unsanitary, ar1d unhealthy environment for the \nimnates incarcerated at the facility? \nc.  Whether the conditions alleged, alone or in combination, deprive Plaintiffs \nof the minimal civilized measure oflife's necessities? \nd.  Whether the conditions alleged, alone or in combination, result in \nunquestioned and serious deprivations of basic human needs? \ne.  Whether the overcrowded environment at Camden County Correctional \nFacility lead to the deprivation of essential food, medical care, or \nsanitation? \nf  Whether the overcrowded enviromnent at Camden County Correctional \nFacility violates the Plaintiffs' Constitutional right to safe and healthy \nprison conditions? \ng..  Whether the Defendants acted or failed to act with deliberate indifference \nto a substantial risk of hard to inmate health or safety? \nh.  Whether the Defendants actions constitute cruel and unusual punishment? \n1.  Whether the Defendants violated the Plaintiffs' Eighth Amendment right \nto be free from cruel and unusual punishment? \nJ.  Whether the Defendants violated rights guaranteed to the Plaintiffs' by the \nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment? \nk.  Whether Defendar1ts should be enjoined from the continued \nunconstitutional practices of overcrowding? \n14 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 60   Filed 03/31/06   Page 15 of 21 PageID: 262\nI.  Whether Plaintiffs and members of the class are entitled to monetary \ndan1ages? \n40\"  Plaintiffs are members of the Class and their claims are typical of the claims of \nthe members of the Class as defined\" \n4 L  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the Class and the interests of all \nmembers of tl1e Class\" \n42.  Plaintiffs possess no interests that are antagonistic to or in the conflict with those \ninterests that they have undertal(en to represent the Class as Class representatives. \n4 3.  Plaintiffs are represented by competent and experienced class action counsel who \nare able to effectively represent the interests of the entire Class. \n44.  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the \nClass, thereby maldng appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with \nrespect to the Class as a who leo \n45.  A class action is superior to other litigation methods (including individual \nlitigation) for the fair and efficient adjudication of Plaintiffs' claims as presented by this \nComplaint and will prevent tl1e undue financial, administrative, and procedural burdens on the \nparties and the Court  Because the damages sustained by individual members of the Class are \nmodest and due to the costs of individual litigation, it may be impracticable for Class members to \npursue individual litigation against Defendants in order to vindicate their rights ..  In addition, \nindividual actions would create the risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications that would \nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for Defendants with respect to the treatment of \ninmates of CCCF. \n15 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 60   Filed 03/31/06   Page 16 of 21 PageID: 263\nLEGAL CLAIMS \nCOUNT I \nAsserted, Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, Against  Taylor, Loberto and Ripa For \nViolating Plaintiffs' Eighth Amendment Right to Safe and Healthy Prison Conditions \n46.

As a result of the County's illegal customs, policies, and practices, Plaintiffs and \nthe Class have suffered nun1erous violations of their rights under the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment. \nWHEREFORE, the County is liable, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, for violating \nPlaintiffs' right to reasonably safe and healthy prison conditions under the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of a class of all those similarly \nsituated, respectfully requests that this Court: \n(a)  Enter a declaratory judgment that Defendants' conduct violated Plaintiffs' \nFourteenth and Eighth Amendment rights to safe prison conditions; \n(b)  Enter a declaratory judgment that the County's custom, policy, and practice of \novercrowding and understaffing the CCCF violates inmates Fourteenth and Eighth Amendment \n20 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 60   Filed 03/31/06   Page 21 of 21 PageID: 268\nright to safe, sanitary and healthy prison conditions; \n(c)  Enter an injunction ordering the Defendants to reduce the population at the CCCF \nto constitutional levels; \n(d)  Enter an injunction ordering Defendants to hire additional staff at the CCCF; \n(e)  Enter an injunction ordering Defendants to house i1m1ates afflicted by contagious \ndiseases in an area separate from general population; \n(f)  Award of monetary dan1ages; \n(g)  Award Plaintiffs all litigation costs, expenses, and attorney's fees recoverable \nunder federal law; and \n(h)  Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \nJURY TRIAL DEMANDED \nPlaintiffs demand a trial by jury as to all issues so triable. \nDated:  March 31, 2006  Respectfully submitted, \nTRUJILLO RODRIGUEZ & RICHARDS, LLC \nBy:  Is Lisa J.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \nPlaintiffs, on behalf of the certified class of current and future inmates of the \nCamden  County  Correctional  Facility  (โCCCFโ  or  โJailโ),  submit  this \nmemorandum of law in support of their unopposed motion for final approval of the \nSixth and Final Amended Consent Decree (hereinafter โFinal Consent Decreeโ or \nโFinal Settlementโ) (Exhibit A).1    \nThis Court should grant final approval of this Class Action Settlement which \ncomes  after  twelve  (12)  years  of  litigation,  extensive  settlement  negotiations \namong the parties and experts in the field, and the implementation of significant \nchanges to the Camden County criminal justice system, including the creation of \nthe Camden County Pretrial Services Program. \n The road to this motion for final approval has not been a smooth one. The \nparties, in crafting the terms of the six consent decrees in this litigation, recognized \nthe practical and legal limitations that prevent the use of what otherwise may seem \n                                         \n \n1 The first Consent Decree, entitled โInterim Consent Decree,โ was approved by \nthe Court by Order dated January 22, 2008. Dkt. No. 90. The Second Consent \nDecree was approved by the Court by Order dated August 20, 2009. Dkt. No. 110. \nThe Amended Third Consent Decree was approved by the Court by Order dated \nMarch 4, 2011. Dkt. No. 121. The Fourth Consent Decree, intended as the Final \nConsent Decree, was preliminarily approved by Order dated December 26, 2013. \nThe parties withdrew that consent decree in advance of the fairness hearing. A \nFifth Consent Decree was intended to supplant the Fourth Decree but that too was \nwithdrawn  prior  to  Court  approval.  The  Sixth  and  Final  Consent  Decree  was \npreliminarily approved on February 21, 2017. \n1 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 6 of 34 PageID: 3730\nlike obvious solutions to the overcrowded Jail conditions:  for instance, the Warden \ncannot  refuse  admission  to  individuals  because  the  Jail  population  reaches \nunconstitutional levels (N.J.S.A. ยง 30:8-1); the County cannot be ordered to simply \nbuild  a  new  jail  to  accommodate  the  population  (18  U.S.C.  ยง \n3632(a)(1)(C)(โNothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the courts, in \nexercising their remedial powers, to order the construction of prisonsโฆโ); and, the \nCourt  cannot  place  a  cap  on  the  prison  population,  which  would  result  in  the \npremature release of inmates, until other remedies have been exhausted (18 U.S.C. \n3632(a)(3)).    \nThese  are  very  real  and  significant  hurdles  to  effectively  remedying  the \noverpopulation.  The  parties,  however,  in  conjunction  with  non-party  criminal \njustice stakeholders have worked diligently and closely with each other and with \nexperts to devise a plan that is an efficient, effective and long-term solution to the \noverpopulation at the Jail.  The parties also worked to put measures into place to \nassure  the  sanitary  preparation  and  service  of  meals,  and  undertook  significant \nmeasures to successfully redress heightened CO2 levels that affected the air quality \nwithin the Jail. \nThe settlement process was comprised of a series of Consent Decrees. The \nSecond Consent Decree approved by the Court on August 20, 2009, set forth the \nterms of the settlement that included the implementation of various programs and \n2 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 7 of 34 PageID: 3731\nefforts to reduce the population, as well as suggested remediation of environmental \nissues. The Amended Third Consent Decree, approved by the Court on March 4, \n2011, detailed the Defendantโs compliance with the terms of the Second Consent \nDecree,  and  the  impact  it  had  on  the  Jailโs  population.  At  the  time  the  Third \nConsent Decree was entered, there remained only two open issues. The first issue \nrelated to the hiring of a full time Jail Population Manager, and the second issue \nrelated to reduced air flow and ventilation in certain cell units causing heightened \nCO2 levels. Since entry of the Third Consent Decree, Defendants have permanently \nfilled  the  position  of  Jail  Population  Manager,  and  have  remediated  the \nenvironmental concerns. The Defendantsโ compliance with these terms is set forth \nin the Amended Final Consent Decree.  \nAccordingly,  through  this  motion,  Plaintiffs  seek  final  approval  of  the \nAmended Final Consent Decree.  \nII.  BACKGROUND \nOn January 6, 2005, nine pro se complainants incarcerated at CCCF filed a \nclass action complaint (โComplaintโ) under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 alleging violations of \nthe  Sixth,  Eighth,  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  of  the  Constitution  by  various \nmunicipal defendants. See generally Dkt. No. 1. The Complaint alleged, inter alia, \nthat  inmates  were  forced  to  live  in  overcrowded  conditions  at  CCCF,  which \nincluded up to four individuals living in a cell designed for a single inmate. See id.  \n3 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 8 of 34 PageID: 3732\nOn  November  4,  2005,  the  Court  granted  Plaintiff  Corri  Dittimus-Beyโs \nMotion for the appointment of counsel under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915(e). See Dkt. No. 35. \nIn this same Order, the Court appointed Lisa Rodriguez of Trujillo Rodriguez and \nRichards, LLC to represent Plaintiffs. See id.   \nOn March 31, 2006, Plaintiffs, through their newly appointed counsel, filed \nan  Amended  Class  Action  Complaint  (โAmended  Complaintโ)  against  CCCF, \nCamden County Department of Corrections, Camden County, Warden Eric Taylor, \nDeputy Warden Frank Loberto, and Joseph Ripa (โDefendantsโ). See Dkt. No. 60. \nIn their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that the policies and practices of \nDefendants  created  unconstitutional  conditions  that  both  pretrial  detainees  and \nconvicted  prisoners  were  forced  to  endure  while  incarcerated  at  CCCF.  See \ngenerally id. at ยถยถ 13-35. These included, inter alia, overcrowded cells, inadequate \nsleeping  arrangements,  insufficient  medical  and  dental  care,  unsanitary  meal \nservice, understaffed maintenance personnel, and inadequate laundry service and \ncleaning supplies. Id. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Id.  \nFollowing  extensive  discovery  and  research,  Plaintiffs  moved  for  class \ncertification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). By Order dated July \n31, 2007, this Court certified a class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2), consisting of: \nAll  individuals  incarcerated  at  the  Camden  County \nCorrectional  Facility,  either  as  pretrial  detainees  or  as \nconvicted prisoners, from the inception of this lawsuit on \nJanuary 6, 2005 until its termination. \n4 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 9 of 34 PageID: 3733\nSee Dkt. No. 80. Certification under Rule 23(b)(2), rather than Rule 23(b)(3), was \nappropriate because the remedies Plaintiffs sought were injunctive and declaratory \nin  nature.  Specifically,  the  Plaintiffs  sought  to  remedy  the  unconstitutional \nconditions of confinement they allege exist in CCCF. Following class certification, \nPlaintiffs no longer sought, through this action, monetary damages for injuries --  \npersonal,  emotional  or  otherwise  --  that  may  have  stemmed  from  any  alleged \nunconstitutional condition within the CCCF.   \nThe certified Class was informed of the litigation and the fact that monetary \ndamages were not being sought by court-approved Class Notice, which was posted \nin each jail cellblock for a thirty-day period, commencing November 22, 2007. See  \nDkt. No. 86.  \nPlaintiffs  engaged  highly-qualified  and  experienced  conditions  of \nconfinement and overcrowding expert, Steve Martin. See Dkt. No. 108 (Second \nConsent  Decree,  Ex.  A).  Prior  to  rendering  his  opinion,  Mr.  Martin  reviewed \nhundreds of documents and conducted an in-depth, three-day site inspection of the \nJail.  Based upon his review of these materials and his site inspection, Mr. Martin \nconcluded that the population was at such excessive levels that nothing short of \nplant  expansion  or  complex  population  control  strategies  would  reduce  the \npopulation. \nThe  CCCF  is  dangerously  overcrowded  creating \npervasive  risks of  harm to both  inmate population and \n5 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 10 of 34 PageID: 3734\nfacility  staff.  The  sheer  number  of  inmates  housed  in \nseriously  substandard  and  spatially  dense  in-cell \nconditions throughout the facility has overwhelmed the \ninfra-structure and its necessary support service systems. \nThe  ability  of  management  to  deliver  basic  necessities \nhas been seriously compromised as has the ability of staff \nto maintain minimal levels of safety and security for the \ninmate  population.  Absent  a  combination  of  both \nphysical  plant  expansion  and  population  control \nstrategies,  the  harmful  conditions  set  out  herein  will \ncontinue unabated with ever present risks of more serious \ndisruptions at the facility than heretofore seen. \nSee  Id.  (Second  Consent  Decree,  Ex.  A  (June  29,  2007  Martin  Report, \nCONCLUSION,  pp.  15-16)).  Mr.  Martin  further  explained  that  the  problems \nassociated with overcrowding are a: \n. . . manifestation of larger and more systemic problems \nrelated to the county criminal justice system.  While there \ncertainly may be short term strategies that provide some \nreduction of the overcrowding, such as temporary or fast-\ntrack  housing  in  combination  with  maximizing/ \nexpanding  existing  diversion  and  release  mechanisms, \nthe  magnitude  of  such  systemic  problems  that  face \ncounty  officials  will  require  a  total  systems  approach \nfrom professional criminal justice planners for long term \nresolution.     \nSee id. \nMr. Martin thereafter rendered a supplemental report, dated September 28, \n2007, in which he was asked to make specific recommendations for measures that \nshould be taken to address problems alleged in the complaint. See Dkt. No. 108 \n(Second  Consent  Decree,  Ex.  B).  In  response,  Mr.  Martin  specifically \n6 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 11 of 34 PageID: 3735\nrecommended the retention of two criminal justice planning firms to address this \nsystem-wide problem of overcrowding. One of the firms Mr. Martin recommended \nwas Pulitzer Bogard & Associates.  \nBy Interim Consent Decree dated January 22, 2008, the Court authorized the \nretention  of  Pulitzer  Bogard  for  the  purpose  of  conducting  a  staffing  and \npopulation analysis. Dkt. No. 90. Those reports were finalized in April of 2008. \nSee Dkt. No. 108 (Second Consent Decree, Ex. C and D). \nThereafter, by Order dated November 3, 2008, the Court granted the parties' \nrequest  to  retain  the  Pulitzer  Bogard  firm  for  the  purpose  of  developing \nimprovements and/or changes within the criminal justice system aimed at reducing \nthe jail population. See Dkt. No. 98. Plaintiffs soon thereafter retained Pulitzer \nBogard  and  work  immediately  commenced.  The  extent  and  nature  of  the \nbackground work Pulitzer undertook is set forth in its report. See Dkt. No. 108 \n(Second Consent Decree, Ex. F). \nOn  or  about  April  21,  2009,  Pulitzer  Bogard  issued  its  report  entitled \nโCamden County NJ Jail Population Analysisโ to the parties.  The Bogard Report \nset forth twenty-two (22) specific recommendations aimed at reducing the Jailโs \npopulation. See Dkt. No. 108 (Second Consent Decree, Ex. F). \n In order to proceed with the implementation of the recommendations set \nforth in the Bogard Report, the parties entered into a Second Consent Decree, dated \n7 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 12 of 34 PageID: 3736\nJuly 20, 2009 and approved by the Court on August 20, 2009. The Second Consent \nDecree  provided  for  the  implementation  of  six  recommendations  that  were \ndesigned to result in the most significant reduction in jail population, the hiring of \nLuminosity, Inc. for the purpose of implementing those recommendations, and the \nvoluntary creation of the Jail Population Reduction Sub-committee.  \nThe Defendantsโ compliance with the terms of the Second Decree, as well as \ntheir voluntary implementation of other measures aimed at the reduction of the jail \npopulation, was set forth in the partiesโ Amended Third Consent Decree. See Dkt. \nNo. 121 (Amended Third Consent Decree). \nThe Amended Third Consent Decree detailed the significant measures that \nthe Defendants had put into place to monitor the Jail population and, as a result of \nthe  Defendantsโ  compliance  with  the  terms  of  the  Second  and  Third  Consent \nDecrees, the Jail population has been reduced and the overall processing of the \ncriminal  justice  system  significantly  revamped  and  improved.  Rather  than \nreiterating the significant steps taken by the Defendants in compliance with the \nterms of the Second Consent Decree, reference is  made to the Amended Third \nConsent Decree which was approved by the Court by Order dated March 4, 2011. \nThe Third Consent Decree recited at length the successful implementation of the \nBogard Report  recommendations, as well as the  voluntary steps  undertaken by \n8 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 13 of 34 PageID: 3737\nDefendants  as  well  as  voluntary  participants  within  the  criminal  justice \ncommunity. \nThe  gravamen  of  Plaintiffsโ  complaint  was  Jail  overcrowding  and  so, \nimportantly, the settlement of  this  litigation  has  resulted  in  not only a  reduced \npopulation but systemic changes aimed at managing the Jailโs population so that \nunconstitutional population levels are not reached in the future.   \nThe rated capacity of the Jail is 1267.  When this litigation commenced in \n2005, the annual average daily population was 1848 inmates. See Dkt. No 121 \n(Third  Consent  Decree,  Ex.  A  (Camden  County  Average  Monthly  Jail \nPopulation)). In October of 2005, the Jail reached a previously  unseen  high of \n1,989 inmates. The majority of cell units were shared by at least three, if not four, \ninmates. For cells that were triple-bunked, an inmate was forced to sleep on the \nfloor. For cells that were quadruple-bunked, two inmates were forced to sleep on \nthe floor, one of which slept with his head inches from the toilet.   \nFollowing entry of the Second Consent Decree, in May of 2010, the Jailโs \naverage monthly population reached an all-time low of 1232 inmates, below the \nJailโs rated capacity.  As a result of the lower population, bed overages were 48 on \nJune 2, 2010,  meaning that only 48 cells housed three  inmates. All other cells \nhoused either one or two inmates. No cell housed four inmates. \n9 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 14 of 34 PageID: 3738\nOn September 21, 2012, the daily population was 1414. Although above the \nJailโs rated capacity, it was being managed by the former Jail Population Manager, \nas  well  as  the  classification  unit  and  the  parties  did  not  view  the  population \nincrease  as  an  impediment  to  final  settlement  of  this  matter.  By  Order  dated \nDecember 26, 2012, the Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. Dkt. \nNo. 137. A Fairness Hearing was scheduled for February 27, 2013. Dkt. No. 137.  \nBetween the time Counsel filed their Motion for Preliminary Approval and \nthe  deadline  for  briefing  in  support  of  Final  Approval  of  this  class  action \nsettlement, the Jailโs population increased dramatically, by nearly 160 inmates. In \nparticular, on September 21, 2012, when the motion for preliminary approval was \nfiled, the Jail population was 1414. At the time the adjournment of final approval \nwas requested in February 2013, the population had reached 1583. Due to this \nsudden  increase,  by  letter  dated  February  4,  2013,  Class  Counsel  sought  an \nadjournment of the Final Approval deadline. Dkt. No. 141.  \nA thorough investigation followed and the parties jointly determined that, \nalthough the systems put into place by Luminosity were effective (as detailed in \nthe  Second  and  Third  Consent  Decrees),  they  were  not  being  managed  by  an \nappropriate Jail Manager. The position of the Jail Population Manager was at the \ntime being filled by Jail personnel. It was determined that the position must be \n10 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 15 of 34 PageID: 3739\nfilled by someone outside the Jail to be effective. See Amended Final Consent \nDecree ยถ 24.  \nThe County then undertook an exhaustive search for a qualified applicant \nand experienced  great difficulty  in  finding one.  The position requires a  unique \ncombination of skill and personality. After reviewing over 100 applications, the \nCounty narrowed the field to a handful and eventually hired Brian Jacobs. Mr. \nJacobsโ one year contract began November 2013.  \nDuring his one-year tenure, Mr. Jacobs worked closely with Counsel and all \ncriminal justice stakeholders to isolate areas of improvement and focus on areas \nthat would result in both immediate and long term solutions to over-crowding. He \nreported monthly to the County. As a result of his efforts, the Jailโs population \nbegan to trend downwards, thereby reinforcing the partiesโ view that the system \nwas working effectively, but that the Jail Manager position was instrumental in \nensuring the proper working of these newly implemented processes.  \nDuring Mr. Jacobโs tenure, the population decreased from 1519 (November \n12, 2013) to 1456 (November 12, 2014), with a decrease in bed overages by nearly \n10% from the year prior. Importantly, too, the population was trending downward \ndespite the increase in the number of arrests and commitments. See Amended Final \nConsent Decree, ยถ 27. \n11 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 16 of 34 PageID: 3740\nAs of September 2014, the number of arrests was on target to exceed the \nnumber of arrests made in 2009 when the population fluctuated between 1700 and \n1800.  Without  the  new  processes  in  place,  as  managed  by  the  Jail  Population \nManager, the population would likely have been at or near the excessive levels \nseen in 2008 and 2009. See Amended Final Consent Decree, ยถ 27. \nOn  December  18,  2014,  the  population  was  1376.  See  Amended  Final \nConsent Decree, ยถ 27. \nMr. Jacobsโ contract was not renewed at the end of his contract year. It was \ninitially represented that the position of the Jail Population Manager would be \nfilled by Dr. Marie VanNostrand of Luminosity. Based on those representations \nand with the jail population trending down, counsel for plaintiffs believed it was \ntime to finally resolve this matter and entered into what was referred to as the Fifth \nand Final Consent Decree. Plaintiffs also filed a motion for preliminary approval. \nDkt. No. 169. Subsequent to the filing of that motion for preliminary approval, \nplaintiffsโ counsel learned that, despite the representations made, the position of \nJail Population Manager was not being filled by Dr. VanNostrand or anyone else. \nThe  County  indicated  that  it  was  initiating  a  process  to  hire  a  new  Jail \nManager but had not done so. Because a core component of the partiesโ settlement \nrelies on an independent Jail Manager to monitor the daily jail population numbers, \nand history had shown that without such a person in place the population numbers \n12 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 17 of 34 PageID: 3741\nincreased, it was determined that it was not appropriate to proceed with the motion \nfor preliminary approval. That motion was then withdrawn. Dkt. No. 170.  \nA new full-time Jail Manager, Sharon Bean, was hired in April 2015. The \njail  population  is  again  being  actively  managed  and  the  downward  trend  has \ncontinued. As of May 10, 2017, the jail population was 996, well below the rated \ncapacity  of  1,267.  It  is  against  this  background  that  the  plaintiffs  seek  final \napproval of the Amended Final Consent Decree. \nIII.  DEFENDANTS HAVE COMPLIED WITH THE REMAINING \nTERMS OF THE AMENDED THIRD CONSENT DECREE  \nAs  previously  mentioned,  at  the  time  the  Third  Consent  Decree  was \napproved by the Court, the only two remaining issues related to the Jailโs HVAC \nsystem and the hiring of a full time Jail Population Manager. The Defendants are \nnow in compliance with those terms and, accordingly, entry of the Final Decree is \nappropriate.  \nA.  JAIL POPULATION MANAGER \nThe Jail Population Manager is responsible for monitoring, coordinating and \nensuring the most efficient processing of Jail inmates. She collects, compiles and \nconducts  quantitative  data  analysis  to  identify  trends  and  potential  systematic \ncauses  of  processing  delays  as  well  as  opportunities  to  expedite  release  and \ntransfers. In addition to these duties, the jail population manager facilitates and \nprovides services to the Jail Population Reduction Subcommittee (โJPRCโ). The \n13 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 18 of 34 PageID: 3742\nposition  serves  as  a  liaison  to  the  courts,  prosecutor,  defense  bar,  community \ncorrections programs, JPRC and other criminal justice stakeholders on behalf of \nthe County and Jail as it relates to population management. \nSharon Bean was hired for the position in April 2015 and continues in the \nJail  Population  Manager  position  today.  Ms.  Bean  is  well-credentialed  with \nspecific (successful) experience managing the population of juveniles in custody. \nShe  graduated  with  a  B.A.  in  Criminal  Justice  and  Masters  of  Public \nAdministration. Prior to becoming the Camden County Jail Population Manager, \nMs.  Bean  worked  with  the  New  Jersey  Juvenile  Justice  Commission  (JJC)  for \nthirteen years. Since 2004, Ms. Bean has worked with the JJC to implement the \nAnnie E. Casey  Foundationโs Juvenile Detention  Alternatives Initiative (JDAI). \nJDAI  is  a  national  initiative  designed  to  safely  reduce  the  number  of  youth \nunnecessarily or inappropriately incarcerated in secure detention. Ms. Bean was \nthe Team Leader for JDAI in NJ and a national trainer for JDAI. In her role as \nTeam Leader, Ms. Bean worked with system stakeholders to implement over 500 \npolicies  and  practices  at  both  the  state  and  local  level  to  improve  access  to \ndetention alternatives, reduce case processing delays contributing to length of stay \nin detention, reduce racial and ethnic disparities, and develop strategies to improve \ncourt  appearance  rates  and  successful  outcomes  on  Probation.  Ms.  Bean  also \nassisted in the development, implementation, and monitoring of NJโs Juvenile Risk \n14 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 19 of 34 PageID: 3743\nScreening Tool and the Juvenile Probation Sanctions, Incentives, and Interventions \nSystem. She worked directly with Camden County to implement juvenile justice \nreform and saw the average daily population in detention decreased 48.7% with \nover one-thousand fewer youth having been admitted to secure detention. \nB.  DEFENDANTS HAVE REMEDIED THE INCREASED CO2 LEVELS \nIn 2007, Plaintiffs retained the services of Urban Engineers (โUrbanโ), an \nenvironmental expert, for the purpose of conducting an on-site inspection of the \nJail to inspect mold and mildew, water quality, air pollution and rodent infestation.  \nUrban  Engineers  issued  a  report  dated  September  28,  2007.  Although  Urban \nEngineersโ initial inspection did not reveal any environmental hazards that would \nrise  to  the  level  of  constitutional  violations,  it  did  note  areas  that  warranted \nimprovement.  Urban Engineers also concluded that many of the areas noted for \nimprovement may resolve themselves simply by virtue of a population reduction.  \nUrban also found elevated CO2 levels. \nIn August 2010, prior to entering into this Third Consent Decree, Plaintiffs \nagain retained the services of Urban for the purpose of conducting a supplemental \nsite inspection to determine if, in fact, some of the noted areas of concern had \nimproved simply by virtue of the population reduction, as was expected. In its \nNovember 10, 2010 follow-up Report, Urban again found elevated CO2 levels and \nopined that the levels had not improved since 2007, but instead had worsened and \n15 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 20 of 34 PageID: 3744\nnoted that the cause may be from HVAC balancing issues. High CO2 readings \nindicate that the building has significant airflow issues, and a balancing report is \nthe first step in addressing these issues.  \nThe County retained Fischer Balancing Company to perform a balancing \ntest. Fischer issued a report dated September 27, 2011, which was reviewed and \nanalyzed by Urban. As a result of collaborative meetings between Fischer, Urban \nand  the  Camden  County  Improvement  Authority,  the  County  retained  CM3 \nBuilding Solutions to perform systematic maintenance and repairs to the facilities.   \nOn April 3, 2012, Urban conducted a follow-up air survey and reported an \naverage CO2 level of 1788 ppm. This was a noticeable improvement from Urbanโs \nSeptember 2010 survey, which had a maximum CO2 reading of 2,700 ppm.   \nUrban  conducted  another  follow-up  air  survey  on  June  5,  2012,  and \ndetermined  that  the  average  CO2  concentration  within  the  individual  cells  had \ndepressed 149 ppm from its previous inspection.  Urban concluded that although \nlevels above 1000 ppm (which are still present in individual cells) indicate general \nairflow issues, the levels noted during the April and June 2012 surveys (1788 ppm \nand  1639  ppm  respectively)  were  well  below  the  suggested  maximum  daily \nexposure  levels  of  5000-10000  ppm.  Urban  further  recommended  that  until  a \npermanent Building Management System is installed, the Jail could continue its \nfocus of maintaining and increasing airflow to the individual cell registers. The \n16 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 21 of 34 PageID: 3745\nCounty continues these efforts and requires that Jail  maintenance staff conduct \nperiodic CO2 surveys of the individual cells and monitory concentration trends. \nC.  THE 2016 SURVEY \nGiven the passage of time the parties agreed that it was appropriate to have \nanother  follow-up  survey  done.  The  County  agreed  to  again  retain  Urban \nEngineers to conduct the follow-up environmental examination and air survey. On \nJanuary  12  and  13,  2016,  Urban  Engineers,  with  the  assistance  of  Batta \nEnvironmental Associates, Inc., conducted a site visit to identify potential sources \nof poor air quality at the Jail. The site visit consisted of visual inspection, ambient \nair  monitoring  (temperature,  relative  humidity,  carbon  monoxide  and  CO2) \nairborne mold sampling, and an assessment of the building and HVAC system. \nUrban issued its report on February 17, 2016. The report noted that, while \nCO2 levels continued to be higher than the ASHRAE2 recommendations in some \nlocations, they were in fact below OSHAโs Time-Weighted average permissible \nexposure limit. The highest levels were detected in an inside recreation area, which \nthe  report  noted could be expected when a large  group of people concentrated \nwithout outside air to dilute and remove the CO2 continuously generated by the \noccupants. \n                                         \n \n2 American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers \n17 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 22 of 34 PageID: 3746\nThe report found no indoor air quality issues relating to carbon monoxide \nand no elevated airborne mold levels within the facility were detected. \nIt is also worthy of mention that the County made a number of other major \ncapital improvements in the past several years, including the modernization and \nupgrade  of  the  elevator  system;  significant  upgrades  and  repairs  to  the  HVAC \nsystem;  lighting  upgrades;  upgrades  and  improvements  to  some  of  the  shower \nenclosures;  and  the  modernization  and  renovations  to  a  portion  of  the  exterior \nwindows. \nIV.  THE SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS OF THE COUNTY TO REDUCE \nTHE JAIL POPULATION \nAlthough detailed in the partiesโ Second and Third Consent Decrees, it is \nworthy  of  reiteration  some  of  the  significant  improvements  this  settlement  has \nbrought to the processing of inmates through the Camden County criminal justice \nsystem thereby effectively and efficiently managing the Jail population.  \nA.  THE CREATION OF A PRETRIAL SERVICES AGENCY \nPerhaps  most  significant,  as  detailed  in  the  parties  Second  and  Third \nConsent  Decrees,  was  the  creation  of  a  very  robust  pretrial  services  program, \nknown the โCamden County Pretrial Services Agency.โ  The mission of Camden \nCounty Pretrial Services Agency (โPretrial Servicesโ) is to safely and effectively \nreduce pretrial detention by identifying inmates appropriate for conditional release \npending disposition and, when ordered by the Court, provide effective supervision \n18 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 23 of 34 PageID: 3747\nand services intended to assure appearance in court and safety of the community. \nSee Dkt. No. 121 Third Consent Decree, Ex. B (Camden County Pretrial Services \nPamphlet). \nA defendant must be eligible for pretrial services. The target population for a \npretrial investigation consists of defendants who have been admitted to the Jail \nwith a bail set in an amount not greater than $35,000 and is within the jurisdiction \nof the Camden County  Superior Court.  Defendants charged with the  following \noffenses are not targeted for an investigation:  murder, arson, kidnapping, sexual \nassault, weapon charges involving firearms, or any charge that meets the criteria \nfor bail restrictions.  Defendants serving a sentence or who have a detainer are also \nnot targeted. \nPretrial Services began operations on August 16, 2010 and has been fully \noperational since the first week of September 2010, at which time the program \nofficially  began  providing  pretrial  investigations  to  the  Court  for  appropriate \ncandidates and pretrial supervision when ordered by the Court.   \nThe program is staffed by employees of Camden County. Camden County is \nthe  first  county  within  New  Jersey  to  create  a  pretrial  services  program.  The \ncreation of this program has garnered a tremendous amount of attention from other \ncounties experiencing similar jail overcrowding problems and it is anticipated that \nCamden Countyโs pretrial agency will serve as a model for years to come. \n19 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 24 of 34 PageID: 3748\nFrom January 1, 2016 through November 2016, the program screened 2,033 \ninmates, conducted 515 investigations, recommended 460 inmates for release to \npretrial services, and received 296 placements on supervision.  \nReferrals  to  the  program  are  accepted  from  the  prosecutorโs  office,  the \npublic defenderโs office and private defense bar, or the Superior Court. Release \ndecisions to the program are made by all of the Camden County criminal judges.   \nB.  OTHER MEASURES AIMED AT REDUCING JAIL POPULATION \nIn addition to the creation of the pretrial services program, the Defendants \nhave  also  undertaken  a  variety  of  other  measures  that  successfully  contributed \ntowards the reduction of the Jailโs population. These measures include, but are not \nlimited to: \n(1)  Accurate recording of inmate credit for time spent in custody;  \n(2)   Creation of four additional attorney/inmate visitation rooms;   \n(3)    Reduction in the amount of time between sentencing inmates to the \nhome  electronic  device  (HED)  program  and  the  actual  release  onto  the  HED \nprogram. The Defendants also agreed to proactively screen inmates for the HED \nprogram  and  make  a  recommendation  to  the  Court  when  an  eligible  inmate  is \nidentified. As a result of this new policy, the jail increased its HED capacity from \n75 electronic monitoring devices to 125 electronic monitoring devices by receiving \nfifty (50) additional devices with GPS technology; \n20 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 25 of 34 PageID: 3749\n(4)   Creation and voluntary continuation of the Jail Population Reduction \nSub-Committee,  a  voluntary  committee  comprised  of  (but  not  limited  to) \nrepresentatives  from  the  Jail,  the  Camden  Vicinage  of  the  Superior  Court,  the \nProsecutorโs Office and the Public Defenderโs Office, whose participation has been \nvital to the success of reducing the jail crowding. The newly hired Jail Population \nManager is a member of this committee; and \n(5)   Improved CCIS data, which  was  viewed as essential to effectively \nimplementing any jail population reductions strategy. The lack of accurate data \nserved  as  a  barrier  to  the  identification  of  opportunities  to  reduce  the  jail \npopulation and the inability to easily access information about the jail inmates. The \nability to run queries based on custody status, length of stay, location/program, and \nbail amount enables justice system stakeholders the ability to target inmates for jail \nalternatives  and/or  faster  case  processing.  Luminosity  developed  a  web-based \nCCIS interface. This CCIS interface allows authorized justice system stakeholders \nto view and analyze the jail population on a daily basis. The system, named the Jail \nPopulation  Analysis Wizard (JPAW)  is an  ASP.NET application accessible  via \nFirefox web browser. JPAW was fully implemented on May 5, 2010. Access is \navailable to the Prosecutorโs Office, Sheriffโs Department, Jail, Public Defenderโs \nOffice, and County staff.  There is even a laptop located on the 6th floor of the Hall \nof  Justice  with  access  to  JPAW.  In  order  to  effectively  utilize  the  upgraded \n21 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 26 of 34 PageID: 3750\ncomputer  system,  the  County  created  and  staffed  the  position  of  Data  Quality \nAnalyst. This position is essential to the continued use and function of the JPAW \nsystem which, as set forth above, is critical to analyzing and maintaining the Jail \npopulation.    Although  not  required  by  The  Bogard  Report,  or  earlier  Consent \nDecrees, this position was deemed essential to the continued success of the jail \npopulation reduction efforts. \nV.  THE COURT SHOULD APPROVE THE SETTLEMENT \nA.  THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IS FAIR, REASONABLE AND ADEQUATE \nThe Court may approve a class action settlement only if it is โfair reasonable \nand adequate.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2). The Third Circuit has adopted a nine-\nfactor test to make this determination. The test was first stated in Girsh v. Jepson, \n521 F. 2d 153, 157 (3d Cir. 1975). The elements of this test have become known as \nthe โGirsh factors.โ In deciding whether to approve a settlement, the Court must \nconsider: \n(1)  the  complexity,  expense  and  likely  duration  of  the \nlitigation; (2) the reaction of the class to the settlement; \n(3)  the  stage  of  the  proceedings  and  the  amount  of \ndiscovery  completed;  (4)  the  risks  of  establishing \nliability;  (5)  the  risks  of  establishing  damages;  (6)  the \nrisks of maintaining the class action through the trial; (7) \nthe  ability  of  the  defendants  to  withstand  a  greater \njudgment;  (8)  the  range  of  reasonableness  of  the \nsettlement fund in light of the best possible recovery; (9) \nthe range of reasonableness of the settlement fund to a \npossible  recovery  in  light  of  all  the  attendant  risks  of \nlitigation. \n22 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 27 of 34 PageID: 3751\nIn re Schering-Plough Corp.

Litig., 455 F. 3d 160, 164-65 (3d Cir. 2006).  \nAs this Court has held, applying Girsh is not a mechanical exercise: \nThese factors are a guide and the absence of one or more \ndoes not automatically render the settlement unfair . . . . \nRather, the court must look at all the circumstances of the \ncase and determine whether the settlement is within the \nrange of reasonableness under Girsh . . . . In sum, the \nCourtโs  assessment  of  whether  the  settlement  is  fair, \nadequate and reasonable is guided by the Girsh factors, \nbut the Court is in no way limited to considering only \nthose  enumerated  factors  and  is  free  to  consider  other \nrelevant  circumstances  and  facts  involved  in  [the] \nSettlement.  \nPlymouth  Cnty.

The Third Circuit has directed \ndistrict courts to apply an โinitial presumption of fairnessโ to settlements if they \nfind: \n(1) the settlement negotiations occurred at armโs length; \n(2) there was sufficient discovery; (3) the proponents of \nthe settlement are experienced in similar litigation; and \n(4) only a small fraction of the Class objected. \nIn re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., 391 F. 3d 516, 535 (3d Cir. 2004), quoting \nIn re Cendant Corp Litig., 264 F 3d 201, 232 n.18 (3d Cir 2001) (Cendant I); \n23 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 28 of 34 PageID: 3752\nHenderson v. Volvo Cars of N. Am. LLC., No 09-cv-4146, 2013 WL 1192479 at *7 \n(D. N.J. Mar 22, 2013) (same).  \nHere, the Court should find the proposed settlement presumptively fair. It is \nundisputed that the settlement was negotiated over many years, at armโs-length. \nAnd  while  the  negotiations  were  not  necessarily  adversarial,  they  were  done \ncooperatively with principals and experts in the field with the common goal of \nfinding ways to reduce and control the jail population.  \nThere has been sufficient discovery comprised of years of data and the input \nfrom  stakeholders  and  experts  in  the  field  concerning  issues  of  prison \novercrowding. Class Counsel is experienced in complex litigation and has been \ninvolved in over a hundred class action cases. And while the Notice posted in the \nCourt House and Jail has prompted interest in the litigation, there have been no \nobjections to this Settlement. \nThis Settlement also satisfies the Girsh factors. \n1.  Complexity, Expense and Likely Duration of the Litigation \nThe first Girsh factor is whether the settlement avoids a lengthy, complex, \nand  expensive  continuation  of  the  litigation.  โThis  factor  is  concerned  with \nassessing the  probable costs,  in both time and  money, of continued  litigation.โ  \nSchering-Plough ERISA, 2012 WL 1964451, at *4 (quoting Cendant I, 264 F.3d at \n234).  Here,  through  a  series  of  consent  orders,  the  issue  of  systematic \n24 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 29 of 34 PageID: 3753\novercrowding has been effectively addressed. As set forth at length supra, the jail \npopulation figures are well below the rate capacity and there is a proven system in \nplace to ensure that the population numbers are monitored and actively managed. \nSettlement at this juncture results in a substantial present benefit without the \nrisks and delays of trial and post-trial proceedings. The complexity, expense, and \nlikely duration of continued litigation absent the Settlement all weigh heavily in \nfavor of approval. \n2.  Reaction of the Class \nNotice of the Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) Class Settlement was posted in the \nCamden County Correctional Facility, in the New Jersey Superior Court, Camden \nCounty,  and  on  the  Camden  County  website.  (See  Declaration  of  Howard \nGoldberg, submitted separately). And while the issues facing the inmate population \nat theJ continue to generate inquiries from class members and complaints about jail \nconditions, there have not been any objections to the Settlement. Accordingly, the \nreaction of the Class weighs in favor of approval. \n3.  Stage of the Proceedings and Amount of Discovery \nThe third Girsh factor requires the Court to โconsider the degree of case \ndevelopment that Class Counsel have accomplished prior to Settlement, including \nthe type and amount of discovery already undertaken.โ Merck ERISA, 2010 WL \n547613 at *7 (quoting GM Truck, 55 F.3d at 813). โIn short, under this factor, the \n25 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 30 of 34 PageID: 3754\nCourt  considers  whether  the  amount  of  discovery  completed  in  the  case  has \npermitted โcounsel [to have] an adequate appreciation of the merits of the case \nbefore negotiating.โโ Merck ERISA, 2010 WL 547613, at *7 (alteration in original) \n(quoting In re Prudential Ins. Co. Am. Sales, 148 F.3d 283, 319 (1998). \nPlaintiffs and their counsel โhave an adequate appreciation of the facts in \nthis matter, and this factor weighs in favor of approval.โ Schering-Plough ERISA, \n2012 WL 1964451, at *4; see also Colon v. Passaic City, No. 08-cv-4439, 2012 \nWL  1457764,  at  *4  (D.N.J.  Apr.  24  2012)  (Cavanaugh,  J.)  (โconsidering  the \namount of effort expended by Class Counsel in this matter, as well Class Counselโs \nextensive  experience  litigating  class  actions  โฆ  the  Court  is  convinced  that \nPlaintiffs have a sufficient understanding of the merits of this caseโ). As set forth at \nlength in the preceding sections, the Plaintiffs have a detailed understanding of the \nmerits of this case to support the decision to seek final approval of the Sixth and \nFinal Consent Decree. Class Counsel has been actively involved in this litigation \nfor 12 years.  There can be no doubt that they have an appreciation of the facts in \nthis  case.  The  wealth  of  discovery  conducted  here  more  than  satisfies  the \nreasonably low threshold necessary to grant approval of the Settlement. \nAccordingly, the third Girsh factor also supports approval of the proposed \nSettlement. \n   \n26 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 31 of 34 PageID: 3755\n4.  Significant Obstacles and Risks to Recovery \nFactors four and five address the risks of establishing liability and damages. \nThis factor is not particularly relevant in the analysis of this settlement. Early on in \nthe litigation, the Defendants recognized that overcrowding was a real issue at the \njail and worked cooperatively with Plaintiffs and experts in the field to reduce the \npopulation  at  the  jail  and  to  create  a  system  to  effectively  manage  the  jail \npopulation.  The  litigation did  not seek damages, but  injunctive and declaratory \nrelief. The objectives of the litigation have been achieved and continued litigation \nis not justified. \n5.  Ability of Plaintiffs to Maintain Class Certification \nThis action was one seeking  injunctive  relief. Consequently, the  issue of \nmaintaining class certification is not particularly problematic and was not an issue \nthat impacted the decision to settle. \n6.  Ability of Defendant to Withstand a Greater Judgment \nIn  addressing  the  seventh  Girsh  factor,  the  Court  must  consider  whether \nDefendants  could  withstand  a  judgment  much  greater  than  the  amount  of  the \nsettlement.  Here,  the  Plaintiffs  were  not  seeking  money  damages,  but  rather \ninjunctive relief. This is not a consideration in the decision to settle this litigation. \nThe relief sought was achieved. \n   \n27 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 32 of 34 PageID: 3756\n7.  The Range of Reasonableness of the Settlement Fund in \nLight of the Best Possible Recovery and the Attendant Risks \nof Litigation \nThe final two Girsh factors โevaluate whether the settlement represents a \ngood  value  for  a  weak  case  or  a  poor  value  for  a  strong  case.โ  Schering-\nPlough/Merck Merger, 2010 WL 1257722, at *12 (quoting Warfarin, 391 F.3d at \n538).  A  Court  asked  to  approve  a  settlement  โshould  determine  a  range  of \nreasonable  settlements  in  light  of  the  best  possible  recovery  (the  eighth  Girsh \nfactor), and a range in light of all the attendant risks of litigation (the ninth factor).โ  \nSchering-Plough/Merck  Merger,  2010  WL  1257722,  at  12.  Additionally,  in \nconducting  its  evaluation,  the  Court  should  keep  in  mind  โthat  settlement \nrepresents a compromise in which the highest hopes for recovery are yielded in \nexchange for certainty and resolutionโฆ.โ Johnson & Johnson, 900 F. Supp. 2d \n467, 484-85 (D. N.J. 2012) (internal quotations and citations omitted). It has been \nrecognized  that  โ[t]he  best  possible  recovery,  while  arguably  more  than  the \nsettlement, is tempered by the risks of further litigation.โ United Natโl Ret. Fun v. \nWatts,  No.  04-cv-3603,  2005  WL  2877899,  at  *4  (D.N.J.  Oct.  28,  2003) \n(Cavanaugh, J.). \nThe  Final  Consent  Decree  should  be  approved  because  it  reflects  a \nreasonable assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the claims and the risks \nof establishing liability at trial. Most importantly, however, the final settlement has \n28 \n \n  PHDATA 6013427_1\n\n \nCase 1:05-cv-00063-JBS-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 05/15/17   Page 33 of 34 PageID: 3757\nallowed the parties to seek involvement and voluntary participation of non-parties \nto this litigation. This participation was crucial to the successful implementation of \nthe solutions suggested by Plaintiffsโ experts. Without the settlement in this case, \nthe tremendous and long-term results simply could not have been achieved. \nVI.  CONCLUSION \nThe Final Consent Decree is fair, reasonable and in the best interests of the \nclass  members  and  future  inmates  of  the  Jail.  It  was  the  result  of  formal \nnegotiations  between  the  parties,  with  the  involvement,  support  and \nrecommendation  of  experts  such  as  Luminosity,  Inc.  and  Urban  Engineers. \nImportantly,  this  Final  Consent  Decree  is  consistent  with  the  Prison  Litigation \nReform Actโs requirement that any injunctive relief โbe narrowly drawn, extend no \nfurther than necessary to correct the harm the court find requires the preliminary \nrelief, and be the least intrusive means necessary to correct the harm.โ 18 U.S.C. \nยง 3632(a)(2). For the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiffsโ Motion for Final Approval \nshould be granted. \n \n  s/ Lisa J. Rodriguez       \nLisa J.
