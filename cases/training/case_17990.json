Petitioner Gene Rainbolt is a resident and citizen ofthe State of Oklahoma, and is \none of the named Proponents of Initiative Petition 421, State Question 805. \n3_  Respondent Michael Rogers is the Oklahoma Secretary of State, and is named in \nhis  official  capacity.  Respondent  has  the  authority,  and  obligation,  to  accept \nPetitioner/Proponents'  initiative  petition  for  filing  and  begin  (and  complete)  the  counting \nprocess. See 34 O.S. § 8.  RECEIVED \n\n4.  As explained in the accompanying brief, there is no mechanism for appeal of the \nSecretary's refusal to accept Proponents' initiative petition for filing; thus, there is no adequate \nremedy at law. Furthermore, time is of the essence: according to the State Election Board, all \nmeasures must be finalized by August 19, 2020 in order to be printed on the November general \nelection ballot. Given the number of steps that remain to be completed in the initiative process, \nand the  potential for  delay under current circumstances,  an  original  action  in  this  Court is \nProponents' only available and adequate remedy. \n5.  This application is not filed within ten days of any scheduled trial or hearing date. \nWHEREFORE, Petitioners pray that this Court assume original jurisdiction of this matter \nand issue a writ of mandamus or other appropriate extraordinary relief. \nRespectfully Submitted, \n1y;p,f...;sz,uJe,.;'4 \nD.

Fent v. Contingency Review Bd., 2007 OK 27, \n~11, 163 P.3d 512 (the Court may assume jurisdiction in a publici juris controversy \nwhere there is an urgency and need for a judicial determination).  The extraordinary \nrelief sought by Proponents of Initiative Petition 421, State Question 805  is granted. \n~2  Okla. Con st. Art. 5, § 2 provides that the first power reserved by the people is \nthe initiative.  Respondent's integral role and non-discretionary duties with respect \nto the initiative process are plainly set forth in the Constitution.  Under Okla. Canst. \nArt.  5,  § 3, initiative petitions \"shall be filed with the Secretary of State.\" See also \nOkla. Canst. Art. 5, § 4. When initiative petitions submitting a proposed measure to \nthe people for their ratification or rejection are offered to the Secretary of State for \nfiling, \"it is his duty to file same.\" Threadgill v.  Cross, 1910 OK 165, ~5, 109 P. 558, \n\ndistinguished on other grounds by In re Initiative Petition No.  349, State Question \nNo. 642, 1992 OK 122, 838 P.2d 1 (noting there is no controversy about the nature \nof this duty and there can be none). \n~3  Pursuant to  34  O.S.  Supp.  2015,  §  8(G),  proponents of a referendum  or \ninitiative petition may terminate the circulation period any time during said period by \ncertifying to the Secretary of State (1) the petitions have been filed with the Secretary \nof State, (2) no petitions are in circulation, and (3) proponents will not circulate any \nmore petitions. Proponents have tendered for filing the signed petitions in the instant \ncause.  Therefore, pursuant to the text of the statute, Respondent \"shall begin the \ncounting process.\" /d. \n~4  While the signature-gathering deadline was temporarily halted, or tolled, by \nRespondent on March 18, 2020, with the approval of the Governor under the latter's \nemergency powers pursuant to the statewide CO VI D-19 emergency, this does not \nalter Proponent's statutory rights under 34 O.S. Supp. 2015, § 8(G). The circulation \nperiod began, but it has not ended, and thus we are still within the circulation period. \nIn re Initiative Petition No. 397, State Question No.  767, 2014 OK 23, ~9, 326 P.3d \n496 (goal of statutory construction is to ascertain legislative intent from a plain and \nordinary reading of the statute). \n~5  The Court notes Respondent has expressed concerns that commencing the \nsignature-counting  process  amid  the  COVID-19  Pandemic and  current  state  of \nemergency will present practical difficulties.  There is also the foremost desire and \n2 \n\nduty to protect the safety and welfare of all of those involved in the process. In this \nregard, beginning in mid-March, the Governor issued Executive Orders authorizing \nstate agencies to make necessary emergency acquisitions to fulfill the purpose of \nthe emergency declaration,  and  requiring  the  promulgation  of emergency rules \nnecessary to respond to the emergency. \n~6  Based  on  the  materials  provided,  the  Court  finds  Respondent  has  not \nestablished  the  signature-counting  process cannot be  performed  in  an  efficient \nmanner, while also taking the necessary safety precautions for those involved.  The \nCourt is not convinced Respondent would be unable to procure the tools to carry out \nthe signature-counting  process.  To  this  end,  the  Court notes  Proponents  have \noffered to secure a suitable facility (where social distancing guidelines are more \ncapable of being observed) at their own expense. The duties imposed upon the \nSecretary of State regarding  the  initiative and  referendum  is  ministerial,  and  is \nmandatory. Norris v.  Cross, 1909 OK 316, syll., 105 P.  1000. \n~7  Accordingly, a Writ of Mandamus is hereby issued directing the Respondent \nto accept for filing the signed petitions for Initiative Petition 421, State Question 805, \nwithin ten (1 0) calendar days of this Order, and to thereafter begin and complete the \nsignature-counting process expeditiously. \n~8  DONE  BY ORDER OF  THE SUPREME COURT  IN  CONFERENCE THIS \n/12. \n~ ~ \n26THDAYOFMAY,2020. \nCHIEF JUSTICE \nGurich, C.J., Darby, V.C.J., Kauger, Edmondson, Combs, JJ., concur; \nKane and Rowe, JJ., dissent; \nWinchester, J., not voting; \nColbert, J., not participating. \n3 ",

Citing a prior \nI \ndecision tolling the  signature-circulation period,  however, Respondent,  Secretary of State \nI \nMichael  Rogers, has flatly  refused to  accept Proponents' previously signed petitions for \nfiling. \nI \nThe Secretary's refusal is contrary to both his duties under the governing statute, 34 \nI \nO.S. § 8(G), and the People's fundamental and \"sacred\" right of initiative. Proponents thus \nrespectfully request that the Court assume original jurisdiction and issue a writ of mandamus \nI \nor  other  appropriate  extraordinary  relief,  directing  the  Secretary  to  accept  Proponents' \nI  initiative  petition-signed  by  more  than  260,000  Oklahomans-for  filing  and  timely \ncommence (and complete) the signature-counting process. \nI \nBACKGROUND \nI  In early March of this year, the Proponents of SQ805 were on track to turn in a record \nnumber  of signatures  in  favor  of placing  the  criminal  justice  reform  initiative  on  the \nI \nNovember 2020 ballot. With more than 10% of their circulation period remaining, more than \nI  260,000  Oklahomans  had  already  signed  the  petition  and  exercised  their \"sacred\"  and \n\"precious\" right to \"institute change through the initiative process.\" In re Initiative Petition \nI \nNo. 348, 1991 OK 110, 'i[ 5, 820 P.2d 772,775. \nI \n1 Save the Ill. River, Jnv. v. State ex rei Okla. State Election Bd., 2016 OK 86, 'i[ 6, 378 P.3d \n1220, 1224 (Combs, J. concurring). \nI \nI \n\nI \nI \nAs  this  Court  is  aware,  however,  the  SARS-CoV-2  pandemic  has  upended  the \nI \ninitiative process.  On March  15, 2020, with  II days remaining in  the  90-day circulation \nperiod previously set by the Secretary, Oklahoma's Governor declared a state of emergency. \nI \nThe next morning, Proponents---.;oncerned about the health and  safety of their signature \nI \ncollectors  and  of the  public-temporarily  halted  all  signature  collection  and  filed  an \nemergency motion in this Court, seeking to toll its circulation period. In response, on March \nI \n18, 2020, Secretary Rogers issued a general directive \"toll[ing] the 90-day circulation period \nI \nfor initiative petitions.\" App. Tab A. \nAt the time Proponents sought to toll their signature collection deadline, there was \nI \nhope that the coronavirus outbreak in Oklahoma could be contained, and that the last II days \nI \nof signature collection could be resumed in a timely manner. Now, however, it is clear this \nwill not be the case. Although state agencies and some businesses are beginning to reopen, \nI \nconditions will not soon allow for large-scale  inter-personal circulation of petitions. And \nI \nwhile the \"90-day circulation period for initiative petitions\" has been tolled, App. Tab A, the \nvarious other applicable statutory deadlines-including ballot printing deadlines-have not. \nI \nNor,  of course,  have  the  practicalities  of making  it  through  the  remaining  steps  of \nI \nOklahoma's complex initiative petition process before August  19, 2020-the deadline by \nwhich the Election Board says measures must be finalized for inclusion on the November \nI \ngeneral election ballot? \nI  Later in  March,  then,  SQ805  campaign representatives contacted the Secretary of \nState's office, noting that they may well wish to forego the remainder of their signature-\nI \ncollection period as  provided  in  34  O.S.  § S(G),  and asking how they  could turn  in the \nI \n2 See https://www.ok.gov/elections/documents/2020%20Statutory%20Election%20Dates%20 \nand%20Deadlines.pdf. \nI \n2 \nI \n\nI \nI \nsignatures  that  had  already  been  gathered  so  the  counting  process  could  begin.  The \nI \nSecretary's office responded that, \"[d]ue to the state of emergency and the toll being placed \nI  on all active petitions on record with our office3, and also since our offices are closed to the \npublic, we are unable to accept signature pamphlets for filing.\" App. Tab B. \nI \nCampaign representatives continued to follow up, requesting further details on when \nthe  office  would  reopen  and  how  they  could  turn  in  signatures;  the  Secretary's  office \nI \ncontinued to  demur.  See,  e.g.,  App.  Tab  C.  On  April  22,  2020, however,  the  Governor \nI \nannounced his \"Open Up and Recover Safely (OURS) Plan.\"4 Under that plan, the Governor \ndeclared that, beginning April 24, 2020, numerous organizations and businesses-including \nI \nretail and even personal care businesses, such as hair and nail salons-could safely open on \nI \nan  appointments-only  basis,  so  long  as  employees  and  customers  follow  certain  social-\ndistancing guidelines. !d. \nI \nSince  that time,  representatives  of the  SQ805  campmgn  have  attempted to  work \nI \ncollaboratively with the Secretary's office. They repeatedly requested information about how \nand when they could tum in previously obtained signatures so that signature counting, and \nI \nthe other remaining steps in the initiative petition process, could timely proceed. App. Tab B, \nI  C.  They proposed a number of options to safely deliver sealed boxes of signed petitions \nwithout any personal contact. 5 Id . And they patiently waited while, for weeks, the Secretary \nI \n3 Notably, the order issued by the Secretary of State \"toll[ing] the 90-day circulation period \nI  for  initiative  petitions\" addresses only circulation,  and says nothing  about  filing  already \ncompleted and signed petitions. \n4 https://www.okcommerce.gov/covidl9/ours-plan/. \nI \n5  Sealed boxes of signed initiative petitions have been sitting in a secure storage facility, \nuntouched, for more than a month. Campaign representatives have offered to deliver these \nI  boxes, with no more than two individuals (wearing masks and gloves) to carry them, to any \nsecure  location the  Secretary would  like.  No campaign representative  would  need to  go \nwithin six feet of any state employee. \nI \n3 \nI \n\nI \nI \ncontinued to promise that his office was \"working on its reopening plan\" and would have \nI \n\"more details\" for Proponents \"soon.\" App. Tab C. \nOn Monday, May 4, the Capitol-where the Secretary's executive/legislative office is \nI \nlocated-officially reopened to the public  by appointment6  At 4 p.m.  on May 5,  2020, \nI \nhowever, the Secretary finally made official what Proponents were beginning to suspect: \neven though both the governing statute (34 O.S. § 8) and his tolling letter clearly contemplate \nI \nearly termination of the signature-collection period at Proponents' election; and even though \nI \nsignature tum-in can be accomplished without any person-to-person contact or risk to staff; \nand even though the Governor had declared it safe to conduct public business, the Secretary \nI \nnevertheless would refuse to accept the signed initiative petitions for filing so long as the \nI \nemergency declaration is in place. App. Tab B. \nTime is running short. Deadlines for the November general election ballot are rapidly \nI \napproaching, and until the Secretary accepts the signed petitions, it will not be possible to \nI \ncount the signatures, determine numerical  sufficiency, or commence any post-circulation \nlegal process-all ministerial steps integral to the exercise of \"[t]he first power reserved by \nI \nthe people.\" In re Initiative Petition 403, State Question No.  779, 2016 OK I,~ 3, 367 P.3d \nI  472,  474.  The  Secretary is  not entitled to  simply  refuse to  accept  an  initiative  petition. \nProponents thus respectfully request that the Court issue a writ of mandamus compelling \nI \nSecretary  Rogers  to  accept  and  file  their  signed  petitions,  and  timely  commence  (and \nI  complete) the signature-counting process. \nI \nI \n6 https://www.normantranscript.com/news/oklahoma!state-capitol-to-reopen-topublic/article_  \n8a33ad78-dbd l-5d8f-9e ll-6160a9c913 83 .html. \nI \n4 \nI \n\nI \nI \nARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY \nI \nI.  This Court Should Assume Original Jurisdiction \nWhen the People of Oklahoma and the Oklahoma Legislature empowered this Court \nI \nto assume original jurisdiction and compel performance of ministerial duty, they did so to \nI \nsafeguard against circumstances where, as here, a fundamental right is at risk; those persons \ntasked with carrying it out have not performed; and the remedy must come quickly. Okla. \nI \nConst. Art. VII,§ 4; 12 O.S. § 1451; cf Okla. Const. Art. V, § 2 (\"first power reserved by the \nI  people is the initiative\"). Indeed, mandamus is an appropriate intervention where \"there is: \n(I) a clear legal right vested in the petitioner; (2) a refusal to perform a plain legal duty which \nI \ndoes not involve the exercise of discretion; and (3) [] inadequacy of other relief.\" Price v. Bd. \nI  ofCty. Comm'rs of Pawnee Cty., 2016 OK 16, ~ 6, 371 P.3d 1089, 1091; State ex rei. Dep't \nof Transp.  v. Post, 2005 OK 69, ~ 2 n.1, 125 P .3d 1183, 1185 n.1; State ex rei. Indep. Sch \nI \nDis!. No.1 v. Barnes, 1988 OK 70, ~ 18,762 P.2d 921,923. \nI  Because the \"people's right to institute change through [] initiative[] is a fundamental \ncharacteristic of Oklahoma government,\" In re Initiative Petition No.  360, 1994 OK 97, ~ 9, \nI \n879 P .2d 810, 814, there is no question here of right. Mandamus has thus long been used to \nI  compel performance of ministerial duties associated with the initiative petition process. See \nNorris v.  Cross,  1909 OK 316, 105 P.  1000, 1000 (\"The duties of the Secretary of State to \nI \nfile referendum petitions when presented to him ... are purely ministerial; and, upon refusal \nI  to perform same, he may be compelled to do so by mandamus.\"); see also. e.g., App. Tab D \n(article about episode where Court ordered a different Secretary Rogers to open his office to \nI \naccept the filing of a different petition); Black v.  Wood,  1952 OK 276, ~~ 14-15, 249 P.2d \n699,  701  (writ of mandamus  appropriate to  compel  town  clerk to  publish  notice  of an \nI \ninitiative petition); Threadgill v.  Cross,  1910 OK 165,  109 P.  558,  559--60, overruled on \nI \n5 \nI \n\nI \nI \nother grounds by,  In  re Initiative  Petition No.  349,  !992 OK  122,  838  P.2d  I  (writ of \nI \nmandamus appropriate to compel Secretary of State to submit initiative petition to a vote of \nthe People). \nI \nOriginal jurisdiction is further appropriate here because this matter inherently affects \nI \nnot only public right, but also public interest. See, e.g., State ex rei. Nesbitt v. Ford, 1967 OK \n186, ~ 9, 434 P.2d 934, 937 (\"This court is authorized to and may take original jurisdiction \nI \nand  issue  writs  of mandamus  .  . . to  executive  officers  commanding  them  to  perform \nI \nministerial duties where the question raised is publici juris\"). In less than three months, well \nover 250,000 Oklahomans  signed  petitions declaring their intent to  place  this  important \nI \ncriminal justice reform  measure  on the ballot.  The People have  a substantial  interest in \nI \nensuring that their will is able to be heard, and that their \"sacred\" right of initiative petition is \nnot thwarted by the refusal of officials to perform their legal duties. \nI \nII.  The Secretary Must Accept Submission of IP421 \nI \n\"A  writ  will  issue  when the  action  sought to  be  compelled  is  purely  ministerial \nbecause the officer or board, when properly requested to do so, has a mandatory duty to act \nI \nthat stands imposed by law.\" Morton v. Adair Cty. Excise Bd., 1989 OK 174, ~ 4, 780 P.2d \nI  707, 709. Here, the Secretary's duty to accept submission of signed initiative petitions is \nministerial, and not only legally but also constitutionally mandatory. It is therefore subject to \nI \nmandamus. \nI  First, the Oklahoma Constitution unambiguously provides that \"[p] etitions ... for the \ninitiative and for the referendum shall be filed with the Secretary of State.\" Okla. Canst. Art. \nI \nV,  § 3 (emphasis added). The relevant executing provision likewise provides that, \"[w]hen \nI  the signed copies of a petition are timely filed, the Secretary of State shall file a copy of the \nproponent's ballot title with the Attorney General, and after conducting a count of the filed, \nI \n6 \nI \n\nI \nI \nsigned petition, the  Secretary of State shall certify\" the number of signatures counted.  34 \nI \nO.S. § 8(H) (emphasis added). The statute also makes clear that the proponents of a petition \n\"may terminate the circulation period any time during the ninety-day circulation period by \nI \ncertifying to the Secretary of State\" that they have ceased circulation and all petitions have \nI \nbeen filed.  34 O.S. § 8(G). \"If the Secretary of State receives such a certification from the \nproponents, the Secretary of State shall begin the counting process.\" !d. (emphasis addedd). \nI \nThe People and  Legislature's use  of the world \"shall\" in regard to the Secretary's \nI \nduties  indicates that he  lacks discretion as to  whether or not to  accept and  count signed \npetitions. Cf, e.g., Velasco v.  Ruiz, 2019 OK 46, '1]9, 457 P.3d 1014, 1017-18; Okla.  Pub. \nI \nEmployees Ass 'n v.  State ex rei.  Okla.  Office of Pers.  Mgmt., 2011  OK 68, '11'11  13-14, n.18, \nI \n267 P.3d 838, 845; N. Coltrane Cmty. Ass'n. Inc. v. Bd. o.fCty. Comm'rs of Okla. City, 2019 \nOK CIV APP 72, '1]'1]31-33, 453 P.3d 913,922. If the Secretary refuses to perform his \"plain \nI \nlegal duty,\" a writ of mandamus is both necessary and appropriate. Ibid.; Price, 2016 OK 16, \nI \nat '1]6. \nSecond, the passive declaration that signed initiative petitions \"shall be submitted\" to \nI \nthe Secretary, Okla. Const. Art. V, § 3, reinforces that the duty to accept signed petitions is a \nI  ministerial act. E.g., Russell v. Harrison, 1912 OK 443, 124 P. 762,763 (Secretary of State's \ninitiative petition duties are generally without discretion). Here again, the \"ministerial 'shall' \nI \ndiffers from the discretionary 'may' where the law describes the duty to be performed such \nI  that ... no exercise of discretion necessary.\" N.  Coltrane, 2019 OK CIV APP 72, at 'I] 31. \nThere are not varying degrees to which the Secretary can fulfill the duty at issue: he either \nI \naccepts submission of signed petitions, or he does not. This binary execution of a mandatory \n,I  duty is akin to issuance of a permit. Just as \"[w]hen an applicant has complied with all [] \nI \n7 \nI \n\nI \nI \nprovisions of the statue, issuance of [a] permit is a purely ministerial act,\" Bozarth, McCord \nI \n& McCrary v.  Okla. Dep't ofTransp., 1991 OK CIV APP 30, 812 P.2d 815, 816, so \"when \nthe signed copies\" of a petition are ready, they may be \"timely filed\" with the Secretary of \nI \nState who \"shall\" count them. 34 O.S. § 8 (H). \nI \nThird, a \"writ of mandamus\" is generally appropriate to compel the Secretary \"to act \nupon [an] initiative petition and determine the sufficiency thereof.\" In re Initiative Petition \nI \nNo.  2 of Cushing, 1932 OK 124, 10 P.2d 271, 274. Accepting signed petitions is not only \nI \nintegral to acting upon a petition, but also a clear statutory predicate for \"conducting a count \nof the filed, signed petition\" to determine sufficiency. 34 O.S. § S(H). And, given that the \nI \nSecretary has both a statutory and constitutional \"fixed duty\" to accept submission of signed \nI \npetitions,  it  is  particularly appropriate  for this  Court to  take  \"action to  require  [him]  to \nperform that duty.\" In re Initiative Petition No.  260, State Question No.  377, 1956 OK 196, \nI \n298 P.2d 753, 756; see also Blackv. Wood, 1952 OK 276, at'\\['\\[ 14-15. \nI \nLast, mandating acceptance of signed initiative petitions to preserve timely exercise \nof right accords not only with this Court's role in requiring an official \"to perform an official \nI \nact,\" Price, 2016 OK 16, at'\\[ 6, but also this Court's efforts to guard the People's right to \nI  initiative. E.g.,  Okla.  Oil & Gas Ass'n v.  Thompson, 2018 OK 26, '\\[ 4, 424 P.3d 345, 347. It \nis unclear when and if life will return to normal.7 It is likewise unclear just how long it will \nI \ntake to count signatures and process any subsequent protests. But the fact that more than \nI  260,000  Oklahomans  have  already  asked  for  a  vote  on  SQ805--<Iespite  the  shortened \ncirculation period-shows that Proponents must be allowed to further the initiative process in \nI \n7 This is, of course, why Proponents now wish to have their signed petitions counted; even if \nI  the State partially reopens, there is no guarantee that circulators will be able to go door-to \ndoor with any semblance of success. People are understandably scared of close person-to \nperson contact. Cf In re Initiative Petition No. 347, 1991 OK 55, 813 P.2d 1019, I 034. \nI \n8 \nI \n\nI \nI \nthe only way that they can: by submitting their signed petitions for counting, as guaranteed \nI \nby the Oklahoma Constitution. \nOn this note, a writ of mandamus requiring the Secretary to accept submission of \nI \nProponent's  signed petitions does  not conflict with either the  Governor's  declaration  of \nI \nemergency  or  this  Court's  own  emergency  orders.  The  latter  are  explicitly  subject to \nconstitutional limitations, and do not prevent early tum-in in any event. And the former in no \nI \nway precludes the filing of petitions-and in any event has recently shifted substantially in \nI \nconjunction with the \"OURS\" plan, which allowed, inter alia, restaurants, retail, and hair and \nnail salons to reopen. It logically follows that an eminently essential government service-\nI \none needed to discharge ministerial duty and protect the People's first right-should reopen \nI \non a limited basis as well. \nProponents are,  of course, aware that they have  previously urged caution when it \nI \ncomes to submission of signed petitions. They stand by the need for caution, and will ensure \nI  that submission involves proper use of personal protective equipment and is as \"contactless\" \nas possible. Nevertheless, Proponents have a right to file their petition, and exercise the \"first \niI  l \npower reserved by the people\"-the \"precious\" right of initiative. Okla. Canst. Art. V, § 2; In \nI  re !nit. Pet. No. 348, 1991 OK 110, ~5, 820 P.2d 772. The Secretary should not be permitted \nto \"cripple\" this fundamental right simply by refusing to unlock his doors.
