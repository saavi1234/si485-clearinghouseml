    "summary": "<p>This case was about the constitutionality of the Governor of Oregon&rsquo;s COVID-19 executive orders and the signature requirements for ballot initiatives for the 2020 general election. The plaintiff, an Oregon registered voter and president of an Oregon nonprofit organization, &ldquo;Move Oregon&rsquo;s Border,&rdquo; filed this complaint pro se in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon on June 30, 2020, against the Governor and Secretary of State of Oregon, in addition to seventeen county clerks in the state. The plaintiff sued under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, arguing that the state&rsquo;s laws requiring large numbers of in-person signatures, combined with COVID-19 and the Governor&rsquo;s orders regarding the pandemic, amounted to a violation of the plaintiff&rsquo;s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff stated that the state&rsquo;s ballot-access requirements violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights by imposing a burden on his ability to advocate for ballot initiatives and by limiting his ability to earn a place for his nonprofit organization&rsquo;s ballot initiatives on the 2020 ballot. The plaintiff also stated that Oregon&rsquo;s ballot-access requirements violated his rights under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiff requested preliminary and permanent relief prohibiting the enforcement of state and local laws mandating a minimum number of signatures for verification, qualification, and certification of county ballot initiatives in Oregon for the November 2020 election. The plaintiff also requested that the court direct the defendants to certify as a county measure for the election ballot any petitions that had been filed by an agent of Move Oregon&rsquo;s Border approved by August 5, 2020, without requiring the signatures from voters. The plaintiff also asked for a declaration that Oregon&rsquo;s signature requirements for the qualification of county ballot initiatives are unconstitutional as applied during the COVID-19 pandemic and the stay-at-home executive orders. The case was assigned to Judge Michael J. McShane.</p>\r\n<p>On July 6, 2020, the plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order. On July 20, the court denied the motion for preliminary relief. 2020 WL 4059698. The court first pointed out that the requested relief relates to Move Oregon&rsquo;s Border, rather than the plaintiff individually. The court also noted that the plaintiff did not appear to be a licensed attorney and therefore could not represent Move Oregon&rsquo;s Border in the proceeding. Putting this issue aside, the court also found that the plaintiff&rsquo;s failure to demonstrate reasonable diligence in collecting the required signatures showed that he was not likely to succeed on the merits of his claim.</p>\r\n<p>The court stated that the right to petition the government is at the core of the First Amendment&rsquo;s protections, which includes the right to present ballot initiatives. The court stated that restrictions on the initiative process will be found to burden political speech if: (1) the regulations restrict one-on-one communication between petition circulators and voters; or (2) the regulations make it less likely that proponents can obtain the necessary signatures to place the initiatives on the ballot. If the court decides that the restrictions burden political speech, the next step is to decide which level of scrutiny to apply to the restrictions. The court stated that it applies strict scrutiny when: (1) the proponents of the initiative have been reasonably diligent as compared to other initiative proponents; and (2) when the restrictions significantly inhibit the proponents&rsquo; ability to place an initiative on the ballot. However, if the plaintiff fails to meet either of these prongs, the court will apply a lesser form of scrutiny. Here, the court found that the plaintiff had not described steps taken to gather signatures and therefore failed to show reasonable diligence compared with other initiative proponents and therefore applied rational basis review. Finding that the defendants had a significant regulatory interest in maintaining the initiative requirements and ensuring that each initiative had sufficient support in order to be placed on the ballot, the court concluded that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate likelihood of success on the merits and denied the requested preliminary relief.</p>\r\n<p>On July 22, the plaintiff filed another motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiff argued that he should not need to show that he is more diligent than other initiative proponents but rather that his petitions are attractive enough to the people of Oregon that they would have gained all of the required signatures under normal conditions. In the alternative, the plaintiff requested that the number of signatures required be lowered to one fifth of the normal requirement based on the obstacles posed by the pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>In early August 2020, three of the defendants filed motions to dismiss the case. On August 19, Judge McShane issued a scheduling order again highlighting the fact that the plaintiff appeared to be suing on behalf of Move Oregon&rsquo;s Border and that the plaintiff did not appear to be a licensed attorney. Judge McShane stated that the action would be dismissed unless the organization filed a notice of representation by a licensed attorney within 14 days and stayed all pending motions until the filing of the notice. On September 17, 2020, the court dismissed the case without prejudice due to Move Oregon&rsquo;s Border&rsquo;s failure to file a notice of representation by a licensed attorney. The case is now closed.</p>",

Each division of the District of Oregon contains workplaces for some of the Defendants. The \nUS District court at Eugene is more centrally located than other US District courts in light of the \nplaces of work of the Defendants. More federal judges work in  that court than in Medford or \nPendleton. \nPARTIES \n5.  Plaintiff Michael  R.  McCarter,  an  Oregon  registered  voter, Oregon  resident, and  \"chief \npetitioner\" (filer) of county ballot initiatives in multiple counties of Oregon, brings this complaint \nprose in his official capacity as president of a 50 I (c)4 named Move Oregon ·s Border, against \nDefendants.  Move Oregon's Border  is registered with the office of the Secretary of State of \nOregon. \n6. Governor Kate Brown is named as a defendant in her official capacity as Governor of Oregon. \n7. Bev Clarno is named as a defendant in her official capacity as Secretary of State. The Oregon \nSecretary of State is the chief elections officer of the State of Oregon. \n8. The following Defendants are sued in their official capacities as chief elections officials of their \nrespective counties. Chief election officials are responsible for implementing ce1tain state and local \nelection laws.  With  respect to county ballot initiatives, their responsibilities include verifying \nsignatures, determining whether initiatives qualify to be on the ballot, and certifying them as \ncounty measures. \n9. Defendant Stefanie Kirby is sued in her official capacity as Baker County Clerk. \n10. Defendant Cheryl Seely is sued in her official capacity as Crook County Clerk. \n11. Defendant Renee' Kolen is sued in her official capacity as Curry County Clerk. \n12. Defendant Daniel Loomis is sued in his official capacity as Douglas County Clerk. \n13.

Church is sued in her official capacity as Union County Clerk. \n25. Defendant Sandy Lathrop is sued in her official capacity as Wallowa County Clerk. \nURGENCY AND NATURE OF THE CASE \n26. The urgency ofthis matter is related to the August 5, 2020 deadline for signatures for qualifying \nfor the 2020 general election. \n27. This is an action to declare unconstitutional, enjoin, and/or modify the combination of the \nGovernor's COVID-19-rclated executive orders with the requirement in state and/or local law for \na threshold  (minimum  number)  of signatures  for county  ballot  initiatives  to qualify  for  the \nNovember 3, 2020 ballot. \nFACTS \n28. Move Oregon's Border did not file a statewide prospective petition.  Move Oregon's Border \nfiled a distinct prospective petition in each county listed below. To qualify for and appear on the \nCOMPLAINT  4 \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 1    Filed 06/30/20    Page 5 of 19\nNovember 3, 2020 ballot in a county, a \"chief petitioner\" must present signed petitions to a county \nclerk's office ( or the designated county elections official's office) on or before August 5 according \nto the state's County, City, and District !nitiativ<:' and Referendum Manual (page 6). 1 According to \nthis manual, by Oregon law, the signing of the petition must be witnessed, in person, by a signature \ncollector. \n29. According to ORS 250.205(4), \"A petition to initiate a county measure must contain at least \nthe number of signatures of electors residing in the county equal to six percent of the total number \nof votes cast in the county for all candidates for Governor. .. \" Although this law applies to non \nhome rule counties, the state's County, City, and District initiative and Referendum Manual (page \n5) indicates that this number (6%) is the same for all Oregon counties.  This implies that county \nordinances or charters have  imposed  this requirement  in  home-rule counties, or at  least not \nmodified the state requirement. \n30. The number of signatures required in 2020 in each relevant county is given in the paragraph \nbelow, based on the calculation specified in the paragraph above. In some cases the actual number \nis one less than the number given due to rounding ambiguity.  There may be cases, unknown to \nthe Plaintiff, in which the number below may be slightly off if there were errors in reporting. \n31. The Move Oregon's Border political movement did not have the capability to begin collecting \nsignatures earlier than it did. This Plaintiffs 501 (c)4 Move Oregon's Border was founded in \nresponse to an analysis that was published April  16, 2019.2  After a sizable number of citizens \nheard about and embraced the analysis, a decision to write a prospective petition was made.

Plaintiff filed \nprospective petitions  in  each county (except  Klamath County)  in  January 2020, but counties \nrejected various fo1111s ( versions) of early prospective petitions- in some cases, 7 different versions. \nA prospective petition from Move Oregon's Border was finally approved by a county clerk for \ncirculation on the dates listed below (the actual date might have been the previous business day). \nFor later filings, where required, the plaintiff recruited locals to be the chief petitioners for their \ncounty, as noted below: \nDouglas County: February 28, 2020, 2955 signatures required. \nUmatilla County: March 3,202, 1447 signatures required.

Approval to circulate will be pending a new case in the same \ncourt to be filed by July 6, 2020.  Move Oregon's Border filed a revised prospective petition with \nthe Crook County Clerk on June 26, 2020. 693 signatures required. Chief petitioner: Shawn Cross. \n32. In this case, the \"relevant counties\" and \"the counties concerned\" will generally refer to the \nseventeen counties listed above.  None of Move Oregon's Border's prospective petitions were \napproved for circulation in Coos, Wheeler, and Gilliam counties. \n33. Although the required signature count in some counties may seem insignificant in number, the \nsmall and scattered population of these counties and the small number of volunteers in these \ncounties makes them equally challenging in con,parison to more populous counties. \n34. Citizens' fear of contracting SARS-Co V-2 (COVID-19) makes gathering their signatures more \ndifficult, and few volunteers were willing to take the risk to themselves. There is a fear that the \nclipboard and pen may be covered by viruses. \n35. On March 12, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 20-053 \"prohibiting large social, \nspiritual, and recreational gatherings of 250 people or more, statewide.\"  She \"also announced a \nstatewide closure of Oregon K-12 schools from March 16, 2020.\" (This quote is from executive \norder 20-104).  Closing schools made it harder for parents to find time to gather signatures. \n3 https://www.oregon.gov/gov/Documents/executi ve_  orders/eo_  20-05.pdf \n4 https://www.oregon.gov/gov/Documents/executive_ orders/eo_ 20-I 0.pdf \nCOMPLAINT  7 \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 1    Filed 06/30/20    Page 8 of 19\n36. On March 17, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 20-075 \"prohibiting social, spiritual, \nand recreational gatherings of 25 people or more.\"  The duration of this order was extended by \nExecutive Order 20-14. \n37. On March 23, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 20-126 entitled \"Stay Home, Save \nLives.\" This stay-at-home order states: \nI am ordering the following: \na. Non-essential social and recreational gatherings of individuals outside of a home or place \nof residence ... arc prohibited immediately, regardless of size, if a distance of at least six \nfeel between individuals cannot be maintained. \nb.  Individuals  are  prohibited  from  patronizing businesses that are  closed  pursuant to \nparagraph 2 of this Executive Order, and from engaging in conduct prohibited by prior \nExecutive Orders or inconsistent with guidance provided by the Oregon Health Authority. \nThe Oregon Health Authority guidance in general was discouraging of actions that would be \nexpected to spread the virus, such as sharing a pen or a piece of paper, which is normally necessary \nin collecting signatures.  More poignantly, it is impossible to hand someone a pen and a clip board \nfrom a distance of six feet. The enforcement of the signature requirement, on those wishing to \nexercise The People's ballot initiative rights, is unconstitutional because it imposes a signature \nrequirement on Move Oregon's Border that these executive orders made unachievable for a group \nthat needed to campaign during Spring/Summer 2020. \n38. Executive Order 20-12 continues \"c. when individuals need to leave their homes or residences, \nthey should at all times maintain social distancing ofat least six feet from any person who is not a \nmember of their immediate household ... Any person found to be in  violation of this Executive \n5 https://www.oregon.gov/gov/Documents/executi vc_  ordcrs/eo_  20-07. pdf \n6 https://www.oregon.gov/gov/Docurnents/executive_  orders/eo_  20-l 2.pdf \nCOMPLAINT  8 \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 1    Filed 06/30/20    Page 9 of 19\nOrder is subject to the penalties described in ORS 401.990\". This executive order, under color of \nlaw, also ordered the closure of\"non-essential businesses\". \n39. On March 23, 2020, Move Oregon's Border posted a Facebook post criticizing Gov. Brown's \nexecutive orders for exceeding the authority given the Governor by law.7  The Facebook post was \nquoted  and  linked  by  The  Oregonian, the  newspaper of greatest  circulation  in  Oregon.  The \nOregonian  printed, \"The grqµp' s  Face book p~g~  cha II eng es the  governor's social-distancing \nmeasures, arguing that  Brown's authority even  in  an  emergency doesn't extend  to  'literally \noutlawing dating and socializing (within 6 feet of another person).\"'8  However, Defendants did \nnot accommodate the rights of Plaintiff to ballot access, or reduce the 6% signature requirement, \nand the 6-foot rule remains a part of executive orders applicable to each county of Oregon to the \npresent day. Plaintiff also emailed a request for relief to each Defendant on June 30, 2020. \n40. Beginning May 15, 2020, the counties relevant to this case were moved to \"Phase I\" per the \nGovernor's  Executive  Order 20-25. 9  This  order stated  \"All  cultural,  civil, and  faith-based \ngatherings of more than 25 people are prohibited.  Cultural, civic, and faith-based gatherings of25 \nor fewer people are allowed only  if a distance of six (6)  feet can  be consistently maintained \nbetween individuals from different households ...\"   However, it also stated, \"Stay Home, Save \nLives:. .. It is essential. .. that individuals continue to stay at or near their home or place of residence, \nwhenever possible ... I am ordering ... c. When individuals leave their home or place of residence, \n7 https://www.facebook.com/groups/Greaterldaho/permal ink/5 12517262746202/ \n8 https://www .oregon Ii ve.c om/po Ii ti cs/2020/03/effort-to-move-eastern-oregon-to-idaho-m u ffled \nby-stay-at-home-order-coronav irus-response-further-d iv ides-rural-u rban-oregon ians-petitioner-\nsays.h  tm 1 \n9 https://www.oregon.gov/gov/Documents/executive_ orders/ea_2 0-25. pdf \nCOMPLAI  T  9 \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 1    Filed 06/30/20    Page 10 of 19\nthey should maintain physical distancing of six ( 6) feet from any person who is not a member of \ntheir household ... \" \n41. On June 5, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 20-27, 10 which allows some counties \nto move to \"Phase 11''. Currently, all the relevant counties are in Phase II, having entered Phase II \non June 5 or June 6. The only exception is Union County, which returned to Phase I on June 16 or \n17 from Phase II, due to an outbreak of COVID-19. According to Executive Order 20-07, in \ncounties in phase II, \"individuals may gather for any purpose in groups of up to 50 in indoor spaces, \nor up to  I 00 in outdoor spaces, so long as they maintain physical distancing of at least six feet \nbetween individuals who are not from the same household.\"  The order also states: \"Subsequent \nTransitions. It is my expectation that neither the state nor any county may transition from Phase II \nto  Phase  II unless and until widely available and  effective therapeutics or a vaccine become \navailable ... \" \n42. Gathering signatures is not defined as an essential activity under any of the Governor's \"Stay \nHome, Save Lives\" orders.  The public-health emergency caused by COVID-19 and the various \norders issued by the Governor under color of law make it apparently unlawful and practically \nimpossible to gather petition signatures in these counties.  Even during Phase II, the Governor \nrequires this distance of six feet to be maintained. lt is impossible to politely throw someone a pen \nand a clip board from a distance of six feet.  Presumably, even hands of different individuals must \nbe kept six feet apart, since hands themselves arc considered to be a part ofan individual's person. \n43. The COY ID-19 pandemic reduced the number of people who ventured out of their houses for \ncasual reasons, who might have been found on public property where signatures may be gathered. \n1O  hups://www.oregon.gov/gov/Documcnts/cxecutivc_  orders/eo _ 20-27 .pdf \nCOMPLAINT  10 \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 1    Filed 06/30/20    Page 11 of 19\n44. Move Oregon's Border held a rally in Roseburg on March 7, 2020 in which approximately 500 \npeople attended, 11 and 389 signatures were collected.  Rallies were the main strategy of this group \nfor signature collection, but had to be abandoned because of the Governor's orders.  The prime \nvenues for collection of petition signatures historically have been large gatherings, such as county \nfairs, festivals, and sporting events during warm summer months.  None of these were permitted \nthis summer by the Governor's executive orders. Few events occur on public property in the winter, \nespecially in these rural counties, where the passability of roads is not predictable on account of \nthe possibility of storms. Also, the Governor ordered universities closed.  Move Oregon's Border \nhas not collected the required number of signatures in any county as of the date of this filing, even \nthough it has 9195 members in its largest single-issue Facebook group12 and has been featured on \nCNN, 13  Fox  News,  ABC, 14  CBS, NBC,  the  Washington  Post, 15  etc,  and  welcomed by the \nGovernor of ldaho16 and many state legislators. \n45. Because of the  Governor's  orders  issued  this  year,  and  the  public  health  concerns,  in \ncombination with the requirements of Oregon ballot initiative law, it has become impossible this \nsummer for The People of a county to exercise their right under the Oregon Constitution to exercise \nthe legislative power directly through ballot initiatives. The Governor's March 23, 2020 executive \norder was issued more than four months before the actual due date of August 5.

On or about March 20, 2020, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order \ntemporarily modifying the signature requirements for ballot access such that candidates will only \nneed to collect 30 percent of the statutory threshold. It also extended deadlines for New Yorkers \nto register to vote absentee.  The Governor of Oregon has shown a willingness to take decisive \naction via executive order, but has neglected to  issue an executive order to cease or relax the \nenforcement of the signature requirement required to qualify for the ballot. \n47. Elsewhere this year, federal judges have issued injunctions to reduce the number of signatures \nrequired by states to qualify for the ballot.  In the US District Court for the Northern District of \nIllinois, the signatures required for ballot access was reduced to I 0% of the statutory number.  fn \naddition,  the  state's in-person  signature requirement was  enjoined  from  having  effect.  The \nrequirement that an \"independent candidate must file 'original sheets which have been signed by \nthe  voters  and  by the  circulator, and  not  photocopies  or duplicates  of such  sheets'  is  also \nenjoined.\"17  The Governor of Illinois' request for a stay of this injunction was denied by the US \nCourt of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on June 21, 2020. 18 \n48. In the US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, the state was required to reduce \nthe  threshold  for  qualifying to  50% of the  signatures, and  extend  the  deadline, and  permit \nsignatures by electronic mail, finding that \"the State's actions in the form of enforcing both the \nStay-at-Home Order and the statutory ballot-access requirements operate in tandem to impose a \n17 lHJJ2.:~c ( lcarrngl11.lUSC .net sl:D)ocs.pub lie.

Esshaki v. Whitmer, No. 2:20-cv-l 083 1-TGB, 2020 WL 1910154, \nat* l (E.D. Mich. Apr. 20, 2020). The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed in part \nthe injunction, agreeing that the state may not enforce its ballot access provisions as-is, but stayed \nthe over-specificity of the injunction.  There was dissent against this stay. 19 \n49. In  the US  District Court for the District of Utah, the state's signature requirements were \nreduced by 32%20 and an appeal was voluntarily dismissed.21  In the US District Court for the \nDistrict of Maryland, the state's signature requirements were reduced from 10,000 to a mere 5,000 \nfor statewide races 22 \n50. By law, the State of Oregon requires that electronic signatures to be accepted as legal signatures \nin many situations of legal importance. \n51.  Many states  have  implemented  on line  petitioning,  especially  in  light of the COVID-I 9 \npandemic.  For  example,  see  ARIZONA  SECRETARY  OF  STATE:  CITIZEN  CLEAN \nELECTfONS COMMISSSlON, WELCOME TO E-QUALn \"In Arizona, candidates are required \nto obtain a minimum number of petition signatures to appear on a ballot. Voters interested in \nassisting Statewide and Legislative  candidates can  now  sign  a petition  electronically.\"  New \nJersey's governor on  March  19, 2020 by executive order implemented online petitioning and \nsignature collection for candidates in response to the coronavirus pandemic. See EXECUTIVE \nORDER NO.

The state should not claim that reducing the signature count threshold will lead to an ungainly \nnumber of ballot initiatives on the ballot, because the number of days remaining before the August \n5 deadline is relatively small. It is so small that it will not present an opportunity to new entrants. \nIn our experience (described above), it takes one to six months to get permission to circulate. Even \nafter a prospective petition has been drafted that will meet the standards of a specific county clerk, \nthe typical county government will take four weeks to issue an approval to circulate the petition. \nThe reason it takes four weeks is explained as follows. By law, the county clerk has 5 full business \ndays following the day of filing of a prospective petition to determine whether it meets Oregon's \nconstitutional standards. Then she files it with the district attorney, who has five full business days \nfollowing the day of that filing to file the ballot title.  Then there is a required waiting period of \nseven full business days following the day that the ballot title was filed.  Then the petitioner must \nwait an indeterminate period for the clerk to approve the signature sheets. (cf. the state's County, \nCity. and District Initiative and Referendum Manual). \n53. County ballot initiative signature campaigns must be completed within two years of a county \nclerk's approval to circulate a petition, except in Jackson County, where the time limit is one year. \nVery few county ballot initiatives have been approved to circulate in Oregon within the last two \nyears, so the ballot wi 11 not be flooded with old ballot measures if the Court chooses to reduce the \nsignature threshold. \n54. Reducing the number of signatures required may reduce the spread of viruses. Conversely, the \nmore signatures we are required to collect, the more our contact with  other citizens may be \nspreading the virus. \nCOMPLAJNT  14 \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 1    Filed 06/30/20    Page 15 of 19\n55. Libertarian Party of Ohio v Husted, 75 I F3d 403,412 (CA 6, 2014) remarks that \"even minimal \ninfringement upon First Amendment values constitutes  irreparable  injury sufficient to justify \ninjunctive relief'.  Additionally, \"it is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a \nparty's constitutional rights.\" Libertarian Party of Ohio, 75 l F3d at 412 \n56. Consider the effect of the executive orders limiting the maximum size of physical meetings, \nand keeping people six feet apart. \"It is beyond debate that freedom to engage in association for \nthe advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the 'liberty' assured by the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which embraces freedom of speech.\" NAACP v. \nAlabama, 357 U.S. 449, 460 (1958). \n57. The Supreme Court made clear that, \"whether the beliefs sought to be advanced by association \npertain to political, economic, religious or cultural matters ... state action which may have the effect \nof curtailing the freedom to associate is subject to the closest scrutiny\" Id. at 460-46 l. \n58. \"The right to voluntary association ... is an important aspect of the First Amendment freedom\" \nthat the Supreme Court \"has consistently found entitled to constitutional protection.\" Lefkowitz v. \nCunningham, 431 U.S. 80 I, 808 ( 1977). \n59. \"[Ballot]  access  restrictions  also  implicate the right to vote  because, absent  recourse  to \nreferendums, voters can assert their preferences only through candidates or parties or both.\" Illinois \nState Board of Elections v.

Plaintiffs  injuries are fairly  traceable to  the  Oregon  laws  requiring  rn  person signature \ncollection in great quantity, the coronavirus pandemic, and the Governor's orders described in this \naction. \n63.  This Court has  the  power to  properly redress Plaintiffs injuries  by issuing prospective \ninjunctive and declaratory relief prohibiting enforcement of state and local laws mandating a \nminimum number of signatures for verification, qualification, and certification of county ballot \ninitiatives for the November 3, 2020 general election in the relevant counties. \n64. This Court may properly redress Plaintiffs' injuries by directing Defendants to verify, qualify, \nand certify as a county measure for the November 3, 2020 ballot any petitions that have been filed \nby an agent of Move Oregon's Border and approved for circulation by August 5, 2020 by the chief \nelections official of their county, without requiring the signatures from voters otherwise required \nby Oregon law. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nFIRST AMENDMENT \n65. All previous paragraphs and allegations arc incorporated herein. \n66. Under present circumstances, in combination with the Governor's executive orders, Oregon's \nballot-access requirements violate rights guaranteed to this Plaintiff by the First and Fou1ieenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution, as enforced through 42  U.S.C.  § 1983.  They \nimpose a severe burden on Plaintiffs First Amendment rights by impeding his ability to advocate \nfor  ballot  initiatives  in  person  and  by  limiting  his  ability  to  actually  earn  a  place  for  his \norganization's ballot initiatives on the November 3 ballot. Moreover, the six-foot rule burdens \nFirst-Amendment freedom of association. Due to these severe burdens, strict scrutiny applies to \nthe challenged restrictions Angle v.

Plaintiffs are suffering irreparable harm as a result of the violations complained of herein, and \nthat harm will continue unless declared unlawful and enjoined by this Court. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nFOURTEENTH AMENDMENT EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE \n70. All previous paragraphs and allegations arc incorporated herein. \n71. Under present circumstances, Oregon's ballot-access requirements violate rights guaranteed to \nthis Plaintiff by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution, as enforced through 42 U.S.C. § l 983. \n72. A real and actual controversy exists between the parties. \n73. Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law other than this action for declaratory and equitable \nrelief. \n74.

OPINION AND ORDER \n                 \nKATE BROWN, in her official capacity as \nGovernor of Oregon, et al. \n                 \n    Defendants.           \n_____________________________        \n     \nMCSHANE, Judge: \n  Plaintiff Michael McCarter, proceeding pro se “in his official capacity as president of \nMove Oregon’s Border,” moves for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction \nprohibiting the governor and 17 county clerks from enforcing certain signature requirements \nrelating to several proposed Move Oregon’s Border ballot initiatives. The Court first notes that \nMichael McCarter does not appear to be a licensed attorney. Therefore, he may not represent \nMove Oregon’s Border in this proceeding. The relief sought appears to relate to Move Oregon’s \nBorder, not Michael McCarter individually. Putting that issue aside, because Plaintiff has not \ndemonstrated reasonable diligence in collecting the required signatures, he fails to demonstrate \nany likelihood of success on the merits of his claim.  Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive \nrelief is DENIED. \n1 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \nDockets.Justia.com\n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 33    Filed 07/20/20    Page 2 of 6\n \nBACKGROUND \nAs described in the Secretary of State’s Initiative and Referendum Manual, “the initiative \nand referendum process is a method of direct democracy that allows people to propose laws or \namendments to the Constitution or to adopt or reject a bill passed by the legislature.” OREGON \nELECTIONS DIVISION, STATE INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM MANUAL 3 (“INITIATIVE MANUAL”) \n(2020), https://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Documents/stateIR.pdf. As part of that process, Oregon \nrequires a party seeking to place an initiative on the ballot to require a certain amount of verified \nsignatures. Plaintiff cannot meet those requirements and argues executive orders requiring social \ndistancing prevented it from ever obtaining the requisite signatures.  \nBy the time Plaintiff could begin collecting signatures, a global pandemic had begun, \nupending all aspects of life. As of July 12, 2020, coronavirus has infected over 12.8 million \npeople and killed over 560,000. Coronavirus Resource Center, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV. & MED., \nhttps://coronavirus.jhu.edu/  (last  visited  July  12,  2020  at  8:38  pm).  On  March  8,  Oregon \nGovernor Kate Brown declared a state of emergency, currently in effect until September 4. \nExecutive  Order  20-30  (June  30,  2020),  https://www.oregon.gov/gov/Document/executive \n_orders/eo_20-30.pdf.  Fifteen  days  after  declaring  a  State  of  Emergency,  Governor  Brown \nmandated social distancing and banned all social gatherings “if a distance of at least six feet \nbetween  individuals  cannot  be  maintained.”  Executive  Order  20-12  (March  23,  2020), \nhttps://www.oregon.gov/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_20-12.pdf. While Executive Order \n20-12 was eventually replaced by later Executive Orders and certain counties could partially \nreopen, Oregonians still had to maintain physical distance from each other. Executive Order 20-\n25  (May  14,  2020),  https://www.oregon.gov/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_20-25.pdf; \n2 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 33    Filed 07/20/20    Page 3 of 6\n \nExecutive  Order  20-27  (June  5,  2020), \nhttps://www.oregon.gov/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_20-27.pdf.  \nAs noted, Plaintiff argues it cannot meet the signature requirements and asks the Court to \nenjoin the counties from enforcing those requirements during the upcoming election.   \nSTANDARD OF LAW \nA party seeking a preliminary injunction “must establish that he is likely to succeed on \nthe merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the \nbalance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.” Winter v. \nNatural  Res.  Defense  Council,  Inc.,  129  S.  Ct.  365,  374  (2008).  The  mere  possibility  of \nirreparable harm is not enough. Rather, the plaintiff must establish that this harm is likely. \nAlliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011). The standards for \nissuing  a  temporary  restraining  order  are  like  those  required  for  a  preliminary  injunction. \nLockheed Missile & Space Co., Inc. v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 887 F. Supp. 1320, 1323 (N.D. Ca. \n1995). \nANALYSIS  \n  Plaintiff argues that the effect of COVID-19 and the Governor’s Executive Orders in \nresponse to slowing the spread of the virus has created a situation in which Move Oregon’s \nBorder cannot comply with the deadlines and requirements of the initiative process. This Court’s \ndecision, just last week, in People Not Politicians Oregon, et al., v. Clarno, 2020 WL 3960440 \n(D. Or. July 13, 2020) is directly on point.  \nThe right to petition the government is at the core of First Amendment protections and \nthis includes the right to present initiatives. City of Cuyahoga Falls Ohio v. Buckeye Cmty. Hope \nFound., 538 U.S. 188, 196 (2003); see also Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414, 421–22 (1988) \n3 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 33    Filed 07/20/20    Page 4 of 6\n \n(explaining that the circulation of ballot petitions is “core political speech”). “Courts generally \napply the framework established in Anderson v. Celebrezze, as later refined in Burdick v. Takushi \n(the  Anderson-Burdick  framework)  when  considering  the  constitutionality  of  ballot  access \nrestrictions.” Reclaim Idaho, 2020 WL 3490216, at *7 (citing Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. \n780 (1983); Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428 (1992)).  \nThe Court  follows other district  courts in the Ninth  Circuit in finding that  analysis \noutlined in Angle v. Miller, 373 F.3d 1122 (9th Cir. 2012) is the proper framework given the \nunprecedented times during this pandemic. Reclaim Idaho, 2020 WL 3490216, at *7; Fair Maps \nNevada v. Cegavske, No. 3:20-cv-00271-MMD-WGC, 2020 WL 2798018, at *11 (D. Nev. May \n29, 2020). In Angle, the Ninth Circuit explained that restrictions on the initiative process will \nburden core political speech if: (1) the regulations restrict one-on-one communication between \npetition circulators and voters; or (2) the regulations make it less likely that proponents can \nobtain the necessary signatures to place the initiative on the ballot. 673 F.3d at 1132.  \nAssuming, without deciding, that the challenged regulations burden core political speech, \nthe Court must then decide what form of review to use when analyzing Defendants’ conduct. See \nArizonans for Fair Elections v. Hobbs, No. CV-20-00658-PHX-DWL, 2020 WL 1905747, at *8 \n(D. Ariz. Apr. 17, 2020). “Courts apply strict scrutiny when: (1) the proponents of the initiative \nhave been ‘reasonably diligent’ as compared to other initiative proponents; and (2) when the \nrestrictions significantly inhibit the proponents'  ability to  place  an initiative on the ballot.” \nReclaim Idaho, 2020 WL 3490216, at *8 (quoting Fair Maps Nevada, 2020 WL 2798018, at \n*11). But if Plaintiffs cannot meet either prong, then the Court will apply a lesser form of \nscrutiny. See Angle, 673 F.3d at 1133. \n4 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 33    Filed 07/20/20    Page 5 of 6\n \nBeginning  with  the  first  prong,  the  Court  first  determines  whether  Plaintiffs  were \n“reasonably diligent” as compared to other initiative proponents. Id. (“We have held that the \nburden on plaintiffs’ rights should be measured by whether, in light of the entire statutory \nscheme regulating ballot access, reasonably diligent candidates can normally gain a place on the \nballot, or whether they will rarely succeed in doing so.” (quotations and citation omitted)). \nPlaintiff presents scant evidence indicating it was reasonably diligent.  Plaintiff provided no \nsworn  declaration  detailing  steps  taken  to  gather  signatures.  Only  in  paragraph  44  of  the \ncomplaint does Plaintiff allege efforts taken to gather signatures. In that paragraph, Plaintiff \nalleges Move Oregon’s Border held a rally in Roseburg, Oregon on March 7, 2020. Compl. ¶ 44. \nApproximately 500 people attended the rally and Plaintiff collected 389 signatures. Id. Plaintiff \nalleges it has 9195 members on its “single-issue Facebook group.” Id. \nThe facts in People Not Politicians stand in stark contrast to those present here. There, \nPlaintiffs gathered over $500,000 in support of the petition, sent out tens of thousands of mailers \nafter  the  governor  issued  COVID-19  social  distancing  orders,  and  collected  over  64,000 \nsignatures. Petitioners there were experienced in placing past initiatives on multiple ballots, and \npresented sworn declarations outlining plans, undertaken before the pandemic, leading to a \nreasonable  likelihood  of  success  on  the  current  initiative.  Plaintiff  here  presents  no  such \nevidence. Holding one rally, collecting less-than 400 signatures, and hosting a Facebook page \ndoes not constitute reasonable diligence when compared with other initiative proponents. Angle, \n673 F.3d at 1133.  \n  As Plaintiff has not been reasonably diligent, the Court analyzes the restrictions on a \nrational basis review. Angle, 673 F.3d at 1134. Defendants “need show only that the rule furthers \nan  important  regulatory  interest.”  Id.  at  1135  (internal  quotations  and  citation  omitted). \n5 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 33    Filed 07/20/20    Page 6 of 6\n \nDefendants  have  significant  regulatory  interests  in  maintaining  adherence  to  the  initiative \nrequirements laid out in Oregon’s constitution. Reclaim Idaho, 2020 WL 3490216, at *8. (citing \nAngle, 673 F.3d at 1135). Additionally, Oregon “undeniably has an important regulatory interest \n‘in making sure that an initiative has sufficient grass roots support to be placed on the ballot.’” \nAngle, 673 F.3d at 1135 (quoting Meyer, 486 U.S. at 425-26). As Plaintiff has not demonstrated \nreasonable diligence, and because the state clearly has important regulatory interests in enforcing \nthe signature requirements, Plaintiff fails to demonstrate any likelihood of success on the merits.1 \nCONCLUSION \nThe Secretary of State has a vital interest in regulating the petition processes. Purcell v. \nGonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 4 (2006). It is also important that the federal courts not take it upon \nthemselves to rewrite state election rules, particularly on the eve of an election. Republican Nat’l \nComm., 140 S. Ct at 1207. Because, based on this record, Plaintiff does not present any evidence \nindicating More Oregon’s Border was reasonably diligent in collecting the required signatures, \nthe Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion for emergency injunctive relief.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDATED this 20th day of June, 2020. \n______/s/ Michael McShane_______ \nMichael J. McShane \nUnited States District Judge \n \n                                                           \n1 As Plaintiff fails to demonstrate any likelihood of success on the merits, the Court does not address the \npersuasive arguments several defendants raised in opposition (i.e., that Plaintiff’s claims are not ripe, that \nPlaintiff’s requested relief is barred by laches, etc).  \n6 – OPINION AND ORDER \n ",

As the required number of signatures have already been gathered in Wallowa County, and as \nPlaintiff is not a chief petitioner of an active petition in Crook County or Malheur County, the \nremedy requested below does not address Defendants who are officers of those counties.  Plaintiff \nis a chief petitioner of an initiative in each of the other counties listed below, including Sherman \nCounty. \n3. Plaintiff requests that the Court direct Defendants (excluding the Wallowa County Clerk, the \nCrook County Clerk, and the Malheur County Clerk) to verify, qualify, and certify as a county \nmeasure for the November 3, 2020 ballot any petitions that have been filed by Michael McCarter \nthat have been approved for circulation by the chief elections official of their county prior to or on \nAugust 24, 2020, and have 20% of the normally required number of valid signatures submitted \nprior to or on August 24, 2020. \nSECOND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT      2 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 35    Filed 07/22/20    Page 3 of 12\n4. Plaintiff certifies that he emailed this Motion, Plaintiff’s Declaration, and Plaintiff’s Second \nProposed Order on July 22, 2020 to each Defendant or counsel of Defendant, using email addresses \nlisted on government websites or in government emails.  \nMEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to an extraordinary set of circumstances in Oregon \nand nationwide. In an effort to contain the virus and protect the public health, the State of Oregon \nhas implemented several emergency measures that, although perhaps reasonable in light of the \npublic health crisis, make it impossible for Plaintiff and other citizens to comply with the statutory \nprocedures they must follow to participate in Oregon’s electoral processes. In particular, as chief \npetitioner, Plaintiff is required by law to obtain voters’ signatures on petitions to qualify his ballot \ninitiatives on Oregon’s November 3, 2020 general election ballot. Under the emergency measures \nnow  in  place,  however,  Plaintiff  cannot  lawfully  comply  with  these  requirements.  These \nemergency measures are listed in Plaintiff’s Complaint, paragraphs 35-38 and 40-41.  \nThe deadline for submitting county ballot initiative signatures for this election cycle is \nAugust 5, 2020.  Plaintiff has received from Defendants no offers of relief or accommodation.  \nPlaintiff therefore urgently needs the relief requested herein, to protect his speech and petitioning \nrights as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. In the absence of such relief, \nPlaintiff will suffer irreparable harm, because his petitions and his organization’s petitions will be \nexcluded from the 2020 election ballot. \nArgument \nWe here incorporate the text of the argument given in pages 11 through 20 in the Plaintiff’s \nMotion for Temporary Restraining Order And/Or Preliminary Injunction in an ongoing case in the \nUS District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, number 2:20-cv-02129.  We request that the \nSECOND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT      3 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 35    Filed 07/22/20    Page 4 of 12\nargument be understood to refer to Oregon rather than Ohio.  As Pro Se Plaintiff, I humbly request \nthat that argument be read in full at the link given in this footnote.1 \nDiligence \nPlaintiff excludes the first full paragraph of page 16 of that argument. In its place we will \nnow consider the Plaintiff’s diligence and the purpose of Oregon counties’ signature threshold. \nAttached to this Motion is a sworn declaration by Plaintiff showing that by all measures, Plaintiff \nwas diligent enough for Wallowa County.  In Wallowa County, the movement gathered enough \nsignatures to meet the original signature threshold days or weeks before August 5.  Plaintiff applied \nthe same diligence in the other counties he has petitions in.  This diligence paid off in Jefferson \nCounty also, but the lockdown has thwarted the results he sought in other counties.  \nStill, as detailed in Plaintiff’s Declaration, Plaintiff managed to lead his movement to the \npoint that it has now in hand a quantity of signatures that is a greater percentage of the signature \nthreshold in six counties than People Not Politicians did statewide. Those counties are Wallowa, \nJefferson, Union, Douglas, Grant, Harney. And when the August 5 date arrives, Plaintiff expects \nthat Malheur County and Baker County will be added to that list. (Plaintiff is not listed as a chief \npetitioner on the Malheur County petition though).  It would be justifiable to issue an injunction \nthat treats different counties differently because each county has its own initiative and its own \ncircumstances. \nPlaintiff led Move Oregon’s Border to create a website, greateridaho.org, where each \npetition can be downloaded.  Each petition pdf file created by Move Oregon’s Border contains \ninstructions for collecting signatures legally and printing it double-sided, as required by law, which \nis a burden in itself.

Davis, paragraph 6, says two statewide initiatives met the \noriginal statewide signature threshold for the General Election. But those campaigns began long \nbefore the pandemic, and two is a historically small number, and 72 petitions campaigns attempted \nto  meet  that  goal.  https://www.bendbulletin.com/localstate/state/pandemic-leads-to-unusually-\nshort-list-of-ballot-measures/article_ae820da8-bd6f-11ea-87a2-5f833065356c.html \nIn Fair Maps Nevada, the federal court found reasonable diligence despite the facts that \npetitioners (1) did not file their initiative until January 7, 2020; (2) had collected less than 11% of \nrequired signatures—only about 10,000 out of the 97,598 needed; (3) did not even attempt to \ncollect any signatures after the governor’s “Stay-at-Home” order went into effect; and (4) had not \npresented any evidence about comparable initiative campaigns. Fair Maps Nevada, 2020 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 94696 at *31. Since this fact pattern showed reasonable diligence, Plaintiffs in this \ncase satisfy this requirement in some counties. See also SawariMedia, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n102237, at *36 (holding Plaintiffs showed “diligence” by collecting over 60% of required initiative \nsignatures despite waiting to file until January 16, 2020). \nAccording to Reclaim Idaho 2020 WL 3490216, at *8, based on the Angle v. Miller, 373 \nF.3d 1122 (9th Cir 2012), proponents of an initiative should be “reasonably diligent” as compared \nto other initiative proponents. But which proponents should they be compared to?  Logically, if \nthe Oregon Constitution sets 6% as the threshold to distinguish worthy initiatives from unworthy \ninitiatives, then the proponents should not be compared to average initiative proponents.  To \ndiscover the minimum standard, they should be compared to the least diligent proponents who \nmanage to meet the 6% signature threshold under normal times, because that 6% is the threshold \nestablished for the state.  It makes no sense to compare them to initiative proponents who could \ngather a far larger or smaller number of signatures. \nSECOND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT      6 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 35    Filed 07/22/20    Page 7 of 12\nA better standard than diligence \nPresumably, there are volunteers who chose to download Plaintiff’s petitions and start \ngathering signatures who are as yet unknown to Plaintiff.  Rather than list the number of hours \nworked by volunteers for our movement in each county, which is a number Plaintiff can not certify, \nPlaintiff suggests that the number of signatures gathered by the deadline be the test of the \nmovement’s diligence.  Plaintiff hesitates to make a log of mundane trivial activities personally \naccomplished on behalf of the petition campaigns, such as appearing in interviews, making \nFacebook posts, recruiting leaders, etc. Compared to a list of Plaintiff’s activities, the signatures \ngathered themselves are more persuasive, more quantifiable, more verifiable, and more relevant.   \nThe signature threshold was added to the Oregon Constitution, presumably, in the belief \nthat if the number of petitions must be limited, then it is better to certify to the ballot those \ninitiatives that have the support of more people. Exercising our rights should not be dependent on \ngetting financial backing from corporations.  No one in Plaintiff’s movement is paid for work \nrelated to Move Oregon’s Border.  This movement does not have a corporate sponsor to pay for \nlarge mailings.  A corporate sponsor should not be required for the exercise of constitional rights. \nDuring a pandemic, how can we determine how many people support an initiative?  A \nmovement with paid signature collectors that could just barely collect 100% of the requirement in \na normal year would certainly gather far, far fewer during a pandemic.  It is even worse for a \nmovement dependent on unpaid collectors, because few potential unpaid collectors will even try \nif they think the threshold is unattainable. We assert that during these months of the pandemic, a \npetition that manages to garner 20% of the signatures required would probably have garnered \n100% of the required signatures during normal times. Potential volunteers and signers are reluctant \nto leave their homes for non-essential purposes.  \nSECOND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT      7 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 35    Filed 07/22/20    Page 8 of 12\nPlaintiff should not need to show that he is more diligent than other chief petitioners, but \nrather that the petition is attractive enough to the populace that is would have gained 100% of the \nrequired signatures under normal conditions.  Or rather, let each county prove whether the petition \nis attractive enough to them to provoke a movement that gathers 20% of the signatures required. \nLet’s use the signature threshold for Jackson County, 6114, as an example. If the Court estimates \nthat it is five times harder to motivate potential volunteers to try to successfully gather 6114 \nsignatures during a pandemic as compared to during the normal times that the Oregon Constitution \ncountenances, we invite the Court to reduce the signature threshold to a fifth of the normal \nrequirements.  In this way, the Oregon Constitution’s ability to distinguish between attractive and \nunattractive petitions is preserved, and it is tuned to the correct level, as estimated by the Court. \nAn injunction should be written such that, during the pandemic, an initiative will make the ballot \nif it is attractive to the populace to the degree that it would have been certified to the ballot during \nnormal times. \nIrreparable Harm, Balance of Equities, and Ripeness \nThe ordinances Plaintiff is trying to get on the books, if approved by a vote in November,  \nwill enlist county governments in working toward moving state borders. Plaintiff’s movement \nneeds the support of county governments, through these ordinances, to help these counties escape \nOregon governance.  The risk to Plaintiff’s movement is that he will fail to get a large enough \ngroup of counties on the ballot this November to make a difference in Oregon politics.   \nThe Douglas County initiative modifies a 1997 ordinance that allows the county board to \nappropriate county funds to advocate for legislation to Oregon officials, by adding Idaho officials \nto the set of officials that may be lobbied using county funds. In two other counties, Plaintiff’s \nSECOND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT      8 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 35    Filed 07/22/20    Page 9 of 12\ninitiatives designate the county board as the board responsible for advocating the interests of the \ncounty in border relocation negotiations. \nPlaintiff’s initiatives for two counties create a new county board for considering state \nborder relocation. In Josephine County, Plaintiff’s initiative forbids county employees from \ndelaying requests for information from Oregon or Idaho. In all the other counties, Plaintiff’s \ninitiatives require meetings of the county board on relocating state borders. \nThese meetings are not insignificant, because, as described in Plaintiff’s Declaration \nparagraph 3, attached, state legislators in both states have already decided to begin inter-state talks \non relocating the Idaho/Oregon state border. \nA dramatic change such as moving a state border is hard to justify without an election that \nhas a large turnout, but such elections only happen every 4 years, when there is a presidential \nelection.   If Plaintiff’s movement is delayed, the harm is that the relevant counties will continue \nto suffer the neglect of Oregon governance for two to four years longer than otherwise would be \nthe case. \nPlaintiff acknowledges that he has approval to continue gathering signatures for one to two \nyears.  But many other initiative campaigns around the country have received injunctions despite \nsuch a situation, including People Not Politicians.  \nThe ability of courageous volunteers to gather enough signatures in Wallowa County and \nJefferson County shows that, absent the fear of the pandemic, these initiatives would have attracted \nenough support to get enough signatures for the 2020 General Election in every county, unlike \ninitiatives that are so unappealing that they require two years to be qualified for the ballot.  Thus, \nthe harm of not appearing on the General Election of 2020 ballot is what makes this case ripe. \nBalance of Equities proper \nSECOND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT      9 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 35    Filed 07/22/20    Page 10 of 12\nState Defendant’s Response To Plaintiff’s Motion says that “Allowing a flood of initiatives \nwould dilute the electorate’s attention and decrease the quality of decision-making...” (page 14).  \nThe purpose of the signature requirement is to prevent an over-abundance of initiatives on the \nballot.  An over-abundance won’t occur in this case because of the tight schedule remaining. It is \nso tight that it will not present an opportunity to new entrants. In our experience (described in \nComplaint paragraph 31), it takes one to six months to get permission to circulate. Even after a \nprospective petition has been drafted that will meet the standards of a specific county clerk, the \ntypical county government will take four weeks to issue an approval to circulate the petition. The \nreason it takes four weeks is explained in Complaint paragraph 52. \nIf the Court chooses to allow Plaintiff’s initiatives to be certified to the ballot with only \n20% of the signature threshold, the 20% signature threshold could fairly be applied to other court \ncases in which a county initiative that was approved to circulate after January 2020.  Or this \nrequested injunction could be written to include all such initiatives.  This date “January 2020” \ndistinguishes campaigns that were limited by the pandemic from the campaigns that could have \ngathered enough signatures before the pandemic.  A consistent, bright-line 20% rule would reduce \nthe burden on the court system and maintain political neutrality.   \nBoth Harney County’s response and Grant County’s response to Plaintiff’s Motion says \n“If this Court grants Plaintiff’s motion, Defendant urges this Court to lower the signature threshold \nby 50 percent and allow Plaintiff’s an extension of five weeks to meet the signature threshhold” \n(page 8).  This proves that some county clerks believe that they can accommodate an extension of \nfive weeks. \nRegarding the injunction granted to People Not Politicians, a July 15 press report quoted \nOregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum as saying “While Secretary Clarno did not ask us to \nSECOND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT      10 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 35    Filed 07/22/20    Page 11 of 12\nappeal Judge McShane’s ruling, the Secretary deferred to our view that the overall interests of the \nstate require us to file this appeal.” https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2020/07/oregon-secretary-\nof-state-attorney-general-clash-on-lowering-bar-to-ballot-measure.html    Just  a  day  after  this \nCourt’s order in that case, the Oregon Secretary of State issued a press release stating she would \ncomply  with  the  order  and  was  “not  requesting  an  appeal  to  the  ruling  at  this  time.” \nhttps://www.oregon.gov/newsroom/Pages/NewsDetail.aspx?newsid=36951 Clearly, the Secretary \nof State finds small delays in the submission of initiative signatures manageable, as pointed out in \nthe insightful Plaintiffs-Appellees’ Opposition to Motion For Emergency Stay in this case no. 20-\n35630 http://ballot-access.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Document171.pdf \nLaches \nPlaintiff’s Declaration, paragraph 4, attached, explains why Plaintiff filed as late as June 30, 2020.  \nThere was no attempt to prejudice.  As Plaintiff’s initiatives that have been approved so far were \napproved as late as June 12, it would have been difficult to file this as-applied constitutional \nchallenge earlier and still meet Plaintiff’s burden of proof.  It took time to get signature sheets \napproved by Defendants after that date, mobilize volunteers, and get signatures to prove diligence.  \nPlaintiff had expected to be able to sue on behalf of the Malheur County petition, which was \napproved July 1, but Plaintiff is not listed as a chief petitioner of that petition.  \nConclusion \n  Early this month, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected an emergency stay motion in \nReclaim Idaho v Little, No. 20-35584,  which sought to stop a more proactive change to initiative \nrequirements than the remedies sought by Plaintiff here.  The U.S. District Court for the District \nof Idaho, on page 22 of the Memorandum Decision and Order for that case, summarized a \nconclusion of Buckley v. Am Constitutional Law Found., Inc., 525 U.S. 182, 191-92 (1999) this \nSECOND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT      11 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 35    Filed 07/22/20    Page 12 of 12\nway: “states have ‘considerable leeway’ in regulating the electoral process, provided their choices \ndo not produce ‘undue hindrances to political conversations and the exchange of ideas.’” \n   For  the  foregoing  reasons,  Plaintiff  respectfully  moves  the  Court  to  GRANT  the \npreliminary relief granted. \n \nDated: July 22, 2020. \n \n \n \n \ns/Michael McCarter \nMichael McCarter \n \nSECOND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT      12 \n ",

Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 65(a) and (b), and in view of the public health \ncrisis precipitated by the coronavirus pandemic known as COVID-19 and the ensuing emergency \nmeasures adopted by the State of Oregon, Plaintiff respectfully moves the Court to enter a \npreliminary  injunction  and/or  temporary  restraining  order  that  prohibits  Defendants  from \nenforcing or applying provisions of Oregon or local law that require voters’ signatures on petitions \nas a condition of qualifying a county initiative for the election ballot. Plaintiffs specifically request \nthat the Court enjoin Defendants from enforcing, in 2020, the following statutory provisions as \napplied to county ballot initiative petitions approved for circulation by a county elections official:  \nORS 250.205(4), and Jackson County Charter Chapter VII Section 28(2)(a), and any local charter \nor ordinance that may require Umatilla County to require voter signatures for qualification of ballot \ninitiatives.  Jackson County and Umatilla County are the only home-rule counties relevant to this \ncase. \n2. Jackson County Charter Chapter VII Section 28(2) reads as follows: \nAn  initiative  measure  and  a  referendum  may  be  proposed  by  the  signatures  of \nqualified County voters of a number equal to the following percentages of the total \nnumber  of  votes  cast  in  the  County  for  all  candidates  for  Governor  at  the  regular \nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT 2 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 7    Filed 07/06/20    Page 3 of 16\ngubernatorial  election  next  preceding  the  filing  of  the  petition: \n(a) Initiative petitions, six percent;  \n(b) ... \n \n3. Plaintiff requests that the Court direct Defendants to verify, qualify, and certify as a county \nmeasure for the November 3, 2020 ballot any petitions that have been filed by an agent of Move \nOregon’s Border and that have been approved for circulation prior to or on August 5, 2020 by the \nchief elections official of their county, without requiring the signatures from voters otherwise \nrequired by law. \n4.

No identification number has yet been provided.  \n5. Plaintiff certifies that he emailed his Complaint, this Motion, and Plaintiff’s Proposed Order on \nJuly  6,  2020  to  each  Defendant  or  counsel  of  Defendant,  using  email  addresses  listed  on \ngovernment websites or in government emails.  \nMEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to an extraordinary set of circumstances in Oregon \nand nationwide. In an effort to contain the virus and protect the public health, the State of Oregon \nhas implemented several emergency measures that, although perhaps reasonable in light of the \npublic health crisis, make it impossible for Plaintiff and other citizens to comply with the statutory \nprocedures they must follow to participate in Oregon’s electoral processes. In particular, as petition \ncirculator, Plaintiff is required by law to obtain voters’ signatures on petitions to qualify his ballot \ninitiatives on Oregon’s November 3, 2020 general election ballot. Under the emergency measures \nnow  in  place,  however,  Plaintiff  cannot  lawfully  comply  with  these  requirements.  These \nemergency measures are listed in Plaintiff’s Complaint, paragraphs 35-38 and 40-41.  \nThe public-health emergency caused by COVID-19 and the various orders issued by the \nGovernor under color of law make it apparently unlawful and practically impossible to gather \npetition signatures in these counties.  Even during Phase II, the Governor requires this distance of \nsix feet to be maintained.  It is impossible to politely throw someone a pen and a clip board from \na distance of six feet.  Presumably, even hands of different individuals must be kept six feet apart, \nsince hands themselves are considered to be a part of an individual’s person.   \nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT 4 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 7    Filed 07/06/20    Page 5 of 16\nThe deadline for submitting county ballot initiative signatures for this election cycle is \nAugust 5, 2020.  Plaintiff has received from Defendants no offers of relief or accommodation.  \nPlaintiff therefore urgently needs the relief requested herein, to protect his speech and petitioning \nrights as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. In the absence of such relief, \nPlaintiff will suffer irreparable harm, because his petitions and his organization’s petitions will be \nexcluded from the 2020 election ballot. \nArgument \nWe here incorporate the text of the argument given in pages 11 through 20 in the Plaintiff’s \nMotion for Temporary Restraining Order And/Or Preliminary Injunction in an ongoing case in the \nUS District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, number 2:20-cv-02129.  We request that the \nargument be understood to refer to Oregon rather than Ohio.  As Pro Se Plaintiff, I humbly request \nthat that argument be read in full at the link given in this footnote,1 or in the facsimiles of that \nmotion, which I have included as pages 7 through 16 of this Motion.  \nWe exclude the first full paragraph of page 16 of that argument. In its place we note that \nMove Oregon’s Border has generated great enthusiasm since the movement began in April 2019 \nand the 501(c)4 and Facebook page was officially founded in early 2020.   Less than 12,800 people \nthat follow the official Facebook page of the largest political party in the State of Oregon.2 This \npage serves the whole state, which has a population of more than four million. Compare it to Move \nOregon’s Border, which serves a territory of eastern and southern Oregon which has a population \nof approximately 856,000.  Its Facebook group has more than 9200 members.3 And its rally before \n                                                 \n1 https://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/VR-OH-0085-0002.pdf  \n2 https://www.facebook.com/ordems \n3 https://www.facebook.com/groups/GreaterIdaho/ \nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT 5 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 7    Filed 07/06/20    Page 6 of 16\nthe COVID-19 executive orders, its only rally, attracted an attendance estimated at five hundred \npeople.4  \nWe expect that Defendants will not claim that reducing the signature count threshold would \nlead to an ungainly number of ballot initiatives on the ballot, because the number of days remaining \nbefore the August 5 deadline is relatively small. It is so small that it will not present an opportunity \nto new entrants. In our experience (described in Complaint paragraph 31), it takes one to six \nmonths to get permission to circulate. Even after a prospective petition has been drafted that will \nmeet the standards of a specific county clerk, the typical county government will take four weeks \nto issue an approval to circulate the petition. The reason it takes four weeks is explained in \nComplaint paragraph 52. \nCounty ballot initiative signature campaigns must be completed within two years of a \ncounty clerk’s approval to circulate a petition, except in Jackson County, where the time limit is \none year. Very few county ballot initiatives have been approved to circulate in Oregon within the \nlast two years, so the ballot will not be flooded with old ballot measures if the Court chooses to \nreduce the signature threshold for all county ballot initiatives in the relevant counties. \n \nDated: July 6, 2020. \n \n \n \n \ns/Michael McCarter \nMichael McCarter \n \n                                                 \n4 https://www.nrtoday.com/news/local/greater-idaho-proposal-greeted-with-enthusiasm-at-\nsaturday-rally/article_45165ee3-6c41-54f0-9fcd-7825e522f0ef.html \nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT 6 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 7    Filed 07/06/20    Page 7 of 16\n \n \nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT 7 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 7    Filed 07/06/20    Page 8 of 16\n \n \nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT 8 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 7    Filed 07/06/20    Page 9 of 16\n \nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT 9 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 7    Filed 07/06/20    Page 10 of 16\n \nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT 10 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 7    Filed 07/06/20    Page 11 of 16\n \nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT 11 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 7    Filed 07/06/20    Page 12 of 16\n \n \nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT 12 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 7    Filed 07/06/20    Page 13 of 16\n \n \nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT 13 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 7    Filed 07/06/20    Page 14 of 16\n \n \nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT 14 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 7    Filed 07/06/20    Page 15 of 16\n \n \nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT 15 \n \n\nCase 6:20-cv-01048-MC    Document 7    Filed 07/06/20    Page 16 of 16\n \nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nORDER AND ATTACHED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT 16 \n ",
