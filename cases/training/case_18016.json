    "summary": "<p>This case is about the constitutionality of the measures taken by the executive branch of the New York state government and New York City municipal government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On December 25, 2020, a New York limited liability company, a non-profit entity, and an individual resident of the state, each involved with the New York city restaurant industry, filed this putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. They sued the Governor of New York, the New York City Department of Finance, the New York City Sheriff's Department, and the Mayor of New York City under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 on behalf of themselves and all similarly situated parties. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought a class certification, an injunction against the Governor's executive orders prohibiting all in-person dining from 10:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. in New York City and suspending all indoor dining in the city, a declaration that the orders are unconstitutional, and preliminary relief enjoining enforcement of the order.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs asserted that dining orders violated their First Amendment rights to assemble and to protest the government, infringed on the powers of the federal government to regulate interstate commerce, and violated their Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process rights. In addition, the plaintiffs also alleged that the state legislature's delegation of legislative power to the governor violated the nondelegation doctrine of the New York State Constitution and that the orders violated Section 28 of the New York Executive Law. The case was initially assigned to Judge Colleen McMahon but was reassigned to Judge Paul A. Crotty before any judicial orders were filed.</p>\r\n<p>On December 30, 2020, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. On January 8, 2021, the court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction. The court noted that when an injunction would affect government action taken in the public interest pursuant to a statute or regulatory scheme, the moving party must demonstrate irreparable harm absent injunctive relief, a likelihood of success on the merits, and public interest weighing in favor of an injunction. The court stated that the plaintiffs' motion failed to meet the irreparable harm and public interest factors. According to the court, the plaintiffs' nearly three week delay between the governor's banning of indoor dining and the motion for a temporary restraining order indicated that the plaintiffs' alleged harm is not irreparable. Regarding the public interest prong, the court stated, given that judges are not public health experts, that it gives a presumption of validity to prophylactic measures designed to protect the public from COVID-19. The court's order did not express a view on the merits' of the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs' preliminary injunction motion requested that all New York City restaurants be permitted to operate at 50% indoor dining capacity and to allow all New York restaurants to be able to serve customers until midnight, arguing that the current policy violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, the Dormant Commerce Clause, and the First Amendment. On February 9, 2021, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 18 F.Supp.3d 705. The court again noted the three factors that the moving party must demonstrate under the facts of this case to receive preliminary relief: (1) irreparable harm absent relief; (2) a likelihood of success on the merits; and (3) public interest weighing in favor of the granting of the injunction.</p>\r\n<p>The court stated that the plaintiffs' constitutional claims were not likely to succeed on the merits. Citing relevant case law, the court asserted that the plaintiffs would need to show that the New York City dining policy has no substantial relation to the public welfare and that it is a plain invasion of fundamental rights. The court concluded that the plaintiffs had not met this standard, since the policy was related to curbing the transmission of COVID-19 and that the plaintiffs' requested relief (50% indoor capacity) showed that some public health regulation of restaurants is constitutional. The court also stated that since none of the plaintiffs' constitutional claims were viable, that the court must apply rational basis review. The court concluded that the dining policy easily passed rational basis scrutiny since it was premised on a rational scientific basis related to mitigating the transmission of COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>The court also analyzed the irreparable harm prong of the preliminary relief standard. The court concluded that the plaintiffs had not established a likelihood of irreparable injury absent injunctive relief since all of the injuries alleged by the plaintiffs are monetary, which are not grounds for a preliminary injunction. On the public interest prong, the court stated that the dining policy effectuated a compelling public interest by attempting to curb the transmission of COVID-19. The court noted that the principles of federalism, separation of powers, and judicial modesty demanded that the court respect the decisions of New York state lawmakers and not try control state responses from the federal bench.</p>\r\n<p>On April 2, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for a failure to state a claim for which relief may be granted. On April 11, 2021, the court granted the motion to dismiss. While the defendants asserted that the plaintiffs' claims were moot because restaurants were allowed to reopen at 50% capacity starting in March 2021, the court stated that the claims were not moot since the governor could still reintroduce COVID-19 restrictions on restaurants. However, the court did dismiss the federal constitutional claims for a failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted. The court incorporated the same reasoning as it used in deciding the preliminary injunction motion as for the motion to dismiss regarding the constitutional claims. On the remaining two state law claims, the court stated that Supreme Court precedent holds that sovereign immunity prohibits federal courts from entering injunctions against state officials on the basis of state law, even if brought into court under supplemental jurisdiction. Therefore, the state claims were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The case is now closed.</p>",

    "summary_short": "In 2020, a New York business, non-profit, and an individual resident filed this putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs alleged that the state's COVID-19 dining policies violated their First and Fourteenth Amendment Rights, in addition to infringing on the federal government's power to regulate interstate commerce and violating the nondelegation doctrine and New York state law. In January 2021, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order and denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction in February. In April 2021, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss for a failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted and for lack of jurisdiction. The case is now closed.",

Restaurants in New York must \nclose at 10 PM and restaurants in New York City cannot serve customers indoors.  The Plaintiffs, \nwhose livelihoods depend on the restaurant industry, have suffered greatly from these \nrestrictions.  They have experienced substantial losses in revenue and are at risk of closing up \nshop permanently.  They now seek a Preliminary Injunction enjoining Governor Cuomo’s dining \nrestrictions on the grounds that the restrictions violate the federal Constitution and that the public \ninterest would be better served without them.  For the reasons set forth below, these arguments \nare rejected and the Preliminary Injunction motion is DENIED.  \n \n1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 2 of 21\nBACKGROUND \nI.  The COVID-19 Pandemic \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused innumerable human death and suffering in the state \nof New York.  To date, more than 1.4 million New Yorkers have contracted the COVID-19 virus \nand more than 44,000 have died as a result.  See New York Coronavirus Map and Case Count, \nN.Y. TIMES, https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/new-york-coronavirus-cases.html \n(updated Feb. 8, 2021).  In New York City alone, over 27,000 people have succumbed to the \nvirus.  See United States COVID-19 Cases & Deaths by State, Ctrs. for Disease Control & \nPrevention, https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker (updated Feb. 7, 2021).  At its peak, New \nYork experienced “more coronavirus cases than any single country in the world.”  (Dr. Blog \nDecl. ¶ 74, ECF 40.)   \nWith the aid of stringent public health measures, New York was able to successfully \nflatten the curve of infections during the summer of 2020.  Beginning in the fall, however, the \nstate confronted a second wave of infections.  (See Dr. Varma Decl. ¶ 17, ECF 36.)  In \nSeptember, the state averaged a 50% increase in daily infections.  (Id.)  And that number \ncontinued to rise after the end-of-year holiday season.  (Id. ¶¶ 17–18.)   \nII.  The Dining Policy  \n  In response to the second surge in COVID-19 infections, Governor Cuomo issued two \nexecutive orders that increased restrictions on restaurant dining across the state.  These \nrestrictions (the “Dining Policy”) provide that:1  \n \n1 Governor Cuomo has issued a slew of restrictions on restaurant dining since the onset of the \npandemic.  In March 2020, he issued Executive Order 202.30 which prohibited indoor dining \nacross the state.  (City Br. at 5, ECF 35.)  In June 2020, he issued Executive Order 202.41 which \nallowed indoor dining at 50% capacity in certain regions of the state (but not New York City).  \n(Id. at 6.)  In September 2020, Governor Cuomo lifted the indoor dining ban on New York City \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 3 of 21\n•  E.O. 202.74:  All restaurants in New York State must cease both indoor  \n      and outdoor dining at 10 PM, effective November 13,  \n      2020.  \n \n•  E.O. 202.81:    All restaurants in New York City must suspend indoor  \n      dining, effective December 14, 2020.  \n \n(See Schonfeld Decl. Exs. H & I (“Executive Orders”), ECF 34.)  \n  The Dining Policy aims to slow the further spread of the COVID-19 virus.  According to \npublic health authorities, indoor dining increases the risk of COVID-19 transmission because of \nits poor ventilation and lack of social distancing, and the unmasked face-to-face exposure that \noccurs while eating and drinking.  (See Dr. Blog Decl. ¶¶ 8–59; Dr. Varma Decl. ¶¶ 33–44.)  \nBecause respiratory droplets of the virus can spread through close contact with others as people \ncough, sneeze, talk or sing, public health experts have classified indoor dining as a higher-risk \nactivity.  (See Dr. Blog Decl. ¶¶ 11, 16; Dr. Varma Decl. ¶ 30.)  In a report released last \nSeptember, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that adults who dined \nout were approximately twice as likely to contract COVID-19 as those who did not.  (Dr. Blog \nDecl. ¶ 26.)  Additionally, experts also say the risk of transmission is further supplemented in a \ndensely populated metropolis like New York City.  (See Dr. Blog Decl. ¶¶ 34–38; Dr. Varma \nDecl. ¶ 28.) \n  The Dining Policy’s 10 PM closure rule, which applies both to indoor and outdoor \ndining, also aims to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus.  The rule is premised on the \nrationale that the later people stay out at restaurants, the more liquor their patrons consume, \n \nrestaurants but placed a midnight curfew on all forms of restaurant dining.  (Id.)  The Dining \nPolicy has since subsumed each of these regulations.  While many of these regulations have been \nchallenged in court, none have been successful thus far.  See infra 7–8. \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 4 of 21\nreducing their inhibitions and making them less likely to adhere to mask wearing and social \ndistancing protocols.  (Dr. Blog Decl. ¶¶ 44–52; Dr. Varma Decl. ¶ 37.)   \nIII.  Preliminary Injunction Motion \n  The Plaintiffs are a New York City restaurant, non-profit advocacy group, and restaurant \nworker2 whose livelihoods have been affected by the Dining Policy and COVID-19 pandemic at \nlarge.  (Compl. ¶¶ 54–58, ECF 1.)  \n  On December 25, 2020, the Plaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit against Governor \nCuomo, and the New York City Department of Finance, the New York City Sheriff’s \nDepartment, and Mayor Bill de Blasio (collectively, “City Defendants”).3  (ECF 1.)  On \nDecember 30, the Plaintiffs moved for a TRO and Preliminary Injunction seeking injunctive \nrelief from the Dining Policy.  (ECF 16.)  After holding a telephonic conference on January 6, \nthe Court denied the TRO application and ordered briefing on the Preliminary Injunction motion.  \n(ECF 32.)  The parties subsequently submitted additional briefing and the Court held oral \nargument on the Preliminary Injunction motion on January 21.  \n  The Plaintiffs seek a Preliminary Injunction that would enjoin enforcement of the Dining \nPolicy and (1) permit “bona-fide”4 New York City restaurants to operate at 50% indoor dining \n \n2 Seaport House is a restaurant operating in New York City; Costin Tarsoaga is a restaurant \nworker; and the New York Merchants Alliance is a non-profit advocacy group that represents \nrestaurant owners across New York.  (Compl. ¶¶ 54–56, ECF 1.)  \n3 This case was originally assigned to Chief Judge McMahon but reassigned to this Court on \nJanuary 4, 2021.   \n4 At oral argument, the Plaintiffs clarified “bona fide” restaurants as those establishments “with \ntables seated apart, the windows open” and compliant with “very strict regulations.”  (Oral Arg. \nTr. at 22, ECF 51.)    \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 5 of 21\ncapacity and (2) allow all New York restaurants to be able to serve patrons until midnight.5  (See \nPls.’ Reply, at 7, ECF 44.)  In support of their motion, the Plaintiffs allege that the Dining Policy \ndeprives them of their Constitutional rights under the (1) the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due \nProcess Clause; (2) First Amendment; and (3) Dormant Commerce Clause.  (Pls.’ Br. at 8–11, \nECF 17.)  And they allege that issuance of the Preliminary Injunction will better serve the public \ninterest and redress their irreparable harms.  (Id. at 11–14.) \n  Governor Cuomo and the City Defendants oppose the Preliminary Injunction motion.  \nThey argue that under the Supreme Court’s holding in the 1905 case, Jacobson v. Massachusetts, \n197 U.S. 11 (1905), state and local authorities must be granted substantial deference in \naddressing the COVID-19 pandemic.  (State Br. at 12–14, ECF 41; City Br. at 9–13, ECF 35.)  \nAlternatively, they contend that even if deference is not afforded, the Dining Policy withstands \nConstitutional scrutiny under a traditional doctrinal analysis.  (State Br. at 14–21; City Br. at 13–\n24.)  Finally, they argue that the Dining Policy is a necessary public health measure against the \nCOVID-19 pandemic and therefore that the public interest factor weighs against granting \ninjunctive relief.  (State Br. at 23–25; City Br. at 25–26.)   \n \n5 Although the Plaintiffs point out that Governor Cuomo may soon roll back some of the \nrestrictions challenged on this Preliminary Injunction motion, the matter is not moot because \nGovernor Cuomo has not yet provided all the relief Plaintiffs seek.  Even if he did, however, the \nmatter would not be moot as Plaintiffs are under a “constant threat” of the restrictions being \nreinstated.  See Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 141 S. Ct. 63, 68 (2020). \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 6 of 21\nSeparately, the City Defendants contend that they play a minor role in forming the \nrestrictions Plaintiffs complain of and that, under Governor Cuomo’s executive orders, they are \nrequired by law to adhere to the Dining Policy.6  (City Br. at 8.)  \nANALYSIS \nI.  COVID-19 and Judicial Review \n  The Court must first address what standard of judicial review to apply to the Plaintiffs’ \nConstitutional claims.  Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, many courts have cited the \nSupreme Court’s 1905 decision in Jacobson v. Massachusetts and deferred substantially to state \nand local authorities with respect to their COVID-19 policies.  But recent decisions from the \nSupreme Court and Second Circuit have placed Jacobson’s relevance into question.   \nA.    Jacobson and Its Progeny    \n  In Jacobson v. Massachusetts, the Supreme Court addressed the Constitutionality of a \nMassachusetts law which required mandatory vaccination in response to the ongoing smallpox \npandemic.  197 U.S. at 25.  Plaintiff Henning Jacobson, who was subject to the mandatory \nvaccination law, sued the state of Massachusetts alleging that his substantive due process right to \nbodily integrity was being interfered with.  Id. at 13–14.  Justice Harlan, speaking for the Court, \nrejected Jacobson’s claim, and held that in times of public health crises, a state or local law \n“enacted for the public health” would only be struck down if it had “no real or substantial \n \n6 At oral argument, the Court asked the City Defendants about the consequences of failing to \nadhere to Governor Cuomo’s executive orders.  (Oral Arg. Tr. at 18–19)  The City Defendants \nresponded that “some kind of penalty” in the form of “contempt” would attach.  (Id.)  The Court \nrecognizes the City Defendants’ predicament in this case.  Were they to disagree with Governor \nCuomo’s Dining Policy, they would still have to comply with the directives under state law.  \n(City Br. at 8.)  But if the City Defendants chose not to comply, then, as their counsel suggested, \npenalties would likely attach.   \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 7 of 21\nrelation to [the public health] or is, beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of rights \nsecured by the fundamental law.”  Id. at 31 (emphasis added).   \n  Over a century later, Chief Justice Roberts built on Jacobson’s deferential framework in \nSouth Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 140 S. Ct. 1613 (2020).  In a concurring \nopinion denying injunctive relief to California churches against Governor Newsom’s COVID-19 \nrestrictions, the Chief Justice wrote:  \n  The precise question of when restrictions on particular social activities should be lifted  \n  during the pandemic is a dynamic and fact-intensive matter subject to reasonable \n  disagreement.  Our Constitution principally entrusts the safety and the health of the \n  people to the politically accountable officials of the States to guard and protect.  \n  Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 38 (1905).  \n \nSouth Bay, 140 S. Ct. at 1613 (cleaned up).  \n  The Supreme Court’s opinion in Jacobson and the Chief Justice’s concurrence in South \nBay can be read in differing ways.  Read narrowly, the decisions suggest that courts should take \na somewhat deferential approach to Constitutional issues that arise from the COVID-19 \npandemic.  Read broadly, however, the decisions support the proposition that during times of \npublic health crises, the full panoply of Constitutional rights ought not apply and instead, that \nJacobson’s deferential legal standard must govern.   \n  Various federal courts in New York have adopted the latter reading of Jacobson and \nSouth Bay, and rejected Constitutional challenges to Governor Cuomo’s COVID-19 restrictions.  \nSee, e.g., Young v. James, No. 20 CIV. 8252 (PAE), 2020 WL 6572798, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 26, \n2020) (rejecting First Amendment challenge to Governor Cuomo’s mask mandate because \nplaintiff did not show a “plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law”); \nColumbus Ale House, Inc. v. Cuomo, No. 20-CV-4291 (BMC), 2020 WL 6118822, at *3 \n(E.D.N.Y. Oct. 16, 2020) (applying Jacobson and rejecting Constitutional challenges to \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 8 of 21\nGovernor Cuomo’s executive order requiring restaurants to close at midnight); Geller v. Cuomo, \n476 F. Supp. 3d 1, 15 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (rejecting First Amendment challenge to social gathering \nrestrictions).   \n  Yet recent doctrinal developments from the Second Circuit and the Supreme Court have \nplaced this deferential framework in question.  The Court will address those developments now.  \nB.    Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo \n  In Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, the Supreme Court granted temporary \ninjunctive relief to New York-based religious entities against Governor Cuomo’s strict capacity \nlimits on in-person services.  141 S. Ct. 63 (2020).  In doing so, the Court assessed the plaintiffs’ \nFirst Amendment free exercise claim under a traditional Constitutional analysis and concluded \nthat strict scrutiny applied because Governor Cuomo’s religious restrictions singled out houses of \nworship.  Id. at 66–68.  Notably, the Court’s per curiam opinion did not rely on, let alone \nmention, Jacobson or the Chief Justice’s concurrence in South Bay.  Id.  \n  On remand, the Second Circuit converted the temporary injunction into a preliminary \ninjunction, and indicated that Jacobson and South Bay were no longer the correct legal \nframework for examining First Amendment free exercise challenges against COVID-19 \nrestrictions.  Agudath Israel of Am. v. Cuomo, 983 F.3d 620, 635–36 (2d Cir. 2020).  Judge Park, \nspeaking for the panel, wrote:  \n    In Jacobson, the Supreme Court upheld a mandatory vaccination law against a  \n    substantive due process challenge. Jacobson predated the modern constitutional  \n    jurisprudence of tiers of scrutiny, was decided before the First Amendment was  \n    incorporated against the states, and “did not address the free exercise of religion.”  \n    Indeed, the Jacobson Court itself specifically noted that “even if based on the  \n    acknowledged police powers of a state,” a public-health measure “must always  \n    yield in case of conflict with ... any right which [the Constitution] gives or  \n    secures.”  \n \nId. at 635.  \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 9 of 21\n  Additionally, with respect to the Chief Justice’s South Bay concurrence, Judge Park \nopined in a footnote:  \n    The district courts, motions panel, and Governor also relied heavily on the Chief  \n    Justice's concurring opinion in South Bay. Whatever persuasive value that opinion \n    may have had in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Supreme  \n    Court's decision in Roman Catholic Diocese has supplanted South Bay.   \n \nId. at n. 20. \n  Roman Catholic Diocese and Agudath Israel are binding precedent for this Court.  But \nthe scope of their rulings is unclear.  Have those decisions abrogated Jacobson’s relevance in all \nConstitutional cases arising from the pandemic?  See, e.g., Big Tyme Investments, L.L.C. v. \nEdwards, No. 20-30526, 2021 WL 118628, at *10 (5th Cir. Jan. 13, 2021) (Willet, J., \nconcurring) (arguing Jacobson has been displaced); Plaza Motors of Brooklyn, Inc., et al., v. \nCuomo, No. 20CV4851WFKSJB, 2021 WL 222121, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 22, 2021) (concluding \nJacobson had been abrogated).  Or can they be cabined to the free exercise context in which their \nholdings arose?  See Delaney v. Baker, No. CV 20-11154-WGY, 2021 WL 42340, at *12 (D. \nMass. Jan. 6, 2021) (applying both Jacobson and a traditional Constitutional analysis).     \nC.    Deferential Review \n  The Court concludes that Jacobson’s deferential standard of judicial review is still \napplicable.  Although Roman Catholic Diocese and Agudath Israel raise doubts as to Jacobson’s \ncontinuing viability, Jacobson bears directly on this case and has not been explicitly overruled, \nwhich means that this Court is bound by it.  See Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Exp., Inc., \n490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989) (“If a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet \nappears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should \nfollow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its \nown decisions.”); accord Delaney, 2021 WL 42340, at *12 (“Last month, in Roman Catholic \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 10 of 21\nDiocese of Brooklyn, the Supreme Court shed some light on this debate without resolving it.  \nWithout overruling Jacobson, the Supreme Court applied the tiers of scrutiny to enjoin the \ngovernor of New York[.]”).   \n  In addition to principles of stare decisis, the factual circumstances and legal claims in \nRoman Catholic Diocese and Agudath Israel are distinguishable from the present case.  There, \nreligious entities sought a preliminary injunction enjoining Governor Cuomo’s capacity limits on \nin-person worship services.  Roman Catholic Diocese, 141 S. Ct. at 66; Agudath Israel, 983 F.3d \nat 624–25.  As the basis for their preliminary injunction application, the plaintiffs alleged a free \nexercise claim, and demonstrated that, under a traditional Constitutional analysis, strict scrutiny \nwould apply to the capacity restrictions in question.  Roman Catholic Diocese, 141 S. Ct. at 67; \nAgudath Israel, 983 F.3d at 633.  Here, in contrast, a completely different public health \nrestriction is challenged, no free exercise claim is at issue,7 and even under a traditional \nConstitutional analysis, Plaintiffs’ claims would most likely merit rational basis review.8  See \ninfra 10–14.  Thus because these facts more directly align with those found in Jacobson, the \nCourt concludes that it must apply Jacobson’s deferential legal standard.  \n \n \n7 Some scholars have argued that religious liberty claims are distinctive and thus deserving of \ndistinctive Constitutional treatment.  See generally Michael W. McConnell, The Problem of \nSingling Out Religion, 50 DEPAUL L. REV. 1 (2000); Abner S. Greene, The Political Balance of \nthe Religion Clauses, 102 YALE L. J. 1611 (1993).  Such a view further supports distinguishing \nRoman Catholic Diocese and Agudath Israel from the present case.  \n8 On February 5, 2021, the Supreme Court granted emergency injunctive relief to California \nchurches against Governor Newsom’s ban on indoor worship services.  See S. Bay United \nPentecostal Church v. Newsom, No. 20A136, 2021 WL 406258 (U.S. Feb. 5, 2021).  The Court \nconcludes that the same reasons for distinguishing Roman Catholic Diocese and Agudath Israel \napply to this recent decision.   \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 11 of 21\n  The Court acknowledges the (growing) chorus of doubts directed at Jacobson.  As Justice \nGorsuch,9 and many others, have noted, Jacobson is over 100 years old and predates many of the \ndoctrinal developments in modern Constitutional law.  Roman Catholic Diocese, 141 S. Ct. at 70 \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring); Big Tyme Investments, 2021 WL 118628, at *10 (5th Cir. Jan. 13, \n2021) (Willet, J., concurring) (“Jacobson was decided 116 years ago. And I do not believe it \nsupplies the standard by which courts in 2021 must assess emergency public health measures.”); \nAgudath Israel, 983 F.3d at 635.  According to the Court, however, Jacobson’s modern reprise \ndespite its old age only further underscores just how unprecedented the current pandemic is and \nthe pressing need to grant state and local officials a wide berth as they “actively shap[e] their \nresponse to changing facts on the ground.”  South Bay, 140 S. Ct. at 1613–14.  Thus because \nJacobson provides a workable framework that balances the delicate considerations at play—\nresponding to the COVID-19 crisis versus maintaining Constitutional liberties—it must govern \nthis case.   \n  To be sure, while the Court defers to state and local authorities, it does not wholly \nabdicate its judicial role.  See Roman Catholic Diocese, 141 S. Ct. at 74 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring) (“But judicial deference in an emergency or a crisis does not mean wholesale \njudicial abdication.”); Lindsay F. Wiley & Stephen I. Vladeck, Coronavirus, Civil Liberties, and \nthe Courts: The Case Against “Suspending” Judicial Review, 133 HARV. L. REV. F. 179, 183 \n \n9 In Roman Catholic Diocese, Justice Gorsuch concurred in the grant of temporary injunctive \nrelief but wrote separately to explain his displeasure with district courts, such as this one, that \napplied the Constitution in a deferential way during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Roman Catholic \nDiocese, 141 S. Ct. at 71 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (“Why have some mistaken this Court’s \nmodest decision in Jacobson for a towering authority that overshadows the Constitution during a \npandemic?”).  Because the rest of the justices did not join in Justice Gorsuch’s opinion, this is \nadditional evidence that a narrow reading of Roman Catholic Diocese is in order.    \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 12 of 21\n(2020).  As discussed below, the Court analyzes the Plaintiffs’ claims under both the Jacobson \nframework as well as the traditional mode of Constitutional analysis.  However, because the \nclaims cannot succeed under either approach, Plaintiffs’ Preliminary Injunction motion must be \ndenied.     \nII.  Preliminary Injunction Standard  \n  Where, as here, an injunction “will affect government action taken in the public interest \npursuant to a statute or regulatory scheme, the moving party must demonstrate (1) irreparable \nharm absent injunctive relief, (2) a likelihood of success on the merits, and (3) public interest \nweighing in favor of granting the injunction.”10  Agudath Israel, 983 F.3d at 631 (cleaned up); \nsee Murray v. Cuomo, 460 F. Supp. 3d 430, 442 (S.D.N.Y. 2020).   \nIII.  Likelihood of Success  \n  In support of their motion for a Preliminary Injunction, the Plaintiffs claim that the \nDining Policy violates (1) the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause; (2) the Dormant \nCommerce Clause; and (3) the First Amendment.  To prevail on these Constitutional claims \nunder Jacobson, the Plaintiffs must show that the Dining Policy “has no real or substantial \nrelation” to the public welfare and that it is “beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of \n \n10 Governor Cuomo contends that a heightened standard of proof on the Preliminary Injunction \nfactors is warranted given that the Plaintiffs seek a mandatory injunction—injunctive relief that \nalters the status quo.  See Tom Doherty Assocs., Inc. v. Saban Entm't, Inc., 60 F.3d 27, 33 (2d \nCir. 1995).  Under the mandatory injunction standard, the Plaintiffs would have to prove “a clear \nor substantial likelihood of success on the merits, and make a strong showing of irreparable \nharm.”  New York ex rel. Schneiderman v. Actavis PLC, 787 F.3d 638, 650 (2d Cir. 2015) \n(cleaned up).  It is unclear, however, whether the mandatory injunction standard applies in cases \ninvolving Constitutional challenges to COVID-19 restrictions.  See Agudath Israel, 983 F.3d at \n631 (declining to apply heightened standard).  In any event, the Court need not decide this issue \nbecause even without the heightened standard, the Plaintiffs cannot prevail on their Preliminary \nInjunction application.  \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 13 of 21\nrights secured by fundamental law.”  197 U.S. at 31.   \n  Plaintiffs do not meet Jacobson’s standard.  The Dining Policy bears a relation to the \npublic welfare by seeking to curb the transmission of COVID-19 in higher risk settings such as \nrestaurants.  See Columbus Ale, 2020 WL 6118822, at *4; Luke's Catering Serv., LLC v. Cuomo, \nNo. 20-CV-1086S, 2020 WL 5425008, at *7 (W.D.N.Y. Sept. 10, 2020).  Moreover, Plaintiffs \nhave not shown that the Dining Policy is “beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of \nrights secured by fundamental law.”  Jacobson, U.S. at 31.  On the contrary, their requested \nrelief—50% of indoor dining and extension of the dining curfew to midnight—implicitly \nconcedes that public health regulation of restaurants, in view of the pandemic, is constitutional.  \nBut because the constitutionality of the Dining Policy cannot turn on granular distinctions (such \nas two additional hours of dining service or a 50% increase in capacity limits), the Court \nconcludes that the Plaintiffs’ claims are unlikely to succeed under Jacobson.  \n  Alternatively, even if the Court were to analyze the Plaintiffs’ claims under a traditional \nConstitutional analysis, the same conclusion would obtain.   \n  Fourteenth Amendment Claim:  Plaintiffs cannot make out a viable substantive or \nprocedural due process claim under the Fourteenth Amendment.  First, it is black letter law that a \nperson is not entitled to procedural due process protections against government action that is \nlegislative in nature.  See Bi-Metallic Inv. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 239 U.S. 441, 445 \n(1915).  A government action is legislative if it has “general application” and looks to the future.  \nInterport Pilots Agency, Inc. v. Sammis, 14 F.3d 133, 143 (2d Cir. 1994).  Here, the Dining \nPolicy is clearly legislative as it applies generally to all restaurants across New York and New \nYork City, and because it applies prospectively.  Id.  Thus Plaintiffs’ procedural due process \nchallenge fails.  See Hund v. Cuomo, No. 20-CV-1176 (JLS), 2020 WL 6699524, at *11 \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 14 of 21\n(W.D.N.Y. Nov. 13, 2020) (rejecting procedural due process challenge against Governor \nCuomo’s policy restricting live music in public).   \n  Second, Plaintiffs’ substantive due process challenge is also likely to fail on the merits.  \nThe doctrine of substantive due process “protects individuals against two types of government \naction”:  (1) action that shocks the conscience or (2) action that “interferes with rights implicit in \nthe concept of ordered liberty.”  United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 746 (1987) (cleaned up).  \nAt oral argument, the Court asked the Plaintiffs:  “What is so shocking about, in the middle of a \npandemic, taking a public restaurant and saying, you can’t be open?”  (Oral Arg. Tr. at 8.)  In \nresponse, the Plaintiffs alleged in conclusory fashion that the Dining Policy shocked the \nconscience because it went against the grain of scientific proof.  (Id. at 8–9.)  Such averments, \nhowever, simply do not satisfy the high bar that is the “shock the conscience” standard.  Cf. \nRochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 172 (1952) (officers forcibly pumping suspect’s stomach for \nmorphine capsules found to “shock the conscience”); Hefferan v. Corda, 498 F. App'x 86, 89 (2d \nCir. 2012) (stating that “arbitrary” and “outrageous” Government action satisfies shock the \nconscience standard).  In these circumstances, however, the Court cannot say that the Dining \nPolicy shocks the conscience. \n  Neither have Plaintiffs shown an interference with a fundamental right “implicit in the \nconcept of ordered liberty” that would justify a heightened standard of review.  Salerno, 481 \nU.S. at 746; United States v. Carolene Prod. Co., 304 U.S. 144, 153 n. 4 (1938).  The liberty \ninterest Plaintiffs assert is their right to transact business in their restaurants without restriction \nfrom the Dining Policy.  While this argument may have prevailed at an earlier time, the Supreme \nCourt has, for nearly a century, consistently rejected economic liberties as constituting \nfundamental rights.  See West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379, 391 (1937) (“The \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 15 of 21\nConstitution does not speak of freedom of contract. It speaks of liberty and prohibits the \ndeprivation of liberty without due process of law. In prohibiting that deprivation, the \nConstitution does not recognize an absolute and uncontrollable liberty.”); see also Williamson v. \nLee Optical of Oklahoma Inc., 348 U.S. 483, 488 (1955) (“The day is gone when this Court uses \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to strike down state laws, regulatory of \nbusiness and industrial conditions, because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony \nwith a particular school of thought.”); New Motor Vehicle Bd. of California v. Orrin W. Fox Co., \n439 U.S. 96, 107 (1978); Columbus Ale House, 2020 WL 6118822, at *4.  In sum, Plaintiffs are \nunlikely to succeed on their claims under the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n  Dormant Commerce Clause Claim:  The Court also finds Plaintiffs’ Dormant Commerce \nClause claim to be without merit.  The guiding principle behind the Dormant Commerce Clause \nis that the Constitution “prohibits state taxation or regulation that discriminates against or unduly \nburdens interstate commerce and thereby impedes free private trade in the national marketplace.”  \nGen. Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 287 (1997) (cleaned up); see Selevan v. New York \nThruway Auth., 584 F.3d 82, 90 (2d Cir. 2009).  To prove a Dormant Commerce Clause \nviolation, the Plaintiffs must show that the Dining Policy:  \n(1) clearly discriminates against interstate commerce in favor of intrastate commerce,  \n \n(2) imposes a burden on interstate commerce incommensurate with the local benefits \nsecured, or  \n \n(3) has the practical effect of extraterritorial control of commerce occurring entirely \noutside the boundaries of the state in question.  \n \nSelevan, 584 F.3d at 90 (cleaned up).   \n  Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed under any of these theories.  First, because the Dining \nPolicy only applies to restaurants in New York and New York City, it neither “discriminates” \n15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 16 of 21\nagainst interstate commerce nor has the “practical effect” of exerting “extraterritorial control” \nover it.  Id.; see Michigan Rest. & Lodging Ass'n v. Gordon, No. 1:20-CV-1104, 2020 WL \n6866649, at *3 (W.D. Mich. Nov. 20, 2020) (holding that Michigan Governor’s COVID-19 \nrestriction on restaurant dining did not violate Dormant Commerce Clause because “it does not \nclose restaurants and bars beyond Michigan’s borders”).  Second, even assuming that the Dining \nPolicy has imposed incidental burdens on interstate commerce—for example, on out-of-state \nrestaurant suppliers or interstate travelers—the Plaintiffs have not shown that these burdens are \n“incommensurate” with the local benefit of mitigating further transmission of the COVID-19 \nvirus.  See Selevan, 584 F.3d at 80; Plaza Motors, 2021 WL 222121, at *7 (rejecting Dormant \nCommerce Clause challenge against Governor Cuomo’s restrictions on automobile dealers); \nSavage v. Mills, No. 1:20-CV-00165-LEW, 2020 WL 4572314, at *6 (D. Me. Aug. 7, 2020) \n(rejecting Dormant Commerce Clause challenge to Maine’s quarantine order).  Therefore, \nPlaintiffs have not shown a likelihood of success on their Dormant Commerce Clause claim.  \n  First Amendment Claim:  Finally, the Plaintiffs’ First Amendment freedom of assembly \nclaim is also unlikely to succeed on the merits.  The Supreme Court has stated that social \nassociations—like the ones Plaintiffs complain about—do not come within the ambit of First \nAmendment protection.11  See City of Dallas v. Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19, 25 (1989) (“[W]e do not \nthink the Constitution recognizes a generalized right of ‘social association’ that includes chance \nencounters in dance halls.”); see also Michaelidis v. Berry, 502 F. App'x 94, 96 (2d Cir. 2012) \n \n11 The ostensible flaw with the Plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim is that state and local \ngovernments have traditionally been allowed to regulate restaurants in accordance with their \npolice powers.  Just as they may promulgate regulations regarding health and sanitary standards, \ndietary caloric disclosures, number of patrons, and hours of operation, so too can they regulate \npublic health standards in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Therefore, the state’s police powers \nwould seem to apply a fortiori in the context of a global pandemic.   \n16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 17 of 21\n(“Plaintiffs’ relationships with their landlords, their restaurant customers, and their employees \nare not sufficiently intimate to implicate this [First Amendment] protection.”); H's Bar, LLC v. \nBerg, No. 20-CV-1134-SMY, 2020 WL 6827964, at *4–5 (S.D. Ill. Nov. 21, 2020) (denying \npreliminary injunction against Illinois Governor’s restaurant dining restrictions and rejecting \nright to assembly challenge); Amato v. Elicker, 460 F. Supp. 3d 202, 219 (D. Conn. 2020) \n(same).  Plaintiffs thus are unlikely to succeed on their First Amendment challenge.   \n  Rational Basis Review:  Because none of the Plaintiffs’ Constitutional claims are viable, \nthe Court must apply rational basis review.  The Dining Policy undeniably passes rational basis \nscrutiny:  It is premised on a conceivable scientific basis that is rationally related to mitigating \nthe further spread of the COVID-19 virus.  Columbus Ale, 2020 WL 6118822, at *3 n. 8; see \nReno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 306 (1993) (“Government action satisfies rational basis scrutiny if \nit “rationally advance[es] some legitimate government purpose”).  The Court therefore concludes \nthat even if Jacobson did not apply, a traditional Constitutional analysis would yield the same \nconclusion.   \nIV.  Irreparable Harm  \n  In addition to demonstrating the likelihood of success on the merits, the Plaintiffs must \nalso show irreparable harm in the absence of a Preliminary Injunction.  Irreparable harm must be \nimminent and incapable of being cured by monetary remedies.  See Shapiro v. Cadman Towers, \n51 F.3d 328, 332 (2d Cir. 1995).   \n  The Plaintiffs contend that the Dining Policy will lead to their businesses’ demise and \nthat this constitutes irreparable harm.  The Second Circuit has recognized that a “threat to the \ncontinued existence of a business can constitute irreparable injury.”  John B. Hull, Inc. v. \nWaterbury Petroleum Prod., Inc., 588 F.2d 24, 28 (2d Cir. 1978).  The problem here, however, is \n17 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 18 of 21\nthat the Plaintiffs have not proffered any evidence on the record showing that their respective \nestablishments are imminently likely to shut down because of the Dining Policy.  See id. at 28 \n(requiring evidentiary support for claim that establishment “would go out of business”).    \n  In truth, Plaintiffs’ real injuries in this case are the substantial losses in revenue caused by \nthe COVID-19 pandemic and its accompanying restrictions.  As the majority of New Yorkers \ndecide to play it safe and dine at home during the pandemic, restaurants across the state—and \nespecially in New York City—have had to endure substantial losses in revenue.  These injuries \nare palpable; their significance is not lost on this Court.  But as it pertains to the law, the \nPlaintiffs’ injuries constitute monetary damages, which are not grounds for a Preliminary \nInjunction.  See Wisdom Imp. Sales Co. v. Labatt Brewing Co., 339 F.3d 101, 113–14 (2d Cir. \n2003) (“[O]nly harm shown to be non-compensable in terms of money damages provides the \nbasis for awarding injunctive relief.”).  Therefore, the irreparable harm factor weighs against a \nPreliminary Injunction.   \nV.  Public Interest \n  The final Preliminary Injunction factor is the public interest.  The Supreme Court has \nrecognized that, “Stemming the spread of COVID-19 is unquestionably a compelling interest.”  \nRoman Catholic Diocese, 141 S. Ct. at 67.  The question here is whether the Dining Policy \neffectuates that compelling interest.  It does.  Therefore, the public interest factor weighs against \nthe issuance of a Preliminary Injunction. \n  The Plaintiffs concede that Governor Cuomo’s evidentiary submission—Dr. Debra \nBlog’s affidavit—is true.12  (Oral Arg. Tr. at 20.)  However, they contend that Dr. Blog’s \n \n12 Following oral argument, Plaintiffs attempted to discredit Dr. Blog’s testimony in \nsupplemental filings before the Court.  (See Pls.’ Supp. Br. at 10–15, ECF 45.)  Because \nPlaintiffs adopted the entirety of Dr. Blog’s affidavit as their own during oral argument, (Oral \n18 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 19 of 21\ntestimony lends support for their Preliminary Injunction application because none of the indoor \ndining risks she mentions applies to their restaurants.  (Id. at 20–21; Pls.’ Reply at 2–4.)  \nAccording to the Plaintiffs, their establishments have been outfitted with state-of-the-art \nventilation systems that mitigate the spread of COVID-19.  (Khatibi Decl. ¶ 5, ECF 19; Pls.’ \nReply at 4.)  Thus because dining at their establishments is safer than social gatherings at private \nhomes, they contend that a Preliminary Injunction is in the public’s interest.    \n  The Court is unpersuaded by this argument for two reasons.  First, Plaintiffs have not \nsubmitted any evidence, besides their own assurances, that demonstrates the efficacy of their \nventilation systems.13  Moreover, their theory that reopening restaurants will save lives by \naverting indoor social gatherings is similarly lacking in evidentiary support.  While it may be \ntrue that private social gatherings currently account for a major source of transmission, the \nPlaintiffs have offered little evidence suggesting that re-opening indoor dining will directly \ndecrease such gatherings.14  (See Pls.’ Supp. Br. at 16, ECF 45) (“There is no data or information \n \nArg. Tr. at 20), these arguments must be set aside.  Moreover, upon reviewing Dr. Blog’s \ndeposition transcripts, the Court concludes that nothing in her testimony contradicts her original \naffidavit submitted to the Court.   \n13 To demonstrate the effectiveness of their ventilation systems, the Plaintiffs cite a scientific \nreport from another court proceeding that purports to show “air exchange in indoor dining \nvenues in the Western New York Area.”  (Pls.’ Supp. Br. at 17–18.)  Because the study was \nconducted in a different part of the state (western New York) and did not analyze Plaintiffs’ \nspecific venues, the evidence is inapposite.  \n14 The Plaintiffs argue that when restaurants are closed, the “logical assumption” is that people \n“retreat to their homes” where they contribute to the transmission of the virus.  (Pls. Supp. Br. at \n16.)  And they argue that “when indoor dining is closed, the spread of virus has gone up.”  (Id.)  \nThis argument is not based on scientific fact, but on speculative deductive reasoning.  The rise in \nCOVID-19 infections, during periods of restaurant closures, is affected by a multiplicity of \nfactors.  (Blog Dep. Tr. 37: 17–19, ECF 45-3.)  Accordingly, it is conjecture to claim that closing \nrestaurant dining is the sole—or substantial—cause of increasing COVID-19 infections.  \n19 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 20 of 21\nthat defines what people do when restaurants are closed.”)  \n  Second, even assuming that Dr. Blog’s affidavit is consistent with the injunctive relief \nsought by the Plaintiffs, the ultimate arbiter of public health in New York is Governor Cuomo, \nnot Dr. Blog.  And here, Governor Cuomo has made the deliberate decision to take sweeping \nmeasures in response to a second surge of infections across the state.  His policies may be subject \nto “reasonable disagreement”; however, the “Constitution principally entrusts the safety and the \nhealth of the people to the politically accountable officials of the State to guard and protect.”  \nSouth Bay, 140 S. Ct. at 1613.  Accordingly, the Court cannot quarterback the state’s response to \nthe COVID-19 pandemic from the bench.     \n  In the end, the Court finds the public interest factor to tip heavily towards denying the \nPreliminary Injunction motion.  As noted above, the lives lost to the pandemic are legion.  See \nsupra at 2.  Many of these deaths have been suffered by those most vulnerable in our society:  \nthe elderly and the infirm.  And in addition to the costs to human life, the pandemic has affected \nhow people live and work, and how they interact with loved ones—in short, everything that \nmakes life worth living.   \nTo preserve the public health and mitigate further needless death, Governor Cuomo took \ndrastic steps aimed at stopping the spread of the COVID-19 virus.  He was entitled to take these \nmeasures pursuant to the police powers delegated to the legislative and executive branches.  As \nJustice Kagan recently noted, the judiciary must not inject “uncertainty into an area where \nuncertainty has human costs.”  S. Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, No. 20A136, 2021 \nWL 406258, at *6 (U.S. Feb. 5, 2021) (Kagan, J., dissenting).  Accordingly, because principles \nof federalism, separation of powers, and judicial modesty demand that the Court respect \nGovernor Cuomo’s policy decision, the motion for a Preliminary Injunction must be denied.    \n20 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 57   Filed 02/09/21   Page 21 of 21\nCONCLUSION  \n  The motion for a Preliminary Injunction is DENIED.  The Clerk of Court is directed to \nterminate the motion at ECF 16.   \nGovernor Cuomo and the City Defendants are directed to respond to the Complaint \npursuant to this Court’s order entered on February 3, 2021.  \n    \nDated: New York, New York       SO ORDERED \nFebruary 9, 2021 \n                       \n              HONORABLE PAUL A.

R. Civ. P. 65, granting a Temporary Restraining Order barring \nGovernor  Cuomo  and  Mayor  de  Blasio’s  enforcement  of  Executive  Order  202.81  and  the \ndirectives contained in Executive Orders 202.61 as continued in Executive Order 202.79, and \nscheduling an expedited hearing as to why a preliminary injunction should not be entered, as well \nas other equitable relief.  \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n  Nearly (6) months have passed since COVID-19 became a part of our collective lexicon. \nDuring that time, the State’s government, led by Governor Cuomo, exclusively wielding all the \npower of the State’s legislation, we have witnessed the historic collapse of the State’s economy, \nthe death of 1 out of 6 restaurants and the largest profits in history by some of the largest grocery \nchains in the country. As the virus advances and withdraws like a well-positioned invading force, \nour government has failed to identify and develop a least “restrictive means” of operating the \nState’s economy while mitigating the spread of the virus. \n  New York State Executive Law § 29-a of Article 2(b) authorizes the issuance of executive \norders with all the authority of a law introduced and enacted through traditional processes for as \nlong as the executive order remains in effect. Executive orders are subject to the state constitution, \nthe federal constitution as well as federal statutes and regulations.  The Executive Orders, and the \nrestrictions that were born from them, were initially effective in slowing the spread of the virus, \nare not a long-term solution. These restrictions violate the Constitutional rights of the citizens \nwithout affording due process of the law. \nThe restrictions are not enforced evenly as the State and city governments employ different \nmethods of calculating the positivity rate of the virus, which in turn is used to determine when, \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 17   Filed 12/30/20   Page 7 of 20\nand to what extent restrictions are levied against a region of the State. The discrepancies that exist \nbetween the State’s calculations and registration of new positive cases of the virus, versus the \nmethods employed by the New York City are cause for an injunction without further evidence. \nSee Complaint at ¶¶ 72 – 80. The effect of this unequal application of the laws is that restaurants \nlocated in New York City are forced to close or severely alter their operations, while similar \nbusinesses outside of New York City continue to operate and profit. On its face one may assume \nfrom the enforcement of the restrictions that those restaurants located in New York City have \nhigher overall transmission rates, when in fact, this is not the case at all. Further, the Orders drive \npeople into their homes, where small gatherings have been shown to be one of the highest \ntransmission environments. See Compl. ¶ 41 \nPlaintiffs have undertaken and successfully created an indoor ventilation protocol that is \nsupported by decades of science and whose premise (although altered for specific use) is employed \nby the airlines who have been permitted to operate with near impunity since the early days of the \npandemic. See Compl. ¶ 111(iii) \n \n  Movants respectfully request that this Court intervene by issuing the temporary restraining \norder and other equitable relief sought herein to prevent the Governor Cuomo and Mayor De Blasio \nfrom further violations of Movants’ state and federally protected rights, as a means of ensuring \nthat businesses like that of Movant d/b/a Seaport House (Hopkins Hawley) are permitted to remain \nopen to indoor dining immediately, or in the alternative to keep outdoor dining open until 12:30 \na.m. on New Year’s Eve, and to force the Governor and the Mayor of New York to inspect the \nventilation upgrades implemented by Movants to determine their efficacy at mitigating the spread \nof the virus and in doing so engage with Movants and others towards establishing effective \nventilation protocols that may be implemented across the state.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 17   Filed 12/30/20   Page 8 of 20\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n  The facts relevant to this application are fully set forth in the attached Declaration of d/b/a \nSeaport House, dated December 29, 2020 (the “Seaport Decl.”), the Declaration of The Greater \nNew York Merchants’ Alliance, dated December 29, 2020 (the “GNYMA Decl.”), the Declaration \nof Costin Tarsoaga, dated December 29, 2020 (the “CT Decl.”) and the Complaint filed December \n25, 2020, with attached exhibits. For the sake of efficiency, only those facts necessary to conduct \nthe analysis below will be reproduced herein.  \nA. Defendants’ Restrictions are not the “Least Restrictive Means” of satisfying the \nGovernment’s interests \n \nGovernor Cuomo’s Executive Orders (most recently 202.81 (202.79)) target restaurant \nowners and businesses like the Plaintiffs and others similarly situated. These business owners, \ntheir employees and families will suffer the loss of revenue and the potential of losing businesses \nand jobs, and healthcare, simply because the Governor has decided that restaurants and bars must \ncompletely shut down indoor dining (allowing only outdoor dining in the blistering cold winter \nseason). See Compl. ¶ 34. There is no scientific evidence that the Governor’s restrictions as they \nare administered, will have any tangible impact on the transmission of the virus. In fact, there is \nsignificant evidence that closing indoor dining results in greater “small gatherings” which in turn \nlead to spikes in the positivity rate. \nThe  Movants,  at  their  own  expense  have  researched  the  most  scientifically  proven \nventilation systems to reduce and otherwise eliminate the transmission of the virus in enclosed \nenvironments, created a functional blueprint of the design, and implemented these modifications \nin their establishment. (See Compl. Exhibit A). An upgraded ventilation system working in \nconjunction with operating procedures such as social distancing and maintaining adequate fresh \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 17   Filed 12/30/20   Page 9 of 20\nair flow, could lead to a “Best Practices” protocol that could permit restaurants and similar \nestablishments to open and operate, while protecting patrons from deadly small gatherings.  \nB.  Defendant’s Administer Restrictions Unequally and at their Discretion \nGovernor Cuomo and Mayor De Blasio have varied methods of calculating the daily positivity \nrate which triggers the issuance of restrictions pursuant to the Governor’s orders. The State counts \nboth antigen and polymerase chain reaction (” PCR”) tests. Which will produce a lower percentage \nof positive tests. New York City does not include antigen tests in its positivity count, opting to \nexclusively use PCR tests which are more sensitive and produce higher incidents of positive \nresults. Antigen tests are known to miss positive tests in people carrying relatively insignificant \namounts of the virus where many public health experts have stated that PCR tests are too sensitive. \nSee Compl. ¶¶ 64, 65.  \nThe State and New York City each report new positive cases in a different manner which \nmanipulates the underlying positivity rate. The State treats a new case as arising on the day the test \nresults came in. New York City dates each new case to the day the sample was provided. So, if an \ninfected person goes to a clinic to have his nose swabbed on Monday, that sample is often delivered \nto a laboratory where it is tested. If those results are reported to the health authorities on \nWednesday, the State and city would record it differently. The State would include it with \nWednesday’s tally of new cases, while the city would add it to Monday’s column. The 3 % \nthreshold is based on a seven-day rolling average. The day that a new case is registered is of \nmaximum importance in determining an accurate positivity rate. See Compl. ¶ 66.  \nThese subtle but effective manipulations of the positivity rate have had the tangible impact of \nNew York City restaurants languishing under restrictions constantly while operators in other cities \nand counties across the State remain open. The administration of the restrictions is unequally \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 17   Filed 12/30/20   Page 10 of 20\nenforced against New York City restaurants although with the current variations in calculation and \nreporting, there is no way to discern if these restricted regions are in fact experiencing higher \npositivity rates.  \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  Legal Standard \nUnder Fed. R. Civ. P. 65, in order to obtain a preliminary injunction, a moving party must \nshow: 1) “a likelihood of success on the merits or ...... sufficiently serious questions going to the \nmerits to make them fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in the \nplaintiff’s favor”; (2) a likelihood of “irreparable injury in the absence of an injunction”; (3) that \n“the balance of hardships the plaintiff’s favor”; and (4) that the public interest would not be \ndisserved.” See Benihana, Inc. v. Benihana of Tokyo, LLC, 784 F. 3d 887, 894-95 (2d Cir. 2015) \n(initial citations omitted). The Temporary restraining order standard is the same. See, e.g., Echo \nDesign Grp. V. Zino Davidoff S.A., 283 F. Supp. 2d 963, 966 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).  \nII.  Plaintiffs Satisfy the Requirements for a TRO and Preliminary Injunction \n \nA. Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits \nTo establish a likelihood of success on the merits, a plaintiff “need not show that success \nis certain, only that the probability of prevailing is ‘better than fifty percent’”. BigStar Entm’t, Inc. \nv. Next Big Star, Inc., 105 F. Supp. 2d 185, 191 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (quoting Abdul Wali v. Coughlin, \n754 F.2d 1015, 1025 (2d Cir. 1985)). Plaintiffs can also satisfy the alternative test of “sufficiently \nserious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation” given that the \nbalance of hardships stemming from any limited and temporary relief tips decidedly in their favor. \nSee Benihana, 784 F.3d at 894-95.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 17   Filed 12/30/20   Page 11 of 20\nIn the case at bar, the restrictions imposed by Governor Cuomo and enforced by Mayor De \nBlasio and others have led to ongoing violations of a variety of the Plaintiff’s rights that are \nprotected by state and federal laws and their respective constitutions. The Movants have had their \nlivelihoods obliterated based on scientific metrics that vary from one city or county to the next and \npunish New York City restaurants at a far more aggressive pace than any other area of the State. \nSee Compl. ¶¶ 63-71. The Movants have not been afforded, a process or procedure at law to remedy \nthe  ongoing  deprivations  that  they,  their  employees,  and  patrons  continue  to  suffer.  The \nGovernor’s Orders and the restrictions that they embody are violations of the Dormant Commerce \nClause (see Compl. ¶¶ 120 – 128), 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution (Due Process Clause) (see  Compl. ¶¶ 130 – 145), and these restrictions are a \ndeprivation of the fundamental right to publicly assemble and protest the government. See Compl. \n¶¶ 109 – 118 \ni.  42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \nIn order to maintain an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, two essential elements must be \npresent. The conduct complained of must have been committed by a person acting under color of \nstate law and must have deprived a person of rights, privileges or immunities secured by the \nConstitution or laws of the United States. See Pitchell v. Callan,13 F.3d 545, 547 (2d Cir. 1994), \nsee also Niemann v. Whalen, 911 F. Supp. 656, 663 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) A private defendant may only \nbe held liable under § 1983 as \"a willful participant in joint activity with the State or its \nagents.\" Adickes  v.  S.H.  Kress  Co., 398  U.S.  144,  152, 90  S.Ct.  1598,  1605, 26  L.Ed.2d \n142 (1970). The plaintiff bears the burden of proof on this issue, see Scheiner v. Wallace, 860 F. \nSupp. 991, 999 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), and must produce more than conclusory allegations or naked \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 17   Filed 12/30/20   Page 12 of 20\nassertions  of  joint  or  conspiratorial  action. See  Doe  v.  Smith, 704  F.  Supp.  1177,  1188-\n89 (S.D.N.Y. 1988).  \nGovernor Cuomo and Mayor De Blasio are state officials who, when sued in their official \ncapacity for injunctive relief, would be a \"person\" under § 1983. See Will v. Michigan Dep't of \nState Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 n. 10 (1989); Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 167 n. 14 (1985). \nIn addition, Plaintiffs' complaint sufficiently alleges that Governor Cuomo and Mayor De Blasio \nacted under the color of state law. See West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 49 (1988) (\"The traditional \ndefinition of acting under color of state law requires that the defendant in a Section(s) 1983 action \nhave exercised power possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the \nwrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law\"). (internal quotation omitted). Finally, \nplaintiffs' complaint alleges that the defendants' conduct deprived plaintiffs of a right secured by \nthe Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. See Haley v. Pataki, 106 F.3d 478, \n482 (2d Cir. 1997) \nThere  is  no  controversy  that  Governor  Cuomo’s  alleged  actions  in  violation  of  the \nConstitutionally protected rights of the Plaintiffs, acted under the color of state law pursuant to \nNew York Executive Law § 29(a) of Article 2(b), and that Mayor De Blasio’s actions are \nauthorized by the Governor in his official capacity. There is also no controversy that as a direct \nresult of the Governor’s issuance of the Executive Orders and the enforcement of the restrictions \ntherefrom, the Plaintiffs and citizens across the State have suffered immeasurable losses without \nthe benefit of due process of law. See  Petrella  v. Siegel, 843 F.2d 87, 89 (2d Cir. 1988) \n(\"Regardless of possible state law remedies, interference with such a right without due process \nprotections is a violation of the fourteenth amendment subject to redress under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\"), \nsee also Carfora v. City of New York, 705 F. Supp. 1007, 1008 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (\"In order to state \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 17   Filed 12/30/20   Page 13 of 20\na claim for a violation of the Due Process Clause under § 1983, plaintiff must allege the deprivation \nunder color of state law of a constitutionally protected right without due process.\")  \n  In the current case, the Defendants behavior is the proximate cause of the deprivations of \nMovants’ Constitutional rights without the benefit of due process. Further, living under the \nconstant threat of the loss of liberties at the whim of the State’s Governor and New York City’s \nMayor, the Movants’ CORE CONSTITUTIONAL rights are constantly under attack.   \nii.  Due Process Clause \n \nTo maintain a due process claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he/she was deprived of \na protected right. See Anderson v. Marr, 10 Civ. 818 (SHS) (FM), at *21 (S.D.N.Y. July 18, 2011) \n(\"As noted previously, to state a procedural due process claim, a plaintiff first must demonstrate \nthat he was deprived of a liberty interest.\")  Mayer v. Wing, 922 F. Supp. 902, 911 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) \n(\"Thus, Plaintiffs can prevail on this claim if they can demonstrate that they have been denied due \nprocess.\"). In the current case, Plaintiffs allege several violations of their Constitutional and \nprotected rights, and that Defendants have deprived them of those rights without the benefit of due \nprocess.  \n The Movant must show that the right allegedly denied arises under a federal law providing \nfor specific civil rights and that the Movant is denied or cannot enforce the specified federal rights \nin the state court. Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U.S. 780, 788 (1966) (holding that removal under § 1443 \nof the defendants' state criminal prosecution for trespass was proper, because the very act of \nprosecuting them for non-forcibly seeking admittance to restaurants open to the public violated the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964); Greenwood v. Peacock, 384 U.S. 808, 828 (1966) (holding that removal \nis unavailable if  the defendant’s conduct is not protected by the federal law); Greenberg v. \nVeteran, 889 F.2d 418, 421 (2d Cir. 1989); Whatley v. City of Vidalia, 399 F.2d 521, 526 (5th Cir. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 17   Filed 12/30/20   Page 14 of 20\n1968) (interpreting essentially identical language contained in the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § \n1973i(b), and held that the mere bringing of the action in state court would deny these defendants \ntheir federally protected right if they could establish that the action was brought against them \nbecause of their exercise of their federal right to assist others in registering to vote).  \nThe is no question that Plaintiffs’ rights that have been violated are protected by the United \nStates Constitution and federal laws. The Defendants violated the due process clause of the \nConstitution and continue to do so as long as the Executive Orders remain in effect.  \niii.  Dormant Commerce Clause \n \nIn order to assert a violation of the dormant commerce clause a plaintiff must show that the \nState’s Executive Orders affect and otherwise control commerce outside of the State’s borders. \nThe Commerce Clause provides that \"Congress shall have Power . . . [t]o regulate Commerce with \nforeign Nations, and among the several States.\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3. The Supreme Court \nhas explained that \"the [Commerce] Clause was designed in part to prevent trade barriers that had \nundermined efforts of the fledgling States to form a cohesive whole following their victory in the \nRevolution.\" Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U.S. 794, 807, 96 S.Ct. 2488, 49 L.Ed.2d \n220 (1976). In the eloquent words of Justice Jackson,  \n“Our system, fostered by the Commerce Clause, is that every farmer and every \ncraftsman shall be encouraged to produce by the certainty that he will have free \naccess to every market in the Nation, that no home embargoes will with-hold his \nexport, and no foreign state will by customs duties or regulations exclude them. \nLikewise, every consumer may look to the free competition from every producing \narea in the Nation to protect him from exploitation by any. Such was the vision of \nthe Founders; such has been the doctrine of [the Supreme] Court which has given \nit reality.” \n \n\"As the Second Circuit made clear in Freedom Holdings, to prevail on the dormant commerce \nclause claim, Plaintiff must show that the restraints have 'the practical effect of controlling \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 17   Filed 12/30/20   Page 15 of 20\ncommerce occurring wholly outside that State's borders.'\") See Grand River Enterprises Six \nNations, Ltd. v. King, 02 Civ. 5068 (JFK), at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 14, 2008).  \nIn  the  case  at  bar,  the  State’s  orders  and  restrictions  discriminate  against  interstate \ncommerce. See Hertz Corp. v. City of New York, 1 F.3d 121, 131 (2d Cir. 1993) (\"To make out a \nclaim that this regulation impermissibly burdens the commerce clause, Hertz must sufficiently \nplead that the local law discriminates against interstate commerce either on its face, or in its \neffect.\"). On its face, the Governor’s Executive Orders place interstate commerce under the \nGovernor’s control and prevents the free flow of commerce between State business owners and \nout of state business owners. \niv.  First Amendment: Right to Assemble \n \nIt is fundamental that our constitutions accord to the citizen of the United States the right \nof freedom of speech and of assembly and to peaceably petition for a redress of grievances. Such \nfreedoms are jealously guarded and when exercised in good faith and in good order may not be \nlawfully interfered with by governmental action. See Jacoby v. Presiding Justices of the First, \nSecond, Third & Fourth Dep'ts, Appellate Div. of the Supreme Court of N.Y., 852 F.3d 178, 185 \n(2d Cir. 2017) (\"The First Amendment prohibits the enactment of any law 'abridging ... the right \nof the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.'\")  \nIn the current case, the imposition of the State’s restrictions is a violation of the Movants’ \nFirst Amendment Right to Assemble. See Rockwell v. Town of Hamden, 18-3724-cv, at *2 (2d Cir. \nApr. 8, 2020) (\"The First Amendment protects the right to peaceably assemble.\"). The Movants \nhave properly ventilated their establishments, at their cost. They have designed and implemented \nscientifically proven methods of mitigating the transmission of the virus. The Government’s \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 17   Filed 12/30/20   Page 16 of 20\ncontinued deprivation of the Movant’s rights without regard for the actual circumstances rises to \na violation of the Movant’s First Amendment Right to Assemble.  \n \nIII.  Absent an Injunction, Plaintiffs will be Irreparably Injured  \n \nA temporary restraining order is designed to preserve the status quo. “The purpose of a \ntemporary restraining order is to preserve an existing situation in status quo until the court has an \nopportunity to pass upon the merits of the demand for a preliminary injunction.” Pan Am. World \nAirways Inc. v. Flight Eng'rs Int'l Ass'n, 306 F.2d 840, 842-43 (2d Cir. 1962). The Plaintiffs and \nthose who are similarly situated are business owners, employers and members of a community that \nis being decimated by a relentless virus and a power thirsty/inept Government.  The current \ncircumstances threaten to kill even more restaurants in the New York City area while foregoing \nthe same level of devastating impact on other parts of the State. The timing of this application is \ncritical as New Year’s Eve approaches and without intervention, untold numbers of citizens will \nbe driven into small gatherings where positivity rates are known to skyrocket (GRANTING OF \nTHIS TRO WOULD SAVE COUNTLESS LIVES OF NEW YORK CITY RESIDENTS).  \nSecond Circuit law recognizes that “[a] threat to the continued existence of a business can \nconstitute irreparable injury.” John B. Hull, Inc. v. Waterbury Prods., Inc., 588 F.2d 24, 28-29 (2d \nCir. 1978) (citing Semmes Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 429 F.2d 1197, 1205 (2d Cir. 1970)). \nA threatened loss of good will also supports a finding of irreparable injury. See Register.com v. \nVerio, Inc., 356 F.3d 393, 404 (2d Cir. 2004) (affirming finding that loss of reputation, good will, \nand business opportunities constituted irreparable harm). \nTo demonstrate irreparable harm, a plaintiff must show an injury that is “actual and \nimminent” and “cannot be remedied by an award of monetary damages.” Shapiro v. Cadman \nTowers, Inc., 51 F.3d 328, 332 (2d Cir. 1995) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). A \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 17   Filed 12/30/20   Page 17 of 20\ncourt may grant a temporary restraining order to preserve the status quo before a hearing can occur \non the merits of a party's preliminary injunction motion. Warner Bros., 877 F.2d at 1124; see also \nAIM Int'l Trading LLC v. Valcucine SpA, 188 F. Supp. 2d 384, 387 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (sine qua non \n“of a temporary restraining order is to preserve an existing situation in status quo until the court \nhas an opportunity to pass upon the merits of the demand for a preliminary injunction”). The Court \nhas previously ruled that threats of financial hardship or control are threats of ‘irreparable injury”. \nSee Wisdom Import Sales Co., LLC v. Labatt Brewing Co., 339 F.3d 101, 114-115 (2d Cir. 2003)); \nDanaher Corp. v. Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co., Nos. 86 Civ. 3499 (PNL), 86 Civ. 3638 (PNL), \n1986 WL 7001, at 14 (S.D.N.Y. June 19, 1986) (granting preliminary injunction to plaintiff \nshareholders so that they could “exercise their rightful control over the corporation”). \nPlaintiffs’ injuries are actual and will continue to accrue as long as the Executive Orders \nare enforced. These are circumstances that are completely avoidable by the issuance of the \ninjunction sought through this action. Monetary compensation cannot remedy the continuing civil \nrights violations occurring if these Executive Orders can remain and the Defendants can go \nunchecked  with  the  haphazard  enforcement  of  their  restrictions.  Moreover,  monetary \ncompensation cannot save countless lives of New York City residents who will seek refuge at \nprivate, unsafe indoor gatherings. The total potential losses to the Plaintiffs and others who are \nsimilarly situated is incalculable. The Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights and business ownership are \nat stake.  \n \nIV.  The Balance of Hardships Tips in the Plaintiffs’ Favor \n \nIn considering a motion for a preliminary injunction, the court “must balance the competing \nclaims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the \nrequested relief.” See Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). Plaintiffs \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 17   Filed 12/30/20   Page 18 of 20\nmust establish that the balance of hardships tips in their favor regardless of the likelihood of \nsuccess. See Salinger, 607 F.3d at 79-80. In addition, a court may award preliminary injunctive \nrelief only if the “public interest would not be disserved.” Id. at 80. The hardship that will be \nincurred by the Plaintiffs and those who are similarly situated will have a long-lasting, irreparable, \nand devastating impact that will increase over time as the restrictions continue to accrue against \nthe normal revenues generated by Plaintiffs and those similarly situated. The public is best served \nby the issuance of the relief sought by this action as more citizens will be permitted to go out of \ntheir homes and into larger, well controlled, well ventilated establishments where their health and \nsafety are paramount. The state has no claim of hardship that will occur that is not outweighed by \nthe magnitude of the harm that has been and will be suffered by Plaintiffs. See Martinez v. Cuomo \n(S.D.N.Y. 2020) \nV.  The Public Interest Will not be Disserved \n \nFinally, the Court must \" ensure that the 'public interest would not be disserved' by the \nissuance of a preliminary injunction.\" Salinger, 607 F.3d at 80 (quoting eBay, 547 U.S. at 391), \nJuicy Couture Inc. v. Bella Int'l, Ltd., 930 F.Supp.2d 489, 505 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). In this case, the \nissuance of an injunction will prevent the Plaintiffs and others who are similarly situated from \nincurring devastating financial losses and prevent untold citizens from being driven into small \ngatherings where the transmission and positivity rates soar, and where lives are placed at risk. \nThe public interest will not be disserved by the issuance of an injunction. The public interest will \nbe best served by the issuance of a TRO and injunction. The public interest is best served by \nensuring the constitutional rights of persons within the United States are upheld. See Mitchell, 748 \nF.2d at 808; Phelps-Roper v. Nixon, 545 F.3d 685, 690 (8th Cir. 2008), overruled in part by \nPhelps-Roper v. City of Manchester, 697 F.3d 678 (8th Cir. 2012) (en banc); Abdi v.

Under the Governor's restrictions, restaurants in the City \nwere prohibited (I) from serving customers indoors and (2) from serving customers outdoors \npast 10 p.m. \nPlaintiffs, whose livelihoods depend on the restaurant industry, alleged that these \nrestrictions abridged several of their rights under the Federal Constitution, including:  (1) the \nFirst Amendment, (2) the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, and (3) the Dormant \nCommerce Clause.  And on those same grounds, they also sought a Temporary Restraining \nOrder (TRO) and Preliminary Injunction against the Governor's restrictions. \n1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 69   Filed 05/11/21   Page 2 of 11\nThe Court denied both applications for emergency relief and held that the Plaintiffs' \nConstitutional claims were unlikely to succeed on the merits because the restrictions at issue \nconstituted a valid exercise of the Governor's police powers under the Constitution. \nAdditionally, the Court also found that the remaining injunction factors-irreparable harm and \nthe public interest-weighed against the issuance of a TRO and Preliminary Injunction. \nThe Governor and City authorities (collectively, \"Defendants\") now move to dismiss this \ncase pursuant to Rules 12(b)(l) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  For the \nreasons set forth below, the motion is GRANTED. \nBACKGROUND \nThe following is an abbreviated account of the facts, which are more fully set forth in the \nCourt's Preliminary Injunction opinion.  In fall 2020, New York began to experience a second \nsurge in COVID infections.  (See Dr. Varma Decl. ~ 17, ECF 36.)  Beginning in September, the \nState averaged a 50% increase in daily cases and that rate continued to rise following the end-of \nyear holiday season.  (ld. ~~ 17-18.) \nIn response to this second wave of infections, the Governor issued new executive orders \n(\"Dining Policy\") that limited restaurant dining in New York City.  (See Schonfeld Decl. Exs. H \n& I, ECF 34.)  Under the Dining Policy, restaurants were prohibited (1) from serving customers \nindoors and (2) from serving customers outdoors past 10 p.m.  (See id.) \nThe Dining Policy was intended to slow the further spread of COVID.  According to \npublic health authorities, indoor dining at restaurants increases the risk of COVID transmission \ndue to poor ventilation, inadequate social distancing, and the unmasked face-to-face exposure \nthat occurs while eating and drinking.  (See Dr. Blog Decl. ~~ 8-59, ECF 40; Dr. Varma Decl. ~~ \n33-44.) These characteristics of indoor dining, experts say, are problematic because respiratory \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 69   Filed 05/11/21   Page 3 of 11\ndroplets of the virus can spread through close contact with others as people cough, sneeze, talk or \nsing.  (See Dr. Blog Decl. ,[~ 11, 16; Dr. Varma Decl. ~ 30.) \nIn a similar vein, the Dining Policy's 10 p.m. curfew on outdoor dining also sought to \nreduce the further spread of COVID.  The policy was premised on the rationale that the later \npeople dine out in the evening, the more liquor they consume, reducing their inhibitions and \nmaking them less likely to adhere to mask wearing and social distancing protocols.  (See Dr. \nBlog Decl. ~~ 44---52; Dr. Varma Decl. ~ 37.) \nThe Plaintiffs in this case consist of a New York City restaurant, non-profit advocacy \ngroup, and restaurant worker who, like many others in the industry, have found themselves in a \nworld of financial hurt due to the COVID pandemic and its accompanying restrictions.1  (Compl. \n~~ 54--58, ECF 1.) \nOn Christmas Day 2020, the Plaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit seeking injunctive \nrelief from the Dining Policy.  (ECF 1.)  On December 30, the Plaintiffs moved for a TRO and \nPreliminary Injunction enjoining the Dining Policy on the grounds that it violated (1) the First \nAmendment, (2) the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, and (3) the Dormant \nCommerce Clause.  (ECF 16.)  Following a telephonic conference on January 6, 2021, the Court \ndenied the TRO application, and ordered briefing and expedited discovery on the Preliminary \nInjunction motion.  (Order, ECF 32.)  On January 21, the Court held oral argument on the \nPreliminary Injunction motion. \nBy written order dated February 9, the Court denied the Plaintiffs' request for a Preliminary \nInjunction.  See Hopkins Hawley LLC v.  Cuomo, No. 20-CV-10932 (PAC), 2021  WL 465437 \n1 Plaintiffs are comprised of three parties:  Seaport House is a restaurant operating in New York City; Costin \nTarsoaga is a restaurant worker; and the New York Merchants Alliance is a non-profit advocacy group that \nrepresents restaurant owners across New York.  (Compl. 1f1l 54-56, ECF 1.) \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 69   Filed 05/11/21   Page 4 of 11\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 9, 2021).  First, the Court held that the Plaintiffs' Constitutional claims were \nunlikely  to  succeed  on  the  merits  under  the  deferential  standard  set  forth  in  Jacobson  v. \nMassachusetts,  197  U.S.  11  (1905),  or  alternatively,  under  a  traditional  \"tiers  of scrutiny\" \nConstitutional analysis.  See Hopkins Hawley, 2021 WL 465437, at *3-9.  Second, the Court \nfound no demonstration of irreparable harm by the Plaintiffs.  See id. at *9.  And third, the Court \nfound that the public interest would be disserved by enjoining the Dining Policy, particularly \namidst a global pandemic.  See id. at *9-1 0. \nSince the Court's Preliminary Injunction ruling, the Nation has turned a corner with respect \nto  the  COVID  pandemic.2  To  date,  more  than  250  million  doses  of vaccines  have  been \nadministered across the Nation.  See Ctrs. For Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), COVID-19 \nVaccinations in the United States, https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations (updated \nMay 10, 2021).  And in New York alone, 40% of the population has been fully inoculated.  N.Y. \nTIMES,  See  How  Vaccinations  Are  Going  in  Your  County  and  State, \nhttps :/ /www .nytimes. com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html#by-s tate  (updated \nMay 10, 2021.)  New cases, meanwhile, continue to decline across the Nation and the  State. \nAs a result of these developments, the Dining Policy has since been superseded by less \nrestrictive policies. At present, restaurants in the City can operate at 75% indoor capacity and until \nmidnight.  N.Y.  TIMES,  New  York  Is  Reopening  Sooner  Rather  Than  Later, \nhttps:// www .nytimes.com/2021/05/04/nyregion/new-york -reopening-covid.htrnl  (May 4,  2021 ). \nMoreover, the Governor has announced that by the end of May, restaurants will be able to operate \nwithout restriction.  See id. \n2 Under Rule 20 I of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the Court may take judicial notice offacts that are \"generally \nknown within the trial court's territorial jurisdiction.\" FED. R. EVID. 201.  General facts regarding the COVID \npandemic indisputably fall within Rule 201 's purview. \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 69   Filed 05/11/21   Page 5 of 11\nThe Defendants now move to dismiss this lawsuit under Rules 12(b )(1) and 12(b) (6) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The Court heard oral argument on this motion on May 5, 2021. \nFor the reasons set forth below, the motion is granted. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nI.  Rule 12(b )(1) \nOn a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(l), the party \nseeking  to  invoke  the  Court's jurisdiction bears  the  burden  of proving  that  subject  matter \njurisdiction exists.  Robinson v.  Overseas Military Sales Corp., 21 F.3d 502, 507 (2d Cir. 1994). \n\"A case is properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b )(1) when the \ndistrict court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.\"  Makarova v.  United \nStates, 201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir. 2000).  In deciding a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, the district court \n\"may refer to evidence outside the pleadings.\" !d.  It is incumbent on the plaintiff to prove subject \nmatter jurisdiction exists by a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard.  Id .; see also Malik v. \nMeissner, 82 F.3d 560, 562 (2d Cir. 1996). \nII.  Rule 12(b)(6) \nTo survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule  12(b)(6), \"a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" \nAshcroft v.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v.  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, \n570 (2007)) (cleaned up).  A claim is facially plausible \"when the plaintiff pleads factual content \nthat allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.\"  !d.  \"Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,  supported by mere \nconclusory statements, do not suffice.\"  Id. \nWhen considering a Rule 12(b )( 6) motion, the district court accepts as true all of the factual \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 69   Filed 05/11/21   Page 6 of 11\nallegations contained in the complaint and draws all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. \nATSI Commc'ns, Inc.  v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 F.3d 87, 98 (2d Cir. 2007).  That tenet, however, \n\"is inapplicable to legal conclusions.\" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  Thus, a pleading that offers only \n\"labels and conclusions\" or \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not \ndo.\"  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  If the plaintiff\"ha[s] not nudged [its] claims across the line from \nconceivable to plausible, [its] complaint must be dismissed.\" Id. at 570. Finally, in deciding a Rule \n12(b) (6) motion, a court may consider documents that are attached as exhibits, incorporated by \nreference, or integral to the complaint.  See Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 153 (2d \nCir. 2002). \nDISCUSSION \nI.  Mootness \nIn Roman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo, 141 S.Ct. 63 (2020), the Supreme Court provided \nthe relevant legal framework for assessing mootness in COVID restriction lawsuits.  Id. at 68. \nThere, religious organizations affected by Governor Cuomo's restrictions on in-person worship \nservices had moved for emergency injunctive relief against the Governor's policies.  Id. at 66. \nBut in the course of litigation, the Governor rescinded the restrictions at issue and argued before \nthe Supreme Court that the case was now moot.  I d.  The Court, however, rejected that argument \nand held: \nIt is clear that this matter is not moot.  And injunctive relief is still called for because the \napplicants remain under a constant threat that the area in question will be reclassified as \nred or orange.  The Governor regularly changes the classification of particular areas \nwithout prior notice.  If that occurs again, the reclassification will almost certainly bar \nindividuals in the affected area from attending services before judicial relief can be \nobtained. \nId. (cleaned up). \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 69   Filed 05/11/21   Page 7 of 11\nSubsequently, in Tandon v. Newsom, 141 S.Ct. 1294 (2021), the Court reaffirmed this \nmootness framework, explaining: \n[E]ven if the government withdraws or modifies a COVID restriction in the course of \nlitigation, that does not necessarily moot the case.  And so long as a case is not moot, \nlitigants otherwise entitled to emergency injunctive relief remain entitled to such relief \nwhere the applicants \"remain under a constant threat\" that government officials will use \ntheir power to reinstate the challenged restrictions. \n!d. at 1297. \nRoman Catholic Diocese and Tandon, together, articulate two mootness principles that \nare of concern here:  (1) a lawsuit brought against COVID restrictions is not simply moot \nbecause the restrictions at issue have been rescinded; and (2) if the COVID restrictions (at issue) \nhave been rescinded in the course of litigation, the relevant inquiry is whether the plaintiff \nremains under a \"constant threat\" of those restrictions being reintroduced in the future.  Roman \nCatholic Diocese, 141 S.Ct. at 68; Tandon, 141 S.Ct. at 1297. \nHere, the Defendants explicate the first of these mootness principles but not the second. \nThey contend that this case is moot because the Dining Policy has been rescinded by the \nGovernor and replaced with less onerous restrictions.  (City. Br. 24-25, ECF 65.)  But under the \nteachings of Roman Catholic Diocese and Tandon, this argument comes out of the oven half-\nbaked; the Defendants do not address whether, notwithstanding the Dining Policy's revocation, \nthe Plaintiffs remain under a \"constant threat\" of confronting the Dining Policy again in the \nfuture.  Roman Catholic Diocese, 141 S.Ct. at 68; Tandon, 141 S.Ct. at 1297. \nAnd it is clear under that standard that this case is not moot.  Although the Dining Policy \nhas been revoked and any remaining restrictions on restaurant dining are set to expire by the end \nof May 2021, the dispositive fact still remains:  the Governor retains the authority to reintroduce \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 69   Filed 05/11/21   Page 8 of 11\nCOVID restrictions on restaurants in response to another surge in COVID cases.3  And while that \noutlook may appear unlikely, given the Nation's vaccination progress and the general decline in \nCOVID cases, the only certainty about the future course of this pandemic is uncertainty.  See \nCassell v. Snyders, 990 F.3d 539, 546 (7th Cir. 2021).  Accordingly, the Plaintiffs remain under \nthe \"constant threat\" of confronting the Dining Policy again, which means this case is not moot. \nRoman Catholic Diocese, 141 S.Ct. at 68; see, e.g., Cassell, 990 F.3d at 546 (\"We have \nconsidered whether the case should be dismissed as moot. Given the uncertainty about the future \ncourse of the pandemic, we are not convinced that these developments have definitively rendered \nit moot.\"); Moxie Owl, Inc. v. Cuomo, No. 121CV194MADDJS, 2021 WL 1402297, at *5 \n(N.D.N.Y. Mar. 18, 2021) (finding case was not moot despite announcement that the COVID \nrestriction at issue would be dialed back). \nII.  Constitutional Claims \nIn their Complaint, the Plaintiffs allege that the Dining Policy violated their \nConstitutional rights under:  (1) the First Amendment, (2) the Fourteenth Amendment's Due \nn \nProcess Clause, and (3) the Dormant Commerce Clause.  (Compl.  108-145.) \nAt the Preliminary Injunction stage, the Court rejected each of these Constitutional \nclaims on the merits.  Hopkins Hawley, 2021 WL 465437, at *3-9.  Because the parties do not \nprovide any compelling reasons to revisit this analysis, the Court incorporates the same \n3 On March 7, 2021, the Governor signed New York Senate Bill5357 (\"the Act\") which purports to terminate the \nGovernor's emergency powers during the COVID pandemic.  See Act of March 7, 2021, ch. 71, 2021 N.Y. Laws \n5357.  In truth, however, the Act really modifies, not terminates, the Governor's emergency powers.  See id.  Under \nthe Act, the Governor may still extend or modify currently existing COVID restrictions so long as he:  (1) gives \nadvance notice to the state legislature and affected municipalities; and (2) provides an opportunity for the political \nbranches to offer feedback on his proposed directives.  See id.  Thus, because the Governor still retains the authority \nto extend or modify existing COVID restrictions, the Act does not render this case moot under Roman Catholic \nDiocese. \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 69   Filed 05/11/21   Page 9 of 11\nreasoning to resolve the Plaintiffs' Constitutional claims here.  A condensed legal analysis \nfollows. \nFirst, the Plaintiffs' Constitutional claims against the Governor's Dining Policy fail under \nthe deferential standard set forth in Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. at 31.  In Jacobson, the \nSupreme Court held that in times of public health crises, a state or local law \"enacted for the \npublic health\" would only be struck down if it had \"no real or substantial relation to [the public \nhealth] or is, beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental \nlaw.\"  ld. at 31.  The Plaintiffs' claims do not meet the Jacobson standard.  I d.  The Dining \nPolicy bears a relation to the public welfare by seeking to curb the transmission of COVID-19 in \nhigher risk settings such as restaurants.  See Columbus Ale, 2020 WL 6118822, at *4; Luke's \nCatering Serv., LLC v. Cuomo, No. 20-CV-1086S, 2020 WL 5425008, at *7 (W.D.N.Y. Sept. \n10, 2020).  Moreover, the Plaintiffs have not shown that the Dining Policy is \"beyond all \nquestion, a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by fundamental law.\"  Jacobson, U.S. at 31. \nTherefore, their Constitutional claims must be rejected under Jacobson. \nSecond, even if Jacobson were longer good law in light of Roman Catholic Diocese and \nAgudath Israel of America v.  Cuomo, 983 F. 3d 620, 635-36 (2d Cir. 2020),4 the Plaintiffs' \nConstitutional claims also founder under a traditional \"tiers of scrutiny\" analysis.  I d. at 635.  As \ndiscussed in the Preliminary Injunction opinion, the Plaintiffs' claims do not implicate any \n4 In denying Plaintiffs' motion for a Preliminary Injunction, the Court acknowledged that Roman Catholic Diocese \nand Agudath Israel raised doubts \"as to Jacobson's continuing viability,\"  Hopkins Hawley, 2021 WL 365437, at *5, \nbut nonetheless held that Jacobson was still applicable on stare decisis grounds.  Id.; see See Agostini v. Felton, 521 \nU.S. 203, 237 (1997); Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Exp., Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989) (\"If a precedent of \nthis Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the \nCourt of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling \nits own decisions.\").  Because that reasoning still holds true, the Court concludes that Jacobson must apply on this \nmotion. \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 69   Filed 05/11/21   Page 10 of 11\nfundamental rights under the Constitution and therefore do not trigger a heightened standard of \njudicial review.  Accordingly, rational basis review applies.  And tbe (deferential) question asked \nunder rational basis scrutiny is whetber the state action at issue-tbe Dining Policy-\"rationally \nadvances some legitimate government purpose.\"  Columbus Ale, 2020 WL 6118822, at *3 n. 8; \nsee Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 306 (1993).  Absolutely.  The Dining Policy was a rational \nmeasure employed by tbe Governor to slow tbe furtber spread of tbe COVID virus.  Columbus \nAle, 2020 WL 6118822, at *3 n. 8.  Thus, even if Jacobson did not apply, the Plaintiffs' claims \nwould fail under a traditional mode of Constitutional analysis. \nIII.  State Law Claims \nThe remaining claims in the Complaint consist of state law claims that arise under New \nYork law.  Those claims allege that tbe Dining Policy:  (1) constitutes an unlawful delegation of \nstate legislative authority to tbe executive branch under tbe New York State Constitution, and (2) \ntbat the Governor, in implementing tbe Dining policy, violated New York State Executive Law \nSection 28.  See N.Y. Exec. Law§ 28 (McKinney). \nThe Court does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate these claims under the Pennhurst \ndoctrine.  \"In Pennhurst, tbe Supreme Court held tbat sovereign immunity prohibits federal \ncourts from entering injunctions against state officials on the basis of state law.\"  Vega v. Semple, \n963 F.3d 259, 283 (2d Cir. 2020).  This form of sovereign immunity applies even if tbe state law \nclaims are \"brought into federal court under pendent jurisdiction.\" /d. at 284.  That is the precise \ncase here:  the Plaintiffs' state law claims are brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367-the \nsupplemental jurisdiction statute.  Hence, because such claims are barred under tbe Pennhurst \ndoctrine, tbe Court dismisses Plaintiffs' state law claims for lack of jurisdiction. \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 69   Filed 05/11/21   Page 11 of 11\nCONCLUSION \nThe Defendants' motion to dismiss is GRANTED.  The Clerk of Court is respectfully \ndirected to terminate this case. \nDated: New York, New York \nMay 11,2021 \nHONORABLE PAUL A. CROTTY \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n11 ",

For the \nreasons stated on the record, Plaintiffs’ TRO request is DENIED.  \nWhere, as in here, an injunction “will affect government action taken in the public \ninterest pursuant to a statute or regulatory scheme, the moving party must demonstrate (1) \nirreparable harm absent injunctive relief, (2) a likelihood of success on the merits, and (3) public \ninterest weighing in favor of granting the injunction.”  Agudath Israel of Am. v. Cuomo, No. 20-\n3572, 2020 WL 7691715, at *6 (2d Cir. Dec. 28, 2020) (cleaned up); see Murray v. Cuomo, 460 \nF. Supp. 3d 430, 442 (S.D.N.Y. 2020).  The Plaintiffs have failed to meet this three-factor test—\n1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 32   Filed 01/08/21   Page 2 of 3\nnamely the irreparable harm and public interest factors—and therefore their TRO petition must \nbe denied.  As the Court noted during the conference, Governor Cuomo’s directive banning \nindoor dining in New York City was announced on December 11, 2020.  See Governor Cuomo \nAnnounces Updated Zone Metrics, Hospital Directives and Business Guidelines, Governor’s \nPress Office (Dec. 11, 2020), available at https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-\nannounces-updated-zone-metrics-hospital-directives-and-business-guidelines.  Yet the Plaintiffs \nfiled for a TRO seeking enjoinment of Governor Cuomo’s policy nearly three weeks later, on \nDecember 30, 2020.  (ECF 16.)  This lack of immediacy belies the notion that the Plaintiffs’ \nalleged harm is irreparable and in need of TRO relief.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(1)(A) \n(explaining that a party seeking a TRO must “show that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, \nor damage will result”); see also Lee v. Haj, No. 116CV00008DADSAB, 2016 WL 8738428, at \n*2 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 22, 2016) (finding no irreparable harm where plaintiffs had “not shown that \nthe potential harm they face is so immediate to justify issuing a temporary restraining order”).   \nMoreover, the Court also finds the public interest factor to weigh in favor of denying the \nTRO request.  As the Supreme Court recently explained, “Stemming the spread of COVID-19 is \nunquestionably a compelling interest.”  Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 141 S. \nCt. 63, 67 (2020).  “And judges are not public health experts and should respect the judgment of \nthose with special expertise and responsibility in this area.”  Agudath Israel, No. 20-3572, 2020 \nWL 7691715, at *10.  Because Governor Cuomo’s latest restaurant dining policy constitutes a \nprophylactic measure designed to safeguard the welfare and safety of the New York City public \nagainst the COVID-19 virus, the Court will presume the policy is valid until a more complete \nrecord indicates otherwise.  See S. Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 140 S. Ct. 1613, \n207 L. Ed. 2d 154 (2020) (C.J. Roberts, concurring) (“The precise question of when restrictions \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 32   Filed 01/08/21   Page 3 of 3\non particular social activities should be lifted during the pandemic is a dynamic and fact-\nintensive matter subject to reasonable disagreement.  Our Constitution principally entrusts the \nsafety and the health of the people to the politically accountable officials of the States to guard \nand protect.”) (cleaned up); Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 38 (1905).   \nIn denying the TRO request, the Court expresses no view on the merits of Plaintiffs’ \npending application for a Preliminary Injunction.  The state and city entities are directed to \nrespond to the Preliminary Injunction application by January 13.  The Plaintiffs are directed to \nreply by January 19.  A virtual hearing on the Preliminary Injunction motion will be held on \nJanuary 21 at 12:30 PM.   \n \nDated: New York, New York       SO ORDERED \nJanuary 8, 2021 \n                       \n              HONORABLE PAUL A.

This factor is admitted in Dr. Debra S. Blog’s declaration in\nopposition to this urgent request.2\nIn support of their instant motion for a Preliminary Injunction, Representative Plaintiffs\nsubmit the sworndeclarationof leadinginternationalmedical expertDr.Qanta A.Ahmed, MD,\nFACP, FAASM (attached hereto as Exhibit A) a healthcare professional who came out of\nretirement to work on the frontline of the provision of critical care medicine to critically ill\nCOVID-19 patients. Dr. Ahmed assisted Representative Plaintiffs in further understanding the\ndiscrepancies and failures of the State and City of New York’s respective contact tracing\nprograms, positivity rate calculations, the ineffectiveness of indoor dining and other\nrestrictions, and as a result further enhanced Representative Plaintiffs’ understanding of the\n1 “Lost on us at that time early inthepandemicwasthehighlysignificantelementofhouseholdtransmissionwhich\nhad escalated disease transmission in households seeded with infection just as the shelter in place orders were\nenforced andthesheercontagionofthevirusnotthroughmereaerosolizationofcoughssneezesandothersecretions\nbut direct airborne transmission of suspended viral matter.” Declaration of Dr. Ahmed (citedhereinas“Dr.Ahmed\nDclr.”)\n2Journal of the American Planning Association (2020), (preliminary study finding no correlation betweendensity\nand COVID-19 infections, but finding that “connectivitybetween counties matters more than county densityfor\npandemic spread and lethality” and that “[t]he moreconnected the places (either compact or sprawling)in large\nmetropolitan areas are, the harder they are hit bythe pandemic”).\n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 45   Filed 01/28/21   Page 4 of 20\nflawed science that supports the Governor’s restrictions against indoor dining.3 Through\ndeposition Representative Plaintiffs have uncovered contradictions in the information and data\npresented by Dr. Blog in her declaration.4 These contradictions along with additional relevant\nfacts further support Plaintiffs’ assertions that the Governor’s Executive Orders and restrictions\non indoor dining lack scientifically supported evidence and are inherently dangerous to the\ncitizens that they are intended to protect. Finally, Representative Plaintiffs have supplemented\nthe scientific evidence of the effectiveness of various ventilation and other methods as a means\nof mitigating and eliminating the transmission ofviruses such as COVID-19.\nRepresentative Plaintiffs request that the Court take judicial notice of the verified\naffidavit of Jeffrey Minner as filed in re: Amherst Pizza and Ale House, Inc. et al vs. Cuomo et\nal, State of New York Supreme Court: Erie County, NYS Sup Ct.

This supplemental memorandum affords this Court the “more complete\nrecord” that it described with hopes that it will in turn rely on this mountain of scientific\nevidence that supports the Plaintiffs’ claims in issuing a preliminary injunction.\nRULE 8 ADMISSION OF FACTS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK ET AL.\nThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP), “Rule 8. General Rules of Pleading” do\nhave effect on this instant proceeding and the Defendants’ responses indicate not only tacit and\nlegal admissions of the the facts alleged (which allows Representative Plaintiffs to assert all the\nfacts contained in Complaint to be deemed true and correct) in our complaint.It is alsotruethat\nRepresentative Plaintiffs have proven their case, met their high burden, and have submitted\noverwhelming evidence to this Court that a Preliminary Injunction in this case is not only\nwarranted but Constitutionally mandated, according to both law and equity.\nRULE 8 AS APPLIED TO THE INSTANT CASE:\nThe FRCP instructs on this matter, as follows (RepresentativePlaintiffs comments\nindicated in underline bold s below):\n***(b) Defenses; Admissions and Denials.\n(1) In General. In responding to a pleading, a partymust:\n(A) state in short and plain terms its defenses to each claim asserted\nagainst it;.\nRepresentative Plaintiffs by and through their Verified Complaint, ECF\nDoc. No. 1 have alleged plausible facts.\n(B) admit or deny the allegations asserted againstit by an opposing party. \\\n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 45   Filed 01/28/21   Page 6 of 20\nDefendant Cuomo (et al.), by and through his attorneys has not\npresented any written or memorialized rebuttal to ourfacts alleged.See\nECF Doc. No 37: Governor AndrewM. Cuomo’sMemorandum Of Law\nIn Opposition To Plaintiffs’ Motion For A Preliminary Injunction. The\ndocument contains no line item or other factual averments contrary to\nRepresentative Plaintiffs alleged facts in this federal action. Statements\ncontained in that document such as “no clear substantial likelihood,”\nPage 2, para. 3, “Plaintiff’s seek to undermine these efforts”, Page 1,\npara. 3, and “Plaintiffs seek to undermine ***Cuomo’s Executive\nOrders designed to mitigate the significant risks of COVID-19\ntransmission posed by indoor dining” are not factual averments\nsufficient to satisfy the FRCP mandate.\n(2) Denials—Responding to the Substance. A denial must fairly respond to the\nsubstance of the allegation.\nAbsent in Governor Cuomo’s responsive papers.\n(3) General and Specific Denials. A party that intends in good faith to deny all the\nallegations of a pleading—including the jurisdictionalgrounds—may do so by a\ngeneral denial. A party that does not intend to deny all the allegations must either\nspecifically deny designated allegations or generally deny all except those specifically\nadmitted.(Defendants failed to respond).\nAbsent in Governor Cuomo’s responsive papers.\n(4) Denying Part of an Allegation. A party that intends in good faith to deny only\npart of an allegation must admit the part that istrue and deny the rest. (Defendants\nfailed to respond even in part).\nAbsent in Governor Cuomo’s responsive papers. The general and\nconclusive legal arguments in Governor Cuomo’s responsive papers\ncannot serve to satisfy this subsection of the FRCP.\n(5) Lacking Knowledge or Information. A party that lacks knowledge or information\nsufficient to form a belief about the truth of anallegation must so state, and the\nstatement has the effect of a denial. (Defendants failed to allege lack of knowledge).\nAbsent in Governor Cuomo’s responsive papers.\n(6) Effect of Failing to Deny. An allegation—other than one relating to the amount\nof damages—is admitted if a responsive pleading isrequired and the allegation is not\ndenied. If a responsive pleading is not required,an allegation is considered denied or\navoided.\n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 45   Filed 01/28/21   Page 7 of 20\nResponsive pleadings were required in this important federal action and\nFRCP Rule 8(b)(6) mandates that “is admitted” and this request for\nPreliminary Injunction should be granted forthwith.\n(c) Affirmative Defenses. (NONE WERE PRESENTED).\n(1) In General. In responding to a pleading, a partymust affirmatively state any\navoidance or affirmative defense, including:\n• accord and satisfaction;\n• arbitration and award;\n• assumption of risk;\n• contributory negligence;\n• duress;\n• estoppel;\n• failure of consideration;\n• fraud;\n• illegality;\n• injury by fellow servant;\n• laches;\n• license;\n• payment;\n• release;\n• res judicata;\n• statute of frauds;\n• statute of limitations; and\n• waiver.\nAbsent in Governor Cuomo’s responsive papers.\n___________________________________________________________\nDR. DEBRA S. BLOG’S DECLARATION (ECF DOCUMENT 38: CASE:\n1:20-CV-10932-PAC).\nAs indicated in Representative Plaintiffs Reply, ECF Doc. No. 44, Representative\nPlaintiffs’ counsel has thoroughly reviewed the submitted Declaration of Epidemiologist Dr.\nDebra S.

P. 6, ¶ 20 ;\n● The “key factor [in containing the spread] is airflow. ” P. 6, ¶ 23 .\n● In order “[t]oprevent spreadofCOVID-19 inrestaurants, werecommend\nstrengthening  temperature-monitoring surveillance, increasing the\ndistance between tables, and improving ventilation .” P. 7, ¶ 23 ;\n● TheCDC informs thatthe highestriskrestaurants areoneswith“[s]eating\ncapacity  not  reduced and tables  not  spaced at least 6 feet apart.”  Id .\n(Emphasis in original.)  P. 10, ¶ 35; \n● The restaurant industry presented a “complex case in which theeconomic\ninterests and the need to supply food to NYC need[s] to be  carefully\nbalanced .”  P. 11, ¶ 39 ;\n● “Typical restaurant service is notan appropriatecomparatorfor typicalbar\nbehavior/service .”  P. 11, ¶ 40 ;\n● The CDC recommends, “[restaurants and bars can determine,  in\ncollaboration with state and local health officials , whether and how to\nimplement these [safety protocol] considerations, making adjustments to\nmeet the needsand circumstancesofthe localcommunity.Implementation\nshould be guided bywhat isfeasible,practical,acceptable,and  tailoredto\nthe needs of each community . ” E  xh. Z.  P. 12 ¶43 .\n● In the case of “o rdinary restaurant service , the customers arrive and\nleave at different times with the main purpose of enjoying a meal. In\ncontrast,  at a bar , the purpose of going to a bar is to consume alcoholic\nbeverages over aperiodoftime,a factthat increasesthechances offurther\nmingling and transmission of the virus.”   P. 12, ¶ 44. \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 45   Filed 01/28/21   Page 9 of 20\n● “[T]he WHO[‘s] focusonimprovingventilation andairfiltration inpublic\nplaces such as bars.” In the “a bsence of effective ventilation , the virus\ncan fill a bar in a matter of hours.”  P. 12-13,¶ 46.\n● Generally,  food service after midnight is more similar to a bar\nexperience where patrons tend to gather and mingle rather than a\nrestaurant experience. In ordinary restaurant dining, customers can be\nexpected to finish a meal within an hour or two. A lengthyperiodof time\noccupying the same space is an important factor in increased risk of\ntransmitting the COVID-19 virus. Having food and beverageservicesend\nat midnight discourages individuals from continuing to mingle after they\nhave finished eating.

Moreover, the State’s purported factual\ndefense expert informed that the State of New York has zero factual knowledge, re: the\n“Temporal Viral Load” indicators, also known in certain medical circlesas “InfectiousDose” or\n“Initial Viral Load.” 7\nMoreover, Dr. Blog deposed that shewasunfamiliar withanyof thesetermsor TheState\nof New York’s applications of these basic medically indicated principles:8\nAs well, New York State’s factual counter argument toRepresentativePlaintiffs’ exigent\nrequest to this Federal Court for the traditional protections granted.\nDr. Blog admitted zero knowledge of The State of New York, or its policymakers, asto\nthe medically indicated and data-driven methods that our population has learned from the 1918\nswine flu pandemic or the 1947 smallpox pandemic.9\n7<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01944363.2020.1777891?needAccess=true&>\n8See Deposition transcript, January 24, 2021, Page10, L. 3-25, Page 11, L. 2.\n9 In the aftermath of the 1918 pandemic, historians described and memorialized the significant importance of\npreventing pandemics through “common sense.” See Deposition transcript, Page 12.

See Deposition transcript, Page 16. L. 20-25, Page\n17, L. 2-17.\nDr. Blog also attested to the inability of the State to determine whether DENSITY in a\npopulation center is a contributing factor ineither thespreadof SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) –the\nState of New York’s only remaining logical argument that could plausibly be considered\nmedically indicated, or serve as arational basisfor theoppressive ExecutiveOrdersinstituted by\nGovernor Cuomo.

See United Haulers Assn., v.Oneida-Herkimer Solid\nWaste, 550 U.S. 330, 339 (2007) (\"To determine whether a law violates this so-called 'dormant'\naspect of theCommerceClause,wefirst askwhetherit discriminatesonits faceagainstinterstate\ncommerce.\") Granholm v.

Accordingly, the Court held that the ordinance violated the dormant\nCommerce Clause.\")  \n1. Connectivity and the nature of interactions have greaterimpacts on the spread of\nthe virus than population density.\nStudies like this suggest, with scientificevidence,that it isnotpopulationdensity, butthe\nway people interact, or connectivity that has the greater impact on the spread of the virus. Dr.\nHamidi who contributed to the Scientific American study  looked at some of the confounding\nfactors—metropolitan size,socioeconomicstatus ofresidents,qualityof healthcareandadoption\nof social distancing—when analyzing how density affects COVID-19 spread and mortality in\nmore than 900 U.S. counties. She and her collaborators at the University of Utah found that\ncounty density had no significantrelationshipwith infectionrate. Infact,higher-density counties\nwere associated with lower mortality rates, possibly because residents were more strictly\nfollowing social-distancing guidelines or had better access to health care. “If you want to move\nto a rural area to be safe from getting COVID, maybe [that helps] because you have fewer\ncontacts,” says Brooke Nichols, a health economist at Boston University, who wasnotinvolved\nin the study. “But in terms ofmortality, youmight actuallybe atagreaterriskbecause theremay\nnot be the services there to support you.”\nOne of the biggest predictors of infection rate was metropolitan size—a factor that the\nresearchers see as reflecting the number of metropolitan area counties that are intricately linked\nby community, transportation, housing,and economicrelationships.And the implicationthatthis\nkind of connectivity among communities may play a significant role in the spread of the novel\n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 45   Filed 01/28/21   Page 15 of 20\ncoronavirus was strengthened in a follow-up longitudinal study.12 It showed that larger\nmetropolitan size was linked to higher infection and mortality rates over time, whereas higher\npopulation density (without that confounding factor) was linked tolower infection andmortality\nrates over the same period.\n2. The State of New York’s contact tracing is flawed yet it still highlights the fact that a\nminiscule percentage of positive tests can be tracedback to restaurants.\nIn her declaration, Dr. Ahmed stated that the State of New York reported 46,000 data\npoints that were collected from contact-tracing between September and November 2020.13 This\nis 46,000 cases that have been traced while an additional 200,000 cases have been reportedand\nremain untraced. Barely 1.4% of cases that were traced successfully were related to restaurant\nexposure. “Additionally, the vast majority of infections cannot betraced totheirpoint ofcontact\nin New York State is also likely indicating most cases cannot be traced to the restaurant and\nhospitality industry. This again would be in keeping with the academic literature which shows\nextensive transmission is foremost withinthe household.”SeeDr.AhmedDeclr. Pg. 15(Exhibit\nA).\n‘The United States is in a particularly dire situation. “Public-health authorities are\nstruggling to reach cases and contacts” despite aggressive efforts, says John Oeltmann, head of\ncontact-tracing assessment at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in\nAtlanta, Georgia. He and his team evaluated two counties in North Carolina. In June and July,\n48% of cases in one county and 35% in the other reported no contacts. Of the contacts whose\ndetails were provided, one-quarter inonecounty andalmosthalfin theothercouldn’tbereached\n12“Longitudinal Analysis of the Relationship Between Development Density and the COVID-19 Morbidity and\nMortality Rates: Early Evidence from 1,165 MetropolitanCounties in the United States”, S. Hamidi, Reid Ewing,\n(July 2020) Health and Place, vol. 64, Science Direct\n13Governor Cuomo made these remarks in an interviewon December 11, 2020.\n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 45   Filed 01/28/21   Page 16 of 20\non the phone after three attempts over consecutive days2. In New Jersey, just 49% of cases\nbetween July and November were contacted; only 31% of those provided any contact details.\n“These results are not rare,” says Oeltmann.\nThe New York Times has reported that workers in New York City’s contact tracing\nprograms have complained of ‘crippling communication and training problems.’ Ideally contact\ntracing shouldtrack individuals who havespent 15minutesor morewithinsix feetofan infected\nperson, trace their contacts and isolate andquarantine accordingly. Thesheernumber ofinfected\nand impacted individuals, delays in access, and turnaround time of testing and widespread\ndissemination of the pandemic have impeded successful contact tracing in the United states\nincluding in New York. These limitations together with the unpalatability to democracies of\ngeolocation technology, close circuit television and credit card footprints of index case patients\nin the United States- though widely deployed in South East Asia - renders real-time contact\ntracing, tracking, isolation, and quarantine pragmatically unfeasibleat this advancedstageofthe\npandemic.\n3. Indoor dining and other restrictions lead to infected individuals isolating with\nfamily and neighbors.\nThere is no data or information that defines what people do when restaurants areclosed.\nThe logical assumption is that they retreat to their homes (if they have one) where they are in\nclose proximity to family and close friends for untold periods of time. As illustrated in the\nfollowing (2) reports, when indoor dining is closed, the spread of the virus has gone up. See\nhttps://forward.ny.gov/daily-hospitalization-summary-region,\nhttps://forward.ny.gov/percentage-positive-results-region-dashboard.\nStudies have shown that there is no attempt within these private spaces toemploy social\ndistancing or other protocols. In fact, Dr. Ahmed pointed out that “if lock down measures are\n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 45   Filed 01/28/21   Page 17 of 20\nimplemented but the infection has already seeded a particular household, disease transmission\nwill continue and increase seriallyandamplify evenas communitydiseasediminishes. Thismay\nbe the reason why even though indoor dining has remained entirely closed in New York City\nsince December 14th 2020 by the State’s own medical expert, prevalence of COVID-19 in New\nYork City continue to rise as described in the affidavit bymycolleagueDr.Debra S. Blog.”See\nDr. Ahmed Declr. pg. 25. (Exhibit A).\nCentral to pandemic propagation is the overlooked and neglected role of household\ntransmission including here in New York State and New York City. In several studies scientists\nhave noticed that community transmission will be ongoing depending on the extent of\nhousehold-to-household contacts- consider parents and grandparents being in contact with each\nother in differenthouseholds-andhousehold tocommunity contacts–anessentialworkerwho is\nthe breadwinner in the family but needs to go outtothe workplacewhile thehousehold contacts\nisolate and shelter in place during lockdown orders.See Id.pg. 15.\n4. The sworn deposition of Jeffrey Minner further illustrates the effectiveness of a\nproperly ventilated environment for the mitigation of the virus.\nMr. Jeffrey Minner is a mechanical engineer who recently retired as Chief Engineer for\nGeneral Motors, Lockport Division. Mr. Minner was engaged to perform a scientifically\ncontrolled analysis of air exchange in indoor dining venues in the Western New York Area. See\nAmherst et al. Mr. Minner conducted the tests at different locations and at different times to\nensure the repeatability of the results. The results of these tests showed that the ventilation\n(ACH) of indoor dining venues were superior to air flow in a typical home by a multiple of50.\n(See Exhibit B). The information contained in Mr. Minner’s reportalong withothercompelling\nevidence led the Court in that case to reopen indoor dining.ThePlaintiffsinthis casehave gone\nexceedingly beyond the ventilation protocols tested by Mr. Minner and should therefore be\n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 45   Filed 01/28/21   Page 18 of 20\nconsidered evenmoresuperiorinairflow andventilation thanthe typicalresidenceandtherefore\nfar more likely to cause spread.\n5. There is a substantial likelihood that Plaintiffs claims will succeed on the merits and\nprevail on their constitutional claims.\nThe statements and testimony providedbyDr.Blog stand instarkcontrast tothe growing\nbody of scientific studies that have been conducted during the current pandemic. Plaintiffshave\nraised significant questions that go to the merits of the case. While the moving party must set\nforth evidence to support a likelihood of success on the merits, this factor is not dispositive in\ndetermining whether to grant injunctive relief. The moving party does not need to demonstrate\nan absolute certainty of success in order to prevail. See Wali v. Coughlin, 754 F.2d 1015, 1025\n(2d Cir. 1985). In a case involving Constitutional Rights violations, a showing of a substantial\nlikelihood of success on the merits often also establishes irreparable harm. Thus, a showing of\nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits can be the determining factor that warrants the\nissuance of a preliminary injunction. See Sindicato Puertorriqueño DeTrabajadores v.Fortuño,\n699 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2012); Phelps-Roper v. Nixon, 509 F.3d 480, 485 (8th Cir. 2007).\nPlaintiffs in the current case have raised significant questions that go the merits of the case,\nestablished a likelihood of success on the merits, established that irreparableharmwillcontinue\nin the absence of injunctive relief, and that the balance of equities tips decidedly in favor of\nPlaintiffs (as the current restrictionshave beenshownwith scientificsupporttobe harmfulto the\npublic health).\n“But even in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten.” See\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, NY vs. Cuomo et al,509 US 2020.\n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 45   Filed 01/28/21   Page 19 of 20\nCONCLUSION\nAs of the filing of this actionandits subsequentproceedings, theGovernorhas hintedon\nJanuary 27, 2021, that heintendsto liftrestrictionsandpermit indoordining toreopen.Plaintiffs\nand those similarly situated intend to continue to pursue this action until it is adjudicated on its\nmerits in this Court as the Governor has opened and closed indoor dining previously.

A  recent  front  page  article  from  the  New  York  Post  depicted \nGovernor Cuomo in green face and a Santa Claus outfit, as the Grinch, entitled, \n​\n“You’re a Mean One: Cuomo the Grinch Who Stole Christmas as he Bans Indoor \n​\nDining (again).”3 The article illustrates the feelings that most New Yorkers have \n​ ​\ntowards the Governor since the pandemic started: that the Governor has no \ninterest in guiding the State back to some semblance of normalcy and that he \ndoesn’t care how devastating his Executive Orders are — in practice — on the \npeople  that  he  is  sworn  to  serve  and  displays  a  profound  disconnect  two \nprotections of the United States Constitution and the people: \nCiv. 461 (KPF), at *24 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 25, 2014) (\"Loss of a business can constitute irreparable harm.\") United \n​\nRetail Incorporated v. Main Street Mall Corp., 903 F. Supp. 12, 14 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (\"A threat to trade or \n​\nbusiness viability may constitute irreparable harm\").   \n \n3 New York Post (December 12, 2020). \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 5 of 71\n \n7.

This action further arises because the variegated executive branch \norders,  arbitrarily  dictated  by  Governor  Cuomo  and  Mayor  De  Blasio,  are \nmanifestly  illegal  and  unprecedented  in  both  law  and  equity,  for  any \ngovernmental entity that would call itself a democracy and/or espouses the \nidea of freedom and liberty; as the legislature cannot, and must not be able to, \ndelegate its core decision making authority to an executive. Further, aspects of \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 6 of 71\nthe Governor’s Executive orders drastically affects interstate commerce which \ncan only be regulated by the federal government via the Dormant Commerce \n​ ​\nClause.  \n​\n9. The Governor’s Executive Orders are a violation of the 42 U.S.C. § \n1983 mandates because they deprive Plaintiffs and others similarly situated from \nConstitutionally protected rights, without the benefit of due process.  \n10. Finally, the Governor has illegally infringed on the right of the people \nto  peacefully  assemble  and  protest  their  government  pursuant  to  the  First \nAmendment of the United States Constitution.  \n11. The  proposed  class  Plaintiffs  consist  of  a group  of United  States \ncivilians and New York City merchants who cannot, and will not, respect or obey \nany further takings of our fundamental liberty interests and freedoms.   \n12.

New York State Executive Law § 29(a) Of Article 2(b) authorizes the \nissuance  of executive orders with all the authority of a law introduced and \nenacted  through  traditional  processes  for  as  long  as  the  executive  order \nremains  in  effect.  However,  executive  orders  are  subject  to  the  state \nconstitution, the federal constitution as well as federal statutes and regulations \nand, of course, the will of the people in a country which ventures to democratic.  \n15. The case at bar arises because of Governor Cuomo’s issuance of \nExecutive  Order  202.81,  styled  “Continuing  Temporary  Suspension  and \n​\nModification  of  Laws  Relating  to  the  Disaster  Emergency,”  which  states  in \n​\nrelevant part: \nThe  directive  contained  in  Executive  Order  202.61  as \n4 Roman Catholic Diocese Of Brooklyn, New York V. Andrew M. Cuomo, Governor Of New York: On \n​\nApplication For Injunctive Relief: November 25, 2020: Cite as: 592 U. S. ____ (2020) 1: Per Curium: SUPREME \n​ ​\nCOURT OF THE UNITED STATES: No. 20A87 (“But even in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away \nand forgotten ***[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably \nconstitutes irreparable injury,” the majority wrote, quoting the Supreme Court’s plurality opinion in Elrod v. \nBurns in 1976). \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 8 of 71\ncontinued  in Executive Order 202.79 is  hereby  modified  to \nsuspend authorization for indoor dining within New York City \neffective on Monday December 14, 2020. \n \nEMERGENCY DEFINED \n16. The  Governor’s  initial  Executive  Orders  were  premised  on  the \nperceived need to “flatten the curve” of COVID-19 related resultant deaths in \norder to avoid and prevent the overwhelming of the the State’s hospitals and \nhealthcare ICU centers, not to eradicate the virus in its entirety. Despite the fact \nthat  the  mortality  curve  was  flattened  months  ago,  the  Governor  has \nnonetheless  continued  to  enforce, and most recently extend, his draconian \nunconstitutional  prohibitions  in  an  unbalanced  and  highly  targeted manner \nagainst the Plaintiffs and other similarly situated small businesses across New York \nCity.  \n17. Under federal law, the term “emergency” is defined in 42 U.S. Code \n​ ​\n§  5122  as  “any  occasion or instance  for which, in the determination of the \nPresident, Federal assistance is needed to supplement State and local efforts \nand capabilities to save lives and to protect property and public health and \nsafety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of the United \nStates.”  \n18. Emergency  was  an  accurate  designation  of  the  sudden  health \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 9 of 71\ncatastrophe that we found ourselves facing in the spring of this year when the \nmagnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic began to come into focus. At that time, \nso little was known about the transmission and specific severity of the virus, and \nthere was no testing available.  \n19. On March 2, 2020, the New York State Legislature rushed through a \nbill  amending  §  29  of  the  New  York  State  Executive  Law  which  increased \nGovernor Cuomo’s powers. This bill was hastily pushed through on the premise \nthat it was a COVID-19 related “necessity,” as dictated by the Governor. On \ninformation and belief, there was no formal debate, prior public notice, and no \nmedia coverage prior to the bill’s passing.  \n20. The passing and continued imposition of this bill, and all subsequent \norders are in violation of the New York State and United States Constitutions, \nbecause  the  bill  exceeds  the  limits of  government in  a multiplicity of ways. \nSpecifically, Articles 9 and 11 of the Constitution of the State of New York along \nwith Article 1and the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n21. Moreover, the Executive Orders that have been issued subsequent \nto the passing of this bill are also in violation of the New York and United States \nConstitutions.  The  adverse  ramifications  of  these  orders  have  destroyed the \nState’s  economy,  which  in  turn  has  decimated  the  financial  well-being  of \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 10 of 71\ncountless businesses and the scores of families whose livelihoods relied thereon.  \n22. Precisely,  more  than  2,800  businesses  in  New  York  City  have \n​\npermanently closed since March 1 of this year according to data from Yelp, the \nbusiness  listing  and  review  site;  a  higher  number  than  in  any  other  large \nAmerican city. Roughly one-third of the city’s 240,000 small businesses may never \nreopen,  according  to  a  report  by  the  Partnership  for  New  York  City,  a \nwell-known and influential business group. So far, those businesses have shed at \nleast 520,000 jobs; and counting. \n23. Nationwide, an estimated $25 billion in sales and more than 3 million \n​\njobs were lost in the industry in the first 22 days of March 2020. In New York, an \nestimated $1.9 billion in sales and more than 250,000 jobs were lost in the same \nperiod,  operators  reported a  58% decline  in sales,  78% of operators laid off \nemployees, and 48% of operators temporarily closed their restaurants.5 \n​\n24. New  York  City’s  restaurant  industry  had  23,650 establishments in \n2019,  provided  317,800  jobs,  paid  $10.7  billion in total wages citywide,  and \nmade nearly $27 billion in taxable sales. By August 2020, employment in the \nrestaurant industry was still  only  55% of its level in February 2020, before the \n​\n5 “New York State Restaurant Association Releases Stats on Devastating Impact of Covid-19”, Total Food \n​\nService, (March 30, 2020). \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 11 of 71\npandemic hit.6 \n​\n25. The true emergency, therefore, is the danger of the collapse of New \nYork City’s economy, and the greater deaths and suffering which result from the \nunintended consequences of closing indoor dining in New york City, which will \nundoubtedly  come  upon  us  quickly  after  the  hospitality  and  small  business \nsectors meet their demise this winter. \nFEDERAL RESPONSE TO COVID-19 \nPANDEMIC: JANUARY – MARCH 2020 \n \n26. To date, President Donald Trump has activated emergency powers \nunder  four  separate  statutes  for  the  COVID-19  response.  President  Trump \ndeclared a public health emergency under the Public Health Service Act on \nJanuary 31, 2020, issued two national emergency declarations under both the \nStafford Act and the National Emergencies Act (NEA) on March 13, 2020, and \ninvoked emergency powers via Executive Order under the Defense Production \nAct on March 18, 2020. On March 19, 2020, President Trump named the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency (FEMA) as the lead agency in the COVID-19 \nemergency response efforts, a designation previously held by the Department \nof Health and Human Services (HHS). \n6 “The Restaurant Industry in New York City, Tracking Recovery”, Office of the New York State Comptroller, \n​\n(September 2020). \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 12 of 71\n27. There  are  three  sources  of  statutory  authority  for  the  federal \ngovernment to issue an emergency declaration, each associated with varying \nprocedures,  resources,  and  funding.  These  include  the  Stafford  Act,  Public \nHealth  Service  Act  and  National  Emergencies  Act.  As  of  March  13,  2020, \nemergencies had been declared under all three acts. Additionally, the Defense \nProduction Act affords the President broad powers to compel domestic industry \nproduction  for  the  sake  of  national  defense,  including emergency activities \nunder the Stafford Act. \n28. On  March  13,  2020,  the  president  declared  an  emergency  for \nCOVID-19  under  Section  501(b)  of  the  Stafford  Act,  pledging  $50  billion  in \nunspecified aid in the ongoing COVID-19 response efforts. Section 501(b) of the \nStafford Act allows the federal government to declare an emergency without a \ngovernor’s request and makes available only certain subsets of FEMA recovery \nfunds.  This  generally  enables  FEMA  to  operate  as  a  vehicle to  deliver virus \nresponse funds to state and local governments. \n29. Declarations  under the Stafford Act are typically associated with \nnatural disasters, but they can also be used for health emergencies such as the \nCOVID-19  outbreak.  Stafford  Act  declarations can take several forms, each \ninvolving various procedures, types and amounts of assistance. These programs \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 13 of 71\nare funded by the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) which is currently funded at $42 \nbillion.  Emergency  and  catastrophic  disaster declarations  typically require a \ngovernor’s request, based on well-documented and verified cost estimates via \npreliminary  damage assessments. However, Section 501(b) of the Stafford Act \nallows  the  president  to  declare  an  emergency  without  a  request  from  the \ngovernor  of  the  affected  state  when  the  primary  responsibility  for  the \nemergency rests with the federal government. Such an emergency declaration \ndoes not prevent the governor from subsequently requesting a major disaster \ndeclaration for other unmet needs caused by the event. \n30. On March 13, 2020, the President also declared an emergency for \nCOVID-19  under  Section  201  and  301  of  the National  Emergencies  Act. \nThe National Emergencies Act (NEA) generally authorizes the president nearly \nunlimited discretion to declare a national emergency. These sections allow the \nSecretary  of  HHS  to  exercise  the  authority  under section 1135 of the Social \nSecurity  Act  to  temporarily  waive  or  modify  certain  requirements  of  the \nMedicare, Medicaid, and State Children’s Health Insurance programs and of \nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule throughout \nthe duration of the pandemic. The Secretary of HHS must provide certification \nand  advance  written  notice  to  the  Congress.  These  waivers  can  loosen \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 14 of 71\nrestrictions on the use of telehealth and certain requirements for hospitals and \nhealthcare providers to improve their response efforts. \n31. The NEA was enacted by Congress in 1976 to formalize presidential \nand congressional power — and related checks and balances — surrounding \nnational  states  of  emergency.  However,  this  formalization  does  not  include \ndefinitions for or requirements of the national emergency itself. The law does not \nitself provide authorities associated with a state of national emergency, though \nit does allow activation of powers provided the president in other statutes. A \nnational emergency  under NEA  was also activated by President George W. \nBush for the September 11th terrorist attacks in 2001. \nSTATE OF NEW YORK’S RESPONSE \nTO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC \n \n \n32. Based on speculative modeling on the influence and lethality of \nCOVID-19,  Governor  Cuomo  has  issued  executive  orders  that  had  all  but \nshuttered civil society, placing the lives of 19.5 million people in constant turmoil \nas their livelihoods, homes, and sanity hinge on the Governor’s monarchical next \ndecision.  \n33. On  March 7, 2020, Governor Cuomo issued Executive Order 202, \nstyled Declaring a Disaster Emergency in the State of New York (“Order 202”). \n​ ​\n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 15 of 71\nCiting § 28 of Article 2-B of the New York Executive Law, C.F.R. 390.23(a)(1)(A), \nSection 112 of the New York State Finance Law, Article V, § 1 of the New York \nConstitution, as well as a host of additional state and federal statutes and rules, \nGovernor Cuomo seized total and complete control over the operation of the \nstate government independent of the legislature.  \n34. The emergency measures that were haphazardly imposed to stave \noff spread of the disease in the spring, should have been replaced by traditional \nand well-established governmental safety mechanisms armed with existing and \nupdated scientific and practical knowledge of the virus, and a desire to devise \nand  implement  long-term,  sustainable  measures  that  could  lead  to  our \ncollective thriving in this new reality. Instead, New York is suffering through the \nGovernor’s lasting bout with the intoxication of singular power.7  \n​\n35. The  current  Executive  Orders  target  restaurant  owners  and \nbusinesses like the Plaintiffs and others similarly situated. These business owners, \ntheir employees and families will suffer the loss of revenue and the potential of \nlosing businesses and jobs, and healthcare, simply because the Governor has \ndecided that restaurants and bars in the Five Boroughs of New York City must \n7 Notably, at the time of creation of our democracy, viral pandemics were widespread and deadly. \n​\nNevertheless, the founding fathers declined to incorporate a pandemic exception to our constitution. \nClearly,  this  absence  was  well-thought  and  intended  to  have  meaning.  < \nwww.mountvernon.com/pandemic  > (accessed December 10, 2020). \n​\n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 16 of 71\ncompletely  shut  down  indoor  dining  (allowing  only  outdoor  dining  in  the \nblistering cold winter season), while other businesses, particularly in Upstate New \nYork, such as other  bars,  restaurants, hotels, other  Hospitality Industry venues \nremain open and thriving.  \n36. Manhattan -— home to  the  largest number of restaurants in the \nstate —  has a positivity rate of just 2.7%, which is less than half that of many \ncounties  throughout  the  state  where  indoor  dining  remains  open.  Albany \nremains at 7.2%, Westchester at 6.0% and Suffolk at 6.1%,. Restaurants in New \nYork, as an industry,  are  only  responsible for  a minute 1.4% of virus cases as \ncompared  to 74%  from indoor living room  spread. Yet,  only  New York City's \nrestaurants  are  being  closed,  even  when  hospitalization  rates  upstate  are \ndouble the city's rate.8 \n​\n37.

Without  the  support  of  empirical  or  data  driven  evidence,  the \nGovernor  has  unilaterally  determined  that  any  kind  of  indoor  operation  by \nrestaurants  and  bars  is  part  of  the  cause  of  the  recent  uptick  in  virus \ntransmissions,  while  simultaneously  permitting  the  often  more  crowded  big \nbusinesses  such as CVS, Target, Macys, Footlocker, Trader Joe’s, and  Whole \nFoods, that can literally be found next door. Or, permitting New Yorkers to get \non crammed airplanes with 200 to 300 passengers sharing the same oxygen and \ncapsule.  There is  no  science  or subsection of the New York or United States \nConstitutions  that  supports  this  dystopian  edict.10  Cuomo’s  decision  to  ban \n​\n9 At a bare minimum, this court should issue an injunction authorizing indoor dining to remain for those \nspaces that institute best practices according to our now known and indisputable empirical medical data.  \n \n10 On Wednesday, December 8, 2020, Mayor Bill de Blasio declared that the “most identifiable piece of \n​\nthe puzzle” when it comes to the spread of COVID-19 has been travel, although bars and restaurants have \nalso been sources for the virus escalating.” But nothing has fostered the increase of COVID-19 cases more \nthan private family gatherings, according to de Blasio. “The main driver appears to be family settings,” de \nBlasio said. “Not so much being out in community settings. < www.nyeater.com/DiBlasio > (accessed \n​\nDecember 10, 2020). \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 18 of 71\nindoor dining only in New York City is based on his personal bias against the five \n(5) boroughs and nothing else. \n42.

A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE GOVERNOR’S \nDEFINED LEVELS OF RESTRICTIONS AND  \nTHEIR TRIGGERS \n \n63. On December 23, 2020, the State of New York issued the “Cluster \nAction Initiative” which defines how the State will designate certain areas as \n“Clusters” based upon metrics such as positivity rates. Restrictions are defined in \nthe initiative based upon the rolling 7-day average percentage of positivity rates \nin each area or cluster. The initiative will divide clusters and the areas around \nthem into three categories with successively higher restrictions within each one: \nRed Zones, Orange Zones and Yellow Zones. \n64. On  December 10, Governor Cuomo announced new metrics by \nwhich  micro-cluster focus zones will be determined to help control COVID-19 \nspread and protect hospital capacity.  \n65. A  Red  Zone  will  be  implemented  when  a  region,  after  the \ncancellation of elective procedures and a 50% increase in hospital capacity, is \n21 days away from reaching 90% hospital capacity on the current 7-day growth \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 27 of 71\nrate.  \n66. A geographic area will be eligible to be designated as an Orange \nZone if it has a 4% positivity rate (7-day average) over the last 10 days and it is in \na region that has reached 85% hospital capacity. Alternatively, a geographic \narea  may  also become an Orange  Zone if the State Department of Health \ndetermines the region’s rate of hospital admissions is unacceptably high and a \nzone designation is appropriate to control the rate of growth. \n67. A geographic area will be eligible to enter a Yellow Zone if it has a \n3% positivity rate (7-day average) over the past 10 days and is in the top 10% in \nthe  state  for  hospital  admissions  per  capita  over  the  past  week  and  is \nexperiencing week-over-week growth in daily admissions. \n68. Dining restrictions by cluster zone are defined in the initiative as:  \ni. Red Cluster Zone Dining Restrictions: Takeout or delivery only; \n​\n \nii. Orange  Cluster  Zone  Dining  Restrictions:  Outdoor  dining, \n​\ntakeout, or delivery only, 4 person maximum per table, and \nbars  and  restaurants  close  at  10  pm  for  on  premises \nconsumption; and \n \niii. Yellow Cluster Zone Dining Restrictions: Indoor and outdoor \n​\ndining permitted, 4 person maximum per table, and bars and \nrestaurants close at 10 pm for on premises consumption.14 \n​\n \n69. The  cluster  restrictions  are  extremely  prejudicial  to  Plaintiffs  and \n14 “Cluster Action Initiative”, New York State, New York Forward (December 23, 2020). \n​\n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 28 of 71\nothers  similarly  situated.  There is, in  essence, no middle or “Orange  Cluster” \navailable  due  to  the  indoor  dining  restriction  and  the  freezing  outdoor \ntemperatures during the fall and winter months.  \n70. Plaintiffs and those similarly situated are further prejudiced by the \nreality that New York City employs the most sensitive testing method available \nwhile other areas of the State and the State Department of Health employ a far \nless sensitive test which leads to fewer positive cases, fewer false positives, and \nultimately lower positivity rates in those areas (i.e., relaxed restrictions).  \n​ ​\n71. The manner that the cluster zones are designed, favors certain cities \nand municipalities across the State while unjustly punishing those located in and \naround New York City.  \nII.  DISTURBING STATISTICAL DISCREPANCIES. \n72. In June 2020, Governor Cuomo announced that 3% would be the \nState’s official positivity rate benchmark or low water point for deciding the level \nof restrictions imposed in any given region of the State.15 Below the 3% threshold, \n​\nrestrictions are lowered; above 3% restrictions are elevated. Nearly every aspect \nof the State’s economy is balanced on the “percent positive” as this metric is \n15 “The World Health Organization recommended in May that the percent positive remain below 5%.” \n​ ​\nCenters for Disease Control, August 2020 Report on the Spread of Covid-19. \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 29 of 71\nknown  in  medical  circles.  The  percent  positive  is  “the  percentage  of  all \ncoronavirus tests performed that are actually positive, or: (positive tests / total \ntests) x 100%. The percent positive (sometimes called the “percent positive rate” \nor “positivity rate”) helps public health officials answer questions such as: (i) what \nis the current level of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes the disease known as \nCOVID-19) transmission in the community, and (ii) is there enough testing for the \namount of people who are getting infected?16​” \n​\n73. While the financial security of the entire body of the State’s citizens \nis on hold based on this calculus, the Governor and Mayor De Blasio do not \nhave a standardized or rational method of calculating the positivity rate.  \n74. There  are  a  variety  of  causes  for  the  discrepancies  that  exist \nbetween the State and NYC’s determination of the positivity rate on any given \nday. For instance, the State counts both antigen and polymerase chain reaction \n​\n(“PCR”) tests, which will produce a lower percentage of positive tests. New York \nCity does not include antigen tests in its positivity count, opting to exclusively use \nPCR tests which are more sensitive and produce higher incidence of positive \nresults. Antigen tests are known to miss positive tests in people carrying relatively \ninsignificant amounts of the virus where many public health experts have stated \n16 “Covid-19 Testing: Understanding the Percent Positive”, Johns Hopkins, Bloomberg School of Public Health \n(August 10, 2020). \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 30 of 71\nthat PCR tests are too sensitive.  \n75. Another significant discrepancy in the calculation of the positivity \nrates between the State and New York City is that they each report new positive \ncases in a different manner which manipulates the underlying positivity rate. The \nState treats a new case as arising on the day the test results came in. New York \nCity  dates  each  new  case  to  the  day the sample was  provided. So, if an \ninfected person goes to a clinic to have his nose swabbed on Monday, that \nsample is often delivered to a laboratory where it is tested. If those results are \nreported  to the health authorities on Wednesday, the State and city would \nrecord it differently. The State would include it with Wednesday’s tally of new \ncases, while the city  would add it to Monday’s column. The 3 % threshold is \nbased on a seven-day rolling average. The day that a new case is registered is \nof maximum importance in determining an accurate positivity rate.  \n76. As recently as the last week of November, Governor Cuomo and \nMayor De Blasio clashed over the actual positivity rate in New York City. The city \nsaid  its seven-day average was 3.09%. Mr. Cuomo’s office, however, put the \ncity’s rate at more than half a point lower, at 2.54%. \n77. One  final  yet glaring issue with the calculation and  reporting of \npositivity  rates  is  the  way  repeated  positives  are  counted.  If a  person tests \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 31 of 71\nnegative repeatedly within a seven-day period, the city counts only a single test \nwhen calculating the positivity rate. But the State includes all negative tests from \ndifferent days in its calculation. On the other hand, when someone tests positive \nrepeatedly, the city includes each positive test when calculating the positivity \nrate.  The  State,  however,  only  counts  the  first  positive  test  and  ignores \nsubsequent results. That last variable — whether repeated positives are counted \nor not — has a significant effect on the positivity rate. Gareth Rhodes, a member \nof Mr.  Cuomo’s coronavirus task force,  estimated that approximately 20% of \npositive PCR tests currently emerging from New York City were for someone who \ntested positive in the past.   \n78. Plaintiffs and others who are similarly situated have their businesses \nand the lives of their employees and patrons teetering on the brink of certain \ndisaster, based on governmental decisions that are haphazard and ill-informed \nat best. There is no science that supports the 3% benchmark. There is no logical \nrationale for the State to have one method of calculating and registering results \nand the City of New York a different method, while other cities in the State have \neven more variations.  \n79. New York City restaurants languish under the Governor’s Executive \nOrder(s),  while  cities  like  Albany  remain  open  for  business.  Not  necessarily \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 32 of 71\nbecause the positivity  rate in Albany is  lower, but because  its positivity rate \ncalculation is more liberally gathered and reported than that of New York City.  \n80. The  Governor’s  Executive  Orders  are  not  evenly  enforced  and \nPlaintiffs and others who are similarly situated are being deprived of their liberty \nand  rights  for  reasons  that  are  not  justified  given  the  facts  underlying  the \ndecision-making processes.  \nIII.  ECONOMIC IMPACT OF PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS \nON RESTAURANTS, RESTAURANT WORKERS, AND \nSTATE UNEMPLOYMENT. \n \n81. The data indicates that 4 out of 5 restaurants, bars, and nightclubs \nin New York City (83%) could not pay their full rents in July, and more than a third \n(37%) were unable to pay anything, according to a new survey by the New York \nCity Hospitality Alliance, a trade association for New York hospitality businesses.  \n82. Manhattan  is  home  to  the  largest  number  of  restaurants  in the \nState, yet it has a positivity rate of just 2.7%, which is less than half that of many \ncounties  throughout  the  State  where  indoor  dining remains  open. Albany is \ncurrently  at  (7.2%),  Westchester  (6.0%),  and  Suffolk  (6.1%).  According  to \nGovernor Cuomo himself, restaurants, as an industry, are only responsible for \n1.4% of virus cases, as compared to 74% from indoor gathering (e.g., living room \n​ ​\nspread).  Yet,  only  New  York  City's  restaurants  are being closed  even  when \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 33 of 71\nhospitalization rates  in Upstate New  York are double  the city's rate, and the \npositivity rates in upstate New York are nearly quadruple. This is hypocrisy at its \nfinest. \n83. Recent  studies  indicate  that  nearly  3  out  of  4  landlords  (71%) \nrefused to  waive any of the due rent, 3 out of 5 (61%) would not defer the \npayments, and 9 of 10 (90%) declined to formally renegotiate leases.17 \n​\n84. Food and drinking establishments shed at least 234,000 jobs during \nthe shutdown in the five boroughs, or nearly half a million jobs throughout the \nState, according to data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on June \n19th.  105,000  city  hospitality  staffers  were  still  working  in  May,  when  the \nmetropolitan area had not yet reached the first phase of reopening — up from \n91,000 in April. That is just a third of the jobs that were available in February. It is \nalso the lowest level of hospitality industry employment since before December \nof  1992,  constituting  a  temporary  erasure  of  nearly  30  years’  worth  of jobs \ngrowth.18 \n​\n85. These grim statistics coincide with the larger jobless picture in New \nYork City, and the State of New York, where overall unemployment increased to \n17 “83% of N.Y.C Restaurants and Bars Can’t Pay Their Rents,” Restaurant Business, August 4, 2020. \n​\n \n18 “New Unemployment Numbers Show N.Y.C Has Lost Two-Thirds of Its Food Jobs”, N.Y.C. Restaurant \n​\nNews, June 23, 2020. \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 34 of 71\n18.3% in May — well above the already high federal rate of 13.3%. Foreign-born \nand  BLPOC  workers  saw  even  higher  jobless  rates,  approaching  Great \nDepression  levels.  Asian  unemployment  in New York, as has been previously \nreported,  rose  the  highest,  jumping  from  3.4%  in  February  to 25.6% in May, \naccording to members  of the state COVID-19 Task Force, who cited Current \nPopulation  Survey data.  Unemployment  was  almost  equally  stratospheric for \nHispanics, at 25.1%, and for Black people, at 23.5%. \n86. Not all businesses are affected proportionally. Profits soared by an \naverage of 39% in the first half of the year at supermarket chains and other food \nretailers, thanks to the pandemic, although front-line workers reaped little or no \nbenefit, a new report shows.  At Cincinnati-based Kroger Company, profits for \nthe first two quarters were up a staggering 90%, according to the report from the \nBrookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.19 \n​\n87. Kroger saw its net earnings for the first two quarters jump to more \nthan  $2.031 billion compared with $1.069 billion  in the same period of 2019. \nThird-quarter profits, which were reported in early December, were not included \nin  the  Brooking Institute report. When those are included, the company's net \nearnings of  $2.662  billion are up just short of 100% for the first three quarters \n19 “Windfall Profits and Deadly Risks: How the Biggest Retail Companies are Compensating Essential \n​\nWorkers During the Covid-19 Pandemic”, Brookings Institution (November 2020). \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 35 of 71\ncompared with 2019. Walmart profit was $15.6 billion for the first three quarters \ncompared  with  $10.7  billion  for  the  same  period  for  2019,  a  45%  increase. \nAmazon, which owns Whole Foods, saw a $17.4 billion profit for the first three \nquarters, up $6 billion from the same period last year. That amounted to a 53% \nincrease. Costco's profit  was $2.2  billion for the first two quarters of 2020, an \nincrease of $244 million from 2019 or 11%. \n88.

This  rigid  application  of  separation  of  powers  prevents  the \nlawmaking branch from divesting itself of any of its power and conferring it on \none of the other branches. The doctrine is not rigidly applied in a manner such \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 54 of 71\nas to  prevent conferral of such significant authority directly to the executive \nbranch.  In  re:  J.W.  Hampton,  Jr.  &Co.  v.  United  States,  Chief  Justice  Taft \n​ ​\nexplained  the  doctrine’s  import  in  the  delegation  context.  “The  Federal \nConstitution...divide(s) the governmental power into three branches....in carrying \nout that constitutional division into three branches it is a breach of the National \nfundamental law if Congress gives up its legislative power and transfers it to the \nPresident, or to the Judicial branch, or if by law it attempts to invest itself or its \nmembers with wither power or judicial power.  \n149. In the current case the State and city governments have delegated \nvirtually all the Legislative Powers to the Executive Branch which has resulted in a \nloss  of democratic representation and annihilation of the Balance of Powers. \nThese actions cast aside the Constitution without regard. See Mistretta v. United \n​\nStates, 488 U.S. 361, 415 (1989) (\"It is difficult to imagine a principle more essential \n​\nto  democratic  government  than  that  upon  which  the  doctrine  of \nunconstitutional delegation is founded: Except in a few areas constitutionally \ncommitted  to  the  Executive  Branch,  the  basic  policy  decisions  governing \nsociety are to be made by the Legislature”). \n150.

In  the  instant  matter,  we  have  a declared State of Emergency \ncoupled with  unprecedented, overreaching, and oppressive Executive Order \nissued by the State of New York.  \n165. However,  under  The  Laws  Of  New  York:  Consolidated  Laws \n​\nExecutive:  Article  2-B:  State  And  Local  Natural  And  Man-Made  Disaster \nPreparedness the actions of the Governor are both illegal under the statutes \n​\nand the Constitution of the United States of American and the Constitution of \nthe State of New York.  \n166. Moreover, Section 28 of the forgoing Article, mandates only that: \n1.  Whenever  the  governor,  on  his  own  initiative  or \npursuant to a request from one or more chief executives, finds \nthat a disaster has occurred or may be imminent for which \n​\nlocal  governments  are  unable  to  respond  adequately, he \n​\nshall declare a disaster emergency by executive order. \n2.  Upon  declaration  of  a  disaster  arising  from  a \nradiological  accident,  the  governor  or  his  designee,  shall \ndirect one or more chief executives and emergency services \norganizations to: \n(a)  notify the public that an emergency exists; and \n(b)  take appropriate protective actions pursuant to \nthe  radiological  emergency  preparedness  plan \napproved  pursuant  to  sections  twenty-two  and \ntwenty-three  of  this  article.  The  governor,  or  his \ndesignee, shall also have authority to direct that other \nactions be taken by such chief executives pursuant to \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 61 of 71\ntheir authority under section twenty-four of this article. \n 3.  The executive order shall include a description of the \ndisaster, and the affected area. Such order or orders shall \n​\nremain in effect for a period not to exceed six months or until \nrescinded  by  the  governor,  whichever  occurs  first.  The \n​\ngovernor  may  issue  additional  orders  to  extend  the  state \ndisaster emergency for additional periods not to exceed six \nmonths. \n4.  Whenever the governor shall find that a disaster is of \nsuch  severity  and  magnitude  that  effective  response  is \nbeyond  the  capabilities  of  the  state  and  the  affected \njurisdictions, he shall make an appropriate request for federal \nassistance  available  under  federal  law,  and  may  make \navailable out of any funds provided under the governmental \nemergency fund or  such other funds as may be available, \nsufficient funds to provide the required state share of grants \nmade  under  any  federal  program  for  meeting  disaster \nrelated expenses including those available to individuals and \nfamilies. \n167. Accordingly, as a matter of first-course and prior to requesting and \n​\naccepting  the  total  delegation  of  our legislative representatives, it must be \nOBJECTIVELY determined under New York State law that local governments are \n​\nunable  to  respond  adequately.  The  Laws  Of  New  York:  Consolidated  Laws \n​\nExecutive:  Article  2-B:  State  And  Local  Natural  And  Man-Made  Disaster \nPreparedness, Section 28, subsection 1. \n168. As this was not the case, it must first be determined by the federal \ncourt  if  local  New  York  State  governments can  respond adequately to  the \npandemic without the oversight of the Executive Orders.  \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 62 of 71\n169. As well, the only logical implication to this clause requires that such \ninability  of  local  governments  to  respond,  to  be  assessed  on  a  rolling  and \ncontinuous basis.  \n170. It is certain, at this time, that local governments can require through \nthe local municipal codes for restaurants and other Hospitality Industry facilities \nutilize best-practices, including but not limited to, installation of HEPA or other \nsophisticated ventilation systems,  require  the  same  to open all windows and \ndoors even in inclement weather, and other measures.  \n171. Accordingly, we respectfully ask this court to declare the Executive \nOrders relating to the pandemic as illegal under New York State law and the \nNew York State Constitution and issue an injunction to their enforcement. \nSEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND JUDICIAL REVIEW. \n \n172.

The lack of an adequate remedy at law may be demonstrated to \nthe  court  by  showing  that  alternative  remedies  are  immeasurable  or \nspeculative.  Ecolab  Inc.  v.  Paolo,  753  F.  Supp.  1100,  1110  (E.D.N.Y.  1991); \n​ ​\nBasicomputer Corp. v. Scott, 973 F.2d 507, 512 (6th Cir. 1992) (loss of customer \n​\ngoodwill  constitutes  immeasurable  damage,  thereby  rendering  alternative \nremedies at law unavailable). An adequate remedy at law may be deemed \nunavailable  if  legal  redress  may  be  obtained  only  by  commencement  of \nmultiple actions, such as when the defendant repeatedly commits the allegedly \nharmful acts. Ecolab Inc. v. Paolo, 753 F. Supp. 1100, 1110 (E.D.N.Y. 1991).  \n​ ​\n181. In the current case the balance of equities clearly tips in favor of \nPlaintiffs and others similarly situated. The Class is facing literal annihilation if no \naction is taken by this Court. The State will also benefit from the issuance of an \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 67 of 71\ninjunction as it will begin to collect lost taxes once sustainable protocols are \ndeveloped and implemented. See The Marks Org. Inc. v. Joles, 784 F. Supp. 2d \n​ ​\n322, 335 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (\"Under the Salinger standard, a court must also 'consider \nthe balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant and issue the \ninjunction only if the balance of hardships tips in the plaintiff's favor.'\"). \n182. The  permanent  injunction  would  serve  the  public  interest  by \nprohibiting the infringing conduct in furtherance of the Plaintiffs’ Constitutional \nRights. The proposed order will require the Governor to cause the inspection of \nthe Plaintiff’s restaurant ventilation system and operating protocols to determine \ntheir effectiveness for  preventing  the  spread of the virus and further use the \nblueprint as a potential protocol for other similarly situated businesses so that \nthey can resume a semblance of normalized operations. See Living Room Steak \n​\nHouse, 2016 WL 756567, at *7.   \n​\n183. Courts will consider the public interest, if any, in granting or denying \na motion for preliminary injunction. This can be the predominant factor if the \ncourt concludes that the public interest is implicated by the injunction. Courts \nhave  focused on the public  interest factor where the requested preliminary \ninjunction implicated matters of government or public policy. Winter v. Natural \n​\nRes. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008); Stormans v. Selecky, 586 F.3d 1109, \n​ ​ ​\n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 68 of 71\n1139 (9th Cir. 2009); Federal Sav. Loan Ins. Corp. v. Dixon, 835 F.2d 554, 562 (5th \n​ ​\nCir.  1987)  (upholding  preliminary  injunction  freezing  assets  of  officers  and \ndirectors of savings and loan institutions who allegedly engaged in wrongdoing, \nnoting the public interests at stake). \n184. “The decision to grant or deny permanent injunctive relief is within \nthe Court's equitable discretion.” eBay, 547 U.S. at 391, 126 S.Ct. 1837. Alpha \n​ ​ ​\nCapital Anstalt v Shiftpixy, Inc., 19 CIV. 6199 (PGG), 2020 WL 104697, at *9 [SDN.Y. \n​\nJan. 9, 2020]. Traditional equitable considerations weigh in favor of granting the \npreliminary injunction. The evidentiary record demonstrates that: Plaintiff is likely \nto succeed on the merits of the claim, Plaintiff is likely to suffer irreparable harm \nin the absence of preliminary injunctive relief, the balance of the equities tips in \nthe  moving  party’s  favor,  and  an  injunction  is  in  the  public  interest.  In \ndetermining whether to grant a motion for a preliminary injunction, courts will \ngenerally consider the following equitable factors: (a) whether the moving party \nis likely to succeed on the merits, (b) whether the moving party is likely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, (c) whether the balance of \nequities tips in the moving party’s favor, and (d) whether an injunction is in the \npublic interest. Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008) \n​ ​\nACCORDINGLY, we ask this federal court to open indoor dining in New \n​\n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 1   Filed 12/25/20   Page 69 of 71\nYork  City,  for and on behalf of the people and the communities wishes and \ndesires and to take the extraordinary actions requested in order to save the lives \nof the same.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that the Court will: \n​\nA. Certify the Plaintiff Class; \nB. Declare the relevant Executive Order(s) unconstitutional; \nC. Enjoin the relevant Executive Order; \nD.

JOHNSON, Corporation Counsel \nof the City of New York, submit this memorandum of law in support of their motion to dismiss \nthe complaint.2 \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \nPlaintiffs,  a  restaurant,  a  non-profit  entity  purporting  to  represent  restaurant \nowners3,  and  a  restaurant  worker,  bring  this  putative  class  action  challenging  the  State’s \nrestrictions on restaurants in New York City issued in response to the unprecedented public \nhealth crisis caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus.  Specifically, plaintiffs are seeking \nto enjoin the restrictions put in place by New York State Executive Order (“State E.O.”) No. \n202.81, which previously banned indoor dining in New York City, and the directives contained \nin State E.O. 202.61 and continued on in State E.O. 202.79 (“Challenged Orders.”) which \npreviously prohibited in-person dining, outdoors or indoors when permitted, from 10:00 p.m. to \n5:00 a.m. at New York City restaurants.4 \n                                                           \n1Plaintiffs’ claim against DOF and the Sheriff’s Department should be dismissed because  “[t]he New York City \nCharter provides that suits shall be brought in the name of the City of New York and not in that of any agency.” \nPurcell v. New York City Police Department, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175161, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2017). \n2 Plaintiffs filed an application for a Temporary Restraining Order on December 30, 2020 seeking to enjoin the \nCity’s enforcement of the Challenged Orders.  That application was denied by this Court January 8, 2021.  See Dkt. \nNo. 32. Similarly, plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction requesting the same relief was denied by this Court \non February 9, 2021 See Dkt. No. 57. \n3 It does not appear that this entity has standing as there are no allegations as to how it has suffered an injury-in-fact. \nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 562 (1992). \n4With the exception of seeking to certify a class, plaintiffs seek the same relief in the complaint as they did in their \npreliminary injunction application which was already denied by this Court. See Dkt. No. 57.  \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 11 of 34\n \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  the  Challenged  Orders  violate  their  procedural  and \nsubstantive due process rights, discriminate  against interstate commerce in  violation of the \nDormant Commerce Clause, violate their First Amendment right to assemble,5 and violate the \nseparation of powers.  See Complaint, generally.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Challenged \nOrders have been superseded by less restrictive subsequent orders, plaintiffs’ claims fail as a \nmatter of law.   \nAs  an  initial  matter,  plaintiffs’  claims  against  the  City  defendants  must  be \ndismissed as all of the Challenged Orders were made or issued by the State. In any event, even if \nany of the Challenged Orders were attributable to City defendants, plaintiffs fail to establish that \nsuch actions were unconstitutional in light of the deferential standard set forth in Jacobson v. \nMassachusetts, which held that measures implemented to protect the public health will not be \ndisturbed unless it has no “real or substantial” relation to its objects or, is beyond all question, “a \nplain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law.”  197 U.S. 11, 31 (1905).  \nEven  if  Jacobson  were  not  applicable,  as  this  Court  previously  recognized, \nplaintiffs’  claims  still  fail  under  traditional  constitutional  analyses.  Plaintiffs  simply  fail  to \nadequately plead that their constitutional rights were violated, and accordingly their claims \nalleging violations of substantive and procedural due process, the dormant Commerce Clause \nand Freedom of Assembly must be dismissed.  \n   \n                                                           \n5 Plaintiffs fail to articulate a separate claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, however, such a claim would fail as \nplaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of their claims and the Complaint lacks any allegations of Mayor de \nBlasio’s personal involvement with respect to the underlying claims. \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 12 of 34\n \nSTATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS \nThe COVID-19 Public Health Crisis \nIn response to the outbreak of COVID-19 in New York State, on March 7, 2020, \nNew York State Governor Andrew Cuomo (“Governor Cuomo”) declared a formal state of \nemergency in the State of New York. 6  On March 12, 2020, Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a \nstate  of  emergency  in  New  York  City.7    Both  New  York  State  and  New  York  City  then \nimplemented various regulations aimed at preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. \nThereafter, Governor Cuomo issued State E.O. No. 202.3 which states that “[n]o \nlocal government or political subdivision shall issue any local emergency order or declaration of \nemergency or disaster inconsistent with, conflicting with or superseding the foregoing directives, \nor any other executive order issued under Section 24 of the Executive Law . . . .” and State E.O. \nNo. 202.5 which states that “no locality or political subdivision shall issue any local emergency \norder or executive order with respect to response of COVID-19 without the approval of the State \nDepartment of Health.”8   \nOn March 18, 2020 Gov. Cuomo issued E.O. No. 202.6. This E.O., effective \nMarch  20,  2020,  identified,  among  other  things,  “Essential  Businesses”  as  “[a]ny  essential \nbusiness or entity providing essential services or functions” and further provided that Essential \n                                                           \n6 See https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-202-declaring-disaster-emergency-state-new-york. \n7 See https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2020/eeo-98.pdf. \n8  See  https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-2023-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-\nrelating-disaster-emergency;https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-2025-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-\nmodification-laws-relating-disaster-emergency. \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 13 of 34\n \nBusiness would not be subject to the in-person restrictions. Restaurants were deemed “Essential \nretail,” but only for take-out and delivery.9 \nRestrictions on Restaurants \nOn March 16, 2020, Governor Cuomo issued State E.O. No. 202.3 prohibiting \nindoor dining at restaurants throughout the State, but permitting restaurants to provide take-out \nand delivery service.10  That prohibition on indoor dining was lifted on June 12, 2020 for regions \nin Phase 3 of the State’s four-phase reopening timeline pursuant to State E.O. No. 202.41, \nsubject to additional guidance from the State.11  State guidance provided that indoor dining in \nthose regions in Phase 3 was limited to 50% capacity.12  At that time, New York City was in \nPhase 1 of the reopening process.  New York City reached Phase 3 on July 6, 2020 and Phase 4 \non July 20, 2020. On July 6, 2020, Governor Cuomo issued State E.O. 202.48 extending the \nprohibition on indoor dining in New York City.13  \nOn September 9, 2020, Governor Cuomo issued State E.O. No. 202.61 which, \ninter alia, lifted the ban on indoor dining in New York City beginning September 30, 2020, \nsubject to additional restrictions set by the State.14  The State-issued guidance, which is binding \n                                                           \n9  See  https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-2026-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-\nrelating-disaster-emergency. \n10  See  https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-2023-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-\nrelating-disaster-emergency. \n11  See  https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-20241-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-\nrelating-disaster-emergency. \n12See  https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/ \nIndoor_and_Outdoor_Food_Services_Detailed_Guidelines.pdf (last accessed March 31, 2021). \n13  See  https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-20248-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-\nrelating-disaster-emergency. \n14  See  https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-20261-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-\nrelating-disaster-emergency. \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 14 of 34\n \non New York City pursuant to State E.O. No. 202.61, provided, inter alia, that indoor dining in \nNew York City must be, “limited to no more than 25% of the maximum occupancy for a \nparticular area as set by the certificate of occupancy, exclusive of employees.”15   \nOn November 12, 2020, Governor Cuomo issued State E.O. 202.74 directing that \nin-person  dining,  whether  outdoors  or  indoors,  cease  at  10:00  p.m.  throughout  the  State.16 \nThereafter, on December 11, 2020, by State E.O. No. 202.81, Governor Cuomo suspended the \nauthorization for indoor dining in New York City, effective December 14, 2020.17  \nOn January 29, 2021, Governor Cuomo announced that indoor dining at eating \nand drinking establishments in the City would be allowed to resume beginning February 14, \n2021, subsequently changed via E.O. 202.93 to February 12, 2021, at a maximum capacity of \ntwenty-five percent (25%) of their normal operating capacity.18 By State E.O. No. 202.96, \nGovernor  Cuomo  increased  the  permitted  operating  capacity  to  thirty-five  percent  (35%) \nbeginning February 26, 2021.19  By State E.O. 202.97, the Governor increased it once again to \nfifty percent (50%) of their normal operating capacity beginning March 19, 2021.20  \n                                                           \n15 See Interim Guidance For New York City Indoor Food Services During the Covid-19 Public Health Emergency, \nhttps://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/NYC_Indoor_Food_Services_Detailed_Guidan\nce.pdf, (last accessed March 31, 2021). \n16  See  https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-20274-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-\nrelating-disaster-emergency. \n17  See  https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-20281-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-\nrelating-disaster-emergency. \n18  See  https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-20293-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-\nrelating-disaster-emergency. \n19  See  https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-20296-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-\nrelating-disaster-emergency. \n20  See  https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-20297-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-\nrelating-disaster-emergency. \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 15 of 34\n \nAll  of  the  State  E.O.s  are  incorporated  by  reference  in  the  New  York  City \nExecutive Orders, as pursuant to State E.O. No. 202.3, New York City must comply with the \nState E.O.s and cannot impose less restrictive conditions.21  \nLEGAL STANDARD \nWhen deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 12(b)(6), the \nCourt  is  required  to  accept  the  facts  alleged  in  the  complaint  as  true  and  to  construe  all \nreasonable inferences in the nonmoving party’s favor.  See Grandon v. Merrill Lynch & Co., 147 \nF.3d 184, 188 (2d Cir. 1998); Davidson v. Flynn, 32 F.3d 27, 29 (2d Cir. 1994) (citing Madonna \nv. United States, 878 F.2d 62, 65 (2d Cir. 1989)).  A complaint must nevertheless “contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. \n544, 570 (2007)).  “The plausibility standard is not akin to a probability requirement, but it asks \nfor more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. Where a complaint pleads \nfacts that are merely consistent with a defendant’s liability, it stops short of the line between \npossibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.”  Id. (citations and quotations omitted).  \nThe Supreme Court in Iqbal set forth a “two-pronged” approach for analyzing a \nmotion to dismiss.  Id.  First, a court should “identify pleadings that, because they are no more \nthan conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.”  Id.  Once the court has stripped \naway  the  conclusory  allegations,  it  must  determine  whether  the  complaint’s  “well-pleaded \nfactual allegations …plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.”  Id.  In making its evaluation, \na court must undertake a “context-specific task” that requires it to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.  Id. at 679.  Where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer \n                                                           \n21  See  https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-2023-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-\nrelating-disaster-emergency \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 16 of 34\n \nmore than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint must be dismissed.  Id. at 678–79.  \n(“only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss”).  \nARGUMENT \nPOINT I \nTHE COMPLAINT SHOULD BE DISMISSED \nAS  AGAINST  THE  CITY  AS  THE \nCHALLENGED ORDERS WERE ISSUED BY \nTHE STATE.   \nPlaintiffs’ claims against City defendants must be dismissed as the Challenged \nOrders were issued by New York State. See Compl. at 58, “Andrew Cuomo … issued and signed \nthe Order at issue in this case.”  In fact, the Complaint contains few references to the City or \nMayor and clearly focuses on the actions of the State and Governor.  See, e.g., Compl. at 32, 33, \n44, 45, 53, 120, 127, 141.  While the plaintiffs appear to name the City defendants due to their \nrole in enforcing the Challenged Orders within the City, the City defendants are not free to \ndisregard the State E.Os.  Compl. at 59-61.  State E.O. Nos. 202.3 and 202.5 explicitly require \nthe City to adhere to any State Executive Orders and the determinations of the New York State \nDepartment of Health.  Indeed, this Court recognized “the City Defendants’ predicament in this \ncase” in that the City must comply with Challenged Orders under state law.  See Hopkins \nHawley, LLC v. Cuomo, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24580, *7 fn 6 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 9, 2021).  \nAccordingly, as Plaintiffs clearly challenge the State’s actions in responding to the COVID-19 \npandemic, the Complaint should be dismissed against the City defendants. See Grasmere Fit, Inc. \nv.  de  Blasio,  2020  N.Y.  Misc.  LEXIS  10981,  *13-4  (Sup.  Ct.  Rich.  Co.  Nov.  17, \n2020)(“plaintiffs have failed to state a cause of action for damages from defendants with respect \nto Executive Orders [issued by the Governor] as the shutdown of their businesses was at the \ndirection of the Governor [a non-party], not defendants.”) \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 17 of 34\n \nPOINT II \nPLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS FAIL PURSUANT TO \nTHE STANDARD SET FORTH IN JACOBSON \nV. MASSACHUSETTS    \nThe Supreme Court, in the seminal case Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, \n31, 25 S. Ct. 358, 363 (1905), acknowledged that “[t]he possession and enjoyment of all rights \nare subject to such reasonable conditions as may be deemed by the governing authority of the \ncountry  essential  to  the  safety,  health,  peace,  good  order,  and  morals  of  the  community.” \nJacobson, 197 U.S. at 26. In Jacobson, the Supreme Court set forth a deferential standard when \nreviewing a statute “purporting to have been enacted to protect the public health, the public \nmorals or the public safety,” but which allegedly violates a fundamental right. Jacobson, 197 \nU.S. at 31. Such a statute must not be disturbed unless it “has no real or substantial relation to \nthose objects, or is, beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the \nfundamental  law...”  Id.  In  other  words,  “this  review  [is]  asking  whether  power  had  been \nexercised  in  an  ‘arbitrary,  unreasonable  manner,’  or  through  ‘arbitrary  and  oppressive’ \nregulations.” In Re Abbott, 954 F. 3d 772, 784 (5th Cir Apr. 7, 2020) (quoting Jacobson at 28, \n38). \nAs this Court has previously found, the standard set forth in Jacobson applies to \nthis case.22 Hopkins Hawley, LLC, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24580, *11. Indeed, this court and \ncourts across the nation have applied the “real or substantial relation” standard when addressing \nchallenges to orders curtailing constitutional rights during the COVID-19 pandemic. See, e.g., \n                                                           \n22 This is notwithstanding the recent decisions in Roman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo, 208 L. Ed. 2d 206 (2020) and \nAgudath  Israel  of  America  v.  Cuomo,  2020  U.S.  App.  LEXIS  40417  (2d  Cir.  Dec.  28,  2020)  which  are \ndistinguishable from the instant case in that they involved the application of strict scrutiny to plaintiffs’ Free \nExercise claims, which are not at issue here, and challenged a different public health restriction.  Hopkins Hawley \nLLC, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24580, *11-2.  While plaintiffs appear to assert that strict scrutiny is applicable herein, \nthere is no support for such application.

Nov. 6, 2020).  \nThis Court has already found that the restrictions on in-person dining “bear[] a \nrelation to the public welfare by seeking to curb the transmission of COVID-19 in higher risk \nsettings  such  as  restaurants.”    Hopkins  Hawley  LLC,  2021  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  24580  *15.  \n“[Plaintiffs’] requested relief—50% of indoor dining and extension of the dining curfew to \nmidnight—implicitly  concedes  that  public  health  regulation  of  restaurants,  in  view  of  the \npandemic, is constitutional.”  Id.. See, also, Ass’n of Jewish Camp Operators, 2020 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 117765 at *22; McCarthy, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107195 at *9; Page v. Cuomo, 2020 \nU. S. Dist LEXIS 183769 *21 (N.D.N.Y Aug. 11, 2020). In finding that a challenge to the State \nrestriction prohibiting restaurants in New York City from providing service after midnight was \nunlikely to succeed, the Eastern District noted that: \nIt is by now well understood that the virus spreads more easily \nindoors  and  when  people  gather  in  close  proximity.  Social \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 19 of 34\n \ndistancing and mask wearing are among the few tools available to \nslow  its  spread,  but  these  precautions  are  impacted  by  indoor \ndining. Diners cannot wear masks while they eat and drink, and \nindoor  dining  necessarily  brings  individuals  from  different \nhouseholds together in a restaurant, even if at a distance. Thus, \nindoor dining poses a greater risk of virus transmission than many \nother activities. \n \nColumbus Ale House, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 191828 *9.  \nGovernment officials need the flexibility to impose measures aimed at stopping \nthe spread of COVID-19.  As Chief Justice Roberts noted earlier in the pandemic, “[t]he precise \nquestion of when restrictions on particular social activities should be lifted during the pandemic \nis a dynamic and fact-intensive  matter subject to reasonable disagreement.”  S. Bay United \nPentecostal Church v. Newsom, 140 S. Ct. 1613, 1613, 207 L. Ed. 2d 154 (2020) (Roberts, C.J., \nconcurring).  The courts should not second guess determinations made by government officials, \nin consultation with public health officials, as to how best stem the spread of this deadly virus, \nparticularly, whereas here, government officials seek to address an area “fraught with medical \nand scientific uncertainties.”  Columbus Ale House at *11, quoting Marshall v. United States, \n414 U.S.417, 427, 94 S. Ct. 700, 38 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1974)).  see also Dark Storm Indus, LLC v. \nCuomo, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120514 *38 (N.D.N.Y. July 8, 2020)(noting the Court is loathe \nto second-guess COVID-19-related policy decisions during a pandemic with respect to which \nbusinesses are deemed essential). Accordingly, under Jacobson, plaintiffs’ claims fail.  \n   \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 20 of 34\n \nPOINT III \nPLAINTIFFS’ DUE PROCESS CLAIMS FAIL. \nA.  Plaintiffs were not entitled to procedural due process with respect to the Challenged \nOrders. \n1.  Plaintiffs were not entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard with \nrespect to the Challenged Orders as they are legislative in nature.  \nPlaintiffs were not entitled to procedural due process prior to the enactment of \neach of the Challenged Orders. The Challenged Orders are legislative in nature.  See Hopkins \nHawley, LLC, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24580, *16; Our Wicked Lady LLC, 2021 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 44505, *13.  As such, they are not subject to the due process requirements of notice and \nan opportunity to be heard.  Id., New York Pet Welfare Ass’n v. City of New York, 143 F. Supp. \n3d 50, 70 (E.D.N.Y. 2015), aff’d 850 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 2017), cert denied, 138 S. Ct. 131 (2017).  \n“A person adversely affected by a law of general applicability has no due process right to a \nhearing[.]” Hartman v. Acton, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72068 *22 (S.D. Ohio Apr. 21, 2020).  \nSee also Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 433 (noting that an individual’s due \nprocess  rights  are  not  violated  by  a  law  of  general  applicability  since  “the  legislative \ndetermination provides all the process that is due.”)   \n2.  Plaintiffs’ failure to identify a liberty or property interest of which they \nwere deprived is fatal to both their due process claims. \nEven if the Challenged Orders did trigger due process protections, plaintiffs have \nfailed to identify a protected liberty or property interest of which they have been deprived.  The \nonly  alleged  property  right  plaintiffs  claim  to  have  been  deprived  of  is  “their  right  to \ncompensation,”23 and the “loss of substantial revenue and income.”  See Complaint at ¶¶ 131, \n                                                           \n23 Plaintiffs’ assertion that they have been denied the right to compensation suggests a takings claim, however, no \nsuch claim has been pled. \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 21 of 34\n \n145.  That is insufficient to support their due process claim.  “[B]usiness in the sense of the \nactivity of doing business, or the activity of making a profit is not property in the ordinary sense,” \nCollege Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 675 (1999). \n“Harm to business interests…is not a ‘plain, palpable invasion of rights’ under the Fourteenth \nAmendment.” Savage v. Mills, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141628 *22 (D. Me. Aug. 7, 2020), citing \nStop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. v. Fla. Dep't of Envtl. Prot., 560 U.S. 702, 721, (2010) \n(noting  that  “the  liberties’  protected  by  substantive  due  process  do  not  include  economic \nliberties”). Moreover, plaintiffs do not have a right to conduct business without conditions.  \nColumbus Ale House at 11; Bocelli, 2020 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 10213 *18. \nIn any event, plaintiffs have not been deprived of the ability to operate their \nrestaurants.  Throughout the pandemic, restaurants in New York City (including plaintiffs’) have \nbeen permitted to operate in some capacity by providing take-out and delivery service, providing \noutdoor dining, and at various points–including again now—by providing indoor dining at a \nreduced  capacity.    Thus,  the  Challenged  Orders  have  not  prohibited  them  from  operating \ncompletely. Accordingly, they do not run afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Hu v. City of \nNew York, 927 F. 3d 81, 102 (2d Cir. 2019) (“the right of occupational choice is afforded Due \nProcess protection only when a plaintiff is ‘complete[ly] prohibit[ed]’ from engaging in his or \nher chosen profession) (quoting Conn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 292 (1999)); see also Columbus \nAle House, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 191828 *12 (finding that plaintiff is unlikely to succeed on \nits claim that the COVID-19 related restriction prohibiting service after midnight in New York \nCity  restaurants  arbitrarily  infringes  on  due  process  rights).  Furthermore,  lost  revenue  is \ninsufficient to support a due process claim.  See Hu, 927 F. 3d at 102; see also JWJ Indus., Inc., \nv. Oswego Cty., 538 F. App’x 11, 14 (2d Cir. 2013). \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 22 of 34\n \n3.  Even assuming plaintiffs identified a property or liberty interest of which \nthey were deprived, they were not entitled to a pre-deprivation hearing. \nDue process does not automatically trigger a right to a pre-deprivation hearing.  \nParratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527 (1981). Rather, summary administrative action is justified to \nprotect the health and safety of the public. Hodel v. Va. Surface Mining & Reclamation Ass’n, \n452 U.S. 264, 300 (1981). Indeed, deprivation of property to protect the public health and safety \nis “[one] of the oldest examples” of permissible summary action. Id. at 300, quoting Ewing v. \nMytinger & Casselberry Inc., 339 U.S. 594, 599 (1950); see also, Cantazaro v. Weiden, 188 F.3d \n56, 62 (2d Cir. 1998).   \nPreventing the further spread of COVID-19 justifies such summary administrative \naction.  See Savage v. Mills, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141628 *20; World Gym, Inc. v. Baker, \n2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131236 *11-12 (D. Mass. July 24, 2020); Benner v. Wolf, No. 20-cv-\n775, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89425 *11 (M.D. Pa. May 21, 2020); Page, 2020 U. S. Dist. LEXIS \n183769 *32. “[T]he COVID-19 scenario is the kind of scenario for which emergency action \nwould be expected. Bayley’s Campground Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94296 *32 (D. Me. May \n29, 2020).  Accordingly, plaintiffs have been afforded all of the process they are due with respect \nto the Challenged Orders by their ability to commence the instant action. \nB.  The Challenged Orders do not violate substantive due process.  \nPlaintiffs’  substantive  due  process  claim  similarly  fails.  In  order  to  state  a \nsubstantive due process claim, “a plaintiff must demonstrate not only government action but also \nthat the government action was ‘so egregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock \nthe contemporary conscience.’” Pollok v. Chen, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 9261, *10-11 (2nd Cir. \n2020), 2020 WL 1456495 *45 (quoting Pena v. DePrisco, 432 F.3d 98, 112 (2d Cir. 2005)).  \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 23 of 34\n \nPlaintiffs  have  failed  to  adequately  plead  that  the  Challenged  Orders  are \nconscience-shocking.  Only a narrow range of extreme government conduct falls within the \nscope of a substantive due process claim. Indeed, only egregious or outrageous conduct that \nshocks the conscience is actionable.  See County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 847 n.8 \n(1998); see also Poe v. Leonard, 282 F.3d 123, 139 (2d Cir. 2002) (applying Sacramento). The \nSecond Circuit has expounded on this standard and required the government conduct to be \n“brutal and offensive to human dignity….” Smith v. Half Hollow Hills Cent. School Dist., 298 \nF.3d 168, 173 (2d Cir. 2002) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Put another way, there \nmust be a “malicious and sadistic” abuse of power that has no legitimate government purpose \nand that is intended to oppress or cause injury.  See Velez v. Levy, 401 F.3d 75, 94 (2d Cir. \n2005).  It is axiomatic that the City and State have a strong interest in stopping the spread of \nCOVID-19.    This  Court  and  others  have  already  held  that  COVID-19  related  business \nrestrictions, including those challenged herein, clearly do not shock the conscience.  See Hopkins \nHawley LLC, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24580, *17; World Gym, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131236 \n*12; Page, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183769, *31. \nFurthermore, as plaintiffs have failed to identify a fundamental right with which \nthe Challenged Orders interfere, rational basis review applies.  Hopkins Hawley LLC, 2021 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 24580, *17, 20; Our Wicked Lady LLC, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44505, *9-10.  The \nChallenged Orders easily satisfy this standard.  “The [Challenged Orders] undeniably passes \nrational basis scrutiny:  It is premised on a conceivable scientific basis that is rationally related to \nmitigating the further spread of the COVID-19 virus.”  Hopkins Hawley LLC, 2021 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 24580, *20-21.  See also Our Wicked Lady LLC, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44505, *10-11. \nAccordingly, plaintiffs’ substantive due process claim must be dismissed. \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 24 of 34\n \nPOINT IV \nPLAINTIFFS’  DORMANT  COMMERCE \nCLAUSE CLAIM FAILS    \nPlaintiffs assert in a mere conclusory manner that “the Orders violate the Dormant \nCommerce Clause in that they disproportionately burden interstate commerce as it requires out-\nof-state commerce to be conducted at the direction of Governor Cuomo’s Orders.” Compl., ¶ \n125. Plaintiffs’ claim fails. \n“For any challenge brought under the dormant Commerce Clause, courts must \ndetermine  whether  the  challenged  act  treats  in-state  and  out-of-state  economic  interests \ndifferently such that the act ‘benefits the former and burden the latter.’”  Mich. Rest. & Lodging \nAss’n v. Gordon, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 220880, *5 (W.D. Mich. Nov. 20, 2020) (internal \ncitations omitted). Local provisions violate the dormant Commerce Clause if they: (1) have “the \npractical effect of extraterritorial control of commerce occurring entirely outside the boundaries \nof the state in question,” (2) “clearly discriminates against interstate commerce in favor of \nintrastate commerce,” or (3) “imposes a burden on interstate commerce incommensurate with \nlocal benefits secured.”  Jones v. Schneiderman, 974 F. Supp. 2d 322, 349 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) \n(citation omitted).  \nTo start, plaintiffs have not and cannot plausibly alleged that the Challenged \nOrders violate the extraterritorial prong of the dormant Commerce Clause since the Challenged \nOrders neither regulate conduct nor directly control commerce outside of New York. Indeed, the \nChallenged  Orders  (which  have  been  superseded  by  less  restrictive  orders)  temporarily \nprohibited indoor dining at restaurants and bars operating in New York City; they did not \nprohibit  indoor  dining  at  restaurants  and  bars  operating  beyond  New  York’s  borders.  See \nHopkins Hawley, LLC, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24580, *18-19 (“because the Dining Policy only \n15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 25 of 34\n \napplies  to  restaurants  in  New  York  and  New  York  City,  it  neither  ‘discriminates’  against \ninterstate commerce nor has the “practical effect” of exerting ‘extraterritorial control’ over it’”); \nMich. Restaurant, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 220880, *6 (“the EO temporarily restricts indoor \ndining at restaurants and bars operating in Michigan, it does not close restaurants and bars \nbeyond Michigan’s borders.”); Antietam Battlefield KOA v. Hogan, 461 F. Supp. 3d 214, 239 \n(D. Md. May 20, 2020) (the Governor’s order  “only orders the closure of certain Maryland \nbusinesses, and does not regulate out-of-state businesses.”). Plaintiffs fail to allege that the \nChallenged Orders will have any impact on commerce outside of New York City. \nPlaintiffs do not and cannot adequately allege that the Challenged Orders clearly \ndiscriminate against interstate commerce. A “clearly discriminatory law may operate in three \nways: (1) by discriminating against interstate commerce on its face . . . (2) by harboring a \ndiscriminatory purpose . . . or (3) by discriminating in its effect.”  Town of Southold v. Town of \nE. Hampton, 477 F.3d 38, 48 (2d Cir. 2007) (internal citations omitted); Antietam Battlefield, \n461 F. Supp. 3d at 239.  Plaintiffs fail to cite to any provision of the Challenged Orders that \ndiscriminates on its face. Indeed, while the Challenged Orders prohibit indoor dining in New \nYork  City,  their  terms  do  not  favor  in-state  commercial  interests  nor  disfavor  out-of-state \ncommercial interests. See Antietam Battlefield, 461 F. Supp. 3d at 239 (the Governor’s order \nwas “not facially discriminatory against interstate commerce, as it only orders the closure of \ncertain Maryland businesses, and does not regulate out-of-state businesses.”); Oregon Rest. & \nLodging Ass’n v. Brown, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 220414, at *12 (D. Or. Nov. 24, 2020) \n(Governor’s executive order “does not discriminate in favor of in-state interests.”). Additionally, \nthe Challenged Orders do not have a discriminatory purpose or effect. Indeed, there is “no \nindication  that  the  purpose  of  the  [Challenged  Orders]  is  to  ‘advance  [New  York’s]  own \n16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 26 of 34\n \ncommercial  interests  by  curtailing  the  movement  of  articles  of  commerce.’”  Antietam \nBattlefield, 461 F. Supp. 3d at 239 (internal citations omitted); Oregon Rest., 2020 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 220414, at *12-13 (plaintiffs fail to allege that the COVID–19 executive orders were \nenacted with a discriminatory purpose; “[t]he Order regulates without regard to geographic \norigin, meaning it is not discriminatory.”). Here, the Challenged Orders were issued with the \nclear purpose of reducing the transmission of COVID-19 and keeping New York City residents \nsafe, clearly not a discriminatory purpose. Finally, the Challenged Orders have no discriminatory \neffect or impact on restaurants outside of New York. There is no indication that the Challenged \nOrders “negatively impact[] interstate commerce to a greater degree than intrastate commerce” \nand plaintiffs don’t state otherwise. See Antietam Battlefield, 461 F. Supp. 3d at 239 (finding no \ndormant Commerce Clause violation, as, “the order negatively impacts intrastate commerce to a \ngreater degree, as it only applies to Maryland businesses.”).  \nThe third prong of the dormant Commerce Clause, known as the Pike balancing \ntest, applies when a statute’s alleged effect on interstate commerce is incidental – however, we \ndo not concede there is any such incidental effect.  Pike v. Bruce Church Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 142 \n(1970).  Under  Pike,  courts  uphold  nondiscriminatory  statutes  having  incidental  effects  on \ninterstate commerce unless the burden on such commerce is “clearly excessive” with regard to \nthe  local  benefit.  Id.  at  142.    The  burden  “appropriately  considered  in  Commerce  Clause \nbalancing  [under  Pike]  is  the  degree  to  which  the  [challenged]  state  action  incidentally \ndiscriminates against interstate commerce relative to intrastate commerce.”  Northern Southern \nCorp.  v.  Oberly,  822 F.2d 388, 406 (3d Cir. 1987). “The plaintiff[] bear[s] the burden of \nshowing  that  the  burden  on  interstate  commerce  outweighs  the  local  benefits.”  Antietam \nBattlefield, 461 F. Supp. 3d at 239.  \n17 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 27 of 34\n \nEven if there is an incidental effect on interstate commerce, which plaintiffs do \nnot allege (nevertheless establish), plaintiffs fail to allege that any such incidental burden is \n“clearly excessive” in comparison to the local benefits of the Challenged Orders. The local \nbenefit  of  the  Challenged  Orders—to  minimize  the  indoor  interactions  between  unmasked \nindividuals who may unknowingly transmit the virus to others, thereby curbing the spread of \nCOVID-19—is a legitimate local interest. See, e.g. Hopkins Hawley, LLC, 2021 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 24580, * 19 (“even assuming that the Dining Policy has imposed incidental burdens on \ninterstate commerce—for example, on out-of-state restaurant suppliers or interstate travelers—\nthe Plaintiffs have not shown that these burdens are ‘incommensurate’ with the local benefit of \nmitigating further transmission of the COVID-19 virus.”); Plaza Motors of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, \n2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12726, *18-19 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 22, 2021).  \nPOINT V \nPLAINTIFFS’  FIRST  AMENDMENT \nFREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY CLAIM FAILS.   \nIn an attempt to support their First Amendment claim, plaintiffs merely assert that \ndefendants  have  deprived  plaintiffs  of,  “the  right  to  publicly  assemble  and  protest  our \ngovernment.” Compl. at ¶ 109.  Plaintiffs fail to plead, however, how this alleged deprivation is \nconnected to the Challenged Orders.  Compl. at ¶¶ 108-118.  Such conclusory assertions are \ninsufficient to support the claim.  “Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, \nsupported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.   \nFreedom of Assembly24 does not exist in the abstract. Roberts v. United States \nJaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 622 (1984); Wine & Spirits Retailers, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 418 F.3d 36, \n                                                           \n24 Today, freedom of association and freedom of assembly are largely viewed as one. See Givens v. \nNewsom, 459 F. Supp. 3d 1302, 1314 (E.D.C.A. 2020), quoting Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. at 618. \n18 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 28 of 34\n \n50 (5th Cir. 2005).  To trigger First Amendment protections, the assembly must be for an \nexpressive purpose.  Jacoby & Meyers, LLP v. Presiding Justices of the First, Second, Third & \nFourth Dep’ts, 852 F.3d 178, 187-188 (2d Cir. 2017); Givens v. Newsom, 459 F. Supp. 3d at \n1314,  quoting  Roberts,  468  U.S.  at  618.  “[T]he  State  does  not  lose  its  power  to  regulate \ncommercial activity deemed harmful to the public whenever speech is a component of that \nactivity.” Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass’n, 436 U.S. 447, 456 (1978).     \nSmall talk and the exchange of pleasantries are not entitled to First Amendment \nprotection. See Dallas v. Stanglin, 409 U.S. 19, 24 (1989)(“dance-hall patrons – coming together \nto engage in recreational dancing – is not protected by the First Amendment.”); Wine & Spirits \nRetailers, Inc., 418 F.3d at 53(“[c]ertainly, the mere fact that the joint activities that define the \nbusiness  relationship  between  the  franchisor  and  its  franchisees  have  some  communicative \ncomponent cannot, in and of itself, establish an entitlement to the prophylaxis of the First \nAmendment.”);  Hopkins  Hawley,  LLC,  2021  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  24580,  *20;  SH3  Health \nConsulting, LLC v. Page, 459 F. Supp. 3d 1212, 1225 (E.D.M.O. 2020); H’s Bar, 2020 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 218371 *11. Accordingly, as plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege that the \nChallenged Orders interfere with their ability to associate for an expressive purpose the Freedom \nof Assembly claim must be dismissed. \nMoreover, even if plaintiffs had sufficiently asserted that the temporary restaurant \nrestrictions trigger First Amendment protections, such restrictions do not violate plaintiffs’ First \nAmendment rights.  As set forth in Rockwell v. Town of Hamden, the right to peaceably \nassemble, ‘is not absolute.”  800 Fed. App’x 54, 55 (2d Cir. 2020). The Challenged Orders, \nwhich are clearly content-neutral, time, place and manner restrictions in that they are wholly \nunrelated to the suppression of ideas, are justified in that they are “narrowly tailored to serve a \n19 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 29 of 34\n \nsignificant  governmental  interest”  and  “they  leave  open  ample  alternative  channels  for \ncommunication of the information.”  Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989). \nIndeed, not only do they serve a significant interest, but as the Supreme Court recently held, \nstemming the spread of COVID-19 is an “unquestionably” compelling interest.  Roman Catholic \nDiocese, 208 L. Ed. 206, 209. “[R]estrictions on the time, place, or manner of protected speech \nare  not  invalid  ‘simply  because  there  is  some  imaginable  alternative  that  might  be  less \nburdensome on speech.’” Warde at 797. Finally, alternative avenues of expressive-association \nwere available to plaintiffs when the Challenged Orders were in effect.  \nPOINT VI \nMAYOR  DE  BLASIO  IS  ENTITLED  TO \nQUALIFIED IMMUNITY.   \n“Qualified  immunity  shields  federal  and  state  officials  from  money  damages \nunless a plaintiff pleads facts showing (1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional \nright, and (2) that the right was “clearly established” at the time of the challenged conduct.” \nAshcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 735 (2011). As set forth above, the Complaint fails to \nadequately plead that plaintiffs’ constitutional rights were violated.  See Points II-V, supra.  \nConsequently, Mayor de Blasio is entitled to qualified immunity.  Moreover, the Complaint is \ndevoid of any specific allegations with respect to the Mayor’s personal involvement in any of the \nchallenged actions. \nEven if this Court were to find that any of plaintiffs’ Constitutional claims have \nmerit, Mayor de Blasio would still be entitled to qualified immunity in that is was not and is still  \nnot “clearly established” that any of the Challenged Orders violate plaintiffs’ constitutional \nrights.  “‘Clearly established’ means that, at the time of the officer’s conduct, the law was \nsufficiently clear that every ‘reasonable  official  would  understand  that  what  he  is doing’ is \n20 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 30 of 34\n \nunlawful.” Liberian Cmty. Ass’n of Conn. v. Lamont, 970 F.3d 174. 186 (2d Cir. 2020)(citations \nomitted).    The  unprecedented  COVID-19  virus  has  required  unprecedented  government \nresponses, to which many legal challenges are still winding their way through the judicial \nsystem.  To the extent there is precedent regarding the constitutionality of restrictions imposed \non  businesses,  it  indicates  that  restrictions  such  as  those  challenged  herein  are  not \nunconstitutional.  Mayor de Blasio is therefore entitled to qualified immunity in that even if he in \nany way violated plaintiffs’ constitutional rights by enforcing the State E.O.s as directed to by \nthe Governor, such a violation was not clearly established.  See id. at 187-193 (holding that the \ndoctor who issued quarantine orders in response to the Ebola epidemic was entitled to qualified \nimmunity as it was not clearly established that such orders violated due process).  \nPOINT VII \nTHIS  COURT  SHOULD  NOT  EXERCISE \nSUPPLEMENTAL  JURISDICTION  OVER \nPLAINTIFFS’  STATE  CLAIM,  WHICH  IN \nANY EVENT, FAILS.   \nA.  This Court should not exercise supplemental jurisdiction. \nPlaintiffs additionally argue that the City improperly delegated legislative powers \nto the executive branch.  Since plaintiff’s federal claims fail to state a claim for the reasons set \nforth in Points II-V, supra, this Court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over \nplaintiffs’ state law claim against the City defendants and it should be dismissed. \nDistrict Courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction if the court has \ndismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1367©(3).  Further, \nsupplemental jurisdiction is rarely appropriate where the federal claims have been dismissed on a \nmotion.  See Valencia v. Lee, 316 F.3d 299, 305 (2d Cir. 2003); Giordano v. City of New York, \n274  F.3d  740,  754-755  (2d  Cir.  2001).  In  particular,  District  Courts  decline  to  exercise \n21 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 31 of 34\n \nsupplemental jurisdiction where state law claims “raise a novel or complex issue of State law.”  \n28 U.S.C. § 1367©(1); see also Carver v. Nassau County Interim Finance Authority, 730 F.3d \n150, 154-55 (2d Cir. 2013); Kolari v. N.Y.-Presbyterian Hosp., 455 F.3d 118, 124 (2d Cir. 2006) \n(“We have repeatedly held that a district court particularly abuses its discretion when it retains \njurisdiction over state-law claims raising unsettled questions of law following dismissal of all \noriginal-jurisdiction claims.”) (collecting cases). Here, plaintiffs’ claim that the actions taken by \nthe City defendants in response to COVID-19 violate the separation of powers raises a novel \nissue of state law.  In the absence of any federal claims, this determination should be made by \nNew York State courts. \nB.  Plaintiffs fail to adequately plead that the City defendants violated the Separation of \nPowers or exceeded their authority. \nThe Complaint does not identify any specific action taken by City defendants \nwhich plaintiffs allege violated the separation of powers or exceeded authority.  See Compl. ¶ \n146-150.  Accordingly,  the  fourth  cause  of  action  must  be  dismissed  as  against  the  City \ndefendants. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. \nEven assuming arguendo plaintiffs had adequately pled that the City defendants \nviolated the separation of powers or exceeded their authority, the claim fails.  The actions taken \nby Mayor de Blasio in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are within the power granted to him \nby the legislature.  New York Executive Law (“Exec. Law”) § 24 authorizes the Mayor to \nproclaim a local state of emergency, in the event of a disaster such as an epidemic or disease \noutbreak, and upon a finding by the Mayor that the public safety is imperiled by such public \nemergency.  The COVID-19 global pandemic clearly triggered the Mayor’s authority to proclaim \na local state of emergency.  Mayor de Blasio declared such an emergency through the issuance of \nNew York City Emergency Executive Order No. 98 on March 12, 2020.  Exec. Law § 24 further \n22 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 32 of 34\n \nprovides that once the Mayor declares a local state of emergency, he may issue local emergency \norders, “to protect life and property or to bring the emergency situation under control.”  Any \nchallenged orders issued by the Mayor were issued in accordance with the authority granted to \nhim by the legislature.  Moreover, any relevant City Emergency Executive Orders were issued in \norder to comply with the Governor’s directives. \nThe delegation of authority set forth in Exec. Law § 24 is constitutional.  Not only \nis it limited to disasters and public emergencies, it provides clear guidance as to the measures the \nMayor is authorized to take in the face of such emergencies, such as the regulation and closing of \nplaces of amusement and assembly and the prohibition and control of persons on public streets \nand places.  See Exec. Law § 24(a) and (c).  The actions taken by the Mayor fell squarely within \nthe authority proscribed by Executive Law § 24. \nNew York courts have upheld legislative delegations to the Executive that were \nmuch more general and broad than Exec. Law § 24. See Levine v. Whalen, 39 N.Y.2d 510, 515-\n517 (1976) (holding that the Legislature’s delegation of power to the executive branch, under \nPublic Health Law § 2800, “to provide for the protection and promotion” of public health was \n“not so vague and indefinite as to set no standard or to outline no policy”); Garcia v. N.Y.C. \nDept. of Health & Mental Hygiene, 31 N.Y.3d 601, 612 (2018); Boreali v. Axelrod, 71 N.Y.2d 1 \n(1987). “We have thus acknowledged that there need not be a specific and detailed legislative \nexpression authorizing a particular executive act as long as ‘the basic policy decisions underlying \nthe regulations have been made and articulated by the Legislature.’” Bourquin v. Cuomo, 85 \nN.Y.2d 78, 784 (1995) (citations omitted).25   \n                                                           \n25 Plaintiffs assert as their Fifth Cause of Action that the Challenged Orders are unconstitutional “as \napplied to a properly filtered and compliant space.” Complaint, ¶¶ 151-160. While it appears that \nplaintiffs are attempting to assert some sort of constitutional claim, they fail to clearly set forth any \n23 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 33 of 34\n \nPOINT VIII \nPLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS ARE MOOT. \nPlaintiffs have received the relief they seek—for indoor dining in New York City \nto resume. Complaint ¶ 39, Wherefore Clause. Accordingly, plaintiffs’ claims are moot. See \nFisher v. United States Atty., 722 F. App’x 40, 41 (2d Cir. 2018) (internal citations omitted)(“A \ncase becomes moot, at any stage of litigation, when there is no longer a live case or controversy \nfor a court to decide, such as when the plaintiff has already received the relief sought.”); Fox v. \nBd. of Trs. of the State Univ., 42 F.3d 135, 140 (2d Cir. 1994) (a federal court has no jurisdiction \nto decide a case where the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the \nlitigation). Since the filing of this action in December 2020, indoor dining in New York City \nreopened on February 12, 2021 at 25% capacity. See State E.O. No. 202.93.  Subsequently, \nbeginning on March 19, 2021, the State authorized indoor dining in New York City restaurants at \n50%  capacity.  See State E.O.  No. 202.97. Accordingly, as New  York City restaurants  are \ncurrently  open  for  indoor  dining  at  50%  capacity,  this  Court  cannot  provide  any  legally \ncognizable benefit to plaintiffs, and the issues raised in the Complaint are no longer “live.”  See, \ne.g., Fisher, 722 F. App’x at 41; Fox., 42 F.3d at 140. \n       Moreover, the fact that the Challenged Orders were superseded by subsequent less \nrestrictive orders further renders plaintiffs’ claims moot. See State E.O.s 202.93, 202.96 and \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \ncognizable legal theory. Indeed, at the very end of this cause of action, plaintiffs make one passing \nmention of the term “regulatory taking” yet fail to plead a takings claim at all. Id. at ¶ 160. Regardless, \nbecause none of plaintiffs’ constitutional claims are viable as stated above, rational basis review applies. \nHopkins  Hawley  LLC,  2021  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  24580,  *  20-21.  The  restrictions  set  forth  in  the \nChallenged Orders “undeniably pass[] rational basis scrutiny” as they are “premised on a conceivable \nscientific basis that is rationally related to mitigating the further spread of the COVID-19 virus.” Id. at 21. \nTherefore,  any  assertion  that  the  Challenged  Orders  are  unconstitutional  as  applied  to  plaintiffs \nnecessarily fails.  \n24 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-10932-PAC   Document 65   Filed 04/02/21   Page 34 of 34\n \n202.97. “Once a law is off the books and replaced with a ‘new rule’ that does not injure the \nplaintiff, a case becomes moot, leaving us with an absence of jurisdiction to adjudicate the \ncase.’” Pleasant View Baptist Church v. Beshear, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 40077, at *5 (6th Cir. \nDec. 21, 2020) (internal citations omitted).  \nCONCLUSION \nFor all the reasons set forth herein, City defendants respectfully request that the \nCourt grant their motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety. \nDated:  New York, New York \nApril 2, 2021 \n   \n  By: _______/s/_________________________ \n \n       Kerri Devine \n \n       Samantha Schonfeld \n \n       Assistant Corporation Counsels \n \n \n \n25 ",
