On April 15, a state trial court judge granted an injunction against the state law that says conventions must take place no later than June 9. The Seventh Congressional District Republican Committee had filed the lawsuit, saying it needs more time to hold its convention. The decision was made by Judge Bradley Cavedo of the 13th judicial circuit in Richmond.</blockquote></p>",
