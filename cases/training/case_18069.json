As explained on the record, the court GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART the motion. Specifically, the court granted the motion as to plaintiffs' request for the production of documents and responding to interrogatories (reframed as requests for admissions) but limited the scope of the interrogatories and documents to those pertinent to experiences in the State of Wisconsin. Answers to interrogatories 1-8 (reframed as requests for admissions) are due by noon on Tuesday, July 28, 2020; responsive documents (i.e., non-privileged documents that support or contradict each of the 8 narrowed requests to admit in the possession of the Republican Party of Wisconsin) are to be produced by Wednesday, July 29, 2020. The court also granted plaintiffs' request for a 30(b)(6) deposition, although limited in scope to designees for the 8 topics in the narrowed requests to admit and in time to a half day (or half hour per topic). The deposition should be completed on or before Friday, July 31, 2020. The court remains available to resolve any further disputes. Signed by District Judge William M. Conley on 7/27/2020.

Represented by private counsel as well as attorneys from the Protect Democracy Project and the MacArthur Justice Center, the plaintiffs alleged that the Wisconsin state primary election held on April 7, 2020, during one of the most acute periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, disenfranchised Wisconsin voters on a massive scale. Specifically, the complaint alleged that by holding elections in which certain populations had to choose between exercising their right to vote and protecting their health, the defendants violated Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act, the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment&mdash;both substantive and procedural&mdash;and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief to require the WEC to take affirmative measures in the then-forthcoming elections, injunctive relief preventing the enforcement of certain state statutes, and attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to District Judge William M. Conley and related to cases <a href=\"../../../../case/17437/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Democratic National Committee v. Bostelmann</em></a> (consolidated with <em>Gear v. Bostelmann</em> (3:20-cv-00278) and <em>Lewis v. Bostelmann</em> (3:20-cv-00284) and <em><a href=\"../../../../case/18067/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Edwards v. Vos</a></em>.</p>\r\n<p>On June 8, 2020, the Republican National Committee, the Republican Party of Wisconsin, and the Wisconsin Legislature (in a separate motion) moved to intervene as defendants in the case, arguing they had interests at stake in the litigation and that the existing defendants would not adequately represent the proposed defendants&rsquo; interests. The plaintiffs opposed the RNC and Republican Party&rsquo;s motion but did not oppose the Legislature&rsquo;s. On June 23, 2020, Judge Conley granted both motions to intervene. He held that the Legislature had the right to intervene and allowed the RNC and Republican Party to intervene under permissive intervention because, among other reasons, they were already defendants in the above related cases.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Also on June 23, 2020, the plaintiffs amended their complaint, making minor changes to their factual allegations and removing their claim for relief under substantive due process. The next day, June 24, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, arguing that they were likely to prevail on the merits of their claims and without a preliminary injunction they would suffer irreparable harm because the same disenfranchisement alleged to have occurred in the April 7 elections would happen again in the August and November elections. They further argued that the balance of hardships favored an injunction because without judicial intervention the election would be undermined, and the measures proposed would merely create an administrative burden of implementation for the state. The plaintiffs asked the court to prevent the enforcement of Wisconsin statutes pertaining to absentee voting and order the state to take measures to make in-person voting safe while ensuring the accessibility of absentee voting to all Wisconsin voters.</p>\r\n<p>On July 8, 2020, the plaintiffs of all the related cases, some of which were filed prior to the April 7 election, jointly moved for a renewed preliminary injunction for the November general election. They noted that nearly 62 percent of Wisconsin&rsquo;s electorate chose to vote by mail in the April 7 election and that the pandemic continues to worsen. On July 20, 2020, the defendants opposed the motion, and the Wisconsin State Legislature sought to dismiss the Swenson plaintiffs&rsquo; complaints. They argued that, unlike the April Election, Wisconsin voters had months to register to vote and to request an absentee ballot in advance of the November Election.</p>\r\n<p>On September 21, 2020, the court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; preliminary injunction and extended the mail-in ballot deadline, finding that: \"(1) an unprecedented number of absentee ballots, which turned the predominance of in-person voting on its head in April, will again overwhelm the WEC and local officials despite their best efforts to prepare; (2) but for an extension of the deadlines for registering to vote electronically and for receipt of absentee ballots, tens of thousands of Wisconsin voters would have been disenfranchised in April; and (3) absent similar relief, will be again in November.\" 488 F. Supp. 3d.</p>\r\n<p>The court did, however, stay the order for seven days to provide defendants the opportunity to seek an emergency appeal. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal with the Seventh Circuit two days later, on September 23. On September 29, the Seventh Circuit held that the intervening defendants had no Article III standing to proceed, and denied the interlocutory appeal to stay the district court&rsquo;s injunction. 976 F.3d 764. However, on October 2, in response to a request for reconsideration, the Seventh Circuit certified to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin the question of whether, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 803.09(2m), the Wisconsin State Legislature had the authority to represent the State of Wisconsin&rsquo;s interest in the validity of state laws. The court accepted the certification and responded that the Wisconsin State Legislature did indeed have this authority. 949 N.W.2d 423. Thereafter, the Seventh Circuit granted the petition for reconsideration and addressed the Wisconsin State Legislature&rsquo;s motion on the merits.</p>\r\n<p>On October 8, the Seventh Circuit issued an order staying the injunction issued by the district court pending final disposition of appeals. 977 F.3d 639. The court held that, under <em>Purcell v. Gonzalez</em>, &ldquo;reading the Constitution to extend deadlines near the election is difficult to justify when the voters have had a long time to cast ballots while preserving social distancing.&rdquo; Judge Rovner dissented, arguing that by granting the stay, the court &ldquo;adopt[ed] a hands-off approach to election governance that elevates legislative prerogative over a citizen&rsquo;s fundamental right to vote.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 13, the plaintiffs applied to the Supreme Court of the United States to vacate the Seventh Circuit&rsquo;s stay of the injunction. In an October 26 plurality decision, the Court held merely that the application to vacate the stay was denied. Chief Justice Roberts wrote a concurrence that agreed with the Seventh Circuit that the injunction was untimely given the nearness of the election. Justice Gorsuch, joined by Justice Kavanaugh, wrote a concurrence that argued the District Court&rsquo;s original injunction was an inappropriate substitution of the court&rsquo;s judgment for the Wisconsin Legislature&rsquo;s as to how much protection from COVID-19 was sufficient to protect the voting rights of its citizens. In his own concurrence, Justice Kavanaugh added to the other Justices&rsquo; points above that he believed the normal deadline didn&rsquo;t disenfranchise voters at all in the first place. In dissent, joined by Justices Sotomayor and Breyer, Justice Kagan pointed to the realities that COVID-19 was worse than it was in April, and would likely overwhelm election workers worse in November than it did then, to conclude that disenfranchisement would take place without the injunction. 141 S.Ct. 28.</p>\r\n<p>Following final disposition of all appeals, the Seventh Circuit issued an order on December 18, 2020 vacating the district court&rsquo;s injunction and remanded with instructions to determine whether a case or controversy continues with respect to any aspect of the case, otherwise the suits should be dismissed as moot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Returning to the district court, Judge Conley allowed the remaining plaintiffs until January 29, 2021 to explain why the court should not dismiss their case. Plaintiffs filed stipulations of dismissal on December 23, 2020, and the court terminated the case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1). &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case is closed.</p>",

The Wisconsin Legislature, the Republican Party of Wisconsin, and the Republican National Committee intervened as defendants in the case. On September 21, Judge Conley issued an order granting the plaintiffs' preliminary injunction but stayed it pending appeal. The Seventh Circuit dismissed the appeal as to defendants Republican National Committee and Republican Party of Wisconsin, but held that the Wisconsin State Legislature had Article III standing after certifying the question to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. On the merits, the Seventh Circuit stayed and later vacated the district court injunction, holding that federal courts should ordinarily not alter election procedures so close to an election under Purcell v. Gonzalez. The Supreme Court affirmed the stay on October 26, 2020. The remaining plaintiffs filed stipulations of dismissal, and the court terminated the case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1) on January 20, 2021. The case is closed.",

Although Defendants took steps to administer the election fairly, including \nsome at the order of this Court, those actions were insufficient to protect the rights of Wisconsin \nvoters.  Citizens across the state encountered obstacles at every stage of the voting process, \nincluding registering to vote, requesting and receiving absentee ballots, and returning their \nabsentee ballots to be counted.  Voters who attempted to vote in person encountered long waits \nand voting locations that lacked adequate safety protocols and supplies for voters and poll \nworkers alike, forcing voters to risk their own health and that of their loved ones to exercise their \nconstitutional rights to participate in their democracy.   \n  Plaintiffs—individual Wisconsin voters who were disenfranchised or unable to vote \nsafely in the April election, and organizations whose work and missions suffered due to these \nwidespread election breakdowns in April—filed this suit to prevent a replay of this mass \ndisenfranchisement in the November presidential election.  Medical and public-health experts \nproject that, like the April 7 election, the impending November election will occur in the midst of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic and present extraordinary challenges to election administrators and \nvoters.  Yet Defendants have failed to take the steps necessary to safeguard Wisconsinites’ right \nto vote.  And the clock is ticking: without swift action to improve safety and voting access in the \nupcoming November election, relief may become practically impossible.1  \n  Plaintiffs seek an order enjoining the enforcement of certain statutory requirements that \nfatally impair Defendants’ ability to administer the election effectively during the pandemic and \n                                                 \n1 Report of Kevin J. Kennedy (“Kennedy Report”), ¶ 37.  \n1 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 13 of 79\n \nrequiring Defendants to implement reasonable measures to ensure that the fundamental \nbreakdowns plaguing the April election do not recur in the upcoming November election.  \nSpecifically, to comply with Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, and the First and Fourteenth Amendments, Defendants must ensure that in-\nperson voting can be safely conducted; adequate numbers of poll workers can open and \nadminister safe, in-person polling locations; ample, safe opportunities for in-person absentee \nvoting are available; all voters who request and are qualified to receive absentee ballots in fact \ntimely receive those ballots; voters can safely, effectively, and timely return their absentee \nballots so their votes are counted; and online systems designed to register voters and request \nabsentee ballots are sufficient to handle anticipated voter traffic.  And critically, to restore public \nconfidence in the electoral process and prevent further disenfranchisement, Defendants must \neducate the Wisconsin public about how to vote safely.  Absent this Court’s intervention, \nDefendants’ administration of the November presidential election will violate Plaintiffs’ \nstatutory and constitutional rights.   \nBACKGROUND  \nI.  THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC \n  COVID-19 is “a novel severe acute respiratory illness that has killed … more than \n100,000 nationwide.”  S. Bay United Pentacostal Church v. Newsom, 590 U.S. __ (2020), slip \nop. at 1 (Roberts, J., concurring).  The virus “spread[s] mainly from person-to-person” through \n“respiratory droplets,” and is more likely to spread “between people who are in close contact \nwith one another (within about 6 feet).”2   \n                                                 \n2 Statement of Proposed Facts in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for A Preliminary Injunction \n(“SOPF”) ¶ 1. \n2 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 14 of 79\n \nThe first confirmed case in Wisconsin was diagnosed on February 5, 2020.3  It was the \ntwelfth case in the United States and a harbinger of over 2 million more to come.4  Since \nFebruary, over 25,000 people have tested positive for COVID-19 in Wisconsin alone.5  And \nexperts predict that “over the next several months”—“from June to November 2020”—it is likely \nthat “Wisconsin will see continued community transmission [of COVID-19] (at best), and may \nsee increased transmission and more outbreaks (at worst).”6   \n  In-person voting under these circumstances poses “a significant risk to human health.”7  \nPhysically casting a ballot requires voters and poll workers to come “in[to] close contact with \none another,” and to “touch[] surfaces or objects at [the] polling place, such as door handles, \ntables, pens, and ballots.”8  And because infected people are often “contagious before the onset \nof symptoms, [or] never develop symptoms,” it is virtually impossible to keep polling places \nvirus-free.9  There will consequently be “a significant risk of contracting and transmitting \nCOVID-19 in Wisconsin during any in-person voting for the November 2020 elections in \nWisconsin,” with dangerous—and potentially fatal—consequences for many Wisconsinites.10   \n                                                 \n3 SOPF ¶ 3. \n4 SOPF ¶ 4. \n5 SOPF ¶ 4. \n6 SOPF ¶ 6; Report of Patrick Remington, MD, MPH (“Remington Report”), at 7. \n7 SOPF ¶ 7; Remington Report at 8.   \n8 SOPF ¶ 8; Remington Report at 9.   \n9 SOPF ¶ 9; Remington Report at 9. \n10 SOPF ¶ 10; Remington Report at 10. \n3 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 15 of 79\n \nII.  THE APRIL 7 ELECTION \nA.  Defendants Declined To Adopt Policies And Practices To Ensure Safe And \nEffective Voting Access Despite Clear Warning Signs.   \n  In the two months between the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Wisconsin and the \nApril 7, 2020 Election and Presidential Preference Primary, Defendants and other Wisconsin \nofficials failed to take the actions necessary to hold a safe election during the impending \npandemic.  At a February 27 meeting of the Wisconsin Elections Commission—the first at which \nCOVID-19 was discussed—Defendant Dean Knudson, at the time the Chair of the Commission, \ndismissed the need to plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.11  “[A]t worst,” Knudson said, “there \nwould be either long lines or a delay in reporting,” and the Commission has “robust procedures” \nfor absentee voting.12  Defendant Wolfe similarly stated:  “currently, [the Commission] do[es \nnot] talk about things like, you know, if all your poll workers are sick . . . what would you do?”13  \nExactly two weeks later, Governor Tony Evers declared a statewide public health emergency.14 \n  As confirmed case counts kept climbing in Wisconsin, local agencies and leaders \nsounded the alarm.  The Wisconsin Department of Health Services banned gatherings of 10 or \nmore people on March 17.15  The same day, the Mayor of Green Bay said that the city would be \n“unable to administer a normal election.”16  Multiple Defendants then acknowledged that it was \nnot possible to have a safe and fair election on April 7.  Defendant Jacobs said that she “no \nlonger believe[d] that we are able to fairly and properly administer this election without delay or \n                                                 \n11 SOPF ¶ 11. \n12 SOPF ¶ 12 \n13 SOPF ¶ 13. \n14 SOPF ¶ 14. \n15 SOPF ¶ 15. \n16 SOPF ¶ 16.  \n4 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 16 of 79\n \npostponement, . . . I believe we’re putting people at risk.”17  Defendant Thomsen likewise said \nthat “[Wisconsin is] going to have an election where no one can vote safely—that’s absurd.” 18  \nAnd Defendant Glancey argued in favor of an election by mail-in ballot only.19  \n  Defendants issued a memorandum on March 18, 2020 highlighting shortages of absentee-\nballot envelopes, polling locations, poll workers, and cleaning equipment.20  A few days later, a \nbipartisan group of mayors urged that the election be delayed.21  On March 24, Department of \nHealth Services Secretary-designee Andrea Palm issued Emergency Order No. 12, the Safer At \nHome Order.22  The Order banned all public and private gatherings, closed nonessential \nbusinesses, and required that everyone maintain social distancing of at least six feet from any \nother person.23  Nevertheless, the next day Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate \nMajority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said they did not expect to change the date of the election.24  \n  Several plaintiffs filed suit, seeking to ensure that all Wisconsinites could safely and \neffectively cast a ballot.  On April 2, 2020, this Court entered an injunction (a) ordering that \nabsentee ballots received by April 13 at 4 p.m. be counted; (b) extending by one day, to April 3, \nthe window to request an absentee ballot; and (c) adjusting the requirement under Wis. Stat. \n§ 6.87(2) that absentee voters have a witness sign their ballot, instead requiring Defendants to \n“accept an unwitnessed ballot” if it contains a sufficient affirmation or statement averring that \n                                                 \n17 SOPF ¶ 17. \n18 SOPF ¶ 18. \n19 SOPF ¶ 19. \n20 SOPF ¶ 20. \n21 SOPF ¶ 21.  \n22 SOPF ¶ 22. \n23 SOPF ¶ 23.  \n24 SOPF ¶ 24.  \n5 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 17 of 79\n \nthe voter was unable “to safely obtain a witness certification” despite using “reasonable efforts to \ndo so.”  Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann, 2020 WL 1638374, at *20, *22 (W.D. Wis. \nApr. 2, 2020) (hereinafter “DNC”).  The Seventh Circuit stayed the portion of this Court’s \ndecision requiring Defendants to accept unwitnessed ballots and declined to modify the \nextension of the absentee ballot deadline.  Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann, Nos. 20-\n1538, 1539, 1545, 1546, Order (7th Cir. April 3, 2020) (hereinafter “DNC II”). \n  On the same day as the Seventh Circuit’s decision, Governor Evers called a special \nlegislative session for the Legislature to consider postponing the April 7 election.25  But both the \nWisconsin Assembly and the Senate immediately adjourned the special session, ensuring that the \nApril 7 election would go forward as planned.26  As this Court noted, the Legislature’s decision \nwas “[c]ontrary to the view of at least a dozen other states, as well as the consensus of medical \nexperts across the country as to the gathering of large groups of people.”  DNC, 2020 WL \n1638374, at *1. \n  In a last-ditch effort, Governor Evers issued an executive order on April 6 suspending in-\nperson voting hours before polls opened on April 7.27  The Wisconsin Supreme Court enjoined \nthe Governor’s order28; shortly thereafter, the United States Supreme Court held that all absentee \nballots had to be postmarked by April 7 (in addition to being received by 4 P.M. on April 13) to \nbe counted, partially overturning this Court’s Order.  Republican Nat’l Comm. v. Democratic \nNat’l Comm., 140 S. Ct. 1205 (2020) (hereinafter “RNC”).  The Court noted that “[t]his Court \nhas repeatedly emphasized that lower federal courts should ordinarily not alter the election rules \n                                                 \n25 SOPF ¶ 28.  \n26 SOPF ¶ 29. \n27 SOPF ¶ 31. \n28 SOPF ¶ 32. \n6 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 18 of 79\n \non the eve of an election.”  Id. at 1207.  The election thus went forward in the midst of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. \nB.  Defendants’ Failure To Prepare Adequately For The April 7 Election Led To \nWidespread Disenfranchisement. \nDuring the April 7 election, problems arose with every method of voting and at every \nstep of the voting process.  Voters attempted to utilize the absentee ballot process in historically \nhigh numbers29 but faced a host of severely burdensome—and often insurmountable—barriers.  \nMeanwhile, voters who sought to vote in person faced huge waits and unsafe conditions due to \nthe mass closure of polling locations and shortage of poll workers.30  As a consequence of these \nand other problems, thousands of voters across Wisconsin—and in particular older, minority, and \nimmunocompromised voters—were disenfranchised.  \n1.  Defendants Did Not Take Reasonable And Available Steps To Ensure The \nMyVote Website Would Function Properly To Allow Voters To Register To \nVote And Request Absentee Ballots.  \n  Well before any voter even attempted to cast a ballot, problems arose with registration \nand absentee ballot requests.  Defendants administer a website called MyVote Wisconsin that, \namong other things, allows eligible Wisconsin residents to register to vote, request an absentee \nballot, and find their polling place.31  Months before the election, Defendants were aware that the \nwebsite experienced outages.32  Yet despite an increase in voters’ use of and reliance on MyVote \ndue to the pandemic,33 Defendants did not secure the server capacity and bandwidth necessary to \nmaintain the system.  Predictably, Wisconsin voters using MyVote for the April 7 election faced \n                                                 \n29 SOPF ¶ 35. \n30 SOPF ¶ 36. \n31 SOPF ¶ 37.  \n32 SOPF ¶ 38. \n33 SOPF ¶ 40. \n7 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 19 of 79\n \nsystem crashes that prevented them from accessing the site.34  The site also failed to record ballot \nrequests properly and to provide accurate information about the status of absentee ballot \nrequests.35   \nThe problems with MyVote are well documented.  An investigation by the Milwaukee \nJournal Sentinel, for instance, found that eligible voters in Lodi, Pewaukee, Marshfield, \nShorewood, and Bristol had trouble requesting absentee ballots online, either because the \nMyVote system crashed or because they finally gave up after spending hours trying to make their \nrequest via MyVote.36  Some Wisconsin voters requested absentee ballots through MyVote, the \ninvestigation found, only to be informed later that the MyVote system had no record of their \nrequest.37  Other voters received inaccurate information from MyVote’s ballot tracker system, \nleaving them with the (incorrect) impression that they would receive their absentee ballots before \nelection day.38  Defendant Wolfe acknowledged these failures, writing that voters attempting to \nuse MyVote experienced “unique challenges and obstacles” during the April election.39 \nDespite knowledge of problems with MyVote as early as February 2020,40 Defendants \ndid not take reasonable and available steps necessary to ensure the system would meet the needs \nof Wisconsin voters in April.  Those failures had meaningful consequences.

Defendants Did Not Take Reasonable And Available Steps To Ensure The \nAbsentee Voting System Could Handle The Increased Demand Resulting \nFrom Greatly Reduced, Unsafe In-Person Voting Options. \n  In other recent elections, absentee ballots cast by mail made up between 4.8% and 8.1% \nof the total votes.42  As a result of the pandemic, however, absentee ballots cast by mail made up \n61.8% percent of the total votes in the April 2020 election.43  Nevertheless—amidst \nunprecedented demand for absentee ballots in light of the COVID-19 pandemic—Defendants did \nnot ensure proper distribution, collection, and counting of absentee ballots, resulting in the \ndisenfranchisement of voters throughout the state.  Indeed, Defendants acknowledge that the \nincreases in absentee voting “created resource issues for a system primarily designed to support \npolling place voting.”44  But despite the availability of reasonable procedures that could have \nprevented the April 7 breakdowns, Defendants failed to implement them. \n  To begin, Defendants failed to take the necessary steps to ensure voters that requested \nabsentee ballots timely received them.  Some voters, as discussed above, faced technical issues \nwith MyVote preventing them from requesting absentee ballots, or resulting in their absentee \nballot request going unnoticed.

Other voters, like Plaintiffs Melody McCurtis \nand Maria Nelson, timely requested absentee ballots but never received them.45  They were not \nalone: more than 2,600 absentee ballots requested in Milwaukee were never sent as the result of \n                                                 \n41 SOPF ¶ 47. \n42 SOPF ¶ 49.   \n43 SOPF ¶ 48.  \n44 SOPF ¶ 50.   \n45 SOPF ¶ 51. \n9 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 21 of 79\n \na technical failure in the WisVote system and hundreds of absentee ballots were found \nundelivered to voters in Appleton, Oshkosh, and Fox Point.46  Issues at every level in the \ndistribution chain contributed to the breakdown of effective and equitable absentee-ballot \ndistribution.  Some municipalities but not others mailed registered voters absentee-ballot-request \nforms.47  Inadequately staffed offices were nearly overwhelmed by the demand for absentee \nballots.48  Clerks across the state reported a shortage of 600,000 absentee-certificate envelopes \nfor voters to use when returning their absentee ballots.49  And issues with mail delivery led to \nabsentee ballots never reaching voters or being returned to the clerks’ offices.50 \n  Assuming an absentee ballot safely made its way to the requesting voter ahead of the \nelection, there was no guarantee the ballot would be received and counted.  Wisconsin law \nrequires the rejection of absentee ballots that do not arrive at the polling place by 8 p.m. on \nelection day.  Wis. Stat § 6.87(6).  Under the Supreme Court’s order, “a voter’s absentee ballot \n[had to] be either (i) postmarked by election day, April 7, 2020, and received by April 13, 2020, \nat 4:00 p.m., or (ii) hand-delivered as provided under state law by April 7, 2020, at 8:00 p.m.”  \nRNC, 140 S. Ct. at 1207. \n  For many voters at high risk from COVID-19, including Plaintiffs Jill Swenson and \nNelson, hand-delivering a ballot to the municipal clerk was not an option—social distance was \nimperative to preserve their health and safety.51  While Defendant Wolfe identified absentee-\nballot drop-boxes as a potential solution—in which voters could return ballots while maintaining \n                                                 \n46 SOPF ¶¶ 53-54.  \n47 SOPF ¶ 55. \n48 SOPF ¶ 56.    \n49 SOPF ¶ 57.   \n50 SOPF ¶ 58. \n51 SOPF ¶ 62.  \n10 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 22 of 79\n \nsocial distancing—the idea was not uniformly required or implemented.52  Similarly, drive-\nthrough and curbside voting was not widely administered.53  Even ordinary in-person absentee \nvoting was restricted.  In Green Bay, for example, in-person absentee voting was confined to a \nsingle site that was open for only ten weekdays with sporadic hours.54  In Milwaukee, the city \nbriefly had just three in-person early absentee voting sites; then had no early absentee voting \nsites for nearly a full week; and finally opened a single drive-through absentee voting location at \nthe municipal building, which was inconvenient for voters in other parts of the city—especially \nthose without access to a car.55 \n  Another option for returning an absentee ballot was mailing it to the clerk’s office.  By \nDefendants’ own analysis, authorizing the acceptance of ballots postmarked by election day (and \nreceived by 4 P.M. on April 13), rather than received by election day, resulted in 79,054 ballots \nbeing counted that would have otherwise been rejected.56  But Defendants failed to promulgate \nrules or issue guidance with respect to postmarks to ensure the uniform and fair treatment of \nballots received by mail.57  Clerks received ballots bearing no postmarks, two postmarks, or \npostmarks that did not clearly indicate a date.58  As a result, some jurisdictions counted ballots \nwithout a postmark, while others rejected such ballots.59  Ultimately, more than 120,000 people \nwho requested absentee ballots did not return them as of election day; a significant proportion of \n                                                 \n52 SOPF ¶ 63. \n53 SOPF ¶ 64. \n54 SOPF ¶ 65.  \n55 SOPF ¶ 66. \n56 SOPF ¶ 67.   \n57 SOPF ¶ 68. \n58 SOPF ¶ 69. \n59 SOPF ¶ 70.   \n11 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 23 of 79\n \nthose voters were stymied by the many errors and obstacles to absentee voting that Defendants \nfailed to prevent.60 \n  Defendants’ enforcement of Wis. Stat. § 6.87(2), the witness requirement for absentee \nballots, also disenfranchised voters.  Under Wisconsin law, absentee ballots must be witnessed \nand signed by another adult citizen who is not a candidate on the ballot.  Wis. Stat. § 6.87(2), (4).  \nBut for high-risk voters, including Plaintiff Swenson, satisfying this requirement meant coming \ninto contact with others and putting their lives in danger.61  This Court has already recognized \nthis danger.  See DNC, 2020 WL 1638374, at *2 (enjoining “the enforcement of Wis. Stat. \n§ 6.87(2) as to absentee voters who have provided a written affirmation or other statement that \nthey were unable to safely obtain a witness certification despite reasonable efforts to do so”).  \nAfter the Seventh Circuit stayed enforcement of this aspect of this Court’s injunction, Wis. Stat. \n§ 6.87(2) deprived voters unable to secure a witness, including Plaintiff Swenson, of the ability \nto cast an effective absentee ballot.62 \n  Voters with disabilities were especially burdened given the lack of effective options to \nvote absentee.  Because many of these voters felt unsafe voting in person, being unable to vote \nabsentee meant that they were unable to vote at all.63  And voters who are blind or otherwise \n                                                 \n60 SOPF ¶ 74. \n61 SOPF ¶ 76.

Insufficient Poll Workers Led To A Significant Reduction In Poll \nLocations. \n  Nearly a month before the April 7 election, Defendants began to suspect that poll worker \nshortages would reduce voting access.66  According to a survey conducted by Defendants, one \nweek before the election 111 voting jurisdictions believed they would not have enough workers \nto open even one polling place on election day, and 126 additional jurisdictions thought they \nwould not have enough workers to open “all desired polling places.”67  In a memorandum issued \nto clerks across Wisconsin on March 13, 2020, Defendants, aware of the impending shortages, \nstated that municipalities had attempted to recruit extra poll workers, and that the Commission \nwas trying to assign state and county employees to serve as reserve poll workers.68   \nWisconsin law made it unlikely that municipal and county clerks could solve their poll \nworker problems on their own:  Wisconsin statutes mandate that each election official, including \neach poll worker, be “a qualified elector of a county in which the municipality where the official \nserves is located,” Wis. Stat. § 7.30(2). 69  As a consequence, jurisdictions hit the hardest by poll \nworker reductions were unable to recruit replacement poll workers from other parts of the state.  \n                                                 \n64 SOPF ¶ 97. \n65 SOPF ¶ 96. \n66 SOPF ¶ 98. \n67 SOPF ¶ 99. \n68 SOPF ¶ 100.  \n69 SOPF ¶ 101. \n13 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 25 of 79\n \nAnd while Defendants suggested that counties could serve as a clearinghouse for available \nelection inspectors, they made no efforts to facilitate or coordinate intra-county poll worker \nsharing.70   \n  Without a statewide system to address poll worker shortages, some jurisdictions were \nforced to close a staggering number of polling places, while others were largely unaffected.  \nMilwaukee, which is home to 69.4% of Wisconsin’s Black population,71 was able to open only \nfive of its usual 180 polling sites.72  As a result, voters, including Plaintiff McCurtis, were forced \nto endure wait times of up to two-and-a-half hours to cast an in-person ballot.73  Milwaukee \nElection Commission executive director Neil Albrecht told reporters that he learned through \nmedia reports that National Guard members could be used at polling sites—a request he had \nmade in the lead up to the election, but was denied at the time.74  Had Albrecht known about the \nNational Guard’s availability earlier, Milwaukee could have opened additional voting centers.75  \nIn Green Bay, the city’s 31 polling sites were reduced to just two high school gymnasiums.76  \nVoters faced wait times of up to four hours.77  Waukesha, a city of 70,000, was only able to open \none of its polling places.78   \n                                                 \n70 SOPF ¶ 102. \n71 SOPF ¶ 103. \n72 SOPF ¶ 104. \n73 SOPF ¶ 105. \n74 SOPF ¶ 106. \n75 SOPF ¶ 107. \n76 SOPF ¶ 108. \n77 SOPF ¶ 109. \n78 SOPF ¶ 110. \n14 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 26 of 79\n \n  Meanwhile, some municipalities were able to mitigate the damage.  Madison, for \nexample, was able to open 66 of its usual 92 polling sites.79  Madison City Clerk Maribeth \nWitzel-Behl credited the city’s commitment to staffing polling locations, noting that the \nEmergency Operations Center and Planning staff pushed to fill shifts.80  Generally, smaller \ntowns and suburban areas were less affected by the pandemic, more fully staffed, and had shorter \nwait times.81  Even some cities in Milwaukee County, such as Wauwatosa and Whitefish Bay, \nreported empty polling places with short wait times.82   \n4.  Defendants Failed To Ensure The Polling Places That Remained Open \nWere Safe. \n  Not only did Defendants fail to ensure an adequate number of polling places, they failed \nto ensure voters’ safety at polling locations that remained open.  As Defendants acknowledged in \na memorandum summarizing the April 7 election, they knew “in early March that local election \nofficials were unable to procure supplies needed for in-person voting.”83  Indeed, Defendants \nthemselves experienced trouble procuring necessary supplies.84  Yet, although some of those \nsupplies—such as PPE, masks and gloves, and equipment to sanitize voting machines—were \nultimately delivered, Defendants took no action to require voters or poll workers to employ those \nsupplies or take other precautions to maintain safety at polling places.85  \n                                                 \n79 SOPF ¶ 111. \n80 SOPF ¶ 112. \n81 SOPF ¶ 113. \n82 SOPF ¶ 114. \n83 SOPF ¶ 115. \n84 SOPF ¶ 116. \n85 SOPF ¶ 117. \n15 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 27 of 79\n \n  In Milwaukee, for example, voters were crowded together indoors for much of the hours-\nlong wait to vote, such that social distancing was impossible to maintain.86  Plaintiff McCurtis, \nwho was forced to vote in person at Washington High School in Milwaukee, noted that officials \nmade no attempt to enforce social distancing and did not provide PPE to voters.87  When she \nfinally made it to the front of the line, no sanitized pens were made available for voters to use.88  \nVoters in other cities experienced a similar lack of safety protocols.  In Green Bay, voters were \nnot directed to use sanitization supplies (although poll workers did).89  In Oshkosh, poll workers \nwore masks, but not properly, and reused paper towels to clean voter booths between voters.90  \nAnd in Beloit, many poll workers were not wearing any PPE at all.91  \n  These outcomes were preventable through the exercise of reasonable efforts.  Indeed, in \nthe absence of any guidance from Defendants, some cities took it upon themselves to ensure safe \nin-person voting on election day.  In Madison, city workers erected Plexiglas barriers to protect \npoll workers.92  The Mayor of Neenah, Dean Kaufert, similarly had Plexiglas screens erected.93  \nMayor Kaufert also advocated use of Q-tips and aluminum foil to make reusable touchscreen \nstyluses to reduce the risk of touching potentially contaminated poll books.94  The city of \nFitchburg sent out detailed notes explaining how poll workers and voters would be kept safe:  \n                                                 \n86 SOPF ¶ 118. \n87 SOPF ¶ 120. \n88 SOPF ¶ 121. \n89 SOPF ¶ 122. \n90 SOPF ¶ 123. \n91 SOPF ¶ 124. \n92 SOPF ¶ 126. \n93 SOPF ¶ 127. \n94 SOPF ¶ 128. \n16 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 28 of 79\n \nequipment was to be wiped down every 15 minutes, lines were to be taped off to encourage \nsocial distancing, and all poll workers were to be given masks and gloves.95 \n5.  Defendants’ Failures Arbitrarily Impacted Certain Voters And \nMunicipalities More Than Others. \n  Defendants’ failures, and the ensuing electoral breakdown, had an arbitrary and disparate \nimpact on certain voters and jurisdictions.  Dr. Anthony Fowler—an Associate Professor at the \nHarris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, whose research applies econometric \nmethods to questions in political science, including elections and political representation—\nanalyzed voter turnout data to determine whether and to what extent Wisconsin voters were \ndeterred from voting by COVID-19 in the April 2020 election.  Dr. Fowler found that the effects \nof COVID-19 on the April 2020 election “systematically harmed” those who had not previously \nvoted absentee, those in urban areas, and those in economically depressed communities.96   \n  In Milwaukee County, the county with the highest COVID-19 prevalence in the state at \nthe time of the election, turnout was at least 4.3 percentage points lower than expected when \ncontrolling for prior voter histories.97  This is a lower-bound estimate based on the assumption \nthat there was no deterrent effect in counties with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence, and thus \nlikely understates the true impact on turnout.98  Turnout was particularly low not just in \nMilwaukee County, but also in other urban zip codes where people regularly rely on public \ntransportation, in economically depressed zip codes with higher rates of unemployment, and in \nzip codes with greater shares of residents without health insurance.99  \n                                                 \n95 SOPF ¶ 129. \n96 SOPF ¶ 130; Report of Anthony Fowler, Ph.D. (“Fowler Report”), at 20. \n97 SOPF ¶ 133; Fowler Report at 9. \n98 SOPF ¶ 134; Fowler Report at 9. \n99 SOPF ¶ 135; Fowler Report at 17. \n17 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 29 of 79\n \n  As one might expect, the pandemic especially affected in-person voting.100  In the \ncounties with high prevalence of COVID-19, in-person voting decreased by 7.4 percentage \npoints, when compared to the counties with low prevalence.101  So, for example, in Milwaukee \nCounty, where there were nearly 490,000 voters in Dr. Fowler’s sample, approximately 36,000 \nwere deterred from voting in person.102  While COVID-19 may have increased absentee voting, \nthis effect was not nearly large enough to make up for the decrease in voting at the polls.103   \n  The pandemic also resulted in significantly lower than expected turnout for those who \nhad not cast a ballot by mail in previous statewide elections.  Voters across the state who had not \npreviously navigated the absentee ballot process—68 percent of the registered voters in Dr. \nFowler’s sample—were 7.5 percent less likely to vote in the April 2020 election than other \nregistered voters.  Applying this estimate to the number of registered voters who had never \nbefore voted absentee, Dr. Fowler estimated that approximately 166,000 people across the state \nwho had not previously voted by mail were deterred from voting in April 2020.104  This effect \nvaried from counties with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence to the highest COVID-19 \nprevalence.  In higher-prevalence counties like Milwaukee County, as many as 9.2 percent of \nvoters who had never voted by mail—at least 30,000 people—were deterred from voting.105   \n  Electoral failures in April also disproportionally affected older voters and minority \ncommunities.  Individuals over the age of 65—a demographic usually overrepresented at the \npolls—were 6.2 percentage points less likely to vote in the April 2020 election compared to other \n                                                 \n100 SOPF ¶ 136; Fowler Report at 10-11. \n101 SOPF ¶ 137; Fowler Report at 11. \n102 SOPF ¶ 138; Fowler Report at 11. \n103 SOPF ¶ 139; Fowler Report at 10. \n104 SOPF ¶ 140; Fowler Report at 11-12. \n105 SOPF ¶ 142; Fowler Report at 12. \n18 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 30 of 79\n \nvoters in the same counties with the same voting histories, whether or not they lived in a county \nwith high COVID-19 prevalence.106   \nTurnout was also lower than expected for Black and Hispanic communities, relative to \nother communities.  Based on the available data, compared to zip codes that are entirely non-\nminority, turnout in hypothetical zip codes consisting entirely of Black or Hispanic residence \nwas 14.8 and 16.6 percentage points lower, respectively, than would be expected for other voters \nin the county with the same prior voting history.107  Applying these results to actual zip codes, \nDr. Fowler found, for example, that the zip code 53204, which consists of 70 percent Hispanic \nresidents and 11 percent Black residents, had a turnout 13 percentage points lower than expected \ncompared to a zip code with no Hispanic or Black residents but identical voting history.108  \nSimilarly, Dr. Fowler found that turnout was 14 percent lower than expected in zip code 53206, \nwhich has 94 percent Black residents and 2 percent Hispanic residents.109  In all, Dr. Fowler \nidentified 14 zip codes where minority turnout dropped by more than 5 percentage points \ncompared to similarly situated voters with identical voting history.110 \n                                                 \n106 SOPF ¶ 143; Fowler Report at 13-14. \n107 SOPF ¶ 145; Fowler Report at 14. \n108 SOPF ¶ 146; Fowler Report at 14-15. \n109 SOPF ¶ 147; Fowler Report at 15. \n110 SOPF ¶ 148; Fowler Report at 15. \n19 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 31 of 79\n \nIII.  ABSENT JUDICIAL INTERVENTION, DEFENDANTS’ FAILURES ARE \nPRACTICALLY CERTAIN TO RECUR IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION. \nA.  COVID-19 Will Pose A Substantial Health Risk To Voters For The \nRemainder Of 2020. \n1.  COVID-19 Continues To Spread Throughout Wisconsin And Will Still Be \nA Major Public Health Concern During The Remaining Months Of 2020. \nSince Wisconsin’s first COVID-19 case on February 5, 2020, the number of cases has \nconsistently increased, with more than 23,000 Wisconsinites testing positive for the disease.111   \nImportantly, the state continues to experience “community spread,” meaning that there are too \nmany COVID-19 cases to trace and isolate infections.112 \nAccording to a comprehensive model developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and \nEvaluation (IMHE) at the University of Washington, “the evolution of the epidemic depends on \nthe balance between relaxed social distancing, increasing temperature, and rising rates of testing \nand contact tracing.”113  Because many states have begun to reopen, IMHE Director Dr. \nChristopher Murray “expects that the epidemic in many states will now extend through the \nsummer.”114  Indeed, in the week ending June 20, 10 states saw all-time highs in their seven-day \naverage number of new positive COVID-19 cases.115  Wisconsin is not immune from the \npotential increase in caseload that accompanies reopening.  Social distancing metrics (e.g., data \nfrom cell phones) indicate that social distancing in Wisconsin decreased from April to May.116  \nAnd given that the “Safer at Home” Order was in effect during the April election, but was later \n                                                 \n111 SOPF ¶ 214. \n112 SOPF ¶ 215; Remington Report at 6. \n113 SOPF ¶ 216; Remington Report at 10. \n114 SOPF ¶ 217; Remington Report at 10. \n115 SOPF ¶ 218. \n116 SOPF ¶ 219; Remington Report at 7. \n20 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 32 of 79\n \noverturned by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, social distancing rates are likely to keep \ndropping.117   \nFurther, even assuming that “warming seasonal temperatures…could help slow \ntransmission” during the summer (which is far from clear), the November Election will occur in \nthe fall, when decreasing temperatures may very well trigger a second wave of COVID-19.118  \nIndeed, experts including Dr. Anthony Fauci have warned of a “bad fall and a bad winter” that \nmay result in the increased spread of COVID-19.119 \nBased on the epidemiology of COVID-19 transmission in Wisconsin, there will \naccordingly be a significant risk of contracting and transmitting COVID-19 during the November \n2020 election in Wisconsin.120 \n2.  The Harms Caused By COVID-19 In The November Election Are Likely \nTo Be Greater, Not Less, Than In The April Election. \nAs noted above, the spread of COVID-19 is likely to continue throughout the summer \nand into the fall.  The result:  absent judicial intervention mandating significant changes, voters \nwill face substantial health risks in their efforts to exercise their right to vote.  Indeed, given the \nincreased participation rate in the November general election relative to the April primary \nelection, the risk of COVID-19 spread will increase unless appropriate measures are taken.  In \nrecent presidential elections, 200-300% more people have participated in the November general \nelection than in the April primaries.121  Given the confined nature of many polling places, the \nneed for additional space to accommodate additional voters in November, and the continued \n                                                 \n117 SOPF ¶ 220; Remington Report at 7. \n118 SOPF ¶ 222-23; Remington Report at 10. \n119 SOPF ¶ 223. \n120 SOPF ¶ 225; Remington Report at 8-11. \n121 SOPF ¶ 228; Remington Report at 4. \n21 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 33 of 79\n \nmandate that all absentee voters abide by the witnessing requirement, transmission risk in \nNovember will thus grow exponentially absent significant changes.122   \nIncreased voter demand for absentee ballots and online registration will also continue to \nstrain the MyVote platform, likely resulting in outages comparable to or greater than those faced \nin April.123  The demand for more than double the number of absentee ballots will also make it \nmore likely that voters either fail to receive their ballots or that those ballots themselves fail to \nmake it back to their polling locations in time.124  In short, the problems in November are likely \nto be the same problems faced in April, only worse.125 \nB.  Defendants Have Not Adopted Adequate Measures To Ensure That The \nFailures Of The April 7 Election Do Not Recur. \n  In the months following the April 7 election, Defendants have shown that they are either \nunwilling or unable to ensure all Wisconsinites have a safe, practical means to vote.  To be sure, \nthey have urged Wisconsinites to vote absentee,126 and they now intend to mail absentee ballot \napplications to nearly all registered voters who have not already requested one.127  They have \nissued “recommendations” in varying degrees of specificity.128  And they have reported data on \nthousands of disenfranchised voters.129  But they have not taken the necessary concrete actions to \n                                                 \n122 SOPF ¶ 229; Remington Report at 9, 13. \n123 SOPF ¶ 230; Kennedy Report ¶¶ 44, 47-48. \n124 SOPF ¶ 231; Kennedy Report ¶¶ 104-106, 110, 125. \n125 SOPF ¶ 238. \n126 SOPF ¶ 239. \n127 SOPF ¶ 243. \n128 SOPF ¶ 240. \n129 SOPF ¶ 242. \n22 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 34 of 79\n \nsolve the vast majority of the myriad problems they and Plaintiffs have identified, and that \nWisconsin voters experienced in April.130   \n  Time grows short.  Much of the relief sought by Plaintiffs must be granted soon to \nimprove safety and voting access in the upcoming November election.131  Estimates suggest that \nmore than 1.8 million Wisconsin voters will request an absentee ballot for the November \nelection.132  Action must be taken now to prepare Wisconsin’s poll workers and clerks for this \nmassive surge.  Relief on the eve of the election will be too late.133 \n  Moreover, Defendants cannot implement certain elements of the requested relief without \njudicial intervention.  Wisconsin statutes prevent Defendants from making some of the necessary \nchanges to policies and practices.  These include the requirement that each election official be an \nelector of the county in which the municipality is located (Wis. Stat. § 7.30(2)); that voters \nsecure an in-person witness (Wis. Stat. § 6.87(2)); that absentee ballots must be delivered to the \npolling place no later than 8 p.m. on election day (Wis. Stat § 6.87(6)); that absentee ballots not \nbe counted before election day (Wis. Stat. §§ 6.88, 7.51-.52); and that locations for in-person \nabsentee voting must have been determined already, by June 11, 2020 (Wis. Stat. § 6.855(1)).134  \nAbsent judicial intervention, Defendants will be powerless to make necessary adjustments that \nrun afoul of these statutory mandates. \n                                                 \n130 SOPF ¶ 244; Kennedy Report ¶¶ 24-34.  \n131 Kennedy Report ¶ 37.  \n132 SOPF ¶ 246. \n133 See, e.g., Purcell v.

Practices that were \nonce routine are now questionable at best, and dangerous at worst.135  Dr. Patrick Remington, a \nveteran epidemiologist and the Director of the Preventative Medicine Residence Program and \nProfessor Emeritus in the University of Wisconsin-Madison, recommends a series of public \nhealth-oriented measures that would protect the safety and wellbeing of both poll workers and \nelectors alike.136  Kevin J. Kennedy, a seasoned election administration official who served as \nWisconsin’s Chief Election Officer for more than 33 years, likewise offers practicable and \nsimple solutions to the problems posed by COVID-19 that draw on his nearly four decades of \nexperience administering Wisconsin’s elections.137  Defendants must implement these measures \nto ensure the safety of all Wisconsinites and to protect access to the ballot in Wisconsin.138  And \nthis Court should enjoin statutory requirements that prevent the free and fair exercise of the right \nto vote in Wisconsin. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n  To prevail on a motion for a preliminary injunction, a party must show that it has (1) \n“some likelihood of success on the merits” and (2) “no adequate remedy at law and will suffer \nirreparable harm if a preliminary injunction is denied.”  Am.

PLAINTIFFS ARE LIKELY TO PREVAIL ON THE MERITS OF THEIR \nSTATUTORY CLAIMS.  \nPlaintiffs bring claims for relief on both statutory and constitutional bases.  Specifically, \nPlaintiffs assert violations of Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act and the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, as well as the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The merits of Plaintiffs’ \nstatutory claims are addressed first, in Section I, and the merits of Plaintiffs’ constitutional \nclaims are addressed in Section II.  See Ameritech Corp. v. McCann, 403 F.3d 908, 911 (7th Cir. \n2005) (“We shall tackle the issues in the right order, starting with the statute and moving to \nthe Constitution only to the extent necessary in light of the statutory decision.”). \nA.  Plaintiffs Are Likely To Prevail On Their Claim That Defendants’ Failure \nTo Ensure Safe Voting Conditions Violates Section 11(b) Of The Voting \nRights Act (Count 1). \nSection 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act makes it unlawful for any person to “intimidate, \nthreaten, or coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any person for voting or \nattempting to vote.”  52 U.S.C. § 10307(b) (formerly 42 U.S.C. § 1973i(b)).  As explained \nbelow, the statute’s reach includes governmental action that puts a voter in harm’s way, even \nwhen the government does not directly inflict the harm or intend the harm to be inflicted.  \nDefendants administer an election system that, under current conditions, does exactly that: it \nexposes voters to unnecessarily elevated risk of harm by failing to ensure safe opportunities for \n25 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 37 of 79\n \nin person voting and simultaneously failing to provide adequate absentee voting procedures to \naccommodate all voters who might avail themselves to that option.  By running an election \nsystem whose multiple deficiencies deprive voters of a safe way to participate in future elections, \nDefendants violate Section 11(b).   \nSection 11(b) sweeps broadly to prohibit any actions that have the effect of intimidating \nvoters, regardless whether the defendant intended the intimidation.  Congress modeled Section \n11(b) on Section 131(b) of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, 52 U.S.C. § 10101(b) (formerly 42 \nU.S.C. § 1971(b)), copying Section 131(b) verbatim in almost every respect, save one.  Section \n131(b) imposes a distinct mens rea element, proscribing intimidation “for the purpose of” \ninterfering with voting.  That statutory language is absent from Section 11(b):  “The text of \n§ 11(b), unlike § 131(b), plainly omits ‘for the purpose of,’ suggesting § 11(b)’s deliberately \nunqualified reach.”  LULAC Richmond Regional Council v. Pub. Interest Legal Found., 2018 \nWL 3848404, at *4 (E.D Va. Aug. 13, 2018); see also Ben Cady & Tom Glazer, Voters Strike \nBack: Litigating Against Modern Voter Intimidation, 39 N.Y.U. Rev. L. & Soc. Change 173, 204 \n(2015) (“Section 11(b) does not require a plaintiff to make any showing with regard to the \ndefendant’s intent.”).139   \nReading Section 11(b) next to Section 131(b) is important, because the operative \nlanguage of Section 11(b) is otherwise indistinguishable from Section 131(b), and quite broad—\nprohibiting voter intimidation in all its forms.  No act of violence, or any physical intimidation, is \nrequired.  See New York v. Horelick, 424 F.2d 697, 700 (2d Cir. 1970) (Friendly, J.) (contrasting \n                                                 \n139 The legislative history confirms that “no subjective purpose or intent need be shown.”  H.R. \nRep No. 89-439, at 30-31 (1965) (“no subjective purpose or intent need be shown”); see also \nVoting Rights, Part 1: Hearings on S. 1564 Before the S.

Conducting an election in a manner that causes potential voters to fear that \nparticipation will jeopardize their safety is sufficient to violate the statute.  Critically, Section \n131(b) has long been interpreted to prohibit a jurisdiction from taking actions that have the effect \nof exposing voters to unsafe or intimidating conditions.  For instance, a sheriff cannot look the \nother way while private parties intimidate voters:  “The law is clear that a [jurisdiction] cannot \neffectively abdicate its responsibilities by either ignoring them or by merely failing to discharge \nthem whatever the motive may be.”  United States v. Clark, 249 F. Supp. 720, 729 (S.D. Ala. \n1965); see Katzenbach v. Original Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, 250 F. Supp. 330, 341 (E.D. La. \n1965).140  Indeed, the Department of Justice has pursued consent decrees reflecting this \nunderstanding of the statute.141  Given Congress’s intent to incorporate Section 131(b)’s \ndefinition of intimidation into Section 11(b)—a conclusion buttressed by the statutory text and \nlegislative history—Section 11(b)’s prohibition on unlawful voter intimidation must likewise \n                                                 \n140 In Katzenbach, the court discussed an earlier set of orders in Hicks v. Knight, Civ. No.15,727 \n(E.D. La.), 10 Race Rel. L. Rep. 1504, 1507-09 (1965), where the district court found that a city \nfailed to take reasonable measures to protect the Bogalusa Voters’ League from violence.  The \ndistrict court not only enjoined the city from failing to protect plaintiffs in exercising their civil \nrights but went on to order the chief of police to publish a plan to rectify the failure to protect, \nincluding a chain of command and system for responsibility, written instructions for police \nofficers to provide adequate protection, and a requirement that officials certify that they were \nadhering to the court’s orders.  See Hicks, 10 Race Rel. L. Rep. at 1507-08; see generally \nKatzenbach, 250 F. Supp. at 342 (citing Hicks v. Knight, noting that the police had “fail[ed] to \nuse all reasonable means to protect” citizens from assault, harassment, and intimidation when \nexercising their civil rights, and observing that such conduct constitutes unlawful intimidation). \n141 See Hearing on the U.S. Commissioner System Before the Subcomm. on Improvements in \nJudicial Machinery of the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 189th Cong. 138-39 (1965) (available at \nhttps://bit.ly/2UZGsj6) (describing DOJ consent judgment in United States v. Mathews that \nenjoined defendants “from refusing reasonable police protection to any person in need thereof” \nwhen exercising the right to vote or encouraging others to exercise the right to vote).   \n27 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 39 of 79\n \nprohibit government officials from conducting elections without mitigating threats to voters’ \nsafety at polling places.142   \nDefendants’ failure to provide safe in-person voting during the COVID-19 pandemic \nposes a manifest threat to voters.  See supra at 13-24.  Take the April 7 election.  Some voters, \nlike Plaintiff McCurtis, faced conditions that would cause any reasonable person to fear for her \nsafety—large numbers of people (caused by consolidation of polling places), inadequate social \ndistancing, and insufficient personal protective equipment.  Those conditions posed a threat of \ninfection to McCurtis, who lives with her immunocompromised mother, causing McCurtis to \nfear that she would infect and seriously harm her own mother.143  Voters at high risk from \nCOVID-19, like Plaintiffs Swenson and Nelson, were so intimidated and threatened by this \nvoting environment that they reasonably concluded that their only safe option to exercise the \nfranchise was to vote absentee.144  Yet Defendants’ failures to ensure effective absentee voting \noptions meant that those voters were disenfranchised by the combination of unsafe in-person \nvoting options and ineffective absentee voting procedures.145  Defendants’ failure to ensure safe \nvoting conditions disenfranchised voters on a wide scale.  Thousands of voters were deterred \nfrom or otherwise prevented from voting, with the voters who live in hardest hit parts of the state \n                                                 \n142 Importantly, Section 11(b) is not limited in its application to government officials. See \nLULAC v. Pub. Interest Legal Found., 2018 WL 3848404, at *3 (holding that “the statutory text \nis dispositive” in showing “Congressional intent to reach both government and private conduct \nunder § 11(b)”).  For that reason, it may very well apply in situations where a private party fails \nto protect voters from an external threat.  But existing case law makes absolutely clear that \ngovernment officials may not stand by when the decision to vote puts a person in peril; failure to \nprotect voters in those circumstances violates § 11(b). \n143 SOPF ¶¶ 161-71.  That Plaintiff McCurtis in fact voted makes no difference—voter \nintimidation remains actionable under federal law even when individual voters persist in casting \ntheir ballots.  See, e.g., United States v. McLeod, 385 F. 2d 734, 741 (5th Cir. 1967). \n144 SOPF ¶¶ 161, 166, 174-75. \n145 SOPF ¶¶ 164-71, 175-78. \n28 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 40 of 79\n \nexperiencing the highest rates of disenfranchisement.146  See supra at 17-19.  In Milwaukee \nCounty alone, about 36,000 voters were deterred from voting at the polls by the unsafe \nconditions.147 \nAbsent judicial intervention, Defendants will conduct the November election in a manner \nthat again violates Section 11(b) by exposing voters to an unsafe and threatening environment \nduring the pandemic.  The best available epidemiological evidence shows that administering \nordinary in-person voting processes this fall would imperil most voters, a burden that will fall \nespecially hard on immunocompromised individuals.148  And yet Defendants have still not taken \n“[s]ufficient measures to ensure that the significant failures of the April 7 election are not \nrepeated in November.”149  Supra at 22-24.   \nThe dangers posed by voting during COVID-19, however, are not inevitable.  As a \npractical matter, the dangers voters will face in the November election will depend on how \nDefendants administer the elections:  whether they take necessary measures to ensure voters’ \nsafety, or whether they enforce statutes that, applied in the current pandemic, place voters at risk.  \nCrucially, the level of risk voters face during the pandemic is not fixed or merely a matter of \nforces beyond Defendants’ control.  Defendants continue to administer an election system whose \ninterlocking elements increase the risk of voting.  The combined effects of Defendants’ failure to \nprovide safe and reliable opportunities to register before election day; their failure to ensure safe \nopportunities to vote in person; and their failure to ensure adequate absentee voting procedures to \naccommodate voters who choose not to vote in person cumulatively intimidate Plaintiffs and \n                                                 \n146 See, e.g., Fowler Report at 8-20. \n147 Fowler Report at 11. \n148 See, e.g., Remington Report at 5-6, 8-11, 13. \n149 Kennedy Report ¶ 32; see also id. ¶¶ 31, 33-34. \n29 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 41 of 79\n \nother voters by depriving them of safe opportunities to vote.150  This Court can provide specific \nrelief that would ensure voters enjoy substantially safer conditions when voting in November.151 \nOf course, Defendants are not responsible for causing COVID-19, and Plaintiffs do not \nask this Court to superintend the state’s general public health policy.  But Defendants are liable \nunder federal law for administering an election in a manner that threatens or intimidates voters.  \nIn the upcoming November election, that means Defendants must administer Wisconsin’s \nelection laws and procedures consistent with the demands of public health during a pandemic.  It \nis possible to administer the elections consistent with those demands.152  Refusing to do so, in \nviolation of Section 11(b), forces each voter to make the Hobson’s choice between safety and the \nright to vote.  The Voting Rights Act provides a judicial remedy when election officials \nadminister an election that threatens to exact such a cost.  \nB.  Plaintiffs Are Likely To Prevail On Their Claim That Defendants’ Failure \nTo Make Reasonable Modifications For Voters With Disabilities Violates \nThe Americans With Disabilities Act (Count 5). \nTitle II of the ADA addresses state and local government programs, including the \nadministration of elections.  Title II’s “primary mandate” is that “‘no qualified individual with a \ndisability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the \nbenefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination by any such entity.’”  Lacy v. Cook Cty., 897 F.3d 847, 852 (7th Cir. 2018) \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12132).  “Voting is a quintessential public activity.”  Nat’l Fed’n of the \nBlind v.

If the plaintiff makes \nout a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the modification “would \nfundamentally alter the nature of the service.”  28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(7)(i), 35.164; see, e.g., \nLamone, 813 F.3d at 508.   \n1.  Plaintiffs Are Qualified Individuals With Disabilities And An Organization \nThat Represents Them. \nAs relevant here, the term disability means “a physical or mental impairment that \nsubstantially limits one or more major life activities.”  42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A).  Plaintiffs \nSwenson and Nelson fall within that definition.  Plaintiff Swenson suffers from chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), “an inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed \nairflow from the lungs.”154  Ms. Swenson’s COPD substantially limits her ability to breathe and \nher respiratory function, which means, during the COVID-19 pandemic, that she is unable to \n                                                 \n153 U.S. Dep’t of Justice, “The Americans with Disabilities Act and Other Federal Laws Protecting \nthe Rights of Voters with Disabilities,” available at https://www.justice.gov/file/69411/download. \n154 SOPF ¶ 150. \n31 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 43 of 79\n \nsafely leave her home.155  42 U.S.C. § 12102(2).

Plaintiffs Have Been Denied Access To A Government Program, And \nDefendants Cannot Prove That The Proposed Modifications Are \nUnreasonable. \n “[U]nder the ADA, a public entity must reasonably accommodate a qualified individual \nwith a disability by making changes in rules, policies, practices, or services when needed.”  \nOconomowoc Residential Programs v. City of Milwaukee, 300 F.3d 775, 782-83 (7th Cir. 2002); \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) (requiring reasonable modifications in the context of Title II).  Of \ncourse, the proposed modification must be reasonable, but the burden of proving reasonableness \nin this context “is not a heavy one.”  Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 280 (2d Cir. \n2003); see Lamone, 813 F.3d at 507-08.  The plaintiff need only show that the modification is \n“reasonable on its face,” Oconomowoc, 300 F.3d at 783, and then the burden shifts to the \ndefendant to demonstrate unreasonableness or prove that it “would ‘fundamentally alter’ the \nprogram,” Lamone, 813 F.3d at 508 (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7)(i)). \na.  The witness requirement.

The Court should waive the in-person witness \nrequirement for this limited class of voters who are unable to secure a witness safely, replacing it \nwith a self-verification on penalty of perjury.

That rationale is inapposite to \nthe ADA analysis; while the Anderson-Burdick analysis involves a balancing test, the ADA does \nnot.  There is no state interest sufficient to justify discrimination against voters with disabilities \nwhere, as here, a reasonable modification is available.  See, e.g., Dees v. Austin Travis Cty. \nMental Health & Mental Retardation, 860 F. Supp. 1186, 1191 (W.D. Tex. 1994) (“[T]he \nstandard Congress has determined that should be applied in assessing the reasonableness of the \nmodification under the ADA is not a balancing test of competing interests … but whether the \nmodification can be made without fundamental alteration or undue burden such that disabled \nindividuals will not be denied the equal opportunities enjoyed by others.”); cf. Eckles v. Consol. \nRail Corp., 94 F.3d 1041, 1050 n.15 (7th Cir. 1996) (noting the ADA “provide[s] statutory \nfactors to be considered in determining whether a particular accommodation would produce an \n‘undue hardship’”).  Moreover, Plaintiffs do not seek to “categorically eliminate[] the witness \nrequirement applicable to absentee ballot,” DNC II, Order at 3; Plaintiffs seek to enjoin § 6.87(2) \nonly with respect to voters who are immunocompromised or otherwise at high risk from COVID-\n19, or who are actively infected with COVID-19, who cannot safely secure an in-person witness.  \nThe effect of the Seventh Circuit’s ruling on the Anderson-Burdick analysis for the November \nelection is discussed below.  See infra at 44 n.182. \n34 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 46 of 79\n \nMaryland’s absentee voting program”); Disabled in Action, 752 F.3d at 199 (emphasizing the \nimportance of privacy and independence for voters with disabilities); Drenth v. Boockvar, 2020 \nWL 2745729, at *5 (M.D. Pa. May 27, 2020) (during COVID-19 pandemic, “Plaintiffs have also \nbeen denied the benefits of a public program—in this case the ability to vote privately and \nindependently without being physically present at a polling location—because of their disability \n[i.e., print disabilities].”); Cal. Council of the Blind v. Cty. of Alameda, 985 F. Supp. 2d 1229, \n1238 (N.D. Cal. 2013) (“[U]nder the terms of the ADA …, the covered entity must provide \nmeaningful access to private and independent voting.”); see also 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(3), \n(8).161 \nBut there are straightforward methods—methods that WEC currently does not employ—\nto allow voters with print disabilities to participate in absentee and mail-in voting without \ncompromising their privacy and independence.  In particular, current Wisconsin law allows for \nmilitary and overseas voters to receive a ballot electronically in compliance with the Uniformed \nand Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), 52 U.S.C. §§ 20301 et seq.162  As a \nfirst and simple step to accommodate voters with print disabilities, this option need only be \nextended and online ballots made accessible to voters who use screen reader and marking \ntechnologies.163  Voters with print disabilities could mark their ballots privately and \n                                                 \n161 Defendants are also required to “furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where \nnecessary to afford individuals with disabilities … an equal opportunity to participate in” the \ngovernment service.  28 C.F.R. § 35.160(b)(1).  These include “accessible electronic and \ninformation technology” such as the accessible absentee ballots Plaintiffs seek.  Id. § 35.104. \n162 Kennedy Report ¶¶ 90-94. \n163 In an ideal world, voters with print disabilities would be able to return their ballots \nelectronically, so they do not have to rely on others for assistance with the envelope and mailing.  \nBut in the short term, until online returns can be safeguarded from fraud, providing these voters \nwith private and independent access to absentee ballot marking at all is an important ADA-\nrequired remedy. \n35 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 47 of 79\n \nindependently, and then print and mail them to the appropriate clerk.  This is a reasonable \nmodification that Defendants are required to adopt under the ADA, particularly where in-person \nvoting—the only other way these individuals can vote privately and independently—has not \nbeen made safe.  See, e.g., Lamone, 813 F.3d at 506-10 (holding Maryland’s online ballot \nmarking tool was a reasonable modification that would allow individuals with print disabilities to \nparticipate equally in absentee voting).  Indeed, another federal court recently granted a \npreliminary injunction on this basis.  See Drenth, 2020 WL 2745729, at *6 (noting an extension \nof UOCAVA “offers the benefits of having been tested in Michigan’s May 5, 2020 primary and \nproviding a more user-friendly option for blind voters that is verifiably accessible” but declining \nto adopt a different remedy for the primary because the defendants could not implement that \nsolution in just 12 days).164 \nII.  PLAINTIFFS ARE LIKELY TO PREVAIL ON THE MERITS OF THEIR \nCONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS. \nA.  Plaintiffs Are Likely To Prevail On Their Claim That Defendants’ Election \nAdministration And Various Provisions of Wisconsin Election Law Unduly \nBurden Their Right To Vote Under Anderson-Burdick (Count 3). \n  The right to vote, as embodied in the First and Fourteenth Amendments, is fundamental, \nand any alleged infringement on that right “must be carefully and meticulously \nscrutinized.”  Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 562 (1964).  Under the balancing framework \narticulated in Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983) and Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428 \n(1992), a court must weigh “the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights \n                                                 \n164 To prove causation under Title II, the plaintiff must show that she was denied access to a \npublic service “by reason” of her disability.  See Washington v. Ind. High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, \nInc., 181 F.3d 840, 848-49 (7th Cir. 1999).  This is a relatively lax standard, requiring only “but \nfor” causation.  Id.  There is no question that, but for their disabilities, Plaintiffs would have had \nequal access to the franchise.  \n36 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 48 of 79\n \nprotected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate” against \n“the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule, \ntaking into consideration the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the \nplaintiff’s rights.”  Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434.  In other words, the court must (1) “determine the \nextent of the burden imposed by the challenged provision”; (2) “evaluate the interest that the \nstate offers to justify that burden”; and (3) “judge whether the interest justifies the \nburden.”  DNC, 2020 WL 1638374, at *11. \n  When voting rights are severely restricted, a law or practice “must be narrowly drawn to \nadvance a state interest of compelling importance.”  Id. (citation omitted).  But even less-severe \nburdens must “be justified by relevant and legitimate state interests sufficiently weighty to justify \nthe limitation.”  Id. (citations omitted).  “In passing judgment, the Court must not only determine \nthe legitimacy and strength of each of those interests; it also must consider the extent to which \nthose interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff’s rights.”  Lee v. Va. State Bd. of \nElections, 843 F.3d 592, 605 (4th Cir. 2016).  \n  Absent judicial intervention, several aspects of the upcoming elections are likely to \nimpose unconstitutional burdens on the right to vote.  As the April 7 election demonstrated, \nDefendants are likely to fail to ensure safe and accessible in-person voting, as well as adequate \nnumbers of in-person polling locations for both election day and early (in-person) absentee \nvoting.  Wisconsin’s statutory deadline for receipt of mail-in absentee ballots is again likely to \ndisenfranchise thousands of voters.  And Wisconsin’s absentee-ballot witnessing requirement is \nlikely to disenfranchise a discrete class of immunocompromised, high-risk, or infected \nindividuals unable to safely secure a witness.  Because each of these challenged practices and \n37 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 49 of 79\n \nlaws severely burdens the right to vote and is not narrowly tailored to a compelling state interest, \neach is unconstitutional.165  DNC, 2020 WL 1638374, at *17.   \n1.  Failure To Ensure Safe In-Person Voting.   \nDuring the April 7 election, many polling locations, including in parts of the state most \nacutely affected by COVID-19, lacked the social distancing protocols and safety equipment—\nsuch as PPE and sanitary voting machines—necessary to ensure safe voting.166  See supra at 15-\n17.  Voters were thus forced to risk their health in order to exercise their fundamental right to \nvote.167  Both Wisconsin and national public health officials expect the pandemic will continue \nand might well intensify between now and November.  See supra at 20-22.  Yet Defendants have \nfailed to take adequate and concrete steps to ensure that in-person absentee and election day \nvoting sites will be administered with appropriate safety precautions in the upcoming elections to \nadequately protect voters from the known health risks posed by COVID-19.168  \n                                                 \n165 Even if the Court were to deem one of these burdens significant but not severe, Defendants \ncannot articulate sufficiently weighty and legitimate state interests to justify the burdens \nimposed.  See infra at 38-46.  Moreover, the cumulative effect of these burdens is most certainly \nsevere.  See Burdick, 504 U.S. at 435-37 (weighing the cumulative effect that Hawaii’s ballot \naccess laws had on plaintiff’s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights); Tenn. State Conference \nof NAACP v. Hargett, 420 F. Supp. 3d 683, 710 (M.D. Tenn. 2019) (holding that “plaintiffs have \ndemonstrated that these aspects of [Tennessee’s Election Offenses] Act, functioning together, \ncreate a cumulative burden that is even more difficult to justify as a constitutional matter.”).  \n166 SOPF ¶¶ 120-25; Kennedy Report ¶¶ 24-29. \n167 SOPF ¶¶ 76-77, 227; Kennedy Report ¶¶ 24-29. \n168 The right to vote can be unjustifiably burdened under Anderson-Burdick through deficient \nelection administration, not only problematic statutory requirements.  See Democratic Exec. \nComm. of Fla. v. Lee, 915 F.3d 1312, 1319 (11th Cir. 2019) (Florida’s deficient implementation \nof signature-match scheme established undue burden under Anderson-Burdick); Common \nCause/New York v. Brehm, 2020 WL 122589, at *16 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 10, 2020) (New York’s \ndeficient administration of its inactive-voter scheme established undue burden under Anderson-\nBurdick).   \n38 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 50 of 79\n \n  Defendants cannot articulate an interest sufficiently compelling to justify that severe \nburden on the right to vote.  It is feasible and practicable to implement adequate safety protocols \nthat will significantly improve the opportunities for Wisconsin voters to access the ballot \nsafely.169  These include employee temperature and wellness checks; providing and requiring \nmasks or face coverings for employees and voters; installing cough and sneeze barriers between \nemployees and members of the public; designing each polling location to allow for appropriate \nsocial distancing throughout the voting process; selecting larger in-person voting venues; \nmandatory hand-washing for poll workers; and thorough and continuous sanitization practices.170 \n  Implementing such safety protocols, in accordance with medical and expert guidance, \nwould not trespass on the State’s interest in maintaining order in the election process—it would \nfacilitate that interest.  Nor would providing safe in-person voting in any way diminish the \nState’s interest in ensuring finality or certainty of elections, or preventing voter fraud.  The only \nconceivable countervailing interest Defendants could cite is administrative cost, but the cost of \nthese safety measures will be moderate,171—and the need to protect Wisconsin voters from life-\nthreatening health risks far outweighs the cost of implementing social distancing measures and \nsupplying PPE.  See Belitskus v. Pizzingrilli, 343 F.3d 632, 646-47 (3d Cir. 2003) (“defraying the \ncosts of elections” is not “of compelling importance”); United Utah Party v. Cox, 268 F. Supp. \n3d 1227, 1254-55 (D. Utah 2017) (“Courts have repeatedly rejected the argument that cost is a \nsufficient state interest in election cases.”).  Indeed, protecting the health and safety of its citizens \nis the State’s paramount interest.  Sinclair Ref. Co. v. City of Chicago, 178 F.2d 214, 216 (7th \nCir. 1949) (“The police power of the State is that power required to be exercised in order to \n                                                 \n169 Kennedy Report ¶¶ 35-41. \n170 Kennedy Report ¶¶ 39, 66; Remington Report at 14-17. \n171 Kennedy Report ¶¶ 38-39. \n39 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 51 of 79\n \neffectually discharge within the scope of the constitutional limitations its paramount obligation to \npromote and protect the public health, safety, morals, comfort and general welfare of the \npeople.”).  Moreover, the COVID-19 safety costs associated with in-person voting are the same \ncosts that will have to be assumed going forward to provide other in-person government services \nsuch as issuing permits and licenses, meeting with clients or citizens, and providing access to \npublic information and records.172   \n2.  Failure to Ensure Adequate Number of In-Person Polling Locations.   \nDefendants are also likely to severely burden many Wisconsin voters’ right to vote in the \nupcoming elections by failing to ensure an adequate number of in-person polling locations.  See \nLeague of Women Voters of Fla., Inc., v. Detzner, 314 F. Supp. 3d 1205, 1216 (N.D. Fla. 2018) \n(enjoining prohibition on early voting sites on college campuses as unjustified burden due to \nadditional travel distance for students).  For example, in the April 7 election, Milwaukee closed \n175 out of 180 polling sites, leaving voters to face wait-times of up to two-and-a-half hours, and \nin Green Bay, only 2 of 31 polling sites remained open and voters faced up to four-hour long \nwaits.173  See supra at 13-15.  Not only did these closures of vast number of in-person polling \nlocations result in exceptionally long wait times; the closures also caused dangerous \novercrowding, contributing to the unsafe in-person voting conditions described above.174  While \nthe desire to protect poll workers from potential exposure is a compelling interest, allowing \nnearly all polling places to close is not a reasonably—let alone narrowly—tailored solution.  \nLess restrictive means to protect poll-worker health while ensuring all voters are able to safely \nand effectively exercise their right to vote are available—including, e.g., providing and requiring \n                                                 \n172 Kennedy Report ¶¶ 38-39. \n173 SOPF ¶¶ 103, 105, 108-09. \n174 SOPF ¶ 119; see also Kennedy Report ¶ 87. \n40 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 52 of 79\n \nuse of adequate PPE, implementing appropriate social distancing measures, staging polling \nlocations appropriately, and spreading out the time, modes, and locations of voting.175  Yet \nDefendants have not taken these, or any other adequate steps to ensure that vast numbers of \npolling locations will not be closed again in the upcoming elections.  See supra at 13-15.  \n  Further, by restricting the pool of available poll workers by county, Wisconsin law makes \nit likely that poll-worker shortages—and corresponding closures of polling locations—will recur \nin the upcoming elections.  Under Wis. Stat. § 7.30(2), each election official, including each \ninspector, must be “a qualified elector of a county in which the municipality where the official \nserves is located.”  The county-residence requirement thus forbids recruiting inspectors from \nother parts of the state.  No compelling state interest justifies this arbitrary restriction, \nparticularly in light of the massive poll-worker shortages in the April 7 election and anticipated \npoll-worker shortages in the upcoming elections, shortages that experts fear will grow worse.176  \nSee supra at 13-15.  Lifting this restriction so that poll workers can be efficiently allocated \naround the State would facilitate a greater number of polling locations operating smoothly, \nefficiently, and safely for the November election.  \n  Wisconsin likewise requires municipalities to designate locations for in-person absentee \nvoting by June 11, 2020.  Wis. Stat. § 6.855(1).  If § 6.855(1) is enforced, the WEC and \nmunicipalities can no longer direct direct additional in-person absentee polling sites to be opened \nas a measure to spread out in-person voting, take pressure off election day, and provide an \nalternative to unreliable mail.  See supra at 11, 23-24; infra at 42-44.  This is especially \nproblematic because the pandemic and Wisconsin’s response to the pandemic will evolve \n                                                 \n175 Kennedy Report ¶¶ 39, 87; Remington Report at 1-2, 14-17. \n176 SOPF ¶ 237; Kennedy Report ¶¶ 67-69. \n \n41 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 53 of 79\n \nthroughout the summer, and because resources and locations available for in-person absentee \nvoting in November are not yet fully apparent.  Municipalities may have designated locations \n(say, public libraries) that could be closed when in-person absentee voting begins.  Again, no \ncompelling state interest justifies this early cut-off for designating polling sites during a \npandemic; municipalities should not be prohibited from adapting to COVID-19 by designating \nreplacement sites, additional sites to ease overcrowding, or better sites based on facilities that are \nultimately available.  Enjoining this provision would facilitate a greater number of in-person \npolling locations operating smoothly, efficiently, and safely for the November election.  \n3.  Statutory Deadline for Receipt of Absentee Ballots.   \nWisconsin’s statutory framework for valid return of mail-in absentee ballots is also likely \nto severely burden the right to vote for many Wisconsin voters.  Under current statutes, an \nabsentee ballot will be rejected, even if cast before election day, if it does not arrive at the \npolling place by 8 p.m. on election day.  Wis. Stat § 6.87(6).  But Wisconsin statutes authorize \nvoters to timely request an absentee ballot by mail up until five days (Thursday) before election \nday.  Wis. Stat. § 6.86(1)(b).  Because there is not enough time between Thursday and election \nday for ballots to be processed by a clerk, mailed to the voter, completed by the voter, witnessed, \nand then returned,177 the deadline currently in place effectively guarantees that many absentee \nballots will be rejected even though the voter made a timely request and acted consistently with \nstate law at every turn. \n  Indeed, in the April 7 election, the judicial orders enjoining this statute and ultimately \nauthorizing ballots to be accepted if postmarked by election day (rather than if received by \nelection day), see supra at 6-7, resulted in 79,054 additional ballots being counted that otherwise \n                                                 \n177 SOPF ¶¶ 232-34; Kennedy Report ¶¶ 126-129. \n42 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 54 of 79\n \nwould have been rejected, according to Defendants’ own analysis.178  This figure amounts to \n6.68% of all absentee ballots cast and 5.1% of all votes.  Put differently, absent judicial \nintervention, an alarming proportion of voters would have been disfranchised—through no fault \nof their own and despite following all procedures required by law—because their ballots were \ndelayed in the mail.   \n  This Court previously determined that the statutory deadline thus imposes an \nunconstitutional burden on the right to vote.  See DNC, 2020 WL 1638374, at *16-18.  That \nconclusion rested on findings equally—if not more—applicable to the upcoming election:  \nWisconsin clerks will again face unprecedented numbers of absentee-ballot requests,179 and \n“even the most diligent voter may be unable to return his or her ballot in time to be counted.”180  \nId. at *17.  As in the April 7 election, there is “no practical way that a person submitting a \nrequest for an absentee ballot on the deadline for submitting the request ... will have the time to \nreceive, vote and return their ballot by Election Day.”181  DNC, 2020 WL 1638374, at *17.  \nBecause “[t]he state’s interest in deadlines surely also extends to preserving the rights of those \nvoters who themselves relied on those deadlines,” and is not so “compelling as to overcome the \nburden faced by voters who, through no fault of their own, will be disenfranchised by the \nenforcement of the law,” id., Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their challenge to \nthe statutory absentee-ballot-receipt deadline. \n                                                 \n178 SOPF ¶ 67. \n179 SOPF ¶ 235; Kennedy Report ¶ 147. \n180 SOPF ¶ 236. \n181 Kennedy Report ¶¶ 134-37.   \n43 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 55 of 79\n \n4.  Absentee-Ballot Witnessing.   \nBecause disenfranchisement severely burdens the right to vote, disenfranchising a \nsubgroup of voters gives rise to a severe burden as to those voters.  See, e.g., Frank v. Walker, \n819 F.3d 384 (7th Cir. 2016) (agreeing that “high hurdles for some persons eligible to vote entitle \nthose particular persons to relief”); DNC, 2020 WL 1638374, at *20 (recognizing that \n“particular voters facing unreasonably high burdens” may be entitled to “specific relief”).   \n  For voters who are immunocompromised or at high risk from COVID-19, or who are \nactively infected with COVID-19, absentee voting is necessary to ensure they can vote at all.  \nSee supra at 28-30.  Yet, as explained above, for a limited class of these individuals who are \nunable to safely secure a witness, Wisconsin’s requirement that would-be absentee voters locate \nand secure a witness to verify the ballot and sign the envelope, Wis. Stat. § 6.87(2), will impose \na severe—indeed, insurmountable—obstacle to absentee voting in the upcoming elections.  See \nsupra at 32-34.   \n  On the other side of the ledger, Wisconsin has an interest in preventing voter fraud.  But, \nas this Court recognized in connection with the April 7 election, “the particularly high hurdles \nfaced by this subset of voters are not overcome by the state’s general anti-fraud goals, and some \nlimited relief is therefore appropriate.”  DNC, 2020 WL 1638374, at *20.182  The same holds true \n                                                 \n182 As discussed above, see supra at 6, 34 n.160, the Seventh Circuit stayed the portion of this \nCourt’s April 2 order that granted relief under Anderson-Burdick from § 6.87(2).  But that ruling \nrested on the Seventh Circuit’s concerns about the fast-moving nature of those proceedings in \nlight of the imminent April 7 election, the tailoring of the relief, and the sufficiency of the \npreliminary evidentiary record to overcome the state’s interest in preventing voter fraud—none \nof which obtains here.  The November election is sufficiently distant in time to avoid any risk of \nvoter confusion as a result of an order from this Court.  Plaintiffs’ proposed relief is tailored only \nto immunocompromised, high-risk, and currently infected voters, allowing the state to maintain \nits interest in protecting voter fraud.  Dkt. 37 ¶¶ 96-103, 161.  And with the opportunity at hand \nfor advance planning, the remedy can be extremely precise: for example, the Court can provide \nspecific language for an attestation and require WEC to ensure that language is provided with \nevery absentee ballot.  Finally, the evidence now available from the April 7 election shows that \n44 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 56 of 79\n \nfor the upcoming elections: the state’s interest in preventing voter fraud cannot justify imposing \nsuch a serious obstacle on these immunocompromised voters.  And the state’s anti-fraud goals \nwould, in any event, be adequately served by a self-certification on penalty of perjury.  For \ninstance, Wisconsin regularly relies on an affidavit requirement to prevent fraud elsewhere in the \nelection context.  See Wis. Stat. § 8.40(2) (requiring certification of qualified circulator on each \nsheet of petition for an election). \n  For several reasons, WEC’s proposed workarounds do not alleviate the burden posed by \nWis. Stat. § 6.87(2).183  First, Wisconsin’s 11-step process for voters to have their absentee-ballot \nwitnessed may be difficult to understand by the homebound individual or witness with limited \nliteracy or cognitive abilities.184  Second, these steps—which suggest witnessing through a \nwindow or open door—may be impractical in certain situations, such as for persons living in \nmulti-level or multi-unit apartment complexes.185  Perhaps most revealing, by allowing the \nwitness to be a mail or food delivery person, Defendants themselves undermine their asserted \nanti-fraud interest—those “witnesses” will often lack the knowledge to certify that “the voter \nwho requested the ballot is the person who actually received and voted the ballot.”186  \nDefendants’ suggestion that voters should leave their certificate envelopes outside unattended for \n                                                 \nmaintaining the witness requirement for immunocompromised voters did in fact disenfranchise \nvoters, heightening the need for relief and demonstrably outweighing the state’s interest in \npreventing fraud for those voters.

Plaintiffs Are Likely To Prevail On Their Claims That Defendants Are \nViolating the Procedural Guarantees of the Due Process Clause Of The \nFourteenth Amendment (Count 4).  \n  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their procedural due process claims because Defendants \nfail to provide effective notice and an opportunity to be heard with respect to a denial of a \nrequest for an absentee ballot, or the rejection of an absentee ballot timely cast.  Defendants \nfurther fail to provide clear, effective, and comprehensive notice to Wisconsin voters about the \nprocedures and requirements to have their ballot counted, the modifications being made in light \nof COVID-19, and the voting opportunities available to each eligible voter. \nWisconsin may not deprive any voter of “liberty or property” without “due process of \nlaw.”  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.  The right to vote is fundamental, see Harper v. Va. Bd. of \nElections, 383 U.S. 663, 666 (1966), and is a “liberty” or property interest protected by the due \nprocess clause.  See, e.g., Raetzel v. Parks/Bellemont Absentee Election Bd., 762 F. Supp. 1354, \n1357 (D. Ariz. 1990).  By granting all eligible voters a right to obtain an absentee ballot for any \nreason, Wis. Stat. §§ 6.20, 6.86, and then to cast an absentee ballot, id. § 6.87(6), the State has \ncreated statutory rights that are entitled to due process protection.  See Saucedo v. Gardner, 335 \nF. Supp. 3d 202 (D.N.H. 2018); Zessar v. Helander, 2006 WL 642646, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 13, \n2006); Raetzel v. Parks/Bellemont Absentee Election Bd., 762 F. Supp. at 1358; see also One \nWis. Inst. v. Thomsen, 198 F. Supp. 3d 896, 933 (W.D. Wis. 2016) (rejecting “argument that \nplaintiffs’ challenge to ... in-person absentee voting provisions does not implicate their \nconstitutional rights”). \n                                                 \n187 SOPF ¶ 86. \n46 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 58 of 79\n \n“The hallmarks of procedural due process are notice and an opportunity to be heard.”  \nPugel v. Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ill., 378 F.3d 659, 662-63 (7th Cir. 2004).  The specific form such \nprocedures must take is determined by considering, “first, the private interest that will be \naffected by the official action” including “the degree of potential deprivation;” “second, the risk \nof an erroneous deprivation of  such interest through the procedures used, and the probable \nvalue, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards;” and, third “the Government’s \ninterest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the \nadditional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.”  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. \n319, 335, 341 (1976).188 \nHere, the private interest at stake—the right to vote by absentee ballot—weighs heavily \nin the balance, and its weight has only increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  For \nmany people, including Plaintiffs Swenson and Nelson, voting absentee by mail is the only way \nto exercise the franchise without seriously jeopardizing their lives or health.189  For most others, \nmail-in absentee voting is far safer than voting in person on election day—both because of the \nrisk to the voter’s own health and the risk of viral transmission at the polls or afterwards.190  \nDefendants themselves have described an “exceptional shift to vote-by-mail,” reporting that \n61.8% of voters cast an absentee ballot by mail in the most recent statewide elections, \nrepresenting a massive increase from other recent elections where the proportion of votes cast by \n                                                 \n188 Because these procedural rights are analytically distinct from the Anderson/Burdick \nframework, there is a specific “rationale for applying the Mathews test over the Anderson-\nBurdick test.”  Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann, 2020 WL 3077047, at *7 (W.D. Wis. \nJun. 10, 2020).  The focus of the procedural due process inquiry is what process is due before a \nstatutorily protected liberty or property interest is deprived.  Voters are entitled to such process \nwhether or not their absence imposes a burden on the substantive right to vote sufficient to \nprevail under the Anderson/Burdick framework.  \n189 SOPF ¶ 226; Remington Report at 12-13. \n190 SOPF ¶ 227; Remington Report at 12-13. \n47 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 59 of 79\n \nmail ranged between only 4.8 and 8.1%.191  See supra at 9.  But even with this shift, as many as \n166,000 voters statewide were deterred from voting in the April election, because they had never \nbefore voted by mail.192  The interest at stake in ensuring voters can effectively both request and \ncast an absentee ballot is very weighty indeed.   \n1.  Requesting Absentee Ballots  \nAdditional procedural protections are necessary to avoid erroneous denials of absentee-\nballot requests.  As it stands, thousands of Wisconsin voters who requested absentee ballots in \nthe April election never received one.  Many of these voters, like Plaintiffs McCurtis and Nelson, \nnever even received an explanation for the denial of an absentee ballot: one simply never \narrived.193  Supra at 9-10 & nn.45-46.  Although the Elections Commission now intends to mail \nabsentee ballot applications to nearly all registered voters who have not already requested one,194 \nthis single action will not correct the failures exposed by the April 7 election. \nThere are a number of reasons for these widespread failures.  Some voters’ ballots appear \nto have been mishandled or misplaced in the mail system.  See supra at 9-10.  The online system \nfor requesting and tracking absentee ballots (MyVote.wi.gov) suffered from numerous \nbreakdowns—including frequent overloads and timeouts, problems recording ballot requests, \nand failure to provide accurate information about whether ballots were in fact mailed to a voter.  \nSee supra at 7-9.  In a May 20 memorandum, Defendants mention intelligent mail barcodes as a \n“potential direction,” without any assurances that any system will ultimately be implemented.195  \n                                                 \n191 SOPF ¶ 49. \n192 Fowler Report at 11-12.   \n193 SOPF ¶¶ 52, 161, 175. \n194 SOPF ¶ 243. \n195 Kennedy Report ¶¶ 122-23. \n48 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 60 of 79\n \nMoreover, Defendants failed to issue clear, statewide guidance about how municipal clerks must \npermit a voter to obtain an absentee ballot in the event their first request was rejected or simply \nnot processed in a timely fashion.196  As a result, plaintiffs and many thousands of other people \nwere deprived of an absentee ballot.  \nThese problems could be solved with simple, additional procedural protections.  With \nrespect to the MyVote system, the right to obtain an absentee ballot would be properly protected \nif Defendants ensured well in advance that there were sufficient bandwidth and server resources \nto manage the volume of requests anticipated for the November elections, and if the system were \nconfigured to track not just ballot requests, but delivery of ballots through the mailing process as \nwell.197  Although Defendant Wolfe acknowledged in her May 20 CARES Grant Planning \nMemorandum the need for “software development and consultation” and “system load testing,” \nshe made no specific mention of adding additional capacity.198 \nWith respect to processing and delivery of absentee ballots more generally, Defendants \nmust issue directives requiring municipal clerks to provide prompt, effective notice to a voter if \ntheir ballot request is defective or if it will not be filled within one day as required by law, Wis. \nStat. § 7.15(1)(cm); and clear, uniform procedures to cure any defect in a ballot request or \nreplace an undelivered ballot.199  Moreover, the Court should direct Defendants to establish \npolicies applicable to municipal clerks regarding coordination with the U.S. Postal Service to \nensure that USPS is prepared for the anticipated volume of outgoing and incoming mail,200 and \n                                                 \n196 SOPF ¶ 59; Kennedy Report ¶ 25. \n197 Kennedy Report ¶¶ 43-48, 113-16, 119. \n198 SOPF ¶ 241. \n199 Kennedy Report ¶¶ 108-12.   \n200 Kennedy Report ¶¶ 113-16. \n49 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 61 of 79\n \nto establish procedures for processing mail (including, for example, a special tracking barcode) \nin order to avoid lost ballots and to provide voters with timely notice if their ballot is delayed or \nlost so that they can take steps to obtain a new absentee ballot in time to cast it.201  Defendants \nshould also ensure safe and sufficient in-person absentee voting sites, which allow voters \nimmediate access to an absentee ballot and reduce the pressure on the mail and the online ballot-\nrequest system.202  Wis. Stat. §§ 6.86(1)-(2), 6.855.  None of these measures imposes a \nsignificant or disproportionate burden on the government.  Indeed, some municipalities adopted \nsuch measures despite the absence of statewide direction by Defendants.203  Supra at 10-11 & \nn.47. \nEffective public education by Defendants is also necessary to provide voters with \nconstitutionally adequate notice of their rights, and the procedures they must follow, if they do \nnot receive their absentee ballot promptly after requesting one.204  The details of voting \nprocedures cannot readily be discerned by consulting statute books because much discretion is \nleft to Defendants to determine how voting procedures are implemented.  This is particularly true \nwith respect to procedures that have been adopted or modified to respond to the COVID-19 \npandemic. \nDefendants must provide every voter with timely, clear, effective notice of the procedures \navailable to them to exercise their statutory right to vote absentee.  “The means employed” to \nprovide notice “must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might \nreasonably adopt to accomplish it.”  Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Tr. Co., 339 U.S. 306, \n                                                 \n201 Kennedy Report ¶¶ 117-23. \n202 Kennedy Report ¶¶ 79-97. \n203 Kennedy Report ¶ 29. \n204 Kennedy Report ¶¶ 157-64.   \n50 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 62 of 79\n \n315 (1950) (“The reasonableness and hence the constitutional validity of any chosen method \nmay be defended on the ground that it is in itself reasonably certain to inform those affected.”); \nGen. Elec. Co. v. EPA, 53 F.3d 1324, 1329 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (“[E]lementary fairness compels \nclarity in the statements and regulations setting forth the actions with which the agency expects \nthe public to comply.”) (internal quotation omitted).  And the means employed must be designed \nto reach all voters—including those with disabilities and those without ready access to the \ninternet.  See infra at 53-54. \nIt is appropriate for this Court to direct Defendants to provide this kind of “explanatory \nnotice” regarding their rights, Jordan v. Trainor, 563 F.3d 873, 875 (7th Cir. 1977), aff’d, Quern \nv. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332 (1979), particularly where changes to voting procedures are at issue, cf. \nVeasey v. Abbott, 830 F.3d 216, 256 & n.52 (5th Cir. 2016), and Defendants have clear statutory \nauthority to engage in such outreach, Wis. Stat. § 5.05(12) (empowering WEC to “conduct or \nprescribe requirements for educational programs to inform electors about voting procedures, \nvoting rights, and voting technology”). \n2.  Absentee-Ballot Counting  \nAdditional procedural protections are also necessary with respect to the rejection of \nabsentee ballots that are actually cast.  Wisconsin law allows officials to reject an absentee ballot \nfor numerous reasons including, for example, if the witness certification is “insufficient,” Wis. \nStat. §§ 6.88(3), 7.52(3)(b), if a person “is not a qualified elector in the ward or election district,” \nid., and if a voter appears on a list provided by the Department of Corrections of people \ndisenfranchised because they remain under supervision on a felony conviction, id. § 6.29(2)(am).  \nIn the April 7 election, more than 14,000 ballots were rejected for an insufficient certification \n51 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 63 of 79\n \nand thousands of other ballots were rejected for other reasons.205  Election inspectors also retain \nbroad discretion to challenge absentee ballots for other reasons when ballots are canvassed.  Wis. \nStat. §§ 6.93, 7.52(5).  Yet despite all of these grounds for rejection—each one of which can \ninvite error—Wisconsin does not guarantee individual voters any opportunity to be heard on \nwhether such rejections are incorrect.206   \nThe timelines for counting absentee ballots in Wisconsin make it difficult or impossible \nto provide adequate notice and opportunity to be heard.  The law does not allow absentee ballots \nto be counted until election day—even if they are received weeks prior.  Wis. Stat. §§ 6.88, 7.51-\n.52.  The law also instructs election officials, upon receipt of an absentee ballot, to “enclose it, \nunopened, in a carrier envelope” and to leave it untouched until election day.  Wis. Stat. § 6.88.  \nThese provisions mean that any alleged defects in an absentee ballot—such as a problem with \nthe witness certification—will not be identified until election day, and voters could not, even in \ntheory, receive timely notice prior to election day that their ballot has been or will be rejected. \nStill worse, under current law, Wisconsin does not provide notice of alleged grounds for \nrejecting a ballot even after they are discovered on election day.  Wisconsin does not even notify \nvoters whether their ballot has been counted until 30 or 45 days post-election, well after results \nhave been certified and far too late to remedy an erroneous ballot rejection.  See Wis. Stat. \n§ 6.275 (30-day deadline to report); id. § 6.33(5)(a)(3) (45-day deadline to report on General \nElection); § 7.60(5) (deadlines to certify county results); id. § 7.70(3)(a) (deadlines to certify \nstatewide results).207  \n                                                 \n205 SOPF ¶¶ 89-90; Kennedy Report ¶ 30. \n206 The process for challenging absentee ballots on or after election day during the canvassing \nprocess does not involve any notice to the voter or opportunity to be heard.  See Wis. Stat. § \n7.52. \n207 SOPF ¶ 88. \n52 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 64 of 79\n \n  These procedures violate voters’ right to timely notice and an opportunity to be heard \nwhen their ballots are being rejected.  Absentee voters must have an opportunity to contest a \ndecision to reject their ballot and such opportunity must include, at minimum, timely individual \nnotice of the reasons the ballot was rejected, and a meaningful opportunity to show that the \nrelevant officials’ determination was in error before results are finalized.  See, e.g., Zessar, 2006 \nWL 642646 (invalidating absentee-voting scheme that failed to provide notice that ballot had \nbeen rejected or opportunity to contest before certification deadline); Raetzel, 762 F. Supp. 1354 \n(same); Saucedo, 335 F. Supp. 3d at 219-22 (requiring notice and opportunity to be heard before \nballot is rejected for mismatched signatures).  \nIn order to afford constitutionally adequate notice and a timely opportunity to be heard, \nlaws currently forbidding canvassing of absentee ballots prior to election day should be \ninvalidated.208  Wis. Stat. §§ 6.88, 7.51-.52.  Early notice, prior to election day where possible, is \nnecessary to allow a timely and meaningful opportunity to be respond on the matter and, where \nappropriate, to cure defects.209  \nMoreover, in order for notices to be effective, they must be designed to reach all voters—\nincluding those with disabilities, without ready access to the internet, or who are unable \n                                                 \n208 Kennedy Report ¶¶ 110-11, 141-46. \n209 Kennedy Report ¶¶ 141-42.  Before the April 7 election, for example, the Commission \nsuggested in an April 5 memorandum that municipal clerks should “make best efforts” to contact \nvoters if their ballot was missing a witness signature, and provide an opportunity to cure by \nhaving their original witness appear with them at the clerk’s office or at the polls on election day.  \nSee SOPF ¶ 88.  While this guidance attempted to recognize the notice and opportunity-to-cure \nrequirements of due process, it fell short because it was not mandatory, came extremely late in \nthe election cycle and thus likely missed many ballots, and did not provide a timely opportunity \nto be heard or to cure.  It is also unclear how clerks could comply with the requirement to notify \nvoters about a missing witness signature given the statutory requirement to place absentee ballots \nin a “carrier envelope” that is “securely sealed” and not to be opened until election day.  Wis. \nStat. § 6.88. \n53 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 65 of 79\n \neffectively to navigate the MyVote website.  Due process requires notice that is meaningful and \neffective, including to those who are “aged, blind, or disabled” or “unable or disinclined, because \nof physical handicaps [or] mental handicaps ... to take the necessary affirmative action” to seek \nout notice from particular sources.  Vargas v. Trainor, 508 F.2d 485, 489 (7th Cir. 1974); see \nalso, e.g., Kapps v. Wing, 404 F.3d 105, 124 (2d Cir. 2005) (“[I]n the absence of effective notice, \nthe other due process rights ... such as the right to a timely hearing ... are rendered fundamentally \nhollow.”).  Encouraging voters to visit the MyVote website to determine the status of their \nabsentee ballot therefore does not on its own satisfy due process.  Instead, Defendants should be \nrequired to send explanations of the applicable procedures with a statewide mailing of absentee-\nballot request forms and to instruct municipal clerks to send explanations with every absentee \nballot they send out to voters.   \nC.  Plaintiffs Are Likely To Prevail On Their Claim That Defendants’ Arbitrary \nAnd Disparate Election Administration Violates The Equal Protection \nClause Of The Fourteenth Amendment (Count 2). \n“In decision after decision,” the Supreme Court has held that the Equal Protection Clause \nprotects voters’ “right to participate in elections on an equal basis with other citizens in the \njurisdiction.”  Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 336 (1972).210  That guarantee extends not only \nto “the initial allocation of the franchise,” but to “the manner of its exercise.”  Bush v. Gore, 531 \nU.S. 98, 104 (2000) (emphasis added).  After granting citizens the right to vote, states therefore \n                                                 \n210 See also, e.g., Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368, 380 (1963) (“The idea that every voter is equal \nto every other voter in his State … underlies many of our decisions.”); Hadley v. Junior Coll. \nDist. of Metro. Kansas City, Mo., 397 U.S. 50, 54 (1970) (“[I]n situations involving elections, the \nStates are required to insure that each person’s vote counts as much, insofar as it as practicable, \nas any other person’s.”); United States v. Mosley, 238 U.S. 383, 386 (1915) (It is \n“unquestionable that the right to have one’s vote counted is as open to protection as the right to \nput a ballot in a box.”). \n54 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 66 of 79\n \n“may not, by later arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one person’s vote over that of \nanother.”  Id. at 104-105.211   \nDefendants are prohibited, for example, from “arbitrarily deny[ing]” citizens “the right to \nvote depending on where they live,” including by “causing … severe wait times” in certain \npolling places.  League of Women Voters of Ohio v. Brunner, 548 F.3d 463, 476, 477-78 (6th Cir. \n2008); see also Ury, 303 F. Supp. at 124 (forcing voters in certain populous precincts “to wait \nunreasonable lengths of time to obtain and cast their ballots” due to “inadequate voting facilities \nand the failure to provide sufficient [election officials]” “effectively deprived [voters in those \nprecincts] of their right to vote” in violation of the Equal Protection Clause); cf. Sims, 377 U.S. at \n565 (burdening the right to vote “because of [a voter’s] place of residence impairs basic \nconstitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment”).   \nDefendants’ administration of the April 7 election violated this basic constitutional \ncommand.  Despite the foreseeable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on registration, absentee \nballots, in-person voting, and other election procedures, Defendants failed to adopt “specific \nrules designed to ensure uniform treatment” or other measures to ensure the “nonarbitrary \ntreatment of voters.”  Bush, 531 U.S. at 105.  Consequently, far from being “able to participate \n                                                 \n211 Bush v.

See supra at 13-15, 38-42.  The burdens \nof poll closings and worker shortages were not, however, borne equally.  In Madison, for \nexample, 66 out of 92 polling places remained open, reducing wait times considerably.212  And, \nbelying claims that disparities resulted from independent local decision making, wide differences \npersisted even within the same county:  In Wauwatosa, a small city in Milwaukee County \nbordering the City of Milwaukee, voters faced practically no lines at all.213  See supra at 15.  \nBecause Defendants failed to prepare, including by adopting measures for the intra-county \nsharing of poll workers214 or by uniformly adopting drive-through voting or other forms of in-\nperson absentee voting,215 these foreseeable disparities went unaddressed. \nWidely different access to equipment necessary to guarantee safe in-person voting \nsimilarly imposed unequal burdens on voters.  See supra at 17-19.  Polling places in parts of the \nstate suffering from the highest prevalence of COVID-19, like the City of Milwaukee,216 lacked \nthe social distancing protocols and safety equipment—such as PPE and sanitized voting \nmachines—required to ensure safe voting.217  Voters in Green Bay likewise were not directed to \n                                                 \n212 SOPF ¶ 111. \n213 SOPF ¶ 114. \n214 SOPF ¶ 102. \n215 SOPF ¶ 64. \n216 Fowler Report at 7, 12.   \n217 SOPF ¶ 118. \n56 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 68 of 79\n \nuse sanitization supplies,218 and election officials in multiple jurisdictions did not use PPE.219  It \nis no surprise then that as many as 8.4% of voters in these high-prevalence counties were \ndeterred from casting a ballot.220  Meanwhile, other cities made serious strides toward ensuring \nsafe in-person voting.  In Madison and Neenah, for instance, Plexiglas barriers protected poll \nworkers.221  And in Fitchburg, equipment was frequently sanitized and all poll workers were \nrequired to wear masks and gloves.222 \nArbitrary disparities similarly plagued voter registration and requests for absentee ballots.  \nSee supra at 7-13.  Defendants’ failure to adopt a uniform response to increased volume \ntransformed voting absentee into a game of chance.  Many voters faced problems requesting \nabsentee ballots online in the first instance due to problems with MyVote.223  Other voters were \nable to submit requests for absentee ballots through MyVote, but were later advised by clerks \nthat there was no record of their requests.224  Yet other voters timely requested absentee ballots \nbut did not receive their ballot in time to vote,225 received envelopes with no ballots inside (or \nduplicate ballots),226 or were unable to return ballots to the clerks’ offices due to mail delivery \nproblems.227  At the same time, voters in other parts of the state navigated a relatively smooth \nprocess.  For instance, some municipalities—like Whitefish Bay and Bayside—timely mailed \n                                                 \n218 SOPF ¶ 122. \n219 SOPF ¶¶ 121, 123-24. \n220 Fowler Report at 9-10.   \n221 SOPF ¶¶ 126-27. \n222 SOPF ¶ 129. \n223 SOPF ¶¶ 41-47. \n224 SOPF ¶ 44. \n225 SOPF ¶¶ 72, 161, 175. \n226 SOPF ¶ 71. \n227 SOPF ¶ 73. \n57 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 69 of 79\n \nevery registered voter an absentee ballot request form on the different ways to obtain an absentee \nballot, with the predictable result of significantly boosting voter participation rates through the \nabsentee process.228   \nThese radical differences in absentee and in-person voting experiences did more than \ncause general inconvenience.  In addition to depressing voter turnout by tens of thousands in \nhard-hit locations like Milwaukee,229 they imposed severe burdens on specific classes of voters.  \nSee supra at 17-19.  Many disabled voters, for instance, require assistive technology available \nonly at in-person polling locations.230  Given the poll closings and lack of safety protocols, those \nvoters had no safe or practical way to cast a ballot in some parts of Wisconsin.231  The lack of \nsafe in-person voting options likewise disproportionally impacted older voters, resulting in \nsignificantly lower turnout among voters over 65 relative to similarly situated younger voters.232 \nMinority communities were also disproportionately likely to be on the wrong side of \nvoting access disparities.  See supra at 18-19.  Black and Hispanic Americans are more likely to \ndie from COVID-19 than others.233  And the most dangerous and difficult places to vote in April, \nlike the City of Milwaukee, are home to the vast majority of Wisconsin’s minority population.234  \nUnsurprisingly, estimates suggest voter participation in zip codes with higher proportions of \nBlack and Hispanic voters was significantly lower in April than would be expected given prior \n                                                 \n228 SOPF ¶ 55. \n229 Fowler Report at 8-11.  \n230 SOPF ¶ 211. \n231 SOPF ¶ 212. \n232 Fowler Report at 12-14. \n233 Fowler Report at 14. \n234 SOPF ¶ 104; Fowler Report at 15. \n58 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 70 of 79\n \nvoting history.235  See supra at 18-19.  That these disparities disproportionately harmed members \nof a protected class warrants heightened scrutiny.  See Black v. McGuffage, 209 F. Supp. 2d 889 \n(N.D. Ill. 2002) (“When the allegedly arbitrary system also results in a greater negative impact \non groups defined by traditionally suspect criteria, there is cause for serious concern.”); cf. One \nWis. Inst., 198 F. Supp. 3d at 959 (“Disparities in housing, education, and employment, have left \nminority groups condensed into high-density urban areas, which makes them particularly \nvulnerable to Wisconsin’s [voting access] rules.”). \nIn short, the April 7 election was “not a process with sufficient guarantees of equal \ntreatment.”  Bush, 531 U.S. at 107.  Some Wisconsinites had a safe and practical opportunity to \nobtain and cast their ballot, but tens of thousands did not.  Plaintiff Nelson, for instance, did not \nreceive her absentee ballot in time to vote, despite submitting a timely request.236  As an \nimmunocompromised voter unable to vote in person safely, she was thus disenfranchised in the \nApril 7 election.237  Similarly, because Plaintiff McCurtis never received the absentee ballot she \nhad timely requested, she was forced not only to endure a more than two-and-a-half hour line at a \nMilwaukee polling place, but also to risk the health of her immunocompromised mother by \nvoting at a site lacking adequate social distancing protocols, PPE, or sanitary voting \nequipment.238   \nDefendants have not, and cannot, advance any rationale for failing to implement “specific \nstandards” to avoid these arbitrary and disparate burdens on the franchise.  Bush, 531 U.S. at \n106.  While Defendants faced—and will continue to face—unprecedented challenges in \n                                                 \n235 Fowler Report at 14-16. \n236 SOPF ¶ 175. \n237 SOPF ¶¶ 176-77. \n238 SOPF ¶¶ 105, 120-21. \n59 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 71 of 79\n \nadministering elections during a pandemic, “practical difficulties” and “[t]he press of time” are \nnot an “excuse for ignoring equal protection guarantees.”  Id. at 108.  Defendants must, \ntherefore, take all reasonable measures to ensure that “the rudimentary requirements of equal \ntreatment and fundamental fairness are satisfied.”  Id. at 105.   \nDefendants have not met that obligation, and there is no indication they will do so absent \nthis Court’s intervention.  See supra at 20-24.  If this Court does not grant Plaintiffs’ requested \nrelief, the same equal-protection violations experienced during the April 7 election are all but \ncertain to recur.  Voters should not have to rely on good fortune to exercise their fundamental \nright to vote.  And Plaintiffs, including Ms. Nelson and Ms. McCurtis, need not wait to be \ndisenfranchised a second time before asserting their rights under the Equal Protection Clause.239  \nFor all of those reasons, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their Equal Protection claim.  \nIII.  IN THE ABSENCE OF A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, PLAINTIFFS WILL \nSUFFER IRREPARABLE HARM DURING THE PENDENCY OF THIS \nACTION. \n  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm unless the court issues a preliminary injunction.  \nInaction creates an intolerable risk of infringing on Plaintiffs’ fundamental right to vote in \nNovember.  And courts consistently find that infringements on the right to vote cannot be \nremedied after the fact.  See League of Women Voters of N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, \n247 (4th Cir. 2014) (“Courts routinely deem restrictions on fundamental voting rights irreparable \ninjury.”) (collecting cases); Obama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 435 (6th Cir. 2012) (“A \n                                                 \n239 See League of Women Voters of Ohio v. Blackwell, 432 F. Supp. 2d 723, 728 (N.D. Ohio \n2005), aff’d in part, rev’d in part, 548 F.3d 463 (6th Cir. 2008) (A “state’s failure to exercise \n[its] power, where … inaction foreseeably impairs the fair and equal exercise of the franchise” \nviolates right to “equal protection”); NAACP State Conf. of Pa. v. Cortes, 591 F. Supp. 2d 757, \n765 (E.D. Pa. 2008) (injunctive relief is appropriate where “there is a real danger” that \n“unacceptably long lines” on election day will unduly burden right to vote and violate equal \nprotection).   \n60 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 72 of 79\n \nrestriction on the fundamental right to vote ... constitutes irreparable injury.”); DNC, 2020 WL \n1638374, at *11.  In the Seventh Circuit, “the existence of a continuing constitutional violation \nconstitutes proof of an irreparable harm.”  Preston v. Thompson, 589 F.2d 300, 303 n.3 (7th Cir. \n1978).  This is “particularly true” where, as here, the First Amendment rights to expression and \nassociation are at issue.  Ezell v. City of Chicago, 651 F.3d 684, 699 (7th Cir. 2011).  \nAdditionally, at least one court has found irreparable harm in the context of a Section 11(b) \nintimidation claim under the Voting Rights Act, like the one at issue here, noting that if potential \nmembers of the electorate suffer intimidation “such that their right to vote freely is abridged, or \naltogether extinguished,” they have been irreparably harmed.  Ariz. Democratic Party v. Ariz. \nRepublican Party, 2016 WL 8669978, at *11 (D. Ariz. Nov. 4, 2016). \n  Money damages cannot make voters whole after they have been disenfranchised or \notherwise burdened in the exercise of their rights to vote.  See League of Women Voters of N. C., \n769 F.3d at 247 (“[O]nce the election occurs, there can be no do-over and no redress.”); DNC, \n2020 WL 1638374, at *11; Ariz. Democratic Party, 2016 WL 8669978, at *11 (“[I]f some \npotential voters are improperly dissuaded from exercising their franchise, it is unlikely those \nvoters can be identified, their votes cannot be recast, and no amount of traditional remedies such \nas money damages would suffice after the fact.”). \n  Injunctive relief is especially appropriate in the face of serious and irreparable public \nhealth consequences.  Plaintiffs have shown that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to continue \nthrough the fall, see supra at 20-22, and that Defendants have not taken sufficient measures to \nensure safe and effective voting in November, see supra at 22-24.  Moreover, Plaintiffs Swenson \nand Nelson have health conditions that will continue to place them at high risk for serious illness \n61 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 73 of 79\n \nand death if they contract COVID-19, and Plaintiff McCurtis will still be living with her \nimmunocompromised mother come November.240 \n  Absent relief, Plaintiffs, like other Wisconsin voters, will once again face a choice \nbetween disenfranchisement and risking significant adverse health consequences.  In such \ncircumstances, an injunction is appropriate to prevent potential suffering, illness, and death.  See \nLAJIM, LLC v. Gen. Elec. Co., 917 F.3d 933, 942 (7th Cir. 2019) (recognizing that “the denial of \ninjunctive relief after a district court has found a risk of imminent and substantial danger to \npublic health ... should be rare”);  Harris v. Bd. of Supervisors, 366 F.3d 754, 766 (9th Cir. 2004) \n(injunctive relief preventing hospital closure appropriate because “exacerbation of the current \novercrowded situation and additional suffering” constitutes irreparable harm); State of N.Y. v. \nSullivan, 906 F.2d 910, 918 (2d Cir. 1990) (colorable claim of irreparable harm where denial of \nrelief “potentially subjected claimants to deteriorating health, and possibly even to death”).   \n  The organizational plaintiffs will also suffer irreparable harm because they will be forced \nto devote additional staff time and resources to assisting voters with registration and absentee-\nballot requests, educating voters about their options, thereby impeding their other work and \nhampering their ability to achieve their missions.241  “Where organizational plaintiffs are \ncompelled to divert and expend their resources to address a defendant’s allegedly wrongful \nconduct, this is enough to satisfy their burden of showing a likelihood of suffering irreparable \nharm.”  Ind. State Conf. of NAACP v. Lawson, 326 F. Supp. 3d 646, 662 (S.D. Ind. 2018), aff’d \nsub nom. Common Cause Ind. v. Lawson, 937 F.3d 944 (7th Cir. 2019). \n                                                 \n240 SOPF ¶¶ 169-71, 179-80. \n241 SOPF ¶¶ 181-183, 194-95, 209-10. \n62 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 74 of 79\n \n  Plaintiffs are likely to experience these irreparable harms before trial.  The November \nelection is just months away.  As a result, permanent injunctive relief is likely to come either \nafter one or both elections or too close to the election to grant relief under Purcell v. Gonzalez, \n549 U.S. 1 (2006).  Preliminary injunctive relief is warranted. \nIV.  THE BALANCE OF HARDSHIPS SUPPORTS ISSUANCE OF AN INJUNCTION. \nThe equities strongly favor issuing the injunctive relief sought by Plaintiffs here.  That \nrelief would permit Wisconsin citizens, like and including Plaintiffs, to vote without risking their \nhealth and that of others.  Absent judicial intervention, the ongoing pandemic threatens to upend \nthe November general election, which will likely see millions of voters seeking to vote \nabsentee—or seeking safe ways to vote in person.242  See supra at 20-24.  On the other side of \nthe ledger, Defendants will have the administrative burden of implementing these measures.  But \n“administrative inconvenience” alone cannot justify an intrusion upon fundamental rights.  \nTaylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 535 (1975).  And the measures sought here would in any case \nimpose only modest burdens, if any.  \nFor example, this Court can, as it did in April, suspend the deadline by which ballots \nmust be received, so that all voters who timely request and vote a ballot can have their votes \ncounted—at little or no cost to Defendants.  See supra at 42-43.  The Court likewise can require \nelection officials to ensure online ballots are accessible to voters with print disabilities so they \ncan vote privately and independently, as is required by federal law.  See supra at 34-36.  Indeed, \nin some instance, there would be effectively no burden on Defendants at all.  For example, an \ninjunction suspending the requirement that poll workers cannot live in a different county would \n                                                 \n242 See SOPF ¶ 246; see also Kennedy Report ¶¶ 125, 147. \n63 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 75 of 79\n \nimpose no financial or administrative burden, and it would likely make election administration \neasier by permitting more efficient allocation of resources.  See supra at 13-14. \nAs detailed throughout, “the severe burdens that voters are sure to face in the upcoming \nelection” outweigh any corresponding burden on Defendants.  DNC, 2020 WL 1638374, at *13.  \nAnd the equities favor entering an injunction now—while there is still sufficient time for \nDefendants to implement these measures and notify the public.  Delay, by contrast, “may \nultimately preclude relief under the Purcell doctrine,” leaving constitutional and statutory \nviolations of fundamental rights unremedied.  Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann, 2020 WL \n3077047, at *4 (W.D. Wis. Jun. 10, 2020).  That result should not be tolerated. \nV.  AN INJUNCTION IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. \nBoth Defendants and the voting public have an overwhelmingly strong interest in a safe, \norderly, and accessible election.  “As a general matter, enforcing constitutional rights is in the \npublic interest,” and that rule applies with even more force here because “certainly, the public \ninterest favors permitting as many qualified voters to vote as possible.”  DNC, 2020 WL \n1638374, at *14 (quotations and citation omitted); see also, e.g., Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, \n4 (2006).  The relief proposed by Plaintiffs is narrowly tailored to achieve that end. \nIn many instances, moreover, that relief would further the State’s interest in “the \nmaintenance of order in the election process.”  DNC, 2020 WL 1638374, at *13 (quotations \nomitted).  For instance, ensuring an adequate number of polling places is necessary to avoid \nelection-day chaos, and a public-education campaign can only serve to benefit the public’s and \nState’s interest in a smooth election.  Likewise, a functioning and accessible absentee-ballot \nsystem will not only maintain order within that system, but it will have the collateral benefit of \nrelieving a significant burden on in-person voting as well.  And even where the State does have \nan interest in the enforcement of its election laws (none of which were drafted with the current \n64 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 76 of 79\n \ncircumstances in mind), that interest “is overcome by voters’ right to exercise their franchise \nwithout undue burdens,” especially as Plaintiffs here have requested relief with ample time for \nDefendants to implement it.  Id. at *20. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court issue a preliminary \ninjunction that enjoins, for the November 2020 election, the enforcement of: \n1.  Wis. Stat. § 7.30(2) with respect to the requirement that each election official be an \nelector of the county in which the municipality is located; \n2.  Wis. Stat. § 6.87(2) during the pendency of the COVID-19 pandemic for all voters who \nare immunocompromised or otherwise at high risk from COVID-19, or who are actively \ninfected with COVID-19, who cannot safely secure an in-person witness; \n3.  Wis. Stat. § 6.855(1) with respect to the requirement that all in-person absentee voting \nlocations for the November general election must have already been designated; \n4.  Wis. Stat § 6.87(6) and require that absentee ballots postmarked by election day or not \nbearing a postmark but received within a week of election day be counted; and \n5.  Wis. Stat. §§ 6.88, 7.51-.52 with respect to the requirement that absentee ballots not be \ncounted before election day. \nPlaintiffs further request that the Court order Defendants, for the November 2020 election, to: \n1.  Take all appropriate actions to ensure that in-person voting, whether exercised by casting \nan absentee ballot or by casting a ballot on election day, can be safely conducted; \n2.  Require that accessible voting machines be available at all in-person absentee voting \nlocations;  \n3.  Take all appropriate actions to ensure an adequate number of poll workers to administer \nsafe polling places;  \n65 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 77 of 79\n \n4.  Ensure that each registered voter in Wisconsin receives an absentee ballot request form \nand that all residents of care facilities have adequate opportunities to register to vote and \nrequest absentee ballots;  \n5.  Ensure that individuals with print disabilities have an accessible means of receiving, \nmarking, and submitting absentee ballots privately and independently; \n6.  Take all appropriate actions to ensure that all voters who request and are qualified to \nreceive an absentee ballot in fact receive such absentee ballot, and that any voter whose \nrequest for an absentee ballot is rejected or not processed for any reason be notified and \ngiven the opportunity to cure any defect in a timely manner;  \n7.  Take all appropriate actions to upgrade electronic voter registration systems so they can \nprocess the anticipated elevated number of online registrations and absentee ballot \nrequests;  \n8.  Take all appropriate actions to coordinate with, and ensure that municipalities coordinate \nwith, the United States Postal Service to ensure the timely delivery and return of, and \ncounting of, absentee ballots;  \n9.  Ensure that secure drop boxes for in-person return of absentee ballots are available to \nevery voter and increase in-person absentee voting opportunities that are safe and \naccessible, including, for instance, drive-through voting; and \n10. Engage in a public education campaign to apprise the public on: how to request, vote, and \nreturn absentee ballots; the locations and times for in-person absentee voting; all early \nvoting opportunities in each community; the provisions being made for safe in-person \nvoting; and any changes in election day polling locations. \n66 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 41   Filed: 06/24/20   Page 78 of 79\n \nDated:  June 24, 2020  Rachel E.

While the Commissioners and Administrator of the \nWisconsin Election Commission (“WEC”) oppose the motions only to the extent the \nrequested relief would exceed the WEC’s statutory authority, the Wisconsin Legislature, \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 3 of 69\nthe  Republican  National  Committee  and  the  Republican  Party  of  Wisconsin  have \nintervened to offer a more robust opposition to those motions.1  In addition to these \npending motions for preliminary injunction, defendants and intervening defendants have \nalso moved to dismiss three of the four cases.   \nFor the reasons that follow, the court will largely reject defendants’ grounds to \ndismiss.  As for the requests for preliminary relief, election workers’ and voters’ experiences \nduring Wisconsin’s primary election in April, which took place at the outset of the COVID-\n19 crisis, have convinced the court that some, limited relief from statutory deadlines for \nmail-in  registration  and  absentee  voting  is  again  necessary  to  avoid  an  untenable \nimpingement  on  Wisconsin  citizens’  right  to  vote,  including  the  near  certainty  of \ndisenfranchising tens of thousands of voters relying on the state’s absentee ballot process.  \nIndeed, any objective view of the record before this court leads to the inevitable conclusion \nthat: (1) an unprecedented number of absentee ballots, which turned the predominance of \nin-person voting on its head in April, will again overwhelm the WEC and local officials \ndespite their best efforts to prepare; (2) but for an extension of the deadlines for registering \nto vote electronically and for receipt of absentee ballots, tens of thousands of Wisconsin \nvoters would have been disenfranchised in April; and (3) absent similar relief, will be again \nin November.  Consistent with the fully briefed motions, evidence presented, and the \nhearing held on August 5, 2020, therefore, the court will grant in part and deny in part the \n \n1 In the Edwards case, the Wisconsin State Assembly, Senate and members of the Wisconsin \nLegislature were also named as direct defendants along with the WEC Commissioners. \n \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 4 of 69\nparties’ motions for reasons more fully explained below, including entering a preliminary \ninjunction providing the following relief:   \n•  extending the deadline under Wisconsin Statute § 6.28(1), for online and mail-\nin registration from October 14, to October 21, 2020;  \n•  directing the WEC to include on the MyVote and WisVote websites (and on \nany  additional  materials  that  may  be  printed  explaining  the  “indefinitely \nconfined” option) the language provided in their March 2020 guidance, which \nexplains that the indefinitely confined exception “does not require permanent \nor total inability to travel outside of the residence”;  \n•  extending the receipt deadline for absentee ballots under Wisconsin Statute § \n6.87(6) until November 9, 2020, but requiring that the ballots be mailed and \npostmarked on or before election day, November 3, 2020;  \n•  enjoining Wisconsin Statute § 6.87(3)(a), which limits delivery of absentee \nballots  to  mail  only  for  domestic  civilian  voters,  allowing  online  access  to \nreplacement absentee ballots or emailing replacement ballots for the period from \nOctober 22 to October 29, 2020, as to those voters who timely requested an \nabsentee ballot, the request was approved, and the ballot was mailed, but the \nvoter did not receive the ballot; and  \n•  enjoining Wisconsin Statute § 7.30(2), which requires that each election official \nbe an elector of the county in which the municipality is located, allowing election \nofficials to be residents of other counties within Wisconsin for the upcoming \nNovember 2020 election. \nIn recognition of the likelihood of appellate review, however, this order is STAYED for one \nweek, and NO voter can depend on any extension of deadlines for electronic and mail-in \nregistration and for receipt of absentee ballots unless finally upheld on appeal.  In the \nmeantime, lest they effectively lose their right to do so by the vagaries of COVID-19, mail \nprocessing or other, unforeseen developments leading up to the November election, the \ncourt joins the WEC in urging especially new Wisconsin voters to register by mail on or \nbefore October 14, 2020, and all voters to do so by absentee ballot as soon as possible.2  \n \n2 In a vain effort (in both senses of that word) at forestalling the inevitable judge-appointment and \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 5 of 69\nFACTS \nA. Election Laws in Wisconsin \n1.  Registering to vote \nA citizen wishing to vote in Wisconsin must first register in the ward or district in \nwhich they reside.  To do so, the voter must complete a registration form and provide “an \nidentifying document that establishes proof of residence.”3  Wis. Stat. § 6.34(2).  The \ndeadline for registering by mail or online is the third Wednesday preceding the election, \nWis. Stat. § 6.28, which for the upcoming November 2020 election is October 14, 2020.  \nA voter may also register in person at their local municipal clerk’s office up to the Friday \nbefore the election, Wis. Stat. § 6.29(1)-(2), which for the November election is October \n30.  Finally, a voter may register in person on election day itself at their designated polling \nplace.  Wis. Stat. § 6.55(2).  \n2.  Voting by mail \nAbsentee voting in Wisconsin is available to any registered voter who “for any \nreason is unable or unwilling to appear” at the polls.  Wis. Stat. § 6.85.  To obtain an \n \nbias dialogue so prevalent in what remains of the independent press, among commentators and on \nthe internet, let me stress, as I did with the parties during the August hearing, the limited relief \nawarded today is without regard to (or even knowledge of) who may be helped, except the average \nWisconsin voter, be they party-affiliated or independent.  Having grown up in Northern Wisconsin \nwith friends across the political spectrum (and in some cases back again), my only interest, as it \nshould be for all citizens, is ensuring a fair election by giving the overtaxed, small WEC staff and \nlocal election officials what flexibility the law allows to vindicate the right to vote during a \npandemic. \n3 Military and overseas voters are exempt from this proof of residence requirement.  Wis. Stat. \n§ 6.34(2).  Also, proof of residence is not required if the voter registers online and provides the \nnumber of a current and valid Wisconsin operator’s license or state ID card, together with his or \nher name and date of birth, provided this information is verified.  Wis. Stat. § 6.34(2m). \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 6 of 69\nabsentee ballot, a registered voter must submit an absentee ballot request form, along with \na copy of an acceptable photo ID.  Wis. Stat. § 6.86.4  Voters who are “indefinitely confined \nbecause of age, physical illness or infirmity” are exempt from this photo ID requirement, \nbut such a voter must still provide a signed statement by the individual who witnesses and \ncertifies  the  voter’s  ballot  “in  lieu  of  providing  proof  of  identification.”    Wis.  Stat. \n§ 6.87(4)(b)2.   \nOn March 29, 2020, the WEC issued guidance on the proper use of indefinitely \nconfined status, explaining that:  “Designation of indefinitely confined status is for each \nindividual voter to make based upon their current circumstances. It does not require \npermanent or total inability to travel outside of the residence.”  Wisconsin Election \nCommission,  Guidance  for  Indefinitely  Confined  Electors  COVID-19  (Mar.  29,  2020), \nhttps://elections.wi.gov/node/6788.  Two days later, the Wisconsin Supreme Court issued \na decision that preliminarily endorsed the WEC guidance, finding that it “provides the \nclarification on the purpose and proper use of the indefinitely confined status that is \nrequired at this time.”  Jefferson v. Dane Cty, No. 2020AP557-OA (Wis. Mar. 31, 2020).5 \nWhether submitted online, by fax or by mail, an absentee ballot application must \n \n4 For certain voters without an acceptable photo ID, there is also an “ID Petition Process” that has \nbeen the subject of substantial litigation unrelated to the current pandemic.  See Luft v. Evers, 963 \nF.3d 665, 678 (7th Cir. 2020). \n \n5 However, litigation on that issue is ongoing, with oral argument before the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt scheduled for September 29, 2020.  See Wis. Supreme Court Pending Cases (last accessed \nSept.  3,  2020), \nhttps://www.wicourts.gov/sc/sccase/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&seqNo=285226. Because \nall of the issues certified for review by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in Jefferson relate exclusively \nto Wisconsin law, none overlap or conflict with the federal constitutional and statutory claims at \nissue in the instant case. \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 7 of 69\nbe received no later than 5 p.m. on the fifth day immediately preceding the election, Wis. \nStat. § 6.86(1)(ac), (b), which means for the November election on or before 5 p.m. on \nOctober 29, 2020.  Clerks must begin to send out absentee ballots no later than the 47th \nday before a general election, at which point the absentee ballot itself must be mailed to a \nqualified voter within one business day of the receipt of an absentee ballot request.  Wis. \nStat. § 7.15(1)(cm).   \nIf a clerk is “reliably informed” that the absentee requester is a military or overseas \nvoter, the clerk may also fax or transmit an electronic copy of the ballot in lieu of mailing \nit.  Wis. Stat. § 6.87(3)(d).  Indeed, up until very recently, due to a 2016 injunction by \nthis court, clerks had the discretion to email ballots to all voters.  See One Wisconsin Inst., \nInc. v. Thomsen, 198 F. Supp. 3d 896, 946-48 (W.D. Wis. 2016) (enjoining “the provision \nprohibiting municipal clerks from sending absentee ballots by fax or email [because it] \nviolates the First and Fourteenth Amendments”).  On June 29, 2020, however, the Seventh \nCircuit vacated this injunction, meaning that non-military/overseas voters may now receive \nan absentee ballot only by mail.  See Luft v. Evers, 963 F.3d 665, 676-77 (7th Cir. 2020). \nOnce received, to cast an absentee ballot by mail, the voter must (1) complete the \nballot in the presence of a witness, (2) enclose the ballot in the envelope provided, (3) sign \nthe envelope and obtain a signature from the witness and (4) return the ballot for actual \nreceipt no later than 8 p.m. on election day.  Wis. Stat. § 6.87(2), (4)(b), (6).  In light of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, the WEC further issued guidance on March 29, suggesting \nseveral options for voters to meet the witness signature requirement safely.  See WEC, \n“Absentee  Witness  Signature  Requirement  Guidance”  (Mar.  29,  2020), \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 8 of 69\nhttps://elections.wi.gov/node/6790.  This guide outlines a multi-step process to acquire a \nsignature while observing social distancing and other best health practices.  Id.  For \nexample, the guide suggests that a voter could recruit a friend or neighbor to watch the \nvoter mark their ballot through a window or over video chat, with the voter then placing \nthe ballot outside for the witness to sign as well.  Id.  To return an absentee ballot, a voter \nmay then mail it, hand deliver it to the clerk’s office or other designated site, or bring it to \ntheir polling place on election day.  Some, though not all, localities also offer absentee \nballot “drop boxes.”  See WEC, “Absentee Ballot Return Options - COVID-19” (Mar. 31, \n2020), https://elections.wi.gov/node/6798.  In that instance, another person may deliver \nthe ballot on behalf of the voter.  Id.  Finally, “[i]f a municipal clerk receives an absentee \nballot with an improperly completed certificate or with no certificate, the clerk may return \nthe ballot to the elector . . . whenever time permits the elector to correct the defect and \nreturn the ballot.”  Wis. Stat. § 6.87(9).6   \n3.  Voting in person \nA registered voter may also vote absentee in-person, by simultaneously requesting \nand casting an absentee ballot at the clerk’s office or other designated location beginning \ntwo weeks before election day through the Sunday preceding that election, in this election \nmeaning Sunday, November 1.  Wis. Stat. §§ 6.85(1)(a)2, 6.855, 6.86(1)(b).  Once an \nabsentee ballot is received by a clerk, the ballot is sealed in a carrier envelope until election \n \n6 Wisconsin law also permits a voter to receive up to three replacement ballots if they spoil or \nerroneously prepare their ballot, provided they return the defective ballot.  Wis. Stat. §§ 6.80(2)(c), \n6.86(5). \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 9 of 69\nday, at which point the ballots are canvassed like any other absentee ballot.  Wis. Stat. §§ \n6.88, 7.51-52. \nOf course, on election day, a voter may cast a regular ballot in person at their \ndesignated, local polling station.  See Wis. Stat. §§ 6.77, 6.79.  These polls are staffed by \nvarious election officials and poll workers, all of whom are required by Wisconsin law to \nbe “qualified elector[s] of a county in which the municipality where the official serves is \nlocated.”  Wis. Stat. § 7.30(2)(a).  As noted above, Wisconsin also offers same-day \nregistration, so an unregistered voter or a voter who needs to change their registration may \narrive, register and cast a ballot at the polls in person, all on election day.  Wis. Stat. \n§ 6.55(2).   \nHistorically, Wisconsin voters have relied heavily on this election day registration \nprocess.  For example, between 2008 and 2016, 10 to 15% of all registrations took place \non election day.  As Administrator Wolfe testified, Wisconsin has a “cultural tradition” of \nsame-day registration, with approximately 80% of voter records having been impacted in \nsome way by same-day registration.  (8/5/20 Hr’g Tr. (dkt. #532) 57-58.)7 \nB. The COVID-19 Pandemic’s Impacts on Wisconsin’s April and August \nElections \n1.  Growing problem and related litigation \nSince early 2020, Wisconsin and most of the rest of the world has been impacted \n \n7 Unless otherwise noted, the docket entries are to the 20-cv-249 docket. \n \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 10 of 69\nto varying degrees by the novel coronavirus.8  On February 6, the first case of COVID-19 \nwas diagnosed in Wisconsin, and as of September 17, 94,746 confirmed cases have been \nrecorded in the state.  Much is still unknown about the virus and the COVID-19 illness \nthat it causes, but experts appear to agree that COVID-19 is mainly spread via person-to-\nperson, respiratory droplets, and it is more likely to spread between people who are in close \ncontact with one another for a sustained period.  A person may also become infected by \n“touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own nose, \nmouth, or possibly their eyes.”  (Edwards Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #417) ¶ 27 (quoting Goode \nDecl., Ex. I (CDC, Targeting COVID-19’s Spread) (dkt. #415-9).)  Certain individuals, \nsuch as those who are elderly, immunocompromised or suffer comorbidities, are at a greater \nrisk for complications from COVID-19. \nAs the virus first started to spread in Wisconsin in February and March, even greater \nuncertainty surrounded the extent, seriousness and nature of COVID-19.  By March 12, \nGovernor Evers had issued a statewide health emergency; and on March 24, the Secretary \nof Wisconsin’s Department of Health Services had issued a “Safer at Home” order, which \nbanned all public and private gatherings, closed nonessential businesses, and required that \neveryone maintain social distancing of at least six feet from any other person. \nObviously, all this occurred within just a few weeks of Wisconsin’s April 7, 2020, \nprimary election.  In mid-March, certain WEC Commissioners began expressing concern \nabout the state’s ability to conduct a fair and safe election; local clerks reported that they \n \n8 Technically, SARS-CoV-2 is the name of what has become known as the “coronavirus,” while \nCOVID-19 is the name of the illness caused by that virus. \n \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 11 of 69\nwere running out of absentee ballot materials and felt overwhelmed by the volume of \nabsentee ballot requests; and various mayors urged that the election be delayed.  Between \nMarch 18 and March 26, three lawsuits were also filed with this court requesting various \nrelief relating to Wisconsin’s impending primary election. \nShortly  after,  this  court  granted  the  following  narrow,  preliminary  relief:    (1) \nextending the online registration deadline by 12 days to March 30; (2) extending by one \nday the window to request an absentee ballot; (3) adjusting the witness certification \nrequirement under Wis. Stat. § 6.87(2); and (4) extending the absentee ballot receipt \ndeadline by six days to April 13 at 4 p.m.  See Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann, No. \n20-cv-249 (W.D. Wis. Mar. 20, 2020); Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann, No. 20-cv-\n249 (W.D. Wis. April 2, 2020).  Most of this relief was challenged by emergency appeal \nto the Seventh Circuit (extension of the registration deadline being the exception).  That \ncourt declined to stay relief granted as to the extension of absentee-ballot-requests and \nreceipt deadlines by mail, but granted a stay as to the adjustment to the witness signature \nrequirement.  Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann, Nos. 20-1538, -1546, -1545, at * 3-4 \n(7th Cir. April 3, 2020).  A further, emergency appeal was accepted by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, which sought a stay of this court’s injunction only to the extent that it permitted \nballots postmarked after election day (April 7) to be counted if actually received by April \n13.  Brief of Petitioner, Republican Nat’l Comm. v. Democratic Nat’l Comm., 589 U. S. ____ \n(2020) (No. ___ ).  The Supreme Court granted the stay, ordering that a voter’s absentee \nballot must be either postmarked by election day and received by April 13 or hand-\ndelivered by election day.  Republican Nat’l Comm. v. Democratic Nat’l Comm., 589 U.S. ____ \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 12 of 69\n(2020) (per curiam).   \n2.  Effort to fulfill absentee ballot applications \nMeanwhile, the WEC and local clerks were undertaking admirable (and in some \ncases, heroic) efforts to administer absentee voting and prepare the polls for in-person \nvoting on April 7 in the midst of the pandemic.  Despite these efforts, unprecedented \nchallenges confronted clerks and poll workers before and on election day.  To begin, clerks \nreceived a flood of absentee ballot requests, ultimately receiving a total of 1,282,762 \nabsentee ballot applications.9  A post-election report by the WEC explained that some \ninadequately staffed offices were “nearly overwhelmed” by this number of applications.  \n(Swenson Pls.’ PFOFs (’459, dkt. #42) ¶ 56 (citing Goodman Decl., Ex. 18 (WEC May 20 \nMeeting Materials) (’459 dkt. #43-18) 6).)  At one point, clerks even ran out of absentee \ncertificate  envelopes,  although  this  shortage  was  ultimately  rectified.    Plaintiffs  have \nproduced numerous declarations from voters who testified that they timely -- often two or \nthree weeks before the election -- requested an absentee ballot but never received it or \nreceived it after election day; some of these voters chose to vote in person, but others were \nunwilling or unable to go to the polls due to safety concerns with COVID-19, long lines or \nother problems.  (See Swenson Pls.’ PFOFs (’459, dkt. #42) ¶¶ 51, 164, 176 (citing \ndeclarations); DNC Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #419) ¶ 73 (citing declarations); Edwards Pls.’ \nPFOFs (dkt. #417) ¶¶ 67-162, 177-81) (citing declarations); Gear Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #422) \n¶¶ 37, 43, 81, 157-677 (citing declarations).)   \n \n9 In comparison, only 167,832 absentee ballots were sent in the April 2019 election. \n \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 13 of 69\nMoreover, between April 3 and April 6 (the day before the election), local officials \nwere still in the process of mailing more than 92,000 absentee ballots to voters, virtually \nall of which the WEC acknowledges were sent too late to be filled out and mailed back by \nelection day.10  On top of this group, data from the WEC as of April 7 indicates that at \nleast an additional 9,388 ballots were applied for timely but were never even sent out.  The \nWEC advises that due to a reporting lag this number was lower, but does not indicate by \nhow much. \nAt least some of these problems were rooted in mail delivery issues, which led to \nsome absentee ballots reaching voters or clerks late or not at all.  For example, a WEC staff \nmember received a call from a United States Postal Service (“USPS”) official in Chicago \non April 8, who reported that “three tubs” of absentee ballots from the Appleton/Oshkosh \narea had been found undelivered in a post office in Chicago, although the Legislative \ndefendants and the RNC/RPC point out that these tubs were dropped off at USPS at the \nend of the day on April 7 (see Leg. Defs.’ & RNC/RPW Resp. to DNC Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. \n#450)  ¶  84).    Similarly,  in  Fox  Point,  a  bin  containing  about  175  unopened  and \nundelivered ballots was inexplicably returned to the clerk’s office on the morning of \nelection day. \nVoters also reported problems with satisfying the requirements for requesting and \n \n10 Administrator Wolfe testified that it may take 14 days for an absentee ballot to make its way \nthrough the mail from a clerk’s office to a voter and back again, and even under ideal conditions \nwith a two-day first class mail delivery time, a mailed ballot would take at least four to six days to \nturn around.  (Swenson Pls.’ Supp. PFOFs (dkt. #494) ¶ 62 (citing Wolfe Dep. (dkt. #247) 51:1-\n21).) \n \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 14 of 69\ncasting their absentee ballots.  For example, some voters testified that they had difficulties \nuploading their photo ID to the online system or otherwise providing the required ID \nneeded to request an absentee ballot.11  (DNC Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #419) ¶ 68 (citing \ndeclarations).)   \n3.  Efforts to count absentee ballots \nFurther, while the WEC issued guidance regarding the safe execution of the witness \nsignature requirement before voting and returning an absentee ballot itself, plaintiffs’ \nexpert opined that this complicated advice was not easy to follow.  (Swenson Pls.’ PFOFs \n(‘459, dkt. #42) ¶ 81 (citing Remington Expert Report (’459 dkt. #44)).)  For example, \nplaintiff Jill Swenson testified that she spent two weeks trying to find someone to witness \nher ballot in a safe manner, ultimately to no avail.  (See Swenson Decl. (’459 dkt. #47) ¶¶ \n11-13.)  Relying on this court’s preliminary injunction modifying the witness signature \nrequirement in light of such issues, Swenson eventually mailed her ballot without a witness \nsignature, only to find out later that this court’s order was stayed on appeal.  (Id.)  Other \nvoters also testified that they did not cast their absentee ballot, or they cast their ballot \nwithout the proper certification, due to COVID-19-related safety concerns regarding the \nwitness requirement.  (See DNC Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #419) ¶¶ 157-60 (citing declarations).)12  \nIn addition, although many ballots arrived with no postmarks, two postmarks or unclear \n \n11 Defendants do not dispute that some voters testified to difficulties with uploading their photo ID \nto the online system (or could otherwise not provide the required ID needed to request an absentee \nballot), but as discussed further in the opinion below, none of the declarations persuasively establish \nthat the ID requirement was or will be difficult to satisfy for most desiring to vote absentee. \n \n12 As was conceded in the hearing, none of the plaintiffs produced any evidence of a voter who was \nultimately unable to meet the proof of residence requirement. \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 15 of 69\npostmarks, on this issue, the guidance issued by the WEC simply left it up to each \nmunicipality to determine whether a ballot was timely. \nIn the end, 120,989 voters who requested absentee ballots did not return them as \nof election day, although what portion of these voters ended up voting in-person on \nelection day or why they did not is unknown.  Even for those absentee ballots that did \nreach clerks’ offices, more than 14,000 ballots were rejected due to an “insufficient” witness \ncertification and “thousands” were rejected for other reasons.  (Swenson Pls.’ PFOFs (’459, \ndkt. #42) ¶ 90.)  However, the WEC maintains that “the final election data conclusively \nindicate[d] that the election did not produce an unusual number [of] unreturned or \nrejected [absentee] ballots,” adjusting for the larger number of absentee votes submitted.  \n(WEC Resp. to Swenson Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #439) ¶ 74.)   \nAll told, absentee ballots represented 73.8% of all ballots counted.  Approximately \n61.8% of absentee ballots were mailed in, while the remaining 12% were cast in-person \nabsentee  or  hand-delivered,  meaning  only  roughly  26.2%  were  cast  on  election  day.  \nAbsentee votes never comprised more 20% of all ballots in recent past elections, and often, \nthey represented less than 10% of ballots cast.  The WEC itself stated in a report that the \nincrease in absentee voting “created resource issues for a system primarily designed to \nsupport polling place voting.”  (Swenson Pls.’ PFOFs (’459, dkt. #42) ¶ 50 (quoting \nGoodman Decl., Ex. 18 (WEC May 20 Meeting Materials) (’459, dkt. #43-18) 19-21).) \n4.  Election day voting \nAs for voting on the actual election day itself, April 7, 2020, severe shortages of poll \nworkers caused significant problems in some jurisdictions.  In particular, because of the age \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 16 of 69\nand health concerns of poll workers who declined to volunteer, Milwaukee was only able \nto open five of its usual 180 polling sites, and Green Bay reduced its usual 31 polling sites \nto just two.  In part due to this consolidation, some individuals had to wait in long lines, \nsometimes for hours before being allowed to vote.  While Governor Evers authorized the \nWisconsin National Guard to serve as poll workers, he only did so on April 2, less than \none week before the election.  In addition, while the WEC was able to send sanitation and \npersonal protective equipment (“PPE”) to all polling sites, some supplies were limited or \ninadequate.  Some poll workers even reported that they had to rely on vodka as a sanitizer.  \nMoreover, the WEC did not issue any particular mandate requiring specific public health \nmeasures to be taken by clerks or poll workers.  Finally, voters and poll workers reported \nvarious perceived safety problems, including:  (1) cramped polling locations that made it \ndifficult to maintain social distancing; (2) no enforcement of social distancing by poll \nworkers; (3) a lack of or improper mask-wearing by voters and poll workers; (4) poll \nworkers’ reuse of paper towels to clean voter booths between voters; (5) a lack of sanitized \npens; and (6) poll set-ups requiring poll workers to sit approximately two feet from each \nother. \nPlaintiffs also cite to various declarations to highlight the difficulties faced by some \ncitizens who sought to vote in-person in the April election.  (See DNC Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. \n#419)  ¶¶  62-66  (citing  declarations).)    For  example,  although  Jeannie  Berry-Matos \nrequested and received an absentee ballot, it was for the wrong ward; unable to correct the \nerror in time, she then was forced to vote in person on April 7 at Washington High School \nin Milwaukee.  (DNC Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #419) ¶ 62 (citing Berry-Matos Decl. (dkt. \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 17 of 69\n#263)).)  When Berry-Matos arrived, she found a line stretching several blocks, no \navailable close parking, no poll workers enforcing social distancing, and no way to sanitize \nher pen or her photo ID.  (Id.)  All in all, it took her an hour and thirty-five minutes to \nvote in person.  (Id.)  Other voters who requested but did not receive absentee ballots \nsimilarly showed up at the polls to vote, but concerned about safety and confronted with \nlong lines, they ultimately did not cast their vote.  (DNC Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #419) ¶¶ 63-\n66 (citing Wortham Decl. (dkt. #367); Moore Decl. (dkt. #330); Washington Decl. (dkt. \n#363)); see also Gear Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #422) ¶¶ 236-38, 468-70, 599-602, 627 (citing \ndeclarations).) \nOverall, 1,555,263 votes were cast in the April election.  This court’s injunction \nextending the absentee ballot physical receipt deadline from April 7 to April 13 appears to \nhave resulted in approximately 80,000 ballots being counted that would have otherwise \nbeen rejected as untimely.  (DNC Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #419) ¶ 10.)  In addition, the court’s \ninjunction extending the registration deadline arguably resulted in an estimated 57,187 \nvoters successfully registering in advance.  (Id. ¶ 197.)  Of course, absent the court’s \ninjunction some portion of those voters may have opted to register to vote in person on \nelection day just before voting, rather than sending their absentee ballot by mail. \nPlaintiffs point to expert reports concluding that COVID-19 and its effects reduced \nvoter turnout in the election.  (See Swenson Pls.’ PFOFs (’459 dkt. #41) ¶ 131 (citing \nFowler Expert Report (’459 dkt. #46)); DNC Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #419) ¶ 111 (citing Burden \nDecl. (dkt. #418)).)  Still, 34.3% of eligible voters cast a ballot in the April election; in \ncomparison, the turnout for previous spring primary elections was 27.2% (2019), 22.3% \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 18 of 69\n(2018), 15.9% (2017), 47.4% (2016), 26.1% (2012), and 34.9% (2008).   \n5.  COVID-19 impacts on in-person voting \nAs  for  the  relationship  between  Wisconsin’s  April  election  and  COVID-19 \ntransmission in the state, the parties point to arguably conflicting reports on this subject.  \nPlaintiffs note that a Wisconsin Department of Health Services analysis traced 71 cases of \nCOVID-19 to in-person voting in April.  (Edwards Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #417) ¶ 4; DNC Pls.’ \nPFOFs (dkt. #419) ¶ 6.)  Similarly, expert witness Meagan Murry, M.D., an epidemiologist \nat Harvard School of Public Health, reported “71 confirmed cases of Covid-19 among \npeople who may have been infected during the election.”  (Swenson Pls.’ Supp. PFOFs \n(dkt. #494) ¶ 5 (quoting Murry Decl. (dkt. #370) ¶ 60).)  They also reference a working \npaper, which concludes that in-person voting led to approximately 700 additional COVID-\n19 cases in Wisconsin.  (Edwards Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #417) ¶ 4.)   \nThe Legislative defendants and the RNC/RPW, for their part, point to two reports \nconcluding that the April election was not associated with an increase in COVID-19 \ninfection rates.  (Leg. Defs.’ & RNC/RPC’s Resp. to Swenson Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #451) ¶¶ \n7,  36  (citing  Tseytlin  Decl.,  Exs.  18,  19  (dkt.  ##458-18,  -19).)13    The  Legislative \n \n13 In particular, defendants cite to a report authored in part by two individuals affiliated with the \nWorld Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, \nwhich purported to analyze confirmed COVID-19 cases in the weeks surrounding the April 7 \nelection, and found that the election was not associated with an increase in COVID-19 infection \nrates.  (Tseytlin Decl., Ex. 18 (dkt. #458-18).)  They also cite to a second report authored by \nindividuals affiliated with the Larkin Community Hospitals in Miami, the Department of Math \nand Statistics at the University of South Alabama, and the Froedtert & The Medical College of \nWisconsin in Milwaukee.  (Tseytlin Decl., Ex. 19 (dkt. #458-19).)  This report concluded that:  \n“There was no increase in COVID-19 new case daily rates observed for Wisconsin or its 3 largest \ncounties following the election on April 7, 2020, as compared to the US, during the post-incubation \ninterval period.”  (Id.) \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 19 of 69\ndefendants and the RNC/RPW also point out that the Wisconsin DHS explained that it is \n“not clear how many of the infections may have been caused by the spring election because \nmany of the people had other exposures.”  (Leg. Defs.’ & RNC/RPW’s Resp. to Edwards \nPls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #485) ¶ 3.)  \nAfter the court’s evidentiary hearing in this case, Wisconsin also held another \nprimary election on August 11.  Evidence presented by the parties prior to the election \nsuggested that certain localities again had to consolidate polling locations due to poll \nworker shortages.  For example, Sun Prairie expected to consolidate eight polling places \ndown to one.  The WEC told municipalities “not to plan on” assistance from the National \nGuard (Swenson Supp. Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #494) ¶ 94), but the parties represented that \nGovernor Evers ultimately did deploy the Guard to assist with the election on August 5, \nless than one week before the election.  In the end, both the April and August elections \nsuggest that in-person voting can be conducted safely if the majority of votes are cast in \nadvance, sufficient poll workers, polling places, and PPE are available, and social distancing \nand masking protocols are followed.  Of course, the aged, those with comorbidities or those \nlacking confidence in the ability of local officials and the public to get all those factors right \nare understandably less confident in that assessment. \nC. Plans for the November Election in Light of the Ongoing COVID-19 \nPandemic \nWhile the exact trajectory of COVID-19 in Wisconsin is unknown, the unrebutted \npublic health evidence in the record demonstrates that COVID-19 will continue to persist, \nand may worsen, through November.  Recent outbreaks, particularly among Wisconsin \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 20 of 69\ncollege students, and the onset of flu season continue to complicate assessments.  For \nexample, concern remains that the significant new infections reported on reopened college \ncampuses may spread into the community.  David Wahlberg, UW-Madison threatens ‘more \ndrastic action’ as experts say COVID-19 outbreak impacting broader community, Wis. State \nJournal  (Sept.  16,  2020),  https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/education/university/uw-\nmadison-threatens-more-drastic-action-as-experts-say-covid-19-outbreak-impacting-\nbroader-community/article_dd00c9cc-5dc9-5924-99ca-40c94a0f6738.html.  Indeed, with \nflu season yet to arrive, Wisconsin has already broken numerous new case records this \nmonth, with over 2,000 new cases reported on September 17, 2020, up from a daily average \nof 1,004 just one week prior.  See WPR Staff, Wisconsin Sets New Daily Record with 2,034 \nCoronavirus  Cases  Reported  Thursday,  Wis.  Public  Radio  (Sept.  17,  2020), \nhttps://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-sets-new-daily-record-2-034-coronavirus-cases-reported-\nthursday.    Regardless,  given  the  significantly  higher  voter  turnout  expected  for  the \nNovember election in comparison with April, there is little doubt that the WEC, clerks and \nvoters will again face unique challenges in the upcoming election.  As a result, the WEC is \nalready urging as many people as possible to vote absentee in the hopes of avoiding large \nlines, shortages and attendant health risks on election day. \nMoreover, the evidence suggests that Wisconsin voters will again rely heavily on the \nabsentee voting system for the November election, with the WEC expecting some 1.8 to 2 \nmillion voters to request an absentee ballot, again smashing all records and turning historic \nvoter patterns on their head.  Unfortunately, Madison City Clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl \ntestified that at least her office “has not been given the resources and money necessary to \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 21 of 69\nmeet the anticipated demand for mail-in absentee ballots in November,” and “with other \ndepartments going back to work, [her] staff now only has a few dozen League of Women \nVoters volunteers available to help.”  (Gear Pls.’ Supp. PFOFs (dkt. #506) ¶ 20 (quoting \nWitzel-Behl Decl. (dkt. #382) ¶ 6).)   \nAs previously discussed, the absentee ballot system in Wisconsin is also heavily \nreliant  on  the  USPS,  which  has  and  continues  to  face  its  own  challenges.    WEC \nAdministrator  Wolfe  in  particular  acknowledged  “significant  concerns  about  the \nperformance of the postal service in connection with the April 7 election.”  (DNC Pls.’ \nPFOFs (dkt. #419) ¶¶ 140, 142 (quoting Wolfe Dep. (dkt. #247) 89:10-15).)  In addition, \na report by the USPS Inspector General’s Office found that voters requesting ballots five \ndays before the election -- the deadline set by Wisconsin statutes -- face a “high risk” that \ntheir ballot will not be delivered, completed and returned in time to be counted.  (Swenson \nPls.’ Supp. PFOFs (dkt. #494) ¶ 61 (quoting Second Goodman Decl., Ex. 17 (Timeliness \nof Ballot Mail) (dkt. #495-17) 6-7).)  USPS also faces budget shortfalls, as well as \nchallenges  caused  by  increasing  COVID-19  rates  among  postal  workers  themselves.  \nMoreover, just a few weeks ago, the new Postmaster General established “major operational \nchanges . . . that could slow down mail delivery,” including restricting the ability for USPS \nemployees to work overtime.  (DNC Pls.’ Supp. PFOFs (dkt. #501) ¶¶ 7-8.) \nAs to fulfilling the witness signature requirement, over 600,000 Wisconsinites live \nalone and even more live with an individual who is unqualified to be a witness.  Prospective \nabsentee voters in that situation will need to find someone outside of their household to \nwitness their ballot before returning it.  According to plaintiffs’ expert, a “significant” \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 22 of 69\nportion of voters who do not live with a qualified witness are senior citizens, who also face \nspecial risks of complications from COVID-19.  (DNC Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #419) ¶ 153 \n(citing Fowler Rep. (’459 dkt. #46) 12-13).)  Relatedly, another expert produced by \nplaintiffs opined that the WEC’s guidance on the witness signature requirement “may be \ndifficult to understand by the homebound individual and witness” and “may be impractical \nin certain situations, such as for persons living in multi-level or multi-unit apartment \ncomplexes.”  (Swenson Pls.’ PFOFs (’459 dkt. #42) ¶ 81 (citing Remington Rep. (’459 dkt. \n#44)).)  That being said, notwithstanding a few, individual affiants who had experienced \ndifficulties securing a witness signature requirement or submitting proof of ID for the April \nelection, the Legislature points out that plaintiffs produced no evidence of voters who are \nstill unable to meet the challenged requirements for November.14 \nIn-person voting in November is also likely to be strained by a shortage of poll \nworkers, despite more time to plan for that shortage than was available for the spring \nelection.  On the one hand, Milwaukee officials testified that they hope to be able to open \nall 180 polling sites (up from five in April), and Green Bay expects to have at least 13 \npolling locations (up from two in April).  On the other hand, clerks are still reporting poll \nworker shortages for November.  Similarly, WEC Administrator Wolfe testified that \n \n14 The DNC plaintiffs also contend that:  “many workplaces, public libraries, and copy shops may \nremain or become closed given the pandemic’s acceleration in the U.S., many voters will continue \nto face substantial burdens in obtaining the copies or scans they need to complete their absentee \nballot applications and will continue to be prevented from voting.  In addition, even if those \nestablishments were open, many voters are fearful of leaving their homes because of the health risks \nof the coronavirus pandemic and the restrictions imposed under their respective County’s health \norders.”  (DNC Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #419) ¶ 164.)  Again, however, the only evidence they cite in \nsupport is voter declarations expressing fear of in-person voting due to COVID-19, rather than a \npersonal inability to arrange an effective witnessing of their ballot. \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 23 of 69\n“despite the advance warning [and] the greater time to plan for people who will opt-out \nbecause of COVID-19 risks, local municipalities are still having problems filling all their \npolling stations.”  (8/5/20 Hr’g Tr. (dkt. #532) 82.)  Because of this, Wolfe explained a \nlack of poll workers was the thing she “worr[ies] about the most” for the upcoming \nNovember election.  (Id. at 83.) \nMore  fundamentally,  plaintiffs  have  produced  a  credible  expert  report  that \nconcludes in-person voting in November will continue to pose “a significant risk to human \nhealth” due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  (Swenson Pls.’ PFOFs (’459 dkt. #42) ¶ 7 (citing \nRemington Expert Report (’459 dkt. #44)).)  While not disputing this risk, the WEC \ncounters with the general observation  that the risk of transmission is “greatly reduced” if \npeople are wearing masks and practicing social distancing.  (WEC Resp. to Swenson Pls.’ \nPFOFs (dkt. #439) ¶ 7.)  The Legislative defendants and the RNC/RPC further dispute \nany suggestion that in-person voting in November will be unsafe, again pointing to the two \nstudies concluding that the April election was not associated with an increase in COVID-\n19 infection rates.  (See (Leg. & RNC/RPW’s Resp. to Swenson Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #451) \n¶¶ 7, 36 (citing Tseytlin Decl., Ex. 18, 19 (dkt. ##458-18, -19)).)  At minimum, the \nevidence continues to suggest that a large election day turnout will stretch safety protocols \nand increase risk of transmission particularly to poll workers, which is why the WEC has \ncontinued to promote voting by mail. \nRegardless of the objective risks, plaintiffs have also produced declarations from \nvarious voters who aver that if unable to vote by mail, they will not vote in-person in \nNovember.  (See Gear Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #422) ¶¶ 186, 215, 279, 323, 355, 387, 407 (citing \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 24 of 69\nvarious voter declarations).)  Others declare that they intend to vote by mail in November, \nbut would like a “back-up” option, because of their previous personal experiences in not \nreceiving an absentee ballot for the April election despite requesting it timely.  (See id. ¶¶ \n445, 474, 501, 576, 633, 669 (citing various voter declarations).) \nIn preparation for these anticipated challenges in administering the November \nelection, the WEC has taken a number of steps.  Of particular note, the WEC mailed \nabsentee ballot applications to nearly all registered voters.  The application itself contains \nan information sheet, which among other things generally describes the “indefinitely \nconfined” exception to the photo ID requirement, but does not indicate what constitutes \n“indefinitely confined” under Wisconsin law.  Instead, the instructions warn a prospective \nvoter may be fined $1,000 or imprisoned up to 6 months for falsely asserting that they are \nindefinitely confined.  This mailer went out on September 1st. \nIn addition to encouraging Wisconsinites to vote absentee, the WEC has also:  (1) \ndirected staff to spend federal CARES Act grant money to distribute sanitation supplies to \nall 72 counties in Wisconsin; (2) planned to implement intelligent mail barcodes (“IMB”) \nto facilitate more detailed absentee-ballot tracking; (3) planned to spend up to $4.1 million \non a CARES Act sub-grant to local election officials to help pay for increased elections costs \ncaused by the pandemic; (4) made upgrades to the MyVote website; (5) issued guidance \nto local officials about providing drop boxes for the safe and easy return of absentee ballots; \n(6) made CARES Act subgrant money available for the purchase of additional, absentee \nballot drop boxes; (7) urged localities to solicit election inspectors, create recruitment tools \nfor local officials, and promote the need for poll workers; (8) produced content to educate \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 25 of 69\nvoters on “unfamiliar aspects of voting” for use by local election officials, voter groups, and \nthe public; (9) worked with public health officials to produce public health guidance \ndocuments for clerks, poll workers, and the public; and (10) developed a webinar series for \nlocal officials to provide training on election procedures, including COVID-19-specific \ntraining.  Just as in April, what the WEC has not done is ease any of the statutory deadlines, \nhaving again concluded on a 3-3 vote that it lacks the authority to do so even in the face \nof the anticipated effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nOPINION \nI.  Motions to Dismiss \nAs an initial matter, the court will address certain issues raised in defendants’ \npending motions to dismiss, considering first various jurisdictional challenges and then \narguments that some of plaintiffs’ claims must be dismissed for failure to state a claim on \nwhich relief may be granted. 15 \n \n15 Specifically, the WEC moved to dismiss the Swenson plaintiffs’ complaint (see WEC’s Mot. to \nDismiss (’340, dkt. #14)), and the Legislative defendants moved to dismiss the Gear, Edwards and \nSwenson plaintiffs’ operative complaints (see Leg. Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss Gear Compl. (’278 dkt. \n#382); Leg. Defs.’ Mot to Dismiss Edwards Compl. (’340 dkt. #12); Leg. Defs.’ Mot to Dismiss \nSwenson Compl. (’459 dkt. ##27, 272)).  Although the WEC also initially moved to dismiss the \nGear plaintiffs’ original complaint, after the Gear plaintiffs’ filed a proposed, first amended \ncomplaint, plaintiffs filed a joint stipulation with the WEC, which withdrew the WEC’s pending \nmotion to dismiss the first amended complaint, while reserving its right to answer, move or \notherwise plead in response to the second amended complaint.  (Joint Stipulation (dkt. #230).)  \nFinally, although the Legislative defendants did not formally move to dismiss the DNC plaintiffs’ \nsecond amended complaint (the court having previously denied their motion to dismiss the DNC \nplaintiffs’ first amended complaint (6/10/20 Op. & Order (dkt. #217)), they argued in their briefing \nthat “especially after Luft, the DNC Second Amended Complaint must be dismissed for many of \nthe same reasons supporting dismissal of the operative complaints in Gear and Swenson.”  (Leg. \nDefs.’ Omnibus Br. (dkt. #454) 5 n.3.) \n25 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 26 of 69\nA. Jurisdictional Challenges \nIn evaluating challenges to its subject matter jurisdiction, this court “must accept as \ntrue all well-pleaded factual allegations and draw reasonable inferences in favor of the \nplaintiff.”  Rueth v. EPA, 13 F.3d 227, 229 (7th Cir. 1993) (quoting Capitol Leasing Co. v. \nF.D.I.C., 999 F.2d 188, 191 (7th Cir. 1993)).  Still, the court may “properly look beyond \nthe  jurisdictional  allegations  of  the  complaint  and  view  whatever  evidence  has  been \nsubmitted on the issue to determine whether in fact subject matter jurisdiction exists.”  \nCapitol Leasing Co., 999 F.2d at 191. \nThe WEC argues that no actual controversy exists between that entity and plaintiffs’ \nsince the WEC neither opposes nor supports plaintiffs’ requests for injunctive relief (WEC \nBr. (‘340, dkt. #15) 4-5), and for a case to be justiciable, there must be an actual dispute \nbetween adverse litigants.  (See id. (citing Oneida Tribe of Indians v. Wisconsin, 951 F.2d 757, \n760 (7th Cir. 1991).)  However, as the U.S. Supreme Court held in United States v. Windsor, \n570 U.S. 744 (2013), “even where ‘the Government largely agree[s] with the opposing \nparty on the merits of the controversy,’ there is sufficient adverseness and an ‘adequate \nbasis for jurisdiction in the fact that the Government intended to enforce the challenged \nlaw against that party.’”  Id. at 759 (quoting INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 940 n.12 \n(1983)).  Similarly, in this litigation, the WEC has indicated its intention to enforce \nWisconsin’s current elections laws unless otherwise directed by a state or federal court.  \nThus, regardless of its failure to dispute plaintiffs’ requested relief affirmatively, sufficient \nadverseness exists between the parties to create a justiciable dispute.  Of course, by virtue \nof the intervention by multiple other defendants who are actively disputing plaintiffs’ right \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 27 of 69\nto any of the relief requested, there is little question that there is an actual dispute between \nthe parties needing resolution by this court. \nNext, both the WEC and the Legislative defendants attack plaintiffs’ claims on \nstanding  grounds.    To  establish  standing,  “[t]he  plaintiff  must  have  suffered  or  be \nimminently threatened with a concrete and particularized ‘injury in fact’ that is fairly \ntraceable to the challenged action of the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable \njudicial decision.”  Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 125 \n(2014) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)).  Again, the WEC \nmaintains that it has “no power to enact any changes to the election laws in regard to the \nSpring Election, and it has no authority to change the law relative to the conduct of future \nelections.”  (WEC Br. (‘340, dkt. #15) 6.)  After Windsor, however, this is just the same \n“case or controversy” argument in different clothing, since the WEC’s administration of \nWisconsin’s elections, including the enforcement of its current election laws, is the cause \nof plaintiffs’ alleged injuries.  Moreover, the WEC has the authority to implement a federal \ncourt order relating to election law to redress these alleged injuries.  That the WEC \nmaintains it lacks any independent authority under state law to make the changes requested \nby plaintiffs poses no jurisdictional barrier.  If anything, it demonstrates the WEC is an \nindispensable party for plaintiffs to achieve the remedies they seek. \nRelatedly, the Legislative defendants argue that many of plaintiffs’ claims challenge \nindependent actions of third-parties who were not named as defendants -- specifically, the \nUSPS and local election officials -- and thus plaintiffs’ lack standing to bring those claims.  \n(Leg. Defs.’ Omnibus Br. (dkt. #454) 100.)  Certainly, actions of both the USPS and local \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 28 of 69\nelection officials appear to have contributed and may contribute to plaintiffs’ alleged \ninjuries, and those third-parties may also have some power to redress those injuries, but \nthis does not mean the WEC’s actions or inactions were not also causes of plaintiffs’ \ninjuries.  What matters for standing is that:  (1) defendant’s conduct was one of the multiple \ncauses; and (2) defendant can at least partially redress the wrong.  See WildEarth Guardians \nv. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 795 F.3d 1148, 1157 (9th Cir. 2015) (“So long as a defendant is at \nleast partially causing the alleged injury, a plaintiff may sue that defendant, even if the \ndefendant is just one of multiple causes of the plaintiff's injury.”); Orangeburg v. Fed. Energy \nReg.  Comm’n,  862  F.3d  1071,  1077-84  (D.C.  Cir.  2017)  (“FERC  contends  that  the \ncausation element is not satisfied because Orangeburg’s injury is actually caused by NCUC, \nan absent third party, not the Commission. To be sure, NCUC -- a non-party -- is a key \nplayer in the causal story. But the existence of, perhaps, an equally important player in the \nstory does not erase FERC’s role.”).   \nSimilarly, here, the actions of the USPS and local election officials may be equally \nimportant players in the conduct of the November election but that does not erase the \nWEC’s overall statutory responsibility for the administration of Wisconsin’s elections.  \nWis. Stat. § 5.05(1).  Regardless, it is the WEC’s role and specific authority to promulgate \nrules and guidance to localities in order to implement Wisconsin law (including any court \norder) related to elections and their proper administration under § 5.05(1)(f) that is in \ndispute.  Moreover, should this court enter a binding order, the WEC will be required to \nissue updated rules, procedures, or formal advisory opinions under § 5.05(5t) to ensure its \nimplementation.  This is more than enough to establish standing. \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 29 of 69\nThe Legislative defendants further lodge a narrower standing challenge against just \none of the Swenson plaintiffs’ ADA claims.  (See Leg. Defs.’ Omnibus Br. (dkt. #454) 105-\n08.)  Specifically, they contend the Swenson plaintiffs lack standing to pursue a claim that \nthe WEC’s failure to provide accessible online ballots impermissibly discriminates against \nvoters with vision or other print disabilities because none of the Swenson plaintiffs have \nsuch a disability.  (See id.)  As the Swenson plaintiffs point out, however, they have \nproduced evidence that Disability Rights Wisconsin (one of the named plaintiffs in the \nSwenson complaint) has itself been injured by the alleged violation of the ADA, as it has \nhad to divert its own resources to assist voters with those disabilities to both get access to \nand cast absentee ballots.  (See Swenson Pls.’ Reply (dkt. #493) 21.)  Because Disabilities \nRights Wisconsin has alleged a concrete and particularized injury to its own interests, and \nadvocate for the interests of others with relevant disabilities, the Swenson plaintiffs have \nestablished standing to pursue their claim regarding accessible online ballots.  See Havens \nRealty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 378-80 (1982) (holding that organization that had \nto divert resources to mitigate effects of allegedly discriminatory practices had standing \nbring suit).  \nFinally, the Legislative defendants contend that plaintiffs’ claims are unripe and \nshould be dismissed under the Burford abstention doctrine.  Little time need be spent on \nthese contentions because the court previously addressed nearly identical arguments in an \nearlier opinion and order.  (See 6/10/20 Op. & Order (dkt. #217).)  The court finds no \nreason to depart from its earlier conclusion that plaintiffs’ claims are ripe and fit for judicial \nreview,  presenting  an  “actual  and  concrete  conflict  premised  on  the  near-certain \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 30 of 69\nenforcement of the challenged provisions in the context of the present and ongoing \nCOVID-19  health  care  crisis”  and  because  plaintiffs  are  “likely  to  suffer  adverse \nconsequences if the court were to require a later challenge.”  (Id. at 7-8.)  Further, as \npreviously explained, the Burford abstention doctrine is not applicable to any of the cases \nor controversies before this court because Wisconsin state courts “are not specialized \ntribunals  with  a  special  relationship  with  voting  rights  issues”  and  because  Burford \nabstention is often “inappropriate in federal constitutional challenges to state elections \nlaws.”  (Id. at 17-18.) \nB. Failure to State a Claim \nDismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is proper “when the allegations in a complaint, \nhowever true, could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).  To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must “plead[] \nfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant \nis liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \nCertain of plaintiffs’ claims are plainly barred by immunity doctrines, and thus, fail \nto state a claim.  First, to the extent that any plaintiffs seek money damages pursuant to \n§ 1983, such relief is barred by state sovereign immunity.  See Will v. Mich. Dep’t of State \nPolice,  491  U.S.  58,  64,  66  (1989).    Second,  the  Edwards  plaintiffs’  claims  against \nWisconsin State Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Wisconsin State Senate Majority \nLeader Scott Fitzgerald are foreclosed by the doctrine of legislative immunity, which \nprovides absolute immunity from liability for an official’s legitimate legislative activity.  See \nBogan v. Scott-Harris, 523 U.S. 44, 49 (1998); Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. 367, 376 \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 31 of 69\n(1951).  The  Edwards  plaintiffs’  complaint  faults  Speaker  Vos  and  Majority  Leader \nFitzgerald for failing to take action to postpone the April election or otherwise enact \nmeasures regarding Wisconsin’s elections in the face of the pandemic, but any decision not \nto act qualifies as legislative activity protected by absolute immunity.  See NRP Holdings \nLLC v. City of Buffalo, 916 F.3d 177, 192 (2nd Cir. 2019) (decision not to introduce \nresolutions before city council was protected legislative activity).   \nThe  Edwards  plaintiffs’  only  response  to  defendants’  invocation  of  legislative \nimmunity is to assert without legal authority that it applies only to state law claims.  (See \nEdwards Pls.’ Br. (‘340, dkt. #25) 16.)  To the contrary, the immunity doctrine is a \ncreature of federal common law and applies to federal civil claims.  See Bogan, 523 U.S. at \n48 (explaining that the U.S. Constitution and federal common law “protect[s] legislators \nfrom  liability  for  their  legislative  activities”);  NRP  Holdings  LLC,  916  F.3d  at  190 \n(describing the doctrine of absolute legislative immunity as a matter of common law \ncreated by the U.S. Supreme Court and applicable to federal civil claims). \nOddly,  having  asserted  immunity  on  their  behalf,  the  Legislative  defendants \nnevertheless urge the court to permit Speaker Vos and Majority Leader Fitzgerald to \nremain as parties to defend state law.  (Leg. Defs.’ Br. (‘340, dkt. #13) 30-31.)  In doing \nso, they, too, cite to no legal basis for a defendant to be found immune from suit yet remain \nas a party.  (See id.)  Even if there were some legal basis to allow the defendants to remain, \nthis court has previously held that an individual “legislator’s personal support [of a law he \nor she enacted] does not give him or her an interest sufficient to support intervention.”  See \nOne Wis. Inst., Inc. v. Nichol, 310 F.R.D. 394, 397 (W.D. Wis. 2015) (citing Buquer v. City \n31 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 32 of 69\nof Indianapolis, No. 11–cv–00708, 2013 WL 1332137, at *3 (S.D. Ind. Mar. 28, 2013), \nAm. Ass’n of People With Disabilities v. Herrera, 257 F.R.D. 236, 251 (D.N.M. 2008)).  \nIndeed, to their credit, defendants themselves readily admit that the Edwards plaintiffs \nhave “name[d] the Wisconsin Assembly and the Wisconsin Senate as parties, meaning \nthere  is  no  practical  need  to  retain  Speaker  Vos  and  Majority  Leader  Fitzgerald  as \nadditional named Defendants here.”  (Leg. Defs.’ Br. (‘340, dkt. #13) 31.)  Having been \npresented no legal or practical reason to grant immunity but retain Speaker Vos and \nMajority Leader Fitzgerald as defendants, the court will dismiss them from this case.16 \nII.   Motions for Preliminary Injunction17 \nTo make out a prima facie case for a preliminary injunction, a party must show (1) \n \n16 Defendants also move to dismiss the Edwards plaintiffs’ claim for monetary damages under the \nADA.  A required element of a compensatory damages claim for intentional discrimination under \nTitle II of the ADA is deliberate indifference.  See Lacy v. Cook Cty., Ill., 897 F.3d 847, 862-63 (7th \nCir. 2018).  This requires both “knowledge that a harm to a federally protected right is substantially \nlikely” and “a failure to act upon that likelihood.”  Id. at 863 (quoting S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower \nMerion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d 248, 263 (3d Cir. 2013)). The WEC and Legislative defendants both \nargue that the Edwards plaintiffs do not assert a cognizable claim for ADA damages because they \nfailed to allege deliberate indifference explicitly.  (WEC Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss Br. (’340, dkt. #15) \n8; Leg. Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss Br. (’340, dkt. #14) 24.)  Reading the Edwards plaintiffs’ complaint \nin the light most favorable to them, as this court must at the pleading stage, it is reasonable to infer \nthis claim based on their allegations that defendants have (1) knowledge of the past and planned \nenforcement of Wisconsin’s election laws, as well as the dangers posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, \nand (2) have and are continuing to fail to act on that likelihood.  Thus, plaintiffs have alleged \nsufficient facts to support their implicit claim for deliberate indifference and survive the defendants’ \nmotions to dismiss.  Of course, whether or not there was or is likely to be a violation of the ADA, \nmuch less a deliberate one, remains to be proven.  Finally, as to defendants’ remaining grounds for \ndismissal based on plaintiffs’ failure to plead sufficient allegations to support their claims as a matter \nof law, the court will address these arguments in its substantive consideration of each of plaintiffs’ \nclaims in the discussion that follows. \n \n17 In addition to the parties’ briefs, the court received two amicus briefs from Common Cause (dkt. \n#251) and the American Diabetes Association (’340 dkt. #23). The policy of the Seventh Circuit \nis to “grant permission to file an amicus brief only when:  (1) a party is not adequately represented \n(usually, is not represented at all); or (2) when the would-be amicus has a direct interest in another \n32 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 33 of 69\nirreparable harm, (2) inadequate traditional legal remedies, and (3) some likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits.  Girl Scouts of Manitou Council, Inc. v. Girl Scouts of U.S. of Am., Inc., \n549 F.3d 1079, 1086 (7th Cir. 2008).  If all three threshold requirements are met, the \ncourt must then engage in a balancing analysis, weighing “the harm the plaintiff will suffer \nwithout an injunction against the harm the defendant will suffer with one.”  Harlan v. \nScholz, 866 F.3d 754, 758 (7th Cir. 2017).  The court must also “ask whether the \npreliminary injunction is in the public interest.”  Id.  “The more likely the plaintiff is to \nwin, the less heavily need the balance of harms weigh in his favor; the less likely he is to \nwin, the more need it weigh in his favor.”  Roland Mach. Co. v. Dresser Indus., Inc., 749 F.2d \n380, 387 (7th Cir. 1984). \nA. Anderson-Burdick Analysis \nIn Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983), and Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428 \n(1992), the Supreme Court set forth a balancing test to determine whether an election law \nunconstitutionally burdens a citizen’s right to vote.  Under the Anderson-Burdick test, a \ncourt must weigh “the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights” against \n“the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by \nits rule.”  Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434 (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789).18 \n \ncase, and the case in which he seeks permission to file an amicus curiae brief, may by operation of \nstare decisis or res judicata materially affect that interest; or (3) when the amicus has a unique \nperspective, or information, that can assist the court of appeals beyond what the parties are able to \ndo.”  Nat’l Org. for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 223 F.3d 615, 617 (7th Cir. 2000).  Following that same \npolicy, the court concludes that these parties fall into the latter category, will grant their respective \nmotions, and has considered their proposed briefs. \n18 As a group, plaintiffs also invoke four additional, legal claims:  (1) Title II of the Americans with \n33 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 34 of 69\nThe Seventh Circuit recently applied and elaborated on this merits test in its long-\nawaited decision in Luft v. Evers, 963 F.3d 655, considering a series of challenges to \nWisconsin’s election laws, including some of the provisions at issue in this litigation.  \nFundamentally, the Luft court cautioned that the burden of a specifically challenged \nelection provision must be considered against “the state’s election code as a whole” -- that \nis, by “looking at the whole electoral system,” rather than “evaluat[ing] each clause in \nisolation.”  Id. at 671.  Luft further “stressed” that “Wisconsin’s system as a whole is \naccommodating.”  Id. at 674.  At the same time, the court reaffirmed its earlier holding \nthat “the right to vote is personal” and, therefore, “the state must accommodate voters” \nwho cannot meet the state’s voting requirements “with reasonable effort.”  Id. at 669. \nHaving already addressed at length the scope of the state’s constitutional obligation \nto accommodate voting rights during the COVID-19 pandemic in its April 2, 2020, \ndecision (4/2/20 Op. & Order (dkt. #170) 26-28), which was largely left unchallenged on \nappeal to the Seventh Circuit, Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann, Nos. 20-1538, -1546, \n-1545, (7th Cir. April 3, 2020), and U.S. Supreme Court, Republican Nat’l Comm. v. \nDemocratic Nat’l Comm., 589 U.S. ____ (2020) (per curiam), the court simply adopts it \n \nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132; (2) the Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), procedural \ndue process balancing test; (3) the Equal Protection Clause’s guarantee against arbitrary election \nadministration; and (4) section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act (“VRA”).  The latter three legal \nclaims either prove a poor fit for the relief plaintiffs are seeking, or plaintiffs fail to describe how \nthese standards would advance their claims beyond the Anderson-Burdick test.  Thus, for reasons \naddressed at the close of this opinion, the court concludes that plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate \nany likelihood of success on the merits as to those claims for relief beyond that available under the \nAnderson-Burdick test.  Finally, three of the cases before the court also pursue claims for injunctive \nrelief under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12132.  At the \nhearing, plaintiffs specifically relied on the ADA to advance two of the requests for relief, to enjoin \nor modify the witness signature requirement and to provide an accessible, online absentee ballot.  \nThe court addresses those challenges where relevant below.      \n34 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 35 of 69\nagain by reference.  Instead, in considering plaintiffs’ requests for injunctive relief with \nrespect to the November election, the court will stress the three, core concerns that drives \nits analysis here.   \nFirst, the court is mindful, as it must be, that “[c]ourt orders affecting elections, \nespecially  conflicting  orders,  can  themselves  result  in  voter  confusion,”  and  “[a]s  an \nelection draws closer, that risk will increase.”  Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 4-5 (2006).   \nIn weighing the individual requests for relief, the court must consider the risk that any of \nits actions may create confusion on the part of voters, either directly or indirectly, by \ncreating additional burdens on the WEC and local election officials.  To ameliorate that \nrisk, the court has generally attempted to issue a decision far enough in advance to allow \nan appeal of the court’s decision, provide sufficient time for the WEC and local election \nofficials to implement any modifications to existing election laws, and to communicate \nthose changes to voters.  Issuing the decision now, six weeks out, rather than two weeks as \nin the April election, does not come without its tradeoffs:  the court must make certain, \nreasonable projections about what the pandemic and other events relevant to voting will \nbe like by late October and early November.  Of course, the court would prefer to be \nmaking these decisions with a more complete understanding of the record of voter behavior \nduring that time, but that luxury does not exist.  On the other hand, the court has a much \nbetter understanding of the likely impacts of the pandemic on voting behavior, as well as \nthe State of Wisconsin’s capacity to address them, than it did in March. \n Second, the court will focus solely on how the COVID-19 pandemic presents unique \nchallenges to Wisconsin’s election system and burdens Wisconsin voters.  The court is not \n35 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 36 of 69\ninterested in plaintiffs’ general challenges to Wisconsin elections, because those challenges \nhave now been largely addressed in Luft or, to the extent left open, remain subject to further \nproceedings before Judge Peterson.  On the other hand, the court rejects the Legislature’s \nattempts  to  paint  plaintiffs’  claims  as  purely  facial  challenges,  arguing  that  specific \nindividuals who face insurmountable burdens due to the COVID-19 pandemic could bring \nas-applied challenges for relief at a later date.  Still, recognizing that the line between a \nfacial and an as-applied challenge can be hazy, see Ctr. for Individual Freedom v. Madigan, \n697 F.3d 464, 475 (7th Cir. 2012), plaintiffs’ claims here are only viable to the extent they \nconstitute as-applied challenges and, in particular, are compelling after fairly extrapolating \nfrom relevant voters’ and local election officials’ experiences during the pandemic in April \nto prove near certain burdens in November, particularly with respect to the availability of \nmail-in absentee, early absentee and in-person voting options.   \nTo the extent that  some of the relief requested -- for example, the extension of \ncertain deadlines -- is substantial likely to provide needed relief to Wisconsin voters and \npoll workers burdened by the pandemic’s impact, and even likely to “severely restrict” an \nindividual’s right to vote, the state may still articulate “compelling interests” for the \nchallenged election laws and prove those laws have been “narrowly tailored.”  Luft, 963 \nF.3d at 672.  As to other requested relief, plaintiffs seek “safety nets” to ensure that the \nstate is protecting the “personal” nature of the right to vote.  Frank v. Walker, 819 F.3d \n384, 386 (7th Cir. 2016) (“Frank II”); Luft, 963 F.3d at 677-78 (reaffirming Frank II \nholding that “voting rights are personal,” requiring “that each eligible person must have a \npath to cast a vote”).  Regardless of how it is characterized, the relief requested by plaintiffs \n36 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 37 of 69\nmust be consistent with the Seventh Circuit’s decisions in Luft and Frank II.  The rub, as \ndescribed in detail below, is whether plaintiffs have submitted sufficient evidence from \nwhich this court must conclude that certain individuals are unlikely to be able to exercise \ntheir right to vote despite reasonable effort.  \nThird, while the court will take up each of plaintiffs’ requested items of relief, after \nLuft, the court must consider each request in light of the election system as a whole.  Here, \nthe court principally considers the interplay between the WEC’s, local officials’ and voters’ \nexpressed preference for absentee voting by mail in this election compared to the historic, \noverwhelming preference for in-person voting.  Obviously, ensuring that mail-in, absentee \nvoting is a tenable option for the majority of the electorate who are expected to vote this \nway in November, whether based on the WEC’s  strongly-stated preference or on personal \nrisk assessments, will decrease the number of individuals who will need to vote in-person.  \nIn turn, this will help ensure that there are adequate and safe, in-person voting sites for \nindividuals unable or uninterested in voting by mail, whether because of a personal \npreference to exercise their right to vote in person or because of difficulties in providing \nthe necessary photo ID, obtaining a required witness signature, or negotiating the U.S. \nmail system., Even so,, to the extent the State has had more time to address those issues \nbefore this election and chosen not to address them by virtue of a lack of political will or \nsimple inertia, the court will only grant relief where this failure to act in the face of the \npandemic is substantially likely to severely restrict the right to vote.  \nWith those considerations in mind, the court addresses plaintiffs’ requests for \npreliminary injunctive relief in the following, four categories:  registration, absentee voting, \n37 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 38 of 69\nin-person voting, and miscellaneous relief. \n1.  Registration  \na.  Extending Registration Deadlines \nThe DNC plaintiffs seek an order enjoining Wisconsin Statute § 6.28(1), which \nrequires a mail-in registration to be received by the clerk or postmarked no later than the \nthird  Wednesday  preceding  the  election  (here,  October  14),  and  requires  electronic \nregistrations to be received by 11:59 p.m. on the third Wednesday preceding the election.  \nDNC argues that the court should extend both deadlines to the Friday before the election, \nOctober 30, to align with the deadline for registering in person before election day.  As the \nDNC points out, the court granted similar, preliminary relief to that requested by plaintiffs \nhere  before  the  April  election,  extending  the  mail-in  postmark  date  and  electronic \nregistration receipt deadline by 12 days to the Friday before the election.  (3/20/20 Op. & \nOrder (dkt. #37) 10-15.)   \nHowever, the six weeks leading up to this election are different than the week or \ntwo before the April 7 election, when the pandemic was a new phenomenon and demanded \nswift adjustments to the timetable to accommodate voting from the safety of one’s home, \nrather than venturing out into the public.  As defendants persuasively argue, individuals \nare now sufficiently on notice of the pandemic’s risks, its impacts on their daily lives, and \nmeasures that can be taken to reduce those risks.  So, to the extent individuals wish to \nregister electronically or by mail to facilitate later voting by mail, defendants argue that \nvoters must plan accordingly and complete their electronic and mail-in registrations by the \nestablished deadline of October 14.   \n38 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 39 of 69\nOf course, what the Legislature originally afforded as a convenience to in-person \nregistration and voting has, at least for this election, become a necessity for some, as well \nas an important tool for WEC and local officials to reduce the number of people voting in \nperson on the day of the election.  Even more to the point, as WEC Administrator Wolfe \ntestified at the hearing, registering in person on the day of the election not only risks longer \nlines, but increases the amount of time individuals are inside polling stations, as well as \nrequiring  person-to-person  engagement  in  two  separate  processes,  which  are  further \nprolonged by the additional, COVID-19 protections of social distancing and masking.  \n(8/5/20 Hr’g Tr. (dkt. #532) 60-61, 98-100.)  Facilitating early registration electronically \nand by mail will not only limits sustained interactions on election day, but will allow some, \nsignificant number of unwary individuals sufficient time to request absentee ballots and \nvote by mail (or by drop-off), rather than voting in person before or on the day of the \nelection.  For these reasons, WEC Administrator Wolfe testified at the hearing, the \ntradition of having a significant number of individuals register in person on the day of the \nelection is incompatible with the goal of -- and projected, significant demand for -- voting \nby mail via absentee ballot.  (Id. at 57.)  Cutting off electronic and mail-in registrations \nthree weeks before the election will not just thwart efforts to encourage Wisconsin voters \nto vote by mail via absentee ballots, but increase the burdens and risks on those choosing \nto vote in person.  This is especially true in light of Wisconsin’s “cultural tradition” of \nregistering on election day, with more than 80% of registered voters having engaged in that \nprocess in the past.  (Id. at 58.)   \nStill, the recognized health benefits of driving the electorate to mail-in registration \n39 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 40 of 69\nand absentee voting is probably insufficient alone to justify this court modifying an \nestablished deadline for doing so.  The difference in April, and again this November, is the \nsheer number of new registrations and absentee voters who will rely on the U.S. mail to do \nso, especially as compared to past elections, and the risks of severely restricting that  option \nduring the pandemic for those who will come to the realization that the window has closed \ntoo soon for them to register and request an absentee ballot.  Unless some relief is provided \nto the October 14 deadline, the likelihood of thousands of voters missing this window and \nchoosing not to vote in person is quite high, and while that eventuality may be present in \nany election, the risks expand to tens of thousands of voters in the midst of  the pandemic.  \nFor these reasons, plaintiffs have demonstrated that discontinuing electronic and mail \nregistration  options  precipitously  on  October  14  will  likely  restrict  many  Wisconsin \ncitizens’ freedom to exercise their right to vote, at least without having to take unnecessary \nrisks of COVID-19 exposure by registering in person, and for some significant minority of \ncitizens, will severely restrict that right because of age, comorbidities or other health \nconcerns.  See Luft, 963 F.3d at 671–72 (“Only when voting rights have been severely \nrestricted must states have compelling interests and narrowly tailored rules.”) (citations \nomitted). \nIn contrast, the only interest in enforcing the October 14 deadline articulated by \nthe defendants is providing sufficient time for election officials to prepare voter records.  \nAs WEC Administrator Wolfe testified at the hearing, however, this deadline could be \nextended an additional week until October 21, 2020, while still providing sufficient time \nfor local election officials to print poll books.  (8/5/20 Hr’g Tr. (dkt. #532) 62.)  Indeed, \n40 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 41 of 69\nthe record reflects that local election officials were able to accommodate the court’s April \n2020 extension of electronic registration by 12 days before the April election without \nsignificant impact of local officials’ ability to manage in-person voting.  (Id. at 63-64; see \nalso DNC Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #419) ¶ 194. )   \nAccordingly, the court concludes that plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated that \nthe  current  electronic  and  mail-in  registration  deadline  of  October  14,  2020,  will \nsubstantially (and in a smaller, but significant group, severely) restrict the right to vote \nduring the ongoing pandemic, particularly after considering the likely impact of increased, \nin-person  registration  on  the  orderly,  safe  functioning  of  voting  on  Election  Day.  \nMoreover, by moving the deadline only one week to October 21st, rather than the two-\nweek extension requested by plaintiffs, the court has amply accounted for any arguable \nstate interest in allowing sufficient time to prepare voter records.  Finally, with this \naccommodation, the court finds that the balance of interests weighs heavily in favor of \nplaintiffs as to this narrow relief.   \nb.  Proof-of-Residence Requirement  \nThe DNC plaintiffs also seek an order enjoining the proof-of-residence requirement \nunder Wisconsin Statute § 6.34(2) for individuals who attest under penalty of perjury that \nthey cannot meet the requirement after reasonable efforts.  During the evidentiary hearing, \nthe DNC plaintiffs acknowledged that they do not have any declarations establishing an \nactual instance of a voter being unable to meet this requirement.  (8/5/20 Hr’g Tr. (dkt. \n#532) 200.)  In light of the record evidence, this is unsurprising, since it is fairly easy to \nsatisfy the requirement.  For those requesting an absentee ballot electronically, a driver’s \n41 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 42 of 69\nlicense also satisfies the proof-of-residence requirement.  (8/5/20 Hr’g Tr. (dkt. #532) 80 \n(Wolfe testifying that “[i]f someone registers to vote online, they do not need to provide \nproof of residence because the match with their DMV record fulfills that requirement”).)  \nIf a person wishes to register by mail or early in person, a utility bill would suffice, and the \nvoter would not even need to provide a copy of it.  For some individuals, this requirement \nstill may constitute a burden -- for example, as the DNC plaintiffs argued at the hearing, \nthere may be college students not on a lease or on utility accounts -- but this is always the \ncase and not specific to the pandemic.19  Finally, as the Seventh Circuit recognized in Luft, \nthere is a significant state interest in ensuring that individuals are voting in their proper \ndistricts.  Luft, 963 F.3d at 676.  On this record, therefore, the court concludes that \nplaintiffs  are  not  likely  to  succeed  in  demonstrating  that  the  proof-of-residence \nrequirement substantially burdens the right to vote or that this burden outweighs the \nState’s interests, even in light of the circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n2.  Absentee Voting \na.  Counting of Absentee Ballots \nNext,  the Edwards  and  Swenson  plaintiffs  seek  an  order  enjoining  Wisconsin \nStatute §§ 6.88, 7.51-.52, which require that absentee ballots not be counted before \nelection day.  Plaintiffs argue that this requirement thwarts local election officials’ ability \nto address defects in absentee ballots -- particularly a voter’s failure to comply with the \n \n19 While the DNC plaintiffs propose use of “an affidavit” as a possible “safety net,” Frank II, 819 \nF.3d at 387, they fall short of proposing specific language, much less describing how this exception \nwould be administered.  Regardless, the court is concerned about adding any additional burdens on \nthe WEC’s electronic registration process or on the stretched resources of local election officials.  \n42 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 43 of 69\nwitness certification requirement.  If the court were to enjoin this requirement and allow \ncounting before the election day, then local election officials could find defects, contact \nvoters and give them a chance to fix them before it is too late. \nThe court is not persuaded by this argument.  As the Legislature explains, Wisconsin \nlaw already provides procedures for absentee ballot voters to correct errors.  Indeed, the \nerrors typically will occur on the outside of the envelope, and therefore, it need not be \nopened, nor must the ballot be counted for an election official to alert a voter of a witness \ncertification error or some other defect.  Regardless, the court agrees with the Legislature \nthat plaintiffs’ proposed solution is a poor fit for the general problem of absentee ballot \nerrors.  Finally, plaintiffs’ argument is insufficiently tied to the particular circumstances \nsurrounding the pandemic.  Indeed, to the extent that plaintiffs pursue this injunction to \nfacilitate efficient counting of absentee ballots, the court’s extension of the absentee ballot \nreceipt deadline sufficiently addresses this concern.  If anything, by precluding early \ncounting of absentee ballots during a period when they are likely to comprise 60 to 75% \nof all ballots cast, the state’s interest in securing the tallying process until after the election \nis closed is stronger.  On this record, the court finds no basis to grant relief.  \nb.  Witness Signature Requirement     \nAll four plaintiffs next seek an order enjoining the witness signature requirement \nunder  Wisconsin  Statute  §  6.87(2),  although  the  plaintiffs  again  suggest  various \nreplacements for this requirement.  In essence, the DNC plaintiffs seek to enjoin this \nrequirement for those individuals who (1) attest under penalty of perjury that they cannot \nmeet  the  requirement  after  reasonable  efforts,  (2)  sign  a  form  and  provide  contact \n43 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 44 of 69\ninformation, and (3) cooperate with local election officials who may follow-up.  The DNC \nargues that this process would satisfy Frank II and Luft.  The Edwards plaintiffs similarly \nrequest that the court allow the small population of people who cannot secure a witness to \nsign a sworn statement to that effect.  Next, the Gear plaintiffs propose an order following \nthe  Seventh  Circuit’s  opinion  reviewing  this  court’s  April  preliminary  injunction  by \nallowing voters to write in the name and address of a witness but not require a signature.  \nFinally, the Swenson plaintiffs argue that self-certification should be sufficient to satisfy \nthe State’s interest. \nIn support of their various requests for relief from a witness signature, plaintiffs \nsubmit  substantive  evidence  in  the  form  of  affidavits  from  individuals  who  recount \ndifficulties they encountered in obtaining or attempting to obtain a witness signature \nduring the April election.  (See, e.g., DNC Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #419) ¶¶ 157-60 (citing \ndeclarations).)  Plaintiffs also assert that the proposed alternatives in the April election \n(e.g., have someone witness it via a video call or through a window) obviously did not work \nin light of the roughly 14,000 ballots that were rejected because of insufficient witness \ncertifications, and further suggest that some portion of the 135,000 unreturned ballots \nwere not submitted because voters could not secure a witness.   \nWhile acknowledging the possible burden that the witness signature requirement \nwill place on some voters, the Seventh Circuit reversed this court’s entry of preliminary \nrelief  from  this  requirement  for  the  April  2020  election.    Democratic  Nat’l  Comm.  v. \nBostelmann, Nos. 20-1538, -1546, -1545, (7th Cir. April 3, 2020).  Moreover, it did so even \nthough the arguable need was greater then, given (1) the compressed period for election \n44 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 45 of 69\nofficials to adjust to the COVID-19 restrictions, (2)  increased uncertainty as to how the \nvirus spreads and risks of contracting it, and (3) the dramatic increase in first-time absentee \napplications  and  voters.    Further,  the  Seventh  Circuit  faulted  this  court  for  giving \ninadequate weight to the State’s interests behind the witness requirement and vacated that \nportion of this court’s preliminary injunction, rather than merely modifying it to require a \nmore robust affidavit or a witness, but no signature.  Finally, the Supreme Court recently \nsignaled its own reticence to set aside such state law requirements by staying the effect of \nan Eleventh Circuit decision blocking photo-ID and witness-signature requirements for \nabsentee ballots.  See Merrill v. People First of Ala., No. 19A1063 (U.S. July 2, 2020). \nTo the extent, the Seventh Circuit left room for other possible workarounds to the \nwitness-signature requirement, the WEC has again proposed a number of options for any \nvoters having difficulty meeting the requirement for safety or other reasons all of which \nwould allow a voter to maintain a safe distance from the witness.  See WEC, “Absentee \nWitness  Signature  Requirement  Guidance”  (Mar.  29,  2020), \nhttps://elections.wi.gov/node/6790.  Given  a greater understanding as to the efficacy of \nmasks and social distancing in substantially lowering the risk of transmitting the virus (and \nthe seemingly reduced risks of its transmittal on surfaces than by aerosols), these options \nalso appear more viable and safe for individuals wishing to vote via absentee ballot than \nthey did in April; albeit for some, the requirement may still present a significant hurdle.  \nFinally, under Purcell, there remains the challenge of fashioning and implementing an \neffective exception to this requirement in the shorter period for voting via absentee ballot \nin terms of:  drafting an appropriate form, publicizing the option, managing its distribution \n45 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 46 of 69\nto voters who cannot meet the requirement, and effecting the return of that form.   \nViewing the election system as a whole, including the flexibility surrounding this \nrequirement, coupled with additional options for voting in person, either early or on the \nday of the election, the court concludes that plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a \nsufficient likelihood of success in proving that the burden placed on some voters by this \nrequirement  outweighs  the  State’s  interests  and  possible  disruption  in  the  orderly \nprocessing of an unprecedented number of absentee ballots.  Accordingly, the court will \ndeny this request for relief under Anderson-Burdick. \nAs noted above, some of the plaintiffs assert claims under the ADA as well.  At the \nhearing, the Swenson plaintiffs specifically argued that relief from the witness signature \nrequirement was warranted in light of the ADA.  To establish a violation of the ADA, a \nplaintiff “must prove that he is a ‘qualified individual with a disability,’ that he was denied \n‘the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity’ or otherwise subjected \nto discrimination by such an entity, and that the denial or discrimination was ‘by reason \nof’ his disability.”  Love v. Westville Corr. Ctr., 103 F.3d 558, 560 (7th Cir. 1996) (quoting \n42 U.S.C. § 12132).  A defendant’s “failure to make reasonable modifications in policies, \npractices, or procedures can constitute discrimination under Title II.”  Lacy v. Cook Cty., \n897  F.3d  847,  853  (7th  Cir.  2018)  (citing  28  C.F.R.  §  35.130(b)(7)(i)3).    An \naccommodation is reasonable if “it is both efficacious and proportional to the costs to \nimplement it.”  Oconomowoc Residential Programs v. City of Milwaukee, 300 F.3d 775, 784 (7th \nCir.  2002).    The  ADA,  however,  does  not  require  a  modification  that  would \n“fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.”  P.F. by A.F. v. Taylor, \n46 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 47 of 69\n914 F.3d 467, 472 (7th Cir. 2019) (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7)(i)). \nHere, for the same reason that the court concluded the risks of administering an \naffidavit, self-certifying or other program outweigh the burden on voting rights, the court \nalso concludes that the recommended accommodation is not reasonable under the ADA, \nbecause it is not “efficacious and proportional to the costs to implement it.”  Oconomowoc \nResidential Programs, 300 F.3d at 784.  As such, plaintiffs have not shown a likelihood of \nsuccess in proving that the witness signature requirement violates the ADA. \nc.  Receipt Deadline of Absentee Ballots \nNext, the DNC plaintiffs and the Swenson plaintiffs seek an order enjoining the \nrequirement that absentee ballots must be received by election day under Wisconsin \nStatute § 6.87(6), urging instead that the ballots again be postmarked by election day to \nbe counted.  In its prior opinion and order, the court extended the deadline for receipt of \nmailed-in absentee ballots until the Monday after the election day.  On appeal, the Seventh \nCircuit upheld this same extension, as did the U.S. Supreme Court, except for requiring  \nthat the return envelope be postmarked before or on election day. \nThe reasons for the court’s extension of the deadline for receipt of mailed-in \nabsentee votes for the April 2020 election applies with almost equal force to the upcoming \nNovember 2020 election.  The WEC is now projecting 1.8 to 2 million individuals will \nvote via absentee ballot, exceeding the number of absentees by a factor of three for any \nprior general, presidential elections and exceeding by as much as a million the number of \nabsentee voters that overwhelmed election officials during the April 2020 election.  As the \ncourt discussed during the August 5th hearing, Wisconsin’s election system also allows \n47 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 48 of 69\nindividuals to request ballots up to five days before the election.  While this deadline has \nworked for the most part during a normal election cycle, the same statutory deadline is \nlikely to disenfranchise a significant number of voters in the November election given the \nprojected, record volume of absentee ballots.  On top of the sheer volume of absentee ballot \nrequests that election officials found difficult to manage, the record also establishes that \nthe USPS’s delivery of mail has slowed due to budget constraints or other reasons, and will \nundoubtedly be overwhelmed again with ballots in November, as they were in April.   \nRegardless of cause, plaintiffs have established significant problems with fulfilling \nabsentee ballot requests timely, and even greater problems in getting them back in time to \nbe counted.  Indeed, those problems would have resulted in the disenfranchisement of \nsome 80,000 voters during the April election but for this court’s entry of a preliminary \ninjunction, and there is no evidence to suggest that the fundamental causes of these \nproblems have resolved or will be resolved in advance of the November election.  To the \ncontrary, the WEC acknowledges that the unprecedented numbers of absentee voters will \nagain be very challenging for local election officials to manage in the compressed time frame \nunder current law despite their best efforts to prepare for and manage this influx, and they \nhave no reason to expect any better performance by the USPS.20 \n \n20 This is not to denigrate the ongoing efforts of the small staff at WEC and efforts of local election \nofficials, nor of postal workers, just to reflect the systemic issues that will arise in a system never \nmeant to accommodate massive mail-in voting.  Indeed, in addition to its efforts to encourage \nstaffing up locally, WEC worked with USPS to add bar codes to absentee ballots, but without \nincreased USPS personnel or automated tracking equipment, this is unlikely to change the speed \nof receipt of applications or absentee ballots, much less receipt of executed ballots.  At best, it may \nhelp  to  better  track  how  thousands  of  applications  and  votes  became  misplaced  long  after \ncompletion of the November election.    \n48 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 49 of 69\nIn response, the Legislature argues that individuals should request ballots now, so \nthat they can receive, complete and mail them back well in advance of the statutory \ndeadline, which requires receipt on or before election day.  The court whole-heartedly \nagrees  that  Wisconsin  voters  should  proactively  manage  their  voting  plans,  request \nabsentee ballots online or by mail now (or as soon as possible thereafter), if they wish to \nvote by absentee ballot, and then diligently complete and return them well in advance of \nthe election.  Everyone -- the WEC, the Legislature, other elected officials, and the political \nparties and affiliated groups -- should be advocating for and to a large extent are advocating \nfor such action, although the latter entities are more targeted at best and subject mischief \nat worst.  Nonetheless, given the sheer volume expected this November, there remains little \ndoubt that tens of thousands of seemingly prudent, if unwary, would-be voters will not \nrequest an absentee ballot far enough in advance to allow them to receive it, vote, and \nreturn it for receipt by mail before the election day deadline despite acting well in advance \nof the deadline for requiring a ballot.   \nWhile the Legislature would opt to disregard the voting rights of these so-called \nprocrastinators, Wisconsin’s election system sets them up for failure in light of the near \ncertain impacts of this ongoing pandemic.  If anything, the undisputed record demonstrates \nthat unwary voters  who otherwise reasonably wait up to two weeks before the October 29, \n2020, deadline, to request an absentee ballot by mail face a significant risk of being \ndisenfranchised because their executed, mailed ballot will not be received by officials on or \nbefore the current election day deadline.  Moreover, it is particularly unreasonable to \nexpect undecided voters to exercise their voting franchise by absentee ballot well before the \n49 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 50 of 69\nend of the presidential campaign, especially when the Wisconsin’s statutory deadline is \ngiving them a false sense of confidence in timely receipt.  \nNot really disputing the magnitude of this risk in light of the vast, unprecedented \nnumber of absentee ballots received after the deadline in April, the Legislature instead \nargues that a similar extension this time will somehow undermine the state’s interests in \nhaving prompt election results.  Even this argument rings hollow during a pandemic, but \nit  also  ignores  that  some  fourteen  states,  other  than  Wisconsin  and  the  District  of \nColumbia, follow a postmark-by-election-day rule (or a close variant) and count ballots \nthat arrive in the days following the election, so long as they are timely postmarked.  (DNC \nPls.’ Supp. PFOFs (dkt. #501) ¶ 19.)  As such, Wisconsin will not be an anomaly.  \nFurthermore, by including a postmark-by-election-day requirement, there is no concern \nthat initial election results will influence a voter’s decision.  Moreover, unlike in April, the \ncourt will not require election officials to refrain from publishing results until after the \nextended absentee ballot deadline, since that requirement was only added because of this \ncourt’s original decision not to include a postmark deadline.  With the guidance of the \nUnited States Supreme Court that a postmark deadline is warranted, any concern about \nearly release of election results is mitigated.   \nFinally, while not addressed by defendants, plaintiffs offered evidence that the \nelection day receipt requirement actually furthered the state’s interest in completing its \ncanvass during the April election.  Regardless, WEC Administrator Wolfe testified that \nelection officials were able to meet all post-election canvassing deadlines notwithstanding \nthis court’s six-day extension of the deadline in April, and the extension gave election \n50 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 51 of 69\nofficials time to tabulate and report election results more efficiently and accurately.  (DNC \nPls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #419) ¶ 195.)  Nor have defendants identified any other predicted or \nunforeseen anomalies arise because of this extension.  On the contrary, as previously \ndiscussed, there is strong evidence that as many as 80,000 voters’ rights were vindicated \nby the extension in the primary election, and a reasonable extrapolation for the general \nelection could well exceed 100,000.  \nThus, on this record, the court concludes that plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of \nsuccess in demonstrating the risk of disenfranchisement of thousands of Wisconsin voters \ndue to the election day receipt deadline outweighs any state interest during this pandemic.  \nAccordingly, the court will grant this request, extending the receipt deadline for absentee \nballots until November 9, 2020, but requiring that the ballots be mailed and postmarked \non or before election day, November 3, 2020.21   \n \n21 The court is mindful that the addition of a postmark requirement by the U.S. Supreme Court \ncreated some unintended consequences in April 2020, since a small proportion of the absentee \nballots returned by mail lacked a legible postmark, apparently as a result of processing anomalies at \nlocal post offices.  The court was hopeful that the planned use of intelligent mail barcodes (“IMB”) \nwould assuage this concern, although it appears that the presence of IMBs on most return envelopes \nis uncertain, if not unlikely.  To the extent that the use of IMBs does not resolve this issue, the \nWEC will again need to provide guidance to local election officials, as it did for the April election. \nGiven the political deadlock among WEC Commissioners and the apparent lack of state law \nguidance on this subject -- as well as the fact that this postmark requirement is federally mandated \nand the apparent importance of equal treatment of ballots after Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000)   \n-- it is this court’s view that local election officials should generally err toward counting otherwise \nlegitimate absentee ballots lacking a definitive postmark if received by mail after election day but \nno later than November 9, 2020, as long as the ballot is signed and witnessed on or before \nNovember 3, 2020, unless there is some reason to believe that the ballot was actually placed in the \nmail after election day.  See Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Serv., 839 F.2d 669, 672 (Fed. Cir. 1988) \n(discussing prior version of regulation when timing was triggered by mailing of appeal to the Merit \nSystems Protection Board, explaining that “[t]he date of a filing by mail shall be determined by the \npostmark date; if no postmark date is evident on the mailing, it shall be presumed to have been \nmailed 5 days prior to receipt”); Wells v. Peake, No. 07-913, 2008 WL 5111436, at *3 (Vet. App. \nNov. 26, 2008) (relying on prior regulation where timing of appeal was triggered by its mailing, to \n51 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 52 of 69\nd.  Electronic Receipt of Absentee Ballots \nThe Gear, Edwards and Swenson plaintiffs further request an injunction preventing \nenforcement of Wisconsin Statute § 6.87(3)(a), which limits delivery of absentee ballots \nto mail only for domestic civilian voters, while military and overseas civilian voters can \nreceive an absentee ballot by fax or email delivery, or can even access a ballot electronically, \nthen download and print it.  Wis. Stat. § 6.87(3)(d).  As explained above, Judge Peterson \ninvalidated this ban on email delivery of absentee ballots for domestic civilians in One \nWisconsin Institute, 198 F. Supp. at 946-48, but that order was reversed by the Seventh \nCircuit’s decision in Luft.  Regardless, for the roughly four-year period of time that this \ncourt’s order was in place, local election officials were given the option to email or fax \nabsentee ballots to voters to ensure timely and efficient delivery. \nPlaintiffs’ renewed request for this relief is limited to those voters who timely \nrequest an absentee ballot (having already timely submitted their photo ID and registered \nby mail), had their requests processed and an absentee ballot mailed to them, but because \nof issues with the USPS (or for some other reason), the voters did not actually receive an \nabsentee ballot by mail in a timely fashion.  The record is replete with such examples from \nthe April 2020 election.  (See Swenson Pls.’ PFOFs (‘459, dkt. #42) ¶¶ 51, 164, 176 (citing \ndeclarations); DNC Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #419) ¶ 73 (citing declarations); Edwards Pls.’ \nPFOFs (dkt. #417) ¶¶ 67-162, 177-81) (citing declarations); Gear Pls.’ PFOFs (dkt. #422) \n \nexplain that “[s]ince there was no postmark, the BVA applied 38 C.F.R. § 20.305(a), which \npresumes the postmark date to be five days before the date VA receives the document, excluding \nSaturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays”). \n52 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 53 of 69\n¶¶ 37, 43, 81, 157-677 (citing declarations).)22   \nIn response, the Legislature argues generally that there are no special circumstances \nhere  to  warrant  granting  this  relief,  even  temporarily.    The  record  strongly  suggests \notherwise.  Specifically, the evidence is nearly overwhelming that the pandemic does present \na unique need for relief in light of: (1) the experience during the Spring election, (2) much \ngreater projected numbers of absentee ballot requests and votes  in November, and (3) \nongoing concerns about the USPS’s ability to process the delivery of absentee ballot \napplications and ballots timely.  None of this was remotely contemplated by the Legislature \nin fashioning an election system based mainly in person voting, nor addressed by the \nSeventh Circuit’s recent decision in Luft.  Moreover, the relief requested is narrowly \ntailored only to those voters who timely fulfilled all of the necessary steps to vote by mail, \nbut were thwarted through no fault of their own.  Indeed, this is exactly the “1% problem” \nthat the Seventh Circuit indicated requires a safety net in both Luft and Frank II.  The Gear \nplaintiffs further suggest that the court limit it to the week  before the deadline for \nrequesting absentee ballots, which for this election is October 29, 2020.  Up until that \ndeadline, voters may request a replacement ballot by mail.  See Wis. Stat. § 6.86(5) \n(explaining process for requesting an absentee ballot). \nThe Legislature also argues that this solution may create significant administrative \n \n22 The Swenson plaintiffs also request online ballot delivery for individuals with print disabilities \nunder the ADA.  While this request may have merit, plaintiffs have failed to explain adequately \nwhy the current options have proven inadequate in past elections or how the pandemic creates \nsufficient,  additional burdens to warrant relief.  Given the numerous requests for relief in these \nconsolidated cases, the court must remain focused on those requests for which the need and solution \nare clear and circumstances surrounding the pandemic in particular warrant an injunction.   \n53 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 54 of 69\nhurdles for local election officials, specifically citing to the need by local election officials \nto recast the absentee ballot into a form that is readable by voting machines.  However, \nlocal election officials themselves represent that this inconvenience is outweighed by the \nbenefit of having fewer, in-person voters on election day.  (Gear Br. (dkt. #421) 42.)  Plus, \nWisconsin has a four-year history when fax or electronic delivery was available to all voters \nat the discretion of local election officials without incident.  In contrast, the court’s \ninjunction will only apply to a narrow subset of those voters for whom an absentee ballot \nwas not received timely by mail, who afterwards request a replacement ballot in the week \nleading up to the deadline for making such a request, and satisfy local election officials of \nthe need for an alternative means of delivery.  For all these reasons, this limited relief \nshould not overtax election officials’ abilities to administer the November election. \nFinding that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that limiting receipt of \nabsentee ballots to mail delivery burdens voters’ rights who fail to receive their absentee \nballot timely, and that this burden is not outweighed by the interests of the State, the court \nwill grant that relief.  As set forth below, however, the ban on allowing online access to \nreplacement absentee ballots or emailing replacement ballots is only lifted for the narrow \nperiod from October 22 to October 29, 2020, as to those voters who timely requested an \nabsentee ballot, the request was approved, and the ballot was mailed, but the voter did not \nreceive the ballot in time to vote. For the limited number of disabled who truly require an \nelectronic ballot to vote effectively under the ADA, and have failed to discern an effective \nmeans to vote using a hard absentee ballot, after meeting all the same requirements set \nforth above for all voters, this may also provide an alternative. \n54 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 55 of 69\ne.  Mail Absentee Ballots to All Registered Voters \nFinally,  with  respect to  absentee  ballots,  the  Edwards  plaintiffs  seek  an order \nrequiring the WEC to send out absentee ballots to all registered voters, or at least to all \nvoters who previously voted absentee.  This request was not pursued at the hearing, and \nfor good reason, since it is neither narrowly tailored to the alleged violations to voting \nrights caused by the pandemic, nor considers the substantial burden it would place on the \nWEC and local election officials who have already begun responding to actual applications \nfor absentee ballots.  The court, therefore, denies this request.   \n3.  In-Person Voting \na.  Early In-Person Voting \nPlaintiffs further seek several injunctions relating to in-person voting.  To begin, the \nEdwards plaintiffs seek to enjoin Wisconsin Statute § 6.86(1)(b), which limits in-person, \nabsentee voting to the period beginning 14 days before the election and ending the Sunday \nbefore the election.  This request warrants little discussion because the Edwards plaintiffs \nfailed to develop the record as to why a 12-day period is not sufficient to provide voters an \nadequate opportunity to vote early in-person.  Viewing the election system as whole, a two-\nweek period for in-person, early voting, is sufficient to protect voters’ constitutional rights, \nespecially when considered in light of a robust mail-in absentee voting option and what \nwill hopefully be a generally safe and adequate, in-person voting opportunity on the day of \nthe election.     \nb.  Selection of Early In-Person Voting Sites \nThe Edwards  and  Swenson  plaintiffs  also  seek  to enjoin  Wisconsin  Statute  § \n55 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 56 of 69\n6.855(1), which requires municipalities to designate in-person, absentee voting site or sites \n(other than the clerk of board of election commissioners’ office) 14 days before absentee \nballots are available for the primary.  For the November election, this means the required \ndesignations were due by June 11, 2020.  Plaintiffs contend that extending this deadline \nwould (1) allow increased flexibility and (2) reduce crowds and encourage social distancing \nby allowing extra sites added.  Here, again, plaintiffs have failed to develop any record to \nfind that additional, in-person voting sites are necessary to meet the demand of voters who \nwish to vote in person before the election day, especially given that voters may do so over \na 12-day period of time.  Accordingly, the court will also deny this request. \na.  Photo ID Requirement \nThe DNC and Edwards plaintiffs both seek an order enjoining the photo ID \nrequirement  under  Wisconsin  Statute  §  6.87(1),  although  the  contours  of  the  relief \nrequested are different:  the DNC plaintiffs seek to enjoin the requirement for those \nindividuals who attest under penalty of perjury that they cannot meet those requirements \nafter reasonable efforts; while the Edwards plaintiffs seek to enjoin the requirement for \npeople with disabilities if they swear that they are unable to obtain the required ID.  \nThe DNC’s request for relief from the photo ID requirement falters for similar \nreasons as plaintiffs’ request for relief from the proof-of-residence requirement.  When \npressed at the hearing, the DNC plaintiffs listed four declarations from individuals who \nthey represented were not able to vote in the April 2020 election because of the ID \nrequirement.  From the court’s review of these four declarations, only one -- the declaration \nof Shirley Powell (dkt. #341) -- actually provides support for the requested relief.  Powell \n56 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 57 of 69\navers that she attempted to request an absentee ballot by mail, but could not do so because \nshe did not want to leave her house to obtain the necessary copy of her photo ID.  (Id. ¶ \n5.)23  That proof falls well short of a substantial burden on her right to vote.   \nFor their part, the Edward plaintiffs simply direct the court to a report about the \ndifficulty in obtaining photo IDs for the 2016 election, offering neither evidence specific \nto the COVID-19 pandemic nor proof of any unique burdens it places on disabled voters \nunder the ADA.  While the court acknowledges that some voters like Powell may encounter \ndifficulty in uploading a photo of their ID or obtaining a hard copy, this burden has likely \ndiminished since April 2020, given both the additional time voters will have to obtain the \nnecessary documents to request an absentee ballot electronically or by mail, coupled with \nthe increased awareness of how COVID-19 spreads and efforts one can take to avoid \ntransmission upon leaving the house.24   \nEven if not entitled to broader relief, plaintiffs argue, the creation of a “safe harbor” \nor “fail-safe” measure is called for by the Seventh Circuit’s decisions in Luft and Frank II.  \nHowever, the court concludes that, while not a perfect solution, the “indefinitely confined” \ndesignation under Wisconsin Statute § 6.87(4)(b)2 provides such relief already for those \n \n23 The other individuals -- Sue Rukamp, Sharon Gamm and Marlene Sorenson -- simply averred \nthat they encountered difficulty in uploading a photo of their ID or submitting a hard copy via \nmail, but it appears that all three were eventually able to request an absentee ballot.  (Dkt. ##349, \n294, 355.)  Not to diminish the burdens that they encountered, their declarations do not support \nproviding relief from the photo ID requirement.  Instead, the difficulties that they encountered are \nmore appropriately addressed in providing electronic delivery of ballots for those individuals who \ndo not timely receive absentee ballots by mail and by extending the deadline for receipt of absentee \nballots to account for USPS delays.  Both forms of relief are granted below. \n \n24 Of course, the court is not definitively concluding such a burden cannot be proved, just that \nplaintiffs have not begun to proffer evidence of their likelihood of doing so given the work-arounds \nnow available. \n57 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 58 of 69\nunique individuals who are both (1) not able to upload a photograph of their ID or obtain \na copy and (2) avoiding public outings because of legitimate COVID-19 concerns. \nApparently anticipating this outcome, plaintiffs further argue that if the court relies \non the “indefinitely confined” status as a safety net for the photo ID requirement, then it \nshould also define that term and direct the WEC to provide this definition in its materials \nexplaining and promoting voting via absentee ballot.  As it concluded in its earlier opinion \nand order, however, the plain language of the statute, coupled with the WEC’s March 2020 \nguidance that the term “does not require permanent or total inability to travel outside of \nthe residence” provides sufficient, albeit imperfect, information to guide voters’ use of that \nsafe harbor.  See Wisconsin Election Commission, Guidance for Indefinitely Confined Electors \nCOVID-19 (Mar. 29, 2020) ), https://elections.wi.gov/node/6788. \nOn  this  record,  therefore,  the  court  concludes  that  plaintiffs  have  failed  to \ndemonstrate a likelihood of succeeding in their claim that the COVID-19 pandemic \namplifies  the  typical burden of requiring  a  photo  ID,  so  as  to outweigh  the  State’s \nrepeatedly recognized interest in doing so.  Because the court relies on the “indefinitely \nconfined” option as a safety net or fail-safe for those legitimately unable to meet this \nrequirement, however, the court will direct the WEC to include on the MyVote website \n(and on any additional materials that may be printed explaining the “indefinitely confined” \noption) the language provided in their March 2020 guidance, which explains that the \nindefinitely confined exception “does not require permanent or total inability to travel \noutside of the residence.”   \n58 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 59 of 69\nb.  Election Official Residence Requirement  \nNext,  the  Edwards  and  Swenson  plaintiffs  seek  to  enjoin  Wisconsin  Statute \n§ 7.30(2), which requires that each election official be an elector of the county in which \nthe municipality is located.  This request has significant more traction in light of the record.  \nIn particular, based on her past experience and unique perspective, Administrator Wolfe \ntestified that her biggest worry in the administration of the November election is a lack of \npoll workers for in-person voting on election day.  (8/5/20 Hr’g Tr. (dkt. #532) 83.)  Both \nfor the April and August 2020 elections, local municipalities struggled to recruit and retain \nsufficient poll workers, which resulted in some localities being severely limited in providing \nin-person voting opportunities.  In fact, even with substantially greater warning and \nopportunity to plan, local election officials still had difficulty securing adequate people for \nWisconsin’s much smaller August 2020 election.  (Id. at 82-83.)  At minimum, eliminating \nthe  residence  requirement  would  provide  greater  flexibility  across  the  state  to  meet \nunanticipated last-minute demands for staffing due to COVID-19 outbreaks or fear. \nIn response, the Legislature simply argues that this requirement furthers the State’s \ninterest  in  promoting  a  decentralized  approach  to  election  management.    Without \ndiscounting the value of this interest, if a county or municipality lacks sufficient poll \nworkers and wishes to recruit workers from other locations within the state, including \naccessing National Guard members who reside outside of their community (should the \nGovernor choose to answer the repeated call by local officials to make them available \nsooner rather than later), the municipality or county has already conceded its inability to \nmaintain that interest while still conducting a meaningful election, at least with respect to \n59 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 60 of 69\nthe location of residence of poll workers. Regardless, in light of the record evidence \ndemonstrating that recruitment of poll workers will present a tricky and fluid barrier for \nadequate  in-person  voting  options  up  to  and  during  election  day,  plaintiffs  have \ndemonstrated a likelihood of success in proving that this requirement will burden their \nright  to  vote  and  that  this  burden  outweighs  any  state  interest  in  maintaining  the \nrequirement over expressed, local need..  As such, the court will grant this requested relief \nduring the ongoing pandemic. \nc.  Ensure Safe and Adequate In-Person Voting Sites \nThe DNC and Swenson plaintiffs seek an order requiring the WEC to provide safe \nand adequate, in-person voting options, including (1) adequate voting sites with sufficient \nnumber of poll workers, and (2) implementation of safety protocols like PPE, masks, social \ndistancing requirements, hand washing and sanitizing steps.  While the court agrees, and \nmore importantly the WEC and, in turn, local election officials agree, that these are \nappropriate steps to be taken, the court sees no basis to order this requested relief.   \nSpecifically, the WEC has earmarked $4.1 million to provide increased safety \nmeasures at locations and has also designated $500,000 to secure and distribute sanitation \nsupplies.  WEC also is providing public health guidance and training to local election \nofficials.  Plaintiffs fail to describe how these measurers fall short.  As for the concern about \nthe  number  of  voting  locations,  as  previously  described,  local  election  officials  in \nMilwaukee and Green Bay, in particular, have indicated their intent to open significantly \nmore polling locations than that opened in April.  Again, considering the election system \nas a whole, including the WEC’s, local officials’, and now the court’s efforts to ensure \n60 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 61 of 69\nrobust  absentee  voting  options,  the  court  concludes  that  plaintiffs  have  failed  to \ndemonstrate that the WEC and local election officials’ efforts to date with respect to \nensuring safe and adequate election-day voting sites are inadequate. \n4.  Requests for Miscellaneous Relief \nFinally, the Swenson plaintiffs propose a number of other areas of relief, which all \ninvolve ordering the WEC to do more or do better.  Specifically, the Swenson plaintiffs \nseek orders requiring the WEC to:  (1) upgrade electronic voter registration systems and \nabsentee ballot request systems;  (2) engage in a public education drive; (3) ensure secure \ndrop boxes for in-person return of absentee ballots; and (4) develop policies applicable to \nmunicipal clerks regarding coordinating with USPS to ensure timely delivery of and return \nof absentee ballots.  Again, all of these are worthwhile requests, but the record reflects that \nthe WEC is taking such steps or, at least, that a court order to the same effect is unlikely \nto do more before November 3 than hamper the ongoing state and local efforts.  For \nexample, in its June 25, 2020, report to the court, the WEC detailed its efforts to upgrade \nMyVote and WisVote, as well as provide federal funds to help municipalities with their IT \nneeds.  Moreover, the WEC described its development of various voter outreach videos, \nguides and surveys to help educate voters on unfamiliar aspects of voting.  Further, as the \nLegislature points out, Wisconsin Statute § 6.869 already requires the WEC to prescribe \nuniform instructions on absentee voting.  As for the request for more drop boxes, the WEC \nis providing funding from the CARES Act to municipalities to provide such boxes.  Finally, \nas described above, the WEC is working with the USPS to implement intelligent mail \nbarcodes to track absentee ballots.   \n61 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 62 of 69\nTo the extent mail delivery issues persist despite these steps, the court has attempted \nby entry of the order below to accommodate these concerns by permitting online access, \nby emailing and faxing of absentee ballots for those individuals who do not receive their \nrequested absentee ballots timely, and by extending the absentee ballot receipt date.  \nPlaintiffs’ further requests for relief are either too vague to be meaningful or unnecessary \nbecause the WEC is already taking such steps. \nB. Alternate Claims for Relief Under the Due Process and Equal Protection \nClauses and Voting Rights Act \nAs already discussed, constitutional challenges to laws that regulate elections are \ngenerally analyzed under balancing test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in the  \nAnderson-Burdick test.  See, e.g., Crawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 190 \n(2008); Luft, 963 F.3d at 671; see also Samuel Issacharoff et al., The Law of Democracy 92-\n127 (5th ed. 2016) (reviewing the general constitutional framework for challenges to \nelection laws affecting the right to vote).  This balancing test is rooted in both the First \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  See Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434 (citing \nAnderson,  460  U.S.  at  788-89).    In  interpreting  the  Supreme  Court’s  election  law \njurisprudence, the Seventh Circuit has concluded that the Anderson-Burdick test “applies to \nall First and Fourteenth Amendment challenges to state election laws.”  Acevedo v. Cook Cty. \nOfficers Electoral Bd., 925 F.3d 944, 948 (7th Cir. 2019) (emphasis in original); see also \nHarlan v. Scholz, 866 F.3d 754, 759 (7th Cir. 2017) (the Anderson-Burdick framework \naddresses “the constitutional rules that apply to state election regulations”). \nAs explained during oral argument, this court is exceedingly reluctant to apply more \n62 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 63 of 69\ngeneralized constitutional tests to the election laws challenged here, at least without a \nspecific legal and factual basis to do so.  Indeed, in its order preceding completion of \nbriefing and oral arguments on the motions for preliminary injunction, the court suggested \nthat  to  proceed  on  claims  under  other  constitutional  frameworks,  plaintiffs  must \nadequately  distinguish  such  claims  from  those  brought  under  Anderson-Burdick.    (See \n6/10/20 Op. & Order (dkt. #217) 14-15.)  Without ever adequately addressing this \nconcern, some plaintiffs nevertheless maintain that this court should venture outside of \nthe Anderson-Burdick framework and consider their claims under alternative procedural due \nprocess and equal protection clause standards. \nSpecifically, plaintiffs urge the court to apply the more general procedural due \nprocess balancing test articulated in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976).  That test \nrequires the court to balance: (1) the interest that will be affected by the state action; (2) \nthe risk of erroneous deprivation of this interest through the procedures used by the state \nand the probable value, if any, of additional procedural safeguards; and (3) the state’s \ninterest, including the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional procedure \nwould entail.  Id. at 340-49.  The Swenson plaintiffs contend that the Anderson-Burdick and \nMathews tests are “analytically distinct” because “[t]he focus of the procedural due process \ninquiry is what process is due before a statutorily protected liberty or property interest is \ndeprived.”  (Swenson Pls.’ Br. (‘459, dkt. #41) 47 n.188.)  Similarly, the DNC plaintiffs \ncontend  that  “Anderson-Burdick  balances  burdens  on  voting  rights  against  states’ \njustifications, while due process claims focus on the sufficiency of the process involved \nbefore the State deprives someone of their right to vote.”  (DNC Pls.’ Br. (dkt. #420) 55.)   \n63 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 64 of 69\nDuring initial briefing, no plaintiff could cite to any case law to support the nuanced \ndifferences suggested by their respective positions.  To the contrary, the DNC plaintiffs \nacknowledged that “we have not yet found a decision in which a court accepted an \nAnderson-Burdick claim while rejecting a due process challenge to the same provision; or \nrejected an Anderson-Burdick challenge while striking down the same provision as violating \ndue process.”  (DNC Br. (dkt. #420) 54.)  Since then, plaintiffs have pointed to three, \nrecent election cases in which a district court applied the general Mathews test to election \nlaw challenges, all of which were considered in the context of the current pandemic.  (See \nNotice of Supp. Authority (dkt. #536) (citing The New Georgia Project v. Raffensperger, 1:20-\ncv-01986-ELR (N.D. Ga. Aug. 31, 2020)); Notice of Supp. Authority (dkt. #534) (citing \nFrederick v. Lawson, No. 19-cv-01959, 2020 WL 4882696 (S.D. Ind. Aug. 20, 2020)); \nNotice of Supp. Authority (dkt. #523) (citing Democracy N.C. v. N.C. State Bd. of Elections, \nNo. 20-cv-457 (M.D.N.C. Jul. 27, 2020)).)  However, even these cases fail to address the \noverlap between the Mathews and Anderson-Burdick standards, much less the exclusive role \nplayed by the latter test in the U.S. Supreme Court’s overall election law jurisprudence, \nthus providing little guidance as to the role, if any, of the Mathews test here.  Accordingly, \nplaintiffs have not convinced this court that in the claims before it, an independent analysis \nunder the Mathews test is necessary, much less appropriate.25 \nAs for the equal protection claims, plaintiffs rely on the standard articulated by the \n \n25 The DNC plaintiffs themselves admit that the “Anderson-Burdick and Mathews v. Eldridge analyses \nare both multi-factor balancing inquiries . . . and the results of the inquiries may often be the same.”  \n(DNC Pls.’ Br. (dkt. #420) 55.)   \n \n64 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 65 of 69\nSupreme Court’s per curiam decision in Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000).  There, the \nSupreme Court explained that a state “may not, by later arbitrary and disparate treatment, \nvalue one person’s vote over that of another.” Id. at 104-05.26  Notwithstanding that the \nSupreme Court took unusual pains to limit its “consideration” specifically to the “present \ncircumstances”  surrounding  the  2000  Florida  recount,  id.  at  109,  other  courts  have \nappeared to rely on Gore in attempting to analyze subsequent election challenges.  See, e.g., \nRaleigh Wake Citizens Ass’n v. Wake Cty. Bd. of Elections, 827 F.3d 333, 337 (4th Cir. 2016) \n(redistricting); Obama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 428–29 (6th Cir. 2012) (restrictions \non early voting); Idaho Coal. United for Bears v. Cenarrusa, 342 F.3d 1073, 1077 & n.7 (9th \nCir. 2003) (ballot-initiative process). \nEven if applicable, however, the Legislative defendants persuasively point out that \nthis standard requires plaintiffs to prove that the arbitrary and disparate treatment is a \nresult of specific election “procedures.”  Bush, 531 U.S. at 105.  Here, the alleged disparate \ntreatment is rooted in poll closings and poll-worker shortages, lack of adequate personal \nprotective equipment at some polling locations and disparate treatment regarding voter \nregistration and requests for absentee ballots.  Arguably, therefore, these allegations are not \nrooted in specific “procedures” at all.  Even if they were, plaintiffs again fail to explain \nadequately what additional relief would or should be afforded under the equal protection \n \n26 Plaintiffs also included a variety of facts regarding the disparate impact of COVID-19 on \nparticular groups seeking to vote, such as specific racial minorities and the elderly.  Without \ndenigrating this impact in any way, plaintiffs’ equal protection claim is premised on a general \n“arbitrary  treatment”  theory,  rather  than  an  argument  that  defendants’  actions  specifically \ndiscriminated against a particular protected class of voters, making many of these facts not relevant \nto, and thus not referenced further in, the court’s discussion. \n65 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 66 of 69\nclause that is not already available under Anderson-Burdick. \nFinally, in addition to these constitutional arguments, the Swenson plaintiffs assert \na claim under Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act (“VRA”), which provides in relevant \npart that “[n]o person, whether acting under color of law or otherwise, shall intimidate, \nthreaten, or coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any person for voting.”  \n52 U.S.C. § 10307(b).  The Swenson plaintiffs argue that defendants’ inadequate response \nto the pandemic means that voters are intimidated to vote in person, for fear of catching \nCOVID-19.  (Swenson Pls.’ Br. (dkt. #41) 25.)  Although admittedly a creative argument, \nsuch an interpretation seriously stretches the purpose and common-sense meaning of \nsection 11(b). \nThe VRA was signed into law in 1965 against the backdrop of the civil rights \nmovement and state resistance to enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment.  See generally \nDep’t  of  Justice,  History  of  Federal  Voting  Rights  Laws  (July  28,  2017), \nhttps://www.justice.gov/crt/history-federal-voting-rights-laws.  While other sections of the \nVRA had enormous consequences on voting rights -- particularly section 2, which prohibits \ndiscriminatory voting practices, and section 5, which provides for federal “preclearance” of \nelection changes in states with a history of discriminatory practices -- relatively little case \nlaw has explored the scope of section 11(b).  See Ben Cady & Tom Glazer, Voters Strike \nBack: Litigating Against Modern Voter Intimidation, 39 N.Y.U. Rev. L. & Soc. Change 173, \n190  (2015).    Considering  this  background,  there  is  no  evidence  that  Congress \ncontemplated extending the VRA to impose liability on states that do not take adequate \naction to reduce citizens’ “intimidation” of in-person voting due to an infectious virus.  \n66 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 362   Filed: 09/21/20   Page 67 of 69\nMoreover, the plain language of the statute itself suggests that the intimidation must be \ncaused by a “person,” not a disease or other natural force.  Further, the parties disagree \nover whether section 11(b) requires a mens rea -- plaintiffs argue that it does not, the \nLegislature argues that it does -- and no definitive answer is found in case law.  In light of \nthese various considerations and uncertainties, 11(b) also appears a poor fit for analyzing \nthe issues presented in this case, and the court finds that plaintiffs have presented no \nlikelihood of success on the merits of their claims under the VRA as well. \nORDER \nIT IS SO ORDERED:   \n1)  Common Cause Wisconsin’s motion for leave to file a brief as amicus curiae \n(’249 dkt. #251; ’278 dkt. #186; ’340 dkt. #51; ’459 dkt. #75) is GRANTED. \n2)  Plaintiffs Democratic National Committee and Democratic Party of Wisconsin’s \nmotion for preliminary injunction (’249 dkt. #252) is GRANTED IN PART \nAND DENIED IN PART as explained above and set forth below and in the \nseparate preliminary injunction order. \n3)  The Wisconsin Legislature’s motion to dismiss the Gear complaint (’278 dkt. \n#382) is DENIED. \n4)  Plaintiffs Sylvia Gear, et al.’s motion for preliminary injunction (’278 dkt. #304) \nis GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART as explained above and set \nforth below and in the separate preliminary injunction order. \n5)  Defendants  Scott  Fitzgerald,  Robin  Vos,  Wisconsin  State  Assembly,  and \nWisconsin State Senate’s motion to dismiss the Edwards complaint (’340 dkt. \n#12) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.

Kavanaugh, Circuit Justice for the Seventh Cir-\ncuit: \nPursuant to Rules 22 and 23 of the Rules of this Court, Applicants Jill Swen-\nson, Melody McCurtis, Maria Nelson, Black Leaders Organizing for Communities, \nand Disability Rights Wisconsin, plaintiffs-appellees in the courts below, respectful-\nly apply for an order vacating the stay issued on October 8, 2020, by a panel of the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, DNC v. Bostelmann, 2020 \nWL 5951359 (7th Cir. 2020), a copy of which is appended to this application at \nApp.1a-32a.  The Seventh Circuit’s order stayed a preliminary injunction issued in \nfour consolidated cases on September 21, 2020, DNC v. Bostelmann, 2020 WL \n5627186 (W.D. Wis. Sept. 21, 2020), appended to this application at App.33a-101a. \nINTRODUCTION \nIn response to a once-in-a-century pandemic, and after extensive factual de-\nvelopment and briefing, a full-day evidentiary hearing, and detailed factfinding, the \ndistrict court concluded that mass disenfranchisement of Wisconsin voters would \nensue in the absence of targeted relief, and enjoined discrete aspects of Wisconsin \nlaw.  This Application concerns the two aspects of the district court’s relief sought \nby the Swenson Plaintiffs (Applicants):  (i) a six-day extension of the absentee-ballot \nreceipt deadline for ballots postmarked by election day; and (ii) an injunction sus-\npending a Wisconsin statute that precludes municipalities facing pollworker short-\nages from addressing those shortages by utilizing pollworkers from other counties.   \n1 \n\n \nThis Court is familiar with the first item of relief:  after the Court’s decision \non the day before Wisconsin’s April primary in RNC v. DNC, 140 S. Ct. 1205 (2020), \nballots arriving after election day could be counted so long as they were postmarked \nby election day.  It is undisputed that this relief prevented 80,000 voters from being \ndisenfranchised through no fault of their own in April and the same relief will likely \nprevent even more widespread disenfranchisement come November.  And as to the \nsecond item of relief, the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) Administrator \ntestified that a shortage of pollworkers was her “biggest worry” concerning the No-\nvember election, and that such relief would aid officials in ameliorating that prob-\nlem.   \nUnsurprisingly, then, the WEC—the agency charged with administering \nWisconsin’s election laws—has neither appealed nor objected to either item of relief.  \nBut the Wisconsin Legislature and several Republican Party entities intervened in \nthe district court, appealed its preliminary injunction, and sought a stay pending its \nappeal.  A divided panel of the Seventh Circuit granted the stay, but as Judge Rov-\nner’s dissent makes clear, that decision was manifestly erroneous and based on a \nfundamental misunderstanding of several lines of this Court’s precedent.  The stay \npending appeal should be vacated.   \nThis Court has repeatedly explained that a stay pending appeal is appropri-\nate only after considering the four equitable factors set forth in Nken v. Holder, 556 \nU.S. 418, 425-26 (2009):  likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm to the \nmovant, harm to other parties, and the public interest.  The court of appeals stayed \n2 \n\n \nthe district court’s injunction pending appeal without considering any of those fac-\ntors.  The court of appeals erred for three reasons.   \nFirst, the court of appeals badly misapplied this Court’s decision in Purcell v. \nGonzalez, 549 U.S. 1 (2006) (per curiam), reading that decision to create a hard-and-\nfast rule that any judicial alteration of election laws within several months of elec-\ntion day is improper.  Obviously, that is not what Purcell (or any other precedent) \nholds.  Purcell establishes the principle that courts should be wary of altering elec-\ntion rules close in time to elections when such changes would cause voter confusion \nand make voters less likely to vote.  Frank v. Walker, 574 U.S. 929 (2014), on which \nthe panel heavily relied, underscores the point.  That case lifted a stay where the \nchange in state law requiring photo ID would have resulted in voter confusion—\n“absentee ballots ha[d] been sent out without any notation that proof of photo iden-\ntification must be submitted.”  Id. at 929 (Alito, J., dissenting).  But here, the dis-\ntrict court expressly considered, as a factual matter, whether its relief is likely to \nlead to voter confusion or disenfranchisement, and the court concluded it would not.  \nPurcell requires appellate deference to that sort of factfinding, but the court of ap-\npeals completely ignored it.   \nThere is, moreover, no reasonable likelihood of voter confusion from the relief \nat issue here.  The district court’s extension of the ballot receipt deadline cannot \ncause voter confusion or disenfranchisement because it has no effect on the dead-\nlines applicable to voters—the district court found as a factual matter that the bal-\nlots of a substantial number of voters who follow all of Wisconsin’s rules will arrive \n3 \n\n \nafter the current receipt deadline because of conditions caused by the pandemic, \nand the district court’s relief will allow timely cast ballots slowed down by these \nsubstantial pandemic-related delays to be counted.  The district court’s injunction of \nthe pollworker county-residence requirement, meanwhile, has no effect on voters at \nall, since voters do not know or care where the people who work at their polls live.  \nVoters care only that the polls they were supposed to go to are open on election day \nand, during a pandemic, that social distancing is possible at those polls.  The dis-\ntrict court’s order will help the WEC and local election officials achieve those goals, \nas the WEC Administrator, Wisconsin’s chief election official, herself testified.  The \ncourt of appeals, of course, examined none of this because it thought September was \ntoo close to November.  That error is reason enough to vacate the stay. \nSecond, the court of appeals erroneously read this Court’s cases—and, in par-\nticular, Justice Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion in Andino v. Middleton, No. 20A55, \n2020 WL 5887393 (U.S. Oct. 5, 2020)—to require absolute deference to the Legisla-\nture on matters of election administration.  But there is no such rule—if election \nrules will result in substantial disenfranchisement such that they fail the test es-\ntablished in this Court’s decisions in Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983), \nand Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428 (1992), they must be declared unconstitution-\nal even though they were enacted by a legislature.  The point Justice Kavanaugh \nwas making in Andino was that the South Carolina legislature had specifically con-\nsidered how to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic—in that case, by extending ab-\nsentee voting—and that courts should respect its legislative choices and compromis-\n4 \n\n \nes about the particulars of the response.  But the Wisconsin Legislature has never \neven considered how to ensure safe voting during the pandemic, so there is no \nchoice or compromise requiring special judicial deference. \nThird, the court of appeals simply failed to consider the Nken factors, such as \nthe Legislature’s likelihood of success on the merits on appeal and its irreparable \nharm.  That failure is another independent reason for vacatur.  And for the reasons \nexplained below, application of those factors makes clear that the district court’s \nlimited injunction was entirely justified, and no stay is warranted.  In fact, it’s not \neven close. \nThe Application to vacate the stay should be granted. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nIn a split decision, a panel of the Seventh Circuit stayed a district court order \nenjoining several provisions of Wisconsin law that, the district court found, will se-\nverely burden the right to vote in the November General Election, as the COVID-19 \npandemic surges in Wisconsin.  Two aspects of the district court’s now-stayed relief \nare at issue here:  (i) an extension by six days of Wisconsin’s absentee-ballot-receipt \ndeadline, Wis. Stat. § 6.87(6), which (if not extended) is virtually certain to disen-\nfranchise tens of thousands of voters who timely request and cast their ballots; and \n(ii) an injunction of Wisconsin’s prohibition of inter-county sharing of pollworkers, \nWis. Stat. § 7.30(2), which denies municipalities flexibility to address pollworker \nshortages and avoid mass polling place closures, as happened in April.   \nThe district court’s order was based on a voluminous record.  The court had \nbefore it testimony from state and local election officials on the impact of COVID-19 \n5 \n\n \non Wisconsin’s election processes, numerous expert reports and depositions, well \nover a hundred declarations from voters and organizations, and direct experience \nwith similar relief in April.  The court heard argument and took testimony from the \nState’s chief election officer—Administrator of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, \nMeagan Wolfe—at a day-long evidentiary hearing.  And the court issued detailed \nfindings of fact and conclusions of law after reviewing roughly 1,000 pages of brief-\ning.  Giving these findings the “deference” they are “owed,” Purcell, 549 U.S. at 5, \nthe facts relevant to the instant motion are as follows: \nA.  Wisconsin’s April 7, 2020 Primary \nCOVID-19 is a novel respiratory illness that has now killed more than \n200,000 Americans and nearly 1 million people globally.  See App.41a-42a; see also \nS. Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 140 S. Ct. 1613 (2020) (Roberts, J., \nconcurring).  Experts “agree that COVID-19 is mainly spread via person-to-person, \nrespiratory droplets,” largely “between people who are in close contact with one an-\nother.”  App.41a-42a.  COVID-19 “first started to spread in Wisconsin in February \nand March,” and the Governor declared a statewide emergency “within just a few \nweeks of Wisconsin’s April 7, 2020, primary election.”  Id.   \nThe emerging pandemic caused widespread “concern about the state’s ability \nto conduct a fair and safe election,” App.42a-43a, because Wisconsin’s election \nsystem is “primarily designed to support polling place voting.”  App.47a.  \n“Historically, the vast majority of Wisconsin voters have cast their ballots in person, \nand Wisconsin’s election system has evolved against that backdrop, with provisions \nfor absentee voting having served as a courtesy for the minority of voters whose \n6 \n\n \nwork, travel, or other individual circumstances presented an obstacle to voting in \nperson on election day.”  App.16a (Rovner, J., dissenting).  Thus, almost all ballots \nare cast in person, with absentee votes virtually “never compris[ing] more than 20% \nof all ballots” and “often … less than 10%,” App.47a.   \nBut the sudden emergence of COVID-19 “turn[ed] historic voter patterns on \ntheir head” in the April election, App.52a, causing demand for absentee ballots to \nskyrocket and in-person voting to plummet, see App.42a-45a, 47a.  Indeed, almost \nimmediately, “clerks reported they were running out of absentee ballot materials \nand felt overwhelmed by the volume of absentee ballot requests.”  App.42a-43a, 47a. \nAfter the Legislature refused to postpone the April election, “three lawsuits \nwere … filed with [the district] court requesting various relief relating to Wiscon-\nsin’s impending primary.”  App.43a.  Among other relief, the district court enjoined \nenforcement of Wis. Stat. § 6.87(6), which requires “that absentee ballots must be \nreceived by 8:00 p.m. on election day,” and extended the absentee-ballot receipt \ndeadline by six days.  DNC v. Bostelmann, 2020 WL 1638374, at *22 (W.D. Wis. \nApr. 2, 2020) (“DNC”).  As here, the Legislature moved for an emergency stay.  On \nApril 3, 2020—just four days before Wisconsin’s spring election—the Seventh Cir-\ncuit refused to stay that portion of the district court’s order “extend[ing] the dead-\nline for receipt of absentee ballots to 4:00 p.m. on April 13, 2020.”  DNC v. Bostel-\nmann, 2020 WL 3619499, at *1 (7th Cir. 2020) (“DNC II”).   \nOn April 6, 2020—the day before Wisconsin’s spring primary—this Court \nmodified the district court’s order by requiring that late-arriving ballots be post-\n7 \n\n \nmarked by election day, RNC, 140 S. Ct. at 120, but did not disturb the extended \nballot-receipt deadline.   \nThe district court’s order extending the ballot-receipt deadline (as modified \nby this Court) was a massive success.  It “resulted in approximately 80,000 ballots \nbeing counted that would have otherwise been rejected as untimely.”  App.49a.  Un-\ndisputed testimony from Wisconsin’s chief elections officer also establishes “that \nelection officials were able to meet all post-election canvassing deadlines notwith-\nstanding this court’s six-day extension of the deadline in April, and the extension \ngave election officials time to tabulate and report election results more efficiently \nand accurately.”  App.82a-83a.  The district court thus noted that the extension of \nthe “election day receipt requirement actually furthered the state’s interest in com-\npleting its canvass.”  App.82a. \nBut not every aspect of the spring election was so successful.  In addition to \n“unprecedented” breakdowns in the absentee-voting process that were only partially \nremedied by the district court’s order, see App.44a-51a, “severe” poll worker “short-\nages” forced last-minute polling-site closures in many jurisdictions, App.47a.  “Mil-\nwaukee was only able to open five of its usual 180 polling sites, and Green bay re-\nduced its usual 31 polling sites to just 2.”  App.48a.  “[S]ome individuals had to wait \nin long lines, sometimes for hours before being allowed to vote,” while others—\n“concerned about safety and confronted with long lines”—simply gave up and “did \nnot cast their vote” at all, App.47a-49a.  \n8 \n\n \nB.  The Worsening Pandemic and November 3, 2020 General Elec-\ntion \n1.  Since April, the pandemic has gotten worse—much worse, in fact. \nApp.51a.  Indeed, “it is only now that Wisconsin is facing crisis-level conditions.”  \nApp.13a (Rovner, J., dissenting).  “[N]ew infections are surging in Wisconsin and \nthreatening to overwhelm the State’s hospitals.”  Id.  “Hospitalization rates are at \nrecord highs,” and “the State is now proceeding with plans to open a field hospital to \naddress the shortage of hospital beds.”  App.21a.  This chart, from the Milwaukee \nJournal Sentinel,1 says it all: \n \n                                            \n1 Available at https://projects.jsonline.com/topics/coronavirus/tracking/covid-19-\ncases-testing-and-deaths-in-wisconsin.html (last accessed October 12, 2020). \n9 \n\n \n2.  Confronted with an accelerating pandemic, the Swenson Plaintiffs (Appli-\ncants here), asked the district court in June to enjoin certain requirements of Wis-\nconsin law, and to require that Defendants implement a series of measures to en-\nsure safe and effective voting.  Three other plaintiff groups also sought relief.  The \ndistrict court granted Applicants’ request in only two respects:  (i) it extended the \nballot-receipt deadline, as it had in April, but retained the existing “postmarked by” \ndeadline as required by this Court; and (ii) it enjoined Wisconsin’s county-residence \nrequirement.  As to those forms of relief, the district court made the following factu-\nal findings: \na.  Not only was there “no evidence” that the problems plaguing absentee vot-\ning in the April election “have or will be resolved in advance of the November elec-\ntion,” evidence of an even broader breakdown is mounting:   \n•  roughly “2 million individuals” are expected to vote absentee in November, \na million more than led to statewide dysfunction in April, App.79a;  \n•  “the record establishes that the USPS’s delivery of mail has slowed” since \nApril and the carrier “will undoubtedly be overwhelmed” in November, \nApp.80a; and  \n•  the WEC itself “acknowledges that the unprecedented numbers of absen-\ntee voters” will be “very challenging” to manage without an extension, \neven “despite their best efforts to prepare” for the “record volume of ab-\nsentee ballots,” id.   \n10 \n\n \nAbsent an extension of the ballot-receipt deadline identical to that in April, the \ncourt found, the number of voters who would be disenfranchised through no fault of \ntheir own “could well exceed 100,000.”  App.83a; see DNC v. Bostelmann (“DNC \nECF”), No. 20-249 (W.D. Wis.), ECF No. 475:33-34 (WEC Commissioner Jacobs not-\ning that “several hundred thousand voters” would be disenfranchised). \nb.  The district court separately enjoined enforcement of Wisconsin’s county \nresidence requirement, Wis. Stat. § 7.30(2), which requires election officials to be \n“qualified elector[s] of a county in which the municipality where the official serves is \nlocated.”  See App.91a-92a.  In April, the requirement meant that “local municipali-\nties struggled to recruit and retain sufficient poll workers,” leaving in-person voting \n“severely limited.”  App.91a.  And “even with substantially greater warning and op-\nportunity to plan,” shortages persisted in Wisconsin’s recent and “much smaller” \nAugust Partisan Primary.  Id.  In fact, Wisconsin’s chief election officer “testified \nthat her biggest worry in the administration of the November election is a lack of \npoll workers for in-person voting on election day.”  Id. (emphasis added).  Enjoining \nthe county-resident requirement was necessary, the court found, to “provide greater \nflexibility across the state to meet unanticipated last-minute demands for staffing \ndue to COVID-19 outbreaks or fear.”  Id.  The injunction also would allow effective \nallocation of the National Guard, should the Governor elect to employ that option in \nNovember.  Id. \nc.  Notably, the district court was “mindful” of Purcell, making specific find-\nings as to “the risk that any of its actions may create confusion on the part of voters, \n11 \n\n \neither directly or indirectly, by creating additional burdens on the WEC and local \nofficials.”  App.67a.  In particular, the district court found that issuing its decision \nsix weeks before the election would “ameliorate” any risk of voter confusion and \n“provide sufficient time for the WEC and local election officials to implement any \nmodifications to existing election laws, and to communicate those changes to vot-\ners.”  Id. \n3.  Having acted so far in advance of the November election, the district court \nwas able to stay its order for seven days to provide an opportunity for emergency \nappeal.  App.101a.  The WEC—the entity charged with the power to administer \nelections in the State—did not appeal or otherwise object to the district court’s rem-\nedies.  But the Legislature and two Republican Party entities that had intervened \nin the district court filed emergency stay motions in the Seventh Circuit.  The Sev-\nenth Circuit initially held that both movants lacked standing to appeal, holding as \nto the Legislature that state law did not grant it authority to litigate as the State’s \nagent and thus that it lacked standing under this Court’s decision in Virginia House \nof Delegates v. Bethune-Hill, 139 S. Ct. 1945 (2019).  See DNC v. Bostelmann, 2020 \nWL 5796311 (7th Cir. 2020). \nThe Legislature filed a motion for certification, asking the Seventh Circuit to \ncertify the standing question to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.  When the panel de-\nnied the motion, the Legislature filed an en banc petition, requesting in part that \nthe en banc court certify the same question.  While its en banc petition was pending, \nthe Legislature filed an original action in the Wisconsin Supreme Court (naming \n12 \n\n \nonly one of the parties in the federal proceedings as respondent) asking that court to \nissue an opinion reversing the Seventh Circuit panel’s construction of state law.  \nTreating the Legislature’s en banc petition as a petition for panel rehearing, the \nSeventh Circuit certified the question to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, noting that \nthe delay would not be prejudicial to either side because “[n]one of the district \ncourt’s orders require[d] substantive action before October 15.”2  The Wisconsin Su-\npreme Court held that the Legislature was authorized to act as the State’s agent to \ndefend the constitutionality of state law, DNC v. Bostelmann, 2020 WL 5906141 \n(Wis. Oct. 6, 2020), which meant in turn that the Legislature had Article III stand-\ning. \n4.  On return from the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the Seventh Circuit grant-\ned the Legislature’s motion for a stay.  The panel majority offered two reasons.  \nFirst, although the court of appeals had refused to stay an extension of the ballot-\nreceipt deadline just four days before Wisconsin’s April election, the panel here felt \nbound by this Court’s decision in Purcell because the district court entered its in-\njunction “only” six weeks before the election.  App.3a.  Second, based largely on Jus-\ntice Kavanaugh’s concurrence in Andino, the panel held that the design of electoral \nprocedures during the pandemic is exclusively “a legislative task.”  App.4a.  The \n                                            \n2 The closest-in-time relief that the district court ordered was a one-week extension \nof the October 14, 2020 deadline for online and mail-in registration, as sought by \nthe DNC.  App.2a.  The Seventh Circuit stayed that relief, along with the rest of the \ndistrict court’s order, App.2a-3a, and the DNC does not intend to seek to vacate that \nportion of the Seventh Circuit’s stay in this Court.    \n13 \n\n \npanel majority’s short opinion did not address the district court’s relief as to the \ncounty-residence requirement, calling it relief that “need not be described.”  App.2a. \nJudge Rovner issued a lengthy dissent, lamenting the panel’s decision as a \n“travesty” whose “inevitable result will be that many thousands of Wisconsin citi-\nzens will lose their right to vote despite doing everything they reasonably can to ex-\nercise it.”   App.8a (Rovner, J., dissenting).  The majority’s decision, Judge Rovner \nexplained, was “inconsistent both with the stated rationale of Purcell and with the \nAnderson-Burdick framework.”  Id.  As to Purcell, the panel majority failed to \n“evaluate all of the factors that bear on the prosperity of judicial intervention …, \nincluding in particular the possibility of voter confusion,” which is entirely absent \nhere.  Id. at 8a-13a.  Judge Rovner also criticized the majority’s misapplication of \nAndino, explaining that “what the majority proposes is total deference to state offi-\ncials in the context of pandemic, with no degree of judicial scrutiny at all.”  Id. at \n14a.  Such deference is particularly unwarranted here, Judge Rovner reasoned, be-\ncause the officials “charged with enforcing Wisconsin’s election rules” do not oppose \nthe district court’s order, id., while the state Legislature has undertaken no efforts \nto accommodate voting during the pandemic, id. at 14a-16a, “leav[ing] voters at the \nmercy of overworked state and local election officials, a hamstrung Postal Service, \nand a merciless virus,” id. at 27a.  “Good luck and G-d bless, Wisconsin,” Judge \nRovner concluded.  App.32a.  “You are going to need it.”  Id.   \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nThis Court may vacate a stay if the court below “demonstrably erred in its \napplication of accepted standards.”  Planned Parenthood of Greater Tx. Surgical \n14 \n\n \nHealth Servs. v. Abbot, 571 U.S. 1061 (2013) (Scalia, J., concurring) (quotations \nomitted); see also W. Airlines, Inc. v. Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 480 U.S. 1301, 1305 \n(1987) (O’Connor, J., in chambers).  The standards applicable to the Seventh Cir-\ncuit’s stay decision—which went unmentioned in the panel’s opinion—are those set \nout in Nken: (1) whether the movant (here, the Legislature) made a strong showing \nthat it was likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the movant would have been \nirreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether a stay would substantially injure oth-\ner parties; and (4) the public interest.  556 U.S. at 434.  The first two factors are the \n“most critical.”  Id. \n “[I]n addition to the harms attendant upon issuance or nonissuance of an in-\njunction,” this Court has also instructed courts of appeals in election-law cases to \nweigh “considerations specific to [those] cases and [their] own institutional proce-\ndures.”  Purcell, 549 U.S. at 4.  Orders modifying state election laws must not \n“themselves result in voter confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from \nthe polls.”  Id. at 4-5.  And this Court has admonished courts of appeals to mind \ntheir own institutional limitations, and accord proper deference to district court \nfactfinding and discretion.  Id. at 5-6.  In recent cases, moreover, at least one mem-\nber of this Court has suggested exercising greater caution where the state legisla-\nture has specifically considered a question and exercised its legislative judgment as \nto the details of how to resolve it.  See Andino, 2020 WL 5887393, at *1 (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., concurring).  In no case, however, has this Court ever set forth a hard-\n15 \n\n \nand-fast rule against judicial action to protect the right to vote.  See, e.g., RNC v. \nCommon Cause R.I., 2020 WL 4680151 (U.S. Aug. 13, 2020). \nREASONS FOR VACATING THE STAY \nI.  THE  PANEL  DEMONSTRABLY  ERRED  IN  ITS  APPLICATION  OF \nTHIS COURT’S ELECTION-LAW CASES. \nThe panel decision did not apply the traditional stay factors (which itself is \ndemonstrable error).  Instead, the panel overread this Court’s cases to erect two in-\ndependent barriers to judicial relief in advance of an election.  First, the panel con-\nstrued Purcell to mean that federal courts may never “change electoral rules close to \nan election.”  App.3a.  Second, the panel held that addressing the problems posed by \nthe COVID-19 pandemic is solely a legislative task—even if, in the absence of legis-\nlative action, the fundamental right to vote would be severely burdened.  App.4a-6a.  \nThis Court has never endorsed either proposition, and the panel demonstrably erred \nin its application of this Court’s cases.   \nA.  The Panel’s Decision Conflicts With Purcell. \nAlthough the Seventh Circuit refused to stay identical relief just four days be-\nfore Wisconsin’s spring primary, see DNC II, 2020 WL 3619499, at *1, the panel \nhere held that Purcell foreclosed relief outright.  The sum and substance of the pan-\nel’s reasoning was that the election is in November, and the district court issued its \ndecision six weeks before election day.  The panel did not acknowledge that Appli-\ncants sought a preliminary injunction on June 26.   The panel did not acknowledge, \nlet alone address, the district court’s undisputed findings that the concerns animat-\ning Purcell are not present on this record—trial court findings that Purcell itself \n16 \n\n \nheld must be accorded deference.  Nor did the panel consider the likelihood of voter \nconfusion and any consequent incentive for voters to stay away from the polls.  And \nfor the reasons explained below, there is no such likelihood, particularly as to the \ntwo aspects of relief at issue in this Application.  The panel’s decision, in other \nwords, conflicts directly with Purcell.   \n1.  In Purcell, this Court reversed in part because the court of appeals’ deci-\nsion failed to “give deference to the discretion” and “factual findings” of the district \ncourt.  549 U.S. at 5.   The panel majority made exactly the same error here.   \nThe district court here specifically addressed Purcell’s concern regarding “the \nrisk that any of its actions may create confusion on the part of voters,” and found \nthat issuing its decision six weeks “in advance” of the election would “ameliorate \nthat risk” by giving the WEC and local election officials “sufficient time … to im-\nplement any modifications to existing election laws, and to communicate those \nchanges to voters.”  App.67a.  These factual findings are fully consistent with Pur-\ncell, which itself acknowledged that the farther away the election, the lower the \nrisk.  549 U.S. at 5.  “Of all” the judges in this case, “Judge Conley is the one judge \nwho heard the evidence first-hand and is closest to the ground in Wisconsin.”  \nApp.22a (Rovner, J., dissenting); see id. at 11a (“Judge Conley gave careful atten-\ntion to whether state election officials would have the time and ability to implement \nthe changes he ordered.”).  Under Purcell, the panel “owed deference” to his find-\nings.  549 U.S. at 7.  Yet the panel ignored them completely, finding for itself—\nbased on no supporting evidence—that six weeks out was just “too close.”  App.4a.  \n17 \n\n \nBecause “[t]here has been no explanation given by the Court of Appeals showing the \nruling and findings of the District Court to be incorrect,” the panel clearly and de-\nmonstrably erred in its application of Purcell, 549 U.S. at 8. \n2.  The panel’s failure to account for the district court’s factual findings \nflowed from a broader legal error:  the panel appears to have read Purcell to impose \na hard stop on any relief in “close” proximity to an election, regardless the relief at \nissue.  Purcell held no such thing.  As Judge Rovner correctly observed, “Purcell ar-\nticulated not a rule but a caution:  take care with last-minute changes to a state’s \nelection rules, lest voters become confused and discouraged from voting.”  App.8a \n(Rovner, J., dissenting).  Thus, as Judge Sutton has explained, while the imminence \nof an election will “often” counsel a federal court to stay its hand, “[t]hat will not al-\nways be the case.  This generalization surely does not control many election-related \ndisputes—keeping polls open past their established times on election day or altering \nthe rules for casting ballots … during election week[.]”  Ohio Rep. Party v. Brunner, \n544 F.3d 711, 718 (6th Cir. 2008) (en banc) (opinion of Sutton, J.) (emphasis al-\ntered), vacated on other grounds by 555 U.S. 5 (2008).  The question in any election-\nlaw case—as it was in Purcell—is simply whether the risk of “voter confusion” out-\nweighs the public’s “strong interest in exercising the fundamental political right to \nvote.”  Purcell, 549 U.S. at 3-5 (quotations omitted).  \nNor have any of this Court’s cases since Purcell suggested a strict two-\nmonths-before-election-day deadline for district court rulings changing voting re-\nquirements.  The Seventh Circuit believed that Frank did so, but there was no sug-\n18 \n\n \ngestion in Frank that the district court’s injunction against Wisconsin’s voter identi-\nfication law—which issued well before Election Day—had come too late.  See Frank \nv. Walker, 17 F. Supp. 3d 837 (E.D. Wis. 2014).  If anything, it was the Seventh Cir-\ncuit’s stay of the district court’s injunction that was too late in that case, not the dis-\ntrict court’s injunction itself, especially since the stay was likely to result in voter \nconfusion.  See 574 U.S. at 929 (Alito, J., dissenting).  And this Court did not hesi-\ntate to vacate that stay, even in the second week of October.  Since Frank, this \nCourt has routinely altered the terms of an election far closer in time to election day \nthan would be necessary in this case.  A week after Frank was issued in 2014, this \nCourt denied an application to vacate a stay of a permanent injunction against a \nTexas voter ID law.  Veasey v. Perry, 135 S. Ct. 9, 9-10 (2014).  Because the State \nhad already taken steps to comply with the injunction, the effect of this Court’s de-\ncision was to change an election procedure just 17 days before an election.  Id. at 10-\n11 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).  Likewise in Brakebill v. Jaeger, 139 S. Ct. 10 (2018), \nthis Court denied an application to vacate an Eighth Circuit stay, the effect of \nwhich was to upend the status quo rules about voter identification that had been in \nplace since the preceding primary election.  See Brakebill v. Jaeger, 2018 WL \n1612190 (D.N.D. Apr. 3, 2018). \nAnd not one of those cases featured the sort of “last-minute event” that the \nSeventh Circuit suggested would be necessary to adjust voting rules within two \nmonths of election day.  To the contrary:  the ever-evolving COVID-19 pandemic \nand USPS crisis that motivated the district court’s injunction in this case are far \n19 \n\n \ncloser to “last-minute event[s]” than any concerns about the voter ID requirements \nin Frank, Veasey, and Brakebill.  This Court’s cases thus make clear that the timing \nof relief in a voting-rights case is just one of several factors that bear on whether ju-\ndicial intervention is necessary. \n3.  The panel majority, however, failed to “evaluate” any “of the factors that \nbear on the propriety of judicial intervention” close to an election, “including in par-\nticular the possibility of voter confusion.”  App.10a (Rovner, J., dissenting).  As ex-\nplained, supra at 13, 16, the panel’s decision was based on timing alone.  Had the \npanel addressed the concerns animating Purcell as to the two forms of relief at issue \nhere, it would have had no trouble concluding that a stay was not warranted (exact-\nly as it held in April). \nBallot-receipt deadline.  While some court orders no doubt can result in voter \nconfusion and disenfranchisement, it is difficult to comprehend how the extension of \na ballot-receipt deadline—for ballots mailed in accordance with the deadlines set \nforth in Wisconsin law and unaltered by the district court—could possibly yield that \nresult.  See App.10a-11a (Rovner, J., dissenting).  As with court orders keeping polls \nopen, the only possible consequence of the district court’s order is the enfranchise-\nment of more Wisconsin voters who mark, sign, witness, and mail their ballots by \nelection day.  Id.  Indeed, “the results of the April election in Wisconsin demonstrate \nthat only in the absence of judicial intervention will voters be disenfranchised.”  \nApp.11a-12a (Rovner, J., dissenting).  And the conclusion that the district court’s \nmodest extension of the ballot-receipt deadline will not harm the election process is \n20 \n\n \nfurther bolstered by the conduct of state election officials, who “signaled a prepar-\nedness and ability to comply with [this] modification[.]”  App.11a (Rovner, J., dis-\nsenting); see id. at 7a (state election officials do not “complain[] of any undue burden \nimposed by the district court’s decision or any risk of voter confusion”); see also \nCommon Cause, 2020 WL 4680151, at *1 (refusing to grant a stay where “no state \n[election] official has expressed opposition”). \nCounty-residence requirement.  There is no plausible Purcell concern with the \ndistrict court’s order enjoining the county-residence requirement, nor has one ever \nbeen articulated.  It obviously will not confuse voters, who do not decide whether to \nvote based on pollworkers’ counties of residence.  See App.11a (Rovner, J., dissent-\ning) (changes “directed to election officials and what they must do …. [b]y their na-\nture … will not impact voter decisions”).  Purcell considerations actually cut the \nother way:  the injunction means that fewer polling places will be consolidated at \nthe last minute, allowing designated polling places to open as they normally would \nand alleviating voter confusion.  “Perhaps as a result, the [Legislature] make[s] no \nclaim that” this aspect of the district court’s order “will cause a decrease in election \nparticipation.”  Common Cause Rhode Island v. Gorbea, 970 F.3d 11, 17 (1st Cir. \n2020), stay denied by Common Cause, 2020 WL 4680151; see also App.31a (Rovner, \nJ., dissenting) (“The Legislature has articulated no reason why this accommodation \nis either unnecessary or inappropriate.”). \n4.  A final note about Purcell.  In the scant few cases in which this Court has \ndiscussed Purcell, see App.8a-10a (Rovner, J., dissenting), it has always character-\n21 \n\n \nized the decision as holding that “federal courts should ordinarily not alter the elec-\ntion rules on the eve of an election.”  RNC, 140 S. Ct. at 1207 (emphasis added).  \nBut these are extraordinary circumstances.  The world is in the midst of a once-in-a-\nlifetime pandemic caused by a virus that spreads most easily in the conditions in \nwhich we usually vote.  As a consequence, millions of voters, at the encouragement \nof the State, have turned to voting by mail, even while the Postal Service is ham-\npered by delays.  Whatever the rule for ordinary circumstances, Purcell has precious \nlittle to say about the circumstances here.  If anything, Purcell’s reasoning should \nsupport the relief ordered by the district court.  As Judge Conley made clear in his \nopinion, and as Judge Rovner reiterated in her dissent, this relief is designed to \nprevent voter confusion and disenfranchisement caused by these extraordinary cir-\ncumstances.  It is thus entirely consistent with the reasoning of Purcell.  \nPerhaps recognizing as much, the panel suggested that Purcell might allow \nfor judicial relief in response to a “last-minute event.”  App.4a.  But Purcell plainly \ndid not articulate such a rule, nor would one make sense.  Why should federal \ncourts be required to countenance widespread disenfranchisement simply because \nthe conditions in Wisconsin giving rise to that disenfranchisement may have started \na few months back?  The precise timing of the onset of the virus is not what \nmatters; it is how the virus is interacting with the electoral process in Wisconsin at \nthe time of the election that does.  After all, while the virus itself is not new, \n“neither is it a static phenomenon.”  App.13a (Rovner, J., dissenting).  “[I]t is only \nnow that Wisconsin is facing crisis-level conditions,” id., with thousands more new \n22 \n\n \ndaily cases than during the April election, supra at 9.  Things have gotten so bad \nthat the State is “open[ing] a field hospital to address the shortage of hospital beds,” \nand yet in the face of legislative abdication, see infra at 23-25, the Seventh Circuit \nsaid that federal courts were powerless to act.  And the circumstances surrounding \nthe general election are new:  “unprecedented numbers of absentee voters,” \nApp.80a, a hobbled Postal Service, and difficulty recruiting sufficient numbers of \npollworkers to open enough polls to allow for safe voting.   As Judge Rovner aptly \nsummarized:  “Nothing in Purcell or its progeny forecloses modifications of the kind \nthe district court ordered as the election draws nigh.  Otherwise, courts would never \nbe able to order relief addressing late-developing circumstances that threaten \ninterference with the right to vote.”  App.13a (Rovner, J., dissenting).   \nB.  There Is No Principle Of Absolute Legislative Deference. \nThe panel also overread this Court’s recent cases addressing the COVID-19 \npandemic as precluding judicial intervention in deference to “the policymaking \nbranches of government.”  App.5a.  But as Judge Rovner rightly pointed out, this \nCourt has never endorsed a policy of “total deference to state officials in the context \nof [the] pandemic, with no degree of scrutiny at all.”  App.14a (Rovner, J., dissent-\ning).  The panel misapplied this Court’s cases. \n1.  This case has virtually nothing in common with Andino, on which the \npanel principally relied.  In Andino, the South Carolina legislature had just con-\ncluded a legislative session in which it specifically modified the State’s election laws \nin light of COVID-19, “most notably allowing all South Carolina voters to vote ab-\nsentee.”  Emergency Application for Stay, Andino v. Middleton, No. 20A55 at 4-5 \n23 \n\n \n(U.S. Oct. 1, 2020).  But while the legislature “debated eliminating the witness re-\nquirement,” it ultimately declined to do so, exercising its legislative judgment that \nretaining the witness requirement was necessary to deter and police voter fraud.  \nId. at 5.  Against that backdrop, Justice Kavanaugh reasoned that the “State legis-\nlature’s decision either to keep or to make changes to election rules to address \nCOVID-19” should be respected.  Andino, 2020 WL 5887393, at *1.   \nHere, by contrast, none of the relief presents voter fraud concerns,3 and the \nLegislature did not even consider making “accommodations in the election rules to \naccount for the burdens created by the pandemic,” App.7a-8a (Rovner, J., dissent-\ning), even though “[t]he State itself purports to want people to vote absentee,” id. at \n28a.  While Andino and many of this Court’s other precedents suggest that the exer-\ncise of legislative judgment is due deference, no case or plausible legal principle \ncounsels deference in the absence of such judgment:  courts cannot “blindly defer to \na state legislature that sits on its hands while a pandemic rages.”  Id. at 32a; see al-\nso id. at 27a.  \nIt bears emphasizing as well that “South Carolina’s entire government ob-\nject[ed] to the district court’s injunction” in Andino, Andino Stay Application at 23, \nproviding further proof that the witness requirement at issue there really was the \n                                            \n3 The Legislature has never argued that extending the ballot-receipt deadline or al-\nlowing cross-county sharing of pollworkers will lead to fraud, and the district court \nimposed a “postmarked by” requirement to address this Court’s concerns in RNC.   \n24 \n\n \nproduct of reasoned judgment.  Again, just the opposite is true here: no state elec-\ntion official opposes the modest relief ordered by the district court.  See infra at 26.4  \n2.  To the extent the panel believed any of this Court’s other COVID-19 deci-\nsions required a stay, it was badly mistaken. \na.  Although the question whether to stay the district court’s extension of the \nballot-receipt deadline was not before this Court in April, see RNC, 140 S. Ct. at \n1206, that litigation provides a natural experiment against which to test the Legis-\nlature’s (unsubstantiated) claims.5  The district court found that a six-day extension \nof the ballot-receipt deadline, as modified by this Court’s RNC decision, enfran-\nchised 80,000 voters.  It is undisputed that the November general election will have \nsignificantly higher turnout, so if April is any guide, a stay would effectively disen-\nfranchise 100,000 voters or more, as the district court found.  Supra at 11.  By con-\ntrast, the Legislature adduced no evidence that the April extension caused “voter \nconfusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the polls.”  Purcell, 549 \nU.S. at 4-5.  One would expect the Legislature to have marshalled this evidence if it \nin fact existed, but throughout this litigation the Legislature has taken the opposite \nposition—i.e., that the April election was a major success, with “unprecedented” and \n“extraordinarily high” voter turnout.  See DNC ECF No. 454 at 13.  The April elec-\ntion also refutes the Legislature’s claim of administrative burden.  In fact, the un-\n                                            \n4 Many of these same features distinguish this case from Merrill v. People First of \nAlabama, 2020 WL 3604049 (U.S. July 2, 2020). \n5 As Judge Rovner observed, while this Court did not directly confront the question, \n“had there been a substantial risk of confusing voters,” it is difficult to imagine that \nneither the Seventh Circuit nor this Court would have prevented the ballot-receipt-\ndeadline extension from going into effect in April.  App.11a (Rovner, J., dissenting).   \n25 \n\n \ndisputed evidence showed that the April extension relieved burdens on overworked \nelection officials.  Supra at 8; see Purcell, 549 U.S. at 7.   \nb.  Common Cause is also instructive.  As in Common Cause, “no state [elec-\ntion] official has expressed opposition” to the district court’s order.  2020 WL \n4680151, at *1.  That is a powerful reason to deny a stay.  It is also a good reason to \ndiscount the Legislature’s claim of administrative burdens, since the officials with \nactual experience administering Wisconsin elections do not share the Legislature’s \nview.  Supra at 12.  Their unique perspective “ought to count for something.”  \nApp.14a (Rovner, J., dissenting). \nc.  The Court’s remaining COVID-19 election cases are much farther afield.  \nUnlike in Texas Democratic Party v. Abbott, 140 S. Ct. 2015 (2020), for instance, \nwhere the Plaintiffs sought universal absentee voting under the 26th Amendment, \nPlaintiffs here do not request sweeping relief or rely on novel theories.  Consequent-\nly, Plaintiffs have a far greater likelihood of prevailing on the merits.  See infra Part \nII.  Indeed, Wisconsin already provides universal absentee voting; the relief here is \nsimply designed to make that option effective and ensure that in-person voting is \nsafe.  See id.  The same is true for this Court’s cases regarding ballot initiatives and \nsignature requirements:  Applicants have a far greater likelihood of success on the \nmerits.  See Little v. Reclaim Idaho, 140 S. Ct. 2616 (2020); Clarno v. People Not \nPoliticians Ore., 2020 WL 4589742 (U.S. Aug. 11, 2020); Thompson v. DeWine, 2020 \nWL 3456705 (U.S. June 25, 2020).  \n26 \n\n \nII.  THE LEGISLATURE FAILED TO MAKE A STRONG SHOWING OF \nLIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS. \nTo stay the district court’s order, the Legislature was required to make a \n“strong showing that it was likely to succeed on the merits.”  Planned Parenthood, \n571 U.S. at 506 (Scalia, J., concurring).  Yet the panel barely mentioned the merits \nof Plaintiffs’ claims at all, because it was laboring under the misimpression that the \ndistrict court was powerless to remedy Plaintiffs’ injuries, no matter how severe the \nburden on their fundamental right to vote.  Supra Part I.  Had the Seventh Circuit \nundertaken any serious analysis of the merits, it would have necessarily concluded \nthat the Legislature came nowhere close to undermining the district court’s thor-\nough analysis under Anderson-Burdick.   \nThat standard requires a court to weigh “the character and magnitude of the \nasserted injury to [voting] rights” against “the precise interests put forward by the \nState as justifications for the burden imposed.”  Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434 (quoting \nAnderson, 460 U.S. at 789).  Evaluating COVID-19’s “unique challenges to Wiscon-\nsin’s election system and burdens [on] Wisconsin voters,” the district court correctly \ngranted Applicants limited but crucial relief under the Anderson-Burdick frame-\nwork, extending Wisconsin’s absentee-ballot-receipt deadline by six days for ballots \npostmarked by election day and enjoining the county-residence requirement for \npollworkers.  App.67a.   \n27 \n\n \nA.  The  District  Court  Correctly  Extended  The  Absentee-Ballot \nReceipt Deadline By Six Days For Ballots Postmarked By Elec-\ntion Day. \nIn April, the district court extended the absentee-ballot receipt deadline by \nsix days, DNC, 2020 WL 1638374, at *20, *22, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed \nthat relief and denied a stay, DNC II, 2020 WL 3619499, at *1.  This Court added a \nrequirement that ballots be postmarked before or on election day to be counted, \nRNC, 140 S. Ct. at 1206-08, but the receipt-deadline extension itself went into effect \nin Wisconsin for the April election.  Again, “any objective view of the record” com-\npels “the inevitable conclusion” that the April extension vindicated “as many as \n80,000 voters’ rights.”  App.35a, 49a, 83a; see also App.7a (Rovner, J. dissenting) \n(“Only as a result of judicial intervention … were some 80,000 absentee ballots, \ntheir return delayed by an overwhelmed election apparatus and Postal Service, res-\ncued from the trash bin.”).  The district court issued exactly the same relief here, ex-\ntending the November ballot-receipt deadline by six days for ballots postmarked by \nelection day.  App.79a.   \nA central difficulty is that Wisconsin law authorizes voters to request an ab-\nsentee ballot by mail up until five days (Thursday) before election day, Wis. Stat. \n§ 6.86(1)(b), but requires all ballots to arrive at the polling place by 8 PM on election \nday, Wis. Stat. § 6.87(6).  However that scheme works in normal times, if election \nofficials are flooded with absentee-ballot requests or if USPS is overwhelmed—as \nthe district court found was “near certain”—many absentee ballots cannot be mailed \nout and received back by election day, even though the voter complied with state law.  \nApp.52a-53a, 80a-81a.    \n28 \n\n \nThat is what happened in April, and “there is no evidence to suggest that the \nfundamental causes of these problems have resolved or will be resolved in advance \nof the November election.”  App.80a.  For example, the “WEC is now projecting” that \nthe millions of absentee ballot requests in November will exceed “the number of ab-\nsentees by a factor of three for any prior general, presidential elections,” and exceed \n“by as much as a million the number … that overwhelmed election officials during \nthe April 2020 election.”  App.79a.  The WEC explains that “the unprecedented \nnumbers of absentee voters will again be very challenging for local election officials \nto manage.”  App.52a.  Making matters worse, there will be severe USPS delays in \nNovember, App.80a, creating a “high risk” that Wisconsin voters’ ballots will go un-\ncounted—even if requested far in advance of the statutory deadline.  App.53a; \nApp.45a, n.10 (“Administrator Wolfe testified that it may take 14 days for an absen-\ntee ballot to make its way through the mail from a clerk’s office to a voter and back \nagain.”).   \nThe Seventh Circuit failed to grapple with any of this, other than to suggest \nthat “any person who wants to avoid voting in person on Election Day” can do so “by \nplanning ahead,” and that the “district court did not find” that anyone other than \n“voters who wait until the last minute” would face problems voting absentee.  \nApp.4a-5a.  The Seventh Circuit’s cursory analysis cannot be reconciled with the \ndistrict court’s plain-as-day factfinding, the fundamental nature of the right to vote, \nor the reality of the pandemic. \n29 \n\n \nContrary to the Seventh Circuit’s assertion, the district court found that ab-\nsent an extension, “tens of thousands” of “prudent”—not procrastinating—voters \nwill not timely “receive [an absentee ballot], vote, and return it for receipt by mail \nbefore the election day deadline despite acting well in advance of the [legal] deadline \nfor requ[esting] a ballot.”  App.81a (emphasis added).  This is so because of “the \nsheer volume [of absentee ballots] expected this November,” straining the resources \nof both local election officials and USPS, “despite their best efforts to prepare for \nand manage this influx.”  App.80a.  And absentee ballot demand likely has only in-\ncreased since the district court’s decision in light of recent surge of the pandemic in \nWisconsin.  See supra at 9. \nFurther, Wisconsin cannot choose to provide mail-in voting—and strongly \n“urg[e]” “as many people as possible” to use that system during the pandemic, \nApp.52a—but then allow thousands of law-abiding voters to be disenfranchised, de-\nspite perfect compliance with Wisconsin’s statutory scheme.  See Price v. N.Y. State \nBd. of Elections, 540 F.3d 101, 110-12 (2d Cir. 2008).  Voting rights are severely \nburdened when voters are disenfranchised despite “follow[ing] the ostensible dead-\nline for their ballots only to discover that their votes would not be counted.”  Demo-\ncratic Exec. Comm. of Fla. v. Lee, 915 F.3d 1312, 1324-25 (11th Cir. 2019).  If a state \nprovides a vote-by-mail option, then it must ensure that option is effective—a con-\ntrary rule would effectively allow a state to deceive voters and lead to wide-scale \nvoter confusion and certain disenfranchisement.  See App.26a (Rovner, J. dissent-\ning) (“Voters do not run the State’s election apparatus or the U.S. Postal Service; \n30 \n\n \nthey have no special insight into how quickly their timely requests … will be pro-\ncessed by election officials and how quickly the Postal Service will deliver their bal-\nlots. … It is not reasonable to insist that voters act more quickly than state dead-\nlines require them to do in order to ensure that either the State or the Postal Ser-\nvice does not inadvertently disenfranchise them because they are overwhelmed.”). \nMoreover, voters who do not return their ballots a month in advance of the \nelection are not, as the Seventh Circuit seemed to think, procrastinating without \nreason; as the district court explained, it is “unreasonable to expect undecided vot-\ners to exercise their voting franchise by absentee ballot well before the end of the \npresidential campaign, especially when Wisconsin’s statutory deadline is giving \nthem a false sense of confidence in timely receipt.”  App.81a-82a.  Wisconsin’s sys-\ntem unlawfully sets up these massive swaths of “reasonabl[e]” rule-following voters \n“for failure in light of the near certain impacts of this ongoing pandemic.”  App.81a.  \nAnd the Seventh Circuit completely disregarded voters who submit early requests \nbut whose ballots are delayed through no fault of their own.  App.44a (finding that \n“numerous” voters timely—“often two or three weeks before the election”—\n“requested an absentee ballot but never received it or received it after election \nday”). \nThe Seventh Circuit’s suggestion that the Wisconsin statutory scheme has \nthe same effect “with or without a pandemic,” App.5a, perfectly captures its failure \nto come to terms with the record.  It is “[t]he strain that the pandemic and the sud-\nden, unprecedented preference for absentee voting place[s] on state and local offi-\n31 \n\n \ncials” and USPS—not the ordinary operation of Wisconsin law—that is likely to \ncause systemic disenfranchisement in November, absent extension of the ballot-\nreceipt deadline.  App.17a (Rovner, J. dissenting).  In normal circumstances, the \nvast majority of Wisconsin voters cast their ballots in person; the absentee system \nserves as a courtesy for a minority of voters who wish to make use of it.  App.47a \n(“Absentee votes never comprised more 20% of all ballots in recent past elections, \nand often, they represented less than 10% of ballots cast.”).  But the COVID-19 \npandemic upset this paradigm; as the district court found, absentee ballots com-\nprised 73.8% of ballots in the April 2020 election, and the numbers for November \nare expected to be record-shattering.  App.44a, 47a, 79a-80a.  Making matters \nworse, COVID-19 has severely impacted USPS, causing significant mail slowdowns.  \nApp.44a, 53a.  Thus, although the absentee-ballot receipt deadline “has worked for \nthe most part during a normal election cycle” without creating a significant backlog, \n“the same statutory deadline is likely to disenfranchise a significant number of vot-\ners in the November election.”  App.80a. \nThe same erroneous logic infected the Legislature’s suggestion below that \nvoters who experience any absentee-voting mailing or processing problems can \nsimply vote in person on election day.  Sure—in ordinary times.  But the Legisla-\nture’s argument ignores the real risks (and legitimate fear) that a once-in-a-century \npandemic, “which at present is surging in Wisconsin,” creates for in-person voting.  \nApp.16a (Rovner, J. dissenting); id. at 25a (“[H]aving in mind the shortfalls with the \nApril election and the current public health crisis posed by the pandemic, it is not \n32 \n\n \nunreasonable for Wisconsin voters to view the option of in-person … voting as a \nform of Russian roulette.”).  Absentee voting is now a crucial aspect of ensuring that \nvoting rights are not “severe[ly] restrict[ed]” on a widespread scale in the upcoming \nelection, Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434—as the State itself has recognized by urging Wis-\nconsin voters to vote absentee.  App.52a.  The Legislature further overlooks that, \nunder Wisconsin law, once a voter mails in her absentee ballot, she cannot then \nspoil that ballot and vote in person on election day—even if her ballot will be de-\nlayed in returning to the clerk’s office.  Wis. Stat. § 6.86(6).   \nIn the courts below, the Legislature principally argued that extending the \ndeadline undermines the State’s interest in promptly reporting election results.  \nLegislature’s Emergency Motion To Stay The Preliminary Injunction (“Leg. Emer-\ngency Mot.”), DNC v. Bostelmann, No. 20-2835 (7th Cir.) at 13.  As the district court \nfound, an interest in reporting election results more quickly cannot justify arbitrari-\nly disenfranchising tens of thousands of voters.  App.83a; see also App.29a (Rovner, \nJ. dissenting) (The Legislature’s “wish to have the results of the election conclusive-\nly determined on election night,” “weighed against the constitutional right to vote,” \n“is thin gruel.”).  Rather, prioritizing speed over accuracy would harm Wisconsin’s \n“valid interest in protecting the integrity and reliability of the electoral process.”  \nFrank v. Walker, 768 F.3d 744, 755 (7th Cir. 2014) (quotation omitted). \nThe Legislature’s argument, moreover, is directly refuted by the record.  The \nevidence before the district court showed that the district court’s relief in April “ac-\ntually furthered the state’s interest in completing its canvass.”  App.82a-83a.  As \n33 \n\n \nWEC Administrator Wolfe—who, unlike the Legislature, is the State’s actual expert \nelections official—testified, “election officials were able to meet all post-election \ncanvassing deadlines notwithstanding this court’s six-day extension of the deadline \nin April, and the extension gave election officials time to tabulate and report elec-\ntion results more efficiently and accurately.”  Id.  The Legislature offers no reason \nto expect a different result in November.  The Legislature also ignores that fourteen \nother states count timely-postmarked ballots that arrive in the days following the \nelection.  App.82a.  \nBecause Wisconsin’s ballot-receipt deadline is likely to systemically disen-\nfranchise voters in November—well over 100,000 voters, App.83a—and the State \nlacks any interest that could justify such massive disenfranchisement, the district \ncourt properly modified the statutory deadline.  The Seventh Circuit clearly erred in \nstaying that injunction despite the virtual certainty that doing so will result in \nthousands of voters being disenfranchised, through no fault of their own.   \nB.  The District Court Correctly Enjoined The County-Residence \nRequirement For Pollworkers. \nThe district court also enjoined Wis. Stat. § 7.30(2), which requires that each \npollworker be “a qualified elector of a county in which the municipality where the \nofficial serves is located.”  Yet the Seventh Circuit entirely ignored this relief in the \nopinion below, shrugging it off as a “smaller … provision[] of the injunction [that] \nneed not be described.”  App.2a.  That the Seventh Circuit would stay critical relief \nthat the district court—after meticulous factfinding—held necessary to avoid disen-\nfranchisement, and do so without even mentioning (let alone analyzing) the relief, \n34 \n\n \nunderscores the degree to which the Seventh Circuit erred.  Again, had it undertak-\nen any analysis at all, the Seventh Circuit necessarily would have found that the \nLegislature’s objections to this relief are meritless.  The undisputed record conclu-\nsively establishes that “the order that local officials be allowed to employ poll work-\ners who are not electors in the county where they will serve is both necessary and \nreasonable.”  App.31a (Rovner, J. dissenting). \nIn an ordinary election, each Wisconsin municipality can open sufficient poll-\ning places to allow every eligible voter to vote in person safely.  Not so during \nCOVID-19, which (the district court found) has triggered serious difficulties in re-\ncruiting and retaining pollworkers.  App.47a-48a, 91a.  These “severe shortages” re-\nsulted “in some localities being severely limited in providing in-person voting oppor-\ntunities” in Wisconsin’s April election: for example, “Milwaukee was only able to \nopen five of its usual 180 polling sites, and Green Bay reduced its usual 31 polling \nsites to just two.”  Id.  \n Such mass closures impose impossible burdens on voters (and pollworkers) \nduring a pandemic because they ensure that the polling locations that do open will \nbe overcrowded, thus exacerbating a substantial risk of disease transmission.  As \nthe district court found, safe and effective in-person voting during a highly conta-\ngious pandemic cannot occur absent a sufficient number of polling locations to \nspread out voting.  App.51a; App.31a (Rovner, J. dissenting) (“Adequate staffing of \nthe polls is essential to minimizing … public health risks.”). \n35 \n\n \nYet Wisconsin’s severe pollworker shortages are likely to continue through \nthe November election.  Despite having “greater warning and opportunity to plan, \nlocal election officials still had difficulty securing adequate people for Wisconsin’s \nmuch smaller August 2020 election.”  App.91a.  And the district court found—and \nthe Legislature does not deny—that “[i]n-person voting in November is also likely to \nbe strained by a shortage of pollworkers, despite more time to plan for that shortage \nthan was available for the spring election.”  App.54a.  Administrator Wolfe testified, \nfor example, that “despite the advance warning [and] the greater time to plan … lo-\ncal municipalities are still having problems filling all their polling stations.”  \nApp.53a-54a.  Indeed, “based on her past experience and unique perspective, Ad-\nministrator Wolfe testified that her biggest worry in the administration of the No-\nvember election is a lack of pollworkers for in-person voting on election day.”  \nApp.91a.  The testimony from local election officials in Green Bay and Milwaukee is \nin accord.  See DNC ECF Nos. 480:123; 470:111-112; 319:50.  The surging pandemic \nin Wisconsin can only add to the strain.  See supra at 9. \nThe Legislature argued in the Seventh Circuit that lifting the county-\nresidence requirement will not alleviate these staffing issues.  Leg. Emergency Mot. \nat 16, 19.  That argument ignores both the undisputed record and the district \ncourt’s extensive factfinding.  The county-residence requirement prevents those \nmunicipalities experiencing shortages from recruiting pollworkers from other juris-\ndictions with no shortages, and the WEC from coordinating volunteer pollworkers to \ngo where needed as shortages arise.  App.91a-92a; see Swenson v. Bostelmann, No. \n36 \n\n \n20-459 (W.D. Wis.), ECF No. 42:20, 21.  And it prevents municipalities from access-\ning National Guard members who reside outside of their community, should the \nGovernor choose again to activate the National Guard.  App.91a-92a; App.31a (Rov-\nner, J., dissenting). \nCritically, the WEC agrees that the pool of pollworkers available to local offi-\ncials would be larger absent the county-residence requirement.  DNC ECF No. 518-\n2:13. And both Milwaukee and Green Bay testified that allowing inter-county shar-\ning of pollworkers would help abate shortages in the November election.  DNC ECF \nNos. 470:111-113; 494:24; 480:143-144. \nIn its attempt to justify the stay, the Legislature pressed Wisconsin’s interest \nin promoting a decentralized approach to election management.  Leg. Emergency \nMot. at 16.  But that interest would not be harmed in any way by the district court’s \ninjunction.  No municipality will be forced to hire pollworkers from outside the \ncounty; the district court’s order simply allows them flexibility to do so if a particu-\nlar municipality deems it necessary.  And “if a county or municipality lacks suffi-\ncient pollworkers and wishes to recruit workers from other locations within the \nstate,” then “the municipality or county has already conceded its inability to main-\ntain [the decentralized election-management] interest while still conducting a \nmeaningful election.”  App.91a-92a.  Regardless, the Legislature’s amorphous inter-\nest in decentralized election management cannot justify restricting the ability to \nsend resources where needed in the face of “expressed, local need” during an un-\nprecedented pandemic.  App.92a.   \n37 \n\n \nRemarkably, one of the Legislature’s core premises in this case is that the \navailability of in-person voting renders fundamental failures in the absentee-voting \nprocess constitutional.  The Legislature cannot credibly point to in-person voting as \nan independent and constitutionally adequate alternative, while opposing “a modest \nand entirely reasonable means” to ensure that in-person voting is safe, “one that \nposes no risk to the integrity of the election.” App.31a (Rovner, J. dissenting).  The \ndistrict court’s relief is critical to solving the most significant problem standing in \nthe way of opening sufficient and safe polling places in Wisconsin.  The district \ncourt committed no error in ordering that modest relief; the Seventh Circuit com-\nmitted serious error in staying that relief with zero analysis. \nIII.  THE BALANCE OF HARMS AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST REQUIRE \nVACATING THE STAY. \nIrreparable harm occurs where it “would be difficult—if not impossible—to \nreverse the harm,” Hollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U.S. 183, 195 (2010), or where an \napplicant cannot “be afforded effective relief” even if she eventually prevails on the \nmerits. Nken, 556 U.S. at 435.  The panel here erred by failing even to consider “the \nharms attendant upon issuance or nonissuance of an injunction.”  Purcell, 549 U.S. \nat 4.  That is especially so because the balance of harms unmistakably supports va-\ncatur, as does the public interest:  voters will suffer irreparable injury if this Court \ndoes not vacate the panel’s stay, and the Legislature has not shown that the district \ncourt’s modest relief would cause any harm at all, let alone irreparable injury. \nThe district court correctly found that, absent effective injunctive relief, tens \nof thousands of voters will likely be disenfranchised by Wisconsin’s ballot-receipt \n38 \n\n \ndeadline, and countless others will be subject to polling-place closures and consoli-\ndation.  That disenfranchisement is quintessential irreparable harm. \nFor the tens of thousands of voters who are prevented from casting ballots \nbecause of Wisconsin’s absentee ballot-receipt deadline, the harm is irrefutable.  “A \nrestriction on the fundamental right to vote … constitutes irreparable injury.”  \nObama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 436 (6th Cir. 2012).  Eligible citizens have \na “strong interest in exercising the ‘fundamental political right’ to vote,” and there \nis no relief that can compensate them for the harm of not being able to participate \nin the electoral process.  Purcell, 549 U.S. at 4; Fish v. Kobach, 840 F.3d 710, 752 \n(10th Cir. 2016) (“Because there can be no ‘do-over’ or redress of a denial of the right \nto vote after an election, denial of that right weighs heavily in determining whether \nplaintiffs would be irreparably harmed absent an injunction.”); accord League of \nWomen Voters of United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  And voters \nwho seek to avoid that harm by attempting to vote in person during the current \npublic health crisis face a different type of irreparable injury: harm to their health, \nand potentially their lives.  See Mozilla Corp. v. Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n, 940 F.3d \n1, 62 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (finding that the fact that “[p]eople could be injured or die” as \na result of challenged government action constituted irreparable harm).  It should \ngo without saying that no voter should be forced to risk her life in order to exercise \nthe right to vote.  It should also go without saying that the public interest favors \nsafe and effective voting. \n39 \n\n \nThere is nothing on the other side of the ledger.  First, as to the ballot-receipt \ndeadline, the Legislature has claimed only that the district court’s six-day extension \nwould prevent the State from conclusively determining the results of the election on \nelection night.  See Leg. Emergency Mot. at 18.  But it cited no authority—nor could \nit—holding that an amorphous (and unsubstantiated, see supra at 33-34) claim of \n“unnecessary uncertainty and delay” amounts to irreparable harm.  Id.  Nor could \nany such interest possibly outweigh the irreparable harm of disenfranchisement.   \nThe Legislature also cannot show irreparable harm from the district court’s \norder enjoining the county-residence requirement.  The most the Legislature can \nmuster is a contention that this relief undercuts “the State’s desire to take a ‘decen-\ntralized’ approach to election administration.”  Leg. Emergency Mot. at 16.  Even \naccepting the State’s interest as a general matter, it has little purchase here, see \nsupra at 37, and it cannot carry the day when the cost is disenfranchisement.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, Applicants respectfully request that the stay of the district \ncourt’s preliminary injunction be vacated. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nLaurence M.

      "text": "Case: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 19   Filed: 06/08/20   Page 1 of 10\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN \n \nJILL SWENSON, MELODY MCCURTIS,   \nMARIA NELSON, BLACK LEADERS   \nORGANIZING FOR COMMUNITIES,    \nand DISABILITY RIGHTS WISCONSIN,   \nPlaintiffs,       Case No. 3:20-cv-459-wmc \n   \n  v.   \n \nMARGE BOSTELMANN, JULIE M. \nGLANCEY, ANN S. JACOBS, DEAN \nKNUDSON, ROBERT F. SPINDELL, JR.,  \nand MARK L. THOMSEN, in their official \ncapacities as Wisconsin Elections \nCommissioners, \nDefendants, \n \nREPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE \nand REPUBLICAN PARTY OF WISCONSIN, \n[Proposed] Intervenor-Defendants. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO INTERVENE AS \nDEFENDANTS BY THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE  \nAND REPUBLICAN PARTY OF WISCONSIN \nMovants,  the  Republican  National  Committee  and  Republican  Party  of  Wisconsin, \nrespectfully ask this Court to grant their motion to intervene in this case. Defendants consent to \nintervention, but Plaintiffs oppose. The Court should allow Movants to intervene as defendants for \ntwo independent reasons. \nFirst, this Court should grant Movants permissive intervention under Rule 24(b). Movants’ \ndefenses of the challenged laws share common questions of law and fact with the exiting action, and \nintervention will result in no delay or prejudice. Permissive intervention is thus appropriate here for \nthe same reasons that the Court granted it in three related cases. \nSecond, and alternatively, Movants satisfy the criteria for intervention as of right under Rule \n24(a)(2). The complaint was filed less than a month ago, this litigation is still in its infancy, and no \nparty will be prejudiced by intervention at this early stage. Movants also have a recognized interest in \n  1 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 19   Filed: 06/08/20   Page 2 of 10\nasserting and protecting the rights of their members in upcoming elections and in protecting their own \nagendas and resources from changes to election laws. Finally, no other party adequately represents \nMovants’ interests. The governmental defendants consent to intervention, are represented by private \ncounsel, and have stated that they will not defend the challenged laws on the merits. \nWhether under Rule 24(a) or (b), this Court should allow Movants to intervene as defendants.  \nINTERESTS OF PROPOSED INTERVENORS \nMovants are political committees that represent and support Republicans in Wisconsin. The \nRepublican National Committee is a national committee as defined by 52 U.S.C. §30101. It manages \nthe party’s business at the national level, supports Republican candidates for public office at all levels, \ncoordinates fundraising and election strategy, and develops and promotes the national Republican \nplatform. The Republican Party of Wisconsin is a recognized political party that works to promote \nRepublican values and assist Republican candidates in partisan elections to federal, state, and local \noffice. Both Movants have interests—their own and those of their members—in how Wisconsin \nelections are run. \nARGUMENT \nI.  Movants are entitled to permissive intervention. \nRule 24 is “liberally construed with all doubts resolved in favor of the proposed intervenor.” \nSouth Dakota ex rel. Barnett v. U.S. Dept. of Interior, 317 F.3d 783, 785 (8th Cir. 2003); accord Wilderness \nSoc. v. U.S. Forest Service, 630 F.3d 1173, 1179 (9th Cir. 2011); Clark v. Sandusky, 205 F.2d 915, 919 (7th \nCir. 1953). Exercising broad judicial discretion, courts grant permissive intervention when the movant \nhas “a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.” Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 24(b). The court also considers “whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the \nadjudication of the original parties’ rights.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(3). \nThese considerations all favor Movants, as this Court recently held in three cases that have \nbeen tagged as related to this one. See Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann (DNC), No. 20-cv-249-wmc, \n  2 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 19   Filed: 06/08/20   Page 3 of 10\n2020 WL 1505640, at *5 (W.D. Wis. Mar. 28, 2020); Doc. 122 (Text Only Order), DNC, No. 20-cv-\n249-wmc. Movants’ motion is timely, see infra II.A, and “there is no reasonable dispute that their \nproposed defense of the challenged laws shares common questions of law and fact with the main \naction.” DNC, 2020 WL 1505640, at *5; accord Pac for Middle Am. v. State Bd. of Elections, 1995 WL \n571893, *4 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 22, 1995); Builders Ass’n of Greater Chi. v. Chicago, 170 F.R.D. 435, 441 (N.D. \nIll. 1996). \nNor will Movants’ intervention unduly delay this litigation or prejudice anyone. Movants \nswiftly moved to intervene while the case was “at … a nascent stage,” 100Reporters LLC v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Justice, 307 F.R.D. 269, 286 (D.D.C. 2014), and their participation will add no delay beyond the norm \nfor multiparty litigation. Plaintiffs “put [the constitutionality of the laws] at issue,” moreover, and they \n“can hardly be said to be prejudiced by having to prove a lawsuit [they] chose to initiate.” ABS Global, \nInc. v. Inguran, LLC, 2015 WL 1486647, *5 (W.D. Wis. Mar. 31, 2015); Security Ins. Co. of Hartford v. \nSchipporeit, Inc., 69 F.3d 1377, 1381 (7th Cir. 1995). Movants also commit to following the same briefing \nschedule as Defendants, “which is a promise” that undermines claims of undue delay. Emerson Hall \nAssocs., L.P. v. Travelers Casualty Ins. Co. of Am., 2016 WL 223794, *2 (W.D. Wis. Jan. 19, 2016). \nAs this Court explained in the three related cases, Movants are “uniquely qualified” for \npermissive intervention because their “‘interest in the litigation is the mirror-image’” of Plaintiffs’. \nDNC, 2020 WL 1505640, at *5 (quoting Builders Ass’n, 170 F.R.D. at 441). While the Court made that \nstatement in a case involving the Democratic Party, the observation holds here, since Plaintiffs seek \nmuch of the same relief that the Democratic Party seeks there. Compare Compl. 66-68, with Doc. 155-\n1 at 75-78 & Doc. 140-1 at 38-39, DNC, No. 20-cv-249-wmc. Indeed, in two of the related cases—\nGear v. Bostelmann, No. 20-cv-278-wmc (W.D. Wis.), and Lewis v. Bostelmann, No. 20-cv-284 (W.D. \nWis.)—this Court allowed Movants to intervene even though the Democratic Party was not a plaintiff. \nSee Doc. 122, DNC, No. 20-cv-249-wmc. While those cases were consolidated with the DNC case, \n  3 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 19   Filed: 06/08/20   Page 4 of 10\nthis Court necessarily determined that Movants satisfied the requirements for permissive intervention \nin each case. See Hall v. Hall, 138 S. Ct. 1118, 1127-28 (2018) (explaining that “‘consolidation does not \nmerge the suits’” and that intervenors in one don’t automatically become intervenors in the others). \nThe Court was correct, and its reasoning applies to this related case as well. \nAllowing Movants to permissively intervene in this case has other benefits. It would allow the \nCourt to evaluate all the competing claims and arguments at the same time, thus preventing protracted \npiecemeal litigation and the possibility of conflicting legal decisions. ABS Global, 2015 WL 1486647, \n*5. Allowing intervention by political parties in a “time-sensitiv[e]” “election-related dispute” also \npreempts the delay that otherwise results from sorting out Movants’ rights on appeal. See Jacobson v. \nDetzner, 2018 WL 10509488 (N.D. Fla.) (“[D]enying [Republican Party organizations’] motion [to \nintervene] opens the door to delaying the adjudication of this case’s merits for months—if not \nlonger”); Stringfellow v. Concerned Neighbors in Action, 480 U.S. 370, 377 (1987) (“[W]hen an order \nprevents a putative intervenor from becoming a party in any respect, the order is subject to immediate \nreview.”). \nWhere a court has doubts, “the most prudent and efficient course of action” is to allow \npermissive intervention. Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of Wis. v. United States, \n2002 WL 32350046, *3 (W.D. Wis. Nov. 20, 2002). The Court should do so here. \nII.  Alternatively, Movants are entitled to intervene as of right. \nAlthough permissive intervention is an easier call (and was the basis of this Court’s prior order \ngranting intervention to Movants), this Court could also grant Movants intervention as of right. Under \nRule 24(a)(2), this Court must grant intervention as of right if: \n1.  The motion is timely; \n2.  Movants have a legally protected interest in this action; \n3.  This action may impair or impede that interest; and \n4.  No existing party adequately represents Movants’ interests. \n \n  4 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 19   Filed: 06/08/20   Page 5 of 10\nHeartwood, Inc. v. U.S. Forest Serv., Inc., 316 F.3d 694, 700 (7th Cir. 2003). Movants satisfy each of these \nrequirements. \nA.  The motion is timely. \nMovants filed this motion in a “timely” fashion. Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a). The complaint was filed \nless than a month ago. See, e.g., Uesugi Farms, Inc. v. Michael J. Navilio & Son, Inc., 2015 WL 3962007, at \n*2 (N.D. Ill. June 25, 2015) (motions filed 4-6 weeks after the complaint are timely); Richardson v. \nHelgerson, 2015 WL 3397623, *1 (W.D. Wis. May 26, 2015) (motion filed one month after the complaint \nwas timely); Luce v. Town of Campbell, 2014 WL 6632341, at *1 (W.D. Wis. Nov. 21, 2014) (similar). \nIndeed, Movants filed this motion before Defendants even filed an answer. See, e.g., Buck v. Gordon, \n2020 WL 2316677, at *4 n.4 (6th Cir. May 11, 2020) (“there is no dispute” that a motion filed before \nany defendant filed an answer is timely). Nor will Movants’ intervention “prejudice” the parties. United \nStates v. Kemper Money Mkt. Fund, Inc., 704 F.2d 389, 391 (7th Cir. 1983). No motions have been filed, \nand no merits briefing has occurred. But if Movants are not allowed to intervene, their interests would \nbe irreparably harmed by decisions (including any preliminary injunction) that will affect the upcoming \nelections in Wisconsin. Their motion is thus timely. \nB.  Movants have protected interests in this action. \nMovants also have a “legally protectable interest in this litigation.” Lopez-Aguilar, 924 F.3d at \n391. The Seventh Circuit has embraced the Supreme Court’s approach of “‘encouraging liberality in \nthe definition of an interest.’” Id. at 392. Movants easily satisfy this liberal standard. \nMovants’ interests in this action are, at a minimum, equal to Plaintiffs’. Like Plaintiffs, Movants \nwant to increase “civic engagement” and encourage their members “to fulfill their potential for \nelectoral  impact.”  Compl.  7.  And  like  Plaintiffs,  Movants  will  be  “forced  to  divert  significant \nresources” to address “online registration and absentee ballot request issues, walk[] voters through \nchanging deadlines, and provid[e] them with information” about voting procedures. Compl. 7. If \nPlaintiffs have standing to “bring[] this suit on behalf of [their constituents] who face significant \n  5 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 19   Filed: 06/08/20   Page 6 of 10\nobstacles to voting,” Compl. 7, then Movants have an interest in protecting their members from \nsimilar obstacles that result from eleventh-hour changes to voting rules. See Crawford v. Marion Cty. \nElection Bd., 472 F.3d 949, 951 (7th Cir. 2007). And if Plaintiffs have an interest in protecting the \nintegrity of elections to which they have “divert[ed] significant resources,” Compl. 7-8, then Movants \ndo too—especially where, as here, Plaintiffs aim to freeze the very laws that were enacted to maintain \nthat integrity. See One Wis. Inst., Inc. v. Thomsen, 198 F. Supp. 3d 896, 909 (W.D. Wis. 2016). \nBut even considered in isolation, Movants have “direct” and “significant” interests in the \ncontinued  enforcement  of  state  laws  governing  voter  registration,  absentee  ballots,  and  voter \nidentification, as those laws are designed to serve “the integrity of [the] election process,” Eu v. San \nFran. Cty. Democratic Cent. Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 231 (1989), and the “orderly administration” of \nelections, Crawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 196 (2008) (op. of Stevens, J.). Federal \ncourts routinely recognize that political parties have interests supporting intervention in litigation \nregarding elections and election procedures. See, e.g., Siegel v. LePore, 234 F.3d 1163, 1169 n.1 (11th Cir. \n2000); Trinsey v. Pennsylvania, 941 F.2d 224, 226 (3d Cir. 1991); Anderson v. Babb, 632 F.2d 300, 304 (4th \nCir. 1980); Hastert v. State Bd. of Elections, 777 F. Supp. 634, 639 (N.D. Ill. 1991); Radogno v. Ill. State Bd. \nof Elections, 2011 WL 5868225, *1 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 22, 2011). \nIndeed, given their inherent and broad-based interest in elections, usually “[n]o one disputes” \nthat a political party “meet[s] the impaired interest requirement for intervention as of right.” Citizens \nUnited v. Gessler, 2014 WL 4549001, *2 (D. Col. Sept. 15, 2014). That is certainly true where, as here, \n“changes in voting procedures could affect candidates running as Republicans and voters who [are] \nmembers of the … Republican Party.” Ohio Democratic Party v. Blackwell, 2005 WL 8162665, *2 (S.D. \nOhio Aug. 26, 2005); see id. (under such circumstances, “there is no dispute that the Ohio Republican \nParty had an interest in the subject matter of this case”). Because Movants’ candidates “actively seek \n[election or] reelection in contests governed by the challenged rules,” and because their members’ \n  6 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 19   Filed: 06/08/20   Page 7 of 10\nability to participate in those elections is governed by the challenged rules, Movants have an interest \nin “demand[ing] adherence” to those requirements. Shays v. FEC, 414 F.3d 76, 88 (D.C. Cir. 2005). \nC.  This action threatens to impair Movants’ interests. \nMovants are “so situated that disposing of [this] action may as a practical matter impair or \nimpede [their] ability to protect [their] interest.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2). Movants “do not need to \nestablish that their interests will be impaired,” “only that the disposition of the action ‘may’ impair or \nimpede their ability to protect their interests.” Brumfield v. Dodd, 749 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir. 2014). This \nlanguage in Rule 24 is “obviously designed to liberalize the right to intervene in federal actions.” Nuesse \nv. Camp, 385 F.2d 694, 701 (D.C. Cir. 1967). Here, the risks to Movants’ interests are plain. \nIf Plaintiffs’ action succeeds, then the rules surrounding voter registration, absentee voting, \nand voter identification will be upended shortly before the August and November elections. Not only \nwould  this  undercut  democratically  enacted  laws  that  protect  voters  and  candidates  (including \nMovants’ members), Frank v. Walker, 768 F.3d 744, 751 (7th Cir. 2014), it would change the \n“structur[e] of th[e] competitive environment” and “fundamentally alter the environment in which \n[Movants] defend their concrete interests (e.g. their interest in … winning [election or] reelection),” \nShays, 414 F.3d at 85-86. These late changes threaten to confuse voters and undermine confidence in \nthe electoral process. See Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 4-5 (2006) (“Court orders affecting elections \n… can themselves result in voter confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the polls. \nAs an election draws closer, that risk will increase.”). In addition to that independent harm, Movants \nwill be forced to spend substantial resources informing Republican voters of changes in the law, \nfighting inevitable confusion, and galvanizing participation in the wake of the “consequent incentive \nto remain away from the polls.” Id.; Crawford, 472 F.3d at 951; Thomsen, 198 F. Supp. 3d at 909. \nMovants need to intervene now to stop these potential impairments. Because the “very \npurpose of intervention is to allow interested parties to air their views so that a court may consider \n  7 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 19   Filed: 06/08/20   Page 8 of 10\nthem before making potentially adverse decisions,” Brumfield, 749 F.3d at 345 (emphasis added), the \n“best” course—and the one that Rule 24 “implements”—is to give “all parties with a real stake in a \ncontroversy … an opportunity to be heard,” Hodgson v. United Mine Workers of Am., 473 F.2d 118, 130 \n(D.C. Cir. 1972). \nD.  The existing parties do not adequately represent Movants’ interests. \n  Finally, the existing parties are not “adequate representatives of [Movants’] interest.” Lopez-\nAguilar, 924 F.3d at 391. Typically, a movant must show only that “the representation ‘may be’ \ninadequate”—a “‘minimal’” burden. Ligas ex rel. Foster v. Maram, 478 F.3d 771, 774 (7th Cir. 2007) \n(quoting Trbovich v. United Mine Workers of Am., 404 U.S. 528, 538 n.10 (1972)). The burden increases, \nhowever, when the “intervenor and the named party have ‘the same goal,’” and the burden increases \nfurther when “the [named] party ‘is a governmental body charged by law with protecting the interests \nof the proposed intervenors.’” Planned Parenthood of Wis., Inc. v. Kaul, 942 F.3d 793, 799 (7th Cir. 2019). \nThen, “the [government] party is presumed to be an adequate representative ‘unless there is a showing \nof gross negligence or bad faith.’” Id. But that presumption does not apply—or has been rebutted—\nhere. \n  As this Court knows, Defendants have already declined to defend these laws once before. In \nthe DNC case, Defendants were initially represented by the Attorney General and promised to defend \nmany of the same laws challenged here—Wisconsin’s photo-identification requirement for absentee-\nballot applications, Wis. Stat. §6.86, the witness requirement for absentee ballots, Wis. Stat. §6.87(2), \nand the postmark-by-election-day requirement for absentee ballots, Wis. Stat. §6.87(6). See Compl. 68; \nDoc. 51, DNC, No. 20-cv-249-wmc. But the Attorney General soon withdrew from the DNC case, \nDefendants hired private counsel (the same attorneys who represent them here), and Defendants \ndeclined to defend the challenged laws on the merits. See Doc. 107, DNC, No. 20-cv-249-wmc. When \nthis Court preliminarily enjoined some of those laws, Defendants did not appeal. This sequence of \n  8 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 19   Filed: 06/08/20   Page 9 of 10\nevents  is  not  surprising,  as  the  Wisconsin  Elections  Commission  is  evenly  divided  between \nRepublicans and Democrats, and that deadlock often prevents it from taking positions. See Shawn \nJohnson, State Election Panel Deadlocks Again on How to Address Ruling on Voter List Purge, WPR (Dec. 30, \n2019), bit.ly/2XteJsj. \nThe Seventh Circuit granted intervention as of right on these facts. On appeal in DNC, the \nWisconsin Legislature argued that it was entitled to intervention as of right, stressing that Defendants \nwere “expressly refusing to defend several of the challenged laws.” Doc. 4-1 at 25, Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. \nBostelmann (DNC), No. 20-1539 (7th Cir.). (The Legislature did not raise permissive intervention on \nappeal.) The Seventh Circuit agreed. See Doc. 30 at 4, DNC, No. 20-1539.  \nThe Seventh Circuit’s ruling is “law of the case” in DNC, Doc. 191 (Text Only Order), No. \n20-cv-249, and its reasoning should govern this related case. As in DNC, Defendants are represented \nby the same private counsel and remain unwilling to defend all of the challenged laws. Defendants \nmade this abundantly clear in Edwards v. Bostelmann, No. 20-cv-340-wmc (W.D. Wis.)—another case \nthat has been tagged as related to this one and DNC. In Edwards, Defendants (represented by the same \nprivate counsel) recently filed a memorandum of law in support of a motion to dismiss on procedural \ngrounds.  The  memorandum  strongly  insists  that  Defendants  “have  no  authority  …  to  take  a \nsubstantive position as to whether laws governing the conduct of elections ought to be changed” and \nare “unable to challenge or litigate the outcome of the injunctive relief sought in this case.” Doc. 15 \nat 5-6, Edwards, No. 20-cv-340-wmc. Defendants also disclaim the “authority to appeal any judicially \nmandated changes in elections procedures.” Id. at 6. “Due to [these] statutory constraints on their \nauthority,” Defendants explained, they could “take no position in this case as to whether the plaintiffs[] \nare entitled to some form of prospective relief.” Id. at 7. \nDefendants’ memorandum in Edwards explains why they did not defend the challenged laws \nin DNC, are not defending the challenged laws in Edwards, and will not defend the challenged laws \n  9 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 19   Filed: 06/08/20   Page 10 of 10\nhere. All of this is strong evidence of “a concrete, substantive conflict or an actual divergence of \ninterests [sufficient] to overcome [the presumption of adequate representation].” Kaul, 942 F.3d at 810 \n(Sykes, J., concurring). Defendants’ memorandum in Edwards also explains why they have consented \nto Movants’ intervention both here and in Edwards. The fact that Defendants—the only parties who \ncould  possibly  represent  Movants’  interests—agree  that  Movants  satisfy  the  requirements  for \nintervention as of right is decisive. See Utah Ass’n of Ctys. v. Clinton, 255 F.3d 1246, 1256 (10th Cir. \n2001); Conservation Law Found. of New Eng., Inc. v. Mosbacher, 966 F.2d 39, 44 (1st Cir. 1992); Utahns for \nBetter Transp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 295 F.3d 1111, 1117 (10th Cir. 2002); U.S. House of Representatives \nv. Price, 2017 WL 3271445, at *2 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 1, 2017). \nIn short, “intervention [is] vital to the defense of the law[s] at issue” in this case. Miracle v. \nHobbs, 333 F.R.D. 151, 155 (D. Ariz. 2019) (citing Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 433 (2009)). Movants \nshould thus be granted intervention as of right. \nCONCLUSION \n  The Court should grant Movants’ motion and allow them to intervene as defendants. \n \nDated: June 8, 2020  Respectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/ Patrick Strawbridge        T \nPatrick Strawbridge \nCONSOVOY MCCARTHY PLLC  \nTen Post Office Square \n8th Floor South PMB #706 \nBoston, MA 02109 \n(703) 243-9423 \npatrick@consovoymccarthy.com \n \nJeffrey M.

The Seventh Circuit’s holding, if this Court agrees \nwith it, poses an existential threat to the separation-of-powers \nprinciples our state and country are founded upon. The effect of \nthe Seventh Circuit’s interpretation of Wisconsin law is to allow \nthe  Attorney  General  and/or  unelected  state  bureaucrats  to \nfunction as a mini legislature, nullifying laws they disagree with \nthrough concession or half-hearted defense. This lawsuit is a case \nin point: Wisconsin’s Attorney General, whose duty it is to defend \nstate  law,  withdrew  from  the  case  early  on,  and  the  named \nDefendants, the members of the Wisconsin Election Commission, \ndid not put up any meaningful defense or attempt to appeal when \nimportant election laws were enjoined on the eve of an election. \nWisely foreseeing how constitutionally fraught a scenario like this \nwould be, the Legislature adopted a provision allowing itself to \nintervene and defend state laws challenged in court. Wis. Stat. \n§ 803.09(2m). This  Court should hold  that the  Legislature  has \nstanding  to  defend  the  laws  it  enacted,  especially  when  the \nAttorney General and named defendants have failed to do so. \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST \nThe Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty has long been a \nchampion of preserving the separation of powers, and has brought \nor participated in many lawsuits where the proper boundaries of \npower are at stake. E.g., Bartlett v. Evers, 2020 WI 68, 393 Wis. 2d \n172, 945 N.W.2d 685; Koschkee v. Taylor, 2019 WI 76, 387 Wis. 2d \n \n\n \n552, 929 N.W.2d 600; Amicus Brief of the Independent Business \nAssociation of Wisconsin, et al., Wisconsin Legislature v. Palm, No. \n2020AP765,  2020  WI  42  (Apr.  29,  2020);  Amicus  Brief  of  the \nWisconsin  Institute  for  Law  &  Liberty,  SEIU  v.  Vos,  No. \n2019AP614,  2020  WI  67  (Sept.  26,  2019);  Amicus  Brief  of  the \nWisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, Tetra Tech EC, Inc. v. \nWisconsin Dep’t of Revenue, No. 2015AP2019, 2018 WI 75 (July 24, \n2017).  \nARGUMENT \nThe basic division of power within our government is well-\nknown and well-established: the Legislature makes the laws, the \nExecutive Branch enforces them, and the Judiciary interprets the \nlaws and resolves conflicts. Koschkee v. Taylor, 2019 WI 76, ¶ 11, \n387 Wis. 2d 552, 929 N.W.2d 600; Gabler v. Crime Victims Rights \nBd., 2017 WI 67, ¶ 11, 376 Wis. 2d 147, 897 N.W.2d 384. This \nstructure  is  liberty-enhancing:  “After  more  than  two  hundred \nyears of constitutional governance, that tripartite separation of \nindependent  governmental  power  remains  the  bedrock  of  the \nstructure by which we secure liberty in both Wisconsin and the \nUnited  States.”  Gabler,  2017  WI  67,  ¶  3.  As  the  founders \nrecognized,  “[t]he  accumulation  of  all  powers,  legislative, \nexecutive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, \nor  many,  …  may  justly  be  pronounced  the  very  definition  of \ntyranny.” Federalist No. 47 (James Madison).  \nThe legislative process itself is designed to prevent any one \nperson from wielding too much power: a new law must originate in \n- 2 - \n\n \nthe  Senate  or  Assembly,  be  passed  by  both  houses,  and  be \npresented to the Governor. Wis. Const. art. 4, § 19; art. 5, § 10. And \nit  goes  without  saying  that  this  intentionally  arduous  process \napplies equally to repealing and amending laws.  \nWhile courts unquestionably have the authority to enjoin \nlaws that violate constitutional rights, see Marbury v. Madison, 5 \nU.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803), one of the primary checks within the \njudiciary is appellate review. A trial court’s ruling is “the first \nword, not the last word, on [important] legal questions,” Order \nGranting Stay Pending Appeal at 6, SEIU v. Vos, No. 2019AP622 \n(June 11, 2019). And one of the strongest features of our judicial \nsystem is that the higher one goes and the greater authority the \ncourt has, the more judges must agree on the legal question: two \nout of three at the intermediate level, and four out of seven or five \nout of nine at the  ultimate level. This design, again, exists to \nprevent the accumulation of too much power in any one person.  \nBut there is a loophole in this system that has been abused \nfar too frequently in recent years. If a clever litigant can select a \nfavorable venue and litigate against a sympathetic government \ndefendant or attorney general who will throw the case,  it can \nobtain  a  change  in  the  law  while  evading  both  the  legislative \nprocess and the ordinary checks in the court system. This case \npresents that problem starkly. The Attorney General, who has a \nduty to defend state law, see SEIU v. Vos, 2020 WI 67, ¶ 64, 393 \nWis. 2d 38, 946 N.W.2d 35, is conspicuously absent from the case, \nhaving withdrawn early on with little explanation. See Stipulation \n- 3 - \n\n \nfor Substitution of Counsel, DNC v. Bostelmann, No. 20-cv-249, \nDkt. 48 (March 25, 2020). \n  And the named Defendants, the members of the Wisconsin \nElection Commission, have not defended the laws either. As even \nthe  district  court  acknowledged,  the  Wisconsin  Legislature \n“offer[ed] a more robust opposition” to the challenges than did the \nCommission. Opinion and Order at 2, DNC v. Bostelmann, No. 20-\ncv-249, Dkt. 528 (Sept. 21, 2020). Calling the Legislature’s defense \n“more  robust”  is  putting  it  mildly.  The  Commission’s  filing  in \nresponse to the Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions “[took] \nno position on the relief sought by the Plaintiffs.” Memorandum of \nWEC  Defendants  in  Response  to  Plaintiffs’  Motions  for \nPreliminary Injunctions at 3, 16, DNC v. Bostelmann, No. 20-cv-\n249, Dkt. 267 (July 20, 2020). And the Commission has not even \nattempted  to  appeal  the  district  court’s  injunction.  See  Docket \nEntries 540–547, DNC v. Bostelmann, No. 20-cv-249.  \nIntervention  is  our  court  system’s  usual  solution  to  the \nproblem of non-adverse parties, and sometimes a private party will \nhave  a  sufficiently  unique  stake  to  intervene  and  defend  a \nchallenged law when the Attorney General cannot or will not for \nwhatever reason. But many laws have diffuse benefits, with no \nobvious non-government party with a unique interest sufficient to \nintervene. Election laws, in particular, exist to benefit all voters \nand to protect the integrity of the election system and process as a \nwhole. Any individual voter would have a hard time showing a \nsufficient stake to step in and defend a particular election law. But \nthen who? The most obvious answer—perhaps the only answer—\n- 4 - \n\n \nis the Legislature. The Legislature is “the government body closest \nto the will of the people.” Flynn v. Dep’t of Admin., 216 Wis. 2d 521, \n542, 576 N.W.2d 245 (1998). It is the entity charged with crafting \npolicies to benefit the people it serves, and it therefore has the \ngreatest  interest  in  defending  those  policies  when  they  are \nchallenged.  \n  When,  as  here,  the  Attorney  General  bows  out  and  the \nnamed government defendants roll over, the Legislature must be \npermitted to  intervene  to  defend state law; otherwise a  single \njudge  will  be  able  to  rewrite  state  law  with  impunity,  totally \nupending  our  system  of  checks  and  balances.  The  Legislature \nadopted Wis. Stat. § 803.09(2m) in recognition of this threat to the \nseparation of powers, and this Court should give it the intended \neffect.  \n  In SEIU v. Vos, 2020 WI 67, this Court rejected a facial \nchallenge  to  §  803.09(2m),  noting  that  the  Legislature’s \ninvolvement with litigation might be within the shared power of \nthe  Legislature  and  Executive  Branch,  at  least  when  the \nLegislature sought to advance some institutional interest. Id. ¶ 63. \nThat interest might relate to something that the Legislature must \ndo to implement a settlement, i.e, the expenditure of money.  \n  But it might also be implicated when the Attorney General \ndeclines  to  vigorously  defend  a  state  law.  In  some  cases  that \ndecision might be appropriate—if he or she believes there is no \ncolorable defense or that enforcing the law is not, by some neutral \nmeasure, a wise expenditure of the state’s resources. But if the \nAttorney General simply disagrees with the policy embodied by the \n- 5 - \n\n \nlaw or favors one side of an unresolved legal controversy on which \nreasonable lawyers might differ, a decision not to defend a law \nlooks a lot like legislating. It is, put simply, the transformation of \nthe state’s policy. There may be no way to cabin the Attorney \nGeneral’s discretion in this regard, and, in many cases, the Court \nwill not know the Attorney General’s motivation for withdrawing \nfrom a case. But this Court can mitigate the problem by holding \nthat when the Attorney General declines to defend a law and there \nis a reasonable defense available, he or she is acting within the \nzone of shared powers and § 803.09(2m) may be constitutionally \nfollowed. Even if, as the panel suggested, the Legislature has no \ninstitutional  interest  in  its  enactments  surviving  a  legal \nchallenge—itself  a  dubious  proposition—it  certainly  has  an \ninterest in defending the law when the state’s lawyer will not. \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should hold that the Wisconsin Legislature has \nstanding  to  defend  state  law  when  the  Attorney  General  for \nwhatever reason cannot or will not.    \nDated: October 5, 2020. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nRICHARD M.

The April 7, 2020 election was unlike any other in Wisconsin’s history, tainted by \nbreakdowns in critical aspects of the election process and disenfranchisement of a substantial \nnumber of Wisconsin voters. Two days before the election, the Surgeon General of the United \nStates likened the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic to the Pearl Harbor and \nSeptember 11 attacks, warning the nation to prepare for the “saddest week of most Americans’ \nlives.”1 While all other states with primaries scheduled in April delayed their elections, \nWisconsin held its election in the midst of a global pandemic. Defendants and others took steps \nto attempt to administer the election fairly, including some at the order of this Court, but those \nactions were insufficient to protect the rights of Wisconsin voters. As a result, voters were forced \nto choose between forgoing their constitutional rights to participate in their democracy or risking \nthe health of themselves and their loved ones in order to vote. Tens of thousands of voters were \ndisenfranchised by failures in the absentee and in-person voting systems. The election shook the \npublic’s faith in the democratic process. \n2.  This outcome was foreseeable and, for too many Wisconsin voters, including \nPlaintiffs, preventable. For over a month before the election, Defendants were aware of the \ngrowing danger of COVID-19 and the attendant risks of administering an election during the \nescalating pandemic. With each passing day, public health officials grew louder in their calls for \nsocial distancing, urging Americans to stay at home. Each day brought more deaths and more \nnew infections. By election day, 83 Wisconsinites had died of coronavirus and 2,440 residents \nwere known to be infected with the virus. At the same time, election experts from across the \ncountry expressed alarm over the lack of actionable steps taken by the state to conduct an \n                                                 \n1 Quint Forgey, Surgeon General Warns This Week ‘Is Going to Be Our Pearl Harbor Moment’, POLITICO (Apr. 5, \n2020), available at https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/05/surgeon-general-pearl-harbor-moment-165729.   \n1 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 3 of 70\n \nelection in such extraordinary circumstances. As municipal and county clerks warned about the \nlack of capacity and resources to carry out the election properly, nine mayors, including the \nmayors of the five largest cities in Wisconsin, demanded that the election be postponed.2  \n3.  What ensued has been described by one election law expert as the biggest election \nfailure since the Voting Rights Act was enacted in 1965.3 Voters encountered obstacles at almost \nevery stage of the election process, including: navigating the online systems designed to register \nvoters and request absentee ballots; requesting absentee ballots, which were either never \ndelivered or delivered too late; and voting in person. Before election day, 111 voting \njurisdictions reported not having enough poll workers to open even one polling place; on election \nday, Milwaukee had 5 (of its usual 180) polling locations, Green Bay had 2 (of its usual 31) \npolling locations, and Waukesha had only 1 (of its usual 15). Voters who did go to the polls in \nmany places encountered long waits and voting locations without adequate safety supplies for \nvoters and poll workers alike. \n4.  Plaintiffs bring this case to prevent a replay of this mass disenfranchisement in \neither the August Partisan Primary or the November General Election. Like the April 7 election, \nthose elections will take place against the backdrop of COVID-19 and the extraordinary \nchallenges it presents to election administrators and voters. There is a growing consensus among \nexperts that COVID-19 will alter the daily lives of Americans at least into next year, and \ncertainly through November. Whatever the precise course of the pandemic between now and the \ncoming elections, there is no question that community transmission and attendant risks will \n                                                 \n2 Joseph Ax, Citing Coronavirus, Wisconsin Mayors Urge Postponement of Tuesday’s Election, REUTERS (Apr. 5, \n2020), available at https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-election-wisconsin/citing-coronavirus-\nwisconsin-mayors-urge-postponement-of-tuesdays-election-idUSKBN21O0CZ.  \n3 Shawn Johnson, To the Polls in a Pandemic: How Wisconsin Went Ahead with an Election Amidst a Public Health \nCrisis, WIS. PUBLIC RADIO (Apr. 13, 2020), available at  \nhttps://www.wpr.org/polls-pandemic-how-wisconsin-went-ahead-election-amidst-public-health-crisis.  \n2 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 4 of 70\n \ncontinue to impact the demand for online registration and for absentee voting methods, safe \nprotocols for in-person voting, and other mechanics and processes of voting and election \nadministration. The U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 require Defendants to \nadminister upcoming elections in a way that avoids forcing voters to choose between their votes \nand their safety.   \n5.  The U.S. Constitution guarantees that no eligible Wisconsin citizen will be \ndeprived of the right to vote. Plaintiffs are individuals who were deprived of that right in the \nApril 7 election and organizations whose work to ensure that Wisconsinites can participate in \nelections is burdened by Defendants’ failure to provide a safe and accessible election under \npandemic conditions. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants, by failing to take appropriate actions to \nensure that Wisconsinites can safely access the ballot, violated Section 11(b) of the Voting \nRights Act, the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, and the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (“the ADA”). They bring this civil action to enjoin Defendants—\nCommissioners and the Administrator of the Wisconsin Elections Commission—from similarly \nviolating Wisconsinites’ rights to vote during future elections affected by COVID-19. \n6.  As the April 7 election demonstrated, Defendants maintain and administer an \nelection system that—amidst a pandemic that both Wisconsin and national public health officials \nexpect will continue and might well intensify between now and November—forces voters to \nchoose between casting a ballot and protecting their own, their families’, and their communities’ \nhealth. In the April 7 election, Defendants failed to take available steps necessary to allow voters \nto vote safely, either in person or by the absentee voting procedures provided by Wisconsin law; \nand, despite the reports of substantial voter disenfranchisement, they have not taken sufficient \nsteps to remedy those failures in advance of the coming elections. The burdens imposed by those \n3 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 5 of 70\n \nfailures, moreover, did not fall equally on voters across the state. As a result, voters faced starkly \ndifferent opportunities to safely cast a ballot depending on where they live, their age, their \ndisability status, and their race. \n7.  Plaintiffs do not contest the results of the April 7 election. Plaintiffs instead come \nbefore this Court to obtain an order requiring Defendants to administer impending elections in a \nmanner that will not violate eligible voters’ federally protected rights to participate in those \nelections. To be sure, Wisconsin’s April 7 election was conducted in the face of a public health \ncrisis that few foresaw until the month before the election, and many election officials worked \nvery hard to manage the challenges it posed. Those challenges, however, do not alter the \nfundamental commands of the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act, and the Americans with \nDisabilities Act: that Defendants take reasonable steps to ensure that all voters can safely access \nthe ballot and participate equally in a fair democratic process. \n8.  Specifically, to comply with the requirements of federal law, Defendants must \nensure that in-person voting can be safely conducted during the impending elections, including \nby mandating that all polling locations be managed in compliance with social distancing \nguidelines to minimize COVID-19 transmission risk; that there is an adequate number of poll \nworkers to open and administer safe, in-person polling locations; that ample, safe opportunities \nfor in-person absentee voting are available; that all voters who request and are qualified to \nreceive absentee ballots in fact timely receive those ballots; that voters can safely, effectively, \nand timely return their absentee ballots so their votes are counted; and that online systems \ndesigned to register voters and request absentee ballots are sufficient to handle anticipated voter \ntraffic. Critically, to restore public confidence in the electoral process and prevent further \n4 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 6 of 70\n \ndisenfranchisement, Defendants must also educate the Wisconsin public about how they can \nsafely vote—either in person or by absentee ballot—in the impending elections. \n9.  Defendants failed to implement such measures for the April 7 election and have \nnot taken steps to do so for the rapidly approaching August and November elections. Careful \npreparations are necessary to meet the inevitable challenges of conducting safe, fair elections \namidst a pandemic. And those preparations must be undertaken sufficiently in advance of \nelection day. Implementing changes to the administration of elections requires planning and \npreparation. Yet Defendants have not adopted policies that would implement the changes \nnecessary to avoid the widespread disenfranchisement and substantial burdens on the right to \nvote that plagued the April 7 primary. Absent intervention by this Court—including by requiring \nDefendants to adopt such necessary policies when authorized by state law, and by enjoining state \nlaws that currently preclude Defendants from taking necessary measures—the same electoral \nprocess breakdown and resulting violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under federal law is likely to recur \nduring the impending August Partisan Primary and November General Election. \nPARTIES \nI.  Plaintiffs \n10.  Plaintiff Jill Swenson is a resident of Appleton, Wisconsin, and a registered \nvoter. Ms. Swenson is sixty-one years old and has early stage chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease (“COPD”), an inflammatory lung disease. Ms. Swenson was unable to vote in person \nbecause of the risk to her physical health and safety represented by the COVID-19 pandemic. \nShe requested and received a mail-in absentee ballot, but she lives alone and was unable to \nsecure an in-person witness. Consistent with this Court’s order in Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. \nBostelmann, No. 20-CV-249-WMC, 2020 WL 1638374, *18-20 (W.D. Wis. Apr. 2, 2020), she \n5 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 7 of 70\n \nmailed in an un-witnessed absentee ballot on the morning of April 3, 2020. After the Seventh \nCircuit stayed that order, Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann, Nos. 20-1538, 1539, 1545, \n1546, Order (7th Cir. Apr. 3, 2020), and as a result of Defendants’ decision not to provide voters \nlike Ms. Swenson a reasonable opportunity to cure, Ms. Swenson’s ballot was not counted. She \nwas thus disenfranchised in the April 7 election. Ms. Swenson does not currently have a safe and \neffective way to cast a ballot in the upcoming elections.  \n11.  Plaintiff Melody McCurtis is a resident of Sherman Park in Northwest \nMilwaukee, Wisconsin, and a registered voter. Ms. McCurtis lives with her \nimmunocompromised mother, so it was unsafe for her to vote in person due to the COVID-19 \npandemic. As a Black community organizer, she is also aware of the disproportionate rates of \ninfection and death in the Black community, and these elevated risks added to her fears. She \ntimely requested an absentee ballot on March 22, 2020. Her ballot never arrived. In order to vote \nin the April 7 election, Ms. McCurtis was forced to endanger her mother and endure a wait of \nmore than two hours at Washington High School. Ms. McCurtis was unsafe because voters in \nline were not able to maintain social distance, because the polling location did not provide voters \nwith personal protective equipment, and because voting equipment did not appear to be sanitary. \nMs. McCurtis plans to vote in August and November and presently does not have a safe, \nequitable way to cast her ballot. \n12.  Plaintiff Maria Nelson is a resident of Appleton, Wisconsin, and a registered \nvoter. Ms. Nelson has breast cancer and has been undergoing treatment since February 2019. As \na result, she did not feel safe voting in person. Ms. Nelson timely emailed her absentee ballot \nrequest to the Appleton Clerk’s office. She did not receive an absentee ballot by April 7, 2020. \nMs. Nelson was unable to vote in person on April 7 because of the risk to her physical health and \n6 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 8 of 70\n \nsafety represented by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Ms. Nelson was thus disenfranchised in \nthe April 7 election. Ms. Nelson does not currently have a safe and effective way to cast a ballot \nin the upcoming elections. \n13.  Plaintiff Black Leaders Organizing for Communities (“BLOC”) is a civic \nengagement project based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and a fiscally sponsored project of Tides \nAdvocacy, a California nonprofit. BLOC mobilizes Black Wisconsinites to participate at all \nlevels of government and encourages communities of color to fulfill their potential for electoral \nimpact in Milwaukee. As part of its work, BLOC educates the Black community in Milwaukee \nabout voter eligibility rules and the options for casting a ballot, and it conducts a get-out-the-vote \nfield program. In the run-up to the April 7 election, BLOC was forced to divert significant \nresources in response to the constitutional and statutory violations challenged here. BLOC staff \nwere forced to spend additional time troubleshooting online registration and absentee ballot \nrequest issues, walking voters through changing deadlines, and providing them with information \nabout what in-person voting in Milwaukee would look like. This diversion of resources has \ncontinued through the May 12th Special Election and will continue through the August and \nNovember elections if these violations are not remedied. \n14.  Plaintiff Disability Rights Wisconsin (“DRW”) is a statewide nonpartisan, \nnonprofit, non-stock corporation organized under the laws of Wisconsin. DRW is based in \nMadison, and maintains offices across the state, including in Menasha, Milwaukee, Green Bay, \nand Rice Lake. DRW’s mission is to address the issues facing, and to ensure the rights of, all \npeople with disabilities in Wisconsin. DRW is a member of the National Disability Rights \nNetwork and is designated by the Governor of Wisconsin to act as the congressionally mandated \nprotection and advocacy system for Wisconsin citizens with disabilities, pursuant to Wis. Stat. \n7 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 9 of 70\n \n§ 51.62; 29 U.S.C. § 794e; 42 U.S.C. §§ 15041, et seq.; and 42 U.S.C. §§ 10801, et seq. \nAccordingly, DRW has a state and federal mandate to protect and advocate for the rights of \npeople with disabilities in Wisconsin, including those with developmental disabilities, mental \nillness, and traumatic brain injury. As part of this mandate, DRW oversees self-advocacy training \nand other programs and services to assist people with disabilities, including to secure election \naccess, registering to vote, accessing polling places, and casting their ballots, and it staffs a Voter \nHotline to assist voters with disabilities. DRW also co-leads the Wisconsin Disability Vote \nCoalition. In the run-up to the April 7 election, DRW was forced to divert significant resources \nin response to the constitutional and statutory violations challenged here. DRW had to produce \nnumerous resources and trainings for voters that it would not have otherwise produced, and it \nhad to spend staff time untangling the options for voters with disabilities and assisting voters \nwho were at risk of being disenfranchised. This diversion of resources has continued through the \nMay 12th Special Election and will continue through the August and November elections if these \nviolations are not remedied. DRW also brings this suit on behalf of people with disabilities in \nWisconsin who face significant obstacles to voting as a result of coronavirus and will either be \ndisenfranchised or exposed to heightened risk of illness if their legal rights to safely vote are not \nvindicated. \nII.  Defendants \n15.  Defendants Marge Bostelmann, Julie M. Glancey, Ann S. Jacobs, Dean \nKnudson, Robert F. Spindell, Jr., and Mark L. Thomsen are the six Commissioners of the \nWisconsin Elections Commission and are named as Defendants in their official capacities. \nTogether, they comprise the Wisconsin Elections Commission, the body that administers and \n8 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 10 of 70\n \nenforces Wisconsin’s election laws other than those related to campaign finance. Wis. Stat. \n§ 5.05(1), (2w). \n16.  Defendant Meagan Wolfe is sued in her official capacity as the Administrator of \nthe Wisconsin Elections Commission. She is the chief elections officer of the state. Wis. Stat. \n§ 5.05(3g). \n17.  Defendants have acted under color of state law at all times relevant to this action. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n18.  Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 to redress the \ndeprivation, under color of state law, of rights secured by the U.S. Constitution and by the \nVoting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. §§ 10101, et seq., and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 12131, et seq. This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331 and 1343 because this case arises under the U.S. Constitution and federal statute and \nseeks equitable and declaratory relief for the deprivation of federal constitutional and statutory \nrights under color of state law. \n19.  This Court has jurisdiction to award attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1988(b) and 28 U.S.C. § 1920. \n20.  This Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201 and 2202. \n21.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants, who are sued in their \nofficial capacities only. \n22.  Venue is appropriate in the Western District of Wisconsin, under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1391(b)(1), because Defendants are state officials located in Madison, Wisconsin. A \n9 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 11 of 70\n \nsubstantial part of the events giving rise to these claims occurred and continues to occur in this \ndistrict, making venue also proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2). \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  Defendants and the Wisconsin Elections Commission \n23.  The Wisconsin Elections Commission (“the Commission”) administers and \nenforces all “laws relating to elections and election campaigns, other than laws relating to \ncampaign financing,” which are administered separately by the Wisconsin Ethics Commission. \nWis. Stat. § 5.05(1), (2w).  \n24.  The Commission consists of six members, four appointed by legislative leaders \nand two nominated by the Governor. Wis. Stat. § 15.61. Defendants Bostelmann, Glancey, \nJacobs, Knudson, Spindell, and Thomsen are the members of the Commission. \n25.  The Commission operates “under the direction and supervision of an \nadministrator,” who also serves as the “chief election officer” for the state. Wis. Stat. \n§ 15.61(1)(b); Wis. Stat. § 5.05(3g). Defendant Wolfe is the Administrator of the Commission. \n26.  The Commission maintains wide-ranging authority over the architecture of \nWisconsin’s electoral system. The Commission retains authority to promulgate rules “applicable \nto all jurisdictions for the purposes of interpreting or implementing the laws regulating the \nconduct of elections or election campaigns, other than laws regulating campaign financing, or \nensuring their proper administration.” Wis. Stat. § 5.05(1)(f). \n27.  Among many other things, the Commission’s authority includes: \n  Issuing appropriate guidance or formal advisory opinions, or promulgating \nadministrative rules, necessary to implement any state or federal court decision that is \nbinding on the Commission. Wis. Stat. § 5.05(5t). \n10 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 12 of 70\n \n  Providing financial assistance to eligible counties and municipalities for election \nadministration costs, consistent with other provisions of state law. Wis. Stat. \n§ 5.05(10)-(11).  \n  Conducting or prescribing requirements for educational programs to inform electors \nabout voting procedures, voting rights, and voting technology. Wis. Stat. § 5.05(12). \n   Ensuring that the voting system used at each polling place permits all individuals \nwith disabilities to vote without the need for assistance and with the same degree of \nprivacy that is accorded to nondisabled electors voting at the same polling place. Wis. \nStat. § 5.25(4); and \n  Prescribing uniform instructions for municipalities to provide to absentee electors. \nWis. Stat. § 6.869. \n28.  The Commission may also “reconsider at any time any written directives or \nwritten guidance provided to the general public. . . with regard to the enforcement and \nadministration” of Wisconsin election law, including by county and municipal officials. Wis. \nStat. § 5.05(16)(c). \n29.  Defendants at all times acted under color of state law.  \nII.  The Coronavirus Pandemic and Wisconsin’s Response \nA.  COVID-19 and its Health Effects \n30.  In the United States, the first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus known as \nCOVID-19 was identified in Washington State on January 21, 2020.  \n31.  People infected by COVID-19 exhibit a wide range of symptoms, most \nprominently cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.4 In addition, according to the \n                                                 \n4 Ctrs. for Disease Control and Prevention, “Symptoms of Coronavirus,” available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html (last updated May 8, 2020).  \n11 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 13 of 70\n \nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), five other symptoms indicate that a \nperson may have COVID-19, including: fever, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, and new loss of \ntaste or smell.5 \n32.  COVID-19 is an especially infectious virus because it is frequently transmitted by \npeople who are not experiencing symptoms. It may take up to 14 days after exposure to the virus \nfor a person to exhibit any symptoms, and people may be most infectious prior to exhibiting \nsymptoms. One study estimated that 44 percent of people infected contracted the virus from \npeople who felt healthy at the time.6 In fact, some people may remain asymptomatic carriers and \nnonetheless transmit the virus.7 Others recover fully from their symptoms and continue shedding \nthe virus that can infect others.8  \n33.  The highly infectious nature of the disease—including its long incubation period \nand the number of asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and post-symptomatic carriers—poses \nsignificant concerns for populations that are most vulnerable to COVID-19, such as the elderly \nand the immunocompromised. The CDC identifies older adults as having a higher risk of \ndeveloping more serious complications from COVID-19 and recommends that they stay home as \nmuch as possible when the virus is spreading in the community. The CDC has also warned that \nimmunocompromised people (including smokers, those undergoing cancer treatment, bone \nmarrow or organ transplantation, and those with poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and immune \ndeficiencies), as well as individuals with lung disease, asthma, heart conditions, severe obesity, \n                                                 \n5 Id. \n6 Katherine Harmon Courage, How People Are Spreading Covid-19 Without Symptoms, VOX (Apr. 22, 2020), \navailable at https://www.vox.com/2020/4/22/21230301/coronavirus-symptom-asymptomatic-carrier-spread. \n7 Id. \n8 Are COVID-19 Patients Contagious After Symptoms, LABMATE (Apr. 16, 2020), available at https://www.labmate-\nonline.com/news/laboratory-products/3/breaking-news/are-covid-19-patients-contagious-after-symptoms/52030.  \n12 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 14 of 70\n \ndiabetes, chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, and liver disease are at higher risk of \ndeveloping more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.9 The Kaiser Family Foundation \nestimated that 92.6 million Americans ages 18 and older—nearly 40 percent of all American \nadults—are at heightened risk from COVID-19.10 \n34.  People outside of these groups, however, are not free from risk. The Wisconsin \nDepartment of Health Services has warned that “[y]ounger people, and particularly those who \nare 18 to 30 years old, aren’t immune to COVID-19.”11 A recent CDC analysis of coronavirus \ncases from mid-February to mid-March found that a fifth of those who needed to be hospitalized \nwere ages 20 to 44, and nearly half were ages 20 to 54.12 In Wisconsin, people ages 20 to 49 \naccount for 50 percent of all COVID-19 cases.13 \n35.  COVID-19 is infecting and killing Black people at disproportionately high rates \nacross the United States. The latest available data indicates that the COVID-19 mortality rate for \nBlack Americans is 2.6 times higher than the rate for Whites and 2.3 times higher than the rate \nfor Asians and Latinos.14 A Washington Post analysis of available data and census demographics \nshows that “counties that are majority-black have three times the rate of infections and almost six \n                                                 \n9 Ctrs. for Disease Control and Prevention, “People Who Are at Higher Risk for Severe Illness,” available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html (last updated Apr. \n15, 2020).  \n10 Wyatt Koma, et al., How Many Adults Are at Risk of Serious Illness If Infected with Coronavirus?

In Wisconsin, Governor Tony Evers has called the disproportionally high \nCOVID-19 rates and deaths in the Black community “a crisis within a crisis.” Although Black \nWisconsinites comprise just 6.7 percent of the state’s population, they account for roughly a third \nof COVID-19 deaths and nearly a quarter of COVID-19 cases.16 In Milwaukee County, an \nanalysis found that areas that are “predominantly black are experiencing disproportionately high \nnumbers of reported cases and concentrations of coronavirus clusters,” adding that “[r]ace is \nemerging as [a] key factor in determining who lives and who dies as this virus sweeps through \nthe county.”17 Indeed, Blacks in Milwaukee are dying at nearly double the rate of their respective \nshare of the population.18  \n37.  Overall, according to the World Health Organization, “around 1 in every 5 people \nwho catch COVID-19 needs hospital treatment.”19 To date, in Wisconsin, 18 percent of cases \n                                                 \n15 Reis Thebault, et al., The Coronavirus Is Infecting and Killing Black Americans at an Alarmingly High Rate, THE \nWASHINGTON POST (Apr. 7, 2020), available at https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/04/07/coronavirus-is-\ninfecting-killing-black-americans-an-alarmingly-high-rate-post-analysis-shows/?arc404=true.  \n16 Wis.

According to the CDC, the best way to protect against illness from COVID-19 is \nto avoid exposure. As a result, the CDC recommends putting “distance between yourself and \nother people outside your home” if COVID-19 is spreading in your community.21 \nB.  February and March in Wisconsin \n39.  On February 5, 2020, Wisconsin announced its first known case of COVID-19, \nthe twelfth confirmed case in the United States.22  \n40.  During a February 27 Commission meeting, the first at which COVID-19 was \ndiscussed, Defendant Knudson, the Chair of the Commission, dismissed the need to plan for a \nCOVID-19 outbreak, saying “at worst . . . there would be either long lines or a delay in \nreporting” and boasting about the Commission’s “robust procedures” for absentee voting.23 \nWhen pressed on how to ensure that every voter would have access to the polls during a \ncoronavirus outbreak, Defendant Knudson changed the subject.  \n41.  On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared an international \npandemic. On the same day, municipal clerks in Wisconsin began raising concerns about the \nimpact on the upcoming election, including polling place closures and poll worker shortages. On \nthat date, Wisconsin had six confirmed COVID-19 cases.24  \n                                                 \n20 Wis.

On March 12, 2020, Governor Tony Evers declared a health emergency in \nresponse to the virus, authorizing the Department of Health Services to “take all necessary and \nappropriate measures to prevent and respond to incidents of COVID-19” and activating the \nWisconsin National Guard.25 Soon after the Governor’s announcement, fearful that nursing \nhomes would become incubators for infection, the Defendants allowed municipal clerks to move \npolling places and directed municipalities not to use the statutory Special Voting Deputy process \nthat facilitates absentee voting by residents of nursing homes and other care facilities.26 \n43.  By March 15, 2020, as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wisconsin \nrose to 33,27 Milwaukee city officials stated they would need 1,800 new poll workers to replace \nolder poll workers at higher risk of serious illness.  \n44.  On March 17, 2020, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services banned \ngatherings of 10 or more people. In response, the Mayor of Green Bay noted that the city would \nbe “unable to administer a normal election.”28  \n45.  The next day, multiple Defendants acknowledged that it was not possible for the \nstate to have a safe and fair election on April 7. Defendant Ann Jacobs said that she “no longer \nbelieve[d] that we are able to fairly and properly administer this election without delay or \npostponement, . . . I believe we’re putting people at risk.” Defendant Mark Thomsen echoed that \n                                                 \n25 Wis.

Defendants also issued a memorandum highlighting shortages of absentee ballot \nenvelopes, polling locations, poll workers, and cleaning equipment.30 As Defendants encouraged \nvoters to vote absentee, local clerks across the state estimated a shortage of 600,000 envelopes.  \n47.  On March 20, 2020, a bipartisan group of mayors from Green Bay, Appleton, and \nNeenah urged that the election be delayed. At that point, there were 216 confirmed cases and \nthree Wisconsinites had died.31 The same day, this Court ordered extended online voter \nregistration until March 30, 2020.

Widespread Disenfranchisement in the April 7 Election \n58.  The fears surrounding the administration of the election were realized. Neil \nAlbrecht, the Executive Director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, stated that “[i]t was \nchaos, and chaos is never good for the administration of an election.”39 MIT Professor Charles \nStewart III, a leading empirical scholar of election administration, has estimated that poll \nclosings kept more than 16,000 people from casting ballots in Milwaukee alone.40 Clerks never \nsent absentee ballots to over 11,000 voters who requested them,41 and more than 14% of \nabsentee ballots requested and sent to voters were not received back for counting as of April 8, in \nsignificant part as a result of mail delays.42 \n59.  Moreover, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services has identified 52 cases \nof COVID-19 among poll workers and voters who were at in-person voting locations during the \nApril 7 election and could have contracted the disease at those locations.43  \n60.  Defendants’ administration of the April 7 election failed on numerous \ndimensions, described in detail below. These failures caused substantial disenfranchisement, \nparticularly among elderly voters, voters with disabilities, immunocompromised voters, and \nvoters of color. Fundamentally, Defendants lacked a coherent, effective plan to ensure that each \n                                                 \nCoronavirus Map and Case Count, N.Y.

Defendants’ Failure to Manage Online Registration and Absentee Ballot Problems \nDisenfranchised Voters \n \n61.  Defendants failed to maintain digital systems sufficient to meet the needs of \nWisconsin voters with respect to online registration and absentee ballot requests. \n62.  Wisconsin law requires eligible voters to register in order to cast a ballot. Wis. \nStat. § 6.27. Eligible voters can register in person or by mail until 5:00 p.m. on the third \nWednesday before election day, or online until 11:59 p.m. on the third Wednesday before \nelection day. Wis. Stat. § 6.28(1). Thus, for the April 7 election, the deadline for registration was \nset by statute on March 18, 2020. With respect to online registration, this Court’s Order \nsubsequently extended the deadline until March 30, 2020. Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. \nBostelmann, No. 20-CV-249-WMC, 2020 WL 1320819, at *9 (W.D. Wis. Mar. 20, 2020). \n63.  Those who miss these deadlines can register at the municipal clerk’s office until \nclose of business on the Friday before election day, Wis. Stat. § 6.29(2)(a), or in person on \nelection day. See generally Wis. Stat. § 6.55.  \n64.  Eligible voters who register to vote electronically or by mail must provide a copy \nof an “identifying document that establishes proof of residence.” Wis. Stat. § 6.34(2). To do so, \nthey must not only have access to the document, but be able to upload or photocopy it. The only \nexception to this requirement is for individuals registering electronically, who do not have to \nprovide such documentation if they provide “the number of a current and valid operator’s license \n[or] identification card.” Wis. Stat. § 6.34(2m). To vote at polls, eligible voters must present an \napproved voter ID. Wis. Stat. § 6.79. \n21 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 23 of 70\n \n65.  The Wisconsin Division of Motor Vehicles (“DMV”) is responsible for issuing all \ndriver’s license, state ID, or official voter ID cards to Wisconsin residents. Many people can still \nonly obtain a qualifying voter ID by actually visiting a DMV office in person, including those \nwho are applying for a Wisconsin identification card for the first time, or who have not held a \nqualifying Wisconsin ID in recent years. Many of those in this category are voters with \ndisabilities. \n66.  Wisconsin allows voters to vote by absentee ballot without providing an excuse \nfor why they cannot vote in person. See Wis. Stat. § 6.20. Eligible voters can request an absentee \nballot by mail; in person at the municipal clerk’s office; by signing a statement and requesting to \nreceive an absentee ballot under special procedures for voters who are indefinitely confined; by \nan agent, under special procedures for voters who are hospitalized; by delivery to a special \nvoting deputy; or by e-mail or fax. Wis. Stat. § 6.86(1)(a).  \n67.  Defendants administer the digital systems that track voter registration and \nabsentee balloting. MyVote is the public-facing website that allows eligible voters to review \ngeneral information, register to vote, request an absentee ballot, view the contents of their ballot, \nview their voting history, and find their polling place. WisVote is Wisconsin’s statewide voter \nlist and election-management database, accessible to election officials.  \n68.  When a request for an absentee ballot is made by a voter in the MyVote website, \nthe system converts it into an email. Next, a municipal elections clerk must review the email to \nverify the voter’s identification, manually enter the information into WisVote, and print mailing \nlabels.44 \n                                                 \n44 Chen, et al., ‘They Should Have Done Something’: Broad Failures Fueled Wisconsin Ballot Crisis, Investigation \nShows. \n22 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 24 of 70\n \n69.  MyVote has seen increased traffic in the last few years. It has experienced outages \nsince at least early 2020, which Defendant Wolfe acknowledged in a memorandum on February \n18, 2020.45 Defendants failed to take sufficient action to remedy and prevent those outages, and \nas a result the outages continued during high-demand periods in the run-up to the April 7 \nelection. During the specific periods of time that voters sought to register to vote or request an \nabsentee ballot for that election, the MyVote website suffered from outages and was sometimes \nerroneously closed to new requests.46  \n70.  Absentee ballot requests also caused problems for the system.47 \n71.  An investigation by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, FRONTLINE, and \nColumbia Journalism Investigations into Wisconsin’s April 7 election named the “[i]nadequate \ncomputer system” as one of the main problems in the election. 48 It found eligible voters in Lodi, \nPewaukee, Marshfield, Shorewood, and Bristol who had trouble requesting absentee ballots \nonline, either because the system simply crashed or because they had to give up after spending \nhours in front of a computer trying to make their request. The investigation also found that—\nacross eight cities—Wisconsin voters said they requested absentee ballots only to be later \ninformed that the state’s system had no record of their request.49  \n72.  Defendants do not appear to have secured the server capacity and bandwidth \nnecessary to support the surge of online registrations and online absentee ballot requests that was \ninevitable for an election conducted under the threat of COVID-19. \n                                                 \n45 Wis.

Defendants did not take action to divert traffic away from the website, such as \nmailing to every registered voter an absentee ballot request form.  \n74.  Defendant Wolfe wrote in a memorandum after the election that the WisVote \nsystem “performed very well but required round the clock monitoring and auditing to handle this \nunique and unprecedented user behavior and traffic.”50  \n75.  In the same memorandum, she acknowledged with respect to MyVote that “there \nwere unique challenges and obstacles for some voters at the election,” while maintaining that \nCommission staff had been successful in “accommodating a significant level of voter turnout.” \nId. at 4. \nB.  Defendants’ Failures to Ensure Distribution of Requested Absentee Ballots \nDisenfranchised Voters \n \n76.  Defendants failed to ensure that voters who requested absentee ballots timely \nreceived them, resulting in the disenfranchisement of those, like immunocompromised voters, \nunable to vote in person. \n77.  Under Wisconsin law, voters can request absentee ballots until 5:00 p.m. on the \nfifth day before an election, and in-person requests must be made at the municipal clerk’s office \nby the Sunday preceding an election. Wis. Stat. § 6.86(1)(b). Municipal clerks must send an \nabsentee ballot within one business day of when the request was received. Wis. Stat. § 7.15(cm). \n78.  For the April 7 election, the deadline for the receipt of absentee ballot requests \nwas set by statute as April 2, 2020. With respect to mail, fax, or email absentee ballot requests, \nthis Court’s Order subsequently extended the deadline to April 3, 2020.

Wisconsin law requires voters to present a copy of their proof of identification \nwith their application for an absentee ballot. Wis. Stat. § 6.86(1)(ac). \n80.  Approximately 73% of votes ultimately cast in the April 7 election were absentee \nballots;51 by contrast, in the 2016 General Election, just 27% of the votes were cast absentee.52  \n81.  However, many voters, especially immunocompromised voters, were unable to \nparticipate in the April 7 election as a result of Defendants’ failures to ensure effective and \ntimely distribution of absentee ballots.  \n82.  Wisconsin Elections Commission data show that on election day, more than \n12,000 requested absentee ballots had not yet been sent to voters. Voters around the state who \nhad timely requested absentee ballots never received them. One survey found that voters from \nalmost 100 Wisconsin cities and towns reported not receiving an absentee ballot, despite having \nrequested one—in most cases at least two weeks in advance of the election.53 \n83.  Moreover, according to the Commission’s website, 14.5% of 1,284,438 absentee \nballots sent to voters (over 186,000 votes) had not been returned by April 13, 2020.54 In \ncomparison, in the 2016 general election, only 14,480, or 1.7%, of the 845,243 absentee ballots \n                                                 \n51 Chen, et al., ‘They Should Have Done Something’: Broad Failures Fueled Wisconsin Ballot Crisis, Investigation \nShows. \n52 Wis.

These data do not take into account how \nmany of the returned ballots were actually counted. One estimate put the number of returned \nballots that were not counted because of mail delays and confusion about deadlines in the tens of \nthousands.56 \n84.  Several problems contributed to this failure to ensure effective distribution of \nabsentee ballots: \n  First, a shortage of envelopes appears to have delayed the mailing of absentee \nballots. On March 18, for example, Defendants noted that clerks across the state \nestimated a shortage of approximately 600,000 envelopes.57 Although Defendants \nworked with paper suppliers to address the shortage, it created a backlog that \ncontributed to delays.58 \n  Second, election clerks struggled to keep up with the large volume of absentee \nballot requests, and Defendants did not provide them with additional funding or \nstaff to help. The Madison City Clerk reported that there was “no way humanly \npossible” for officials to mail out ballots at the rate they were receiving requests, \ndespite working 110 hours a week.59 She suggested that exhausted officials were \n                                                 \n55 Wis.

Indeed, some voters \nreported receiving multiple ballots, while one couple reported receiving empty \nenvelopes without a ballot. Another voter did not receive a ballot until after the \nelection because it had been mailed without a street name and had been returned \nto the clerk’s office as undeliverable.  \n  Third, mail delivery problems, of which Defendants were on notice, contributed \nto this failure. Defendants were aware of “potential delays in mail delivery” by \nthe United States Postal Service (“USPS”) as early as March 18, and, although \nDefendants sought to stay in touch with USPS to learn about delays and \n“encouraged clerks to communicate and coordinate with local post offices,” this \nresponse was insufficient.60 \n85.  The problems turned out to be overwhelming. In Milwaukee, numerous voters \nnever received an absentee ballot even though their ballots had been issued two weeks before the \nelection. In the week leading up to the election, Fox Point Village Hall received returns from \nUSPS of 100 to 150 undelivered absentee ballots per day, with officials making at least seven \ntrips to the post office to re-mail the undelivered ballots.61 On the morning of the election, \nofficials received a plastic mail bin containing 175 absentee ballots that appeared to have never \nbeen sent to voters, including several ballots intended for a different municipality.62 The day \n                                                 \n60 Wis.

Defendants failed to ensure a uniform appropriate response to these challenges, \nand as a result, voters’ ability to cast a ballot that would be counted varied widely and arbitrarily, \ndepending on the location of the residential address at which they were registered to vote. For \nexample, to ensure the orderly distribution of absentee ballots to voters who wanted to avoid in-\nperson voting, some municipalities, including Whitefish Bay and Bayside, mailed every \nregistered voter within the municipality an absentee ballot request form.64 Those municipalities \nexperienced significantly higher rates of voter participation than did most municipalities that did \nnot take this step.  \n87.  All of this makes clear that Defendants failed to ensure that all registered voters \nwho timely requested absentee ballots received them in time to participate in the April 7 election.  \nC.  Defendants’ Failure to Make Adequate Provisions for Voters to Return Absentee Ballots \nDisenfranchised Voters \n88.  Wisconsin law provides that absentee ballots must be “delivered to the polling \nplace no later than 8 p.m. on election day.” Wis. Stat. § 6.87(6). This means that absentee ballots \nmust be physically received by that time in order to count.  \n89.  With respect to the April 7 election, this Court’s Order enjoined “the enforcement \nof the requirement under Wis. Stat. § 6.87(6) that absentee ballots must be received by 8:00 p.m. \non election day to be counted and extend[ed] the deadline for receipt of absentee ballots to 4:00 \np.m. on April 13, 2020.” Democratic Nat’l Comm. v.

Wis. Apr. 2, 2020). On April 6, the U.S. \nSupreme Court partially stayed that injunction, requiring that “a voter’s absentee ballot must be \neither (i) postmarked by election day, April 7, 2020, and received by April 13, 2020, at 4:00 \np.m., or (ii) hand-delivered as provided under state law by April 7, 2020, at 8:00 p.m.” \nRepublican Nat’l Comm. v. Democratic Nat’l Comm., No. 19A1016, __ S. Ct. __, 2020 WL \n1672702, at *2 (Apr. 6, 2020).  \n90.  More than 100,000 absentee ballots were received in the extended window—\nnamely, after April 7 and before April 13.65 \n91.  For many voters, including Plaintiffs Swenson and Nelson, personally delivering \na ballot to the municipal clerk, as anticipated by Wis. Stat. § 6.86(6), was not an option due to \nthe need to maintain social distance to preserve their health. Defendants had acknowledged that \nUSPS was experiencing significant delay issues as early as March 18. However, they nonetheless \nfailed to ensure that the many voters seeking and receiving absentee ballots in the weeks before \nthe election would be able to return them so that their votes could be counted. \n92.  For example, Defendants failed to require that municipalities establish secure \ndrop boxes so that voters could return absentee ballots while maintaining social distancing and \nwithout relying on USPS. Defendant Wolfe issued a memorandum on March 31 that identified \ndrop boxes as an option, but it did not require or even recommend that option.66 \n                                                 \n65 Richard Pildes, How Many Absentee Ballots in WI Came In on Time Because of the Court Decision to Extend the \nReceipt Deadline?, ELECTION LAW BLOG (Apr. 15, 2020), available at https://electionlawblog.org/?p=110746. \n66 Wis.

This failure presented particular difficulties after the Supreme Court’s April 6 \ndecision requiring either that ballots be postmarked by 8 p.m. on April 7 or that they be hand-\ndelivered by that time. 2020 WL 1672702, at *2.  \n94.  Most significantly, Defendants failed to take action to ensure that validly cast \nabsentee ballots without a postmark would be counted. Some voters who responded to this \nCourt’s decision by placing their ballots in the mail on April 7, before the deadline, were \nnonetheless disenfranchised because no postmark appeared on their ballot — a fact entirely \nbeyond the control of those voters. The Madison City Clerk reported several thousand ballots \nmissing a postmark, and some ballots bearing two different postmarks, one dated before April 7 \nand one dated after. Milwaukee, Greenfield, Manitowoc, Fitchburg, and Sister Bay also received \nballots without postmarks. Clerks in Luxembourg and Elm Grove reported ballot envelopes with \npostmarks so light that the date on them was unreadable.  \n95.  Defendants failed to promulgate rules or issue guidance to ensure uniform, \nappropriate treatment of ballots without a postmark that arrived on April 8, the day after the \nelection, be counted, even though the president of the Wisconsin State Association of Letter \nCarriers confirmed that ballots received on April 8 had “almost certainly” been mailed by April \n7.67 \n                                                 \n67 Riley Vetterkind, Elections Commission Deadlocks Over Whether to Count Ballots Without Postmarks, WIS. \nSTATE JOURNAL (Apr. 11, 2020), available at https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections-\ncommission-deadlocks-over-whether-to-count-ballots-without-postmarks/article_74e0285c-76d7-5471-a82e-\n144b78609f48.html.  \n30 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 32 of 70\n \nD.  Defendants’ Enforcement of Wis. Stat. § 6.87(4)’s Witness Requirement Disenfranchised \nVoters at High Risk From COVID-19  \n \n96.  As to voters at elevated risk for COVID-19, including elderly and \nimmunocompromised voters, Wisconsin’s absentee ballot-witnessing requirement effectively \ndenied citizens the right to vote.  \n97.  Under Wisconsin law, absentee ballots must be witnessed and signed by another \nadult citizen who is not a candidate on the ballot. Wis. Stat. § 6.87(4). For elderly and \nimmunocompromised voters, including Plaintiff Swenson, in-person voting was not an option \nbecause of the infection risk presented by contact with other people. But absentee voting also \npresented a risk to the health to these voters because of the requirement that an adult citizen \nwitness them sign the ballot.  \n98.  In Wisconsin, the envelopes in which absentee ballots are returned must include \nthe following language in the “Certification of Voter” box: \nI certify that I exhibited the enclosed ballot unmarked to the witness, that I then in (his)(her) \npresence and in the presence of no other person marked the ballot and enclosed and sealed \nthe same in this envelope in such a manner that no one but myself and any person rendering \nassistance under s. 6.87(5), Wis. Stats., if I requested assistance, could know how I voted. \n \nWis. Stat. § 6.87(2).  \nThe absentee ballot witness is required to certify to the following language:  \nI, the undersigned witness, subject to the penalties of s. 12.60 (1)(b), Wis. Stats., for false \nstatements, certify that I am an adult U.S. citizen and that the above statements are true and \nthe voting procedure was executed as there stated. I am not a candidate for any office on \nthe enclosed ballot (except in the case of an incumbent municipal clerk). I did not solicit \nor advise the elector to vote for or against any candidate or measure. \n \nId. Defendants have promulgated a form envelope for absentee ballots that contains these \ncertifications and provides space for the relevant signatures and witness address information.  \n31 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 33 of 70\n \n99.  Defendants failed to take action to ensure that immunocompromised voters could \nsuccessfully comply with this requirement. Defendant Wolfe issued a memorandum declaring \nthat there were “no exemptions in the law for the witness requirement.”68 Although the \nmemorandum suggested some ways voters might comply with the requirements while \nmaintaining a physical quarantine, Plaintiff Swenson did not believe that she could plausibly use \nthem to keep herself safe and cast a ballot.  \n100.  This Court recognized that the mechanisms were insufficient at least as applied to \ncertain populations, “in particular those who are immunocompromised or elderly.” Democratic \nNat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann, No. 20-CV-249-WMC, ___ F.Supp.3d ___, 2020 WL 1638374, at \n*2- (W.D. Wis. Apr. 2, 2020). This Court’s Order enjoined “the enforcement of Wis. Stat. § \n6.87(2) as to absentee voters who have provided a written affirmation or other statement that \nthey were unable to safely obtain a witness certification despite reasonable efforts to do so, \nprovided that the ballots are otherwise valid.” Id.  \n101.  The following day, April 3, 2020, the Seventh Circuit stayed enforcement of this \naspect of the injunction. Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann, Nos. 20-1538, 1539, 1545, \n1546, Order (7th Cir. Apr. 3, 2020). \n102.  In response, Defendants adopted a rule that disenfranchised Plaintiff Swenson and \nother voters who had complied fully with then-operative law. On April 5, 2020, almost two days \nafter the Commission’s initial advisory notice on the topic, Defendants concluded that “[e]ach \nabsentee ballot for this election must have the required witness signature and address in order to \n                                                 \n68 Wis. Elections Commission, “Absentee Witness Signature Requirement Guidance COVID-19” (Mar. 29, 2020), \navailable at https://elections.wi.gov/node/6790. \n32 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 34 of 70\n \nbe counted, including ballots that were returned when this Court’s original order was in effect for \napproximately 24 hours.”69  \n103.  Defendants’ action invalidated ballots—like that of Plaintiff Swenson—that \ncomplied at the time they were submitted with this Court’s then-valid order and Commission \nguidelines. The only option that Defendants presented for voters who had cast these ballots was \nto present a witness to election officials in person—defeating both social distancing and the \nentire purpose of absentee voting.  \nE.  Defendants Failed to Safeguard the Availability of In-Person Absentee Voting \n104.  Defendants failed to take action to ensure adequate opportunities for in-person \nabsentee voting (also known as “early voting”) throughout the state. In-person absentee voting \nallows voters to apply for and obtain an absentee ballot in person, and then to complete and cast \nthe ballot immediately. This increasingly popular method of voting is particularly important \nduring the pandemic because it accommodates voters who are unable to obtain a mail-in absentee \nballot for a variety of reasons, such as lack of ready access to the online application system, a \ntransient mailing address, homelessness, and other difficulties. It also alleviates the burden on \nelection day voting by spreading out the period of in-person voting and allowing those voters \nwho prefer to vote in-person—perhaps because they do not trust the mail to deliver or return \ntheir ballot—to do so at uncrowded, safer locations at a more convenient time.  \n105.  In-person absentee voting can also be conducted on a “drive through” basis, \nallowing voters to obtain and cast a ballot while minimizing contact with other people or shared \nsurfaces. \n                                                 \n69 Wis. Elections Commission, “Updated Absentee Witness Signature Requirement Guidance - COVID-19” (Apr. 5, \n2020), available at https://elections.wi.gov/node/6816.  \n33 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 35 of 70\n \n106.  During the April 7 election period, Defendants failed to take action to ensure \nadequate in-person absentee voting opportunities, or to ensure that available opportunities were \nproperly publicized. For example, all three of the City of Milwaukee’s in-person absentee voting \nlocations abruptly closed on March 23, 2020, following an announcement the previous day. The \ncity subsequently reopened one early voting site downtown but made it available only as a drive-\nthrough, thereby limiting it to those voters with access to a car. These voting changes were \npoorly publicized, leaving many voters confused or simply unaware of early voting options in \nthe city. Moreover, the closure of early voting locations outside of downtown disproportionately \naffected the ability of residents of low-income and predominantly Black and Latino \nneighborhoods to vote. \n107.  Similarly, in Green Bay, in-person absentee voting opportunities were severely \nlimited. In-person absentee voting was confined to a single site that was only open on ten \nweekdays leading up to the election. On eight of those ten days, voting was limited to four \nmidday hours. Capacity was further limited during in order to permit social distancing.  \n108.  More broadly, opportunities for in-person absentee voting varied dramatically \nacross the state in terms of the number of locations, hours, and manner of voting (i.e., drive \nthrough vs. walk in). These options were also generally poorly publicized. Defendants’ actions \nand inaction with respect to in-person absentee voting thus deprived voters of a safer alternative \nto in-person election day voting and put additional pressure on the mail-in absentee system that \nfailed so many voters.  \nF.  Defendants Failed to Ensure An Adequate Number of Election Day Polling Places  \n109.  Defendants failed to take action to ensure that adequate in-person voting locations \nwould be available to all voters around the state. As a result, in some jurisdictions a high \n34 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 36 of 70\n \nproportion of polling places did not open, and voters who sought to vote in-person—whether \nbecause they had not received an absentee ballot or because they had always intended to vote in \nperson—faced hurdles to casting a ballot.  \n110.  Wisconsin law requires that “[p]olling places shall be established for each \nelection at least 30 days before the election.” Wis. Stat. § 5.25(3).  \n111.  Each of these polling places “shall be accessible to all individuals with \ndisabilities,” and Defendants are charged with the responsibility to ensure that voting systems at \nthese polling places allow voters with disabilities to vote privately and independently. Id. \n§ 5.25(4)(a). \n112.  Voters with disabilities who require the use of assistive technology available to \nthem at polling places have no option to avoid in-person voting. Many other voters require in-\nperson voting options when the online registration system fails or they do not receive a requested \nabsentee ballot on time. Still others vote in person because of the symbolic significance of voting \nat a polling place on election day.  \n113.  Defendants failed to ensure that Wisconsin voters could safely exercise the right \nto vote, including by ensuring an adequate numbers of poll workers—referred to as election \ninspectors by Wisconsin statute—available to operate the number of polling places that would \nenable safe and uncrowded voting.  \n114.  Almost 60 percent of Wisconsin municipalities reported a shortage of poll \nworkers ahead of the April 7 election as volunteers sought to protect themselves against COVID-\n19. These staffing shortages were especially acute because many older poll workers were \nunwilling to risk their health. According to a survey conducted by Defendants prior to the \nelection, 111 voting jurisdictions in Wisconsin believed they would not have enough workers to \n35 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 37 of 70\n \nopen even one polling place on election day, and 126 additional jurisdictions thought they did \nnot have enough workers to open “all desired polling places.”70  \n115.  These massive anticipated poll worker shortages led to unprecedented reductions \nin the number of polling locations in some jurisdictions. Milwaukee faced the most closures of \nany city, opening just 5 of its 180 polling sites. While the city usually has 2,000 election \nworkers, on April 7 it had only 400. One news report noted that some communities with just a \ntenth of Milwaukee’s population had more polling sites open.71  \n116.  Although the Governor eventually mobilized the National Guard to work at the \npolls, many municipalities were not aware of that option until after they had announced poll \nclosures. City of Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Neil Albrecht, who made \na request for National Guard assistance months earlier, said that he learned about the Governor’s \ndecision through media reports.72 Albrecht said that if he had known about the assistance, he \ncould have opened more polling locations in Milwaukee, but it was “too little too late” right \nbefore the election.73 In any event, according to a survey conducted by Defendants, only 2,400 \nNational Guard members were available to address the 7,000 person shortage in poll workers.74  \n117.  As a result, the 19,000 Milwaukee voters who voted in person encountered wait \ntimes of up to two-and-a-half hours. Plaintiff McCurtis waited in line to vote at Washington High \n                                                 \n70 Wis.

When the polls were set to close at 8:00 p.m., hundreds of \nMilwaukee voters were still waiting in line, Plaintiff McCurtis among them.  \n118.  Milwaukee had offered drive-up in-person absentee voting in the days leading up \nto the election, but on the last day it was possible to vote in that manner, lines of cars stretched \nfor blocks downtown and the wait lasted hours.75  \n119.  That Milwaukee was so hard hit by these issues is particularly troubling because \nMilwaukee is home to 69.4% of Wisconsin’s Black population76—meaning that Black \nWisconsin voters were disproportionately likely to be affected by polling place closures. \n120.   In Green Bay, which opened just two of its 31 polling sites because just 17 of its \n270 usual poll workers were able or willing to work,77 voters faced wait times of up to four \nhours.78 In Waukesha, which has a population of 70,000, just one polling location out of the \nusual 15 was open.  \n121.  Defendants’ failures to ensure safe access to polling places on election day also \nresulted in arbitrary disparities, in which whether a voter had access to safe voting options \ndepended on where that voter lives. For example, in stark contrast to Milwaukee and Green Bay, \nin Madison, 66 out of 92 polling sites were open. Madison also began offering curbside voting as \nearly as Friday, April 1 to high-risk voters. While the voting process was altered, it nonetheless \nproceeded smoothly. Similarly, in some rural counties across Wisconsin, voting went more \nsmoothly, without the same extended wait times. \n                                                 \n75 Aaron Maybin, ‘I Had to Go Do This:’ Some Waited 2 Hours on Final Day of Drive-Thru Voting in Milwaukee, \nFOX 6 (Apr. 5, 2020), available at https://fox6now.com/2020/04/05/i-had-to-go-do-this-some-waited-2-hours-on-\nfinal-day-of-drive-thru-voting-in-milwaukee/. \n76 Wis.

PUBLIC RADIO (Apr. 7, 2020), available at \nhttps://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-heads-polls-amid-coronavirus-pandemic.    \n37 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 39 of 70\n \n122.  Nearly a month before the April 7 election, Defendant Wolfe acknowledged that \npoll worker shortages were likely to be a problem, but she did not take action sufficient to \nremedy the problem. While she provided several recruiting suggestions and instructed clerks to \ncontact the Commission if they were experiencing “significant poll worker shortages,” the \n“possible recruitment efforts” that the Commission suggested it might undertake did not solve \nthe problem.79  \n123.  Defendants’ failure to take action here had a particularly significant effect \nbecause underlying legal requirements made it extremely unlikely that municipalities could solve \ntheir poll-worker problems on their own. Wisconsin statutes provide that each election official, \nincluding each inspector, must be “a qualified elector of a county in which the municipality \nwhere the official serves is located.” Wis. Stat. § 7.30(2). The county-residence requirement \nforbids recruiting inspectors from other parts of the state. \n124.  This statute also means that municipalities within the same county can draw from \nthe same pool of inspectors. Defendants did not attempt to facilitate, encourage, or coordinate \nsuch intra-county poll-worker sharing.  \n125.  As a result, significant disparities in the availability of polling places and the \nconcomitant wait to vote persisted even within the same county. For example, while the City of \nMilwaukee experienced the numerous problems described above, other cities within Milwaukee \nCounty looked very different. In Wauwatosa, a city which borders Milwaukee with a population \n                                                 \n79 Wis.

Defendants’ failures with respect to polling place locations and poll workers led \nto a situation in which voters in some Wisconsin jurisdictions—but not others—were forced to \nlocate an unfamiliar polling place to cast a ballot in person and, in some cases, to wait in very \nlong lines to cast a ballot in person, or to forgo voting altogether. \nG.  Defendants’ Failure to Ensure Safe In-Person Voting Resulted in Widespread Voter \nIntimidation \n  \n127.  In conducting an election during a pandemic, Defendants failed to ensure that in-\nperson voting was safe in each jurisdiction around the state. As alleged above, numerous failures \nby Defendants resulted in extremely long lines at polling places. In addition, the availability of \npersonal protective equipment (PPE) for poll workers varied widely around the state. These \nfailures increased the risks that voters faced of contracting COVID-19 from a poll worker. \n128.  Milwaukee was and is the epicenter of Wisconsin's COVID-19 pandemic, and as \nof the April 7 primary election, it accounted for over half of coronavirus cases and 81 percent of \nrelated deaths.81 As a result, the city, which is home to nearly 70 percent of the state’s Black \nresidents, was one of the most dangerous places to vote. Many Milwaukee voters reported being \nafraid to vote in person. Other voters compared voting in person on April 7 to moments in civil \n                                                 \n80 Election Day Blog Recap: Milwaukee Releases Tuesday’s Voter Turnout; Late Lines After Polls Closed, \nMILWAUKEE JOURNAL SENTINEL (Apr. 7. 2020), available at \nhttps://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/07/wisconsin-april-7-presidential-primary-election-updates-\nvoting-pandemic-milwaukee-polling-places/2959757001/. \n81 Ella Nilsen & Li Zhou, How Wisconsin’s Election Disenfranchised Voters, VOX (Apr. 7. 2020), available at \nhttps://www.vox.com/2020/4/7/21212053/wisconsin-election-coronavirus-disenfranchised-voters.  \n39 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 41 of 70\n \nrights history when seeking to cast a ballot meant risking your life.82 Given the disparate racial \nimpact of COVID-19 on the Black community, these comparisons are especially apt. \n129.  The health risk presented by these lines during COVID-19 were objectively \nintimidating to voters. As a result, some voters were actually deterred from voting, opting to stay \nhome or to leave a polling place before casting a ballot rather than wait in line and increase the \nrisk to their physical well-being and the well-being of their families. \n130.  Others, like Plaintiff McCurtis, who chose to remain in line to vote, did so in the \nface of dangerous voting conditions, risking their health in order to exercise the right to vote. \n131.  Numerous voters expressed their fear to reporters and on social media. The \nGovernor acknowledged that voters were “scared of going to the polls.”83 \n132.  Nonetheless, after the election, Defendant Wolfe claimed in her summary \nmemorandum that voters had reported to the Commission “that they felt safe in polling places \nand that there were adequate sanitation supplies.” 84 \nH.  Burdens on Voters with Disabilities \n133.  The Commission’s failures also severely burdened immunocompromised voters \nas well as other voters with disabilities who require assistive technology available only at in-\nperson polling places.   \n                                                 \n82 Christina A.

Voters who are immunocompromised are voters with disabilities during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. These voters must isolate themselves from other people in order to \nminimize the risk that they will contract COVID-19 and experience severe illness or death. As a \nresult, they can cast only absentee ballots; in-person voting is not available to them. \n135.  Because Defendants failed to ensure that all voters who requested absentee ballots \nreceived them and failed to ensure that absentee voters had access to drop boxes to ensure \ndelivery of their ballots, these voters were disenfranchised. They were also disenfranchised by \nthe witness verification requirement to the extent these immunocompromised voters could not \nsafely secure a witness to verify their ballot. \n136.  Some voters with disabilities, like blind voters, must utilize assistive technology \navailable only at in-person polling locations in order to vote privately and independently.  \n137.  Some voters fall into both of these categories—they are immunocompromised and \nrequire the use of assistive technology at an in-person polling place. These voters had no safe \nopportunity to vote privately and independently, and they were therefore disenfranchised.   \nIV.  Absent Judicial Intervention, These Failures Are Practically Certain to Recur in \nAugust and November \n \n138.  When Defendants administer the August and November elections, the COVID-19 \npandemic will be ongoing. As a result, regardless of the precise circumstances of the pandemic \non those election days, the demand for online registration and absentee voting will remain \nelevated, and safety measures to protect in-person voters will remain vital. However, as the April \n7 election showed, Defendants do not have policies or other measures in place to ensure safe \nvoting in the upcoming August and November elections.  \nA.

As of the time of this filing, there have been 11,275 cases reported in Wisconsin \nand 434 deaths.85  \n140.  As of this filing, approximately 294 new cases are diagnosed each day in \nWisconsin, as measured by the seven-day average.86 The rate of COVID-19 confirmed cases in \nmetropolitan areas continues to grow. In Green Bay, Janesville-Beloit, Appleton, and Racine, the \ndaily growth rate of confirmed cases is over 7%. And some metropolitan areas are seeing \ncontinually increasing growth rates.87 It is not yet clear whether Wisconsin has reached the peak \nof this initial wave of infections.88 \n141.  It is unlikely that a vaccine will be available until at least 2021,89 and until then, \nthe country will need to continue to take precautions to minimize the spread of COVID-19.90 \n142.  Experts predict that there will be multiple peaks in Wisconsin, with their timing \ntied directly to the duration of the Safer At Home Order and the availability of testing.91 \n                                                 \n85 Wis.

According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and \nInfectious Diseases, a second round of COVID-19 cases in the United States is “inevitable” in \nthe fall.92 \n144.  The Commission is scheduled to conduct two more elections in 2020: the August \n11, 2020 partisan primary and the November 3, 2020 general election. On each of these dates, it \nis overwhelmingly likely that COVID-19 transmission will continue in Wisconsin, that no \nvaccine will exist, and that many voters will accordingly retain an objectively reasonable fear of \nthe risk to their physical safety presented by traditional in-person voting.  \nB.  Turnout in November Will Exacerbate Problems \n145.  If Defendants’ election system was unable to ensure that voters in April were \nenfranchised during the COVID-19 pandemic, it will be that much more inadequate in November \nabsent significant changes.  \n146.  Nearly three million Wisconsin voters cast ballots in the 2016 presidential \nelection.93 With experts predicting higher than usual voter turnout nationwide this November,94 \nthe number of Wisconsin voters who seek to participate in the presidential election is likely to be \nmore than twice the 1.5 million voters who participated in the April 7 election.95 \n147.  If the proportion of voters seeking to cast absentee ballots in the November \nelection is similar to the proportion in April, Defendants’ system would need to be equipped to \n                                                 \n92 Nicole Chavez, Another Wave of Coronavirus Will Likely Hit the US in the Fall.

Defendants must equip municipal and county clerks to successfully count this \nunprecedented number of absentee ballots. \nC.  Defendants Have Not Taken Steps Sufficient to Correct the Ongoing Problems \nwith Wisconsin Elections under COVID-19 \n \n149.  While Defendants have announced some actions that they plan to take to improve \nupon the administration of the April 7 election, these actions are not sufficient to ensure that \nsubsequent elections during the pandemic will protect voters’ rights under the Constitution and \nfederal statutes.  \n150.  First, Defendants have not taken sufficient action to ensure that MyVote will be \nable to support the large-scale online registration and at-home absentee voting which will \ncontinue to be necessary during the impending August and November elections. In her April 7 \nElection Summary Memorandum, Defendant Wolfe wrote on this topic that staff would “work to \naugment voter workflows for online voter registration and absentee ballot requests.”96 The \nmemorandum did not address outages or mention securing additional capacity.  \n151.  Absent significant improvement of computer-system infrastructure, Wisconsin \nvoters will not have adequate access to online absentee ballots or online registration during the \nAugust and November elections.  \n                                                 \n96 Wis. Elections Commission, “Summary of April 7, 2020 Election” (April 18, 2020), available at \nhttps://elections.wi.gov/sites/elections.wi.gov/files/2020-\n04/April%207%20Election%20Summary%20and%20Next%20Steps.pdf.    \n44 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 46 of 70\n \n152.  Second, Defendants have failed to take sufficient action to ensure that voters who \ntimely request absentee ballots for subsequent 2020 elections will receive those ballots in time to \nparticipate in those elections. On this topic, Defendant Wolfe’s memorandum stated that staff \n“hopes to incorporate intelligent mail barcodes into the absentee process and incorporate that \ninformation into the MyVote system,” but offers no concrete commitment or contingency plan. \n(emphasis added).97 \n153.  Although the City of Milwaukee has announced that it will distribute absentee \nballot request forms to each registered voter in advance of the November election, Defendants \nhave not indicated that they will provide or seek to facilitate this opportunity for all Wisconsin \nvoters, thereby dramatically increasing the likelihood that the expected late surge in absentee \nballot requests before a presidential election conducted during a pandemic will overwhelm the \nsystem and lead to further disenfranchisement. And because some municipalities will invariably \nbecome more overwhelmed than others, this expected late surge will exacerbate the unequal \naccess and opportunities for voters in different municipalities. \n154.  Without mailed distribution of absentee ballot request forms, Wisconsin voters on \nthe wrong side of the digital divide—who lack internet access or familiarity with online \nresources—are particularly likely to be disenfranchised because they will not be able to access \nMyVote in order to easily request an absentee ballot. Black, Latino, elderly, and rural voters are \ndisproportionately likely to be on the wrong side of the digital divide.98  \n                                                 \n97 Id. \n98 U.S. Census Bureau, “The Digital Divide: Percentage of Households by Broadband Internet Subscription, \nComputer Type, Race and Hispanic Origin” (Sept. 11, 2017), available at \nhttps://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2017/comm/internet.html; Andrew Perrin, Digital Gap Between Rural \nand Nonrural America Persists, PEW RESEARCH CENTER (May 31, 2019), available at \nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/31/digital-gap-between-rural-and-nonrural-america-persists/; \nAndrea Caumont, Who’s not online? 5 factors tied to the digital divide, PEW RESEARCH CENTER (May 31, 2019), \navailable at https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/11/08/whos-not-online-5-factors-tied-to-the-digital-\ndivide/. \n45 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 47 of 70\n \n155.  Third, Defendants have failed to take sufficient action to ensure that all voters \nwho receive absentee ballots can cast their ballots and have them counted.  \n156.  The statutory deadline for requesting an absentee ballot is just five days before \nelection day, Wis. Stat. § 6.86(1)(b), and clerks can wait up to one business day before mailing a \nballot. Wis. Stat. § 7.15(cm). Defendants have acknowledged that postal mail can take up to a \nweek to transport a ballot both from clerk to voter and voter back to clerk, for a total of two \nweeks. As a result, some voters who timely request absentee ballots, receive them, cast their \nvotes, and timely return them by postal mail will still be disenfranchised. Nonetheless, \nDefendants have failed to require or facilitate the availability of secure drop boxes in each \nmunicipality for the socially distant return of absentee ballots.  \n157.  Even with drop boxes, absent judicial relief ensuring that mailed absentee ballots \npostmarked by election day are accepted for counting, some voters who timely request absentee \nballots will inevitably be disenfranchised again.  \n158.  Defendants have no policy or other measures in place to create any more \nworkable alternatives for voters at high risk from COVID-19, especially immunocompromised \nvoters, who cannot safely comply with the witnessing requirements for absentee ballots set forth \nin Wis. Stat. § 6.87(2). \n159.  Fourth, Defendants have no policy or other measures in place to ensure that \nvoters statewide have sufficient access to in-person absentee voting opportunities, including both \nwalk-in early voting and drive-through early voting. In-person absentee voting is essential for \nthose who are unable, for a variety of reasons, to obtain an absentee ballot by mail or through the \nonline system. It is also essential in order to spread out in-person voting over a longer period, \n46 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 48 of 70\n \nthereby reducing the likelihood that election day polling locations will be overwhelmed and \nallowing better compliance with safety precautions against spread of coronavirus. \n160.  Fifth, Defendants, although recognizing the critical shortage of poll workers that \nled to widespread polling place closures, have no policy or other measure in place to facilitate \nrecruitment of poll workers or provide assistance in facilitating the equitable distribution of poll \nworkers within counties. Instead, Defendant Wolfe’s memorandum stated that the Commission \nwould (1) “work with” and “survey” jurisdictions to keep abreast of their shortages; (2) maintain \na ticket for personnel with the State Emergency Operations Center; and (3) develop training for \nlast-minute poll-worker certification.99  \n161.  Sixth, Defendants have failed to take adequate action to ensure that in-person \nabsentee and election day polling places will be safe during the August and November elections, \nand that voters are made aware in advance of these changes so that the failures of the April 7 \nelection do not have an intimidating effect on voters in August and November. While Defendant \nWolfe wrote that, for the August and November elections, Commission staff would assist \njurisdictions in finding sanitary supplies and masks and gloves for poll workers, Defendants have \ntaken no action to require voters or poll workers to wear masks or take other precautions to \nensure that voters feel secure in appearing at polling places.100 \n162.  Seventh, Defendants have not put forward a plan to ensure that all members of \nthe voting public have the information they need to register online, request an absentee ballot, \nand successfully return that ballot, so that no one at high risk for COVID-19 and thus unable to \nvote in person is disenfranchised in August or November. They have not put forward a plan to \n                                                 \n99 Wis. Elections Commission, “Summary of April 7, 2020 Election.”  \n100 Id.  \n47 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 49 of 70\n \nensure that voters on the wrong side of the digital divide have the information they need to \nregister and request an absentee ballot.  \n163.  As a result of these failures, the harms experienced by the voters of Wisconsin, \nand by Plaintiffs in particular, are overwhelmingly likely to recur in the August and September \nelections absent relief here. \nV.  Plaintiffs’ Injuries \nJill Swenson \n164.  Plaintiff Jill Swenson is sixty-one years old and has, among other serious \nailments, early stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”), an inflammatory lung \ndisease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. Ms. Swenson is in one of the highest-risk \npopulations for COVID-19.  \n165.  Ms. Swenson is a regular voter and makes it her usual practice to vote in person \non election day. This year, because of her age and health, Ms. Swenson felt unsafe voting in \nperson at her polling location or returning an absentee ballot in person at Appleton City Hall. \nAfter several unsuccessful attempts to scan in her identification, she successfully requested a \nmail-in absentee ballot online at the end of February. It arrived about a week later.  \n166.  By March 11, Ms. Swenson had begun to self-quarantine. She did not leave her \nhome or interact with others in person. Ms. Swenson was unable to find anyone who could safely \nwitness her ballot. Her friends and neighbors were either failing to practice social distancing, still \nworking at essential businesses, or recently recovered from possible COVID-19. \n167.  On March 31, Ms. Swenson contacted the Commission for advice on how to \nsubmit her ballot. The Commission told Ms. Swenson to have someone come to her home and \nhand the ballot back-and-forth through a window or door. It also pointed her to a website with \n48 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 50 of 70\n \nguidance suggesting that voters leave their ballot outside for day before a witness handles the \nballot, and then wait another day before handling the witnessed ballot. Ms. Swenson did not feel \nsafe inviting anyone over. The Commission also told Ms. Swenson she could bring her absentee \nballot to Appleton City Hall, but she felt unsafe doing so because interacting with staff and other \nmembers of the public could cause her serious illness or death.  \n168.  When Ms. Swenson learned about the Court’s April 2 order allowing voters to \nsubmit un-witnessed absentee ballots by mail, she completed and mailed her absentee ballot \nimmediately, with a note stating that she lived alone, feared contracting COVID-19, and could \nnot find a witness, and that she was submitting an unwitnessed ballot in conformity with the \ncourt order. Later that day, the Seventh Circuit stayed enforcement of that Order. Several days \nlater, Ms. Swenson learned through news reports that her ballot would be invalidated and that her \nvote would not count. She was deeply upset; she cherishes exercising her right to vote.  \n169.  Ms. Swenson was not aware of any opportunity to cure the defect with her \nabsentee ballot and knew that attempting to vote in person after submitting even an invalidated \nabsentee ballot would be unlawful.  \n170.  If the witnessing requirement remains in effect during the August and November \nelections, Ms. Swenson will not have a safe way to vote—and to ensure her vote is counted—in \nWisconsin’s August and November elections.  \nMelody McCurtis \n171.  Plaintiff Melody McCurtis lives in the Sherman Park neighborhood of \nMilwaukee, Wisconsin. She is a lifelong voter who votes in almost every election, large or small. \nShe lives in a multi-generational household that includes her mother, who has hypertension, high \nblood pressure, and an enlarged heart, putting her at increased risk of COVID-19 complications. \n49 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 51 of 70\n \nAs a community organizer, Ms. McCurtis was aware of the disparate impact that COVID-19 had \nhad on the Black community in Milwaukee. Her polling location at Washington High School is \nlocated in Sherman Park, the epicenter of the COVID-19 crisis in the Black community. \nKnowing all this, Ms. McCurtis requested an absentee ballot on March 22.  \n172.  Ms. McCurtis’s ballot never arrived. On April 6, Ms. McCurtis called the Clerk’s \noffice, but there was no answer. She called again on April 7, and was told that she had no choice \nbut to vote in person. Although Ms. McCurtis’s mother was afraid of Ms. McCurtis voting in \nperson, Ms. McCurtis joined the blocks-long line outside of Washington High School around \n6:30 p.m. on election day. She cast her ballot at 9:09 p.m.  \n173.  During the wait of more than two-and-a-half hours, Ms. McCurtis experienced \nintimidation, fear, and frustration. Voters in line were not able to practice social distancing due to \nthe large number of people in line and the failure of election officials to enforce the practice. The \npolling location did not provide PPE for voters, and it had run out of sanitary pens. Ms. McCurtis \nobserved seniors and individuals with disabilities waiting in the long line. In addition, there was \na noticeably high police presence, including the National Guard. Yet despite the high police \npresence, no one stopped a young woman who spent over an hour dancing along the line of \nvoters, entering voters’ personal space and creating a health risk for those in line.  \n174.  As she waited in line, Ms. McCurtis observed a member of the National Guard \napproach and speak to a female voter. The woman stepped out of line and left. That National \nGuard member then approached Ms. McCurtis and said “You know this will be a two-hour wait, \nright?” The National Guard member appeared to be discouraging voters from remaining in line. \nMs. McCurtis asked him to stop speaking to voters and refrain from discouraging voters from \nremaining in line, but she was not able to monitor whether he did so. This experience deeply hurt \n50 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 52 of 70\n \nMs. McCurtis, who is a community organizer focused on encouraging Metcalfe Park community \nmembers to vote.  \n175.  Ms. McCurtis still feels the traumatic impact of being subjected to such an unsafe \nvoting experience; the heavy police presence and long line of Black voters reminded her of the \nviolence surrounding earlier generations of Black Americans’ efforts to vote. On April 7, she felt \nafraid for her health and physical safety, and the health and physical safety of her community. In \nlight of her experience in April, Ms. McCurtis reasonably fears that she will not be able to \nexercise her right to vote in August and November without exposing herself, and therefore her \nmother, to significant health risks.  \nMaria Nelson \n176.  Plaintiff Maria Nelson has breast cancer and is currently undergoing \nchemotherapy treatment. She is also a regular voter and enjoys taking her two young children to \nthe polls to teach them the importance of voting. Because of highly publicized reports explaining \nthat immunocompromised individuals are most at risk from the COVID-19 pandemic, Ms. \nNelson felt unsafe voting in person at her polling location on election day. Because of this, on \nMarch 31, she timely emailed the Appleton City Clerk and requested an absentee ballot. She \nreceived a call in response from the Clerk’s office stating that the Clerk’s office would be \nsending an absentee ballot by mail. Ms. Nelson agreed, assuming that the Clerk’s office was \naccurately representing its ability to send her a timely ballot.  \n177.  Ms. Nelson’s absentee ballot did not arrive before April 7. Instead, it arrived on \nApril 8, too late to be used. On election day, Ms. Nelson was not able to vote in person because \nshe felt too unsafe and was not willing to risk her life by voting in person. As a result, Mrs. \nNelson was disenfranchised.  \n51 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 53 of 70\n \n178.  If Defendants do not remedy the defects in the in-person and absentee voting \nsystems, Ms. Nelson will not have a safe and reliable way to cast a ballot in the August and \nNovember elections. \nBlack Leaders Organizing for Communities \n179.  Plaintiff BLOC mobilizes Black Wisconsinites to participate at all levels of \ngovernment and encourages communities of color to fulfill their potential for electoral impact in \nMilwaukee. As part of its work, BLOC educates the Black community in Milwaukee about voter \neligibility rules, voter ID requirements, the importance of voting, and the opportunity for early \nvoting. BLOC primarily operates as a robust field program. For example, BLOC knocked on \napproximately 227,000 doors in Milwaukee in 2018, encouraging Black residents to engage in \ncivic participation, including voting. Ahead of the April 7 election, BLOC had hired 50 \nambassadors to knock on an anticipated 44,000 doors. Each ambassador went through more than \n30 hours of civics training, including training on registering voters and how to vote. Much of that \ntraining became out of date as Defendants’ policies and deadlines shifted again and again in the \ndays leading up to April 7. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, BLOC ambassadors have \nreduced capacity and are working half of their ordinary hours. BLOC is paying ambassadors for \ntheir full hours. \n180.  In light of Defendants’ failures to provide adequate and safe voting opportunities \nin the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, BLOC had to uproot its highly effective field program \nand divert significant resources to digital outreach to Black Wisconsin voters, including \nimplementing a texting and phone-banking campaign to educate voters on how to cast mail-in \nabsentee ballots. This required setting up new technological tools, and training BLOC’s \nambassadors on those tools remotely. While BLOC would inevitably had to have made changes \n52 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 54 of 70\n \nto its field program in light of COVID-19, Defendants’ policies and practices significantly \nincreased that burden. As deadlines and absentee ballot requirements shifted, BLOC had to \nrepeatedly push out additional training and information to its remote staff and ensure that \nupdated messages were being sent to constituents. BLOC’s staff created graphics and social \nmedia posts for every new deadline and policy change; ordinarily, minimal new content would \nbe created, and BLOC would be able to reuse any new content. BLOC will be unable to reuse \nmost of the new content created for April.  \n181.  BLOC was also unable to fulfill its mission of encouraging Black Wisconsinites \nto vote. BLOC had to contact voters multiple times as policies changed. Each call was longer \nthan usual, as BLOC staff spent time explaining confusing online systems, helping voters scan \nidentification over the phone, and walked them through changing deadlines. Because of this, and \nbecause BLOC staff had been and continues to work reduced hours, BLOC was unable to meet \nits goals for voter contacts leading up to the April 7 election (but at the same cost to BLOC). But \nfor Defendants’ failures, much of this work would have been unnecessary. Instead, BLOC would \nhave focused on traditional get-out-the-vote efforts, speaking to voters about candidates and \nissues. BLOC was not able to have those conversations with voters this year and, because of the \nnumerous barriers facing its constituents, was not able to meet its goals related to getting \nsignificant numbers of the Black community to vote.  \n182.  BLOC’s organizational planning for the summer and fall are on hold, because \nBLOC has no way of knowing what policies or deadlines will be in place for the August and \nNovember elections. Many voters with whom BLOC works did not receive an absentee ballot by \nApril 7, 2020. Others found the absentee ballot request system confusing and difficult to use. \nMany of those voters feared for their health and safety due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, \n53 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 55 of 70\n \nincluding because COVID-19 has disproportionately affected the Black community. They were \ntoo afraid to vote in person on April 7. As a result, those voters were disenfranchised and unable \nto cast a ballot in the election.  \n183.  Absent relief here, many voters with whom BLOC works will be similarly \ndisenfranchised and burdened during subsequent elections. As a result, BLOC will be forced to \ncontinue to divert resources in order to attempt to enfranchise these voters, to counteract the \nuncertainty Defendants’ policies and practices are creating, and to reach the increased number of \nBlack voters facing unsafe voting conditions.  \n184.  Although BLOC has invested heavily in building community trust in the election \nsystem and building community power through civic engagement, BLOC is now faced with re-\nbuilding that trust after many of the voters with whom BLOC works were disenfranchised due to \nDefendants’ failures. This shift in programmatic focus will likely mean generating new \nmessaging and outreach campaigns. The lost trust created by Defendants’ failures and the \ndisenfranchisement of BLOC’s constituents has made it harder for BLOC to achieve its mission.  \nDisability Rights Wisconsin \n185.  Plaintiff DRW’s mission is to address the issues facing, and to ensure the rights \nof, all people with disabilities in Wisconsin. DRW has a state and federal mandate to protect and \nadvocate for the rights of people with disabilities in Wisconsin, including those with \ndevelopmental disabilities, mental illness, and traumatic brain injury. As part of this mandate, \nDRW oversees self-advocacy training and other programs and services to assist people with \ndisabilities, including to secure election access, including registering to vote, accessing polling \nplaces, and casting their ballot. DRW also leads the Wisconsin Disability Vote Coalition.  \n54 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 56 of 70\n \n186.  In light of Defendants’ failures to provide adequate and safe voting opportunities \nin the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, DRW had to produce numerous resources and trainings \nahead of the April 7 election that it would not have otherwise produced, at the expense of staff \ntime and DRW’s other programmatic priorities. For example, DRW organized four Zoom \nbriefings to explain the special circumstances and changing policies around the April 7 election. \nAs requirements changed, DRW had to update and rewrite resources provided to voters five to \nsix times, including its popular Election FAQ document. With each update, DRW staff had to \nspend time liaising with the Commission to make sure they were conveying accurate \ninformation. Ordinarily, DRW would have to create only a single version of these materials. \nDRW also had to attend emergency meetings of the Commission, prepare for at least two \nunplanned calls with WEC, and coordinate on an emergency basis with other Wisconsin \norganizations to ensure voters were getting accurate information.  \n187.  Because of this unplanned and additional work, significant staff time was spent \nresponding to Defendants’ failures and informing DRW’s constituents about how to vote. This \nstaff time was diverted from other DRW priorities, such as creating key reference materials for \nparents of children with serious disabilities, completing federal grant reporting requirements, and \ncoordinating Wisconsin’s Mental Health Task Force. \n188.  DRW continues to have to divert resources in response to Defendants’ failures \nand in anticipation of future disenfranchisement, if policies are not changed. DRW has devoted \nsignificant staff time to organizing Zoom briefings for the May 12 election, and it is currently \ncoordinating with other Wisconsin groups on a joint voter-education plan for future elections, \nand developing a campaign to encourage voters to vote absentee. As a part of campaign \nplanning, DRW is conducting in-depth research, including interviews, on how other states \n55 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 57 of 70\n \nprovide for accessible absentee voting. None of this work was previously planned, and all of it \ntakes staff time away from previously planned work and affects DRW’s ability to fulfill its \nmission.  \n189.  Many of the Wisconsinites with disabilities on whose behalf DRW advocates face \nsignificant obstacles to voting as a result of coronavirus. They will either be disenfranchised or \nexposed to heightened risk of illness if their legal rights to safely vote are not vindicated. DRW \nalso brings this suit on their behalf. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount 1: Violation of Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act \n(All Plaintiffs) \n \n190.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n191.  Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act provides that:  \nNo person, whether acting under color of law or otherwise, shall intimidate, threaten, or \ncoerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any person for voting or attempting to \nvote, or intimidate, threaten, or coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any \nperson for urging or aiding any person to vote or attempt to vote, or intimidate, threaten, \nor coerce any person for exercising any powers or duties under section 10302(a), 10305, \n10306, or 10308(e) of this title or section 1973d or 1973g of Title 42. \n \n52 U.S.C. § 10307(b).  \n192.  Defendants violated Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act by failing to take \nobjectively reasonable precautions to enable Wisconsin citizens to vote free of fear of \ncontracting COVID-19. See Hicks v. Knight, Civ. No. 15,727, 10 Race Rel. L. Rep. 1507-09 \n(E.D. La. 1965) (finding that a city violated federal voting rights law when it failed to take \nreasonable measures to protect voter registration group from physical danger). \n56 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 58 of 70\n \n193.  Defendants did not take objectively reasonable steps to run an absentee-voting \nprogram that guaranteed registered voters who timely requested ballots the ability to reliably and \nsafely cast their ballots from home. They did not provide municipal clerks with the resources \nnecessary to timely process an unprecedented volume of absentee ballot requests. They did not \nprovide a means of complying with the absentee ballot witness requirement that was safe and \nfeasible for voters at high risk from COVID-19. And they did not ensure that drop boxes would \nbe available for absentee voters who wanted to ensure timely receipt of their voted ballots. \n194.  Defendants did not take objectively reasonable precautions to ensure that every \nvoter had access to a safe polling site or in-person absentee voting location that allowed for \nadequate social distancing practices. They took insufficient steps to ensure, for instance, that \nthere were enough poll workers in each county to staff an adequate number of polling sites to \nforestall long lines and crowds, and they did not facilitate the equitable sharing of poll workers \nacross jurisdictions within a county. They did not require that poll workers or voters wear masks. \n195.  As a result, many Wisconsin voters—even those who had timely requested \nabsentee ballots—were forced to choose between risking their physical safety to vote and \nabstaining from voting. \n196.  Defendants’ failure to take objective reasonable precautions to ensure that each \nWisconsin voter could vote free of fear of contracting COVID-19 intimidated and injured \nPlaintiffs. \n197.  Plaintiff Swenson was too intimidated by fear of contracting COVID-19 both to \nvote in person and to get a witness to sign her absentee ballot. As a result, she was \ndisenfranchised. Absent relief, she will be intimidated again in subsequent elections during the \npandemic. \n57 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 59 of 70\n \n198.  Plaintiff McCurtis was intimidated and threatened by the unsafe conditions she \nencountered in voting at Washington High School in Milwaukee. Absent relief, she will \nanticipate similar conditions at polling places during subsequent elections during the pandemic, \nand thus will remain intimidated.  \n199.  Plaintiff Nelson was too intimidated by fear of contracting COVID-19 to vote in \nperson, and she did not receive her timely requested absentee ballot. As a result, she was \ndisenfranchised. Absent relief, she will be intimidated again in subsequent elections during the \npandemic. \n200.  Widespread voter intimidation has forced DRW and BLOC to divert resources \nfrom other activities in order to ensure that voters are not afraid to cast ballots in subsequent \nelections during the pandemic. \n201.  Defendants have not taken sufficient steps to remedy their failure to protect voters \nfrom intimidation during the April election. \n202.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to violate Section 11(b) of \nthe Voting Rights Act. \nCount 2: Violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment  \nto the U.S. Constitution \n(Plaintiff McCurtis, Organizational Plaintiffs) \n \n203.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n204.  The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits Wisconsin from “deny[ing] to any person \nwithin its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, § 1. \n205.  “Having once granted the right to vote on equal terms, [a state] may not, by later \narbitrary and disparate treatment, value one person’s vote over that of another.” Bush v. Gore, \n58 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 60 of 70\n \n531 U.S. 98, 104-105 (2000). Defendants cannot “arbitrarily deny” Wisconsinites “the right to \nvote depending on where they live.” League of Women Voters of Ohio v. Brunner, 548 F.3d 463, \n476 (6th Cir. 2008). \n206.  Defendants’ administration of the April 7 election arbitrarily advantaged voters in \nsome jurisdictions and disadvantaged those who resided in others, including especially voters in \nMilwaukee.  \n207.  Defendants failed to take sufficient action to remedy known poll worker \nshortages. They also failed to facilitate the equitable sharing of poll workers within counties, \nleading to situations in which municipalities in the same county had radically different staffing \nlevels and thus provided radically different experiences for voters. \n208.  Defendants’ arbitrary and disparate administration of the April election injured \nPlaintiff McCurtis by subjecting her, as a resident of the City of Milwaukee, to a voting system \nmore dysfunctional than that experienced by Wisconsinites in many jurisdictions—who voted \nwithout waiting in line for more than two and a half hours. \n209.  Defendants’ arbitrary and disparate administration of the April election has forced \nthe Organizational Plaintiffs to divert resources from other activities in order to ensure that \nvoters in Milwaukee, Green Bay, and other municipalities that experienced severe problems in \nApril are enfranchised in subsequent elections during the pandemic. \n210.  Defendants’ actions, taken under color of law, deprive Plaintiffs of rights, \nprivileges, or immunities secured to them by the Constitution of the United States, in violation of \n42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n211.  Defendants’ actions and failures to act have subjected Plaintiffs to arbitrary \ndisparities in their ability to have their votes counted depending on where they live.  \n59 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 61 of 70\n \n212.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to violate the Equal \nProtection Clause.  \nCount 3: Violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments  \nto the U.S. Constitution \n(All Plaintiffs) \n \n213.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n214.  United States citizens’ voting rights are protected by the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution. See Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983); Burdick \nv. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428 (1992). \n215.  Defendants’ actions unduly burdened Plaintiffs Swenson, McCurtis, and Nelson’s \nconstitutionally protected voting rights by forcing them to choose between exercising their rights \nto vote and their personal safety.  \n216.  As a result, Defendants’ actions imposed a severe—and sometimes impossible—\nburden on Plaintiffs’ right to vote.  \n217.  Defendants’ administration of the April election in a manner that imposed severe \nburdens on voters has forced the Organizational Plaintiffs to divert resources from other \nactivities in order to ensure that voters are nonetheless enfranchised in subsequent elections \nduring the pandemic. \n218.  Defendants have no countervailing legitimate governmental purpose in forcing \nindividuals to choose between the right to vote and their safety. \n219.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to violate the First and \nFourteenth Amendments. \nCount 4: Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment  \nto the U.S. Constitution \n60 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 62 of 70\n \n(Substantive Due Process) \n(All Plaintiffs) \n \n220.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n221.  The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits Wisconsin from “depriv[ing] any person of \nlife, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, § 1. As a result, \nDefendants cannot engage in willful conduct “which undermines the organic processes by which \ncandidates are elected.” Hennings v. Grafton, 523 F.2d 861, 864 (7th Cir. 1975). \n222.  On information and belief, Defendants had actual knowledge that, without \nsignificant action on their part, the April 7 election could not be held in a manner that would not \ndisenfranchise thousands of voters, but they nonetheless failed to take these appropriate and \ntimely steps. The result was an election “so devoid of standards and procedures as to violate \nsubstantive due process.” Brunner, 548 F.3d at 478.  \n223.  Defendants did not take actions sufficient to ensure that voters could cast absentee \nballots and have them counted despite postal service delays that had been acknowledged by \nDefendants. They did not take actions sufficient to ensure that in-person polling places would \nremain safe. As a result, tens of thousands of Wisconsin voters were disenfranchised. \n224.  Defendants’ willful failure to conduct a safe election with adequate standards and \nprocedures injured Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs Swenson and Nelson were fully disenfranchised; Plaintiff \nMcCurtis was forced to risk her health and that of her family members to cast a ballot.  \n225.  Defendants’ administration of the April election without implementing adequate \nstandards or procedures has forced the Organizational Plaintiffs to divert resources from other \nactivities in order to ensure that voters are nonetheless enfranchised in subsequent elections \nduring the pandemic. \n61 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 63 of 70\n \n226.  Defendants are not taking adequate steps to cure their willful failure to hold a \nconstitutionally adequate election. They have not enacted or proposed solutions to ensure that \nvoters can cast absentee ballots and have them counted despite USPS delays. They have not \nenacted or proposed solutions sufficient to ensure that in-person polling places will remain safe. \n227.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to violate the Due Process \nClause in the August and November elections.  \nCount 5: Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment  \nto the U.S. Constitution \n(Procedural Due Process) \n(Plaintiffs Swenson and Nelson, Organizational Plaintiffs) \n \n228.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n229.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment also prohibits the \nDefendants from denying any person of a protected property or liberty interest without fair \nprocess. At the core of these procedural protections is the right to adequate notice with respect to \nany deprivation of a protected interest, and a fair opportunity to be heard on the matter at a \nmeaningful time and in meaningful manner. See Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976). \n230.  All eligible Wisconsin voters have a fundamental right to vote protected by the \nU.S. Constitution and Wisconsin law. Wis. Stat. § 6.02. All eligible Wisconsin voters also have a \nright to request and receive an absentee ballot for any reason, Wis. Stat. § 6.85, et seq., and to \nhave their properly cast absentee ballots counted, Wis. Stat. §§ 6.88, 7.52. Each of these rights is \na protected liberty or property interest that triggers the fundamental procedural protections of the \nDue Process Clause. \n231.  Defendants violated Plaintiffs’ procedural rights under the Due Process Clause \nwith respect to the right to obtain an absentee ballot. Defendants violated this right by failing to \n62 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 64 of 70\n \nprovide: adequate notice of the procedures by which individuals might cure any errors in a \nrequest for an absentee ballot; adequate notice that an absentee ballot would not be delivered to \nthe voter in time to cast the ballot; clear, timely, and effective procedures by which to exercise \nthe right to vote in the event an absentee ballot did not arrive in sufficient time before election \nday; and clear, timely, and effective procedures by which a voter could seek redress in the event \nof an erroneous deprivation of the right to obtain an absentee ballot. Defendants further violated \nthese rights by failing to adopt constitutionally adequate rules, directives, or similar guidance on \nthese matters statewide. \n232.  Defendants also violated Plaintiffs’ procedural rights under the Due Process \nClause with respect to the right to have absentee ballots counted. Defendants violated this right \nby failing to provide timely notice that an absentee ballot had been rejected before election \nresults are certified, including with respect to absentee ballots rejected on the grounds that the \nballot allegedly lacked necessary signatures or other details, or because of alleged problems with \nthe postmark or other evidence that the ballot was timely cast. Wis. Stat. §§ 6.88, 7.52. \nDefendants also failed to provide voters a constitutionally adequate opportunity to be heard on \nthe validity of their ballots before they were excluded from the certified election results. Id. \n233.  Defendants further violated Plaintiffs’ procedural rights under the Due Process \nClause by failing to provide timely, meaningful, and effective notice of changes in voting \nprotocols, procedures, and requirements precipitated by the coronavirus pandemic. Defendants’ \nfailure to communicate effective notice of such changes to the public created widespread \nconfusion in the April 7 election about how eligible voters could or could not exercise their \nfundamental right to vote. This failure resulted in Plaintiffs, like Plaintiffs Swenson and Nelson, \nlosing their fundamental right to vote and other protected interests, including the right to obtain \n63 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 65 of 70\n \nand cast an absentee ballot rather than incur the health risk of going to a polling place on election \nday. Defendants have not cured those failures and have a continuing obligation under the Due \nProcess Clause to provide effective, timely notice to voters with respect to the protocols, \nprocedures, and other requirements they must satisfy in order to exercise their fundamental right \nto vote either in person or absentee. Defendants have also violated these requirements by failing \nto implement rules, directives, or similar guidance with respect to such matters statewide. \n234.  Defendants’ heavy reliance on websites, particularly MyVote Wisconsin, as a \nmeans of providing notice to voters failed to satisfy the requirements of procedural due process \nwith respect to the large number of Wisconsin residents who do not have ready access such \nmeans of communication, including those who lack necessary technical skills, those with \ndisabilities, and those who simply do not have ready access to computers or the internet. This \nfailure disproportionately affects low-income, disabled, elderly, and minority voters, and forces \nthe Organizational Plaintiffs to expend significant additional resources to carry out voter \neducation, voter outreach, and get-out-the-vote activities with respect to the populations that they \neach serve.  \n235.  Defendants are not taking adequate steps to cure these violations of procedural \ndue process in the August and November elections.  \n236.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to violate procedural \nrights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause.  \nCount 6: Violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(Plaintiffs Swenson and Nelson, Organizational Plaintiffs) \n \n237.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n64 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 66 of 70\n \n238.  Under Title II of the ADA, state and local governments must not impose \nrequirements on participation in public services, programs, or activities, including voting, that \nprevent individuals with disabilities from fully and equally enjoying that participation, and must \nmake reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when necessary to avoid \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12132. “Title II of the ADA requires [such \nentities] to ensure that people with disabilities have a full and equal opportunity to vote. The \nADA’s provisions apply to all aspects of voting, including voter registration, site selection, and \nthe casting of ballots, whether on Election Day or during an early voting process.”101 \n239.  Immunocompromised individuals and those who suffer a significant medical \nvulnerability that would place them at high risk of serious bodily injury or death should they \nleave the confines of their home, or should they interact with a non-member of their household, \nhave a disability within the meaning of the ADA. \n240.  Defendants have failed to safeguard these individuals’ right to participate in our \ndemocracy in at least three ways.  \n241.  First, through the conduct described above, Defendants have failed to ensure that \nsuch individuals who request absentee ballots receive them, as necessary to allow them to vote, \nand to count their ballots if they are able to mail them back. Defendants must maintain a voting \nprocess that ensures those with such disabilities can register for, receive, vote, and have counted \ntheir absentee ballots.  \n242.  Second, Defendants have failed to provide reasonable accommodations to voters \nwith disabilities from the photo-ID and in-person witness requirements for absentee voting, Wis. \nStat. § 6.87(2). Many Wisconsin voters with disabilities live alone and cannot safely arrange for \n                                                 \n101 U.S. Dep’t of Justice, “The Americans with Disabilities Act and Other Federal Laws Protecting the Rights of \nVoters with Disabilities,” available at https://www.justice.gov/file/69411/download (last accessed May 14, 2020).  \n65 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 67 of 70\n \nan in-person witness. Many Wisconsin voters with disabilities also do not have access to the \ntechnology necessary to provide copies of their photo-ID with absentee voting materials. \nDefendants have failed to accommodate these voters by, for example, replacing the witness \nverification requirement with a self-certification requirement, and finding alternatives to the \nphoto-ID requirement. In so doing, Defendants have violated the ADA by denying these voters \nthe right to participate in Wisconsin’s voting process by reason of their disability. \n243.  Third, blind individuals and others who require the use of assistive technology \navailable only in person to vote privately and independently also have a disability within the \nmeaning of the ADA. By failing to guarantee safe access to in-person voting for these voters, \nDefendants have violated the ADA. \n244.  Defendants are not taking adequate steps to avoid these violations of the ADA. \n245.  Unless the requested relief is granted, Plaintiffs Swenson and Nelson and those \nsimilarly situated will suffer irreparable harm in that they will be discriminated against and \ndenied equal access to participation in voting in violation of the ADA. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that the Court: \nA.  Declare that administering an election during the COVID-19 pandemic in the manner that \nDefendants administered the April 7, 2020 election violates Section 11(b) of the Voting \nRights Act, the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, and the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act; \nB.  Order Defendants, for the August and November 2020 elections, to:  \n1. Take all appropriate actions to ensure that in-person voting, whether exercised by \ncasting an absentee ballot or by casting a ballot on election day, can be safely conducted; \n66 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 68 of 70\n \n2. Require that accessible voting machines be available at all in-person absentee voting \nlocations; \n3. Take all appropriate actions to ensure an adequate number of poll workers to \nadminister safe polling places; \n4. Ensure that each registered voter in Wisconsin receives an absentee ballot request form \nand that all residents of care facilities have adequate opportunities to register to vote and \nrequest absentee ballots; \n5. Take all appropriate actions to ensure that all voters who request and are qualified to \nreceive an absentee ballot in fact receive such absentee ballot, and that any voter whose \nrequest for an absentee ballot is rejected or not processed for any reason be notified and \ngiven the opportunity to cure any defect in a timely manner; \n6. Take all appropriate actions to upgrade electronic voter registration systems so they \ncan process the anticipated elevated number of online registrations and absentee ballot \nrequests; \n7. Take all appropriate actions to coordinate with, and require municipalities to \ncoordinate with, the United States Postal Service to ensure the timely delivery and return \nof, and counting of, absentee ballots;   \n8. Require municipalities to establish secure drop boxes for in-person return of absentee \nballots and to increase in-person absentee voting opportunities that are safe and \naccessible, including, for instance, drive-through voting; \n9. Provide timely notice to any voter whose absentee ballot is rejected as to the reason for \nrejection, as well as an opportunity to cure or contest the ballot rejection. \n67 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 69 of 70\n \n10. Engage in a public education campaign to apprise the public on: how to request, vote, \nand return absentee ballots; the locations and times for in-person absentee voting; all \nearly voting opportunities in each community; the provisions being made for safe in-\nperson voting; and any changes in election day polling locations. \nC.  Enjoin the enforcement of: \n1. Wis. Stat. § 7.30(2) with respect to the requirement that each election official be an \nelector of the county in which the municipality is located; \n2. Wis. Stat. § 6.87(2) as to immunocompromised voters who cannot safely secure an in-\nperson witness, to be replaced by a verification subject to penalty of perjury; \n3. Wis. Stat § 6.86(1)(ac) with respect to immunocompromised and disabled voters \nwithout means to provide photo identification, to be replaced by a verification subject to \npenalty of perjury or other means of identifying the voter; \n4. Wis. Stat § 6.87(6) and require that absentee ballots postmarked by election day or not \nbearing a postmark but received within a week of election day be counted; \n5. Wis. Stat. §§ 6.88, 7.51 with respect to the requirement that absentee ballots not be \ncounted before election day; and \n6. Wis. Stat. § 7.52 with respect to the requirement that a municipality pass an ordinance \nin order to count absentee ballots at a central location. \nD.  Award Plaintiffs their reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in bringing this action \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b), 28 U.S.C. § 1920, and other applicable laws; and \nE.  Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n \n \n68 \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459   Document #: 1   Filed: 05/18/20   Page 70 of 70\nDated: May 18, 2020 \nBy:    /s/ Leah Godesky\nAnton Metlitsky^  Jamila Benkato* \nLeah Godesky  Farbod Kaycee Faraji* \nYaira Dubin  Cameron Kistler \nO’MELVENY & MYERS LLP  THE PROTECT DEMOCRACY PROJECT \n7 Times Square  2020 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Suite # 163 \nNew York, NY 10036   Washington DC 20006 \n(212)326-2000 (202)579-4582\nametlitsky@omm.com jamila.benkato@protectdemocracy.org\nlgodesky@omm.com farbod.faraji@protectdemocracy.org\nydubin@omm.com cameron.kistler@protectdemocracy.org\n^ Motion for admission forthcoming *Admitted to practice in California, not\nD.C.; practice consistent with D.C.

Defendants’ failure to take appropriate steps to ensure safe access to the ballot, \ncombined with certain Wisconsin statutory requirements that fatally impair Defendants’ ability \nto administer the election effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in historic \nbreakdowns in the election process and the widespread disenfranchisement of Wisconsin voters.  \nMedical and public health experts project that, like the April election, the impending November \nelection will take place during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Defendants have nevertheless failed to \nadopt the policies and measures necessary to prevent similar electoral breakdowns and mass \ndisenfranchisement.  Moreover, the operation of Wisconsin law will again prevent Defendants \nfrom making some of the necessary changes to policies and practices.  Absent intervention by \nthis Court, Plaintiffs are likely to once again face severe, often insurmountable, burdens on their \nright to vote in violation of their rights under Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act, the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, and the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States \nConstitution. \nFor the foregoing reasons, and as more fully set forth in Plaintiffs’ accompanying Brief in \nSupport of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, statement of proposed facts, and \ndeclarations and exhibits, this Court should enjoin, for the November 2020 election, the \nenforcement of: \n1.

Stat. §§ 6.88, 7.51-.52 with respect to the requirement that absentee ballots not be \ncounted before election day. \nThis Court should further order Defendants, for the November 2020 election, to: \n1.  Take all appropriate actions to ensure that in-person voting, whether exercised by casting \nan absentee ballot or by casting a ballot on election day, can be safely conducted; \n2.  Require that accessible voting machines be available at all in-person absentee voting \nlocations;  \n3.  Take all appropriate actions to ensure an adequate number of poll workers to administer \nsafe polling places;  \n4.  Ensure that each registered voter in Wisconsin receives an absentee ballot request form \nand that all residents of care facilities have adequate opportunities to register to vote and \nrequest absentee ballots;  \n5.

GLANCEY, \nANN S. JACOBS, DEAN KNUDSON, ROBERT \nF. SPINDELL, JR., MARK L. THOMSEN, and \nMEAGAN WOLFE, \n \n        Defendants, \n  and \n \nWISCONSIN LEGISLATURE, REPUBLICAN \nNATIONAL COMMITTEE, and REPUBLICAN \nPARTY OF WISCONSIN, \n \n        Intervening Defendants. \n \nPlaintiffs bring this suit seeking a declaration that the administration of Wisconsin’s \nApril 7, 2020, election, held in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, violated federal law. \nThey also request various injunctions in anticipation of the August and November 2020 \nelections.  Plaintiffs are three Wisconsin citizens and two nonprofit organizations and name as \ndefendants the six Commissioners of the Wisconsin Elections Commission (“WEC”), as well \nas the Administrator of the WEC.  In addition, the Wisconsin Legislature and the Republican \nNational Committee and Republican Party of Wisconsin (“the RNC/RPW”) now seek to \nintervene as defendants (dkts. #18, 25), which the court will grant for the reasons that follow, \nas well as establish a status conference to address scheduling in this and related lawsuits. \nBACKGROUND \nThe  COVID-19  pandemic  has  posed  novel  and  challenging  problems  for  the \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 38   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 2 of 6\nadministration of Wisconsin elections, which in turn has generated numerous lawsuits.  In \naddition to the present suit, pending before this court are three other lawsuits bringing related \nchallenges to Wisconsin’s election laws.  See Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann, 20-cv-249; \nGear v. Knudson, 20-cv-278; Edwards v. Vos, 20-cv-340.  In each of these cases, the Wisconsin \nLegislature and the RNC/RPW are parties.  Unsurprisingly, they both have now moved to \nintervene as defendants in the present lawsuit.  (Dkts. #18, 25.)  The existing defendants \nconsent  to  both  interventions;  plaintiffs  do  not  object  to  the  Wisconsin  Legislature’s \nintervention, but they oppose the RNC/RPW’s motion. \nOPINION \nThe  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  contemplate  two  methods  of  intervention: \nintervention as of right, and permissive intervention.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a), (b).  The \nWisconsin Legislature argues that it is entitled to intervene as of right or, in the alternative, to \nintervene permissively.  (Wis. Leg. Br. (dkt. #26) 2-3.)  A court must permit a party to intervene \nwhere:  “(1) the application is timely; (2) the applicant has an ‘interest’ in the property or \ntransaction which is the subject of the action; (3) disposition of the action as a practical matter \nmay impede or impair the applicant’s ability to protect that interest; and (4) no existing party \nadequately represents the applicant’s interest.”  Sec. Ins. Co. of Hartford v. Schipporeit, Inc., 69 \nF.3d 1377, 1380 (7th Cir. 1995) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2)). \nHere, the Legislature’s unopposed motion establishes an adequate prima facie basis for \nthis court to grant intervention under Rule 24(a)(2).  See Wausau Homes, Inc. v. Menning, No. \n17-CV-129-BBC,  2017  WL  2170256,  at  *1  (W.D.  Wis.  May  17,  2017)  (granting  an \nunopposed intervention motion where the proposed intervenor “made a prima facie showing \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 38   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 3 of 6\nto satisfy the standard for mandatory intervention under Rule 24(a)(2)”).  First, the motion is \ntimely as it was filed only weeks after the lawsuit commenced and before the deadline for the \ncurrent defendants to respond to the complaint.  As to the second and third factors, the \nLegislature has an interest in the continued enforceability of its laws, and because plaintiffs \nseek to enjoin certain state election laws, any disposition in their favor would impair the \nLegislature’s interest.  See Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, Inc. v. Kaul, 942 F.3d 793, 798 (7th \nCir. 2019) (assuming that the Wisconsin Legislature, as a proposed intervenor, had an interest \ndefending the enforceability of a state law for purposes of Rule 24(a), although withholding on \nwhether that interest was “unique” from that of Wisconsin Attorney General’s as the existing \ndefendant).  Finally, the Legislature has offered various reasons for why the existing defendants \ndo not adequately represent their interests, including the current defendants’ explanation in \nbriefing in a related case that they will lack the authority to appeal any order enjoining \nenforcement of the challenged election laws by this court.  (See Wis. Leg. Br. (dkt. #26) 8-9 \n(citing WEC Mot. to Dismiss Br. (20-cv-340, dkt. #15) 6).)  At least on this unopposed \nmotion, this is sufficient to show that the current defendants do not adequately represent the \nWisconsin Legislature’s interests in this suit.  Because the court is permitting the Legislature \nto intervene under Rule 24(a), the court need not address its arguments regarding permissive \nintervention. \nAs for the RNC/RPW’s motion, they primarily argue intervention should be allowed \npermissively, while only arguing in the alternative for intervention as of right.  Permissive \nintervention is granted at the discretion of the court and requires only (1) a timely motion and \n(2) that the applicant “has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common \nquestion of law or fact.”  Sec. Ins. Co. of Hartford, 69 F.3d at 1381 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 38   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 4 of 6\n24(b)(2)).  In exercising its discretion, “[t]he Rule requires the court to consider ‘whether the \nintervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties’ rights,’ Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 24(b)(3), but otherwise does not cabin the district court’s discretion.”  Planned \nParenthood, 942 F.3d at 803. \nNotwithstanding plaintiffs’ opposition, the RNC/RPW readily meets the two required \nelements of permissive intervention.  First, their application is timely as they moved to \nintervene only three weeks after the lawsuit was filed and before the deadline for the current \ndefendants to even respond to the complaint.  Second, the RNC/RPW have a defense that \nshares common questions of law and fact with the main action; namely, they seek to defend \nthe challenged election laws to protect their and their members’ stated interests -- among other \nthings, interest in the integrity of Wisconsin’s elections.  (See RNC/RPW Br. (dkt. #19) 5-8.) \nIn opposing the motion, plaintiffs do not contend that the RNC/RPW fail to meet the \ntwo requirements for permissive intervention, but instead argue generally that:  (1) the \nRNC/RPW are adequately represented by the existing defendants; (2) their intervention would \nunnecessarily complicate and delay the case; and (3) no persuasive reason exists to permit them \nto intervene in this case.  (Pls.’ Opp’n (dkt. #34) 7-11.)  Plaintiffs urge that the court should \nat most permit the RNC/RPW to be involved as amici, and not parties.  (Id. at 11.)  While \nplaintiffs’ concerns might be well founded in an ordinary case, there is nothing ordinary here, \nbeginning with the fact that this case is one of four closely overlapping lawsuits, in all of which \nRNC/RPW is already a party.  On balance, the court concludes that permitting the RNC/RPW \nto intervene here as well will not unduly delay or prejudice the interests of the original parties \nand will serve the interests of judicial administration and efficiency.  The RNC/RPW is not \nasserting any new or additional claims, but is only intervening to defend the challenged laws.  \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 38   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 5 of 6\nAlthough the RNC/RPW may advance novel arguments against plaintiffs’ requested relief, \nplaintiffs “can hardly be said to be prejudiced by having to prove a lawsuit it chose to initiate.”  \nSec. Ins. Co. of Hartford, 69 F.3d at 1381.  Finally, the RNC/RPW has committed to following \nthe same briefing schedule as defendants.  (See RNC/RPW Br. (dkt. #19) 3.) \nRegardless, as all four of these cases progress, this court anticipates holding joint \nhearings -- indeed, a joint status conference is already scheduled -- and eventual consolidation \nof the cases is likely given the overlapping claims and arguments.  If anything,  denying \nintervention would at this point unnecessarily complicate an already complicated set of cases \nby requiring the RNC/RPW to act as amici in this case and as defendants in the other, three \nrelated cases.  The Seventh Circuit has observed that “Rule 24(b) is just about economy in \nlitigation.”  City of Chic. v. Fed. Emergency Mgmt. Agency, 660 F.3d 980, 987 (7th Cir. 2011).  \nHere, where intervention would serve the interests of judicial administration and where the \nproposed intervenor has otherwise met the requirements of Rule 24(b), permissive intervention \nis appropriate. \nORDER \nIT IS ORDERED that: \n1)  The Wisconsin Legislature’s unopposed motion to intervene (dkt. #25) is \nGRANTED. \n2)  The Republic National Committee and Republican Party of Wisconsin’s motion to \nintervene (dkt. #18) is GRANTED. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 38   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 6 of 6\n3)  The court will hold a joint status conference with the parties in the present case, as \nwell with the parties in case nos. 20-cv-249, ‘278, and ‘459, on Monday, June 29, \n2020, at 10:00 a.m.  The conference will be held via Zoom, and the court will \nrequire counsel for each of the cases to provide an email address for no more than \ntwo attorneys who will appear and speak for their respective parties.  Other \nattorneys or parties may watch the conference via the court’s live YouTube stream.  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIvvwLooNn3UX_g9qHQP4bQ/live.  The \nparties should be prepared to discuss a schedule for efficiently and fairly \naddressing plaintiffs’ requests for a relief.  In addition, to the extent possible, \ncounsel for parties with aligned interests are strongly encouraged to discuss their \npositions in advance and designate a lead spokesperson by issue or otherwise.  \nFinally, counsel are encouraged to meet before the June 29 conference (virtually or \notherwise) and confer to discuss the best means to efficiently resolve any disputes \nwell in advance of upcoming elections. \nEntered this 23rd day of June, 2020. \nBY THE COURT: \n \n            /s/ \n            __________________________________ \n            WILLIAM M.

Conley, Judge. \n____________________ \nSUBMITTED OCTOBER 6, 2020 — DECIDED OCTOBER 8, 2020 \n____________________ \nBefore EASTERBROOK, ROVNER, and ST. EVE, Circuit Judges. \nPER CURIAM. On September 29, 2020, we issued an order \ndenying the motions for a stay in these appeals, because we \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\n2  Nos. 20-2835 & 20-2844 \nconcluded that Wisconsin’s legislative branch has not been \nauthorized to represent the state’s interest in defending its \nstatutes. On October 2, in response to a request for reconsid-\neration, we certiﬁed to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin the \nquestion “whether, under Wis. Stat. §803.09(2m), the State \nLegislature has the authority to represent the State of Wis-\nconsin’s interest in the validity of state laws.” That court ac-\ncepted the certiﬁcation and replied that the State Legislature \nindeed has that authority. Democratic National Committee v. \nBostelmann, 2020 WI 80 (Oct. 6, 2020). In light of that conclu-\nsion, we grant the petition for reconsideration and now ad-\ndress the Legislature’s motion on the merits. (The other in-\ntervenors have not sought reconsideration.) \nAs  we  explained  last  week,  a  district  judge  held  that \nmany provisions in the state’s elections code may be used \nduring the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic but that some deadlines \nmust be extended, additional online options must be added, \nand two smaller changes made. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 172330 \n(W.D. Wis. Sept. 21, 2020). In particular, the court extended \nthe deadline for online and mail-in registration from October \n14 (see Wis. Stat. §6.28(1)) to October 21, 2020; enjoined for \none week (October 22 to October 29) enforcement of the re-\nquirement that the clerk mail all ballots, but only for those \nvoters who timely requested an absentee ballot but did not \nreceive one, and authorized online delivery during this time; \nand extended the deadline for the receipt of mailed ballots \nfrom November 3 (Election Day) to November 9, provided \nthat the ballots are postmarked on or before November 3. \nTwo other provisions of the injunction (2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n172330 at *98) need not be described. \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\nNos. 20-2835 & 20-2844  3 \nThe State Legislature oﬀers two principal arguments in \nsupport of a stay: ﬁrst, that a federal court should not change \nthe rules so close to an election; second, that political rather \nthan judicial oﬃcials are entitled to decide when a pandemic \njustiﬁes changes to rules that are otherwise valid. See Luft v. \nEvers, 963 F.3d 665 (7th Cir. 2020) (sustaining Wisconsin’s \nrules  after  reviewing  the  elections  code  as  a  whole).  We \nagree with both of those arguments, which means that a stay \nis appropriate under the factors discussed in Nken v. Holder, \n556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009). \nFor many years the Supreme Court has insisted that fed-\neral courts not change electoral rules close to an election \ndate. One recent instance came in an earlier phase of this \ncase. After the district judge directed Wisconsin to change \nsome of its rules close to the April 2020 election, the Supreme \nCourt granted a stay (to the extent one had been requested) \nand observed that the change had come too late. Republican \nNational Committee v. Democratic National Committee, 140 S. Ct. \n1205, 1207 (2020). One of the decisions cited in that opinion \nis  another  from  Wisconsin:  Frank  v.  Walker,  574  U.S.  929 \n(2014). In Frank this court had permitted Wisconsin to put its \nphoto-ID law into eﬀect, staying a district court’s injunction. \nBut the Supreme Court deemed that change (two months \nbefore  the  election)  too  late,  even  though  it  came  at  the \nstate’s behest. (Frank did not give reasons, but Republican Na-\ntional  Committee  treated  Frank  as  an  example  of  a  change \nmade too late.) Here the district court entered its injunction \non September 21, only six weeks before the election and less \nthan four weeks before October 14, the ﬁrst of the deadlines \nthat the district court altered. If the orders of last April, and \nin Frank, were too late, so is the district court’s September \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\n4  Nos. 20-2835 & 20-2844 \norder in this case. See also Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1 \n(2006). \nThe  Justices  have  deprecated  but  not  forbidden  all \nchange close to an election. A last-minute event may require \na  last-minute  reaction.  But  it  is  not  possible  to  describe \nCOVID-19 as a last-minute event. The World Health Organi-\nzation declared a pandemic seven months ago, the State of \nWisconsin closed many businesses and required social dis-\ntancing last March, and the state has conducted two elec-\ntions (April and August) during the pandemic. If the judge \nhad issued an order in May based on April’s experience, it \ncould not be called untimely. By waiting until September, \nhowever, the district court acted too close to the election. \nThe district judge also assumed that the design of ad-\njustments during a pandemic is a judicial task. This is doubt-\nful, as Justice Kavanaugh observed in connection with the \nSupreme  Court’s  recent  stay  of  another  injunction  issued \nclose  to  the  upcoming  election.  Andino  v.  Middleton,  No. \n20A55 (U.S. Oct. 5, 2020) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). The \nSupreme Court has held that the design of electoral proce-\ndures is a legislative task. See, e.g., Rucho v. Common Cause, \n139 S. Ct. 2484 (2019); Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428 (1992). \nVoters have had many months since March to register or \nobtain absentee ballots; reading the Constitution to extend \ndeadlines near the election is diﬃcult to justify when the \nvoters have had a long time to cast ballots while preserving \nsocial distancing. The pandemic has had consequences (and \nappropriate governmental responses) that change with time, \nbut  the  fundamental  proposition  that  social  distancing  is \nnecessary has not changed since March. The district court \ndid not ﬁnd that any person who wants to avoid voting in \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\nNos. 20-2835 & 20-2844  5 \nperson on Election Day would be unable to cast a ballot in \nWisconsin by planning ahead and taking advantage of the \nopportunities allowed by state law. The problem that con-\ncerned the district judge, rather, was the diﬃculty that could \nbe encountered by voters who do not plan ahead and wait \nuntil the last day that state law allows for certain steps. Yet, \nas the Supreme Court observed last April in this very case, \nvoters who wait until the last minute face problems with or \nwithout a pandemic. \nThe Court has consistently stayed orders by which feder-\nal judges have used COVID-19 as a reason to displace the \ndecisions of the policymaking branches of government. It \nhas stayed judicial orders about elections, prison manage-\nment, and the closure of businesses. We have already men-\ntioned Andino and Republican National Committee. See also \nClarno v. People Not Politicians Oregon, No. 20A21 (U.S. Aug. \n11, 2020) (staying an injunction that had altered a state’s sig-\nnature and deadline requirements for placing initiatives on \nthe ballot during the pandemic); Merrill v. People First of Ala-\nbama, No. 19A1063 (U.S. July 2, 2020) (staying an injunction \nthat had suspended some state anti-fraud rules for absentee \nvoting during the pandemic); Barnes v. Ahlman, 140 S. Ct. \n2620 (2020) (staying an order that overrode a prison war-\nden’s decision about how to cope with the pandemic); Little \nv. Reclaim Idaho, 140 S. Ct. 2616 (2020) (staying an injunction \nthat changed the rules for ballot initiatives during the pan-\ndemic); South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 140 S. \nCt.  1613  (2020)  (declining  to  suspend  state  rules  limiting \npublic gatherings during the pandemic). \nDeciding how best to cope with diﬃculties caused by \ndisease is principally a task for the elected branches of gov-\n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\n6  Nos. 20-2835 & 20-2844 \nernment. This is one implication of Jacobson v. Massachusetts, \n197 U.S. 11 (1905), and has been central to our own decisions \nthat have addressed requests for the Judicial Branch to su-\npersede political oﬃcials’ choices about how to deal with the \npandemic. See, e.g., Tully v. Okeson, No. 20-2605 (7th Cir. Oct. \n6, 2020) (rejecting a contention that the Constitution entitles \neveryone to vote by mail during a pandemic); Illinois Repub-\nlican Party v. Pritzker, No. 20-2175 (7th Cir. Sept. 3, 2020) (re-\njecting a constitutional challenge to limits on the size of po-\nlitical gatherings during the pandemic); Peterson v. Barr, 965 \nF.3d 549 (7th Cir. 2020) (reversing an injunction that had al-\ntered procedures for executions during the pandemic); Mor-\ngan v. White, 964 F.3d 649 (7th Cir. 2020) (social distancing \nduring  a  pandemic  does  not  require,  as  a  constitutional \nmatter, a change in the rules for qualifying referenda for the \nballot); Elim Romanian Pentecostal Church v. Pritzker, 962 F.3d \n341  (7th  Cir.  2020)  (rejecting  a  constitutional  challenge  to \nlimits on the size of religious gatherings during the pandem-\nic). Cf. Mays v. Dart, No. 20-1792 (7th Cir. Sept. 8, 2020) (re-\nversing, for legal errors, an injunction that speciﬁed how \nprisons must be managed during the pandemic). \nThe injunction issued by the district court is stayed pend-\ning ﬁnal disposition of these appeals. \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\nNos. 20-2835 & 20-2844  7 \nROVNER, Circuit Judge, dissenting. In the United States of \nAmerica, a beacon of liberty founded on the right of the peo-\nple to rule themselves, no citizen should have to choose be-\ntween her health and her right to vote. An election system de-\nsigned for in-person voting, coupled with an uncontrolled \npandemic that is unprecedented in our lifetimes, confronts \nWisconsin voters with that very choice. In the April 2020 elec-\ntion,  Wisconsin  voters  sought  overwhelmingly  to  protect \nthemselves by voting absentee. Yet at least 100,000 of them, \ndespite timely requests, did not receive their ballots in time to \nreturn them by election day, as the Wisconsin election code \nrequires. Only as a result of judicial intervention in the April \n2020 election were some 80,000 absentee ballots, their return \ndelayed by an overwhelmed election apparatus and Postal \nService, rescued from the trash bin. Thousands of additional \nvoters who never received their ballots were forced to stand \nin line for hours on election day waiting to vote in person, \nrisking their well-being by doing so. \nFor purposes of the upcoming November election, the dis-\ntrict court ordered a limited, reasonable set of modifications \nto Wisconsin’s election rules designed to address the very \nproblems that manifested in the April election and to preserve \nthe precious right of each Wisconsin citizen to vote. Its two \nmost important provisions are comparable to those this very \ncourt sustained six months ago. The Wisconsin Election Com-\nmission, whose members are appointed by the Legislature \nand the Governor and are charged with administering the \nState’s elections, has acceded to that injunction. It is not here \ncomplaining of any undue burden imposed by the district \ncourt’s decision or any risk of voter confusion. Only the Wis-\nconsin Legislature, which has chosen to make no accommo-\ndations in the election rules to account for the burdens created \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\n8  Nos. 20-2835 & 20-2844 \nby the pandemic, seeks a stay of the injunction in furtherance \nof its own power.  \nToday, by granting that stay, the court adopts a hands-off \napproach to election governance that elevates legislative pre-\nrogative over a citizen’s fundamental right to vote. It does so \non two grounds: (1) the Supreme Court’s Purcell doctrine, as \nexemplified by the Court’s recent shadow-docket rulings, in \nthe majority’s view all but forbids alterations to election rules \nin the run-up to an election; and (2) in times of pandemic, re-\nvisions to election rules are the province of elected state offi-\ncials rather than the judiciary. With respect, I am not con-\nvinced  that  either  rationale  justifies  a  stay  of  the  district \ncourt’s careful, thorough, and well-grounded injunction. At a \ntime when judicial intervention is most needed to protect the \nfundamental  right  of  Wisconsin  citizens  to  choose  their \nelected representatives, the court declares itself powerless to \ndo anything. This is inconsistent both with the stated rationale \nof Purcell and with the Anderson-Burdick framework, which \nrecognizes that courts can and must intervene to address un-\nacceptable burdens on the fundamental right to vote. The in-\nevitable result of the court’s decision today will be that many \nthousands of Wisconsin citizens will lose their right to vote \ndespite doing everything they reasonably can to exercise it. \nThis is a travesty. \nOn the facts of the case, I see no deviation from Purcell. In \nall of two sentences, Purcell articulated not a rule but a cau-\ntion: take care with last-minute changes to a state’s election \nrules, lest voters become confused and discouraged from vot-\ning. Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 4–5, 127 S. Ct. 5, 7 (2006) \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\nNos. 20-2835 & 20-2844  9 \n(per curiam).1 In a series of stay rulings on its shadow docket \nsince that decision, the Supreme Court has evinced a pro-\nnounced skepticism of judicial intervention in the weeks prior \nto an election, e.g. Andino v. Middleton, — S. Ct. —, 2020 WL \n5887393 (U.S. Oct. 5, 2020), but has put little meat on the bones \nof what has become known as the Purcell doctrine. See Nicho-\nlas Stephanopoulos, Freeing Purcell from the Shadows, Election \nLaw  Blog  (Sept.  27,  2020)  (hereinafter,  “Freeing  Purcell”) \n(“[d]espite all of this activity, the Purcell principle remains re-\nmarkably opaque”)2. Perhaps we can say at this point that \nPurcell and its progeny establish a presumption against judi-\ncial intervention close in time to an election. See id. (“This is \nthe reading most consistent with Purcell’s actual language.”). \nBut how near? As to what types of changes? Overcome by \nwhat  showing?  These  and  other  questions  remain  unan-\nswered. \nThe Supreme Court’s stay decision in this case regarding \nthe April 2020 election did little to clear things up. This court \nhad denied a stay as to two changes the district court ordered \nfor purposes of that spring election: extending the deadline \nfor requesting an absentee ballot, and extending the deadline \nfor receipt of completed absentee ballots. Dem. Nat’l Com. v. \nBostelmann, 2020 WL 3619499, at *1 (7th Cir. April 3, 2020). The \nWisconsin Legislature appealed only the ballot-receipt dead-\nline. Although the Court had critical things to say about the \n \n1 “Court orders affecting elections, especially conflicting orders, can them-\nselves result in voter confusion and consequent incentive to remain away \nfrom the polls. As an election draws closer, that risk will increase.” Purcell, \n549 U.S. at 4–5, 127 S. Ct. at 7. \n2 Available at https://electionlawblog.org/?p=115834. \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\n10  Nos. 20-2835 & 20-2844 \nlast-minute change in rules ordered by the district court’s in-\njunction (in part because the district court had ordered relief \nbeyond what the plaintiffs themselves had requested), it then \nproceeded to impose one of its own, ordering that absentee \nballots must either be delivered or postmarked on or before \nelection day in order to be counted. Repub. Nat’l Com. v. Dem. \nNat’l Com., 140 S. Ct. 1205, 1207, 1208 (2020). The Court was \nalso at pains to emphasize that it was reserving judgment as \nto “whether other reforms or modifications in election proce-\ndures in light of COVID-19 are appropriate.” Id. at 1208. Apart \nfrom that, the Supreme Court’s pattern of staying similar sorts \nof injunctions in recent months is long on signaling but short \non concrete principles that lower courts can apply to the spe-\ncific facts before them. \nUntil the Supreme Court gives us more guidance than Pur-\ncell and an occasional sentence or two in its stay rulings have \nprovided, all that lower courts can do—and, I submit, must \ndo—is  carefully  evaluate  emergent  circumstances  that \nthreaten to interfere with the right to vote and conscientiously \nevaluate all of the factors that bear on the propriety of judicial \nintervention to address those circumstances, including in par-\nticular the possibility of voter confusion.  \nA  variety  of  factors  should  inform  a  court’s  decision \nwhether or not to modify election rules. See Freeing Purcell. On \nbalance, these factors support rather than undermine the dis-\ntrict court’s decision here.  \nThe first consideration is whether the proposed modifica-\ntions might confuse voters. That risk is minimal here. Only \ntwo of the five modifications that Judge Conley ordered alter \nwhat is expected of voters: the extension of the deadline to \nregister online or by mail, and the extension of the deadline \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\nNos. 20-2835 & 20-2844  11 \nfor receipt of absentee ballots. Both of these modifications re-\ndound to the benefit of voters, and certainly do not lay a trap \nfor the unwary. We upheld (i.e., denied a stay as to) compa-\nrable changes for the April election, and the Supreme Court \nmodified the latter only to the extent of requiring that an \nabsentee ballot be delivered or postmarked on or before \nelection day.3 Neither we nor our superiors would have done \nso had there been a substantial risk of confusing voters. The \nother three changes are directed to election officials and what \nthey must do. By their nature, these changes will not impact \nvoter decisions. \nA second consideration is whether the changes to election \nrules will burden election officials and increase the odds that \nthey make mistakes. Judge Conley gave careful attention to \nwhether state election officials would have the time and abil-\nity to implement the changes he ordered. The Wisconsin Elec-\ntion Commission signaled a preparedness and ability to com-\nply with these modifications (more on these points below), \nand the State Executive is not here to contend otherwise.  \nWe must consider, third, the likelihood that voter disen-\nfranchisement will ensue from the changes Judge Conley or-\ndered. The answer here is straightforward: it will not. On the \ncontrary, his directives are aimed at preventing disenfran-\nchisement. And as detailed below, the results of the April \n \n3 In its April decision, this court denied a stay as to an extension of the \ndeadline to request an absentee ballot and the deadline for receipt of a \ncompleted absentee ballot. Bostelmann, 2020 WL 3619499, at *1. The district \ncourt had also ordered an extension of the deadline to register online for \nthe April election, see Dem. Nat’l Com. v. Bostelmann, 447 F. Supp. 3d 757, \n765–67 (W.D. Wis. Mar. 20, 2020), but a stay was not sought as to that ex-\ntension. \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\n12  Nos. 20-2835 & 20-2844 \nelection in Wisconsin demonstrate that only in the absence of \njudicial intervention will voters be disenfranchised. \nFourth, there has been no lack of diligence on the part of \nthe plaintiffs in seeking relief. They sought relief in advance \nof the April election, as the pandemic was heating up, suc-\nceeded in part as to that election, and promptly renewed their \npursuit of relief in the immediate aftermath of that election. \nAfter they defeated the Legislature’s attempt to dismiss their \nclaims, see Dem. Nat’l Com. v. Bostelmann, 2020 WL 3077047 \n(W.D. Wis. June 10, 2020), they proceeded with discovery, \npresented their case at an evidentiary hearing in August, and \nobtained a favorable ruling in September. There has been no \ndallying on the plaintiffs’ part. For its part, the district judge \nresponded with both alacrity and attention to detail. But ac-\ncording to this court, which has retroactively announced a \nMay deadline for any changes to election rules, it was all for \nnaught—their work was over before it began. \nFifth and finally, although the election is drawing close, \nthe district judge issued his injunction six weeks prior to the \nelection, leaving ample time for Wisconsin election officials to \nalter  election  practices  as  ordered  and  communicate  the \nchanges to the public, and for his judgment to be reviewed by \nthis court and, if necessary, by the Supreme Court.4 This is a \n \n4 As the Gear plaintiffs point out, other circuit courts have upheld injunc-\ntions modifying state election procedures in the immediate run-up to elec-\ntions when the courts deemed the modifications necessary to prevent \nvoter disenfranchisement. E.g., League of Women Voters of the U.S. v. Newby, \n838 F.3d 1, 12–15 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (2-1 decision) (six weeks before election); \nObama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 436–37 (6th Cir. 2012) (one month \nbefore election); U.S. Student Ass’n Fdn. v. Land, 546 F.3d 373, 387–89 (6th \nCir. 2008) (2-1 decision) (six days before election).  \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\nNos. 20-2835 & 20-2844  13 \nfar cry from April, when the court’s injunction was issued just \neighteen days prior to the election and was modified to grant \nadditional relief just five days prior to the election. The Covid-\n19 pandemic is no longer new but neither is it a static phe-\nnomenon; infection rates have ebbed and surged in multiple \nwaves around the country and it is only now that Wisconsin \nis facing crisis-level conditions. I suppose that the district \ncourt  could  have  issued  a  preliminary  injunction  in  May \nbased on the experience with the April election, as my col-\nleagues suggest, but the defendants no doubt would have ar-\ngued that it was premature to deem modifications to the elec-\ntion code warranted so far in advance of the election,5 and \nthere is a fair chance that this court might have agreed with \nthem. Wisconsin infection rates in early May were less than \none quarter of what they are now. Nothing in Purcell or its \nprogeny forecloses modifications of the kind the district court \nordered in the worsening circumstances that confront Wis-\nconsin as the election draws nigh. Otherwise, courts would \nnever be able to order relief addressing late-developing cir-\ncumstances that threaten interference with the right to vote.6 \n \n5 In fact, the defendants did argue precisely that in moving to dismiss the \nDNC’s complaint shortly after the April election took place. See Dem. Nat’l \nCom. v. Bostelmann, 2020 WL 3077047 (W.D. Wis. June 9, 2020). \n6 Professor Stephanopoulos cites the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act’s \nspecial restrictions on campaign ads imposed within 60 days of an elec-\ntion, and the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act’s require-\nment that absentee ballots be sent to certain voters at least 45 days prior to \nan election, as possible guideposts for determining when the eleventh \nhour has arrived for judicial intervention into an election. Freeing Purcell. \nObviously, we are past both reference points here. But Stephanopoulos \nhimself argues that this sort of deadline (which, of course, the Supreme \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\n14  Nos. 20-2835 & 20-2844 \nThe court’s second rationale for granting a stay—that “the \ndesign of adjustments during a pandemic” is a task for elected \nofficials  rather  than  the  judiciary—announces  an  ad  hoc \ncarve-out from the Anderson-Burdick framework for the re-\nview of state election rules. See Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. \n780, 103 S. Ct. 1564 (1983); Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 112 \nS. Ct. 2059 (1992). That framework does call for deference to \nstate officials, depending upon the degree of restriction that \nstate election rules impose on the right to vote: severe re-\nstrictions demand strict judicial scrutiny, whereas modest, \nunexceptional restrictions enjoy a presumption of validity. Id. \nat 434, 112 S. Ct. at 2063–64. But what the majority proposes \nis total deference to state officials in the context of pandemic, \nwith no degree of judicial scrutiny at all. That I cannot en-\ndorse. Communicable diseases can impose real and substan-\ntial obstacles to voting, and voting rules that are unobjection-\nable in normal conditions may become unreasonable during \na pandemic, when leaving one’s home and joining other vot-\ners at the polls carries with it a genuine risk of becoming seri-\nously ill.  \nNotably,  the  Wisconsin  Election  Commission,  whose \nmembers are appointed by two sets of elected officials—the \nLegislature and the Governor—was represented in the litiga-\ntion below. As I noted at the outset, the Commission has ac-\nceded to the district court’s injunction and has not sought a \nstay. As long as we are discussing deference to state officials, \nthe views of the Commission, which is charged with enforc-\ning Wisconsin’s election rules, ought to count for something. \n \nCourt has yet to adopt) should not be conclusive in assessing the propriety \nof judicial intervention. \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\nNos. 20-2835 & 20-2844  15 \nJustice Kavanaugh’s concurrence in Andino posits that a \nstate legislature’s decision whether or not to alter voting rules \nin response to the Covid-19 pandemic ordinarily should not \nbe second-guessed by the judiciary, which lacks the legisla-\nture’s presumed expertise in matters of public health and is \nnot accountable to the people. 2020 WL 5887393, at *1. But \nstate legislatures do not possess a monopoly on matters of \npublic health, see, e.g., Elim Romanian Pentecostal Church v. \nPritzker, 962 F.3d 341 (7th Cir. 2020) (reviewing Governor’s \nexecutive order restricting size of public assemblies in light of \npublic health emergency), and when state government is di-\nvided as it is in Wisconsin, stalemates occur. When a state \nproves unwilling or unable to confront and adapt to external \nforces that pose a real impediment to voting, it places into \njeopardy the most cherished right that its citizens enjoy. (The \ndebacle that occurred with respect to in-person voting in Wis-\nconsin on April 7, as I discuss below, makes that point all too \nclear.) The right to vote is a right of national citizenship. Dunn \nv. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 336, 92 S. Ct. 995, 999–1000 (1972). \nIt is essential to the vitality of our democratic republic. E.g., \nWesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 17, 84 S. Ct. 526, 535 (1964) \n(“No right is more precious in a free country than that of hav-\ning a voice in the election of those who make the laws under \nwhich, as good citizens, we must live.”).7 And no citizen of \nWisconsin should be forced to risk his or her life or well-being \nin order to exercise this invaluable right. Wholesale deference \n \n7 Indeed, the irony of Justice Kavanaugh’s rationale is that unchecked def-\nerence to the state legislature as to voting procedures during a pandemic \nmay render legislators unaccountable to voters wishing to exercise their \nfranchise. \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\n16  Nos. 20-2835 & 20-2844 \nto a state legislature in this context essentially strips the right \nto vote of its constitutional protection. \nI submit that our foremost duty in this case is to protect \nthe voting rights of Wisconsin citizens, which are seriously \nendangered, rather than discretionary action (or inaction) by \none branch of state government, in the face of a pandemic. My \nevaluation of the district court’s injunction proceeds on that \nunderstanding. \nA central premise of the Legislature’s request for a stay of \nthe changes that Judge Conley ordered to Wisconsin’s elec-\ntion rules is that the ability to register and/or vote in person \nremains a perfectly acceptable alternative to any Wisconsin \nvoter who is unable to register in advance of the election and \nto return an absentee ballot prior to election day. Were these \nordinary times, I would have no difficulty agreeing with the \nLegislature. But what the Legislature downplays—indeed, \nbarely acknowledges in its briefs—is the concrete risk that a \n100-year pandemic, which at present is surging in Wisconsin, \nposes to anyone who must brave long lines, possibly for \nhours, in order to register and vote in person. \nHistorically, the vast majority of Wisconsin voters have \ncast their ballots in person, and Wisconsin’s election system \nhas evolved against that backdrop, with provisions for absen-\ntee voting having served as a courtesy for the minority of vot-\ners whose work, travel, or other individual circumstances \npresented an obstacle to voting in person on election day. \nD. Ct. Op. 15, 39. Absentee ballots have often constituted less \nthan 10 percent of ballots cast in Wisconsin, and, until this \nyear, never more than 20 percent. D. Ct. Op. 15. Voters have \nalso relied heavily on the State’s liberal provision for same-\nday voting registration, with some 80 percent of all Wisconsin \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\nNos. 20-2835 & 20-2844  17 \nvoter records reflecting some use of this feature. D. Ct. Op. 39 \n(citing R. 532 at 58.) The Covid-19 pandemic has turned this \nin-person voting paradigm on its head, as Judge Conley em-\nphasized.  Whereas,  in  the  April  2019  election,  voters  re-\nquested (and were sent) a total of 167,832 absentee ballots \n(D. Ct. Op. 12 n.9), one year later, that total increased nearly \neight-fold to 1,282,762 (D. Ct. Op. 12), with absentee ballots \ncomprising 73.8 percent of ballots counted in the April 2020 \nelection (D. Ct. Op. 15).  \nThe strain that the pandemic and the sudden, unprece-\ndented preference for absentee voting placed on state and lo-\ncal officials had predictable results in the April 2020 election. \nElection officials scrambled to keep up with the overwhelm-\ning demand for absentee ballots. Between April 3 and April 6 \n(the day before the election), local officials were still in the \nprocess of mailing more than 92,000 absentee ballots, virtually \nall of which were sent too late for them to be filled out and \nmailed back by election day. D. Ct. Op. 13. Another 9,388 bal-\nlots were timely applied for but never sent. D. Ct. Op. 13. Ap-\nproximately 80,000 absentee ballots were completed and post-\nmarked on or before election day but were only received by \nelection officials in the six days after the statutory deadline for \nsuch ballots. D. Ct. Op. 17. These ballots would not have been \ncounted but for the district court’s order, sustained by this \ncourt and modified by the Supreme Court, extending the \ndeadline.  \nNotwithstanding the fact that nearly three-quarters of the \nvotes cast in the April 2020 election were via absentee ballots, \nin-person voting in that election presented challenges of its \nown. Poll workers were in short supply, as individuals who \nwould  normally  have  staffed  the  polls  (many  of  them \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\n18  Nos. 20-2835 & 20-2844 \nseniors8) stayed away in droves, particularly in urban loca-\ntions. Milwaukee, with a population of 592,025, normally op-\nerates 180 polling sites. The city could manage to open only \nfive on April 7. D. Ct. Op. 16. Green Bay, population 104,879, \nnormally operates 31 polling sites. On April 7, just two were \nopen. D. Ct. Op. 16. Lines of voters (thousands of whom had \ntimely applied for absentee ballots but had not received them) \nstretched for blocks and people waited hours to vote.9 Some \nwere masked, many were not. Some number of voters (we do \nnot know how many) showed up to vote in person after not \nreceiving an absentee ballot prior to election day and, discour-\naged by the long lines and wait times, walked away without \ncasting a vote.

To \nthe extent these modifications intrude modestly upon the \nState’s ability to establish its own rules for conducting elec-\ntions, they are more than justified by the present pandemic \nand the unacceptable risks that in-person voting presents to \nthe citizens of Wisconsin. \nThe Legislature challenges Judge Conley’s exercise of dis-\ncretion in ordering these modifications as if the Covid-19 pan-\ndemic presented a quotidian problem in an otherwise routine \nelection, where the options for voting in-person might repre-\nsent an entirely adequate alternative to voting by mail.

Ct. Op. 23; Expert \nReport of Patrick Remington, M.D. at 1 (R. 44 in Case No. 3:20-\ncv-00459-wmc).  \nPresented with the evidence as to what occurred in April \nand what is happening now with respect to the pandemic, \nJudge  Conley  reasonably  concluded  that  (1)  a  substantial \nnumber of eligible Wisconsin voters will not meet the October \n14 deadline to register online or by mail, leaving them with \nonly in-person options to register, (2) of the 1.8 to 2 million \nregistered voters who are expected to timely request absentee \nballots (D. Ct. Op. 20, 47), as many as 100,000 will not be able \nto return those ballots by election day through no fault of their \nown (D. Ct. Op. 51), and (3) when faced with the risks associ-\nated with registering or voting in-person, and potentially hav-\ning to wait in line for hours in order to do so, some number of \nvoters will deem the risk too great. These conclusions explain \nwhy he ordered modest adjustments to Wisconsin’s election \nrules in order to minimize that possibility.  \nOf all of us, Judge Conley is the one judge who heard the \nevidence first-hand and is closest to the ground in Wisconsin. \nWe  owe  deference  to  his  judgment.  He  considered  the \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\nNos. 20-2835 & 20-2844  23 \nAnderson-Burdick factors for constitutional challenges to state \nelection rules. Consistent with Luft v. Evers, 963 F.3d 665, 671 \n(7th Cir. 2020), he considered the Wisconsin election rules in \ntheir totality in assessing the burdens that those rules, under \nthe present circumstances, impose on the right to vote. He \nconsidered Purcell’s admonition that judicial orders modify-\ning election rules can result in voter confusion and an incen-\ntive not to vote, especially as an election draws closer. 549 U.S. \nat 4–5, 127 S. Ct. at 7. He considered this court’s prior ruling \nin April granting a stay as to all but two of the modifications \nordered for the April election. Bostelmann, 2020 WL 3619499. \nAnd he considered the Supreme Court’s ruling, issued one \nday prior to the April election, which both chastised the dis-\ntrict court for altering Wisconsin’s election rules within days \nof the election but also modified the extension of the ballot-\nreceipt deadline to require that mailed absentee ballots be de-\nlivered or postmarked on or before election day and accepted \nthe deadline change as modified. Republican Nat’l Com., 140 \nS. Ct. at 1207, 1208.  \nIn view of the fact that this court allowed extensions of the \nballot-request  deadline  and  ballot-receipt  deadline  to  be \nimplemented in the April election, it is not clear to me why \nthe majority has decided to stay comparable modifications \n(effectively nullifying them) for the November election. Yes, \nthe Covid-19 virus is no longer a new menace and Wisconsin \nelection officials have now had the experience of conducting \ntwo  elections  during  the  pandemic.  But  the  Wisconsin \nelection code remains one designed primarily for in-person \nvoting, whereas the surge of Covid-19 cases in Wisconsin has \nonly  increased  the  risks  associated  with  in-person  voting \nsince April. The logistical demands posed by absentee voting \nwill if anything be greater for the November general election, \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\n24  Nos. 20-2835 & 20-2844 \nwith possibly a million additional absentee ballots to be sent \nand  returned  by  mail;  and  with  the  recently-discovered \ncutbacks in Postal Service capacity,17 there is even greater \nreason to be concerned about the ability of voters to both \nregister and vote by mail. Registering and voting in person \nremain as alternatives, but no legislator, no election official, \nand certainly no judge can assure Wisconsin voters that there \nis no risk associated with registering and/or voting in person \nas infection rates spike in their communities, especially in \nhigh-population urban areas. Election officials may hope that \nmore polling places will be open in November than April, but \nthey cannot guarantee that enough poll workers will show up \non election day to avoid the sorts of long voter lines and waits \nthat made headlines then. Nor, by the way, can anyone assure \nvoters that they will not be waiting in line next to one or more \nunmasked  voters,  or  one  who  is  contagious  with  the \ncoronavirus. Indeed, a lawsuit challenging the Governor’s \nmask mandate is presently pending in the Wisconsin courts.18 \n \n17 See, e.g., Jacob Bogage, et al., DeJoy pushes back on criticism of changes to \nPostal Service, says he won’t restore sorting machines, WASHINGTON POST \n(Aug.  24,  2020),  https://www.washingtonpost.com/poli-\ntics/2020/08/24/dejoy-testimony-usps-house  /;  Elise  Viebeck  and  Jacob \nBogage, Federal judge temporarily blocks USPS operational changes amid con-\ncerns about mail slowdowns, election, WASHINGTON POST (Sept. 17, 2020), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-judge-iss-ues-tempo-\nrary-injunction-against-usps-operational-changes-amid-concerns-about-\nmail-slowdowns/2020/09/  17/34fb85a0-f91e-11ea-a275-\n1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html. \n18 See Scott Bauer, Conservative law firm seeks to end Wisconsin mask order, AP \nNEWS (Sept. 28, 2020), https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-health-\nwisconsin-public-health-270d663b9411b33a17fc45fdf8ad2720;  Molly \nBeck, GOP leaders go to court in support of effort to strike down Tony Evers’ \nmask  mandate,  WISCONSIN  JOURNAL  SENTINEL  (Oct.  2,  2020), \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\nNos. 20-2835 & 20-2844  25 \nHaving in mind the shortfalls with the April election and \nthe current public health crisis posed by the pandemic, it is \nnot unreasonable for Wisconsin voters to view the option of \nin-person registration and voting as a form of Russian rou-\nlette. For eligible voters who are unable to register by mail by \nthe statutory deadline (and for the April election, there were \nmore than 57,000 people who registered after that deadline, \nthanks  to  the  district  court’s  extension  of  that  deadline, \nD. Ct. Op. 17) and for voters who timely request an absentee \nballot but who either do not receive it by election day or re-\nceive it too late to return it by election day (more than 120,000 \nabsentee ballots were not returned by election, see D. Ct. Op. \n15), the risks associated with in-person registration and vot-\ning amount to a concrete and unacceptable, and in my view, \nsevere, restriction on the right to vote. See Luft, 963 F.3d at 672 \n(citing Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434, 112 S. Ct. at 2063; Anderson, 460 \nU.S. at 788, 103 S. Ct. at 1569–70; Acevedo v. Cook Cnty.

This is especially \ntrue of individuals who are 65 years of age or older (more than \n900,000 people in Wisconsin19), obese (some 40 percent of Wis-\nconsin adults20), or suffer from chronic health conditions that \nrender them especially vulnerable to complications from a \n \nhttps://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/02/  gop-goes-\ncourt-support-effort-strike-down-mask-mandate/ 3592966001/. \n19 See Wis.

Voters do not run the State’s election apparatus or \nthe U.S. Postal Service; they have no special insight into how \nquickly their timely requests to register and/or vote by mail \nwill be processed by election officials and how quickly the \nPostal Service will deliver their ballots. It is not reasonable to \ninsist that voters act more quickly than state deadlines require \nthem to do in order to ensure that either the State or the Postal \nService does not inadvertently disenfranchise them because \nthey are overwhelmed with the volume of mail-in registra-\ntions and absentee ballots.  \n \n21 See Mary L.

No.  8  (August  2020), \nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/20-0679 _article. \n22 Completing an absentee ballot is not a matter of simply filling it out. \nWisconsin requires absentee voters to have their ballots signed by a wit-\nness. See Wis. Stat. § 6.87(4)(b). Some 600,000 Wisconsin voters live alone \n(D. Ct. Op. 21), which means they must seek out someone outside of their \nhousehold to sign their ballots. During a time of surging Covid-19 infec-\ntions, that is not necessarily a simple task.  \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\nNos. 20-2835 & 20-2844  27 \nIt is also true that voters who receive their ballots just prior \nto the election have the option of delivering their ballots to a \ndropbox or to the polls on election day. But significant num-\nbers of Wisconsin voters lack a driver’s license (including \nroughly half of African American and Hispanic residents) and \ntherefore cannot drive themselves to a poll or dropbox.23 Re-\nlying on public transportation, a taxi, a ride-sharing service, \nor a lift from a neighbor to make the trip presents difficulties \nand risks of its own, which cannot be justified if the voter has \ntimely complied with existing deadlines and yet cannot meet \nexisting deadlines through no fault of her own.  \nI recognize that the district court’s decision to order mod-\nifications to Wisconsin’s election practices represents an in-\ntrusion into the domain of state government, but in my view \nit is a necessary one. We are seven months-plus into this pan-\ndemic. The Legislature has had ample time to make modifica-\ntions of its own to the election code and has declined to do so. \nThe  Wisconsin  Elections  Commission,  divided  3-3  along \nparty lines, concluded that it lacks the authority to order such \nmodifications. This leaves voters at the mercy of overworked \nstate and local election officials, a hamstrung Postal Service, \nand a merciless virus. What we must ask, as Judge Conley \ndid, is whether Wisconsin’s election rules, which were not \ndrafted for pandemic conditions, effectively restrict a Wiscon-\nsin citizen’s right to vote under current conditions. The an-\nswer, I submit, is yes. Based on the State’s experience with the \nApril election, we know it is likely that tens of thousands of \n \n23 See John Pawasarat, The Driver License Status of the Voting Age Population \nin Wisconsin, Employment and Training Institute, Univ. of Wis.-Milwau-\nkee (June 2005), available at https://dc.uwm.edu/eti_pubs/68/.  \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\n28  Nos. 20-2835 & 20-2844 \nvoters will not meet the October 14 deadline to register online \nor by mail, especially if they are relying on the mail to com-\nplete that process. We know that tens of thousands of voters \nlikely will not be able to return their ballots by mail before \nelection day, through no fault of their own. We know that reg-\nistering or voting in person, especially on election day, will \nexpose some number of voters to a concrete risk of Covid-19 \ninfection. Collectively, these conditions pose a real and sub-\nstantial impediment to the right to vote. Whether that obstacle \nis viewed as modest or severe, and whether viewed through \nthe lens of rational basis review or strict scrutiny, it is unac-\nceptable. The State itself purports to want people to vote ab-\nsentee, and yet has done nothing to alter its election rules to \nmake the necessary accommodations to ensure that voters are \nnot needlessly disenfranchised by the overwhelming shift \nfrom in-person to absentee voting. \nI conclude with a just a few words about each of the indi-\nvidual modifications that the district court ordered. Individ-\nually and collectively, these modifications, in my view, repre-\nsent a reasonable, proportional response to current conditions \naimed at preserving the right to vote. \nOf these, the most important, and in my view, the most \nessential of these modifications is the six-day extension of the \ndeadline for the return of absentee ballots by mail to Novem-\nber 9, 2020, so long as the ballots are postmarked on or before \nelection day. Of the five modifications ordered by the district \ncourt, none is more directly aimed at protecting the right to \nvote, in that it seeks to ensure that ballots that have been \ntimely cast by voters will be counted. The circumstances that \nwarranted a similar extension in April are even more serious \nnow: the Covid-19 pandemic makes it more imperative that \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\nNos. 20-2835 & 20-2844  29 \nas many voters as possible vote by absentee ballot; the de-\nmand  for  absentee  ballots  is  virtually  certain  to  be  even \ngreater (record-shattering) than it was in April, placing un-\nprecedented demands on election officials and the U.S. Postal \nService alike; and cutbacks implemented by the U.S. Postal \nService this summer (not all of which have been suspended or \nreversed) threaten recurrent if not worse delays in the deliv-\nery and return of absentee ballots. The fact that some 80,000 \nballots were received by mail after election day in April is all \nthe proof necessary that an extension of the receipt deadline \nis vital as a means of protecting the voting rights of tens of \nthousands of Wisconsin voters—voters who, it cannot be said \ntoo often, will timely request and complete absentee ballots \nbut are unable to return them by the election day deadline by \nno mistake or omission of their own. Against this, all that the \nLegislature offers is a wish to have the results of the election \nconclusively  determined  on  election  night.  But  weighed \nagainst the constitutional right to vote, this is thin gruel.  \nThe one-week extension of the deadline to register online \nor by mail is reasonable in terms of both the worsening pan-\ndemic and the slowdown in mail service. As Judge Conley \npointed out, Wisconsin voters are in the habit of using the \nState’s same-day registration option to register or update their \nregistration  on  election  day.  Only  as  Covid-19  infections \nsurge in Wisconsin may voters now realize that in-person reg-\nistration on election day poses unique risks, particularly if \nlines at the polls turn out to be as long as they were in April. \nAt the same time, voters seeking to register by mail may run \ninto the same problems that absentee voters encountered in \nApril with delays in the U.S. Mail. A brief extension of the \nadvance registration deadline is an appropriate response, and \nthe  Wisconsin  Election  Commission  conceded  that  the \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\n30  Nos. 20-2835 & 20-2844 \nextension would still leave adequate time for election officials \nto update pollbooks with registration information in time for \nelection day. \nThe directive to add language to the MyVote and WisVote \nwebsites (along with any relevant printed materials) regard-\ning the “indefinitely confined” exception to the photo i.d. re-\nquirement is an extremely limited order aimed at eliminating \nvoter confusion. Wisconsin law requires voters to present ap-\npropriate photographic identification in order to obtain a bal-\nlot, whether in-person or by mail. There is an exception to this \nrequirement for a voter who is “indefinitely confined” due to \nage, infirmity, or disability; the signature of the voter’s wit-\nness will be deemed sufficient in lieu of proof of i.d. The Com-\nmission’s March 2020 guidance on this exception makes clear \nthat a voter need not be permanently or totally disabled and \nwholly unable to leave one’s residence in order to qualify for \nthis exception, but this guidance is not easily available to vot-\ners and the district court found that there was a substantial \nrisk of voter confusion as to the scope of the exception with-\nout further guidance. This was a reasonable order. \nThe order to permit replacement absentee ballots to be \ntransmitted  electronically  to  domestic  civilian  voters  who \nhave not received their ballots by mail in the penultimate \nweek prior to the election (October 22–29) addresses a con-\ncrete problem that emerged in the April election: not all ab-\nsentee ballots will reach voters in time for the election even if \nthey have been timely requested. Recall that tens of thousands \nof ballots were still being mailed out within a few days of the \nelection, making it impossible for voters to return them by \nmail (if they received them at all) by election day. Wisconsin \nlaw  prohibits  election  officials  from  sending  ballots  by \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\nNos. 20-2835 & 20-2844  31 \nelectronic means to anyone but military or overseas voters. \nThat restriction was modified by judicial order in 2016, see \nOne Wisconsin Inst., Inc. v. Thomsen, 198 F. Supp. 3d 896, 946–\n48 (W.D. Wis. 2016), and until our June 2020 decision in Luft \nreversing that modification, election officials were making ab-\nsentee ballots available online or by fax as necessary to do-\nmestic civilian voters. Restoring that practice for a limited \nwindow of time in advance of the November election makes \neminent sense as a means of protecting the right to vote by \nvoters who have timely requested an absentee ballot but have \nnot received it in the mail as the election approaches.  \nFinally, in view of the severe shortages of poll workers \nthat hobbled the April election with numerous poll closings \nand massive voting delays, the order that local officials be al-\nlowed to employ poll workers who are not electors in the \ncounty where they will serve is both necessary and reasona-\nble. Adequate staffing of the polls is essential to minimizing \nvoter wait times and, in turn, public health risks. Allowing \npoll workers (be they civilians or National Guard reservists) \nto work outside of their own counties is a modest and entirely \nreasonable means of achieving that end, one that poses no risk \nto the integrity of the election. The Legislature has articulated \nno reason why this accommodation is either unnecessary or \ninappropriate.  \nGiven the great care that the district court took in issuing \nits preliminary injunction and the ample factual record sup-\nporting its decision, I am dismayed to be dissenting. It is a \nvirtual certainty that current conditions will result in many \nvoters, possibly tens of thousands, being disenfranchised ab-\nsent changes to an election code designed for in-person voting \non election day. We cannot turn a blind eye to the present \n\nCase: 20-2835      Document: 76            Filed: 10/08/2020      Pages: 32\n32  Nos. 20-2835 & 20-2844 \ncircumstances and treat this as an ordinary election. Nor can \nwe blindly defer to a state legislature that sits on its hands \nwhile a pandemic rages. The district court ordered five mod-\nest changes to Wisconsin’s election rules aimed at minimizing \nthe number of voters who may be denied the right to vote. \nToday, in the midst of a pandemic and significantly slowed \nmail delivery, this court leaves voters to their own devices.  \nGood luck and G-d bless, Wisconsin. You are going to \nneed it.  ",

The April 7, 2020 election was unlike any other in Wisconsin’s history, tainted by \nbreakdowns in critical aspects of the election process and disenfranchisement of a substantial \nnumber of Wisconsin voters. Two days before the election, the Surgeon General of the United \nStates likened the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic to the Pearl Harbor and \nSeptember 11 attacks, warning the nation to prepare for the “saddest week of most Americans’ \nlives.”1 While all other states with primaries scheduled in April delayed their elections, \nWisconsin held its election in the midst of a global pandemic. Defendants and others took steps \nto attempt to administer the election fairly, including some at the order of this Court, but those \nactions were insufficient to protect the rights of Wisconsin voters. As a result, voters were forced \nto choose between forgoing their constitutional rights to participate in their democracy or risking \nthe health of themselves and their loved ones in order to vote. Tens of thousands of voters were \ndisenfranchised by failures in the absentee and in-person voting systems. The election shook the \npublic’s faith in the democratic process. \n2.  This outcome was foreseeable and, for too many Wisconsin voters, including \nPlaintiffs, preventable. For over a month before the election, Defendants were aware of the \ngrowing danger of COVID-19 and the attendant risks of administering an election during the \nescalating pandemic. With each passing day, public health officials grew louder in their calls for \nsocial distancing, urging Americans to stay at home. Each day brought more deaths and more \nnew infections. By election day, 83 Wisconsinites had died of COVID-19 and 2,440 residents \nwere known to be infected with the virus. At the same time, election experts from across the \ncountry expressed alarm over the lack of actionable steps taken by the state to conduct an \n \n1 Quint Forgey, Surgeon General Warns This Week ‘Is Going to Be Our Pearl Harbor Moment’, POLITICO (Apr. 5, \n2020), available at https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/05/surgeon-general-pearl-harbor-moment-165729.   \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 3 of 71\nelection in such extraordinary circumstances. As municipal and county clerks warned about the \nlack of capacity and resources to carry out the election properly, nine mayors, including the \nmayors of the five largest cities in Wisconsin, demanded that the election be postponed.2  \n3.  What ensued has been described by one election law expert as the biggest election \nfailure since the Voting Rights Act was enacted in 1965.3 Voters encountered obstacles at almost \nevery stage of the election process, including: navigating the online systems designed to register \nvoters and request absentee ballots; requesting absentee ballots, which were either never \ndelivered or delivered too late; and voting in person. Before election day, 111 voting \njurisdictions reported not having enough poll workers to open even one polling place; on election \nday, Milwaukee had 5 (of its usual 180) polling locations, Green Bay had 2 (of its usual 31) \npolling locations, and Waukesha had only 1 (of its usual 15). Voters who did go to the polls in \nmany places encountered long waits and voting locations without adequate safety supplies for \nvoters and poll workers alike. \n4.  Plaintiffs bring this case to prevent a replay of this mass disenfranchisement in \neither the August Partisan Primary or the November General Election. Like the April 7 election, \nthose elections will take place against the backdrop of COVID-19 and the extraordinary \nchallenges it presents to election administrators and voters. There is a growing consensus among \nexperts that COVID-19 will alter the daily lives of Americans at least into next year, and \ncertainly through November. Whatever the precise course of the pandemic between now and the \ncoming elections, there is no question that community transmission and attendant risks will \n \n2 Joseph Ax, Citing Coronavirus, Wisconsin Mayors Urge Postponement of Tuesday’s Election, REUTERS (Apr. 5, \n2020), available at https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-election-wisconsin/citing-coronavirus-\nwisconsin-mayors-urge-postponement-of-tuesdays-election-idUSKBN21O0CZ.  \n3 Shawn Johnson, To the Polls in a Pandemic: How Wisconsin Went Ahead with an Election Amidst a Public Health \nCrisis, WIS. PUBLIC RADIO (Apr. 13, 2020), available at  \nhttps://www.wpr.org/polls-pandemic-how-wisconsin-went-ahead-election-amidst-public-health-crisis.  \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 4 of 71\ncontinue to impact the demand for online registration and for absentee voting methods, safe \nprotocols for in-person voting, and other mechanics and processes of voting and election \nadministration. The U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 require Defendants to \nadminister upcoming elections in a way that avoids forcing voters to choose between their votes \nand their safety.   \n5.  The U.S. Constitution guarantees that no eligible Wisconsin citizen will be \ndeprived of the right to vote. Plaintiffs are individuals who were deprived of that right in the \nApril 7 election and organizations whose work to ensure that Wisconsinites can participate in \nelections is burdened by Defendants’ failure to provide a safe and accessible election under \npandemic conditions. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants, by failing to take appropriate actions to \nensure that Wisconsinites can safely access the ballot, violated Section 11(b) of the Voting \nRights Act, the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, and the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (“the ADA”). They bring this civil action to enjoin Defendants—\nCommissioners and the Administrator of the Wisconsin Elections Commission—from similarly \nviolating Wisconsinites’ rights to vote during future elections affected by COVID-19. \n6.  As the April 7 election demonstrated, Defendants maintain and administer an \nelection system that—amidst a pandemic that both Wisconsin and national public health officials \nexpect will continue and might well intensify between now and November—forces voters to \nchoose between casting a ballot and protecting their own, their families’, and their communities’ \nhealth. In the April 7 election, Defendants failed to take available steps necessary to allow voters \nto vote safely, either in person or by the absentee voting procedures provided by Wisconsin law; \nand, despite the reports of substantial voter disenfranchisement, they have not taken sufficient \nsteps to remedy those failures in advance of the coming elections. The burdens imposed by those \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 5 of 71\nfailures, moreover, did not fall equally on voters across the state. As a result, voters faced starkly \ndifferent opportunities to safely cast a ballot depending on where they live, their age, their \ndisability status, and their race. \n7.  Plaintiffs do not contest the results of the April 7 election. Plaintiffs instead come \nbefore this Court to obtain an order requiring Defendants to administer impending elections in a \nmanner that will not violate eligible voters’ federally protected rights to participate in those \nelections. To be sure, Wisconsin’s April 7 election was conducted in the face of a public health \ncrisis that few foresaw until the month before the election, and many election officials worked \nhard to manage the challenges it posed. Those challenges, however, do not alter the fundamental \ncommands of the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act, and the Americans with Disabilities \nAct: that Defendants take reasonable steps to ensure that all voters can safely access the ballot \nand participate equally in a fair democratic process. \n8.  Specifically, to comply with the requirements of federal law, Defendants must \nensure that in-person voting can be safely conducted during the impending elections, including \nby mandating that all polling locations be managed in compliance with social distancing \nguidelines to minimize COVID-19 transmission risk; that there is an adequate number of poll \nworkers to open and administer safe, in-person polling locations; that ample, safe opportunities \nfor in-person absentee voting are available; that all voters who request and are qualified to \nreceive absentee ballots in fact timely receive those ballots; that voters can safely, effectively, \nand timely return their absentee ballots so their votes are counted; and that online systems \ndesigned to register voters and request absentee ballots are sufficient to handle anticipated voter \ntraffic. Critically, to restore public confidence in the electoral process and prevent further \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 6 of 71\ndisenfranchisement, Defendants must also educate the Wisconsin public about how they can \nsafely vote—either in person or by absentee ballot—in the impending elections. \n9.  Defendants failed to implement such measures for the April 7 election and have \nnot taken steps to do so for the rapidly approaching August and November elections. Careful \npreparations are necessary to meet the inevitable challenges of conducting safe, fair elections \namidst a pandemic. And those preparations must be undertaken sufficiently in advance of \nelection day. Implementing changes to the administration of elections requires planning and \npreparation. Yet Defendants have not adopted policies that would implement the changes \nnecessary to avoid the widespread disenfranchisement and substantial burdens on the right to \nvote that plagued the April 7 primary. Absent intervention by this Court—including by requiring \nDefendants to adopt such necessary policies when authorized by state law, and by enjoining state \nlaws that currently preclude Defendants from taking necessary measures—the same electoral \nprocess breakdown and resulting violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under federal law is likely to recur \nduring the impending August Partisan Primary and November General Election. \nPARTIES \nI.  Plaintiffs \n10.  Plaintiff Jill Swenson is a resident of Appleton, Wisconsin, and a registered \nvoter. Ms. Swenson is sixty-one years old and has early stage chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease (“COPD”), an inflammatory lung disease. Ms. Swenson was unable to vote in person \nbecause of the risk to her physical health and safety represented by the COVID-19 pandemic. \nShe requested and received a mail-in absentee ballot, but she lives alone and was unable to \nsecure an in-person witness. Consistent with this Court’s order in Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. \nBostelmann, No. 20-CV-249-WMC, 2020 WL 1638374, *18-20 (W.D. Wis. Apr. 2, 2020), she \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 7 of 71\nmailed in an un-witnessed absentee ballot on the morning of April 3, 2020. After the Seventh \nCircuit stayed that order, Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann, Nos. 20-1538, 1539, 1545, \n1546, Order (7th Cir. Apr. 3, 2020), and as a result of Defendants’ decision not to provide voters \nlike Ms. Swenson a reasonable opportunity to cure, Ms. Swenson’s ballot was not counted. She \nwas thus disenfranchised in the April 7 election. Ms. Swenson does not currently have a safe and \neffective way to cast a ballot in the upcoming elections.  \n11.  Plaintiff Melody McCurtis is a resident of Sherman Park in Northwest \nMilwaukee, Wisconsin, and a registered voter. Ms. McCurtis lives with her \nimmunocompromised mother, so it was unsafe for her to vote in person due to the COVID-19 \npandemic. As a Black community organizer, she is also aware of the disproportionate rates of \ninfection and death in the Black community, and these elevated risks added to her fears. She \ntimely requested an absentee ballot on March 22, 2020. Her ballot never arrived. In order to vote \nin the April 7 election, Ms. McCurtis was forced to endanger her mother and endure a wait of \nmore than two hours at Washington High School. Ms. McCurtis was unsafe because voters in \nline were not able to maintain social distance, because the polling location did not provide voters \nwith personal protective equipment, and because voting equipment did not appear to be sanitary. \nMs. McCurtis plans to vote in August and November and presently does not have a safe, \nequitable way to cast her ballot. \n12.  Plaintiff Maria Nelson is a resident of Appleton, Wisconsin, and a registered \nvoter. Ms. Nelson has breast cancer and has been undergoing treatment since February 2019. As \na result, she did not feel safe voting in person. Ms. Nelson timely emailed her absentee ballot \nrequest to the Appleton Clerk’s office. She did not receive an absentee ballot by April 7, 2020. \nMs. Nelson was unable to vote in person on April 7 because of the risk to her physical health and \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 8 of 71\nsafety represented by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Ms. Nelson was thus disenfranchised in \nthe April 7 election. Ms. Nelson does not currently have a safe and effective way to cast a ballot \nin the upcoming elections. \n13.  Plaintiff Black Leaders Organizing for Communities (“BLOC”) is a civic \nengagement project based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and a fiscally sponsored project of Tides \nAdvocacy, a California nonprofit. BLOC mobilizes Black Wisconsinites to participate at all \nlevels of government and encourages communities of color to fulfill their potential for electoral \nimpact in Milwaukee. As part of its work, BLOC educates the Black community in Milwaukee \nabout voter eligibility rules and the options for casting a ballot, and it conducts a get-out-the-vote \nfield program. In the run-up to the April 7 election, BLOC was forced to divert significant \nresources in response to the constitutional and statutory violations challenged here. BLOC staff \nwere forced to spend additional time troubleshooting online registration and absentee ballot \nrequest issues, walking voters through changing deadlines, and providing them with information \nabout what in-person voting in Milwaukee would look like. This diversion of resources has \ncontinued through the May 12th Special Election and will continue through the August and \nNovember elections if these violations are not remedied. \n14.  Plaintiff Disability Rights Wisconsin (“DRW”) is a statewide nonpartisan, \nnonprofit, non-stock corporation organized under the laws of Wisconsin. DRW is based in \nMadison, and maintains offices across the state, including in Menasha, Milwaukee, Green Bay, \nand Rice Lake. DRW’s mission is to address the issues facing, and to ensure the rights of, all \npeople with disabilities in Wisconsin. DRW is a member of the National Disability Rights \nNetwork and is designated by the Governor of Wisconsin to act as the congressionally mandated \nprotection and advocacy system for Wisconsin citizens with disabilities, pursuant to Wis. Stat. \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 9 of 71\n§ 51.62; 29 U.S.C. § 794e; 42 U.S.C. §§ 15041, et seq.; and 42 U.S.C. §§ 10801, et seq. \nAccordingly, DRW has a state and federal mandate to protect and advocate for the rights of \npeople with disabilities in Wisconsin, including those with developmental disabilities, mental \nillness, and traumatic brain injury. As part of this mandate, DRW oversees self-advocacy training \nand other programs and services to assist people with disabilities, including to secure election \naccess, registering to vote, accessing polling places, and casting their ballots, and it staffs a Voter \nHotline to assist voters with disabilities. DRW also co-leads the Wisconsin Disability Vote \nCoalition. In the run-up to the April 7 election, DRW was forced to divert significant resources \nin response to the constitutional and statutory violations challenged here. DRW had to produce \nnumerous resources and trainings for voters that it would not have otherwise produced, and it \nhad to spend staff time untangling the options for voters with disabilities and assisting voters \nwho were at risk of being disenfranchised. This diversion of resources has continued through the \nMay 12th Special Election and will continue through the August and November elections if these \nviolations are not remedied. DRW also brings this suit on behalf of people with disabilities in \nWisconsin who face significant obstacles to voting as a result of COVID-19 and will either be \ndisenfranchised or exposed to heightened risk of illness if their legal rights to safely vote are not \nvindicated. \nII.  Defendants \n15.  Defendants Marge Bostelmann, Julie M. Glancey, Ann S. Jacobs, Dean \nKnudson, Robert F. Spindell, Jr., and Mark L. Thomsen are the six Commissioners of the \nWisconsin Elections Commission and are named as Defendants in their official capacities. \nTogether, they comprise the Wisconsin Elections Commission, the body that administers and \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 10 of 71\nenforces Wisconsin’s election laws other than those related to campaign finance. Wis. Stat. \n§ 5.05(1), (2w). \n16.  Defendant Meagan Wolfe is sued in her official capacity as the Administrator of \nthe Wisconsin Elections Commission. She is the chief elections officer of the state. Wis. Stat. \n§ 5.05(3g). \n17.  Defendants have acted under color of state law at all times relevant to this action. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n18.  Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 to redress the \ndeprivation, under color of state law, of rights secured by the U.S. Constitution and by the \nVoting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. §§ 10101, et seq., and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 12131, et seq. This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331 and 1343 because this case arises under the U.S. Constitution and federal statute and \nseeks equitable and declaratory relief for the deprivation of federal constitutional and statutory \nrights under color of state law. \n19.  This Court has jurisdiction to award attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1988(b) and 28 U.S.C. § 1920. \n20.  This Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201 and 2202. \n21.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants, who are sued in their \nofficial capacities only. \n22.  Venue is appropriate in the Western District of Wisconsin, under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1391(b)(1), because Defendants are state officials located in Madison, Wisconsin. A \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 11 of 71\nsubstantial part of the events giving rise to these claims occurred and continues to occur in this \ndistrict, making venue also proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2). \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  Defendants and the Wisconsin Elections Commission \n23.  The Wisconsin Elections Commission (“the Commission”) administers and \nenforces all “laws relating to elections and election campaigns, other than laws relating to \ncampaign financing,” which are administered separately by the Wisconsin Ethics Commission. \nWis. Stat. § 5.05(1), (2w).  \n24.  The Commission consists of six members, four appointed by legislative leaders \nand two nominated by the Governor. Wis. Stat. § 15.61. Defendants Bostelmann, Glancey, \nJacobs, Knudson, Spindell, and Thomsen are the members of the Commission. \n25.  The Commission operates “under the direction and supervision of an \nadministrator,” who also serves as the “chief election officer” for the state. Wis. Stat. \n§ 15.61(1)(b); Wis. Stat. § 5.05(3g). Defendant Wolfe is the Administrator of the Commission. \n26.  The Commission maintains wide-ranging authority over the architecture of \nWisconsin’s electoral system. The Commission retains authority to promulgate rules “applicable \nto all jurisdictions for the purposes of interpreting or implementing the laws regulating the \nconduct of elections or election campaigns, other than laws regulating campaign financing, or \nensuring their proper administration.” Wis. Stat. § 5.05(1)(f). \n27.  Among many other things, the Commission’s authority includes: \n•  Issuing appropriate guidance or formal advisory opinions, or promulgating \nadministrative rules, necessary to implement any state or federal court decision that is \nbinding on the Commission. Wis. Stat. § 5.05(5t). \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 12 of 71\n•  Providing financial assistance to eligible counties and municipalities for election \nadministration costs, consistent with other provisions of state law. Wis. Stat. \n§ 5.05(10)-(11).  \n•  Conducting or prescribing requirements for educational programs to inform electors \nabout voting procedures, voting rights, and voting technology. Wis. Stat. § 5.05(12). \n•   Ensuring that the voting system used at each polling place permits all individuals \nwith disabilities to vote without the need for assistance and with the same degree of \nprivacy that is accorded to nondisabled electors voting at the same polling place. Wis. \nStat. § 5.25(4); and \n•  Prescribing uniform instructions for municipalities to provide to absentee electors. \nWis. Stat. § 6.869. \n28.  The Commission may also “reconsider at any time any written directives or \nwritten guidance provided to the general public . . . with regard to the enforcement and \nadministration” of Wisconsin election law, including by county and municipal officials. Wis. \nStat. § 5.05(16)(c). \n29.  Defendants at all times acted under color of state law.  \nII.  The Coronavirus Pandemic and Wisconsin’s Response \nA. COVID-19 and its Health Effects \n30.  In the United States, the first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus known as \nCOVID-19 was identified in Washington State on January 21, 2020.  \n31.  People infected by COVID-19 exhibit a wide range of symptoms, most \nprominently cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.4 In addition, according to the \n \n4 Ctrs. for Disease Control and Prevention, “Symptoms of Coronavirus,” available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html (last updated May 13, 2020).  \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 13 of 71\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), five other symptoms indicate that a \nperson may have COVID-19, including: fever, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, and new loss of \ntaste or smell.5 \n32.  COVID-19 is an especially infectious virus because it is frequently transmitted by \npeople who are not experiencing symptoms. It may take up to 14 days after exposure to the virus \nfor a person to exhibit any symptoms, and people may be most infectious prior to exhibiting \nsymptoms. One study estimated that 44 percent of people infected contracted the virus from \npeople who felt healthy at the time.6 In fact, some people may remain asymptomatic carriers and \nnonetheless transmit the virus.7 Others recover fully from their symptoms and continue shedding \nthe virus that can infect others.8  \n33.  The highly infectious nature of the disease—including its long incubation period \nand the number of asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and post-symptomatic carriers—poses \nsignificant concerns for populations that are most vulnerable to COVID-19, such as the elderly \nand the immunocompromised. The CDC identifies older adults as having a higher risk of \ndeveloping more serious complications from COVID-19 and recommends that they stay home as \nmuch as possible when the virus is spreading in the community. The CDC has also warned that \nimmunocompromised people (including smokers, those undergoing cancer treatment, bone \nmarrow or organ transplantation, and those with poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and immune \ndeficiencies), as well as individuals with lung disease, asthma, heart conditions, severe obesity, \ndiabetes, chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, and liver disease are at higher risk of \n \n5 Id. \n6 Katherine Harmon Courage, How People Are Spreading Covid-19 Without Symptoms, VOX (Apr. 22, 2020), \navailable at https://www.vox.com/2020/4/22/21230301/coronavirus-symptom-asymptomatic-carrier-spread. \n7 Id. \n8 Are COVID-19 Patients Contagious After Symptoms, LABMATE (Apr. 16, 2020), available at https://www.labmate-\nonline.com/news/laboratory-products/3/breaking-news/are-covid-19-patients-contagious-after-symptoms/52030.  \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 14 of 71\ndeveloping more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.9 The Kaiser Family Foundation \nestimated that 92.6 million Americans ages 18 and older—nearly 40 percent of all American \nadults—are at heightened risk from COVID-19.10 \n34.  People outside of these groups, however, are not free from risk. The Wisconsin \nDepartment of Health Services has warned that “[y]ounger people, and particularly those who \nare 18 to 30 years old, aren’t immune to COVID-19.”11 A recent CDC analysis of coronavirus \ncases from mid-February to mid-March found that a fifth of those who needed to be hospitalized \nwere ages 20 to 44, and nearly half were ages 20 to 54.12 In Wisconsin, people ages 20 to 49 \naccount for 54 percent of all COVID-19 cases.13 \n35.  COVID-19 is infecting and killing Black people at disproportionately high rates \nacross the United States. The latest available data indicates that the COVID-19 mortality rate for \nBlack Americans is 2.3 times higher than the rate for Whites and Asians and 2.2 times higher \nthan the rate for Latinos.14 A Washington Post analysis of available data and census \ndemographics shows that “counties that are majority-black have three times the rate of infections \nand almost six times the rate of deaths as counties where white residents are in the majority.”15 \n \n9 Ctrs. for Disease Control and Prevention, “People Who Are at Higher Risk for Severe Illness,” available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html (last updated May \n14, 2020).  \n10 Wyatt Koma, et al., How Many Adults Are at Risk of Serious Illness If Infected with Coronavirus?

In Wisconsin, Governor Tony Evers has called the disproportionally high \nCOVID-19 rates and deaths in the Black community “a crisis within a crisis.” Although Black \nWisconsinites comprise just 6.7 percent of the state’s population, they account for roughly a \nfourth of COVID-19 deaths and nearly a fifth of COVID-19 cases.16 In Milwaukee County, an \nanalysis found that areas that are “predominantly black are experiencing disproportionately high \nnumbers of reported cases and concentrations of coronavirus clusters,” adding that “[r]ace is \nemerging as [a] key factor in determining who lives and who dies as this virus sweeps through \nthe county.”17 Indeed, Blacks in Milwaukee are dying at nearly double the rate of their respective \nshare of the population.18  \n37.  Overall, according to the World Health Organization, “around 1 in every 5 people \nwho catch COVID-19 needs hospital treatment.”19 To date, in Wisconsin, 13 percent of cases \nhave required hospitalization, 3 percent of cases have required intensive care, and 3 percent of \ncases have ended in death.20 \n \n16 Wis.

According to the CDC, the best way to protect against illness from COVID-19 is \nto avoid exposure. As a result, the CDC recommends putting “distance between yourself and \nother people outside your home” if COVID-19 is spreading in your community.21 \nB.  February and March in Wisconsin \n39.  On February 5, 2020, Wisconsin announced its first known case of COVID-19, \nthe twelfth confirmed case in the United States.22  \n40.  During a February 27 Commission meeting, the first at which COVID-19 was \ndiscussed, Defendant Knudson, the Chair of the Commission, dismissed the need to plan for a \nCOVID-19 outbreak, saying “at worst . . . there would be either long lines or a delay in \nreporting” and boasting about the Commission’s “robust procedures” for absentee voting.23 \nWhen pressed on how to ensure that every voter would have access to the polls during a \ncoronavirus outbreak, Defendant Knudson changed the subject.  \n41.  On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared an international \npandemic. On the same day, municipal clerks in Wisconsin began raising concerns about the \nimpact on the upcoming election, including polling place closures and poll worker shortages. On \nthat date, Wisconsin had six confirmed COVID-19 cases.24  \n42.  On March 12, 2020, Governor Tony Evers declared a health emergency in \nresponse to the virus, authorizing the Department of Health Services to “take all necessary and \nappropriate measures to prevent and respond to incidents of COVID-19” and activating the \n \n21 Ctrs. for Disease Control and Prevention, “How to Protect Yourself & Others,” available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html (last accessed May 11, 2020). \n22 Bill Miston & Katie Delong, DHS officials confirm 1st case of coronavirus in Wisconsin, patient in ‘home \nisolation’, FOX NEWS 6 (Feb. 5, 2020), available at https://fox6now.com/2020/02/05/dhs-officials-confirm-1st-case-\nof-coronavirus-in-wisconsin/. \n23 WisconsinEye, “Wisconsin Elections Commission February 2020 Meeting” (Feb. 27, 2020), available at \nhttps://wiseye.org/2020/02/27/wisconsin-elections-commission-february-2020-meeting/, at 1:46:07 - 1:50:38.  \n24 Shamane Mills, COVID-19 Cases in Wisconsin Jump from 3 to 6, WIS.

By March 15, 2020, as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wisconsin \nrose to 33,27 Milwaukee city officials stated they would need 1,800 new poll workers to replace \nolder poll workers at higher risk of serious illness.  \n44.  On March 17, 2020, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services banned \ngatherings of 10 or more people. In response, the Mayor of Green Bay noted that the city would \nbe “unable to administer a normal election.”28  \n45.  The next day, multiple Defendants acknowledged that it was not possible for the \nstate to have a safe and fair election on April 7. Defendant Ann Jacobs said that she “no longer \nbelieve[d] that we are able to fairly and properly administer this election without delay or \npostponement, . . . I believe we’re putting people at risk.” Defendant Mark Thomsen echoed that \nconcern, saying, “We’re going to have an election where no one can vote safely — that’s \nabsurd,” and Defendant Julie Glancey argued in favor of an election by mail-in ballot only.29   \n \n25 Wis.

On March 20, 2020, a bipartisan group of mayors from Green Bay, Appleton, and \nNeenah urged that the election be delayed.

Events Leading up to the April 7 Election  \n51.  On April 2, 2020, after an extensive evidentiary hearing, this Court entered an \ninjunction (a) ordering that absentee ballots received by April 13, 2020 at 4 p.m. be counted; (b) \nextending by one day, to April 3, 2020, the window to request an absentee ballot; and (c) \nadjusting the requirement under Wis. Stat. § 6.87(2) that absentee voters have a witness sign \ntheir ballot. Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann, No. 20-CV-249-WMC, 2020 WL 1638374, \n*22 (W.D. Wis. Apr. 2, 2020).  \n52.  With respect to the absentee witness requirement, the Court ordered that \nDefendants “accept an unwitnessed ballot that contains a written affirmation or other statement \nby an absentee voter that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he or she was unable to safely obtain a \nwitness certification despite his or her reasonable efforts to do so, provided that the ballot is \notherwise valid.” Id., at *20.  \n53.  The next day, April 3, 2020, the Seventh Circuit stayed the portion of this Court’s \ndecision that adjusted the witness requirement for absentee voters but declined to modify the \nDistrict Court’s extension of the absentee ballot deadline.

On April 6, 2020, at 12:46 p.m., just eighteen hours before polls opened, \nGovernor Evers issued Executive Order No. 74, suspending in-person voting for the April 7 \nelection until June 9, or a different date ordered by the legislature.36 Less than 5 hours later, the \nWisconsin Supreme Court enjoined the Governor’s order, holding that he did not have the power \nto change the date of the election.37  \n56.  Several hours after that, the United States Supreme Court held that all absentee \nballots had to be postmarked by April 7 to be counted, partially overturning this Court’s Order. \nRepublican Nat’l Comm. v.

Moreover, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services has identified 52 cases \nof COVID-19 among poll workers and voters who were at in-person voting locations during the \nApril 7 election and could have contracted the disease at those locations.43  \n60.  Defendants’ administration of the April 7 election failed on numerous \ndimensions, described in detail below. These failures caused substantial disenfranchisement, \nparticularly among elderly voters, voters with disabilities, immunocompromised voters, and \nvoters of color. Fundamentally, Defendants lacked a coherent, effective plan to ensure that each \nand every voter had a full and fair opportunity to vote while remaining protected from the threat \npresented by COVID-19. \nA.

Defendants failed to maintain digital systems sufficient to meet the needs of \nWisconsin voters with respect to online registration and absentee ballot requests. \n62.  Wisconsin law requires eligible voters to register in order to cast a ballot. Wis. \nStat. § 6.27. Eligible voters can register in person or by mail until 5:00 p.m. on the third \nWednesday before election day, or online until 11:59 p.m. on the third Wednesday before \nelection day. Wis. Stat. § 6.28(1). Thus, for the April 7 election, the deadline for registration was \nset by statute on March 18, 2020. With respect to online registration, this Court’s Order \nsubsequently extended the deadline until March 30, 2020. Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. \nBostelmann, No. 20-CV-249-WMC, 2020 WL 1320819, at *9 (W.D. Wis. Mar. 20, 2020). \n63.  Those who miss these deadlines can register at the municipal clerk’s office until \nclose of business on the Friday before election day, Wis. Stat. § 6.29(2)(a), or in person on \nelection day. See generally Wis. Stat. § 6.55.  \n64.  Eligible voters who register to vote electronically or by mail must provide a copy \nof an “identifying document that establishes proof of residence.” Wis. Stat. § 6.34(2). To do so, \nthey must not only have access to the document, but be able to upload or photocopy it. The only \nexception to this requirement is for individuals registering electronically, who do not have to \nprovide such documentation if they provide “the number of a current and valid operator’s license \n[or] identification card.” Wis. Stat. § 6.34(2m). To vote at polls, eligible voters must present an \napproved voter ID. Wis. Stat. § 6.79. \n65.  The Wisconsin Division of Motor Vehicles (“DMV”) is responsible for issuing all \ndriver’s license, state ID, or official voter ID cards to Wisconsin residents. Many people can still \nonly obtain a qualifying voter ID by actually visiting a DMV office in person, including those \nwho are applying for a Wisconsin identification card for the first time, or who have not held a \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 23 of 71\nqualifying Wisconsin ID in recent years. Many of those in this category are voters with \ndisabilities. \n66.  Wisconsin allows voters to vote by absentee ballot without providing an excuse \nfor why they cannot vote in person. See Wis. Stat. § 6.20. Eligible voters can request an absentee \nballot by mail; in person at the municipal clerk’s office; by signing a statement and requesting to \nreceive an absentee ballot under special procedures for voters who are indefinitely confined; by \nan agent, under special procedures for voters who are hospitalized; by delivery to a special \nvoting deputy; or by e-mail or fax. Wis. Stat. § 6.86(1)(a).  \n67.  Defendants administer the digital systems that track voter registration and \nabsentee balloting. MyVote is the public-facing website that allows eligible voters to review \ngeneral information, register to vote, request an absentee ballot, view the contents of their ballot, \nview their voting history, and find their polling place. WisVote is Wisconsin’s statewide voter \nlist and election-management database, accessible to election officials.  \n68.  When a request for an absentee ballot is made by a voter in the MyVote website, \nthe system converts it into an email. Next, a municipal elections clerk must review the email to \nverify the voter’s identification, manually enter the information into WisVote, and print mailing \nlabels.44 \n69.  MyVote has seen increased traffic in the last few years. It has experienced outages \nsince at least early 2020, which Defendant Wolfe acknowledged in a memorandum on February \n18, 2020.45 Defendants failed to take sufficient action to remedy and prevent those outages, and \nas a result the outages continued during high-demand periods in the run-up to the April 7 \n \n44 Chen, et al., ‘They Should Have Done Something’: Broad Failures Fueled Wisconsin Ballot Crisis, Investigation \nShows. \n45 Wis.

During the specific periods of time that voters sought to register to vote or request an \nabsentee ballot for that election, the MyVote website suffered from outages and was sometimes \nerroneously closed to new requests.46  \n70.  Absentee ballot requests also caused problems for the system.47 \n71.  An investigation by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, FRONTLINE, and \nColumbia Journalism Investigations into Wisconsin’s April 7 election named the “[i]nadequate \ncomputer system” as one of the main problems in the election. 48 It found eligible voters in Lodi, \nPewaukee, Marshfield, Shorewood, and Bristol who had trouble requesting absentee ballots \nonline, either because the system simply crashed or because they had to give up after spending \nhours in front of a computer trying to make their request. The investigation also found that—\nacross eight cities—Wisconsin voters said they requested absentee ballots only to be later \ninformed that the state’s system had no record of their request.49  \n72.  Defendants do not appear to have secured the server capacity and bandwidth \nnecessary to support the surge of online registrations and online absentee ballot requests that was \ninevitable for an election conducted under the threat of COVID-19. \n73.  Defendants did not take action to divert traffic away from the website. \n74.  Defendant Wolfe wrote in a memorandum after the election that the WisVote \nsystem “performed very well but required round the clock monitoring and auditing to handle this \nunique and unprecedented user behavior and traffic.”50  \n \n46 Chen, et al., ‘They Should Have Done Something’: Broad Failures Fueled Wisconsin Ballot Crisis, Investigation \nShows. \n47 Id.  \n48 Id.  \n49 Id.  \n50 Wis.

Defendants’ Failures to Ensure Distribution of Requested Absentee Ballots \nDisenfranchised Voters \n \n76.  Defendants failed to ensure that voters who requested absentee ballots timely \nreceived them, resulting in the disenfranchisement of those, like immunocompromised voters, \nunable to vote in person. \n77.  Under Wisconsin law, voters can request absentee ballots until 5:00 p.m. on the \nfifth day before an election, and in-person requests must be made at the municipal clerk’s office \nby the Sunday preceding an election. Wis. Stat. § 6.86(1)(b). Municipal clerks must send an \nabsentee ballot within one business day of when the request was received. Wis. Stat. § 7.15(cm). \n78.  For the April 7 election, the deadline for the receipt of absentee ballot requests \nwas set by statute as April 2, 2020. With respect to mail, fax, or email absentee ballot requests, \nthis Court’s Order subsequently extended the deadline to April 3, 2020. Democratic Nat’l Comm. \nv. Bostelmann, No. 20-CV-249-WMC, ___ F.Supp.3d ___, 2020 WL 1638374, at *2 (W.D. Wis. \nApr. 2, 2020). \n79.  Wisconsin law requires voters to present a copy of their proof of identification \nwith their application for an absentee ballot. Wis. Stat. § 6.86(1)(ac). \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 26 of 71\n80.  Approximately 73% of votes ultimately cast in the April 7 election were absentee \nballots;51 by contrast, in the 2016 General Election, just 27% of the votes were cast absentee.52  \n81.  However, many voters, especially immunocompromised voters, were unable to \nparticipate in the April 7 election as a result of Defendants’ failures to ensure effective and \ntimely distribution of absentee ballots.  \n82.  Wisconsin Elections Commission data show that on election day, more than \n12,000 requested absentee ballots had not yet been sent to voters. Voters around the state who \nhad timely requested absentee ballots never received them. One survey found that voters from \nalmost 100 Wisconsin cities and towns reported not receiving an absentee ballot, despite having \nrequested one—in most cases at least two weeks in advance of the election.53 \n83.  Moreover, according to the Commission’s website, 14.5% of 1,284,438 absentee \nballots sent to voters (over 186,000 votes) had not been returned by April 13, 2020.54 In \ncomparison, in the 2016 general election, only 14,480, or 1.7%, of the 845,243 absentee ballots \nsent were reported as having not been received for counting.55 Though it is impossible to know \nwhat proportion of absentee ballots were not returned because voters did not timely receive \nthem, the disproportionate non-return rate suggests that thousands of additional voters who \ntimely requested ballots never actually received them. These data do not take into account how \n \n51 Chen, et al., ‘They Should Have Done Something’: Broad Failures Fueled Wisconsin Ballot Crisis, Investigation \nShows. \n52 Wis.

One estimate put the number of returned \nballots that were not counted because of mail delays and confusion about deadlines in the tens of \nthousands.56 \n84.  Several problems contributed to this failure to ensure effective distribution of \nabsentee ballots: \n•  First, a shortage of envelopes appears to have delayed the mailing of absentee \nballots. On March 18, for example, Defendants noted that clerks across the state \nestimated a shortage of approximately 600,000 envelopes.57 Although Defendants \nworked with paper suppliers to address the shortage, it created a backlog that \ncontributed to delays.58 \n•  Second, election clerks struggled to keep up with the large volume of absentee \nballot requests, and Defendants did not provide them with additional funding or \nstaff to help. The Madison City Clerk reported that there was “no way humanly \npossible” for officials to mail out ballots at the rate they were receiving requests, \ndespite working 110 hours a week.59 She suggested that exhausted officials were \nmore likely to make errors in fulfilling the ballot requests. Indeed, some voters \nreported receiving multiple ballots, while one couple reported receiving empty \nenvelopes without a ballot. Another voter did not receive a ballot until after the \nelection because it had been mailed without a street name and had been returned \nto the clerk’s office as undeliverable.  \n \n56 Scott Bauer & Nicholas Riccardi, Parties Mine Wisconsin for Clues to Voting in the Virus Era, AP NEWS (Apr. \n14, 2020), available at https://apnews.com/99f183ea43fd558e08393d2b064bb801.   \n57 Wis.

Defendants were aware of “potential delays in mail delivery” by \nthe United States Postal Service (“USPS”) as early as March 18, and, although \nDefendants sought to stay in touch with USPS to learn about delays and \n“encouraged clerks to communicate and coordinate with local post offices,” this \nresponse was insufficient.60 \n85.  The problems turned out to be overwhelming. In Milwaukee, numerous voters \nnever received an absentee ballot even though their ballots had been issued two weeks before the \nelection. In the week leading up to the election, Fox Point Village Hall received returns from \nUSPS of 100 to 150 undelivered absentee ballots per day, with officials making at least seven \ntrips to the post office to re-mail the undelivered ballots.61 On the morning of the election, \nofficials received a plastic mail bin containing 175 absentee ballots that appeared to have never \nbeen sent to voters, including several ballots intended for a different municipality.62 The day \nafter the election, a postal worker discovered three containers of undelivered absentee ballots \nintended for voters in Oshkosh and Appleton.63 \n86.  Defendants failed to ensure a uniform appropriate response to these challenges, \nand as a result, voters’ ability to cast a ballot that would be counted varied widely and arbitrarily, \ndepending on the location of the residential address at which they were registered to vote.

All of this makes clear that Defendants failed to ensure that all registered voters \nwho timely requested absentee ballots received them in time to participate in the April 7 election.  \nC.  Defendants’ Failure to Make Adequate Provisions for Voters to Return Absentee Ballots \nDisenfranchised Voters \n88.  Wisconsin law provides that absentee ballots must be “delivered to the polling \nplace no later than 8 p.m. on election day.” Wis. Stat. § 6.87(6). This means that absentee ballots \nmust be physically received by that time in order to count.  \n89.  With respect to the April 7 election, this Court’s Order enjoined “the enforcement \nof the requirement under Wis. Stat. § 6.87(6) that absentee ballots must be received by 8:00 p.m. \non election day to be counted and extend[ed] the deadline for receipt of absentee ballots to 4:00 \np.m. on April 13, 2020.” Democratic Nat’l Comm. v.

On April 6, the U.S. \nSupreme Court partially stayed that injunction, requiring that “a voter’s absentee ballot must be \neither (i) postmarked by election day, April 7, 2020, and received by April 13, 2020, at 4:00 \np.m., or (ii) hand-delivered as provided under state law by April 7, 2020, at 8:00 p.m.” \nRepublican Nat’l Comm. v.

More than 100,000 absentee ballots were received in the extended window—\nnamely, after April 7 and before April 13.65 \n91.  For many voters, including Plaintiffs Swenson and Nelson, personally delivering \na ballot to the municipal clerk, as anticipated by Wis. Stat. § 6.86(6), was not an option due to \nthe need to maintain social distance to preserve their health. Defendants had acknowledged that \nUSPS was experiencing significant delay issues as early as March 18. However, they nonetheless \nfailed to ensure that the many voters seeking and receiving absentee ballots in the weeks before \nthe election would be able to return them so that their votes could be counted. \n92.  For example, Defendants failed to require that municipalities establish secure \ndrop boxes so that voters could return absentee ballots while maintaining social distancing and \nwithout relying on USPS. Defendant Wolfe issued a memorandum on March 31 that identified \ndrop boxes as an option, but it did not require or even recommend that option.66 \n93.  This failure presented particular difficulties after the Supreme Court’s April 6 \ndecision requiring either that ballots be postmarked by 8 p.m. on April 7 or that they be hand-\ndelivered by that time. Republican Nat’l Comm., 140 S. Ct. at 1208.  \n94.  Most significantly, Defendants failed to take action to ensure that validly cast \nabsentee ballots without a postmark would be counted. Some voters who responded to this \nCourt’s decision by placing their ballots in the mail on April 7, before the deadline, were \nnonetheless disenfranchised because no postmark appeared on their ballot — a fact entirely \nbeyond the control of those voters. The Madison City Clerk reported several thousand ballots \n \n65 Richard Pildes, How Many Absentee Ballots in WI Came In on Time Because of the Court Decision to Extend the \nReceipt Deadline?, ELECTION LAW BLOG (Apr. 15, 2020), available at https://electionlawblog.org/?p=110746. \n66 Wis.

Milwaukee, Greenfield, Manitowoc, Fitchburg, and Sister Bay also received \nballots without postmarks. Clerks in Luxembourg and Elm Grove reported ballot envelopes with \npostmarks so light that the date on them was unreadable.  \n95.  Defendants failed to promulgate rules or issue guidance to ensure uniform, \nappropriate treatment of ballots without a postmark that arrived on April 8, the day after the \nelection, be counted, even though the president of the Wisconsin State Association of Letter \nCarriers confirmed that ballots received on April 8 had “almost certainly” been mailed by April \n7.67 \nD. Defendants’ Enforcement of Wis. Stat. § 6.87(2)’s Witness Requirement Disenfranchised \nVoters at High Risk From COVID-19  \n \n96.  As to voters at elevated risk for COVID-19, including elderly and \nimmunocompromised voters, Wisconsin’s absentee ballot-witnessing requirement effectively \ndenied citizens the right to vote.  \n97.  Under Wisconsin law, absentee ballots must be witnessed and signed by another \nadult citizen who is not a candidate on the ballot. Wis. Stat. § 6.87(4). For elderly and \nimmunocompromised voters, including Plaintiff Swenson, in-person voting was not an option \nbecause of the infection risk presented by contact with other people. But absentee voting also \npresented a risk to the health to these voters because of the requirement that an adult citizen \nwitness them sign the ballot.  \n \n67 Riley Vetterkind, Elections Commission Deadlocks Over Whether to Count Ballots Without Postmarks, WIS. \nSTATE JOURNAL (Apr. 11, 2020), available at https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections-\ncommission-deadlocks-over-whether-to-count-ballots-without-postmarks/article_74e0285c-76d7-5471-a82e-\n144b78609f48.html.  \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 32 of 71\n98.  In Wisconsin, the envelopes in which absentee ballots are returned must include \nthe following language in the “Certification of Voter” box: \nI certify that I exhibited the enclosed ballot unmarked to the witness, that I then in (his)(her) \npresence and in the presence of no other person marked the ballot and enclosed and sealed \nthe same in this envelope in such a manner that no one but myself and any person rendering \nassistance under s. 6.87(5), Wis. Stats., if I requested assistance, could know how I voted. \n \nWis. Stat. § 6.87(2).  \nThe absentee ballot witness is required to certify to the following language:  \nI, the undersigned witness, subject to the penalties of s. 12.60 (1)(b), Wis. Stats., for false \nstatements, certify that I am an adult U.S. citizen and that the above statements are true and \nthe voting procedure was executed as there stated. I am not a candidate for any office on \nthe enclosed ballot (except in the case of an incumbent municipal clerk). I did not solicit \nor advise the elector to vote for or against any candidate or measure. \n \nId. Defendants have promulgated a form envelope for absentee ballots that contains these \ncertifications and provides space for the relevant signatures and witness address information.  \n99.  Defendants failed to take action to ensure that immunocompromised voters could \nsuccessfully comply with this requirement. Defendant Wolfe issued a memorandum declaring \nthat there were “no exemptions in the law for the witness requirement.”68 Although the \nmemorandum suggested some ways voters might comply with the requirements while \nmaintaining a physical quarantine, Plaintiff Swenson did not believe that she could plausibly use \nthem to keep herself safe and cast a ballot.  \n100.  This Court recognized that the mechanisms were insufficient at least as applied to \ncertain populations, “in particular those who are immunocompromised or elderly.” Democratic \nNat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann, No. 20-CV-249-WMC, ___ F.Supp.3d ___, 2020 WL 1638374, at \n*2- (W.D. Wis. Apr. 2, 2020). This Court’s Order enjoined “the enforcement of Wis. Stat. \n \n68 Wis. Elections Commission, “Absentee Witness Signature Requirement Guidance COVID-19” (Mar. 29, 2020), \navailable at https://elections.wi.gov/node/6790. \n31 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 33 of 71\n§ 6.87(2) as to absentee voters who have provided a written affirmation or other statement that \nthey were unable to safely obtain a witness certification despite reasonable efforts to do so, \nprovided that the ballots are otherwise valid.” Id.  \n101.  The following day, April 3, 2020, the Seventh Circuit stayed enforcement of this \naspect of the injunction. Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Bostelmann, Nos. 20-1538, 1539, 1545, \n1546, Order (7th Cir. Apr. 3, 2020). \n102.  In response, Defendants adopted a rule that disenfranchised Plaintiff Swenson and \nother voters who had complied fully with then-operative law. On April 5, 2020, almost two days \nafter the Commission’s initial advisory notice on the topic, Defendants concluded that “[e]ach \nabsentee ballot for this election must have the required witness signature and address in order to \nbe counted, including ballots that were returned when this Court’s original order was in effect for \napproximately 24 hours.”69  \n103.  Defendants’ action invalidated ballots—like that of Plaintiff Swenson—that \ncomplied at the time they were submitted with this Court’s then-valid order and Commission \nguidelines. The only option that Defendants presented for voters who had cast these ballots was \nto present a witness to election officials in person—defeating both social distancing and the \nentire purpose of absentee voting.  \nE.  Defendants Failed to Safeguard the Availability of In-Person Absentee Voting \n104.  Defendants failed to take action to ensure adequate opportunities for in-person \nabsentee voting (also known as “early voting”) throughout the state. In-person absentee voting \nallows voters to apply for and obtain an absentee ballot in person, and then to complete and cast \nthe ballot immediately. This increasingly popular method of voting is particularly important \n \n69 Wis. Elections Commission, “Updated Absentee Witness Signature Requirement Guidance - COVID-19” (Apr. 5, \n2020), available at https://elections.wi.gov/node/6816.  \n32 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 34 of 71\nduring the pandemic because it accommodates voters who are unable to obtain a mail-in absentee \nballot for a variety of reasons, such as lack of ready access to the online application system, a \ntransient mailing address, homelessness, and other difficulties. It also alleviates the burden on \nelection day voting by spreading out the period of in-person voting and allowing those voters \nwho prefer to vote in-person—perhaps because they do not trust the mail to deliver or return \ntheir ballot—to do so at uncrowded, safer locations at a more convenient time.  \n105.  In-person absentee voting can also be conducted on a “drive through” basis, \nallowing voters to obtain and cast a ballot while minimizing contact with other people or shared \nsurfaces. \n106.  During the April 7 election period, Defendants failed to take action to ensure \nadequate in-person absentee voting opportunities, or to ensure that available opportunities were \nproperly publicized. For example, all three of the City of Milwaukee’s in-person absentee voting \nlocations abruptly closed on March 23, 2020, following an announcement the previous day. The \ncity subsequently reopened one early voting site downtown but made it available only as a drive-\nthrough, thereby limiting it to those voters with access to a car. These voting changes were \npoorly publicized, leaving many voters confused or simply unaware of early voting options in \nthe city. Moreover, the closure of early voting locations outside of downtown disproportionately \naffected the ability of residents of low-income and predominantly Black and Latino \nneighborhoods to vote. \n107.  Similarly, in Green Bay, in-person absentee voting opportunities were severely \nlimited. In-person absentee voting was confined to a single site that was only open on ten \nweekdays leading up to the election. On eight of those ten days, voting was limited to four \nmidday hours. Capacity was further limited during in order to permit social distancing.  \n33 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 35 of 71\n108.  More broadly, opportunities for in-person absentee voting varied dramatically \nacross the state in terms of the number of locations, hours, and manner of voting (i.e., drive \nthrough vs. walk in). These options were also generally poorly publicized. Defendants’ actions \nand inaction with respect to in-person absentee voting thus deprived voters of a safer alternative \nto in-person election day voting and put additional pressure on the mail-in absentee system that \nfailed so many voters.  \n109.  For the upcoming August and November elections, Wisconsin law required \nmunicipalities to designate locations for in-person absentee voting by June 11, 2020. Wis. Stat. \n§ 6.855(1). Unless this provision is enjoined, Defendants and municipalities will not have the \nflexibility necessary to provide sufficient and safe in-person absentee voting opportunities \nbecause of the early cut-off for designating polling locations. \nF.  Defendants Failed to Ensure An Adequate Number of Election Day Polling Places  \n110.  Defendants failed to take action to ensure that adequate in-person voting locations \nwould be available to all voters around the state. As a result, in some jurisdictions a high \nproportion of polling places did not open, and voters who sought to vote in-person—whether \nbecause they had not received an absentee ballot or because they had always intended to vote in \nperson—faced hurdles to casting a ballot.  \n111.  Wisconsin law requires that “[p]olling places shall be established for each \nelection at least 30 days before the election.” Wis. Stat. § 5.25(3).  \n112.  Each of these polling places “shall be accessible to all individuals with \ndisabilities,” and Defendants are charged with the responsibility to ensure that voting systems at \nthese polling places allow voters with disabilities to vote privately and independently. Id. \n§ 5.25(4)(a). \n34 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 36 of 71\n113.  Voters with disabilities who require the use of assistive technology available to \nthem at polling places have no option to avoid in-person voting. Many other voters require in-\nperson voting options if the online registration system fails or they do not receive a requested \nabsentee ballot on time. Still others vote in person because of the symbolic significance of voting \nat a polling place on election day.  \n114.  Defendants failed to ensure that Wisconsin voters could safely exercise the right \nto vote, including by ensuring an adequate numbers of poll workers—referred to as election \ninspectors by Wisconsin statute—available to operate the number of polling places that would \nenable safe and uncrowded voting.  \n115.  Almost 60 percent of Wisconsin municipalities reported a shortage of poll \nworkers ahead of the April 7 election as volunteers sought to protect themselves against COVID-\n19. These staffing shortages were especially acute because many older poll workers were \nunwilling to risk their health. According to a survey conducted by Defendants prior to the \nelection, 111 voting jurisdictions in Wisconsin believed they would not have enough workers to \nopen even one polling place on election day, and 126 additional jurisdictions thought they did \nnot have enough workers to open “all desired polling places.”70  \n116.  These massive anticipated poll worker shortages led to unprecedented reductions \nin the number of polling locations in some jurisdictions. Milwaukee faced the most closures of \nany city, opening just 5 of its 180 polling sites. While the city usually has 2,000 election \n \n70 Wis.

One news report noted that some communities with just a \ntenth of Milwaukee’s population had more polling sites open.71  \n117.  Although the Governor eventually mobilized the National Guard to work at the \npolls, many municipalities were not aware of that option until after they had announced poll \nclosures. City of Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Neil Albrecht, who made \na request for National Guard assistance months earlier, said that he learned about the Governor’s \ndecision through media reports.72 Albrecht said that if he had known about the assistance, he \ncould have opened more polling locations in Milwaukee, but it was “too little too late” right \nbefore the election.73 In any event, according to a survey conducted by Defendants, only 2,400 \nNational Guard members were available to address the 7,000 person shortage in poll workers.74  \n118.  As a result, the 19,000 Milwaukee voters who voted in person encountered wait \ntimes of up to two-and-a-half hours. Plaintiff McCurtis waited in line to vote at Washington High \nSchool for more than two hours. When the polls were set to close at 8:00 p.m., hundreds of \nMilwaukee voters were still waiting in line, Plaintiff McCurtis among them.  \n119.  Milwaukee had offered drive-up in-person absentee voting in the days leading up \nto the election, but on the last day it was possible to vote in that manner, lines of cars stretched \nfor blocks downtown and the wait lasted hours.75  \n \n71 Corrinne Hess & Megan Hart, Wisconsin Polls Close But Hundreds Of Voters Remain In Line, WIS.

That Milwaukee was so hard hit by these issues is particularly troubling because \nMilwaukee is home to 69.4% of Wisconsin’s Black population76—meaning that Black \nWisconsin voters were disproportionately likely to be affected by polling place closures. \n121.   In Green Bay, which opened just two of its 31 polling sites because just 17 of its \n270 usual poll workers were able or willing to work,77 voters faced wait times of up to four \nhours.78 In Waukesha, which has a population of 70,000, just one polling location out of the \nusual 15 was open.  \n122.  Defendants’ failures to ensure safe access to polling places on election day also \nresulted in arbitrary disparities, in which whether a voter had access to safe voting options \ndepended on where that voter lives. For example, in stark contrast to Milwaukee and Green Bay, \nin Madison, 66 out of 92 polling sites were open. Madison also began offering curbside voting as \nearly as Friday, April 1 to high-risk voters. While the voting process was altered, it nonetheless \nproceeded smoothly. Similarly, in some rural counties across Wisconsin, voting went more \nsmoothly, without the same extended wait times. \n123.  Nearly a month before the April 7 election, Defendant Wolfe acknowledged that \npoll worker shortages were likely to be a problem, but she did not take action sufficient to \nremedy the problem. While she provided several recruiting suggestions and instructed clerks to \ncontact the Commission if they were experiencing “significant poll worker shortages,” the \n \n76 Wis.

Defendants’ failure to take action here had a particularly significant effect \nbecause underlying legal requirements made it extremely unlikely that municipalities could solve \ntheir poll-worker problems on their own. Wisconsin statutes provide that each election official, \nincluding each inspector, must be “a qualified elector of a county in which the municipality \nwhere the official serves is located.” Wis. Stat. § 7.30(2). The county-residence requirement \nforbids recruiting inspectors from other parts of the state. This restriction needlessly makes it \nmore difficult for Defendants to address poll worker shortages, which will recur during the \nupcoming elections. \n125.  This statute also means that municipalities within the same county can draw from \nthe same pool of inspectors. Defendants did not attempt to facilitate, encourage, or coordinate \nsuch intra-county poll-worker sharing.  \n126.  As a result, significant disparities in the availability of polling places and the \nconcomitant wait to vote persisted even within the same county. For example, while the City of \nMilwaukee experienced the numerous problems described above, other cities within Milwaukee \nCounty looked very different. In Wauwatosa, a city which borders Milwaukee with a population \nof over 46,000, polling locations were largely empty, and in Germantown, with a population of \njust less than 20,000, there were no lines at all during the day of the election.80 \n \n79 Wis.

Defendants’ failures with respect to polling place locations and poll workers led \nto a situation in which voters in some Wisconsin jurisdictions—but not others—were forced to \nlocate an unfamiliar polling place to cast a ballot in person and, in some cases, to wait in very \nlong lines to cast a ballot in person, or to forgo voting altogether. \nG. Defendants’ Failure to Ensure Safe In-Person Voting Resulted in Widespread Voter \nIntimidation \n  \n128.  In conducting an election during a pandemic, Defendants failed to ensure that in-\nperson voting was safe in each jurisdiction around the state. As alleged above, numerous failures \nby Defendants resulted in extremely long lines at polling places. In addition, the availability of \npersonal protective equipment (PPE) for poll workers varied widely around the state. These \nfailures increased the risks that voters faced of contracting COVID-19 from a poll worker. \n129.  Milwaukee was and is the epicenter of Wisconsin’s COVID-19 pandemic, and as \nof the April 7 primary election, it accounted for over half of coronavirus cases and 81 percent of \nrelated deaths.81 As a result, the city, which is home to nearly 70 percent of the state’s Black \nresidents, was one of the most dangerous places to vote. Many Milwaukee voters reported being \nafraid to vote in person. Other voters compared voting in person on April 7 to moments in civil \nrights history when seeking to cast a ballot meant risking your life.82 Given the disparate racial \nimpact of COVID-19 on the Black community, these comparisons are especially apt. \n \n81 Ella Nilsen & Li Zhou, How Wisconsin’s Election Disenfranchised Voters, VOX (Apr. 7. 2020), available at \nhttps://www.vox.com/2020/4/7/21212053/wisconsin-election-coronavirus-disenfranchised-voters.  \n82 Christina A.

The health risk presented by these lines during COVID-19 were objectively \nintimidating to voters. As a result, some voters were actually deterred from voting, opting to stay \nhome or to leave a polling place before casting a ballot rather than wait in line and increase the \nrisk to their physical well-being and the well-being of their families. \n131.  Others, like Plaintiff McCurtis, who chose to remain in line to vote, did so in the \nface of dangerous voting conditions, risking their health in order to exercise the right to vote. \n132.  Numerous voters expressed their fear to reporters and on social media. The \nGovernor acknowledged that voters were “scared of going to the polls.”83 \n133.  Nonetheless, after the election, Defendant Wolfe claimed in her summary \nmemorandum that voters had reported to the Commission “that they felt safe in polling places \nand that there were adequate sanitation supplies.” 84 \nH. Burdens on Voters with Disabilities \n134.  The Commission’s failures also severely burdened immunocompromised voters \nas well as other voters with disabilities who require assistive technology available only at in-\nperson polling places.   \n135.  Voters who are immunocompromised are voters with disabilities during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. These voters must isolate themselves from other people in order to \nminimize the risk that they will contract COVID-19 and experience severe illness or death. \n136.  As a result, these voters with disabilities can cast only absentee ballots; in-person \nvoting is not available to them. \n \n83 Scott Bauer & Steve Peoples, Wisconsin Moves Forward with Election Despite Virus Concerns, AP NEWS (Apr. \n6, 2020), available at https://apnews.com/97db30e6564b9b5eedfc300234ea6630.  \n84 Wis.

Because Defendants failed to ensure that all voters who requested absentee ballots \nreceived them and failed to ensure that absentee voters had access to drop boxes to ensure \ndelivery of their ballots, many of these voters were disenfranchised, despite making every effort \nto cast an effective ballot. They were also disenfranchised by the witness verification \nrequirement to the extent these immunocompromised voters could not safely secure a witness to \nverify their ballot. \n138.  Some voters with disabilities, like voters who are blind, must utilize assistive \ntechnology available only at in-person polling locations in order to vote privately and \nindependently.  \n139.  Some voters fall into both of these categories—they are immunocompromised and \nrequire the use of assistive technology at an in-person polling place. These voters had no safe \nopportunity to vote privately and independently, and they were therefore disenfranchised. \n140.  For voters with disabilities who were forced to vote in person, long lines and lack \nof curbside voting at some polling locations, particularly in Green Bay, served as additional—\noften insurmountable—barriers to their ability to access the ballot. \nIV.  Absent Judicial Intervention, These Failures Are Practically Certain to Recur in \nAugust and November \n \n141.  When Defendants administer the August and November elections, the COVID-19 \npandemic will be ongoing. As a result, regardless of the precise circumstances of the pandemic \non those election days, the demand for online registration and absentee voting will remain \nelevated, and safety measures to protect in-person voters will remain vital. However, as the April \n7 election showed, Defendants do not have policies or other measures in place to ensure safe \nvoting in the upcoming August and November elections.  \nA. The Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic \n41 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 43 of 71\n142.  As of the time of this filing, there have been 23,454 cases reported in Wisconsin \nand 712 deaths.85  \n143.  As of this filing, approximately 279 new cases are diagnosed each day in \nWisconsin, as measured by the seven-day average.86 The rate of COVID-19 confirmed cases in \nmetropolitan areas continues to grow. And some metropolitan areas are seeing continually \nincreasing growth rates.87 It is not yet clear whether Wisconsin has reached the peak of this \ninitial wave of infections.88 \n144.  It is unlikely that a vaccine will be available until at least 2021,89 and until then, \nthe country will need to continue to take precautions to minimize the spread of COVID-19.90 \n145.  Experts predict that there will be multiple peaks in Wisconsin, with their timing \ntied directly to the duration of the Safer At Home Order and the availability of testing.91 \n146.  According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and \nInfectious Diseases, a second round of COVID-19 cases in the United States is “inevitable” in \nthe fall.92 \n \n85 Wis.

The Commission is scheduled to conduct two more elections in 2020: the August \n11, 2020 partisan primary and the November 3, 2020 general election. On each of these dates, it \nis overwhelmingly likely that COVID-19 transmission will continue in Wisconsin, that no \nvaccine will exist, and that many voters will accordingly retain an objectively reasonable fear of \nthe risk to their physical safety presented by traditional in-person voting.  \nB.  Turnout in November Will Exacerbate Problems \n148.  If Defendants’ election system was unable to ensure that voters in April were \nenfranchised during the COVID-19 pandemic, it will be that much more inadequate in November \nabsent significant changes. Indeed, “[e]xperts worry that poll worker shortages, long lines and \nother delays in processing requests for absentee ballots will only get worse in November, when \nthere will be more voters.”93 \n149.  Nearly three million Wisconsin voters cast ballots in the 2016 presidential \nelection.94 With experts predicting higher than usual voter turnout nationwide this November,95 \nthe number of Wisconsin voters who seek to participate in the presidential election is likely to be \nmore than twice the 1.5 million voters who participated in the April 7 election.96 As Defendants \nnote, there are particular challenges in November presidential elections, which “see a greater \n \n93 Sam Levine, ‘We’re going to have a catastrophe’: US faces November election fiasco, The Guardian (June 12, \n2020), available at https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/12/us-presidential-election-fiasco-voter-\nsuppression. \n94 Election 2016: Wisconsin Results, N.Y.

If the proportion of voters seeking to cast absentee ballots in the November \nelection is similar to the proportion in April, Defendants’ system would need to be equipped to \ndistribute and receive back more than twice as many absentee ballots as it did in April, and it \nwould need to be able to ensure that more than twice as many voters could vote safely in person. \nDefendants estimate that if voting patterns from April hold, Wisconsin could receive “more than \n1.8 million requests for absentee ballots by mail.”98 If a lower proportion of voters seeks to vote \nabsentee, then that system would need to be able to ensure that any even larger number of voters \ncould vote safely, and free from intimidating conditions, in person.  \n151.  Defendants must equip municipal and county clerks to successfully count this \nunprecedented number of absentee ballots. \n152.  Larger turnout will also exacerbate the poll worker shortages experienced during \nthe April 7 election. Across the country, poll worker shortages have continued to frustrate \nelections,99 and experts fear that such shortages will only grow worse in the November General \nElection—particularly since elderly poll workers who often run elections will fear contracting \nCOVID-19.100 \n \n97 Wis.

Unless Defendants take swift actions, the numerous irregularities that plagued the \nApril 7 election will disenfranchise countless more voters during the impending August and \nNovember elections as well. \nC.  Defendants Have Not Taken Steps Sufficient to Correct the Ongoing Problems \nwith Wisconsin Elections under COVID-19 \n \n154.  While Defendants have announced some actions that they plan to take to improve \nupon the administration of the April 7 election, these actions are insufficient to ensure that \nsubsequent elections during the pandemic will protect voters’ rights under the Constitution and \nfederal statutes.  \n155.  First, Defendants have not taken sufficient action to ensure that MyVote will be \nable to support the large-scale online registration and at-home absentee voting which will \ncontinue to be necessary during the impending August and November elections. In her April 7 \nElection Summary Memorandum, Defendant Wolfe wrote on this topic that staff would “work to \naugment voter workflows for online voter registration and absentee ballot requests.”101 The \nmemorandum did not address outages or mention securing additional capacity.  In her May 20 \nCARES Grant Planning Memorandum, Defendant Wolfe again did not make specific mention of \nadding additional capacity, although she did acknowledge the need for “software development \nand consultation” and “system load testing.102 \n156.  Absent significant improvement of computer-system infrastructure, Wisconsin \nvoters will not have adequate access to online absentee ballots or online registration during the \nAugust and November elections.  \n \n101 Wis. Elections Commission, “Summary of April 7, 2020 Election” (April 18, 2020), available at \nhttps://elections.wi.gov/sites/elections.wi.gov/files/2020-\n04/April%207%20Election%20Summary%20and%20Next%20Steps.pdf.    \n102 Wis. Elections Commission, “CARES Grant Planning” (May 20, 2020), available at \nhttps://elections.wi.gov/sites/elections.wi.gov/files/2020-05/May%2020%2C%202020.Final_.pdf. \n45 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 47 of 71\n157.  Second, Defendants have failed to take sufficient action to ensure that voters who \ntimely request absentee ballots for subsequent 2020 elections will receive those ballots in time to \nparticipate in those elections. Although the Elections Commission now intends to mail absentee \nballot applications to nearly all registered voters who have not already requested one, the April 7 \nelection exposed failures at almost every juncture in the voting process. These failures will not \nbe corrected as a result of this one action. For example, on the topic of allowing voters to track \nwhere their absentee ballot is in the process,  Defendant Wolfe’s memorandum stated that staff \n“hopes to incorporate intelligent mail barcodes into the absentee process and incorporate that \ninformation into the MyVote system,” but offers no concrete commitment or contingency plan. \n(emphasis added).103  Similarly, in a May 20 memorandum, Defendants mention intelligent mail \nbarcodes as a “potential direction,” without any assurances that any system will ultimately be \nimplemented.104  \n158.  Third, Defendants have failed to take sufficient action to ensure that all voters \nwho receive absentee ballots can cast their ballots and have them counted.  \n159.  The statutory deadline for requesting an absentee ballot is just five days before \nelection day, Wis. Stat. § 6.86(1)(b), and clerks can wait up to one business day before mailing a \nballot. Wis. Stat. § 7.15(cm). Defendants have acknowledged that postal mail can take up to a \nweek to transport a ballot both from clerk to voter and voter back to clerk, for a total of two \nweeks. As a result, some voters who timely request absentee ballots, receive them, cast their \nvotes, and timely return them by postal mail will still be disenfranchised. Nonetheless, \n \n103 Id. \n104  Wis. Elections Commission, “April 7, 2020 Absentee Voting Report” (May 15, 2020), available at \nhttps://elections.wi.gov/sites/elections.wi.gov/files/2020-05/May%2020%2C%202020.Final_.pdf. \n46 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 48 of 71\nDefendants have failed to require or facilitate the availability of secure drop boxes in each \nmunicipality for the socially distant return of absentee ballots.  \n160.  Even with drop boxes, absent judicial relief ensuring that mailed absentee ballots \npostmarked by election day are accepted for counting, some voters who timely request absentee \nballots will inevitably be disenfranchised again.  \n161.  Defendants have no policy or other measures in place to create any more \nworkable alternatives for voters at high risk from COVID-19, especially immunocompromised \nvoters, who cannot safely comply with the witnessing requirements for absentee ballots set forth \nin Wis. Stat. § 6.87(2). \n162.  Fourth, Defendants have no policy or other measures in place to ensure that \nvoters statewide have sufficient access to in-person absentee voting opportunities, including both \nwalk-in early voting and drive-through early voting. In-person absentee voting is essential for \nthose who are unable, for a variety of reasons, to obtain an absentee ballot by mail or through the \nonline system. It is also essential in order to spread out in-person voting over a longer period, \nthereby reducing the likelihood that election day polling locations will be overwhelmed and \nallowing better compliance with safety precautions against spread of coronavirus. Additionally, \nWisconsin law requires municipalities to designate locations for in-person absentee voting by \nJune 11, 2020.  Wis. Stat. § 6.855(1). Unless this provision is enjoined, Defendants and \nmunicipalities will not have the flexibility necessary to provide sufficient and safe in-person \nabsentee voting opportunities because of the early cut-off for designating polling locations. \n163.  Fifth, Defendants, although recognizing the critical shortage of poll workers that \nled to widespread polling place closures, have no policy or other measure in place to facilitate \nrecruitment of poll workers or provide assistance in facilitating the equitable distribution of poll \n47 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 49 of 71\nworkers within counties. Instead, Defendant Wolfe’s memorandum stated that the Commission \nwould (1) “work with” and “survey” jurisdictions to keep abreast of their shortages; (2) maintain \na ticket for personnel with the State Emergency Operations Center; and (3) develop training for \nlast-minute poll-worker certification.105  \n164.  Sixth, Defendants have failed to take adequate action to ensure that in-person \nabsentee and election day polling places will be safe during the August and November elections, \nand that voters are made aware in advance of these changes so that the failures of the April 7 \nelection do not have an intimidating effect on voters in August and November. While Defendant \nWolfe wrote that, for the August and November elections, Commission staff would assist \njurisdictions in finding sanitary supplies and masks and gloves for poll workers, Defendants have \ntaken no action to require voters or poll workers to wear masks or take other precautions to \nensure that voters feel secure in appearing at polling places.106 \n165.  Seventh, Defendants have failed to take adequate steps to ensure that voters with \ndisabilities who require the use of assistive technology to vote privately and independently will \nhave both the option to vote safely in person and the option to use an at-home accessible voting \noption. \n166.  Eighth, Defendants have not put forward a plan to ensure that all members of the \nvoting public have the information they need to register online, request an absentee ballot, and \nsuccessfully return that ballot, so that no one at high risk for COVID-19 and thus unable to vote \nin person is disenfranchised in August or November. They have not put forward a plan to ensure \nthat voters on the wrong side of the digital divide have the information they need to register and \nrequest an absentee ballot. Wisconsin voters on the wrong side of the digital divide—who lack \n \n105 Wis. Elections Commission, “Summary of April 7, 2020 Election.”  \n106 Id.  \n48 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 50 of 71\ninternet access or familiarity with online resources—are particularly likely to be disenfranchised \nbecause they will not be able to access MyVote in order to easily register and request an absentee \nballot. Black, Latino, elderly, and rural voters are disproportionately likely to be on the wrong \nside of the digital divide.107  \n167.  Defendants refer only generally to “voter outreach programs.”108  This is \ninsufficient for the growing demand and need for a comprehensive voter education effort.  \n168.  As a result of these failures, the harms experienced by the voters of Wisconsin, \nand by Plaintiffs in particular, are overwhelmingly likely to recur in the August and November \nelections absent relief here. \nV.  Plaintiffs’ Injuries \nJill Swenson \n169.  Plaintiff Jill Swenson is sixty-one years old and has, among other serious \nailments, early stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”), an inflammatory lung \ndisease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. Ms. Swenson is in one of the highest-risk \npopulations for COVID-19.  \n170.  Ms. Swenson is a regular voter and makes it her usual practice to vote in person \non election day. This year, because of her age and health, Ms. Swenson felt unsafe voting in \nperson at her polling location or returning an absentee ballot in person at Appleton City Hall. \n \n107 U.S. Census Bureau, “The Digital Divide: Percentage of Households by Broadband Internet Subscription, \nComputer Type, Race and Hispanic Origin” (Sept. 11, 2017), available at \nhttps://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2017/comm/internet.html; Andrew Perrin, Digital Gap Between Rural \nand Nonrural America Persists, PEW RESEARCH CENTER (May 31, 2019), available at \nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/31/digital-gap-between-rural-and-nonrural-america-persists/; \nAndrea Caumont, Who’s not online? 5 factors tied to the digital divide, PEW RESEARCH CENTER (May 31, 2019), \navailable at https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/11/08/whos-not-online-5-factors-tied-to-the-digital-\ndivide/. \n108 Wis.

It arrived about a week later.  \n171.  By March 11, Ms. Swenson had begun to self-quarantine. She did not leave her \nhome or interact with others in person. Ms. Swenson was unable to find anyone who could safely \nwitness her ballot. Her friends and neighbors were either failing to practice social distancing, still \nworking at essential businesses, or recently recovered from possible COVID-19. \n172.  On March 31, Ms. Swenson contacted the Commission for advice on how to \nsubmit her ballot. The Commission told Ms. Swenson to have someone come to her home and \nhand the ballot back-and-forth through a window or door. It also pointed her to a website with \nguidance suggesting that voters leave their ballot outside for day before a witness handles the \nballot, and then wait another day before handling the witnessed ballot. Ms. Swenson did not feel \nsafe inviting anyone over. The Commission also told Ms. Swenson she could bring her absentee \nballot to Appleton City Hall, but she felt unsafe doing so because interacting with staff and other \nmembers of the public could cause her serious illness or death.  \n173.  When Ms. Swenson learned about the Court’s April 2 order allowing voters to \nsubmit un-witnessed absentee ballots by mail, she completed and mailed her absentee ballot \nimmediately, with a note stating that she lived alone, feared contracting COVID-19, and could \nnot find a witness, and that she was submitting an unwitnessed ballot in conformity with the \ncourt order. Later that day, the Seventh Circuit stayed enforcement of that Order. Several days \nlater, Ms. Swenson learned through news reports that her ballot would be invalidated and that her \nvote would not count. She was deeply upset; she cherishes exercising her right to vote.  \n50 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 52 of 71\n174.  Ms. Swenson was not aware of any opportunity to cure the defect with her \nabsentee ballot and knew that attempting to vote in person after submitting even an invalidated \nabsentee ballot would be unlawful.  \n175.  If the witnessing requirement remains in effect during the August and November \nelections, Ms. Swenson will not have a safe way to vote—and to ensure her vote is counted—in \nWisconsin’s August and November elections.  \nMelody McCurtis \n176.  Plaintiff Melody McCurtis lives in the Sherman Park neighborhood of \nMilwaukee, Wisconsin. She is a lifelong voter who votes in almost every election, large or small. \nShe lives in a multi-generational household that includes her mother, who has hypertension, high \nblood pressure, and an enlarged heart, putting her at increased risk of COVID-19 complications. \nAs a community organizer, Ms. McCurtis was aware of the disparate impact that COVID-19 had \nhad on the Black community in Milwaukee. Her polling location at Washington High School is \nlocated in Sherman Park, the epicenter of the COVID-19 crisis in the Black community. \nKnowing all this, Ms. McCurtis requested an absentee ballot on March 22.  \n177.  Ms. McCurtis’s ballot never arrived. On April 6, Ms. McCurtis called the Clerk’s \noffice, but there was no answer. She called again on April 7, and was told that she had no choice \nbut to vote in person. Although Ms. McCurtis’s mother was afraid of Ms. McCurtis voting in \nperson, Ms. McCurtis joined the blocks-long line outside of Washington High School around \n6:30 p.m. on election day. She cast her ballot at 9:09 p.m.  \n178.  During the wait of more than two-and-a-half hours, Ms. McCurtis experienced \nintimidation, fear, and frustration. Voters in line were not able to practice social distancing due to \nthe large number of people in line and the failure of election officials to enforce the practice. The \n51 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 53 of 71\npolling location did not provide PPE for voters, and it had run out of sanitary pens. Ms. McCurtis \nobserved seniors and individuals with disabilities waiting in the long line. In addition, there was \na noticeably high police presence, including the National Guard. Yet despite the high police \npresence, no one stopped a young woman who spent over an hour dancing along the line of \nvoters, entering voters’ personal space and creating a health risk for those in line.  \n179.  As she waited in line, Ms. McCurtis observed a member of the National Guard \napproach and speak to a female voter. The woman stepped out of line and left. That National \nGuard member then approached Ms. McCurtis and said, “You know this will be a two-hour wait, \nright?” The National Guard member appeared to be discouraging voters from remaining in line. \nMs. McCurtis asked him to stop speaking to voters and refrain from discouraging voters from \nremaining in line, but she was not able to monitor whether he did so. This experience deeply hurt \nMs. McCurtis, who is a community organizer focused on encouraging Metcalfe Park community \nmembers to vote.  \n180.  Ms. McCurtis still feels the traumatic impact of being subjected to such an unsafe \nvoting experience; the heavy police presence and long line of Black voters reminded her of the \nviolence surrounding earlier generations of Black Americans’ efforts to vote. On April 7, she felt \nafraid for her health and physical safety, and the health and physical safety of her community. In \nlight of her experience in April, Ms. McCurtis reasonably fears that she will not be able to \nexercise her right to vote in August and November without exposing herself, and therefore her \nmother, to significant health risks.  \nMaria Nelson \n181.  Plaintiff Maria Nelson has breast cancer and is currently undergoing \nchemotherapy treatment. She is also a regular voter and enjoys taking her two young children to \n52 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 54 of 71\nthe polls to teach them the importance of voting. Because of highly publicized reports explaining \nthat immunocompromised individuals are most at risk from the COVID-19 pandemic, Ms. \nNelson felt unsafe voting in person at her polling location on election day. Because of this, on \nMarch 31, she timely emailed the Appleton City Clerk and requested an absentee ballot. She \nreceived a call in response from the Clerk’s office stating that the Clerk’s office would be \nsending an absentee ballot by mail. Ms. Nelson agreed, assuming that the Clerk’s office was \naccurately representing its ability to send her a timely ballot.  \n182.  Ms. Nelson’s absentee ballot did not arrive before April 7. Instead, it arrived on \nApril 8, too late to be used. On election day, Ms. Nelson was not able to vote in person because \nshe felt too unsafe and was not willing to risk her life by voting in person. As a result, Mrs. \nNelson was disenfranchised.  \n183.  If Defendants do not remedy the defects in the in-person and absentee voting \nsystems, Ms. Nelson will not have a safe and reliable way to cast a ballot in the August and \nNovember elections. \nBlack Leaders Organizing for Communities \n184.  Plaintiff BLOC mobilizes Black Wisconsinites to participate at all levels of \ngovernment and encourages communities of color to fulfill their potential for electoral impact in \nMilwaukee. As part of its work, BLOC educates the Black community in Milwaukee about voter \neligibility rules, voter ID requirements, the importance of voting, and the opportunity for early \nvoting. BLOC primarily operates as a robust field program. For example, BLOC knocked on \napproximately 227,000 doors in Milwaukee in 2018, encouraging Black residents to engage in \ncivic participation, including voting. Ahead of the April 7 election, BLOC had hired 50 \nambassadors to knock on an anticipated 44,000 doors. Each ambassador went through more than \n53 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 55 of 71\n30 hours of civics training, including training on registering voters and how to vote. Much of that \ntraining became out of date as Defendants’ policies and deadlines shifted again and again in the \ndays leading up to April 7. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, BLOC ambassadors have \nreduced capacity and are working half of their ordinary hours. BLOC is paying ambassadors for \ntheir full hours. \n185.  In light of Defendants’ failures to provide adequate and safe voting opportunities \nin the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, BLOC had to uproot its highly effective field program \nand divert significant resources to digital outreach to Black Wisconsin voters, including \nimplementing a texting and phone-banking campaign to educate voters on how to cast mail-in \nabsentee ballots. This required setting up new technological tools, and training BLOC’s \nambassadors on those tools remotely. While BLOC would inevitably had to have made changes \nto its field program in light of COVID-19, Defendants’ policies and practices significantly \nincreased that burden. As deadlines and absentee ballot requirements shifted, BLOC had to \nrepeatedly push out additional training and information to its remote staff and ensure that \nupdated messages were being sent to constituents. BLOC’s staff created graphics and social \nmedia posts for every new deadline and policy change; ordinarily, minimal new content would \nbe created, and BLOC would be able to reuse any new content. BLOC will be unable to reuse \nmost of the new content created for April.  \n186.  BLOC was also unable to fulfill its mission of encouraging Black Wisconsinites \nto vote. BLOC had to contact voters multiple times as policies changed. Each call was longer \nthan usual, as BLOC staff spent time explaining confusing online systems, helping voters scan \nidentification over the phone, and walked them through changing deadlines. Because of this, and \nbecause BLOC staff had been and continues to work reduced hours, BLOC was unable to meet \n54 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 56 of 71\nits goals for voter contacts leading up to the April 7 election (but at the same cost to BLOC). But \nfor Defendants’ failures, much of this work would have been unnecessary. Instead, BLOC would \nhave focused on traditional get-out-the-vote efforts, speaking to voters about candidates and \nissues. BLOC was not able to have those conversations with voters this year and, because of the \nnumerous barriers facing its constituents, was not able to meet its goals related to getting \nsignificant numbers of the Black community to vote.  \n187.  BLOC’s organizational planning for the summer and fall are on hold, because \nBLOC has no way of knowing what policies or deadlines will be in place for the August and \nNovember elections. Many voters with whom BLOC works did not receive an absentee ballot by \nApril 7, 2020. Others found the absentee ballot request system confusing and difficult to use. \nMany of those voters feared for their health and safety due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, \nincluding because COVID-19 has disproportionately affected the Black community. They were \ntoo afraid to vote in person on April 7. As a result, those voters were disenfranchised and unable \nto cast a ballot in the election.  \n188.  Absent relief here, many voters with whom BLOC works will be similarly \ndisenfranchised and burdened during subsequent elections. As a result, BLOC will be forced to \ncontinue to divert resources in order to attempt to enfranchise these voters, to counteract the \nuncertainty Defendants’ policies and practices are creating, and to reach the increased number of \nBlack voters facing unsafe voting conditions.  \n189.  Although BLOC has invested heavily in building community trust in the election \nsystem and building community power through civic engagement, BLOC is now faced with re-\nbuilding that trust after many of the voters with whom BLOC works were disenfranchised due to \nDefendants’ failures. This shift in programmatic focus will likely mean generating new \n55 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 57 of 71\nmessaging and outreach campaigns. The lost trust created by Defendants’ failures and the \ndisenfranchisement of BLOC’s constituents has made it harder for BLOC to achieve its mission.  \nDisability Rights Wisconsin \n190.  Plaintiff DRW’s mission is to address the issues facing, and to ensure the rights \nof, all people with disabilities in Wisconsin. DRW has a state and federal mandate to protect and \nadvocate for the rights of people with disabilities in Wisconsin, including those with \ndevelopmental disabilities, mental illness, and traumatic brain injury. As part of this mandate, \nDRW oversees self-advocacy training and other programs and services to assist people with \ndisabilities, including to secure election access, including registering to vote, accessing polling \nplaces, and casting their ballot. DRW also leads the Wisconsin Disability Vote Coalition.  \n191.  In light of Defendants’ failures to provide adequate and safe voting opportunities \nin the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, DRW had to produce numerous resources and trainings \nahead of the April 7 election that it would not have otherwise produced, at the expense of staff \ntime and DRW’s other programmatic priorities. For example, DRW organized four Zoom \nbriefings to explain the special circumstances and changing policies around the April 7 election. \nAs requirements changed, DRW had to update and rewrite resources provided to voters five to \nsix times, including its popular Election FAQ document. With each update, DRW staff had to \nspend time liaising with the Commission to make sure they were conveying accurate \ninformation. Ordinarily, DRW would have to create only a single version of these materials. \nDRW also had to attend emergency meetings of the Commission, prepare for at least two \nunplanned calls with WEC, and coordinate on an emergency basis with other Wisconsin \norganizations to ensure voters were getting accurate information.  \n56 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 58 of 71\n192.  Because of this unplanned and additional work, significant staff time was spent \nresponding to Defendants’ failures and informing DRW’s constituents about how to vote. This \nstaff time was diverted from other DRW priorities, such as creating key reference materials for \nparents of children with serious disabilities, completing federal grant reporting requirements, and \ncoordinating Wisconsin’s Mental Health Task Force. \n193.  DRW continues to have to divert resources in response to Defendants’ failures \nand in anticipation of future disenfranchisement, if policies are not changed. DRW has devoted \nsignificant staff time to organizing Zoom briefings for the May 12 election, and it is currently \ncoordinating with other Wisconsin groups on a joint voter-education plan for future elections, \nand developing a campaign to encourage voters to vote absentee. As a part of campaign \nplanning, DRW is conducting in-depth research, including interviews, on how other states \nprovide for accessible absentee voting. None of this work was previously planned, and all of it \ntakes staff time away from previously planned work and affects DRW’s ability to fulfill its \nmission.  \n194.  Many of the Wisconsinites with disabilities on whose behalf DRW advocates face \nsignificant obstacles to voting as a result of COVID-19. They will either be disenfranchised or \nexposed to heightened risk of illness if their legal rights to safely vote are not vindicated. DRW \nalso brings this suit on their behalf. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount 1: Violation of Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act \n(All Plaintiffs) \n \n195.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n196.  Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act provides that:  \n57 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 59 of 71\nNo person, whether acting under color of law or otherwise, shall intimidate, threaten, or \ncoerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any person for voting or attempting to \nvote, or intimidate, threaten, or coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any \nperson for urging or aiding any person to vote or attempt to vote, or intimidate, threaten, \nor coerce any person for exercising any powers or duties under section 10302(a), 10305, \n10306, or 10308(e) of this title or section 1973d or 1973g of Title 42. \n \n52 U.S.C. § 10307(b).  \n197.  Defendants violated Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act by failing to take \nobjectively reasonable precautions to enable Wisconsin citizens to vote free of fear of \ncontracting COVID-19. See Hicks v. Knight, Civ. No. 15,727, 10 Race Rel. L. Rep. 1507-09 \n(E.D. La. 1965) (finding that a city violated federal voting rights law when it failed to take \nreasonable measures to protect voter registration group from physical danger). \n198.  Defendants did not take objectively reasonable steps to run an absentee-voting \nprogram that guaranteed registered voters who timely requested ballots the ability to reliably and \nsafely cast their ballots from home. They did not provide municipal clerks with the resources \nnecessary to timely process an unprecedented volume of absentee ballot requests. They did not \nprovide a means of complying with the absentee ballot witness requirement that was safe and \nfeasible for voters at high risk from COVID-19. And they did not ensure that drop boxes would \nbe available for absentee voters who wanted to ensure timely receipt of their voted ballots. \n199.  Defendants did not take objectively reasonable precautions to ensure that every \nvoter had access to a safe polling site or in-person absentee voting location that allowed for \nadequate social distancing practices. They took insufficient steps to ensure, for instance, that \nthere were enough poll workers in each county to staff an adequate number of polling sites to \nforestall long lines and crowds, and they did not facilitate the equitable sharing of poll workers \nacross jurisdictions within a county. They did not require that poll workers or voters wear masks. \n58 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 60 of 71\n200.  As a result, many Wisconsin voters—even those who had timely requested \nabsentee ballots—were forced to choose between risking their physical safety to vote and \nabstaining from voting. \n201.  Defendants’ failure to take objective reasonable precautions to ensure that each \nWisconsin voter could vote free of fear of contracting COVID-19 intimidated and injured \nPlaintiffs. \n202.  Plaintiff Swenson was too intimidated by fear of contracting COVID-19 both to \nvote in person and to get a witness to sign her absentee ballot. As a result, she was \ndisenfranchised. Absent relief, she will be intimidated again in subsequent elections during the \npandemic. \n203.  Plaintiff McCurtis was intimidated and threatened by the unsafe conditions she \nencountered in voting at Washington High School in Milwaukee. Absent relief, she will \nanticipate similar conditions at polling places during subsequent elections during the pandemic, \nand thus will remain intimidated.  \n204.  Plaintiff Nelson was too intimidated by fear of contracting COVID-19 to vote in \nperson, and she did not receive her timely requested absentee ballot. As a result, she was \ndisenfranchised. Absent relief, she will be intimidated again in subsequent elections during the \npandemic. \n205.  Widespread voter intimidation has forced DRW and BLOC to divert resources \nfrom other activities in order to ensure that voters are not afraid to cast ballots in subsequent \nelections during the pandemic. \n206.  Defendants have not taken sufficient steps to remedy their failure to protect voters \nfrom intimidation during the April election. \n59 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 61 of 71\n207.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to violate Section 11(b) of \nthe Voting Rights Act. \nCount 2: Violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment  \nto the U.S. Constitution \n(Plaintiff McCurtis, Organizational Plaintiffs) \n \n208.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n209.  The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits Wisconsin from “deny[ing] to any person \nwithin its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, § 1. \n210.  “Having once granted the right to vote on equal terms, [a state] may not, by later \narbitrary and disparate treatment, value one person’s vote over that of another.” Bush v. Gore, \n531 U.S. 98, 104-105 (2000). Defendants cannot “arbitrarily deny” Wisconsinites “the right to \nvote depending on where they live.” League of Women Voters of Ohio v. Brunner, 548 F.3d 463, \n476 (6th Cir. 2008). \n211.  Defendants’ administration of the April 7 election arbitrarily advantaged voters in \nsome jurisdictions and disadvantaged those who resided in others, including especially voters in \nMilwaukee.  \n212.  Defendants failed to take sufficient action to remedy known poll worker \nshortages. They also failed to facilitate the equitable sharing of poll workers within counties, \nleading to situations in which municipalities in the same county had radically different staffing \nlevels and thus provided radically different experiences for voters. \n213.  Defendants’ arbitrary and disparate administration of the April election injured \nPlaintiff McCurtis by subjecting her, as a resident of the City of Milwaukee, to a voting system \n60 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 62 of 71\nmore dysfunctional than that experienced by Wisconsinites in many jurisdictions—who voted \nwithout waiting in line for more than two and a half hours. \n214.  Defendants’ arbitrary and disparate administration of the April election has forced \nthe Organizational Plaintiffs to divert resources from other activities in order to ensure that \nvoters in Milwaukee, Green Bay, and other municipalities that experienced severe problems in \nApril are enfranchised in subsequent elections during the pandemic. \n215.  Defendants’ actions, taken under color of law, deprive Plaintiffs of rights, \nprivileges, or immunities secured to them by the Constitution of the United States, in violation of \n42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n216.  Defendants’ actions and failures to act have subjected Plaintiffs to arbitrary \ndisparities in their ability to have their votes counted depending on where they live.  \n217.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to violate the Equal \nProtection Clause.  \nCount 3: Violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments  \nto the U.S. Constitution \n(All Plaintiffs) \n \n218.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n219.  United States citizens’ voting rights are protected by the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution. See Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983); Burdick \nv. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428 (1992). \n220.  Defendants’ actions unduly burdened Plaintiffs Swenson, McCurtis, and Nelson’s \nconstitutionally protected voting rights by forcing them to choose between exercising their rights \nto vote and their personal safety.  \n61 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 63 of 71\n221.  As a result, Defendants’ actions imposed a severe—and sometimes impossible—\nburden on Plaintiffs’ right to vote.  \n222.  Defendants’ administration of the April election in a manner that imposed severe \nburdens on voters has forced the Organizational Plaintiffs to divert resources from other \nactivities in order to ensure that voters are nonetheless enfranchised in subsequent elections \nduring the pandemic. \n223.  Defendants have no countervailing legitimate governmental purpose in forcing \nindividuals to choose between the right to vote and their safety. \n224.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to violate the First and \nFourteenth Amendments. \nCount 4: Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment  \nto the U.S. Constitution \n(Procedural Due Process) \n(Plaintiffs Swenson and Nelson, Organizational Plaintiffs) \n \n225.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n226.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the Defendants \nfrom denying any person of a protected property or liberty interest without fair process. See U.S. \nConst. Amend. XIV, § 1. At the core of these procedural protections is the right to adequate \nnotice with respect to any deprivation of a protected interest, and a fair opportunity to be heard \non the matter at a meaningful time and in meaningful manner. See Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 \nU.S. 319 (1976). \n227.  All eligible Wisconsin voters have a fundamental right to vote protected by the \nU.S. Constitution and Wisconsin law. Wis. Stat. § 6.02. All eligible Wisconsin voters also have a \nright to request and receive an absentee ballot for any reason, Wis. Stat. § 6.85, et seq., and to \n62 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 64 of 71\nhave their properly cast absentee ballots counted, Wis. Stat. §§ 6.88, 7.52. Each of these rights is \na protected liberty or property interest that triggers the fundamental procedural protections of the \nDue Process Clause. \n228.  Defendants violated Plaintiffs’ procedural rights under the Due Process Clause \nwith respect to the right to obtain an absentee ballot. Defendants violated this right by failing to \nprovide: adequate notice of the procedures by which individuals might cure any errors in a \nrequest for an absentee ballot; adequate notice that an absentee ballot would not be delivered to \nthe voter in time to cast the ballot; clear, timely, and effective procedures by which to exercise \nthe right to vote in the event an absentee ballot did not arrive in sufficient time before election \nday; and clear, timely, and effective procedures by which a voter could seek redress in the event \nof an erroneous deprivation of the right to obtain an absentee ballot. Defendants further violated \nthese rights by failing to adopt constitutionally adequate rules, directives, or similar guidance on \nthese matters statewide. \n229.  Defendants also violated Plaintiffs’ procedural rights under the Due Process \nClause with respect to the right to have absentee ballots counted. Defendants violated this right \nby failing to provide timely notice that an absentee ballot had been rejected before election \nresults are certified, including with respect to absentee ballots rejected on the grounds that the \nballot allegedly lacked necessary signatures or other details, or because of alleged problems with \nthe postmark or other evidence that the ballot was timely cast. Wis. Stat. §§ 6.88, 7.52. \nDefendants also failed to provide voters a constitutionally adequate opportunity to be heard on \nthe validity of their ballots before they were excluded from the certified election results. Id. In \norder to afford constitutionally adequate notice and a timely opportunity to be heard, state laws \n63 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 65 of 71\nthat currently forbid canvassing of absentee ballots prior to election day should be enjoined. See \nWis. Stat. §§ 6.88, 7.51–.52. \n230.  Defendants further violated Plaintiffs’ procedural rights under the Due Process \nClause by failing to provide timely, meaningful, and effective notice of changes in voting \nprotocols, procedures, and requirements precipitated by the coronavirus pandemic. Defendants’ \nfailure to communicate effective notice of such changes to the public created widespread \nconfusion in the April 7 election about how eligible voters could or could not exercise their \nfundamental right to vote. This failure resulted in Plaintiffs, like Plaintiffs Swenson and Nelson, \nlosing their fundamental right to vote and other protected interests, including the right to obtain \nand cast an absentee ballot rather than incur the health risk of going to a polling place on election \nday. Defendants have not cured those failures and have a continuing obligation under the Due \nProcess Clause to provide effective, timely notice to voters with respect to the protocols, \nprocedures, and other requirements they must satisfy in order to exercise their fundamental right \nto vote either in person or absentee. Defendants have also violated these requirements by failing \nto implement rules, directives, or similar guidance with respect to such matters statewide. \n231.  Defendants’ heavy reliance on websites, particularly MyVote Wisconsin, as a \nmeans of providing notice to voters failed to satisfy the requirements of procedural due process \nwith respect to the large number of Wisconsin residents who do not have ready access such \nmeans of communication, including those who lack necessary technical skills, those with \ndisabilities, and those who simply do not have ready access to computers or the internet. This \nfailure disproportionately affects low-income, disabled, elderly, and minority voters, and forces \nthe Organizational Plaintiffs to expend significant additional resources to carry out voter \n64 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 66 of 71\neducation, voter outreach, and get-out-the-vote activities with respect to the populations that they \neach serve.  \n232.  Defendants are not taking adequate steps to cure these violations of procedural \ndue process in the August and November elections.  \n233.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to violate procedural \nrights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause.  \nCount 5: Violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(Plaintiffs Swenson and Nelson, Organizational Plaintiffs) \n \n234.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n235.  Under Title II of the ADA, state and local governments must not impose \nrequirements on participation in public services, programs, or activities, including voting, that \nprevent individuals with disabilities from fully and equally enjoying that participation, and must \nmake reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when necessary to avoid \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12132. “Title II of the ADA requires [such \nentities] to ensure that people with disabilities have a full and equal opportunity to vote. The \nADA’s provisions apply to all aspects of voting, including voter registration, site selection, and \nthe casting of ballots, whether on Election Day or during an early voting process.”109 \n236.  Immunocompromised individuals and those who suffer a significant medical \nvulnerability that would place them at high risk of serious bodily injury or death should they \nleave the confines of their home, or should they interact with a non-member of their household, \nhave a disability within the meaning of the ADA. \n \n109 U.S. Dep’t of Justice, “The Americans with Disabilities Act and Other Federal Laws Protecting the Rights of \nVoters with Disabilities,” available at https://www.justice.gov/file/69411/download (last accessed June 18, 2020).  \n65 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 67 of 71\n237.  Defendants have failed to safeguard these individuals’ right to participate in our \ndemocracy in at least three ways.  \n238.  First, through the conduct described above, Defendants have failed to ensure that \nsuch individuals who request absentee ballots receive them, as necessary to allow them to vote, \nand to count their ballots if they are able to mail them back. Defendants must maintain a voting \nprocess that ensures those with such disabilities can register for, receive, vote, and have counted \ntheir absentee ballots.  \n239.  Second, Defendants have failed to provide reasonable accommodations to voters \nwith disabilities from the in-person witness requirements for absentee voting, Wis. Stat. \n§ 6.87(2). Many Wisconsin voters with disabilities live alone and cannot safely arrange for an in-\nperson witness. Defendants have failed to accommodate these voters by, for example, replacing \nthe witness verification requirement with a self-certification requirement. In so doing, \nDefendants have violated the ADA by denying these voters the right to participate in \nWisconsin’s voting process by reason of their disability. \n240.  Third, blind individuals and others who require the use of assistive technology \navailable only in person to vote privately and independently also have a disability within the \nmeaning of the ADA. By failing to guarantee safe access to in-person voting for these voters, \nDefendants have violated the ADA. \n241.  Defendants are not taking adequate steps to avoid these violations of the ADA. \n242.  Unless the requested relief is granted, Plaintiffs Swenson and Nelson and those \nsimilarly situated will suffer irreparable harm in that they will be discriminated against and \ndenied equal access to participation in voting in violation of the ADA. \n \n66 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 68 of 71\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that the Court: \nA. Declare that administering an election during the COVID-19 pandemic in the manner that \nDefendants administered the April 7, 2020 election violates Section 11(b) of the Voting \nRights Act, the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, and the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act; \nB.  Order Defendants, for the August and November 2020 elections, to:  \n1. Take all appropriate actions to ensure that in-person voting, whether exercised by \ncasting an absentee ballot or by casting a ballot on election day, can be safely conducted; \n2. Require that accessible voting machines be available at all in-person absentee voting \nlocations; \n3. Take all appropriate actions to ensure an adequate number of poll workers to \nadminister safe polling places; \n4. Ensure that each registered voter in Wisconsin receives an absentee ballot request form \nand that all residents of care facilities have adequate opportunities to register to vote and \nrequest absentee ballots; \n5. Ensure that individuals with print disabilities have an accessible means of receiving, \nmarking, and submitting absentee ballots privately and independently;  \n6. Take all appropriate actions to ensure that all voters who request and are qualified to \nreceive an absentee ballot in fact receive such absentee ballot, and that any voter whose \nrequest for an absentee ballot is rejected or not processed for any reason be notified and \ngiven the opportunity to cure any defect in a timely manner; \n67 \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00459-wmc   Document #: 37   Filed: 06/23/20   Page 69 of 71\n7. Take all appropriate actions to upgrade electronic voter registration systems so they \ncan process the anticipated elevated number of online registrations and absentee ballot \nrequests; \n8. Take all appropriate actions to coordinate with, and ensure that municipalities \ncoordinate with, the United States Postal Service to ensure the timely delivery and return \nof, and counting of, absentee ballots;   \n9. Ensure that secure drop boxes for in-person return of absentee ballots are available to \nevery voter and increase in-person absentee voting opportunities that are safe and \naccessible, including, for instance, drive-through voting; and \n10. Engage in a public education campaign to apprise the public on: how to request, vote, \nand return absentee ballots; the locations and times for in-person absentee voting; all \nearly voting opportunities in each community; the provisions being made for safe in-\nperson voting; and any changes in election day polling locations. \nC.  Enjoin the enforcement of: \n1. Wis. Stat. § 7.30(2) with respect to the requirement that each election official be an \nelector of the county in which the municipality is located; \n2. Wis.

Stat. § 6.87; (2) the requirement that absentee ballots be signed by a \nwitness, id. § 6.87(2), unless the State provides an appropriate “safety net” as described in the \naccompanying brief; (3) the requirement that photo identification accompany absentee ballot \napplications, id. §§ 6.86, 6.87, unless the State provides an appropriate “safety net” as described \nin the accompanying brief; (4) the requirement that copies of proof of residence accompany \nelectronic and by-mail voter registration, id. § 6.34, unless the State provides an appropriate \n“safety net” as described in the accompanying brief; and (5) the by-mail and electronic voter \nregistration deadlines, id. § 6.28(1). Plaintiffs also challenge the Defendants’ failure to provide \n  - 2 - \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00340-wmc   Document #: 52   Filed: 07/08/20   Page 3 of 7\nsufficient financial, personnel, and other resources to ensure an adequate number of in-person \nabsentee voting sites and election-day polling places to accommodate voters in a safe and secure \nmanner pursuant to its authority to administer Wisconsin’s elections, id. § 5.05 (collectively, \nthese provisions are the “Challenged Provisions”). \n  Since the election held on April 7, 2020, evidence continues pouring in that the COVID-\n19 pandemic is getting worse, governmental responses are falling woefully short, and the \nelectoral process in place for the November General Election is threatened absent judicial \nintervention. Plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction because they are substantially \nlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the Challenged Provisions severely burden the \nrights of Wisconsin voters, deprive them of equal protection under the law, and deprive them of \ntheir liberty interest in voting without due process. \n  The United States’ unprecedented pandemic is getting worse—not better—as the number \nof cases continue to rise. Wisconsinites continue to socially distance themselves to try to slow \nthe spread of the coronavirus. And, if the Spring Election taught the world anything, it is that \nWisconsin voters vastly prefer voting by mail during a pandemic than risking their health and the \nhealth of their loved ones by congregating into polling places. Wisconsin voters—including \nthousands of Plaintiffs’ members and constituents—should not again be forced to make the \nuntenable choice between violating governmental guidelines on self-isolation and social \ndistancing to exercise their fundamental right to vote. Yet, the Challenged Provisions continue to \ndo just that by forcing some voters but not others to resort to in-person registration—or depriving \nthem of any registration option whatsoever. Likewise, voters are forced to leave their homes to \ncopy documents or obtain witness signatures. Even more, the Challenged Provisions impose \narbitrary deadlines that simply cannot be met during this crisis. \n  - 3 - \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00340-wmc   Document #: 52   Filed: 07/08/20   Page 4 of 7\n  Plaintiffs are also entitled to relief because they will suffer irreparable harm absent relief, \nand traditional legal remedies will not adequately protect their rights. Further, the harm to \nPlaintiffs and Wisconsin voters outweighs any potential harm to the State. Finally, it almost goes \nwithout saying that Plaintiffs’ requested relief is in the public interest. \n  According to Wisconsin Election Commission data, the Court’s modest deadline \nextensions in its prior injunctive relief allowed 57, 187 Wisconsin voters to register online after \nMarch 18 without having to venture out to register in-person.  And the Court’s relief saved \n79,054 voters from disenfranchisement by requiring that their timely-cast and mailed absentee \nballots be counted if received by April 13 (and were otherwise valid). In other words, if not for \nthe Court’s orders, tens of thousands of Wisconsinites—if not more—would have been deprived \nof their voting rights. This Court’s orders resulted in the protection and expansion of democracy. \nRegrettably, in the absence of effective leadership by Wisconsin’s elected leaders, this Court \nmust act again to prevent massive disenfranchisements in the November general election. \n  For the foregoing reasons, and as set forth in the accompany Memorandum in Support of \nPlaintiffs’ Renewed Motion for Preliminary Injunction, as well as accompanying Findings of \nFacts, exhibits, expert report, and declarations, the DNC and Democratic Party of Wisconsin \nrespectfully request that this Court grant a Preliminary Injunction and enter judgment:  \n  A.

Enjoining defendants and their respective agents, officers, employees, and \nsuccessors, and all persons acting in concert with each or any of them, from rejecting electronic \nand by-mail registrations that are received by the relevant clerk’s office by Friday, October 30, \n2020. \n  C.

BOSTELMANN, 20-CV-278, PLAINTIFFS’ \nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \nIn accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 and this Court’s procedure for \nmotions seeking a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs League of Women Voters of Wisconsin \n(“LWVWI”),  Wisconsin  Alliance  for  Retired  Americans  (“Wisconsin  Alliance”),  Katherine \nKohlbeck, Diane Fergot, Gary Fergot, Bonibet Bahr Olsan, Sheila Jozwik, Gregg Jozwik, Claire \nWhelan, and Sylvia Gear (collectively, the “Gear Plaintiffs”) respectfully move this Court for \npreliminary injunctive relief. In support of this motion, and as more thoroughly set forth and \n2 \n \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00340-wmc   Document #: 169   Filed: 07/08/20   Page 3 of 10\nsupported in the accompanying Brief, Declarations, and Statement of Proposed Facts, the Gear \nPlaintiffs state as follows: \n1.  The Covid-19 pandemic has changed the way we vote.  Even consistently-applied \nsafety measures cannot make indoor places where people congregate—polling places among \nthem—substantially safe. With the disease spreading exponentially once again, there is every \nreason to believe that the danger to voters will be real and substantial in the fall.  \n2.  Due to the pandemic, in the April 7 election, nearly 62 percent of Wisconsin’s \nelectorate chose to vote by mail. This unprecedented demand for mail-in voting strained and then \nbroke the systems by which absentee ballots are prepared and delivered to voters. At least \nthousands of voters, including six of the Plaintiffs in this action, never received their timely-\nrequested ballots in the mail, because of administrative overload at municipal clerks’ offices, still-\nunexplained U.S. Postal Service (“USPS”) delivery failures, and even a software update glitch. \nWisconsin’s municipal clerks’ offices were barely able to keep up with one million mail-in \nabsentee ballot requests, even as they worked overtime and, in desperation, enlisted other city \ndepartments’ employees. If this year’s turnout is comparable to the level seen in the 2016 \npresidential election, the state will face 1.8 to 2 million mail-in absentee ballot requests for the \nNovember general election. \n3.  To protect the rights of Plaintiffs, their constituents and members, and Wisconsin \nvoters generally under the U.S. Constitution and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \n(“ADA”),  the  Court  should  issue  an  order  adopting  certain  specific  voting  procedures  that \nPlaintiffs  will  demonstrate  are  necessary  as  a  fail-safe  to  prevent  a  repeat  of  the  mass \ndisenfranchisement of absentee voters that occurred in the April 7 election.  Plaintiffs offer three \noptions to provide a fail-safe plan for voters who do not receive a requested absentee ballot in the \nmail. All three of these options would still require that the voter to first request a ballot by mail \n3 \n \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00340-wmc   Document #: 169   Filed: 07/08/20   Page 4 of 10\ndelivery and only use one of these options as a fail-safe; further, the voted replacement ballot must \nbe mailed in or dropped off. A remedy would simply give Plaintiffs a back-up plan so they can \nstill vote. \n4.  The best option is to extend the existing availability of the online access and \ndownload option through the myvote.wi.gov (hereinafter, “MyVote”) portal from just overseas \ncivilian and military voters to domestic civilian voters who do not receive a requested absentee \nballot in the mail, putting a full replacement mail-in ballot in the hands of voters who do not receive \none in the mail. Another option would allow email delivery of replacement mail-in absentee \nballots. Up until the Seventh Circuit’s decision last week, email delivery was an option for regular \nabsentee voters, though it was discretionary for clerks to offer it and only offered sporadically \nacross and within municipalities. The final fail-safe option that this Court could afford to regular \nabsentee voters who do not receive a requested ballot in the mail is the ability to cast a Federal \nWrite-In Absentee Ballot (“FWAB”). Wisconsin already accepts and processes the FWAB for \noverseas civilian and military voters, even if they have not previously requested a ballot be \ndelivered by mail. \n5.  As  fail-safe  options,  Defendants  would  only  need  to  make  these  alternatives \navailable to voters who have previously requested a mail-in absentee ballot, and only in the last \nweek or even just the last few days before Election Day. These limitations ensure the numbers of \nvoters exercising these options are manageable. \n6.  The  Organizational  Plaintiffs  LWVWI  and  Wisconsin  Alliance  press  their \nchallenge to the witness requirement and request that the Court permit voters to use alternatives to \nit. This requirement has such minimal value to law enforcement that it cannot justify forcing voters \nto take unreasonable steps to secure a witness. There are alternatives, some suggested by the \n4 \n \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00340-wmc   Document #: 169   Filed: 07/08/20   Page 5 of 10\nSeventh Circuit panel in April, and they can and should be ordered as alternatives for Wisconsin \nvoters, particularly those at higher risk from Covid-19. \n7.  Plaintiffs  are  likely  to  succeed  on  the  merits  of  their  First  and  Fourteenth \nAmendment Anderson/Burdick claims. The failure to prepare and deliver absentee mail-in ballots \ntimely or at all constitutes a complete denial of a voter’s constitutional right to cast a ballot, where \nvoters cannot safely vote in person due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Accordingly, the burden on the \nright to vote is severe, and the state has no legitimate interest in disenfranchising a voter who does \nnot timely receive their timely-requested absentee ballot in the mail. Since in-person voting would \npose a severe risk to many voters’ health, bodily integrity, and lives, that option is simply not a \nviable choice. Further, the witness requirement for mail-in absentee ballots has become unduly \nburdensome because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and LWVWI and Wisconsin Alliance have been \nforced and will continue to be forced to divert substantial resources, time, effort, and money to \nhelping and educating voters who are struggling to comply with this unconstitutional requirement. \nThe prevention of voter fraud is an important regulatory interest of Defendants, but any law \ndesigned to prevent voter fraud must be balance against the burdens it imposes.  Here, the witness \nrequirement is not an effective, reasonable tool to safeguard election integrity and, therefore, the \nstate’s interest is greatly attenuated and outweighed by the burdens imposed on LWVWI and \nWisconsin Alliance. \n8.  Plaintiffs are also likely to prevail on their unconstitutional conditions doctrine \nclaim. The failure to provide fail-safe options to absentee voters who do not receive their ballots \nin the mail and the witness requirement are both unconstitutional because they require voters to \nforfeit their fundamental right to bodily integrity as a condition of exercising their right to vote. \nSuch state coercion violates the unconstitutional conditions doctrine.  Because Wisconsin law bars \nregular absentee voters from online access and downloading or email delivery options for absentee \n5 \n \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00340-wmc   Document #: 169   Filed: 07/08/20   Page 6 of 10\nvoting, Wis. Stat. § 6.87(3)(d), bars regular voters from casting a FWAB, and requires at-risk \nabsentee voters who live alone to satisfy a witness requirement during this pandemic, Defendants \nplace unconstitutional conditions on the right to vote that coerce Plaintiffs into forfeiting their right \nto bodily integrity. \n9.  Plaintiffs are also likely to succeed on the merits of their ADA Claim.  Several \nplaintiffs here have health conditions that limit major life activities, thereby placing them under \nthe  ADA’s  protections  and  requiring  Wisconsin  election  officials  to  make  reasonable \naccommodations so that they can participate in the November General Election. \n10.  In addition to their likelihood of success on the merits, Plaintiffs meet all of the \nother equitable requirements for entry of a preliminary injunction. More specifically, absent relief \nfrom this Court, Plaintiffs are certain to suffer irreparable harm because there is no way to regain \none’s right to vote after an election is held. Once the election is held and the results are certified, \nthe injury to these voters’ constitutional rights will of course be irreparable. There is no adequate \nremedy at law—no damages—that can make a disenfranchised voter whole. In addition, the \nLWVWI and the Wisconsin Alliance will both be irreparably harmed because their members will \nbe disenfranchised, and because both organizations have diverted resources to try to assist voters \nwith voting absentee under these circumstances. \n11.  The  balance  of  hardships  militates  strongly  in  favor  of  an  injunction.  The \nadministrative aspects of extending existing election infrastructure to provide a fail-safe for \ndomestic civilian voters does not outweigh the hardship to voters in the absence of any back-up \nplan if they do not receive their ballots and cannot vote safely at a polling place. If the Court fails \nto grant a preliminary injunction in this case, thousands of Wisconsinites will be unable to cast a \nballot that counts, in light of the interaction between Wisconsin’s voting laws and the Covid-19 \npandemic. \n6 \n \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00340-wmc   Document #: 169   Filed: 07/08/20   Page 7 of 10\n12.  A preliminary injunction to prevent the disenfranchisement of countless mail-in \nabsentee voters would serve the public interest by vindicating constitutional and statutory rights \nand ensuring that the integrity and legitimacy of Wisconsin elections is not undermined or \ndestroyed by the unconstitutional and unconscionable failure to allow voters who are at higher risk \nfrom Covid-19 to cast a ballot that counts. \n13.  Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court enter an order granting the following \nrelief with respect to the November 4, 2020 general election: \n  (a) Declare that the lack of a fail-safe option for voters who previously and timely requested \na mail-in absentee ballot by mail delivery but who do not receive that ballot in the mail in time to \ncast it such that it will be counted in the November general election, and Wis. Stat. § 6.87(3)(d), \nwhich restricts electronic access and downloading, as well as email delivery, of mail-in absentee \nballots to military and overseas voters, violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as enforced through 42 U.S.C. § \n1983; \n(b) Preliminarily enjoining Wis. Stat. § 6.87(3)(d), which restricts to military and overseas \nvoters the ability to electronically access and download mail-in absentee ballots and the ability to \nreceive an absentee ballot by email delivery; \n(c) To remedy the constitutional and federal statutory violations caused by the lack of a \nfail-safe option for voters who previously and timely requested a mail-in absentee ballot by mail \ndelivery but who do not receive that ballot in the mail, for the November general election, order:  \n1.  Defendants to permit voters who previously and timely requested a mail-in \nabsentee ballot by mail delivery but who do not receive that ballot in the mail in \ntime to timely cast it, to request via email, myvote.wi.gov, or Form EL-121, the \nstatewide uniform absentee ballot application, that a mail-in absentee ballot and its \n7 \n \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00340-wmc   Document #: 169   Filed: 07/08/20   Page 8 of 10\ncertificate  envelope  be  made  available  to  such  voters  for  online  access  and \ndownloading, e.g. through myvote.wi.gov, and/or emailed to such voters; \n2.  Defendants to make mail-in absentee ballots available for online access and \ndownloading, e.g. through myvote.wi.gov, and/or email mail-in absentee ballots, \nupon request via email, myvote.wi.gov, or Form EL-121, the statewide uniform \nabsentee ballot application, to voters who previously and timely requested a mail-\nin absentee ballot by mail delivery but who do not receive that ballot in the mail; \n3.  Defendants to process and count mail-in absentee ballots that were accessed \nonline and downloaded, e.g. through myvote.wi.gov, and/or emailed to voters that \nare timely returned in any way permitted under Wisconsin law or court orders by \nvoters who previously and timely requested a mail-in absentee ballot by mail \ndelivery but do not receive that ballot in the mail; and \n4.  Preliminary injunctive relief prohibiting Defendants from rejecting and/or \nrefusing  to  count  mail-in  absentee  ballots  that  were  accessed  online  and \ndownloaded, e.g. through myvote.wi.gov, and/or emailed to voters that are timely \nreturned in any way permitted under Wisconsin law or court orders by voters who \npreviously and timely requested a mail-in absentee ballot by mail delivery but do \nnot receive that ballot in the mail; \n  (d) In the alternative or in addition to the relief outlined in subsection (c), for the November \ngeneral election, order: \n1.  Defendants  to  permit  voters  who  previously  and  timely  requested  an \nabsentee ballot by mail delivery, to download, vote, and return in any way permitted \nunder Wisconsin law or court orders the Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot; \n8 \n \n \n\nCase: 3:20-cv-00340-wmc   Document #: 169   Filed: 07/08/20   Page 9 of 10\n2.  Defendants to process and count Federal Write-in Absentee Ballots that are \ntimely returned in any way permitted under Wisconsin law or court orders by voters \nwho previously and timely requested a mail-in absentee ballot by mail delivery; \nand \n3.

Stat.  §  6.87(4)(b)1.  violates,  in  part,  the  First  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as \nenforced through 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for the November general election; \n(f) To remedy the constitutional and federal statutory violations caused by enforcement of \nthe witness requirement, Wis. Stat. § 6.87(4)(b)1., without reasonable modification during the \ncourse of the COVID-19 pandemic, preliminarily enjoin Defendants from enforcing Wis. Stat. § \n6.87(4)(b)1., in part, for the November general election and from rejecting and/or refusing to \nprocess and count an absentee mail-in ballot cast in the November general election on the basis \nthat it lacks a witness signature on the certificate envelope, if the mail-in absentee voter signs a \ncertification on the absentee ballot certificate envelope or on a pre-printed insert to be enclosed \nwith  the  absentee  ballot,  that  affirms  that  the  voter  was  unable  to  safely  obtain  a  witness \ncertification through reasonable efforts, provided that the ballot is otherwise valid; \n(g) In the alternative or in addition to the relief outlined in subsection (f), preliminarily \nenjoin Defendants from enforcing Wis.
