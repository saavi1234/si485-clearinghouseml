In response, Black city and state official candidates in Milwaukee, WI, along with Justice Wisconsin, Inc. (\"the plaintiffs\"), brought this lawsuit against the Milwaukee and Wisconsin Election Commissions (\"the defendants\") in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The plaintiffs filed a complaint and motions for a temporary restraining order and a permanent injunction on April 3, 2020. The complaint alleged that the defendants' decision to suspend early voting and voter registration and move to an \"internet election\" disenfranchised Black voters. As such, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated the First, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Twenty-Sixth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act; and 52 U.S.C. &sect; 10301 by denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs requested that the court order the defendants to postpone the April 2020 in-person election until September 8, 2020; to permit early voting to continue; to extend the deadline to register for online voting until September 8, 2020; to cancel in-person registration and in-person absentee voting; and to pay damages and attorneys' fees.</p>\r\n<p>On April 5, 2020, the district court (Chief Judge Pamela Pepper) denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction without prejudice on procedural grounds. 2020 WL 1676481. In response to Judge Pepper's order, the plaintiffs refiled an emergency motion for preliminary injunction the next day.</p>\r\n<p>On April 6, 2020, Judge Pepper denied the plaintiffs' second motion for a preliminary injunction, stating that the \"federal court [did] not have the authority 'to act as the state's chief health official' by making the decision that need[ed] to be made to put the health and safety of the community first.\" 452 F. Supp. 3d 818. That same day, the Wisconsin legislature, as an intervening party, filed a motion to dismiss the case because the plaintiffs lacked standing and failed to state a claim.</p>\r\n<p>On May 12, 2020, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the case without a hearing and without receiving any opposition briefs from any party. The case is now closed.</p>",

SPINDELL, JR., and MARK THOMSEN, \n \n    Defendants. \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE THE PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION (DKT. NO. 1-15) \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \n  Plaintiff Lena Taylor currently is a Wisconsin state senator representing \nthe 4th District, which includes the 53206 zip code, a predominantly African \nAmerican neighborhood. Dkt. No. 1 at 3. Plaintiff Taylor is African American \nherself and lives in Milwaukee; she is running for mayor in Wisconsin’s April 7, \n2020 primary. Id. Plaintiff Tory Lowe is running for alderman in the City of \nMilwaukee’s 6th aldermanic district, which also includes the 53206 zip code. \nId. Plaintiff Lowe also is African American and a citizen of Milwaukee. Id. \nPlaintiff Justice Wisconsin, Inc. “is a non-for-profit organized under the laws of \nthe State of Wisconsin with a primary office in Milwaukee and whose primary \npurpose is to better the lives of residents in the inner city and elsewhere and it \n1 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/05/20   Page 1 of 13   Document 4\n\n \nhas a significant interest as a civil rights organization in a free and unrestricted \nelection;” it was founded by plaintiff Lowe. Id. at 4.  \n  At 12:10 p.m. on Friday, April 3, 2020—one and a half business days \nbefore the scheduled start of the April 7, 2020 election—the plaintiffs filed in \nthe district court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin a “Verified Complaint for \nDeclaratory Relief and Injunctive Relief.” Dkt. No. 1. The complaint sues the \nMilwaukee Election Commission and its five members (in their official \ncapacities) and the Wisconsin Election Commission and its six members (in \ntheir official capacities). Id. at 1. The complaint alleges that the defendants \nviolated the plaintiffs’ civil rights under 42 U.S.C. §1983 (particularly, that the \ndefendants violated their rights under the First, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, \nSixteenth and Twenty-Sixth Amendments to the Constitution) and violated 28 \nU.S.C. §§2201 and 2202. Id. at 18-21. It also alleges that the defendants \nabridged the plaintiffs’ voting rights in violation of 52 U.S.C. §10301. Id. at 22. \nThe suit seeks injunctive relief in the form of a temporary restraining order and \na preliminary injunction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65. Id. at 25-26. Among the \nforms of injunctive relieve the plaintiffs seek is a court order that the election \nscheduled to take place on April 7, 2020—again, one and a half business days \nafter they filed their motion—be postponed until September 2020, due to the \nimpact of the COVID-19 crisis. \n  The plaintiffs attached a number of documents to the complaint: a memo \nfrom someone at the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, answering \nplaintiff Taylor’s questions about early voting (Dkt. No. 1-1); a September 12, \n2 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/05/20   Page 2 of 13   Document 4\n\n \n2019 article from the Brookings Institution called “Setting the record straight \non Black voter turnout” (Dkt. No. 1-2); a March 27, 2020 article from \nWisconsin Public Radio’s web site titled “COVID-19 Deaths Concentrated in \nMilwaukee’s African American Community” (Dkt. No. 1-3); minutes of a March \n18, 2020 meeting of the Wisconsin Elections Commission (Dkt. No. 1-4); a \nMarch 12, 2020 memo from Meagan Wolfe, the administrator of the Wisconsin \nElections Commission, regarding election procedures and the COVID-19 public \nhealth emergency (Dkt. No. 1-5); a March 13, 2020 memo from Wolfe, \nregarding “COVID-19 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s) and Guidance on \nProcedural Changes for Care Facility Absentee Voting and Polling Place \nRelocation” (Dkt. No. 1-6); a March 22, 2020 article from the WTMJ-4 web site \ntitled “Milwaukee early voting sites closed over COVID-19 exposure concerns” \n(Dkt. No. 1-7); a March 22, 2020 article from the Fox6Now.com web site titled \n“Milwaukee’s 3 early voting sites shut down ‘due to increased COVID-19 \nexposure risk’” (Dkt. No. 1-8); a printout from https://censusreporter.org/ \nprofiles showing a profile for zip code 53206 (Dkt. No. 1-9); a document that \nappears to be a printout from the Milwaukee Public Library’s web site, showing \nthat fifteen public libraries are temporarily closed (this document is not dated) \n(Dkt. No. 1-10); a March 25, 2020 article from JSonline titled “Absentee voters \nin Milwaukee, Dane counties can say they’re ‘indefinitely confined’ and skip \nphoto ID, clerks say” (Dkt. No. 1-11); a white paper by Marc V. Levine of the \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, posted on the UWM Digital Commons, \ntitled “Milwaukee 53206: The Anatomy of Concentrated Disadvantage in an \n3 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/05/20   Page 3 of 13   Document 4\n\n \nInner City Neighborhood, 2000-2017” (Dkt. No. 1-12); A December 6, 2018 \narticle from the Appleton Post-Crescent titled “Census data: Minnesota beats \nWisconsin on high-speed internet access, too” (Dkt. No. 1-13); and the \nexecutive summary of the Levine white paper, published by the University of \nWisconsin-Milwaukee’s Center for Economic Development (Dkt. No. 1-14).   \n    The April 3, 2020 filing presents a procedural muddle. The complaint lays \nout the facts that the plaintiffs assert support the granting of injunctive relief, \nthe standard for obtaining injunctive relief and the injunctive relief the \nplaintiffs seek. Dkt. No. 1 at 22-25. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(a-c), the plaintiffs \nmust serve the complaint and signed summonses on the defendants and they \nmust complete that service within ninety days of the date they filed the \ncomplaint. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m). Once served, the defendants have twenty-one \ndays to answer or otherwise respond. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(1). Because the \nplaintiffs filed the complaint one and a half business days before the election, \nthe above process cannot be completed before the election is scheduled to \nbegin. The plaintiffs cannot obtain the relief they seek—postponement of the \nApril 7, 2020 election—through the complaint process. \n   Presumably this is the reason the plaintiffs attached to their complaint a \nmotion for a preliminary injunction.1 Dkt. No. 1-15. The motion consists of two \nparagraphs. While the title of the motion is “Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction,” the body of the motion says that it is a motion “for a temporary \nrestraining order and preliminary injunction.” Id. at 2. The final paragraph \n \n1 This pleading should have been filed as a separate motion for relief. \n4 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/05/20   Page 4 of 13   Document 4\n\n \nasks the court to grant the motion and “issue a preliminary injunction pending \na decision on the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims in this matter.” Id.  \n  The motion does not contain any of the facts supporting the plaintiffs’ \nrequest for relief. It does not describe the legal standard for obtaining \ninjunctive relief. It does not describe the injunctive relief requested. While the \nmotion asserts that there are legal questions at issue, the plaintiffs did not file \na brief in support of the motion; they provided no legal analysis or authority in \nsupport of the motion. Nor did the plaintiffs file a separate motion for a \ntemporary restraining order or lay out in the motion the legal standard for \nobtaining such an order. \n  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(1) states that the court “may issue a preliminary \ninjunction only on notice to the adverse party.” The court has reviewed the \nthirty-two documents the plaintiffs filed on April 3, 2020. There is no certificate \nof service or affidavit of service—nothing to show that the plaintiffs gave notice \nof the motion to the defendants. Even if there is a legal basis for doing so, the \ncourt cannot issue a preliminary injunction until it knows the defendants have \nnotice. It appears that defendants The Wisconsin Election Commission and its \nmembers received notice of the request for injunctive relief, because between \n5:12 and 5:17 p.m. on Friday, April 3, 2020, attorneys from the firm of Lawton \n& Cates filed notices of appearance for those defendants. But no one has filed \nan appearance on behalf of the Milwaukee Election Commission or its members \nand, as noted, there is no evidence in the record that the plaintiffs provided \nthem with notice.  \n5 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/05/20   Page 5 of 13   Document 4\n\n \n  Although the plaintiffs have not filed a motion captioned “Motion for \nTemporary Restraining Order,” they mention a temporary restraining order at \npoints in their filings. Rule 65(b)(1)(B) prohibits the court from issuing a \ntemporary restraining order without written or oral notice to the adverse party \nor its attorney unless the verified complaint shows immediate and irreparable \ninjury and “the movant’s attorney certifies in writing any efforts made to give \nnotice and the reasons why it should not be required.” The plaintiffs have not \nfiled a written certification of the efforts their counsel have made to give notice \nto the Milwaukee Election Commission and its members, nor have they \nexplained why the court should not require notice. \n  Given this procedural posture, it is premature for the court to schedule a \nhearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The court will \ndeny the motion without prejudice; if the plaintiffs provide the court with proof \nthat they have given notice to the defendants (particularly the Milwaukee \nElection Commission and its members) by 10:30 a.m. on Monday, April 6, \n2020, the court will give the defendants an opportunity to respond to the \nmotion as filed. \n  While that resolves the immediate issue before the court, the court notes \nothers. The complaint asked that if the court was not inclined to extend \ninjunctive and declaratory relief, the plaintiffs sought leave “to file an Amended \nComplaint and the case to move forward for the reasons stated above.” Dkt. No. \n1 at 26. The plaintiffs do not need to seek leave of court to amend the \n6 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/05/20   Page 6 of 13   Document 4\n\n \ncomplaint, if they do so within twenty-one days after serving it or within \ntwenty-one days after service of a responsive pleading. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a).   \n  The plaintiffs’ suit is the fifth to be filed in Wisconsin federal courts in \njust over two weeks. On March 18, 2020 (just under three weeks before the \nscheduled April 7, 2020 election), the Democratic National Committee and the \nDemocratic Party of Wisconsin sued the individual members of the Wisconsin \nElections Commission (and the Republican National Committee and the \nRepublican Party of Wisconsin intervened). Democratic National Committee, et \nal. v. Bostelmann, et al., Case No. 20-cv-249-wmc (W.D. Wis.). They \nsimultaneously filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and a \npreliminary injunction (with a supporting brief and evidence), asking the court \nto extend the deadline for electronic and mail-in voter registration to April 3, \nenjoin the requirement that new voters provide proof of residence, enjoin the \nrequirement that absentee voters include a copy of voter identification with \ntheir ballot and enjoining the defendant from rejecting ballots that are \npostmarked on or before election day. Id. at Dkt. No. 2.  \n  On March 24, 2020 (two weeks prior to the scheduled April 7, 2020 \nelection), the City of Green Bay and its City Clerk sued the Wisconsin Elections \nCommission and its members, the Secretary-Designee of the Wisconsin \nDepartment of Health Services and the Governor of Wisconsin in the Eastern \nDistrict of Wisconsin, asking the court to enjoin the defendants from requiring \nthe city to allow in-person voter registration and absentee voting, to order the \nWisconsin Election Commission to allow the city to mail ballots to all registered \n7 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/05/20   Page 7 of 13   Document 4\n\n \nvoters, to cancel the April 7, 2020 election, to extend the deadline for electronic \nor mail registration to May 1, 2020 and to set a June 2, 2020 deadline for \ncounting all returned ballots. City of Green Bay v. Bostelmann, et al., Case No. \n20-cv-479.2 Judge William C. Griesbach held a hearing two days later (March \n26, 2020) and requested simultaneous briefs due at 3:00 p.m. March 27. Id. at \nDkt. No. 40. Later in the day on March 27, 2020, Judge Griesbach dismissed \nthe case for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the plaintiffs did not have standing \nto bring the suit in federal court. Id. at Dkt. No. 53.   \n  On March 26, 2020 (just under two weeks before the scheduled election), \nfour women ranging in age from sixty-four to eighty-three, all of whom were \nself-quarantining due to health issues that they alleged put them at higher risk \nfor several illness if they contracted the COVID-19 virus, along with the \nWisconsin Alliance for Retired Americans and the League of Women Voters of \nWisconsin, filed suit in the Western District of Wisconsin. Gear, et al. v. \nKnudson, et al., Case No. 20-cv-278-wmc. They sued the individual members \nof the Wisconsin Election Commission and its administrator. Id. Two days \nlater, they filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary \ninjunction, a supporting brief and declarations and evidence. Id. at Dkt. Nos. 8-\n17. These plaintiffs asked the court to enjoin the defendants from rejecting or \nrefusing to process or count absentee mail-in ballots that lacked a witness \nsignature. Id. at Dkt. No. 2, page 23.  \n \n2 The plaintiffs in that case properly filed a separate motion for preliminary \ninjunction and motion for temporary restraining order, supported by a brief \nand attached evidence. Bostelmann, Case No. 20-cv-479, Dkt. Nos. 2-3. \n8 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/05/20   Page 8 of 13   Document 4\n\n \n   Also on March 26, 2020, a registered voter who had been diagnosed with \nCOVID-19; the Souls to the Polls alliance of pastors; Voces de la Frontera; \nBlack Leaders Organizing for Communities; the American Federation of \nTeachers, Local 212, AFL-CIO; SEIU Wisconsin State Council (a conglomerate \nof unions representing workers in home healthcare services, hospitals and \nlong-term care facilities, stadiums and the catered food industry); and the \nLeague of Women Voters of Wisconsin filed suit in the Western District. \nReverend Greg Lewis, et al. v. Knudoson, et al., Case No. 20-cv-284-wmc. They \nsued the six individual members of the Wisconsin Elections Commission and \nits administrator. Id. at Dkt. No. 1, page 1. These plaintiffs asked the court to \nenjoin the proof of residence requirement and the photo ID requirement and \nthe witness requirement for absentee ballots. Id. at page 66. They also asked \nthe court to order the Wisconsin Election Commission to provide enough \nballots and envelopes so that every registered voter who timely requested an \nabsentee ballot by mail would get one in advance of the rescheduled election. \nId. They asked the court to enjoin the defendants from rejecting ballots \npostmarked on or before election day that arrive at the clerk’s office by June 2, \n2020. Id. They asked for an injunction preventing the defendants from \nenforcing the requirement that municipalities allow in-person voter or absentee \nregistration. Id. at pages 66-67. They asked the court to postpone the April 7, \n2020 election and reschedule it after the public health crisis has subsided, and \nto extend the deadline for electronic or mail voter registration to May 1, 2020. \n9 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/05/20   Page 9 of 13   Document 4\n\n \nId. at page 67. And they asked the court to order a June 2, 2020 deadline for \nclerks to count all returned mailed absentee ballots. Id.  \n  On March 28, 2020, Judge William C. Conley consolidated the three \nWestern District cases, and after extensive briefing (including the filing of \namicus briefs), he conducted a hearing on April 1, 2020. See, e.g., Lewis, et al. \nv. Knudson, et al., Case No. 20-cv-284 at Dkt. Nos. 26, 87. On Thursday, April \n2, 2020—the day before the plaintiffs filed the instant complaint—Judge Conley \nissued an extensive, detailed order granting in part and denying in part the \nrelief the various plaintiffs had requested. Id. at Dkt. No. 113; Democratic Nat’l \nCommittee v. Bostelmann, Nos. 20-cv-249; 20-cv-278; 20-cv-284, 2020 WL \n1638374 (W.D. Wis. April 2, 2020). Judge Conley denied the plaintiffs’ request \nto order the April 7, 2020 election postponed. Id. at *15. At the conclusion of \nhis analysis of that request, Judge Conley stated: \nWithout doubt, the April 7 election day will create unprecedented \nburdens not just for aspiring voters, but also for poll workers, clerks, \nand indeed the state. As much as the court would prefer that the \nWisconsin  Legislature  and  Governor  consider  the  public  health \nahead of any political considerations, that does not appear to be in \nthe cards. Nor is it appropriate for a federal district court to act as \nthe state’s chief health official by taking that step for them. \n \nId.3  \n \n3 The same day the plaintiffs filed this suit, Wisconsin’s governor called a \nspecial legislative session for 4:00 p.m. Saturday, April 4, 2020 to consider \nextending the election date and converting the election to a mail-in election. \nhttps://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/04/03/tony-\nevers-calls-lawmakers-into-session-stop-person-voting/2940156001/. Some \nlawmakers met on April 4—according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the \nassembly met for seventeen seconds, the senate less—and both houses \nrecessed until Monday, April 6, 2020. \n10 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/05/20   Page 10 of 13   Document 4\n\n \n  Judge Conley granted the request for an extension of the deadline for \nreceipt of absentee ballots, extending that deadline to 4:00 p.m. on April 13, \n2020. Id. at *17. He also granted the request to extend the deadline for receipt \nof absentee ballot requests to April 3, 2020 at 5:00 p.m. Id. at *18. He granted \nthe plaintiffs’ request to require the defendants to accept an unwitnessed \nballot, ordering that the defendants must accept an unwitnessed absentee \nballot if it contains a written affirmation or other statement by an absentee \nvoter that due to the COVID-10 pandemic, he or she was unable to safely \nobtain a witness certification despite his or her reasonable efforts to do so, \nprovided that the ballot is otherwise valid. Id. at *20. Judge Conley denied the \nplaintiffs’ request to enjoin the photo ID requirement. Id. at 21. He also denied \nthe plaintiffs’ request to extend the deadline for mail-in registration and to \ngrant relief from proof of residency, for the simple reason that as hard as he \nhad tried to expedite the case, he had conducted the hearing April 1 and issued \nhis decision April 2—by that time, there was only a day left until the plaintiffs’ \nrequested extension deadline. Id.  \n  The Wisconsin Legislature (whom Judge Conley had not allowed to \nintervene in the consolidated suits) and the Republican National Committee \nand Republican Party of Wisconsin asked the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals \nto stay Judge Conley’s ruling. Democratic Nat’l Committee, et al. v. \nBostelmann, et al., Appeal Nos. 20-1538, 20-1539 20-1545 and 20-1546 (7th \n \nhttps://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2020/04/04/wisconsin-legislature-\nadjourns-special-session-monday-voting-track-tuesday-election/2948444001/. \n11 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/05/20   Page 11 of 13   Document 4\n\n \nCir.). A few minutes before 7:00 p.m. on Friday, April 3, 2020, the Seventh \nCircuit denied the motions for stay as to Judge Conley’s order extending the \ndeadline for receipt of absentee ballots to 4:00 p.m. on April 13, 2020 and \nextending the deadline for requesting absentee ballots to 5:00 p.m. on April 3, \n2020. Id. at Dkt. No. 30, page 3. The court granted the motion to stay the part \nof Judge Conley’s order providing an alternative to witness statements for those \nunable to obtain them. Id. The court also found that the Wisconsin Legislature \nhad standing, and that Judge Conley erred in refusing to allow it to intervene. \nId. at page 4. No party asked the court to stay Judge Conley’s ruling denying \nthe request that he delay the April 7, 2020 election. \n  On Saturday, April 4, 2020, the Republican National Committee, the \nRepublican Party of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Legislature filed an \nemergency application for a stay with United States Supreme Court Justice \nBrett M. Kavanaugh. Republican Nat’l Committee, et al. v. Democratic Nat’l \nCommittee, et al., Case No. 19A1016 (April 4, 2020) (available at \nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/ht\nml/public/19a1016.html). The response to that application is due at 2:00 p.m. \nEST on Sunday, April 5, 2020. \n  It is premature for the court to opine on the substance of the claims in \nthe instant complaint. The court relates the preceding history only to note that \nseveral courts have considered claims similar to, if not identical to, the claims \nthe plaintiffs raise here, with more time to do so and more input from more \naffected constituencies. The court has reviewed the decisions of those courts \n12 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/05/20   Page 12 of 13   Document 4\n\n \nand assumes that the parties will take those decisions into consideration when \ncrafting further pleadings. \n   The court ORDERS that the clerk’s office must docket the Plaintiff’s \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction currently docketed at Dkt. No. 1-15 as a \nseparate docket entry. \n  The court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICDE the plaintiffs’ motion for \npreliminary injunction. Dkt. No. 1-15. \n  The court ORDERS that if the plaintiffs wish to proceed with their \nmotion for a preliminary injunction, they must seek leave to renew the motion, \naccompanied by proof that they have provided notice to all defendants, no later \nthan 10:30 a.m. on Monday, April 6, 2020.  \n  Dated in Milwaukee, Wisconsin this 5th day of April, 2020. \n            BY THE COURT: \n \n            __________________________________________ \n            HON.

GABRIEL, \nSTEPHANIE D. FINDLY, CARMEN C. CABRERA, \nJESS RIPP, THE WISCONSIN ELECTION COMMISSION, \nMARGE BOSTELMANN, JULIE M. GLANCEY, \nANN S. JACOBS, DEAN KNUDSON,  \nROBERT F. SPINDELL, JR., and MARK THOMSEN, \n \n    Defendants. \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nORDER DENYING THE PLAINTIFFS’ EMERGENCY MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION (DKT. NO. 11) \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \n  Plaintiff Lena Taylor currently is a Wisconsin state senator representing \nthe 4th District, which includes the 53206 zip code, a predominantly African \nAmerican neighborhood. Dkt. No. 1 at 3. Plaintiff Taylor is African American \nand lives in Milwaukee; she is running for mayor in Wisconsin’s April 7, 2020 \nprimary. Id. Plaintiff Tory Lowe is running for alderman in the City of \nMilwaukee’s 6th aldermanic district, which also includes the 53206 zip code. \nId. Plaintiff Lowe also is African American and a citizen of Milwaukee. Id. \nPlaintiff Justice Wisconsin Inc. “is a non-for-profit organized under the laws of \nthe State of Wisconsin with a primary office in Milwaukee and whose primary \npurpose is to better the lives of residents in the inner city and elsewhere and it \n1 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 1 of 23   Document 25\n\n \nhas a significant interest as a civil rights organization in a free and unrestricted \nelection;” it was founded by plaintiff Lowe. Id. at 4.  \n  One and a half business days before the scheduled start of the April 7, \n2020 election, the plaintiffs filed in the district court for the Eastern District of \nWisconsin a “Verified Complaint for Declaratory Relief and Injunctive Relief.” \nDkt. No. 1. The complaint sues the Milwaukee Election Commission and its five \nmembers (in their official capacities) and the Wisconsin Election Commission \nand its six members (in their official capacities). Id. at 1. The complaint alleges \nthat the defendants violated the plaintiffs’ civil rights under 42 U.S.C. §1983 \n(particularly, that the defendants violated their rights under the First, \nFourteenth, Fifteenth, Sixteenth and Twenty-Sixth Amendments to the \nConstitution) and violated 28 U.S.C. §§2201 and 2202. Id. at 18-21. It also \nalleges that the defendants abridged the plaintiffs’ voting rights in violation of \n52 U.S.C. §10301. Id. at 22. The suit seeks injunctive relief in the form of a \ntemporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n65. Id. at 25-26. Among the forms of injunctive relieve the plaintiffs seek is a \ncourt order that the election scheduled to take place on April 7, 2020—again, \none and a half business days after they filed their motion—be postponed until \nSeptember 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. \nI.  Procedural History \n  The plaintiffs attached documents to the complaint: a memo from \nsomeone at the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, answering plaintiff \nTaylor’s questions about early voting (dkt. no. 1-1); a September 12, 2019 \n2 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 2 of 23   Document 25\n\n \narticle from the Brookings Institution called “Setting the record straight on \nBlack voter turnout” (dkt. no. 1-2); a March 27, 2020 article from Wisconsin \nPublic Radio’s web site titled “COVID-19 Deaths Concentrated in Milwaukee’s \nAfrican American Community” (dkt. no. 1-3); minutes of a March 18, 2020 \nmeeting of the Wisconsin Elections Commission (dkt. no. 1-4); a March 12, \n2020 memo from Meagan Wolfe, the administrator of the Wisconsin Elections \nCommission, regarding election procedures and the COVID-19 public health \nemergency (dkt. no. 1-5); a March 13, 2020 memo from Wolfe, regarding \n“COVID-19 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s) and Guidance on Procedural \nChanges for Care Facility Absentee Voting and Polling Place Relocation” (dkt. \nno. 1-6); a March 22, 2020 article from the WTMJ-4 web site titled “Milwaukee \nearly voting sites closed over COVID-19 exposure concerns” (dkt. no. 1-7); a \nMarch 22, 2020 article from the Fox6Now.com web site titled “Milwaukee’s 3 \nearly voting sites shut down ‘due to increased COVID-19 exposure risk’” (Dkt. \nNo. 1-8); a printout from https://censusreporter.org/profiles showing a profile \nfor zip code 53206 (dkt. no. 1-9); a document that appears to be a printout \nfrom the Milwaukee Public Library’s web site, showing that fifteen public \nlibraries are temporarily closed (this document is not dated) (dkt. no. 1-10); a \nMarch 25, 2020 article from JSonline titled “Absentee voters in Milwaukee, \nDane counties can say they’re ‘indefinitely confined’ and skip photo ID, clerks \nsay” (dkt. no. 1-11); a white paper by Marc V. Levine of the University of \nWisconsin-Milwaukee, posted on the UWM Digital Commons, titled “Milwaukee \n53206: The Anatomy of Concentrated Disadvantage in an Inner City \n3 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 3 of 23   Document 25\n\n \nNeighborhood, 2000-2017” (dkt. no. 1-12); a December 6, 2018 article from the \nAppleton Post-Crescent titled “Census data: Minnesota beats Wisconsin on \nhigh-speed internet access, too” (dkt. no. 1-13); and the executive summary of \nthe Levine white paper, published by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee’s \nCenter for Economic Development (dkt. no. 1-14).   \n  In an order docketed around 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, April 5, 2020, the \ncourt denied without prejudice the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction, because they had not presented proof that they had given notice to \nthe adverse parties as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(1). Dkt. No. 4. Since \nthen, counsel has made an appearance for the Milwaukee Election Commission \nand its individual members (dkt. no. 5), the plaintiffs have filed a declaration \nand supporting documents confirming that they provided notice to the adverse \nparties (dkt. no. 6) and the plaintiffs have renewed their motion for a \npreliminary injunction (twice, in fact, due to the court’s failure to see it the first \ntime because it wasn’t designated a “renewed” motion) (dkt. nos. 7, 11). The \nWisconsin Legislature has filed a motion to intervene (dkt. no. 16) and a \nproposed motion to dismiss which also serves as its opposition to the motion \nfor preliminary injunctive relief (dkt. no. 20). The Wisconsin Election \nCommission and its individual members oppose the plaintiffs’ motion for \ninjunctive relief (dkt. no. 18), as do the Milwaukee Election Commission and its \nindividual members (dkt. no. 19).  \n  The court gave the plaintiffs a deadline of 2:30 p.m. on April 6, 2020 to \nfile a reply in support of their motion. Dkt. No. 15. In lieu of a brief or \n4 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 4 of 23   Document 25\n\n \nsupporting documents, the plaintiffs’ counsel filed a letter that states the \nfollowing: \nDear Judge Pepper: \n \n  You had requested input from the parties as to the desirability \nof oral argument and other matters. As I understand it, Governor \nEvers has issued an order that may result in delaying the allegedly \ndeficient election. Plaintiffs do not believe that oral argument will \nhelp to clarify the issues raised in the parties’ submissions at this \npoint.  Plaintiff  proposes  to  rely  on  their  written  submissions, \nincluding all exhibits as filed today. However, given the substantial \nfilings  raising  multiple  issues,  I  would  suggest  that  we  enter  a \nscheduling order on the underlying complaint as well as any issues \nthat remain. We do expect a judicial challenge to the executive order \nand so we ask that jurisdiction be maintained until there is a truly \nfinal order or decision. \n \nDkt. No. 22.   \n  Between noon on April 6, 2020, when the court issued its deadline for \nthe plaintiffs to file a reply, and the 2:30 deadline the court had set for them to \ndo so, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers issued Executive Order #74, suspending \nin-person voting until June 9, 2020. https://evers.wi.gov/Documents/ \nCOVID19/EO074-SuspendingInPersonVotingAndSpecialSession2.pdf. The \nWisconsin Legislature also had challenged that order in the Wisconsin \nSupreme Court. Wisconsin Legislature v. Tony Evers, 2020AP000608 (Wis.), \navailable at https://wscca.wicourts.gov/. \n  The court held a telephone hearing at 3:30 p.m. on April 6, 2020. \nCounsel for the plaintiffs, the WEC and its individual members and the MEC \nand its individual members participated, as did counsel for proposed intervenor \nthe Wisconsin Legislature. In addition, a person who identified himself as \n5 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 5 of 23   Document 25\n\n \nAttorney Walter Hackett stated that he had been retained by two voters but \nhad not yet filed an appearance. \n  During the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel told the court that the plaintiffs \nplanned to stand on their pleadings to date; they did not intend to file \nadditional briefs or documents in support of the motion for preliminary \ninjunction. Counsel told the court that by asking for a “scheduling order on the \nunderlying complaint,” counsel had meant to ask that the case proceed as it \notherwise would, under the “standard” scheduling order. Counsel also told the \ncourt that in asking that “jurisdiction be maintained,” the plaintiffs had meant \nto ask the court not to sua sponte dismiss the motion for injunctive relief or the \ncomplaint based on Governor Evers’s executive order. \n  The court indicated that as for “scheduling” orders, it already had set a \nbriefing schedule for the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The \ndefendants and the proposed intervening defendant had filed briefs, and the \nplaintiffs had indicated that they did not plan to file a reply. As for the \ncomplaint, the court stated that there was no need for it to issue a “scheduling \norder”—Fed. R. Civ. P. 4 described the service of process requirement, after \nwhich Rule 12 governed the time for the defendants to answer or otherwise \nrespond. Finally, the court stated that Civil Local Rule 7(b) for the Eastern \nDistrict of Wisconsin (https://www.wied.uscourts.gov/sites/wied/files/ \ndocuments/Local%20Rules%202010-0201-%20Amended%202019-0903.3.pdf) \ngoverned the briefing schedule for the Wisconsin Legislature’s motion to \n6 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 6 of 23   Document 25\n\n \nintervene (dkt. no. 16) and its proposed motion to dismiss1 (dkt. no. 20); under \nthat rule, the plaintiffs have twenty-one days to respond and the Legislature \nand defendants have fourteen days to reply. \n  As to the plaintiffs’ concerns that the court might react to Executive \nOrder #74 by sua sponte denying the motion for preliminary injunctive relief or \ndismissing the complaint, the court indicated that it was not in the habit of \ntaking dispositive action sua sponte. Finally, the court asked the parties for \ntheir views on whether Executive Order #74 mooted the plaintiffs’ motion, if it \nremained in effect. All parties agreed that the order would moot the plaintiffs’ \nmotion if not invalidated. \n  In the late afternoon on April 6, 2020, the Wisconsin Supreme Court \nenjoined the provisions of Executive Order #74. Wisconsin Legislature v. Evers, \nAppeal No. 2020AP000608 (Wis.), available at https://wscca.wicourts.gov.  \nII.  Other Federal Cases Seeking Postponement of the Election   \n  The plaintiffs’ suit is the fifth to be filed in Wisconsin federal courts in \njust over two weeks. On March 18, 2020 (just under three weeks before the \nscheduled April 7, 2020 election), the Democratic National Committee and the \nDemocratic Party of Wisconsin sued the individual members of the Wisconsin \nElections Commission (and the Republican National Committee and the \nRepublican Party of Wisconsin intervened). Democratic National Committee, et \nal. v. Bostelmann, et al., Case No. 20-cv-249-wmc (W.D. Wis.). They \n \n1 Counsel for the Legislature clarified for the court that the proposed motion to \ndismiss also was intended to serve as an opposition brief to the plaintiffs’ \nmotion for preliminary injunctive relief. \n7 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 7 of 23   Document 25\n\n \nsimultaneously filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and a \npreliminary injunction (with a supporting brief and evidence), asking the court \nto extend the deadline for electronic and mail-in voter registration to April 3, \nenjoin the requirement that new voters provide proof of residence, enjoin the \nrequirement that absentee voters include a copy of voter identification with \ntheir ballot and enjoining the defendant from rejecting ballots that are \npostmarked on or before election day. Id. at Dkt. No. 2.  \n  On March 24, 2020 (two weeks prior to the scheduled April 7, 2020 \nelection), the City of Green Bay and its City Clerk sued the Wisconsin Elections \nCommission and its members, the Secretary-Designee of the Wisconsin \nDepartment of Health Services and the Governor of Wisconsin in the Eastern \nDistrict of Wisconsin, asking the court to enjoin the defendants from requiring \nthe city to allow in-person voter registration and absentee voting, to order the \nWisconsin Election Commission to allow the city to mail ballots to all registered \nvoters, to cancel the April 7, 2020 election, to extend the deadline for electronic \nor mail registration to May 1, 2020 and to set a June 2, 2020 deadline for \ncounting all returned ballots. City of Green Bay v. Bostelmann, et al., Case No. \n20-cv-479. Judge William C. Griesbach held a hearing two days later (March \n26, 2020) and requested simultaneous briefs due at 3:00 p.m. March 27. Id. at \nDkt. No. 40. Later in the day on March 27, 2020, Judge Griesbach dismissed \nthe case for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the plaintiffs did not have standing \nto bring the suit in federal court. Id. at Dkt. No. 53.   \n8 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 8 of 23   Document 25\n\n \n  On March 26, 2020 (just under two weeks before the scheduled election), \nfour women ranging in age from sixty-four to eighty-three, all of whom were \nself-quarantining due to health issues that they alleged put them at higher risk \nfor several illness if they contracted the COVID-19 virus, along with the \nWisconsin Alliance for Retired Americans and the League of Women Voters of \nWisconsin, filed suit in the Western District of Wisconsin. Gear, et al. v. \nKnudson, et al., Case No. 20-cv-278-wmc. They sued the individual members \nof the Wisconsin Election Commission and its administrator. Id. Two days \nlater, they filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary \ninjunction, a supporting brief and declarations and evidence. Id. at Dkt. Nos. 8-\n17. These plaintiffs asked the court to enjoin the defendants from rejecting or \nrefusing to process or count absentee mail-in ballots that lacked a witness \nsignature. Id. at Dkt. No. 2, page 23.  \n   Also on March 26, 2020, a registered voter who had been diagnosed with \nCOVID-19; the Souls to the Polls alliance of pastors; Voces de la Frontera; \nBlack Leaders Organizing for Communities; the American Federation of \nTeachers, Local 212, AFL-CIO; SEIU Wisconsin State Council (a conglomerate \nof unions representing workers in home healthcare services, hospitals and \nlong-term care facilities, stadiums and the catered food industry); and the \nLeague of Women Voters of Wisconsin filed suit in the Western District. \nReverend Greg Lewis, et al. v. Knudson, et al., Case No. 20-cv-284-wmc. They \nsued the six individual members of the Wisconsin Elections Commission and \nits administrator. Id. at Dkt. No. 1, page 1. These plaintiffs asked the court to \n9 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 9 of 23   Document 25\n\n \nenjoin the proof of residence requirement and the photo ID requirement and \nthe witness requirement for absentee ballots. Id. at page 66. They also asked \nthe court to order the Wisconsin Election Commission to provide enough \nballots and envelopes so that every registered voter who timely requested an \nabsentee ballot by mail would get one in advance of the rescheduled election. \nId. They asked the court to enjoin the defendants from rejecting ballots \npostmarked on or before election day that arrive at the clerk’s office by June 2, \n2020. Id. They asked for an injunction preventing the defendants from \nenforcing the requirement that municipalities allow in-person voter or absentee \nregistration. Id. at pages 66-67. They asked the court to postpone the April 7, \n2020 election and reschedule it after the public health crisis has subsided, and \nto extend the deadline for electronic or mail voter registration to May 1, 2020. \nId. at page 67. And they asked the court to order a June 2, 2020 deadline for \nclerks to count all returned mailed absentee ballots. Id.  \n  On March 28, 2020, Judge William C. Conley consolidated the three \nWestern District cases, and after extensive briefing (including the filing of \namicus briefs), he conducted a hearing on April 1, 2020. See, e.g., Lewis, et al. \nv. Knudson, et al., Case No. 20-cv-284 at Dkt. Nos. 26, 87. On Thursday, April \n2, 2020—the day before the plaintiffs filed the instant complaint—Judge Conley \nissued an extensive, detailed order granting in part and denying in part the \nrelief the various plaintiffs had requested. Id. at Dkt. No. 113; Democratic Nat’l \nCommittee v. Bostelmann, Nos. 20-cv-249; 20-cv-278; 20-cv-284, 2020 WL \n1638374 (W.D. Wis. April 2, 2020). Judge Conley denied the plaintiffs’ request \n10 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 10 of 23   Document 25\n\n \nto order the April 7, 2020 election postponed. Id. at *15. At the conclusion of \nhis analysis of that request, Judge Conley stated: \nWithout doubt, the April 7 election day will create unprecedented \nburdens not just for aspiring voters, but also for poll workers, clerks, \nand indeed the state. As much as the court would prefer that the \nWisconsin  Legislature  and  Governor  consider  the  public  health \nahead of any political considerations, that does not appear to be in \nthe cards. Nor is it appropriate for a federal district court to act as \nthe state’s chief health official by taking that step for them. \n \nId.2  \n  Judge Conley granted the request for an extension of the deadline for \nreceipt of absentee ballots, extending that deadline to 4:00 p.m. on April 13, \n2020. Id. at *17. He also granted the request to extend the deadline for receipt \nof absentee ballot requests to April 3, 2020 at 5:00 p.m. Id. at *18. He granted \nthe plaintiffs’ request to require the defendants to accept an unwitnessed \nballot, ordering that the defendants must accept an unwitnessed absentee \nballot if it contains a written affirmation or other statement by an absentee \nvoter that due to the COVID-10 pandemic, he or she was unable to safely \nobtain a witness certification despite his or her reasonable efforts to do so, \nprovided that the ballot is otherwise valid. Id. at *20. Judge Conley denied the \n \n2 The same day the plaintiffs filed this suit, Governor Evers called a special \nlegislative session for 4:00 p.m. Saturday, April 4, 2020 to consider extending \nthe election date and converting the election to a mail-in election. \nhttps://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/04/03/tony-\nevers-calls-lawmakers-into-session-stop-person-voting/2940156001/. Some \nlawmakers met on April 4—according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the \nassembly met for seventeen seconds, the senate less—and both houses \nrecessed until Monday, April 6, 2020. \nhttps://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2020/04/04/wisconsin-legislature-\nadjourns-special-session-monday-voting-track-tuesday-election/2948444001/. \n11 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 11 of 23   Document 25\n\n \nplaintiffs’ request to enjoin the photo ID requirement. Id. at 21. He also denied \nthe plaintiffs’ request to extend the deadline for mail-in registration and to \ngrant relief from proof of residency, for the simple reason that as hard as he \nhad tried to expedite the case, he had conducted the hearing April 1 and issued \nhis decision April 2—by that time, there was only a day left until the plaintiffs’ \nrequested extension deadline. Id.  \n  The Wisconsin Legislature (whom Judge Conley had not allowed to \nintervene in the consolidated suits) and the Republican National Committee \nand Republican Party of Wisconsin asked the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals \nto stay Judge Conley’s ruling. Democratic Nat’l Committee, et al. v. \nBostelmann, et al., Appeal Nos. 20-1538, 20-1539 20-1545 and 20-1546 (7th \nCir.). On the evening of Friday, April 3, 2020, the Seventh Circuit denied the \nmotions for stay as to Judge Conley’s order extending the deadline for receipt of \nabsentee ballots to 4:00 p.m. on April 13, 2020 and extending the deadline for \nrequesting absentee ballots to 5:00 p.m. on April 3, 2020. Id. at Dkt. No. 30, \npage 3. The court granted the motion to stay the part of Judge Conley’s order \nproviding an alternative to witness statements for those unable to obtain them. \nId. The court also found that the Wisconsin Legislature had standing, and that \nJudge Conley erred in refusing to allow it to intervene. Id. at page 4. No party \nasked the court to stay Judge Conley’s ruling denying the request that he delay \nthe April 7, 2020 election. \n  On Saturday, April 4, 2020, the Republican National Committee, the \nRepublican Party of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Legislature filed an \n12 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 12 of 23   Document 25\n\n \nemergency application for a stay with United States Supreme Court Justice \nBrett M.

Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. No. 11) \n  As the court noted in its April 5, 2020 order, the plaintiffs’ motion \nconsists of two paragraphs: \nPlaintiffs Lena Taylor, Tory Lowe and Justice Wisconsin by their \nattorneys,  Paul  A.  Strouse  of  Strouse  Law  Offices  and  Thomas \nNapierala of Napierala Law Offices bring this emergency motion for \na temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on behalf \nof Lena Taylor, Tory Lowe and Justice Wisconsin Inc., against the \nabove named defendant Commissions and their officials in their \nofficial  capacities  only,  to  address  voter  disenfranchisement, \nparticularly  of  African  American  voters  in  the  53206  area  code \nrespectfully move this Court for a preliminary injunction as set out \nbelow and for the reasons set out in the accompanying Complaint. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 65(a). Because there are only legal questions at issue, \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that this Court not consolidate the \npreliminary injunction hearing with a later trial on the merits and \nrule in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(2). \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request the Court grant their \nMotion and issue a preliminary injunction pending a decision on the \nmerits of Plaintiffs’ claims in this matter. \n \nDkt. No. 11 at 2. The plaintiffs did not file a legal brief in support of this \nmotion. Instead, they asserted at today’s hearing, and again in this version of \n13 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 13 of 23   Document 25\n\n \nthe motion, that they are relying on the allegations in the complaint and the \nattachments to the complaint to support the motion. \n  A.  Standing \n  Both defendants assert that the plaintiffs do not have standing to seek \ntheir requested relief. As Judge Griesbach noted in City of Green Bay,  \n“No principle is more fundamental to the judiciary’s proper role in \nour  system  of  government  than  the  constitutional  limitation  of \nfederal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.” Spokeo, \nInc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016) (quoting Raines v. Byrd, \n521 U.S. 811, 818 (1997)). The “case or controversy” requirement \ncontained in Article III ensures that the federal judicial power is \nconfined to a role consistent with a system of separated powers and \nlimited to cases “which are traditionally thought to be capable of \nresolution through the judicial process.” Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. \n83,  97  (1968).  A  plaintiff  seeking  to  invoke  a  federal  court’s \njurisdiction must demonstrate that he has “(1) suffered an injury in \nfact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the \ndefendant,  and  (3) that  is  likely  to  be  redressed  by  a  favorable \njudicial decision.” Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1547 (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted). To establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must \nshow that he suffered “an invasion of a legally protected interest that \nis (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical.” Perry v. Vill. of Arlington Heights, 186 \nF.3d 826, 829 (7th Cir. 1999). \n \nCity of Green Bay v. Bostelmann, No. 20-C-479, 2020 WL 1492975, at *2 (E.D. \nWis. Mar. 27, 2020).  \n  The complaint in the instant case alleges that the plaintiffs “have a \n‘legally protectable interest in this litigation.’” Dkt. No. 1 at ¶28, quoting Lopez-\nAguilar v. Marion Cty. Sheriff’s Dep’t, 924 F.3d 375, 391 (7th Cir. 2019). The \n“legally protectable interest” standard, however, is the standard for intervention \nas of right, not standing. While the plaintiffs are correct that in the context of \nintervention, the Seventh Circuit has interpreted “statements of the Supreme \n14 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 14 of 23   Document 25\n\n \nCourt as encouraging liberality in the definition of an interest,” id. (quoting \nMeridian Homes Corp. v. Nicholas W. Prassas & Co., 683 F.2d 201, 204 (7th \nCir. 1982), it has encouraged that liberality in the context of determining \nwhether a party has a sufficient interest to allow it to intervene in on-going \nlitigation, not in determining whether a party has standing to bring suit. \n  The plaintiffs assert that plaintiff Taylor “is a candidate for Mayor and \nrepresents voters in the 6th district/53206.” Id. They assert that plaintiff Lowe \n“is a candidate for Milwaukee’s 6th Aldermanic District. Which encompasses \n6th District/53206.” Id. They assert that “Justice Wisconsin is a not for profit \ncivil rights organization which devotes itself to the greater civic good of inner-\ncity life in 6th District/53206 and elsewhere.” Id. Finally, they assert that \nCarolyn Carroll—who is not named as a plaintiff in the suit—“is a voter who is \ndenied equal access to the vote by way of comparison to white or other voters \nwithin the City of Milwaukee.” Id. \n  It is not clear whether Taylor is asserting that she has standing because \nshe represents people who are being denied their right to vote by the \ndefendants’ practices. If so, she has provided the court with no authority \nsupporting a claim that an individual legislator has standing to sue for alleged \nviolations of the constitutional rights of her constituents. Nor is it clear \nwhether Taylor and Lowe are asserting that they have standing because they \nare candidates who may suffer if some of the voters on whom they rely are \ndenied their right to vote by the defendants’ practices. Again, if this is their \nargument, they have presented the court with no authority supporting this \n15 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 15 of 23   Document 25\n\n \nproposition. The court does not mean to imply that there is no authority for \nthese positions. But if there is, the plaintiffs have not identified it, and this \ncourt does not have the obligation or the time at this point to find it.  \n  Perhaps Taylor and Lowe mean to assert that they have standing \nbecause they are voters who are being denied their right to vote by the \ndefendants’ practices. If they had provided the court with evidence that they, \nthemselves, had been or would be prevented from voting by the defendant’s \npractices, it is likely that they would be able to assert standing. But that is not \nwhat they allege. They allege that others—such as Carolyn Carroll, whom they \ndid not name as a plaintiff but whom they assert lives in the 53206 zip code \nand “is affected by the actions” of the defendants—are being prevented from \nvoting because they were not able to vote early.3 \n  As for Justice Wisconsin Inc., the Wisconsin Election Commission does \nnot assert that it does not have standing. Dkt. No. 18. The Milwaukee Election \nCommission argues that Justice Wisconsin does not have standing because it \nis an organization asserting a general public interest, rather than specific harm \nor injury to itself. Dkt. No. 19 at 4. Citing United States Parole Comm’n v. \n \n3 The complaint contains what appears to be a screen shot of a post from Ms. \nCarroll on an unidentified social media platform, stating that she lives in a \nsenior living facility with people who usually go to vote as a group. Dkt. No. 1 \nat ¶15. The post says that Ms. Carroll does not know “how we’re going to do \nthis because some of them don’t even have internet or cell phone so I don’t \nknow how they going to do this.” Id. It says that “it might be like at least two or \nthree people from my building going out to vote with me.” Id. Ms. Carroll does \nnot appear to assert in the post that she can’t vote; she appears to express \nconcern that others in her building will be deterred from voting. Likely she is \ncorrect. \n16 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 16 of 23   Document 25\n\n \nGeraghty, 445 U.S. 388 (1980), the MEC argues that Justice Wisconsin has not \nprovided the court with enough information to determine whether its members \nwould have standing in their own rights or whether its interests are germane to \nthe organization’s purpose—it has not indicated whether it has members, \nwhether those members live in the 53206 zip code, how they would be \nimpacted by the election procedures of which the plaintiffs complain. Id.  \n  While the court cannot definitively say that none of the plaintiffs have \nstanding to bring this suit, the defendants have raised valid concerns, and the \nplaintiffs—each of whom appears to have different bases upon which to assert \nstanding—have provided little to support their claims in that regard. \n  B.  Motion for Injunctive Relief \n  Judge Conley stated the standard for determining whether to grant \ninjunctive relief. \nThe standard for determining whether a preliminary injunction or a \ntemporary restraining order is appropriate is the same. See Planned \nParenthood of Wis. v. Van Hollen, 963 F. Supp. 858, 865 (W.D. Wis. \n2013) (citing Winnig v. Sellen, 731 F. Supp. 2d 855, 857 (W.D. Wis. \n2011)). Specifically, a plaintiff must first show “(1) that he will suffer \nirreparable  harm  absent  preliminary  injunctive  relief  during  the \npendency of his action; (2) inadequate remedies at law exist; and (3) \nhe has a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits.” Whitaker \nBy Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Distr. No. 1 Bd. Of Educ., 858 \nF.3d 1034, 1044 (7th Cir. 2017) (citing Turnell v. CentiMark Corp., \n796 F.3d 656, 662 (7th Cir. 2015)). Then, if this initial showing is \nsuccessfully made, “the court must engage in a balancing analysis, \nto determine whether the balance of harm favors the moving party \nor  whether  the  harm  to  other  parties  or  the  public  sufficiently \noutweighs the movant’s interests.” Id. (citing Jones v. Markiewicz-\nQualkinbush, 842 F.3d 1053, 1057 (7th Cir. 2016)). \n \nDemocratic Nat’l Committee v. Bostelmann, 2020 WL 1638374, at *10. \n17 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 17 of 23   Document 25\n\n \n  While the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction does not specify \nthe injunctive relief the plaintiffs request, the complaint seeks four forms of \nrelief. It asks the court to postpone the April 7, 2020 in-person election until \nSeptember 8, 2020. Dkt. No. 1 at 25. It asks the court “to permit early voting to \ncontinue” (although the complaint alleges that early voting was suspended on \nMarch 22, 2020—twelve days before the plaintiffs filed the complaint). Id. at \n26. It asks the court to extend the deadline for registering to vote electronically \nor by mail to September 8, 2020. Id. at 26. And it asks the court to “cancel” in-\nperson registration and in-person voting—in other words, to order that people \nwho show up in person to register or vote not be allowed to do so. Id. \n  Judge Conley concluded that the threatened loss of constitutional rights \nconstituted irreparable harm. Democratic Nat’l Committee v. Bostelmann, 2020 \nWL 1638374, at *11. This court agrees. He looked at each of the plaintiffs’ \nrequests to determine whether the plaintiffs had a reasonable likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits as to that request, then conducted the balancing of \nharms.  \n  Judge Conley found that while the plaintiffs might have some likelihood \nof success on the merits of their claim seeking postponement of the April 7, \n2020 election, id. at *13, “concerns as to the propriety of a federal court taking \nthe extraordinary step of delaying a state-wide election at the last minute, and \nthe federalism problems that are necessarily implicated, . . . weigh[ed] heavily \nin favor of denying” the plaintiffs’ request that he enjoin the election from \ntaking place on April 7, id. at *15. The plaintiffs in that case did not appeal this \n18 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 18 of 23   Document 25\n\n \ndetermination. This is the same relief the plaintiffs in this case request in their \nfirst form of relief. \n  Judge Conley granted the plaintiffs’ request to extend the deadline by \nwhich absentee ballots could be received (a request the Wisconsin Election \nCommission did not oppose), finding that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a \nlikelihood of success on the merits and that the balance of harms favored \ngranting the relief. Id. at *17. He also extended the deadline by which voters \ncould request absentee ballots by a day. Id. at *18. And he granted the \nplaintiffs’ request to enjoin the requirement that an absentee ballot be signed \nby a witness, to the extent that he ordered the defendants to accept an \nunwitnessed ballot “that contains a written affirmation or other statement by \nan absentee voter that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he or she was unable to \nsafely obtain a witness certification despite his or her reasonable efforts to do \nso, provided that the ballot is otherwise valid,” and leaving it up to the \n“individual discretion of clerks as to whether to accept a voter’s excuse for not \ncompleting the witness certification requirement based on the written \naffirmation by the individual voter.” Id. at *20.  \n  The second, third and fourth forms of relief the plaintiffs have asked of \nthis court are dependent on the court’s granting their first request—the request \nto postpone the election. They also are more extensive in time and nature than \nthe requests Judge Conley granted in the cases before him. The Supreme \nCourt’s decision on the appeal of Judge Conley’s rulings supports the \nconclusion that this court cannot grant the relief the plaintiffs request. \n19 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 19 of 23   Document 25\n\n \n  The Supreme Court’s per curiam decision considered the question of \n“whether absentee ballots now must be mailed and postmarked by election \nday, Tuesday, April 7, as state law would necessarily require, or instead may be \nmailed and postmarked after election day, so long as they are received by \nMonday, April 13.” Republican Nat’l Committee v. Democratic Nat’l Committee, \n589 U.S. ___, Case No. 19A1016, at *1 (April 6, 2020). In holding that the \ndistrict court erred in ordering that absentee ballots mailed and postmarked \nafter April 7, 2020 could be counted if received by April 13, 2020, the Supreme \nCourt stated that \n[b]y changing the election rules so close to the election date and by \naffording relief that the plaintiffs themselves did not ask for in their \npreliminary injunction motions, the District Court contravened this \nCourt’s precedents and erred by ordering such relief. This Court has \nrepeatedly emphasized that lower federal courts should ordinarily \nnot alter the election rules on the eve of an election. See Purcell v. \nGonzalez, 549 U.S. 1 (2006) (per curiam); Frank v. Walker, 574 U.S. \n929 (2014); Veasy v. Perry, 574 U.S. ___ (2014). \n \nId. at *2. \n  The Court emphasized that its decision “on the narrow question before \nthe Court should not be viewed as expressing an opinion on the broader \nquestion of whether to hold the election, or whether other reforms or \nmodifications in election procedures in light of COVID-19 are appropriate. That \npoint cannot be stressed enough.” Id. at 4. But this court does not read that \nlanguage as indicating that a federal district court should make those \ndecisions, and it agrees with Judge Conley that for a federal district court to \ntake the extraordinary step of ordering the delay of a state-wide election raises \n20 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 20 of 23   Document 25\n\n \nfederalism concerns that weigh against the court granting the relief the \nplaintiffs request.4  \n  The fact remains that “[a] preliminary injunction is an extraordinary \nremedy never awarded as of right.” Orr v. Shicker, Nos. 19-1380, 19-1387 & \n19-1732, 2020 WL 1329659, at *8 (7th Cir. Mar. 23, 2020) (quoting Winter v. \nNat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008)). A preliminary injunction “is \nan exercise of a vary far-reaching power, never to be indulged in except in a \ncase clearly demanding it.” Id. (quoting Girl Scouts of Manitou Council, Inc. v. \nGirl Scouts of U.S. of Am., Inc., 549 F.3d 1079, 1085 (7th Cir. 2008)). The \nplaintiffs have not presented sufficient legal analysis or evidence that these \nparticular plaintiffs will be disenfranchised to allow the court to exercise that \nfar-reaching power. \n  That is not to say that the circumstances that gave rise to the filing of \nthis complaint, and the complaints in the cases before Judges Conley and \nGriesbach, are not extraordinary. “Extraordinary” seems too mild a word. As \nthe court writes, this election is scheduled to take place during what United \nSates Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams has warned will be “the hardest and \nsaddest week of most Americans’ lives.” https://www.washingtonpost.com/ \nworld/2020/04/06/coronvirus-latest-news/. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the senior \ninfectious disease specialist on the White House coronavirus task force, has \nstated, “Things are going to get bad and we need to be prepared for that. It’s \n \n4 The court also acknowledges that the Supreme Court was concerned with a \ncourt granting relief a party did not request; here, the parties have requested \nspecific relief and the court has considered only the relief requested. \n21 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 21 of 23   Document 25\n\n \ngoing to be shocking to some and it certainly is really disturbing to see that . . . \njust buckle down.” https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/06/fauci-surgeon-\ngeneral-adams-prepare-americans-for-hardest-moment/. In the last week—\nsince March 30, 2020—confirmed cases in Wisconsin have jumped from 1,221 \non March 30 to 2,440 on April 6; in Milwaukee alone, confirmed cases have \nskyrocketed from 617 on March 30 to 1,256 on April 6. https://www/dhs/ \nwisconsin.gov/covid-19/index.htm. Officials from the Centers for Disease \nControl are in Milwaukee to try to learn how the virus is being transmitted; \nthey are studying the rapid spread of the virus on the north side of Milwaukee. \nhttps://www.jsonline.com/story/news/health/2020/03/27/cdc-coronavirus-\nteams-milwaukee-study-secondary-spread/2919654001/. The north side \nincludes the 53206 zip code referenced by the plaintiffs. The Journal Sentinel \nhas reported on April 3, 2020 that of the forty-five people confirmed dead in \nMilwaukee County as a result of the virus, at least thirty-three were African \nAmerican. https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2020/04/03/african-\namericans-milwaukee-hit-hard-coronavirus/5111950002/. Over the afternoon \nand evening hours of April 6, 2020, this court’s staff received a flood of \ntelephone calls and emails from individuals asking the court to postpone the \nprimary election, then to uphold Executive Order #74.   \n  Despite all this, it appears that tomorrow morning, those who have not \nyet voted will face a grim choice: go out to the polling places (the ones that are \nopen) and risk being exposed to the virus or spreading it to their friends and \nneighbors, or forego one of the most sacred rights of citizenship—the right to \n22 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/06/20   Page 22 of 23   Document 25\n\n \nhave a say in the governance of their communities, their state and their nation. \n“Extraordinary” is a feeble description of the circumstances that appear to be \nleading to that choice. But this court must hold, as Judge Conley did, that this \nfederal court does not have the authority “to act as the state’s chief health \nofficial” by making the decision that needs to be made to put the health and \nsafety of the community first. \nIV.  Conclusion \n  The court DENIES the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.

NO. 20) AND DISMISSING CASE \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \n  The plaintiffs filed this complaint (combined with a motion for injunctive \nand declaratory relief) on April 3, 2020, the Friday before before the Tuesay, \nApril 7 date scheduled for the Wisconsin spring election. Dkt. No. 1. The \ndocument asked this court to issue an order postponing the spring election, \npermitting early voting to continue, extending the deadline for registering to \nvote electronically or by mail and canceling in-person registration and absentee \nvoting. Id. at 25-26. The reason for the request was the COVID-19 crisis.  \n1 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 05/12/20   Page 1 of 3   Document 28\n\n \n  Three days later—Monday, April 6, 2020, the day before the election was \nto take place—the Wisconsin Legislature filed a motion to intervene as a \ndefendant. Dkt. No. 16. It also filed a proposed motion to dismiss the complaint \nand the motion for preliminary injunctive relief (proposed because the court \nhad not yet ruled on the motion to intervene). Dkt. No. 20.  \n  Later in the day on April 6, the court held a hearing on the motion for \npreliminary injunctive relief. Dkt. Nos. 24, 26. It then issued an order denying \nthat motion. Dkt. No. 25.  \n  Presumably because the denial of the motion for preliminary injunctive \nrelief denied the plaintiffs the relief they requested in the complaint, the \nplaintiffs did not respond to the Wisconsin Legislature’s motions within the \ntwenty-one days allowed by Civil Local Rule 7(b) (E.D. Wis.). Not wanting to \nassume, however, the court issued a text-only order on April 29, 2020, ordering \nthat any party wishing to oppose the Wisconsin Legislature’s motions must do \nso in time for the court to receive that opposition by the end of the day on May \n8, 2020. Dkt. No. 27. The order advised the parties that if it did not receive any \nopposition briefs by that deadline, it would rule on the Legislature’s motions \nwithout a hearing and without further input from the parties. Id. \n  May 8, 2020 has come and gone, and the court has received no \nopposition briefs from any party. \n  The court GRANTS the Wisconsin Legislature’s motion to intervene as a \ndefendant. Dkt.

Strouse  of Strouse  Law Offices  and  Thomas  Napierala  of \nNapierala Law Offices bring this emergency motion for a temporary restraining \norder  and  preliminary  injunction  on  behalf  of  Lena  Taylor,  Tory  Lowe  and \nJustice Wisconsin Inc., against the above named defendant Commissions and \ntheir  officials  in  their  official  capacities  only,  to  address  voter \ndisenfranchisement, particularly of African American voters in the 53206 U.S. \nPostal Service zip code, for the April 7, 2020 election given the current state of \naffairs. The State of Wisconsin, along with the rest of the world, is in the midst of \na public health crisis as a result of the rapid spread of COVID-19 through its \ncommunities causing Milwaukee to be the epicenter of the State of Wisconsin.   \n \n“No right is more precious in a free country than having a voice in the \nelection ofthose who make the laws under which, as good citizens, we must \nlive.” Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 560 (1964). “Other rights, even the most \nbasic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined.”Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. \n1, 17 (1964). \n  \nOn  March  31,  2020  the  Wisconsin  Legislative  Reference  Bureau  issued  a \nmemorandum.  It is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.  It states in part, \n“While  the  statutes  do  not  mandate  specific  times  or  a  minimum \nnumber of hours where in-person absentee voting must take place, the clear \nintent is that electors have reasonable opportunities to exercise those rights \nand that clerks must offer in-person absentee voting”. \n \n \nThe Myth of Low African American Voter Turnout: \n“Some city and state elections further debunk the stereotype that Blacks don’t \nvote. Cities electing their first Black mayors, such as Little Rock’s Frank Scott and \nBirmingham’s Randall Woodfin, had high voter turnouts, particularly among \nBlacks. In fact, Brookings’s Andre Perry reported that the high turnout of Black \nvoters, especially Black women, in Birmingham actually propelled Doug Jones to \nthe Senate. In the governor races in Georgia and Florida, involving candidates \n  2\nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/03/20   Page 2 of 27   Document 1\n\nStacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum, respectively, voter turnout among Blacks \nwas  also high.  Noting  this  in  Florida  is  particularly  relevant  since an \namendment restored voting rights to over 1 million state residents. Nearly one-\nquarter of Blacks in Florida could not vote before the November 2018 midterm \nelections. Research notes that incarceration for Blacks has also been used as a \nform of voter disenfranchisement.” \n \nRashawn Ray and Mark Whitlock Brookings 9/12/2019 (See Ex. 2) \n \n \n  Parties \n \n1.

Actions  taken  by  the  Milwaukee  Election  Commission \namount to an abridgement of the right of African Americans to cast their vote, or \nto be registered to vote in the April 7, 2020 City of Milwaukee Election.  The \nclosing early voting and voter registration, creation of an internet vote, while at \nthe same time all libraries are closed barring more than half of 6th District/53206 \n  5\nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/03/20   Page 5 of 27   Document 1\n\nvoters who have no internet access from voting.  Further “drive-thru drop-off \nvoting”  is  not  an  option  for  6th  District/53206  since  most  rely  on  public \ntransportation.  The Milwaukee Election Commission violated and continues to \nviolate Federal and State law because; under “the totality of the circumstances” \n6th District/53206 voters, who are 94% African American have less opportunity to \nparticipate in the political process.  This complaint requests that this Court issue \nan injunction against the pending April 7, 2020 City of Milwaukee Election for \nthe reasons set out herein.   \nCOVID-19: \nCOVID-19 is a pandemic of epic proportions medically and economically \nravaging The Earth’s population.  Currently the United States is the epicenter of \nthe COVID-19 outbreak.  Milwaukee is the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak \nin the State of Wisconsin and African American voters who reside in the 53206-\nzip code and are primarily located within the 6th Aldermanic District of The City \nof Milwaukee, have experienced the highest rate of deaths and infections as of \nthe date of this filing. Governor Evers called the situation, “a crisis within a \ncrisis” Wisconsin Public Radio 3/27/2020 by Corrinne Hess (See Exhibit 3).  To \nunderscore the gravity of the situation Major League Baseball (“MLB”) and every \nother sporting league of a national, regional and local level have postponed their \nseasons.    The  Democratic  National  Convention,  scheduled  this  summer  in \n  6\nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/03/20   Page 6 of 27   Document 1\n\nMilwaukee, has also been postponed.  Schools across the country are shut down.  \nAmerican business has ground to a devastating halt.  Currently, the American \nhealthcare infrastructure is beginning to buckle under the onslaught in New \nYork,  Chicago,  New  Orleans  and  Seattle  which  are  anticipating  being \noverwhelmed by sick patients.   \nDespite  the  pandemic  The  Wisconsin  Elections  Commission  has  not \nsought to postpone the election. Without authority to  do so, The Milwaukee \nElection  Commission  made  unlawful  changes  to  the  election  rules  which \ndisproportionately restrict African American voters who reside in the 53206-zip \ncode.  The 53206-zip code is primarily located within the 6th Aldermanic District \nof The City of Milwaukee.  The Milwaukee Election Commission cancelled early \nvoting for weeks, despite higher than expected voter turnout as reported by \nWTMJ and FOX6 News (See Exhibits 5 and 6).  Weeks later, having stymied early \nvoting, The Milwaukee Election Commission essentially moved the April 7, 2020 \nelection on-line.  94% of the residents in the 53206-zip code are African American \naccording to the Census, (See Census Reporter, Ex. 7).  Most residents do not \nhave home internet service and Milwaukee has closed its public library system \n(See  Lowe  Declaration  at  5  and  Exhibit  8,  listing  of  all  libraries  closed  in \nMilwaukee).  These restrictions encourage voters from the highest infection rate \nfor  COVID-19  in  the  city  to  use  public  transportation,  during  a  statewide \n  7\nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/03/20   Page 7 of 27   Document 1\n\nlockdown, cast their vote in a “drive-by” polling place, apparently from a bus, \nand then return home by public transportation.   \nThe Milwaukee Election Commission has/had no authority to freeze early \nvoting. \n“The election laws do not provide local elected officials the authority to \nplace limits on or eliminate registration or voting options established by \nthe statutes absent directives from state or local health officials…” \n \nWisconsin Elections Commission 3/18/2020 (Ex. 4A, p. 2) \n \nThe Milwaukee Election Commission canceled in-person early voting for \nthe April 7th Spring Election 2020. Early voting was scheduled to run every day, \nincluding the weekends, from Monday, March 23rd through April 5th. Unlike on \nelection day, the city uses a touch screen voting machine that prints a paper \nballot  to  conduct  early  voting.    The Milwaukee  Election  Commission  has \nencouraged voters to request an absentee ballot for the spring election, a measure \nsuggested repeatedly by Mayor Tom Barrett and Governor Tony Evers.   \n \nA.  The Milwaukee Election Commission Has Primarily Moved the Election \nOnline \n \n“Milwaukee  County  Clerk  George  Christenson  wrote  in  a  letter posted  to \nFacebook Wednesday that he had informed municipal clerks in the county that \nthis is an appropriate course of action during the coronavirus outbreak and given \nGov. Tony Evers’ stay-at-home order and guidance from the Wisconsin Elections \nCommission. \n \n  8\nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/03/20   Page 8 of 27   Document 1\n\n“I urge all voters who request a ballot and do not have the ability or equipment \nto upload a valid ID to indicate that they are indefinitely confined,” he wrote. \n“Voters should not be reluctant to check the box that says they are indefinitely \nconfined because this is a pandemic and this option exists in state law to help \npreserve everyone’s right to vote.” \n \nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel March 25, 2020 (See Exhibit 9) \n \nB.  The  “Internet  Election”  is  Constitutionally  Prohibited  Because  it \nAbridges the African American Vote in the 6th District/53206  \n \n \n“53206 is Milwaukee’s archetypical concentrated poverty neighborhood” \n \nMilwaukee 53206: The Anatomy of Concentrated Disadvantage in an Inner City \nNeighborhood 2000-2017 (p. 28) Marc V. Levine, University of Wisconsin-\nMilwaukee March 2019. (See Exhibit 10) \n \n“Milwaukee  53206  is  a  neighborhood  of  low  employment  rates,  low  wages, \nshrinking income, high poverty, poor housing, and mass incarceration.”  Id. \n \n1.  The totality of circumstances demonstrates that voters in 6th District/53206 \nhave “less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate \nin the political process” than others See 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b). \n \n2.  The  largest  53206  racial/ethnic  groups  are  Black  (94.3%)  followed  by \nHispanic (1.6%) and Two or More (1.6%). \n3.  The Milwaukee  Election  Commission  has  established  that  the  primary \nmethod to vote in City’s April election is by requesting a ballot on-line, or \nto have scrambled to obtain one by mail-last minute after early voting was \nshut down. \n  9\nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/03/20   Page 9 of 27   Document 1\n\n4.  The U.S. Census Bureau found that 93 percent of Wisconsin households \nwith at least $75,000 in annual income had access to broadband from 2013 \nto 2017.  But only half of those households with less than $20,000 in annual \nincome had access. Appleton Post-Crescent (See Ex. 11, Keegan, Kyle Dec. 6, \n2018). \n5.  “Joblessness is pervasive in 53206; but even for those residents who have \nsecured employment, working poverty is omnipresent.  Median annual \nearnings for 53206 working in 2017 were $18,541. Milwaukee 53206: The \nAnatomy of Concentrated Disadvantage in an Inner City Neighborhood 2000-\n2017 (See Exhibit 12 Executive Summary Marc V. Levine, University of \nWisconsin-Milwaukee March 2019). \n6.  That it is not realistic to think that the even has 46.5% internet access (See \nAlso Declaration of Tory Lowe at 7). \n7.  That  one  source  of  internet  access  for  the  more  than  50%  of  6th \nDistrict/53206  voters  could  ordinarily  receive  internet  access  by  using \ncomputers at the Milwaukee Public Library, which would have served as \n“government service centers” for the election. \n8.  All  of  the  Milwaukee  Public  Library  branches  are  closed  due  to  the \nCOVID-19 pandemic (See Ex. 8). \n  10\nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/03/20   Page 10 of 27   Document 1\n\n9.  The  Milwaukee  Election  Commission  did  not  provide  any  reasonable \nalternative for the voters of 6th District/53206 in light of the closed the \nMilwaukee Public Library System.  The result and context in view of the \ntotality  of  the  circumstances  is  that  African  American  voters  of  6th \nDistrict/53206  are  being  unfairly  denied  access  to  the  April  7,  2020 \nelection: \n“The order does, however, exempt some facilities which could impact the \nconduct  of  elections.    The  order  specifically  exempts,  “state  and  local \ngovernment facilities, including government service centers…” \n \nWisconsin Elections Commission 3/18/2020 (Ex. 4, p.7) \n \n \n10. That since more than 50% 6th District/53206 voters were barred by the \nMilwaukee  Election  Commission  in  casting  their  early  vote,  have  no \ninternet access at home or at their library (the government service center) \nthese voters are forced to scramble to mail off a request for a absentee \nballot in an ever narrowing amount of time before April 7, 2020. \n“While clerks have attempted to place emergency orders of these envelopes \nwith their usual printers to meet demand, there is a statewide shortage of the \nenvelope material that is normally used.” Id. at 4. \n \nC.

The Milwaukee Election Commission has also encouraged drive-by drop \noff  voting  but  made  no  equal  provision  for  those  who  use  public \ntransport. \n12. People  who  cannot  afford  internet  typically  can’t  afford  a  personal \nvehicle. \n13. The  Milwaukee  Election  Commission’s  actions  ensure  that  6th \nDistrict/53206 voters, which are suffering the highest COVID-19 infections \nand death rates in the city are encouraged to take public transportation, \nduring a pandemic lock down to vote.  It is difficult to imagine how the \nMilwaukee Election Commission could have encouraged a more reckless \nsolution to voting than to encourage travel during a time of crisis. \n \nD.  Special Voting Deputies Have Been Discontinued in Care Facilities \n \n  12\nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/03/20   Page 12 of 27   Document 1\n\n“Municipalities  shall  not  use  the  Special  Voting  Deputy  Process  to  serve \nresidents in care facilities for these two elections….” \n \nWisconsin Elections Commission 3/18/2020 (Ex. 4B, p.2) \n \n \n14. In  addition  to  suspension  of  early  voting  by  the  Milwaukee  Election \nCommission, the Wisconsin Election Commission also suspended the use \nof Special Voting Deputies for residents in Care Facilities, many of which \nare left to scramble for ballots by mail, if available, or access ballots by \ninternet. \n “In  the  10 years I  have  worked  in the  53206  as  Civil  Rights Advocate  and \nthrough expanded outreach by Justice Wisconsin it has been my experience that \nthe majority of nursing home and retirement community residents who are over \n55 years old, either have no internet service or are not knowledgeable enough to \nuse  the  internet  if  they  do  have  access  and  cannot  access  the  internet  on \ngovernment cell phones which the majority of the seniors use in the 6th District \nand/or the 53206 area code.  In short, these seniors will be disenfranchised by the \nabsence of a Special Voting Deputy Process” \n \nTory Lowe Declaration at 9 \n15.

In  addition  to  suspension  of  early  voting  by  the  Milwaukee  Election \nCommission, the Wisconsin Election Commission also suspended the use \nof Special Voting Deputies for residents in Care Facilities, many of which \nare left to scramble for ballots by mail, if available, or access ballots by \ninternet. \n17. The residents of Care Facilities are the most vulnerable voters to COVID-\n19  and  cannot  be  rationally  expected  to  travel    thereby  the  African \nAmerican resident in 6th District/53206 is being denied equal access to \nvote, since they cannot access the internet by way of comparison to a non-\n6th District/53206 voter and because the Wisconsin Election Commission \nalso suspended the use of Special Voting Deputies. \n  14\nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/03/20   Page 14 of 27   Document 1\n\n \nE.  Same Day Registration is Equally Denied for the Voters in the 6th \nDistrict/53206 \n \n18.  Historically,  Wisconsin  voters  rely  heavily  on  same-day  voter \nregistration. Since  2008,  ten  to  fifteen  percent  of  all registrations have \noccurred  at  a  polling  place  on  election  day.  Wis.  Elections  Comm’n, \nGeneral Election Voter Registration and Absentee Statistics 1984-2016, available \nat  https://elections.wi.gov/elections-voting/statistics?q=elections-\nvoting/statistics&page=2 (last visited March 30, 2020).  \n19. Under  the  totality  of  the  circumstances  the  Wisconsin  Election \nCommission  placed  an  undue  burden  on  voting  access  on  the  6th \nDistrict/53206  voters,  who  are  overwhelmingly  poor  and  African \nAmerican. \n20. As noted above these voters have restricted internet access by income and \nthe “business service center” for internet access, the Milwaukee Public \nLibrary, is closed with no alternative access made available. \n21. Furthermore, Care Centers will no longer host Special Voting Deputies for \na population who either lacks the technical knowledge of navigating the \ninternet or has no access to it or both. \n22.  In  short,  both  Milwaukee  Election  Commission  and  the  Wisconsin \nElection Commission will force the 6th District/53206 voters, young and \n  15\nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/03/20   Page 15 of 27   Document 1\n\nold, to take public transportation to and from the most COVID-19 infested \ndistrict  (both  ways)  to  cast  a  ballot  at  a  “drive-by”  location  during  a \nstatewide pandemic driven lockdown order. \n \nJurisdiction and Venue \n \n23. This is a civil rights action arising under the First, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, \nand Twenty-Sixth Amendments to the Constitution, and Section 2 of the \nVoting Rights Act. 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1988; 52 U.S.C. § 10301. \n24. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n25. Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C § 1391 because the events \ngiving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims arose, and Defendants are located, in this \nDistrict and Division. \n26. This  Court  has  personal  jurisdiction  over  the  Defendants,  the \nCommissioners  of  both  the  Milwaukee  Election  Commission  and  the \nWisconsin  Elections  Commission,  Secretary-Designee  of  the  Wisconsin \nDepartment  of  Health  Services,  and  the  Governor  of  the  State  of \nWisconsin, who are sued in their official capacity only.  \n27. Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because Plaintiffs \nand Defendants are residents of Wisconsin, and Plaintiffs reside in this \nDistrict.  \n \n  16\nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/03/20   Page 16 of 27   Document 1\n\nStanding \n28. Plaintiffs  have  a  “legally  protectable  interest  in  this  litigation.”  Lopez-\nAguilar, 924 F.3d at 391. The Seventh Circuit has embraced the Supreme \nCourt’s  approach  of  “encouraging  liberality  in  the  definition  of  an \ninterest.” Id. at 392 (quoting Meridian Homes Corp. v. Nicholas W. Prassas & \nCo.,  683  F.2d  201,  204  (7th  Cir.  1982).).  Plaintiffs  satisfy  this  liberal \nstandard.   \na.  Lena Taylor is a candidate for Mayor and represents voters in the \n6th District/53206. \nb.  Tory Lowe is a candidate for Milwaukee’s 6th Aldermanic District. \nWhich encompasses 6th District/53206. \nc.

Finally, Carolyn Carroll is a voter who is denied equal access to the \nvote by way of comparison to white or other voters within the City \nof Milwaukee.  \n29. Plaintiffs  have  “direct”  and  “significant”  interests  in  the  continued \nenforcement  of  state  laws,  governing  early  voting  and  registration, \nabsentee ballots, and equal access to vote , “as those laws are designed to \n  17\nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/03/20   Page 17 of 27   Document 1\n\nserve  “the  integrity  of  [the]  election  process,”  Eu  v.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all data from above and \nparagraphs 1 through 29 as though fully set forth herein.  \n \n31. Under the Equal Protection Clause, a state cannot utilize election practices \nthat unduly burden the right to vote.  \n \n32. As set out above both Milwaukee Election Commission and the Wisconsin \nElections  Commission  are  currently  utilizing  election  practices  which \nunduly burden the vote for voters of the 6th District/53206. \n \n33. The  Milwaukee  Election  Commission  does  not  have  a  constitutional \nobligation to provide early voting, having adopted early voting, The City \nmay not “by later arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one person’s \nvote over that of another.” Obama For Am. v.

The Milwaukee Election Commission further discontinued early voting \nsites based on community geography and population, limiting their ability \nto ensure that all voters in a county have an equal opportunity to cast an \nearly ballot, then confining the election to the internet and/or a drive-\nby/drop-off procedure, when most people in 6th District/53206 don’t have \ninternet access and cannot go to the Milwaukee Public Library as their \n“government service station” for access. \n  18\nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/03/20   Page 18 of 27   Document 1\n\n \n35. By way of comparison voters who are white or other races who live in \nmore affluent areas of the city, have a far higher incidence of internet \naccess and are far less likely to rely on public transportation to vote. \n \n36. The  Wisconsin  election  Commission  discontinued  the  Special  Voting \nDeputy process for care facilities and the most vulnerable voters qualified \nto vote in the 6th Aldermanic District 6th District/53206, will have no access \nfor  reasons  stated  above,  or  will  be  far  more  likely to rely  on public \ntransportation to vote, which under COVID-19, may be a death sentence.   \n \na.  “Municipalities shall not use the Special Voting Deputy Process \nto  serve  residents  in  care  facilities  for  these  two \nelections….”Wisconsin Elections Commission 3/18/2020 (Ex. 4B, p.2) \n \n37. Absent relief from this Court, Plaintiffs, many of their constituents and/or \nmembers and those among their constituency, have been and continue to \nbe denied this opportunity to have an equal opportunity to cast an early \nvote.  \n \n38. The burden of the current restrictive application of early voting in the \nCity,  further,  falls  heaviest  on  African  American  residents  of  the  6th \nDistrict/53206.  \n \n39. In this case, the Court must carefully balance the character and magnitude \nof injury to the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights that the plaintiffs \nseek to vindicate against the justifications put forward by the State for the \nburdens imposed by the rule. See Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 \n(1992); Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 789 (1983). “However slight \nth[e]  burden  may  appear,  .  .  .  it  must  be  justified  by  relevant  and \nlegitimate  state  interests  sufficiently  weighty  to  justify  the  limitation.” \nCrawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 191 (2008) (Stevens, J., \ncontrolling op.) (quotation marks omitted).  \n \n40. The  Milwaukee  Election  Commission  has  a  legitimate  interest  in \nprotecting  the  public  health,  safety,  and  welfare  from  the  continued \nspread of COVID-19.  \n \n  19\nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/03/20   Page 19 of 27   Document 1\n\n41. The  Milwaukee  Election  Commission  also  has  a  constitutional  and \ndemocratic obligation to administer a free and fair election that protects \nthe voting rights of all its constituents.  \n \n42. The  Milwaukee  Election  Commission  has  instituted  policies  which \nabridge and make it more difficult for African Americans to vote in the \nApril 7, 2020 election in 6th District/53206 than it does for non-African \nAmericans. \n \n43.  In  viewing  the  effect  on  the  April  7,  2020  from  a  totality  of  the \ncircumstances the Milwaukee Election Commission has failed to institute \nan election process to ensure a free and fair election that protects the \nvoting  rights  of  6th  District/53206  who  have  been  and  continue  to  be \ndenied equal access to the political process.  \n \n44. Because of these failures, Milwaukee Election Commission is not able to \nadequately meet its obligation to protect the public health, safety, and \nwelfare, or administer a free and fair election that protects the voting \nrights of all its constituents.  \n \n45. Here, the Milwaukee Election Commission application of the Early Vote \nStatute  clearly  burdens  the  Plaintiffs’  (and  in  the  case  of  the  Justice \nWisconsin, their mission, as well as their members’ and constituencies’) \nright to vote. See Husted, 888 F. Supp. 2d at 907 (holding restrictions on \ntimes of early voting violated voters’ right to vote), aff’d, 697 F.3d 423 (6th \nCir. 2012); see also Sanchez v. Cegavske, 214 F. Supp. 3d 961, 974 (D. Nev. \n2016) (holding “distance Plaintiffs must travel and the associated costs [to \nvote  early  at  certain  locations]  are  a  material  limitation”  on  voting); \nFlorida, 885 F. Supp. 2d at 329 - recognizing that restrictions on early \nvoting in Florida “would impose a sufficiently material burden to cause \nsome reasonable . . . voters not to vote” in Voting Rights Act context. \n \n46. In  viewing  the  effect  on  the  April  7,  2020  from  a  totality  of  the \ncircumstances the Wisconsin Election Commission has failed to institute \nan election process to ensure a free and fair election that protects the \nvoting rights of all its constituents in light of the COVID-19 Pandemic.  \n \n47. The  Wisconsin  Election  Commission  discontinued  the  Special  Voting \nDeputy process for care facilities and the most vulnerable voters qualified \nto vote in the 6th District/53206, will have no access for reasons stated \n  20\nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/03/20   Page 20 of 27   Document 1\n\nabove, or will be far more likely to rely on public transportation to vote, \nwhich under COVID-19, may be a death sentence.   \n \na.  “Municipalities shall not use the Special Voting Deputy Process \nto  serve  residents  in  care  facilities  for  these  two \nelections….”Wisconsin Elections Commission 3/18/2020 (Ex. 4B, p.2). \n \n \n48. The Wisconsin Election Commission has a legitimate interest in protecting \nthe  public  health,  safety,  and  welfare  from  the  continued  spread  of \nCOVID-19.  \n \n49. The  Wisconsin  Election  Commission  also  has  a  constitutional  and \ndemocratic obligation to administer a free and fair election that protects \nthe voting rights of all its constituents.  \n \n50. Wisconsin  Election  Commission  have  failed  and  continue  to  fail  to \nimplement any changes to the election process to ensure a free and fair \nelection that protects the voting rights of all its constituents in light of the \nCOVID-19 Pandemic.  \n \n51. Because of these failures, of both The Milwaukee Election Commission \nand the Wisconsin Election Commission is not able to adequately meet its \nobligation to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, or administer a \nfree and  fair  election that protects the voting rights of the District 6th \nDistrict/53206, who are 94% African American.  \n \n52. With the United States increasingly in “stay at home” mode, the only \nreasonable alternative it to postpone this election until September 8, 2020.  \n \n53. Injunctive and declaratory relief is needed to resolve this existing dispute, \nwhich  presents  an  actual  controversy  between  the  The  Milwaukee \nElection  Commission  and  the  Wisconsin  Election  Commission  and \nPlaintiffs, who have adverse legal interests, because of the reasons stated \nabove and to pray for remedy from this Court to serious and concrete \ninjuries  to  their  fundamental  right  to  vote  in  the  City  of  Milwaukee \nGeneral Election. \n \n \nCOUNT 2 \n  21\nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/03/20   Page 21 of 27   Document 1\n\n         52 U.S.C. § 10301 \n§10301.

The  extent  to  which  members  of  a \nprotected  class  have  been  elected  to  office  in  the  State  or  political \nsubdivision is one circumstance which may be considered: Provided, That \nnothing in this section establishes a right to have members of a protected \nclass elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population. \n \n \n54. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference all data from above and \nparagraphs 1 through 53 as though fully set forth herein.  \n \n55. For the reasons set forth above the Defendants have each individually \ninstituted a process which results in a denial or abridgement of the right \nof the 6th District/53206 citizen of the United States to vote on account of \nrace or color, for the reasons set forth above. \n \n \nDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief  \nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act \n52 U.S.C. § 10301 \n \nTo establish its entitlement to preliminary relief, the Plaintiffs must demonstrate \nthat \"(1) without such relief, [it] will suffer irreparable harm before [its] claim is \nfinally resolved; (2) [it] has no adequate remedy at law; and (3) [it] has some \n  22\nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/03/20   Page 22 of 27   Document 1\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits.\" Harlan v. Scholz, 866 F.3d 754, 758 (7th Cir. \n2017). If that burden is met, the court must weigh the harm that the plaintiff will \nsuffer absent an injunction against the harm to the defendant from an injunction \nand consider whether an injunction is in the public interest.  \n \nId.; Higher Soc'y of Indiana v. Tippecanoe Cty., Indiana, 858 F.3d 1113, 1116 (7th Cir. \n2017). \n \n \n“Beyond that, Plaintiffs must show they face irreparable harm absent injunctive \nrelief. This hurdle too has been cleared. First, the Attorney General has imposed \nAugust  deadlines  by  which  Plaintiffs  must  either  accept  the  grant  and  its \nConditions or else decline the funds outright. Because this Court has already \nfound  that  the  Attorney  General  lacks  the  authority  to  impose  any  of  these \nConditions, however, the choice Plaintiffs face—to decline funds or accept them \nupon pain of sacrificing their sovereign powers—is no choice at all and is itself \nsufficient to establish irreparable harm.” \n \nCty. of Santa Clara v.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 78 as \nthough fully set forth herein.  \n \n57.  Plaintiffs filed this verified complaint for relief. \n \n58. Plaintiffs Face Irreparable Injury for the reasons set forth above in that the \n6th District/53206 voter must either must lose their vote or proceed in the \nCOVID-19 environment, by public transportation to vote in the face of \nunprecedented  government  restriction(s)  on  travel.    Accordingly,  the \ncandidates will suffer disenfranchisement of their base support because of \nthese restrictions. \n \n“This means that \"there must be a threat which is present now, although the \nimpact of the threat may not be felt until later.\"  Browning v.

That the injury to the Plaintiffs would constitute  more than a monetary \ninjury in that once the election proceeds there is no reasonable way to \nundo the results, which will be because of voter disenfranchisement in the \n6th District/53206. \n \n“When a party is seeking temporary relief, it must prove that absent such relief, \nit will suffer irreparable harm in the interim period prior to final resolution of its \nclaims,\" and that  traditional legal remedies would be  inadequate.\" (noting the \noverlap  between  no adequate remedy at law  and  \"irreparable  harm\"  in  the \npreliminary  injunction  setting);   Irreparable  harm  is  harm  that  cannot  be \nprevented  or  fully  rectified  by  the  final  judgment  after  trial.   An adequate \nremedy at law is whether interim harm caused by the activity to be enjoined can \nbe completely offset by a subsequent award of damages or other legal relief.” \n \nBader v. Wernert 178 F. Supp. 3rd 703 at 727 (internal citations omitted) \n \n \n61. That had given Plaintiffs no adequate remedy at law:  Had the Defendants \ntaken the reasonable route of postponing the elections, this lawsuit would \nnever have been filed.  Unfortunately, once  the April 7, 2020 election \npasses the disenfranchised voters of 6th District/53206 will have no remedy \nfor  either  having  foregone  their  vote,  or  for  a  cause  of  action  for \ncontracting COVID-19. \n \n  24\nCase 2:20-cv-00545-PP   Filed 04/03/20   Page 24 of 27   Document 1\n\n62. That the Plaintiffs lawsuit has a substantial likelihood of success on the \nmerits. \n \n63. The likelihood of success on  the merits is  an  early measurement  of  the \nquality of the underlying lawsuit, while the likelihood of irreparable harm \ntakes into account how urgent the need for equitable relief really is. \n \n64. Plaintiffs Face Irreparable Injury for the reasons set forth above in that the \n6th  District/53206  voter  must  either  lose  their  vote  or  proceed  in  the \nCOVID-19 environment, by public transportation to vote in the face of \nunprecedented  government  restriction(s)  on  travel.    Accordingly,  the \ncandidates will suffer disenfranchisement of their base support because of \nthese restrictions. \n \n“Where  plaintiff  and  defendant  present  competing  claims  of  injury,  the \ntraditional  function  of  equity  has  been  to  arrive  at  a  \"nice  adjustment  and \nreconciliation\"  between  the  competing  claims.
