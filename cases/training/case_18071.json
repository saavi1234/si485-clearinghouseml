Plaintiffs sought a temporary injunction against the governor's Executive Order suspending in-person voting from the statutorily mandated date of 4/7/20 to 6/9/20. Plaintiffs argued that the governor lacked both the constitutional and statutory authority to a) modify or suspend the statutes and b) set the time, place, and manner of elections.</blockquote></p>",

      "text": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF WISCONSIN \nNo. _________ \nWISCONSIN LEGISLATURE, \nPetitioner, \nv. \nTONY EVERS, IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS GOVERNOR OF \nTHE STATE OF WISCONSIN, \nRespondent. \n        _______________ \n \nEMERGENCY MOTION FOR TEMPORARY INJUNCTION \n        _______________ \n \nThe  Wisconsin  Legislature  hereby  moves  this  Court, \npursuant to Wis. Stat. §§ 813.02, 809.14, for an immediate order \nenjoining  Executive  Order  74,  which,  among  other  things \n“suspend[s] in-person voting for April 7, 2020, until June 9, 2020.”  \nExecutive Order 74 (April 6, 2020).1  The Legislature has also filed, \nsimultaneous with this motion, an Emergency Petition for Original \n \n1  Available  at  https://evers.wi.gov/Documents/COVID19/EO074-\nSuspendingInPersonVotingAndSpecialSession.pdf. \n- 1 - \n\nAction and a Memorandum in Support of the Emergency Petition \nfor  Original  Action  and  Emergency  Motion  for  Temporary \nInjunction.  As explained more fully in the Memorandum, the \nGovernor does not have constitutional or statutory authority to \nmodify, suspend or otherwise alter the statutes.  Nor does the \nGovernor have the constitutional or statutory authority to set the \ntime, place and manner of elections.  That authority belongs to the \nLegislature.  Thus, Executive Order 74 is void to the extent that it \nsuspends or otherwise alters the Wisconsin Statutes and the time, \nplace and manner of elections as set by statute.  It is also void to \nthe extent it purports to alter or otherwise affect the terms of local-\ngovernment officials.   \nGiven that the Governor’s order comes mere hours before the \nin-person  election  is  set  to  begin,  the  Legislature  will  suffer \nirreparable  harm  if  Executive  Order  74  is  not  immediately \nenjoined.  Moreover, such sweeping changes to an election made \njust before the election is set to begin will undoubtedly cause voter \nconfusion  and  call  into  question  the  integrity  of  the  electoral \nprocess. \n- 2 - \n\nThus,  the  Legislature  requests  that  this  Court  issue  an \nimmediate injunction of Executive Order 74.        \nDated: April 6, 2020 \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \nRYAN J. WALSH \nState Bar No. 1091821 \n Counsel of Record \nAMY C. MILLER \nState Bar No. 1101533 \nEIMER STAHL LLP \n10 East Doty Street \nSuite 800 \nMadison, WI 53703 \n(608) 441-5798 \n(608) 441-5707 (fax) \nrwalsh@eimerstahl.com \namiller@eimerstahl.com \n \nAttorneys for the Wisconsin Legislature \n   \n- 3 - \n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \n  A copy of this Motion is being served on all opposing parties \nvia electronic mail and first-class mail. \n  Dated: April 6, 2020 \n \n             \nRyan J.
