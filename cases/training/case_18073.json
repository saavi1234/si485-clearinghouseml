The parties submitted a joint motion for a status conference, or, in the alternative, a stay of all case deadlines pending the resolution of Plaintiff's pending discovery motions. (Dkt. #153). The undersigned held a status conference on 5/14/2024 to discuss the pending motions and case deadlines. (Dkt. #159). During that conference, the undersigned expressed a desire to keep the case moving while the discovery motions are pending, and inquired if the parties had a preference as to the order in which the pending motions should be decided. Plaintiff's counsel stated that it would be most efficient for the Court to decide Plaintiff's motion to compel information withheld on medical privacy grounds (dkt. #134), followed by Plaintiff's motion to compel responses to its second set of interrogatories (dkt. #129). In accordance with the discussion during the status conference, the stay requested in docket entry 153 is GRANTED, except to allow for the inspection of DOC facilities currently being coordinated by the parties. The Court will consider Plaintiff's preferences regarding the order in which the pending motions should be decided. Following the Court's ruling on docket entries #134 and #129, the undersigned will schedule a follow-up status conference to discuss whether the stay should be lifted and, if so, to coordinate with the parties on a new scheduling order.

Telephone connection information will be e-mailed to all appearing counsel by Judge Farrish's courtroom deputy at their e-mail address of record. A date for the settlement conference will be set during the telephone call. Because the parties will likely be ordered to attend the conference, either in-person or via videoconference, counsel are instructed to obtain their client's schedules over the next ninety days and have them available during the pre-conference. Counsel should also have their own calendars available to aid in scheduling. During the telephone call, counsel should be prepared to discuss what, if any, information needs to be exchanged and anything else that needs to be accomplished prior to the settlement conference to maximize its chances of success. If either counsel has a firm, unavoidable conflict at the appointed date and time, e.g., a previously-scheduled appearance in another court, s/he should not file a motion for continuance on the docket but rather should call Chambers at 860-240-3605 as soon as possible with opposing counsel on the line to work out an alternate day and time for the pre-conference with Judge Farrish's law clerk.

    "summary": "<p>This lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut challenged prolonged isolation and in-cell shackling imposed on people with mental illness in the custody of the Connecticut Department of Correction.  Disability Rights Connecticut, a private, nonprofit corporation that is the authorized protection and advocacy system for the State of Connecticut—with statutory authority to pursue legal, administrative, and other appropriate remedies to protect individuals with mental illness receiving care or treatment in the State—filed the case on February 4, 2021.  (An amended complaint followed on February 18, 2021.)   In collaboration with the ACLU of Connecticut, the Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic at Yale Law School, and private counsel, they sued the Connecticut Department of Correction, as well as the Acting Commissioner of the Department and the Warden of the Supermax facility at which these practices are most endemic.  </p><p>The amended complaint contained four primary claims.  Claims brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleged that (1) the prolonged isolation of individuals with serious mental illness, and (2) in-cell shackling of individuals with mental illness constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  A claim under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, asserted that the Department of Correction had violated that Act by failing to make reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures related to prolonged isolation and in-cell shackling to ensure that prisoners with mental illness had meaningful access to services, programs, and activities.  Finally, a claim under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) similarly alleged violation of that Act because the Department of Correction failed to make reasonable modification to its policies, practices, and procedures related to prolonged isolation and in-cell shackling as required for prisoners with mental illness to enjoy meaningful access to services, programs, and activities.     </p><p>Disability Rights Connecticut sought, on behalf of its constituents, a judgment declaring that prolonged isolation and in-cell shackling of prisoners with mental illness constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and that the failure to modify these practices violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  It further sought to permanently enjoin the Department of Correction from subjecting its constituents to prolonged isolation or in-cell shackling and to require the Department to make reasonable modifications to its disciplinary practices to permit meaningful access to services, programs, and activities. Finally, Disability Rights Connecticut requested reasonable attorney’s fees, litigation expenses, and costs.  </p><p>After the defendants moved to dismiss the case, alleging failure to exhaust administrative remedies and that Disability Rights Connecticut lacked standing to sue on behalf of Connecticut inmates with mental illness, they sought a stay of discovery pending resolution of the motion.  Judge Kari A. Dooley granted the stay in part and referred the parties to Magistrate Judge Holly B. Fitzsimmons for settlement discussions.  As of August 24, 2021, settlement discussions were ongoing, and the parties agreed to further stay discovery while they pursued mediation.     </p><p></p>",

Disability Rights Connecticut, Inc. (“DRCT”) seeks to end the persistent and \ndeliberate abuse of people with mental illness who are incarcerated at Connecticut’s super-\nmaximum security Northern Correctional Institution (“Northern”).  The Connecticut Department \nof Correction (“DOC”) subjects prisoners with mental illness at Northern to prolonged, and often \nindefinite, isolation and sensory deprivation, and forcible in-cell shackling that can last for days.  \nThis inhuman treatment of persons with mental illness is physically painful, intentionally \nhumiliating, and causes long-term psychological damage.  DOC’s continuing abuse of, and \ndiscrimination against, people with mental illness must come to an end. \n2.  DOC’s abhorrent mistreatment of prisoners with mental illness constitutes cruel \nand unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 2 of 60\n \nStates Constitution.  DOC’s failure to make reasonable modifications in policies and practices to \navoid trapping these prisoners in a downward spiral of isolation and retribution also denies them \nvirtually all opportunities for rehabilitative and other programming in violation of Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 et seq. (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (“Section 504”), and their respective implementing \nregulations. \n3.  DOC routinely confines individuals with mental illness at Northern where they \nface prolonged isolation and abuse.  Most prisoners spend at least 22 hours per day on weekdays, \nand 24 hours per day on weekends, in concrete cells where they live in a world of near total \nsocial and sensory deprivation.  Their primary connection to the outside world is a small \nopening, or “trap,” at the bottom of a solid steel door.  The only daylight and view outdoors \ncomes through a narrow four-inch-wide slot at the back of each cell.  Meaningful social \ninteraction is nonexistent. \n4.  Northern staff also retaliate against prisoners with mental illness by shackling and \nchaining them alone in “strip cells” for even minor disciplinary violations that are often \nmanifestations of their mental illness.  Northern staff shackle a prisoner’s wrists and legs with \nmetal cuffs and then bind the cuffs with a heavy, metal tether chain.  Prisoners are routinely left \nshackled and chained for 24 hours, and sometimes for days at a time, far longer than justified by \nany genuine threat to safety or security.  While shackled and chained, prisoners are served food \nin Styrofoam cups without utensils.  Many prisoners are unable to even lift a cup to their mouth \nbecause of the shortness of the tether chain; in these instances, the only way for them to consume \nthe contents of the cup is to dump it out on the bed or floor and eat like a dog.  The shortness of \nthe tether chain or the tightness of the cuffs also frequently leaves prisoners unable to wipe \n \n2\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 3 of 60\n \nthemselves after using the toilet.  The experience is degrading and painful.  Many individuals \nhave scars on their wrists and ankles from repeatedly being subjected to in-cell shackling. \n5.  DOC knowingly subjects prisoners with mental illness to Northern’s harsh \nconditions.  Consequently, many prisoners with mental illness commit acts of self-harm or \nmutilation as a result of their near-total isolation and mistreatment.  In an attempt to quell their \nanxiety caused by these inhumane living conditions, persons with mental illness cut their skin, \nbang their heads, or shove sharp objects into their bodies.  These self-injurious behaviors often \ncause lasting injury.  Sometimes these individuals lose all ability to cope, covering the walls and \ntheir bodies with their own excrement.  Some prisoners try to kill themselves.  These self-\ninjurious behaviors and suicide attempts are a direct and predictable result of DOC’s actions.  \nBut DOC responds to these self-injurious behaviors and suicide attempts with even more \nisolation and punitive in-cell shackling. \n6.  DOC, Angel Quiros (Acting Commissioner, DOC), and Roger Bowles (Warden, \nNorthern) (collectively “Defendants”) have implemented and overseen DOC’s policies and \npractices described herein and have not taken any effective action to remedy the longstanding \nand well-known abuse of prisoners with mental illness at Northern.  For more than two decades, \nDOC has known that its isolation and shackling policies and practices put persons with mental \nillness at substantial risk of profound and lasting injury.  Yet, despite a federal lawsuit settlement \nthat expired in 2008 and years-long public pressure, Defendants have failed to take action to \nprotect prisoners with mental illness from abuse.  Defendants have instead acted with deliberate \nindifference to the unconstitutional conditions of confinement and mistreatment of prisoners. \n7.  DRCT, which is authorized by federal law to protect the rights of individuals \ndiagnosed with or experiencing mental illness in Connecticut, brings this action against \n \n3\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 4 of 60\n \nDefendants for declaratory and injunctive relief.  DRCT seeks to stop the prolonged isolation and \nin-cell shackling of prisoners with mental illness at Northern, and to stop DOC’s failure to make \nreasonable modifications to its policies, practices, and procedures. \nJURISDICTION \n8.  Subject-matter jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \nand 1343(a)(3) because this action arises under the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \nthe ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131, et seq., and Section 504, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \nVENUE \n9.  Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because \nDefendants reside in this district and because a substantial part of the events and omissions \ngiving rise to DRCT’s claims occurred in this district. \nPARTIES \nA.  Disability Rights Connecticut, Inc. \n10.  DRCT is a private, nonprofit corporation and is the authorized protection and \nadvocacy system for the State of Connecticut under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals \nwith Mental Illness Act (“PAIMI Act”), 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq., and its implementing \nregulations.  DRCT’s office is located at 846 Wethersfield Avenue, Hartford, Connecticut 06114.  \nDRCT is the successor entity to the State of Connecticut Office of Protection and Advocacy for \nPersons with Disabilities (“OPA”).  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 46a-10a et seq. \n11.  The PAIMI Act provides for establishing and funding protection and advocacy \nsystems, including DRCT, to investigate the abuse and neglect of individuals with mental illness \nand to advocate for and ensure that their rights are protected, including their rights under the \nConstitution and federal and state statutes.  42 U.S.C. §§ 10801(b)(1), 10801(b)(2)(A). \n \n4\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 5 of 60\n \n12.  DRCT is responsible for providing protection and advocacy services to \nindividuals with mental illness and disabilities pursuant to the PAIMI Act. \n13.  DRCT has statutory authority to pursue legal, administrative, and other \nappropriate remedies to ensure the protection of individuals with mental illness who are \nreceiving care or treatment in the State of Connecticut.  42 U.S.C. § 10805. \n14.  DRCT is pursuing this action to advocate for and protect the rights and interests \nof “individuals with mental illness,” as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 10802, who are in DOC’s custody \nand are currently incarcerated at Northern in Administrative Segregation, Security Risk Group, \nor Special Needs Management (“Special Management Programs”) at Northern, or are at risk of \ntransfer to Northern (“DRCT’s Constituents”).  DRCT’s Constituents are the direct beneficiaries \nof DRCT’s activities, including the declaratory and injunctive relief sought in this litigation. \n15.  DRCT’s Constituents have “significant mental illnesses or emotional \nimpairments,” as determined by a mental health professional qualified under the laws and \nregulations of the State of Connecticut.  See 42 U.S.C. § 10802.  The mental illness of DRCT’s \nConstituents substantially limits their ability to perform major life activities, such as self-care, \nworking, and interaction with others.  DRCT’s Constituents are therefore individuals with mental \nillness for purposes of the PAIMI Act, 42 U.S.C. § 10802.  DRCT’s Constituents are also \nindividuals with disabilities for purposes of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), and Section 504, 29 \nU.S.C. § 794.  “Mental illness” is used throughout this Complaint pursuant to its definition under \nthe PAIMI Act.  This definition encompasses individuals with mental illness who have serious \nmental illness or who are at substantial risk of developing serious mental illness. \n16.  DRCT’s Constituents have each suffered injuries, are continuing to suffer injuries, \nand/or are at risk of suffering injuries that make them eligible to bring suit against Defendants in \n \n5\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 6 of 60\n \ntheir own right.  DRCT’s Constituents all reside in “facilities” rendering care and treatment for \nindividuals with mental illness, as that term is defined in 42 U.S.C. § 10802 and 42 C.F.R. \n§ 51.2. \n17.  Consistent with the PAIMI Act, DRCT’s governing structure allows its \nconstituents to express their collective views and protect their collective interests, and to \nparticipate in, significantly influence, and help guide DRCT’s priorities and activities. \n18.  DRCT has established a PAIMI Advisory Council (“Council”) that advises DRCT \non policies and priorities to be carried out in protecting and advocating for the rights of \nindividuals with mental illness.  The Council complies with all requirements of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 10805(a)(6).  The Chair of the Council sits on the Board of Directors of DRCT. \n19.  The Council holds bi-monthly meetings to discuss, evaluate, and advise on \nDRCT’s policies, priorities, procedures, and activities.  The Chair of the Council presents the \nsubstance of the Council’s findings and conclusions to the Board of Directors at the monthly \nBoard meetings.  The Council considers, nominates, and appoints its own members, including its \nChairperson.  DRCT’s Executive Director does not control or take part in the election of new \nmembers to the Council.  Council members may be removed only upon recommendation by the \nCouncil to the Executive Director. \n20.  DRCT has established a grievance procedure whereby persons served under \nPAIMI or their representatives or family members may file a grievance when there is \ndisagreement about a DRCT action or decision.  The grievance procedure is designed “to assure \nthat individuals with mental illness have full access to the services of the system.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 10805(a)(9).  The Council is the final decision-maker with respect to grievances filed by \npersons served under PAIMI or their representatives or family members.  \n \n6\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 7 of 60\n \n21.  The Council, in conjunction with the Executive Director and Board of Directors, \nestablishes DRCT’s PAIMI priorities for each fiscal year at an annual meeting.  \n22.  The Council has voted to include a priority concerning DOC’s in-cell shackling of \nprisoners with mental illness.  The Council has supported and approved DRCT’s efforts to \naddress the prolonged isolation and in-cell shackling of prisoners with mental illness.  The \nCouncil has also approved the commencement of this lawsuit to remedy that mistreatment of \nDRCT’s Constituents.  The interests that DRCT seeks to vindicate by this lawsuit — protecting \nthe rights of institutionalized individuals with mental illness — are germane to DRCT’s central \npurpose and federal mandate. \n23.  As demonstrated above, DRCT’s Constituents have the power to participate in \nand exert significant influence over DRCT’s policies, priorities, and activities.  DRCT provides \nthe means by which these Constituents express their collective views and protect their collective \ninterests.  DRCT is therefore the functional equivalent of a traditional membership organization, \nand DRCT’s Constituents possess sufficient indicia of membership in DRCT so as to support \nDRCT’s associational standing to sue on their behalf. \n24.  DOC’s continuing violations of the Eighth Amendment, ADA, and Section 504 \nhave also directly and proximately caused injury, including economic injury and impairment, to \nDRCT itself.  DRCT has been forced to divert substantial resources over the past several years to \ninvestigating DOC’s mistreatment of DRCT’s Constituents, including DOC’s actions that form \nthe basis for the claims asserted in this litigation.  For example, and without limitation, DRCT \nhas worked pursuant to the Council’s priorities concerning prolonged isolation and restraint, \nincluding in-cell shackling, of DRCT’s Constituents.  DRCT employees have spent a significant \namount of time processing and reviewing DRCT’s Constituents’ complaints about DOC’s \n \n7\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 8 of 60\n \nmistreatment of them, including the conditions that form the basis for the claims asserted in this \nlitigation.  Given DOC’s failure to remedy the situation, DRCT has also been forced to divert \nsubstantial resources to preparing to enforce the rights of DRCT’s Constituents through this \nlitigation. \nB.  Connecticut Department of Correction \n25.  Defendant DOC is a public entity duly organized and existing under the laws of \nthe State of Connecticut, and a government entity.  DOC employs more than 5,000 persons and \nis responsible for, and retains authority over, the operation of Northern and other Connecticut \nstate prisons, including the housing and treatment of DRCT’s Constituents.  DOC is charged \nwith rendering care or treatment to DRCT’s Constituents at Northern and other Connecticut state \nprisons.  DOC receives state and federal funds for the operation of Northern and other state \nprisons and has received such funds throughout the time period during which the acts described \nherein have continued. \nC.  Angel Quiros \n26.  Defendant Angel Quiros is the Acting Commissioner of DOC.  Defendant Quiros, \nas Acting Commissioner, is the legal custodian of all prisoners confined in DOC facilities, is \nresponsible for the safe, secure, and humane housing of those prisoners, and has authority over \nthe assignment of prisoners to DOC’s administrative statuses.  Defendant Quiros served as \nWarden of Northern from 2009 to 2011.  Defendant Quiros has acted within the scope of his \nemployment and under color of state law at all times relevant hereto and in connection with all \npolicies, procedures, practices, and conduct described herein.  Defendant Quiros is sued in his \nofficial capacity. \n \n8\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 9 of 60\n \nD.  Roger Bowles \n27.  Defendant Roger Bowles is the Warden of Northern.  Defendant Bowles, as \nWarden, is the legal custodian of all prisoners confined at Northern and is responsible for the \nsafe, secure, and humane housing of those prisoners.  Defendant Bowles has acted within the \nscope of his employment and under color of state law at all times relevant hereto and in \nconnection with all policies, procedures, practices, and conduct described herein.  Defendant \nBowles is sued in his official capacity. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  DOC’s Design of the Northern Supermax Prison \n28.  DOC opened Northern in March 1995 as Connecticut’s first and only super-\nmaximum security prison.  DOC justified the enormous costs of constructing and maintaining \nNorthern as necessary to securely house the “worst of the worst,” in the words of former DOC \nCommissioner Leo Arnone. \n29.  Northern was purposely designed to isolate prisoners and its conditions are \nsingularly oppressive.  According to John Kessler, the architect of Northern, “[w]hen we were \ndesigning it, there was a desire that [prisoners’] first experience would make an impression — \nthe limited environment, the lack of stimulus. . . .  There is nothing soft.  It’s hard, and they \nwanted that.”  The Worst of the Worst: Portrait of a Supermax (2012) (interview with James \nKessler).  Former State Senator Joseph Crisco observed during a floor debate in 2012 that \n“Northern Prison, death row . . . is hell on earth.  How one retains his sanity in an environment \nlike that is incomprehensible.”  This Court recently determined that a special circumstances \n \n9\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 10 of 60\n \nprisoner’s conditions of confinement at Northern constituted cruel and unusual punishment under \nthe Eighth Amendment.  Reynolds v. Arnone, 402 F. Supp. 3d 3, 23 (D. Conn. 2019).1 \n30.  As shown below (Figure 1), Northern’s six housing units radiate outwards from a \nlong, sloped, windowless corridor, meant to give the impression of walking underground.  Light \nand sound reverberate off the concrete walls and mirrored windows, which are purposefully \narranged at irregular angles and create a disorienting, kaleidoscopic effect.  \n \nFigure 1 \nAerial View of Northern \n \n31.  Compounding this disorienting effect, there is a small room (the “bubble”) at the \ncenter of each unit from which Northern staff control all movement and communication.  The \nbubble is covered with mirrored glass so that staff can see out but prisoners cannot see in.  Staff \n                                                 \n1 “Special Circumstances” is a status for prisoners sentenced to death before Connecticut abolished the \ndeath penalty.  DRCT does not, by this lawsuit, seek to address the conditions of confinement for Special \nCircumstances Status prisoners.  Those conditions of confinement are already at issue in Reynolds v. Arnone, \nNo. 3:13-cv-1465 (SRU) (D. Conn.). \n \n10\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 11 of 60\n \nin the bubble monitor all activity within the unit from closed-circuit surveillance cameras and \ncontrol all doors remotely.  Staff outside the bubble communicate via radio to move through the \nunit or open cell doors.  Staff inside the bubble may, at any time, be listening to prisoners in their \ncells.  The experience of being under constant surveillance by faceless watchers can confuse and \ndistress prisoners, especially prisoners with mental illness, and often leads to psychosis and a \nsignificant break from reality. \n32.  Each cell contains an intercom that connects with the bubble.  To speak with a \nstaff member, a prisoner may press a button.  Staff inside the bubble may turn on the intercom at \nany time to speak with a prisoner.  Staff routinely ignore prisoners’ calls over the intercom, \nwhich sometimes leads to prisoners covering their window, resulting in further punishment. \n33.  The cells at Northern are designed to exacerbate the complete social and sensory \ndeprivation.  The four walls of each cell are unfinished, grey concrete.  The only view outdoors \ncomes through a narrow four-inch-wide slot at the back of each cell.   \n34.  Solid steel doors secure prisoners in the cells.  Each door has a small “trap” \nthrough which Northern staff pass food, medicine, and mail.  Northern staff also use the trap to \nhandcuff prisoners, who must squat down and put their hands through to be shackled. \n35.  Figures 2 through 5 (below), extracted from the documentary The Worst of the \nWorst: Portrait of a Supermax (2012), show a typical cell at Northern as viewed from the \ninterior.  Figure 2 shows the sink and toilet.  Figure 3 shows the bed and desk.  Figure 4 shows \nthe four-inch slot that constitutes the “window.”  Figure 5 shows an example of the trap in the \ndoor.   \n \n11\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 12 of 60\n \n \nFigure 2 \nSink and Toilet \n \n \nFigure 3 \nBed and Desk \n \n \n \n12\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 13 of 60\n \n \nFigure 4 \n“Window” Slot \n \n \nFigure 5 \nSink and Door \n36.  A prisoner’s access to fresh air and direct sunlight comes from a trip to what is \ncalled the “recreation cage,” a space slightly larger than a cell, surrounded by approximately \nfourteen-foot concrete walls and topped by a steel cage.  The only view is of the sky.

DOC’s Long History of Mistreating Prisoners with Mental Illness \n37.  Mental illness is prevalent at Northern.  Many prisoners there have histories of \nmental illness, have been diagnosed with mental illness, and/or have been treated with \n \n14\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 15 of 60\n \nmedication for mental illness.  In many cases, DOC itself has acknowledged and diagnosed the \nprisoners’ mental illness. \n38.  Northern’s excessively harsh and isolating conditions cause prisoners with mental \nillness to suffer serious and sometimes catastrophic deterioration in their mental and physical \nhealth.  Those same harsh conditions cause previously healthy prisoners to develop mental \nillness.  Many prisoners swallow razors and other objects, smash their heads into the wall, and \ncompulsively cut their own flesh.  Many prisoners hear voices, have suicidal thoughts, and \nattempt suicide.  Some have overdosed on drugs or hung themselves. \n39.  Defendants have a demonstrated pattern of knowingly and deliberately \nincarcerating prisoners with mental illness at Northern since it opened twenty-six years ago.  \nDefendants are ill-equipped and unable to provide for the mental health treatment needs for \npersons with mental illnesses and have knowingly imposed extraordinarily harsh living \nconditions although they have been on notice that doing so has had, and continues to have, \ndeleterious effects on these individuals. \n40.  On August 6, 2003, OPA, DRCT’s predecessor, filed a lawsuit against DOC in \nthe United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, alleging that prisoners and \ndetainees with serious mental illness who were confined at Northern and Garner Correctional \nInstitution (“Garner”) were subjected to unconstitutional conditions of confinement in violation \nof the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  State of Connecticut Office of Protection and \nAdvocacy for Persons with Disabilities v. Choinski, No. 3:03-CV-01352 (D. Conn.) (“Choinski \nLitigation”).  \n \n15\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 16 of 60\n \n41.  On September 26, 2005, the District Court approved a Settlement Agreement in \nthe Choinski Litigation (the “Settlement Agreement”) and retained jurisdiction over the matter to \nenforce compliance with the Settlement Agreement. \n42.  The Settlement Agreement provided that services for prisoners with serious \nmental illness would be consolidated at Garner, which would be designated as DOC’s mental \nhealth institution.  All prisoners who met the definition of “seriously mentally ill,” as determined \nby an independent evaluation process, had to be promptly removed from Northern.  The \nSettlement Agreement also called for increased staffing and changes to mental health evaluation \nand services.  All prisoners held in the most restrictive form of confinement at Northern were to \nbe assessed by psychiatric experts to determine whether their placement was appropriate.  \nIndividuals with mental health scores of MH4 or MH5 (i.e., a mental health disorder requiring \nspecialized housing or ongoing intensive treatment, or crisis level mental disorder) were to be \ntransferred to a facility with intensive psychiatric services such as Garner.  The Settlement \nAgreement also prohibited DOC from disciplining prisoners for actions that were the result of \ntheir mental illness. \n43.  In 2008, the Settlement Agreement’s judicial monitoring and compliance period \nended.  The final independent audit carried out pursuant to the Settlement Agreement found \nsubstantial noncompliance by DOC, including a failure to remove prisoners with serious mental \nillness from Northern and a failure of doctoral-level clinicians to see prisoners within appropriate \ntimeframes. \n44.  DOC closed its independent ombudsman’s office in 2009.  DOC then quickly \nreverted to using Northern as a heavy-handed solution for even routine and nonviolent \nbehavioral issues, including those caused by mental illness.  While many prisoners had \n \n16\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 17 of 60\n \ndocumented histories and symptoms of mental illness at the time the Settlement Agreement \nended, DOC, along with its employees, agents, and contractors, failed to ensure that these \nprisoners received meaningful mental health treatment.  Instead, under the supervision of \nDefendant Quiros, then Warden of Northern, staff at Northern often punished these individuals \nwith disciplinary sanctions and in-cell shackling.  \n45.  Upon information and belief, people with mental illness, including those with \nserious mental illness and those at substantial risk of developing serious mental illness, comprise \na substantial portion of Northern’s population.  Although DOC has taken steps toward reducing \nthe overall population at Northern in the past decade, those measures have not changed the daily \nreality for prisoners who remain trapped at Northern.  \nC.  DOC’s Transfer and Holding of Prisoners with Mental Illness at Northern \n46.  Prisoners with mental illness, including those with serious mental illness and \nthose at substantial risk of developing serious mental illness, end up at Northern through a \nvariety of paths, including being assigned to one of the Special Management Programs, i.e., \nAdministrative Segregation, Security Risk Group, or Special Needs. \n47.  Administrative Segregation is supposed to be reserved for individuals “whose \nbehavior or management factors pose a threat to the security of the facility or a risk to the safety \nof staff or other inmates and that . . . can no longer be safely managed in general population.”  \n(Administrative Directive 9.4.)  Administrative Segregation has three phases.  Phase I occurs at \nNorthern and lasts a minimum of 120 days.  Individuals in Phases II and III are currently housed \nat Garner, although some individuals complete the latter phases of the program at Northern as \nwell.  Phases II and III last a minimum of 90 days each. \n48.  Security Risk Group is supposed to be reserved for individuals whom DOC deems \nto have a gang affiliation.  (Administrative Directive 6.14.)  Phase I occurs at Northern and lasts \n \n17\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 18 of 60\n \na minimum of 120 days.  But these prisoners must complete a total of five phases lasting at least \ntwo years.  Later phases of the Security Risk Group program occur at other facilities. \n49.  Special Needs Management is an open-ended status that DOC developed to \nmanage individuals who “have demonstrated behavioral qualities either through the serious \nnature of their crime, behavior, or through reasonable belief that they pose a threat to the safety \nand security of staff, other inmates, themselves, or the public.”  (Administrative Directive 9.4.)  \nIndividuals in Special Needs Management have typically been judged by the DOC to have \n“failed” the Administrative Segregation or Security Risk Group statuses.  Special Needs \nprisoners are typically sent to Northern, where they will spend a minimum of six months.  \nSpecial Needs prisoners are required to be seen by a mental health professional after 30 days of \ninitial placement and every 90 days thereafter. \n50.  The Administrative Segregation, Security Risk Group, and Special Needs \nManagement prisoner stay at Northern is often far more than the minimum required.  Prisoners \nare commonly held back for disciplinary infractions or if Northern staff decide that they have not \ncompleted the required programming.  For example, even Administrative Segregation prisoners \nwho progress out of Northern to Phase II at another facility can find themselves quickly sent \nback to Phase I at Northern to begin all over again.  \n51.  Prisoners with mental illness have even more difficulty managing the stress of \nprison life and are likely to be placed into, and held back in, Administrative Segregation.  DOC \nmaintains oppressive conditions of confinement at Northern.  Consequently, once isolated, \nprisoners with mental illness are often unable to maintain stable behavior and find themselves \nheld back in the program for disciplinary violations of all kinds.  The result is that prisoners with \nmental illness can languish at Northern for months, years, or even indefinitely. \n \n18\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 19 of 60\n \n52.  Even after prisoners complete Administrative Segregation, Security Risk Group, \nor Special Needs Management, they can be placed on “Special Monitoring” status indefinitely.  \nDOC subjects prisoners on this status to heightened supervision and monitoring per \nAdministrative Directive 9.4.  They can be returned to Northern for any action deemed a “threat \nto safety and security,” a broad term that can include self-harm behaviors, without a hearing.   \nD.  DOC’s Prolonged Isolation of Prisoners with Mental Illness \n53.  Prisoners with mental illness at Northern, including those with serious mental \nillness and those at substantial risk of developing serious mental illness, are subjected to \nprolonged isolation and sensory deprivation.  Administrative Segregation Phase I and Security \nRisk Group Phase I, which constitute the majority of Northern’s population, impose the most \nrestrictive conditions on prisoners, including prisoners with mental illness.  \n54.  Most prisoners at Northern are locked in their cells by themselves.  Regular \nconversation with anyone outside of the cell is impossible: individuals must shout through metal \ndoors, air vents, and sink drains to communicate.   \n55.  Most prisoners are locked in their cells at least 22 hours per day on weekdays and \n24 hours per day on weekends. \n56.  All physical movement is highly restricted.  Prisoners remain locked in their cells \nexcept for a shower three times per week (or four times per week during the COVID-19 \npandemic) and one hour of “recreation” five times per week, when prisoners are sent to the \noutdoor cage.  Security Risk Group prisoners allowed to “recreate” with other prisoners spend \nthis time shackled with their hands behind their back. \n57.  Typically, each time a prisoner leaves their small cell, they must submit to a \nhumiliating and invasive “strip search” ritual, whereby they must strip naked, squat, and cough \n \n19\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 20 of 60\n \nto expose the testicles and anus.  DOC staff visually inspect the naked prisoner’s hair, ears, nose, \nmouth, underarms, soles of feet, and cavities between the toes, rectum, and genitalia. \n58.  Most prisoners, including all prisoners in Phase I of the Administrative \nSegregation and Security Risk Group programs, are shackled every time they leave their cell and \nmust crouch to be handcuffed through the trap prior to exiting.  \n59.  DOC policy mandates strip searches when individuals go to or from the \n“recreation” cage, but prisoners are often subjected to full strip searches when they leave their \ncell for other purposes, including for mental health treatment or legal visits.  Many prisoners \nchoose to avoid the humiliation, and often harassment, by simply remaining in their cells, where \ntheir only contact with others is conversations through sink drains and air vents.2 \n60.  Contact with the outside world is highly restricted.  On paper, DOC’s \nadministrative directives permit weekly calls and visits, with the permitted number of calls and \nvisits varying by status.  In practice, however, visits and even phone calls are rare.  DOC \nroutinely revokes visitation and call privileges as punishment for disciplinary violations; many \npeople at Northern have accrued disciplinary violations and lost visiting and phone privileges for \nyears or even decades.  Prisoners may receive visits from immediate family only, leaving many \npeople cut off from loved ones — aunts, girlfriends, cousins, mentors, friends — who might \notherwise provide critically needed social support.  Even when social visits do occur, they are \nnoncontact and occur via phone through a thick, Plexiglass barrier.  Most prisoners must be \nshackled in full restraints (wrists, ankles, and tether chain) during visits.  \n                                                 \n2 Prisoners at Northern on Special Needs status are granted a few additional hours of recreation per week.  \nBut these few chances for additional time out of cell are not granted to most of the individuals incarcerated at \nNorthern, and when accessible, they are wholly insufficient to mitigate the overarching environment of deprivation \nand restriction.   \n \n20\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 21 of 60\n \n61.  These extreme conditions fuel, and are fueled by, Northern’s longstanding culture \nof violence and brutality.  While many DOC staff perform their jobs with the utmost \nprofessionalism, others engage in harassment, intimidation, or outright violence against \nprisoners.  DOC staff have tampered with prisoners’ food, threatened retaliation if prisoners file \na grievance or lawsuit, and spread misinformation about prisoners, including false allegations of \nchild rape and molestation that provoke violence against them.  Verbal harassment by staff is \ncommonplace, either in person or via intercom.  Some have even goaded prisoners with mental \nillness who were having suicidal thoughts, ignoring their pleas for treatment and encouraging \nthem to hurt themselves.  \n62.  DOC staff also routinely and deliberately antagonize prisoners, inciting them to \nact out in order to justify the use of force.  As part of their punishment, prisoners are denied \naccess to blankets and adequate clothing for days and sometimes weeks.  \n63.  This punishing and prolonged isolation and mistreatment is particularly taxing \nand is discriminatory toward prisoners with mental illness.  The prolonged isolation of these \nprisoners exacerbates mental illness and can lead to cognitive deterioration and heightened \nstress-related symptoms.  Prolonged isolation can also exacerbate, and in some cases cause, \nphysical or psychiatric disabilities, such as gastrointestinal disorders, insomnia, eyesight \ndeterioration, heart palpitations, migraines, and profound fatigue.  Even those who endure the \neffects of isolation better than others are subjected to intolerable conditions, as they are forced to \nendure the hallucinations and screaming of other prisoners suffering the debilitating effects of \nisolation.  In addition, together with the social and sensory deprivation, the cold temperatures \ninterfere with sleep, likely contributing to feelings of anxiety and depression. \n \n21\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 22 of 60\n \n64.  Prolonged isolation in stressful conditions also often causes prisoners with mental \nillness to harm themselves or attempt suicide.  DOC staff routinely make arbitrary \ndeterminations that prisoners who threaten to or actually harm themselves are “malingering” and \nso provide no treatment at all.  Defendants expose prisoners to a substantial risk of serious \nirreparable harm despite the fact that self-harm and suicide are entirely predictable consequences \nof placing people with mental illness in prolonged isolation. \n65.  There is also a well-established culture among many Northern staff of inflicting \nadditional gratuitous indignities and cruelties upon prisoners — acts that serve to exacerbate the \nmisery of the ordinary conditions of confinement at Northern.  Because prisoners are locked in \ntheir cells, staff have absolute power over each prisoner’s environment.  Staff can and often do \nuse their power to play games or engage in petty disputes, for example, by withholding a food \ntray or toilet paper, ignoring a request for medical care, or repeatedly using the intercom to insult \nthe prisoner or to play disruptive noises or music. \n66.  When a prisoner is outside of their cell during recreation or shower time, staff \noften perform “shakedowns” of the cell, ostensibly to search for contraband.  In practice, \nhowever, staff often use shakedowns as a pretext to tamper with a prisoner’s personal property.  \nOn numerous occasions, Northern staff have destroyed pictures of prisoners’ family members.  \n67.  The isolative practices at Northern cause long-term psychological harm.  The \npsychological effects of prolonged isolation are well-documented, severe, and “analogous to the \nacute reactions suffered by torture and trauma victims.”  Craig Haney, Restricting the Use of \nSolitary Confinement, 2018 Ann. Rev. Criminology 285, 295 (2018).  Individuals subjected to \nprolonged isolation are at substantial risk of experiencing “heightened levels of anxiety and \npanic,” “irritability, aggression, and rage,” “paranoia . . . and violent fantasies,” “cognitive \n \n22\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 23 of 60\n \ndysfunction, hypersensitivity to stimuli, and hallucinations,” “loss of emotional control,” and \n“increased suicidality and instances of self-harm.”  Craig Haney, Restricting the Use of Solitary \nConfinement, 2018 Ann. Rev. Criminology 285, 291 (2018); see also Jesenia Pizarro & Vanja \nM. K. Stenius, Supermax Prisons: Their Rise, Current Practices, and Effect on Inmates, 84 \nPrison J. 248, 256 (2004) (noting “declines in mental functioning,” “difficulties in thinking, \nconcentration and memory problems, and problems with impulse control” in incarcerated people \nsubject to prolonged isolation).  One leading survey of the literature on the psychological effects \nof prolonged isolation concluded that prisoners subjected to prolonged isolation may develop “a \nconfusional psychosis with intense agitation, fearfulness, and disorganization” and that “the \nharm caused by such confinement may result in prolonged or permanent psychiatric disability.”  \nStuart Grassian, Psychiatric Effects of Solitary Confinement, 22 Wash. U. J. L. & Pol’y 325, 354 \n(2006).    \n68.  Many courts have recognized the psychological harm inflicted by prolonged \nisolation.  In fact, this Court recently acknowledged the “growing consensus among the scientific \ncommunity that solitary confinement inflicts severe harm on prisoners.”  Reynolds v. Arnone, \n402 F. Supp. 3d 3, 12 (D. Conn. 2019).  See also Davis v. Ayala, 576 U.S. 257, 289 (2015) \n(Kennedy, J., concurring) (“[R]esearch still confirms what this Court suggested over a century \nago: Years on end of near-total isolation exact a terrible price.”); Ruiz v. Texas, 137 S. Ct. 1246, \n1247 (2017) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (noting the petitioner “ha[d] developed symptoms long \nassociated with solitary confinement, namely severe anxiety and depression, suicidal thoughts, \nhallucinations, disorientation, memory loss, and sleep difficulty”); Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.S. \n863, 926 (2015) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (“[I]t is well documented that . . . prolonged solitary \nconfinement produces numerous deleterious harms.”); Porter v. Clarke, 923 F.3d 348, 357 (4th \n \n23\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 24 of 60\n \nCir. 2019) (finding that, based on the scientific literature, solitary confinement poses a \n“substantial risk of serious psychological and emotional harm”); Williams v. Sec’y Pa. Dep’t of \nCorr., 848 F.3d 549, 566-67 (3d Cir. 2017) (noting scientific consensus that solitary confinement \n“is psychologically painful, can be traumatic and harmful, and puts many of those who have \nbeen subject to it at risk of long-term . . . damage”).   \n69.  Prolonged isolation is also known to cause negative long-term physiological \neffects.  These effects may include “pains in the abdomen and muscle pains in the neck and \nback,” “dizziness and loss of appetite,” “lethargy and chronic tiredness,” and “a constellation of \nsymptoms — headaches, trembling, sweaty palms, and heart palpitations — that is commonly \nassociated with hypertension.”  Peter Scharff Smith, The Effects of Solitary Confinement on \nPrison Inmates: A Brief History and Review of the Literature, 34 Crime & Just. 441, 488-92 \n(2006); see also Craig Haney, Mental Health Issues in Long-Term Solitary and “Supermax” \nConfinement, 49 Crime & Delinq. 124, 133 (2003); Brie A. Williams et al., The Cardiovascular \nHealth Burdens of Solitary Confinement, 34 J. Gen. Internal Med. 1977, 1977 (2019).  The \nphysiological harm caused by prolonged isolation is closely linked to the psychological harms of \nthis isolation; worsened physical symptoms may aggravate psychological symptoms, and vice \nversa.  Justin D. Strong et al., The Body in Isolation: The Physical Health Impacts of \nIncarceration in Solitary Confinement, PLoS ONE (2020). \n70.  United States and international institutions responsible for human rights and the \ntreatment of prisoners have recognized the devastating psychological and physiological impacts \nof prolonged isolation.  These institutions agree that prolonged isolation of individuals with \nmental illness violates standards of common decency.  In fact, there is broad consensus that \n \n24\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 25 of 60\n \nindividuals with mental illness should not be placed in isolation unless absolutely necessary, \nunder medical supervision, and only for brief periods of time.  \n(a)  The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of \nPrisoners (“Mandela Rules”) prohibit isolation of prisoners with psychiatric disabilities \nwhen those conditions would exacerbate their disabilities.  G.A. Res. 70/175 (Dec. 17, \n2015).  \n(b)  The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has established that \nisolation “should be absolutely prohibited . . . for persons with mental disabilities.”  Press \nRelease, Organization of American States, IACHR Expresses Concern over Excessive \nUse of Solitary Confinement in the United States (July 18, 2013).  \n(c)  American Bar Association (“ABA”) standards recommend that “no \nprisoner diagnosed with serious mental illness should be placed in long-term segregated \nhousing.”  ABA, ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: Treatment of Prisoners (3d ed. \n2011) (“ABA Standards”).  \n(d)  The National Commission on Correctional Health Care states that \n“mentally ill individuals . . . should be excluded from solitary confinement of any \nduration.”  Nat’l Comm. on Corr. Health Care, Position Statement on Solitary \nConfinement (Apr. 2016). \n71.  Ultimately, DOC’s policies and practices of prolonged isolation trap people with \nmental illness, including those with serious mental illness and those at substantial risk of \ndeveloping serious mental illness, in a vicious cycle of deterioration and punishment.  Prolonged \nisolation causes prisoners’ mental health to deteriorate and prompts them to act out.  Those \nactions, in turn, prompt DOC to respond with even harsher sanctions — including excessive use \n \n25\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 26 of 60\n \nof restraints — that cause prisoners’ mental health to deteriorate still further.  Prisoners with \nmental illness find themselves caught in a downward spiral. \nE.  DOC’s In-Cell Shackling of Prisoners with Mental Illness  \n72.  Defendants not only subject prisoners with mental illness to prolonged isolation in \nconcrete cells but also violently extract them from these cells, shackle them, and then leave them \nshackled for hours or even days in filthy and freezing “strip cells.” \n73.  Northern staff routinely respond punitively with in-cell shackling when prisoners’ \nmental illness is manifested through self-injurious or other behaviors.  Staff respond with force \nrather than appropriate mental health treatment.  Defendants, in fact, have failed to provide staff \nwith the training required to identify and manage prisoners with mental illness. \n74.  DOC staff also engage in violent cell extractions in order to restrain prisoners \nwith in-cell shackling.  DOC staff routinely initiate these violent cell extractions in response to \nprisoners’ nonviolent behaviors such as covering cell windows with paper or banging cell doors.  \nPrisoners often engage in these behaviors as a result of the very conditions of isolation and \nextreme stress that DOC creates and maintains. \n75.  During cell extractions, a group of DOC staff wearing body armor surround the \nprisoner’s cell, spray chemical agent through the trap, force open the door, and restrain the \nprisoner, often assaulting the prisoner in the process.  DOC staff then shackle the prisoner’s legs \nand wrists, binding their hands to their feet with a tether chain and fastening a belly chain around \ntheir waist.  DOC staff may also employ a “black box” that fastens the tether and belly chain \ntogether and prevents prisoners from having any range of motion with their hands.  Through a \nmethod of restraint called “four points,” DOC staff may also shackle a prisoner’s hands and feet \nto a metal bed.  In some instances, DOC staff employ an “upgraded status” of four-point \nrestraints whereby they add mechanical restraints to the rubber cuffs used to shackle a prisoner.  \n \n26\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 27 of 60\n \n76.  DOC staff then dump these prisoners in filthy and freezing concrete “strip cells” \nwhere they are left alone but still chained and shackled.  The cells’ floors and walls are \nfrequently covered with urine and feces, causing some prisoners to develop skin rashes and \ninfections.  DOC staff frequently leave prisoners barefoot and wearing nothing but a one-piece \nsmock (or “Ferguson gown”), causing prisoners to shiver for hours on end.   \n77.  The use of in-cell shackling and the duration of prisoners’ placement in such \nrestraints is punitive and arbitrary.  DOC staff subject prisoners to in-cell shackling despite the \nlack of any safety or security justification, or for far longer than is required to ensure safety and \nsecurity.  Staff commonly keep prisoners in chains for a full 24 hours, and sometimes for days at \na time, long after they have ceased their disruptive behavior and after any plausible safety or \nsecurity justification has expired.  Prisoners are left in in-cell shackles for these extended periods \nof time without meaningful monitoring, in violation of DOC administrative directives and with \ndeliberate indifference to and disregard for prisoners’ safety and well-being. \n78.  Significantly, pursuant to Administrative Directive 6.5, as applied by Defendants \nand their subordinates, restraints are used not only to prevent escape or injury, but also to “ensure \ncompliance with an order.”  This is true regardless of the order, the severity of the violation, or \nthe reason for the behavior.  DOC staff have chained prisoners as punishment for past conduct, \nincluding for common, nonviolent infractions that predictably arise from confining people with \nmental illness in environments of prolonged isolation and stress.  For example, prisoners \ncovering up a cell window with paper, a behavior that prisoners engage in as a last resort to seek \nthe attention of staff, frequently results in in-cell shackling. \n \n27\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 28 of 60\n \n79.  DOC staff also use violent extractions and in-cell shackling to respond to self-\nharm and suicide attempts by prisoners with mental illness — instead of responding with \nappropriate options designed to safely de-escalate mental health crises.   \n80.  For example, DOC’s own policies permit “therapeutic restraints” in response to \ninstances where an individual poses a serious threat to his own safety.  “Therapeutic restraints” \nentail the use of softer restraints, in contrast to the metal chains used when prisoners are \nshackled, for a limited time period.   \n81.  However, DOC staff often choose not to use “therapeutic restraints” because they \n— without any medical justification — determine that individuals who engage in self-harm are \nmerely “malingering.”  Thus, DOC staff frequently subject prisoners with mental illness to \nviolent cell extractions and in-cell shackling based on arbitrary and capricious determinations by \nstaff lacking any medical qualifications that the prisoners are “malingering.”  Prisoners subjected \nto in-cell shackling, unlike “therapeutic restraints,” are not closely monitored by medical staff.  \nThis use of force, in turn, significantly exacerbates prisoners’ mental illness, makes them more \nprone to self-harm or suicide, and increases the already substantial risk that they will suffer \nserious harm. \n82.  Even when Northern staff do recognize a mental health emergency, they often \nrespond with further isolation and punishment rather than treatment.  Mental health professionals \nare authorized to place individuals on Behavioral Observation Status (“BOS”), whereby \nindividuals may be stripped of clothing and shoes, forced into a sleeveless quilted gown, \ndeprived of all personal property, and denied all social or legal visits and calls.  A person may be \nconfined to BOS while in in-cell restraints, or they may be confined in the medical unit, in which \ncase they may be subjected to therapeutic restraints. \n \n28\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 29 of 60\n \n83.  BOS was originally designed to be used only for a limited period of time, on the \nrecommendation of qualified mental health professionals, and for the purposes of ensuring a \nprisoner’s immediate safety and security.  Today, by contrast, Northern staff regularly rely on \nBOS to “extinguish maladaptive behaviors,” per Administrative Directive 9.4, seeking to coerce \ncompliance among prisoners with mental illness.   \n84.  There is no medical or therapeutic justification for this so-called “treatment.”  \nDOC staff often impose BOS concurrently with in-cell shackling, and it is not uncommon for \nNorthern staff to shuttle individuals between the various restrictive statuses, sometimes for \nweeks.   \n85.  Defendants’ policy and practice of placing and leaving prisoners with mental \nillness in in-cell shackling is dangerous, painful, and injurious.  The tight shackling of hands and \nlegs has caused bleeding on or around prisoners’ wrists and ankles and has left prisoners with \nlasting scars, bruises, and numbness.  The “short-chaining” of the tether chain connecting hands \nto legs has prevented prisoners from being able to stand up straight or lie down in a fully \nextended manner, forcing them into a crouched position and causing significant, lasting pain. \n86.  Defendants’ policy and practice of placing prisoners in in-cell shackling is \ndegrading and interferes with basic and necessary life activities.  The “strip cell” is typically very \ncold, yet prisoners do not have blankets, and the restraints prevent them from moving to keep \nthemselves warm.  Shackled prisoners are also unable to properly eat or use the toilet.   \n87.  Subjecting prisoners to in-cell shackling falls far outside basic standards of \ndecency and accepted professional norms.  The ABA directs that in-cell shackling should be \nused sparingly, and never “as a form of punishment or retaliation.”  ABA Standard 23-5.9(a).  If \nrestraints are used for “medical or mental health purposes,” then it must be under the \n \n29\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 30 of 60\n \nauthorization of a “qualified medical or mental health professional.”  ABA Standard 23-5.9(d).  \nThe use of restraints must also be of the “least restrictive form[]” possible, and “only as long as \nthe need exists.”  ABA Standard 23-5.9(b).  Northern staff routinely violate these standards and \nuse restraints excessively and without any medical authorization.    \n88.  In many instances, the use of in-cell shackling at Northern rises to the level of \ntorture.  The Mandela Rules prohibit “[t]he use of chains, irons or other instruments of restraint \nwhich are inherently degrading or painful,” and, like the ABA Standards, prohibit the use of \nrestraints of any kind “as a sanction for disciplinary offenses.”  The United Nations Standard \nMinimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, Rule 43.  Even when the use of restraints is \nauthorized, restraints are to be used only in the “least intrusive method” possible, and “only for \nthe time period required.”  Id., Rule 48.  When these rules are violated — as routinely happens at \nNorthern — the use of restraints may amount to torture.  Report of the Special Rapporteur, Theo \nvan Boven, ¶ 45, U.N. Doc E/CN.4/2004/56 (Dec. 23, 2003).  \n89.  This is particularly true if, as is the case at Northern, the person being subjected to \nexcessive and punitive restraints has a mental illness, because such persons are particularly \nvulnerable to the mental and psychological harms of being immobilized.  Report of the Special \nRapporteur, ¶ 63, 89 U.N. Doc. A/HRC/22/53 (Feb. 1, 2013).  As recently as last year, the UN \nSpecial Rapporteur on Torture concluded that the “Connecticut Department of Correction[’s] . . . \nrepressive measures, such as prolonged isolation or indefinite isolation, excessive use of in-cell \nshackling and needlessly intrusive strip searches . . . may well amount to torture.”  Press Release, \nU.N. Office of the High Comm’r for Human Rights, United States: Prolonged Solitary \nConfinement Amounts to Psychological Torture, Says UN Expert (Feb. 28, 2020). \n \n30\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 31 of 60\n \nF.  DOC’s Failure to Make Reasonable Modifications to Policies, Practices, and \nProcedures to Avoid Discriminating Against Prisoners with Mental Illness  \n90.  DOC fails to make reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures \nthat are necessary to accommodate prisoners with mental illness and that would allow those \nprisoners meaningful access to services, programs, and activities afforded to other prisoners.  \nDOC has failed to reasonably modify its programs, services, and activities to provide DRCT’s \nConstituents with needed mental health services in DOC’s other facilities and instead transfers \nthem to Northern where they are subjected to prolonged isolation and in-cell shackling. \n91.  DOC fails to reasonably modify its policies, practices, and procedures when \nassigning prisoners with mental illness to Administrative Segregation and housing them at \nNorthern; subjecting prisoners with mental illness to in-cell shackling and Behavioral \nObservation Status (“BOS”) at Northern; and disciplining prisoners with mental illness and \nholding them back from progression through Administrative Segregation at Northern.  DOC’s \nfailure to furnish reasonable modifications to prisoners with mental illness punishes prisoners \nwith mental illness for disability related conduct, exacerbates existing mental illness, and, \nsometimes, causes development of additional mental illness and/or exacerbation of symptoms of \nexisting mental illness. \n92.  For example, DOC has a policy, practice, and procedure or excluding certain \npsychiatric diagnoses as being “untreatable.”  DOC draws a false distinction between different \ntypes of mental disorders.  DOC differentiates between mental disorders such as schizophrenia \nand bipolar disorder, formerly characterized as “Axis I” disorders in the APA’s Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Illness (“DSM-IV”), and Borderline Personality Disorder (“BPD”) \nand Antisocial Personality Disorder (“ASPD”), formerly characterized as “Axis II” disorders in \n \n31\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 32 of 60\n \nthe DSM-IV.  The DSM-V eliminated the Axis I and Axis II labels, but DOC’s false distinction \nbetween these disorders continues. \n93.  Borderline Personality Disorder (“BPD”) is a serious and treatable mental illness.  \nSymptoms of BPD include recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating \nbehavior; affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood; chronic feelings of emptiness; \nand stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms.  A BPD diagnosis may be \n“defined, in part, by recurrent suicidal and self-injurious behaviors.”  Up to seventy percent of \npeople living with BPD attempt suicide during their lifetime; up to ten percent of people \ndiagnosed with BPD die of suicide.  Michelle M. Wedig et al., Predictors of Suicide Attempts in \nPatients with Borderline Personality Disorder over 16 Years of Prospective Follow-up, 42 \nPsychol. Med. 2395 (2012).  \n94.  Antisocial Personality Disorder (“ASPD”) is also a serious and treatable mental \nillness.  Symptoms of ASPD include failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful \nbehaviors, impulsivity, and failure to plan ahead.  Prisoners with ASPD are more likely to \nattempt suicide than those without.  “Individuals with ASPD diagnoses may be at increased risk \nfor multiple suicide attempts over the course of their lifetime.”  Emily B. Ansell et al., \nPersonality Disorder Risk Factors for Suicide Attempts over 10 Years of Follow-up, 6 \nPersonality Disorders 161 (2016).  \n95.  As a result of DOC’s policies, practices, and procedures that erroneously deem \nBPD, ASPD, and other mental health conditions as being “untreatable” mental illnesses, DOC \nrefuses to provide reasonable modifications for individuals diagnosed with such mental health \ndisabilities.  DOC does not make reasonable modifications to prevent prisoners with BPD and \nASPD, or numerous other mental illnesses, from being sent to Northern.  To the contrary, DOC \n \n32\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 33 of 60\n \ncharacterizes these as “untreatable” conditions and regularly targets persons with BPD and \nASPD for Administrative Segregation and detention at Northern. \n96.  Once at Northern, DOC staff often erroneously deem people diagnosed with BPD, \nASPD, and other serious mental illnesses to be “malingering” and interpret their symptoms as \nwillful misconduct that is met with further punishment such as in-cell shackling and BOS.   \n97.  Many prisoners with mental illness also receive disciplinary charges for behavior \nthat is a symptom of their mental illness.  Some prisoners have received disciplinary charges for \nself-harm or for merely reporting to staff that they feel suicidal.  Prisoners have also received \ndisciplinary charges for other nonthreatening conduct that is symptomatic of their illnesses, such \nas shouting, kicking the doors, and smearing their feces.  In fact, when individuals with BPD and \nASPD engage in extreme and horrific acts of self-harm and suicidal ideation, DOC staff \nparadoxically rely on those diagnoses to characterize these behaviors as disingenuous and \nmanipulative rather than recognizing them as behavioral manifestations of diagnosed mental \nillness. \n98.  Thus, as a result of DOC’s failure to make reasonable modifications to policies, \npractices, and procedures, prisoners with mental illness are often held back from progression \nthrough Administrative Segregation and face extended or even indefinite stays in prolonged \nisolation at Northern. \nG.  Current and Former Northern Prisoners with Mental Illness Confirm the \nUse of Prolonged Isolation, In-Cell Shackling, and Other Discrimination  \n(1)  Kyle Lamar Paschal-Barros \n99.  Deja Paschal, who legally changed his name to Kyle Lamar Paschal-Barros in \nFebruary 2017, is a 26-year-old man currently confined at Northern.  Mr. Barros is a constituent \n \n33\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 34 of 60\n \nof DRCT who has mental illness, as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 10802.  He is also a qualified \nindividual with a disability, as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102 and 29 U.S.C. § 705(20). \n100.  Mr. Barros first entered DOC custody in 2012 when he was just seventeen years \nold.  Mr. Barros has engaged in significant acts of self-harm and has attempted suicide multiple \ntimes while in DOC custody.  Since January 2017, Mr. Barros has primarily been confined at \nNorthern where he has been subjected to prolonged isolation.  Mr. Barros’ experiences at \nNorthern have severely exacerbated his mental illnesses.    \n101.  Mr. Barros has a long and complex history of serious mental illness, dating back \nto childhood.  From the time he was eight years old, Mr. Barros has been diagnosed with and \ntreated for bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, BPD, posttraumatic stress disorder \n(“PTSD”), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”), and obsessive-compulsive \ndisorder.  Some of these diagnoses occurred in community treatment settings, and many of these \ndiagnoses resulted from evaluation by DOC mental health practitioners.  All of these diagnoses \nwere made by qualified Connecticut mental health practitioners.   \n102.  Before and during his incarceration, Mr. Barros has been prescribed numerous \nmedications to treat his mental illnesses, including Prozac, Vistaril, prazosin, Paxil, Ritalin, \nAbilify, and lithium.  Before his incarceration, Mr. Barros received intensive individualized \ntreatment plans for his mental illnesses. \n103.  Shortly after his admission to the Manson Youth Institution in 2012, DOC \npractitioners identified Mr. Barros’ profound mental health needs and transferred him to Garner, \nDOC’s designated facility for “male offenders with significant mental health issues.”  He \nremained incarcerated at Garner from approximately July 2012 to January 2017. \n \n34\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 35 of 60\n \n104.  While he was at Garner, DOC practitioners diagnosed Mr. Barros with numerous \nmental illnesses, including bipolar disorder, PTSD, and ADHD.  He was placed on a number of \npsychiatric medications that provided some relief from the symptoms of his mental illnesses.  \n105.  Mr. Barros discovered that books were an important tool for his mental well-\nbeing, as they provided some self-help strategies for dealing with daily challenges.  Mr. Barros \nbecame an avid reader and accumulated many books.   \n106.  Even so, Mr. Barros continued to struggle.  When situations became \nunmanageable for him, Mr. Barros decompensated.  His deteriorating mental health condition led \nto self-harm, e.g., head-banging, and suicide attempts. \n107.  In January 2017, overwhelmed by symptoms of his mental illnesses, Mr. Barros \nattempted suicide by hanging himself.  Garner mental health staff placed Mr. Barros on suicide \nwatch.  Several days later, ignoring that its own staff recognized Mr. Barros was in mental health \ncrisis, DOC placed Mr. Barros on Administrative Segregation status and transferred him to \nNorthern.  \n108.  As Mr. Barros entered Phase I of Administrative Segregation at Northern, DOC \nstaff characterized his erratic and self-injurious behaviors as short-term behavioral problems \nrather than symptoms of his underlying mental illnesses.  Despite his well-documented history of \nserious mental illness and the recent suicide attempt, DOC staff discontinued all of his \npsychiatric medications.  At the time that Mr. Barros was taken off his medications, the injuries \nfrom his head-banging were still fresh. \n109.  Subjected to prolonged isolation in Northern’s isolating and disorienting \nconditions, and without needed medications, Mr. Barros rapidly decompensated.  He experienced \nintensifying paranoia, delusions, trauma-related flashbacks, hopelessness, and despair.  \n \n35\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 36 of 60\n \n110.  As the symptoms of his mental illnesses escalated, Mr. Barros began \naccumulating disciplinary sanctions for behaviors such as covering his cell window with paper, \nfailing to comply with orders, and engaging in altercations with DOC staff.  Mr. Barros engaged \nin these behaviors as a direct response to the symptoms he was experiencing.  These infractions \nprevented Mr. Barros from progressing through Phase I of Administrative Segregation for \napproximately sixteen months, four times the minimum required time. \n111.  In May 2018, Mr. Barros finally reached Phase II of Administrative Segregation \nand was transferred to the Walker facility (“Walker”) of the MacDougall-Walker Correctional \nInstitution.  At Walker, Mr. Barros continued experiencing debilitating symptoms of mental \nillness.  He hallucinated that his cell was on fire and cut his arm with a sharp lid.  Mental health \npersonnel at Walker resumed his psychiatric medication. \n112.  In the months that followed, Mr. Barros’ mental state continued to decline, and he \nwas transferred back to Garner for stabilization in September 2018.  At Garner, mental health \npersonnel effectively calibrated his medication regime, and he was deemed stable enough to \nreturn to Phase II of Administrative Segregation at Walker. \n113.  Shortly after his arrival at Walker, DOC staff informed Mr. Barros that they “lost” \nhis books.  Mr. Barros covered his cell window with paper to communicate his distress.  When \nMr. Barros refused to remove the paper, DOC staff performed a violent cell extraction and \nconfiscated Mr. Barros’ remaining books.  In October 2018, as a consequence of this episode, \nDOC regressed Mr. Barros back to Phase I of Administrative Segregation and transferred him \nback to Northern.    \n114.  Since October 2018, Mr. Barros has left Northern only once.  In July 2019, \nMr. Barros was transferred back to Garner for two months of intensive treatment after his mental \n \n36\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 37 of 60\n \nhealth badly deteriorated due to his months of isolation.  Mr. Barros has remained in Phase I of \nAdministrative Segregation and been incarcerated at Northern continuously since September \n2019.  Mr. Barros is typically confined to his small cell for 22 hours per day. \n115.  While at Northern, Mr. Barros has been subjected to in-cell shackling more than \nten times.  On almost every occasion, he was experiencing a mental health crisis and sought \ntreatment.  But instead of treatment, DOC responded by shackling him which served only to \nexacerbate his mental health crisis.  Sometimes, Mr. Barros covered his window as a desperate \ncall for mental health intervention and was subsequently cited for a disciplinary violation and \nplaced in in-cell shackles.  Once, in early 2018, he was shackled after a suicide attempt that DOC \nmedical staff deemed “nonlethal.”  \n116.  Each time he was subjected to in-cell shackling, Northern staff left Mr. Barros \nnaked (but for a safety gown) and chained in an unsanitary and cold “strip cell.”  Mr. Barros felt \nas though he was trapped in a “cold cement doghouse,” where he was forced to dump his food \nonto wax paper on the floor and eat like a dog.  Mr. Barros experienced traumatic flashbacks, \nand staff sometimes compounded his distress by playing continuous bell sounds over the \nintercom into the strip cell where he lay shackled. \n117.  The absence of rehabilitative or other meaningful programming at Northern \nfurther impairs Mr. Barros’ parole eligibility.  Under his “Offender Accountability Plan,” in \norder to be eligible for parole, Mr. Barros is required to participate in classes on anger \nmanagement, “good intentions, bad choices,” and restorative relationship-building with victims.  \nWhile these programs are offered at other DOC facilities, they are not offered at Northern.  \nFurther, when Mr. Barros was on Administrative Segregation status at Walker, the parole board \n \n37\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 38 of 60\n \nnotified him that, so long as he is on Administrative Segregation status, Mr. Barros has no \nopportunity for a parole hearing.  \n118.  Mr. Barros has recurring nightmares about the prison and its suffocating physical \nstructure, along with its extremely harmful and mentally damaging practices. \n(2)  Kezlyn Méndez  \n119.  Kezlyn Méndez is a 34-year-old man currently incarcerated in the MacDougall \nbuilding (“MacDougall”) of the MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution in Suffield, \nConnecticut.  Mr. Méndez is a constituent of DRCT who has mental illness, as defined in \n42 U.S.C. § 10802.  He is also a qualified individual with a disability, as defined in 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12102 and 29 U.S.C. § 705(20). \n120.  Mr. Méndez first entered DOC custody in 2005, at age eighteen.  Mr. Méndez has \nengaged in acts of self-harm and has attempted suicide multiple times while in DOC custody.  \nOver his time in DOC custody, Mr. Méndez has spent more than five years at Northern where he \nwas subjected to prolonged isolation and repeated in-cell shackling.    \n121.  Mr. Méndez has struggled with mental illness his entire life.  Beginning in early \nchildhood, he has received many psychiatric diagnoses, including bipolar disorder and PTSD.  \nMany of these diagnoses were made by mental health practitioners within the State of \nConnecticut, and some of these diagnoses were made or confirmed by DOC mental health \npersonnel.   \n122.  Mr. Méndez has a significant history of childhood trauma and mental illness that \nleaves him highly vulnerable to stressful triggers.  \n123.  At age six, Mr. Méndez was hit by a police car and sustained catastrophic \nphysical injuries, including a head injury that left him unconscious.  He underwent over three \n \n38\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 39 of 60\n \nyears of rehabilitation, and had to relearn to read, write, speak, and walk.  He has a minor speech \nimpediment and continues to experience blackouts.  \n124.  Mr. Méndez received both inpatient and outpatient psychiatric treatment in \nseveral Connecticut institutions throughout his childhood.  \n125.  Between 2005 and the present, Mr. Méndez has served four sentences in DOC \ncustody, totaling almost fourteen years.  Throughout his time in custody, Mr. Méndez has \nconsistently experienced symptoms of his mental illnesses, such as attempting suicide, anxiety, \nparanoia, flashbacks to previous violent events, sleep disturbances, anhedonia, and depression.  \n126.  When Mr. Méndez initially entered DOC custody at age eighteen, DOC clinicians \nrecognized his mental illnesses and transferred him to Garner for intensive treatment following a \nsuicide attempt.  Mr. Méndez was at Garner from approximately December 2005 to April 2006. \n127.  In July 2006, despite its awareness of Mr. Méndez’s mental illnesses, DOC sent \nMr. Méndez to Northern.  This transfer came less than three months after Mr. Méndez left \nGarner.  \n128.  The prolonged isolation that Mr. Méndez experienced at Northern led to a \nsignificant deterioration in his mental health.  He became ambivalent about human interaction, \nwavering between a strong desire for human connection and a pronounced fear and mistrust of \nothers.  He also experienced hallucinations, hearing disembodied voices and having \nconversations with people that were not there.  \n129.  In 2012, DOC again placed Mr. Méndez at Garner in light of his deteriorating \nmental health.  Nonetheless, DOC returned Mr. Méndez to isolation at Northern in 2013.  \nMr. Méndez was most recently incarcerated at Northern from December 2017 to May 2018. \n \n39\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 40 of 60\n \n130.  All told, DOC has cycled Mr. Méndez in and out of Northern on six separate \noccasions, from 2005 to the present.  He has spent more than five years there.   \n131.  Northern’s harsh environment exacerbated Mr. Méndez’s mental illnesses, and he \noften found compliance with DOC policies more difficult.  For example, desperate for human \ninteraction, he would put his hand through the trap of his cell door, in violation of DOC policy.  \nIn addition, Mr. Méndez accumulated disciplinary sanctions as his mental health deteriorated, \nranging from disobeying direct orders to physical altercations with DOC staff.  These \ndisciplinary violations prolonged Mr. Méndez’s confinement at Northern and resulted in \nadditional punishments, such as in-cell shackling.  \n132.  DOC subjected Mr. Méndez to in-cell shackling at Northern on three occasions.  \nOn each occasion, DOC left Mr. Méndez shackled for between 24 and 72 hours.  Each time, \nMr. Méndez was also strip searched and left to wear only a jumper (with no boxers or socks) \nwhile chained in cold and unsanitary environments, including in a strip cell that had feces on the \nwall and smelled of ammonia.  While shackled, Mr. Méndez was unable to physically wipe \nhimself after using the bathroom, and had to urinate in the sink because the toilet in the cell was \nleft unflushed.  \n133.  In one particularly violent instance, DOC staff subjected him to sexual and \nphysical abuse while forcefully restraining him after ordering him to take off his clothes.  One \nofficer punched him in the stomach, and a second grabbed and twisted Mr. Méndez’s testicles. \n134.  Mr. Méndez’s mental health symptoms have been exacerbated by his repeated \nplacement in prolonged isolation at Northern and repeated in-cell shackling.  He experiences \nheightened anxiety and paranoia, which has led to episodes where he experiences difficulty \n \n40\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 41 of 60\n \nbreathing, heart palpitations, and an inability to concentrate.  He also feels deep discomfort with \nliving in close proximity to other people and has struggled with frequent suicidal thoughts.   \n135.  To this day, Mr. Méndez remains at risk of return to Northern.  The possibility of \nreturning to Northern causes Mr. Méndez to feel fear and anxiety, as he recognizes that Northern \nexacerbated his mental health symptoms.  In particular, Mr. Méndez fears and expects that \nfurther deterioration of his mental health would occur should he be transferred back to \nNorthern’s harsh and isolative environment. \n(3)  Tyrone Spence \n136.  Tyrone Spence is a 29-year-old man in DOC custody currently incarcerated in the \nCorrigan building (“Corrigan”) of the Corrigan-Radgowski Correctional Institution in \nUncasville, Connecticut.  Mr. Spence is a constituent of DRCT who has mental illness, as \ndefined in 42 U.S.C. § 10802.  He is also a qualified individual with a disability, as defined in \n42 U.S.C. § 12102 and 29 U.S.C. § 705(20). \n137.  Mr. Spence has been in DOC custody since July 2010, when he was nineteen \nyears old.  Mr. Spence has spent over three years at Northern.  He was incarcerated at Northern \nfor all but two months of a period from March 2011 to November 2013, and he was transferred \nin and out of the facility multiple times between December 2017 and September 2019.  While at \nNorthern, Mr. Spence was subjected to prolonged isolation and repeated in-cell shackling.  He is \nat constant and continued risk of being transferred back to, and being confined at, Northern. \n138.  Mr. Spence has a long history of serious mental illness, including PTSD, anxiety, \nBPD, depression, and dissociation.  His mental health symptoms include suicidal ideation, self-\ninjurious behaviors, and he has attempted suicide on several occasions while incarcerated.  \n \n41\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 42 of 60\n \n139.  Mr. Spence suffered prenatal exposure to cocaine and significant neglect and \nphysical abuse in early childhood.  Throughout his childhood and adolescence, Mr. Spence \nreceived psychiatric care for his mental illnesses at numerous facilities, including the Institute of \nLiving, Riverview Children’s Hospital, and Yale New Haven Hospital.   \n140.  Before and during his incarceration, Mr. Spence had been prescribed medication \nto treat his mental illness, including, but not limited to chlorpromazine (Thorazine), clonazepam \n(Klonopin), clonidine, and guanfacine. \n141.  On May 6, 2018, Mr. Spence asked to be seen by Northern mental health staff \nthrough written requests and subsequent verbal appeals to his custody officers.  But mental \nhealth staff refused to see him until the following day.  On May 7, 2018, Mr. Spence cut his \nwrists and ingested pills and battery acid.  \n142.  Staff at Northern have given Mr. Spence disciplinary sanctions for behaviors that \nare symptoms of his mental illness, including instances of self-harm.  The isolating conditions at \nNorthern contributed to these symptoms.  \n143.  For instance, after the suicide attempt on May 7, 2018, Mr. Spence received a \ndisciplinary ticket on the grounds that he had disrupted the health and safety of staff and other \nprisoners at Northern.  \n144.  In September 2019, Mr. Spence again attempted suicide using pills while at \nNorthern.  He was then sent to Garner, where he completed the Administrative Segregation \nprogram.  \n145.  At Northern, Mr. Spence has been subjected to in-cell shackling numerous times.  \nHe recalls being shackled more than 50 times while in DOC custody and believes that a majority \nof these instances occurred at Northern.  Mr. Spence recalls being shackled with four-point \n \n42\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 43 of 60\n \nrestraints more than ten times.  He has also been subjected to black box restraints, an experience \nhe remembers as “the worst”: “You can’t sit down without hurting your hands or your wrists.  \nWhen you sit down it pushes the chain into your wrist.  The only way you can be comfortable is \nif you stand up.” \n146.  DOC staff subjected Mr. Spence to in-cell shackling in response to Mr. Spence’s \nfrequent instances of self-harm, which DOC staff characterized as behavioral and not worthy of \nmedical intervention.  When Mr. Spence cut himself, DOC staff accused him of engaging in \nattention-seeking behavior and subjected him to in-cell shackling.  In fact, Mr. Spence’s \ninstances of self-harm were a direct outgrowth of his mental illnesses and his worsening \ncondition due to Northern’s isolating environment. \n147.  The possibility of returning to Northern continues to haunt Mr. Spence.  After \ncompleting the Administrative Segregation program, Mr. Spence he was placed on “Special \nMonitoring” status leaving him under constant threat of return to Northern.   \n148.  Mr. Spence has suffered from acute anxiety as a result of his experiences being \nshackled.  He has found that seeing shackles or experiencing shackling can quickly trigger \nfeelings of anxiety.  After his experiences at Northern, he continues to fear experiencing violence \nwhen he is around DOC staff. \n149.  Mr. Spence received numerous disciplinary tickets for self-harm, a manifestation \nof his mental illness.  As a result, he lost various privileges, such as phone and commissary \naccess. \n150.  Mr. Spence has also been denied access to programs as a result of his mental \nhealth symptoms.  While in the Administrative Segregation program, he sought access to \n \n43\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 44 of 60\n \nprogramming, particularly the opportunity to participate in a mental health group, but was \nrepeatedly rebuffed by DOC staff. \nH.  Defendants Have Refused to Stop the Cruel and Unusual Mistreatment of \nPrisoners with Mental Illness  \n151.  The cruel and unusual conditions of confinement described above both punish \nindividuals and exacerbate their mental illness, leading to a downward spiral of further \npunishment and further psychiatric deterioration.  \n152.  Defendants have had full knowledge of those conditions and of their devastating \neffects on incarcerated people.  Indeed, Defendants’ own Restrictive Housing Matrix provides \nthat prisoners at Northern are to be seen by a mental health professional within 30 days and then \nevery 90 days thereafter.  Nevertheless, Defendants have condoned or been deliberately \nindifferent to the underlying conditions and mistreatment of prisoners with mental illness. \n153.  Defendants have repeatedly been made aware of these conditions by lawmakers, \noversight bodies, litigation, prisoners’ grievances, media reporting, and other means, but have \nfailed to take reasonable corrective action.  Former DOC Commissioner Rollin Cook once said, \n“When you isolate people and when you lock them up and don’t give them access to speak to \nother people or see light, that makes them worse. . . .  It doesn’t make them better.”  Whittney \nEvans, Outgoing Utah Corrections Boss Wants to Make People Better than They Arrived, KUER \n(Apr. 18, 2018).  Unfortunately, Commissioner Cook did not do anything effectual to change the \nconditions and practices at Northern. \n154.  On November 23, 2020, DRCT sent a letter to Angel Quiros, Acting DOC \nCommissioner, and Roger Bowles, Northern Warden, expressing grave concern over the \nprolonged isolation and in-cell shackling of prisoners with mental illness at Northern.  DRCT’s \n \n44\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 45 of 60\n \nletter was received by DOC on November 24, 2020.  In the letter, DRCT requested that DOC \nconfirm it will implement the following changes: \n(a)  immediately and permanently cease the use of in-cell restraints on \nindividuals with mental illness, including those at substantial risk of developing serious \nmental illness, at Northern; \n(b)  immediately and permanently cease subjecting individuals with mental \nillness, including those at substantial risk of developing serious mental illness, at \nNorthern to prolonged isolation; and  \n(c)  immediately cease subjecting any persons at Northern to prolonged \nisolation or in-cell restraints until such time that DOC demonstrates that it has \nimplemented an independent and effective mechanism to screen out all persons with \nmental illness, including those at substantial risk of developing serious mental illness.   \n155.  On January 22, 2021, DOC responded that the letter had been received but was \ndelayed in reaching the Commissioner’s Office, and that the allegations were being reviewed.  \nDRCT responded to DOC’s letter but DOC has not yet provided any substantive response.  \n156.  The conditions described herein are likely to persist unless enjoined by this Court.  \nDRCT has no alternative adequate remedy at law.  \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFirst Cause of Action \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983: Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments;  \nprolonged isolation of individuals with serious mental illness) \n \n157.  DRCT repeats and realleges each allegation set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 156 \nabove as if fully set forth herein. \n \n45\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 46 of 60\n \n158.  This claim is brought against Defendants Quiros and Bowles in their official \ncapacity.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles acted under color of state law at all times relevant \nhereto and in connection with all events described herein.   \n159.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law, by and pursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, \nand practice, have violated and continue to violate the rights of DRCT’s Constituents by \ndepriving them of their right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment guaranteed by the \nEighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied to the State of Connecticut \nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.   \n160.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law, by and pursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, \nand practice of prolonged isolation of DRCT’s Constituents, have subjected DRCT’s \nConstituents to dangerous and degrading mistreatment, caused them serious pain and injury, \nplaced them at substantial risk of serious physical and psychological injury, acted contrary to \nstandards of decency, and denied them the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities.  \nDefendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees and others acting in \nconcert with them under color of state law, by and pursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, and \npractice of prolonged isolation of DRCT’s Constituents, continue to subject DRCT’s \nConstituents to dangerous and degrading mistreatment, cause them serious pain and injury, place \nthem at substantial risk of serious physical and psychological injury, act contrary to standards of \ndecency, and deny them the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities. \n161.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law, by and pursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, \n \n46\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 47 of 60\n \nand practice of subjecting DRCT’s Constituents to prolonged isolation at Northern (1) have \nunnecessarily and wantonly inflicted, and continue to unnecessarily and wantonly inflict, pain \nupon them; (2) have acted and continue to act with deliberate indifference to their health, safety, \nand serious medical needs; and (3) knew and continue to know the risk to the health, safety, and \nserious medical needs of DRCT’s Constituents but have disregarded that risk and failed to take \nany reasonable measures to abate that risk. \n162.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles and their agents, officials, employees and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law, by and pursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, \nand practice have subjected and continue to subject DRCT’s Constituents to prolonged isolation \nat Northern for punitive or retaliatory purposes, and not in a good faith effort to ensure safety or \nsecurity or, at times, maintained them in prolonged isolation for longer than safety and security \nrequired.  \n163.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles authorized, condoned, and failed to exercise their \nsupervisory authority to prevent the illegal prolonged isolation of DRCT’s Constituents by their \nagents, officials, employees, and others acting in concert with them under color of state law, and \nare continuing to authorize, condone, and fail to exercise their supervisory authority to stop that \nillegal practice.  \n164.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law to subject prisoners with mental illness to \nprolonged isolation, have inflicted, and continue to inflict, cruel and unusual punishment on \nDRCT’s Constituents in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as \napplied to the State of Connecticut through the Fourteenth Amendment and enforceable through \n42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n \n47\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 48 of 60\n \n165.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and all \npersons acting in concert with them under color of state law, are the proximate cause of the \nongoing deprivation of constitutional rights of DRCT’s Constituents. \n166.  As a result of the actions of Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, \nofficials, employees, and others acting in concert with them under color of state law, DRCT’s \nConstituents have suffered and continue to suffer irreparable harm.  \n167.  Unless enjoined, Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, \nemployees and others acting in concert with them under color of state law, will continue the \nprolonged isolation of DRCT’s Constituents in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments, and continue to inflict injuries for which such prisoners have no adequate remedy \nat law.  \n168.  DRCT is entitled to an injunction against the prolonged isolation of DRCT’s \nConstituents by Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law.  \nSecond Cause of Action \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983: Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; \nin-cell shackling of individuals with mental illness) \n169.  DRCT repeats and realleges each allegation set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 168 \nabove as if fully set forth herein. \n170.  This claim is brought against Defendants Quiros and Bowles in their official \ncapacity.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles acted under color of state law at all times relevant \nhereto and in connection with all events described herein.   \n171.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law, by and pursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, \nand practice, violated and continue to violate the rights of DRCT’s Constituents by depriving \n \n48\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 49 of 60\n \nthem of their right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment guaranteed by the Eighth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution, as applied to the State of Connecticut through the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.   \n172.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law, by and pursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, \nand practice of in-cell shackling of DRCT’s Constituents, have subjected DRCT’s Constituents \nto dangerous and degrading mistreatment, caused them serious pain and injury, placed them at \nsubstantial risk of serious injury, acted contrary to standards of decency, and denied them the \nminimal civilized measure of life’s necessities.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, \nofficials, employees, and others acting in concert with them under color of state law by and \npursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, and practice of in-cell shackling of DRCT’s Constituents, \ncontinue to subject DRCT’s Constituents to dangerous and degrading mistreatment, cause them \nserious pain and injury, place them at substantial risk of serious physical and psychological \ninjury, deny them the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities, and act contrary to \nstandards of decency.   \n173.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law, by and pursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, \nand practice of subjecting DRCT’s Constituents to in-cell shackling (1) have unnecessarily and \nwantonly inflicted, and continue to unnecessarily and wantonly inflict, pain upon them; (2) have \nacted and continue to act with deliberate indifference to their health, safety, and serious medical \nneeds; and (3) knew and continue to know the risk to the health, safety, and serious medical \nneeds of DRCT’s Constituents but have disregarded that risk and failed to take any reasonable \nmeasures to abate that risk.   \n \n49\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 50 of 60\n \n174.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law, by and pursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, \nand practice, subjected and continue to subject DRCT’s Constituents to in-cell shackling \nmaliciously and sadistically, and for punitive or retaliatory purposes.  In many instances, they \nused in-cell shackling to punish DRCT’s Constituents for behavior that predictably arises from \ntheir own actions — that is, from placing people with mental illness in prolonged isolation at \nNorthern.  \n175.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law, did not and do not instigate or continue to \nsubject DRCT’s Constituents to in-cell shackling in a good faith effort to maintain or restore \ndiscipline, to ensure the safety or security of others, or to ensure their own safety or security.  \n176.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles authorized, condoned, and failed to exercise their \nsupervisory authority to prevent, the illegal in-cell shackling of DRCT’s Constituents by their \nagents, officials, employees, and others acting in concert with them under color of state law, and \ncontinue to authorize, condone, and fail to exercise their supervisory authority to stop that illegal \npractice.  \n177.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law by the in-cell shackling of prisoners with \nmental illness, have inflicted, and continue to inflict, cruel and unusual punishment on DRCT’s \nConstituents in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied \nto the State of Connecticut through the Fourteenth Amendment and enforceable through \n42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \n \n50\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 51 of 60\n \n178.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and all \npersons acting in concert with them under color of state law are the proximate cause of the \nongoing deprivation of constitutional rights of DRCT’s Constituents. \n179.  As a result of the actions of Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, \nofficials, employees, and others acting in concert with them under color of state law, DRCT’s \nConstituents at Northern have suffered and continue to suffer irreparable harm.  \n180.  Unless enjoined, Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, \nemployees and others acting in concert with them under color of state law, will continue the \nin-cell shackling of DRCT’s Constituents in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments, and to inflict injuries for which such prisoners have no adequate remedy at law.  \n181.  DRCT is entitled to an injunction against the in-cell shackling of DRCT’s \nConstituents by Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law.  \nThird Cause of Action \n(Violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132;  \nfailure to implement reasonable modifications for persons with mental illness)  \n \n182.  DRCT repeats and realleges each allegation set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 181 \nabove as if fully set forth herein. \n183.  This claim is asserted against DOC. \n184.  DOC, by the policies and practices described herein, has violated and continues to \nviolate the rights of DRCT’s Constituents secured by the ADA.  DOC has violated, and \ncontinues to violate, the rights of DRCT’s Constituents by failing to make reasonable \nmodifications to policies, practices, and procedures needed in order for these prisoners to enjoy \nmeaningful access to services, programs, and activities. \n \n51\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 52 of 60\n \n185.  The ADA provides, in relevant part, that “no qualified individual with a disability \nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of \nthe services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  \n186.  The ADA has been implemented regulations promulgated by the United States \nDepartment of Justice, 28 C.F.R. § 35.101 et seq., providing, inter alia, that public entities:  \n(a) shall not “[d]eny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to participate in or \nbenefit from [an] aid, benefit, or service,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(i); and (b) “shall make \nreasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are \nnecessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the [DOC] can demonstrate \nthat making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or \nactivity,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).  \n187.  DRCT’s Constituents are qualified individuals with disabilities within the \nmeaning of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12102, 12131, and 28 C.F.R. § 35.104.  DRCT’s \nConstituents have mental impairments or illnesses that substantially limit their ability to perform \nmajor life activities, such as caring for themselves, working, concentrating, thinking, and \ncommunicating with others.  Many of DRCT’s Constituents also have records of mental \nimpairment or illness, and are regarded as having such mental impairment, or illness.   \n188.  DOC is a public entity within the meaning of and subject to Title II of the ADA.  \nSee 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1).  DOC is responsible for the operation and management of correctional \nfacilities, including Northern, and subject to the ADA Regulations at 28 C.F.R. § 35.152 et seq.  \nDOC is legally responsible for ADA violations committed by DOC staff and contractors who \n \n52\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 53 of 60\n \nprovide programs, services, or activities, including, but not limited to, mental health services, to \nDOC prisoners including DRCT’s Constituents.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1). \n189.  DOC services, programs, and activities are covered by the ADA.  The services, \nprograms, and activities that DOC provides to individuals in its custody include, but are not \nlimited to, sleeping, eating, showering, toileting, communicating with those outside the prison by \nmail and telephone, exercising, entertainment, safety and security, the prison’s administrative, \ndisciplinary, and classification proceedings, medical and mental health services, the library, \neducational, vocational, substance abuse, and anger management classes, and discharge services. \n190.  DOC is, and at all times relevant hereto was, aware of the mental illness of \nDRCT’s Constituents and has failed to implement reasonable modifications to policies, practices, \nor procedures needed in order for these prisoners to enjoy meaningful access to services, \nprograms, and activities and to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability.  DOC has violated, \nand continues to violate, the rights of DRCT’s Constituents by failing to provide reasonable \nmodifications to policies, practices, or procedures in order to proscribe discrimination against \nprisoners with mental illness.   \n191.  For example, DOC fails to reasonably assess and account for mental illness or \notherwise provide reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures in connection \nwith assigning DRCT’s Constituents to Administrative Segregation and housing them at \nNorthern where they are subject to prolonged isolation.   \n192.  DOC fails to reasonably assess and account for mental illness or otherwise \nprovide reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures in connection with \nsubjecting DRCT’s Constituents to in-cell shackling and BOS at Northern.   \n \n53\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 54 of 60\n \n193.  DOC fails to reasonably assess and account for mental illness or otherwise \nprovide reasonable modifications to policies, practices, or procedures in connection with issuing \ndisciplinary tickets to DRCT’s Constituents at Northern, holding them from progression through \nAdministrative Segregation, or otherwise maintaining them at Northern where they are subject to \nprolonged, or even indefinite, isolation and in-cell shackling.   \n194.  DOC, by subjecting prisoners with mental illness to prolonged isolation at \nNorthern and by the use of frequent in-cell shackling and BOS, excludes these prisoners from \nparticipation in, denies them the benefits of, and discriminates against them with respect to equal \naccess to, and the provision of, services, programs, and activities that are accessible to other \nprisoners.  DOC’s exclusion, denial, and discrimination are solely by reason of these prisoners’ \nmental illness. \n195.  In sum, DOC has failed to make reasonable modifications to policies, practices, or \nprocedures to ensure that prisoners with mental illness are able to enjoy meaningful access to \nservices, programs, and activities. \n196.  DOC, by virtue of the above-described discrimination and mistreatment of \nprisoners with mental illness, has violated the ADA, including its supporting regulations.  \n197.  DOC’s failure to meet its obligations to prisoners with mental illness constitutes \nan ongoing and continuous violation of the ADA and its supporting regulations and continues to \ninflict irreparable harm on these prisoners.  Unless enjoined, DOC will continue to violate the \nADA and to inflict injuries for which prisoners with mental illness have no adequate remedy at \nlaw. \n198.  The ADA authorizes injunctive relief as appropriate to remedy acts of \ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities.  42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1).  \n \n54\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 55 of 60\n \n199.  DRCT is entitled to injunctive relief to prevent DOC’s continued violation of the \nADA, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in connection with bringing this \naction. \nFourth Cause of Action \n(Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a); \nfailure to provide reasonable accommodation for persons with mental illness) \n \n200.  DRCT repeats and realleges each allegation set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 199 \nabove as if fully set forth herein. \n201.  This claim is asserted against DOC. \n202.  DOC, by the policies and practices described herein, has violated and continues to \nviolate the rights of DRCT’s Constituents secured by the Section 504 and its implementing \nregulations.  DOC has violated, and continues to violate, the rights of DRCT’s Constituents by \ndenying them reasonable modification in policies, practices, and procedures needed in order for \nthem to enjoy meaningful access to services, programs, and activities. \n203.  Section 504 provides, in relevant part, that “[n]o otherwise qualified individual \nwith a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \nprogram or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n204.  Section 504 has been implemented by DOJ-issued regulations, providing, inter \nalia, that recipients of federally funded programs and activities shall not “utilize criteria or \nmethods of administration . . . that have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to \ndiscrimination on the basis of handicap,” 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4). \n205.  DRCT’s Constituents are qualified individuals with disabilities within the \nmeaning of Section 504, 29 U.S.C. § 705(20), 42 U.S.C. § 12102.  DRCT’s Constituents have \n \n55\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 56 of 60\n \nsignificant mental impairments, or illnesses, that substantially limit their ability to perform major \nlife activities, such as caring for themselves, working, concentrating, thinking, and \ncommunicating with others.  Many of DRCT’s Constituents also have records of such their \nmental impairment or illness, and are regarded as having such mental impairment, or illness.   \n206.  DOC receives federal grants, contracts, and other financial assistance thereby \nsubjecting itself to the requirements of Section 504.  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  DOC is legally \nresponsible for Section 504 violations committed by DOC staff and contractors who provide \nprograms, services, or activities, including but not limited to mental health services, to DOC \nprisoners including DRCT’s Constituents.   \n207.  DOC programs and activities are covered by Section 504, 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1).  \nThese programs and activities that DOC provides to prisoners in its custody include, but are not \nlimited to, sleeping, eating, showering, toileting, communicating with those outside the prison by \nmail and telephone, exercising, entertainment, safety and security, the prison’s administrative, \ndisciplinary, and classification proceedings, medical and mental health services, the library, \neducational, vocational, substance abuse, and anger management classes, and discharge services. \n208.  DOC is, and was at all times relevant hereto, aware of the mental illness of \nprisoners with mental illness and has failed to implement reasonable modification to policies, \npractices, or procedures needed in order for these prisoners to enjoy meaningful access to \nservices, programs, and activities and to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability.  DOC has \nviolated, and continues to violate, the rights of people with mental illness by failing to make \nreasonable accommodations to policies, practices, or procedures in order to proscribe \ndiscrimination against prisoners with mental illness.  \n \n56\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 57 of 60\n \n209.  For example, DOC fails to reasonably assess and account for mental illness or \notherwise make reasonable modification to policies, practices, and procedures in connection with \nassigning DRCT’s Constituents to Administrative Segregation and housing them at Northern \nwhere they are subject to prolonged isolation.   \n210.  DOC fails to reasonably assess and account for mental illness or otherwise make \nreasonable modification to policies, practices, and procedures in connection with subjecting \nDRCTs Constituents to in-cell shackling and BOS at Northern.   \n211.  DOC fails to reasonably assess and account for mental illness or otherwise make \nreasonable modification to policies, practices, or procedures in connection with issuing \ndisciplinary tickets to DRCT’s Constituents, holding them from progression through \nAdministrative Segregation, or otherwise maintaining them at Northern where they are subject to \nprolonged, or even indefinite, isolation and in-cell shackling.   \n212.  DOC, by subjecting prisoners with mental illness to prolonged isolation at \nNorthern, and by the use of frequent in-cell shackling and BOS, excludes these prisoners from \nparticipation in, denies them the benefits of, and discriminates against them with respect to \nservices, programs, and activities that are accessible to other prisoners.  DOC’s exclusion, denial, \nand discrimination are solely by reason of these prisoners’ mental illness. \n213.  In sum, DOC has not made any reasonable modification to policies, practices, or \nprocedures to ensure that prisoners with mental illness are able to enjoy meaningful access to \nservices, programs, and activities. \n214.  DOC, by virtue of the above-described discrimination and mistreatment of \nprisoners with mental illness, has violated Section 504, including its supporting regulations.  \n \n57\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 58 of 60\n \n215.  DOC’s failure to meet its obligations to prisoners with mental illness constitutes \nan ongoing and continuous violation of Section 504 and its supporting regulations and continues \nto inflict irreparable harm on these prisoners.  Unless enjoined, DOC will continue to violate \nSection 504 and to inflict injuries for which prisoners with mental illness have no adequate \nremedy at law. \n216.  Section 504 authorizes injunctive relief as appropriate to remedy acts of \ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities.  29 U.S.C. § 794a(a)(2). \n217.  DRCT is entitled to injunctive relief to prevent DOC’s continued violation of \nSection 504, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in connection with bringing \nthis action.   \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, in order to stop the ongoing psychological and physical tormenting of its \nconstituents, DRCT respectfully requests that the Court:  \n(a)  Issue a judgment declaring that the prolonged isolation of DRCT’s \nConstituents constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; \n(b)  Permanently enjoin Defendants, their subordinates, agents, employees, \nand all other persons acting in concert with them under color of state law from subjecting \nDRCT’s Constituents to prolonged isolation at Northern either by maintaining any of \nDRCT’s Constituents at Northern or transferring any of DRCT’s Constituents to \nNorthern;  \n \n58\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 59 of 60\n \n(c)  Issue a judgment declaring that the in-cell shackling of DRCT’s \nConstituents constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; \n(d)  Permanently enjoin Defendants, their subordinates, agents, employees, \nand all other persons acting in concert with them under color of state law from subjecting \nDRCT’s Constituents to in-cell shackling at Northern; \n(e)  Declare that Defendants’ conduct described herein, including, without \nlimitation, Defendants’ failure to provide reasonable modifications that would allow \nDRCT’s Constituents access to services, programs, and activities afforded to other \nprisoners, violates the ADA and Section 504;  \n(f)  Permanently enjoin Defendants, their subordinates, agents, employees, \nand all other persons acting in concert with them under color of state law from the \ncontinued violation of the ADA and Section 504 and further require that Defendants \nmake reasonable modifications that would allow DRCT’s Constituents meaningful access \nto services, programs, and activities afforded other prisoners, as required under the ADA \nand Section 504;  \n(g)  Grant Plaintiff’s reasonable attorneys’ fees, litigation expenses, and costs \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b), 42 U.S.C. § 12205, 28 C.F.R. § 35.175, 29 U.S.C. \n§ 794a(b), and other applicable law; and  \n(h)  Grant such other relief as the Court considers just and proper.  \n \n \n59\n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 1   Filed 02/04/21   Page 60 of 60\n \n  Respectfully submitted, \n \n \n \n__/s_/_ _D_a_n_ _B_a_r_r_e_tt_______________ \nDan Barrett (ct29816) \nElana Bildner (ct30379) \nACLU Foundation of Connecticut \n765 Asylum Avenue, 1st Floor \nHartford, CT 065105 \nPhone: (860) 471-8471 \nEmail: e-filings@acluct.org \n \nHope Metcalf (ct424312) \nIfy Chikezie (Law Student Intern) \nKamilyn Choi (Law Student Intern) \nLuke Connell (Law Student Intern) \nZoe Rubin (Law Student Intern) \nLowenstein International Human Rights \nClinic \nYale Law School \nP.O.

Disability Rights Connecticut, Inc. (“DRCT”) seeks to end the persistent and \ndeliberate abuse of people with mental illness in the custody of the Connecticut Department of \nCorrection (“DOC”) — including those subjected to isolative statuses at Connecticut’s super-\nmaximum security Northern Correctional Institution (“Northern”) and elsewhere.  DOC subjects \nprisoners with mental illness to prolonged, and often indefinite, isolation and sensory \ndeprivation, and forcible in-cell shackling that can last for days.  This inhuman treatment of \npersons with mental illness is physically painful, intentionally humiliating, and causes long-term \npsychological damage.  DOC’s continuing abuse of, and discrimination against, people with \nmental illness must come to an end. \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 2 of 61\n \n2.  DOC’s abhorrent mistreatment of prisoners with mental illness constitutes cruel \nand unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution.  DOC’s failure to make reasonable modifications in policies and practices to \navoid trapping these prisoners in a downward spiral of isolation and retribution also denies them \nvirtually all opportunities for rehabilitative and other programming in violation of Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 et seq. (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (“Section 504”), and their respective implementing \nregulations. \n3.  DOC routinely subjects individuals with mental illness to prolonged isolation.  \nFor example, DOC assigns individuals with mental illness to isolative statuses where they face \nprolonged isolation and abuse.  Many prisoners with mental illness, including most prisoners \nwith mental illness at Northern, spend at least 22 hours per day on weekdays, and 24 hours per \nday on weekends, in concrete cells where they live in a world of near total social and sensory \ndeprivation.  Their primary connection to the outside world is a small opening, or “trap,” at the \nbottom of a solid steel door.  The only daylight and view outdoors comes through a narrow four-\ninch-wide slot at the back of each cell.  Meaningful social interaction is nonexistent. \n4.  DOC also routinely subjects individuals with mental illness to in-cell shackling.  \nFor example, DOC staff retaliate against prisoners with mental illness by shackling and chaining \nthem alone in “strip cells” for even minor disciplinary violations that are often manifestations of \ntheir mental illness.  DOC staff shackle a prisoner’s wrists and legs with metal cuffs and then \nbind the cuffs with a heavy, metal tether chain.  Prisoners are routinely left shackled and chained \nfor 24 hours, and sometimes for days at a time, far longer than justified by any genuine threat to \nsafety or security.  While shackled and chained, prisoners are served food in Styrofoam cups \n  2 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 3 of 61\n \nwithout utensils.  Many prisoners are unable to even lift a cup to their mouth because of the \nshortness of the tether chain; in these instances, the only way for them to consume the contents \nof the cup is to dump it out on the bed or floor and eat like a dog.  The shortness of the tether \nchain or the tightness of the cuffs also frequently leaves prisoners unable to wipe themselves \nafter using the toilet.  The experience is degrading and painful.  Many individuals have scars on \ntheir wrists and ankles from repeatedly being subjected to in-cell shackling. \n5.  DOC knowingly subjects prisoners with mental illness to these harsh conditions.  \nConsequently, many prisoners with mental illness commit acts of self-harm or mutilation as a \nresult of their near-total isolation and mistreatment.  In an attempt to quell their anxiety caused \nby these inhumane living conditions, persons with mental illness cut their skin, bang their heads, \nor shove sharp objects into their bodies.  These self-injurious behaviors often cause lasting \ninjury.  Sometimes these individuals lose all ability to cope, covering the walls and their bodies \nwith their own excrement.  Some prisoners try to kill themselves.  These self-injurious behaviors \nand suicide attempts are a direct and predictable result of DOC’s actions.  But DOC responds to \nthese self-injurious behaviors and suicide attempts with even more isolation and punitive in-cell \nshackling. \n6.  DOC, Angel Quiros (Acting Commissioner, DOC), and Roger Bowles (Warden, \nNorthern) (collectively “Defendants”) have implemented and overseen DOC’s policies and \npractices described herein and have not taken any effective action to remedy the longstanding \nand well-known abuse of prisoners with mental illness at Northern and other Connecticut state \ncorrectional institutions.  For more than two decades, DOC has known that its isolation and \nshackling policies and practices put persons with mental illness at substantial risk of profound \nand lasting injury.  Yet, despite a federal lawsuit settlement that expired in 2008 and years-long \n  3 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 4 of 61\n \npublic pressure, Defendants have failed to take action to protect prisoners with mental illness \nfrom abuse.  Defendants have instead acted with deliberate indifference to the unconstitutional \nconditions of confinement and mistreatment of prisoners. \n7.  DRCT, which is authorized by federal law to protect the rights of individuals \ndiagnosed with or experiencing mental illness in Connecticut, brings this action against \nDefendants for declaratory and injunctive relief.  DRCT seeks to stop DOC’s prolonged isolation \nand in-cell shackling of prisoners with mental illness, and to stop DOC’s failure to make \nreasonable modifications to its policies, practices, and procedures. \nJURISDICTION \n8.  Subject-matter jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \nand 1343(a)(3) because this action arises under the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \nthe ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131, et seq., and Section 504, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \nVENUE \n9.  Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because \nDefendants reside in this district and because a substantial part of the events and omissions \ngiving rise to DRCT’s claims occurred in this district. \nPARTIES \nA.  Disability Rights Connecticut, Inc. \n10.  DRCT is a private, nonprofit corporation and is the authorized protection and \nadvocacy system for the State of Connecticut under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals \nwith Mental Illness Act (“PAIMI Act”), 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq., and its implementing \nregulations.  DRCT’s office is located at 846 Wethersfield Avenue, Hartford, Connecticut 06114.  \nDRCT is the successor entity to the State of Connecticut Office of Protection and Advocacy for \nPersons with Disabilities (“OPA”).  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 46a-10a et seq. \n  4 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 5 of 61\n \n11.  The PAIMI Act provides for establishing and funding protection and advocacy \nsystems, including DRCT, to investigate the abuse and neglect of individuals with mental illness \nand to advocate for and ensure that their rights are protected, including their rights under the \nConstitution and federal and state statutes.  42 U.S.C. §§ 10801(b)(1), 10801(b)(2)(A). \n12.  DRCT is responsible for providing protection and advocacy services to \nindividuals with mental illness and disabilities pursuant to the PAIMI Act. \n13.  DRCT has statutory authority to pursue legal, administrative, and other \nappropriate remedies to ensure the protection of individuals with mental illness who are \nreceiving care or treatment in the State of Connecticut.  42 U.S.C. § 10805. \n14.  DRCT is pursuing this action to advocate for and protect the rights and interests \nof “individuals with mental illness,” as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 10802, who are in DOC’s custody \nand are currently in Administrative Segregation, Security Risk Group, or Special Needs \nManagement (“Isolative Statuses”), or are at risk of transfer into Isolative Statuses (“DRCT’s \nConstituents”).  DRCT’s Constituents are the direct beneficiaries of DRCT’s activities, including \nthe declaratory and injunctive relief sought in this litigation. \n15.  DRCT’s Constituents have “significant mental illnesses or emotional \nimpairments,” as determined by a mental health professional qualified under the laws and \nregulations of the State of Connecticut.  See 42 U.S.C. § 10802.  The mental illness of DRCT’s \nConstituents substantially limits their ability to perform major life activities, such as self-care, \nworking, and interaction with others.  DRCT’s Constituents are therefore individuals with mental \nillness for purposes of the PAIMI Act, 42 U.S.C. § 10802.  DRCT’s Constituents are also \nindividuals with disabilities for purposes of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), and Section 504, \n29 U.S.C. § 794.  “Mental illness” is used throughout this Complaint pursuant to its definition \n  5 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 6 of 61\n \nunder the PAIMI Act.  This definition encompasses individuals with mental illness who have \nserious mental illness or who are at substantial risk of developing serious mental illness. \n16.  DRCT’s Constituents have each suffered injuries, are continuing to suffer injuries, \nand/or are at risk of suffering injuries that make them eligible to bring suit against Defendants in \ntheir own right.  DRCT’s Constituents all reside in “facilities” rendering care and treatment for \nindividuals with mental illness, as that term is defined in 42 U.S.C. § 10802 and 42 C.F.R. \n§ 51.2. \n17.  Consistent with the PAIMI Act, DRCT’s governing structure allows its \nconstituents to express their collective views and protect their collective interests, and to \nparticipate in, significantly influence, and help guide DRCT’s priorities and activities. \n18.  DRCT has established a PAIMI Advisory Council (“Council”) that advises DRCT \non policies and priorities to be carried out in protecting and advocating for the rights of \nindividuals with mental illness.  The Council complies with all requirements of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 10805(a)(6).  The Chair of the Council sits on the Board of Directors of DRCT. \n19.  The Council holds bi-monthly meetings to discuss, evaluate, and advise on \nDRCT’s policies, priorities, procedures, and activities.  The Chair of the Council presents the \nsubstance of the Council’s findings and conclusions to the Board of Directors at the monthly \nBoard meetings.  The Council considers, nominates, and appoints its own members, including its \nChairperson.  DRCT’s Executive Director does not control or take part in the election of new \nmembers to the Council.  Council members may be removed only upon recommendation by the \nCouncil to the Executive Director. \n20.  DRCT has established a grievance procedure whereby persons served under \nPAIMI or their representatives or family members may file a grievance when there is \n  6 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 7 of 61\n \ndisagreement about a DRCT action or decision.  The grievance procedure is designed “to assure \nthat individuals with mental illness have full access to the services of the system.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 10805(a)(9).  The Council is the final decision-maker with respect to grievances filed by \npersons served under PAIMI or their representatives or family members.  \n21.  The Council, in conjunction with the Executive Director and Board of Directors, \nestablishes DRCT’s PAIMI priorities for each fiscal year at an annual meeting.  \n22.  The Council has voted to include a priority concerning DOC’s in-cell shackling of \nprisoners with mental illness.  The Council has supported and approved DRCT’s efforts to \naddress the prolonged isolation and in-cell shackling of prisoners with mental illness.  The \nCouncil has also approved the commencement of this lawsuit to remedy that mistreatment of \nDRCT’s Constituents.  The interests that DRCT seeks to vindicate by this lawsuit — protecting \nthe rights of institutionalized individuals with mental illness — are germane to DRCT’s central \npurpose and federal mandate.  \n23.  As demonstrated above, DRCT’s Constituents have the power to participate in \nand exert significant influence over DRCT’s policies, priorities, and activities.  DRCT provides \nthe means by which these Constituents express their collective views and protect their collective \ninterests.  DRCT is therefore the functional equivalent of a traditional membership organization, \nand DRCT’s Constituents possess sufficient indicia of membership in DRCT so as to support \nDRCT’s associational standing to sue on their behalf. \n24.  DOC’s continuing violations of the Eighth Amendment, ADA, and Section 504 \nhave also directly and proximately caused injury, including economic injury and impairment, to \nDRCT itself.  DRCT has been forced to divert substantial resources over the past several years to \ninvestigating DOC’s mistreatment of DRCT’s Constituents, including DOC’s actions that form \n  7 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 8 of 61\n \nthe basis for the claims asserted in this litigation.  For example, and without limitation, DRCT \nhas worked pursuant to the Council’s priorities concerning prolonged isolation and restraint, \nincluding in-cell shackling, of DRCT’s Constituents.  DRCT employees have spent a significant \namount of time processing and reviewing DRCT’s Constituents’ complaints about DOC’s \nmistreatment of them, including the conditions that form the basis for the claims asserted in this \nlitigation.  Given DOC’s failure to remedy the situation, DRCT has also been forced to divert \nsubstantial resources to preparing to enforce the rights of DRCT’s Constituents through this \nlitigation. \nB.  Connecticut Department of Correction \n25.  Defendant DOC is a public entity duly organized and existing under the laws of \nthe State of Connecticut, and a government entity.  DOC employs more than 5,000 persons and \nis responsible for, and retains authority over, the operation of Northern and other Connecticut \nstate correctional institutions, including the housing and treatment of DRCT’s Constituents.  \nDOC is charged with rendering care or treatment to DRCT’s Constituents at Northern and other \nConnecticut state correctional institutions.  DOC receives state and federal funds for the \noperation of Northern and other Connecticut state correctional institutions and has received such \nfunds throughout the time period during which the acts described herein have continued. \nC.  Angel Quiros \n26.  Defendant Angel Quiros is the Acting Commissioner of DOC.  Defendant Quiros, \nas Acting Commissioner, is the legal custodian of all prisoners confined in DOC facilities, is \nresponsible for the safe, secure, and humane housing of those prisoners, and has authority over \nthe assignment of prisoners to DOC’s Isolative Statuses.  Defendant Quiros served as Warden of \nNorthern from 2009 to 2011.  Defendant Quiros has acted within the scope of his employment \nand under color of state law at all times relevant hereto and in connection with all policies, \n  8 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 9 of 61\n \nprocedures, practices, and conduct described herein.  Defendant Quiros is sued in his official \ncapacity.   \nD.  Roger Bowles \n27.  Defendant Roger Bowles is the Warden of Northern.  Defendant Bowles, as \nWarden, is the legal custodian of all prisoners confined at Northern and is responsible for the \nsafe, secure, and humane housing of those prisoners.  Defendant Bowles has acted within the \nscope of his employment and under color of state law at all times relevant hereto and in \nconnection with all policies, procedures, practices, and conduct described herein.  Defendant \nBowles is sued in his official capacity.   \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  DOC’s Northern Supermax Prison and Isolative Statuses \n28.  DOC subjects persons with mental illness in Isolative Statuses to prolonged \nisolation and in-cell shackling in multiple Connecticut state correctional institutions.  One of the \nharshest of the environments in which these persons are currently mistreated by DOC is Northern \n— a prison that has served as a magnet for persons with mental illness and that was purpose-built \nto break them down.  From its inception, DOC used Northern to hold prisoners in Isolative \nStatuses.    \n29.  DOC opened Northern in March 1995 as Connecticut’s first and only super-\nmaximum security prison.  DOC justified the enormous costs of constructing and maintaining \nNorthern as necessary to securely house the “worst of the worst,” in the words of former DOC \nCommissioner Leo Arnone.   \n30.  Northern was purposely designed to isolate prisoners and its conditions are \nsingularly oppressive.  According to John Kessler, the architect of Northern, “[w]hen we were \ndesigning it, there was a desire that [prisoners’] first experience would make an impression — \n  9 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 10 of 61\n \nthe limited environment, the lack of stimulus. . . .  There is nothing soft.  It’s hard, and they \nwanted that.”  The Worst of the Worst: Portrait of a Supermax (2012) (interview with James \nKessler).  Former State Senator Joseph Crisco observed during a floor debate in 2012 that \n“Northern Prison, death row . . . is hell on earth.  How one retains his sanity in an environment \nlike that is incomprehensible.”  This Court recently determined that a Special Circumstances \nprisoner’s conditions of confinement at Northern constituted cruel and unusual punishment under \nthe Eighth Amendment.  Reynolds v. Arnone, 402 F. Supp. 3d 3, 23 (D. Conn. 2019).1 \n31.  As shown below (Figure 1), Northern’s six housing units radiate outwards from a \nlong, sloped, windowless corridor, meant to give the impression of walking underground.  Light \nand sound reverberate off the concrete walls and mirrored windows, which are purposefully \narranged at irregular angles and create a disorienting, kaleidoscopic effect.  \n \nFigure 1 \nAerial View of Northern \n                                                 \n1 As noted above, “Special Circumstances” is a status for prisoners sentenced to death before Connecticut \nabolished the death penalty.  DRCT does not, by this lawsuit, seek to address the conditions of confinement for \nSpecial Circumstances Status prisoners.  Those conditions of confinement are already at issue in Reynolds v. \nArnone, No. 3:13-cv-1465 (SRU) (D. Conn.).  \n  10 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 11 of 61\n \n \n32.  Compounding this disorienting effect, there is a small room (the “bubble”) at the \ncenter of each unit from which Northern staff control all movement and communication.  The \nbubble is covered with mirrored glass so that staff can see out but prisoners cannot see in.  Staff \nin the bubble monitor all activity within the unit from closed-circuit surveillance cameras and \ncontrol all doors remotely.  Staff outside the bubble communicate via radio to move through the \nunit or open cell doors.  Staff inside the bubble may, at any time, be listening to prisoners in their \ncells.  The experience of being under constant surveillance by faceless watchers can confuse and \ndistress prisoners, especially prisoners with mental illness, and often leads to psychosis and a \nsignificant break from reality. \n33.  Each cell contains an intercom that connects with the bubble.  To speak with a \nstaff member, a prisoner may press a button.  Staff inside the bubble may turn on the intercom at \nany time to speak with a prisoner.  Staff routinely ignore prisoners’ calls over the intercom, \nwhich sometimes leads to prisoners covering their window, resulting in further punishment. \n34.  The cells at Northern are designed to exacerbate the complete social and sensory \ndeprivation.  The four walls of each cell are unfinished, grey concrete.  The only view outdoors \ncomes through a narrow four-inch-wide slot at the back of each cell.   \n35.  Solid steel doors secure prisoners in the cells.  Each door has a small “trap” \nthrough which Northern staff pass food, medicine, and mail.  Northern staff also use the trap to \nhandcuff prisoners, who must squat down and put their hands through to be shackled. \n36.  Figures 2 through 5 (below), extracted from the documentary The Worst of the \nWorst: Portrait of a Supermax (2012), show a typical cell at Northern as viewed from the \ninterior.  Figure 2 shows the sink and toilet.  Figure 3 shows the bed and desk.  Figure 4 shows \n  11 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 12 of 61\n \nthe four-inch slot that constitutes the “window.”  Figure 5 shows an example of the trap in the \ndoor.   \n \nFigure 2 \nSink and Toilet \n \n \nFigure 3 \nBed and Desk \n \n \n  12 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 13 of 61\n \n \nFigure 4 \n“Window” Slot \n \n \nFigure 5 \nSink and Door \n37.  A prisoner’s access to fresh air and direct sunlight comes from a trip to what is \ncalled the “recreation cage,” a space slightly larger than a cell, surrounded by approximately \nfourteen-foot concrete walls and topped by a steel cage.  The only view is of the sky.

DOC’s Long History of Mistreating Prisoners with Mental Illness \n38.  Mental illness is prevalent throughout the Connecticut state correctional system, \nbut it is especially prevalent in prisoners in Isolative Statuses at Northern and elsewhere.  Many \nsuch prisoners have histories of mental illness, have been diagnosed with mental illness, and/or \n  14 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 15 of 61\n \nhave been treated with medication for mental illness.  In many cases, DOC itself has \nacknowledged and diagnosed the prisoners’ mental illness. \n39.  For instance, Northern’s excessively harsh and isolating conditions cause \nprisoners with mental illness to suffer serious and sometimes catastrophic deterioration in their \nmental and physical health.  Those same harsh conditions cause previously healthy prisoners to \ndevelop mental illness.  Many prisoners swallow razors and other objects, smash their heads into \nthe wall, and compulsively cut their own flesh.  Many prisoners hear voices, have suicidal \nthoughts, and attempt suicide.  Some have overdosed on drugs or hung themselves. \n40.  Defendants have a demonstrated pattern of knowingly and deliberately \nincarcerating prisoners with mental illness at Northern since it opened twenty-six years ago.  \nDefendants are ill-equipped and unable to provide for the mental health treatment needs for \npersons with mental illnesses and have knowingly imposed extraordinarily harsh living \nconditions although they have been on notice that doing so has had, and continues to have, \ndeleterious effects on these individuals. \n41.  On August 6, 2003, OPA, DRCT’s predecessor, filed a lawsuit against DOC in \nthe United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, alleging that prisoners and \ndetainees with serious mental illness who were confined at Northern and Garner Correctional \nInstitution (“Garner”) were subjected to unconstitutional conditions of confinement in violation \nof the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  State of Connecticut Office of Protection and \nAdvocacy for Persons with Disabilities v. Choinski, No. 3:03-CV-01352 (D. Conn.) (“Choinski \nLitigation”).  \n  15 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 16 of 61\n \n42.  On September 26, 2005, the District Court approved a Settlement Agreement in \nthe Choinski Litigation (the “Settlement Agreement”) and retained jurisdiction over the matter to \nenforce compliance with the Settlement Agreement. \n43.  The Settlement Agreement provided that services for prisoners with serious \nmental illness would be consolidated at Garner, which would be designated as DOC’s mental \nhealth institution.  All prisoners who met the definition of “seriously mentally ill,” as determined \nby an independent evaluation process, had to be promptly removed from Northern.  The \nSettlement Agreement also called for increased staffing and changes to mental health evaluation \nand services.  All prisoners held in the most restrictive form of confinement at Northern were to \nbe assessed by psychiatric experts to determine whether their placement was appropriate.  \nIndividuals with mental health scores of MH4 or MH5 (i.e., a mental health disorder requiring \nspecialized housing or ongoing intensive treatment, or crisis level mental disorder) were to be \ntransferred to a facility with intensive psychiatric services such as Garner.  The Settlement \nAgreement also prohibited DOC from disciplining prisoners for actions that were the result of \ntheir mental illness. \n44.  In 2008, the Settlement Agreement’s judicial monitoring and compliance period \nended.  The final independent audit carried out pursuant to the Settlement Agreement found \nsubstantial noncompliance by DOC, including a failure to remove prisoners with serious mental \nillness from Northern and a failure of doctoral-level clinicians to see prisoners within appropriate \ntimeframes. \n45.  DOC closed its independent ombudsman’s office in 2009.  DOC then quickly \nreverted to using Northern as a heavy-handed solution for even routine and nonviolent \nbehavioral issues, including those caused by mental illness.  While many prisoners had \n  16 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 17 of 61\n \ndocumented histories and symptoms of mental illness at the time the Settlement Agreement \nended, DOC, along with its employees, agents, and contractors, failed to ensure that these \nprisoners received meaningful mental health treatment.  Instead, under the supervision of \nDefendant Quiros, then Warden of Northern, staff at Northern often punished these individuals \nwith disciplinary sanctions and in-cell shackling.  \n46.  Upon information and belief, people with mental illness, including those with \nserious mental illness and those at substantial risk of developing serious mental illness, comprise \na substantial portion of the prisoners in Isolative Statuses at Northern.  Although DOC has taken \nsteps toward reducing the overall population at Northern in the past decade, those measures have \nnot changed the daily reality for prisoners who remain trapped at Northern.  \n47.  DOC has also not amended its policies, practices, or procedures regarding \nprolonged isolation and in-cell shackling.  To the contrary, in response to Northern’s fluctuating \npopulation and outside scrutiny, DOC has periodically shifted parts of the Isolative Statuses to \nother prisons, including Cheshire Correctional Institution, Corrigan Correctional Institution, \nGarner Correctional Institution, and Walker Correctional Institution.  DOC has also run parallel \nprograms for women at York Correctional Institution and for young people at Manson Youth \nInstitution.  \nC.  DOC’s Mistreatment of People with Mental Illness in Isolative Statuses  \n48.  Prisoners with mental illness, including those with serious mental illness and \nthose at substantial risk of developing serious mental illness, end up in Isolative Status at \nNorthern and elsewhere through their assignment to Administrative Segregation, Security Risk \nGroup, or Special Needs. \n49.  Administrative Segregation is supposed to be reserved for individuals “whose \nbehavior or management factors pose a threat to the security of the facility or a risk to the safety \n  17 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 18 of 61\n \nof staff or other inmates and that . . . can no longer be safely managed in general population.”  \n(Administrative Directive 9.4.)  Administrative Segregation has three phases.  Phase I lasts a \nminimum of 120 days and currently occurs at Northern.  Phases II and III last a minimum of 90 \ndays each and currently occur at Garner, although some individuals currently complete the latter \nphases of the program at Northern as well.  Over the past decade, Phases II and III have occurred \nat various institutions, including Cheshire Correctional Institution and Corrigan Correctional \nInstitution.  \n50.  Security Risk Group is supposed to be reserved for individuals whom DOC deems \nto have a gang affiliation.  (Administrative Directive 6.14.)  Phase I lasts a minimum of 120 days \nand currently occurs at Northern.  But these prisoners must complete a total of five phases lasting \nat least two years.  Later phases of the Security Risk Group program occur at other facilities, \nincluding Garner Correctional Institution, Walker Correctional Institution, and York Correctional \nInstitution.  \n51.  Special Needs Management is an open-ended status that DOC developed to \nmanage individuals who “have demonstrated behavioral qualities either through the serious \nnature of their crime, behavior, or through reasonable belief that they pose a threat to the safety \nand security of staff, other inmates, themselves, or the public.”  (Administrative Directive 9.4.)  \nIndividuals in Special Needs Management have typically been judged by the DOC to have \n“failed” the Administrative Segregation or Security Risk Group statuses.  Currently, Special \nNeeds prisoners are typically sent to Northern, where they will spend a minimum of six months.  \nSpecial Needs prisoners are required to be seen by a mental health professional after 30 days of \ninitial placement and every 90 days thereafter. \n  18 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 19 of 61\n \n52.  Prisoners with mental illness often stay in Isolative Statuses for far longer than the \nrequired minimum time.  Prisoners are commonly held back for disciplinary infractions or if \nDOC staff decide that they have not completed the required programming.  For example, even \nAdministrative Segregation prisoners who progress out of Northern to Phase II at another facility \ncan find themselves quickly sent back to Phase I at Northern to begin all over again.  \n53.  Prisoners with mental illness have even more difficulty managing the stress of \nprison life and are likely to be placed into, and held back in, Isolative Statuses.  Consequently, \nonce prisoners with mental illness are assigned to Isolative Statuses, they are often unable to \nmaintain stable behavior and find themselves held back for disciplinary violations of all kinds.  \nThe result is that prisoners with mental illness can languish in Isolative Statuses at Northern, or \nelsewhere, for months, years, or even indefinitely. \n54.  Even after prisoners are released from Isolative Status, they can be placed on \n“Special Monitoring” status indefinitely.  DOC subjects prisoners on this status to heightened \nsupervision and monitoring per Administrative Directive 9.4.  They can be returned to Isolative \nStatus, at Northern or elsewhere, without a hearing and for any action deemed a “threat to safety \nand security” — a broad term that can include self-harm behaviors.   \nD.  DOC’s Prolonged Isolation of Prisoners with Mental Illness \n55.  DOC’s Isolative Statuses subject individuals with mental illness, including those \nwith serious mental illness and those at substantial risk of developing serious mental illness, to \nprolonged isolation and sensory deprivation.  Policies expressly limit social interaction and \nrestrict out-of-cell time to just one to two hours per day.  In practice, upon information and \nbelief, out-of-cell time and opportunities to participate in work and programs are, in fact, even \nmore limited. \n  19 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 20 of 61\n \n56.  Administrative Segregation Phase I and Security Risk Group Phase I impose the \nmost restrictive conditions on prisoners in Isolative Statuses, including prisoners with mental \nillness.  \n57.  Individuals held under Administrative Segregation Phase I receive only one hour \nof recreation per day, five days a week according to DOC’s “management standards.”  During \nrecreation, prisoners are in recreation cages by themselves.   \n58.  Individuals held under Security Risk Group Phase I are allowed a minimum of \none hour of recreation per day, five days a week.  Recreation may occur in small groups, but at \nleast in Phase I, individuals’ hands are shackled behind their backs, which is painful and \ninterferes with their mobility.   \n59.  Most of the Administrative Phase I and Security Risk Group I are currently \nhoused at Northern where they are locked in their cells by themselves.  Regular conversation \nwith anyone outside of the cell is impossible: individuals must shout through metal doors, air \nvents, and sink drains to communicate. \n60.  Most prisoners are locked in their cells at least 22 hours per day on weekdays and \n24 hours per day on weekends. \n61.  All physical movement is highly restricted.  Prisoners remain locked in their cells \nexcept for a shower three times per week (or four times per week during the COVID-19 \npandemic) and one hour of “recreation” five times per week, when prisoners are sent to the \noutdoor cage.   \n62.  Typically, each time a prisoner leaves their small cell, they must submit to a \nhumiliating and invasive “strip search” ritual, whereby they must strip naked, squat, and cough \n  20 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 21 of 61\n \nto expose the testicles and anus.  DOC staff visually inspect the naked prisoner’s hair, ears, nose, \nmouth, underarms, soles of feet, and cavities between the toes, rectum, and genitalia. \n63.  Most prisoners, including all prisoners in Phase I of the Administrative \nSegregation and Security Risk Group programs, are shackled every time they leave their cell and \nmust crouch to be handcuffed through the trap prior to exiting.  \n64.  DOC policy mandates strip searches when individuals go to or from the \n“recreation” cage, but prisoners are often subjected to full strip searches when they leave their \ncell for other purposes, including for mental health treatment or legal visits.  Many prisoners \nchoose to avoid the humiliation, and often harassment, by simply remaining in their cells, where \ntheir only contact with others is conversations through sink drains and air vents. \n65.  Contact with the outside world is highly restricted.  On paper, DOC’s \nadministrative directives permit weekly calls and visits, with the permitted number of calls and \nvisits varying by status.  In practice, however, visits and even phone calls are rare.  DOC \nroutinely revokes visitation and call privileges as punishment for disciplinary violations; many \npeople at Northern have accrued disciplinary violations and lost visiting and phone privileges for \nyears or even decades.  Prisoners may receive visits from immediate family only, leaving many \npeople cut off from loved ones — aunts, girlfriends, cousins, mentors, friends — who might \notherwise provide critically needed social support.  Even when social visits do occur, they are \nnoncontact and occur via phone through a thick, Plexiglass barrier.  Most prisoners must be \nshackled in full restraints (wrists, ankles, and tether chain) during visits.  \n66.  These extreme conditions fuel, and are fueled by, Northern’s longstanding culture \nof violence and brutality.  While many DOC staff perform their jobs with the utmost \nprofessionalism, others engage in harassment, intimidation, or outright violence against \n  21 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 22 of 61\n \nprisoners.  DOC staff have tampered with prisoners’ food, threatened retaliation if prisoners file \na grievance or lawsuit, and spread misinformation about prisoners, including false allegations of \nchild rape and molestation that provoke violence against them.  Verbal harassment by staff is \ncommonplace, either in person or via intercom.  Some have even goaded prisoners with mental \nillness who were having suicidal thoughts, ignoring their pleas for treatment and encouraging \nthem to hurt themselves.  \n67.  DOC staff also routinely and deliberately antagonize prisoners, inciting them to \nact out in order to justify the use of force.  As part of their punishment, prisoners are denied \naccess to blankets and adequate clothing for days and sometimes weeks.  \n68.  Prolonged isolation and punitive mistreatment is particularly taxing for — and is \ndiscriminatory toward — prisoners with mental illness.  The prolonged isolation of these \nprisoners exacerbates mental illness and can lead to cognitive deterioration and heightened \nstress-related symptoms.  Prolonged isolation can also exacerbate, and in some cases cause, \nphysical or psychiatric disabilities, such as gastrointestinal disorders, insomnia, eyesight \ndeterioration, heart palpitations, migraines, and profound fatigue.  Even those who endure the \neffects of isolation better than others are subjected to intolerable conditions, as they are forced to \nendure the hallucinations and screaming of other prisoners suffering the debilitating effects of \nisolation.  In addition, together with the social and sensory deprivation, the cold temperatures \ninterfere with sleep, likely contributing to feelings of anxiety and depression. \n69.  Prolonged isolation in stressful conditions also often causes prisoners with mental \nillness to harm themselves or attempt suicide.  DOC staff routinely make arbitrary \ndeterminations that prisoners who threaten to or actually harm themselves are “malingering” and \nso provide no treatment at all.  Defendants expose prisoners to a substantial risk of serious \n  22 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 23 of 61\n \nirreparable harm despite the fact that self-harm and suicide are entirely predictable consequences \nof placing people with mental illness in prolonged isolation. \n70.  There is also a well-established culture among many DOC staff of inflicting \nadditional gratuitous indignities and cruelties upon prisoners — acts that serve to exacerbate the \nmisery of the ordinary conditions of confinement at Northern.  Because prisoners are locked in \ntheir cells, staff have absolute power over each prisoner’s environment.  Staff can and often do \nuse their power to play games or engage in petty disputes, for example, by withholding a food \ntray or toilet paper, ignoring a request for medical care, or repeatedly using the intercom to insult \nthe prisoner or to play disruptive noises or music. \n71.  When a prisoner is outside of their cell during recreation or shower time, staff \noften perform “shakedowns” of the cell, ostensibly to search for contraband.  In practice, \nhowever, staff often use shakedowns as a pretext to tamper with a prisoner’s personal property.  \nOn numerous occasions, DOC staff have destroyed pictures of prisoners’ family members.  \n72.  The prolonged isolation of persons with mental illness causes long-term \npsychological harm.  The psychological effects of prolonged isolation are well-documented, \nsevere, and “analogous to the acute reactions suffered by torture and trauma victims.”  Craig \nHaney, Restricting the Use of Solitary Confinement, 2018 Ann. Rev. Criminology 285, 295 \n(2018).  Individuals subjected to prolonged isolation are at substantial risk of experiencing \n“heightened levels of anxiety and panic,” “irritability, aggression, and rage,” “paranoia . . . and \nviolent fantasies,” “cognitive dysfunction, hypersensitivity to stimuli, and hallucinations,” “loss \nof emotional control,” and “increased suicidality and instances of self-harm.”  Id. at 291; see also \nJesenia Pizarro & Vanja M. K. Stenius, Supermax Prisons: Their Rise, Current Practices, and \nEffect on Inmates, 84 Prison J. 248, 256 (2004) (noting “declines in mental functioning,” \n  23 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 24 of 61\n \n“difficulties in thinking, concentration and memory problems, and problems with impulse \ncontrol” in incarcerated people subject to prolonged isolation).  One leading survey of the \nliterature on the psychological effects of prolonged isolation concluded that prisoners subjected \nto prolonged isolation may develop “a confusional psychosis with intense agitation, fearfulness, \nand disorganization” and that “the harm caused by such confinement may result in prolonged or \npermanent psychiatric disability.”  Stuart Grassian, Psychiatric Effects of Solitary Confinement, \n22 Wash. U. J. L. & Pol’y 325, 354 (2006).    \n73.  Many courts have recognized the psychological harm inflicted by prolonged \nisolation.  In fact, this Court recently acknowledged the “growing consensus among the scientific \ncommunity that solitary confinement inflicts severe harm on prisoners.”  Reynolds v. Arnone, \n402 F. Supp. 3d 3, 12 (D. Conn. 2019).  See also Davis v. Ayala, 576 U.S. 257, 289 (2015) \n(Kennedy, J., concurring) (“[R]esearch still confirms what this Court suggested over a century \nago: Years on end of near-total isolation exact a terrible price.”); Ruiz v. Texas, 137 S. Ct. 1246, \n1247 (2017) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (noting the petitioner “ha[d] developed symptoms long \nassociated with solitary confinement, namely severe anxiety and depression, suicidal thoughts, \nhallucinations, disorientation, memory loss, and sleep difficulty”); Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.S. \n863, 926 (2015) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (“[I]t is well documented that . . . prolonged solitary \nconfinement produces numerous deleterious harms.”); Porter v. Clarke, 923 F.3d 348, 357 (4th \nCir. 2019) (finding that, based on the scientific literature, solitary confinement poses a \n“substantial risk of serious psychological and emotional harm”); Williams v. Sec’y Pa. Dep’t of \nCorr., 848 F.3d 549, 566-67 (3d Cir. 2017) (noting scientific consensus that solitary confinement \n“is psychologically painful, can be traumatic and harmful, and puts many of those who have \nbeen subject to it at risk of long-term . . . damage”).   \n  24 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 25 of 61\n \n74.  Prolonged isolation is also known to cause negative long-term physiological \neffects.  These effects may include “pains in the abdomen and muscle pains in the neck and \nback,” “dizziness and loss of appetite,” “lethargy and chronic tiredness,” and “a constellation of \nsymptoms — headaches, trembling, sweaty palms, and heart palpitations — that is commonly \nassociated with hypertension.”  Peter Scharff Smith, The Effects of Solitary Confinement on \nPrison Inmates: A Brief History and Review of the Literature, 34 Crime & Just. 441, 488-92 \n(2006); see also Craig Haney, Mental Health Issues in Long-Term Solitary and “Supermax” \nConfinement, 49 Crime & Delinq. 124, 133 (2003); Brie A. Williams et al., The Cardiovascular \nHealth Burdens of Solitary Confinement, 34 J. Gen. Internal Med. 1977, 1977 (2019).  The \nphysiological harm caused by prolonged isolation is closely linked to the psychological harms of \nthis isolation; worsened physical symptoms may aggravate psychological symptoms, and vice \nversa.  Justin D. Strong et al., The Body in Isolation: The Physical Health Impacts of \nIncarceration in Solitary Confinement, PloS ONE (2020). \n75.  United States and international institutions responsible for human rights and the \ntreatment of prisoners have recognized the devastating psychological and physiological impacts \nof prolonged isolation.  These institutions agree that prolonged isolation of individuals with \nmental illness violates standards of common decency.  In fact, there is broad consensus that \nindividuals with mental illness should not be placed in isolation unless absolutely necessary, \nunder medical supervision, and only for brief periods of time.  \n(a)  The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of \nPrisoners (“Mandela Rules”) prohibit isolation of prisoners with psychiatric disabilities \nwhen those conditions would exacerbate their disabilities.  G.A. Res. 70/175 (Dec. 17, \n2015).  \n  25 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 26 of 61\n \n(b)  The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has established that \nisolation “should be absolutely prohibited . . . for persons with mental disabilities.”  Press \nRelease, Organization of American States, IACHR Expresses Concern over Excessive \nUse of Solitary Confinement in the United States (July 18, 2013).  \n(c)  American Bar Association (“ABA”) standards recommend that “no \nprisoner diagnosed with serious mental illness should be placed in long-term segregated \nhousing.”  ABA, ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: Treatment of Prisoners (3d ed. \n2011) (“ABA Standards”).  \n(d)  The National Commission on Correctional Health Care states that \n“mentally ill individuals . . . should be excluded from solitary confinement of any \nduration.”  Nat’l Comm. On Corr. Health Care, Position Statement on Solitary \nConfinement (Apr. 2016). \n76.  Ultimately, DOC’s policies and practices of prolonged isolation trap people with \nmental illness, including those with serious mental illness and those at substantial risk of \ndeveloping serious mental illness, in a vicious cycle of deterioration and punishment.  Prolonged \nisolation causes prisoners’ mental health to deteriorate and prompts them to act out.  Those \nactions, in turn, prompt DOC to respond with even harsher sanctions — including excessive use \nof restraints — that cause prisoners’ mental health to deteriorate still further.  Prisoners with \nmental illness find themselves caught in a downward spiral. \nE.  DOC’s In-Cell Shackling of Prisoners with Mental Illness  \n77.  Defendants not only subject prisoners with mental illness to prolonged isolation in \nconcrete cells but also violently extract them from these cells, shackle them, and then leave them \nshackled for hours or even days in filthy and freezing “strip cells.” \n  26 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 27 of 61\n \n78.  DOC staff, for example, routinely respond punitively with in-cell shackling when \nprisoners’ mental illness is manifested through self-injurious or other behaviors.  Staff respond \nwith force rather than appropriate mental health treatment.  Defendants, in fact, have failed to \nprovide staff with the training required to identify and manage prisoners with mental illness. \n79.  DOC staff also engage in violent cell extractions in order to restrain prisoners \nwith in-cell shackling.  DOC staff routinely initiate these violent cell extractions in response to \nprisoners’ nonviolent behaviors such as covering cell windows with paper or banging cell doors.  \nPrisoners often engage in these behaviors as a result of the very conditions of isolation and \nextreme stress that DOC creates and maintains. \n80.  During cell extractions, a group of DOC staff wearing body armor surround the \nprisoner’s cell, spray chemical agent through the trap, force open the door, and restrain the \nprisoner, often assaulting the prisoner in the process.  DOC staff then shackle the prisoner’s legs \nand wrists, binding their hands to their feet with a tether chain and fastening a belly chain around \ntheir waist.  DOC staff may also employ a “black box” that fastens the tether and belly chain \ntogether and prevents prisoners from having any range of motion with their hands.  Through a \nmethod of restraint called “four points,” DOC staff may also shackle a prisoner’s hands and feet \nto a metal bed.  In some instances, DOC staff employ an “upgraded status” of four-point \nrestraints whereby they add mechanical restraints to the rubber cuffs used to shackle a prisoner.  \n81.  DOC staff then dump these prisoners in filthy and freezing concrete “strip cells” \nwhere they are left alone but still chained and shackled.  The cells’ floors and walls are \nfrequently covered with urine and feces, causing some prisoners to develop skin rashes and \ninfections.  DOC staff frequently leave prisoners barefoot and wearing nothing but a one-piece \nsmock (or “Ferguson gown”), causing prisoners to shiver for hours on end.   \n  27 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 28 of 61\n \n82.  The use of in-cell shackling and the duration of prisoners’ placement in such \nrestraints is punitive and arbitrary.  DOC staff subject prisoners to in-cell shackling despite the \nlack of any safety or security justification, or for far longer than is required to ensure safety and \nsecurity.  Staff commonly keep prisoners in chains for a full 24 hours, and sometimes for days at \na time, long after they have ceased their disruptive behavior and after any plausible safety or \nsecurity justification has expired.  Prisoners are left shackled for these extended periods of time \nwithout meaningful monitoring, in violation of DOC administrative directives and with \ndeliberate indifference to and disregard for their safety and well-being. \n83.  Significantly, pursuant to Administrative Directive 6.5, as applied by Defendants \nand their subordinates, restraints are used not only to prevent escape or injury, but also to ensure \ncompliance with an order.  This is true regardless of the order, the severity of the violation, or the \nreason for the behavior.  DOC staff have chained prisoners as punishment for past conduct, \nincluding for common, nonviolent infractions that predictably arise from confining people with \nmental illness in environments of prolonged isolation and stress.  For example, prisoners \ncovering up a cell window with paper, a behavior that prisoners engage in as a last resort to seek \nthe attention of staff, frequently results in in-cell shackling. \n84.  DOC staff also use violent extractions and in-cell shackling to respond to self-\nharm and suicide attempts by prisoners with mental illness — instead of responding with \nappropriate options designed to safely de-escalate mental health crises.   \n85.  For example, DOC’s own policies permit “therapeutic restraints” in response to \ninstances where an individual poses a serious threat to his own safety.  “Therapeutic restraints” \nentail the use of softer restraints, in contrast to the metal chains used when prisoners are \nshackled, for a limited time period.   \n  28 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 29 of 61\n \n86.  However, DOC staff often choose not to use “therapeutic restraints” because they \n— without any medical justification — determine that individuals who engage in self-harm are \nmerely “malingering.”  Thus, DOC staff frequently subject prisoners with mental illness to \nviolent cell extractions and in-cell shackling based on arbitrary and capricious determinations by \nstaff lacking any medical qualifications that the prisoners are “malingering.”  Prisoners subjected \nto in-cell shackling, unlike “therapeutic restraints,” are not closely monitored by medical staff.  \nThis use of force, in turn, significantly exacerbates prisoners’ mental illness, makes them more \nprone to self-harm or suicide, and increases the already substantial risk that they will suffer \nserious harm. \n87.  Even when DOC staff do recognize a mental health emergency, they often \nrespond with further isolation and punishment rather than treatment.  Mental health professionals \nare authorized to place individuals on Behavioral Observation Status (“BOS”), whereby \nindividuals may be stripped of clothing and shoes, forced into a sleeveless quilted gown, \ndeprived of all personal property, and denied all social or legal visits and calls.  A person may be \nconfined to BOS while in in-cell restraints, or they may be confined in the medical unit, in which \ncase they may be subjected to therapeutic restraints. \n88.  BOS was originally designed to be used only for a limited period of time, on the \nrecommendation of qualified mental health professionals, and for the purposes of ensuring a \nprisoner’s immediate safety and security.  Today, by contrast, DOC staff regularly rely on BOS \nto “extinguish maladaptive behaviors,” per Administrative Directive 9.4, seeking to coerce \ncompliance among prisoners with mental illness.   \n  29 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 30 of 61\n \n89.  There is no medical or therapeutic justification for this so-called “treatment.”  \nDOC staff often impose BOS concurrently with in-cell shackling, and it is not uncommon for \nDOC staff to shuttle individuals between the various restrictive statuses, sometimes for weeks.   \n90.  Defendants’ policy and practice of placing and leaving prisoners with mental \nillness in in-cell shackling is dangerous, painful, and injurious.  The tight shackling of hands and \nlegs has caused bleeding on or around prisoners’ wrists and ankles and has left prisoners with \nlasting scars, bruises, and numbness.  The “short-chaining” of the tether chain connecting hands \nto legs has prevented prisoners from being able to stand up straight or lie down in a fully \nextended manner, forcing them into a crouched position and causing significant, lasting pain. \n91.  Defendants’ policy and practice of placing prisoners in in-cell shackling is \ndegrading and interferes with basic and necessary life activities.  The “strip cell” is typically very \ncold, yet prisoners do not have blankets, and the restraints prevent them from moving to keep \nthemselves warm.  Shackled prisoners are also unable to properly eat or use the toilet.   \n92.  Subjecting prisoners to in-cell shackling falls far outside basic standards of \ndecency and accepted professional norms.  The ABA directs that in-cell shackling should be \nused sparingly, and never “as a form of punishment or retaliation.”  ABA Standard 23-5.9(a).  If \nrestraints are used for “medical or mental health purposes,” then it must be under the \nauthorization of a “qualified medical or mental health professional.”  ABA Standard 23-5.9(d).  \nThe use of restraints must also be of the “least restrictive form[]” possible, and “only as long as \nthe need exists.”  ABA Standard 23-5.9(b).  DOC staff routinely violate these standards and use \nrestraints excessively and without any medical authorization.    \n93.  In many instances, the use of in-cell shackling rises to the level of torture.  The \nMandela Rules prohibit “[t]he use of chains, irons or other instruments of restraint which are \n  30 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 31 of 61\n \ninherently degrading or painful,” and, like the ABA Standards, prohibit the use of restraints of \nany kind “as a sanction for disciplinary offenses.”  The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules \nfor the Treatment of Prisoners, Rule 43.  Even when the use of restraints is authorized, restraints \nare to be used only in the “least intrusive method” possible, and “only for the time period \nrequired.”  Id., Rule 48.  When these rules are violated — as routinely happens at Northern — \nthe use of restraints may amount to torture.  Report of the Special Rapporteur, Theo van Boven, \n¶ 45, U.N. Doc E/CN.4/2004/56 (Dec. 23, 2003).  \n94.  This is particularly true if the person being subjected to excessive and punitive \nrestraints has a mental illness, because such persons are particularly vulnerable to the mental and \npsychological harms of being immobilized.  Report of the Special Rapporteur, ¶ 63, 89 U.N. \nDoc. A/HRC/22/53 (Feb. 1, 2013).  As recently as last year, the UN Special Rapporteur on \nTorture concluded that the “Connecticut Department of Correction[’s] . . . repressive measures, \nsuch as prolonged isolation or indefinite isolation, excessive use of in-cell shackling and \nneedlessly intrusive strip searches . . . may well amount to torture.”  Press Release, U.N. Office \nof the High Comm’r for Human Rights, United States: Prolonged Solitary Confinement Amounts \nto Psychological Torture, Says UN Expert (Feb. 28, 2020). \nF.  DOC’s Failure to Make Reasonable Modifications to Policies, Practices, and \nProcedures to Avoid Discriminating Against Prisoners with Mental Illness  \n95.  DOC fails to make reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures \nthat are necessary to accommodate prisoners with mental illness and that would allow those \nprisoners meaningful access to services, programs, and activities afforded to other prisoners.  \nDOC has failed to reasonably modify its programs, services, and activities to provide DRCT’s \nConstituents with needed mental health services in DOC’s other facilities and instead transfers \n  31 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 32 of 61\n \nthem into Isolative Statuses, which currently begin at Northern, where they are subjected to \nprolonged isolation and in-cell shackling. \n96.  DOC fails to reasonably modify its policies, practices, and procedures when \nassigning prisoners with mental illness to Isolative Statuses and housing them at Northern; \nsubjecting prisoners with mental illness to in-cell shackling and Behavioral Observation Status \n(“BOS”); and disciplining prisoners with mental illness and holding them back from progression \nthrough Isolative Statuses.  DOC’s failure to furnish reasonable modifications to prisoners with \nmental illness punishes prisoners with mental illness for disability related conduct, exacerbates \nexisting mental illness, and, sometimes, causes development of additional mental illness and/or \nexacerbation of symptoms of existing mental illness. \n97.  For example, DOC has a policy, practice, and procedure or excluding certain \npsychiatric diagnoses as being “untreatable.”  DOC draws a false distinction between different \ntypes of mental disorders.  DOC differentiates between mental disorders such as schizophrenia \nand bipolar disorder, formerly characterized as “Axis I” disorders in the APA’s Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Illness (“DSM-IV”), and Borderline Personality Disorder (“BPD”) \nand Antisocial Personality Disorder (“ASPD”), formerly characterized as “Axis II” disorders in \nthe DSM-IV.  The DSM-V eliminated the Axis I and Axis II labels, but DOC’s false distinction \nbetween these disorders continues. \n98.  Borderline Personality Disorder (“BPD”) is a serious and treatable mental illness.  \nSymptoms of BPD include recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating \nbehavior; affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood; chronic feelings of emptiness; \nand stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms.  A BPD diagnosis may be \n“defined, in part, by recurrent suicidal and self-injurious behaviors.”  Up to seventy percent of \n  32 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 33 of 61\n \npeople living with BPD attempt suicide during their lifetime; up to ten percent of people \ndiagnosed with BPD die of suicide.  Michelle M. Wedig et al., Predictors of Suicide Attempts in \nPatients with Borderline Personality Disorder over 16 Years of Prospective Follow-up, 42 \nPsychol. Med. 2395 (2012).  \n99.  Antisocial Personality Disorder (“ASPD”) is also a serious and treatable mental \nillness.  Symptoms of ASPD include failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful \nbehaviors, impulsivity, and failure to plan ahead.  Prisoners with ASPD are more likely to \nattempt suicide than those without.  “Individuals with ASPD diagnoses may be at increased risk \nfor multiple suicide attempts over the course of their lifetime.”  Emily B. Ansell et al., \nPersonality Disorder Risk Factors for Suicide Attempts over 10 Years of Follow-up, 6 \nPersonality Disorders 161 (2016).  \n100.  As a result of DOC’s policies, practices, and procedures that erroneously deem \nBPD, ASPD, and other mental health conditions as being “untreatable” mental illnesses, DOC \nrefuses to provide reasonable modifications for individuals diagnosed with such mental health \ndisabilities.  DOC does not make reasonable modifications to prevent prisoners with BPD and \nASPD, or numerous other mental illnesses, from being assigned to Isolative Statuses and sent to \nNorthern.  To the contrary, DOC characterizes these as “untreatable” conditions and regularly \ntargets persons with BPD and ASPD for Administrative Segregation and other Isolative Statuses.  \n101.  Once transferred into Isolative Statuses and moved to Northern, DOC staff often \nerroneously deem people diagnosed with BPD, ASPD, and other serious mental illnesses to be \n“malingering” and interpret their symptoms as willful misconduct that is met with further \npunishment such as in-cell shackling and BOS.   \n  33 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 34 of 61\n \n102.  Many prisoners with mental illness also receive disciplinary charges for behavior \nthat is a symptom of their mental illness.  Some prisoners have received disciplinary charges for \nself-harm or for merely reporting to staff that they feel suicidal.  Prisoners have also received \ndisciplinary charges for other nonthreatening conduct that is symptomatic of their illnesses, such \nas shouting, kicking the doors, and smearing their feces.  In fact, when individuals with BPD and \nASPD engage in extreme and horrific acts of self-harm and suicidal ideation, DOC staff \nparadoxically rely on those diagnoses to characterize these behaviors as disingenuous and \nmanipulative rather than recognizing them as behavioral manifestations of diagnosed mental \nillness. \n103.  Thus, as a result of DOC’s failure to make reasonable modifications to policies, \npractices, and procedures, prisoners with mental illness are often held back from progression \nthrough the Isolative Statuses and face extended or even indefinite stays in prolonged isolation.  \nG.  Prisoners with Mental Illness Confirm the Use of Prolonged Isolation, In-Cell \nShackling, and Other Discrimination  \n(1)  Kyle Lamar Paschal-Barros \n104.  Deja Paschal, who legally changed his name to Kyle Lamar Paschal-Barros in \nFebruary 2017, is a 26-year-old man currently confined at Northern.  Mr. Barros is a constituent \nof DRCT who has mental illness, as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 10802.  He is also a qualified \nindividual with a disability, as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102 and 29 U.S.C. § 705(20). \n105.  Mr. Barros first entered DOC custody in 2012 when he was just seventeen years \nold.  Mr. Barros has engaged in significant acts of self-harm and has attempted suicide multiple \ntimes while in DOC custody.  Since January 2017, Mr. Barros has primarily been confined at \nNorthern where he has been subjected to prolonged isolation.  Mr. Barros’ experiences at \nNorthern have severely exacerbated his mental illnesses.    \n  34 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 35 of 61\n \n106.  Mr. Barros has a long and complex history of serious mental illness, dating back \nto childhood.  From the time he was eight years old, Mr. Barros has been diagnosed with and \ntreated for bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, BPD, posttraumatic stress disorder \n(“PTSD”), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”), and obsessive-compulsive \ndisorder.  Some of these diagnoses occurred in community treatment settings, and many of these \ndiagnoses resulted from evaluation by DOC mental health practitioners.  All of these diagnoses \nwere made by qualified Connecticut mental health practitioners.   \n107.  Before and during his incarceration, Mr. Barros has been prescribed numerous \nmedications to treat his mental illnesses, including Prozac, Vistaril, prazosin, Paxil, Ritalin, \nAbilify, and lithium.  Before his incarceration, Mr. Barros received intensive individualized \ntreatment plans for his mental illnesses. \n108.  Shortly after his admission to the Manson Youth Institution in 2012, DOC \npractitioners identified Mr. Barros’ profound mental health needs and transferred him to Garner, \nDOC’s designated facility for “male offenders with significant mental health issues.”  He \nremained incarcerated at Garner from approximately July 2012 to January 2017. \n109.  While he was at Garner, DOC practitioners diagnosed Mr. Barros with numerous \nmental illnesses, including bipolar disorder, PTSD, and ADHD.  He was placed on a number of \npsychiatric medications that provided some relief from the symptoms of his mental illnesses.  \n110.  Mr. Barros discovered that books were an important tool for his mental well-\nbeing, as they provided some self-help strategies for dealing with daily challenges.  Mr. Barros \nbecame an avid reader and accumulated many books.   \n  35 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 36 of 61\n \n111.  Even so, Mr. Barros continued to struggle.  When situations became \nunmanageable for him, Mr. Barros decompensated.  His deteriorating mental health condition led \nto self-harm, e.g., head-banging, and suicide attempts. \n112.  In January 2017, overwhelmed by symptoms of his mental illnesses, Mr. Barros \nattempted suicide by hanging himself.  Garner mental health staff placed Mr. Barros on suicide \nwatch.  Several days later, ignoring that its own staff recognized Mr. Barros was in mental health \ncrisis, DOC placed Mr. Barros on Administrative Segregation status and transferred him to \nNorthern.  \n113.  As Mr. Barros entered Phase I of Administrative Segregation at Northern, DOC \nstaff characterized his erratic and self-injurious behaviors as short-term behavioral problems \nrather than symptoms of his underlying mental illnesses.  Despite his well-documented history of \nserious mental illness and the recent suicide attempt, DOC staff discontinued all of his \npsychiatric medications.  At the time that Mr. Barros was taken off his medications, the injuries \nfrom his head-banging were still fresh. \n114.  Subjected to prolonged isolation in Northern’s isolating and disorienting \nconditions, and without needed medications, Mr. Barros rapidly decompensated.  He experienced \nintensifying paranoia, delusions, trauma-related flashbacks, hopelessness, and despair.  \n115.  As the symptoms of his mental illnesses escalated, Mr. Barros began \naccumulating disciplinary sanctions for behaviors such as covering his cell window with paper, \nfailing to comply with orders, and engaging in altercations with DOC staff.  Mr. Barros engaged \nin these behaviors as a direct response to the symptoms he was experiencing.  These infractions \nprevented Mr. Barros from progressing through Phase I of Administrative Segregation for \napproximately sixteen months, four times the minimum required time. \n  36 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 37 of 61\n \n116.  In May 2018, Mr. Barros finally reached Phase II of Administrative Segregation \nand was transferred to the Walker facility (“Walker”) of the MacDougall-Walker Correctional \nInstitution.  At Walker, Mr. Barros continued experiencing debilitating symptoms of mental \nillness.  He hallucinated that his cell was on fire and cut his arm with a sharp lid.  Mental health \npersonnel at Walker resumed his psychiatric medication. \n117.  In the months that followed, Mr. Barros’ mental state continued to decline, and he \nwas transferred back to Garner for stabilization in September 2018.  At Garner, mental health \npersonnel effectively calibrated his medication regime, and he was deemed stable enough to \nreturn to Phase II of Administrative Segregation at Walker. \n118.  Shortly after his arrival at Walker, DOC staff informed Mr. Barros that they “lost” \nhis books.  Mr. Barros covered his cell window with paper to communicate his distress.  When \nMr. Barros refused to remove the paper, DOC staff performed a violent cell extraction and \nconfiscated Mr. Barros’ remaining books.  In October 2018, as a consequence of this episode, \nDOC regressed Mr. Barros back to Phase I of Administrative Segregation and transferred him \nback to Northern.    \n119.  Since October 2018, Mr. Barros has left Northern only once.  In July 2019, \nMr. Barros was transferred back to Garner for two months of intensive treatment after his mental \nhealth badly deteriorated due to his months of isolation.  Mr. Barros has remained in Phase I of \nAdministrative Segregation and been incarcerated at Northern continuously since September \n2019.  Mr. Barros is typically confined to his small cell for 22 hours per day. \n120.  While at Northern, Mr. Barros has been subjected to in-cell shackling more than \nten times.  On almost every occasion, he was experiencing a mental health crisis and sought \ntreatment.  But instead of treatment, DOC responded by shackling him which served only to \n  37 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 38 of 61\n \nexacerbate his mental health crisis.  Sometimes, Mr. Barros covered his window as a desperate \ncall for mental health intervention and was subsequently cited for a disciplinary violation and \nplaced in in-cell shackles.  Once, in early 2018, he was shackled after a suicide attempt that DOC \nmedical staff deemed “nonlethal.”  \n121.  Each time he was subjected to in-cell shackling, Northern staff left Mr. Barros \nnaked (but for a safety gown) and chained in an unsanitary and cold “strip cell.”  Mr. Barros felt \nas though he was trapped in a “cold cement doghouse,” where he was forced to dump his food \nonto wax paper on the floor and eat like a dog.  Mr. Barros experienced traumatic flashbacks, \nand staff sometimes compounded his distress by playing continuous bell sounds over the \nintercom into the strip cell where he lay shackled. \n122.  The absence of rehabilitative or other meaningful programming at Northern \nfurther impairs Mr. Barros’ parole eligibility.  Under his “Offender Accountability Plan,” in \norder to be eligible for parole, Mr. Barros is required to participate in classes on anger \nmanagement, “good intentions, bad choices,” and restorative relationship-building with victims.  \nWhile these programs are offered at other DOC facilities, they are not offered at Northern.  \nFurther, when Mr. Barros was on Administrative Segregation status at Walker, the parole board \nnotified him that, so long as he is on Administrative Segregation status, Mr. Barros has no \nopportunity for a parole hearing.  \n123.  Mr. Barros has recurring nightmares about the prison and its suffocating physical \nstructure, along with its extremely harmful and mentally damaging practices. \n(2)  Kezlyn Méndez  \n124.  Kezlyn Méndez is a 34-year-old man currently incarcerated in the MacDougall \nbuilding (“MacDougall”) of the MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution in Suffield, \n  38 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 39 of 61\n \nConnecticut.  Mr. Méndez is a constituent of DRCT who has mental illness, as defined in \n42 U.S.C. § 10802.  He is also a qualified individual with a disability, as defined in 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12102 and 29 U.S.C. § 705(20). \n125.  Mr. Méndez first entered DOC custody in 2005, at age eighteen.  Mr. Méndez has \nengaged in acts of self-harm and has attempted suicide multiple times while in DOC custody.  \nOver his time in DOC custody, Mr. Méndez has spent more than five years at Northern where he \nwas subjected to prolonged isolation and repeated in-cell shackling.    \n126.  Mr. Méndez has struggled with mental illness his entire life.  Beginning in early \nchildhood, he has received many psychiatric diagnoses, including bipolar disorder and PTSD.  \nMany of these diagnoses were made by mental health practitioners within the State of \nConnecticut, and some of these diagnoses were made or confirmed by DOC mental health \npersonnel.   \n127.  Mr. Méndez has a significant history of childhood trauma and mental illness that \nleaves him highly vulnerable to stressful triggers.  \n128.  At age six, Mr. Méndez was hit by a police car and sustained catastrophic \nphysical injuries, including a head injury that left him unconscious.  He underwent over three \nyears of rehabilitation, and had to relearn to read, write, speak, and walk.  He has a minor speech \nimpediment and continues to experience blackouts.  \n129.  Mr. Méndez received both inpatient and outpatient psychiatric treatment in \nseveral Connecticut institutions throughout his childhood.  \n130.  Between 2005 and the present, Mr. Méndez has served four sentences in DOC \ncustody, totaling almost fourteen years.  Throughout his time in custody, Mr. Méndez has \n  39 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 40 of 61\n \nconsistently experienced symptoms of his mental illnesses, such as attempting suicide, anxiety, \nparanoia, flashbacks to previous violent events, sleep disturbances, anhedonia, and depression.  \n131.  When Mr. Méndez initially entered DOC custody at age eighteen, DOC clinicians \nrecognized his mental illnesses and transferred him to Garner for intensive treatment following a \nsuicide attempt.  Mr. Méndez was at Garner from approximately December 2005 to April 2006. \n132.  In July 2006, despite its awareness of Mr. Méndez’s mental illnesses, DOC sent \nMr. Méndez to Northern.  This transfer came less than three months after Mr. Méndez left \nGarner.  \n133.  The prolonged isolation that Mr. Méndez experienced at Northern led to a \nsignificant deterioration in his mental health.  He became ambivalent about human interaction, \nwavering between a strong desire for human connection and a pronounced fear and mistrust of \nothers.  He also experienced hallucinations, hearing disembodied voices and having \nconversations with people that were not there.  \n134.  In 2012, DOC again placed Mr. Méndez at Garner in light of his deteriorating \nmental health.  Nonetheless, DOC returned Mr. Méndez to isolation at Northern in 2013.  \nMr. Méndez was most recently incarcerated at Northern from December 2017 to May 2018. \n135.  All told, DOC has cycled Mr. Méndez in and out of Northern on six separate \noccasions, from 2005 to the present.  He has spent more than five years there.   \n136.  Northern’s harsh environment exacerbated Mr. Méndez’s mental illnesses, and he \noften found compliance with DOC policies more difficult.  For example, desperate for human \ninteraction, he would put his hand through the trap of his cell door, in violation of DOC policy.  \nIn addition, Mr. Méndez accumulated disciplinary sanctions as his mental health deteriorated, \nranging from disobeying direct orders to physical altercations with DOC staff.  These \n  40 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 41 of 61\n \ndisciplinary violations prolonged Mr. Méndez’s confinement at Northern and resulted in \nadditional punishments, such as in-cell shackling.  \n137.  DOC subjected Mr. Méndez to in-cell shackling at Northern on three occasions.  \nOn each occasion, DOC left Mr. Méndez shackled for between 24 and 72 hours.  Each time, \nMr. Méndez was also strip searched and left to wear only a jumper (with no boxers or socks) \nwhile chained in cold and unsanitary environments, including in a strip cell that had feces on the \nwall and smelled of ammonia.  While shackled, Mr. Méndez was unable to physically wipe \nhimself after using the bathroom, and had to urinate in the sink because the toilet in the cell was \nleft unflushed.  \n138.  In one particularly violent instance, DOC staff subjected him to sexual and \nphysical abuse while forcefully restraining him after ordering him to take off his clothes.  One \nofficer punched him in the stomach, and a second grabbed and twisted Mr. Méndez’s testicles. \n139.  Mr. Méndez’s mental health symptoms have been exacerbated by his repeated \nplacement in prolonged isolation at Northern and repeated in-cell shackling.  He experiences \nheightened anxiety and paranoia, which has led to episodes where he experiences difficulty \nbreathing, heart palpitations, and an inability to concentrate.  He also feels deep discomfort with \nliving in close proximity to other people and has struggled with frequent suicidal thoughts.   \n140.  To this day, Mr. Méndez remains at risk of return to Northern.  The possibility of \nreturning to Northern causes Mr. Méndez to feel fear and anxiety, as he recognizes that Northern \nexacerbated his mental health symptoms.  In particular, Mr. Méndez fears and expects that \nfurther deterioration of his mental health would occur should he be transferred back to \nNorthern’s harsh and isolative environment. \n  41 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 42 of 61\n \n(3)  Tyrone Spence \n141.  Tyrone Spence is a 29-year-old man in DOC custody currently incarcerated at \nCheshire Correctional Institution in Cheshire, CT.  Mr. Spence is a constituent of DRCT who has \nmental illness, as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 10802.  He is also a qualified individual with a \ndisability, as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102 and 29 U.S.C. § 705(20). \n142.  Mr. Spence has been in DOC custody since July 2010, when he was nineteen \nyears old.  Mr. Spence has spent over three years at Northern.  He was incarcerated at Northern \nfor all but two months of a period from March 2011 to November 2013, and he was transferred \nin and out of the facility multiple times between December 2017 and September 2019.  While at \nNorthern, Mr. Spence was subjected to prolonged isolation and repeated in-cell shackling.  He is \nat constant and continued risk of being transferred back to, and being confined at, Northern. \n143.  Mr. Spence has a long history of serious mental illness, including PTSD, anxiety, \nBPD, depression, and dissociation.  His mental health symptoms include suicidal ideation, self-\ninjurious behaviors, and he has attempted suicide on several occasions while incarcerated.  \n144.  Mr. Spence suffered prenatal exposure to cocaine and significant neglect and \nphysical abuse in early childhood.  Throughout his childhood and adolescence, Mr. Spence \nreceived psychiatric care for his mental illnesses at numerous facilities, including the Institute of \nLiving, Riverview Children’s Hospital, and Yale New Haven Hospital.   \n145.  Before and during his incarceration, Mr. Spence had been prescribed medication \nto treat his mental illness, including, but not limited to chlorpromazine (Thorazine), clonazepam \n(Klonopin), clonidine, and guanfacine. \n146.  On May 6, 2018, Mr. Spence asked to be seen by Northern mental health staff \nthrough written requests and subsequent verbal appeals to his custody officers.  But mental \n  42 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 43 of 61\n \nhealth staff refused to see him until the following day.  On May 7, 2018, Mr. Spence cut his \nwrists and ingested pills and battery acid.  \n147.  Staff at Northern have given Mr. Spence disciplinary sanctions for behaviors that \nare symptoms of his mental illness, including instances of self-harm.  The isolating conditions at \nNorthern contributed to these symptoms.  \n148.  For instance, after the suicide attempt on May 7, 2018, Mr. Spence received a \ndisciplinary ticket on the grounds that he had disrupted the health and safety of staff and other \nprisoners at Northern.  \n149.  In September 2019, Mr. Spence again attempted suicide using pills while at \nNorthern.  He was then sent to Garner, where he completed the Administrative Segregation \nprogram.  \n150.  At Northern, Mr. Spence has been subjected to in-cell shackling numerous times.  \nHe recalls being shackled more than 50 times while in DOC custody and believes that a majority \nof these instances occurred at Northern.  Mr. Spence recalls being shackled with four-point \nrestraints more than ten times.  He has also been subjected to black box restraints, an experience \nhe remembers as “the worst”: “You can’t sit down without hurting your hands or your wrists.  \nWhen you sit down it pushes the chain into your wrist.  The only way you can be comfortable is \nif you stand up.” \n151.  DOC staff subjected Mr. Spence to in-cell shackling in response to Mr. Spence’s \nfrequent instances of self-harm, which DOC staff characterized as behavioral and not worthy of \nmedical intervention.  When Mr. Spence cut himself, DOC staff accused him of engaging in \nattention-seeking behavior and subjected him to in-cell shackling.  In fact, Mr. Spence’s \n  43 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 44 of 61\n \ninstances of self-harm were a direct outgrowth of his mental illnesses and his worsening \ncondition due to Northern’s isolating environment. \n152.  The possibility of returning to Northern continues to haunt Mr. Spence.  After \ncompleting the Administrative Segregation program, Mr. Spence he was placed on “Special \nMonitoring” status leaving him under constant threat of return to Northern.   \n153.  Mr. Spence has suffered from acute anxiety as a result of his experiences being \nshackled.  He has found that seeing shackles or experiencing shackling can quickly trigger \nfeelings of anxiety.  After his experiences at Northern, he continues to fear experiencing violence \nwhen he is around DOC staff. \n154.  Mr. Spence received numerous disciplinary tickets for self-harm, a manifestation \nof his mental illness.  As a result, he lost various privileges, such as phone and commissary \naccess. \n155.  Mr. Spence has also been denied access to programs as a result of his mental \nhealth symptoms.  While in the Administrative Segregation program, he sought access to \nprogramming, particularly the opportunity to participate in a mental health group, but was \nrepeatedly rebuffed by DOC staff. \nH.  Defendants Have Refused to Stop the Cruel and Unusual Mistreatment of \nPrisoners with Mental Illness  \n156.  The cruel and unusual conditions of confinement described above both punish \nindividuals and exacerbate their mental illness, leading to a downward spiral of further \npunishment and further psychiatric deterioration.  \n157.  Defendants have had full knowledge of those conditions and of their devastating \neffects on incarcerated people.  Indeed, Defendants’ own Restrictive Housing Matrix provides \nthat prisoners at Northern are to be seen by a mental health professional within 30 days and then \n  44 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 45 of 61\n \nevery 90 days thereafter.  Nevertheless, Defendants have condoned or been deliberately \nindifferent to the underlying conditions and mistreatment of prisoners with mental illness. \n158.  Defendants have repeatedly been made aware of these conditions by lawmakers, \noversight bodies, litigation, prisoners’ grievances, media reporting, and other means, but have \nfailed to take reasonable corrective action.  Former DOC Commissioner Rollin Cook once said, \n“When you isolate people and when you lock them up and don’t give them access to speak to \nother people or see light, that makes them worse. . . .  It doesn’t make them better.”  Whittney \nEvans, Outgoing Utah Corrections Boss Wants to Make People Better than They Arrived, KUER \n(Apr. 18, 2018).  Unfortunately, Commissioner Cook did not do anything effectual to change the \nconditions and practices at Northern. \n159.  On November 23, 2020, DRCT sent a letter to Angel Quiros, Acting DOC \nCommissioner, and Roger Bowles, Northern Warden, expressing grave concern over the \nprolonged isolation and in-cell shackling of prisoners with mental illness at Northern.  DRCT’s \nletter was received by DOC on November 24, 2020.  In the letter, DRCT requested that DOC \nconfirm it will implement the following changes: \n(a)  immediately and permanently cease the use of in-cell restraints on \nindividuals with mental illness, including those at substantial risk of developing serious \nmental illness, at Northern; \n(b)  immediately and permanently cease subjecting individuals with mental \nillness, including those at substantial risk of developing serious mental illness, at \nNorthern to prolonged isolation; and  \n(c)  immediately cease subjecting any persons at Northern to prolonged \nisolation or in-cell restraints until such time that DOC demonstrates that it has \n  45 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 46 of 61\n \nimplemented an independent and effective mechanism to screen out all persons with \nmental illness, including those at substantial risk of developing serious mental illness.   \n160.  On January 22, 2021, DOC responded that the letter had been received but was \ndelayed in reaching the Commissioner’s Office, and that the allegations were being reviewed.  \nDRCT responded to DOC’s letter but DOC has not yet provided any substantive response.  \n161.  On February 4, 2021, DRCT filed the original Complaint in this action.  Four \ndays later, Governor Ned Lamont announced that DOC “plans to close” Northern.  But Northern \nhas not yet been closed.  If and when Northern does close, DRCT’s Constituents will remain in \nDOC custody and remain subject to and/or at imminent risk of prolonged isolation and in-cell \nshackling in other Connecticut state correctional institutions.  Moreover, there would be nothing \npreventing DOC from subsequently reopening Northern or a similar institution purpose built for \nprolonged isolation and inhuman treatment of prisoners.   \n162.  The inhuman mistreatment of DRCT’s Constituents in DOC custody described \nherein must stop – whether effected by DOC staff at Northern or any other Connecticut state \ncorrectional institution.  But that mistreatment is likely to persist unless enjoined by this Court.  \nDRCT has no alternative adequate remedy at law.  \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFirst Cause of Action \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983: Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments;  \nprolonged isolation of individuals with serious mental illness) \n \n163.  DRCT repeats and realleges each allegation set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 162 \nabove as if fully set forth herein. \n  46 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 47 of 61\n \n164.  This claim is brought against Defendants Quiros and Bowles in their official \ncapacity.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles acted under color of state law at all times relevant \nhereto and in connection with all events described herein.   \n165.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law, by and pursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, \nand practice, have violated and continue to violate the rights of DRCT’s Constituents by \ndepriving them of their right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment guaranteed by the \nEighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied to the State of Connecticut \nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.   \n166.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law, by and pursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, \nand practice of prolonged isolation of DRCT’s Constituents, have subjected DRCT’s \nConstituents to dangerous and degrading mistreatment, caused them serious pain and injury, \nplaced them at substantial risk of serious physical and psychological injury, acted contrary to \nstandards of decency, and denied them the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities.  \nDefendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees and others acting in \nconcert with them under color of state law, by and pursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, and \npractice of prolonged isolation of DRCT’s Constituents, continue to subject DRCT’s \nConstituents to dangerous and degrading mistreatment, cause them serious pain and injury, place \nthem at substantial risk of serious physical and psychological injury, act contrary to standards of \ndecency, and deny them the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities. \n167.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law, by and pursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, \n  47 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 48 of 61\n \nand practice of subjecting DRCT’s Constituents to prolonged isolation (1) have unnecessarily \nand wantonly inflicted, and continue to unnecessarily and wantonly inflict, pain upon them; \n(2) have acted and continue to act with deliberate indifference to their health, safety, and serious \nmedical needs; and (3) knew and continue to know the risk to the health, safety, and serious \nmedical needs of DRCT’s Constituents but have disregarded that risk and failed to take any \nreasonable measures to abate that risk. \n168.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles and their agents, officials, employees and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law, by and pursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, \nand practice have subjected and continue to subject DRCT’s Constituents to prolonged isolation \nfor punitive or retaliatory purposes, and not in a good faith effort to ensure safety or security or, \nat times, maintained them in prolonged isolation for longer than safety and security required.  \n169.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles authorized, condoned, and failed to exercise their \nsupervisory authority to prevent the illegal prolonged isolation of DRCT’s Constituents by their \nagents, officials, employees, and others acting in concert with them under color of state law, and \nare continuing to authorize, condone, and fail to exercise their supervisory authority to stop that \nillegal practice.  \n170.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law to subject prisoners with mental illness to \nprolonged isolation, have inflicted, and continue to inflict, cruel and unusual punishment on \nDRCT’s Constituents in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as \napplied to the State of Connecticut through the Fourteenth Amendment and enforceable through \n42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n  48 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 49 of 61\n \n171.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and all \npersons acting in concert with them under color of state law, are the proximate cause of the \nongoing deprivation of constitutional rights of DRCT’s Constituents. \n172.  As a result of the actions of Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, \nofficials, employees, and others acting in concert with them under color of state law, DRCT’s \nConstituents have suffered and continue to suffer irreparable harm.  \n173.  Unless enjoined, Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, \nemployees and others acting in concert with them under color of state law, will continue the \nprolonged isolation of DRCT’s Constituents in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments, and continue to inflict injuries for which such prisoners have no adequate remedy \nat law.  \n174.  DRCT is entitled to an injunction against the prolonged isolation of DRCT’s \nConstituents by Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law.  \nSecond Cause of Action \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983: Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; \nin-cell shackling of individuals with mental illness) \n175.  DRCT repeats and realleges each allegation set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 174 \nabove as if fully set forth herein. \n176.  This claim is brought against Defendants Quiros and Bowles in their official \ncapacity.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles acted under color of state law at all times relevant \nhereto and in connection with all events described herein.   \n177.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law, by and pursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, \nand practice, violated and continue to violate the rights of DRCT’s Constituents by depriving \n  49 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 50 of 61\n \nthem of their right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment guaranteed by the Eighth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution, as applied to the State of Connecticut through the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.   \n178.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law, by and pursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, \nand practice of in-cell shackling of DRCT’s Constituents, have subjected DRCT’s Constituents \nto dangerous and degrading mistreatment, caused them serious pain and injury, placed them at \nsubstantial risk of serious injury, acted contrary to standards of decency, and denied them the \nminimal civilized measure of life’s necessities.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, \nofficials, employees, and others acting in concert with them under color of state law by and \npursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, and practice of in-cell shackling of DRCT’s Constituents, \ncontinue to subject DRCT’s Constituents to dangerous and degrading mistreatment, cause them \nserious pain and injury, place them at substantial risk of serious physical and psychological \ninjury, deny them the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities, and act contrary to \nstandards of decency.   \n179.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law, by and pursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, \nand practice of subjecting DRCT’s Constituents to in-cell shackling (1) have unnecessarily and \nwantonly inflicted, and continue to unnecessarily and wantonly inflict, pain upon them; (2) have \nacted and continue to act with deliberate indifference to their health, safety, and serious medical \nneeds; and (3) knew and continue to know the risk to the health, safety, and serious medical \nneeds of DRCT’s Constituents but have disregarded that risk and failed to take any reasonable \nmeasures to abate that risk.   \n  50 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 51 of 61\n \n180.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law, by and pursuant to DOC’s policy, custom, \nand practice, subjected and continue to subject DRCT’s Constituents to in-cell shackling \nmaliciously and sadistically, and for punitive or retaliatory purposes.  In many instances, they \nused in-cell shackling to punish DRCT’s Constituents for behavior that predictably arises from \ntheir own actions — that is, from placing people with mental illness in prolonged isolation at \nNorthern.  \n181.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law, did not and do not instigate or continue to \nsubject DRCT’s Constituents to in-cell shackling in a good faith effort to maintain or restore \ndiscipline, to ensure the safety or security of others, or to ensure their own safety or security.  \n182.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles authorized, condoned, and failed to exercise their \nsupervisory authority to prevent, the illegal in-cell shackling of DRCT’s Constituents by their \nagents, officials, employees, and others acting in concert with them under color of state law, and \ncontinue to authorize, condone, and fail to exercise their supervisory authority to stop that illegal \npractice.  \n183.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law by the in-cell shackling of prisoners with \nmental illness, have inflicted, and continue to inflict, cruel and unusual punishment on DRCT’s \nConstituents in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied \nto the State of Connecticut through the Fourteenth Amendment and enforceable through \n42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \n  51 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 52 of 61\n \n184.  Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and all \npersons acting in concert with them under color of state law are the proximate cause of the \nongoing deprivation of constitutional rights of DRCT’s Constituents. \n185.  As a result of the actions of Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, \nofficials, employees, and others acting in concert with them under color of state law, DRCT’s \nConstituents at Northern have suffered and continue to suffer irreparable harm.  \n186.  Unless enjoined, Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, \nemployees and others acting in concert with them under color of state law, will continue the \nin-cell shackling of DRCT’s Constituents in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments, and to inflict injuries for which such prisoners have no adequate remedy at law.  \n187.  DRCT is entitled to an injunction against the in-cell shackling of DRCT’s \nConstituents by Defendants Quiros and Bowles, and their agents, officials, employees, and others \nacting in concert with them under color of state law.  \nThird Cause of Action \n(Violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132;  \nfailure to implement reasonable modifications for persons with mental illness)  \n \n188.  DRCT repeats and realleges each allegation set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 187 \nabove as if fully set forth herein. \n189.  This claim is asserted against DOC. \n190.  DOC, by the policies and practices described herein, has violated and continues to \nviolate the rights of DRCT’s Constituents secured by the ADA.  DOC has violated, and \ncontinues to violate, the rights of DRCT’s Constituents by failing to make reasonable \nmodifications to policies, practices, and procedures needed in order for these prisoners to enjoy \nmeaningful access to services, programs, and activities. \n  52 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 53 of 61\n \n191.  The ADA provides, in relevant part, that “no qualified individual with a disability \nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of \nthe services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  \n192.  The ADA has been implemented regulations promulgated by the United States \nDepartment of Justice, 28 C.F.R. § 35.101 et seq., providing, inter alia, that public entities:  \n(a) shall not “[d]eny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to participate in or \nbenefit from [an] aid, benefit, or service,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(i); and (b) “shall make \nreasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are \nnecessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the [DOC] can demonstrate \nthat making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or \nactivity,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).  \n193.  DRCT’s Constituents are qualified individuals with disabilities within the \nmeaning of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12102, 12131, and 28 C.F.R. § 35.104.  DRCT’s \nConstituents have mental impairments or illnesses that substantially limit their ability to perform \nmajor life activities, such as caring for themselves, working, concentrating, thinking, and \ncommunicating with others.  Many of DRCT’s Constituents also have records of mental \nimpairment or illness, and are regarded as having such mental impairment, or illness.   \n194.  DOC is a public entity within the meaning of and subject to Title II of the ADA.  \nSee 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1).  DOC is responsible for the operation and management of correctional \nfacilities, including Northern, and subject to the ADA Regulations at 28 C.F.R. § 35.152 et seq.  \nDOC is legally responsible for ADA violations committed by DOC staff and contractors who \n  53 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 54 of 61\n \nprovide programs, services, or activities, including, but not limited to, mental health services, to \nDOC prisoners including DRCT’s Constituents.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1). \n195.  DOC services, programs, and activities are covered by the ADA.  The services, \nprograms, and activities that DOC provides to individuals in its custody include, but are not \nlimited to, sleeping, eating, showering, toileting, communicating with those outside the prison by \nmail and telephone, exercising, entertainment, safety and security, the prison’s administrative, \ndisciplinary, and classification proceedings, medical and mental health services, the library, \neducational, vocational, substance abuse, and anger management classes, and discharge services. \n196.  DOC is, and at all times relevant hereto was, aware of the mental illness of \nDRCT’s Constituents and has failed to implement reasonable modifications to policies, practices, \nor procedures needed in order for these prisoners to enjoy meaningful access to services, \nprograms, and activities and to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability.  DOC has violated, \nand continues to violate, the rights of DRCT’s Constituents by failing to provide reasonable \nmodifications to policies, practices, or procedures in order to proscribe discrimination against \nprisoners with mental illness.   \n197.  For example, DOC fails to reasonably assess and account for mental illness or \notherwise provide reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures in connection \nwith assigning DRCT’s Constituents to Isolative Statuses where they are subject to prolonged \nisolation.   \n198.  DOC fails to reasonably assess and account for mental illness or otherwise \nprovide reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures in connection with \nsubjecting DRCT’s Constituents to in-cell shackling and BOS.   \n  54 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 55 of 61\n \n199.  DOC fails to reasonably assess and account for mental illness or otherwise \nprovide reasonable modifications to policies, practices, or procedures in connection with issuing \ndisciplinary tickets to DRCT’s Constituents, holding them from progression through \nAdministrative Segregation, or otherwise maintaining them in Administrative Segregation where \nthey are subject to prolonged, or even indefinite, isolation and in-cell shackling.   \n200.  DOC, by subjecting prisoners with mental illness to prolonged isolation and by \nthe use of frequent in-cell shackling and BOS, excludes these prisoners from participation in, \ndenies them the benefits of, and discriminates against them with respect to equal access to, and \nthe provision of, services, programs, and activities that are accessible to other prisoners.  DOC’s \nexclusion, denial, and discrimination are solely by reason of these prisoners’ mental illness. \n201.  In sum, DOC has failed to make reasonable modifications to policies, practices, or \nprocedures to ensure that prisoners with mental illness are able to enjoy meaningful access to \nservices, programs, and activities. \n202.  DOC, by virtue of the above-described discrimination and mistreatment of \nprisoners with mental illness, has violated the ADA, including its supporting regulations.  \n203.  DOC’s failure to meet its obligations to prisoners with mental illness constitutes \nan ongoing and continuous violation of the ADA and its supporting regulations and continues to \ninflict irreparable harm on these prisoners.  Unless enjoined, DOC will continue to violate the \nADA and to inflict injuries for which prisoners with mental illness have no adequate remedy at \nlaw. \n204.  The ADA authorizes injunctive relief as appropriate to remedy acts of \ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities.  42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1).  \n  55 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 56 of 61\n \n205.  DRCT is entitled to injunctive relief to prevent DOC’s continued violation of the \nADA, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in connection with bringing this \naction. \nFourth Cause of Action \n(Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a); \nfailure to provide reasonable accommodation for persons with mental illness) \n \n206.  DRCT repeats and realleges each allegation set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 205 \nabove as if fully set forth herein. \n207.  This claim is asserted against DOC. \n208.  DOC, by the policies and practices described herein, has violated and continues to \nviolate the rights of DRCT’s Constituents secured by the Section 504 and its implementing \nregulations.  DOC has violated, and continues to violate, the rights of DRCT’s Constituents by \ndenying them reasonable modification in policies, practices, and procedures needed in order for \nthem to enjoy meaningful access to services, programs, and activities. \n209.  Section 504 provides, in relevant part, that “[n]o otherwise qualified individual \nwith a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \nprogram or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n210.  Section 504 has been implemented by DOJ-issued regulations, providing, inter \nalia, that recipients of federally funded programs and activities shall not “utilize criteria or \nmethods of administration . . . that have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to \ndiscrimination on the basis of handicap,” 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4). \n211.  DRCT’s Constituents are qualified individuals with disabilities within the \nmeaning of Section 504, 29 U.S.C. § 705(20), 42 U.S.C. § 12102.  DRCT’s Constituents have \n  56 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 57 of 61\n \nsignificant mental impairments, or illnesses, that substantially limit their ability to perform major \nlife activities, such as caring for themselves, working, concentrating, thinking, and \ncommunicating with others.  Many of DRCT’s Constituents also have records of such their \nmental impairment or illness, and are regarded as having such mental impairment, or illness.   \n212.  DOC receives federal grants, contracts, and other financial assistance thereby \nsubjecting itself to the requirements of Section 504.  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  DOC is legally \nresponsible for Section 504 violations committed by DOC staff and contractors who provide \nprograms, services, or activities, including but not limited to mental health services, to DOC \nprisoners including DRCT’s Constituents.   \n213.  DOC programs and activities are covered by Section 504, 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1).  \nThese programs and activities that DOC provides to prisoners in its custody include, but are not \nlimited to, sleeping, eating, showering, toileting, communicating with those outside the prison by \nmail and telephone, exercising, entertainment, safety and security, the prison’s administrative, \ndisciplinary, and classification proceedings, medical and mental health services, the library, \neducational, vocational, substance abuse, and anger management classes, and discharge services. \n214.  DOC is, and was at all times relevant hereto, aware of the mental illness of \nprisoners with mental illness and has failed to implement reasonable modification to policies, \npractices, or procedures needed in order for these prisoners to enjoy meaningful access to \nservices, programs, and activities and to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability.  DOC has \nviolated, and continues to violate, the rights of people with mental illness by failing to make \nreasonable accommodations to policies, practices, or procedures in order to proscribe \ndiscrimination against prisoners with mental illness.  \n  57 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 58 of 61\n \n215.  For example, DOC fails to reasonably assess and account for mental illness or \notherwise make reasonable modification to policies, practices, and procedures in connection with \nassigning DRCT’s Constituents to Isolative Statuses where they are subject to prolonged \nisolation.   \n216.  DOC fails to reasonably assess and account for mental illness or otherwise make \nreasonable modification to policies, practices, and procedures in connection with subjecting \nDRCTs Constituents to in-cell shackling and BOS.    \n217.  DOC fails to reasonably assess and account for mental illness or otherwise make \nreasonable modification to policies, practices, or procedures in connection with issuing \ndisciplinary tickets to DRCT’s Constituents, holding them from progression through \nAdministrative Segregation, or otherwise maintaining them in Isolative Statuses where they are \nsubject to prolonged, or even indefinite, isolation and in-cell shackling.   \n218.  DOC, by subjecting prisoners with mental illness to prolonged isolation, and by \nthe use of frequent in-cell shackling and BOS, excludes these prisoners from participation in, \ndenies them the benefits of, and discriminates against them with respect to services, programs, \nand activities that are accessible to other prisoners.  DOC’s exclusion, denial, and discrimination \nare solely by reason of these prisoners’ mental illness. \n219.  In sum, DOC has not made any reasonable modification to policies, practices, or \nprocedures to ensure that prisoners with mental illness are able to enjoy meaningful access to \nservices, programs, and activities. \n220.  DOC, by virtue of the above-described discrimination and mistreatment of \nprisoners with mental illness, has violated Section 504, including its supporting regulations.  \n  58 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 59 of 61\n \n221.  DOC’s failure to meet its obligations to prisoners with mental illness constitutes \nan ongoing and continuous violation of Section 504 and its supporting regulations and continues \nto inflict irreparable harm on these prisoners.  Unless enjoined, DOC will continue to violate \nSection 504 and to inflict injuries for which prisoners with mental illness have no adequate \nremedy at law. \n222.  Section 504 authorizes injunctive relief as appropriate to remedy acts of \ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities.  29 U.S.C. § 794a(a)(2). \n223.  DRCT is entitled to injunctive relief to prevent DOC’s continued violation of \nSection 504, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in connection with bringing \nthis action.   \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, in order to stop the ongoing psychological and physical tormenting of its \nconstituents, DRCT respectfully requests that the Court:  \n(a)  Issue a judgment declaring that the prolonged isolation of DRCT’s \nConstituents constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; \n(b)  Permanently enjoin Defendants, their subordinates, agents, employees, \nand all other persons acting in concert with them under color of state law from subjecting \nDRCT’s Constituents to prolonged isolation either by maintaining any of DRCT’s \nConstituents in Isolative Statuses (at Northern or elsewhere) or transferring any of \nDRCT’s Constituents into Isolative Statuses (at Northern or elsewhere);  \n  59 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 60 of 61\n \n(c)  Issue a judgment declaring that the in-cell shackling of DRCT’s \nConstituents constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; \n(d)  Permanently enjoin Defendants, their subordinates, agents, employees, \nand all other persons acting in concert with them under color of state law from subjecting \nDRCT’s Constituents to in-cell shackling; \n(e)  Declare that Defendants’ conduct described herein, including, without \nlimitation, Defendants’ failure to provide reasonable modifications that would allow \nDRCT’s Constituents access to services, programs, and activities afforded to other \nprisoners, violates the ADA and Section 504;  \n(f)  Permanently enjoin Defendants, their subordinates, agents, employees, \nand all other persons acting in concert with them under color of state law from the \ncontinued violation of the ADA and Section 504 and further require that Defendants \nmake reasonable modifications that would allow DRCT’s Constituents meaningful access \nto services, programs, and activities afforded other prisoners, as required under the ADA \nand Section 504;  \n(g)  Grant Plaintiff’s reasonable attorneys’ fees, litigation expenses, and costs \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b), 42 U.S.C. § 12205, 28 C.F.R. § 35.175, 29 U.S.C. \n§ 794a(b), and other applicable law; and  \n(h)  Grant such other relief as the Court considers just and proper.  \n \n  60 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00146-KAD   Document 24   Filed 02/18/21   Page 61 of 61\n \n  Respectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Kyle Mooney \nDan Barrett (ct29816) \nElana Bildner (ct30379) \nACLU Foundation of Connecticut \n765 Asylum Avenue, 1st Floor \nHartford, CT 065105 \nPhone: (860) 471-8471 \nEmail: e-filings@acluct.org \n \nHope Metcalf (ct424312) \nAli Gali (Law Student Intern)  \nKaren Chikezie (Law Student Intern) \nLuke Connell (Law Student Intern) \nLowenstein International Human Rights \nClinic \nYale Law School \nP.O.
