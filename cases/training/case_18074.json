    "summary": "<p>This class-action litigation arose out of the April 15, 2000, mass arrest of more than 670 people protesting upcoming World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings by Washington, D.C., and federal law enforcement. The original complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on April 13, 2001, by 33 named plaintiffs, including individuals and organizations (the number of named plaintiffs shrunk to 14 by the time the court approved the settlement in the case in July 2010, and the caption name of the case changed at least twice due to plaintiffs terminating their involvement with the suit). Included in the suit were eight individual plaintiffs whose claims arose out of incidents at different locations or times from the mass arrest. </p><p>The plaintiffs sued the District of Columbia government, the Chief and Executive Assistant Chief of Operations of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) in DC, the MPD, a number of MPD officers, the United States, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and a number of federal law enforcement agencies and officers, seeking monetary and declaratory relief for violations of their First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendment rights, as well as false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, and battery. In addition, the plaintiffs also sought expungement of records of their arrests by both the District of Columbia and the federal government. The case was assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman and Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola. </p><p>The plaintiffs filed for class certification on October 30, 2001. After the parties litigated various legal disputes for nearly five years, Magistrate Facciola recommended the class certification be approved, and Judge Friedman adopted his recommendation in full, granting the class certification on October 13, 2006. The class approved consisted of \"[a]ll persons detained and arrested in Washington, D.C., on April 15, 2000, near 20 Street, N.W. and I and K Streets, N.W. in connection with the protest against the Prison Industrial Complex during the IMF/World Bank demonstrations.\"</p><p>In August 2006, Judge Friedman adopted in full another recommendation from Magistrate Judge Facciola, dismissing the plaintiffs’ demand for declaratory relief because the plaintiffs lacked standing.</p><p>In late 2009, the plaintiffs agreed to a settlement with the District of Columbia defendants, whereby the District of Columbia would pay a total of $13,302,500, divided as follows: $700,000 to the 14 class representatives ($50,000 each); $9,180,000 to settle the claims of all other eligible class members (no more than $18,000 per individual); $3,272,500 in attorneys’ fees; and $150,000 to provide for notification to eligible class members and administration of the settlement agreement and funds. The eight individual, non-class plaintiffs also received a collective total of $425,000 in the settlement. </p><p>In addition to the payments, the MPD agreed to require officers undergo additional training on First Amendment and mass demonstration policies and implement other changes to its practices for handling protests and similar First Amendment-protected events for a time period of three years. The settlement also declared the arrests of all class members null and void, and the District of Columbia agreed to expunge their arrest records and seek similar expungements from the federal government and any other states that might have the records, where applicable. </p><p>The final settlement was approved on July 15, 2010, and its terms stated the case would be dismissed with prejudice after three years. No public record of the exact date of dismissal has been found, so the case is now presumably closed.</p>",

An initial group of 33 named plaintiffs filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on April 13, 2001, against the District of Columbia, District of Columbia’s Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), the United States, and various federal law enforcement agencies. They sought monetary and declaratory relief for violations of their First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendment rights, as well as false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, and battery. They also sought expungement of the arrest records of all class members by both the District of Columbia and the federal government. The court approved a final settlement between 14 remaining named plaintiffs and the District of Columbia defendants on July 15, 2010. That agreement included a total of $13,302,500 in monetary relief; new training and policy change requirements for MPD in its handling of First Amendment and mass demonstration issues; and a number of steps D.C. would take to expunge the records of class members and seek similar expungements from the federal government and other states where applicable.

For the reasons stated herein, I\nrecommend that plaintiffs’ motion be granted as to class certification, but deferred until further\nproceedings as to the provision of notice to class members.  \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nOn April 13, 2001, the named plaintiffs filed a complaint against multiple governmental\ndefendants alleging violations of their First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendment rights to assemble and\nengage in non-violent protests against the International Monetary Fund (“IMF”) and the World\nBank, as well as common law claims of false arrest and assault and battery. See Complaint at 5. \nIn general, the named plaintiffs allege that, on April 15, 2000, near 20th Street N.W., between I\nand K Streets N.W., more than six hundred persons, including demonstrators and non-\ndemonstrators, were surrounded, penned in, and then arrested by police officers without first\nbeing given an order to disperse. Id. at ¶¶ 88-94.  The named plaintiffs allege that the arrestees\n\nCase 1:01-cv-00811-PLF   Document 240   Filed 08/22/06   Page 2 of 7\nwere then confined in harsh conditions, denied access to food and water, bathrooms, medication\nand telephones, and that they were deliberately misinformed about their right to post bond\nwithout waiving their right to contest their arrest. Id. at ¶¶ 102-03.  The named plaintiffs further\nallege that defendants purposefully made these mass false arrests and took these actions for the\npurposes of discouraging them and others from asserting their constitutionally-protected rights to\nspeech and to assemble. Id. at ¶¶ 95-96.\nOn October 30, 2001, the named plaintiffs moved this Court, pursuant to Rule 23 of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, to certify the following class: \nAll persons who were detained and arrested on April 15, 2000,\nnear the area of 20th Street, N.W. and I and K Streets, N.W. in\nconnection with the protest against the Prison Industrial Complex\nduring the IMF/World Bank demonstrations.\nPls’ Mot. at 1.  By the same motion, plaintiffs moved this Court for an order directing (1)\ndefendants to provide to plaintiffs, within thirty days of the date of class certification, the name\nand current address of each class member or all documents or records in defendants’ possession\nthat would assist plaintiffs in determining the class member’s current address, and (2) within\nthirty days from receipt of that information, plaintiffs to mail to class members the notice\ninformation required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(2)(B). Id. at 1-2.  Plaintiffs also\nrequest that the order direct class members to mail their responses to plaintiffs’ counsel and that\nplaintiffs shall file those responses with the Court and serve copies on defendants. Id. at 2.\nOn November 26, 2001, defendants District of Columbia, Charles Ramsey and Terrence\nGainer (collectively “District defendants”) filed District Defendants’ Reply to Plaintiffs’ Motion\nfor Class Certification (hereinafter “District Defs’ Reply”).  The District defendants do not\n2\n\nCase 1:01-cv-00811-PLF   Document 240   Filed 08/22/06   Page 3 of 7\noppose plaintiffs’ requested class certification, but do object to plaintiffs’ requested production\nof information regarding potential class members. See District Defs’ Reply at 1.  Also on\nNovember 26, 2001, the remaining defendants1 (collectively “Federal defendants”) filed Federal\nDefendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification (hereinafter “Defs’ Opp’n”). \nThe Federal defendants oppose both plaintiffs’ requested certification and their proposed notice\nprocedures. See Defs’ Opp’n at 5, 14.\nDISCUSSION\nA. The Motion for Class Certification Should be Granted as Unopposed\nPlaintiffs argue that their proposed class satisfies the requirements of Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(3).  With respect to the four requirements set forth in 23(a),\nplaintiffs first argue that the class is so numerous that joinder is impracticable because the\nproposed class is composed of approximately six hundred to seven hundred persons. Pls’ Mot. at\n1.  Second, plaintiffs argue that there are common questions of law and fact, including (a)\nwhether defendants violated the class members’ First and Fourth Amendment rights and their\ncommon law rights against false arrest and false imprisonment by detaining and arresting\npeaceful demonstrators and observers without lawful justification; (b) whether defendants\nsubjected the arrestees to harsh conditions of confinement; and (c) whether defendants\ndeliberately misinformed arrestees of their rights to post collateral and appear at a hearing to\n1 Plaintiffs have also sued the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation, the Secret Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Bureau of\nAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the National Park Police, the National Park Service, the United\nStates Capitol Police, and unknown federal agents in their individual capacity.  Note that some of\nthese defendants (the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms,\nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Park Police) have since been\ndismissed. See Mar. 15, 2006 Stipulation of Dismissal.  \n3\n\nCase 1:01-cv-00811-PLF   Document 240   Filed 08/22/06   Page 4 of 7\ncontest the arrest. Id. at 1-2.  Because the proposed class was “detained on the street at the same\nlocation as a group in one singular police action . . . [and was] arrested and taken into custody in\nthe same singular police action at the same time and as a group, and [was] confined in common\nor similar harsh conditions,” there are common questions of law and fact among the class. Id. at\n2.  Third, plaintiffs argue that the claims of the class representatives are typical of the class. Id. \nSpecifically, the named plaintiffs include representatives typical of the entirety of the class,\nincluding demonstrators, legal observers, bystanders, journalists, and union officials. See\nComplaint at ¶¶ 6-27.  Fourth, plaintiffs argue that the class representatives and their legal\ncounsel will fairly and adequately protect the interest of the class and that there is no evidence of\nany material conflicts of interest between the representatives and any member of the class. Pls’\nMot. at 2.\nThe Federal defendants oppose class certification on all points.  In essence, the Federal\ndefendants insist that the inherent, individualized nature of plaintiffs’ claims, e.g. whether there\nwas probable cause to arrest each individual and what injuries that individual suffered as a result,\nprecludes the proposed class’s ability to meet the requirements of commonality, typicality, or\npredominance. See Defs’ Opp’n at 5-6. \nEvents in this lawsuit have overtaken the Federal defendants’ opposition.  Also referred\nto me for report and recommendation was the Federal Defendants’ Motion for Summary\nJudgment [#202].  Pursuant to that referral, I recently recommended to Judge Friedman that he\n(1) dismiss the complaint against the Federal defendants as non-justiciable, insofar as plaintiffs\nare seeking declaratory relief, and (2) hold in abeyance ruling on the validity of plaintiffs’ claim\nthat the Federal defendants be forced to expunge arrest and other records pertaining to the\n4\n\nCase 1:01-cv-00811-PLF   Document 240   Filed 08/22/06   Page 5 of 7\ndemonstrators until after there has been a judicial determination as to whether their arrests were\nillegal. Alliance for Global Justice v. District of Columbia, No. 01-811, 2006 WL 2303105\n(D.D.C. Aug. 9, 2006).  If Judge Friedman adopts my recommendation, then the Federal\ndefendants will no longer be parties in the liability phase of the case and, therefore, will lack\nstanding to object to class certification for that phase of the case.  Given that the District\ndefendants have not opposed class certification and the Federal defendants may lack standing to\nobject to class certification for the liability phase of the case, if Judge Friedman adopts my\nrecommendation, then plaintiffs’ motion will be rendered unopposed.  Accordingly, I recommend\nthat plaintiffs’ motion for class certification be granted as unopposed.  \nI appreciate that the Federal defendants will remain parties to this lawsuit and would have\nstrenuous objections to any order that would require the expungement of any records, generated\nby the arrest of the demonstrators and still maintained by the Federal defendants, pertaining to\nthe demonstrators. See Federal Defendants’ Reply to Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Their Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 17-19 (insisting that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is required by\nstatute to maintain records, that United States Secret Service has no records, that United States\nCapitiol Police has only records given to it by the District of Columbia and, in any event,\nplaintiffs cannot show any entitlement to expungement).  Obviously, all of those objections\nwould be preserved and need only be considered if plaintiffs first establish that they were\nillegally arrested.  If plaintiffs’ claims fail, the issues raised by the Federal defendants regarding\nthose claims will not need not be addressed. \nMoreover, the developments in this case are dynamic and, as the defendants concede, the\nCourt may modify the composition of the class being certified as the case proceeds.  The Federal\n5\n\nCase 1:01-cv-00811-PLF   Document 240   Filed 08/22/06   Page 6 of 7\ndefendants, therefore, retain their right to argue that, however the class was defined for purposes\nof liability, it should be otherwise defined when the question of expungement of arrest and other\nrecords actually arises.  Until then, there is, in my view, no reason to consider that question\nbefore liability has even been established. \nB. Notice Requirements\nThe parties differ as to how notice should be provided to class members.  Plaintiffs\nsuggest that (1) defendants provide to plaintiffs, within thirty days of the date of class\ncertification, the name and current address of each class member or all documents or records in\ndefendants’ possession that would assist plaintiffs in determining each class member’s current\naddress, and (2) within thirty days from receipt of that information, plaintiffs will mail the class\nmembers the notice information required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(2)(B) at their\nown expense. Pls’ Mot. at 1-2.  Plaintiffs contemplate that class members will then mail their\nresponses to plaintiffs’ counsel, who will in turn file those responses with the Court and serve\ncopies on the defendants. Id. at 2. \nThe District defendants reject this proposal insofar as it requires the District to provide\nanything and insists that “public documents created relating to the complained-of arrests (MPD\narrest book printouts) suffice to provide the information necessary to accomplish notification of\npotential class members.” District Defs’ Reply at 2.  \nIn my view, the best practical solution is to have the parties confer and file jointly a\npraecipe indicating the following: (1) to what extent discovery (formal or informal) has given the\nplaintiffs copies of the arrest records of the potential class members and to what extent those\nrecords disclose the (a) name, (b) address, (c) phone number, (d) Social Security number, and (e)\n6\n\nCase 1:01-cv-00811-PLF   Document 240   Filed 08/22/06   Page 7 of 7\ndate of birth of the class members; (2) whether discovery has indicated that there are other\nrecords in the possession of the District, in addition to the arrest records, that would aid in\nlocating potential class members; and (3) if there are such records and the District has not\nproduced them, the District shall show cause in the praecipe why the District should not be\nordered to produce them.  If the District believes that there are no other records, other than arrest\nrecords, it shall so state in the praecipe.  After such praecipe has been filed, Judge Friedman can\nassemble the parties to be heard on how and to whom notice should be provided.  \nCONCLUSION\nFor the forgoing reasons, I recommend that the Court certify the following class for the\nliability phase of this case:\nAll persons who were detained and arrested on April 15, 2000,\nnear the area of 20th Street, N.W. and I and K Streets, N.W. in\nconnection with the protest against the Prison Industrial Complex\nduring the IMF/World Bank demonstrations.\nPls’ Mot. at 1.  I also recommend that the plaintiffs and District defendants be required to file,\nwithin ten days from an order adopting this recommendation, the praecipe just described\nregarding the provision of notice to class members.  I further recommend that, at that point,\nJudge Friedman assemble the parties to determine how and to whom notice should be provided.  \nFailure to file timely objections to the findings and recommendations set forth in\nthis report may waive your right of appeal from an order of the District Court adopting\nsuch findings and recommendations. See Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140 (1985).\n_____________________________\nJOHN M. FACCIOLA\nDated:  UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE\n7",

The Class Administrator or its designee shall be the determinator of the class \neligibility of Claimants, consistent with the class definition approved by the Court \nin the advance and settlement of this action. \nb.  A Claimant shall be deemed eligible ifhis or her identity is reflected in a \ngovernment or law enforcement or court record(s) as having been arrested in \nconnection with the underlying class arrest. \n(i)  A government or law enforcement record is any record created or issued or \nmaintained by a law enforcement agency, a government agency or court. \n(ii) The record need not have been maintained in the exclusive custody of \ngovernment, and can be constituted by a law enforcement or govemment or \ncourt receipt or record issued to the claimant in relation to the arrest or \nrelease. \n(iii)The record/fonn/item need not be strictly denominated as an \"arrest record\" in \norder to establish class qualification. For example, any of the following \n19 \n-/i.~ \ninitials, on behalf of District Defendants \non behalf of plaintiffs Jl-!:.I/~v--...:. \n\nCase 1:01-cv-00811-PLF   Document 358-5   Filed 06/24/10   Page 20 of 25\nrecords would be acceptable if they evidence identity and class membership: \nbus/van transport log; record ofj udicial release or processing; a property \nreceipt or bag; citation release or post-and-forfeit form or record, etc. \n(iv) If circumstances arise where an individual is identified as being arrested on \nthe relevant day, but records are ambiguous or contradictory as to the location \nor circumstances of arrest as being consistent with the qualifying mass arrest, \nthe Class Administrator is to provide Class Counsel and Defense Counsel the \nidentity and any o:ther pertinent information pertaining to the claimant and \nrequest in writing that counsels, upon independent review of their and law \nenforcement records, advise whether they possess any information related to \nthe claimant's class membership. \nc.  The Class Administrator may develop processes or standards to qualify persons \nwho are believed or determined by the Class Administrator to have, in fact, been \nsubject to the underlying mass arrest but whose arrest is not properly or \ncompletely documented in law enforcement records, subject to and within the \nfollowing guidelines: \n(i)  Where a Claimant attests to class membership, but the fact of his or her arrest \nis not documented in law enforcement records, the Class Administrator shall \nprovide to Class Counsel and Defense Counsel the identity and any other \npertinent information pertaining to the claimant and request in wrding that \ncounsels, upon independent review of their and law enforcement records, \nadvise whether they possess any information related to the claimant's class \nmembership. \n20 \nf~ \ninitials, on behalf of District Defendants \non behalf of plaintiffs [~' -\n\nCase 1:01-cv-00811-PLF   Document 358-5   Filed 06/24/10   Page 21 of 25\n(ii) Class qualification may be established where such individual caIll provide to \nthe Class Administrator's satisfaction that he or she was, in fact, subject to the \nunderlying class arrest through presentation of information andlor evidence. \nSuch information or evidence is not intended to be strictly limited to any \nparticular form or format, and may for example include photographic \nevidence of the claimant under arrest, but must be deemed sufficiently reliable \nand relevant for the Class Administrator to make a determination, which shall \nrest in the Class Administrator or designee'~ sole judgment. \n(iii)In such circumstances, in addition to whatever other presentation he or she \nmay make to the satisfaction of the Class Administrator, such Claimant shall \nbe required to secure and submit sworn and notarized affidavits from two \nqualified Class Members attesting that each possesses personal knowledge, \nsubject to penalty, ofpeIjury, that claimant was subject to the underlying mass \narrest. For the purposes ofthis subsection, each of the two qualified Class \nMembers shall be required to have been qualified based on their arrest being \ndocumented and manifest in law enforcement, government or court I'e4x>rds. \nd.  The Class Administrator, working in conjunction with Class Counse1, may \ndevelop and implement additional criteria or standards for determining the \neligibility of persons who were juveniles at the time of arrest. \ne.

The \nClass Administrator is authorized to take whatever steps are necessary to \nundertake such efforts itself or through a third-party contractor. If a third-party \ninformation t~hnologies contractor or firm is utilized, that contractor or finn will \nbe required to agree in writing to maintaining all information in confidence and to \nreturn/destroy such data upon task completion. \n13. Return of Documents: Plaintiffs shall return to the District of Columbia all d.ocuments \nand any copies thereof produced by the District of Columbia that are subject to a \nprotective order, within 30 days of the termination of the case and the expira.tion of the \nperiod for any appeals or obj~ctions. \n14.

Plaintiffs, in response, deny that they seek any form of monetary damages.  Indeed,\nthey make clear that the relief they seek is narrow.  \nFirst, plaintiffs’ case is predicated on the asserted involvement of the FBI in a fire\ninspection by the District of Columbia of a “Convergence Center” where they and their fellow\nprotestors assembled before they engaged in a demonstration in the District of Columbia during\nthe spring meeting of the World Bank in 2000.  They ask only that the court find that the FBI\ncaused the District of Columbia to conduct the inspection as a pretext and declare that the FBI’s\nconduct violated their constitutional rights.\n\nCase 1:01-cv-00811-PLF   Document 238   Filed 08/09/06   Page 2 of 7\nSecond, the plaintiffs were arrested by the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police\nDepartment and demand that the federal agencies who remain in the case be ordered to expunge\nany arrest records that they may have of plaintiffs’ arrests and what plaintiffs call “derivative\nrecords, including intelligence records . . . .” Opposition to Federal Defendants’ Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 22.1\nFor the reasons stated in this Report and Recommendation, I first recommend that the\ndefendants’ motion for summary judgment be denied without prejudice and that the Court\nconclude that plaintiffs’ demand for declaratory relief does not present a case or controversy\nwithin this Court’s jurisdiction and, therefore, should be dismissed.  I then recommend that\nplaintiffs’ demand for the expungement of arrest and “derivative records” await the resolution of\nwhether the arrests in this case were illegal.  In my view, plaintiffs’ securing a determination that\ntheir arrests were illegal is a prerequisite to the proceeding of their equitable relief claim against\nthe federal defendants.\nANALYSIS\nIf plaintiffs’ allegations are credited, they will have established that they and many others\nassembled in the District of Columbia to demonstrate at the World Bank’s spring meeting in\n2000.  They met at a building called the “Convergence Center.”  According to plaintiffs, the FBI\nJoint Terrorism Task Force placed this building under 24-hour surveillance to secure a warrant to\nsearch it and, “ultimately, to disrupt protestors’ activities therein.” Opp’n at 8.  Plaintiffs then\nallege that the FBI, unable to establish probable cause to get a warrant, circumvented it by having\nFBI agent Chris Coombs ask the District of Columbia Fire Department to inspect the\n1 Hereinafter “Opp’n.”\n2\n\nCase 1:01-cv-00811-PLF   Document 238   Filed 08/09/06   Page 3 of 7\nConvergence Center for fire code violations. Id. at 9.  On the morning of the first day of the\nplanned demonstration, the Fire Department did so, and, having found violations, closed the\nConvergence Center, leaving the arriving demonstrators with no central place to meet. Id.2 \nPlaintiffs then point to indications that the FBI is using what occurred at the Convergence\nCenter as a model in internal documents and in presentations to state and local law enforcement\nagencies. Id. at 19-20.  They insist the “chilling effect caused by widespread knowledge” of how\nthe District of Columbia Fire Department closed the Convergence Center can only be eliminated\nby their securing a declaration that what the FBI did in the District of Columbia was\nunconstitutional. Id. at 21. \nDeclaratory Judgment\nThe court is obliged to determine, sua sponte, whether it has jurisdiction. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12(h)(3).  The statute granting the United States District Courts’ the power to issue declaratory\njudgments did not expand their jurisdiction, which is still limited to resolving only actual cases\nand controversies. Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 671 (1950).  As the\ncourt of appeals has explained:\nAs an “irreducible constitutional minimum,” a plaintiff seeking\nto demonstrate standing “must have suffered an ‘injury in fact’-\nan invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete\nand particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or\nhypothetical.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560,\n112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted). Moreover, that injury must be\n“fairly traceable” to the defendant's conduct and likely to be\n“redressed by a favorable decision.” Id. at 560-61, 112 S.Ct.\n2 Plaintiffs also that allege that, during the inspection that lead to the closing of the\nConvergence Center, materials that they intended to use to create signs and other tactile\nindications of their protest were taken, ruined or destroyed. Opp’n at 9 n. 4. \n3\n\nCase 1:01-cv-00811-PLF   Document 238   Filed 08/09/06   Page 4 of 7\n2130 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\nWorth v. Jackson, 451 F.3d 854, 858 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  To that end, the Supreme Court has\nheld that the federal courts may not entertain an attack upon the constitutionality of a law\nenforcement practice unless there is an immediate threat that the practice will be applied to the\nplaintiff. Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983); Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362 (1976);\nO’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S, 488 (1974).  The Supreme Court has said of the three cases just\ncited:\nIn all three cases, plaintiff sought injunctive relief3 directed at\ncertain systemwide law enforcement practices.  The Court held\nin each case that, absent an allegation of a specific threat of\nbeing subject to the challenged practices, plaintiff have no\nstanding to ask for an injunction.\nAllen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 760 (1984).  This requirement that a plaintiff allege a specific\nthreat is not met when the plaintiff can only show that the practice will be applied to her if a\nseries of contingent events occur some time in the future. Lyons, 461 U.S. at 106 (describing\ncontingencies and condemning them as insufficient); Rizzo, 423 U.S. at 372 (same); O’Shea, 414\nU.S. at 496-97 (same). \nIn the present case, the plaintiffs would have to concede that all of the following events\nwould have to occur before they could establish that they are threatened with a actual and\nimminent injury:\n3 As noted, no permissible distinction can be drawn between standing to seek an\ninjunction and standing to seek a declaratory judgment. See, e.g., Houston v. HUD, 24 F.3d\n1421, 1429 n.6 (1994) (plaintiffs seeking declaratory relief to prevent future illegal acts must\nshow, under Lyons, that risk of injury is actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical).\n4\n\nCase 1:01-cv-00811-PLF   Document 238   Filed 08/09/06   Page 5 of 7\n1. They intend to demonstrate in the future.\n2. They will assemble in a building that is subject to inspection by a fire department.\n3. As a result of the inspection, that fire department will be induced by the FBI to\nconduct a fire inspection or will have learned from the FBI how to use such\ninspections to disrupt demonstrations.\n4. As a result of the inspection, the fire department will find sufficient fire code\nviolations to require that the building to be used be closed.\n5. The closing of that building will make it effectively impossible to meet and\nassemble any where else, such as in a building that does not have fire code\nviolations.\n6. The closing of the building and the absence of any alternative will, in itself, make\nit effectively impossible for plaintiffs to exercise their constitutional rights.\nThis case, therefore, falls precisely within the Supreme Court’s prohibition on\nentertaining hypothetical attacks on law enforcement practices.\nIronically, a case on which plaintiffs rely supports this same conclusion.  Specifically,\nthey cite a case from the United States District Court for the Central District of California, D2K\nConvention Planning Coalition v. Chief Bernard Parks, C.A. No. 00-8556 DDP (C.D. Cal. Aug.\n11, 2000), in which the court allowed a challenge to a similar use of fire department inspections\nto thwart demonstrations at an upcoming Democratic National Convention.  There will be time\nenough to determine the constitutionality of a fire inspection when plaintiffs return to the\nDistrict of Columbia and are credibly and immediately threatened with the a similar use of a\n5\n\nCase 1:01-cv-00811-PLF   Document 238   Filed 08/09/06   Page 6 of 7\nDistrict Columbia Fire Department inspection.  Until then, the harm they claim is so theoretical,\nabstract, and contingent that it does not present a case or controversy.4 \nArrest Records\nI conclude that plaintiffs’ demand for the expungment of arrest and other records should\nbe stayed until they first establish that their arrests were illegal.\nObviously, the court’s power to order such expungement is derivative of its first finding\nthat the underlying arrests were illegal.  No one is seriously suggesting that a person can claim\nthat it is illegal or unconstitutional for a government agency to maintain accurate records of a\nperson’s legitimate arrest.  Thus, there is no reason to ascertain whether the government may\nmaintain the records of plaintiffs’ arrests until there is first a determination that their arrests\nwere illegal.  I, therefore, recommend that all action on this claim be stayed pending the result of\nthe plaintiffs’ action against the District of Columbia. \nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, I recommend the following:\n1. Defendants’ motion for summary judgment be denied without prejudice;\n2. The Court conclude that plaintiffs’ demand for declaratory relief does not present\na case or controversy within this Court’s jurisdiction and, therefore, should be\ndismissed; and\n3. Consideration and resolution of plaintiffs’ demand for the expungement of arrest\n4 Plaintiffs note the use of similar techniques at the Republican National Convention, see\nOpp’n at 19-20, but that occurred several years ago.\n6\n\nCase 1:01-cv-00811-PLF   Document 238   Filed 08/09/06   Page 7 of 7\nand “derivative records” be stayed until after the resolution of whether the arrests\nin this case were illegal.\nFailure to file timely objections to the findings and recommendations set forth in\nthis report may waive your right of appeal from an order of the District Court adopting\nsuch findings and recommendations. See Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140 (1985).\n_________________________________\nJOHN M. FACCIOLA\nUNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE\nDated: August 9, 2006\n7",
