With the 30-day clock having started, the parties immediately started discussing dates for resuming Deputy Commissioner Cohen's deposition. Because of prior commitments of counsel in MacNamara, however, the first available date turns out to be December 17. I therefore request that you modify your order to allow the policy depositions to resume by December 17, 2010. I also request that you extend the completion date to 60 days after that date, as the current cut-off of early January is simply unrealistic, given the upcoming holidays and that other high-level witnesses will need to be deposed whom we cannot even settle upon until we have deposed Deputy Commissioner Cohen.

Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT each side shall submit reply briefs totaling no more than seventy-five (75) pages. For the sake of clarification, this means that all Plaintiffs, collectively, shall submit no more than 75 pages of briefing in total. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT, to the extent that the parties file exhibits not previously submitted to support facts in their Rule 56.1 Statements that an opposing party has disputed, the limits on the number and length of exhibits do not apply. However, the parties are directed to limit such exhibits to provide only the relevant and necessary portions. (Signed by Judge Richard J.

ENDORSEMENT: The City's application to submit a declaration from David Cohen in connection with its Rule 72(a) appeal is denied. Rule 72(a) does not permit an appealing party to supplement the record, and clearly any declaration from Mr. Cohn would in fact be a supplement to the record. However, the City is not barred from seeking a remand of Judge Francis's decision to permit Judge Francis to consider any new Cohen declaration that is offered to address the specific redactions ordered by Judge Francis. Of course, as Mr. Dunn notes, the City may have to explain why it did not offer such a declaration before appealing Judge Francis's order. Because the Court will not consider, at this time, any new Cohen declaration, there is no need to address whether it should be viewed exparte. (Signed by Judge Kenneth M. Karas on 8/29/07) (cd).

Francis on 5/18/07, 8/6/07, and 8/13/08, respectively. The Court is also in receipt of Defendants' letter in response to Plaintiffs' 10/29/08 letter, as well as Plaintiffs' 10/29/08 response to Defendants' 10/29/08 letter. Because Plaintiffs' initial 10/28/08 letter chiefly responds to arguments made by Defendants in their reply papers submitted in connection with Defendants' pending Rule 72 appeal, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' letter is an unauthorized sur-reply that violates Rule 2(B) of this Court's Individual Practices. See Rule 2(B) (\"Sur-reply memoranda will not be accepted without prior permission of the Court.\") Accordingly, since Plaintiffs did not seek or receive permission to submit the 10/29/08 sur-reply, the Court will no consider the arguments contained in Plaintiffs' letter. However, to the extent that Plaintiffs wish to contest the arguments set forth in Defendants' Reply Brief, they may do so at oral argument on the Rule 72 appeal, which the Court will schedule for a mutually convenient date and time to be determined.

(With respect to the deadline set, I respectfully request that the Court accept this tardy notification-I was out of my office for the past week.) Plaintiffs read this Court's July S, 2011, Order, however, to require the production by August 1, 2011, of disclosures under F.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(C), i.e., a \"summary of the facts and opinions to which the witness is expected to testify.\" ENDORSEMENT: Mr. Kahl will not be excluded from testifying based on the minimal delay in responding to my July 5, 2010 order, since the defendants have already deposed him and have suffered no prejudice. However, prior to the August 1, 2011 deadline for submission of expert material, plaintiffs should reconsider whether they wish to proffer him as an expert, since it appears unlikely that he will pass muster under Daubert.

    "summary": "<p>On October 7, 2004, three private citizens filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs sued the city of New York and the commissioner of the New York City Police department under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. Represented by the New York Civil Liberties Union, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as compensatory damages. The case was assigned to Judge Deborah A. Batts.</p>\r\n<p>According to the complaint, the plaintiffs had been peacefully protesting at the Republican National Convention when they were falsely arrested and subsequently had their fingerprints improperly entered into government databases. The plaintiffs argued that their First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated when they were arrested as a result of mass-arrest tactics, when the defendants had detained them after arresting them for minor offenses, and when their fingerprints were improperly entered into government databases. They claimed that it also violated New York state law.</p>\r\n<p>On February 1, 2005, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss.</p>\r\n<p>On February 18, 2005, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that only added a stipulation that they had filed notices of claim on November 23, 2004. On September 25, 2004, the case was reassigned to Judge Kenneth M. Karas; on October 14, 2005 the case was referred to Magistrate Judge James C. Francis.</p>\r\n<p>On October 17, 2005, the case was consolidated with Schiller v. City of New York (04-7922) for discovery purposes only.</p>\r\n<p>On November 13, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint that added an inspector of the New York City Police Department as a defendant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 2, 2007, the case was reassigned to Judge Richard J. Sullivan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 10, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. The complaint included additional facts that stipulated that the plaintiffs upon being arrested were denied summons as a result of a policy adopted by the defendants for the Republican National Convention.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 3, 2011, the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On the same day, the defendants also filed a motion for summary judgment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 30, 2012, the court ruled on the motions for summary judgment. There were four different requests that the court ruled on.</p>\r\n<p>First, the court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for summary judgment with respect to the Fulton Street arrests and denied the defendants&rsquo; motion. The court addressed the mass arrests based on where they took place, thus arrests that took place on Fulton Street were addressed separately from those that occurred on East 16th Street. With respect to the Fulton Street protests, the police lacked probable cause to arrest the plaintiffs based on video evidence that the court reviewed. The court also denied the parties&rsquo; cross-motions with respect to the East 16th Street arrests. With regard to the East 16th Street protests, there were still questions of fact that needed to be answered and for this reason denied summary judgment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Third, the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion regarding the state law fingerprinting claims was granted, and the defendants&rsquo; motion was denied. With respect to the plaintiffs&rsquo; state law fingerprinting claim, the question at hand was whether the defendants had reasonable grounds to suspect that the plaintiffs&rsquo; means of identification were inaccurate. The record reflected that they did not. Therefore, the court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for summary judgment on the issue.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, the defendants had argued that the plaintiffs&rsquo; First and Fourth Amendment claims should fail because there was no constitutional right to a summons and that it was not unconstitutional to fingerprint an individual's incident to arrest. The court agreed with the defendants, granting the motion in their favor. 2012 WL 4513352.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 5, 2012, the defendants appealed the court&rsquo;s order. On January 14, 2014, the parties filed a stipulation withdrawing the appeal.</p>\r\n<p>On March 13, 2014, the court was informed that the parties had come to an agreement over a monetary settlement. The plaintiffs were paid $65,000 with $45,000 allocated to the named plaintiff and the other two plaintiffs receiving $10,000 each. The plaintiffs were also awarded $549,995 in attorneys&rsquo; fees.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;On April 8, 2014, the case was dismissed. This case is closed.&nbsp;</p>",

In October of 2011, the parties filed motions for summary judgment. In September of 2012 the court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs with respect to the Fulton Street Arrests and their state law fingerprinting claims. The court granted the defendantsโ motion regarding the constitutionality of the cityโs fingerprinting and arrest policy during the RNC.  In 2014, the parties settled for a total of $549,995 and the case was dismissed.",

This is an action to vindicate the civil rights of bystanders near the area of \ndemonstrations, non-participating observers of demonstrations, and individuals wishing \nto participate lawfully in demonstrations in New York City.  During the recent \nRepublican National Convention, the New York Police Department deployed mass-arrest \npolicies and practices at demonstrations that resulted in the unlawful arrests of \nbystanders, non-participating observers, and law-abiding demonstrators.  The Department \nthen detained those arrested for minor offenses for excessive periods of time and \nunlawfully fingerprinted them.  In this action the plaintiffs seek to have these actions \ndeclared unlawful so that they are not deployed at future demonstrations. \n2.  The Republican National Convention prompted hundreds of thousands of people \nto participate in lawful demonstrations in New York City between August 26, 2004, and \nSeptember 2, 2004.   However, during that period the NYPD arrested over 1,800 people, \n   1 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 2 of 23\nthe vast majority of whom were charged with only minor offenses.  On Tuesday, August \n31 alone, the NYPD arrested more than 1,100 people, many of whom were not engaging \nin any unlawful behavior. \n3.  Shortly before 7:00 p.m. on August 31, 2004, a group of demonstrators carrying \nsigns and playing drums and other instruments left its gathering place at the southern end \nof Union Square Park and proceeded north on Union Square East.  They were followed \nby curious observers.  After the police prevented the demonstrators and observers from \nproceeding north on Union Square East, the group moved east on 16th Street.  Using \nmesh nets and large numbers of officers, the police then sealed off both ends of the block \n(at Union Square East and at Irving Place) and refused to allow anyone inside to leave.  \nMany of those trapped between the police lines had been walking lawfully on the \nsidewalk, and some had not even been following the demonstrators but were simply \ncaught in the crowd when the police sealed the entire block.  Without giving any \nopportunity for people to disperse, the police began systematically arresting people on the \nblock, throwing some people to the ground.  Those arrested were handcuffed and placed \non buses, and many were taken to and held at a filthy bus depot.  Even though those \narrested on 16th Street were charged with only minor offenses, they were fingerprinted \nand remained in police custody for long periods of time, some for over two days. \n4.  As a result of NYPD policies and procedures, the plaintiffsโa bystander, a non-\nparticipating observer, and a lawful demonstrator, each lawfully standing on the \nsidewalkโwere falsely arrested, detained, and fingerprinted.  Plaintiff Hacer Dinler, a \npersonal fitness and dance instructor who had no connection to the demonstration and \n   2 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 3 of 23\nsimply happened to be walking on the block, was confined by police as she walked down \nthe 16th Street sidewalk on her way to teach a dance class.  After about two hours in \nconfinement, during which time the NYPD ignored her repeated calls for help, Ms. \nDinler fainted and experienced convulsions.  She was eventually transported by \nambulance to St. Vincentโs Hospital, where she underwent testing and treatment until the \nfollowing morning.  Plaintiffs Ann Maurer and Ashley Waters were also victims of the \nNYPDโs practice of indiscriminate confinement.  Ms. Maurer, a participant in the \ndemonstration, and Ms. Waters, a non-participating observer, were each lawfully \nstanding on the sidewalk on 16th Street when police sealed the entire block.   Over the \ncourse of the next twenty hours or so, Ms. Maurer and Ms. Waters were unlawfully \nhandcuffed, searched, and fingerprinted before being released.   \n5.  The NYPDโs policies and practices during the Republican National Convention of \narresting lawful demonstrators, non-participating observers and bystanders en masse, of \ndetaining those arrested for long periods of time in unhealthy conditions, and of routinely \nfingerprinting those arrested for only minor offenses violated the First, Fourth, and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution as well as provisions of the \nNew York State Constitution, statutes, and common law.  The plaintiffs seek a \ndeclaration that these policies and practices were unlawful, a declaration that their arrests, \ndetentions, and fingerprinting were unlawful, and an injunction requiring the return or \ndestruction of their fingerprints and any other records of the unlawful arrests.  Plaintiffs \nalso seek compensatory damages and attorneys fees.   \n \n   3 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 4 of 23\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This court has subject-matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffsโ claims pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1343(3-4). \n7.  Plaintiffs further invoke this Courtโs supplemental jurisdiction, pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(a), over any and all state constitutional and state law claims that are so \nrelated to the claims within the original jurisdiction of this court that they form part of the \nsame case or controversy. \n8.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b) in that plaintiffsโ claims arise in \nthe Southern District of New York. \n9.  Jurisdiction to grant declaratory judgment is conferred by U.S.C. ยงยง 2201, 2202. \nInjunctive relief is authorized by Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. An \naward of costs and attorneys fees is authorized pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988. \nPARTIES \n10.  Plaintiff HACER DINLER is a resident of Brooklyn, New York.  \n11.  Plaintiff ANN MAURER is a resident of Astoria, Queens in New York City. \n12.  Plaintiff ASHLEY WATERS is a resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts. \n   4 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 5 of 23\n13.  Defendant CITY OF NEW YORK is a municipal corporation within the State of \nNew York. \n14.  Defendant RAYMOND KELLY is the Commissioner of the New York City \nPolice Department.  He is sued in his official capacity for injunctive relief. \nFACTS \n15.  The Republican National Convention was held in New York City between August \n30, 2004, and September 2, 2004.   In response, numerous organizations and individuals \nplanned and conducted protest activitiesโincluding the single largest demonstration \nbelieved to have taken place at a political convention in the United States.  Despite \nrepeated statements by NYPD officials, including Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, \nabout the threat posed to New York City by โhard-coreโ and โdangerousโ protesters, the \ndemonstrations proved to be overwhelmingly peaceful.  New York City Mayor Michael \nBloomberg professed to welcome convention participants and peaceful protestors alike, \npledging that the cityโs security plan would โprotect[] the rights of convention-goers and \nprotestors without unnecessarily getting in the way of New Yorkers as we go about our \ndaily lives.โ \n16.  At Convention-related demonstrations there were nearly 1,800 arrests, many of \nthem mass arrests of people lawfully on public sidewalks or streets, with law-abiding \ndemonstrators and innocent bystanders alike being swept up.  On Friday, August 27, \npolice officers used orange nets to trap and arrest scores of people participating in a \nbicycle protest that the NYPD had allowed to take place for nearly one and one-half \n   5 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 6 of 23\nhours before making mass arrests without warning.  Two days laterโon Sunday, August \n29โthe NYPD used nets again to arrest groups of people lawfully standing on sidewalks \nin Times Square, including legal observers and members of the press.  The use of this \ntype of indiscriminate arrest tactic is wholly unreasonable, as it is virtually certain to \nresult in the arrest of people engaged in lawful activity. \n17.  The bulk of the arrests during the Convention took place on Tuesday, August 31, \nthe second day of the Convention.  One of the demonstrations taking place that day was \nthe A31 Street Party, which was described by organizers as a mobile event to assert โthe \nidea that the streets of Manhattan are public domain.โ  Around 6:00 p.m. the Street Party \nbegan to assemble at the southern end of Union Square Park.  The event included two \nmarching bands, consisting of various drums and unamplified horns.  One band wore \norange and grey uniforms while other participants were dressed in costume or carried \nlarge cardboard cutouts of characters from the Wizard of Oz, creating a carnival-like \natmosphere.   \n18.  Between 6:45 p.m. and 7:00 p.m, participants in the Street Party began to move \nout of Union Square, proceeding north on Union Square East.  The group was prevented \nfrom continuing north by a line of NYPD officers that stretched across Union Square \nEast, so the group started east on 16th Street. \n19.  After the group of demonstrators and observers entered the block of 16th Street \nbetween Union Square East and Irving Place, a line of police closed off the Irving Place \n   6 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 7 of 23\nend of the block using orange plastic netting.  Roughly simultaneously, a second line of \npolice with orange netting blocked off the Union Square East end of the block, trapping \nwell over one hundred people, many of whom were simply observing the demonstration \nfrom the sidewalks or even just passing by. \n20.  Without any audible order to disperse, the two lines of police then proceeded to \nmove toward each other, compressing the demonstrators, observers, and passers-by into \none large crowd.  After a few moments, the police split the crowd into separate groups \nand forced each group onto either the north or south sidewalk of the block.  Police \nofficers were unresponsive to questions about the reason for the detention.   \n21.  Shortly after forcing the groups onto the sidewalks, police began roughly to \nremove individuals from the crowd and to throw them to the ground before arresting \nthem.  They appeared to be targeting protestors wearing masks or costumes, as well as \nthe musicians, many of whose instruments were thrown to the ground and damaged.   \n22.  Following this series of targeted arrests, the police continued to surround the \ngroups on the sidewalk and refused to release them.  At approximately 7:15 p.m. police \nannounced that everyone would be arrested and began systematically to arrest the \nremaining individuals.  Each arrestee was placed in plastic flexcuffs and led onto a \nwaiting city bus on Irving Place.  \n23.  The arrestees were transported by city bus to Pier 57, a block-long, three-story \nformer bus depot on the Hudson River at 11th Avenue and 15th Street used by the City to \n   7 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 8 of 23\nhold demonstrators arrested during the Convention.  Some arrestees were taken into Pier \n57, where they remained for long periods of time in unhealthy conditions.  Others were \ntransported directly to 100 Centre Street.  Upon information and belief all those arrested \nwere fingerprinted, regardless of the offense with which they were charged. \n24.  Eventually, those arrested on 16th Street were released, with some of them having \nspent over two days in police custody. \n25.  The mass arrest of people at demonstrations substantially chills the exercise of \nFirst Amendment rights.  When the police arrest large numbers of people engaged in \nlawful activity at or near demonstrations, those arrested are far less likely to be \ncomfortable engaging in future protest activity.  Moreover, when such arrests take place \nat highly publicized events such as the Republican National Convention, the public at \nlarge is given the message that participation in protest activity is likely to lead to arrest. \nPLAINTIFF HACER DINLER \n26.  Plaintiff Hacer Dinler is a twenty-eight year-old, Turkish-born resident of \nBrooklyn, New York.  She works as a dance and fitness instructor and conducts private \nsessions with clients throughout New York City and in Scarsdale, New York.   \n27.  One of the dance studios at which Ms. Dinler holds sessions is Sal Anthonyโs \nMovement Salon, located at 190 3rd Avenue at 17th Street.  On August 31 she worked at \nSal Anthonyโs from approximately 1:00 to 7:00 p.m.  She left the studio and began to \n   8 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 9 of 23\nwalk downtown to teach a dance class scheduled for 8:00 p.m. in a studio called Lila, on \nBowery near Houston Street. \n28.  Ms. Dinlerโs route took her toward Union Square via 16th Street.  While walking \non the north sidewalk of 16th Street from Irving Place toward Union Square East, she \nsaw one of the marching bands playing music in the street and many people watching the \nband and chanting. \n29.  Ms. Dinler then noticed a large number of police officers blocking the Union \nSquare East end of 16th Street.  Frightened by the police and the large crowd of people, \nshe froze for a moment, then turned back toward Irving Place.  At this point she saw that \nher exit had been blocked by the other line of police, who had closed off Irving Place \nwith orange netting.  Ms. Dinler told some of the police officers that she was on her way \nto teach a dance class and that she needed to get by, but they would not let her leave the \narea. \n30.  When the police on both ends of the block began to close in, Ms. Dinler, along \nwith about 60 or 70 other people, was forced against a building on the north side of 16th \nStreet.   Police surrounded the group in a semi-circle.  Ms. Dinler asked why she had \nbeen detained, but the officers were unresponsive. \n31.  Ms. Dinler watched as members of the band who had been marching in the street \nwere pulled out of the crowd and arrested.  Many were thrown violently to the ground by \nthe police.  Ms. Dinler saw blood on peopleโs faces and was very concerned both for the \n   9 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 10 of 23\nmusicians and for her own well-being.  She hoped that once the marchers had been \narrested, the police would let the rest of the people go.  Instead, the police began to arrest \neveryone on the block, putting them in plastic handcuffs (known as flexcuffs) and taking \nthem to city buses that were parked on Irving Place. \n32.  Ms. Dinler was held on the sidewalk by the police for approximately two hours, \nwhile other people on the block were individually arrested and taken to the buses.  She \nrequested to use a bathroom, but was refused.  After approximately two hours, the police \nbegan to arrest the people around Ms. Dinler.   \n33.  At this point Ms. Dinler became extremely upset and began to cry.  Her heart was \nbeating rapidly and she felt panicked.  After about five minutes, Ms. Dinler fainted.  For \nthe next several minutes she lay on the ground, going in and out of consciousness, her \nbody shaking, convulsing, and contracting without her control. \n34.  Eventually, an ambulance arrived and transported Ms. Dinler to Saint Vincentโs \nHospital.  While en route to the hospital, she was given two injections in an effort to relax \nher muscles.  As a result of the injections, Ms. Dinler received bruises on her arms that \nlasted for approximately two weeks.  She still experiences pain at the site of the \ninjections. \n35.  Ms. Dinler arrived at Saint Vincentโs at approximately 9:30 p.m.  She spent \napproximately two hours in the emergency room, where the doctors had difficulty \ncontrolling her convulsions.  She was told she had a very high temperature.  She also felt \n   10 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 11 of 23\nvery confused and groggy, as a result of the injections she had been given.  At some \npoint, a police officer came to the hospital and spoke to Ms. Dinler, telling her that she \nwould not be charged with a crime.   \n36.  After the officer left, Ms. Dinler had another convulsion and was given another \ninjection.  The hospital also administered a CAT scan and blood tests. \n37.  Ms. Dinler was finally released at 4:00 a.m. the morning of September 1.  She \nwas told to return to Saint Vincentโs the following Friday for a follow-up visit.  Because \nshe has no health insurance, Ms. Dinler decided she could not afford to return for this \nvisit. \n38.  After leaving the hospital, Ms. Dinler finally arrived at her home at approximately \n5:00 a.m.  She spent the entire day in bed, recovering from her ordeal.  As a result, she \nwas unable to travel that day to Scarsdale, New York, where she had scheduled a full day \nof private sessions.  Ms. Dinler was also unable to attend scheduled sessions the \nfollowing day, and only was able to return to work on the evening of September 2. \n39.  In addition to the bruises and pain she still suffers from the injections, Ms. Dinler \nhas experienced severe emotional distress as a result of her ordeal.  She feels nervous and \nfearful around police officers.  She remains upset about what happened, and the \nexperience has adversely affected her work.  Ms. Dinler also received a $2,500 hospital \nbill, which she has had to worry about trying to pay, since she does not have health \ninsurance. \n   11 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 12 of 23\nPLAINTIFF ANN MAURER \n40.  Plaintiff Ann Maurer is a twenty-five year-old resident of Astoria, Queens.  Ms. \nMaurer has lived in Astoria since May 2004, when she moved from New Orleans, \nLouisiana.  She is currently the assistant to the legal director of the American Civil \nLiberties Union in New York.  Ms. Maurer has participated in approximately ten protests \nin her life.  While living in New Orleans, she once served as a volunteer marshal during \nan anti-war protest and helped to negotiate a march route with the local police. \n41.  On August 31 Ms. Maurer left work at 5:00 p.m.  She had three friends in town \nfrom New Orleans, and she met them at Union Square at 5:30.  Her friends had read \nflyers about events taking place at Union Square that evening and wanted to see what was \ngoing on. \n42.  Ms. Maurer and her friends watched the musical groups that were playing in \nUnion Square.  After being handed a flyer by a demonstrator, they decided to join the \ngroup.  One of Ms. Maurerโs friends had a flight the next day, so they had no intention of \ngetting arrested.  In fact, Ms. Maurer and her friends planned to return home after the \ndemonstration and spend a quiet Thursday evening at her apartment.  They were \nconfident that they would not be arrested if they stayed on the sidewalk and did not block \nthe street.  Accordingly, as the group began to proceed northbound along Union Square \nEast, she and her friends crossed the street and walked on the far sidewalk.  They then \nproceed north to 16th Street, which they crossed in the crosswalk.  At that point Ms. \nStauber and her friends encountered a  line of police officers blocking the northbound \n   12 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 13 of 23\nsidewalk (as well as all of Union Square East).  They therefore turned east on 16th Street, \ncarefully remaining on the sidewalk as the group of demonstrators also proceeded east on \n16th Street. \n43.  As they neared the intersection of 16th Street and Irving Place, Ms. Maurer saw \nthe line of police officers blocking the street.  By this point, the police had also blocked \noff the Union Square East end of the block in a similar fashion.  Ms. Maurer was standing \nwithin ten to fifteen feet of the police line at Irving Place and did not hear any order to \ndisperse or any other communication from the police. \n44.  After the police began to close in on either side of the block, Ms. Maurer and her \nfriends were gradually pushed into a group surrounded by police officers on the north \nsidewalk on 16th Street. \n45.  The police began arresting individual protestors who had been wearing masks and \ncostumes and those who had been playing music.  Ms. Maurer then heard an officer state \nover a megaphone that everyone on the block was under arrest.  At approximately 7:15 \np.m., Ms. Maurer and her friends were restrained with flexcuffs and put onto city buses \nthat were parked on Irving Place.  Ms. Maurer and her female friend were put onto a bus \nof about 50 women, while her two male friends were taken to an all-male bus.  Ms. \nMaurerโs bag was searched before she was allowed onto the bus. \n46.  The bus was then driven to Pier 57 by a police officer who did not appear to be an \nexperienced bus driver.  On the way to Pier 57, the bus struck several vehicles, two of \n   13 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 14 of 23\nwhich were parked.  Many of the women on the bus were complaining that the flexcuffs \naround their arms were too tight and were causing pain.  After arriving at Pier 57, no one \nwas allowed off of the bus, and Ms. Maurer and the others sat there for about an hour.  \nNo one was allowed to use restrooms during this time.  One woman on the bus became ill \nand started vomiting and was only released from her flexcuffs and assisted by police \nofficers after repeated calls by other arrestees. \n47.  The bus was then driven to 100 Centre Street, where again it sat parked for \napproximately one hour before anyone was let out.  The bus pulled into a gated \nenclosure, where everyone was let out and put into two lines.  They then walked single \nfile into a courtyard at 100 Centre Street, where they were assigned in groups of four to \nan arresting officer and photographed.  Ms. Maurerโs bag was confiscated, her flexcuffs \nwere removed, and she was given an extensive pat down search before entering the \nbuilding. \n48.  For the rest of the night, Ms. Maurer was moved through a series of holding cells.  \nBetween the first and second cells she filled out paperwork with her arresting officer, and \nprovided photo identification.  Around 7:00 a.m., when she was moved between the third \nand fourth cells, Ms. Maurer was fingerprinted.  At no point during the fingerprinting \nprocedure did anyone ask Ms. Maurer for her identification.  Ms. Maurer was not being \nsought by law enforcement officials for the commission of some other offense, nor would \nthe officers who fingerprinted her have any reason to suspect that she was.  Ms. Maurer \nwas moved to four different holding cells throughout the night. \n   14 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 15 of 23\n49.  Ms. Maurer was finally released at approximately 3:30 p.m. on the afternoon of \nSeptember 1, about 20 hours after the police had first placed her in flexcuffs. At her \nrelease, she was charged with disorderly conduct and given a Desk Appearance Ticket.  \nAfter being released, she had to wait in line for another two hours at One Police Plaza to \nretrieve her bag. \nPLAINTIFF ASHLEY WATERS \n50.  Plaintiff Ashley Waters is a twenty-six year-old Harvard Law School student \nresiding in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Ms. Waters also received her undergraduate \ndegree from Harvard University.  Following graduation, she worked at the investment \nbanking firm of Peter J. Solomon for a year, then did volunteer work and traveled \noverseas before starting law school in the fall of 2002.  In the summer after her first year \nof law school, Ms. Waters worked for the San Francisco District Attorneyโs office and \noften interacted with San Francisco police officers, whom she greatly respected.  During \nthe summer of 2004, Ms. Waters lived in New York and split her time between the law \nfirm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld and the New York Attorney Generalโs office.  \nDuring the week of August 31, Ms. Waters was staying with her boyfriend, who resides \npermanently on 21st Street and First Avenue, before returning to Cambridge to begin her \nthird year of law school.  She has never participated in a political protest and, prior to the \nevents of August 31, had never been arrested. \n51.  On the afternoon of August 31, Ms. Waters exercised at the New York Sports \nClub on East 23rd Street and Park Avenue and left the facility at approximately 6:20 p.m.  \n   15 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 16 of 23\nBefore heading home and while still carrying her gym bag, she walked toward Union \nSquare, with the intention of checking the movie schedules at theaters in the area.   \n52.  At about 6:45 p.m. she noticed the crowd at the southern end of Union Square and \nstopped to listen to a band of musicians that was playing there.  Various groups of people \nmilled about the area listening to the music, some apparently protestors and others simply \ninterested observers or bystanders.  Ms. Waters was unaware that a protest had been \nscheduled at that time and place until she came upon it. \n53.  After Ms. Waters had been listening to the band for about ten or fifteen minutes, \nthe band and other demonstrators began to move.  They marched north on Union Square \nEast then, after encountering a line of police officers, headed east toward Irving Place on \n16th Street.  Many people followed the band across Union Square East onto 16th Street.  \nMs. Waters--who had no intention of protesting, joining the musicians, or getting \narrested--and a few other curious observers followed the group at a distance, crossing \nonto the north sidewalk of 16th Street. \n54.  Ms. Waters walked toward Irving Place on the sidewalk of the northern side of \n16th Street.  As she neared Irving Place, she noticed that the street had become crowded \nwith people, both on the sidewalk and in the street. \n55.  When she had almost reached Irving Place, Ms. Waters realized that the entire \nblock had been barricaded by a line of police officers standing shoulder-to-shoulder \nacross the street.  Upon realizing the passage had been blocked, Ms. Waters turned \n   16 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 17 of 23\naround and attempted to walk back in the direction of Union Square.  At this point, the \ncrowded street and sidewalk became hectic and chaotic.  Ms. Waters crossed to the south \nsidewalk in an effort to avoid the crowd, while the band she had been observing remained \non the street. \n56.  At this point, Ms. Waters noticed that another line of police officers had moved \nonto 16th Street from the Union Square side of the block.  These officers formed a \nmoving barricade, forcing people into a small space up against a building on the southern \nsidewalk, near Irving Place.  With their batons out, the officers formed a semi-circle and \nheld Ms. Waters and the others against the building.  Ms. Waters estimates that \napproximately 50 people were compressed into the semi-circle. \n57.  Ms. Waters expected the police to tell the crowd to disperse, but the police made \nno communication to the group.  Instead, police officers began arresting certain \nindividuals.  Ms. Waters witnessed some members of the band wearing orange and grey \nbeing roughly pulled from the group, thrown to the ground, and arrested.  At this point, \nMs. Waters began crying.  The police officers surrounding the group and standing two \nfeet in front of her noticed her distress but did not attempt to reassure her or calm her. \n58.  Soon after, a commanding officer appeared to give an order to another officer \nregarding the group being held against the building.  This other officer then told the \ngroup that they were all under arrest, and everyone sat down on the sidewalk.  At this \npoint it was approximately 7:15 p.m. \n   17 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 18 of 23\n59.  The police began to arrest people one-by-one, putting each person in flexcuffs and \ntaking them to the city buses parked on Irving Place.  Ms. Watersโ bag was searched, but \nnothing of interest was found.  At this time, two buses were filled, one with men and one \nwith women.  Ms. Waters was placed on the same bus as was Ms. Maurer, whom she had \nnot met before. \n60.  After being placed in flexcuffs and put on the bus, she was driven to Pier 57, \nwhere she sat for approximately one hour in the bus.  Many of the women were \nscreaming at the bus driver or crying because their flexcuffs were hurting them.  Without \never being taken out of the bus at Pier 57, Ms. Waters and her fellow arrestees were next \ndriven to 100 Centre Street, where they waited for about an hour before being let off the \nbus.  Ms. Waters was on the bus until approximately 11:00 in the evening.   \n61.  While on the bus for over three hours, Ms. Waters and the others were given no \nfood or water, had no access to bathrooms, and those with medical complaints were not \ngiven timely treatment.  One person on the bus was vomiting, and another was in need of \nmedical attention to relieve the pain her flexcuffs were causing her.  It was only after \npersistent pleading from the other women on the bus that these two arrestees received \nmedical attention.  After the first couple of hours in flexcuffs, with her hands secured \nbehind her back, Ms. Waters began to suffer from a great deal of pain and discomfort in \nher arms and shoulders. \n62.  After being taken off the bus, police forced the group into a double-file line to \nawait processing.  Ms. Waters waited in this line for approximately one hour before \n   18 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 19 of 23\nfinally being processed.  The flexcuffs were then cut off.  Ms. Watersโ bag was \nconfiscated by the police, and she was not given a property receipt.  Overwhelmed and \nsurprised by the events of the previous few hours, Ms. Waters was again in tears, as were \nsome of her fellow arrestees. \n63.  During processing, Ms. Waters was fingerprinted by a police officer.  Her \nidentification was in her bag, which the police had already confiscated.  However, at no \npoint during the fingerprinting procedure did anyone ask Ms. Waters for identification.  \nMs. Waters was not being sought by law enforcement officials for the commission of any \nother offense, nor would the officers who fingerprinted her have any reason to suspect \nthat she was. \n64.  Ms. Waters was put into a holding cell with about twenty other people around \nmidnight.  She was then moved for no apparent reason to numerous different cells \nthroughout the night until 8:00 a.m.  Most of the cells were crowded, and Ms. Waters \neventually lay down on the floor to try to sleep. \n65.  Ms. Waters remained in a holding cell until 5:00 p.m. on the evening of \nSeptember 1, when she was taken from the cell to be arraigned.  Outside the courtroom, \nshe was told by her assigned public defender that she had been charged with two counts \nof disorderly conduct and one count of marching without a permit.  Ms. Waters appeared \nbefore the judge and agreed to an Adjournment Contemplation of Dismissal agreement.  \nMs. Waters was able to leave the courtroom by 6:00 p.m. \n   19 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 20 of 23\n66.  After being released, Ms. Waters attempted to retrieve her bag, which had been \nconfiscated by the police.  An officer told her she would need photo identification and a \nproperty receipt to get her bag back.  However, she had not been given a receipt, and her \nidentification was in the confiscated bag.  Eventually, after expressing her extreme \ndistress over the entire situation, and indicating that she was without any money, \nidentification, or the keys to her apartment, an officer helped her locate her bag.  Ms. \nWaters was finally able to leave around 7:00 p.m. \n67.  Throughout the entire ordeal, Ms. Watersโ emotional distress was significant.  \nHaving spent the previous summer working closely with police officers in San Francisco, \nas an intern for the District Attorneyโs office there, she had a great deal of respect for \npolice officers and the work they do.  As a result of the mass-arrest tactics she witnessed \non 16th Street and her treatment while in custody, Ms. Watersโ faith in the law \nenforcement system has been shaken.  She is still interviewing for positions after law \nschool with the District Attorneyโs office, but is now doing so with a more critical eye \nbecause of her traumatic experience.  \n68.  Additionally, Ms. Waters has experienced personal distress because she believed \nshe had not done anything wrong and should not have been arrested.  Ms. Waters had \nstood on the sidewalk, only observing the events that were going on around her, never \nsaying a word to a police officer or even participating in the protest activities.  She was \nnever told to leave the area or warned that she could be arrested.  Indeed, since the police \nhad blocked off both ends of 16th Street, she was arrested and detained without being \ngiven any opportunity to leave the area at all. \n   20 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-07921-RJS-JCF   Document 1   Filed 10/07/04   Page 21 of 23\nJURY DEMAND \n69.  The plaintiffs demand a jury trial on each and every one of their claims. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n70.
