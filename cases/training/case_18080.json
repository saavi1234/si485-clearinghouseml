    "summary": "<p>This is a federal criminal case where the government attempted to introduce evidence obtained through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). On August 14, 2018, two operators of a Detroit gas station were indicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan for the crime of defrauding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The defendants allegedly bought SNAP funds from recipients with cash at a discounted price, then fraudulently billed the government for the total value. They were charged with 14 counts of wire fraud (18 U.S.C. &sect; 1343). The case was assigned to United States District Judge Nancy G. Edmunds. On September 12, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice notified the criminal defendants in this case that some of the evidence the government intended to use against them was obtained from a FISA warrant obtained under 50 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1801-1812.</p>\r\n<p>Both men were released on bail after their arraignment on August 16, 2018. One defendant, represented by a federal public defender, pleaded guilty to a single count of wire fraud on December 6, 2018, prior to filing any pretrial motions. He was sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison on April 18, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>The other defendant, represented by private counsel, filed several pretrial motions relating to the FISA evidence. On February 8, 2019, he moved for discovery of the evidence obtained under FISA, as well as the application and order that allowed the government to collect it.</p>\r\n<p>The government opposed this motion. On June 6, 2019, it filed a declaration from Attorney General William P. Barr claiming that an adversarial hearing would endanger national security and asking the court to conduct an <em>ex parte</em> and <em>in camera</em> review of the relevant documents. This process is set out in 50 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1806(f) and 1825(g).</p>\r\n<p>Later on September 19, 2019, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictment against him, claiming that the use of FISA material in this prosecution was improper because he was charged with a domestic criminal offense with no relationship to the normal subjects of FISA: foreign powers or their agents.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Edmunds denied both of the defendants' motions in a December 24, 2020 order. After reviewing the FISA warrant and application materials <em>ex parte</em> and <em>in camera</em> she found that they complied with the relevant statutory standards. In denying the defendant's motion to dismiss, she also found that FISA materials could be used in cases without a national security connection when the original surveillance was designed to obtain foreign intelligence information. 2020 WL 7664789.</p>\r\n<p>After his motions were denied, the remaining defendant eventually pleaded guilty to misprison of a felony and received a sentence of 2 years probation on January 18, 2022. The case is now closed</p>",

Edmunds \nNASSIF SAMI DAHER D-2 \n           \n    Defendant. \n________________________________/ \n \nORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISCOVER  \nAND MOTION TO DISMISS[28] [43] \n \nIn this criminal case, Defendant is charged with four counts of wire fraud in violation \nof 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343, 2.  The charges relate to allegations of food stamp fraud.  On \nSeptember 12, 2018, the Government provided notice to Defendant and the Court that it \nintends to offer into evidence, or otherwise use or disclose information that was obtained \nor  derived  from  electronic  surveillance  conducted  under  the  Foreign  Intelligence \nSurveillance Act (“FISA”). (ECF No. 21.) \n  After receiving this notice, Defendant filed two related motions that are currently \npending before the Court: Defendant’s motion for discovery of evidence (ECF No. 28) \nand Defendant’s motion to dismiss his indictment (ECF No. 43).  Defendant argues the \nGovernment’s use of FISA materials in this case is improper, and he seeks discovery and \nsuppression of the materials, and ultimately dismissal of the charges against him.  The \nGovernment opposes the motions.  As discussed below, the Court conducted an ex parte \nand in camera review of the FISA materials as required by 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f).  Having \ncompleted its review and having considered the entire record in this matter as well as the \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cr-20559-NGE-MKM   ECF No. 59, PageID.468   Filed 12/24/20   Page 2 of 10\nrelevant statutory and legal authorities, the Court finds that Defendant’s motions should \nbe DENIED.   \nI.  BACKGROUND \n \nOn August 14, 2018, a grand jury in the Eastern District of Michigan returned an \nindictment charging Defendant and a co-defendant with multiple counts of wire fraud in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343, 2.  The indictment accuses Defendant and his co-\ndefendant of engaging in a scheme to obtain Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \nfunds by fraudulent means.  The indictment identifies fourteen allegedly fraudulent wire \ntransfers related to this scheme, and Defendant is alleged to have been involved with at \nleast four of those transfers.1   \nOn September 12, 2018, the Government provided notice pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § \n1806(c) of its intent to offer into evidence or otherwise use information obtained or derived \nfrom electronic surveillance conducted pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct of 1978 (“FISA” or “the Act”).  Thereafter, Defendant filed the instant motion seeking, \namong other things, disclosure and then suppression of the FISA materials.2   \nDefendant was born in Michigan and is an American citizen.  He is of Lebanese \ndescent, meaning his ethnic heritage is Lebanese.  He claims he is not an agent of a \nforeign power.  And as he points out, he has not been charged with a crime related to \nnational security or terrorism.  To this end, Defendant contends the use of FISA materials \nis improper in the criminal prosecution of an American citizen for an entirely “domestic” \ncriminal prosecution.  He also claims that the FISA warrants at issue here were improper \n \n1 On December 6, 2018, Defendant’s co-defendant pled guilty to one count of wire fraud, and on \nApril 18, 2019 he was sentenced to one year and one day in prison.   \n2 Defendant also filed a motion seeking dismissal of the indictment, which in turn relies on \nsuppression of the FISA materials.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cr-20559-NGE-MKM   ECF No. 59, PageID.469   Filed 12/24/20   Page 3 of 10\nbecause in his view, the primary purpose of the warrants and subsequent surveillance \nwas for a domestic criminal prosecution.   \nII.  DISCUSSION  \n \nA. Overview of FISA and the Role of the Court  \nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (as previously defined, “FISA” or \n“the Act”) prescribes the methods whereby the Government may conduct electronic \nsurveillance and physical searches of a “foreign power” or “agent of a foreign power” after \na high-ranking official certifies that a “significant purpose” of the search is to collect \n“foreign intelligence information.”3  If authorized by the United States Attorney General, \ninformation derived from FISA surveillance and searches may be used in subsequent \ncriminal prosecutions. 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(b) and 1825(c).  The statute does not expressly \nlimit the types of criminal prosecutions in which such information can be used.  However, \nbefore the FISA materials may be introduced, the Government must provide notice to the \ncourt and to the party against whom the evidence will be introduced. 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(c) \nand 1825(d).  \nAfter receiving notice that the Government intends to use FISA materials, the \n“aggrieved party”—the party against whom the surveillance or search was conducted—\nmay move to discover and/or to suppress the evidence based on the grounds that: (1) the \ninformation was unlawfully acquired; or (2) the electronic surveillance or physical search \ndid not conform to the order authorizing the action. 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(e) and 1825(f).  \n \n3 The role of FISA Courts and the process for obtaining search warrants under FISA is set forth in \nthe statute, and discussed in significant detail in the Government’s briefing as well as in the opinion of many \nother district courts. See, e.g., United States v. Alwan, No. 1:11-CR-13-R, 2012 WL 399154, at *1–11 (W.D. \nKy. Feb. 7, 2012). \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cr-20559-NGE-MKM   ECF No. 59, PageID.470   Filed 12/24/20   Page 4 of 10\nThe motion must be made to the district court in which the matter is pending, and the \ndistrict court has the jurisdiction to determine whether the surveillance or search was \nillegal or not in conformity with the order of the FISC. 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(f) and 1825(g). \nOnce the district court receives a motion to discover or suppress FISA materials, \nthe court may address the motion as it would in any other criminal case unless the \nAttorney  General  files  an  affidavit  declaring  that  disclosure  of  the  evidence  or  an \nadversarial hearing on the motion would harm the national security of the United States. \n50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(f) and 1825(g). \nIf, as in the present case, the Attorney General files such an affidavit, the district \ncourt must “review in camera and ex parte the application, order, and such other materials \nrelating to the surveillance [or physical search] as may be necessary to determine \nwhether  the  surveillance  [or  physical  search]  of  the  aggrieved  person  was  lawfully \nauthorized and conducted.” 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(f) and 1825(g).  When reviewing the FISA \nmaterials in camera and ex parte, the district court may disclose the applications, orders, \nor other materials related to the surveillance or search to the aggrieved person “only \nwhere such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of \nthe surveillance [or search].” 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(f) and 1825(g). \nAccordingly, when a motion to suppress by the defendant is followed by the \naffidavit of the Attorney General, in camera and ex parte review of the FISA materials is \nthe rule, and disclosure of any such evidence to the criminal defendant is the exception. \nSee United States v. Belfield, 692 F.2d 141, 147 (D.C.Cir. 1982) ( “The language [of the \nFISA statutes] clearly anticipates that an ex parte, in camera determination is to be the \nrule.  Disclosure  and  an  adversary  hearing  are  the  exception,  occurring  only  when \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cr-20559-NGE-MKM   ECF No. 59, PageID.471   Filed 12/24/20   Page 5 of 10\nnecessary.”)  Disclosure should only take place where the court is unable to make an \naccurate determination as to the legality of the evidence. See United States v. Daoud, \n755 F.3d 479, 482 (7th Cir.), supplemented, 761 F.3d 678 (7th Cir. 2014) (discussing 50 \nU.S.C. 1806(f)).  If the court can make an accurate determination without disclosure to \nthe defendant, then the FISA materials should not be disclosed. Id. \nB. Standards of Review Applied to FISA Applications and Orders . \n \nWhen a Defendant's motion to suppress is followed by the Attorney General's \naffidavit requiring in camera and ex parte review, the district court must determine the \nlegality  of  the  FISA  surveillance  or  search.  The  district  court  applies  the  following \nstandards of review in conducting this analysis. \n1.  Standard of Review Applicable to FISA Applications. \n \nA FISA application is subject only to minimal scrutiny upon review by the reviewing \ndistrict court. See United States v. Abu–Jihaad, 630 F.3d 102, 130 (2d Cir. 2010).  Where \na statutory application “was properly made and earlier approved by a FISA judge, it carries \na strong presumption of veracity and regularity in a reviewing court.” See United States \nv.  Mohammad,  339  F.  Supp.  3d  724,  736  (N.D.  Ohio  2018).    When  reviewing  an \napplication,  the  district  court  must  ensure  that  the  application  contains  all  of  the \nrequirements listed in 50 U.S.C. §§ 1804 and 1823.  In reviewing the procedural check \nlist, the court's emphasis falls on the requirement that the application be accompanied by \nthe certification of a high-ranking official. 50 U.S .C. §§ 1804(6) and 1823(6). \nLike the application itself, the “certification is ... subjected to only minimal scrutiny \nby the courts.” Mohammad, 339 F. Supp. 3d at 736 (citing United States v. Badia, 827 \nF.2d 1458, 1463 (11th Cir. 1987).  The certification is used to ensure that a significant \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cr-20559-NGE-MKM   ECF No. 59, PageID.472   Filed 12/24/20   Page 6 of 10\npurpose of the surveillance or search is to ob tain foreign intelligence information. 50 \nU.S.C.  §§  1804(a)(6)(B)  and  1823(a)(6)(B).  The  FISA  judge,  reviewing  the  initial \napplication “is not to second-guess the executive branch official's certification that the \nobjective of the surveillance is foreign intelligence information.” Id. (quoting United States \nv. Duggan, 743 F.2d 59, 77 (2nd. Cir. 1984)) . Similarly, “when a person affected by a \nFISA surveillance [or search] challenges the FISA Court's order, a reviewing court is to \nhave no greater authority to second-guess the executive branch's certifications than has \nthe FISA Judge....” Id.  In all, the Government's application for a FISA order, and the \ncertification of a high-ranking official accompanying it, are given substantial deference \nand only receive minimal scrutiny when reviewed by the district court. \n2.  Standard of Review Applicable to FISA Orders. \n \nUpon a defendant's motion to suppress pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(e) and \n1825(f), a district court must also review the FISA order authorizing the surveillance or \nsearch and more specifically, the FISA Judge’s determination of probable cause.  The \nCourt must find that the FISA order contained a finding of probable cause by the FISA \njudge that the target of the surveillance or search is a foreign power or agent of a foreign \npower and that the facilities or places at which the surveillance is directed or the premises \nor property to be searched is or is about to be owned, used, possessed by, or is in transit \nto or from a foreign power or agent of a foreign power. 50 U.S.C. §§ 1805(a)(2) and \n1824(a)(2).  Unlike the FISA application, however, the FISA judge's probable cause \ndetermination is reviewed de novo by the district court upon a defendant's motion to \nsuppress. See Mohammad, 339 F. Supp. 3d at 736. See also United States v. Hassan, \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cr-20559-NGE-MKM   ECF No. 59, PageID.473   Filed 12/24/20   Page 7 of 10\n742 F.3d 104, 138–39 (4th Cir. 2014) (stating that the district court reviewed the probable \ncause determinations de novo in accordance with the Fourth Circuit's precedent).  \nC. Analysis of the Legality of the FISA Materials in the Present Case. \n \nDefendant moves pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(e) and 1825(f) to discover and/or \nsuppress all FISA materials including any evidence derived from or relating to any \nelectronic surveillance or physical searches conducted against him as authorized by order \nof the FISC.  The Government opposes Defendant’s motion and has submitted an \naffidavit of the United States Attorney General declaring that any disclosure of or hearing \non these matters will harm the national security of the United States.  \nAs a result of the Attorney General's affidavit, the Court conducted an in camera \nand ex parte review of the FISA materials.  This review included all of the FISA warrant \napplications, orders, and related documents and exhibits.  Based on that review, the Court \nfinds that: (1) the FISA applications complied with the statutory requirements, and (2) the \nFISA orders satisfied the statutory requirements and were based on probable cause.  \nMore specifically, after conducting its in camera and ex parte review, the Court makes the \nfollowing findings: \n(i)  the Court finds that each FISA application contained the requirements set \nforth in 50 U.S.C. § 1084 and 1823.   \n \n(ii)  the Court finds that the applications contained a statement of the proposed \nminimization procedures and a certification by a high-ranking official and \nthat the proposed minimization procedures are those previously proposed \nby the Attorney General and approved of by the FISC. \n  \n(iii)  The Court finds that a “significant purpose” of the surveillance or search \nwas to obtain “foreign intelligence information.”  \n \n(iv)  And the Court finds that the FISA applications for electronic surveillance or \nphysical search complied with the FISA application statutes.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cr-20559-NGE-MKM   ECF No. 59, PageID.474   Filed 12/24/20   Page 8 of 10\n \nAs such, the Court finds no error in the applications or accompanying certifications, and \nwhere the applications are procedurally accurate, the Court's inquiry is complete. \nIn addition, after conducting its ex parte and in camera review, the Court finds that \nthe orders complied with the procedural requirements set forth in 50 U.S.C. §§ 1805 and \n1824, and contained the necessary findings, specifications, and directions required by \nthose sections.  Moreover, the Court finds there was sufficient probable cause to believe \nthat Defendant was “an agent of a foreign power” and that each of the facilities, places, \npremises, or property at which the electronic surveillance or physical search was directed \nwas, or was about to be owned, used, possessed by, or was in transit to or from \nDefendant. See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1805(a)(2) and 1824(a)(2).  Thus any argument based on \nthe Government's failure to demonstrate probable cause, or that the Government was \nrequired to make a greater showing of probable cause, are without merit.  The FISA \norders contained the elements required by statute and were issued based on a valid \nfinding of probable cause. \nFinally,  the  Court  turns  to  Defendant’s  argument  that  it  is  improper  for  the \nGovernment  to  use  information  discovered  through  a  FISA  warrant  “for  an  entirely \ndomestic prosecution.”  In other words, according to Defendant, it is improper to use FISA \nmaterials to prosecute a crime like food-stamp fraud that is not directly related to the \ndefendant’s alleged agency to a foreign power.   \nThe Court recognizes the legitimacy of Defendant’s Fourth Amendment concerns.  \nAnd the Court echoes similar concerns raised by the Ninth Circuit in United States v. \nGartenlaub:  \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cr-20559-NGE-MKM   ECF No. 59, PageID.475   Filed 12/24/20   Page 9 of 10\nThe idea that the government can decide that someone is a foreign agent \nbased on secret information; on that basis obtain computers containing \n“[t]he sum of [that] individual’s private life,” Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373, \n134 S.Ct. 2473, 2489, 189 L.Ed.2d 430 (2014); and then prosecute that \nindividual  for  completely  unrelated  crimes  discovered  as  a  result  of \nrummaging through that computer comes perilously close to the exact \nabuses against which the Fourth Amendment was designed to protect. \nHowever,  the  district  court  did  not  commit  plain  error  by  concluding \notherwise. \n \nUnited States v. Gartenlaub, 751 F. App'x 998, 1000 (9th Cir. 2018), cert. denied, 139 S. \nCt. 1609, 203 L. Ed. 2d 757 (2019).  Yet notwithstanding this warning, in Gartenlaub, the \nNinth  Circuit  approved  the  use  of  FISA-derived  materials  and  found  no  Fourth \nAmendment  violation  occurred  in  connection  with  a  non-national  security  related \nprosecution for possession of child pornography. Id.   \nHere, Defendant presents no authority supporting the notion that FISA materials \ncannot be used in an entirely domestic criminal prosecution, and the Court is aware of \nnone.  In fact, the case law appears to be in opposite. See Gartenlaub, 751 F. App'x at \n998.  Thus under the circumstances presented here, where the clear purpose of the \nsurveillance was to obtain foreign intelligence information and there is no indication of an \nintent to uncover information about what the Defendant describes as “domestic crimes”, \nthe Court finds that Defendant fails to establish a violation of the Fourth Amendment.    \nIII.  CONCLUSION \n \nFor the above-stated reasons, Defendant's motions are DENIED. \n \nSO ORDERED. \ns/Nancy G. Edmunds                                     \nNancy G.

Barr, hereby declare the following: \n1.  I am the Attorney General of the United States of America artd head of \nthe United States Department of Justice, an Executive Department of the United \nStates.  I have official custody of and control over the files and records of the \nUnited States Department of Justice.  The matters stated herein are based on my \nknowledge, on consideration of information available to me in my official capacity \nas Attorney General, on discussions that I have had with other Justice Department \nofficials, and on conclusions I have reached after my review of this information. \n\nCase 2:18-cr-20559-NGE-MKM   ECF No. 39-1   filed 06/06/19    PageID.281    Page 2 of 4\n2.  Under the authority of 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f), I submit this declaration \npursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (\"FISA\"), as \namended, in connection with the above-captioned criminal proceeding.  I have \nbeen advised that the Government presently intends to use information obtained or \nderived from FISA-authorized electronic surveillance in the criminal proceeding \nagainst defendant Nassif Sami Daher (\"Daher\").  See 50 U.S.C. § 1806(c). \nDefendant Daher, by and through his attorney, filed a motion seeking disclosure of \nFISA-related materials (hereafter the \"defendant's motion\").  The Government \nwill file an opposition to the defendant's motion.  For the reasons set forth in the \nGovernment's opposition, it is necessary to provide this Court with the \napplication(s) submitted to, and the order(s) issued by, the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court, as well as other related documents (hereafter collectively \nreferred to as \"the FISA Materials\"). \n3.  Based on the facts and considerations set forth below, I hereby claim \nthat it would harm the national security of the United States to disclose or hold an \nadversary hearing with respect to the FISA Materials.  The United States will be \nsubmitting the relevant classified documents to this Court as part of a \"Sealed \nAppendix,\" so this Court may conduct an in camera, ex parte review of the legality \nof the FISA collection at issue.  My Claim of Privilege also extends to the \n2 \n\nCase 2:18-cr-20559-NGE-MKM   ECF No. 39-1   filed 06/06/19    PageID.282    Page 3 of 4\nclassified portions of any memoranda and briefs the Government may file in \nconnection with this litigation and to any oral representations that may be made by \nthe Government that reference the classified information contained in the FISA \nMaterials. \n· 4.  In support of my Claim of Privilege, the United States is submitting to \nthe Court for in camera, ex parte review the Declaration of Michael C. McGarrity, \nAssistant Director, Counterterrorism Division, Federal Bureau oflnvestigation. \nMr. McGarrity's Declaration sets foith, in detail, the specific facts on which my \nClaim of Privilege is based.  The Declaration of Mr. McGarrity is classified at the \n\"TOP SECRET\" level. \n5.  Relying on the facts set forth in the Declaration of Assistant Director \nMcGarrity, I certifY that the unauthorized disclosure of the FISA Materials that are \nclassified at the \"TOP SECRET\" level reasonably could be expected to cause \nexceptionally grave damage to the national security of the United States, and the \nunauthorized disclosure of the FISA materials that are classified at the \"SECRET\" \nlevel reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security \nof the United States.  The FISA Materials contain sensitive and classified \ninformation concerning United States intelligence sources and methods and other \ninformation related to efforts of the United States to conduct counterterrorism \n3 \n\nCase 2:18-cr-20559-NGE-MKM   ECF No. 39-1   filed 06/06/19    PageID.283    Page 4 of 4\ninvestigations, including the manner and means by which those investigations are \nconducted.  As a result, the unauthorized disclosure of the information could \nharm the national security interests of the United States. \n6.  I respectfully request that the Court treat the contents of the Sealed \nAppendix, for security purposes, in the same sensitive manner that the contents \nwere treated in the submission to this Court, and to return the Sealed Appendix to \nthe Department of Justice upon the disposition of the defendant's motion.  The \nDepartment of Justice will retain the Sealed Appendix under the seal of the Court \nsubject to any further orders of this Court or other courts of competent jurisdiction. \nPursuant to Title 28, United States Code, Section 1746, I declare undPer :::: \nt~e \npenalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [SNAP], formerly \nknown as the Food Stamp Program, was a federal welfare program funded by the \nUnited States Department of Agriculture [USDA] and, in Michigan, administered \nby the Michigan Department of Human Services [MDHS], formerly known as the \nMichigan Family Independence Agency; \n2.  The SNAP was created by statute and administered by regulation, and \n\nCase 2:18-cr-20559-NGE-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/14/18    PageID.2    Page 2 of 11\nwas designed to provide economically disadvantaged persons, meeting specified \neligibility criteria, with the funds to purchase essential food products for \nthemselves and their families; \n3.  Recipients of SNAP benefits could use those benefits solely for the \npurchase of eligible food items, and the sale of such benefits for cash was strictly \nprohibited; \n4.  Recipients of SNAP benefits could use those benefits only at retail food \nstores which were formally authorized to participate in the SNAP [SNAP stores]; \n5.  To become an SNAP store in Michigan, a store owner was required to \ncomplete, sign and submit an SNAP Application for Stores (FNS Form 252) to the \nUSDA Food and Nutrition Services Division [FNS] showing that the store met \neligibility requirements and containing an acknowledgment by the store owner that \nit was unlawful to trade cash for food stamp benefits and to accept benefits in \nexchange for anything but eligible food items; \n6.  The FNS 252 also contained an express promise that the applicant store \nowner would prevent violations of the SNAP rules and regulations such as trading \ncash for food stamp benefits, or accepting benefits from people not authorized to \nuse them or for payment for ineligible items; \n\nCase 2:18-cr-20559-NGE-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/14/18    PageID.3    Page 3 of 11\n7.  SNAP benefits recipients received Electronic Benefits Transfer [EBT] \ncards, commonly referred to as \"Bridge Cards\" due to a depiction of the Mackinaw \nBridge on the face of the card, along with Personal Identification Numbers [PINs] \nfrom the MDHS which were used to make food purchases from participating \nmerchants; \n8.  The MDHS authorized a specific monthly dollar amount of SNAP \nbenefits to eligible recipients which could be accessed only with their EBT cards \nand PINs; \n9.  When authorized to participate in the SNAP, retail food stores received \nelectronic terminals, known as \"Point of Sale\" [POS] terminals, from the FNS, \nwhich were required to process SNAP sales; \n10.  The purchase of eligible food items using SNAP benefits was \naccomplished in the following manner: \nA.  The recipient would select authorized food items at an SNAP \nstore and present them for purchase; \nB.  The recipient's EBT card would then be scanned by the POS \nterminal which would read the magnetic strip on the EBT card containing \nthe basic electronic information necessary to make the purchase; \nC.  The SNAP recipient would enter the PIN into the POS terminal; \n3 \n\nCase 2:18-cr-20559-NGE-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/14/18    PageID.4    Page 4 of 11\nD.  The POS terminal would then communicate electronically with a \ncentral database computer located outside of the State of Michigan by \nelectronic transmission to determine whether sufficient benefits were \navailable for the purchase; \nE.  The central database computer would then send the POS terminal, \nby wire, information that the purchase was authorized or denied based on the \namount of benefits available; \nF.  If authorized, the central database would deduct the purchase \nprice from the balance on the recipient's account and add a corresponding \namount to the SNAP store's account; \nG.  The central database would calculate the cumulative SNAP \nbenefit sales for each SNAP store on a daily basis and initiate electronic wire \ntransfers of Department of Agriculture funds from the United States \nTreasury to the SNAP participating retail store's designated bank account to \npay the SNAP store for SNAP purchases made that day; \n11. In August 2007, D-1 KAMEL MOHAMMAD RAMMAL [RAMMAL] \nand another individual, whose initials are ZS, formed a Michigan corporation \nunder the name K&M Petro to operate a gas station located at 9365 Van Dyke, \nDetroit, Michigan; \n4 \n\nCase 2:18-cr-20559-NGE-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/14/18    PageID.5    Page 5 of 11\n12. On or about December 10, 2007, K&M Petro applied to become an \neligible SNAP retailer; \n13. On or about December 17, 2007, RAMMAL received notification from \nthe USDA that the application of K&M Petro to become an eligible SNAP retailer \nwas denied because RAMMAL had been previously permanently disqualified from \nparticipating in the SNAP due to a prior finding that he was involved in \nexchanging cash for benefits at a different gas station; \n14. In March 2008, S&R Petro, Inc. was incorporated in Michigan to operate \na \"Service Station & Mini Mart\" at 9365 Van Dyke, Detroit, MI (the same location \nas K&M Petro) by the individual whose initials are ZS and RAMMAL's wife; \n15. In September 2008, ZS purportedly bought RAMMAL's wife's share of \nS&R Petro, Inc., thereby becoming, nominally, the sole owner of S&R Petro; \n16. In October 2008, S&R Petro applied to become an authorized SNAP \nretailer and also advised the USDA that ZS was the sole owner and would not \npermit any former owners of the disqualified business to have jobs at S&R Petro; \n17. In fact, RAMMAL owned and managed S&R Petro, and had authority \nover the S&R Petro Comerica Bank account designated to receive SNAP proceeds \nfor SNAP sales completed at S&R Petro; \n18. In about August 2016, D-2 NASSIF SAMI DAHER [DAHER] began his \n5 \n\nCase 2:18-cr-20559-NGE-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/14/18    PageID.6    Page 6 of 11\nemployment at S&R Petro; \nCOUNTS ONE-FOURTEEN: \nWIRE FRAUD, AIDING AND ABETTING \n(18 U.S.C. §§1343, 2: Defendants Specified in Counts) \n1.  The General Allegations are included in this count; \n2.  Beginning sometime before March 2, 2016, and continuing through May \n20 17 , in the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, D-1 KAMEL \nMOHAMAD RAMMAL [RAMMAL] and D-2 NASSIF SAMI DAHER \n[DAHER], defendants, both directly and aiding and abetting one another, did, \nhaving devised a scheme.to defraud and to obtain money from the USDA by \nmeans of false and fraudulent pretenses and representations, and for the purpose of \nexecuting that scheme, cause the transmission of writings, signs and signals by \nmeans of wire and radio transmission in interstate commerce; \n3.  The object of the scheme to defraud and to obtain money by false and \nfraudulent pretenses and representations was to obtain SNAP funds from the \nUSDA by purchasing benefits from SNAP recipients for cash at a fraction of their \nvalue, usually about 50%, and then obtaining the full value of the benefits from the \nUSDA by processing the transactions through S&R Petro's EBT terminal as \nthough the beneficiary had purchased eligible food items with the benefits, a \nprocess known as \"discounting.\" The SNAP beneficiaries were willing to accept \n6 \n\n----------\nCase 2:18-cr-20559-NGE-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/14/18    PageID.7    Page 7 of 11\ncash for their benefits at a highly discounted rate because it allowed them to use \nthe benefits for any purpose, rather than being restricted to the purchase of eligible \nfood items. The SNAP store engaged in discounting because it allowed the store to \nobtain money for nothing other than the use of its EBT terminal; \n4.  On or about the dates indicated below, in the Eastern District of \nMichigan, Southern Division, the defendants specified below did, for the purpose \nof executing the above-described scheme to defraud, cause the transmission of \nwritings, signs and signals by means of wire and radio transmission in interstate \ncommerce, specifically signals from Detroit, Michigan to Austin, Texas, each such \ntransmission representing a separate count of this indictment: \nCOUNT:  DATE:  DEFENDANTS: \nOne  March 2, 20 16  D-1 KAMELMOHAMMADRAMMAL \nTwo  April 6, 2016  D-1 KAMEL MOHAMMAD RAMMAL \nThree  May 31,2016  D-1 KAMEL MOHAMMAD RAMMAL \nFour  June 21, 2016  D-1 KAMEL MOHAMMAD RAMMAL \nFive  August 12, 2016  D-1 KAMEL MOHAMMAD RAMMAL \nSix  September 14, 2016  D-1 KAMEL MOHAMMAD RAMMAL \nSeven  December 13, 2016  D-1 KAMEL MOHAMMAD RAMMAL \nEight  December 20, 2016  D-1 KAMEL MOHAMMAD RAMMAL \nD-2 NASSIF DAHER \n7 \n\nCase 2:18-cr-20559-NGE-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/14/18    PageID.8    Page 8 of 11\nCOUNT:  DATE:  DEFENDANTS: \nNine  February 24, 2017  D-1 KAMEL MOHAMMAD RAMMAL \nTen  March 21, 2017  D-1 KAMEL MOHAMMAD RAMMAL \nD-2 NASSIF DAHER \nEleven  April27, 2017  D-1 KAMEL MOHAMMAD RAMMAL \nTwelve  April28, 2017  D-1 KAMEL MOHAMMAD RAMMAL \nThirteen  May 28,2017  D-1 KAMEL MOHAMMAD RAMMAL \nD-2 NASSIF DAHER \nFourteen  May 29,2017  D-1 KAMEL MOHAMMAD RAMMAL \nD-2 NASSIF DAHER \nall in violation in Sections 1343 and 2 ofTitle 18 of the United States Code. \nFORFEITURE ALLEGATIONS \n(18 U.S.C. §§ 982,981 and 28 U.S.C. § 2461- Criminal Forfeiture) \n1.
