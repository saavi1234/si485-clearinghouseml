    "summary": "<p>This is a lawsuit challenging the Chesapeake Detention Facility's response to COVID-19 and requesting the release of detainees and prisoners. On February 20, 2021 16, 2020, eight named plaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit and habeas petition in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs sued the warden of the facility and the secretary of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, which operates the facility, under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. They also petitioned the court for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241. Represented by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, as well as Bryan Cave, the plaintiffs sought to certify two classes, one of pretrial detainees and one of convicted prisoners, as well as a subclass of medically vulnerable pretrial detainees. They also requested injunctive relief to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the facility, the release of members of the medically vulnerable pretrial subclass, and attorneys' fees. The plaintiffs claimed that their rights under the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments were violated by the defendants' response to COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>The Chesapeake Detention Facility, located in Baltimore, is operated by the State of Maryland, but primarily houses people detained in connection with federal criminal cases on behalf of the United States Marshals Service. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants placed them at risk of contracting COVID-19 by moving individuals within units in the facility, inadequate cleaning and masking, and refusing to administer COVID-19 vaccines.</p>\r\n<p>According to the complaint, the plaintiffs' rights under the Fifth, Fourteenth, and Eighth Amendments were violated by their exposure to COVID-19, the plaintiffs' placement in solitary confinement due to an indefinite lockdown, and the plaintiffs' inability to challenge their placement in solitary confinement. Additionally, the plaintiffs requested that the court issue writs of habeas corpus to release medically vulnerable pretrial detainees.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to United States District Judge T.S. Ellis. Two days after filing their complaint, on February 20, 2021, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and the certification of a class. However, on March 15, 2021 Judge Ellis denied the motion for a temporary restraining order as moot, citing the parties' \"significant points of agreement.\" Judge Ellis ordered the parties to submit joint statements outlining their agreements and disagreements.</p>\r\n<p>On March 19, 2021, the parties submitted joint statements of agreement and disagreement. The defendants agreed to numerous safety measures, including testing all facility residents on a weekly basis and on arrival, prioritizing single occupancy cells for medically vulnerable residents, ensuring that residents were able to leave their cells for at least 2 hours a day when possible, cohorting residents to prevent the spread of COVID-19, offering vaccinations to eligible residents, and cleaning the facility. The defendants also agreed to produce documents demonstrating their compliance with the agreement to the plaintiffs and allow them to depose facility staff. The agreement allowed the court to resolve disputes between the the parties. However, the parties did have a number of disagreements about the practical mechanics of many provisions of the agreement, including cohorting, testing, solitary confinement, and transfer to other facilities.</p>\r\n<p>On April 15, 2021, the parties filed a joint status report announcing that they had reached a settlement agreement. The agreement provided that defendants would continue to identify \"high risk\" residents upon admission to the facility, which includes residents with certain medical conditions and elderly residents. The agreement also provided that defendants would sanitize the cells of all quarantined residents following their removal to isolation and wait at least four hours until moving a new resident into the cell. Defendants agreed to immediately remove all residents who test positive for COVID-19 to an isolated environment with clean and safe living conditions, including provisions of sanitized clothing and mental health counseling. The agreement also provided for weekly COVID-19 testing and contract tracing, with close contacts also being quarantined for 14 days. Defendants also agreed to move all \"high risk\" residents in quarantine to single cells if possible and enhanced monitoring with quarantined residents with documented mental health conditions. The agreement also provided for a tiered quarantine system divided into four separate categories: quarantine for newly admitted residents, quarantine for close contacts of COVID-positive individuals, medical isolation for COVID-positive individuals, and general population. The defendants also agreed to spread out residents when possible.</p>\r\n<p>Outside of COVID-testing and quarantining, the agreement also provided for guaranteed access to soap and vaccinations, with all residents and staff offered vaccination by May 1, 2021. The defendants also agreed to provide residents and staff up-to-date information on COVID-19 and agreed to provide disinfectants and hand sanitizer to residents on a daily basis, in addition to sanitizing common areas. The defendants also agreed to require proper mask-wearing and to provide at least two reusable masks to each resident upon admission unless they already possess at least two masks. The defendants agreed to produce detailed records for plaintiffs' counsel on a weekly basis regarding COVID-19 cases, testing, and the provision of disinfectants and personal protective equipment. Lastly, the defendants must allow experts designated by plaintiffs' counsel to inspect the facilities at least every 30 days.</p>\r\n<p>On April 20, 2021, the parties filed a consent motion to certify the class for settlement purposes. The Court granted the motion on April 23, 2021, and certified the class for settlement purposes only. On April 28, the parties filed a consent motion to dismiss. The Court granted the motion the same day and approved the settlement agreement. The Court retained jurisdiction for enforcement of the settlement agreement.</p>\r\n<p>The case is now closed.</p>",

Public  health \nofficials throughout the country have implored the general public to take protective measures to \ncurb  the  virus’s  spread.  But  the  people  in  Defendants’  care  and  custody  cannot  protect \nthemselves; only Defendants can ensure that they have the basic means to protect themselves, \nincluding  masks,  hygiene  products,  healthcare  services  (including  vaccination),  cleaning \nmaterials, and a means to distance themselves from people who may be infected. \n  Defendants Wilson and Green, in their official capacities in operating and overseeing the \nChesapeake Detention Facility (“CDF”), have failed to take reasonable measures to protect from \nCOVID-19 infection the residents of CDF in their custody and under their control. There is \nalready an outbreak of COVID-19 at CDF, with one-third of residents and staff testing positive \nin a month’s time. Moreover, CDF’s inadequate care for those with symptoms or confirmed \ncases increases the likelihood that those infected will suffer serious illness, permanent physical \ndamage, and death. Every single person at CDF faces a risk of death or serious harm as a result.   \nCLASS DEFINITION \n  This federal class action seeks to require Defendants to implement procedures that keep \nPlaintiffs reasonably safe from contracting communicable disease while in custody and provide \nreasonable medical care for those who do contract the virus. Moreover, due to age or pre-existing \nmedical conditions, some people are so vulnerable to COVID-19 that no adequate policies and \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 19-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 10 of 29\nprocedures could be implemented quickly enough to protect them. These people, as a subclass \n(the “Medically Vulnerable Subclass”), seek a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241.  \n  Plaintiffs, therefore, seek to certify two classes with one subclass, as follows: \n  The Pretrial Class is defined as “all people detained in the Chesapeake Detention Facility \nwho are not detained pursuant to a judgment of conviction.”1  \no  The Medically Vulnerable Subclass is defined as “all Pretrial Class members \nwhose medical condition renders them especially vulnerable to the coronavirus as \ndetermined by guidelines promulgated by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention.”2, 3 \n  The Post-Conviction Class is defined as “all people detained in the Chesapeake Detention \nFacility who are detained pursuant to a judgment of conviction.”4 \n  Named Plaintiffs Sedric Catchings, Charles Couser, Collin Davis, Allen Lamin, Sirron \nLittle, Taiwo Moultrie, and Joseph Speed represent the Pretrial Class.5 ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 28-33.6 \nNamed Plaintiffs Sedric Catchings, Collin Davis, Sirron Little, Taiwo Moultrie, and Joseph \nSpeed  represent  the  Medically  Vulnerable  Subclass.  Id.  ¶¶  28,  30,  32-34.  Named  Plaintiff \nHoward Thomas represents the Post-Conviction Class. Id. ¶ 35.7   \n \n \n                                                 \n1   This definition is intended to include individuals who will be detained in the future as well.  \n2   See, e.g., U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, People Who Are At Higher Risk and Other \nPeople Who Need to Take Extra Precautions (last reviewed Feb. 21, 2021), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html. \n3   See supra n.1. \n4   See supra n.1. \n5   For ease of reference, exhibits filed with the complaint are hereinafter referred to by ECF number. \n6   For ease of reference, exhibits filed with the Complaint are hereinafter referred to by ECF number. A \ncomplete list of exhibits has been filed together with this brief in accordance with LR 105(5). \n7   Named Plaintiff Joseph Speed is detained pending sentencing. ECF No. 1 ¶ 34. When sentenced, he will \nmove into the proposed Post-Conviction Class. \n2 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 19-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 11 of 29\nBACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs’  suit  for  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  under  the  Eighth  and  Fifth  / \nFourteenth Amendments, as well as the Medically Vulnerable Subclass’s petition for habeas \ncorpus, arise from Defendants’ failure to protect them from the severe risk of death or serious \nphysical harm and their deliberate indifference to those threats to their health and safety.  \nThe facts of this case are described at length in Plaintiffs’ Complaint and briefing in \nsupport of the Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction. Simply put, \nthere is an uncontrolled COVID-198 outbreak at CDF, where, according to Defendants’ own \nstatistics, one-third of current residents and approximately one-third of staff members have \ntested positive for COVID-19 in the last month.9 The issues being faced by the proposed Classes \nand Subclass are unacceptable. CDF does not sanitize cells when moving a COVID-positive \nresident out. CDF does not ensure that COVID-positive residents are moved prior to other \nresidents entering a unit. CDF violates U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) \nguideline after guideline. Cleaning materials are in short supply; residents cannot meaningfully \nsanitize masks; CDF does not enforce social distancing or masking; some residents do not even \nhave running water in their cells.10 \nNamed Plaintiffs and putative class members are already in danger. During this most \nrecent outbreak in January and February, two of the Named Plaintiffs have contracted COVID \nfor the second time. Many Plaintiffs have preexisting conditions that make them especially \n                                                 \n8   Severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  coronavirus  2,  or  SARS-CoV-2,  commonly  called  the  “novel \ncoronavirus” or “coronavirus,” is the highly contagious and transmissible virus underlying this cause of action and \nthe events described in the Complaint. The virus frequently results in a disease, COVID-19. Plaintiffs refer to both \nthe virus and disease as “COVID” or “COVID-19.” \n9   ECF No. 1-27 (Expert Declaration of Dr. Jaimie Meyer (February 18, 2021) (“Meyer Decl.”) ¶ 26 (relying \non publicly reported statistics from CDF)); COVID-19 Case Count, Maryland Department of Public Safety and \nCorrections Services, https://news.maryland.gov/dpscs/covid-19/ (last visited on Feb. 15, 2021) (showing 169 \npositive residents, out of approximately 400, and 80 positive staff, out of approximately 220). \n10   ECF Nos. 1-2 through 1-15 (Resident Declarations). \n3 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 19-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 12 of 29\nvulnerable to severe illness and death.11 CDF has shown an inability to protect against the spread \nof COVID and inability to properly treat COVID-positive residents and an intentional difference \nto their health and safety. Named Plaintiffs—along with approximately 400 other prisoners—are \ntrapped in a detention facility that endangers the sick. Absent this Court’s intervention to protect \nthe Classes and Subclass, many will suffer; some will die. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe claims of the Classes and Subclass are suited to proceed as a class action under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).12 In the Fourth Circuit, the procedure and analysis for \ncertifying class action habeas petitions is the same as any other class action. See Diaz v. Hott, \n297 F. Supp. 3d 618, 628 (E.D. Va. 2018) (certifying class action habeas petition), aff’d sub nom. \nGuzman Chavez v. Hott, 940 F.3d 867 (4th Cir. 2019).13 Thus, to certify a class, each of the \nrequirements of Rule 23 must be met. \nPlaintiffs here satisfy Rule 23 because: (a) every member of the Classes and Subclass \nhave the same legal theory as to why their federal rights are being violated; (b) CDF’s failure to \n                                                 \n11   ECF Nos. 1-2 through 1-15 (Resident Declarations). \n12Although the Supreme Court has not squarely decided whether Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure “is \napplicable to petitions for habeas corpus relief,” on several occasions the Court has decided class action habeas \npetitions. Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S. 253, 261 n.10 (1984) (declining to address the issue and accepting district \ncourt’s  certification  of  the  class;  reversing  lower  courts’  holding  that  preventive  detention  of  juveniles  was \nunconstitutional); but see Middendorf v. Henry, 425 U.S. 25, 30 (1976) (declining to decide whether class action \nhabeas petitions are cognizable; refusing to grant relief).  \n13 Some other circuits have adopted “a representative procedure analogous to the class action provided for in Rule \n23.” Bijeol v. Benson, 513 F.2d 965, 968 (7th Cir. 1975) (holding that such a procedure “may be appropriate in a \nhabeas corpus action under some circumstances.”). The Fourth Circuit, in keeping with the practices of the Second, \nEighth, and Ninth Circuits, simply applies the procedure of Rule 23. See also Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, \n1117 (9th Cir. 2010) (“the Ninth Circuit has recognized that class actions may be brought pursuant to habeas \ncorpus.”) (citing Cox v. McCarthy, 829 F.2d 800, 804 (9th Cir.1987)); Williams v. Richardson, 481 F.2d 358, 361 \n(8th Cir. 1973) (“[U]nder certain circumstances a class action provides an appropriate procedure to resolve the \nclaims of a group of petitioners and avoid unnecessary duplication of judicial efforts in considering multiple \npetitions, holding multiple hearings, and writing multiple opinions.”); Inmates of Attica Corr. Facility v. Rockefeller, \n453 F.2d 12, 24 (2d Cir. 1971) (finding a class action habeas “properly maintainable” when the Rule 23 factors are \nmet); Adderly v. Wainwright, 58 F.R.D. 389, 400 (M.D. Fla. 1972) (holding that a petition for a writ of habeas \ncorpus can be brought as a class action). See also discussion infra at pp. 6-7 (listing federal courts that have granted \nclass-wide relief in habeas cases related to COVID). \n4 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 19-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 13 of 29\ntake  reasonable  measures  to  protect  them  violates  the  rights  of  every  Class  and  Subclass \nmember; (c) every Class and Subclass member will use similar or overlapping evidence in \nsupport of his or her cause of action; and (d) every Class and Subclass member seeks a uniform \ninjunction or writ of habeas corpus requiring Defendants to take immediate action to protect \nthem from a grave risk of death or harm. In other words, each representative shares all legal \nclaims with the Class or Subclass the representative seeks to represent, each Class or Subclass’s \nevidence will be identical in support of those claims, and the representatives seek the same relief \nas the Class or Subclass they seek to represent. \nIn addition to commonality, the Classes and Subclass satisfy the other requirements of \nRule 23(a), as well as the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2). Joinder is impracticable because the \nnumber of people in the CDF’s custody exceeds hundreds of people on any given day, and the \nSubclass  also  likely  contains  tens,  if  not  hundreds,  of  people.14  The  claims  of  the  named \nPlaintiffs are typical of those of the class as a whole. That typicality stems from their claim that \nCDF has placed them at significant risk of harm by failing to take appropriate steps to address \nthe risk of COVID-19. Named Plaintiffs have no conflicts with the unnamed members of the \nproposed  classes.  Their  lawyers  are  experienced  in  federal-court  civil-rights  class  actions, \nparticularly those involving prisons and jails. Thus, named Plaintiffs and their counsel will \nadequately represent the interests of the proposed Classes and Subclass. Finally, Defendants have \nrefused to act to address the COVID-19 health crisis at CDF in a manner that applies generally to \n                                                 \n14   See ECF No. 1 ¶ 212 (“A sizeable percentage of the jail population is likely medically vulnerable to \nCOVID.”). According to one study, “asthma prevalence is 30%-60% higher among individuals with a history of \nincarceration as compared with the general population.” Elizabeth M. Viglianti et al., Mass Incarceration and \nPulmonary Health: Guidance for Clinicians, 15 Ann. Am. Thoracic Soc. 409, 410 (2018). Another study estimates \nthat up to 15% of people who are in custody have asthma, 10% of people in custody live with a heart condition that \nrequires medical care, 10% live with diabetes, and 30% have hypertension. See Laura Maruschak, et al., Medical \nProblems of State and Federal Prisoners and Jail Inmates, 2011-12, U.S. Dept. of Justice, 3 (2014).

Hott. \nFederal courts around the country, including this Court, have granted class relief in \nsimilar or identical circumstances. See, e.g., Coreas v. Bounds, 458 F. Supp. 3d 352, 362 (D.

Cal. 2020) (granting provisional class \ncertification and temporary restraining order for immigration detainees). \nARGUMENT \nFor  a  district  court  to  certify  a  class  action,  the  proposed  class  must  satisfy  the \nnumerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a) and at least one \nrequirement of Rule 23(b). Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a)-(b); Berry v. Schulman, 807 F.3d 600, 608 (4th \nCir. 2015); Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1017 (7th Cir. 1992). Because the proposed \nClasses  and  Subclass  meet  all  four  Rule  23(a)  requirements  and  the  requirements  of  Rule \n23(b)(2), this Court should certify Plaintiffs’ proposed Classes. Rule 23(c)(5) further allows for a \nclass to be divided into subclasses, where the subclasses are treated as a class under Rule 23. \nFed.  R.  Civ.  P.  13(c)(5).  As  demonstrated  below,  each  subclass  additionally  meets  all \nrequirements of Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b) and this Court should similarly certify Plaintiffs’ \nproposed subclass.  \nClass certification is particularly favored when, as here, the named plaintiffs assert civil \nrights claims that are transitory in nature, such that mootness concerns would make it difficult or \nimpossible  for  individuals  to  litigate  the  issues  outside  of  the  class  context.  See  Gratz  v. \nBollinger,  539  U.S.  244,  268  (2003)  (noting  that  class-action  treatment  was  “particularly \nimportant” in a case where the claims of the individual plaintiffs ran “the risk of becoming moot” \nbecause “[t]he class action vehicle . . . provides a mechanism for ensuring that a justiciable claim \nis before the Court”) (quotation marks and citation omitted)). Indeed, class-action treatment is \nfavorable here given the varying, but, for many, relatively brief period of detention in facilities \n7 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 19-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 16 of 29\nthat primarily house individuals who are pretrial in their criminal cases.15 See, e.g., Hiatt v. Cty. \nof Adams, Ohio, 155 F.R.D. 605, 608-09 (S.D. Ohio 1994) (explaining that given the “short term \nnature of incarceration in a county jail,” a class should be certified when it is the “only vehicle \nwhereby the legality of [a jail’s] operation . . . can be reviewed”). \nIndeed, on February 19, 2021, in declining to address some of the alleged constitutional \nviolations outlined in this lawsuit, this Court held that arguments about the conditions of CDF \nwere more properly raised in a class-action civil-rights or habeas suit instead of a bond-review \nmotion, for many of the reasons described in this memorandum: \nMany of the arguments [about CDF’s conditions] raised by Defendant . . . assert \npotential  constitutional  violations  relating  more  broadly  to  conditions  of \nconfinement that presumably are common to all detainees at CDF . . . . [S]uch \narguments are better suited to a civil rights lawsuit or perhaps a habeas petition \nrather  than  a  detention  hearing  for  several  reasons.  Most  fundamentally,  the \npresence  of  such  violations  would  prompt  the  Court  to  consider  class-wide \nremedies short of release . . . , yet the parties who could potentially provide such \nremedies—the officials who run the facilities—are not before the Court. . . .  \n \nIn  sum,  remedying  facility-wide  constitutional  grievances  common  to  many \ndetainees  as  alleged  cannot  be  optimally  addressed  in  the  context  of  a  .  .  . \ndetention hearing. \nMemorandum and Order, United States v. Goforth, Case No. 1:20-cr-00319-CCB-1 (D. Md. Feb. \n19, 2021), ECF No. 33.    \n                                                 \n15   The relative brevity of some individual class  members’ detention  supports class certification but  is \nirrelevant to the ongoing danger and irreparable injury Defendants’ conduct is causing Plaintiffs and the class. Class \nmembers can be exposed to and contract COVID even after brief exposure to the appalling conditions at CDF. See \ngenerally ECF No. 1 (Compl.).  \n8 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 19-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 17 of 29\n \nI.  Plaintiffs Satisfy Rule 23(a): They Are Numerous and Raise Common Questions, \nand the Named Plaintiffs Are Adequate Representatives with Typical Claims  \n \nA.  Numerosity is Satisfied: The Class and Subclasses Each Include Hundreds of \nMembers. \n \nFirst,  the  proposed  Classes  and  Subclass  are  sufficiently  numerous  to  make  joinder \nimpracticable. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). In determining whether the numerosity requirement is \nmet, “[n]o specified number is needed to maintain a class action.” Brady v. Thurston Motor \nLines, 726 F.2d 136, 145 (4th Cir. 1984) (citation and quotation omitted). In fact, 18 people can \nbe sufficient. See Cypress v. Newport News Gen. & Nonsectarian Hosp. Ass’n., 375 F.2d 648, \n653 (4th Cir. 1967); see also Rodger v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., 160 F.R.D. 532, 535 (E.D.N.C. \n1995) (“[A] class of as few as twenty-five to thirty members raises a presumption that joinder \nwould be impracticable.”) (citation omitted). \n  Numerosity is easily satisfied here. Nearly 400 residents are detained at CDF. The vast \nmajority are presumptively innocent and held pretrial; the remainder are convicted individuals. \nThe threat posed by COVID-19 is such that every person in CDF’s custody faces the risk of \nsignificant harm. Everyone is at risk of infection. And everyone who is infected is at risk of \nreceiving inadequate medical care that increases the risk of serious illness, long-term permanent \nphysical damage, and death. COVID-19 is therefore potentially lethal for any person in the jail. \nThe proposed Subclass also meets the numerosity threshold. The Medically Vulnerable \nSubclass  is  comprised  of  people  who  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  COVID  because  of \nunderlying medical conditions or age. The CDC has promulgated guidance on the individuals \nwho are most likely to become severely ill, meaning that they require hospitalization, intensive \ncare, use of a ventilator to help them breathe, and/or heightened risk of death. This higher-risk \n9 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 19-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 18 of 29\ngroup includes adults over the age of 65 and people with underlying medical conditions (i.e., \n“medically  vulnerable”  individuals),  including  lung  disease,  heart  disease,  chronic  liver  or \nkidney  disease  (including  hepatitis  and  dialysis  patients),  diabetes,  compromised  immune \nsystems (such as from cancer, HIV, or autoimmune disease), severe obesity, and asthma. All \nsuch people are at elevated risk higher risk for developing more serious complications from \nCOVID-19 illness.16 \nA sizeable percentage of the jail population is likely medically vulnerable to COVID-19. \nAccording to one study, “[a]sthma prevalence is 30%-60% higher among individuals with a \nhistory of incarceration as compared with the general population.”17 Another study estimates that \nup to 15% of people who are in custody have asthma, 10% of people in custody live with a heart \ncondition that requires medical care, 10% live with diabetes, and 30% have hypertension.18 \nBased on these estimates and assuming some overlap in these diagnoses, a fair estimate of the \nnumber of people who live with one or more of these medical vulnerabilities exceeds several \nhundred people.  \nThe classes and subclass are too numerous for joinder to be considered practicable.  \nB.  Commonality  is  Satisfied:  The  Legality  of  Defendant’s  Response  to  the \nPandemic Involves Numerous Common Questions of Fact and Law.  \n \nRule 23(a)(2) requires that “there [be] questions of law or fact common to the class.” Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). Commonality requires that class members’ claims “depend upon a common \ncontention” of facts or law, such that “determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue \n                                                 \n16 See ECF No. 1-29 (Declaration of Dr. Franco-Paredes) (“Franco-Paredes Decl.”) ¶¶ 9-10. \n17 Viglianti et al., supra n. 12 at 410.  \n18  Maruschack, et al., supra n. 12 at 3..  \n \n10 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 19-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 19 of 29\nthat is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.” Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. \nDukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011). \n \nIn other words, the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2) “does not require that all, \nor even most issues be common, nor that common issues predominate, but only that common \nissues exist.” Cent. Wesleyan Coll. v. W.R. Grace & Co., 143 F.R.D. 628, 636 (D.S.C. 1992) \n(citation omitted), aff’d, 6 F.3d 177 (4th Cir. 1993); see also Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 369 (“[E]ven \na single [common] question will do.”) (citation omitted). For this reason, factual differences \namong the claims of putative class members do not defeat certification. Indeed, “Rule 23 does \nnot require precise, mirror-image identity respecting the injuries caused by a single practice or \npolicy  at  a  single  facility.”  Int’l  Woodworkers  of  Am.  AFL-CIO,  CLC  v.  Chesapeake  Bay \nPlywood Corp., 659 F.2d 1259, 1270 (4th Cir. 1981). \n \nRather, commonality requires Plaintiffs to demonstrate that there is “some glue” holding \nthe claims together; that a common question or questions “generate common answers apt to drive \nthe  resolution  of  the  litigation.”  Wal-Mart,  564  U.S.  at  352,  349-50  (quoting  Richard  A. \nNagareda, Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 97, 132 (2009)) \n(emphasis in original). These “common answer[s]” must “relate[] to the actual theory of liability \nin the case.” Rikos v. Procter & Gamble Co., 799 F.3d 497, 505 (6th Cir. 2015). Civil rights \ncases often easily demonstrate commonality because the defendant’s actions are “central to the \nclaims of all class members[,] irrespective of their individual circumstances and the disparate \neffects of the conduct.” Baby Neal ex. rel. Kanter v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 57 (3d Cir. 1994) (citing \n7A Charles A. Wright, et al., Fed. Prac. & Proc. § 1763 at 219 (1986)). \n \nAccordingly, courts in the Fourth Circuit have certified class actions in such cases where \na class of people in pretrial detention sought to challenge the state’s practice of transferring \n11 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 19-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 20 of 29\npretrial detainees from local jails to state institutions, see Epps v. Levine, 457 F. Supp. 561, 563 \n(D. Md. 1978); where a class of people unable to afford the traffic offense-related fines and court \ncosts sought to challenge the state’s practice of revoking their driver’s licenses as a consequence \nof their inability to pay, see Johnson v. Jessup, 381 F. Supp. 3d 619, 637 (M.D.N.C. 2019); and \nin a recent case where a class of immigration detainees sought to challenge the conditions in \nimmigration detention, see Coreas, 2020 WL 5593338, at *7 (D. Md. Sept. 18, 2020) (granting \ncertification of class and subclasses in immigration-detention challenge, noting that “numerous \nfederal courts across the nation have certified, provisionally or otherwise, class actions brought \nby immigration detainees through habeas petitions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic” \n(citing cases)). See also, e.g., Wilson v. Williams, 961 F.3d 829, 832 (6th Cir. 2020) (class-action \nhabeas lawsuit regarding conditions of confinement during COVID-19); Whitted v.

Additionally, many district courts have \nfound that systemic constitutional challenges to prison and jail conditions provide the “glue” \nnecessary to hold a class together.19 \nAs the Supreme Court explained in Wal-Mart, “for purposes of Rule 23(a)(2) ‘[e]ven a \nsingle  [common]  question’  will  do.”  564  U.S.  at  359  (quoting  Richard  A.

L.Rev. 149, 176, n. \n110 (2003)). Here, Plaintiffs allege that all members of the proposed Class are at significant risk \nof contracting a fatal illness due to CDF’s systemic failure to implement policies and practices \nnecessary to protect them. The core questions of law and fact common to the classes and \nsubclass include the following: \na.  Do CDF’s conditions create a substantial risk that the people in its custody will be \ninfected with COVID-19? \nb.  Do CDF’s conditions create a substantial risk that the people in its custody who are \ninfected with COVID-19 will face serious illness, long-term physical damage, or \ndeath? \nc.  Did Defendants know, or should Defendants have known, of these risks? \nd.  Are Defendants acting with deliberate indifference to these risks? \ne.  For the subclass: Is the risk of harm posed by CDF’s conditions so severe and so \nimmediate that the only adequate remedy is release? \nResolving these questions will yield exactly the kind of “common answers” to Plaintiffs’ Eighth \nand Fifth / Fourteenth Amendment claims that the Supreme Court requires.20 See Wal-Mart, 564 \nU.S. at 351. \nAn injunctive challenge to a systemic failure to protect class members from significant \nharm is a textbook example of a case that satisfies the commonality requirement and warrants \nclass certification. Indeed, “this is precisely the type of case for which class certification pursuant \n                                                 \n20  To answer these core questions, the Court will need to consider specific fact questions common to the \nclasses, including: what measures Defendants are taking in response to the spread of COVID-19; whether conditions \nat CDF comply with CDC guidelines; whether Defendant Wilson knew of and disregarded the risk of COVID-19. \nUltimately, the Court will determine the legal question of whether Defendants’ conduct rises to the requisite level of \ndeliberate indifference for a constitutional violation. The answers to these questions will be common to all members \nof the putative classes at issue.  \n13 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 19-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 22 of 29\nto Rule 23(b)(2) was intended.” Scott v. Clarke, 61 F. Supp. 3d 569, 590-91 (W.D. Va. 2014); \nsee Thorn v. Jefferson–Pilot Life Ins. Co., 445 F.3d 311, 330 (4th Cir. 2006). Plaintiffs here \nchallenge Defendant’s systemic failure to respond reasonably to the deadly threat of COVID-19. \nThe commonality requirement is therefore easily met. See Scott, 61 F. Supp. 3d at 590 (W.D. Va. \n2014)  (certifying  a  23(b)(2)  class  where  “Plaintiffs’  amended  pleadings  allege  that  the \nDefendants  have  provided  deficient  medical  care,  or  failed  to  provide  medical  care  under \ncircumstances in which it is plainly warranted and needed, on a systemic basis that jeopardizes \nthe continuing health and well-being of Plaintiffs and all other prisoners residing or who will \nreside at [the prison]”). \nC.  Typicality is Satisfied: The Named Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Representative of \nThose of the Classes and Subclass at Large. \n \nRule 23(a)(3) requires that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical \nof the claims or defenses of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). “The threshold requirements of \n. . . typicality are not high.” Brown v. Nucor Corp., 576 F.3d 149, 153 (4th Cir. 2009) (quoting \nShipes v. Trinity Industries, 987 F.2d 311, 316 (5th Cir. 1993)). Class representatives must “be \npart of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.” \nLienhart v. Dryvit Sys., Inc., 255 F.3d 138, 146 (4th Cir. 2001) (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of \nSouthwest. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982)).  \nUnder the typicality requirement, the Court does not require “members of the class [to] \nhave identical factual and legal claims in all respects.” Broussard v. Meineke Disc. Muffler \nShops, Inc., 155 F.3d 331, 344 (4th Cir. 1998). In this respect, “factual differences will not \nrender a claim atypical,” so long as the class representative’s claim “arises from the same event \nor practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of the class members” and is “based \non the same legal theory.” Casey, 43 F.3d at 58 (citations omitted). In other words, “[t]he \n14 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 19-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 23 of 29\nessence of the typicality requirement is captured by the notion that ‘as goes the claim of the \nnamed plaintiff, so go the claims of the class.’” Deiter v. Microsoft Corp., 436 F.3d 461, 466 (4th \nCir. 2006) (citations omitted). \nIn this case, the claims of the Plaintiffs are typical of the Classes and Subclass that they \nrepresent.  Every  member  of  the  class  faces  a  substantial  risk  of  contracting  COVID-19  if \nimmediate measures are not implemented. Some people, like the medically vulnerable plaintiffs, \nare at imminent risk of death or severe harm if they are not transferred to a safer environment. \nThe overarching nature of the threat of COVID-19 to every person confined in CDF is sufficient \nto satisfy typicality for the two Classes. For the Medically Vulnerable Subclass, each person \nclaims that the person must be released because his health is at imminent and immediate risk \nfrom the same virus and same policy failures as each other person in the subclass. The claims of \nthe representatives are therefore typical of the claims of those they seek to represent.  \nD.  The Named Plaintiffs Will Fairly and Adequately Protect the Interests of the \nClasses and Subclass.  \n \n  Finally, the Named Plaintiffs also meet the final requirement under Rule 23(a): they “will \nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). The adequate \nrepresentation requirement is met where: “1) plaintiff’s interests are [not] antagonistic to the \ninterest of other members of the class[,] and 2) plaintiff’s attorneys are qualified, experienced \nand able to conduct the litigation.” Longo v. Trojan Horse Ltd., 208 F. Supp.3d 700, 711 \n(E.D.N.C. 2016) (quoting Baffa v. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Sec. Corp., 222 F.3d 52, 60 (2d \nCir. 2000)); see also Olvera-Morales v. Int’l Labor Mgmt. Corp. Inc, 246 F.R.D. 250, 258 \n(M.D.N.C. 2007) (“To establish adequacy, ‘the representative must have common interests with \nunnamed members of the class’ and ‘it must appear that the representatives will vigorously \n15 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 19-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 24 of 29\nprosecute the interests of the class through qualified counsel.’”) (quoting In re Am. Med. Sys., \nInc., 75 F.3d 1069, 1083 (6th Cir. 1996)). \n \nIn this case, the Named Plaintiffs do not have interests that conflict with those of the rest \nof the class. To the contrary, as laid out above in the commonality and typicality discussions, the \nNamed Plaintiffs here pursue claims common to the Classes and Subclass as a whole in an effort \nto advance a common interest in ensuring they receive adequate protection from COVID-19. The \ninjunctive relief they seek would benefit the entire class equally. The Named Plaintiffs and their \nfellow Class and Subclass members thus share a common interest and are not conflict with each \nother. \n \nThe Named Plaintiffs also meet the requirement that they will “vigorously prosecute the \ninterests of the class through qualified counsel.” Olvera-Morales, 246 F.R.D at 258. They are \nrepresented here by highly qualified and experienced civil rights attorneys who are able and \nwilling to conduct this litigation on behalf of the class. Plaintiffs’ counsel from the Lawyers’ \nCommittee for Civil Rights Under Law have extensive experience litigating complex class action \ncases and civil rights cases, including cases concerning unconstitutional pretrial systems.

As \ndiscussed in further detail below, infra Part III, Plaintiffs’ counsel are qualified and experienced \ncounsel with a history of zealous advocacy on behalf of their clients.

NCDOC, 276 F.R.D. 452, 457-58 (E.D.N.C. 2011) (“The essential consideration \nis whether the complaint alleges that the plaintiffs have been injured by defendants’ conduct \nwhich is based on policies and practices applicable to the entire class.”) (citation omitted). \n  Courts have repeatedly held that civil-rights class actions are the paradigmatic Rule \n23(b)(2) suits, “for they seek classwide structural relief that would clearly redound equally to the \nbenefit of each class member.” Marcera v. Chinlund, 595 F.2d 1231, 1240 (2d Cir. 1979), \nvacated on other grounds, Lombard v. Marcera, 442 U.S. 915 (1979). As stated in the leading \ntreatise on class actions: \nRule 23(b)(2) was drafted specifically to facilitate relief in civil rights suits. Most \nclass actions in the constitutional and civil rights areas seek primarily declaratory \nand injunctive relief on behalf of the class and therefore readily satisfy Rule \n23(b)(2) class action criteria. \n \nA. Conte & H. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 25.20 (4th ed. 2002). \n  Injunctive challenges to prison and jail conditions routinely proceed as class actions. See, \ne.g., Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 506-08 (2011); Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk Cnty. Jail, 502 U.S. \n367, 374 (1992); Jones ‘El v. Berge, 374 F.3d 541, 543 (7th Cir. 2004); Jones v. Diamond, 519 \nF.2d 1090, 1097 (5th Cir. 1975) (“Realistically, class actions are the only practicable judicial \nmechanism for the cleansing reformation and purification of these penal institutions.”); Casey, \n17 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 19-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 26 of 29\n43 F.3d at 58 (noting that subsection (b)(2) “is almost automatically satisfied in actions primarily \nseeking injunctive relief”); Scott v. Clarke, 61 F. Supp. at 591; Bradley v. Harrelson, 151 F.R.D. \n422, 427 (M.D. Ala. 1993) (stating that subsection (b)(2) “is particularly applicable to suits such \nas the one sub judice which involve conditions of confinement in a correctional institution”). \nHere, high-level officials failing to take reasonable measures to abate the deadly threat posed by \nCOVID-19 places all class members at risk of serious illness or death. Rule 23(b)(2) is satisfied. \nIII.  Undersigned Counsel Should Be Appointed Class Counsel Under Rule 23(g). \n \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(g) requires that the court appoint class counsel for \nany class that is certified. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1). Class counsel must “fairly and adequately \nrepresent the interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(B). In determining whether this \nrequirement is met, courts must consider: (1) “the work counsel has done in identifying or \ninvestigating potential claims in the action;” (2) “counsel’s experience in handling class actions, \nother  complex  litigation,  and  the  types  of  claims  asserted  in  the  action;”  (3)  “counsel’s \nknowledge  of  the  applicable  law;”  and  (4)  “the  resources  that  counsel  will  commit  to \nrepresenting the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A)(i)-(iv). \nUndersigned  Counsel  satisfy  these  four  requirements.  The  Plaintiffs  and  proposed \nClasses are represented by attorneys from the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law \nas well as pro bono counsel from the large international law firm of Bryan Cave Leighton \nPaisner LLP. Counsel has extensive experience litigating complex civil rights matters and class \naction lawsuits in federal court and extensive knowledge of both the conditions in the jail and the \nrelevant constitutional law. Class counsel have conducted an extensive investigation into the \nconditions in CDF and the sanitation and social distancing requirements that are necessary to \nprevent  or  mitigate  an  outbreak  of  COVID-19.  In  addition,  Class  counsel  have  sufficient \n18 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 19-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 27 of 29\nfinancial and human resources to litigate this matter. In sum, Plaintiffs’ attorneys are experienced \nadvocates; possess sufficient “vigor” along with sufficient resources, to adequately represent the \nClasses and Subclass and to prosecute this action; and are appropriate counsel for the matter. See \nKirkpatrick J.C. Bradford & Co., 827 F.2d 718, 726 (11th Cir. 1987) (citations omitted). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court certify the Classes \nand Subclass as defined in this Motion and appoint the undersigned as class counsel.  \nDated: February 22, 2021      Respectfully submitted, \n            (Signatures follow on next page.)  \n19 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 19-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 28 of 29\n   \n/s/ Alec W.

Case No.:  I :21-cv-00428-TSE \n* \nCALVIN WILSON et al., \nDefendants.  * \nAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PLAINTIFFS AND DEFENDANTS \nThe parties agree as follows.  By agreeing to the conditions herein,  Defendants do  not \nconcede or admit to the failure to perform any specified action prior to the date of this agreement. \nDefendants state that much of this agreement is duplicative of prior policies or practices; Plaintiffs \nstate that prior practices or policies did not align with this agreement. \nI.  PRACTI.CES AT THE CHESAPEAKE DETENTION FACILITY AND THE JAIL \nINDUSTRIES BUILDING (\"THE FACILITIES\") \nDefendants shall abide by the following conditions. \nTesting, new admissions, and population size: \nI.  Defendants  (which  includes  both  Defendants  and  their  agents  for  purposes  of this \nagreement) shall test all residents and staff on a weekly basis. \n2.  Defendants shall test all new residents upon admission. \nTreatment of \"high risk\" residents: \n3.  Defendants shall identify \"high risk\" residents upon admission to the facility. \na.  \"High risk\" residents are defined as residents with certain medical conditions and \nolder residents. \nResidents with certain medical conditions are those individuals identified \n1. \nby the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who are, or might be, at \nincreased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, lists ofwhich are available \nat  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/20 19-ncov/need-extra \nprecautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html. \nOlder  residents  are  residents  over the  age  of 65,  whom Maryland  has \n11. \nclassified  as  being  eligible  for  vaccines  111  Phase  I C,  see \nhttps:// covid Ii nk.mary land .gov/content/vacc ine/. \nb.  \"1-1 igh risk\" residents shall  include residents on the \"chronic care list,\" which is \ndefined by Defendants' medical provider. \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 52-1   Filed 03/19/21   Page 2 of 9\nc.

According  to  Defendants’  own  statistics,  one-third  of  current  residents2  (156  of \napproximately 400 residents) and staff members (78 of approximately 220 employees) have \ntested  positive  for  COVID. ECF  No.  1-27  ¶  26,  Expert  Declaration  of  Dr.  Jaimie  Meyer \n(February 18, 2021) (“ECF No. 1-27”); COVID-19 Updates, Maryland Department of Public \nSafety and Corrections Services, https://news.maryland.gov/dpscs/covid-19/) (last visited Feb. \n21, 2021) (reflecting higher number since Dr. Meyer’s review). \nThis outbreak, and CDF’s failure to plan for and respond to it, is unconscionable. The \nnation is now nearly a year into the COVID-19 pandemic. Since March 2020, the CDC has \npromulgated, and then periodically updated, science-based guidelines and procedures designed to \nprevent the very type of uncontrolled COVID outbreak within jails and prisons that is now \nendangering the lives of hundreds of CDF residents. Id. ¶ 7; see also ECF No. 1-25, (Interim \nGuidance  on  Management  of  Coronavirus  Disease  2019  (COVID-19)  in  Correctional  and \nDetention  Facilities  (updated  Dec.  31,  2020)),  available  online  at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-\ncorrectional-detention.html. CDF has failed to implement the most basic of measures to protect \nresidents and staff alike from COVID. ECF No. 1-27 ¶¶ 24-40. \nMeanwhile,  when  residents  test  positive,  meanwhile,  some  are  sent  to  a  warehouse \nsetting—the Jail Industries, or “JI,” Building—down the street from CDF with broken-out or \ndrafty windows and a temperature near 55 degrees. Res. Decl. A, B, F (see ECF Nos. 1-2, 1-3, 1-\n1 Severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  coronavirus  2,  or  SARS-CoV-2,  commonly  called  the  “novel \ncoronavirus” or “coronavirus,” is the highly contagious and transmissible virus underlying this cause of action and \nthe events described in the Complaint. The virus frequently results in a disease, COVID-19. Plaintiffs refer to both \nthe virus and disease as “COVID” or “COVID-19.” \n2 Plaintiffs use the term “residents” to refer to individuals detained at CDF and other facilities. \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 9 of 44\n7).3 There, COVID-positive residents are stripped of their belongings and given paper shorts and \na t-shirt to wear as they try to recover from their illness. ECF No. 1-2. To state the obvious, this \nis nothing close to the sort of environment suitable for recovery from COVID. \nCDF’s failures are legion. CDF does not sanitize cells when moving a COVID-positive \nresident out. CDF does not ensure that COVID-positive residents are moved prior to other \nresidents entering a unit. E.g., ECF No. 1-4. CDF violates CDC guideline upon guideline. \nCleaning materials are in short supply, e.g., ECF No. 1-2; residents cannot sanitize masks, e.g., \nECF No. 1-3; CDF does not enforce social distancing or masking, e.g., ECF Nos. 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, \n1-6; and some residents lack running water in their cells in order to maintain even a semblance of \npersonal hygiene, e.g., ECF No. 1-14. Staff reports confirm residents’ accounts. ECF No. 1-20 \n(Tim Prudente & Phillip Jackson, Outbreak of COVID-19 at Baltimore federal jail prompts \nlockdown even as feds prepare to resume grand jury proceedings, Baltimore Sun, Feb. 3, 2020). \nNamed  Plaintiffs  and  putative  class  members  are  currently  and  constantly  in  grave \ndanger. CDF has demonstrated its inability to protect against the spread of COVID and to \nproperly  treat  COVID-positive  residents.  During  this  most  recent  outbreak  in  January  and \nFebruary, two of the Named Plaintiffs have contracted COVID for the second time. ECF Nos. 1-\n2, 1-9. Many Plaintiffs have preexisting conditions that make them especially vulnerable to \nsevere illness and death. Named Plaintiffs—along with approximately 400 other prisoners—are \ntrapped in a detention facility that endangers the sick. Absent this Court’s intervention, many \nwill suffer; some will die. \nTroublingly, CDF has indicated that it intends on again resuming new admissions to the \nfacility by the middle of the week of February 21. ECF No. 1-26. \n3\nFor ease of reference, exhibits filed with the Complaint are hereinafter referred to by ECF number. A complete list \nof exhibits has been filed together with this brief in accordance with LR 105(5). \n2 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 10 of 44\n“[I]ndividuals placed at CDF are at a significantly higher risk of infection with COVID-\n19 as compared to the population in the community and that they are at a significantly higher risk \nof harm if they do become infected.” ECF No. 1-27 ¶ 41. “Future outbreaks will happen at CDF \nwithout additional measures.” Id. ¶ 42. \nThese conditions violate the named Plaintiffs’ and putative class members’ rights under \nthe Eighth and Fifth / Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiffs thus seek \nemergency relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to bring CDF’s conditions in line with basic public \nhealth  standards.  In  addition,  a  putative  subclass  of  medically  vulnerable  prisoners  (the \n“Medically Vulnerable Subclass”) seeks release under 28 U.S.C. § 2241. \nFederal  courts  across  the  country,  including  this  Court,  have  granted  temporary \nrestraining  orders  and  preliminary  injunctions  in  situations  similar  to,  or  even  less  life-\nthreatening, than this.

\nb) An order placing a temporary pause on new admissions to CDF; \nc) An  order  that  CDF  implement  and  document  appropriate  cohorting,  including \nquarantining and medical isolation procedures, as recommended by CDC guidelines and \nin accordance with testing results, including for new admission (if CDF continues to take \nnew admissions); \n5 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 13 of 44\nd) An order that CDF clean and disinfect frequently-touched surfaces in common areas \nseveral times per day, including phones; \ne) An order that CDF provide appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to residents \nand  CDF  staff  according  to  the  CDC’s  recommendations,  and  receive  appropriate \ninstruction about how to wear and clean it; \nf) An order that CDF ensure each resident receives, free of charge: (1) an individual supply \nof liquid hand soap and paper towels sufficient to allow frequent hand washing and \ndrying  each  day;  (2)  tissues;  and  (3)  adequate  access  to  a  supply  of  cleaning  and \ndisinfectant  products  effective  against  COVID  to  allow  for  cleanings  of  frequently-\ntouched surfaces several times per day;

\nh) To the extent a resident must enter lockdown or isolation to effectuate an appropriate \nquarantine or medical isolation procedure, an order that CDF provide appropriate mental \nhealth services, and, if that resident has a mental health condition, provide enhanced \npsychological services in these circumstances; \ni) An order that CDF provide a list of all medically vulnerable residents (as defined by \nCDC  Guidelines)  as  well  as  all  residents  eligible  for  vaccination  (as  defined  by \nMaryland’s vaccine phases) to Plaintiffs’ counsel and the Court within 24 hours; \nj) An order that CDF immediately create and implement a plan that complies with CDC \nGuidance to minimize transmission to and provide adequate medical monitoring and care \nto residents who are medically vulnerable to COVID; \nk) An order that CDF ensure that isolation, cohorted isolation, and quarantine cells are clean \nand sanitary, and that residents in them receive adequate medical monitoring, adequate \nhygiene  products,  reading  material,  reasonable  access  to  phones,  a  daily  change  of \nclothes, and the opportunity to shower once daily, along with production of records \nshowing CDF’s efforts on these fronts to the Court;

\no) An order that CDF ensure that residents have adequate access to phones to contact \ncounsel and/or family members such that residents need not congregate at the phones; \np) An order that CDF end preemptive lockdown procedures and instead impose appropriate \ntime-limited quarantines, with that time limit clearly communicated to residents, only \nwhen necessary due to a known or suspected case of COVID, as recommended by \nmedical and public health professionals; \nq) An order that CDF offer appropriate mental health services to all residents; \nr) To the extent it is necessary to ensure constitutionally sufficient procedures or to protect \ncertain  residents’  constitutional  rights,  order  CDF  to  transfer  residents  to  another \nappropriate facility; \ns) An order that Defendants immediately offer vaccinations to all members of the Medically \nVulnerable Subclass who qualify as “high risk,” as defined by Maryland guidance;4\nt) An order that CDF immediately release, pursuant to a writ or writs of habeas corpus, \nmembers of the Medically Vulnerable Subclass; \nu) If  this  Court  does  not  immediately  release  the  Medically  Vulnerable  Subclass,  a \nconsideration of these subclass members for release on non-monetary bond pending the \noutcome of their request for habeas relief; and \nv) Any other relief necessary to protect the constitutional rights of the residents of CDF and \nany other relief that the Court deems appropriate. \n4 Currently,  Maryland’s  vaccination  phase  includes  “high  risk”  residents  of  jails  and  prisons.  See\nhttps://coronavirus.maryland.gov/pages/vaccine. \n7 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 15 of 44\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nPlaintiffs Sedric Catchings, Charles Couser, Collin Davis, Allen Lamin, Sirron Little, \nTaiwo Moultrie, and Howard Thomas are all detained pretrial at CDF. ECF Nos. 1-2 to 1-9, ECF \nNos. 1-11 to 1-13. Plaintiff Howard Thomas is detained CDF post-sentencing. ECF No. 1-15. Of \nthese residents, Mr. Catchings, Mr. Davis, Mr. Little, Mr. Moultrie, Mr. Speed, and Mr. Thomas \nall have preexisting conditions that render them more vulnerable to COVID. See ECF Nos. 1-11, \n1-12, 1-13, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 1-15. \nCOVID Is Highly Infectious and Dangerous \nCOVID  is  a  highly  infectious  and  dangerous  disease.  As  recounted  by  Drs.  Carlos \nFranco-Paredes and Dr. Jaimie Meyer, COVID can lead to catastrophic consequences, including \nlifelong medical problems or death. See ECF No. 1-28 ¶¶ 8-12, Expert Declaration of Carlos \nFranco-Paredes, M.D., M.P.H. (February 15, 2021) (“ECF No. 1-28”) ¶¶ 7-19. \nJails and Prisons Are Exceedingly Vulnerable to COVID Spread \nJails and prisons create a unique risk of spread and catastrophic consequences, requiring a \nconcerted and deliberate effort to protect against COVID. ECF No. 1-28 ¶¶ 13-23; ECF No. 1-27 \n¶¶ 20-27. By all medical and public health standards, however, CDF has failed miserably in \nimplementing and executing the most basic of guidelines to protect against COVID, including \nthose promulgated by the CDC. ECF No. 1-28 ¶¶ 13-23; ECF No. 1-27 ¶¶ 24-49. \nLockdowns are an Inappropriate Response to COVID \nDr. Meyer and Dr. Craig Haney have explained at length the inappropriateness of large-\nscale lockdowns in response to infectious diseases. See ECF No. 1-27 ¶ 18; ECF No. 1-29 \n(February 18, 2021 Expert Declaration of Dr. Craig Haney) ¶¶ 14-29. As Dr. Haney explains, \nprocedures  that  impose  extended  periods  of  isolation  or  restrict  hygiene  options  (such  as \nshowers) are inappropriate, ill-conceived, and counter-productive. In fact, they could very likely \n8 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 16 of 44\nexacerbate rather than limit or alleviate the spread of COVID-19. According to Dr. Haney, \ninstead of preemptive lockdowns, jails and prisons should institute such lockdowns only where \nmedically necessary to resolve discrete issues, such as sanitizing dorms or contact tracing of an \ninfected prisoner. If such lockdowns are employed, for these limited purposes, they should be \nreasonably time-limited. Staff also should communicate that time-limit to the affected prisoners. \nId. ¶ 26.5\nDefendants Have Been Given Multiple Warnings of the Dangers of Not Responding \nSwiftly and Appropriately \nDefendants are well-aware of the dangers in not planning and responding to COVID \nappropriately. Defendants have themselves reported the consequences of these failures, in CDF’s \ndramatically high levels of infection. ECF No. 1-27 ¶¶ 26-27 (relying on publicly reported \nstatistics from CDF). Defendants are also well-aware of CDC guidelines, but have chosen not to \nexecute on those policies. See id. ¶ 26. \nThe Warden himself is personally aware of the circumstances on the ground at CDF. ECF \nNo. 1-11. (“On Tuesday, February 2, they came to pack up the negative people to send back to \nthe E unit, where I started quarantine when I got to CDF. The people who were negative were \nmoved. The warden was there when they were moving us. I asked to use the phone to talk to my \nlawyer to talk about the situation. He told me no.”). \nDPSCS and CDF Have Wildly Mishandled the COVID Pandemic and Thereby \nCaused a COVID Disaster Within the Facility \na. CDF’s Failure to Plan for Introduction of Virus to the Facility \nAlthough  the  pandemic  has  been  ongoing  since  March  2020,  and  in  spite  of  clear \nevidence that the risk posed by infectious diseases in jails and prisons is significantly higher than \n5 For a more detailed discussion of the reasons that lockdown are inappropriate, see ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 71-78. \n9 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 17 of 44\nin the community, CDF has utterly failed to create a comprehensive approach—with plans for \ndifferent scenarios—to handle an increase in positive cases among the resident population. See \nECF No. 1-27 ¶¶ 13, 25, 27. As Dr. Meyer recounts, “It is also my professional judgment that \nthis outbreak was preventable. This outbreak reflects CDF did not appropriately prepare or plan \nfor  this  situation.  CDF  has  demonstrated  that  it  is  unable  to  handle  the  current  situation. \nProblems in implementing basic disease prevention and management strategies have persisted \neven after the outbreak in mid-January 2021. . . . Future outbreaks will happen at CDF without \nadditional measures.” Id. ¶ 42. \nThis lack of planning has resulted in intermixing between different groups of residents. \nAs described by Dr. Meyer, and as recounted by multiple residents, COVID-negative residents \nhave been forced into living quarters with COVID-positive residents. Id. ¶ 27; see e.g., ECF No. \n1-6 (“One of those two guys said, ‘Be careful, I have COVID.’ I asked what cell he was in. He \nsaid he was from cell 32. . . . They put me into cell 32 right after those two guys left. Nobody \ncleaned it out before they put me in the cell. Nobody cleaned it or sprayed it or anything. I \ncouldn’t believe they were trying to put me in this cell.”). \nb. CDF Mismanagement in 2020 \nCDF’s reckless treatment of residents long predates the 2021 outbreak, and indeed dates \nback to the beginning of the pandemic. In 2020, CDF housed COVID-positive residents in cells \nalongside COVID-negative residents in the intake unit. ECF No. 1-5 (“[T]wo other new guys \ncame into intake. These two guys were in the same cell together. After two days or so, COs took \none of the guys out the intake unit. That guy was saying that he felt sick. I never saw that guy \ncome back. CDF did not make me quarantine or isolate after that second man was removed from \nthe intake unit. Nobody checked my temperature until five days after the second guy was taken \nout. Nobody asked me if I had any symptoms.”). Upon removal of the COVID-positive residents, \n10 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 18 of 44\nCDF not only failed to quarantine or test the residents who had been exposed to the virus; for \nseveral days, the facility did not even bother to take the temperatures of residents who were \nexposed. Id. In 2020, two CDF residents in a unit within the facility who experienced symptoms \nwere tested for COVID. After these individuals tested positive, they were permitted to use the \nshared telephones, during normal recreation time, while non-symptomatic residents who had not \nbeen tested for COVID were out of their cells, before being removed from the unit. Id.\nCDF also failed to clean or sanitize the telephones or other surfaces these COVID-\npositive residents touched after receiving positive test results. Id. DF staff likewise failed to \nprovide soap to exposed residents, even when residents requested soap. Id. \nc. Moving into 2021: Intermixing Among Cohorts and Other Individuals \nOne of CDF’s biggest failings since this outbreak began is in its evident inability or \nunwillingness to separate residents into different groups and to reduce the risk of spreading \nCOVID. This process is called “cohorting.” As described by Dr. Meyer, effective cohorting \ninvolves separating people into four homogenous groups based on their known disease status: (1) \nIntake  quarantine,  (2)  Medical  isolation,  (3)  Post-exposure  quarantine,  and  (4)  General \npopulation. ECF No. 1-27 ¶ 27(l). \nBut from 2020 and continuing to the present, CDF has—in direct contravention of best \npractices and scientific guidance—facilitated and encouraged the intermixing of cohorts. \nResidents who have not tested positive have been forced into the uncleaned cells of \nresidents who tested positive. E.g., ECF No. 1-4. One resident was forced to remain locked in his \ncell with his symptomatic cellmate, who “had basically every symptom of COVID.” ECF No. 1-\n13. Another resident was left in a cell with his cellmate for two full days after the cellmate had \ntested positive. ECF No. 1-6. This resident was then moved to another unit in the facility, where \nhe crossed paths with another resident who warned he had also tested positive for COVID. The \n11 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 19 of 44\nresident was placed in the positive individual’s cell immediately. The cell was not cleaned, nor \nwas the resident given any materials to clean the cell himself. Id.\nStaff reports corroborate resident reports. According to one corrections officer, “It was \nmass movement [February 3]. People were just walking around regularly.” ECF No. 1-20 at 4. \nThe more recent failures at CDF are also the most striking. On February 12, 2021, CDF \nmoved a female resident to the “cadre,” which housed only males at the time. ECF No. 1-11. The \nwoman was brand new to the facility, and at least one resident in the “cadre” had already tested \npositive for COVID. Beyond her potential risk of exposure to COVID, her placement in a male \nunit is inappropriate for health and safety protocols in a jail. ECF No. 1-27 ¶ 27(l). \nThis  failure—placing  a  new  admit  around  COVID-positive  individuals—is  not  an \nisolated incident. CDF did the same exact thing in early 2021, placing a new admission, also a \nwoman, into the “cadre.” ECF No. 1-14. A few days later, CDF moved multiple positive male\nresidents into the unit. These positive residents were clearly symptomatic, with one “coughing a \nlot.” Id. As this woman recounted: “I asked the guards why a male was in my unit. That didn’t \nmake sense to me. That made me feel anxious and very uncomfortable. The guards said there \nwas nothing they could do. I told them I could hear that he was sick. They told me not to worry. I \ncould hear him talking to his family members and saying that the reason he was in the ‘cadre’ \nwas because he was having symptoms of COVID and that he had to be in that unit for 14 days. \nHis cell was right next to mine—there was just a wall in between us.” Id.\nCDF ignored her pleas for human decency and continued its approach into February \n2021. \nCDF has also conceded its failure to track and record the movement of various residents \naround the facility. CDF’s “‘Dash Board’ record[,] which contains daily statistical information \n12 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 20 of 44\nfor the facility[,] . . . has been historically unreliable . . . .” ECF No. 1-26 (e-mail from Sean \nWolcoff  of  the  U.S.  Marshals  Service  dated  February  18,  2021,  entitled  “Today’s  DPSCS \nMeeting Notes”) (emphasis added). \nDespite its failings, CDF has indicated that it intends on again resuming admissions by \nthe middle of the week of February 21. ECF No. 1-26 (“CDF had originally planned to accept \nnew prisoner intakes by Wednesday 2/24/21, but Warden Wilson is now dubious of that since \nyesterday’s Airlift was cancelled due to weather.”). \nd. Failure to Contact Trace \nCDF has also failed to meaningfully contact trace, often neglecting to ask residents \nexposed to positive residents whether they experienced any symptoms—let alone quarantine \nthem from other residents. ECF No. 1-27 ¶ 27(d); see also, e.g., ECF No. 1-5 (“CDF did not \nmake me quarantine or isolate after that man was removed from the unit. Nobody checked my \ntemperature,  or  asked  me  if  I  had  any  symptoms.”);  ECF  No.  1-6.  These  problems  are \npresumably exacerbated by CDF’s failure to meaningfully track the movement of residents. See \nECF No. 1-22. \nCDF  also  ignored  symptomatic  residents  and  trace  individuals  with  whom  those \nsymptomatic residents had come into contact. ECF No. 1-3 (“At CDF, I heard guys coughing \npretty frequently. That was happening in December. They didn’t get tested until 2021. I was \naround those guys who were coughing. COs didn’t come around and ask if we had symptoms. \nCOs were treating us like we were all positive.”) \ne. Cleaning Deficiencies \nAccording to Dr. Meyer, until vaccination of the majority is achieved, required COVID \nprevention strategies must include containment procedures, like cleaning. ECF No. 1-27 ¶ 12. \n13 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 21 of 44\nBut the facility has failed to provide essential personal hygiene products to residents, and \nhas even restricted residents’ access to running water for handwashing. ECF Nos. 1-3, 1-5, 1-7. \nOne resident recounts that even if she wanted to wash her hands in her cell—which CDF staff \nfrequently do not permit residents to do during rec time—she had no ability to do so: “From \nJanuary 12 to February 2, I did not have running water in my cell. I couldn’t wash my hands in \nthe cell. I told the guards. They didn’t do anything.” ECF No. 1-14. CDF has been so abysmal in \nits provision of cleaning supplies that staff report that even they have to bring in their own \ncleaning supplies. ECF No. 1-20. The facility has likewise failed to consistently provide soap to \nresidents free of charge or on a regular basis. ECF Nos. 1-3, 1-5, 1-7, 1-12. Worse, CDF has not \nprovided hand sanitizer in place of soap. See ECF Nos. 1-5, 1-7, 1-9, 1-10, 1-11. Meanwhile, \nresidents who request cleaning supplies are either ignored or told no supplies are available. ECF \nNos. 1-2, 1-3, 1-4. Likewise, surfaces in common areas are not cleaned between recreation shifts. \nECF Nos. 1-2, 1-3, 1-9. \nIn  the  nightmarish  environment  of  the  “cadre”—where  CDF  mixes  newly  admitted \nfemale residents with COVID-positive, symptomatic male residents—CDF does nothing to clean \ncommon areas after confirmed positive residents mill about and touch surfaces. As one female \nresident explained:  “On January 8, a male detainee came into the ‘cadre’ unit. He was coughing \na lot . . . . The guards said there was nothing they could do. . . . Every time the guy used the \nphone, he didn’t wipe down the phone. . . . After those four days, another guy came into the \n‘cadre.’ This other guy was put on the other side of me. So I had a male detainee on both sides of \nme. This new guy was sick too. I could hear him coughing too. Then they put another guy on G6, \ntwo cells away. They then put another guy on G5, three cells away. These other two guys had \n14 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 22 of 44\nsymptoms too. . . . CDF staff never cleaned or sanitized any of the common areas on the \n‘cadre.’” ECF No. 1-14. \nSimilarly,  the  facility  has  not  only  failed  to  clean  cells  after  positive  residents  are \nrelocated, CDF staff have outright denied residents—forced to move into those contaminated \ncells—access to cleaning supplies so that the residents can try to disinfect the space on their own. \nECF No. 1-4. \nf. Failure to Provide Masks or Enforce Social Distancing \nAccording  to  public  health  experts,  the  COVID  pandemic  requires  proactive  social \ndistancing measures in correctional facilities to reduce the risk of transmission and death due to \nCOVID within facilities. ECF No. 1-28 ¶ 43. CDF has not only failed to proactively adopt social \ndistancing; the facility has neither required nor enforced any degree of social distancing among \nresidents. CDF officers do not even attempt to encourage or enforce distancing among residents. \nECF Nos. 1-2, 1-3, 1-5, 1-7, 1-11. Indeed, in early February, despite the outbreak across the \nfacility, CDF let out around 20 residents to watch the Super Bowl without requiring anyone to \nwear a mask—a reckless decision given the positive numbers at CDF at the time. ECF No. 1-10. \nAccording to Dr. Meyer, a key infection prevention strategy of this droplet-borne disease \nis the widespread use of masks. Masks should be regularly cleaned and sanitized to optimize \ntheir effectiveness. Masks only work to protect people from infection when used and when worn \ncorrectly. ECF No. 1-27 ¶ 30. But CDF fails on this count too. Neither residents nor staff at CDF \nwear masks correctly and consistently. ECF Nos. 1-2, 1-3, 1-5, 1-7. When outside their cells, it is \n“optional” for residents to wear masks. ECF Nos. 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 1-6, 1-8, 1-10. Residents worried \nfor their personal health and safety must try to police the mask-wearing of their fellow residents. \nECF No. 1-11. Further, residents are also not able to clean the masks they do have. Contrary to \nCDF’s claims, many residents have only one mask. E.g., ECF Nos. 1-3, 1-14. To clean these \n15 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 23 of 44\nmasks, residents would have to send them out with laundry, which takes at least a day (leaving \nthe mask owner without protection while its gone) and requires that the mask owner be willing to \nrisk having no mask at all (as laundry is routinely lost). ECF No. 1-3; see also ECF No. 1-27 ¶ \n30(b). \ng. Inhumane Treatment of COVID-Positive Residents \nAs appalling as is CDF’s inexplicable disregard for the risk of COVID exposure and \nspread,  the  facility’s  treatment  of  residents  who  test  positive  for  COVID-19  is  even  more \nunconscionable. Some COVID-positive CDF residents are removed from CDF and sent to the \nJail Industries Building (“JI”). Originally built in 1922 as an office building and retrofitted as a \njail in the 1980s, JI was closed in 2017 due to what public safety officials called a “security \nnightmare.”6 One COVID-positive resident who was recently housed at JI saw a thermostat in \nthe building showing that the temperature was 55 degrees. ECF No. 1-3. This is unsurprising, \ngiven the number of broken or drafty windows at the facility and the fact that January and \nFebruary are two of the coldest months of the year. Id. Worse, Residents at JI are not given \nappropriate clothing to brave the cold. ECF No. 1-2. According to two JI residents, upon their \narrival at JI, they were forced to turn in their clothing in exchange for paper-material hospital \nshorts, a t-shirt, and shower shoes. ECF No. 1-2 (“They gave us paper shorts, like what paper \nmasks are made of. They gave us a short sleeve shirt.”); ECF No. 1-3 (“When they moved me, \nthey took all my clothes. They gave all of us at JI hospital shorts. We got a T-shirt and a pair of \nboxers.”). Cleanliness, too, is unattainable for these COVID-positive JI residents. Not only is the \nfacility itself dirty and not subject to regular cleaning, but the shower facilities are infested with \nflies. ECF No. 1-2. \n6 https://www.wbaltv.com/article/i-team-looks-inside-closing-jail-facility-in-baltimore/12139786 (containing \na video tour of the closed facility). \n16 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 24 of 44\nAccording  to  Dr.  Meyer,  the  primary  manifestation  of  severe  COVID  disease  is \npneumonia, which produces distinct lung sounds that could herald severe disease and reflect \npeople’s subjective reports of shortness of breath. Simply marking down a patient’s vital signs—\neven with oxygen readings—is not sufficient medical care for COVID disease.ECF No. 1-27 ¶ \n35(b). Yet COVID-positive JI residents receive little medical care, despite the fact that they are \nonly in JI because they have contracted a deadly virus. The entirety of the medical care provided \nat JI is the following: residents’ vital signs and temperatures are checked once every five hours. \nECF Nos. 1-2, 1-3. Residents are not asked to report their symptoms. ECF No. 1-2. Nobody \nlistens to the residents’ lungs to be sure they are breathing normally. Id. \nAnd those with preexisting conditions that make COVID notably more dangerous have \neven been denied access to previously approved medical care. According to one of two COVID-\npositive residents who was housed at JI, he went multiple days without his inhaler to treat his \npreexisting condition (one that is exacerbated by COVID)—because he was forced to leave it at \nCDF. ECF No. 1-3 (“I went from Tuesday, February 2, to Saturday, February 6, without my \ninhalers at JI.”) \nh. Other Serious Deficits with Medical Care, including the Failure to Offer \nVaccinations to All Eligible Residents \nCDF does not sufficiently monitor for COVID symptoms in residents. ECF No. 1-3. One \nresident was also given the medication for another resident at CDF—medication that could have \nseriously harmed him had he not resisted the staff’s instructions to take the prescription. ECF \nNo. 1-9 (“That night [February 9], a nurse came by and told me to take my diabetes and \nhypertension medication. [I don’t have diabetes or hypertension.] I told the nurse I wouldn’t take \nthat medication. The nurse came back at around midnight and brought me two Motrin. The nurse \ndidn’t bring me the antibiotics or any wound care. On February 10, the same thing happened--a \n17 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 25 of 44\nnurse came by and gave me medication that she said was for hypertension and diabetes. I called \nout for the captain and explained the situation and showed him my paperwork.”). \nLikewise, CDF does not respond to some sick calls at all. The facility is declining to take \nsome residents to sick calls, and some don’t even have the chance to file sick call requests. ECF \nNos. 1-3, 1-6, 1-8. \nUnder Maryland’s Plan for distribution of COVID vaccine,7 vaccine is supposed to be \navailable for all “high-risk incarcerated individuals” under “Phase 1B” of the Plan. Nonetheless, \nalthough Maryland is  reportedly moving on to vaccinate persons in the general population \neligible under the next phase (“Phase 1C”) of the Plan, there is no indication that all “high-risk \nincarcerated individuals” at CDF are being offered vaccinations.8\ni. Overuse of Solitary Confinement \nDuring COVID-related lockdowns, residents (those who tested negative and positive \nalike) were held in their cells for 24 hours a day, even denied access to showers for multiple \ndays—a confounding restriction, given the necessity of sanitation and hygiene to stop the spread \nof this virus. ECF No. 1-7. One resident recounts that “they didn’t open our cell doors for 25 \nhours. During that time, I had no water to wash my hands or to drink.” ECF No. 1-14. The same \nresident recounts that “We got locked down a second time, and couldn’t leave our cells. The \n7 Maryland Department of Health, Maryland moves into Phase 1C of its COVID-19 vaccine distribution \nplan, opens eligibility to all residents 65 and up (Jan. 25, 2021), \nhttps://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/Maryland-moves-into-Phase-1C-of-its-COVID-19-vaccine-\ndistribution-plan,-opens-eligibility-to-all-residents-65-and-up.aspx. \n8 The Plan does not specifically define the term “high risk individuals” but includes within that category: \n“Persons at highest risk of developing complications from COVID-19 (ACIP high risk conditions), including \npersons 65 and older, staff and residents of nursing homes (SNFs), long-term care facilities (LTCFs), assisted care \nfacilities,  and  clients  of  senior  daycare  facilities  or  similar.” \nhttps://phpa.health.maryland.gov/Documents/10.19.2020_Maryland_COVID-19_Vaccination_Plan_CDCwm.pdf, at \n13 (emphasis added).  It is clear the Plan intends to include at least a portion of the detainees at CDF within Phase 1, \nbecause the Plan goes on to estimate the population to be vaccinated in Maryland under the Plan in Phase 1 as \nincluding approximately 54,460 “people in prisons, jails, detention centers and staff.” Id. at 13. \n18 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 26 of 44\nguard brought me some ice [because my sink in my cell did not function]. He said he wouldn’t \nbring me water. He told me to wait for the ice to melt.” Id.\nOther residents have been held—without explanations or test results—in units where they \nare locked inside their cells for 23 hours a day. ECF Nos. 1-6, 1-7, 1-12 (“(“They locked down \nCDF in late January. They didn’t tell us why. They didn’t tell us they locked down because of \nCOVID.”). And even for those not being held inside their cells for 23 or 24 hours every day, they \nare nonetheless confined to the cells for 20 hours every day. E.g., ECF No. 1-11. \nExplanations for the lockdowns have been absent at best and potentially misleading. One \nresident was told by a member of the U.S. Marshals Service that the “bad conditions” at CDF \n(perhaps lockdown measures) were because of their criminal defense attorneys trying to get them \nout of jail. ECF No. 1-5. Another recounts that CDF staff told residents that the unit was locking \ndown because “there weren’t enough guards to take care of us”—another example of a failure to \nplan on CDF’s part. ECF No. 1-14. \nj. CDF’s Mismanagement has Caused a Massive Outbreak \nCDF’s catastrophic failure to employ even the most basic tenets of virus containment and \nmitigation strategies has led, predictably, to a massive COVID outbreak. As Dr. Meyer recounts, \n“This timeline of explosive growth of the virus, as well as CDF quickly abandoning plans to \nisolate or quarantine in particular areas, demonstrates a failure to plan,” resulting in two residents \ntesting positive for the second time. ECF No. 1-27 ¶ 27(i)-(j) (noting that “[r]e-infections with \nCOVID-19 . . . have been reported to occur outside of those 90 days”). \nThe grave missteps of CDF were detailed at length at a detention hearing in United States \nv. Hodges, 8:20-cr-00148-px-1 (D. Md. Feb. 17, 2021). Ms. Hodges—who is almost 70 years \nold, takes three medications a day for hypertension, and suffers from anxiety—was detained after \nan initial hearing on February 2, 2021. At that initial hearing, the United States Attorney’s Office \n19 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 27 of 44\nfor the District of Maryland informed the District Court that Ms. Hodges would not be sent to \nCDF (presumably based on assurances from CDF itself, in light of the ongoing outbreak in the \nfacility). Despite these assurances, Ms. Hodges was nonetheless placed at CDF pending her \nhearing on February 17. She was placed into a male unit at CDF, with a least four other residents \nwho had tested positive for COVID—a wildly dangerous placement that intermixed different \ncohorts. Like many other residents, CDF also forced Ms. Hodges to go without medication for \nmultiple days. Ms. Hodges’ experience—also reflected in the declaration of another resident, see\nECF No. 1-9—shows the degree to which CDF has refused to change its practices in light of \nCOVID. \nARGUMENT \nPlaintiffs seek a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction to address \nunconstitutional conditions of confinement at CDF. To obtain a TRO or a preliminary injunction, \nPlaintiffs must show the following: (1) Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits, (2) they are \nlikely to suffer irreparable harm absent preliminary relief, (3) the balance of equities tips in \nPlaintiffs’ favor, and (4) an injunction is in the public interest. Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, \nInc., 555 U.S. 7, 20, (2008). Plaintiffs satisfy all four requirements. \nI. A  Temporary  Restraining  Order  Should  Immediately  Issue  to  Address  CDF’s \nUnconstitutional Conditions, with a More Comprehensive Preliminary Injunction to \nFollow. \nOver the last year, federal district courts, including this Court, have granted temporary \nrestraining  orders  or  granted  preliminary  injunctions  to  remedy  constitutionally  inadequate \nconditions  that  increase  the  threat  of  COVID-19,  ordering  jails  to  comply  with  the  CDC \nGuidance and take other necessary measures to protect prisoners from infection, serious illness, \nand  death.  See  supra  at  3-5  (recounting  recent  decisions).  Appointment  of  an  independent \ninspector is particularly common at the TRO stage in these cases, with an inspection occurring in \n20 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 28 of 44\nat least one case (in this District) prior to any hearing on the TRO. E.g., Seth v. McDonough, 461 \nF. Supp. 3d 242 (D. Md. 2020) (appointment of inspector prior to TRO hearing). Because the \nconditions in CDF create a substantial risk of serious future harm to the prisoners’ health, this \nCourt should grant the proposed temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. \nPlaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Their Eighth And Fifth / \nFourteenth Amendment Claims. \nThe Eighth  and Fifth / Fourteenth Amendments  prohibit state actors  from  exposing \nincarcerated people to conditions of confinement that threaten their health and safety. Helling v. \nMcKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993); see Raynor v. Pugh, 817 F.3d 123, 127 (4th Cir. 2016) \n(stating that prison officials must take “reasonable measures to guarantee the safety of the \ninmates”). This is sometimes referred to as a “substantial risk of harm.” While the Eighth \nAmendment secures the right of people convicted of a crime to be free from exposure to serious \nharm, Helling, 509 U.S. at 33, the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments \nafford at least as much protection to pretrial detainees, City of Revere v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., 463 \nU.S. 239, 244 (1983). \nTo establish a conditions-of-confinement violation under these amendments, plaintiff \nmust  also  make  a  “state  of  mind”  showing.  Two  different  tests  apply.  Under  the  Eighth \nAmendment,9 an official is liable if the official displays “deliberate indifference” to “a condition \nof confinement that is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering” to \nsomeone detained, which includes “exposure of inmates to a serious, communicable disease.” \nHelling, 509 U.S. at 33. The due process and Eighth Amendment analyses differ. Under the due \nprocess standard, a plaintiff can prevail in showing that the defendant “knew, or should have \n9 The Eighth Amendment is applied against state actors under the Fourteenth Amendment. Robinson v. \nCalifornia, 370 U.S. 660 (1962). \n21 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 29 of 44\nknown, that the [challenged] condition posed an excessive risk to health or safety.” Darnell v. \nPineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 35 (2d Cir. 2017). Under the Eighth Amendment standard, a plaintiff must \nshow that the defendant was deliberately indifferent to the risk posed. Helling, 509 U.S. at 35. In \nother words, the Eighth Amendment calls for a subjective analysis of the defendant’s intent, \nwhile the due process analysis requires only an objective analysis of whether the defendant \nshould have known of the risks of harm.10\nHere, there is a substantial risk of harm and. In addition, both the Eighth Amendment and \ndue process “state of mind” tests are met. \n1. The Jail’s Conditions Create a Substantial Risk of Serious Harm. \nTo meet the first part of the test, CDF residents must show that they face “a substantial \nrisk  of . . .  harm  resulting  from  the  prisoner’s  unwilling  exposure  to  the  challenged \nconditions.” Shakka v. Smith, 71 F.3d 162, 166 (4th Cir. 1995).11 Plaintiffs easily clear that bar. \n10 This  different  approach  for  pretrial  detainees  versus  convicted  prisoners  logically  follows  from  the \nSupreme Court’s decision in Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 U.S. 389, 394 (2015), in which the Court held that an \nobjective—not subjective—standard applied to a pretrial detainee raising an excessive-force claim. Many circuits \nhave applied this reasoning to conditions-of-confinement claims. Compare Castro v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 833 F.3d \n1060, 1070 (9th Cir. 2016) (en banc) (adopting a new objective standard for deliberate indifference claims brought \nby pretrial detainees); Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 35 (2d Cir. 2017) (same); Miranda v. Cty. of Lake, 900 F.3d \n335, 351-52 (7th Cir. 2018) (same) with Alderson v. Concordia Parish Corr. Facility, 848 F.3d 415, 419 n. 4 (5th \nCir. 2017) (declining to reconsider its earlier precedent treating Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims alike); \nWhitney v. City of St. Louis, 887 F.3d 857, 860 n.4 (8th Cir. 2018) (same); Nam Dang by and through Vina Dang v. \nSheriff, Seminole Cty. Florida, 871 F.3d 1272, 1279 n.2 (11th Cir. 2017) (same). The Fourth Circuit has yet to \ngrapple with Kinsley’s impact on conditions of confinement claims. E.g., Duff v. Potter, 665 F. App’x 242, 244-45 \n(4th Cir. 2016) (applying objective reasonableness standard to a detainee’s excessive-force claim but not his \nmedical-need claim, which it affirmed on forfeiture grounds). Whether or not the pretrial test continues to include a \nsubjective component, the claims in this case meet both standards, as described below. \n11 Since Plaintiffs’ claims involve inadequate medical treatment, and since a subclass of them is medically \nvulnerable due to preexisting conditions, Plaintiffs could also frame these claims in terms of “deliberate indifference \nto serious medical needs.” Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976); see Coreas v. Bounds, 451 F. Supp. 3d 407 \n(D. Md. 2020) (assessing medically vulnerable detainees’ conditions claim through this lens). However, since \nCDF’s dangerous conditions include both failures in medical care and other basic safety precautions and imperil \nprisoners both with and without preexisting conditions, Plaintiffs’ claims are best characterized as a challenge to \nconditions that create a substantial risk of “serious illness and needless suffering.” Helling, 509 U.S. at 33. \nRegardless, “‘[w]hether one characterizes the treatment received by [the resident] as inhumane conditions of \nconfinement, failure to attend to his medical needs, or a combination of both, it is appropriate to apply the \n‘deliberate indifference’ standard.’” Id. at 32 (quotations omitted). \n22 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 30 of 44\nAs detailed extensively by Dr. Franco-Paredes and Dr. Meyer, COVID-19 is highly \ncommunicable and itself creates a substantial risk of harm. The conditions at CDF only magnify \nthis risk. As Dr. Meyer explains, “individuals placed at CDF are at a significantly higher risk of \ninfection with COVID-19 as compared to the population in the community and that they are at a \nsignificantly higher risk of harm if they do become infected. These harms include serious illness \nand even death.” ECF No. 1-27 ¶ 41. \nThese conditions satisfy the objective test. In Coreas v. Bounds, 451 F. Supp. 3d 407, 428 \n(D. Md. 2020), this Court found that detainees at two different ICE facilities had shown a \nsubstantial risk of serious harm before there were any confirmed cases of COVID-19 at those \nfacilities. Id. (stating that it would release medically vulnerable detainees if there were any cases \nof COVID-19 at the facilities holding them, even though the facilities gave detainees “soap, hand \nsanitizer, and cleaning supplies,” encouraged them to seek medical treatment for illness, and had \nimplemented thorough screening measures); Coreas v. Bounds, 457 F. Supp. 3d 460 (D. Md. \n2020)  (“Coreas  II”)  (granting  renewed  preliminary  injunction  and  releasing  detainee  upon \npositive test of nurse); Coreas v. Bounds, 458 F. Supp. 3d 352, 354 (D. Md. 2020) (“Coreas III”) \n(releasing two other detainees); see also Jones v. Wolf, 467 F. Supp. 3d 74 (W.D.N.Y. 2020) \n(finding that the risk of COVID-19 in an immigration detention facility satisfied the objective \nfactor even through there were no reported cases there).12 Here, of course, an outbreak at CDF is \nalready in progress that has infected one-third of residents and staff. \n12 In other factual contexts, courts have found that far more attenuated dangers than the immediate threats \nhere could satisfy the objective test. See, e.g., Helling, 509 U.S. at 35 (affirming circuit court’s holding that second-\nhand smoke posed an unreasonable risk of serious harm to a prisoner’s future health); Johnson v. Epps, 479 F. \nApp’x 583, 590-91 (5th Cir. 2012) (finding that prison policy under which prisoners use unsterilized barbering \ninstruments, which could expose them to communicate diseases, posed an unreasonable risk of future harm), Brown \nv. Bargery, 207 F.3d 863, 865, 867-68 (6th Cir. 2000) (finding that improperly installed prison bunks that created a \ndanger that inmates could slide off of them and onto the concrete floor, as well as protruding anchor bolts “which \ncould potentially cause an injury,” could constitute a risk to their future health under the objective prong); DeGidio \nv. Pung, 920 F.2d 525, 527-29 (8th Cir. 1990) (affirming district court’s conclusion that a “serious risk to the \n23 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 31 of 44\nIn  addressing  the  objective  component,  courts  must  also  “assess  whether  society \nconsiders the risk that the prisoner complains of to be so grave that it violates contemporary \nstandards of decency to expose anyone unwillingly to such a risk.” Helling, 509 U.S. at 36. \nSociety  has  deemed  the  risk  posed  by  COVID-19  intolerable:  there  have  been \nunprecedented changes to American life to avoid it. Drs. Franco-Paredes and Meyer describe at \nlength the life-changing risks of COVID, including medical complications that may be lifelong, \nas well as the long list of CDC guidelines—including specific guidelines for detention facilities. \nMeanwhile, CDF has aggravated the risks of COVID-19 by (for example) exposing \nresidents to extreme psychological distress through the use of punitive lockdowns and isolation \nconditions. See Doe v. Barr, No. 20-CV-02141-LB, 2020 WL 1820667, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 12, \n2020),  at  *16 (finding  that  “petitioner’s  other  diagnoses  of  chronic  PTSD  and  depression \ncompound his susceptibility” to a COVID-19 infection); see id. at *5-6 (detailing evidence that \nmental illness can depress the immune response and lead to an increased risk of infections). \nFurther, although Plaintiffs’ claims address the risk of harm imposed by the sum total of CDF’s \ninadequate conditions, some of CDF’s conditions may independently create a substantial risk of \nserious harm. See, e.g.,  Porter  v.

Defendants  Knew  of,  or  Should  Have  Known  of,  and  Disregarded  the \nExcessive  Risk  to  Prisoners’  Health  and  Safety  Posed  by  COVID-19, \nParticularly Absent Appropriate Precautions. \n(a) Eighth Amendment Test \nTo satisfy the subjective component of deliberate indifference, a plaintiff must show that \nprison officials “kn[ew] of and disregard[ed] an excessive risk to [the plaintiff’s] health or \nsafety.”  Farmer  v. Brennan,  511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994).  “[T]he test is  whether the [prison \nofficials] kn[ew] the plaintiff inmate faces a serious danger to his safety and they could avert the \ndanger easily yet they fail to do so.” Brown v. N.C. Dep’t of Corr., 612 F.3d 720, 723 (4th Cir. \n2010) (quotations omitted). \nThe CDC’s guidance for correctional and detention facilities was issued almost a year \nago, explicitly warning of the specific dangers COVID-19 imposes in these institutions. See \ngenerally ECF No. 1-27 (describing specific dangers  of COVID in detention facilities  and \noutlining CDC guidelines, which have been updated on multiple occasions). CDF was well \naware of the requirements needed to protect against an outbreak, and to ensure proper treatment \nof residents. ECF No. 1-16 (referring to CDC guidelines); ECF No. 1-17 (same); ECF No. 1-18 \n(same); ECF No. 1-19 (same); ECF No. 1-24 at 13 (“DPSCS represents that it is committed to \nproviding all necessary precautionary measures and supportive therapies to avoid an outbreak of \nCOVID-19, including taking all of the preventative actions advised by the CDC[.]”). See also\nSecretary’s  Directive,  DPSCS,  June  7,  2020, \nhttps://itcd.dpscs.state.md.us/PIA/ShowFile.aspx?fileID=1531, at 2 (indicating that DPSCS will \nfollow CDC guidelines for detention facilities).13\n13 In response to a media inquiry regarding this lawsuit, Mark Vernarelli, a spokesman for DPSCS, said in a \nstatement that “the state’s 21 detention facilities follow Maryland Health Department guidelines for containing the \nspread of the coronavirus inside congregate settings, including frequent testing, isolating those who are infected and \nrestricting movement among inmates.” Antonio Olivo, Coronavirus outbreak inside Maryland detention facility \n25 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 33 of 44\nBut CDF failed at every turn: on cohorting, on cleaning supplies, on face masks, on \nmedical care for vulnerable patients. On top of a complete failure to plan for and implement \nthese protocols, CDF then turned a blind eye when an outbreak overtook the facility, placing new \nadmissions  with  symptomatic  COVID-positives  residents  and  shipping  out  other  COVID-\npositive  residents  to  a  wretched  warehouse  down  the  street.  Defendants  knew  the  dangers \nimposed by COVID-19. DPSCS (and CDF) publicly reported its COVID numbers throughout \n2020 and into 2021, speaking to growing numbers at certain facilities and a rapidly growing \nnumber of positive staff members, too. See Makdessi v. Fields, 789 F.3d 126, 141 (4th Cir. 2015) \n(when danger has been “expressly noted by prison officials,” this can prove that official’s actual \nknowledge under the subjective test). \nIn many ways, the numbers alone demonstrate deliberate indifference on the part of \nDefendants: one third of residents and staff tested positive for COVID within a month. This is \nnot a mere accident, nor mere negligence—not when the country is one year into dealing with a \nvirus that has dramatically altered virtually every aspect of daily life. \nThe risks imposed by Defendants’ failures are obvious. It is not challenging to predict the \ngrim results of intermixing cohorts, denying prisoners soap, neglecting to sanitize common \nsurfaces, locking medically vulnerable prisoners in cells with for 23-hours per day, and failing to \nmonitor and treat symptomatic prisoners during a pandemic. See Porter, 923 F.3d at 348, 361 \nsparks class-action lawsuit (Feb. 20, 2021), The Washington Post, https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-\nsafety/coronavirus-outbreak-inside-maryland-detention-facility-sparks-class-action-lawsuit/2021/02/21/3534ab4a-\n73c2-11eb-85fa-e0ccb3660358_story.html.Vernarelli stated that “CDF follows strict health-department COVID \nguidelines and protocols and is subject to regular compliance audits.” Id. The Class Action Complaint (ECF No. 1), \ntogether with all exhibits, including those filed under seal (ECF Nos. 2 - 10), Plaintiffs’ Motion to Seal (ECF No. \n11), and the proposed Summonses (ECF No. 12) were served on the Maryland Attorney General via email to \ncivil_service@oag.state.md.us on February 20, 2021 in accordance with Maryland Rule 1-124(j) & (k) and the \nprocedures established by the Office of the Attorney General. \n26 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 34 of 44\n(“[A]n obvious risk of harm justifies an inference that a prison official subjectively disregarded a \nsubstantial risk of serious harm to the inmate.”) (quotations omitted); Makdessi, 789 F.3d at 141 \n(stating that subjective test can be satisfied where the risk of harm “was so obvious that it had to \nhave been known”). \nEven if CDF has created policies that tracked CDC guidance on paper, the result does not \nchange, because it is what CDF actually has done that matters. Unquestionably, in practice, CDF \nhas failed to follow proper protocol. See Banks v. Booth, 459 F. Supp. 3d 143, 158 (D.D.C. 2020) \n(granting TRO, based on declarations from residents rebutting that jail implemented its own \nwritten policies: “Based on the current record, Plaintiffs have provided evidence that Defendants \nare aware of the risk that COVID-19 poses to Plaintiffs’ health and have disregarded those risks \nby failing to take comprehensive, timely, and proper steps to stem the spread of the virus.”); \nMartinez-Brooks v. Easter, 459 F. Supp. 3d at 443 (finding that plaintiffs were likely to succeed \non Eighth Amendment claim); Carranza v. Reams, 2020 WL 2320174, at *10 (same, despite \nsome efforts on part of prison facility to mitigate against COVID). The predictable result of \nCDF’s conduct is a worsened outbreak in a facility that is failing to meet infected residents’ \nmedical needs. \nPlaintiffs have thus satisfied the subjective factor and shown deliberate indifference. \n(b) Fifth / Fourteenth Amendment test \nThe above analysis, meanwhile, applies only to the Eighth Amendment claims raised in \nthis suit, for convicted individuals who have already been sentenced at CDF. For residents held \npretrial at CDF, their burden is lower—to show that Defendants “knew, or should have known, \nthat they need only show that the [challenged] condition posed an excessive risk to health or \nsafety.” Darnell, 849 F.3d at 35. As discussed above, Plaintiffs and proposed class members \n27 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 35 of 44\nhave  demonstrated  that  Defendants  knew  of  the  risk  of  COVID-19  and  then  recklessly \ndisregarded that risk. By meeting their burden under the Eighth Amendment, Plaintiffs and \nproposed class members have, by definition, met their burden under the Fifth Amendment. \nPlaintiffs Will Suffer Irreparable Harm Absent Immediate Relief \nWithout this Court’s relief, Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm for two reasons. First, \n“the denial of a constitutional right . . . constitutes irreparable harm.” Ross v. Meese, 818 F.2d \n1132, 1135 (4th Cir. 1987). Second, CDF’s conditions subject Plaintiffs to an increased risk that \nthey will contract COVID-19 (or contract it again) and that they will suffer serious illness, \nphysical harm, and death if they do. This is irreparable harm, too. See, e.g., Coreas v. Bounds, \n451 F. Supp. 3d at 428-29 (finding that, if there were any COVID-19 cases in the immigration \nfacilities at issue, petitioners faced “a significant risk of death or serious illness,” and that this is \nirreparable harm). \nThe Balance of Equities and the Public Interest Favor the Requested Relief \nThe balance of equities favors Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs face infection and sickness in a jail \nthat cannot protect them; they seek this injunction to avoid serious illness, long-term physical \ndamage, and death. CDF need only comply with basic public health measures. \nThe relief that Plaintiffs  seek is  also  in the public interest. CDF is  not an isolated \nenvironment. Uncontrolled infection within CDF risks the health and safety of every person \nconnected directly or indirectly to the many correctional officers, healthcare workers and others \nwho enter and leave the Jail environment every day. See ECF No. 1-27 ¶ 14 (“Prison health is\npublic health.” (emphasis in original)); 49 (“Health in jails and prisons is community health. \nProtecting the health of individuals who are detained in and work in these facilities is vital to \nprotecting not only those individuals, but the health of the wider community.”). \n28 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 36 of 44\nTherefore, any remedy that will protect the Plaintiffs benefits the wider community. \nCastillo v. Barr, 449 F. Supp. 3d 915, 923 (C.D. Cal. 2020) (“[T]he emergency injunctive relief \nsought, here, is absolutely in the public’s best interest. The public has a critical interest in \npreventing  the  further  spread  of  the  coronavirus.  An  outbreak  at  Adelanto  would,  further, \nendanger all of us.”); Ortuno v. Jennings, No. 20-CV-02064-MMC, 2020 WL 1701724, at *4 \n(N.D. Cal. Apr. 8, 2020) (“[T]he public interest in promoting public health is served by efforts to \ncontain the further spread of COVID-19, particularly in detention centers, which typically are \nstaffed by numerous individuals who reside in nearby communities.”). \nII. This Court Should Order Release of the Medically Vulnerable Subclass of Pretrial \nDetainees Under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 \nAs noted above, CDF is in the midst of an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19.14 The \nmembers  of  the  Medically  Vulnerable  Subclass—all  of  whom  are  pretrial  detainees  not \nconvicted of any crime—each have medical conditions that worsen the effects of COVID-19.15\nFor them, exposure to COVID-19 brings a meaningfully higher risk of permanent organ damage \nand death. \nCDF has not taken adequate steps to protect these residents. See, e.g., ECF Nos. 1-11, 1-\n12; 1-13; 1-3, 1-4; 1-5, 1-15. To the contrary, CDF deprived one resident who suffers from \nasthma his inhaler, after the resident tested positive for COVID. ECF Nos. 1-3. Like all residents \nat CDF, they are locked down with symptomatic cellmates, denied medical care (even when \nexhibiting COVID-19 symptoms), and, once infected, isolated in inhumane conditions where \n14 ECF No. 1-27 ¶ 25 (“[I]t is my professional judgment that this facility is dangerously under-equipped and \nill-prepared to prevent and manage the spread of COVID-19, which is currently spreading throughout the jail. The \nfacility is also dangerously under-equipped and ill-prepared to provide adequate treatment for residents who are \ninfected with COVID-19.”). \n15 See U.S. Centers for Diseases Control, “People Who Are At High Risk [for severe illness from COVID-\n19],” https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html (last reviewed \nApr. 15, 2020). \n29 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 37 of 44\ntheir symptoms are not meaningfully monitored. ECF Nos. 1-11, 1-12, 1-13, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 1-15. \nThese conditions are dangerous for everyone; for medically vulnerable prisoners, even more so. \nECF No. 1-27 ¶ 30 (These measures are more important still for individuals with preexisting \nconditions . . . or older age. They are in even greater danger in CDF, including a meaningfully \nhigher risk of death.”). Medical experts are unequivocal: COVID-19 can escalate rapidly, ECF \nNo. 1-27 ¶ 35 (“Progression of respiratory symptoms in COVID-19 can be extremely rapid, \nwithin 24 hours, requiring hospitalization, so people in medical isolation need to be diligently \nmonitored for clinical worsening.”), and many vulnerable prisoners are already sick. \nDefendants cannot remedy CDF’s many failures in time to protect these residents’ lives. \nTherefore, their continued detention is unconstitutional, and this Court should release them \npursuant to a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241.16 Over the last year, multiple federal \ncourts have granted such relief where there was no other way to protect imprisoned people’s \nrights (and lives) from COVID-19. See, e.g., Martinez-Brooks, 459 F. Supp. at 411 (granting \nTRO  habeas  relief  under  Eighth  Amendment  to  federal  post-conviction  prisoners  at  FCI \nDanbury);  Malam  v.  Adducci,  452  F.  Supp.  3d  643,  661  (E.D.  Mich.  2020)  (releasing \nimmigration detainee under § 2241 because, given the “risk and severity of irreparable harm to \nthe Petitioner and the weight of public health evidence,” release was “the only reasonable \noption”); Thakker v. Doll, 451 F. Supp. 3d 358 (M.D. Pa. 2020) (finding that conditions of \nconfinement at an immigrant detention facilities created serious risks for medically vulnerable \ndetainees where, as here, there were unsanitary conditions, prisoners were forced to buy their \nown soap and share cleaning supplies, the facilities did not provide information on COVID-19 \n16 Because the Medically Vulnerably Subclass members are pretrial detainees, they may bring this action \nunder § 2241. In re Wright, 826 F.3d 774, 782 (4th Cir. 2016) (explaining that “prisoners in . . . pre-conviction \ncustody . . . or other forms of custody that are possible without a conviction are able to take advantage of § 2241 \nrelief”) (quotations omitted). \n30 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 38 of 44\nprevention, and detainees shared cells with others who showed COVID-19symptoms); Basank v. \nDecker, 449 F. Supp. 3d 205 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2020) (ordering release of ten immigration \ndetainees with underlying medical conditions including diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and \nasthma because facility could not ensure social distancing and had not taken steps to protect \nmedically vulnerable detainees, although, in contrast to this case, the ICE detention facility was \nproviding soap and hand sanitizer and substantially increased cleaning). \nIf this Court is not inclined to release the Medically Vulnerable Subclass as a whole, it \ncan, as other federal courts have, order Defendants to produce a list of the members of that \nsubclass and any other information this Court requires to make appropriate determinations as to \nthem—and  to  ensure  that  CDF  take  steps  to  treat  these  individuals  appropriately  while  in \ncustody. See Martinez-Brooks, 459 F. Supp. 3d at 411 (recounting order to FCI Danbury to \nreview all medically vulnerable residents).17\nIII. Additional Interim Remedies Are Available to This Court. \nCourts of equity operate with flexibility, especially in emergencies of great consequence.  \n“It is my professional opinion that these steps are both necessary and urgent. The numbers at \nCDF are evidence of an outbreak. . . . The time to act is now, including for residents who have \nalready tested positive for COVID-19.” ECF No. 1-27 ¶ 48 (“The numbers at CDF are evidence \nof an outbreak. . . . The time to act is now, including for residents who have already tested \npositive  for  COVID-19.”),  42  (“Future  outbreaks  will  happen  at  CDF  without  additional \nmeasures”). \nThe urgency of these concerns is real; while the Court considers the issues raised by the \nComplaint in this case, the COVID virus moves at its own, deadly timetable. Therefore, this \n17 In addition, as described below, this Court has and should exercise the authority to release members of the \nMedically Vulnerable Subclass on non-monetary bond pending the outcome of their habeas petition. See infra.\n31 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 39 of 44\nCourt should institute interim remedies to protect prisoners from serious harm while it considers \ntheir constitutional claims. First, this Court can transfer prisoners to another appropriate facility \nif necessary to protect their rights under the Eighth and Fifth / Fourteenth Amendments. Second, \nthis Court can release members of the Medically Vulnerable Subclass on non-monetary bond \nwhile it considers their habeas petition under § 2241. \nThis Court Has and Should Exercise the Authority to Transfer Prisoners to Another \nAppropriate Facility to Remedy the Constitutional Violations or Protect Prisoners \nFrom Additional Constitutional and Physical Harms. \nPlaintiffs ask this Court to order Defendants to immediately remedy the conditions at \nCDF so that they do not impose a substantial risk of serious harm on the people imprisoned \nthere. However, as the CDC and other experts recognize, it may be impossible to protect certain \nvulnerable prisoners without the removal of at least some prisoners. \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs ask this Court to order that, to the extent Defendants cannot \nremedy the substantial risk of serious harm to certain prisoners, it should transfer them to home \ndetention or another appropriate facility. Another federal court recently recognized this solution \nfor protecting prisoners in a jail that cannot adequately address the risk of COVID-19. See Gray \nv. Cty. of Riverside, No. 5:13-CV-0444-VAP-OPX, 2020 WL 4243484, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 14, \n2020) (“Should the County be unable to implement adequate social distancing within its existing \njail facilities and take other necessary steps to decrease risk of infection, this Court has the \nauthority to order the transfer of prisoners to different facilities.”) \nIndeed, courts have previously transferred jail and prison residents where necessary to \nprotect their Eighth Amendment rights. For example, in Plata v. Brown, 427 F. Supp. 3d 1211 \n(N.D. Cal. 2013), the court  addressed the presence of “cocci” infections at two California \nprisons. Cocci infections are asymptomatic for 60 percent of people, but it “can also result in \nserious illness and, in the most extreme cases, death.” Id. at 1214. The court found that the \n32 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 40 of 44\nprisons’ measures to abate the threat of cocci were inadequate to avoid a substantial risk of \nserious harm to certain high-risk inmates, and, accordingly, failure to transfer these groups of \nprisoners would “result in deliberate indifference under the Eighth Amendment.” Id. at 1224. \nOther courts have also ordered transfers to remedy or avoid Eighth Amendment violations.18\nIf necessary to avoid a substantial risk of serious harm to some or all prisoners, this Court \nshould do the same. \nThis Court Has and Should Exercise the Authority to Release Medically Vulnerable \nSubclass Members on Non-Monetary Bond Conditions Pending Review of Their \nRequest for Habeas Relief Under § 2241. \nA federal court has the authority to grant bail to habeas petitioners who are properly \nbefore it. See United States v. Perkins, 53 F. App’x 667, 669 (4th Cir. 2002) (explaining the \nstandard “[t]o prevail on a motion for release on bail in a habeas case”); Mapp v. Reno, 241 F.3d \n221, 226 (2d Cir. 2001) (describing “the authority of the federal courts to grant bail to habeas \npetitioners”); Bolante v. Keisler, 506 F.3d 618, 620 (7th Cir. 2007) (“Inherent judicial authority \nto grant bail to persons who have asked for relief in an application for habeas corpus is a natural \nincident of habeas corpus, the vehicle by which a person questions the government’s right to \ndetain him.”). Pursuant to this authority, if this Court does not immediately release members of \nthe Medically Vulnerable Subclass under § 2241, it should release some or all of them on non-\nmonetary bond. \n18 See, e.g., Reaves v. Dep’t of Corr., 392 F. Supp. 3d 195, 200, 210 (D. Mass. 2019) (concluding that transfer \na quadriplegic state prisoner convicted of first degree murder to a non-Department of Corrections facility where he \ncould  receive  adequate  care  was  the  appropriate  remedy  for  his  Eighth  Amendment  claims  challenging  his \ninadequate medical care), appeal filed, (1st Cir. Nov 4, 2019); United States v. Wallen, 177 F. Supp. 2d 455, 458, \n459 (D. Md. 2001) (ordering transfer of a pretrial detainee because of the Court’s “grave[] concern[s] that [his] Fifth \nAmendment rights [against deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs] may have been violated and, more \nimportantly, that those rights may be at continued risk if he [were] returned to [the jail]”); Johnson v. Harris, 479 F. \nSupp. 333, 338 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (ordering the transfer of a severely diabetic prison to a facility that could meet his \nmedical needs as a remedy for Eighth Amendment violations). \n33 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 41 of 44\nRelease on bond pending habeas is appropriate where the petitioner can “show that his \npetition presents a substantial constitutional claim upon which he has a high probability of \nsuccess, and that extraordinary circumstances warrant his release.” Perkins, 53 F. App’x at 669. \nCircuit courts have defined “extraordinary circumstances” to mean that “the grant of bail [is] \nnecessary to make the habeas remedy effective.” Mapp, 241 F.3d at 226 (quotations omitted). \nSee Abdullah v. Bush, 945 F.Supp.2d 64, 67 (D.D.C. 2013), aff’d sub nom. Abdullah v. Obama, \n753 F.3d 193 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (same); Landano v. Rafferty, 970 F.2d 1230, 1239 (3d Cir. 1992) \n(same). \nExtraordinary circumstances exist here. The Medically Vulnerable Subclass seeks habeas \nrelief because if they do not receive it, there is an unacceptable risk that they will become \nseriously  ill  and  die.  Rapid  removal  from  CDF  is  necessary  “to  make  the  habeas  remedy \neffective” because, with further delay, medically vulnerable prisoners may suffer the severe \nillness, physical damage, and death they seek habeas to avoid. Mapp, 241 F.3d at 226.19\nBased on these considerations, a federal court for the District of Massachusetts released \nimmigration detainees on non-monetary bond conditions while their class action habeas petition \nbased on a detention center’s failure to protect them from the spread of COVID-19 is pending. \nSee also Savino v. Souza, 459 F. Supp. 3d 317, 320 (D. Mass. 2020) (“Before addressing the \nmerits of the petition, the Court relied on its inherent authority expeditiously to review bail \napplications for all of the detainees in the class, one by one, and released almost a third of them \n19 Cf. Johnston v. Marsh, 227 F.2d 528, 529-32 (3d Cir. 1955) (finding that a district court had the power to \ngrant of bail pending habeas where the petitioner, “an advanced diabetic, was, under conditions of confinement, \nrapidly progressing toward total blindness,” comparing this authority to a judge’s power to issue a “stay of \nexecution” while a petition is pending). \n34 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 18-1   Filed 02/22/21   Page 42 of 44\nto house arrest under strict conditions.). Other courts have also found that the risks imposed by \nCOVID-19 warranted release on bond while a habeas action was pending.20\nGiven the severe and unavoidable risks to the Medically Vulnerable Class, this Court can \nand should act quickly to do the same. \nCONCLUSION \nAs Dr. Meyer recounts: \nIt  is  []  my  professional  judgment  that  this  outbreak  was  preventable.  This \noutbreak reflects CDF did not appropriately prepare or plan for this situation. \nCDF has demonstrated that it is unable to handle the current situation. Problems \nin  implementing  basic  disease  prevention  and  management  strategies  have \npersisted even after the outbreak in mid-January 2021. . . . Future outbreaks will \nhappen at CDF without additional measures. \nAs such, from a public health perspective, it is my opinion that CDF should act \nimmediately to comply with the CDC Guidelines on the management of COVID-\n19 in correctional facilities. This requires not just developing (or adhering to) well \nwritten protocols, but actually ensuring that the protocols are implemented to the \nfullest extent. \nECF No. 1-27 ¶¶ 42-43. \nAccordingly, for these reasons, Plaintiffs ask that the Court grant the relief described in \nthis pleading, both the limited relief of the proposed temporary restraining order and the more \nexpansive relief of the proposed preliminary injunction. \nRespectfully submitted, \n(Signatures follow on next page.)\n20 See Avendano Hernandez v.

There is an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID1 at the Chesapeake Detention Facility \n(“CDF”).  In less than one month, according to Defendants’ own statistics, one-third of current \nresidents2 (156 of approximately 400 residents) and approximately one-third of staff members (78 \nof approximately 220 employees) have tested positive for COVID. Expert Declaration of Dr. \nJaimie Meyer (February 18, 2021) (“Meyer Decl.”) ¶ 26 (relying on documentation from DPSCS, \nCDF, and communications concerning current conditions at CDF). \n2.  Defendants’ actions have fueled this outbreak, and they also have failed to take \nappropriate action in response.  \n3.  CDF is a facility operated by the Maryland Department of Public Safety and \nCorrectional Services (“DPSCS”) located at 401 East Madison Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21202.  \nCDF was previously known as the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center (“MCAC”).  \n4.  CDF houses approximately 400 residents and has approximately 220 staff. CDF \nhouses residents who are in pretrial federal criminal detention, as well as individuals who have \nbeen sentenced in federal criminal cases. Since 2010, CDF has been leased under an agreement \nwith the Office of Federal Detention Trustee, United Stated Department of Justice, on behalf of \nthe United States Marshals Service, for the primary purpose of housing federal detainees awaiting \ntrial. Agreement Number ODT-10-0001 (DUNS Number 879016178, effective 9/1/2010). Under \nthis contract between the United States Department of Justice and DPSCS, MCAC (now CDF), \nDPSCS is required to “provide for the safe, secure, and humane confinement for male and female \n                                                \n1   Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, commonly called the “novel coronavirus” \nor “coronavirus” is the highly contagious and transmissible virus underlying this cause of action and the event \ndescribed in this Complaint. The virus frequently results in a disease, COVID-19. Plaintiffs refer to both the virus and \ndisease as “COVID” or “COVID-19.” \n2   The plaintiffs use the term “residents” to refer to individuals detained at CDF and other facilities. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 3 of 64\npopulation” in accordance with federal standards outlined in the Contract, as well as “the U.S. \nConstitution; all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations; applicable Presidential \nExecutive Orders (E.O.); all applicable case law; and Court Orders and Consent Decrees. Should \na conflict exist between any of the aforementioned standards, the most stringent shall apply.” \nAgreement Number ODT-10-0001 at 3-4. \n5.  CDF was originally designed as a state facility, with single-person cells. CDF now \noperates at double its original capacity, with two-person cells. This has resulted in overcrowding \nin tight spaces. \n6.  As presently operated, CDF housing units are spread over three “towers” or “pods” \nconnected by corridors, broken into six units, A to F. Each housing unit is divided into “quads” or \n“tiers” referred to by a housing unit letter (A to F) and a number (1 to 4). Each quad, in turn, \ncomprises 12 cells. Each cell now holds two residents. Double-celling has increased CDF’s \nmaximum capacity. \n7.  Some residents who tested positive for COVID were removed from CDF. They \nhave been placed in a dormitory facility in the Jail Industries Building (“JI”), located at 531 East \nMadison Street, Baltimore, Maryland, 21202. That building has the appearance of a former \nwarehouse, with broken windows and temperatures around 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Residents who \nhave been quarantined there are often denied access to medication. Built in 1922 as an office \nbuilding and retrofitted as a jail in the 1980s, JI was closed in 2017 due to what public safety \nofficials called a “security nightmare.” Jayne, Miller, “I-Team looks inside closing jail facility in \nBaltimore,”  WBALTV  (Sept.  1,  2017),  https://www.wbaltv.com/article/i-team-looks-inside-\nclosing-jail-facility-in-baltimore/12139786 (containing a video tour of the then-closed facility).    \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 4 of 64\n8.  The  residents  housed  at  CDF  are  under  a  constant  and  substantial  threat  of \ncontracting COVID. \n9.  Some residents who have contracted COVID receive grossly substandard medical \ntreatment (if they receive treatment at all). \n10.  Because jails, prisons, and other detention and correctional facilities are particularly \nvulnerable  to  COVID,  the  U.S.  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)  has \nrecommended basic measures these facilities should take to control the spread of the virus and \ntreat infected prisoners—for example, requiring the use of face masks, implementing social \ndistancing practices, and providing sufficient quantities of cleaning materials including soap and \nhand sanitizer. Ex. JJ (“Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-\n19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, updated \nJan.  19,  2021  (last  visited  on  Feb.  20,  2021)),  also  available  at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-\ncorrectional-detention.html. \n11.  Defendants3 have ignored these and other public health recommendations.   \n12.  Residents lack the means to clean their cells. CDF staff does not clean—or arrange \nfor the cleaning of—common areas in between recreation sessions, when up to 12 residents are \nout in the common areas at a time.  \n13.  CDF does not require or enforce the wearing of masks for residents. CDF staff do \nnot consistently wear their masks or wear them properly. \n                                                \n3   Since Defendants Wilson and Green are being sued in their official capacities, “Defendant Wilson,” \n“Defendant Green,” and “CDF” are used interchangeably in this Complaint except where an individual defendant is \nspecifically named. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 5 of 64\n14.  Residents who have tested negative for COVID are forced into the cells formerly \noccupied by residents who have tested positive, without any cleaning of these cells. \n15.  CDF places some COVID-positive male residents in the “cadre,” a unit inside the \nfacility. CDF also places new admissions to the facility inside the “cadre,” in cells next to the \nCOVID-positive residents. \n16.  Confoundingly, CDF has recently placed two women who were recently admitted \nto CDF in the “cadre,” next to positive male residents who were actively exhibiting symptoms of \nCOVID. \n17.  CDF ignores some sick calls altogether. CDF delays responding to many other sick \ncalls. CDF also fails to respond to, or delays its response to, residents’ health complaints and to \nresidents exhibiting of COVID-like symptoms.  \n18.  CDF has exposed resident after resident to the virus. CDF has intermixed different \ngroups of residents—COVID-positive residents, residents who should be quarantined because of \npotential  exposure,  newly  admitted  residents,  and  COVID-negative  residents—and  thereby \ndramatically increased the risk of exposure across the facility. CDF can have no excuse for these \nmistakes, particularly not after the nation has been living with this virus for nearly a year. \n19.  Unsurprisingly,  some  residents  who  were  intermixed  with  COVID-positive \nresidents went on to test positive for COVID themselves. \n20.  The nearly 400 residents now detained at CDF continue to be denied even the \nminimal precautions necessary to mitigate against the risks of COVID.  \n21.  Among the health services being denied to CDF residents are access to vaccines \nagainst COVID. Under the Phased COVID Vaccine Distribution Plan of the State of Maryland and \nthe Maryland Department of Health, “high-risk incarcerated individuals” were supposed to be \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 6 of 64\noffered access to COVID vaccines in Phase 1B of the plan. See “Maryland’s Phased COVID-19 \nVaccine  Distribution,”  The  Office  of  Governor  Larry  Hogan,  updated  Jan.  14,  2021 \nhttps://governor.maryland.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Phases-One-Pager-1.pdf.  Although \nMaryland has reached Phase 1B (currently the state is in Phase 1C of the Plan, see Maryland \nDepartment of Health, Maryland moves into Phase 1C of its COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan, \nopens  eligibility  to  all  residents  65  and  up  (Jan.  25,  2021) \nhttps://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/Maryland-moves-into-Phase-1C-of-its-COVID-19-\nvaccine-distribution-plan,-opens-eligibility-to-all-residents-65-and-up.aspx),  there  is  no \nindication that “high-risk incarcerated individuals” at CDF are being offered vaccinations. The \nMaryland  COVID  Vaccination  Plan  does  not  specifically  define  the  term  \n“high  risk  individuals”  but  includes  within  that  category:  “Persons  at  highest  risk  of  \ndeveloping complications from COVID (ACIP high risk conditions), including persons 65 and \nolder, staff and residents of nursing homes (SNFs), long-term care facilities (LTCFs), assisted care \nfacilities,  and  clients  of  senior  daycare  facilities  or  similar.” \nhttps://phpa.health.maryland.gov/Documents/10.19.2020_Maryland_COVID-\n19_Vaccination_Plan_CDCwm.pdf, at 13 (emphasis added). It is clear the Plan intends to include \nat least a portion of the detainees at CDF within Phase 1 because it goes on to estimate the \npopulation to be vaccinated in Maryland under the Plan in Phase 1 as including approximately \n54,460 “People in Prisons, Jails, Detention Centers and Staff.” Id.  \n22.  This  outbreak  is  a  tragedy.  It  was  entirely  foreseeable,  given  the  failure  of \nDefendants to act, and it was preventable. This outbreak will recur absent intervention from this \nCourt. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 7 of 64\n23.  The nation has been living with the pandemic for nearly a year. There are well-\nestablished guidelines and procedures that prevent the type of disaster that has unfolded at CDF. \nCDF has failed to follow those guidelines and procedures. \n24.  By maintaining these conditions, the Defendants have needlessly exposed the \npeople detained there to a highly infectious and potentially fatal disease. This violates Plaintiffs’ \nFifth / Fourteenth and Eighth Amendment rights. (The Fifth Amendment protects federal pretrial \ndetainees. See, e.g., Cunningham v. Wilson, 326 F. App’x 948, 949 (7th Cir. 2009). The Fourteenth \nAmendment protects state pretrial detainees. See, e.g., Hill v. Nicodemus, 979 F.2d 987, 990 (4th \nCir. 1992). Because the pretrial detainees in this case are detained in federal cases at a state-run \nfacility, Plaintiffs refer to these claims as “Fifth / Fourteenth Amendment” claims throughout.) \n25.  Plaintiffs seek class-wide relief requiring CDF to take the necessary steps to \nsafeguard residents’ health and safety—on behalf of all CDF residents. A subset of Plaintiffs also \nrequests a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 for residents whose age or underlying \nmedical conditions make them particularly vulnerable to severe illness and death from COVID \n(the “Medically Vulnerable Subclass”).   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n26.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a), and 2241(a). \nThis Court has jurisdiction over the Medically Vulnerable Subclass’s petition for a writ of habeas \ncorpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241.  \n27.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because the events giving \nrise to the claims asserted in this complaint occurred in this District. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 8 of 64\nPARTIES \n28.  Plaintiff SEDRIC CATCHINGS is detained pretrial at CDF. Mr. Catchings has not \nyet tested positive for COVID. Mr. Catchings has a preexisting medical condition that makes him \nmore vulnerable to COVID, and he has been unnecessarily exposed to positive or potentially \npositive residents of CDF on multiple occasions. Mr. Catchings’ recreation time is on a unit in \nwhich neither masks nor social distancing are encouraged, let alone enforced. It is only a matter of \ntime before he contracts COVID, absent intervention. \n29.  Plaintiff CHARLES COUSER is detained pretrial at CDF. Mr. Couser recently \ntested positive for COVID for the second time in the last year. Mr. Couser was transferred to the \nJI building down the street from CDF after he tested positive in CDF in 2021. At the JI building, \nMr. Couser suffered from severe symptoms of COVID. Since being transferred back to CDF, Mr. \nCouser has gone without cleaning supplies, and has observed individuals continue to walk around \nthe facility without masks. \n30.  Plaintiff COLLIN DAVIS is detained pretrial at CDF. Mr. Davis has a preexisting \nmedical condition that makes him more vulnerable to COVID. He has tested positive for COVID \ntwice at CDF: first in September and again in January. Mr. Davis was unnecessarily exposed to \npositive residents in January after a negative test; he then tested positive again himself shortly \nafter. Mr. Davis has been denied prescribed medications since testing positive again and was told \nto  take  another  resident’s  medications  on  multiple  occasions—ones  to  treat  diabetes  and \nhypertension, neither of which Mr. Davis suffers from. Mr. Davis’ health has been put into \njeopardy again and again. \n31.  Plaintiff ALLEN LAMIN is detained pretrial at CDF. Mr. Lamin has a preexisting \nmedical condition. He recently tested positive for COVID. Mr. Lamin started exhibiting symptoms \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 9 of 64\nof COVID in January, prior to the facility locking down. Mr. Lamin was fatigued and couldn’t get \nout of bed. CDF transferred Mr. Lamin to JI, where there were only intermittent checks on his vital \nsymptoms. Mr. Lamin was then transferred back to CDF, to a unit where neither masks nor social \ndistancing are required or enforced. \n32.  Plaintiff SIRRON LITTLE is detained pretrial at CDF. Mr. Little has a preexisting \nmedical condition that makes him more vulnerable to COVID. He has not yet tested positive for \nCOVID. Mr. Little has a preexisting condition that makes him more vulnerable to COVID. Mr. \nLittle has been locked in a cell with another resident for days, during which time his cellmate was \nsuffering from obvious symptoms of COVID. His cellmate was later rushed to the hospital because \nof COVID symptoms—after days of being locked in a cell with Mr. Little. Mr. Little is not given \ncleaning supplies to sanitize his cell and must use ripped up towels to clean—towels that he uses \nfor showering.  \n33.  Plaintiff TAIWO MOULTRIE is detained pretrial at CDF. Mr. Moultrie has a \npreexisting medical condition that makes him more vulnerable to COVID. He recently tested \npositive for COVID after being unnecessarily exposed to two positive residents when CDF was \nmoving Mr. Moultrie around the facility. Mr. Moultrie has preexisting conditions that make him \nmore vulnerable to COVID. Mr. Moultrie then tested positive himself. As of February 11, Mr. \nMoultrie’s unit is on 23-hour per day lockdown. During the one hour when residents are out of \ntheir cells, residents intermingle and are not wearing masks. \n34.  Plaintiff JOSEPH SPEED is detained at CDF pending sentencing. Mr. Speed has a \npreexisting medical condition that makes him more vulnerable to COVID. He recently tested \npositive for COVID. Mr. Speed has preexisting medical conditions that make him more vulnerable \nto COVID. Prior to testing positive for COVID, Mr. Speed was given two inhalers to treat his \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 10 of 64\npreexisting condition. CDF transferred him to JI, but they did not bring his inhalers; instead, Mr. \nSpeed went multiple days without them. Mr. Speed was subjected to indoor temperatures of 55 \ndegrees or below while at JI. \n35.  Plaintiff HOWARD THOMAS is detained post-conviction at CDF. Mr. Thomas \nhas a preexisting condition for which he requires medical care. CDF has delayed or denied Mr. \nThomas care. Mr. Thomas has been unnecessarily exposed to COVID on multiple occasions and \nwas moved into a unit in which positive residents were moving around the common areas and \ntouching the same surfaces (including phones) as Mr. Thomas. When Mr. Thomas was moved into \nthe unit and the positive residents moved out, nobody from CDF cleaned or sanitized the positive \nresidents’ cells before new residents moved in. Mr. Thomas has also been subjected to multiple \n23-hour a day lockdowns, without any explanation why these lockdowns were taking placing. \n36.  Defendant CALVIN WILSON is the Warden of CDF. He is sued in his official \ncapacity. \n37.  Defendant ROBERT L. GREEN is the Secretary of DPSCS. He is sued in his \nofficial capacity. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  COVID Is Highly Infectious and Dangerous \n38.  Dr. Carlos Franco-Paredes and Dr. Meyer have detailed at length the ramifications \nof COVID on the circumstances of this case. See generally Expert Declaration of Carlos Franco-\nParedes, M.D., M.P.H. (February 15, 2021) (“Franco-Paredes Decl.”); Meyer Decl. Their opinions \nare grounded primarily in the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for \ndetention facilities, which were distributed at the beginning of the pandemic. See Ex. JJ.  \n39.  Dr. Franco-Paredes is an Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of \nColorado and Director of the Infectious Diseases Fellowship Program there. He served as a \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 11 of 64\nconsultant with the World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland, where he participated in the \ndevelopment  of  a  global  action  plan  for  the  deployment  of  pandemic  influenza  vaccine. \nCurriculum Vitae of Carlos Franco-Paredes, M.D., M.P.H, appended to Franco-Paredes Decl.  \n40.  Dr. Meyer is an Associate Professor of Medicine at Yale School of Medicine and \nAssistant Clinical Professor of Nursing at Yale School of Nursing in New Haven, Connecticut. \nShe is board-certified in Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases and Addiction Medicine.

See Curriculum Vitae of Dr. Jaimie Meyer, appended to Meyer Decl.  \n41.  As set out in the attached declaration by Dr. Carlos Franco-Paredes, the novel \ncoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is the causal pathogen that causes COVID-19, which is an extremely \ninfectious and potentially deadly virus. The United States has the largest number of cases and \ndeaths in the world, with more than 27 million cases and close to 500,000 deaths as of mid-\nFebruary 2021. Franco-Paredes Decl. ¶ 7; see also COVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for \nSystems  Science  and  Engineering  (CSSE)  at  Johns  Hopkins  University  (JHU), \nhttps://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html (containing an interactive map with data updated daily).    \nCOVID has created a global health crisis that has led to the adoption and implementation of \nunprecedented mitigation strategies around the world, including the canceling of public events, \nclosing schools and businesses, and lockdowns across the world. Franco-Paredes Decl. ¶ 7. See \nalso Meyer Decl. ¶¶ 8-12.  \n42.  The catastrophic consequences of the current COVID pandemic is due to two major \nfactors: (a) the transmissibility of the infection and (b) the severity of the disease in the human \npopulation.

People  with  the  following  underlying  medical  conditions  are  considered  at \nincreased risk of severe illness and death should they be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Franco-\nParedes Decl. ¶ 10): \na.  Cancer; \nb.  Chronic kidney disease; \nc.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); \nd.  Immunocompromised from solid organ transplant; \ne.  Obesity (with a body mass index (BMI) of 30+); \nf.  Serious heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or \ncardiomyopathies;  \ng.  Sickle cell disease; \nh.  Type II diabetes mellitus.  \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 13 of 64\n45.  People with the following underlying medical conditions may be at an increased \nrisk for severe illness from COVID-19 (Franco-Paredes Decl. ¶ 11): \na.  Asthma (moderate to severe); \nb.  Cerebrovascular disease (affecting blood vessels and blood supply to the brain); \nc.  Cystic fibrosis; \nd.  Hypertension; \ne.  Immunocompromised  from  blood  or  bone  marrow  transplant,  immune \ndeficiencies,  HIV,  use  of  corticosteroids,  or  other  immune-suppressing \nmedications; \nf.  Neurologic conditions, such as dementia; \ng.  Liver disease; \nh.  Pregnancy; \ni.  Pulmonary fibrosis (having damaged or scarred lung tissue); \nj.  Smoking; \nk.  Thalassemia; \nl.  Type I diabetes mellitus. \n \n46.  The cumulative rate of COVID infection in the United States is 8,201 cases per \n100,000 people with an overall case fatality rate of 142 per 100,000. See Franco-Paredes Decl. ¶ \n12; Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), CDC COVID Data Tracker, Compare Trends in \nCOVID-19 Cases and Deaths in States in the US, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nhttps://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#compare-trends (as of February 12, 2021). \n47.  In the United States, the COVID-associated hospitalization rate among patients \nidentified  through  the  Coronavirus  Disease  2019  (COVID-19)-Associated  Hospitalization \nSurveillance  Network  (COVID-NET)  has  been  as  high  as  4.6  per  100,000  population.  \nHospitalization rates increase with age, with a rate of 0.3 in persons aged 0-4 years, 0.1 in those \naged 5-17 years, 2.5 in those aged 18-49 years, 7.4 in those aged 50-64 years, and 13.8 in those \naged ≥ 65 years. Rates were highest among persons aged 65 years or older, ranging from 12.2 in \nthose aged 65-74 years to 17.2 in those aged 85 years or older. More than half (54.4%) of \nhospitalizations occurred among men; COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates were higher \namong males than females (5.1 versus 4.1 per 100,000 population, respectively). See Franco-\n13 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 14 of 64\nParedes Decl. ¶ 13; Shikha Garg, Lindsay Kim, Michael Whitaker, et al., Hospitalization Rates \nand Characteristics of Patients Hospitalized with Laboratory-Confirmed Coronavirus Disease \n2019 — COVID-NET, 14 States, March 1-30, 2020. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report \n(MMWR) 2020, 69:458-464, http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6915e3. \n48.  Approximately 90% of hospital admissions due to COVID have occurred among \nindividuals with underlying medical conditions. The most commonly reported underlying medical \nconditions of patients with COVID-19 were hypertension (49.7%), obesity (48.3%), chronic lung \ndisease (34.6%), diabetes mellitus (28.3%), and cardiovascular disease (27.8%). Among patients \naged 18-49 years, obesity was the most prevalent underlying condition, followed by chronic lung \ndisease (primarily asthma) and diabetes mellitus. Among patients aged 50-64 years, obesity was \nmost prevalent, followed by hypertension and diabetes mellitus; and among those aged 65 years \nor older, hypertension was most prevalent, followed by cardiovascular disease and diabetes \nmellitus. See Franco-Paredes Decl. ¶ 14; Marie Killerby, Ruth Link-Gelles, Sarah Haight, et al. \nCharacteristics Associated with Hospitalization Among Patients with COVID-19 — Metropolitan \nAtlanta, Georgia, March–April 2020, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) 2020. \n69:790-794, http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6925e1. \n49.  For people with risk factors, COVID can severely damage lung tissue, which \nrequires an extensive period of rehabilitation, and in some cases, can cause long-term respiratory \ndysfunction. There is preliminary evidence that persons with COVID, who are recovering from a \nsevere version of the disease and who developed extensive pulmonary disease including Acute \nRespiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), may have long-term sequelae similar to other infectious \npathogens evolving in a similar pattern including long-term cognitive impairment, psychological \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 15 of 64\nmorbidities, neuromuscular weakness, pulmonary dysfunction, and reduced quality of life. See \nFranco-Paredes Decl. ¶ 15. \n50.  Dr. Meyer points out that most people (80%) who become infected with COVID-\n19 will develop a mild upper respiratory infection, but serious illness occurs in up to 16% of cases, \nincluding death. See Meyer Decl. ¶ 9. \n51.  Dr. Franco-Paredes points out that, similar to influenza infection, acute lung injury \nand ARDS are most likely caused by the respiratory epithelial membrane dysfunction leading to \nARDS. The resultant tissue hypoxia is responsible and potential concomitant bacterial sepsis \ncontribute  to  multi-organ  dysfunction  and  death.  If  a  patient  with  COVID-19  develops \nmyocarditis, cardiogenic shock caused by fulminant myocarditis may also contribute to the overall \noccurrence of multiple organ failure. See Franco-Paredes Decl. ¶ 17. Death in COVID-19 infection \nis usually due to pneumonia and sepsis. See id. ¶ 9. \n52.  The care of people who are infected with COVID-19 depends on how seriously \nthey are ill. See Meyer Decl. ¶ 10; Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with \nConfirmed Coronavirus Disease, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (updated Feb. 16, \n2021),  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-\npatients.html. People with mild symptoms may not require hospitalization but may continue to be \nclosely monitored at home. People with moderate symptoms may require hospitalization for \nsupportive  care,  including  intravenous  fluids  and  supplemental  oxygen.  People  with  severe \nsymptoms may require ventilation and intravenous antibiotics. While over 420 clinical trials of \ntreatments for COVID-19 have been conducted and reviewed by the FDA, just 8 have received \nemergency use authorization approval and a single treatment (remdesivir) has received regular \nFDA approval. See Meyer Decl. ¶ 10; Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program (CTAP), U.S. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 16 of 64\nFood & Drug Administration (updated Jan. 31, 2021), https://www.fda.gov/drugs/coronavirus-\ncovid-19-drugs/coronavirus-treatment-acceleration-program-ctap#dashboard (last visited Feb. 20, \n2021). Only a single medication (bamlinivimab) is an option for people prior to hospitalization \nand this is given as an intravenous infusion. This means that, nearly one year into the global \npandemic, we still have relatively  few treatment options  available  for people who become \nseriously ill. See Meyer Decl. ¶ 10. \n53.  The rapid development of highly effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 promises \nan end to the pandemic. To date, two mRNA vaccines (by Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna) have \nreceived FDA approval. See Meyer Decl. ¶ 11; Carl Zimmer, Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker Updates: \nThe  Latest,  The  New  York  Times, \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html  (containing \ninteractive map with data updated daily (last visited Feb. 20, 2021). \n54.  Until vaccination of the majority is achieved, required COVID-19 prevention \nstrategies include containment and mitigation. Containment includes intensive hand hygiene \npractices, decontamination and cleaning of surfaces, identifying and isolating people who are ill \nand quarantining people who have had contact with people who are ill, and the use of personal \nprotective equipment. Meyer Decl. ¶ 12. \n55.  As described below, jails and prisons are often under-resourced to meet the demand \nfor these strategies. As COVID-19 spreads in the community, public health demands mitigation \nstrategies, which involves social distancing to protect those most vulnerable to disease. Jails and \nprisons, especially when conditions are crowded, are often unable to adequately provide social \ndistancing or meet mitigation recommendations. Meyer Decl. ¶ 12. \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 17 of 64\nB.  Jails and Prisons Are Exceedingly Vulnerable to COVID Spread \n \n56.  The current outbreaks of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 inside of correctional \nfacilities across the United States highlight the ease of transmission of COVID-19 inside these \nfacilities. See Franco-Paredes Decl. ¶ 20. \n57.  Detention and incarceration of any kind requires large groups of people to be \nconfined together in a tight space. To contain the spread of the disease in such a setting, infection \nprevention protocols must be meticulously followed. See Franco-Paredes Decl. ¶ 21. \n58.  The number of private rooms in a typical jail or prison facility is insufficient to \ncomply with the recommended airborne/droplet isolation guidelines. These infection prevention \nprotocols include “social distancing” measures, where individuals maintain a distance of at least \nsix feet from each other, mask wearing, and frequent hand-washing and other good hygiene \npractices. These protocols apply to both incarcerated and non-incarcerated individuals. In the \ncarceral setting, these protocols would require, for example, that individuals sleep one person per \ncell, rather than in shared cells. These measures are necessary to prevent spread of COVID-19 \namong otherwise healthy people and are imperative for high-risk individuals. See Franco-Paredes \nDecl. ¶ 22. \n59.  Another consideration complicated by the carceral setting is the ability of the novel \ncoronavirus to survive for extended periods of time on materials that are highly prevalent in \nprisons, such as metals and other non-porous surfaces. Current outbreak protocols require frequent \ndisinfection and decontamination of all surfaces of the facility, which is exceedingly difficult given \nthe large number of incarcerated individuals, frequent interactions between incarcerated persons \nand staff, and regularity with which staff move in and out of the facility. See Franco-Paredes Decl. \n¶ 23. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 18 of 64\n60.  Responding to COVID-19 outbreaks  in correctional facilities  calls  for  highly \ntrained staff to correctly and quickly institute and enforce isolation and quarantine procedures, and \nrequires training on the appropriate utilization of personal protective equipment. It is essential that \nnursing and medical staff be trained in infection control prevention practices, implementing triage \nprotocols,  and  the  medical  management  of  suspected,  probable,  and  confirmed  cases  of \ncoronavirus infection. This same personnel has to be prepared to initiate the management of \npatients with severe COVID-19 disease. See Franco-Paredes Decl. ¶ 24. \n61.  According to the COVID-19 Prison Project, there are 383,183 cases of COVID-19 \nin jails and prisons with 2,311 deaths. Staff in correctional facilities also has been significantly \naffected including 92,281 cases and 144 deaths. See Franco-Paredes Decl. ¶ 13; National COVID-\n19 Statistics, The COVID Prison Project, https://covidprisonproject.com/data/national-overview/ \nhttps://covidprisonproject.com/data/national-overview/ (as of February 11, 2021). The risk posed \nby infectious diseases in jails and prisons is significantly higher than in the community, in terms \nof risk of transmission, exposure, and harm to individuals who become infected. To date, more \nthan 612,000 people who are incarcerated have been infected with COVID-19 and at least 2,700 \npeople  who  reside  and  work  inside  facilities  have  died.  See  Meyer  Decl.  ¶  13;  Zimmer, \nCoronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count, The New York Times, supra. Prisons and \njails represent some of the largest clusters of cases in the U.S. \n62.  Prisons and jails are not isolated from communities. Staff, visitors, contractors, and \nvendors pass between communities and facilities and can bring infectious diseases into facilities. \nMoreover, rapid turnover of jail and prison populations means that people often cycle between \nfacilities and communities. People often need to be transported to and from facilities to attend \ncourt and move between facilities. See Meyer Decl. ¶ 14. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 19 of 64\n63.  Congregate settings such as jails and prisons enable rapid spread of infectious \ndiseases  that  are transmitted person  to person,  especially those passed by  droplets  through \ncoughing and sneezing. When people must share bathrooms, showers, and other common areas, \nthe opportunities for transmission are even greater. When infectious diseases are transmitted from \nperson to person by droplets, the best initial strategy is to practice social distancing. When jailed \nor imprisoned, people have much less of an opportunity to protect themselves by social distancing \nthan they would in the community. For many in jail or prison, social distancing is a physical \nimpossibility. Spaces within jails and prisons are often also poorly ventilated, which promotes \nhighly efficient spread of diseases through droplets. Placing someone in such a setting therefore \ndramatically reduces their ability to protect themselves from being exposed to and contracting \ninfectious diseases. See Meyer Decl. ¶ 15. \n64.  During an infectious disease outbreak, people can protect themselves by washing \nhands. Jails and prisons do not provide adequate opportunities to exercise necessary hygiene \nmeasures, such as frequent handwashing (for at least 20 seconds) or use of alcohol-based sanitizers \nwhen handwashing is unavailable. Jails and prisons are often under-resourced and ill-equipped \nwith sufficient hand soap and alcohol-based sanitizers for people detained in and working in these \nsettings.  High-touch  surfaces  (doorknobs,  light  switches,  etc.)  should  also  be  cleaned  and \ndisinfected regularly with bleach to prevent virus spread, but this often is not done in jails and \nprisons because of a lack of cleaning supplies and lack of people available and trained to perform \nnecessary cleaning procedures. See Meyer Decl. ¶ 16.  \n65.  Jails and prisons are often poorly equipped to diagnose and manage infectious \ndisease outbreaks. Some jails and prisons lack onsite medical facilities or 24-hour medical care.  \nThe medical facilities at jails and prisons are almost never sufficiently equipped to handle large \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 20 of 64\noutbreaks  of  infectious  diseases  because  of  space  limitations.  During  an  infectious  disease \noutbreak, a containment strategy requires people who are ill with symptoms to be isolated and that \ncaregivers have access to personal protective equipment, including gloves, masks, gowns, and eye \nprotection (face shields or goggles). Jails and prisons are often under-resourced and ill-equipped \nto provide sufficient personal protective equipment for people who are incarcerated and caregiving \nstaff, increasing the risk for everyone in the facility of a widespread outbreak. Resources will \nbecome exhausted rapidly and any beds available will soon be at capacity. This makes both \ncontaining the illness and caring for those who have become infected much more difficult. See \nMeyer Decl. ¶ 17. \n66.  People incarcerated in jails and prisons are more susceptible to acquiring and \nexperiencing complications from infectious diseases than the population in the community. See \nMeyer Decl. ¶ 19; Active case finding for communicable diseases in prisons, The Lancet , Vol. \n391;  2186  (June  2,  2018),  https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-\n6736(18)31251-0/fulltext. This is because people in jails and prisons are more likely than people \nin the community to have chronic underlying health conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, \nchronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, and lower immune systems from HIV that put them at \nrisk of severe infection and death. See Meyer Decl. ¶ 19. \n67.  Jails and prisons lack access to vital community resources to diagnose and manage \ninfectious diseases. Jails and prisons do not have access to community health resources that can \nbe crucial in identifying and managing widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases. This includes \naccess to testing equipment, laboratories, and medications. See Meyer Decl. ¶ 20. \n68.  Jails and prisons often need to rely on outside facilities (hospitals, emergency \ndepartments) to provide intensive medical care given that the level of care they can provide in the \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 21 of 64\nfacility itself is typically relatively limited. During an epidemic, this will not be possible, as those \noutside facilities will likely be at or over capacity themselves. See Meyer Decl. ¶ 21. \n69.  As an outbreak spreads through jails, prisons, and communities, medical personnel \nbecome sick and do not show up to work. Absenteeism poses substantial safety and security risk \nto both the people inside the facilities and the public. Absenteeism also means that facilities can \nbecome dangerously understaffed with healthcare providers. This increases a number of risks and \ncan dramatically reduce the level of care provided. As health systems inside facilities are taxed, \npeople with chronic underlying physical and mental health conditions and serious medical needs \nmay not be able to receive the routine care they need for these conditions. As supply chains become \ndisrupted during a global pandemic, the availability of medicines and food may be limited. See \nMeyer Decl. ¶ 22. \n70.  Prisons  were  designed  to  contain  people,  not  diseases.  When  even  the  most \nsophisticated  hospital  systems  in  this  country  have  been  overwhelmed  by  the  COVID-19 \npandemic, it will be impossible for prison health systems to contain it. This is especially true when \nemergency preparedness plans are underdeveloped. These risks have all borne out during the \ncurrent pandemic of COVID-19. See Meyer Decl. ¶ 23. \nC.  Lockdowns are an Inappropriate Response to COVID \n71.  Dr. Meyer and Dr. Craig Haney have detailed at length how and why lockdowns \nand solitary confinement may harm, not protect, residents. See generally Meyer Decl.; Expert \nDeclaration of Craig Haney, Ph.D. (February 18, 2021) (“Haney Decl.”). \n72.  Dr. Haney is Distinguished Professor of Psychology and UC Presidential Chair at \nthe University of California, Santa Cruz, located in Santa Cruz, California, where he engages in \nresearch applying social psychological principles to legal settings including the assessment of the \npsychological  effects  of  living  and  working  in  institutional  environments,  especially  the \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 22 of 64\npsychological effects of incarceration. He has a Ph.D. in psychology and a J.D. degree, both \nawarded by Stanford University. He was a co-founder and co-director of the UC Criminal Justice \n& Health Consortium—a collaborative effort of researchers, experts and advocates from across \nthe University  of California system working to bring  evidence-based health and healthcare \nsolutions to criminal justice reform in California and nationwide. See Curriculum Vitae of Dr. \nCraig Haney, appended to Haney Decl.  \n73.  Disciplinary segregation or solitary confinement is not an appropriate disease \ncontainment strategy. Beyond the known detrimental mental health effects of solitary confinement, \nisolation of people who are ill in solitary confinement results in decreased medical attention and \nincreased risk of death. In addition, if solitary confinement is a carceral facility’s response to \nCOVID-19, people who are ill will be deterred from reporting their symptoms, resulting in their \nincreased risk of severe disease and death and ongoing spread to others. See Meyer Decl. ¶ 18.  \n74.  As Dr. Haney explains, “[p]rocedures that impose extended periods of isolation or \nrestrict hygiene options (such as showers) are inappropriate, ill-conceived, and counter-productive \nfor several reasons. In fact, they could very likely exacerbate rather than limit or alleviate the \nspread of COVID-19. For one, housing units essentially turn into onerous lockdown units, which \ngreatly increase the psychological stress under which prisoners live, potentially leading to mental \nand physical deterioration, interpersonal conflicts, and self-harm and suicidality. The fact that \nprisoners may be double-celled during these lockdowns does not mitigate the negative effects of \ntheir essentially around-the-clock in-cell confinement. In fact, double-celling may exacerbate these \neffects because of the interpersonal tensions and stressors that such unavoidably close around-the-\nclock contact generates.” Haney Decl. ¶ 18. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 23 of 64\n75.  Lockdown units are often used in ways that are essentially identical to the solitary \nconfinement-type housing that has been shown to place prisoners at significant risk of grave harm \n(including damage that is permanent, even fatal). Thus, there is a substantial literature on the \nadverse psychological and physical effects of this kind of isolation. This literature establishes a \nrange of damaging consequences that come about when prisoners and others are subjected to the \nkinds of conditions that now prevail throughout this facility. See Haney Decl. ¶ 19. \n76.  Although  the  adverse  effects  of  isolated  confinement  are  widespread,  and \njeopardize  the  physical  and  psychological  well-being  of  everyone  exposed  to  them,  this  is \nespecially true for prisoners with pre-existing mental health conditions. They are particularly likely \nto decompensate, suffer worsening depression, and even engage in self-harming and suicidal \nbehavior in response to social isolation. See Haney Decl. ¶ 21. \n77.  According to Dr. Haney, “[f]or these reasons, psychologically vulnerable prisoners \nshould be excluded from all forms of prison isolation (i.e., lockdowns and solitary confinement). \nThis is particularly true for prisoners with serious mental illness, including major affective \ndisorders  (like  bipolar  disorders  and  major  depressive  disorder),  schizophrenia,  and  other \npsychotic disorders. If they cannot be, then they must be given access to enhanced psychological \nservices. Yet, based on his many years of studying correctional systems and practices across the \ncountry, ameliorative measures such as increased treatment and out of cell time are often among \nthe first things that are suspended as the prison system diverts staff to address emergencies (such \nas the pandemic).” Haney Decl. ¶ 22 \n78.  According to Dr. Haney, “[i]nstead of preemptive lockdowns, jails and prisons \nshould institute such lockdowns only where medically necessary to resolve discrete issues, such \nas sanitizing dorms or contact tracing of an infected prisoner. If such lockdowns are employed, for \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 24 of 64\nthese limited purposes, they should be reasonably time-limited. Staff also should communicate \nthat time-limit to the prisoners who are affected. Moreover, in extreme cases in which lockdowns \nare employed, the jail or prison should ensure that inmates are given enhanced access to resources \nto protect their mental health, such as reading material and adequate access to phones. In addition, \nthe jail or prison staff should regularly communicate with and monitor the physical and mental \nhealth of prisoners who are on lockdown.” Haney Decl. ¶ 26.  \nD.  Defendants Have Been Given Multiple Warnings of the Dangers of Not Responding \nSwiftly and Appropriately \n79.  The experiences of jails and prisons across the country have put Defendants on \nnotice of the dangers of COVID in detention facilities. \n80.  These experiences have also put Defendants on notice of the efficacy of vaccinating \nresidents of detention facilities, particularly vulnerable residents. \n81.  These Defendants also have actual knowledge from the multiple letters sent to them \nabout the dangers of COVID and the necessary steps required to mitigate the risk of COVID. \n82.  On March 19, 2020, a group of physicians and public health experts sent to local \ncorrections departments in Maryland a letter outlining the risks of COVID in detention facilities \nand  methods  to  mitigate  this  risk.  See  Ex.  AA;  also  available  at  https://www.aclu-\nmd.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/200319_-\n_public_health_experts_maryland_covid_jails_sign_on_letter.pdf. \n83.  On March 25, 2020, faculty members from John Hopkins sent a letter to Governor \nHogan (with a carbon copy to Defendant Green) highlighting the risks of COVID in detention \nfacilities, warning against solitary confinement, urging the development of plans for prevention \nand management, ensuring the supply of soap and hand sanitizer, and procedures to limit the spread \nof  COVID.  See  Ex.  BB;  also  available  at  https://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-\n24 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 25 of 64\ninstitutes/center-for-public-health-and-human-\nrights/_pdf/Faculty%20Letter%20COVID%2019.pdf \n84.  On May 6, 2020, the ACLU of Maryland sent to Governor Hogan and Defendant \nGreen a letter emphasizing the risk of COVID in detention facilities, outlining necessary testing \nprocedures to prevent an outbreak from spreading. See Ex. CC; also available at https://www.aclu-\nmd.org/sites/default/files/letter_to_gov_and_doc_secretary_re_testing_050620.pdf \n85.  On February 2, 2021, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law sent to \nDefendants Wilson and Green a letter outlining the current problems at CDF after the current \noutbreak, along with a concrete set of requests that CDF immediately implement. See Ex. DD; also \navailable  at  https://lawyerscommittee.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210202-CDF-COVID-\nLCCR-letter.pdf. The letter also noted that 22 clients of the Federal Public Defender for the District \nof  Maryland  appeared  to  be  eligible  for  vaccination.  The  letter  requested  a  response  from \nDefendants. Neither Defendant responded. \n86.  Warden Wilson personally walks around the facility and has witnessed residents \nbeing moved and potentially intermixed with other cohorts. Resident Declaration J (February 8, \n2021 Declaration of Sedric Catchings) (“Res. Decl. J”) ¶ 12 (“On Tuesday, February 2, they came \nto pack up the negative people to send back to the E unit, where I started quarantine when I got to \nCDF. The people who were negative were moved. The warden was there when they were moving \nus. I asked to use the phone to talk to my lawyer to talk about the situation. He told me no.”). \n87.  The CDC guidelines for detention facilities have also put Defendants on notice of \nthe deficiencies at CDF. \n88.  Multiple residents have raised CDF’s abject failures with staff and have been \nignored. A woman who was a new admission to CDF, for example, was placed in a unit with \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 26 of 64\npositive male residents who were symptomatic. Two symptomatic male residents were on each \nside of her cell. When she objected to her being placed in the unit and questioned why it made \nsense for an apparently negative woman to be placed with positive, symptomatic men, CDF told \nher “not to worry.” Resident Declaration M (February 18, 2021 Declaration of Juliet Cervellon) \n(“Res. Decl. M”) ¶ 19. \n89.  The resident was right to worry. CDF did not listen and in fact exposed another \nwoman, newly arrested, to a unit full of COVID-positive men about a month later. Resident \nDeclaration H (February 13, 2021 Declaration of Collin Davis) (“Res. Decl. H”) ¶¶ 20, 22, 28 \n(“On February 9, they came back and told me I was positive. . . They moved me to a unit they \ncalled the ‘cadre.’ . . . CDF moved a new person into the cadre last night, on February 12. She’s \nbrand new to the facility. I know she’s brand new because I spoke to her.”) \nE.  DPSCS and CDF Have Wildly Mishandled the COVID Pandemic and Thereby \nCaused a COVID Disaster Within the Facility  \n90.  The first case of COVID at the Chesapeake Detention Center (“CDF”) was reported \nin the spring of 2020. \n91.  Across all DPSCS facilities, over 50,000 residents are currently positive. COVID-\n19, Maryland Department of Health, available at https://news.maryland.gov/dpscs/covid-19/. \na.  CDF’s Failure to Plan for Introduction of Virus to the Facility \n92.  As explained by Dr. Meyer, CDC guidelines recommend that facilities plan for \ndifferent  outbreak  scenarios  and  instruct  facilities  to  “consider  how  the  facility’s  housing \noperations could be modified for multiple test result scenarios (e.g., if testing reveals that 10%, \n30%, 50% or more of incarcerated or detained persons test positive for SARS-CoV-2).”). Interim \nConsiderations for SARS-CoV-2 Testing in Correctional and Detention Facilities, CDC, available \nat  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/testing.html. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 27 of 64\nThese different scenarios enable rapid responses to contain and control COVID and to cohort \nindividuals with different infection statuses appropriately. See Meyer Decl. ¶ 27. \n93.  Although the pandemic has been ongoing since March 2020, and in spite of clear \nevidence that the risk posed by infectious diseases in jails and prisons is significantly higher than \nin the community, CDF has utterly failed to create a comprehensive approach—with plans for \ndifference scenarios—to handle an increase in positive cases among the resident population. See \nMeyer Decl. ¶¶ 13, 25, 27. \n94.  As explained by Dr. Meyer, this lack of planning is evident in CDF’s rapidly \nchanging response to the crisis from one day to the next. See Meyer Decl. ¶ 27(m); Ex. HH \n(Government’s Response to Judicial Order, United States v. Moore, Case No. 1:20-cr-00430-RDB \n(D. Md. Feb. 1, 2021)).  \n95.  For instance, CDF had to abandon its plan to use one off-site facility (the “Health \nMonitoring Facility”) for COVID-positive residents when bed space quickly ran out. This failure \nto create a comprehensive approach is in clear contravention of public health and scientific \nguidance for the appropriate management of a pandemic in a detention facility.  \n96.  This lack of planning has also resulted in intermixing between different groups of \nresidents. As described by Dr. Meyer, and as recounted by multiple residents, COVID-negative \nresidents have been forced into living quarters with COVID-positive residents. Meyer Decl. ¶ 27. \nCOVID-negative residents have had to move into COVID-positive residents’ cells moments after \nthe COVID-positive resident departed, without any ability to clean or sanitize the clean. E.g., \nResident Declaration E (February 11, 2021 Supplemental Declaration of Taiwo Moultrie) (“Res. \nDecl. E”) ¶¶ 9, 11 (“One of those two guys said, ‘Be careful, I have COVID.’ I asked what cell he \nwas in. He said he was from cell 32. . . . They put me into cell 32 right after those two guys left. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 28 of 64\nNobody cleaned it out before they put me in the cell. Nobody cleaned it or sprayed it or anything. \nI couldn’t believe they were trying to put me in this cell.”). \n97.  CDF’s complete lack of planning is also evident in the practices the facility engaged \nin during 2020, all of which have continued until today.   \nb.  Mismanagement in 2020 \n98.  In  2020,  CDF  housed  COVID-positive  residents  in  cells  alongside  COVID-\nnegative residents in the intake unit. Resident Declaration D (August 14, 2020 Declaration of \nTaiwo Moultrie) (“Res. Decl. D”) ¶¶ 3-6, 12. \n99.  Upon removal of the COVID-positive residents, CDF not only failed to quarantine \nor test the residents who had been exposed to the virus; for several days, the facility did not even \nbother to take the temperatures of residents who were exposed. Res. Decl. D ¶ 8. \n100.  Indeed, exposed intake residents were permitted to join regular recreation time \nwithout regard to the fact that they had been exposed to the deadly and highly contagious virus. \nRes. Decl. D ¶¶ 9-10, 18. \n101.  Likewise, intake residents who were exposed to COVID-positive residents were \ntransferred back into the general population less than 14 days after being exposed to the virus. Res. \nDecl. D ¶ 10. \n102.  In 2020, two CDF residents in a unit within the facility who experienced symptoms \nwere tested for COVID. After these individuals tested positive, they were permitted to use the \nshared telephones, during normal recreation time, while non-symptomatic residents who had not \nbeen tested for COVID were out of their cells, before being removed from the unit. CDF failed to \nclean or sanitize the telephones or other surfaces these COVID-positive residents touched after \nreceiving positive test results. Res. Decl. D ¶¶ 15-16, 19. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 29 of 64\n103.  Residents  left  in  this  unit—who  were  exposed  to  these  two COVID-positive \nresidents—were not given COVID tests, even when they requested them. Res. Decl. D ¶¶ 20-21. \n104.  Staff at CDF never tried to find out if residents on the unit who were exposed to \nthese two COVID-positive residents were experiencing symptoms, nor did staff take temperatures \nof the exposed residents or engage in any attempt at contact tracing. Id. \n105.  CDF staff likewise failed to provide soap to exposed residents, even when residents \nrequested soap. Res. Decl. D ¶¶ 25-27. \n106.  CDF’s refusal to put into place protocols that were followed throughout the facility \nlaid the groundwork for the disaster that overtook CDF in early 2021.   \nc.  Moving into 2021: Intermixing Among Cohorts and Other Individuals \n107.  One of CDF’s biggest failings since this outbreak began is in its complete inability \nor unwillingness to separate residents into different groups and to reduce the risk of spreading \nCOVID. This process is called “cohorting.” \n108.  As described by Dr. Meyer (Meyer Decl. ¶ 27(l)), effective cohorting involves \nseparating people into four homogenous groups based on their known disease status: \n1)  Intake quarantine: People entering the facility from the community or other \nfacilities and without COVID symptoms comprise one cohort that needs to be \nactively monitored for symptoms (and ideally tested) for 14 days prior to \njoining the general population. \n2)  Medical isolation: People with confirmed COVID infection comprise a second \ncohort that needs to be medically isolated to receive medical attention. \n3)  Post-exposure quarantine: People at-risk for COVID disease because of a \nknown exposure must be separately quarantined and actively monitored for \nsymptoms (and ideally tested and re-tested) following exposure. \n4)  General  population  includes  people  not  in  quarantine  for  any  reason  or \nisolation, confirmed to be COVID-negative and/or has not had known recent \nexposure. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 30 of 64\n109.  But from 2020 and continuing to the present, CDF has—in direct contravention of \nbest practices and scientific guidance—facilitated and encouraged the intermixing of cohorts.  \n110.  For instance, one new intake joined the unit under post-exposure quarantine. See \nRes. Decl. D ¶¶ 15-19. \n111.  Residents who have not tested positive have been forced into the uncleaned cells of \nresidents who tested positive and have even crossed paths with those positive residents in the \nhallway when moving cells. Resident Declaration C (February 12, 2021 Supplemental Declaration \nof Joseph Speed) (“Res. Decl. C”) ¶ 11. \n112.  One resident was forced to remain locked in his cell with his symptomatic cellmate, \nwho “had basically every symptom of COVID.” His cellmate reported his symptoms to CDF, but \nCDF kept the two residents in the same cell. CDF indeed never took action to remove the \nsymptomatic cellmate. Instead, CDF waited until things got so bad that the cellmate was eventually \ntaken out of the unit and taken to the hospital. Resident Declaration L (February 17, 2021 \nDeclaration of Sirron Little) (“Res. Decl. L”) ¶¶ 12-14, 17-18 (“A few days before January 16, \n2021, my cellmate had symptoms. He started off with a sore throat. As the days went on, it got \nworse. He got a real bad cough and fever. He lost his appetite. He had basically every symptom of \nCOVID. He told the guards that he had symptoms a few days before January 16. . . . I thought they \nwould isolate him from me, but we both were kept in the same cell. . . . I was sleeping with my \nmask on. I tried to clean my cell. But I couldn’t really sanitize it. . . .He finally left January 17. He \nhad a real bad fever. They had to take him to the hospital because of the fever. He’s still in the \nhospital, I think.”). \n113.  As another example, one resident was left in a cell with his cellmate for two full \ndays after the cellmate had tested positive. This resident was then moved to another unit in the \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 31 of 64\nfacility, where he crossed paths with another resident who warned he had also tested positive for \nCOVID. The resident was placed in the cell previously occupied by that positive individual. The \ncell was not cleaned, nor was the resident given any materials to clean the cell himself. Res. Decl. \nE ¶¶ 4-8. \n114.  Another resident with a preexisting medical condition found himself sharing a cell \nwith a cellmate who was experiencing COVID symptoms on February 1. Again, it took two full \ndays  to  move  that  non-symptomatic  resident  with  a  preexisting  medical  condition:  around \nFebruary 3, the resident was moved to a different unit. When this resident arrived in his new unit, \nthere were two COVID-positive individuals moving freely around the common areas—spending \ntime in the common areas prior to leaving for their new unit. Once again, the COVID-positive \nindividuals’ cell was not cleaned before the non-positive resident was moved in. This resident—\nwho had been exposed to multiple COVID-positive residents at this point—was not tested for \nCOVID until February 13. He had not received the results of his test as of the time of this filing. \nResident Declaration G (February 16, 2021 Declaration of Antonio Johnson) (“Res. Decl. G”) ¶¶ \n13-16, 24.   \n115.  The problem recurs again and again. Around February 6, CDF tested residents in a \ndifferent unit of CDF. Results came back on February 9, with two individuals testing positive. \nDespite their positive results, CDF did not move those two positive residents immediately. Instead, \nthey were permitted to wander the common areas of the cramped unit and were not removed until \nthe following day, February 10. Other residents—who were exposed to the two COVID-positive \nindividuals—were not asked whether they were experiencing symptoms. Instead, the unit was \nlocked  down  on  February  10.  Resident  Declaration  K  (February  18,  2021  Supplemental \nDeclaration of Sedric Catchings) (“Res. Decl. K”) ¶¶ 2-6. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 32 of 64\n116.  Another resident—who has a preexisting condition and had already tested positive \nfor COVID one time while housed at the facility, in or around August 2020—was also tested on \nFebruary 6. This resident left his cell with his cellmate to be tested. Two days later, he visited the \nmedical area of the facility, before receiving his test results, to seek treatment for an unrelated \nwound to his finger. On February 9, the resident learned he had tested positive for a second time. \nThat day, officers locked the positive resident in his cell and tried to force his cellmate, who had \ntested negative, to return to the same cell with him. Later that day, when a new officer shift started, \nthe positive resident was released from his cell for recreation time. Officers on this shift did not \nknow he had tested positive until other officers arrived later that night to move him to the “cadre,” \nan area of CDF that has been prone to intermixing itself, as explained below. Moreover, the \npositive resident was never instructed to stay away from non-positive residents, who were released \nfor recreation time while he was out of his cell. Resident Declaration H (February 13, 2021 \nDeclaration of Collin Davis) (“Res. Decl. H”) ¶¶ 4, 19-29.  \n117.  Staff reports corroborate resident reports. According to a corrections officer, “It \nwas mass movement [February 3]. People were just walking around regularly.” Ex. EE (Outbreak \nof COVID-19 at Baltimore federal jail prompts lockdown even as feds prepare to resume grand \njury  proceedings,  Baltimore  Sun,  Feb.  3,  2020);  also  available  at \nhttps://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-md-ci-cr-federal-prison-coronavirus-20210203-\ntrvhsshvtzgdvhj52l7dc5yn2a-story.html. \n118.  CDF also failed to separate potentially positive staff from the rest of the facility. \nThat same corrections officer indicated that although CDF knew he was exposed to COVID, \nmanagement did not tell him about his exposure until forcing him to work a double shift. Id. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 33 of 64\n119.  The more recent failures at CDF are also the most striking. On February 12, 2021, \nCDF moved a female resident to the “cadre,” which housed only males at the time. The woman \nwas brand new to the facility, and at least one resident in the “cadre” had tested positive for \nCOVID. Res. Decl. H ¶ 28. Beyond her potential risk of exposure to COVID, her placement in a \nmale unit is inappropriate for health and safety in a jail. Meyer Decl. ¶ 27(l). \n120.  This failure—placing a new admit around COVID-positive individuals—is not an \nisolated incident. CDF did the same exact thing in early 2021, placing a new admission, a woman, \ninto the “cadre.” A few days later, CDF moved multiple positive male residents into the unit. These \npositive residents were clearly symptomatic, with one “coughing a lot.” Resident Declaration M \n(February 18, 2021 Declaration of Juliet Cervellon) (“Res. Decl. M”) ¶¶ 6-7. \n121.  As this woman recounted: “I asked the guards why a male was in my unit. That \ndidn’t make sense to me. That made me feel anxious and very uncomfortable . . . . The guards \nsaid there was nothing they could do. I told them I could hear that he was sick. They told me not \nto worry. I could hear him talking to his family members and saying that the reason he was in the \n‘cadre’ was because he was having symptoms of COVID and that he had to be in that unit for 14 \ndays. His cell was right next to mine—there was just a wall in between us.” Res. Decl. M ¶¶ 4, \n18-20.  \n122.  But CDF did nothing in respond to the female resident’s pleas for human decency. \nIt doesn’t take a medical expert to know that CDF was putting her life at risk. But CDF turned \nthe other cheek and repeated its approach of placing a new admit among COVID-positive men \nabout one month later. Res. Decl. H ¶ 28. See also United States v. Hodges, \n8:20−cr−00148−PX−1 (D. Md. Feb. 17, 2021) (hearing clarifying that Ms. Hodges was the \nwoman moved into the “cadre” in mid-February). \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 34 of 64\n123.  The impacts of this intermixing—as well as CDF’s denials that it was making these \ntypes of errors—is described in further detail below. \n124.  It should as no surprise that CDF has failed to meaningfully separate cohorts from \none another. By its own admission, CDF struggles to track and record the movement of various \nresidents around the facility. CDF’s “‘Dash Board’ record[,] which contains daily statistical \ninformation for the facility[,] . . . has been historically unreliable . . . .” See Ex. KK (E-mail from \nSean Wolcoff of the U.S. Marshals Service dated February 18, 2021, entitled “Today’s DPSCS \nMeeting Notes”). \n125.  In sum, cohorting is not being done effectively and poses the risk of ongoing \nexposure within the facility. Meyer Decl. ¶ 27(l).  \nd.  Failure to Contact Trace \n126.  CDF has also failed to meaningfully contact trace, often neglecting to ask residents \nexposed to positive residents whether they experienced any symptoms—let alone quarantine them \nfrom other residents. Meyer Decl. ¶ 29(d); see also, e.g., Res. Decl. D ¶ 5 (“CDF did not make me \nquarantine or isolate after that man was removed from the unit. Nobody checked my temperature, \nor asked me if I had any symptoms.”).  \ne.  Cleaning Deficiencies  \n127.  According to Dr. Meyer, until vaccination of the majority is achieved, required \nCOVID prevention strategies must include containment procedures. Meyer Decl. ¶ 12 \n128.  Containment  procedures  include  intensive  hand  hygiene  practices  and \ndecontamination and cleaning of surfaces. Meyer Decl. ¶ 12. Indeed, current outbreak protocols \nrequire frequent disinfection and decontamination of all surfaces of the facility, since the COVID \nvirus survives for extended periods of time on materials that are highly prevalent in prisons, such \nas metals and other non-porous surfaces. Franco-Paredes Decl. ¶ 23. \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 35 of 64\n129.  According to the CDC, infection prevention for COVID therefore requires no-cost \naccess to soap and water for handwashing, along with frequent cleaning and disinfecting of high-\ntouch surfaces with products containing bleach or at least 60% isopropyl alcohol. Meyer Decl. ¶ \n32. \n130.  CDF has failed in employing effective containment policies.  \n131.  The facility has failed to provide essential personal hygiene products to residents, \nand has even restricted residents’ access to running water for handwashing. Resident Declaration \nB (February 8, 2021 Declaration of Joseph Speed) (“Res. Decl. B”) ¶ 33; Res. Decl. D; Resident \nDeclaration F (February 17, 2021 Declaration of Allen Lamin) (“Res. Decl. F”) ¶ 13. One resident \nrecounts that even when she wanted to wash her hands, she had no ability to do so: “From January \n12 to February 2, I did not have running water in my cell. I couldn’t wash my hands in the cell. I \ntold the guards. They didn’t do anything.” Res. Decl. M ¶ 35.  \n132.  CDF has been so abysmal in its provision of cleaning supplies that staff report that \neven they have to bring in their own cleaning supplies. Ex. EE. \n133.  The facility has likewise failed to consistently provide soap to residents free of \ncharge or on a regular basis. Res. Decl. B ¶ 43; Res. Decl. D ¶¶ 25-27; Res. Decl. F ¶ 26; Res. \nDecl. K ¶ 7. CDF has not provided hand sanitizer in place of soap, either. Res. Decl. D ¶ 33; Res. \nDecl. F ¶ 14; Res. Decl. H ¶ 14; Resident Declaration I (February 12, 2021 Declaration of Devin \nDorsey) (“Res. Decl. I”) ¶ 23; Res. Decl. J ¶ 21. \n134.  Similarly, the facility has not only failed to clean cells after positive residents are \nrelocated, CDF staff have outright denied residents—forced to move into those contaminated \ncells—access to cleaning supplies so that the residents can try to disinfect the space on their own. \nRes. Decl. C ¶ 11. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 36 of 64\n135.  Indeed, some residents who request cleaning supplies are either ignored or told no \nsupplies are available. Resident Declaration A (February 18, 2021 Declaration of Charles Couser) \n(“Res. Decl. A”), ¶¶ 23-23; Res. Decl. B ¶ 36; Res. Decl. C ¶ 11.   \n136.  Likewise, surfaces in common areas are not cleaned between recreation shifts. Res. \nDecl. A ¶ 21; Res. Decl. B ¶ 34; Res. Decl. H ¶ 12. As described above, each unit houses up to 24 \nresidents. CDF’s approach to recreation during the pandemic—whereby half of a unit is permitted \nout of the cells for recreation for one shift, and the other half is permitted out for recreation in a \nsecond, separate shift, Res. Decl. D ¶ 28-29; Res. Decl. F ¶ 12; Res. Decl. H ¶ 12; Res. Decl. J ¶ \n19—accomplishes virtually nothing in the way of disease prevention. \n137.  It is difficult for residents to stay more than six feet apart during recreation time \nbecause the common areas are so small. Res. Decl. F ¶ 12; Res. Decl. H ¶ 13; Res. Decl. J; 25. \nCDF has also made no effort to clean the shared surfaces, like tables, microwaves, and telephones, \nbetween uses by separate groups of residents, Res. Decl. B ¶ 34. \n138.  In the nightmarish environment of the “cadre”—where CDF mixes newly admitted \nfemale residents with COVID-positive, symptomatic male residents—CDF does nothing to clean \ndown common areas after confirmed positive residents mill about and touch surfaces. Res. Decl. \nM ¶¶ 18-19, 22, 24-26, 28 (“On January 8, a male detainee came into the ‘cadre’ unit. He was \ncoughing a lot. . . . The guards said there was nothing they could do. . . . Every time the guy used \nthe phone, he didn’t wipe down the phone. . . . After those four days, another guy came into the \n‘cadre.’ This other guy was put on the other side of me. So I had a male detainee on both sides of \nme. This new guy was sick too. I could hear him coughing too. Then they put another guy on G6, \ntwo cells away. They then put another guy on G5, three cells away. These other two guys had \nsymptoms too. . . . CDF staff never cleaned or sanitized any of the common areas on the ‘cadre.’”). \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 37 of 64\nf.  Failure to Provide Masks or Enforce Social Distancing \n139.  In community settings, the average infected person passes the virus on to 2-3 other \npeople; and transmission—which can happen via respiratory droplets—occurs over a distance of \n3-6 feet. In congregate settings, such as prisons and jails, the average infected person can transmit \nthe virus to 7-8 others. Newer variants are rapidly emerging globally and throughout the US that \nare even more contagious. Meyer Decl. ¶ 8.  \n140.  When infectious diseases are transmitted from person to person by droplets, the \nbest initial strategy is to practice social distancing. Meyer Decl. ¶ 15.  \n141.  Social distancing, which has been a hallmark of the U.S.’s COVID mitigation \nefforts, requires heightened diligence in the carceral setting. Absent intentional intervention, \nincarcerated people share close living quarters and bunk beds, dining halls, bathrooms, showers, \ntelephones,  libraries,  and  other  common  areas,  each  presenting  dangerous  opportunities  for \ntransmission. Spaces within correctional facilities are poorly ventilated, further promoting the \nspread of the disease. Franco-Paredes Decl. ¶ 33. \n142.  Thus, according to public health experts, the COVID pandemic requires proactive \nsocial distancing measures in correctional facilities to reduce the risk of transmission and death \ndue to COVID within facilities. Franco-Paredes Decl. ¶ 43.   \n143.  CDF has not only failed to proactively adopt social distancing; the facility has \nneither required nor enforced any degree of social distancing among residents.  \n144.  Indeed,  putting  two  people  into  most  cells  at  CDF  means  that  residents  are \nphysically unable to maintain six feet of distance from one another while inside their cells.  \nAccording to one resident, he and his cell mate sleep approximately two feet apart from each other. \nRes. Decl. D ¶ 13; see also Res. Decl. B ¶ 14 (“JI has a dorm layout. There are 40 or so total beds. \nEach bed is about two feet from the next.”); Res. Decl. J ¶ 26 (“I also have a cellmate. I can’t stay \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 38 of 64\nsix feet away from him in the cell.”). The residents in the cells next door are between two and four \nfeet from this resident, such that “[w]hen the person in the next cell coughs, it’s like he’s coughing \nright next to” the resident. Res. Decl. D ¶ 12. Moreover, there is no apparent ventilation circulating \nclean air to the cells, such that all of these closely clustered residents are breathing “the same air.” \nId. In this setting, social distancing is impossible.  \n145.  When residents are allowed out of their cells for recreation, overcrowding (perhaps \nbecause the facility designed for single cells is now at twice its original capacity) again makes \nsocial distancing difficult, but not impossible. Due to the small size of the recreation areas, and in \nparticular, the layout of the phone area, see Res. Decl. D ¶¶ 28-30, residents cannot remain six feet \napart from one another during recreation, see Res. Decl. H ¶¶ 12-13; Res. Decl. I ¶ 20; Res. Decl. \nJ ¶¶ 9, 26. \n146.  CDF officers do not even attempt to encourage or enforce distancing among \nresidents. See Res. Decl. A; Res. Decl. B; Res. Decl. D; Res. Decl. F; Res. Decl. J ¶¶ 25 (“CDF \ndoesn’t tell us to stay six feet apart from each other. Nobody comes over the speaker to tell us to \nsocially distance. They don’t tell us that on the speaker. COs don’t tell us to stay six feet apart \nfrom each other.”); Res. Decl. I ¶¶ 18-19. Indeed, in early February, despite the outbreak across \nthe facility, CDF let out around 20 residents to watch the Super Bowl—a reckless decision given \nthe positive numbers at CDF at the time. Id. (“During rec time at CDF, COs don’t enforce masks. \nNot everybody wore masks, either. On Super Bowl Sunday, they had all 20 or so guys out on the \nunit. We all were watching the game. COs weren’t enforcing masks during this time either.”). \n147.  According to Dr. Meyer, a key infection prevention strategy of this droplet-borne \ndisease is the widespread use of masks. Masks should be regularly cleaned and sanitized to \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 39 of 64\noptimize their effectiveness. Masks only work to protect people from infection when used and \nwhen worn correctly. Meyer Decl. ¶ 30. \n148.  CDF’s mask policies have been abysmal.  \n149.  Neither residents nor staff at CDF wear masks correctly and consistently. See Res. \nDecl. A ¶ 22 (“On rec time, not everyone is wearing masks. COs aren’t telling people to wear \nmasks.”); Res. Decl. B ¶ 42 (“When I was at CDF in January, I saw COs not wearing their \nmasks.”); Res. Decl. D ¶ 41 (“The COs don’t always wear their masks. I’ve seen COs come onto \nthe unit without masks.”); Res. Decl. F ¶ 12 (“During rec, a lot of guys are not wearing masks. \nWhen we’re on rec, COs don’t tell people to wear masks” and “I’ve seen COs not wearing \nmasks.”).  \n150.  In fact, when the absence of a mask on a staff member is noted by a resident, CDF \nofficers have told residents that they do not need to wear a mask because they are “not sick.” Res. \nDecl. D ¶ 41 (“I’ve asked COs where their mask is, and they tell me that they aren’t sick so they \ndon’t have to wear a mask.”). Corrections officers also wear their masks incorrectly, leaving their \nnoses exposed and touch residents without wearing gloves. See id. ¶ 41 (“When COs do wear their \nmasks, they sometimes don’t cover their nose and mouth—they sometimes just cover their \nmouth[.]”); Res. Decl. B; Res. Decl. C; Res. Decl. D (“During rec time, some guys don’t wear \nmasks. CDF staff doesn’t tell guys during that time that they should be wearing masks. If there is \na policy, they don’t tell us about it and they don’t care to enforce it.”); Res. Decl. E ¶ 19 (“When \nwe come out for our hour a day for rec, they don’t make us wear masks.”); Res. Decl. G ¶ 25 \n(“When they let us out for that hour a day, nobody’s telling us to wear masks.”); Res. Decl. I ¶¶ \n18-19 (“During rec time at CDF, COs don’t enforce masks. Not everybody wore masks, either. On \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 40 of 64\nSuper Bowl Sunday, they had all 20 or so guys out on the unit. We all were watching the game. \nCOs weren’t enforcing masks during this time either.”). \n151.  When outside their cells, it is “optional” for residents to wear masks. Masks are \nonly “mandatory” when residents leave their specific unit and move throughout the facility. Res. \nDecl. H ¶ 13 (“Not everyone wears masks during rec. It’s not mandatory then. It’s only mandatory \nwhen you move outside the unit.”). Residents worried for their personal health and safety must try \nto police the mask-wearing of their fellow residents. Res. Decl. J ¶ 27 (“When people are out in \ncommon areas, I see them not wearing masks or not wearing them the right way . . . . On Friday, \nFebruary 5, when I was on the phone, I saw two people on the tier with their masks pulled up, not \ncovering their nose or mouth. COs didn’t say anything to them. I called out to them to wear their \nmasks right. I see people on the tier without their masks.”) \n152.  Likewise, residents are not given access to adequate personal protective equipment \n(“PPE”), even when they specifically request it. Res. Decl. A ¶¶ 28-30 (“I’ve had the same mask \nthat I had at JI. They’re not issuing new masks. I’ve asked for a new mask. I’ve asked for gloves. \nThey said no, they don’t have any.”); Res. Decl. B ¶ 27 (“When I was at CDF, I didn’t get a mask \nuntil the end of 2020 from CDF. I got an extra mask when I got my teeth cleaned at the end of \nNovember 2020.”).    \n153.  Some residents have not been given a mask by CDF at all. Res. Decl. J ¶ 22 (“When \nI got to CDF, I had a mask from another jail. It was made of cloth. CDF didn’t give me a mask.”). \n154.  CDF gives residents zero instructions on how to sanitize their masks. See Res. Decl. \nA, B, D, J. \n155.  In any event, residents are also not able to clean the masks they do have. To clean \ntheir masks, residents would have send them out with laundry, which takes at least a day (leaving \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 41 of 64\nthe mask owner without protection while its gone) and requires that the mask owner be willing to \nrisk having no mask at all, as laundry is routinely lost. Res. Decl. B ¶¶ 28-29. The mask CDF gave \nme was a cloth mask. . . . I didn’t want to put my mask in the laundry. All of our laundry gets \nwashed all together. Plus, I’ve lost stuff in the laundry before. They only pick up laundry once a \nweek. Sometimes they skip a week. They’ve been skipping it a lot lately because someone who \ndid the laundry had COVID. When they do pick up laundry, it would take a day or two to get \nlaundry back.”); see also Meyer Decl. ¶ 30(b). \ng.  Inhumane Treatment of COVID-Positive Residents \n156.  As appalling as CDF’s inexplicable disregard for the risk of COVID exposure and \nspread is, the facility’s treatment of residents who test positive is even more unconscionable. In \nfact, CDF residents who test positive for COVID are held in conditions that would befit not even \ncattle.  \n157.  According to Dr. Meyer, a majority (80%) of people with symptomatic COVID \ninfection will develop mild symptoms, such as fever, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, body aches, \nfatigue, cough, and headaches, and will be able to recover with supportive care (which involves \nrest, hydration, and acetaminophen as needed for fevers). Although these symptoms are not always \nlife-threatening, they may still require medical care. Meyer Decl. ¶ 35. \n158.  According to Dr. Meyer, during the course of COVID infection, approximately \n20% of people will require hospitalization, 5% will require intensive care, and 1-2% will die. \nSevere disease and complications are more likely in individuals with predisposing risk factors, \nincluding age, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, pregnancy, and \nsuppressed immune systems. Meyer Decl. ¶ 35.  \n159.  According to Dr. Meyer, residents of detention facilities in general and those \nspecifically at CDF are more likely than people in the general population to experience these \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 42 of 64\nconditions and are therefore more likely to experience severe disease and death from COVID. \nProgression of respiratory symptoms in COVID can be extremely rapid, within 24 hours, requiring \nhospitalization,  so  people  in  medical  isolation  need  to  be  diligently  monitored  for  clinical \nworsening. Meyer Decl. ¶ 35. \n160.  As described above, people with mild symptoms may not require hospitalization \nbut should continue to be closely monitored. People with moderate symptoms may require \nhospitalization for supportive care, including intravenous fluids and supplemental oxygen. People \nwith severe symptoms may require ventilation and intravenous antibiotics. Meyer Decl. ¶ 10.  \n161.  CDF  has  made  a  series  of  wildly  inappropriate  and  dangerous  decisions  in \naddressing how to handle residents who test positive for COVID.   \n162.  Some COVID-positive CDF residents are removed from CDF and sent to the Jail \nIndustries Building (“JI”), an affiliated facility down the street from CDF. See Jail Industries \nBuilding/Baltimore  Pre-Release  Unit,  https://www.dpscs.state.md.us/locations/bpru.shtml.  As \ndescribed above, originally built in 1922 as an office building and retrofitted as a jail in the 1980s, \nJI was closed in 2017 due to what public safety officials called a “security nightmare.” I-Team \nlooks  inside  closing  jail  facility  in  Baltimore,  Sept.  1,  2017,  available  at \nhttps://www.wbaltv.com/article/i-team-looks-inside-closing-jail-facility-in-baltimore/12139786 \n(containing a video tour of the then-closed facility). \n163.  This facility, which is best described as a broken-down, pest-plagued warehouse, \nwould be an inhumane detention space for healthy inmates. For individuals who have already \ntested positive for a potentially deadly virus, it is nothing short of horrifying.  \n164.  For instance, one COVID-positive resident who was recently housed at JI recently \nsaw a thermostat in the building showing that the temperature was 55 degrees. Res. Decl. B ¶ 11 \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 43 of 64\n(“It’s really cold in JI. I can see the thermostat. It says 55. But it’s even colder than that. I have a \nblanket on me right now.”). This is unsurprising, given the number of broken or drafty windows \nat the facility and the fact that January and February are two of the coldest months in the year. Res. \nDecl. B ¶ 12 (“It looks like a warehouse in here. Some of the windows are busted out. I can feel \ncold air coming in.”). \n165.  Indeed, the dormitory-style housing, see Res. Decl. B ¶ 14 (“JI has a dorm layout. \nThere are 40 or so total beds. Each bed is about two feet from the next.”), has the COVID-positive \nresidents at JI sleeping underneath these broken or drafty windows, despite the dangerously low \noutdoor temperatures, see id. ¶ 15 (“Our beds at JI are against the wall with the broken windows”). \n166.  Residents also are not given appropriate clothing for the temperature. Res. Decl. A \n¶ 20 (“We had to use blankets to stay warm. It was really cold there.”). According to two JI \nresidents, upon their arrival at JI, they were forced to turn in their clothing in exchange for paper-\nmaterial hospital shorts, a t-shirt, and shower shoes. Id. ¶ 19 (“When we got to JI, they took the \nclothes we came with from CDF. They put us in shower shoes. They tried to give us used \nunderwear. We had to tell them we wouldn’t put it on until they gave us new underwear and socks. \nThey gave us paper shorts, like what paper masks are made of. They gave us a short sleeve shirt.”); \nRes. Decl. B ¶ 13 (“When they moved me, they took all my clothes. They gave all of us at JI \nhospital shorts. We got a T-shirt and a pair of boxers.”)  \n167.  Worse,  these  residents  cannot  even  look  forward  to  a  hot  meal  for  warmth. \nAccording to a CDF resident who was temporarily housed at JI, officers “pick up meal trays from \nCDF and bring them [down the street] to JI. The dinners are cold. There’s no microwave at JI, \neither.” Res. Decl. B ¶ 19. \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 44 of 64\n168.  Cleanliness, too, is unattainable for COVID-positive JI residents. Not only is the \nfacility itself dirty and not subject to regular cleaning, but the shower facilities are infested with \nflies. Res. Decl. A ¶ 16 (“When I was at JI, I never saw anyone clean anything.”). \n169.  Moreover, the water in the showers is not even hot. If these residents—who are \nenduring a deadly virus in near-freezing temperatures without adequate clothing—want to stay \nclean, they must also subject themselves to cold, or at best lukewarm, showers. Res. Decl. B ¶ 22 \n(“The showers here are really cold. The hot water doesn’t work. It doesn’t get hotter than a pool.”) \n170.  COVID-positive JI residents barely get to communicate with the world outside. \nRes. Decl. B ¶ 26 (“They cut off my phone calls from JI at 15 minutes.”).  \n171.  When they are allowed to use the phones at the facility, they must do so within six \nto eight inches of the other COVID-positive JI residents. Res. Decl. B ¶ 18 (“There’s no social \ndistancing at JI at all. When we use the phone, the phones are 6 to 8 inches apart from each other.”).  \n172.  COVID-positive JI residents have no access to a commissary and are stripped of all \npossessions when they leave CDF. Res. Decl. B ¶ 21 (“There’s no commissary here at JI. I wasn’t \nallowed to bring anything.”).  \n173.  COVID-positive JI residents receive little medical care, despite the fact that they \nare only in JI because they have contracted a deadly virus. The entirety of the medical care \nprovided at JI is the following: residents’ vital signs and temperatures are checked once every five \nhours. Res. Decl. A ¶ 13; Res. Decl. B ¶ 20.  \n174.  Residents are not asked to report their symptoms. Res. Decl. B. ¶¶ 20-25. Nobody \nlistens to the residents’ lungs to be sure they are breathing normally. Res. Decl. A ¶ 14 (“Nobody \never put a stethoscope to my chest. Nobody tried to listen to my lungs.”). \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 45 of 64\n175.  According to Dr. Meyer, the primary manifestation of severe COVID disease is \npneumonia, which produces distinct lung sounds that could herald severe disease and reflect \npeople’s subjective reports of shortness of breath. Simply marking down a patient’s vital signs—\neven with oxygen readings—is not sufficient medical care for COVID disease. Meyer Decl. ¶ \n35(b).  \n176.  COVID-positive JI residents are not even always given aspirin to help them manage \nthe physical symptoms of COVID. Res. Decl. A ¶ 12 (“My first day at JI, I had really bad \nsymptoms. I had diarrhea. I was using the toilet all the time. I had really bad headaches. I had a \nsore throat. I couldn’t smell or taste. I asked for some aspirin. They said they didn’t have any.”). \n177.  Even  residents  with  preexisting  conditions  that  make  COVID  notably  more \ndangerous have been denied access to previously approved medical care.  \n178.  According to one of two COVID-positive residents who was recently housed at JI \nwith a preexisting condition, he had to go multiple days without his inhaler to treat his condition, \none that is exacerbated by COVID—because he was forced to leave it at CDF. Res. Decl. B ¶ 10 \n(“I went from Tuesday, February 2, to Saturday, February 6, without my inhalers at JI.”).  \n179.  The treatment of COVID-positive residents is inhumane. There is no explanation \nfor why CDF is shipping out its residents to a cold warehouse and then stripping them of the \nmedical care and monitoring they so desperately need.  \nh.  Other Serious Deficits with Medical Care, including the Failure to Offer \nVaccinations to All Eligible Residents \n180.  CDF does not sufficiently monitor for COVID symptoms in residents. Res. Decl. \nA ¶25 (“[N]obody is coming around asking me whether I have any symptoms”); Res. Decl. D ¶ 5 \n(“CDF did not make me quarantine or isolate after that man was removed from the unit. Nobody \nchecked my temperature, or asked me if I had any symptoms.”); Res. Decl. F ¶ 11 (“When I was \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 46 of 64\nat JI, they didn’t ask whether we had any symptoms. [But g]uys had symptoms [such as] coughing, \n[or they] couldn’t really breathe.”). \n181.  One resident was denied his prescribed medication and instead given medication \nfor diabetes and hypertensions—conditions from which he does not suffer. Had he taken those two \nmedications, he may have suffered serious illness or death. Resident Declaration H (February 13, \n2021 Declaration of Collin Davis) (“Res. Decl. H”) ¶¶ 23, 25 (“[On February 9,] a nurse came by \nand told me to take my diabetes and hypertension medication. . . . I told the nurse I wouldn’t take \nthat medication. . . . On February 10, the same thing happened--a nurse came by and gave me \nmedication that she said was for hypertension and diabetes. I called out for the captain and \nexplained the situation and showed him my paperwork [showing the medication that resident did \ntake, which he was not being given].”) \n182.  CDF does not respond to some sick calls at all. CDF is declining to take some \nresidents to sick calls. Some residents don’t even have the chance to file sick call requests. Res. \nDecl. B ¶ 44 (“CDF doesn’t respond to sick calls. I put in a sick call . . . in the middle of January. \nI never got a response.”); Res. Decl. E ¶ 20 (“CDF isn’t letting people go down for sick calls.”); \nResident Declaration G (February 16, 2021 Declaration of Antonio Johnson) (“Res. Decl. G”) ¶¶ \n11, 21 (“I put in a lot of sick calls that nobody responded to . . . . There’s not a sick call box on my \n[current] unit now. They don’t come around with a sick call box, either.”). \n183.  On or about October 16, 2020, the Maryland Department of Health (“MDH”) \nsubmitted to the CDC and released to the public its draft COVID-19 Vaccination Plan (the “Plan”). \nThe Plan’s purpose is to “provide a plan for the distribution, administration, recording, and \ncommunication  of  COVID-19  vaccines  administered  in  the  state  of  Maryland.”  Maryland \nDepartment  of  Health,  COVID-19  Vaccination  Plan,  at  7,  available  at \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 47 of 64\nhttps://phpa.health.maryland.gov/Documents/10.19.2020_Maryland_COVID-\n19_Vaccination_Plan_CDCwm.pdf.   \n184.  Under the Plan’s three-phased approach to vaccine administration, Maryland’s \n“initial COVID-19 vaccination efforts will target those at highest risk of developing complications \nfrom COVID-19[.]” Id. at 13.  \n185.  The  Plan’s  Phase  1  vaccination  category  identifies  target  populations  in  the \nfollowing six subcategories:  (1) high risk healthcare workers; (2) first responders; (3) older adults \nin congregate or overcrowded settings; (4) members of the judiciary; (5) “people in prisons, jails, \ndetention centers and staff”; and (6) “people with comorbid and underlying conditions that put \nthem at significantly higher risk.” Id. at 45-46, App. 3 (emphasis added).  \n186.  The Phase 1 subcategory of “people in prisons, jails, detention centers and staff” \nexpressly includes “incarcerated/detained individuals” and “correctional officers, jailers, support \nstaff.” Id.  \n187.  The Phase 1 subcategory of “people with comorbid and underlying conditions that \nput them at significantly higher risk” expressly includes individuals who have chronic kidney \ndisease,  COPD,  organ  transplant(s),  obesity,  serious  heart  conditions,  diabetes  type  2,  or \ncomorbidity with any of these conditions. Id. at 46, App. 3.  \n188.  An informational bulletin published by Governor Hogan and MDH on January 14, \n2021, specifies that “high-risk incarcerated individuals” are to be offered access to the COVID-19 \nvaccine in Phase 1B of the Plan, noting that the State “plans” to enter Phase 1B on January 18, \n2021. Office of Governor Larry Hogan in partnership with the Maryland Department of Health, \nMaryland’s  Phased  COVID-19  Vaccine  Distribution  (Jan.  14,  2021), \nhttps://governor.maryland.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Phases-One-Pager-1.pdf.  According \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 48 of 64\nto MDH’s public-facing “COVIDLink” website, the State did, in fact, enter Phase 1B on January \n18, 2021. Maryland Department of Health “GoVAX,” Maryland’s Phased COVID-19 Vaccine \nDistribution,  https://covidlink.maryland.gov/content/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/MDH017182-\n01_VaccinePrioritizationGuidance_Flyer_HR.pdf  \n189.  Although Maryland is reportedly moving on to vaccinate persons in the general \npopulation  eligible  under  Phase  1C  of  the  Plan,  there  is  no  indication  that  all  “high-risk \nincarcerated individuals” at CDF are being offered vaccinations. Maryland Department of Health, \nMaryland moves into Phase 1C of its COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan, opens eligibility to all \nresidents  65  and  up  (Jan.  25,  2021),  https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/Maryland-\nmoves-into-Phase-1C-of-its-COVID-19-vaccine-distribution-plan,-opens-eligibility-to-all-\nresidents-65-and-up.aspx. The Plan does not specifically define the term “high risk individuals” \nbut  includes  within  that  category:  “Persons  at  highest  risk  of  developing  complications  \nfrom  COVID-19  (ACIP  high  risk  conditions),  including  persons  65  and  older,  \nstaff and residents of nursing homes (SNFs), long-term care facilities (LTCFs), assisted care \nfacilities,  and  clients  of  senior  daycare  facilities  or  similar.” \nhttps://phpa.health.maryland.gov/Documents/10.19.2020_Maryland_COVID-\n19_Vaccination_Plan_CDCwm.pdf, at 13 (emphasis added). It is clear the Plan intends to include \nat least a portion of the detainees at CDF within Phase 1, because the Plan goes on to estimate the \npopulation to be vaccinated in Maryland under the Plan in Phase 1 as including approximately \n54,460 “people in prisons, jails, detention centers and staff.” Id. at 13. \n190.  Despite the acknowledgement that incarcerated and detained individuals, including \nthose held in detention centers like CDF, are at high risk of contracting COVID-19, Defendants \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 49 of 64\nhave violated Plaintiffs’ rights by depriving them vaccines based on their incarceration or pretrial \ndetention status. \ni.  Overuse of Solitary Confinement \n191.  As described above, disciplinary segregation or solitary confinement is not an \nappropriate disease containment strategy. Meyer Decl. ¶ 18. \n192.  Beyond the known detrimental mental  health effects of solitary confinement, \nisolation of people who are ill in solitary confinement results in decreased medical attention and \nincreased risk of death. Meyer Decl. ¶ 18.  \n193.  In addition, if solitary confinement is a carceral facility’s response to COVID, \npeople who are ill will be deterred from reporting their symptoms, resulting in their increased risk \nof severe disease and death and ongoing spread to others. Id. \n194.  Despite these clear incentives not to use punitive-style confinement as an effective \nmeans to control COVID, CDF is doing precisely that.  \n195.  During apparently COVID-related lockdowns, residents (negative and positive \nalike) were held in their cells for 24 hours a day and not even allowed out to shower for multiple \ndays—a confounding restriction, given the necessity of sanitation and hygiene to stop the spread \nof this virus. Res. Decl. F ¶18 (“I was here at CDF when it locked down. It was at least a couple \ndays. We couldn’t get out to shower. It was 24 hours a day at some points.”); Res. Decl. G. \n196.  One resident recounts that “they didn’t open our cell doors for 25 hours. During \nthat time, I had no water to wash my hands or to drink.” Res. Decl. M ¶¶ 38-39. The same resident \nrecounts that “We got locked down a second time, and couldn’t leave our cells. The guard brought \nme some ice [because my sink in my cell did not function]. He said he wouldn’t bring me water. \nHe told me to wait for the ice to melt.” Id. \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 50 of 64\n197.  Other residents have been held—without explanations or test results—in units \nwhere they are locked inside their cells for 23 hours a day. Res. Decl. E ¶ 13 (“On this unit, we \nhave to stay in our cell 23 hours a day.”); Res. Decl. A ¶ 29 (“They don’t tell us why they lock \ndown the units. That happened a few times this year. On a few of the times they locked down, I \ncouldn’t get out of my cell for any reasons, even to shower.”); Res. Decl. L ¶ 19; (“They locked \ndown CDF in late January. They didn’t tell us why. They didn’t tell us they locked down because \nof COVID.”).  \n198.  When residents in these lockdown-type situations experience COVID symptoms, \nthey are kept in their cells, with the only access to medical care being occasional visits to check \nthe residents’ vital signs. Res. Decl. E ¶¶ 14-15 (“I started to have breathing problems and major \ncramps in my stomach. I couldn’t taste or smell anything. It felt like a bunch of needles were in \nmy nose. I started having these symptoms two days after they moved me. Nobody asked me \nwhether I had symptoms. They just take my vitals and leave.”) \n199.  For those not being held inside their cells for 23 or 24 hours every day, they are \nnonetheless confined to the cells for 20 hours every day. Res. Decl. J ¶ 19 (“As of February 8, \nthey’re letting us out of our cells for four hours a day--two hours in the morning and two hours in \nthe afternoon.”) \n200.  One  resident  was  told  a  member  of  the  U.S.  Marshal  Service  that  the  “bad \nconditions” at CDF (including, apparently lockdown measures) were because of their attorneys \ntrying to get them out of jail. Res. Decl. D ¶ 51; Meyer Decl. ¶ 33. As recounted by Dr. Meyer, \none resident reports perceiving this as punishment. Meyer Decl. ¶ 33. \n201.  One resident recounts that CDF staff told residents that the unit was locking down \nbecause “there weren’t enough guards to take care of us”—another example of a failure to \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 51 of 64\nappropriately plan on CDF’s part. Res. Decl. M ¶ 37. See also id. ¶ 38 (“[T]hey didn’t open our \ncell doors for 25 hours. During that time, I had no water to wash my hands or to drink.”). \n202.   Nor does CDF provide any process to residents to challenge their placement in \nlockdown. \nj.  CDF’s Mismanagement has Caused a Massive Outbreak \n203.  CDF’s  catastrophic  failure  to  employ  even  the  most  basic  tenets  of  virus \ncontainment and mitigation strategies has predictably led to a massive COVID outbreak. As \nrecounted by Dr. Meyer, based on her review of documents tracking the outbreak (which are \nattached as exhibits to this complaint):  \na.  By  January  13,  “several”  residents  had  tested  positive,  according  to  a \nmemorandum from the Warden.[4] The memorandum does not indicate that the \nsource of these positive cases was ever identified. These residents were all in \nthe “working men housing[.]” . . . They potentially unknowingly transmitted \nthe virus to others while working throughout the facility. \n \nb.  As  of  January  21,  45  residents  tested  positive,  according  to  the  same \nmemorandum. The decision was then made to put all remaining individuals in \nC and F pods on quarantine. The fact that individuals from multiple different \nhousing units were testing positive suggests that transmission was already \nwidespread throughout the facility by the time it was identified. \n \nc.  Between January 1 and January 25, 73 residents and 20 staff tested positive, \naccording to a public court filing in United States v. Mohr.[5] At this point, \nindividuals who tested positive were then isolated in place from the general \npopulation in C and F pods. (It appears that C and F pods quickly switched from \nquarantine to isolation units.)  \n \nd.  Prior to January 25, “COVID-19 positive inmates were being isolated at a \nseparate facility, the Health Monitoring Facility (HMF),” according to a public \ncourt filing, which was based on conversations with “senior administrative and \nmedical officials of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional \nServices (“DPSCS”) and the Maryland Attorney General’s Office, including \nthe Assistant Secretary of DPSCS, the Chief Medical Officer, and the warden \n                                                \n4 Ex. FF hereto (Memorandum from Defendant Calvin Wilson, Warden, CDF, dated January 21, 2021) (originally \nfiled in United States v. Bivens, Case No. 1:19-cr-00233-RDB (D. Md.

Md. \nJan. 26, 2021)) \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 52 of 64\nof the Chesapeake Detention Facility.”[6] By January 25, apparently, it was no \nlonger practical to house positive residents at the “Health Monitoring Facility,” \ndespite the stated “preference to isolate COVID-19 detainees at HMF.” CDF \napparently had not identified any cases outside of C and F as of January 25, \naccording to the public court filing in United States v. Mohr.[7] \n \ne.  As of January 25, CDF had still not identified “how the first . . . inmates were \nexposed,” according to the same filing. This indicates deficits in the contact \ntracing process. \n \nf.  The outbreak in C and F pods prompted testing of the entire resident population \nand all medical staff on January 30. It is unclear whether custody staff were \nincluded in this surveillance effort. As of January 31, 81 residents had tested \npositive, according to a court filing in United States v. Moore.[8] \n \ng.  As of February 5, the number of positive residents had increased to 156, along \nwith 77 staff, according to public DPSCS data. \n \nh.  Per an update on February 10 in United States v. Cobb, the number of positive \nresidents had increased to 160, with 25 individuals remaining in quarantine and \n134 test results still pending. Even if the current outbreak is found to be \ncontained, future outbreaks are inevitable in the absence of fully implemented \ndisease prevention and management strategies.[9] \n \ni.  At least two declarants report being re-infected with COVID-19 during this \noutbreak. One reported being diagnosed with COVID-19 in August 2020 and \nagain in February 2021. Another reported being diagnosed with COVID-19 in \nMay 2020 and again in January 2021. These re-infections speak to the high \ndegree of exposure and risk to residents inside CDF during this period. . . . \n \nj.  This  timeline  of  explosive  growth  of  the  virus,  as  well  as  CDF  quickly \nabandoning plans to isolate or quarantine in particular areas, demonstrates a \nfailure to plan.  \n \nk.  The failure to plan is played out in residents’ accounts of dangerous intermixing \nacross different cohorts. Multiple residents report being put into close contact \nwith  positive  residents,  apparently  as  the  facility  was  moving  to  create \nquarantine or isolation units. One resident also reports being left in a cell with \nhis positive cellmate for multiple days before they moved the first resident out. \n                                                \n6 Id. \n7 Id. \n8 Ex. HH (Government’s Response to Judicial Order, United States v. Moore, Case No. 1:20-cr-00430-RDB (D. Md. \nFeb. 1, 2021)).  \n9 Ex. II (Response in Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Reopen Detention Hearing and Order Pretrial Release, \nUnited States v. Cobb, Case No. 1:20-cr-00376-RDB (D. Md. Feb. 10, 2021)). \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 53 of 64\nThere is also a report that after a positive resident was moved out of a cell, CDF \npermitted him to return to retrieve his belongings. This type of intermixing \nposes high risk of disease transmission and undermines the whole purpose of \ncohorting. It takes planning to ensure that different groups are appropriately \nseparated—which appears to be absent here. \n \nMeyer Decl. ¶ 27. \n \n204.  The grave missteps of CDF were detailed at length at a detention hearing in United \nStates v. Hodges, 8:20−cr−00148−PX−1 (D. Md. Feb. 17, 2021). Ms. Hodges—who is almost 70 \nyears old, takes three medications a day for hypertension, and suffers from anxiety—was detained \nafter an initial hearing on February 2, 2021. At that initial hearing, the United States Attorney's \nOffice for the District of Maryland (USAO-MD) informed the District Court that Ms. Hodges \nwould not be sent to CDF (presumably based on assurances from CDF itself, in light of the ongoing \noutbreak in the facility). Despite these assurances, Ms. Hodges was nonetheless placed at CDF \npending her hearing on February 17. She was placed into a male unit at CDF, with a least four \nother residents who had tested positive for COVID—a wildly dangerous placement that intermixed \ndifferent cohorts. \n205.  Like many other residents, CDF also forced Ms. Hodges to go without medication \nfor multiple days. Ms. Hodges’ experience—also reflected in the declaration of another resident, \nsee Res. Decl. H—shows the degree to which CDF has refused to change its practices in light of \nCOVID.  \n206.  That CDF affirmatively told USAO-MD that Ms. Hodges would not be placed at \nthe facility, and then soon after did so anyway, speaks to the facility’s blatant disregard for the \nhealth and safety of residents—both new admits and existing residents. \n207.  As described above, things have gotten worse since the outbreak, with units mixing \nmen and women and positive residents and new intakes.  \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 54 of 64\n208.  All of the Exhibits cited in and attached to this Complaint are incorporated by \nreference. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n209.  Pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the \nindividual named Plaintiffs seek to certify two classes, with one subclass as follows: \n●  The Pretrial Class is defined as “all people detained in the Chesapeake Detention Facility \nwho are not detained pursuant to a judgment of conviction.”  \no  The Medically Vulnerable Subclass is defined as “all Pretrial Class members \nwhose medical condition renders them especially vulnerable to the coronavirus as \ndetermined by guidelines promulgated by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention.” See U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, People Who \nAre At Higher Risk (last reviewed Feb. 18, 2021), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-\nhigher-risk.html.  \n●  The Post-Conviction Class is defined as “all people detained in the Chesapeake Detention \nFacility who are detained pursuant to a judgment of conviction.” \n210.  The class allegations and law are set forth in more detail in the accompanying \nmotion for class certification. \n211.  A class action is the only practicable means by which the individually named \nPlaintiffs  and  the  class  members  can  challenge  Defendants’  unconstitutional  actions.  Many \nmembers of the class are without the means to retain an attorney to represent them in a civil rights \nlawsuit. \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 55 of 64\n212.  The classes and subclass are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical. \nThere are about 400 people in the classes. Demographic data regarding the health of correctional \npopulations, which is set forth above, indicates that the Medically Vulnerable Subclass likely \nconsists of at least 50 of people (and likely many more). A sizeable percentage of the jail \npopulation is likely medically vulnerable to COVID. According to one study, “asthma prevalence \nis 30%–60% higher among individuals with a history of incarceration as compared with the general \npopulation.” Elizabeth M. Vigilanto et al., Mass Incarceration and Pulmonary Health: Guidance \nfor Clinicians, 15 Ann. Am. Thoracic Soc. 409, 409 (2019). Another study estimates that up to \n15% of people who are in custody have asthma, 10% of people in custody live with a heart \ncondition that requires medical care, 10% live with diabetes, and 30% have hypertension. See \nLaura M. Marushack et al., Medical Problems of State and Federal Prisoners and Jail Inmates, \n2011-12, U.S. Dept. of Justice (2014).   \n213.  There are questions of law and fact common to all class members and the subclass, \nincluding, among many others:  \na.  Do CDF’s conditions create a substantial risk that the people in its custody will \nbe infected with COVID? \nb.  Do CDF’s conditions create a substantial risk that the people in its custody who \nare infected with COVID will face serious illness, long-term physical damage, \nor death? \nc.  Did Defendants know, or should Defendants have known, of these risks? \nd.  Are Defendants acting with deliberate indifference to these risks? \ne.  For the subclass: Is the risk of harm posed by CDF’s conditions so severe and \nso immediate that the only adequate remedy is release? \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 56 of 64\n214.  The claims of the class representatives are typical of the claims of the classes and \nof the subclass. That typicality stems from their claim that Defendants have placed them at \nsignificant risk of serious harm by failing to take appropriate steps to address the risk of COVID \nin CDF. Every person at CDF faces a heightened risk of risk of contracting COVID and facing \nserious illness, physical injury, or death if Defendants do not adequately protect them. \n215.  The claims of the Medically Vulnerable Subclass representatives are typical of the \nsubclass members as well, as each member is subject to increased risk of substantial harm or death \ndue to their existing medical conditions.  \n216.  The individually-named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests \nof the classes and subclass. The named Plaintiffs have no conflicts with the unnamed members of \nthe proposed classes. In addition, their lawyers are experienced in federal court civil rights class \nactions, particularly those involving prisons and jails. \n217.  Defendants have failed to act in a manner that applies generally to the classes and \nsubclass as a whole, rendering class-wide injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate. \nCOUNT I \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 (on behalf of all Class members) \nFifth / Fourteenth and Eighth Amendments: Jail Conditions \n(against Defendants Wilson and Green) \n \n218.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth \nin this Count. \n219.  Plaintiffs and the classes they represent have been deprived and continue to be \ndeprived by the Defendants of their rights under the Fifth / Fourteenth Amendments and Eighth \nAmendment to reasonably safe living conditions. Defendants Wilson and Green are aware of the \nsubstantial risk of harm that COVID poses to all individuals, and are further aware of the particular \nrisks of severe illness and possible death that Plaintiffs face as a result of the conditions in CDF.  \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 57 of 64\nDespite this knowledge, Defendants have failed to take reasonable measures to mitigate these \ndangers. \n220.  Defendants  acted  with  deliberate  indifference  to  the  health  concerns  of  the \nPlaintiffs. \n221.  As a result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, class members face a substantial \nrisk of contracting COVID and sustaining a serious illness that could lead to death.   \n222.  Defendants’ failure to take appropriate steps to curb the substantial threat posed by \nCOVID to each person in his custody, as described more fully above, violates Plaintiffs’ rights to \nunreasonable risk of death and bodily harm. \n223.  Consequently, Defendants are in continuous violation of these Plaintiffs’ rights and \nthe rights of the members of the class under the Fifth / Fourteenth and Eighth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution. \n224.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief against Defendants Wilson and \nGreen to prevent the continued violation of the rights of Plaintiffs and the classes they represent. \nCOUNT II \nPetition for Writs of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 \n(on behalf of Medically Vulnerable Subclass) \n(against Respondent Wilson) \n \n225.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth \nin this Count. \n226.  Petitioners are not in custody pursuant to a judgment of conviction of a court. They \nare all pretrial detainees, presumed innocent.  \n227.  Respondent Wilson is holding members of the Medically Vulnerable Subclass in \ncustody in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth / Fourteenth Amendments to the \nConstitution of the United States. \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 58 of 64\n228.  Respondent Wilson acted with deliberate indifference to the health concerns of the \nPlaintiffs/Petitioners. \n229.  Due  Process  forbids  exposing  Petitioners  to  a  severe  risk  of  death,  pain,  or \npermanent severe injury, and there are presently no options available to mitigate that risk quickly \nenough to protect this subclass other than immediate release from custody. \nCOUNT III \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 (on behalf of all Class members) \nFifth / Fourteenth and Eighth Amendments: Solitary Confinement \n(against Defendants Wilson and Green) \n \n230.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth \nin this Count. \n231.  Plaintiffs and the classes they represent have been deprived and continue to be \ndeprived by the Defendants of their rights under the Fifth / Fourteenth and Eighth Amendments to \nreasonably safe living conditions.  \n232.  Defendants Wilson and Green are aware of the substantial risk of psychological \nand physiological harm that the Jail’s indefinite lockdown policy imposes on prisoners but \nrepeatedly implemented. Moreover, Defendants have done so despite the availability of other, \nmore effective means of enacting social distancing.  \n233.  Defendants  acted  with  deliberate  indifference  to  the  health  concerns  of  the \nPlaintiffs. \n234.  As a result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, class members face a substantial \nrisk of psychological and physiological harm.  \n235.  Consequently, Defendants are in continuous violation of these Plaintiffs’ rights and \nthe rights of the members of the classes under the Fifth / Fourteenth and Eighth Amendments to \nthe United States Constitution. \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 59 of 64\n236.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief against Defendants Wilson and \nGreen to prevent the continued violation of the rights of Plaintiffs and the classes they represent. \nCOUNT IV \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 (on behalf of all Class members) \nFifth / Fourteenth and Eighth Amendments: Due Process & Solitary Confinement \n(against Defendants Wilson and Green) \n \n237.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth \nin this Count. \n238.  Plaintiffs and the classes they represent have been deprived and continue to be \ndeprived by the Defendants of their state-created liberty interests under the Fifth / Fourteenth and \nEighth Amendments without due process.  \n239.  Residents have not given opportunities to challenge their placement in solitary \nconfinement conditions.  \n240.  These conditions constitute an atypical and significant hardship relative to the \nordinary incidents of life at a detention facility.  \n241.  CDF lacks any process for determining whether a particular resident must be placed \nin these conditions or when these conditions, as a general matter or in a particular housing unit, \nmay end.  \n242.  Defendants  acted  with  deliberate  indifference  to  the  health  concerns  of  the \nPlaintiffs. \n243.  Consequently, Defendants are in continuous violation of these Plaintiffs’ rights and \nthe rights of the members of the classes under the Fifth / Fourteenth and Eighth Amendments to \nthe United States Constitution. \n   \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 60 of 64\nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n          WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and the classes they seek to represent, \nrequest that this Court enter judgment in their favor and against Defendants and order the following \nrelief, including issuance of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and final \njudgment for all Class members requiring Defendants to implement constitutionally sufficient \nprocedures to protect their health and safety that are consistent with CDC guidelines and the expert \njudgment of correctional health specialists, including but not limited to: \na)  An inspection of CDF and its records (including medical records, movement \nrecords, and contact-tracing records) by an independent expert to be chosen by the Court with the \nparties’ input; \nb)  An order to CDF requiring the facility, its staff, and contractors to effectively \ncommunicate to all residents sufficient information about COVID, measures to reduce the risk of \ntransmission, and any other information necessary to reasonably ensure that these individuals are \naware of what precautions they can take to prevent infection (including information about the \nbenefits and drawbacks of vaccinations); \nc)  An order that CDF ensure each resident receives, free of charge: (1) an individual \nsupply of liquid hand soap and paper towels sufficient to allow frequent hand washing and drying \neach day; (2) tissues; and (3) adequate access to a supply of cleaning and disinfectant products \neffective against COVID to allow for cleanings of frequently-touched surfaces several times per \nday; \nd)  An order that CDF clean and disinfect frequently-touched surfaces in common \nareas several times per day, including phones; \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 61 of 64\ne)  An order that CDF provide adequate medical care to residents, whether because of \nCOVID symptoms, chronic health conditions, or any other medical issue; \nf)  An order that CDF create and enact social distancing policies that allow for \nadequate spacing of six feet or more between residents;  \ng)  An order that CDF ensure that residents have adequate access to phones to contact \ncounsel and/or family members such that residents need not congregate at the phones;  \nh)  An order that CDF provide appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to \nresidents and staff according to the CDC’s recommendations, and receive appropriate instruction \nabout how to wear and clean it;  \ni)  An order that CDF end preemptive lockdown procedures and instead impose \nappropriate time-limited quarantines, with that time limit clearly communicated to residents, only \nwhen necessary due to a known or suspected case of COVID, as recommended by medical and \npublic health professionals; \nj)  An order that CDF implement appropriate cohorting, including quarantining and \nmedical isolation procedures, as recommended by CDC guidelines; \nk)  To  the  extent  a  resident  must  enter  lockdown  or  isolation  to  effectuate  an \nappropriate quarantine or medical isolation procedure, an order that CDF provide appropriate \nmental health services, and, if that resident has a mental health condition, provide enhanced \npsychological services in these circumstances; \nl)  An order that CDF offer appropriate mental health services to all residents; \nm)  An order that CDF ensure that isolation, cohorted isolation, and quarantine cells are \nclean and sanitary, and that residents in them receive adequate medical monitoring, adequate \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-GLR   Document 1   Filed 02/20/21   Page 62 of 64\nhygiene products, reading material, reasonable access to phones, a daily change of clothes, and the \nopportunity to shower once daily; \nn)  An order that CDF immediately create and implement a plan that complies with \nCDC Guidance to minimize transmission to and provide adequate medical monitoring and care to \nresidents who are medically vulnerable to COVID; \no)  To the extent it is necessary to ensure constitutionally sufficient procedures or to \nprotect certain residents’ constitutional rights, order the Warden to transfer residents to another \nappropriate facility; \np)  An order that CDF provide a list of all medically vulnerable residents, as defined \nby plaintiffs’ expert declarations, to Plaintiffs’ counsel within 24 hours; \nq)  An order that CDF immediately offer vaccinations to all members of the Medically \nVulnerable Subclass who qualify as “high risk,” as defined by Maryland guidance (Currently, \nMaryland’s  vaccination  phase  includes  “high  risk”  residents  of  jails  and  prisons.

Defendants shall continue or implement the following \npractices and procedures arising from the COVID-191 outbreak at CDF to ensure the \nhealth and safety of detainees/residents2 of CDF and HMF, in accordance with the \nparties’ agreement and CDC recommendations. Terms that are based upon, or reflect, \ncurrent  CDC  recommendations  and/or  guidelines  will  adopt  and  incorporate  any \nchanges to the CDC’s recommendations.  \n1.  Treatment of “high risk” residents: \ni.  Defendants shall identify “high risk” residents upon admission to the \nfacility. \n1.  “High  risk”  residents  are  defined  as  residents  with  certain \nmedical conditions and older residents. \na.  Residents  with  certain  medical  conditions  are  those \nindividuals identified by the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention who are, or might be, at increased risk of \nsevere  illness  from  COVID-19,  lists  of  which  are \navailable  at  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-\nconditions.html. \nb.  Older residents are residents over the age of 65, whom \nMaryland has classified as being eligible for vaccines in \nPhase  1C,  see \nhttps://covidlink.maryland.gov/content/vaccine/. \n                                                 \n1 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, commonly called the “novel \ncoronavirus” or “coronavirus” is a highly contagious and transmissible virus. The virus frequently \nresults in a disease, COVID-19. The Terms Sheet and Settlement Agreement refer to both the virus \nand the disease as “COVID” or “COVID-19.” \n2 The Terms Sheet and Settlement Agreement refer to all individuals in custody at CDF and HMF \nas “detainees,” “residents,” and “detainees/residents.” These terms all refer to the same individuals \nand are not intended to have any different meaning. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 70-2   Filed 04/15/21   Page 2 of 18\n2.  “High risk” residents shall include residents on the “chronic care \nlist,” which is defined by Defendants’ medical provider. \n3.  Medical staff shall ensure that these residents on the “chronic \ncare” list are given, at a minimum, twice daily checks of these \nresidents’ vital signs and symptoms, while in quarantine or \nisolation. \nii.  “High  risk”  residents  shall  be  prioritized  for  housing  in  single \noccupancy cells, whether they are on general population, quarantine, or \nisolation. \n2.  Isolation and quarantine \ni.  When Defendants remove a resident from a housing unit for placement \nin isolation or quarantine, Defendants shall wait a specified period of \ntime, then sanitize the cell of the removed resident after waiting that \nperiod  of  time,  per  the  guidelines  of  the  American  Correctional \nAssociation and the CDC guidelines. \n1.  Defendants shall not move a resident into the cell of the removed \nresident  prior  to  the  passage  of  at  least  four  hours  and \nsanitization of the cell in full compliance with CDC guidelines. \nSanitization shall happen after the passage of four hours. \n2.  Defendants  shall  sanitize,  in  full  compliance  with  CDC \nguidelines, all common areas in the housing unit of the removed \nresident prior to residents using common areas. \n3.  Defendants shall maintain records of the above, if Defendants \npreviously maintained such records.  \nii.  When a resident’s COVID test returns as positive, Defendants shall \nimmediately remove the positive resident from the resident’s housing \nunit for isolation. Defendants shall ensure that the positive resident is \nnot present in any common areas of the housing unit from which the \nresident is being removed except for movement out of the housing unit. \niii.  Defendants shall provide clean and safe living conditions for residents \nin quarantine or isolation. \n1.  Defendants shall provide clean and sanitized fabric clothing to \nresidents in quarantine or isolation. \n2.  Defendants  shall  provide  a  living  environment  with  a \ntemperature at or above 65 degrees for residents in quarantine or \nisolation. \n3.

Defendants shall ensure that that this happens no \nlater than 48 hours after the residents are moved.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 70-2   Filed 04/15/21   Page 3 of 18\n5.  Defendants  shall  provide  a  pest-free  living  environment  to \nresidents in quarantine or isolation.  \n6.  Defendants shall evaluate residents at intake for mental health \nissues,  schedule  residents  for  follow-up  when  needed,  and \nprovide sick call slips to residents to request mental health \nservices when on quarantine or isolation. \niv.  Defendants shall quarantine the cellmates of residents who test positive. \n3.  Weekly testing, close contacts, contact tracing, and quarantine. \ni.  Defendants shall ensure that all detainees/residents, staff, and contracted \nstaff are administered a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID test \non a weekly basis, with the exception of individuals who have tested \npositive for COVID in the 90 days preceding the test administration. \nIndividuals who test positive for COVID shall be exempt from weekly \ntests until 90 days have passed after their most recent positive test, at \nwhich point weekly testing for them will resume. \nii.  Defendants  shall  identify  “close  contacts”  of  COVID-positive \nindividuals. The parties agree to define “close contacts” as including \nany  detainee/resident  living  in  the  same  pod  with  a  positive \ndetainee/resident, both upper and lower tiers. This may include up to 23 \nother  detainees/residents.  Other  close  contacts  will  be  defined  in \naccordance with “COVID-19 Contact Tracing Protocol for Inmates and \nContractor Staff,” attached to OOS IB #2020-08. \niii.  Upon learning of a positive test result pursuant to testing at Defendants’ \nfacilities, Defendants shall remove the positive-tested detainee/resident \nfrom the pod and place that individual in medical isolation and then \nquarantine detainees/residents who are “close contacts” within their \nexisting pod. \niv.  Defendants  shall  also  inquire  of  the  positive  detainee/resident  and \nreview his or her medical records to determine when he or she first \nbegan experiencing symptoms, if any, to determine the appropriate \nexposure window and to identify other close contacts. For example, if \nanother  detainee/resident  was  living  on  the  pod  shortly  before  the \npositive-tested detainee/resident began experiencing symptoms, but was \nmoved  out  of  the  pod  prior  to  the  positive  test,  the  exposed \ndetainee/resident  shall  also  be  considered  a  “close  contact”  and \nquarantined, in accordance with “COVID-19 Contact Tracing Protocol \nfor Inmates and Contractor Staff,” attached to OOS IB #2020-08. \nv.  Detainees/residents who are determined to be “close contacts” shall be \nquarantined for 14 days. \nvi.  Defendants shall immediately send home any staff members who are \nwithin approximately six feet of positive residents for more than 15 \nminutes without donning personal protective equipment. \nvii.  Defendants shall move “high risk” detainees/residents in quarantine into \nsingle cells, unless an acute mental health or other documented medical \ncondition  necessitates  double-celling.  If  every  “high  risk” \ndetainee/resident cannot be moved into a single cell, Defendants shall \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 70-2   Filed 04/15/21   Page 4 of 18\nuse the ranked tier list provided by its medical contractor of all “high \nrisk detainees/residents,” which is defined as detainees/residents on the \n“chronic care” list. Defendants shall ensure that detainees/residents in \nthe highest tier of risk shall be moved into single cells. \nviii.  Defendants shall provide enhanced monitoring of detainees/residents on \nisolation or quarantine diagnosed with mental-health conditions. This \nenhanced monitoring shall include (1) increased  monitoring of the \ndetainee/resident with medical staff for indicators of self-harm; (2) \nheightened  protections  to  ensure  continuity  of  mental-health \nmedications; and (3) at least one 5-minute conversation per day with \nmedical staff, if the detainee/resident agrees to such a conversation. \n4.  Testing of close contacts. \ni.  Defendants shall administer a PCR test to “close contacts” as soon as \npossible after Defendants learn of the positive result. \nii.  Defendants shall administer a PCR test to “close contacts” at least twice \nin the 7 days following the identification of the individual as a “close \ncontact”:  once as soon as possible after Defendants learn of the positive \nresult, and once during regularly scheduled, weekly facility-wide PCR \ntesting.  \niii.  Upon  learning  of  a  positive  result,  Defendants  shall  immediately \nremove any detainee/resident who tests positive from quarantine and \nplace that detainee/resident in medical isolation. \n5.  Maintaining quarantine cohorts. \ni.  Defendants shall house the following cohorts in housing units separate \nfrom one another: \n1.  Quarantine for newly admitted residents, \n2.  Quarantine for “close contacts” of COVID-positive individuals,  \n3.  Isolation for confirmed positive residents, and \n4.  General population. \nii.  Defendants shall not add any detainees/residents to a housing unit being \nused for quarantine or any other quarantine cohort prior to the expiration \nof the 14-day quarantine period. \niii.  Defendants shall not mix together detainees/residents in quarantine \nfrom different housing units or different cohorts. \n6.  Spreading out detainees/residents and single-cell placement. \ni.  Defendants shall use the space in its facilities not under construction to \nspread out detainees/residents as much as possible. For example, if a \npod  has  12  two-person  cells  and  only  20  detainees/residents,  four \ndetainees/residents will be placed into single cells. Defendants shall \noffer but not require single-cell placements to residents. \nii.  Defendants will offer and, if accepted, provide single-cell placements \nfor those most vulnerable to COVID, as determined by a forced ranking \nof detainees/residents on the “chronic care” list that Defendants or their \ncontractor will produce and provide to Plaintiffs’ counsel. \n7.

Defendants shall reoffer vaccinations to any detainees/residents who \ndeclined vaccination before Defendants started distributing educational \nmaterials.  For  these  detainees/residents,  Defendants  shall  provide \neducational materials prior to reoffering vaccinations. \nvi.  Defendants  shall  ensure  that  vaccinations  are  offered  to  all  staff \nmembers and contracted staff members, along with education about the \nvaccine, by May 1, 2021. \n9.  Limitations on procedures in which residents are given two hours or less \nof out-of-cell time: \ni.  Defendants shall communicate to residents clearly the purpose and \nexpected duration of any period in which residents are limited to two \nhours or less of out-of-cell time per day, as well as of isolation and \nquarantine. \n1.  Defendants’  agents  shall  maintain  records  of  the  above,  if \nDefendants previously maintained such records.  \nii.  Defendants shall not preemptively limit out-of-cell time to two hours or \nless per day as a response to COVID. Defendants shall limit out-of-cell \ntime to two hours or less per day only when moving residents to \ndifferent cohorts, sanitizing areas, conducting contact tracing, or when \nusing  a  “lockdown”  response  for  administrative  or  management \npurposes. \niii.

For example, if a \npod  has  12  two-person  cells  and  only  20  detainees/residents,  four \ndetainees/residents will be placed into single cells. Defendants shall \noffer but not require single-cell placements to residents. \nii.

Nachmanoff on April 5, execution of a Memorandum of Understanding in anticipation \nof settlement on April 6, a follow-up phone mediation with Judge Nachmanoff on April 13, and \nan additional day of negotiation between the parties, the parties reached a Settlement Agreement. \nECF Nos. 70-1 to 70-2 (Settlement Agreement and incorporated Terms Sheet) (collectively, “the \nAgreement”). The Agreement does not require the transfer of residents out of Defendants’ \nfacilities, nor does it require the release of any residents from Defendants’ facilities. Instead, the \nAgreement requires compliance with certain measures to ensure the health and safety of residents \nwhile in Defendants’ custody. \nIn  order  to  ensure  continued  standing  to  require  and  enforce  compliance  with  the \nAgreement, the Plaintiffs move the Court—with Defendants’ consent—to recognize and grant \ncertification of the Settlement Class.1 The Settlement Class would replace the two classes (pre-\ntrial and post-trial detainees) and the sub-class (high risk detainees) originally proposed in the \nComplaint (ECF No. 1), since it is intended to ensure the Court’s ability to enforce the Agreement \neven if the named Plaintiffs are no longer held at the Chesapeake Detention Facility (CDF). Thus, \nthe Settlement Class would include all current and future residents at the CDF and all current and \nfuture residents transferred from CDF to the Health Monitoring Facility at the Jail Industries \nBuilding (HMF), from the Effective Date of the Agreement through the Termination Date of the \nAgreement. Plaintiffs now move this Court to certify the proposed Settlement Class.2 \n                                                \n1 Defendants have also withdrawn their opposition to class certification, consistent with the \nSettlement Agreement. ECF No. 72. \n2 Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the parties consented to the jurisdiction of a Magistrate \nJudge for certain proceedings after the signing of the Agreement. ECF No. 70-1 ¶ P. \n  1 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 76-1   Filed 04/20/21   Page 6 of 15\n  The Settlement Class proposed here is for settlement purposes only.  If the Court certifies \nthe Settlement Class, Plaintiffs will file a consent motion to dismiss the Complaint and all claims \nalleged therein for the Court’s approval, with a request that the Court retain jurisdiction for \nenforcement. \nThe parties believe that the instant motion, as well as the anticipated consent motion to \ndismiss, may be resolved without a hearing. Accordingly, the parties have not noticed a hearing \nfor either.  \nCLASS DEFINITION \n  The proposed Settlement Class is defined in the Settlement Agreement as follows: “All \ncurrent and future detainees/residents3 at the Chesapeake Detention Facility and all current and \nfuture detainees/residents transferred from CDF to the Health Monitoring Facility at the Jail \nIndustries Building, from the Effective Date of the Settlement Agreement to the Termination Date \nof the Settlement Agreement.” ECF No. 70-1 ¶ A. \nBACKGROUND \n  Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Class Certification on February 22, 2021. ECF No. 19. In \nresponse to the Court’s questions about the need for classes and a subclass, Plaintiffs filed their \nSupplemental Memorandum on March 24, 2021. ECF No. 56. Defendants filed their Opposition \non April 2, 2021. ECF No. 62. \nThe parties entered into the Agreement on April 13, 2021. ECF Nos. 70-1 to 70-2. Pursuant \nto the terms of the Agreement, Defendants withdrew their Opposition on April 15, 2021. ECF No. \n72. \n                                                \n3 This filing, the Settlement Agreement, and the Terms Sheet refer to all individuals in custody at \nCDF and HMF as “detainees,” “residents,” and “detainees/residents.” These terms all refer to the \nsame individuals and are not intended to have any different meaning. \n2 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 76-1   Filed 04/20/21   Page 7 of 15\nARGUMENT \n  Certification of the Settlement Class enables the implementation and enforcement of the \nAgreement. In order to avoid taking the Court’s time by repeating arguments already made, \nPlaintiffs adopt the arguments previously advanced in support of their request to certify the \npreviously proposed Pretrial Class and Post-Conviction Class, which are subsumed together in the \nSettlement Class proposed here (except for any arguments supporting separate classes or a \nsubclass). See generally ECF Nos. 19-1 & 56; see also ECF No. 19-1 at 2 (outlining the two classes \npreviously proposed). Plaintiffs also no longer seek the certification of a subclass, in light of the \nterms of the Agreement.  The classes and subclass advocated in the Complaint (ECF No. 1) were \nbased on different forms of relief that could have been appropriate after full litigation of the issues \nraised by the Complaint.  Now that the parties have agreed to a scope of relief for all residents of \nCDF and all residents transferred from CDF to HMF, it is no longer necessary to divide the \nresidents into the classes and subclass proposed in Plaintiffs’ earlier submissions regarding class \ncertification.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs briefly summarize the argument they previously made, as it applies \nto the proposed Settlement Class, with additional case law regarding certification of a class for \nsettlement purposes. Plaintiffs submit that neither notice to putative class members nor a fairness \nhearing is required, in light of the nature of the class (under Rule 23(b)(2)) and in light of the \nparameters of the Agreement.  \nI.  Certification for Settlement Purposes is Appropriate. \nThe Supreme Court has expressly approved the propriety of certifying a class solely for \npurposes of a class action settlement. Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 618 (1997) \n(“[T]he ‘settlement only’ class has become a stock device.”). Federal courts across the country, \nincluding this Court, regularly certify classes for settlement purposes. See, e.g., Weinberger v. \n3 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 76-1   Filed 04/20/21   Page 8 of 15\nKendrick, 698 F.2d 61, 72-73 (2d Cir. 1982) (“[M]ost courts have . . . authorized the parties to \nseek to compromise their differences,  including class action issues  . . .” (internal citations \nomitted)); In re NeuStar, Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 1:14CV885 JCC/TRJ, 2015 WL 5674798, at *2 (E.D. \nVa. Sept. 23, 2015) (“Even before a court has certified a class, . . . plaintiffs may seek to give effect \nto [a] settlement through a settlement-only class.”); Henderson v. Acxiom Risk Mitigation, Inc., \nNo. 3:12CV589-REP, 2015 WL 4608265, at *1 (E.D. Va. Apr. 21, 2015) (approving a settlement-\nonly class); Hutton v. Nat’l Bd. of Exam’rs in Optometry, Inc., No. CV JKB-16-3025, 2019 WL \n3183651, at *3 (D. Md. July 15, 2019) (same); Boyd v. Coventry Health Care Inc., 299 F.R.D. \n451, 457-59 (D. Md. 2014) (same). Certification of a settlement class “has been recognized \nthroughout the country as the best, most practical way to effectuate settlements involving large \nnumbers of claims by relatively small claimants.” In re Prudential Sec. Inc., Ltd. P’ships Litig., \n163 F.R.D. 200, 205 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). “[S]ettlement classes are favored when there is little or no \nlikelihood of abuse, and the settlement is fair and reasonable and under the scrutiny of the trial \njudge.” Id. (citing In re Beef Indus. Antitrust Litig., 607 F.2d 167, 174 (5th Cir. 1979)). \n“Confronted with a request for settlement-only class certification, a district court need not \ninquire whether the case, if tried, would present intractable management problems, . . . for the \nproposal is that there be no trial.” Amchem, 521 U.S. at 620. \nThus, “[i]n determining the propriety of a class action, the question is not whether the \nplaintiff or plaintiffs have stated a cause of action or will prevail on the merits, but rather whether \nthe requirements of Rule 23 are met.” Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 178 (1974)) \n(internal quotations and citations omitted). Similarly, the relevant inquiry for class certification for \nsettlement purposes is not whether plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits of their claims, \ngiven that the parties have agreed to resolve those claims, but rather, whether the requirements of \n4 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 76-1   Filed 04/20/21   Page 9 of 15\nRule 23 are met. In applying Rule 23, courts are to use a liberal, not restrictive, construction of the \nrequirements. Marisol A. v. Guiliani, 126 F.3d 372, 377 (2d Cir. 1997). \nFinally, class certification is particularly favored when, as here, the named plaintiffs assert \ncivil rights claims that are transitory in nature, such that mootness concerns would make it difficult \nor impossible for individuals to litigate the issues outside of the class context. See Gratz v. \nBollinger,  539  U.S.  244,  268  (2003)  (noting  that  class-action  treatment  was  “particularly \nimportant” in a case where the claims of the individual plaintiffs ran “the risk of becoming moot” \nbecause “[t]he class action vehicle . . . provides a mechanism for ensuring that a justiciable claim \nis before the Court”). Relevant here, ensuring that the benefits of the Agreement flow to other \nresidents of CDF is made possible through class certification, even if named Plaintiffs leave CDF \nor HMF. \nII.  The Proposed Settlement Class Satisfies Rule 23(a). \nAs described in Plaintiffs’ earlier filings on this question, Plaintiffs satisfy the four \nrequirements of Rule 23(a): (1) numerosity, (2) commonality, (3) typicality, and (4) adequacy of \nrepresentation. See generally ECF Nos. 19-1 & 56. The question before the Court is even clearer \nthan those raised in these previous filings, as the proposal here is one Settlement Class:  all \nresidents of CDF and all residents transferred from CDF to HMF. \nFirst, as to numerosity, CDF has the capacity to house 500 residents, with approximately \n400 residents currently housed there. In this situation, joinder is impracticable. See Brady v. \nThurston Motor Lines, 726 F.2d 136, 145 (4th Cir. 1984) (“No specified number is needed to \nmaintain a class action.” (citing Cypress v. Newport News Gen. & Nonsectarian Hosp. Ass’n., 375 \nF.2d 648, 653 (4th Cir. 1967)); Rodger v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., 160 F.R.D. 532, 535 (E.D.N.C. \n1995) (“[A] class of as few as twenty-five to thirty members raises a presumption that joinder \nwould be impracticable.”). See also ECF No. 19-1 at 9-10. \n5 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 76-1   Filed 04/20/21   Page 10 of 15\nSecond, as to commonality, the Settlement Class shares multiple questions of fact and law, \nparticularly when the Agreement implements conditions that protect the health and safety of all \nresidents through, for example, increased sanitation, provision of cleaning supplies, provision of \nmasks, implementation of evidence-based policies, and offering vaccination to all residents. The \nDefendants’  willingness  to  address  these  concerns  by  taking  the  actions  delineated  in  the \nAgreement has led to the negotiated resolution here. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. \n338, 350 (2011) (common issues will “generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the \nlitigation” (emphasis original) (citation and quotation marks omitted)). See also, e.g., Coreas v. \nBounds, Civil Action No. TDC-20-0780, 2020 WL 5593338, at *7, *13 (D. Md. Sept. 18, 2020) \n(granting certification of class in immigration-detention challenge, noting that “numerous federal \ncourts across the nation have certified, provisionally or otherwise, class actions brought by \nimmigration  detainees  through  habeas  petitions  during  the  ongoing  COVID-19  pandemic” \n(collecting cases); noting that “[t]he claims do not have to be factually or legally identical” (citing \nBroussard v. Meineke Discount Muffler Shops, Inc., 155 F.3d 331, 344 (4th Cir. 1998)). See also \nECF No. 19-1 at 10-14.4  \nThird,  as  to  typicality,  the  Plaintiffs’  claims,  as  embodied  in  the  resolution  in  the \nAgreement, are typical of the Settlement Class. Typicality tends to merge with commonality, as it \ndoes here. “Both serve as guideposts for determining whether under the particular circumstances \nmaintenance of a class action is economical and whether the named plaintiff’s claim and the class \nclaims are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately \nprotected in their absence.” Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 158, n.13 (1982). See \nInt’l Woodworkers of Am., AFL-CIO, CLC v. Chesapeake Bay Plywood Corp., 659 F.2d 1259, \n                                                \n4 The absence of a subclass seeking habeas release further simplifies this inquiry from the one that \nthe Plaintiffs previously raised before the Court. \n6 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 76-1   Filed 04/20/21   Page 11 of 15\n1269 (4th Cir. 1981) (injuries need not be identical across class members); Hagan v. Rogers, 570 \nF.3d 146, 158 (3d Cir. 2009) (noting that a class met the typicality requirement despite some \ninmates suffering life-threatening injuries and some suffering no injuries at all because “the \ntreatment received by different members of the class [can] vary”). See also ECF No. 19-1 at 14-\n15. \nFourth, as to adequacy of representation, Plaintiffs fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the Settlement Class. Commonality and typicality “also tend to merge with the \nadequacy-of-representation requirement, although the latter requirement also raises concerns about \nthe competency of class counsel and conflicts of interest.” Falcon, 457 U.S. at 158, n.13. Proposed \nclass counsel are competent attorneys capable of representation the interests of the Settlement \nClass. ECF No. 19-2 (declaration explaining experience of proposed class counsel). Meanwhile, \nthe relief reflected in the Settlement Agreement implements health and safety measures that benefit \nthe entire resident population. See also ECF No. 19-1 at 15-16. \nIII.  Plaintiffs Satisfy Rule 23(b). \nPlaintiffs seek certification of the Settlement Class pursuant to Rule 23(b). This provision \nof Rule 23 permits certification in a case in which defendants are alleged to have “acted or refused \nto act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). Courts \nhave repeatedly held that civil-rights class actions are the paradigmatic Rule 23(b)(2) suits, “for \nthey seek class[-]wide structural relief that would clearly redound equally to the benefit of each \nclass member.” Marcera v. Chinlund, 595 F.2d 1231, 1240 (2d Cir. 1979), vacated on other \ngrounds, Lombard v. Marcera, 442 U.S. 915 (1979). See also A. Conte & H. Newberg, Newberg \non Class Actions § 25.20 (4th ed. 2002) (“Rule 23(b)(2) was drafted specifically to facilitate relief \nin civil rights suits. Most class actions in the constitutional and civil rights areas seek primarily \n7 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 76-1   Filed 04/20/21   Page 12 of 15\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of the class and therefore readily satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) \nclass action criteria.”). See also ECF No. 19-1 at 17-18. \nHere, the Settlement Agreement provides for the performance of certain conditions that are \nanalogous to injunctive relief for the purpose of class certification. Accordingly, Rule 23(b) is \neasily satisfied.  \nIV.  Notice and a Fairness Hearing Are Not Required for Certification or Settlement. \nPlaintiffs request the Court to certify the Settlement Class without notice or a fairness \nhearing, in light of the nature of the proposed class and the parameters of the Agreement. If the \nCourt agrees, the Plaintiff will file a consent motion to dismiss for the Court’s approval, with a \nrequest that the Court retain jurisdiction for enforcement purposes after the Court certifies the \nclass. \nBefore the Court is a proposal for a class under Rule 23(b)(2), which relates to declaratory \nand injunctive relief. Plaintiffs never sought damages; the Settlement Agreement does not provide \nfor damages.5 See generally ECF No. 70-1. The Agreement binds Plaintiffs, extinguishing their \nclaims, while providing benefits to them and the proposed Settlement Class. Id. ¶¶ A, B, C, L, U, \nand V. \n“Unlike Rule 23(b)(3), Rule 23(b)(2) neither requires that absent class members be given \nnotice of class certification nor allows class members the opportunity to opt-out of the class \naction.” Thorn v. Jefferson-Pilot Life Ins. Co., 445 F.3d 311, 330 n.25 (4th Cir. 2006) (analyzing \nRule 23(c)(2)(A)). “[O]pt-out rights for class members are deemed unnecessary and are not \nprovided under [Rule 23(b)(2)].” Berry v. Schulman, 807 F.3d 600, 609 (4th Cir. 2015) (internal \ncitation and quotation marks omitted).  \n                                                \n5 Plaintiffs also waived attorneys’ fees and costs as part of the Settlement Agreement, except for \nthose related to enforcement. ECF No. 70-1 ¶¶ L, T.1, U, V. \n8 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 76-1   Filed 04/20/21   Page 13 of 15\nUnlike class action resolutions that require notice, the proposed class members here do not \ntake on obligations. The Agreement provides benefits that flow to all residents of Defendants’ \nfacilities. This is in the form of injunctive relief, not damages. Accordingly, neither Rule 23(b)(2), \nRule 23(c)(2)(A), nor Rule 23(e)6 require notice to the members of the Settlement Class or a \nfairness determination.7 \nPlaintiffs therefore ask the Court to certify the Settlement Class. The parties will also ask \nthat the Court grant the Plaintiffs’ anticipated consent motion to dismiss, approving the Settlement \nAgreement and retaining jurisdiction for enforcement \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  Plaintiffs  respectfully  request  that  the  Court  certify  the \nSettlement Class as defined in this Consent Motion and appoint the undersigned as class counsel. \nA proposed Order is attached.\n                                                \n6 Defendants consent to the arguments throughout this brief. Plaintiffs make one additional \nargument, on which Plaintiffs do not have Defendants’ consent. In Plaintiffs’ view, class members \nare not bound by the Settlement Agreement, and their claims are not extinguished; rather, in \nPlaintiffs’ view, only named Plaintiffs’ claims are extinguished.  ECF No. 70-1 ¶¶ A, B, C, L, U, \nand V. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(1)(B) (applicable when class members will be “bound by the \nproposal”), 23(e)(2) (applicable when “the proposal would bind class members.”). In Defendants’ \nview, Plaintiffs and class members are bound by the Agreement, and the claims of both Plaintiffs \nand class members are extinguished.  \n7 Regardless, the parties agree that the Settlement Agreement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2). Class representatives and Plaintiffs’ counsel have adequately represented \nthe class, negotiating a resolution that provides immediate protection for all residents without the \ndelay of a trial. Id. (A). The Settlement Agreement was negotiated over several weeks, at arm’s \nlength, with the substantial assistance of Judge Nachmanoff. Id. (B). The relief provided for the \nclass protects residents of Defendants’ facilities on an immediate basis. This eliminates the need \nfor an extensive discovery process or evidentiary hearings, the delay in potential relief, the cost of \nlitigation, and the litigation risk to both parties at trial and on appeal. As mentioned supra, \nPlaintiffs have waived attorneys’ fees and costs, too, except for potential enforcement. Id. (C)(i)-\n(iii). The Settlement Agreement and Terms Sheet provide these protections for the proposed class, \nid. (C)(iv), which provides protections for all residents and ensures that steps are taken to reduce \nthe risk of COVID spread and infection for all residents, including those most vulnerable to \nCOVID, id. (D).  \n9 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 76-1   Filed 04/20/21   Page 14 of 15\nDated: April 20, 2021       Respectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/ Alec W. Farr   \nBy: Alec W.

Case No.:  1:21-cv-00428-TSE \n» \nCALVIN  WILSON ev al, \nDefendants.  * \nORDER \nThis  matter  is  before  the  Court  on  Plaintiffs’  Consent  Motion  to  Dismiss,  pursuant  to \nFederal  Rule of Civil  Procedure 41(a)(2). \nUpon  consideration  of the  Motion  and  entire  record,  it  is  hereby  ORDERED  that  this \naction  is  DISMISSED WITH  PREJUDICE,  subject  to the  below provisions. \nThe  Court  APPROVES  the  Settlement  Agreement  and  incorporated  Terms  Shect \n(collectively,  “the  Agreement”)  (ECF  No.  70-1  &  70-2),  which  is  incorporated  in  this  Order  by \nreference. See  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P,  23(c),  41(a)(2).  The Court has already certificd  the Settlement Class. \n(ECF No.  88.)  The  Court finds  this Agreement, entered  into  on  behalf of the  Settlement Class  and \nthe  Defendants,  is  an  appropriate  resolution  of the  case.  The  Court  further  finds  no  evidence  of \nfraud or collusion. \nIn  so  finding,  the  Court  RETAINS jurisdiction  for  enforcement  of the  provisions  of the \nAgreement.  In retaining jurisdiction,  the Court accepts  the parties’  stipulation and agreement  as to \n18  U.S.C.  §  3626(4)(1)(A)  (see  ECF  No.  70-1  9 T),  and  makes  all  necessary  findings  to  retain \njusisdiction  for enforcement of the provisions  of the Agreement. \nThe  Court DISMISSES  the  action  without  costs or fees  to  any  purty,  except those  related \nto  potential  enforcement,  specific  limits  on  which  are  set  forth  in  the  Agreement.  (ECF  No.  70-! \n§T.1) \nIt  is  also  appropriate  at  the  conclusion  of  this  matter  to  compliment  counsel  for  both \nparties for their substantial  and  capable  efforts  to  reach  a  s ensible  and just  resolution  of this  case, \nthereby benefiting  both  the  settlement class and  defendants.  In  particular,  it  is  important  to  record \nhere  that  the  sensible  and  just  resolution  of  this  case  is  owed  chiefly  to  the  exceptional  and \ncapable  efforts of Magistrate  Judge  Michael  S.  Nachmanoff. \nAlexandria.

Case No.: 1:21-cv-00428-TSE \n  * \nCALVIN WILSON et al.,   \nDefendants.  * \n \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ STATUS REPORT TO THE COURT \nREGARDING DISGREEMENTS WITH DEFENDANTS \n \n  On March 17, 2021, as the Court ordered, the parties filed their agreement regarding the \nimplementation of a number of  conditions at the Chesapeake Detention Center (“CDF”). See Dkt. \n50-1. On March 19, 2021, the parties filed the agreement with the signatures of both Defendants \n(“the Agreement”). Dkt. 52-1. Defendants also agreed to comply with certain of Plaintiffs’ \ndiscovery requests, as reflected in the Agreement.   \n  Meanwhile, the crisis continues in Defendants’ facilities. Per the Defendants’ own reports, \nas of March 15, 2021, 11 residents and staff members at the Chesapeake Detention Facility (CDF) \nwere suffering from an “active infection.” Decl. of Warden Wilson, Dkt. 51-3, ¶ 13. Despite the \ncontinued spread of the virus, Defendants will not agree to comply with certain other conditions \nat CDF that are critical to immediate compliance with minimum COVID-related health standards \nas set forth by scientifically-established protocols for isolation and quarantine. These measures are \nneeded to bring Defendants’ facilities into compliance with the Constitution and to stop the \nincrease of positives at CDF. \nAs ordered by the Court, Plaintiffs  now set out those conditions on which there is \ndisagreement, in the order of their significance to creating a constitutionally safe environment for \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 53   Filed 03/19/21   Page 2 of 17\n \nthe residents and staff at CDF.1 Underneath each condition is the corresponding provision of \nproposed relief in the Complaint.  \nUnless directed by the Court to do otherwise, Plaintiffs will bring these issues, as well as \noutstanding discovery issues, before Magistrate Judge Nachmanoff as soon as possible.   \nPOINTS OF DISAGREEMENT REGARDING THE CONDITIONS AT CDF \n(1) An  order  that  Defendants  implement  appropriate  cohorting,  including \nquarantining  and  medical  isolation  procedures,  as  recommended  by  CDC \nguidelines. Compl., Dkt. 1, Relief Requested “j” at p. 61. \n \nPoint of disagreement 1: Defendants will not agree to quarantine all residents who shared \nrecreation time with residents who test positive for COVID-19. Instead, Defendants will agree to \nquarantine only the cellmates of COVID-positive residents. Defendants’ own records for five \nrecent COVID-positive residents from February, for example, make clear that Defendants define \n“close contacts” as applying only to the COVID-positive resident’s cellmate.  Defendants have not \nidentified any other way that Defendants contract trace or otherwise identify “close contacts.” \nPoint of disagreement 2: Defendants will not agree to conduct contact tracing to identify \nother “close contacts” of COVID-positive residents beyond a cellmate. \nImpact on health and safety: By failing to conduct proper contract tracing by identifying \n“close contacts,” Defendants nearly guarantee the continued spread of the virus, which in turn \nguarantees a constitutional violation. Given CDF’s recreation schedule and the size of common \nareas in housing units, every resident who shares recreation time with a positive resident (up to 11 \nother residents) almost certainly qualifies as a “close contact.” By not identifying every resident \nwho shares recreation time as a “close contact” and then quarantining that person, Defendants \n                                                 \n1   Counsel for the Defendants have reviewed these points of disagreement (though not the \ndetailed  argument  about  the  impact  of  these  issues  on  health  and  safety).  Counsel  for  the \nDefendants concur that the parties have reached an impasse on these issues, at least at the present. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 53   Filed 03/19/21   Page 3 of 17\n \ndramatically increase the likelihood of an exposed resident remaining on a housing unit, free to \ninfect the other remaining residents. Relatedly, Defendants appear to be in violation of their own \npolicies on contact tracing and “close contacts.” Protocol for the Department of Public Safety and \nCorrections Services, of which Defendant Green is the Secretary, defines “close contacts” in its \ndetention facilities as residents who were less than six feet away from a positive individual for at \nleast two minutes in a bounded timeframe. DPSCS, Covid-19 Contact Tracing Protocol for \nInmates and Contractor Staff (April 13, 2020), Ex. 1, at 1 (“Identify close contacts who were 6 \nfeet or less from the case for a duration of 2 minutes or longer during the 7-day period preceding \nthe onset of symptoms (if not known, then use testing date[)]”). This practice is also in violation \nof CDC guidance. See CDC, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 \n(COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities (“CDC Interim Guidance”), ECF 1-25,2 \nDefinitions of Commonly Used Terms, Close Contact of Someone with COVID-19. In turn, \nDPSCS’ own protocol requires these identified “close contacts” to be quarantined. Ex. 1, at 2 \n(“Inmates that met criteria for quarantine (close contact determined but asymptomatic) shall have \na quarantine order.”). The failure to comply with internal policies and CDC guidance nearly \nguarantees the continued spread of the virus. \nPoint of disagreement 3: Defendants will not agree to immediately test all residents in \nquarantine (because of exposure to COVID), and are not willing to agree to test such residents \nuntil the next regularly scheduled facility-wide test, which at present occur weekly. \n                                                 \n2  This  Guidance  was  filed  as  an  attachment  to  the  Complaint.  It  is  also  available  at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-\ncorrectional-detention.html.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 53   Filed 03/19/21   Page 4 of 17\n \nImpact on health and safety: Defendants are placing residents who have been exposed to \nthe virus together in a living area, some of whom may have contracted the virus and some of whom \nmay not. By not immediately testing to determine whether any of the exposed residents are in fact \npositive, Defendants create unnecessary risk of positive residents infecting negative residents. \nDefendants should be promptly moving any positive residents to medical isolation to prevent them \nfrom spreading the virus. But at present, Defendants are testing residents in quarantine only on \nregularly scheduled testing days for the facilities—which means that Defendants may be exposing \nnegative residents to positive residents for more than seven days (as results take a few days to \ncome back). This is contrary to CDC guidance. See CDC Interim Guidance, Testing Close \nContracts. \nPoint of disagreement 4: Defendants will not agree not to stop adding residents to a \nquarantine cohort after the cohort is formed.  Defendants also rejected Plaintiffs’ proposed interim \ncompromise by which Defendants would agree to “avoid” adding residents to a quarantine cohort \nafter the cohort is formed. \nImpact on health and safety: Residents who are quarantined from one housing unit have to \nundergo 14 days of quarantine to ensure they do not exhibit symptoms. By mixing in residents \nfrom a different housing unit with the first group after the group is formed, Defendants insert new \nresidents who themselves may have the virus from a different source, i.e., introducing a new source \nof infection. This is an unnecessary risk. Cf. CDC Interim Guidance, Cohorted Quarantine for \nMultiple Close Contacts (who test negative) (“Do not  add more individuals to  an existing \nquarantine cohort after the 14-day quarantine clock has started. Doing so would complicate the \ncalculation of the cohort’s quarantine period, and potentially introduce new sources of infection.”). \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 53   Filed 03/19/21   Page 5 of 17\n \nPoint of disagreement 5: Defendants will not agree to house each resident in quarantine in \na single cell, separated from others. Instead, Defendants have agreed only to prioritize such \nresidents for single-cell housing, noting that “they would need ‘if possible’ language added based \non other institutional circumstances.”3 \nImpact on health and safety: Residents in quarantine can infect one another, as described \nabove. The CDC recommends creating as much as space as possible across quarantined residents. \nCDC Interim Guidance, Definitions of Commonly Used Terms, Cohorting (“While cohorting \nthose with confirmed COVID-19 is acceptable, cohorting individuals with suspected COVID-19 \nis not recommended due to high risk of transmission from infected to uninfected individuals.”). \nPoint of disagreement 6: Defendants will not agree to immediately test any staff member \nexposed to a COVID-positive resident or colleague, or to prohibit exposed employees from \nreturning to work without a confirmed negative test.  \nImpact on health and safety: If Defendants decline to immediately test their staff members \nafter exposure, they cannot ascertain when it is safe for the staff member to return to work. And if \nDefendants do not require a negative test or particular timeframe in which a staff member \nquarantines at home, Defendants are inviting risk into their facilities.  \n(2)  An order that Defendants immediately create and implement a plan that complies \nwith CDC Guidance to minimize transmission to and provide adequate medical \nmonitoring and care to residents who are medically vulnerable to COVID. Dkt. 1, \nRelief Requested “n” at p. 62. \n \n  Point of disagreement 1: Defendants will not agree to house all high-risk residents (whether \nin quarantine, isolation, or general population) in single-occupancy cells, instead only agreeing to \n                                                 \n3   This language comes from edits made by counsel for the Defendants to an overview \ndocument of the points of disagreement. See fn. 1. \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 53   Filed 03/19/21   Page 6 of 17\n \nprioritize such residents for this placement. Defendants again indicate that “they would need ‘if \npossible’ language added based on other institutional circumstances.”4 \nImpact on health and safety: High-risk residents are at greater risk of severe illness if they \nwere to contract COVID. Placing these residents in single cells provides correspondingly increased \nprotection. \nPoint of disagreement 2: Defendants will not agree to house “high risk” residents in \nquarantine in a single cell. Instead, Defendants have agreed only to prioritize such residents for \nsingle-cell housing, noting again that “they would need ‘if possible’ language added based on other \ninstitutional circumstances.”5 \nImpact on health and safety: “High risk” residents are the ones most at risk of a catastrophic \noutcome if they contract COVID. Defendants report that CDF is well under its maximum capacity \nfor residents as of March 17, 2021. Dkt. 51-3 ¶ 1. Even if Defendants decline to house high-\nresidents in general population in single cells, they should absolutely be doing so for high risk \nresidents in quarantine. CDC Interim Guidance, Cohorted Quarantine for Multiple Close Contacts \n(who test negative) (“If cohorting close contacts is absolutely necessary, be especially mindful of \nthose who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Ideally, they should not be \ncohorted with  other quarantined individuals.  If cohorting is  unavoidable, make all possible \naccommodations to reduce exposure for the individuals with increased risk of severe illness.”).  \nPoint of disagreement 3: Defendants will not agree to heightened monitoring of high-risk \nresidents in its facilities, including temperature and symptom checks at least three times daily. \n                                                 \n4   See fn. 3. \n5   See fn. 3. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 53   Filed 03/19/21   Page 7 of 17\n \nImpact on health and safety: High-risk individuals, by definition, are at an increased risk \nof severe illness if they were to contract COVID. Heightened monitoring of such residents would \nensure that health officials will become aware of health issues and those issues can be treated. \nIndeed, the condition Plaintiffs proposes is less stringent than what the CDC recommends, which \nis monitoring of almost all residents in a facility when the facility has a positive test among \nresidents or staff. See CDC Interim Guidance, Management Strategies for Incarcerated/Detained \nPersons without COVID-19 Symptoms (“If individuals with COVID-19 have been identified \namong staff or incarcerated/detained persons anywhere in a facility, consider implementing regular \nsymptom screening and temperature checks in housing units that have not yet identified infections, \nuntil no additional infections have been identified in the facility for 14 days.”). And as noted above, \nas of March 17, 2021, 11 residents and staff members currently have an “active infection.” \n(3) An order that Defendants create and enact CDC-recommended social distancing \npolicies that allow for adequate spacing of six feet or more between residents, as \nwell as a pause on new admissions to CDF pending control of the outbreak. Dkt. \n1, Relief Requested “f” at p. 61; Dkt. 18-1, Relief Requested “b” at p. 5. \n \nPoint of disagreement 1: Defendants will not agree to implementing social distancing \npolicies (such as spacing out residents across cells in housing units), arguing that the facility does \nnot allow for creating six feet of space between individuals with its present population. Instead of \nimplementing such policies or spreading residents out over the facility, Defendants have agreed \nonly to encourage social distancing of residents during recreation.  \nImpact on health and safety: Meaningful social distancing policies (particularly for housing \nresidents) are critical to slowing and stopping the spread of the virus. CDC Interim Guidance, \nDefinitions of Commonly Used Terms (“Social distancing is vital for the prevention of respiratory \ndiseases such as COVID-19, especially because people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-\n2 but do not have symptoms can still spread the infection.”). Small, simple measures—such as \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 53   Filed 03/19/21   Page 8 of 17\n \nsingle-celling (described supra) or leaving a cell open between occupied cells—can combat the \nspread of highly infectious viruses like COVID-19. Id., Cohorted Quarantine for Multiple Close \nContacts (who test negative) (“Employ social distancing strategies related to housing . . . to \nmaintain at least 6 feet of space between individuals.” (emphasis added)). As noted supra, \nDefendants report that they are well under the maximum capacity of the resident population at \nCDF. To the extent that space limitations nonetheless create restraints, they ignore an obvious \nsolution: restricting the resident population size. \nPoint of disagreement 2: Related to this point, Defendants will not commit to decline to \naccept new admissions until 14 days after there are no new positive tests of residents or staff \npursuant to facility-wide testing. Defendants indicate, however, that as of March 17, 2021, they \nare currently not accepting new detainees from the U.S. Marshals Service.  Dkt. 51-3 ¶ 4. \n Impact on health and safety: Pausing admissions (while the facility straightens out its \npolicies and practices) is critical to ensure that another outbreak will not happen. CDF admitted \ntwo women within the last three months who were housed in units next to COVID-positive men—\nduring the height of the outbreak. See, e.g., Res. Decl. (Dkt. 1-14) (woman who was new admission \nplaced next to COVID-positive men in January); Res. Decl. H (Dkt. 7-1) ¶ 28 (COVID-positive \nmale resident placed next to a different new admission, also a woman, in February). This placement \nis reflected in Defendants’ own housing records, too. Defendants have not implemented the types \nof policies necessary to protect residents and staff alike. Defendants have other facilities in which \nto house residents; Defendants have also indicated that the U.S. Marshals Service has other \nfacilities that it uses to house pretrial detainees for the District of Maryland.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 53   Filed 03/19/21   Page 9 of 17\n \n(4) To the extent it is necessary to ensure constitutionally sufficient procedures or to \nprotect certain residents’ constitutional rights, order the Warden to transfer \nresidents to another appropriate facility. Dkt 1, Relief Requested “o” at p. 61. \n \nPoint of disagreement 1: Defendants will not agree to transfer residents to other facilities \nthat are not experiencing the problems at CDF, despite Defendants’ expressed concern that the \nresident population size may limit their ability to comply with CDC guidance. \nImpact on health and safety: Although transferring residents would presumably eliminate \nthe space constraints that Defendants claim prohibit adequate social distancing and single-cell \nhousing, Defendants do not explain why they decline to transfer residents to a different facility \n(and instead indicate that a court order would  be necessary to begin transfer). Meanwhile, \nDefendants are already using their transfer authority to move residents for medical isolation to the \nJail Industries Building (JIB), sometimes referred to as the Health Monitoring Facility (HMF). \nPoint of disagreement 2: Defendants will not agree to stop transferring COVID-positive \nresidents from CDF to the Jail Industries Building.6 \nImpact on health and safety: As described in the Complaint, JIB is an inappropriate facility \nfor individuals who are recovering from a dangerous virus. Dkt. 1 ¶¶ 162-179 (describing residents \nwearing paper clothing despite broken windows and low temperatures, absence of cleaning \nprocedures, and deprivation of necessary medications to individuals with preexisting conditions, \n                                                 \n6  Plaintiffs’  request  is  that  Defendants  stop  transferring  residents  at  CDF  to  JIB,  not  that \nDefendants close JIB altogether. Defendants have misunderstood Plaintiffs’ requests. See Dkt. 51-\n1 at 10 (“The plaintiffs have asked this Court to order that the HMF be closed . . . “). Per \nDefendants’ own explanations, JIB houses detainees and inmates from other of Defendants’ \nfacilities, not just from CDF. Dkt. 51-3 ¶ 6(k) (explaining that JIB is used for “inmates and \ndetainees in the Central Region”). Per Defendants’ report, JIB houses five “inmates and detainees” \nat present. Id. Plaintiffs’ request is limited: that Defendants stop transferring CDF residents to JIB.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 53   Filed 03/19/21   Page 10 of 17\n \namong  other  things).  Medical  isolation  should  be  a  safe,  clean,  and  medically  appropriate \nenvironment, not one in which residents are deprived of basic necessities.  \n(5) An order that CDF provide adequate medical care to residents, whether because \nof COVID symptoms, chronic health conditions, or any other medical issue. Dkt. \n1, Relief Requested “e” at p. 61. \n \n  Point of disagreement: Defendants will not agree to immediately provide all residents in \nisolation or quarantine with all required and / or prescribed medications and treatments that they \nwere given prior to being moved to isolation or quarantine. Instead, Defendants have agreed to \nprovide “clean and safe living conditions for residents in quarantine or isolation”7 and to provide \nmedication to residents in isolation or quarantine within 48 hours of their transfer.  \n  Impact on health and safety: Residents in isolation or quarantine are most in need of their \nmedications and treatments—not within two days of their being transferred, but on their normal \nmedication  schedule.  An  asthmatic  resident  in  isolation,  for  example,  is  most  at  risk  of  a \ncatastrophic  outcome  resulting  from  a  lack  of  access  to  an  inhaler.  This  problem  is  not \nhypothetical; at least one resident who was sent to isolation at the Jail Industries Building in early \nFebruary was denied access to his inhaler. Res. Decl. B (Dkt. 2-1) ¶ 10 (“I went from Tuesday, \nFebruary 2, to Saturday, February 6, without my inhalers at JI.”). See also, e.g., Res. Decl. H (Dkt. \n7-1) ¶¶ 19-25, 30 (describing how a resident transferred to JI was denied prescribed antibiotics for \na wound for at least two days).  \n(6) An  order  that  CDF  immediately  offer  vaccinations  to  all  members  of  the \nMedically  Vulnerable  Subclass  who  qualify  as  “high  risk,”  as  defined  by \nMaryland guidance. Dkt. 1, Relief Requested “q” at p. 62). \n \n  Point of disagreement: Defendants will not agree to immediately offer vaccinations to all \n                                                 \n7   Agreement, Dkt. 52-1, p. 3, ¶ 15. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 53   Filed 03/19/21   Page 11 of 17\n \nhigh-risk residents, instead agreeing to offer these vaccinations when available and  to take \nreasonable steps to secure supplies. Despite Maryland having entered Phase 1B in mid-January, \nwhich makes “high-risk incarcerated individuals” eligible for vaccination, see Compl., Dkt. 1 ¶ \n21, Defendants have declined to offer vaccinations to all “high-risk” residents. See Dkt. 51-3 ¶ 10 \n(Warden Wilson mistakenly indicating that “detainees below the age of 65 who are at increased \nrisk of severe covid-19 [illness] are grouped in Phase Two,” and noting that “[v]accinations have \nnot yet begun for Phases 2 and 3”).  \n  Impact on health and safety: Vaccinating as many vulnerable residents as possible will \nameliorate some of the risk to this population and lessen the burden on the facility going forward. \nIn addition, vaccinating as many residents and staff as possible moves the facility closer to herd \nimmunity. Vaccinations also reduce the need for single-cell placement for high-risk residents. In \nmisunderstanding Maryland’s own prioritization for vaccinations, Defendants have put residents \nand staff alike at grave risk, particularly those who are most vulnerable to severe illness. This \nmisunderstanding  also  violates  CDC  guidance.  See  CDC,  COVID-19  Vaccine  FAQs  in \nCorrectional  and  Detention  Centers,  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/community/correction-detention/vaccine-faqs.html  (“Jurisdictions  are  encouraged  to \nvaccinate staff and incarcerated/detained persons of correctional or detention facilities at the same \ntime because of their shared increased risk of disease. Outbreaks in correctional and detention \nfacilities are often difficult to control given the inability to physically distance, limited space for \nisolation  or  quarantine,  and  limited  testing  and  personal  protective  equipment  resources. \nIncarcerated or detained persons living in correctional and detention facilities may also be older or \nhave high-risk medical conditions that place them at higher risk of experiencing severe COVID-\n11 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 53   Filed 03/19/21   Page 12 of 17\n \n19. COVID-19 outbreaks in correctional and detention facilities may also lead to community \ntransmission.” (emphasis added)). \n(7) An order that CDF ensure each resident receives, free of charge: (1) an individual \nsupply of liquid hand soap and paper towels sufficient to allow frequent hand \nwashing and drying each day; (2) tissues; and (3) adequate access to a supply of \ncleaning and disinfectant products effective against COVID to allow for cleanings \nof frequently-touched surfaces several times per day. Dkt. 1, Relief Requested “c” \nat p. 60. \n   \nPoint  of  disagreement:  Defendants  will  not  agree  to  a  periodic  schedule  of  soap \ndistribution, including Plaintiff’s request that Defendants provide a bar of soap to each resident \nevery two weeks and to provide a bar of soap if a resident requests one prior to the expiration of \nthe two weeks. Instead, Defendants will agree only to provide a bar of soap to each resident and \nprovide additional bars of soap on request if a resident runs out of soap.  \n  Impact  on  health  and  safety:  Defendants’  proposed  non-specific,  non-periodic \ncommitment  is  inadequate  because  residents  report  that  CDF  does  not  provide  soap  when \nrequested by Residents. Res. Decl. B (ECF 2-1), ¶ 43 (“When I was first at CDF, they gave out \nsoap at least once a month. But CDF hasn’t given out bars of soap in two or three months.”); Res. \nDecl. D. (ECF 4-1) ¶ 26 (“I have asked for more soap from CDF staff. They say that they are \nworking on it, but I never hear back, and they have never given me any.”); Res. Decl. F (ECF 5-\n1) ¶ 16 (“I buy all my hygiene items, like soap, from commissary. . . . I’ve requested those things \nbefore from CDF, and COs didn’t get that stuff.”). Some residents have had to buy soap from \ncommissary as a result. Res. Decl. D. (ECF 4-1) ¶ 27 (“Because of that, I have had to buy soap \nwith my own money from the commissary, even during this pandemic.”); Res. Decl. K (ECF 1-\n12) ¶ 7 (“I had to purchase some soap from commissary this week because CDF didn’t give me \nany soap.”)  Agreeing to a particular timeframe on soap distribution avoids unnecessary disputes \nabout Defendants’ agents’ responses to requests for an essential hygiene item.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 53   Filed 03/19/21   Page 13 of 17\n \n(8)  An order that CDF end preemptive lockdown procedures and instead impose \nappropriate time-limited lockdown-like procedures, with that time limit clearly \ncommunicated to residents, only when necessary due to a known or suspected case \nof COVID, as recommended by medical and public health professionals. Dkt. 1, \nRelief Requested “i” at p. 61.  \n \nPoint of disagreement 1: Defendants will not agree to limit the duration of lockdown \nprocedures for COVID-related reasons (that is, to move residents to different cohorts, to sanitize \nareas, or to conduct contact tracing) to a particular timeframe, including Plaintiffs’ suggestion of \n24 hours. Defendants indicated that they need to retain discretion on how long these processes may \ntake to resolve. \nImpact  on  health  and  safety:  Limitless  lockdown—which  has  been  shown  to  cause \npsychological harm to residents—is frowned upon by the Fourth Circuit. Porter v. Clarke, 923 \nF.3d 348, 357 (4th Cir. 2019) (finding that conditions wherein death-row inmates spent “between \n23 and 24 hours a day alone in a small . . . cell with no access to congregate religious, educational, \nor social programming—pose[d] a substantial risk of serious psychological and emotional harm.”) \n(quotations omitted), as amended (May 6, 2019). Defendants can and should limit the duration of \nthese procedures. See, e.g. Dr. Haney Decl. (ECF 29-1) ¶ 26 (“[J]ails and prisons should institute \nsuch lockdowns only where medically necessary to resolve discrete issues, such as sanitizing \ndorms or contact tracing of an infected prisoner. If such lockdowns are employed, for these limited \npurposes, they should be reasonably time-limited.”). \nPoint of disagreement 2: Defendants will not agree to provide substantially the same \nprivileges to residents in isolation or quarantine (or to provide substitutes for the decreased \nrecreation time or other privileges) as those in the general population. \nImpact on health and safety: Maintaining substantially the same privileges, or providing \nsubstitutes, incentivizes residents to come forward to report symptoms of COVID, and are \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 53   Filed 03/19/21   Page 14 of 17\n \ntherefore essential. Dr. Meyer Decl. (ECF 1-27) ¶ 29(c) (“People may be deterred from reporting \nsymptoms out of fear of perceived punitive isolation.”); Dr. Haney Decl. (ECF 29-1) ¶ 26 \n(“Moreover, in extreme cases in which lockdowns are employed, the jail or prison should ensure \nthat inmates are given enhanced access to resources to protect their mental health, such as reading \nmaterial and adequate access to phones. In addition, the jail or prison staff should regularly \ncommunicate with and monitor the physical and mental health of prisoners who are on lockdown.” \n(emphasis added). \n(9) To  the  extent  a  resident  must  enter  lockdown  or  isolation  to  effectuate  an \nappropriate  quarantine  or  medical  isolation  procedure,  an  order  that  CDF \nprovide appropriate mental health services, and, if that resident has a mental \nhealth condition, provide enhanced psychological services in these circumstances. \nDkt. 1, Relief Requested “k” at p. 61. \n \nPoint of disagreement: Defendants will not agree to enhanced psychological services, \ninstead agreeing to “provide appropriate mental health services by” maintaining current mental-\nhealth services.8 \nImpact on health and safety: This is a problem because enhanced psychological services \nare required to protected against deterioration and decompensation. Dr. Haney Decl. (ECF 29-1) \n¶ 21-22 (“Although the adverse effects of isolated confinement are widespread, and jeopardize \nthe physical and psychological well-being of everyone exposed to them, this is especially true for \nprisoners with pre-existing mental health conditions. They are particularly likely to decompensate, \nsuffer worsening depression, and even engage in self-harming and suicidal behavior in response \nto social isolation. .  . . If they cannot be [excluded from lockdown-like procedures altogether], \nthen they must be given access to enhanced psychological services.”) \n                                                 \n8   See fn. 3. \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 53   Filed 03/19/21   Page 15 of 17\n \nCONCLUSION9 \nUnless directed by the Court to do otherwise, Plaintiffs will bring these issues, as well as \noutstanding discovery issues, before Magistrate Judge Nachmanoff as soon as possible.   \n.  \nRespectfully submitted on March 19, 2021,  \n \n/s/ John Fowler \n \nAlec W.

At \nthe status conference, the parties discussed significant points of agreement between them.  It is \nimportant to note that the parties' efforts to reach agreement have already borne substantial fruit \nand the Court compliments counsel for the parties and the parties for their good faith efforts in \nattempting to resolve the important issues that exist in this case. The parties and counsel are urged \nto continue this effort. The parties are directed to submit a formal statement setting forth the points \nof agreement, including specifically what defendant has agreed to do and the timeframe at both \nfacilities, by Wednesday, March 17, 2021. \nIn additionally, to focus the Court on what areas of dispute remain, the parties are directed \nto submit a pleading or pleadings regarding their existing disagreements and the outstanding issues \nin this case by noon on Friday, March 19, 2021. \nAfter the parties have submitted their pleadings regarding the outstanding issues in this \ncase, the parties are directed to avail themselves of the services of Magistrate Judge Nachman off \nto see if the matters can be settled or resolved by agreement.

See Rule 65, Fed. R. \nCiv. P.  The consolidated merits/preliminary injunction hearing will take begin on June 2, 2021 at \n10 a.m. and shall continue until completed through June 4, 2021.1  Because of the accelerated \nschedule in this case and the progress that the parties have already made in addressing the issues \nbetween them, the motion for a temporary restraining order and the consent motion for extension \nof time to file a response to the motion for a temporary restraining order are denied as moot. \nOn February 22, 2021, plaintiffs filed a motion to certify this case as a class action. At this \ntime, it is therefore appropriate to set a briefing schedule on that motion. Although plaintiffs have \nalready submitted their motion, if plaintiffs wish to supplement their motion in light of the March \n12,  2021  status  conference,  plaintiffs  must  do  so  by  Wednesday,  March  24,  2021  so  that \ndefendant's may have time to respond.  Defendants must file a response to the motion to certify \nclass by Friday, April2, 2021. Plaintiffs may then file a reply in support of their motion by Friday, \nApril 9, 2021.  A hearing on the motion to certify class will be held on Friday, April 16, 2021 at \n1:00 p.m. \nAccordingly, \nIt is hereby ORDERED that the parties are DIRECTED to  submit a copy of their \nformalized agreement on or before Wednesday, March 17,2021 by 5:00p.m.  The parties are \nDIRECTED  to  submit  any  pleading  or  pleadings  regarding  any  continuing  outstanding \ndisagreements on or before noon on Friday, March 19,2021. \nIt is further ORDERED that the parties are DIRECTED to contact the chambers of \n1 A subsequent order, issued closer in time to the hearing on the preliminary injunction and the merits, will address \nthe briefing schedule for the preliminary injunction and set a schedule for the submission of witness and exhibit lists. \n2 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 49   Filed 03/15/21   Page 3 of 3\nMaaistrate Judge Nachmanoff to arrange for a settlement conference in order to attempt 10 settle \nor mediale the resolution of any continuing disagreements. \nIt is further ORDERED that the parties are DIRECTED to file a pleading regarding any \nnon-compliance  with  the  matters  already  agreed  to  in  the  March  17.  202 l  agreement  by \nWednesday, April 14, 2021 and a status conference on those matters is SCHEDULED for \nFriday, April16, lOll at 1 :00 p.m. \nIt is further ORDERED that tria! on the merits of this case will be accelerated and \nconsolidated with the preliminary injunction hearing.

Case No.: 1:21-cv-00428-TSE \n  * \nCALVIN WILSON et al.,   \nDefendants.  * \n \n \nJOINT STATUS REPORT REGARDING \nEXECUTED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n  After weeks of negotiation, a day-long settlement conference with Magistrate Judge \nMichael S. Nachmanoff on April 5, execution of a Memorandum of Understanding in anticipation \nof settlement on April 6, a follow-up phone mediation with Judge Nachmanoff on April 13, and \nan additional day of negotiation between the parties, the parties have reached a Settlement \nAgreement.

The Terms Sheet tracks the previously agreed upon Memorandum of \nUnderstanding  between  the  parties  that  was  endorsed  by  Judge  Nachmanoff,  with  some \nclarifications and elaboration agreed to by the parties. \n   A few steps remain prior to the Plaintiffs filing a consent motion for dismissal, with a \nrequest that the Court retain jurisdiction for enforcement. \n  First, the parties will be concurrently filing a joint motion to vacate deadlines and hearings \nand to deny all pending motions as moot, with the exception of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Seal (ECF \nNo. 11), to which Defendants now consent, as well as a narrow issue raised in Plaintiffs’ Motion \nto Compel (ECF No. 63). \nSecond, as to the Motion to Compel, the parties still require the assistance of Judge \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00428-TSE   Document 70   Filed 04/15/21   Page 2 of 3\nNachmanoff in resolving the terms of the confidentiality agreement that will govern the Settlement \nAgreement and incorporated Terms Sheet. This issue has been briefed in Plaintiffs’ Motion to \nCompel (ECF No. 63-1 at p. 14) and in Defendants’ Opposition thereto (ECF No. 69 at 5-6). The \nparties request that they be allowed to use the discovery hearing scheduled for tomorrow, April \n16, to resolve this narrow issue. \nThird, Plaintiffs will be filing a consent motion for class certification for settlement \npurposes only, per the Settlement Agreement.
