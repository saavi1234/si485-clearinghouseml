That others, or a court, might exercise discretion differently in light of the risks presented by a deadly virus is not the relevant calculus. The plaintiffs' emergency motion for preliminary injunction, dkt. 12, is therefore denied. The plaintiffs' motion for leave to file post-hearing responses to the Court's questions, dkt. 36, is granted. The Court considered these responses in deciding the motion. (See Order.)

On January 7, 2021, the Court granted in part the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction and prohibited the defendants from carrying out executions without taking certain precautions. Dkts. 55 and 56. On January 11, 2021, the Court directed the defendants to file sworn affidavits or declarations following each execution attesting to their compliance with the preliminary injunction. Dkt. 60. The defendants filed declarations on January 27 and January 29, 2021. Dkts. 6769. The plaintiffs filed a purported response to those declarations, dkt. 74, asking for a Court order directing the defendants to file a supplemental report documenting their compliance with the preliminary injunction. The Court construes this response as a motion for the Court to order a supplemental report, and that motion, dkt. 74, is denied without prejudice. The plaintiffs have not shown that the discovery process is inadequate for them to obtain the information they seek. If, after discovery, the plaintiffs wish to challenge the defendants' declarations as inadequate, this Order does not prevent them from doing so.

    "summary": "<p>This is a class action lawsuit regarding the potential threat posed by executions at a federal prison during the COVID-19 pandemic. On November 25, 2020, two individuals incarcerated at the Terre Haute Federal Correctional Complex filed this lawsuit on behalf of all those \"currently or who will in the future be incarcerated at [Terre Haute] during the COVID-19 pandemic\" in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The plaintiffs sued the U.S. Attorney General, Director of Federal Bureau of Prisons, and the Warden of Terre Haute Federal Correctional Complex (Terre Haute) under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C 2201, alleging Eighth Amendment violations and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that by conducting executions during the COVID-19 pandemic and allowing an estimated 200 people from all over the U.S. to visit the prison for each execution, the defendants showed deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs' health and safety. The case was assigned to Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson and Magistrate Judge Doris L. Pryor.</p>\r\n<p>On November 30, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for preliminary injunction and a request for expedited consideration. The plaintiffs requested that the court enjoin the defendants from conducting further executions at Terre Haute during the COVID-19 pandemic. After several hearings on the motion, the court denied the plaintiffs' request for preliminary injunction on December 8, holding that the U.S. Attorney General has near limitless discretion to conduct federal executions, subject only to the Eighth Amendment. The court stated that the plaintiffs' Eighth Amendment rights were not violated, since the increased risk of COVID-19 would only result in more COVID-19 cases for those involved in the executions, and not the plaintiffs themselves. The court thus held that the plaintiffs did not meet their burden of showing their constitutional claim was likely to succeed on the merits. 2020 WL 7239527.</p>\r\n<p>After multiple executions were conducted at Terre Haute, the plaintiffs filed a second motion for preliminary injunction on December 28, seeking a prohibition on future executions until inmates no longer faced an unreasonable risk of contracting COVID-19 as a result of the executions. The plaintiffs proposed vaccinating the inmate population at Terre Haute or taking extensive preventative measures, including quarantining and testing execution team members and implementing contact tracing protocols.</p>\r\n<p>On January 7, 2021, the court granted the motion in part and denied the motion in part, assenting to the fact that the previous executions did create a substantial risk that the plaintiffs would contract COVID-19 and suffer serious health consequences. 2021 WL 71168. Although not as extensive as the plaintiffs requested, the court prohibited the defendants from carrying out executions unless they took certain precautions, including enforcing face masks, maintaining contact logs, and implementing testing and contact tracing protocols.</p>\r\n<p>A few days later, the plaintiffs moved for pre- and post-compliance reports, which the court granted on on January 11. The court ordered the defendants to provide the court with a sworn affidavit or declaration attesting their compliance with the preliminary injunction within 15 days of each execution. This motion was later denied as moot after the defendants moved for dismissal due to lack of jurisdiction on February 22. Because there were no more executions scheduled in the near future, the court granted the motion to dismiss on March 16, 2021, and the case was closed.</p>",

The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief enjoining the defendants from conducting federal executions, which drew hundreds of individuals from all over the country and therefore threatened the plaintiffs' safety during the pandemic. In December 2020, the court denied the plaintiffs' first motion for preliminary injunction, stating that, while those involved in the execution were at increased risk of COVID-19, the plaintiffs themselves were not. However, after numerous executions and a demonstrated increased risk to the plaintiffs, the court granted the second motion for preliminary injunction in January 2021. This injunction prohibited the defendants from executing any additional inmates without first taking specific precautions, including enforcing face masks, maintaining contact logs, and implementing testing and contact tracing protocols. In March 2021, the case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction as there were no more pending executions.",

COVID-19 infections are surging in Indiana, with hospitalizations at \nan all-time high. At FCC Terre Haute, 285 inmates and staff member are currently COVID-\npositive. Despite these alarming numbers, the Attorney General of the United States and Federal \nBureau of Prisons have determined that proceeding with the  execution of five condemned inmates \nat FCC Terre Haute in December and January is an appropriate course of action. \nThe plaintiffs are two inmates at FCI Terre Haute who have preexisting conditions that \nincrease their likelihood of severe complications if they were to contract COVID-19. The plaintiffs \nallege  that  the  government's  decision  to  proceed  with  the  scheduled  executions  manifests \ndeliberate indifference to their health. They have moved the Court to enjoin all five executions \nuntil the threat of the pandemic has passed and all inmates and staff at FCC Terre Haute have been \nvaccinated. \nAlthough the Court shares the plaintiffs' concerns that conducting executions at this time \nmay well result in more COVID-19 cases for those involved in the executions, the plaintiffs have \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 37   Filed 12/08/20   Page 2 of 17 PageID #: 702\nnot shown that increased risk extends to them, and thus have not shown a likelihood of success on \nthe merits of their motion. Accordingly, the motion for preliminary injunction must be denied.  \nI.  Background \nA.  COVID-19 in the Community \n \n  COVID-19 has been spreading in the United States since early 2020. It is a highly \ncontagious and deadly disease. While most people who contract COVID-19 experience mild \nsymptoms, the virus can lead to respiratory failure, lung damage, heart damage, neurological \ndamage, and death. The virus is generally spread \"through exposure to respiratory droplets when \na person is in close contact with someone who has COVID-19,\" though there is also evidence that \ntransmission can occur amongst people who are farther apart if they are in enclosed spaces with \ninadequate ventilation.1 Wearing masks, hand-washing, and social distancing help prevent the \nspread of the virus. Id.  \nThis year, more than 13 million people in the United States have tested positive and more \nthan 280,000 Americans have died from COVID-19-related illnesses.2 The virus has upended \nevery aspect of American life. More Americans work from home than ever. Businesses such as \nrestaurants,  movie  theaters,  and  concert  venues  have  shutteredโsome  temporarily,  some \npermanently. Millions of children are attending school virtually. Hospitals' resources are stretched \nto their limits.

The guidelines are derived from the World Health Organization, the Centers for \nDisease Control (CDC), the Office of Personnel Management, and the Office of the Vice President. \nId. The BOP announced agency-wide modified operations in response to COVID-19 on March 13, \n2020,21 and the modifications remain in place to date. Id. BOP-wide modifications include the \nfollowing measures, among others: (1) all staff, contractors, and visitors undergo temperature \nchecks and COVID-19 screenings, with those who register a temperature of 100.4ยฐ Fahrenheit or \nhigher denied access to the grounds; (2) as much as possible, staff are being assigned to the same \nposts and are not rotating; (3) inmate movement is limited so as to prevent congregating and to \nmaximize social distancing; (4) all new intakes to an institution are screened for COVID-19, and \nthose who test positive or exhibit symptoms are placed in medical isolation, while those who test \nnegative and are asymptomatic are placed in quarantine. Id.  \nAt FCC Terre Haute, policies in place require all staff, inmates, and visitors to wear masks \ninside the institution, and masks are provided if a visitor does not have one. Id. at ยถ 9. Social \ndistancing is practiced \"[w]here possible.\" Id. Staff are required to self-report any COVID-19 \nexposure (known or suspected) as well as any positive COVID-19 test. Id. at ยถ 10.

FCC Terre Haute has multiple rapid Abbot test \nmachines which are used to immediately test symptomatic inmates (and asymptomatic inmates \nwith whom the sick inmates have been in close contact) in an effort to isolate and quarantine them \nmore quickly. Id. at ยถ 12.  \nEach execution will bring approximately 50 to 125 individuals to FCC Terre Haute. \nDkt. 28-1 at ยถ 16. Each execution requires the efforts of approximately 40 BOP employees brought \nfrom out-of-state facilities (\"the execution team\") and approximately 70 FCC Terre Haute staff. \nId. at ยถยถ 16โ17, 22. The execution team does not quarantine upon their arrival in Indiana because \nthey generally arrive only a few days prior to a scheduled execution. Id. at ยถ 17. The execution \nteam is primarily engaged in duties in and around the execution facility and generally does not \ninteract with inmates outside of the execution facility. Id. The execution team generally does not \nenter the FCI, USP, or FPC while at FCC Terre Haute, although some members of the team interact \nwith FCC Terre Haute personnel incident to their role in the operation of the execution. Id. During \nthese interactions, \"BOP staff are required to wear masks and to the extent possible remain socially \ndistanced.\" Id. The FCC Terre Haute staff who help facilitate execution-related events have duties \nsuch as managing check points and perimeter security, staffing the command center, and escorting \nwitnesses and demonstrators. Id. at ยถ 22. These \"FCC staff will have some interaction with both \nthe public and the BOP personnel attending the execution.\" Id. \nOther individuals who otherwise would not be at FCC Terre Hauteโincluding media \nwitnesses, members of the defendants' legal team, victims' family members, and inmates' family \nmembersโalso congregate at the prison to witness the execution. Id. at ยถ 16. These individuals do \nnot enter FCI or interact with any FCC Terre Haute inmates other than the condemned. Id. at ยถ 19. \nAlthough demonstrators are permitted to demonstrate on FCC Terre Haute grounds, so far none \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 37   Filed 12/08/20   Page 9 of 17 PageID #: 709\nhave chosen to come onto the grounds, instead electing to demonstrate in an area across the street \nfrom the property. Id. at ยถ 21. If demonstrators choose to enter the property, they will be screened \nand temperature checked. Id. Further, the demonstration area is near the main public road and not \nnear any of the prison buildings. Id. \nCOVID-19 tests for BOP employees are conducted on a voluntary basis. Id. at ยถ 23. Eight \nfederal executions have taken place this year, and only five to seven members of the BOP \nexecution team have elected to be tested after returning to their home communities. Id. In July, a \nBOP staff member who had interacted with the execution team tested positive for COVID-19 \nbefore an execution. Hartkemeyer v. Barr, 2:20-cv-00336-JMS-DLP, dkt. 77-1. Per BOP policy, \ncontact tracing was immediately initiated to determine the staff member's close contacts, and no \nadditional cases of COVID-19 were discovered as a result of traced persons' contact with the \ninfected member. Dkt. 28-1 at ยถ 24. \nAlthough  safety  measures  have  been  implemented,  enforcement  is  another  matter. \nOrlando Hall was the last person to be executed at FCC Terre Haute on November 19, 2020. \nMr. Hall's spiritual advisor, Yusuf Ahmed Nur, witnessed the execution and observed several \ninstances of non-compliance with the aforementioned policies. To attend the execution, Mr. Nur \ndrove to the Vigo County Sheriff's office parking lot, where a BOP staff member drove him, three \nwitnesses, two prison officials, and a chaplain in a van to USP for processing. Dkt. 13-29 at ยถ 5. \nThe eight individuals were in the van with the windows rolled up for about 15 minutes. Id. He \nobserved several BOP staff either not wearing masks or wearing them incorrectly. Dkt. 13-29 at \nยถยถ 8, 11, 18. Mr. Nur alleges that neither of the two executioners wore masks at all within the \nexecution chamber, id. at ยถ 15, but another witness attested that the two individuals wore masks \nexcept to make announcements as the execution process began, dkt. 33-2 at ยถยถ 6โ7.

Mr. Nur believes he \ncontracted COVID-19 because of his participation in Mr. Hall's execution, but given his contact \nwith his children and a host of other unknowns, the source of his illness is uncertain.  \nSix execution team members also tested positive for COVID-19 approximately a week \nafter Mr. Hall's execution. Dkt. 33-2 at ยถ 8. The government did not advise Mr. Nur about the \npositive tests amongst the execution teamโalthough any contact between the COVID-positive \nexecution team members and Mr. Nur is unclearโnor did the government contact Mr. Nur \nregarding his positive COVID-19 test results to conduct any contact tracing. Dkt. 29-6 at ยถยถ 9โ10. \nThe COVID-positive execution team members are following CDC guidelines with respect to \nwhether they will travel to Terre Haute for the December executions. Dkt. 33-2 at ยถ 9. \nPlaintiffs Smith and Holm reside in FCI and thus do not interact with inmates on death \nrow, who reside at USP, or with anyone in the execution facility. At FCI, they have also personally \nobserved flouting of the COVID-19 safety policies, including lack of proper social distancing, \nlittle or no access to soap, lack of mask enforcement, sick inmates serving food, and a two-week \ndisruption of hot water. Dkts. 13-15 at ยถยถ 30โ32, 40โ43; 13-21 at ยถ 17โ23. Mr. Smith also believes \nfrom personal observation that there have been more COVID-19-related inmate deaths at FCC \nTerre Haute than reported on the BOP website. Dkt. 13-15 at ยถ 28. The plaintiffs' observations, of \ncourse, are not specific to execution-related events but the operation of the facility generally. \nSignificantly, the plaintiffs acknowledge that these violations that affect them directly are not the \nsubject of this lawsuit. See dkt. 31 at 13 (\"While the COVID-mitigation efforts at FCC Terre Haute \nhave indeed been insufficient, they are not the subject of this lawsuit.\"). \nAccording to the plaintiffs, the number of positive COVID-19 cases at FCC Terre Haute \nincreased after the executions that took place in August and September. Dkt. 13-27 at ยถยถ 25; \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 37   Filed 12/08/20   Page 11 of 17 PageID #: 711\ndkt. 13-1 at ยถยถ 60โ62. Three executions took place the week of August 23, when there were 26 \npositive cases at FCC Terre Haute. The next week, there were 88 positive cases, followed by \nanother 32 the following week. After the executions that took place on September 22 and 24, the \nnumber of positive cases amongst inmates went from 2 to 7 new cases (Sept. 27โOct. 3), the next \nweek 8 more (Oct. 4โ10), and the next week 19 more (Oct. 11โ19). After Mr. Hall's execution, \n104 staff and inmates were positive as of November 27, and 285 inmates and staff are positive as \nof December 7.22 However, COVID-19 cases have been increasing in Vigo County and Indiana \ngenerally these past few weeks.23 \nThe Court held a hearing by video on December 8, 2020, to discuss the plaintiffs' motion \nfor a preliminary injunction. Counsel for the government did not know whether any of the 21 staff \nwho are currently COVID-positive were among the 70 FCC staff who performed execution-related \nduties at Mr. Hall's execution. Although contact tracing for the six COVID-positive execution team \nmembers was presumably conducted, see dkt. 28-1 at ยถ 24, counsel for the government did not \nknow if contact tracing for these individuals resulted in the discovery of additional COVID-19 \ncases at FCC Terre Haute. The Court is unfortunately hamstrung by the limited information the \ngovernment chose to disclose.  \nII.  Standing \nThe  defendants  argue  that  the  plaintiffs  do  not  have  standing  to  bring  their  Eighth \nAmendment claim because any future injury is speculative, not traceable to the defendants' actions, \nand cannot be remedied by the relief they seek. Dkt. 28 at 12โ15. But the defendants' standing \narguments rely on a number of disputed facts that need not be resolved at this stage. Compare id. \n \n22 BOP, Covid-19 Cases, https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/index.jsp (last visited Dec. 8, 2020). \n23  Indiana  COVID-19  Dashboard  and  Map,  https://www.coronavirus.in.gov/2393.htm  (last \nupdated Dec. 7, 2020). \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 37   Filed 12/08/20   Page 12 of 17 PageID #: 712\nat 12โ14 (asserting that BOP has implemented \"rigorous safety measures\" and arguing that \nplaintiffs might be infected with COVID-19 whether or not executions go forward), with dkt. 14 \nat 13โ18 (alleging numerous breaches of these safety measures and arguing that executions \nincrease  the  already  existent  risk  of  prisoners  contracting  COVID-19).  The  plaintiffs  have \nsufficiently alleged that carrying out additional executions creates at least some additional risk that \nthey will contract COVID-19. That is enough at this stage of proceedings, so the Court will not \ndismiss for lack of standing. See Booker-El v. Superintendent, Indiana State Prison, 668 F.3d 896, \n899 (7th Cir. 2012) (\"[T]he injury-in-fact requirement can be satisfied by a threat of future harm \nor by an act which harms the plaintiff only by increasing the risk of future harm that the plaintiff \nwould have otherwise faced, absent the defendant's actions.\" (quoting Pisciotta v. Old Nat'l \nBancorp, 499 F.3d 629, 634 (7th Cir.2007)) (alteration in Booker-El). \nIII.  Preliminary Injunction \n  In deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction to stay an execution, the Court must \nconsider \"(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on \nthe merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance \nof the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the \npublic interest lies.\" Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009). \"The first two factors . . . are the \nmost critical.\" Id. The burden to show \"likely\" success is lightest when the prospect of irreparable \ninjury is greatest, and vice versa. Mays v. Dart, 974 F.3d 810, 822 (7th Cir. 2020).   \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nThe  Eighth  Amendment  prohibits  cruel  and  unusual  punishment.  Corollary  to  this \nprohibition is a duty upon prison officials, who must \"ensure that inmates receive adequate \nfood, clothing, shelter, and medical care, and must 'take reasonable measures to guarantee the \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 37   Filed 12/08/20   Page 13 of 17 PageID #: 713\nsafety of the inmates.'\" Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994) (quoting Hudson v. Palmer, \n468 U.S. 517, 526โ27 (1984)). To prove Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference, the plaintiffs \nmust show that the defendants knew of, but disregarded, a \"substantial risk of harm\" to their health. \nGoodloe v. Sood, 947 F.3d 1026, 1030โ31 (7th Cir. 2020). The level of disregard required is \nroughly equivalent to criminal recklessness. Davis v. Kayira, 938 F.3d 910, 915 (7th Cir. 2019).  \nThe defendants do not dispute that contracting COVID-19 would be a serious harm. But \nthey argue that conducting executions in the manner they have planned does not constitute \ndeliberate indifference toward the plaintiffs.  \nThe plaintiffs make well-supportedโthough disputedโallegations that the defendants and \nprison staff could do more to prevent COVID-19 transmission in the prison. See, eg., dkt. 14 \nat 13โ14 (alleging that social distancing is impossible even in communal areas, that inmates \ncommonly interact with others who have recently tested positive, that protective equipment is \nlacking, that inmates are required to reuse masks for months at a time, and that mask use is not \nenforced); see also dkts. 13-5 at ยถยถ 30โ32, 40โ43; 13-21 at ยถ 17โ23 (supporting declarations). \nWhile certainly most disturbing, these allegations do not demonstrate a strong likelihood of \nsuccess on the plaintiffs' claim that the defendants have shown deliberate indifference by making \nthe decision to proceed with executions.  \nThe plaintiffs also make well-supportedโthough disputedโallegations that executions, \nlike any mass gathering, are risky during the COVID-19 pandemic. See, e.g., id. at 14โ18 \n(describing multiple close contacts among those present, staff failures to wear masks properly or \nat all, and a spiritual advisor's positive COVID-19 test on November 29, 2020, following the \nexecution of Orlando Hall on November 24). But the plaintiffs will not be present for the scheduled \nexecutions, and the Seventh Circuit has made clear that the defendants have nearly unfettered \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 37   Filed 12/08/20   Page 14 of 17 PageID #: 714\ndiscretion to schedule executions, pandemic or no. See, e.g., Peterson v. Barr, 965 F.3d 549, \n552โ53 (7th Cir. 2020) (rejecting as \"frivolous\" a victim's grandmother's claim to postpone the \nexecution until after the resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure she could safely witness \nit).  \nWhat the plaintiffs do not allege with sufficient evidentiary support is a causal relationship \nbetween the executions and the rate of COVID-19 infections in the general prison population. To \nbe sure, the evidence showsโand common sense dictatesโthat carrying out executions on prison \nproperty with prison staff involved creates some additional risk of COVID-19 infection for \nprisoners, including the plaintiffs. But \"[t]he Eighth Amendment demands that officials ensure \n'reasonable safety,' not that they protect against all risks.\" Estate of Simpson v. Gorbett, 863 F.3d \n740, 746 (7th Cir. 2017). To succeed on their claim, the plaintiffs must show, at least, that the \ndecision to carry out executions during the pandemic creates substantial additional risks for their \nhealth.  \nThe plaintiffs' primary evidence of additional execution-based risk is the increase in \npositive cases at the prison following some of the execution dates. Dkt. 14 at 18โ19; see dkt. 29-2 \nat 7 (graph of new weekly positive cases in Vigo County and at FCC Terre Haute, from March 15 \nto November 28, 2020). But the correlation is not consistent after each execution, and the most \nreasonable inference to draw from the plaintiffs' evidence is that FCC Terre Haute's infection rates \nare driven by the rates of infection in Vigo County. For each notable increase in positive cases at \nFCC Terre Haute, there is a corresponding increase over the prior two-to-three weeks in Vigo \nCounty. See dkt. 29-2 at 7. The correlation is not definitive, to be sure, but it seriously undermines \nthe plaintiffs' contention that executions are driving the increases in positive COVID-19 cases. It \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 37   Filed 12/08/20   Page 15 of 17 PageID #: 715\nis also consistent with the defendants' argument that FCC Terre Haute staff are more likely to be \ninfected outside of work than when interacting with the execution team. \nThe plaintiffs appeal to common sense and imply causation from some level of correlation \nbetween executions and COVID-19 cases at FCC Terre Haute. But without compelling scientific \nor statistical evidence, they do not have a strong likelihood of success on their Eighth Amendment \nclaim.   \nB.  Irreparable Injury, Defendants' Interests, and Public Interests \nThe  irreparable  injury  analysis  here  overlaps  significantly  with  both  standing  and \nlikelihood of success. As discussed above, the plaintiffs have not shown that they are likely to be \ninfected with COVID-19 because of the scheduled executions, and thus have no demonstrated an \nirreparable injury.  \nThe  defendants  have  a  substantial  legal  interest  in  timely  enforcement  of  criminal \ndefendants' sentences, such that the Court should not stay an execution lightly. Bucklew v. \nPrecythe, 139 S. Ct. 1112, 1133 (2019) (\"Both the [government] and the victims of crime have an \nimportant interest in the timely enforcement of a sentence.\");  \nFinally, the constitutional right of plaintiffs' and/or the putative class members' to be free \nfrom unreasonable risk of exposure to COVID-19 is a significant public interest. See Awad v. \nZiriax, 670 F.3d 1111, 1132 (10th Cir. 2012) (\"[I]t is always in the public interest to prevent the \nviolation of a party's constitutional rights.\" (quotation marks and citation omitted)). But this factor \ndoes not weigh heavily here because the plaintiffs have not shown that the scheduled executions \nwill create a substantial additional risk to their health.24  \n \n24 The Court makes no finding that the conduct of the executions will not create a substantial \nadditional risk to the health of the other participants in the execution.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 37   Filed 12/08/20   Page 16 of 17 PageID #: 716\nTaken together, the Nken factors weigh against issuing a preliminary injunction, and thus \nthe plaintiffs' motion must be denied. \nIV.  Conclusion \nCircuit precedent arising from prior recent executions makes clear the nearly limitless \ndiscretion the Attorney General possesses in conducting federal executions. The only limitation to \nsuch discretion argued here is the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and the \nplaintiffs have not met their burden of showing their constitutional claim is likely to succeed. That \nothers, or a court, might exercise discretion differently in light of the risks presented by a deadly \nvirus is not the relevant calculus.  \nThe plaintiffs' emergency motion for preliminary injunction, dkt. [12], is therefore denied. \nThe plaintiffs' motion for leave to file post-hearing responses to the Court's questions, dkt. [36], is \ngranted. The Court considered these responses in deciding the motion.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n December 8, 2020\n16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 37   Filed 12/08/20   Page 17 of 17 PageID #: 717\nDistribution: \n \nRobert A.

BARR, in his official capacity as the Attorney General \nof the United States, MICHAEL CARVAJAL, in his official capacity as the Director of the Federal \nBureau of Prisons, and T.J.

This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief to protect Plaintiffs from \nserious and substantial risks to their health due to Defendantsโ plan to open the doors of the Terre \nHaute  Federal  Correctional  Complex  (โFCC  Terre  Hauteโ)  to  scores  of  outside  visitors  in \nconnection with upcoming scheduled executions.  \n  \n150291934.1\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JRS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 11/25/20   Page 2 of 20 PageID #: 2\n \n2.  The country is besieged by the COVID-19 pandemic.  More than 58 million people \nworldwide have contracted COVID-19, and more than a million people have died.1  In the U.S., \nmore than 12 million people have tested positive for the disease, and roughly 256,000 people have \ndied.2   \n3.  Indiana has not been spared.  Almost 290,000 people have tested positive, and more \nthan 5,250 people have died.3  And things are getting worse, not better.  With winter approaching, \nthe number of cases in Indiana has been โsignificantly and steadily increasingโ and hospitalizations \nare โat an all-time high,โ prompting Governor Holcomb to issue an Executive Order that imposes \nstricter measures to โcounter the spreadโ of COVID-19, including โsocial distancingโ requirements \nand limits on how many people may convene โin a single space.โ4 \n4.  Incarcerated individuals have no control over their own health and safety during \nthis crisis.  They do not have the option to โsocially distanceโ from others or to limit the number \nof people in their space.  They are at the mercy of those who decide and implement the conditions \nof their confinement and, of immediate relevance here, the polices regarding who is allowed in the \nprison and when such visits are permitted. \n5.  The plaintiffs in this case are incarcerated at FCC Terre Haute.  They are struggling \nto stay safe and healthy during these unprecedented times, and their situation is being made worse \nby the actions challenged in this lawsuit.  \n6.  The Attorney General of the United States and the Federal Bureau of Prisons plan \nto carry out executions at FCC Terre Haute on December 8, December 10, and December 11, 2020, \n                                                 \n1  See Johns Hopkins University of Medicine, Coronavirus Resource Center, at \nhttps://coronavirus.jhu.edu/ (last visited Nov. 22, 2020). \n2  Id. \n3  See https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/us/indiana (last visited Nov. 22, 2020).   \n4  Executive Order 20-48 at 2, 6, 8-9, at www.in.gov/gov/files/Executive_Order_20-48_Color-\nCoded_County_Assessments.pdf.   \n  - 2 - \n  \n150291934.1\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JRS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 11/25/20   Page 3 of 20 PageID #: 3\n \nand on January 14 and January 15, 2021.5  Each execution is expected to result in roughly 200 \npeople, many from across the country, congregating at or near the prison.  These individuals will \ninteract with members of the local community at hotels and restaurants before going to the prison, \nthey will interact with each other and prison staff when they enter the prison, and they will \ncongregate in small and confined spaces in the prison as the executions are carried out.  Many, if \nnot all, of the FCC Terre Haute staff who interact with these visitors will then return to their regular \nduties throughout FCC Terre Haute, including interacting with Plaintiffs and others in the prison \npopulation.  \n7.  The upcoming execution events are putting the individually named Plaintiffs and \nall other incarcerated people at FCC Terre Haute at significant risk of serious illness or even death, \nfor no good reason.  Prior to 2020, there had been only three federal executions in the United States \nin the last forty-three years.6  There is no legitimate justification for holding executions now, at \nthe height of the pandemic, and creating in the process a significant risk of serious health \ncomplications or death for Plaintiffs and all other people incarcerated at FCC Terre Haute.   \n8.  Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit on their own behalf and on behalf of a putative class of \nall incarcerated individuals at FCC Terre Haute, with a modest request:  that the scheduled \nexecutions be enjoined until the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic has passed and Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the Class have received an appropriate vaccine.  This relief will cause no harm to the \nDefendants, but it will ameliorate the significant risk of substantial harm to Plaintiffs and other \nmembers of the class (in addition to countless other individuals). \n   \n                                                 \n5   See  Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Execution Information, at \nhttps://www.bop.gov/resources/federal_executions_info.jsp (last visited Nov. 19, 2020). \n6  See Historical Information, Capital Punishment, at www.bop.gov/about/history/federal_executions.jsp.   \n  - 3 - \n  \n150291934.1\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JRS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 11/25/20   Page 4 of 20 PageID #: 4\n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331. The Court has authority \nto grant declaratory relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201.   \n10.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 because a substantial part \nof the events and omissions giving rise to the claims asserted in this complaint have occurred and \ncontinue to occur in this District. \nPARTIES \n11.  Plaintiff Patrick R. Smith, inmate registration number 53264-074, is incarcerated \nat FCC Terre Haute.  He is housed in C-Dorm at FCI Terre Haute, a medium security federal \ncorrectional institution at FCC Terre Haute.  He is serving a 53-month sentence and his scheduled \nrelease date is January 24, 2022.  Mr. Smith has asthma and hyper-inflated lungs with chronic \ncoarsened interstitial markings, among other health complications.  Mr. Smith has twice sought \ncompassionate release due to his health conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic pursuant to 18 \nU.S.C. ยง 3582(c)(1)(A)(i).  His first request, dated March 26, 2020, was denied by the warden.  He \ndid not receive a response from the warden to his second request, dated June 12, 2020, within thirty \ndays.  He thereafter filed a petition for compassionate release with the United States District Court \nfor the Eastern District of Tennessee, without the aid of counsel.  The court denied his motion. \n12.  Plaintiff Brandon S. Holm, inmate registration number 19005-030, is incarcerated \nat FCC Terre Haute.  He is housed in C-Dorm at FCI Terre Haute.  He is serving a 60-month \nsentence and is eligible for release to a halfway house on April 21, 2023.  Mr. Holm has anxiety \nand regularly suffers from panic attacks and shortness of breath related to his anxiety.  As a child, \nhe had open-heart surgery for a congenital heart defect.  Mr. Holm sought compassionate release \ndue to his health conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ยง 3582(c)(1)(A)(i), \nand currently has a petition for compassionate release or release to home confinement pending in \nthe United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.

Barr is the Attorney General of the United States.  Attorney \nGeneral Barr oversees the Bureau of Prisons (โBOPโ), an agency within the United States \nDepartment of Justice (โDOJโ), and has responsibility over carrying out death sentences against \nfederal prisoners.  He is sued in his official capacity for the purpose of obtaining declaratory and \ninjunctive relief. \n14.  Defendant Michael Carvajal is the Director of the BOP.  He oversees the operations \nof BOP facilities (including FCC Terre Haute), BOP staff, and individuals in BOP custody.   \nDefendant Carvajal is responsible for designating the date, time, and place for a sentence of death.  \nHe is sued in his official capacity for the purpose of obtaining declaratory and injunctive relief. \n15.  Defendant T.J. Watson is the Complex Warden for FCC Terre Haute.  He is sued \nin his official capacity for the purpose of obtaining declaratory and injunctive relief. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  The COVID-19 epidemic is a global health emergency, and Indiana has been \nhit particularly hard. \n16.  In a period of only nine months, more than 12 million people in the United States \nhave tested positive for COVID-19 and more than 256,000 people have died.7   The high mortality \nrate is likely to continue or worsen in coming weeks, as sharp increases in case numbers are \nfollowed a few weeks later by increases in hospitalizations, which are then followed by increases \nin deaths.    \n17.  As of November 15, 2020, 53.7 million confirmed cases and 1.3 million deaths \nfrom COVID-19 have been reported worldwide to the World Health Organization.8 \n                                                 \n7  See Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Data Center, https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/ (last visited Nov. \n23, 2020). \n8  See World Health Organization, Overview, Weekly Epidemiological Update, \nhttps://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update---17-november-2020 (last \nvisited Nov. 19, 2020). \n  - 5 - \n  \n150291934.1\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JRS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 11/25/20   Page 6 of 20 PageID #: 6\n \n18.  This month, Indiana has seen single-day records of reported COVID-19 cases and \nwas โranked 35th in the world in per capita COVID-19 deaths.โ9    \nB.  COVID-19 is a highly contagious and lethal disease. \n19.  In severe cases, COVID-19 can lead to respiratory failure, permanent lung, heart, \nor neurological damage, or death, among other serious complications.  The disease is spread \nthrough respiratory droplets, and the only measure that fully prevents infection is avoiding contact \nwith others.  According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the โCDCโ), \nsocial distancingโremaining at least six feet from all other persons not sharing oneโs householdโ\nis a cornerstone of reducing transmission of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19.   \n20.  As the CDC warns, โthe more people you interact with, the more closely you \ninteract with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and \nspreading COVID-19.โ10 \n21.  According to the CDC, adults of any age with the following underlying medical \nconditions are at increased risk of severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19: cancer, \nchronic kidney disease, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), heart conditions (such as \nheart  failure,  coronary  artery  disease,  or  cardiomyopathies),  immunocompromised  state \n(weakened immune system) from solid organ transplant, obesity, pregnancy, sickle cell disease, \nsmoking, or Type 2 diabetes mellitus.11 \n22.  Likewise, adults of any age with the following underlying medical conditions might \nbe at an increased risk of severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19: asthma (moderate-\nto-severe), cerebrovascular disease (affects blood vessels and blood supply to the brain), cystic \n                                                 \n9  See Indianapolis Star, โIf Indiana were a country, our COVID-19 mortality rate would be 35th worst in \nthe world,โ https://www.indystar.com/story/news/health/2020/11/18/covid-indiana-death-rate-\ncoronavirus-ranks-35th-world/6338823002/ (Nov. 18, 2020).   \n \n10  See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, People with Certain Medical Conditions (updated \nNov. 2, 2020), available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-\nwith-medical-conditions.html) (original emphasis) (last visited Nov. 19, 2020). \n11  Id. \n  - 6 - \n  \n150291934.1\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JRS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 11/25/20   Page 7 of 20 PageID #: 7\n \nfibrosis, hypertension or high blood pressure, immunocompromised state (weakened immune \nsystem) from blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, \nuse of other immune weakening medicines, neurologic conditions (such as dementia), liver \ndisease, overweight, pulmonary fibrosis (having damaged or scarred lung tissues), thalassemia (a \ntype of blood disorder), or Type 1 diabetes mellitus.12 \n23.  Older adults are also at increased risk of severe illness from the virus that causes \nCOVID-19.13  Eight out of ten COVID-19-related deaths reported in the United States have been \namong adults aged 65 years and older.14 \n24.  Men also appear to be at greater risk of death from COVID-19, as more men than \nwomen are dying from the disease.15 \nC.  Incarcerated people are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. \n25.  Prisons are petri dishes for COVID-19.  โThe infrastructure of most prisons and \njails is โฆ conducive to spreading disease,โ similar to what is seen on a cruise ship.16  Indeed, the \nrisk of exposure is even greater for incarcerated people, โas correctional officers and other staff \nfrequently  leave  the  facility  and  then  returnโ  and  โsocial  distancing  is  typically  a  physical \nimpossibility.โ17 \n                                                 \n12  Id. \n13  See  Centers  for  Disease  Control,  Older  Adults  (updated  Sept.  11,  2020),  available  at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html  (last  visited  Nov. \n19, 2020). \n14  Id. \n15  See Derek M.

Nine of the ten largest COVID-19 outbreaks in the country have occurred in \nprisons.18   \n27.  According to a report on the CDCโs website, โ[h]igh COVID-19 attack rates can \noccur in correctional and detention facilitiesโฆ. During May 7-21 [2020], among 98 incarcerated \nand detained persons who were quarantined because of exposure to the virus, 71 (72%) had \nlaboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection identified through serial testing.โ19 \n28.

Conditions at FCC Terre Haute exacerbate the risk of COVID-19 \ntransmission. \n30.  FCC Terre Haute is comprised of three separate complexes, differentiated by the \nlevel of security.  The complexes include (1) a U.S. Penitentiary (USP), which is a high security \ncomplex; (2) a Federal Correctional Institution (FCI), which is a medium level complex; and (3) a \nSatellite Prison Camp (SPC), which is a minimum-security level complex. \n31.  USP Terre Haute has six general population units that are designed as a โbow-tieโ \nwith two floors for non-death row inmates and a Special Confinement Unit (SCU) for death-row \ninmates.    In  addition  to  these  living  quarters,  there  are  dining  facilities,  health  services, \nmaintenance shops, a commissary, a UNICOR factory, and an inmate visiting area.  Buildings are \nin a general square shape, with a large, confined yard for recreational time.  USP has a rate capacity \nof 910 inmates. \n32.  FCI Terre Haute has ten housing units with a rated capacity of 560 inmates.  FCI \nalso has a dining facility, health services, maintenance shops, a commissary, and an inmate visiting \narea. \n33.  SPC Terre Haute has a main building that includes living quarters, a dining room, \nand a gymnasium.  There are eight dormitory-style housing units within the complex, with a total \nrated capacity of 324 inmates.  The units contain two-man, eight-man, and 12-man rooms. \n34.  Two of the three FCC Terre Haute complexes have more inmates than their rated \ncapacity, increasing the already prevalent risk of COVID-19 transmission.  The USP has a rated \ncapacity of 910 inmates but currently houses approximately 1,269 inmates.  The FCI has a rated \ncapacity of 560 inmates but currently houses approximately 875 inmates. \n35.  In the C-Dorm of the FCI Terre Haute complex, where the named Plaintiffs are \nincarcerated, prisoners are housed in cells with more than one person, in close quarters.  Social \ndistancing is impossible, given the small amount of space in the cell. \n36.  Social distancing is also impossible in the communal bathroom facilities.  C-Dorm \nis equipped with 6 toilets, 4 urinals, 10 sinks, and 8 showers for the entire dorm population, along \n  - 9 - \n  \n150291934.1\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JRS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 11/25/20   Page 10 of 20 PageID #: 10\n \nwith 4 soap dispensers.  As of November 12, 2020, one of the toilets was out of order, two urinals \nwere out of commission, and three sinks did not work. \n37.  Social distancing is also difficult to achieve in most other settings within FCC Terre \nHaute.  Inmates are almost never six feet away from another person, whether inside or outside.   \n38.  The use of masks at FCI Terre Haute is inconsistent among both staff and inmates.   \n39.  Inmates who serve food to other inmates continue to serve in this role after testing \npositive for COVID-19. \n40.  Sinks in communal bathrooms are often filthy.  Soap dispensers often do not \ncontain soap, and bar soap is not always available. \n41.  BOP staff and inmates have daily contact in all FCC Terre Haute complexes. \n42.  The BOP reported its first case of COVID-19 at FCC Terre Haute on or about May \n16, 2020.   \n43.  Since then, at least three Terre Haute prisoners have died from the virus, and many \nmore prisoners and staff have contracted COVID-19.   \n44.  According to a recent BOP report, at least 82 inmates and 14 staff members are \ncurrently positive for COVID-19 at FCC Terre Haute, an additional 158 prisoners and 29 staff \nmembers had the virus but recovered, and one prisoner has died; at USP Terre Haute, at least 4 \ninmates and 2 staff members are currently positive, another 91 inmates and 5 staff members had \nthe virus but recovered, and at least 2 inmates have died..23 \n45.  Despite  the  recoveries,  some  individuals  might  become  re-infected  with  the \nCOVID-19 virus.24 \n46.  It is not clear how much of the prison population at FCC Terre Haute (prisoners \nand staff) has been tested, or how the BOP decides whether a death was COVID-related.

Defendants know about the serious health and safety risks of COVID-19 and \nrecognize that movement in and out of prisons significantly increases those \nrisks. \n47.  On March 26, 2020, Defendant Barr issued a Memorandum to Defendant Carvajal \nregarding  โPrioritization  of  Home  Confinement  as  Appropriate  in  Response  to  COVID-19 \nPandemic.โ25  The memorandum authorized Defendant Carvajal to โgrant home confinement for \ninmates seeking transfer in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.โ26  Defendant Barr \nrecognized Defendantsโ obligation to โdo the best we can to minimize the risk of COVID-19 to \nthose in our custody, while also minimizing the risk to the public.โ27 \n48.  On April 3, 2020, Defendant Barr issued another Memorandum to Defendant \nCarvajal, recognizing the BOPโs โprofound obligation to protect the health and safety of all \ninmates.โ28  Defendant Barr charged Defendant Carvajal to โimmediately review all inmates who \nhave COVID-19 risk factors, as established by the CDC,โ starting with facilities where COVID-\n19 was โmaterially affecting operations.โ29 \n49.  Defendants have known for some time that movement into and out of BOP prisons \nwas a source of risk to inmates and to prison staff.  To โmitigate the spread of COVID-19,โ \nDefendants announced at the start of the pandemic that they were heavily restricting movement in \nand out of BOP prisons.30   \n                                                 \n25   See Memorandum for Director of Bureau of Prisons (Mar. 26, 2020), available at \nhttps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/docs/bop_memo_home_confinement.pdf (last visited Nov. 20, 2020). \n26  Id. \n27  Id. \n28  Memorandum for Director of Bureau of Prisons (Apr. 3, 2020), available at \nhttps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/docs/bop_memo_home_confinement_april3.pdf (last visited Nov. 20, \n2020). \n29  Id. \n30  See Federal Bureau of Prisons, โBOP Implementing Modified Operations,โ  \nwww.bop.gov/coronavirus/covid19_status.jsp.  \n  - 11 - \n  \n150291934.1\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JRS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 11/25/20   Page 12 of 20 PageID #: 12\n \n50.  In  March  2020,  BOP  suspended internal  prisoner  movement  โwith  limited \nexceptions.โ31  \n51.  Also in March, BOP suspended all visitation, including legal visits at all federal \nprisons.32    Under  this  policy,  BOP  systematically  canceled  previously  scheduled  visits  and \nrefused to schedule future visits for both contact and non-contact meetings, including at Terre \nHaute.   \n52.  In April, BOP issued a memorandum reporting that stopping visits had a โmajor \nimpactโ on keeping staff, prisoners, visitors, and the community at large safe from COVID-19.33  \n53.   Other measures have also been announced by BOP, including at Terre Haute.34  \nThe measures have been inconsistently implemented and, in all events, have not prevented the \nspread of COVID among prison inmates and prison staff.  \nF.  Defendants know that executions will introduce additional, unnecessary risks \nof COVID-19 exposure at FCC Terre Haute. \n54.  The BOPโs execution plans and protocols anticipate the likely involvement of \nhundreds of individuals in each execution that occurs at FCC Terre Haute.  An โexecution teamโ \nconsisting of some 40, geographically disbursed BOP staff members will spend several days at the \nprison before each execution preparing.  Another specially staffed team of roughly 50 BOP \nemployees will also travel to Terre Haute from other prisons (which might also be experiencing \nCOVID-19 outbreaks).  These teams will be assisted by up to 100 BOP staff at Terre Haute, \n                                                 \n31  See Federal Bureau of Prisons, โUpdates to BOP COVID-19 Action Plan,โ  \nwww.bop.gov/resources/news/20200319_covid19_update.jsp. \n32  See Federal Bureau of Prisons COVID-19 Action Plan,โ at \nhttps://www.bop.gov/resources/news/20200313_covid-19.jsp (updated Mar. 13, 2020) (last visited Nov. \n22, 2020). \n33  See Mem. for Inmate Families and Friends from  M.

The individuals who converge in Terre Haute to participate in the executions will \nstay in local hotels or homes, eat in local restaurants, and use local transportation.  Many will travel \nby air or other public transit.   One or more of those individuals could easily have been exposed to \nor infected with COVID-19 at home, on planes, in airports or hotels, at their BOP regional \nfacilities, or in their communities more broadly.  They will then convene and intermingle in small \nenclosed spaces with staff from FCC Terre Haute, which has numerous known COVID-19 cases \namong its inmates and staff, for group training, practices, meetings, and on-site work.   \n56.  The strict security protocol associated with such executions will enhance the risks \nfor the prisoners, staff, and ultimately anyone attending the execution or later interacting with \nthose who did.   \n57.  Large numbers of media representatives and demonstrators will likely converge on \nor near the prison grounds for each execution.  Those who enter the prison will be subjected to in-\nperson screening and security details.  The media must participate in a Media Orientation at the \ninstitution prior to the execution and, on the date of the execution, will be contained within a single \nMedia Center with communal restrooms.  Demonstrators for and against capital punishment are \ninstructed by the prison to meet at locations in the community for processing by BOP staff and \nthen be transported to the prison in vans.    \n58.  The execution facility, sometimes referred to as the โDeath House,โ is a small, \nsingle story building on the Terre Haute grounds.  In addition to the roughly 40 members of the \nexecution team, federal regulations authorize the attendance of up to 24 witnesses to the execution: \nsix individuals selected by the death row prisoner, including his or her spiritual advisor and legal \nteam, eight citizen witnesses, including members of the victimโs family, and ten members of the \npress.  See 28 C.F.R. ยง 26.4(c)(3)-(4).  Thus, the execution facility might hold, in close quarters, \nthe 40-member execution team, up to 24 witnesses, the death row prisoner, and an unspecified \nnumber of attorneys from the DOJ.  Again, many of these individuals will have traveled great \n  - 13 - \n  \n150291934.1\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JRS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 11/25/20   Page 14 of 20 PageID #: 14\n \ndistances, including by plane or other public transit, and stayed in local hotels and eaten in local \nrestaurants before assembling on the day of the execution.  \n59.  The witnesses to the execution and prison staff will be shuttled together in vans to \nthe execution facility from a designated location in accordance with USP protocol.  In the days \nleading up to the execution, attorneys may be required to visit with their client in the Death House.  \nDuring the execution itself, witnesses are grouped into four separate viewing roomsโone for \nmedia; one for the victimโs family members; one for attorneys, the prisonerโs loved ones, and his \nor her spiritual advisor; and one for government officials.  It is not possible to socially distance in \nthese cramped viewing rooms.  Additionally, those in the viewing rooms cannot see or be seen by \nthe prisoner unless they are inches from the Plexiglass that separates the witnesses from the \nprisoner. \n60.  The fact that the government schedules multiple executions in the same week \nfurther increases the risk of contracting COVID-19 for everyone in the prison population or \nparticipating in the executions.  Three executions occurred the week of July 12, 2020, two the \nweek of August 26, and two the week of September 20; two executions are scheduled for a single \nweek in December, and three more are scheduled for the same week in January.  Each execution \nbrings its own group of counsel, spiritual advisers and family for the inmate who is to be executed, \ntogether with demonstrators, media witnesses, the victimโs family members, spiritual support, and \ngovernment officials from all over the country--all of whom then interact with each other and BOP \nstaff inside the prison and the Death House, and with members of the community outside the \nprison.  Everyone then returns to their families and their communities, having potentially spread \nor contracted the disease before doing so.  \n61.  The number of COVID-19 cases in FCC Terre Haute and in the local community \nincreased after the executions that were held at FCC Terre Haute in July, August and September \nof this year.   \n  - 14 - \n  \n150291934.1\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JRS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 11/25/20   Page 15 of 20 PageID #: 15\n \n62.  The American Bar Association, members of Congress, and others have called upon \nthe federal government to postpone the pending executions because of the health risks they \ncreate.35 \nG.  There is no need to conduct executions in December 2020 or January 2021. \n63.  There is no urgency to conducting the executions that are currently scheduled.   \n64.  Executions are not necessary for the effective operation of the federal criminal \njustice system, as demonstrated by the fact that only three federal executions took place in the \nUnited States between 1957 and 2020.36  There were no federal executions in the 1960s, 1970s, \n1980s, 1990s, or 2010s.37  There were two federal executions in 2001, and one in 2003.38    \n65.  In July 2019โprior to the onset of the COVID-19 global pandemicโAttorney \nGeneral Barr directed BOP to adopt a proposed Addendum to the Federal Execution Protocol, \nthereby โclearing the way for the federal government to resume capital punishment after a nearly \ntwo decade lapse....โ39 \n66.  Since then, following various stays of execution, the federal government has carried \nout eight executions at USP Terre Hauteโthree occurred the week of July 12, 2020, two the week \nof August 26, 2020, two the week of September 20, 2020, and one occurred on November 19, \n2020.40     \n                                                 \n35 See Letter from ABA President Patricia Lee Refo to President Donald J.

More federal executions took place over a three-week period in 2020 than occurred \nin the prior 66 years.    \n68.  Lisa Montgomery was scheduled to be executed on December 8, for crimes she \ncommitted  in  2004.    This  would  make  her  the  first  woman  to  be  executed  by  the  federal \ngovernment since Ethel Rosenberg was executed in 1953.  On November 19, 2020, however, the \nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia enjoined Attorney General Barr and his co-\ndefendants from executing Lisa Montgomery โbefore December 31, 2020,โ because her attorneys \ncontracted severe cases of COVID when visiting her in the Texas federal prison where she is \ncurrently being held and are unable to assist her in presenting โa meaningful petition for a reprieve \nor commutation of sentence to the President.โ  See Memorandum Opinion at 9 (Dkt. No. 19) and \nOrder at 1 (Dkt. No. 20), Montgomery v. Barr, Civil Action No. 20-3261 (RDM) (D.D.C. Nov. \n19, 2020).  The Defendants have moved her execution date to January 12, 2021.  Brandon Bernard \nis scheduled to be executed on December 10, for crimes he committed in 1999.  He was 18 years \nold when the crimes were committed, which is the minimum age at which the death penalty may \nbe imposed.41  \n69.  Additional executions have recently been scheduled by Defendants to take place at \nFCC Terre Haute, on December 11, 2020, January 14, 2021, and January 15, 2021.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n70.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, the individual named Plaintiffs bring this action on \nbehalf of themselves and on behalf of all persons similarly situated. \n71.  Plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of all people who are currently or who \nwill in the future be incarcerated at FCC Terre Haute during the COVID-19 pandemic (the \nโClassโ). \n72.  The  members  of  the  Class  are  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is \nimpracticable.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  There are approximately 2,300 incarcerated people \n                                                 \n41  See Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005) (holding that the 8th and 14th Amendments of the U.S. \nConstitution forbid the execution of offenders who were younger than 18 when the crime occurred). \n  - 16 - \n  \n150291934.1\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JRS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 11/25/20   Page 17 of 20 PageID #: 17\n \nat FCC Terre Haute, a significant percentage of whom are at an increased risk of harm from \nCOVID-19 due to age or previous or existing medical conditions. \n73.  There are questions of law and fact common to the Class, including: (1) whether \nCOVID-19 present a substantial risk of harm to individuals incarcerated at Terre Haute FCC;  (2) \nwhether holding executions at FCC Terre Haute during the current pandemic violates class \nmembersโ constitutional right to be free from unreasonable risk of death and bodily harm; and (3) \nwhether all further executions at FCC Terre Haute should be enjoined until such time as the \nCOVID-19 virus no longer constitutes an ongoing pandemic that jeopardizes the public health.  \nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). \n74.  The claims of the class representatives are typical of the claims of the Class.  See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  The individual named Plaintiffs are currently incarcerated at FCC Terre \nHaute and will be exposed to the risks attendant to the upcoming scheduled executions.   \n75.  The individual named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe Class.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  The interests of the class representatives are consistent \nwith those of the Class members.  Counsel for Plaintiffs are not aware of any conflicts with the \nunnamed members of the proposed Class.  Plaintiffs are represented by counsel. \n76.  A class action is appropriate because Defendants have acted and refuse to act on \ngrounds  that  apply  generally  to  the  Class,  so  that  final  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief  is \nappropriate with respect to the class as a whole.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nEXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES \n77.  Plaintiffs are not required to exhaust administrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1997e because there is no available administrative remedy.  The BOP Administrative Remedy \nProgram cannot provide any relief relative to the upcoming scheduled executions and, even if \nadministrative remedies were available, they would offer no possible relief in time to prevent the \nimminent danger from the upcoming scheduled executions.  \n   \n  - 17 - \n  \n150291934.1\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JRS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 11/25/20   Page 18 of 20 PageID #: 18\n \nCOUNT I \nViolation of the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n78.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth here. \n79.  Plaintiffs bring this claim on their own behalf and on behalf of the Class against all \nDefendants. \n80.  Plaintiffs and members of the Class have a right to be free from cruel and unusual \npunishment  under  the  Eighth  Amendment  to  the  U.S.  Constitution.    These  constitutional \nprotections extend to โconditions of confinement that are not formally imposed as a sentence for a \ncrime,โ Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 29-30 (1993), and that are โsure or very likely to cause \nserious illness and needless sufferingโฆ,โ id. at 33. \n81.  Defendantsโ actions in conducting executions at FCC Terre Haute in the middle of \nthe pandemic expose the Plaintiffs and members of the class to a substantial risk of contracting \nCOVID-19, a serious and highly contagious disease that can lead to severe illness or death.  \nDefendants have failed to take reasonable measures to provide for safe living conditions for the \nnamed Plaintiffs and members of the Class, and they have unnecessarily and unreasonably \nimposed on all Plaintiffs an increased risk of contracting a disease that is very likely to cause \nserious illness and needless suffering.  \n82.  As set forth above, hundreds of people are likely to descend on FCC Terre Haute \nfor each of the scheduled executions, many after travelling from different parts of the country and \ninteracting in hotels and restaurants with individuals who might be contagious carriers of the \nCOVID-19 virus.  The individuals who come to Terre Haute will interact with members of the \nlocal community and with FCC Terre Haute staff members, who will later interact with the \nindividual Plaintiffs and members of the Class.  COVID-19 is a serious and highly contagious \ndisease that can lead to severe illness or death.  Defendants are therefore setting up a potentially \nlethal chain reaction at FCC Terre Haute. \n83.  Defendants are well aware of the substantial risk of harm that COVID-19 poses to \nall individuals and the particular risks that Plaintiffs and members of the Class face.  The risks of \n  - 18 - \n  \n150291934.1\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JRS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 11/25/20   Page 19 of 20 PageID #: 19\n \nCOVID-19 are well publicized and widely known, including the heightened risks for incarcerated \npersons.  And Defendants have openly acknowledged the risks of COVID-19, including the \nsignificant risks attendant to bringing individuals into and out of the prison in the midst of the \npandemic.   \n84.  Defendants are also well aware of the CDCโs recommendation that the movement \nof people into and out of a prison be restricted if there are positive COVID-19 cases in or out of \nthe prison, so as to reduce the spread of the disease.  \n85.  Despite this knowledge, Defendants have failed to take reasonable and known \nmeasures to mitigate the dangers of COVID-19 by choosing to move forward with additional \nexecutions at FCC Terre Haute in December 2020 and January 2021.  Defendantsโ actions in \nmoving  forward  with  execution  plans  in  the  face  of  the  known  risks  constitute  deliberate \nindifference to the health and safety of the individual Plaintiffs and members of the Class. \n86.  As a result of Defendantsโ actions and inactions, the individual Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the Class face irreparable harm, both from the violation of their constitutions rights \nand the substantial risk of contracting COVID-19 and sustaining a serious illness that could lead \nto death. \n87.  The individual Plaintiffs and members of the Class are being threatened with \nunsafe, life-threatening conditions in their prison and are entitled to injunctive relief to prevent the \nviolation of their constitutional rights. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \nA.  Declare that conducting executions at FCC Terre Haute as planned by Defendants \nduring the pendency of the COVID-19 pandemic violates the Eighth Amendment right against \ncruel and unusual punishment with respect to the named Plaintiffs and the Class; \nB.  Enter a preliminary and a permanent injunction ordering Defendants not to \nconduct further executions at FCC Terre Haute until such time as the COVID-19 virus no longer \n  - 19 - \n  \n150291934.1\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JRS-MJD   Document 1   Filed 11/25/20   Page 20 of 20 PageID #: 20\n \nconstitutes an ongoing pandemic that jeopardizes the public health and Plaintiffs and members of \nthe Class have received an appropriate vaccine; and \nC.

BARR, et al.  )\n  )\nDefendants. )\n \nOrder Granting in Part and Denying in Part  \nPlaintiffs' Second Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nThe plaintiffs hereโtwo inmates at FCI Terre Hauteโhave made a strong showing that \nthey face an unconstitutional health risk if the defendants carry out scheduled executions without \nsignificant modifications to their COVID-19 prevention measures. For this reason and those \ndiscussed below, their second motion for preliminary injunction is granted.  \nI.  Background, Procedural History, and Second Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nAll federal executions take place at the Federal Correctional Complex (\"FCC Terre Haute\") \nin Terre Haute, Indiana. FCC Terre Haute contains multiple facilities, including, as relevant here, \nthe  United  States  Penitentiary  (\"USP\"),  where  death  row  inmates  are  housed,  the  Federal \nCorrectional Institute (\"FCI\"), and the execution facility. The plaintiffsโtwo inmates at the FCI \nwho purport to represent a class of all incarcerated persons at FCC Terre Hauteโallege that the \ndefendants' decision to carry out executions at FCC Terre Haute during a deadly pandemic violates \ntheir rights under the Eighth Amendment. Dkt. 1, ยถ 8.  \nThe plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for preliminary injunction on November 30, \n2020, dkt. 12, which the Court denied on December 8, 2020, dkt. 37. The Court concluded that \nalthough \"conducting executions at this time may well result in more COVID-19 cases for those \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 55   Filed 01/07/21   Page 2 of 22 PageID #: 1119\ninvolved in the executions, the plaintiffs have not shown that increased risk extends to them, and \nthus have not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their motion.\" Id. at 1โ2. The Court \nfound that the defendants and prison staff could do more to prevent COVID-19 transmission at \nFCC Terre Haute generally and that conducting executions during the pandemic is risky, but that \nthe plaintiffs failed to produce evidentiary support in the form of scientific or statistical data to \ndemonstrate that conducting executions during the pandemic creates substantial additional risks to \nthe inmates' health. Id. at 13โ14. After denying the motion, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion \nfor expedited discovery. Dkts. 45, 46. \nBrandon Bernard was executed on December 10, and Alfred Bourgeois was executed on \nDecember 11.1 Three executions are scheduled for next week: Lisa Montgomery on January 12, \nCory Johnson on January 14, and Dustin Higgs on January 15.2 \nOn December 28, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a second motion for preliminary injunction and \nevidence in support of their motion. Dkt. 47. The evidence includes information about an outbreak \nof  COVID-19  infections  at  FCC  Terre  Haute,  information  produced  in  discovery  by  the \ndefendants, and a declaration from an expert in modeling risk for infectious diseases, Dr. Nina \nFefferman. Dkts. 47-2โ10. The defendants filed a response in opposition with updated declarations \nfrom FCC Terre Haute warden T.J. Watson and BOP Regional Counsel Rick Winter. Dkts. 51, \n51-1, 51-2. The plaintiffs filed a reply, dkt. 54, and the motion is now ripe for ruling.  \nAs discussed at length in the Court's December 8, 2020 Order, the novel coronavirus, or \nCOVID-19, is killing hundreds of Americans each day, and prisoners are particularly vulnerable. \n \n1 Federal Bureau of Prisons,  Historical Information: Capital Punishment, \nhttps://www.bop.gov/about/history/federal_executions.jsp (last visited Jan. 7, 2021). \n2 Federal Bureau of Prisons, Scheduled Executions, \nhttps://www.bop.gov/resources/federal_executions_info.jsp (last visited Jan. 7, 2021). \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 55   Filed 01/07/21   Page 3 of 22 PageID #: 1120\nDecember 2020 was the deadliest and most infectious month in the United States since the start of \nthe pandemic, with over 77,000 deaths and 6.4 million new cases.3   \nWhen the Court issued its December 8, 2020, Order, 264 FCC Terre Haute inmates and \n21 staff members were COVID-19 positive, 3 inmates had died, and 301 inmates and 38 staff \nmembers had recovered. Dkt. 37 at 5. As of January 7, 2021, 108 FCC Terre Haute inmates and \n24 staff members are positive, and 1117 inmates and 105 staff members have recovered.4 Put \ndifferently, between those two dates, 657 inmates and 70 staff members tested positive for the \nvirus. On December 7, 2020, an FCI inmate died in an area hospital after testing positive for \nCOVID-19 at the prison on November 17, 2020.5 Both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Higgs tested positive \nin December, as did other inmates on death row.6 \nEach execution brings approximately 50 to 125 individuals to FCC Terre Haute.

Dkt. 28-1 at ยถ 23. \nEleven BOP employees are known to have tested positive contemporaneously with participating \nin  executions:  the  FCC  Terre  Haute  staff  member  disclosed  in  the  Hartkemeyer  case,  the \npreviously disclosed eight execution team members who participated in Orlando Hall's execution \nin November, dkt. 33-2 at ยถ 8, an additional execution team member who participated in the July \nexecutions, and an additional FCC Terre Haute employee who worked in the USP and FCI who \nassisted with executions in late September, dkt. 47-9. After the December executions, only three \nmembers of the execution team elected to be tested; all tested negative. Dkt. 51-2 at ยถ 5. None of \nthe  execution  team  members  have  reported  a  positive  COVID-19  test  since  the  December \nexecutions, but again only three chose to be tested. Id.  \nBecause the contacts between those involved in the executions and FCC Terre Haute \ninmates are limited, the Plaintiffs enlisted Dr. Fefferman, a professor in both the Department of \nEcology and Evolutionary Biology and the Department of Mathematics at the Professor at the \nUniversity of Tennessee, Knoxville, to explain how conducting executions at this time could \nincrease inmates' risk of contracting COVID-19. Dkt. 47-2 at ยถ1. Dr. Fefferman is a researcher of \nthe epidemiology, ecology, and evolution of infectious disease, pandemic preparedness, national \nbiosecurity, and infrastructure protection. Id. at ยถ 2. She has been studying COVID-19 extensively \nsince February 2020, with specific attention to modeling the risks of spread from and within \ncarceral facilities. Id. at ยถ 4. Dr. Fefferman reviewed materials provided by the plaintiffs' counsel, \nincluding the execution plans and layout of FCC Terre Haute, Mr. Winter and Warden Watson's \nprior declarations, and discovery related to contact tracing and COVID-19 testing related to the \nexecutions. Id. at ยถ 7.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 55   Filed 01/07/21   Page 6 of 22 PageID #: 1123\nBased on her review of the materials, Dr. Fefferman opined that conducting the January \nexecutions poses a substantial risk of COVID-19 spread and illness to FCC Terre Haute prisoners. \nId. at ยถ 8. The risk is due to the introduction of hundreds of individuals to the prison environment \nand the involvement of FCC Terre Haute staff members who are displaced from their normal \nduties, interact with the individuals involved in the executions, and then return to their duties. Id. \nThe risk is higher when community spread is high, as it is now. Id. at ยถ 10. When community \nspread is high, it is \"essential\" to limit the number of contacts among individuals when other factors \nin the prison setting cannot necessarily be controlled, such as social distancing, improving \nventilation systems, consistent use of masks, etc. Id. Dr. Fefferman acknowledged that she could \nnot quantify the extent of the risk with the information available, but in her opinion the risk is \nsubstantial. Id. at ยถ 12. Dr. Fefferman explained a variety of factors that account for the increased \nrisk: \n๏ท  Participants' Travel to FCC Terre Haute: The 50 to 125 individuals traveling \nto the prison may be unknowingly infected or may contract the virus on account of \ntheir interstate travel because of increased risk of exposure from traveling by \nairplane, staying in hotels, taking taxis, and eating at restaurants. The potential for \none infected person to infect a group of people is the basis for health directives \nissued by state and local public health officials discouraging holiday travel and \ngatherings, as well as the CDC's recommendations that prisons avoid all non-\nessential visitors when there is a COVID-19 outbreak inside the prison or in the \ncommunity. Id. at ยถ 17; \n๏ท  FCC  Terre  Haute  Staff  Involvement:  Staff  involvement  in  the  executions \nincreases the risk of exposing inmates to the virus due to the high number of staff \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 55   Filed 01/07/21   Page 7 of 22 PageID #: 1124\ninvolved and their interaction with \"potential new sources of infection,\" i.e. the \nindividuals who would not be at the prison but for the executions. Because of the \nlag time between when one becomes infected and symptoms appear, the staff \nmember may be infected by an individual involved in the execution and then \nseveral days later, having resumed his normal duties, may expose an inmate to the \nvirus. Id. at ยถยถ 18โ24; \n๏ท  Impact on COVID-19 Preventative Measures: The precautions FCC Terre \nHaute normally takes to reduce the spread of COVIDโquarantining new inmates, \nsuspending visitation at FCI Terre Haute, assigning staff to the same posts to \nminimize their movement within the facilityโare undermined by the executions \nbecause of the reassignment of many staff members to execution-related functions. \nPulling staff from their regular duties and having other staff reassigned to the \nmissing positions \"increases the circles of exposure.\" Further, reduced staffing also \ncauses a slower response time to individuals who are sick and potentially increases \nthe exposure time of the virus to other inmates. Id. at ยถยถ 25โ30; \n๏ท  Contact Tracing: While contact tracing is an essential tool to slow the spread of \nthe virus, disrupting staff's regular routines and assignments makes contact tracing \nmore difficult by increasing the likelihood that the infected staff member will be \nunable to identify all of his contacts. Such was the case with the staff member who \nbecame infected before the July executions and was unable to remember his \ninteractions. Id. at ยถ 33. The defendants did not do any contact tracing after learning \na spiritual advisor tested positive after a November execution, despite his contacts \nwith FCC Terre Haute staff. Id. at ยถ 38. Further, the defendants did not conduct \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 55   Filed 01/07/21   Page 8 of 22 PageID #: 1125\ncontact tracing for the members of the executions team members who tested \npositive, despite Warden Watson's prior sworn assertion that contact tracing would \nbe conducted for any BOP employee who tested positive following an execution. \nDkt. 28-1 at ยถ 24. The defendants stated that the lack of contact tracing of the \nexecution team was to protect the confidentiality of its members, and because \n\"some execution teams members who tested positive did not return to work at their \nhome institution until meeting CDC guidelines; therefore negating the need for \ncontact tracing at all.\" Dkt. 47-2 at ยถ 37 (quoting discovery response, dkt. 47-9 at \n6). Because the purpose of contact tracing would be to identify potential contacts \nwith FCC Terre Haute staff, the explanation that contact tracing was unnecessary \nbecause the execution team members isolated at home \"suggests a basic and \ndisturbing misunderstanding of the principles and purposes of contact tracing.\" Id.  \nDr. Fefferman opined that the introduction of individuals to the facility for the executions \nand their interaction with FCC Terre Haute staff \"is a likely explanation for waves of infection that \nhave occurred in connection with prior executions.\" Id. at ยถ 35. That spikes in infections did not \noccur after every execution \"does not negate the significance of instances in which spikes did \noccur, given the various factors that influence the spread of COVID,\" such as the rate of \ncommunity spread. Id.  \nDr.  Fefferman  identified  safety  measures  that  would  reduce  the  risk  of  spreading \nCOVID-19 to FCC Terre Haute inmates. First, the BOP could not conduct executions until the \npandemic has ended. Second, the BOP could delay the executions until all staff and inmates have \nbeen vaccinated. Third, the BOP could institute heightened safety measures.  The measures \nDr. Fefferman states would be necessary include: \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 55   Filed 01/07/21   Page 9 of 22 PageID #: 1126\n๏ท  Members of the execution team should quarantine for 14 days upon arrival to \nIndiana and test negative before participating in execution-related duties; \n๏ท  Execution team members and FCC Terre Haute staff involved in the executions \nshould undergo rapid testing each morning they enter the prison grounds; \n๏ท  The BOP should restrict interaction between the execution team and FCC Terre \nHaute staff, impose strict social distancing requirements, strictly enforce mask \nmandates,10  and  implement  policies  prohibiting  execution  members  and  staff \nmembers from engaging in risky social behaviors such as drinking alcohol during \nthe quarantine period. \n๏ท  FCC Terre Haute staff members involved in execution-related activities should \nquarantine for 14 days and test negative for COVID-19 before returning to their \nnormal assignments; \n๏ท  If BOP or FCC Terre Haute identifies an infected team member, comprehensive \ncontact tracing must take place.  \nIn  response  to  Dr.  Fefferman's  proposed  safety  measures,  the  defendants  state  that \nquarantining the execution team prior to the executions or FCC Terre Haute staff after the \nexecutions is not feasible. To require the execution team to quarantine upon arrival \"would hamper \nstaffing, productivity, and security at the home institutions of the team members, in addition to \nbeing financially very costly to the BOP (for example, requiring payment for lodging and meals \nand paying other staff overtime to cover quarantined staff duties at their home institutions.\"). \n \n10 In support of their second motion, the plaintiffs included the declaration of Charles Formosa, a \nmitigation  investigator  who  was  a  member  of  Mr.  Bernard's  legal  team  and  witnessed  his \nexecution. Dkt. 47-6. Mr. Formosa witnessed several instances where BOP staff did not wear \nmasks, including a staff member in the execution chambers.

According to Warden Watson, requiring FCC Terre Haute staff to quarantine for \n14 days after the execution would hinder the ability to staff all necessary positions, potentially \njeopardizing the safety and orderly operation of the institution. Dkt. 51-1 at ยถ 13. For example, \nmany of the staff conducting temperature checks and symptom screening for individuals entering \nthe grounds are medical staff at the institution; thus, any quarantine \"would undermine the ability \nof the medical department to meet the health and safety needs of the inmate population.\" Id. The \ndefendants also stated that contact tracing of execution team members is not always possible due \nto the \"paramount need for confidentiality\" of the identities of execution team members because \n\"[c]ontact tracing would either provide the identities of team members, or information that would \nlead to the identities of team members, to individuals who would otherwise not have access to this \ninformation, and who could threaten the safety of the team member.\" Dkt. 51-2 at ยถยถ 11โ14. \nII.  Factual Findings \nA.  Dr. Fefferman and Her Conclusions Are Credible. \nThe  defendants  do  not  put  forth  any  expert  testimony,  but  they  do  challenge \nDr. Fefferman's conclusions and her status as an expert. See dkt. 51 at 15โ17.  \nDr. Fefferman's qualifications are unquestionable. She earned a PhD in mathematical \nbiology from Tufts University in 2005. Dkt. 47-3 at 2. She is a professor at the University of \nTennessee in both the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and the Department of \nMathematics. And she has advised state and federal agencies on \"how to manage and mitigate \npandemic threats from H1N1 2009 flu, Ebola in West Africa, and Zika virus.\" Dkt. 47-2, ยถ 3. \nDr. Fefferman appropriately relied on her review on the scientific evidence of how COVID-19 \nspreads, as well as declarations from BOP officials, data regarding FCC Terre Haute COVID-19 \ninfections, and contact tracing information provided by the defendants. Id., ยถยถ 7, 12. \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 55   Filed 01/07/21   Page 11 of 22 PageID #: 1128\nB.  The Defendants Have Deliberately Chosen Not to Implement CDC Guidance \nRegarding Contact Tracing and Testing. \nThe CDC gives detailed guidance on when and how to implement contact tracing for \nindividuals who test positive for COVID-19.11 On December 4, 2020, defendant Warden Watson \ndescribed the BOP's contact tracing procedures for a staff member who tested positive shortly \nbefore the July 2020 executions. Dkt. 28-1, ยถ 24. According to Warden Watson, \"[t]he staff \nmember's contacts were determined by the use of video as well as his personal recollection.\" Id. \nWarden Watson then declared under penalty of perjury that the \"BOP will continue to conduct the \nsame contact tracing procedures if additional staff members test positive in the future.\" Id. This \ndeclaration has proven to be wholly false.  \nThe most recent execution for which the defendants have provided testing data was \nNovember 19. Within a week of that execution, six members of the execution team tested positive \nfor COVID-19. The BOP conducted contact tracing for, at most, one of them. See dkt. 47-8 \nat 4โ5, 20; Now the defendants, without acknowledging their prior misrepresentation, assert that \ncontact tracing \"is not always possible for members of the execution team, given the paramount \nneed for their confidentiality due to the sensitivity of their occupation and their unique mission.\" \nDkt. 51 at 7. The Court emphatically rejects this assertion. Nothing prevents execution team \nmembers from logging their close contacts during their time at FCC Terre Haute and reporting \nthem to proper personnel if they later test positive for COVID-19. And nothing requires that the \nidentity of the COVID-19 positive employee be shared with an individual who is advised through \nproper tracing that s/he has had close personal contact with such COVID-19 positive individual. It \nis the fact of the contact, not the identity of the COVID-19 positive person that is significant.  \n \n11 \"Contact Tracing,\" CDC Interim Guidance, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 55   Filed 01/07/21   Page 12 of 22 PageID #: 1129\nBut even in situations where contract tracing is not feasibleโthough it is hereโthe CDC \nguidelines offer an alternative: broad-based testing. Instead, the defendants have made testing \nvoluntary for execution team members. After the most recent round of executions, only three of \nthe more than forty execution team members chose to be tested. Dkt. 51 at 10. Lack of resources \ncannot explain the failure to implement broad-based testing, as \"FCC Terre Haute has multiple \nrapid Abbot[t] test machines, and uses them to immediately test symptomatic inmates in order to \nisolate and quarantine them more quickly.\" Dkt. 28-1, ยถ 12 (Watson 12/4/20 Declaration).  \nAs Dr. Fefferman concludes, because of the BOP's failure to perform contact tracing and \ntesting for execution team members, their \"attempts, if any, to identify FCC Terre Haute staff who \nmay have been infected [will be] hamstrung and incomplete.\" Dkt. 47-2, ยถ 37.  \nC.  Performing Further Executions as Planned, Without Additional Precautions, \nSubstantially Increases the Risk of the Plaintiffs Contracting COVID-19. \nThe Court credits Dr. Fefferman's conclusion that \"inmates from all three facilities within \nFCC Terre Haute would face a substantially increased risk of contracting COVID-19, and suffering \nserious health problems as a result, if executions continue at FCC Terre Haute at the current time \nand in the manner in which executions have been held earlier this year at the prison.\" Dkt. 47-2, \nยถ 12.  \nThe defendants note that COVID-19 infections have not spiked following every round of \nexecutions. Dr. Fefferman convincingly explains that the lack of consistent post-execution spikes \nis due to the nature of COVID-19 spread. See id., ยถ 35 (describing the probabilistic nature of \npredicting COVID-19 spread and analogizing to weather prediction). Even in large groups, \ntransmission does not always occur; but when it does, it can spread widely and quickly. See id., \nยถยถ 13โ14.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 55   Filed 01/07/21   Page 13 of 22 PageID #: 1130\nIndeed, the spread of COVID-19 at USP Terre Haute following Orlando Hall's execution \non November 19, 2020โafter which several members of the execution team tested positive for \nCOVID-19โexemplifies this type of spread. The following table summarizes confirmed active \nCOVID-19 cases among inmates at USP Terre Haute in the weeks following the November 19 \nexecution:12 \nUSP Active \nDate \nCases \n11/23/2020  4 \n11/30/2020  6 \n12/ 7/2020  84 \n12/14/2020  170 \n12/21/2020  252 \n12/28/2020  410 \n1/3/2021  344 \n \nLess than two weeks after the November 19 execution, confirmed active cases at the USP \nbegan rising. Within a month, the USP had added 400 new active casesโthe most active cases \namong any BOP facility at the time. The defendants emphasize that the number of active cases \n\"stay[ed] steady for the ten days\" after the November execution. Dkt. 51 at 17. But this 10-day lag \nsupports Dr. Fefferman's conclusions about execution-related spread: execution team members \nand visitors pass the virus to FCC staff, who in turn pass it to FCC inmates. Dkt. 47-2, ยถ 8. \nAs noted in the Court's order denying the plaintiffs' first motion for preliminary injunction, \n\"the  evidence  showsโand  common  sense  dictatesโthat  carrying  out  executions  on  prison \nproperty with prison staff involved creates some additional risk of COVID-19 infection for \n \n12 Data from \"Facility Case Trends\" page at \"Dashboards of BOP COVID-19 Cases,\" available at \noig.justice.gov/coronavirus (last accessed January 6, 2021). \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 55   Filed 01/07/21   Page 14 of 22 PageID #: 1131\nprisoners, including the plaintiffs.\" Dkt. 37 at 14. Dr. Fefferman could not quantify the increased \nrisk, no doubt in part due to the defendants' failure to implement widespread testing or contact \ntracing for execution team members. Dkt. 47-2, ยถ 11 (noting that the \"relevant data and contact \ntracing information are extremely limited\"). But the Court credits her conclusion, based upon the \navailable scientific evidence, the data from FCC Terre Haute, and the lack of precautions taken \nduring and following executions, that carrying out further executions without additional safeguards \nwill \"substantially increase[]\" the plaintiffs' risk.  \nIII.  Standing \n  The plaintiffs have demonstrated standing to bring this action. The defendants argue that \nthe plaintiffs' alleged injury is speculative. Dkt. 51 at 2. But the Court finds that the plaintiffs have \ndemonstrated injury in the form of a substantially increased risk of contracting COVID-19 due to \nthe defendants' actions and inadequate preventative measures. This threat of future harm is \nsufficient injury for standing purposes. Booker-El v. Superintendent, Indiana State Prison, 668 \nF.3d 896, 899 (7th Cir. 2012). \nIV.  Discussion \n\"To obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must show that: (1) without this relief, \nit will suffer irreparable harm; (2) traditional legal remedies would be inadequate; and (3) it has \nsome likelihood of prevailing on the merits of its claims.\" Mays v. Dart, 974 F.3d 810, 818 \n(7th Cir. 2020) (citation and quotation marks omitted). The burden to show \"likely\" success is \nlightest when the prospect of irreparable injury is greatest, and vice versa. Id. at 822. If the plaintiff \nmeets these three factors, the court must balance \"the harm the denial of the preliminary injunction \nwould cause the plaintiff against the harm to the defendant if the court were to grant it.\" Id. at 818. \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 55   Filed 01/07/21   Page 15 of 22 PageID #: 1132\nA.  Likelihood of Success \nThe  Eighth  Amendment  prohibits  cruel  and  unusual  punishment.  Corollary  to  this \nprohibition is a duty upon prison officials, who must \"ensure that inmates receive adequate \nfood, clothing, shelter, and medical care, and must 'take reasonable measures to guarantee the \nsafety of the inmates.'\" Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994) (quoting Hudson v. Palmer, \n468 U.S. 517,  526โ27  (1984)).  The  Eighth  Amendment's  deliberate  indifference  framework \nincludes an objective prong and subjective prong. Id. at 834. To prove the objective prong, the \nplaintiffs  must  show  that  conducting  executions  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  creates  a \n\"substantial risk of serious harm\" to their health. Id. For the subjective prong, the plaintiffs must \nshow that the defendants knew of and disregarded the excessive risk of harm to the plaintiffs' \nhealth. Id. at 837; see also Goodloe v. Sood, 947 F.3d 1026, 1030โ31 (7th Cir. 2020) (citing \nFarmer standard). The level of disregard required is roughly equivalent to criminal recklessness. \nDavis v. Kayira, 938 F.3d 910, 915 (7th Cir. 2019).  \nThe plaintiffs' first motion for preliminary injunction failed on the objective prong because \nthey failed to provide evidentiary support of a correlation between conducting the executions and \nexposing inmates at FCC Terre Haute to COVID-19. The defendants maintain that none of the \nnew evidence proffered by the plaintiffs casts doubt on the Court's prior conclusion.  \nThe Court disagrees. Dr. Fefferman provides compelling evidence that the manner in which \nthe defendants have conducted the last ten executions has created a substantial risk that the \nplaintiffs  will  contract  COVID-19  and  suffer  serious  health  consequences.  The  executions \nintroduce a large number of outsiders to the prison complex. These individuals interact with FCC \nTerre Haute staff who have been displaced from their regular duties to assist with the execution. \nThe CDC recommends assigning staff to the same posts to reduce the spread of the virus. \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 55   Filed 01/07/21   Page 16 of 22 PageID #: 1133\nDkt. 13-12 at 2; dkt. 47-2 at ยถ 25. By shuffling staff assignments and exposing FCC Terre Haute \nstaff to outsiders, the defendants increase the number of contacts all prison staff have with the \ninmates. Dkt. 47-2 at ยถ 30. This is especially risky when community rates are high. Staff \ndisplacement also complicates contact tracing once a staff member has tested positive for COVID-\n19. Id. at ยถ 31. As discussed in the factual findings, the Court credits Dr. Fefferman's conclusion \nthat that \"inmates from all three facilities within FCC Terre Haute would face a substantially \nincreased risk of contracting COVID-19, and suffering serious health problems as a result, if \nexecutions continue at FCC Terre Haute at the current time and in the manner in which executions \nhave been held earlier this year at the prison.\" Dkt. 47-2, ยถ 12 (emphasis added).13 \nMoving to the subjective prong, there is compelling circumstantial evidence that the \ndefendants are knowingly disregarding a risk to inmates' health if they proceed with the January \nexecutions in the same manner as the earlier executions. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842 (noting \nfactfinder may rely on \"inference from circumstantial evidence\" to find requisite knowledge of a \nsubstantial risk.). The defendants cite to cases in which prison administrators were not found to be \ndeliberately indifferent due to the efforts they undertook to reduce the spread of COVID-19 during \nregular prison operations. Dkt. 51 at 18, n.5, citing, e.g. Wilson v. Williams, 961 F.3d 829, 840โ41 \n \n13 The plaintiffs argue that the Court may consider members of the putative classโall inmates at \nFCC Terre Hauteโwhen evaluating the likelihood of success and the risk of irreparable harm, but \nthey have not yet moved to certify the class. The Court need not address whether it may consider \nthe putative class absent a motion for class certification, because the Court finds that the named \nplaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence of a risk of future harm to them. See Delaney v. \nDeTella,  256  F.3d  679,  686  (7th  Cir.  2019)  (\"Deliberate  indifference  is  akin  to  criminal \nrecklessness; thus, it is enough that defendants are aware that their action may cause injury without \nbeing able to divine the most likely victim.\"); Byrd v. Hobart, 761 Fed. App'x 621 (7th Cir. 2019) \n(holding that a reasonable jury could find that unsanitary kitchen conditions at prison created a \nrisk of future harm that violated the Eighth Amendment, even though the plaintiff had eaten there \nfor years without becoming ill). \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 55   Filed 01/07/21   Page 17 of 22 PageID #: 1134\n(6th Cir 2020) (finding BOP responded reasonably to risks by screening inmates, limiting group \ngatherings, staff, and visitors, providing inmates masks and soap, etc.); Valentine v. Collier, 956 \nF.3d 797, 802 (5th Cir. 2020) (finding plaintiffs were unlikely to establish deliberate indifference \nwhen prison officials were taking measures \"informed by guidance from the CDC and medical \nprofessionals\"). But conducting executions at this time is not part of regular prison operations. As \nthe defendants have insisted throughout this and other litigation, the BOP has discretion to set the \nplace and date for executions. The defendants have exercised that discretion by choosing to carry \nout executions during the height (so far) of the COVID-19 pandemic that has killed more than \n350,000  Americans.  The  defendants  therefore  must  ensure  that  the  consequences  of  these \nexecutions reflect due regard for the safety of non-condemned prisoners in their custody.  \nWhen the BOP \"is aware of the need to undertake a specific task and fails to do so, the case \nfor deliberate indifference is particularly strong.\" Goodloe, 947 F.3d at 1031. The defendants know \nwhat safety measures are necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19 within the prison, and \nclaimed they would follow many of them, but their conduct instead demonstrates willful disregard \nof  the  risks  posed  when  the  measures  aren't  implemented.  The  defendants  claim  to  have \nimplemented mask-wearing but have failed to enforce compliance. The defendants have touted the \navailability of testing but have chosen not to utilize rapid testing of staff and visitors who enter \nprison grounds. It is telling that Warden Watson acknowledged that one of the reasons visitors are \nnot tested is because \"[s]ome visitors are legal or spiritual advisors, as well as members of the \nmedia and witnesses whose presence is authorized by 28 C.F.R. ยง 26.4.\" Dkt. 51-1 at ยถ 15. His \nstatement reveals a concern that denying entrance to one of these visitors could create a legal \nimpediment to the execution, so the defendants prefer not to know if they are COVID-19 positive. \nTesting is not required for any staff. The defendants' observation that none of the December \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 55   Filed 01/07/21   Page 18 of 22 PageID #: 1135\nexecution team members received positive test results is not reassuring when less than 10% of the \nexecution  team  chose  to  be  tested.  The  defendants  ignore  the  fact  that  individuals  \"with \nasymptomatic and presymptomatic infection are significant contributors\" to the transmission and \nspread of COVID-19.14 Most disconcerting, the defendants represented to the Court that contact \ntracing would occur after any BOP staff member involved in the executions tested positive. This \nhas not been the caseโ and the Court finds the failure was not by accident but by design. \nB.  Irreparable Harm, Inadequate Legal Remedy, and Balancing the Parties' \nInterests \nIn its order denying the plaintiffs' first motion for preliminary injunction, the Court found \nthat \"the plaintiffs have not shown that they are likely to be infected with COVID-19 because of \nthe scheduled executions, and thus have not demonstrated an irreparable injury.\" Dkt. 37 at 15. \nThat has now changed. As discussed in Sections II.C, III, and IV.A, the Court now finds that \nplaintiffs have presented credible, compelling evidence that they face a substantially increased risk \nof contracting COVID-19 absent an injunction. Traditional legal remedies are inadequate to \nremedy that injury.  \nThe  defendants  have  a  substantial  legal  interest  in  timely  enforcement  of  criminal \ndefendants' sentences. Bucklew v. Precythe, 139 S. Ct. 1112, 1133 (2019) (\"Both the [government] \nand the victims of crime have an important interest in the timely enforcement of a sentence.\"). \nBut the plaintiffs do not seek relief that would necessarily prevent the government from timely \ncarrying out executions. Indeed, by taking additional precautions discussed below in Section V, \nthe defendants may carry out executions in January as scheduled without violating the plaintiffs' \nEighth Amendment rights. These additional precautions would not be costless, but any costs to the \n \n14 CDC, Guidance for Expanded Screening Testing to Reduce Silent Spread of SARS-CoV-2, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/open-america/expanded-screening-testing.html \n(last updated Dec. 3, 2020). \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 55   Filed 01/07/21   Page 19 of 22 PageID #: 1136\ndefendants do not outweigh the risk to the plaintiffs of contracting COVID-19 if executions go \nforward as scheduled without additional precautions.  \nTaken together, the parties' competing interests weigh in favor of a preliminary injunction \nprohibiting  the  defendants  from  carrying  out  the  January  executions  as  scheduled  without \nadditional precautions. The constitutional right of plaintiffs and/or the putative class members to \nbe free from unreasonable risk of exposure to COVID-19 is a significant public interest. See Awad \nv. Ziriax, 670 F.3d 1111, 1132 (10th Cir. 2012) (\"[I]t is always in the public interest to prevent the \nviolation of a party's constitutional rights.\" (quotation marks and citation omitted)). Former \nAttorney General Barr has suggested as much: \"Executing [the BOP's] mission imposes on us a \nprofound obligation to protect the health and safety of all inmates.\"15  Not only the BOP's mission, \nbut the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires no less.  \nV.   The Preliminary Injunction \nWhere, as here, a court enters a preliminary injunction in a civil case regarding prison \nconditions, the injunction \"must be narrowly drawn, extend no further than necessary to correct \nthe harm the court finds requires preliminary relief, and be the least intrusive means necessary to \ncorrect that harm.\" 18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(a)(2). \nThe plaintiffs seek an injunction prohibiting \"further executions at FCC Terre Haute until \ninmates no longer face an unreasonable risk of contracting COVID-19 because of the executions.\" \nDkt. 48 at 8. They propose two paths by which the risk of COVID-19 could be sufficiently \nmitigated.  First,  the  defendants  could  \"administer  an  FDA-approved  vaccine  to  the  inmate \npopulation.\" Second, the defendants could implement a series of testing and quarantine measures \n \n15 Mem. for Director of BOP re Increasing Use of Home Confinement at Institutions Most Affected \nby COVID-19, at 1, 3 (April 3, 2020), https://www.justice.gov/file/1266661/download. \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 55   Filed 01/07/21   Page 20 of 22 PageID #: 1137\nto minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission to inmates from execution activities. These \nproposed measure include (1) a 14-day quarantine for execution team members upon arriving in \nTerre Haute, (2) a negative COVID-19 test before each team member is allowed to begin execution \nduties, (3) daily testing for execution team members throughout their post-execution time in Terre \nHaute, (4) a 14-day quarantine for FCC staff after any involvement in execution-related duties, \n(6) a negative COVID-19 test before any such staff member is allowed to return to normal duties, \nand (7) comprehensive contact tracing for any BOP or FCC staff member who tests positive for \nCOVID-19.  \nThese  extensive  precautions  (or  a  vaccination  of  the  full  inmate  population)  might \nconstitute best practices from an epidemiological perspective, but the Eighth Amendment does not \nrequire defendants to eliminate all additional risk. See Collins v. Seeman, 462 F.3d 757, 762 \n(7th Cir. 2006) (\"A defendant with knowledge of a risk need not take perfect action or even \nreasonable action\" to avoid Eighth Amendment liability) (quotation marks omitted). The Court \nconcludes  that  defendants  can  avoid  violating  the  plaintiffs'  Eighth  Amendment  rights  by \nimplementing a less onerous set of precautions than those the plaintiffs propose: \n1.  Enforce mask requirements for all staff participants in the executions.  \n2.  Maintain contact logs for all FCC Terre Haute staff members involved in any \nexecution who have close contactโwithin 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes over the \ncourse of a 24-hour periodโwith any other person during execution preparation, \nduring an execution, or during the post-execution process.   \n3.  For 14 days following any such close contact, require all impacted FCC Terre Haute \nstaff members to produce a negative COVID-19 result using one of the complex's \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 55   Filed 01/07/21   Page 21 of 22 PageID #: 1138\nrapid testing machines each day before beginning ordinary duties that involve \ninteraction with FCC inmates.  \n4.  Conduct thorough contract tracing for any such FCC staff member who tests \npositive for COVID-19 during this 14-day period.  \nThe Court will therefore issue a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants from \ncarrying out executions unless and until the defendants have implemented the above precautionary \nmeasures.  \nVI.  Conclusion \nThe plaintiffs' second motion for preliminary injunction, dkt. [47], is granted in part and \ndenied in part. A separate order for preliminary injunction shall issue. \n  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n \n \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 55   Filed 01/07/21   Page 22 of 22 PageID #: 1139\nDistribution: \n \nRobert A.

They sought \nonly injunctive relief.  \nOn February 22, 2021, the defendants moved to dismiss this action as moot, arguing that \nthere is no live controversy because there are no further executions currently scheduled and there \nis no reasonable expectation that another federal execution will be scheduled in the near future. \nDkt. 80 at 3โ5.

NINA H. FEFFERMAN  \n \nI, Nina Fefferman, certify under penalty of perjury that the following statement is true \nand correct: \n1.  I am a full  Professor at the University  of Tennessee, Knoxville,  in  both  the \nDepartment of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and the Department of Mathematics. I am also \nthe  Director  of  the  Mathematical  Modeling  Consulting  Center  at  the  National  Institute for \nMathematical  and  Biological  Synthesis,  and  the  Associate  Director  of  the  University  of \nTennessee One Health Initiative. My research focuses on complex adaptive systems, with a focus \non  the  interplay  between individual behavior  and infectious disease  epidemiology.  Complex \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 3 of 22 PageID #: 801\nadaptive  systems are  systems that have a  large number of components that  interact  and  adapt \nsuch that the system is more complicated than its various partsโ for example, living  organisms, \neconomies, or cities. \n2.  I have worked for the past 16 years as a researcher of the epidemiology, ecology, \nand evolution of infectious disease, pandemic preparedness, national biosecurity, and infrastructure \nprotection.  I  hold a  Masterโs  degree  in mathematics from  Rutgers  University  and a PhD in \nBiology  from Tufts University. \n3.  For over a decade, I was one of the primary researchers of the Command, Control, \nand Interoperability Center for Advanced Data Analysis, a U.S. Department of Homeland Security \n(โDHSโ) Center of Excellence, where I ran a research group focusing  on the mathematics of both \nbiosecurity and cybersecurity.  As part of my role in that center,  I actively contributed models and \npolicy  recommendations  to DHS and its affiliate  agencies  for  how  to  manage  and  mitigate \npandemic threats from H1N1  2009  flu,  Ebola  in  West  Africa,  and  Zika virus.    I  have  also \nconsulted for various additional state and federal agencies and private companies, domestically and \nabroad, in the area of outbreak management since 2004.  \n4.  I have studied COVID-19 extensively since February, 2020 and modeled the \nCOVID-19 outbreak with specific attention to the risks of spread from and within carceral \nfacilities and the corresponding implications for community healthcare resources.  I received a \ngrant from the National Science Foundation on May 1, 2020 to model the coupled social and \nepidemiological networks that determine the success of behavioral interventions on limiting \nspread of COVID-19.  In addition to my research, I have given numerous presentations in my \nfield, including presentations about modeling for the pandemic for the National Institute for \nMathematical and Biological Synthesis on March 31, 2020 and modeling the risk of COVID-19 \nfor prisons and health care resources at COVID-19 Special Track to 28th Conference on Intelligent \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 4 of 22 PageID #: 802\nSystems for Molecular Biology on July 16, 2020.  \n5.  My C.V., attached  as Exhibit A, includes  a list  of my honors,  experience, and \npublications. \n6.  I have been asked to evaluate the risk that holding three federal executions during \nthe week of January 11, 2020 poses to prisoners detained in FCC Terre Haute, including in \nparticular FCI Terre Haute.  I am donating my time reviewing materials and preparing this report. \nIf I were to provide any live testimony, it would also be provided pro bono. \n7.  This declaration is based upon my experience modeling COVID-19, my review of \nthe scientific literature regarding COVID-19, and my review of materials provided to me by \ncounsel.  For the description of the execution plans and layout of FCC Terre Haute, I rely upon  \nmultiple declarations signed by BOP staff, including those from Rick Winter, an attorney with \nthe Bureau of Prisons (November 21, 2019; July 12, 2020; November 24, 2020), and T.J. Watson, \nthe Warden of FCC Terre Haute. These declarations are attached as Exhibit B.  I rely upon a \nfairly limited set of BOP materials regarding contact tracing and testing related to FCC Terre \nHaute and federal executions, which I understand have been produced by FCC Terre Haute or \nBOP (with redactions), attached as Exhibit C. \n8.  Based on my review of these materials, it is my opinion that the plan to carry out \nexecutions during the week of January 11, 2021 poses a substantial risk of COVID-19 spread and \nillness to FCC Terre Haute prisoners, including those incarcerated at FCI Terre Haute.  As \nexplained below, this is because the executions will introduce hundreds of individuals to the \nprison environment, significantly increasing the number of potential exposures to infection from \nCOVID-19 for the staff and in turn for prisoners at FCI Terre Haute, USP Terre Haute and the \nFPC.  The risk is not limited to inmates in USP Terre Haute, where death row prisoners are \nhoused, because of the high transmissibility of COVID-19, including by individuals who are pre-\n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 5 of 22 PageID #: 803\nsymptomatic and asymptomatic; the involvement in the executions of numerous FCC Terre Haute \nstaff members from all facilities, who then return to their normal duties and extensively interact \nwith inmates and fellow staff members in those facilities; and the ease with which any disease is \ntransmitted in a congregate setting like a prison, where social distancing is impossible and other \npreventative measures such as wearing masks and frequent hand-washing occur inconsistently at \nbest.  The risk is compounded if a prison is overcrowded, which I understand is the case here \n(including within FCI Terre Haute), and if a prison fails to systematically test prison staff  and \ninmates and then contact trace those staff and inmates who test positive, which appears to be the \ncase at FCC Terre Haute.  Holding executions also disrupts the existing precautions enacted at \nFCC Terre Haute to reduce the spread of COVID-19.    \n9.  In the context of COVID-19 transmission, people can act as carriers in spreading \nthe disease even when they are exhibiting no symptoms (and may never exhibit any symptoms), \nand relatively modest contact with an infected individual can result in passing the disease to \nsomeone else -- who, again, may or may not exhibit symptoms, or may do so only several days \nlater, but is nonetheless capable of spreading the disease.  And once disease begins to spread, one \ncase quickly becomes two, two become four, four become eight, eight become sixteen, etc., in \nexponential progression.  \n10.  COVID-19  is  not  a  static  disease  that  is  easily  contained,  even  in  the  best \nenvironment and even with the conscientious implementation of safety measures.  A prison is the \nantithesis of such an environment.   Bringing anyone who has COVID-19 into a prison complex \n-- even one as geographically large as FCC Terre Haute and with separate facilities within the \ncomplex -- creates a significant risk of spreading COVID to all parts of the complex.  The risk is, \nof course, greatest when the incidence of COVID infections outside the prison is extremely high, \nas is the case now and as will continue to be the case for the near term at least.  It is essential to \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 6 of 22 PageID #: 804\ndo everything one can to limit the number of contacts among individuals, some of whom might \nbe infectious, where other factors are not guaranteed to be controlled (e.g., social distancing, \nadequate ventilations systems, consistent use of masks, adequate restroom facilities, adequate \nfacilities and policies for quarantining or isolating inmates, etc.).   \n11.  Quantifying the increased risk of contracting COVID-19 to inmates in the USP \nTerre Haute, the FCI Terre Haute, and the FPC from holding executions at FCC Terre Haute  \nwould be difficult to do, because relevant data and contact tracing information are extremely \nlimited and have not, to the best of my knowledge, been made fully available to the plaintiffsโ \ncounsel.  One has, however, the scientific evidence regarding how quickly and extensively \nCOVID-19 spreads, generally and within  a prison setting; how spread can occur from individuals \nshowing no symptoms; how spread of COVID-19 is not geographically contained; how group \ngatherings contribute significantly to such a spread; and how certain populations are at an \nincreased  health  risk  if  they  contract  disease,  which  include  males,  people  over  65,  and \nindividuals with pre-existing conditions (all of which define large numbers of individuals within \nFCC Terre Haute).   \n12.  Based upon this scientific evidence, and as noted above, it is my opinion that \ninmates from all three facilities within FCC Terre Haute would face a substantially increased risk \nof contracting COVID-19, and suffering serious  health problems as a result, if executions \ncontinue at FCC Terre Haute at the current time and in the manner in which executions have been \nheld earlier this year at the prison.  The extent of this risk cannot  be quantified given the \ninformation available, but it is certainly higher than if no executions occurred at the present time \nand, in my opinion, it is substantial.  The executions risk increased importation of new COVID-\n19 infections as well as more efficient transmission of the virus within the prison because of staff \nmixing and other factors relating to the executions and conditions within the prison.        \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 7 of 22 PageID #: 805\n13.  It is perhaps helpful in this regard to consider examples of how COVID-19 has \nspread well beyond the narrow geographical confines in which contact first occurred between an \ninfectious individual and a susceptible individual.  One such example is a highly publicized \nwedding that occurred in rural Maine, attended by only 55 people.  The wedding led to COVID-\n19 outbreaks in the local community, in a long-term care facility located in a different county, \nand in a correctional facility in yet another county.  Overall, at least 177 COVID-19 cases were \nlinked to the event, including seven hospitalizations and seven deaths.1  The spread to the \ncorrectional facility occurred because a facility employee attended the wedding and then worked \nhis normal shifts in different housing units at the correctional facility, leading to 18 other staff \nmembers, 16 members of staff households, and 48 inmates testing positive.2 This is emblematic \nof how easily one infectious person can infect many people throughout a correctional facility, \nleading to otherwise avoidable infection and risk of serious complications, including death. \n14.  A second example was a business conference in Boston attended by approximately \n175 people over two days in February 2020.3  With the luxury of extensive genome data and \nreliable contact tracing information, researchers concluded that a single positive case likely led \n                                                   \n1  โMultiple COVID-19 Outbreaks Linked to a Wedding Reception in Rural Maine โ August 7โSeptember 14, \n2020,โ CDC Morbidity and Mortality Report at 1686-87 (Nov. 13, 2020) (โThe reception was held at a lodging \nestablishment in county A that had an attached restaurant and four dining areas, including the event room, \nbreakfast room, bar, and an open deck. Guests were seated indoors in the event room, which had 10 \ntables, with 4โ6 guests seated around each table. The total number of wedding guests (55) exceeded \nMaineโs 50-person limit for indoor gathering in a shared space. Facility staff members had conducted \ntemperature checks for all guests at the facility entrance; these were reported as normal. Although the \nfacility had signs posted at the entrance instructing visitors to wear masks, guests did not comply with this \nrequirement nor maintain a physical distance of โฅ6 feet, and staff members did not enforce these \nmeasures; all staff members wore masks.  The facility did not collect contact information from guests.โ), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6945a5-H.pdf. \n \n2  Id. at 1688-89. \n \n3  โPhylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in Boston highlights the impact of superspreading events,โ \nScience Mag. (Dec. 10, 2020), https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/12/09/science.abe3261.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 8 of 22 PageID #: 806\nto roughly 100 people from the event testing positive, which in turn may have led to as many as \n300,000 becoming infected in Massachusetts, in other states, and in other countries.  The disease \ndid not remain within the conference facilities, or Boston, or the adjoining counties, or even the \nUnited States.   \n15.  In similar fashion, execution events -- which involve roughly the same number of \nparticipants as the Boston conference and more participants than the Maine wedding -- could lead \nto a spreading of the disease well beyond an initial point of contact, even if it begins within the \nbuilding that houses the death chamber or elsewhere in USP Terre Haute.  I am not suggesting \nthat executions will lead to as many as 300,000 people contracting COVID-19 who otherwise \nmight not have done so, as with the Boston conference, or even 177 people, as with the Maine \nwedding (although the latter number is certainly possible).  The point is simply that, given the \ncurrent prevalence of COVID throughout most of the United States, including Indiana, one or \nmore people in a large group, who have not been quarantining, are likely COVID-positive and \nwill spread infection to multiple individuals absent adequate safeguards, who in turn will further \nspread the disease, well beyond where it began.  This is not a low-risk hypothetical, it is a high-\nprobability likelihood, with potentially deadly consequences.    \n16.  Individuals traveling to Terre Haute for executions. The BOP describes a large \nnumber of individuals who will travel to Terre Haute for each execution.  This includes the: \na.  The BOP execution team members.  Most recently, BOP has stated that the โexecution \nteam is comprised of approximately 40 BOP employees who are employed at locations \nother than FCC Terre Haute.โ  (Ex. B p. 9, ยถ 17).  Previously, BOP referred to an execution \nteam of over 40 BOP staff members.  The BOP noted that the โstaff members will, by \nnecessity,  be  removed  from  their  normal  duties,  which  include  a  wide  range  of \ncorrectional and administrative positions within the BOP. Pursuant to the current \noperational plan, these staff members are scheduled to cease their normal duties several \ndays in advance of a scheduled execution, in order to give the team time to practice and \nprepare for their role in an execution. In addition to the team members, a number of BOP \nadministrators will be present as well, also ceasing their normal duties in the days in \nadvance of an execution.โ  (Ex. B p. 2, Winter Decl. ยถ 5.) (emphasis added).   \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 9 of 22 PageID #: 807\n \nb.  An unknown number of contractors. (Ex. B p. 2, Winter Decl. ยถ 6.) (โAdditionally, the \nBOP plans to use contractors who have made themselves available and presumably have \nmade any necessary arrangements for personal and work related matters based on the \nexecutions scheduled in December.โ) (emphasis added).  \n \nc.  Several out of state witnesses to the execution. It is my understanding that none of the \nindividuals scheduled for execution in January 2020 are from Indiana and that all of the \nfamily members of the victims as well as the family members and counsel for the prisoners \nreside out of state.    \n \nd.  Journalists witnessing the executions or covering the executions.  \n \ne.  Protestors of the execution.  \n \nf.  Additional security from โfederal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.โ (Ex. B. p. \n2, Winter Decl. ยถ 7).   \n \nMost recently, the BOP estimated that between 50 and 125 individuals will travel to Terre Haute \nfor each federal execution. (Ex. B. p. 9, Watson Decl. ยถ 16).  For the execution scheduled for \nJanuary 12, 2020, of Lisa Montgomery, it appears that additional personnel will be involved \nbecause of the need to transport Ms. Montgomery from a Texas womenโs prison where she is \ncurrently incarcerated (and where her lawyers apparently contracted COVID when visiting her).  \n(Ex. B pp. 17-18, Winter Decl. ยถยถ 4, 7-8).  The execution team members โarrive only a few days \nprior to a scheduled executionโ and begin โvarious team-sensitive tasks upon their arrival.โ (Ex. \nB p. 9, Watson ยถ 17). They do not quarantine upon arrival. Id. \n17.  Each of the individuals traveling to the Terre Haute facility is a potential carrier \nof the COVID-19 disease and a potential source of infection to others with whom they have close \ncontacts.  A close contact is defined by the CDC as someone who is within six feet of an infected \nperson for at least 15 minutes cumulative over a day, starting from 2 days before the onset of the \nillness.  Individuals traveling to the executions may be infected without knowing it before they \nbegin the travel, either in the period before onset of symptoms or in the absence of symptoms if \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 10 of 22 PageID #: 808\nthey are asymptomatic. Those individuals might also become exposed through travel. Airplane \ntravel, staying in hotels, taking cabs or an Uber, and eating at restaurants all carry risks. The \npotential for one infected person to pass the virus to a group is the basis for the health directives \nissued by state and local public health officials around the country discouraging holiday travel \nand gatherings.  It is also the basis for the CDCโs recommendation that prisons avoid all non-\nessential visitors when there is a COVID outbreak inside the prison or in the local community.   \n18.  FCI Terre Haute staffโs participation in the executions and the risk of spread \nto FCI Terre Haute prisoners.  The involvement of FCI Terre Haute staff in the executions \nposes significant risk for spreading of COVID-19 throughout the complex, including to FCI Terre \nHaute prisoners, in light of the large number of prison staff involved in the executions and the \nmany interactions those staff have with others as a result of and following the executions.  \nSomewhere between 70 and 200 FCC Terre Haute staff participate in the security, logistics and \ntransportation support during an execution. (Ex. B p. 2, Winter Decl. ยถ 8, describing 200 FCC \nTerre Haute staff members); (Ex. B p. 11, Watson Decl. ยถ 22 describing execution events as \nrequiring โ70 or moreโ FCC Terre Haute staff).  The Complex Warden described the role of FCC \nTerre Haute employees: \nThese FCC Terre Haute employees are not considered part of the execution team, and instead \ninclude staff that work at the USP, FCI, and FPC. For example, FCC staff manage check \npoints and perimeter security, staff the command center, and escort witnesses and \ndemonstrators. FCC staff managing check points will check IDโs and temperatures; some \nstaff in the command center will likely meet with some execution team staff in order to \ncoordinate the operation; and staff escorting witnesses and demonstrators will by necessity \ninteract with the witnesses and demonstrators.   (Ex. B p. 11, Watson Decl. ยถ 22). (See also \nWatson Decl. ยถ 17:  โSome members of the execution team have interaction with FCC Terre \nHaute personnel incident to their role in the operation of the execution.  For example, the \nexecution team may interact [with FCC Terre Haute staff] wen going through security check \npoints, receiving the inmate, receiving witnesses, and meeting with Terre Haute personnel \nto discuss operations logistics and equipment.โ)  \n \nFCI prisoners are at heightened risk of spread of COVID-19 for each interaction that FCI staff \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 11 of 22 PageID #: 809\nhave  in  preparing  for or  carrying out the executions that places them  in close contact of  \npotentially infected individuals.  FCI prisoners are also at a heightened risk of contracting COVID \nfrom any contact they have with any staff member (assigned to FCI Terre Haute or not) who, \nalthough not involved with the executions, subsequently interacted as a close contact with any \nFCC employee who was involved with the executions. \n19.  As  with  the  consequences  of  the  Maine  wedding  or  the  Boston  conference \nreferenced above, there may well be degrees of separation between FCI inmates and individuals \nwho directly participated in an execution and who may have been infected.  Those degrees of \nseparation, however, mean even less in a prison environment than they did after the wedding or \nconference, because prison staff work in multiple facilities, adequate protective measures are not \ntaken relative to execution team members and other visitors before they enter FCC Terre Haute, \nand adequate protective measures are not taken after an execution before FCC staff members are \nallowed to resume their normal duties.  I discuss such protective measure later in this declaration.   \n20.  COVID-19  is  highly  efficient  at  transmission  before  individuals  become \nsymptomatic.  It may be fourteen days before an infected person becomes symptomatic, or as short \nas 2 days. In a carceral setting, where rates of transmission are particularly high because of \ncrowding (and, in the case of FCC Terre Haute, overcrowding) and the lack of adequate ventilation, \nthis is of heightened concern.  The worst-case scenario is where one individual becomes a super \nspreader, spreading infection to a large number of individuals over a short period of time. But even \nassuming an average reproduction number (or R0, pronounced โR naughtโ) of 2 for COVID-19 \n(i.e., the average number of individuals someone infects when positive), the disease will spread \nquickly for each day it is undetected. This means that if a correction officer contracted COVID-\n19, his infection was not detected, and he continued to work for three days before becoming \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 12 of 22 PageID #: 810\nsymptomatic, each of those three days could see a two-fold increase in the number of individuals \nat the prison infected by the staffer. For example, on day 1, the staffer could infect 2 people and \nby day 3 (the first day anyone might notice the staffer was infected without exhaustive screening \nof apparently healthy people), eight people might have become infected based on average infection \nrates:  \n \nSee โR0: How scientists quantify the intensity of an outbreak like coronavirus and predict the \npandemicโs spread,โ The Conversation, https://theconversation.com/r0-how-scientists-quantify-\nthe-intensity-of-an-outbreak-like-coronavirus-and-predict-the-pandemics-spread-130777.   \n21.  The individuals at risk are all those who were close contacts with anyone who was \ninfected, defined by the CDC as someone โwithin 6 feet of an infected person for a cumulative \ntotal of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period starting from 2 days before illness onset (or, for \nasymptomatic patients, 2 days prior to test specimen collection) until the time the patient is \nisolated.โ The CDC notes that the individual exposures should be added together over a 24-hour \nperiod (e.g., three 5-minute exposures for a total of 15 minutes).  For example, a staff member who \ngoes through security three times a day for five minutes each is a close contact of those other staff \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 13 of 22 PageID #: 811\nmembers who work at the security check point and sit or stand within 6 feet of those who pass \nthrough security.   \n22.  The  declaration  filed  by  Rick  Winter  on  July  12,  2020  and  contact  tracing \ndocuments concerning the July federal executions provide a window into the exposures created \nby one FCI Terre Haute staff member who participated in the execution preparations while \npositive for COVID-19, before he was aware of his exposure or illness. (Ex. B pp. 20-22, Winter \nDecl.; Ex. C). That staff member โ I will designate him as Staffer A - indicated in his contact \ntracing interview that he was in contact with โA lotโ of staff and โA lotโ of prisoners in days \nbefore the onset of his illness, including contact with prisoners through rounds of prisoner units.  \n(See Exhibit C).  \n \nStaffer A reported that while conducting his daily tasks during the days between exposure and \ndiagnosis, many of the persons he came into contact with at the prison were not masked.  \n \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 14 of 22 PageID #: 812\n \n23.  The BOP noted that Staffer A, while potentially infected, โamong other things, \nattended the law enforcement meeting with outside law enforcement in preparation for the \nscheduled  executions;  attended  a  meeting  regarding  the  handling  of  demonstrators  at  the \nscheduled executions; and attended to an issue at the SCU.โ   (Ex. B p. 21, Winter Decl. ยถ 6).   \nBased on that information and assuming the execution-related meetings were at least 15 minutes \nlong, Staffer Aโs close contacts included: all FCC Terre Haute staff assisting in the execution, \nother federal employees and other law enforcement who attended the law enforcement meeting; \nall FCC Terre Haute staff who attended the demonstrator meetings; other federal employees  who \nattended the meeting; all incarcerated people in the USP or FCI who were within six feet of \nStaffer A for a total of 15 minutes in any 24-hour period in the two days before his exposure; and \nall other staff in contact with Staffer A or another infectious individual throughout the work shift \nfor a total of 15 minutes, including at security, in break or meal rooms, or other staff meetings.  \nAny of those individuals who became infected would themselves have created their own waves \nof exposure.   \n24.  The introduction of potential  new sources  of infection  in prisons is particularly \nconcerning because of the higher rates of contact amongst  susceptible incarcerated people, due \nto  the  density and  structure  of  prison  housing  arrangements (including limited ability to \nquarantine potentially exposed individuals and to segregate individuals who test positive), the lack \nof ability to socially distance or isolate, inadequate facilities for personal hygiene, difficulty in \nmaintaining adequate disinfection of high-touch surfaces, and poor ventilation within prisons. \nThese dynamics drive the resulting efficacy (or lack of efficacy) of any proposed interventions. \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 15 of 22 PageID #: 813\n25.  Impact on COVID-19 preventative measures and contact tracing.  The BOP \nhas pledged to โcontinue to do everything [it] can to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in [its] \nfacilities,โ which presumably includes incorporating CDC recommended precaution into visiting \nprocedures. The BOP has said that it is following guidance from both the CDC and the World \nHealth Organization. (Ex. B p. 6, Watson Decl. ยถ 8).  It has adopted a number of preventative \nCOVD-19 measures, including โ[a]s much as possibleโ assigning staff to the same posts (rather \nthan rotating staff between facilities) โas an additional measure to mitigate the spread of the virus.โ \n(Ex. B p. 6, Watson Decl. ยถ 8, citing BOP COVID 19 Modified Operations).  (However, staff \napparently do move โbetween the separate facilities and buildingsโ when โnecessary, for example, \nif one institution is in need of additional staff due to staff being on leave on a given day, or \notherwise requires assistance of additional staff.โ  (Ex. B p. 7, Watson Decl. ยถ 10)). \n26.  Visitation at FCI Terre Haute is suspended to reduce the spread of COVID-19.  \nFederal Bureau of Prisons, FCI Terre Haute, https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/tha/ (Dec. \n19, 2020) (โ! Visiting at the prison camp has been suspended until further notice.โ).   \n27.  The BOP quarantines and isolates all new intake to the prison into either quarantine \nfor asymptotic individuals or medical isolation for symptomatic individuals for at least 14 days.  \nBOP Modified Operations, https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/covid19_status.jsp.   \n28.  Prisoners are only released to the general population after a negative COVID-19 \ntest at the end of the quarantine period.  Id.  \n29.  These precautions are sound.  However, they are significantly undermined by the \nfederal executions, which require large numbers of staff to be reassigned to execution-related \nfunctions.  The Warden has described the impact of the executions on functioning of the prison, \nsaying that โ[w]ith its staff pulled away from their normal duties, FCC Terre Haute will not be \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 16 of 22 PageID #: 814\nable to operate under normal conditions. For example, due to expected staffing issues and changes \nin security procedures, FCC Terre Haute will not be able to prepare inmate meals in the ordinary \nfashion.โ  (Ex. B p. 2, Winter Decl. ยถ 5). The fact that large numbers of staff must be pulled form \nnormal duties is of consequence in light of COVID-19 for a number of reasons. The plan to pull \nsignificant numbers of staffing itself adds pressure to the system for likelihood of spread within \nthe prison.  By pulling staff from their regular duties, other staff will necessarily be reassigned to \ncover those missing positions. This increases the circles of exposure.  Reduced staffing also means \nthat staff will likely have a slower response time to respond to individuals who become sick and \nneed medical attention, thereby increasing the exposure times for cell-mates or cell neighbors of \nthose developing symptoms.   \n30.  There are other areas of concern. For example, without adequate staffing, the \ndistribution plan for meals or medications could require additional movement or gathering of larger \ngroups  of  inmates  at  one  time,  increasing  exposures.  The  staffing  shortage  problems  are \nexacerbated by the fact that, according to the BOP website,  20+ FCC Terre Haute employees \ncurrently have COVID-19 and presumably are out of the workplace.    Other staff must cover for \nthe staff members who are out of work, again leading to increased exposures and an increased risk \nof spread among the inmate population, including within FCI Terre Haute.  \n31.  The redistributing and mixing of staff also complicate efforts to conduct meaningful \ncontact tracing. The CDC stresses the importance of โcase investigation and contact tracing, a core \ndisease control measure employed by local and state health department personnelโ as a method for \nor preventing spread of COIVD-19.4  The CDC directs that public health staff should work to \nidentify all individuals with close contacts to an exposed person, and then to warn those individuals \n                                                   \n4 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/principles-contact-tracing.html.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 17 of 22 PageID #: 815\nof the exposure and recommend 14-day home quarantines after their last known exposure.  It has \nmade clear that โidentifying contacts and ensuring they do not interact with others is critical to \nprotect communities from further spread.โ  Id.   \n32.  Returning to the example of Staffer A, he was notified on July 8 of his own \nexposure to someone who was positive, took a test for COVID-19 on July 8, and received his \npositive test results on July 11. (Ex. C, p. 1). The BOP reported on July 12 that it had begun \ncontact tracing for Staffer A. This  is consistent with the spreadsheet that shows that staff \ncontinued to be identified and tested for several days after the disclosure. BOP contact tracing \ndocuments of โexposure testing infoโ for staff show that the 23 additional BOP staff who were \nexposed to Staffer A were identified and given tests on July 12, July 13, July 14, July 15, July \n16, or July 17. (Ex. C, pp. 9-10).  As it turns out, these staff all had negative tests: \n \n \n(Ex. C, p. 9).  Had any one of them been positive, however, several days would have gone by \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 18 of 22 PageID #: 816\nsince Staffer A tested positive, during which dozens if not hundreds of contacts might have \noccurred with other staff and with inmates, and the inmates could easily have been located in \ndifferent facilities given staffing practices at FCC Terre Haute.  \n33.  Contact  tracing  in  this  environment,  where  staffโs  regular  routines  and \nassignments are disrupted, creates new challenges and at a minimum almost certainly slows and \ninterferes with the contact tracing.  Introducing a large number of individuals with multiple \ncontacts throughout the prison system, with overlapping training meetings involving multiple \nstaff โ like prison-wide doctors and custodians โ increases the number of individuals who can \nreseed the infection. For each day that the contact tracing is slowed, there is the exponentially \ngrowing possibility of undetected transmission and spread to other staffers and prisoners. It also \ncreates the possibility that some exposed individuals will not be detected because of the unusual \nand disrupted work patterns of the day.  Staffer A, for example, was not able to identify by name \nall of the staff with whom he came into contact several days earlier. The spreadsheets indicate \nthat four additional staff who were symptomatic were tested between July 18 and July 27, each \nof whom tested positive for COVID-19:  \n  \n(Ex. C, p. 10). Three of these four staff members worked at FCI Terre Haute and developed \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 19 of 22 PageID #: 817\nsymptoms between July 17, 2020 and July 25, 2020. 5   Did they contract COVID from Staffer \nA, who assisted with the execution?  Possibly.  \n34.  I am not aware of any records that show any contact tracing with respect to \nprisoners. If it is occurring, it appears to be episodic not systematic--and it should be systematic. \nThere have been multiple outbreaks of COVID-19 among prisoners within FCI Terre Haute. \nhttps://experience.arcgis.com/experience/ab22fb4c564e4f4b986e257c685190e8/page/page_2/.  \n35.  The introduction of large numbers of personnel to the prison facility who interact \nwith FCI and other staff is a likely explanation for waves of infection that have occurred in \nconnection with prior executions.  The fact that  infections may not have spiked following every \nexecution, or may not have  increased as dramatically, does not negate the significance of \ninstances in which spikes did occur, given the various factors that influence the spread of COVID \n(e.g., the prevalence of COVID infections outside the prison at the time of a given execution and \nthus the probability that one or more visitors would be infectious while participating in the \nexecution).  To use an analogy, if there is a 60% chance of a given hurricane making landfall and \nit ends up turning beforehand, that does not mean there wasnโt a huge risk to staying in the \nprojected path of that hurricane.  The next hurricane could well make landfall as predicted. \n36.  The more recent COVID-19 cases from November provide another example to \nview the disruption to meaningful contact tracing and subsequent risk to prisoners at FCC Terre \nHaute.  Following a November 17, 2020 execution, a number of individuals reported positive \nCOVID-19 tests: 9 of the execution team members who carried out the execution and the spiritual \nadvisor to the executed prisoner who observed the execution tested positive. The execution team \nmembers were all within the execution facility for more than 15 minutes and should be considered \n                                                   \n5 Staffer who had symptoms on 7/17/2020 worked at FCI, Ex. C p. 72; staffer who developed symptoms on \n7/19/2020 worked at FCI, Ex. C p. 62; staffer who had symptoms on 7/25 worked in USP & FCI, Ex. C, p. 53.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 20 of 22 PageID #: 818\nclose contacts of everyone who attended the execution; they also likely spent more than 15 \nminutes within other locations at the USP, including time with staff from FCC Terre Haute. The \nBOP reports that, except for one team member who was the subject of an unknown degree of \ncontact tracing by his BOP institution, BOP did not do contact tracing of these individuals:  \nDefendants state that they do not possess the test results for these individuals because the \ntests were conducted by outside, third-party providers, not the Bureau of Prisons. The \nDefendants also state that the Bureau of Prisons conducted contact tracing for one of the \nstaff members at his home Institution; however, the Defendants to do not possess responsive \ndocuments regarding the other eight staff members because the Bureau of Prisons did not \nconduct the contact tracing for those individuals. By way of explanation, the execution team \nis comprised of members from various BOP locations and was designed to protect the \nconfidentiality of its members. Therefore, when team members report back to their home \ninstitution, the institution staff many not know that the employee was a member of the \nexecution team in order to contact trace them, nor do they generally know the identities of \nother staff members who are part of the execution team. Moreover, some execution teams \nmembers who tested positive did not return to work at their home institution until meeting \nCDC guidelines; therefore negating the need for contact tracing at all. Defendants have \nproduced the redacted contact tracing records for the one execution team staff member of \nwhom it possess responsive records.  (Ex. C, p. 5).  \n37.  Because the BOP did not conduct contact tracing for eight of the nine infected \nexecution team members and says it did not receive copies of any contacting tracing reports done \nby outside entities (if any contact tracing was done),  BOPโs attempts, if any, to identify FCC \nTerre Haute staff who may have been infected would have been hamstrung and incomplete. The \nexplanation by the BOP for why it did not need to do contact tracing of those infected members \nof the execution team โ that some of those individuals isolated at home after testing positive โ \nsuggests a basic and disturbing misunderstanding of the principles and purpose of contact tracing.  \n38.  It is my understanding that the BOP also did not do contact tracing of the spiritual \nadvisor  who  attended the  November  execution  and  then  tested  positive.  According  to  his \ndeclaration, which I have read, the spiritual advisor was transported in a closed-environment \nshuttle bus van with eight other people to the execution, a trip that would have lasted at least 15 \nminutes. The Wardenโs declaration suggests that transporting witnesses is the kind of assignment \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 21 of 22 PageID #: 819\nto which FCC Terre Haute staff were assigned.  If the bus were staffed by FCC Terre Haute staff, \nthose staff should have been notified as close contacts and tested. Staff who were in the execution \nfacility with the spiritual advisor, or who processed him at security and who may have escorted \nhim for a total of 15 minutes within the prison, should also have been notified and tested.  I am \nnot aware of any records indicating that this occurred.  If it did not occur, all those close contacts \nbecame possible sources of disease spread within all parts of the complex.  Indeed, they became \npossible sources of disease spread within the Complex even if contact tracing and testing were \ndone, for the period leading up to when any test results were obtained.  \n39.  In addition to the increased risk to prisoners of contracting COVID-19, a separate \narea of concern is the very real probability that some of the individuals attending the training, \nvisitation, and/or execution will become exposed and travel home with the virus, increasing the \noverall level of risk to the broader community. Without contact tracing, exposures in this kind of \nlarge-scale event will be hard to control and prevent from spreading infection.   \n40.  Necessary safety measures. The safest way to avoid having executions spread \nCOVID-19 within FCC Terre Haute is not to have executions during the current pandemic.  \nAlternatively,  one  would  delay  all  further  executions  until  staff  and  inmates  have  been \nvaccinated.  A third option would be to implement safety measure that would significantly reduce \nthe risk that executions pose to inmates and to others in and out of FCC Terre Haute.   \n41.  In order to proceed with executions in a manner that does not subject staff and \nprisoners of FCC Terre Haute to a substantial risk of exposure to COVID-19, the BOP would \nneed to institute appropriate safety measures that would include at least the following measures. \nFirst, the BOP should impose precautionary restrictions upon the 70-200 persons (execution team \nmembers,  other  BOP  staff,  media,  family  members  and  legal  teams,  state  and  local  law \nenforcement personnel and contractors) who travel to Terre Haute to participate in some manner \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-2   Filed 12/28/20   Page 22 of 22 PageID #: 820\nin the executions to ensure that they do not bring the virus into the prison. The BOP should \nmandate a two (2) week quarantine once they have arrived in Terre Haute (and with the 2-week \nclock being reset if anyone within a combined quarantine, such as individuals traveling together, \ndevelops symptoms during quarantine), and a negative test before they begin performing their \nduties relating to the executions or otherwise interact with any FCC Terre Haute staff.  Second, \nif multiple executions are scheduled for the same week (as is true for the executions scheduled in \nJanuary and was true with past executions), the BOP should require rapid testing each morning \nfor those BOP staff and FCC Terre Haute staff participating in each execution during each day \nof the week, to ensure that they did not become exposed and develop infection after their \nquarantine period. Third, the BOP should restrict congregation of the execution personnel with \nFCC Terre Haute staff, impose strict social distancing requirements when any interactions occur, \nand strictly enforce mask mandates (including prohibiting meal sharing or other activities which \nrequire removal of masks). The BOP should develop policies to ensure that execution personnel \nand staff members are not engaged in profligate activities together during the quarantine period, \nsuch as those involving alcohol, or other inhibition-lowering activities. Fourth, no FCC Terre \nHaute employee should be allowed to return to his or her normal duties within the Complex until \nthey have quarantined for a two-week period and tested negative for COVID-19.  Finally, if the \nBOP  or  FCC  Terre  Haute  has  identified  an  infected  team  member,  they  must  conduct \ncomprehensive and complete contact tracing in accordance with CDC guidelines.  \nPursuant  to 28  U.S.C. ยง 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \ndeclaration is true and correct.

FORMOSA \n \n \nI, Charles P. Formosa, declare as follows:  \n \n1.  I am an investigator with the Federal Public Defenderโs Office for the Western \nDistrict of Washington, where I have been employed since February of 2007.  IFrom July 1995 \nthrough November 1998, I was employed by the Office of the Capital Collateral Representative in \nFlorida, where I investigated the cases of inmates sentenced to death by the State of Florida \nthroughout state post-conviction proceedings and Habeas Corpus review.  From November 1998 \nto February 2007, I was employed by the Federal Public Defenderโs Office in the Eastern District \nof California, where I investigated the cases of inmates sentenced to death by the State of \nCalifornia during Habeas Corpus review.  \n  1 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-6   Filed 12/28/20   Page 3 of 7 PageID #: 947\n2.  I was part of Brandon Bernardโs legal team.  Brandon was executed by the federal \ngovernment on December 10th, 2020.  I was the legal representative for and witness to Mr. \nBernardโs execution  \n3.  This declaration is based upon my best memory of my personal involvement and \npersonal observations during the execution process for Brandon. \n4.  On the morning of Brandonโs execution, I met with him in a visiting room for death-\nrow inmates at USP Terre Haute.  We talked through a partition with three pieces of plexiglass \ncovering the lower parts of the partition except for the three or four inches from the sides of the \nplexiglass. My previous legal visits were in a similar room but without the fencing and plexiglass.   \nI visited with Brandon for approximately 2 ยฝ hours.  \n5.  Before my visit with Brandon, I was processed through security where I came into \nclose contact with one BOP staff member and two members of Mr. Bourgeoisโ legal team.  Mr. \nBourgeois was scheduled to be executed on December 11, 2020, and his legal team was visiting \nwith him.  \n6.  In order to get to the visiting rooms, a different BOP employee from the one who \nprocessed me walked me and the two members of the legal team for Mr. Bourgeois through the \nhalls of the prison where we eventually we took a 12 by 20 feet elevator to the death row visiting \nrooms.  It was not possible to socially distance in the elevator. During my visit with Brandon, I \nsaw some BOP employees walking in the hall behind him who were not wearing masks. When I \nleft the visit, I took the same elevator with the BOP officer and now three members of the \nBourgeois team. Mr. Bourgeois was represented by the Federal Defenders Office in Philadelphia, \nPA who had traveled to Terre Haute as well. Most of the staff members I interacted with had masks \non (though some wore them below their noses).   \n  2 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-6   Filed 12/28/20   Page 4 of 7 PageID #: 948\n7.  I left the prison at 3:00 p.m. I grabbed lunch at a drive-thru and then drove \ndowntown to the Sheriffโs office to be picked up by the prison officials to be returned to the prison \nfor the execution.  I had been told to arrive at the Sheriffโs parking lot by 3:45 p.m.  \n8.  When I arrived at the Sheriffโs office parking lot, I met with Brandonโs aunt and \nspiritual advisor. We were outside, but Brandonโs aunt was not wearing a mask and was standing \nnext to Brandonโs spiritual advisor.  Brandonโs aunt was initially standing next to her car where \ntwo people who were not wearing masks were sitting. I do not remember if the spiritual advisor \nwas wearing his mask at that time. Brandonโs aunt is from Louisiana, but had been staying in Terre \nHaute for a week with the two people in her car. His spiritual advisor drove from New York with \nstops in different states before arriving in Terre Haute. The three of us were then met by one female \nand two male prison officials. They were wearing protective equipment and provided Brandonโs \naunt and spiritual advisor with surgical masks.  I brought my own mask. They had us fill out forms, \nand then we waited for about 30 minutes to receive word that we could come to the prison. \n9.  At that time, they put all of us into a white transit van with four rows of seats which \nwould accommodate approximately 11 people. There were six of us total in the van, including the \ndriver. The windows in the van were not open. During the ride, Brandonโs aunt pulled her mask \ndown exposing her nose and mouth a few times. BOP employees did not request she put her mask \nback on. I estimate that we spent approximately 15 minutes in the van.   \n10.  They drove us to the USP building, where death row is housed. At the front entrance \nof the BOP grounds, Brandonโs aunt and spiritual advisor had their temperatures checked. They \ndid not check mine because they recognized me as being at the prison earlier that day. They took \nus in the lobby to process us. They had us all sit down in the waiting area. Present were the six of \nus and three officers who processed us. They then called us one at a time to be screened. Each of \n  3 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-6   Filed 12/28/20   Page 5 of 7 PageID #: 949\nus went through a body scanner and the officers put our shoes, jackets, and belongings through the \nmetal detectors. They then used a hand wand on each of us, wanding us first in the front and then \nin the back. All of these actions took place in very close proximity with the officers.  While each \nperson went through the security measures, the others waited together. The security officers waited \nfor clearance from another area of the prison before moving us in the same van., There werenโt \nany windows that opened in the security screening room or the waiting area.   \n11.  They then drove us to another building. We entered the front door into a hallway \nwithout windows. They took us to a room that also had no windows. My memory is one escort \nstayed with us most of the time. I remember the other escorts went into a different room with two \nnew males and a new female BOP employee. The room had windows on two sides but I didnโt \nnotice if they were open. One of the new males from the other room came in to ask us how we \nwere doing. The female from the van ride came in as well. I remained in that room with the other \ntwo witnesses for Mr. Bernard for approximately two hours. They left the door open, but there \nwere no windows in the room. Brandonโs aunt did not wear her mask for most of the time. She \nwas the person who spoke the majority of the time while in the room and there were only a few \ninstances when she was silent. At one point, his aunt asked me how I could breathe in my mask. \nHis spiritual advisor pulled his mask down to eat snacks several times while sitting within two feet \nof Brandonโs aunt where he sat the majority of the time. We all were pulling our masks down to \ndrink water. The BOP employee who was in the room with us most of the time sat within three \nfeet of Brandonโs spiritual advisor and aunt. \n12.  About fifteen minutes before we actually left for the execution building, we were \nbrought out and told to get into the van by the original three BOP employees. Brandonโs spiritual \nadvisor was taken to a different van by a new BOP employee. After two or three minutes, all three \n  4 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-6   Filed 12/28/20   Page 6 of 7 PageID #: 950\nof us were returned to the same room we had come from. After fifteen or twenty minutes, we were \ndirected to get back in the vans. We were put in our van with the same three employees. Brandonโs \naunt removed her mask almost immediately after getting into the van. We were in the van for \napproximately ten minutes. During that time, Brandonโs aunt told stories and sang a song. At no \ntime did the BOP employees ask her to put her mask back on her face.   \n13.  Once we arrived at the execution building, Brandonโs aunt and I were escorted to a \nroom that was approximately eight by fourteen feet. In the room was the female employee who \nescorted us to the room from the van and two other BOP employees.   \n14.  The room had an approximately three and half by five window with a blind. In order \nto see Brandon, I had to stand next to Brandonโs aunt who had pulled her mask down so it was \nunder her chin exposing her mouth and nose. None of the BOP employees asked her to put her \nmask back on. After five minutes, the blind went up. I could see into the execution chamber but \ncould not see Brandon. I had to move around Brandonโs aunt to see Brandon. Before I moved, I \ncould see Brandonโs spiritual advisor and someone standing next to him. Once I moved around, I \nsaw Brandon was already in the room. He was strapped onto a custom table, though you could not \nsee the body straps because he was covered with a blanket. You could see the tubes going into his \nbody.  Standing in the room on the other side of Brandon from me was a BOP employee who made \nall of the announcements in a loud voice.  He never wore a mask.  Someone else in the room, \nwhom I could not see, read the death sentence pronouncement. The guy without the mask called \nto make sure there were not any โimpedimentsโ to continuing the execution. I could not see into \nany other room that might have a view into the execution chamber beyond the room with windows \nbehind Brandon and a window to the right of the BOP employee who was not wearing a mask.  \n  5 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00630-JMS-DLP   Document 47-6   Filed 12/28/20   Page 7 of 7 PageID #: 951\n15. Brandonโs aunt did not wear her mask almost the entire time we were in our room.\nA couple of minutes after Brandon was pronounced dead, Brandonโs aunt, spiritual advisor and I \nwere escorted to the van by the same people and were taken back to Sheriffโs departmentโs parking \nlot. On the ride to the Sheriffโs department, his aunt sobbed most of the time and was not wearing \na mask. None of the BOP employees requested she put her mask on. \n16. There were no windows that opened to the outside in any of the rooms that I was in\nthroughout the process. \n17. Prior to leaving for Terre Haute, I quarantined myself for ten days. I drove my car\nand parked in the garage next to the airport terminal so I did not have to take a shuttle. I socially \ndistanced myself from others in the airport while waiting to board my plane. While boarding the \nplane, other passengers were not socially distanced and I had to wait right next to some of the \npassengers on the plane before I could move forward. Exiting the airplane was even worse for \nsocial distancing. The passengers all stood up next to each other to exit the plan. I got my rental \ncar and drove to my hotel. \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \nDated:   12/17/2020 By:   _____________________________________ \n Charles P.
