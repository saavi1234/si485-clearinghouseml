Hartford  Housing  Authority,  Civil  Action  No. \n3: 97CV02019  (JBA),  in  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the \nDistrict  of  Connecticut  (\"Pitt  v.  Hartford  Housing  Authority\") \nclaiming  denial  of  adequate  housing  choices  to  tenants  relocated \nunder Section 8  of the United States Housing Act  (\"Section 8\")  from \nthe  former  Charter Oak  Terrace  (COT)  public housing  project;  and \nWhereas,  defendant  Hartford  Housing  Authority  (HHA)  has  denied \nplaintiffs'  claims;  and \n• \nWhereas,  this Agreement  shall  not  be  construed  to  be  an  admission \nby  HHA  of  any  wrongdoing;  and \nWhereas,  both  sides  share the goal  of providing quality housing  in \na  variety of  neighborhoods  and  communities  to former  COT  Section  8 \ntenants  currently  living in Hartford,  and  both sides wish to avoid \nthe expense of further litigation in order to focus resources on the \nhousing  needs  of  former  C~T Section  8  tenants  currently  living  in \nHartford; \n\n- 2  -\nNow,  therefore,  the  parties  agree  to  the  following  settlement  of \nthis action: \nCHARTER  OAK  TERRACE  MOBILITY  PROGRAM \n1.  With  the financial assistance of the United States Department \nof Housing and Urban Development  ( \"HUD\") ,  HHA will create a  new \"COT \nmobility  program\"  for  the  primary  benefit of  former  COT  Section  8 \ntenants  (tenants relocated from COT with Section 8 certificates) who \nare currently living in Hartford,  to be administered by the Housing \nEducation Resource  Center  (HERC),  which  is currently administering \nthe HUD  Regional Housing Opportunity Counselling Program  (ROC).  The \nnew  COT  mobility  program will  assist  former  COT  Section  8  tenants \ncurrently living in Hartford in obtaining new housing opportunities, \nand  will  provide  appropriate  followup  services,  as  set  out  below. \nThe  new  program  may  be  administered  by  existing  HERC  staff,  but \nshall  be  independently  funded  and  shall  not  draw  from  or  divert \nexisting  ROC  funds.  The  primary  purposes  of  the  COT  mobllity \nprogram  will  be  to  provide  for  three  years  a  range  of  housing \n(t \nchoices  throughout  the  Hartford  metropolitan  area  to  former  COT \nSection  8  tenants  currently  living  in  Hartford  and  to  remedy  any \nsubstandard housing in which they may  be living.  Former COT  Section \n8  tenants currently living in the Hartford area,  but not within the \nCity  of  Hartford,  will  be  served  by  the  HUD  Regional  Housing \nOpportunity Counselling Program to the extent  they are  eligibleo \n... \n\n. \n;  ~ \n- 3  -\n2.  The  COT  mobility  program  will  be  established  as  follows, \nconsistent with the other terms  and  conditions of this Agreement: \na.  The  COT  mobility  program  shall  operate  for  a  period  of \nthree years from the time that staff selection and training is \ncompleted. \nb.  The  program will hire two  additional  full-time  staff to \nperform  the  functions  set out  in this Agreement.  This  staff \nwill be  new HERC  staff dedicated to the COT  mobility program. \nEvery  effort will  be made  to  recruit  bilingual  staff,  and  at \nleast  one  of  the  new  staff must  be  bilingual  in  Spanish  and \nEnglish. \nc.  COT  mobility program staff will be  selected by HERC  with \ninput  and  approval  from  the  committee  described  in  !  13, \nbelow.  The  COT  mobility  program  staff  positions  will  be \nfilled within ninety days  after approval  by  the United  States \nDistrict Court  of this Agreement. \nd.  Plaintiffs'  counsel  (the  Connecticut  Civil  Liberties \nUnion Foundation,  Greater Hartford Legal Assistance,  Inc.,  and \n• \nthe Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund)  or their designee will be \npermitted to  assist HERC  staff  in training the  new  staff. \ne.  The  program  may  also  utilize  existing  HERC  landlord \nrecruitment staff,  supervisors and  clerical support and other \nresources;  however,  sufficient  funding  will  be  ~rovided to \nsupport  the  portion  of  HERC's  staff  work  allocated  to  COT \nmobility program  reltted functions. \n\n•I \n- 4  -\nf.  Eligibility restrictions set out in the ROC  Program will \nnot apply to the COT  mobility program. \ng.  During  the period  that the  COT  mobility  program  remains \navailable,  any former COT  Section 8  tenant currently living in \nHartford may  take advantage of the program.  A  prior decision \nnot  to  participate  will  not  disqualify  such  a  tenant  from \nparticipating. \nh.  The  COT  mobility program  will  assist  former  COT  Section \n8  tenants  currently  living  in Hartford  in moving  to  suburban \ntowns  within  the  greater  Hartford  region  if  they  so  choose, \nand  will  also  assist  former  COT  Section  8  tenants  living  in \nHartford  in  moving  to  other  locations  within  Hartford  as  a \nremedy  for  identified Housing Quality Standard violations,  as \nset out  in !12. \ni.  The COT  mobility program will also be available to assist \nformer  COT  Section 8  tenants  who  live in Hartford and  seek to \nmove  within the city to a  neighborhood where  no more  than 10% \nof  the population had  incomes  below  the  poverty  level  at the \n~ \ntime  of  the 1990  census. \nj.  After the expiration of the COT  mobility program,  the HHA \nROC  Program will be  available to former  COT  Section 8  tenants \ncurrently living in Hartford to the extent they are eligible. \nk.  The  COT  mobility  program will  be  funded  by  HF~ but will \nbe  managed  by  HERC,  subject  to  the  terms  set  out  in  this \nAgreement. \n\n,. \n- 5  -\n3.  The  responsibilities  of  COT  mobility  program  staff  will \ninclude,  but  are  not  limited  to,  regular  communication  and  in \nperson  visits,  where  feasible,  with  all  former  COT  tenants  with \nSection  8  certificates  currently  living  in  Hartford,  initial \nassessment  of  their  housing  conditions,  identification  of \nreplacement suburban apartments and recruitment of new  landlords to \nthe program,  assisting with applications,  credit checks,  community \ntours,  transportation  of  clients  to  apply  for  housing,  followup \nvisits  and  regular  phone  contacts  with  families  placed  under  the \nprogram,  and  other  selected  services  set  out  in  the  Regional \nOpportunity Counselling Program Final Plan  (see Attachment A).  Such \nmobility services will be  provided to all eligible families  at the \ndiscretion of HERC  staff and  as  necessary to provide assistance to \neligible families to gain access to housing opportunities throughout \nthe metropolitan  area. \n4.  The  COT  mobility program  shall  be  subject  to  the  performance \ngoals  set out  in Attachment A. \nRELATED  MOBILITY  SERVICES \n5.  The COT mobility program will provide moving-related assistance \nto  or  for  the  benefit  of  former  COT  Section  8  tenants  currently \nliving in Hartford,  including provision or use of movers,  vehicles, \nand  transportation.  The  COT  mobility program will  also provide to \nor for  the benefit of such tenants certain financial  assistance to \nbe  used to pay  a  portion of  other expenses  relating to their move, \n\n; \n- 6  -\nincluding  but  not  limited  to  loans  or  grants  for  utility \nconnections,  transportation  assistance,  and  loans  to  tenants  for \nsecurity  deposits  or  security  deposit  payments  to  landlords \nnecessary to permit access to a  suburban unit.  The  amount and form \nof such financial or non-financial assistance will not be determined \nin  accordance  with  the  Uniform  Relocation  Act,  as  was  done  in \nconnection with the original move from COT,  but rather be determined \nby HERC  staff in light of the particular circumstances of each such \ntenant  and  to  further  the  purposes  of  this  agreement.  Former  COT \nSection 8  tenants  currently living  in Hartford who  seek to move  in \naccordance with Section 8  and !  12,  because of identified violations \nin  their  units  of  Housing  Quality  Standards  which  have  not  been \ncorrected by  their landlords or which  seriously  interfere with the \ntenant's use  and  enjoyment  of the unit,  may  receive moving  related \nassistance  regardless  of  the  destination of  their move. \n6.  HHA  or HERC will take all necessary steps to secure fair market \nrent  exceptions,  in  accordance  with  HUD  regulations  and  where \nnecessary  to  enable  former  COT  Section  8  tenants  currently  living \nin Hartford  to obtain housing  in suburban  towns. \nFUNDING \n7.  To  fund  the  COT  mobility  program  and  settle Pitt v.  Hartford \nHousing  Authority,  HUD  has  awarded  $300,000  in  addit.ional,  new \nfunds.  To  supplement  this award,  HHA  has  agreed  to  reprogram,  and \n.  + \nhas  receJ.ved  approval  from  HUD  to  reprogram,  $168,000  in  funds \n\n... \n- 7  -\ncurrently allocated to the Charter Oak Terrace revitalization funds \nfor  the  A  B  c  Sections  (Line  Item  1460  Dwelling  Construction) • \nThus,  the  COT  mobility  program  will  be  funded  in  the  amount  of \n$468,000. \n8.  In  the  event  that  HERC  and  the  Committee  described  in  !  13 \nbelow  determine  that  the  need  for  relocation  services  during  the \nthree-year term of the COT  mobility program exceeds funded amounts, \nHHA  will  submit  additional  requests  for  HUD  funding. \n\"  HOUSING  REINSPECTION  AND  REMEDIATION \nI \n9.  During initial interviews by HERC  staff, an initial survey will \nbe made  of housing  conditions  in the units  of  former  COT  Section  8 \ntenants  currently  living  in  Hartford.  HERC  staff  will  receive \ntraining in assessing HUD  Housing Quality Standards but will not be \nresponsible  for  conducting a  full  inspection. \n10.  For  such  tenants  who  express  concerns  regarding  physical \nconditions  in  their  unit,  the  mobility  staff  will  explain  the \noptions  available  to the tenant . \n• \n11.  Such  a  tenant  may  request  an  inspection  or  HERC  staff  may \ntransmit  the  request  to  HHA,  at  the  tenants'  request.  If  a \nreinspection  in accordance with normal  procedures  reveals the unit \nto  be  in  violation  of  HUD  Housing  Quality  Standards  (\"HQS\"},  HHA \nshall undertake necessary steps to remediate the problem,  consistent \nwith  HUD  regulations,  including  but  not  limited  to:  a}  notice  to \nthe  landlord directing tha~ the problem  be  remediated  and  b)  rent \n\n.... \n- 8  -\nabatement.  Where  appropriate,  landlords  will  also  be  notified of \nhousing  improvement grants and  loans  available through the City of \nHartford. \n12.  Any  tenant  with  identified  HQS  violations  that  cannot  be \nreasonably  remedied  or  that  seriously  interfere with  the  tenants' \nuse and enjoyment of the unit shall be permitted to move  to another \nunit,  consistent with HUD  regulations.  For tenants who do not wish \nto move,  HHA  (and,  if appropriate,  the  COT  mobility  program)  will \ntake  all  steps  at  its disposal  to  achieve  remediation  of  reported \nviolations,  so as  to permit the tenant to remain in place.  If such \nremediation cannot be reasonably accomplished,  the tenant will have \nto move,  in  accordance with  Section  8  regulations. \nMONITORING  AND  ENFORCEMENT \n13.  The  progress  of  the  COT  mobility  program  will  be  formally \nreviewed  every  three  months  by  a  committee  of  three  persons  (the \n\"Committee\")  consisting  of  one  representative  of  plaintiffs' \ncounsel,  one  HHA  staff  representative,  and  one  representative  or \norganization to be selected by agreement between plaintiffs' counsel \nand  defendant's  counsel.  Each  of  these  three  parties  shall \ndesignate  a  single  individual to regularly serve on  the Committee. \nWith  the  consent  of  all  members,  the  Committee  may  recommend \nmodifications  in  program  design  or  an  increase  in  prog~am funding \nif the  need  exceeds  staffing or  other  resources  of  the  program. \n+ \n\n- 9  -\n14.  Under  the  terms  of  its  contract,  HERC  will  provide  to  the \nmembers  of the Committee regular quarterly reports  on  the progress \nof the  COT  mobility program.  These  reports may  be  in the same \nformat  as the reports required under  the ROC  program.  The members \nof the Committee may also request reasonable additional information. \n15.  At any Committee meeting,  any member  of the Committee shall be \npermitted to speak with any COT  mobility program staff person about \nthe  needs  of  individual  clients  or  about  the  functioning  of  the \nprogram in general,  so  long as such communications do not interfere \nwith  the  program.  HHA  shall  not  interfere  with  or  take  steps  to \nprevent contacts between plaintiffs' counsel and HERC  staff outside \nof  such  meetings.  Plaintiffs'  counsel  shall  not  be  permitted  to \nspeak  with  HHA  Section  8  staff  regarding  implementation  of  the \nprogram without prior permission of  HHA  counsel. \n16.  Subject to the requirements  of the Freedom  of  Information Act \n(\"FOIA\"),  plaintiffs'  counsel  shall have  full reasonable  access  to \nall HHA  files  of  former  COT  Section  8  tenants,  to  current address \nlists of  former  COT  tenants,  and.,   to any  HHA  program  files relating \nto any aspect of this Agreement or its implementation,  and HHA  will \nprovide  plaintiffs'  counsel  with  a  reasonable  number  of  copies  of \nsuch documents  in accordance with the FOIA.1  Plaintiffs shall have \nThe  parties  agree  that  tenant  names,  addresses,  phone \nnumbers,  and  individual  teqant  files  are  available  under  FOIA, \nsubject to redaction of income,  medical,  or social security number \ninformation. \n\n:  ·.' \n- 10  -\nsimilar access  to any HERC  program files relating to any  aspect of \nthis Agreement  or  its implementation. \n17.  Plaintiffs may  designate  a  consultant,  at their  own  expense, \nto  conduct  periodic  reviews  of  program  operations.  HERC  and  HHA \nwill  cooperate  with  such  reviews,  and  any  reports  will  be  shared \nwith the Committee,  HERC  and  HHA. \n18.  If  plaintiffs  or  any  former  COT  tenant  with  a  Section  8 \ncertificate  allege  that  the  COT  mobility  program  is  not  being \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  this  Agreement,  they  may  bring  an \naction in court to specifically enforce the terms of this Agreement. \n19.  Prior to  any  enforcement  action brought pursuant to  ~ 18,  any \nclaim must  first be  brought  to  attention  of  the  Committee  set out \nin  !  13.  The  parties  agree  that  this  procedure  should  be  deemed \njurisdictional in nature and  failure  to comply  with this procedure \nshall be grounds  for dismissal of any  such action on the grounds of \nripeness or failure to exhaust remedies  or any  similar grounds.  If \nthe  Committee  is  unable  to  resolve  the  issue  by  consertsus., \nplaintiffs may  seek  the  opinion  of  the  HUD  regional  counsel  prior \nto brinqing  any  enforcement  action. \nGENERAL  PROVISIONS \n20.  This  Agreement  shall  be  implemented  as  soon  as  reasonably \npracticable,  beginning no later than specified in ~ 2 (c), .consistent \nwith  the  benchmarks  referenced  in Attachment  A. \ni,,  \n\n- 11  -\n21.  This  Agreement  and  the  underlying  case  of  Pitt  v.  Hartford \nHousing  Authority  do  not  encompass  relocation  of  tenants  from  HHA \ndevelopments  other than Charter Oak  Terrace. \n22.  The  provisions  of  this  Agreement  will  be  incorporated  in  a \ncontract with HERC.  The proposed contract between HHA  and HERC  will \nbe  submitted  to the Committee  for  review  and  approval. \n2 3 •  This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the \nparties,  and  the terms  of  this Agreement  are  contractual  and  not  a \nmere  recital. \n24.  Plaintiffs  agree  to  move  to  withdraw  their  motion  for  class \ncertification  and  to  move  to  eliminate  class  allegations  from  the \ncomplaint,  and  the  parties  agree  that the  members  of  the putative \nclass are not bound by any release of liability signed by individual \nplaintiffs.  In furtherance of the motion to withdraw class claims, \ndefendant  agrees  to  submit  an  affidavit  stating  that  defendant's \nduties under  the Agreement  will  apply to all former  COT  tenants  as \nspecified herein. \n.. \nPLAINTIFFS'  ATTORNEYS'  FEES  AND  EXPENSES \n25.
