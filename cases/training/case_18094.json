IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED, as follows: The Court hereby confirms certification of the following Settlement Class pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3): All persons who were arrested, or arrested and subjected to force, by NYPD officers during the \"George Floyd protests\" at the dates and locations in paragraph 32 of the Amended Stipulation of Settlement and allege any of the Released Claims described in paragraph 31 of the Amended Stipulation of Settlement, excluding (a) individuals who have settled claims with New York City Comptroller's Office arising out of the events at the 18 protest locations in the chart at paragraph 32; (b) individuals who brought lawsuits against the City and/or individual members of NYPD arising out of the events at the 18 protest locations in the chart at paragraph 32, and whose claims were settled, dismissed or otherwise disposed; and as further set forth in this Order.The proposed Settlement is hereby fully and finally approved as fair, reasonable, and adequate. The release of claims set forth at Paragraphs 79-83 of the Amended Stipulation of Settlement is expressly incorporated herein in all respects. As of the Effective Date of Payment (as defined in the Amended Stipulation of Settlement), and without modifying or limiting the full language of the release provisions in the Amended Stipulation of Settlement, the release of claims set forth in the Amended Stipulation of Settlement shall be given full force and effect as to all Released Parties. Pursuant to Paragraph 40 of the Amended Stipulation of Settlement, each eligible Class Member will be paid $9,500.00 (Nine Thousand Five Hundred Dollars). The Class Administrator has calculated the total awards payout to be approximately $9,532,100.00 (\"Total Class Settlement Amount\"). The City, in consultation with the Claims Administrator, shall make best good faith estimates of the maximum amount that shall be deducted from any awards due to Department of Finance liens and for New York child support liens. If any additional amount is determined to be owed to the City due to these liens, the Claims Administrator shall return that amount to the City. The City shall pay any remaining administrative cost to Rust Consulting up to the agreed-upon amount of $48,535. The Court finds that the requested service awards of $9,950.00 each to Class Representatives David Jaklevic, Alexandra de Mucha Pino, Oscar Rios, Sabrina Zurkuhlen, and Maria Salazar, totaling $49,750 (Forty-nine Thousand, Seven Hundred and Fifty Dollars), to be paid in addition to the class settlement awards owed to them, are reasonable under the circumstances. These service awards shall be paid directly by the City to the Named Plaintiffs consistent with the applicable provisions of the Amended Stipulation of Settlement. Within 90 days after the Court order and receipt of all necessary paperwork, the City will pay the Class Representatives the service awards ordered. The Class Representatives shall execute and deliver to Defendants' Counsel all documents necessary to effect such payments to them, including, without limitation, General Releases, Affidavit of Status of Liens, and W-9s. The Court finds that the Individual Settlements of $21,500.00 (Twenty-one thousand five hundred dollars) each to non-Class Representative Plaintiffs Adama Sow, Dara Pluchino, and Savatri Durkee which reflects the settlement award they would have received under Samira Sierra, et al. v. City of New York, et al., 20-CV-10291, 20 CV-10521 (CM)(GWG) are reasonable under the circumstances. The Court finds that the Individual Settlement of $41,400.00 (Forty-one thousand four hundred dollars) to nonClass Representative Plaintiff Matthew Bredder which includes the class action settlement award under Samira Sierra, et al. v. City of New York, et al., 20-CV-1029I, 20 CV-10521 (CM)(GWG) as well as the settlement for Matthew Bredder v. City of New York, 22-CV- 04293 (VSB) is reasonable under the circumstances. The Court finds that the Individual Settlement of $30,000.00 (Thirty thousand dollars) to non-Class Representative Plaintiff Barbara Ross is reasonable under the circumstances. These settlements shall be paid directly by the City to the Plaintiffs named in this paragraph consistent with the applicable provisions of the Amended Stipulation of Settlement. Within 90 days after the Court order and receipt of all necessary paperwork, the City will pay the Plaintiffs named in this paragraph the amounts ordered. The non-Class Representatives shall execute and deliver to Defendants' Counsel all documents necessary to effect such payments to them, including, without limitation, General Releases, Affidavits of Status of Liens, and W-9s. The Court finds that the requested negotiated payment of $5,850,000.00 in attorneys' fees and expenses to Class Counsel for work performed through June 15, 2023 (the date listed on the Class Notice), is reasonable. Within 90 days after a Court order concerning attorneys' fees and costs, or any appeal thereof, and receipt of all necessary paperwork, the City will make payments to Class Counsel in the total sum of $5,850,000. Class Counsel shall execute and deliver to Defendants' Counsel all documents necessary to effect such payments to them, including, without limitation, General Releases and W-9s. With respect to Class Counsel's fees and costs incurred after June 15, 2023 only, the Parties will engage in good faith negotiations in an effort to reach an agreement. Should the Parties not reach a negotiated agreement, Class Counsel will make an application for an award of such attorneys' fees and costs that are fair, reasonable, and appropriate; the Court will retain jurisdiction over such an application and to order and approve an award of such attorneys' fees and costs; and the entry of this Order shall not release any remaining claim Class Counsel will seek to make for such attorneys' fees and costs after June 15, 2023. The Court has jurisdiction to enter this Order. Without in any way affecting the finality of this Order or the judgment, the Court expressly retains exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the Settlement, the Parties to the Settlement, Class Members, and anyone else who appeared before this Court for all matters relating to the Settlement, including approving and awarding Class Counsel's fees and costs incurred after June 15, 2023, the implementation and enforcement of the terms of the Settlement and of this Order and the judgment, and for any other reasonably necessary purpose. Plaintiffs' claims against the individual Defendants are volU11tarily dismissed, with prejudice, and the City remains a party to the Action as the settling Defendant. Plaintiffs' injunctive/declarato1y reliefs claims against All Defendants are voluntarily dismissed with prejudice. All claims brought by Plaintiffs Adama Sow, Dara Pluchino, Savatri Durkee, Barbara Rossand and Matthew Bredder are dismissed, with prejudice, as set forth in the Amended Stipulation of Settlement. Plaintiff Matthew Bredder's action under Matthew Bredder v. City of New York, 22-CV- 04293 (VSB) is voluntarily dismissed, with prejudice. As pait of the Amended Stipulation of Settlement, any other locations from the Sow Complaint and Amended Complaint that was not identified in the 18 locations listed in paragraph 32, are hereby withdrawn and dismissed with prejudiced. The claims asserted in this Action are hereby dismissed with prejudice with the exception of Class Counsel's fees and costs incurred after June 15, 2023. The Court will separately enter judgment in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58. (Signed by Judge Colleen McMahon on 2/22/24) (yv) (Entered: 02/22/2024)"

          "description": "ORDER, I have been advised by Judge Gorenstein that, while settlement talks continue, we are in full bore litigation mode. Judge Gorenstein also advises me that nearly all of the plaintiffs have been deposed, which means it is time for me to reset the schedule for moving for class certification. Any motions for class certification must be filed by March 31, 2023. Opposition to motions for class certification must be filed by May 10, 2023. I am allowing extra time to accommodate the religious holidays that occur in April. Reply briefs, if any, are due on May 31, 2023. I am not prepared to alter this schedule. It is much postponed from the original schedule I set. A decision on class certification will streamline the case in one way or another, and I intend to make that decision next summer. I also will not authorize extension of the existing discovery deadlines, which, as I understand it, are July 14 for fact discovery and November 3 for expert discovery. Judge Gorenstein is keeping me posted on the endless discovery disputes that have occurred thus far; rest assured that I am prepared to enter orders precluding parties from proving up key points if I conclude that they have been intransigent in producing relevant and material discovery. I am not yet ready to set a briefing schedule for summary judgment motions - I will do that when the class certification issue has been decided - but anyone who wants to move for summary judgment can expect to be on an expedited briefing schedule. (Expert Discovery due by 11/3/2023., Fact Discovery due by 7/14/2023., Motions due by 3/31/2023., Replies due by 5/31/2023., Responses due by 5/10/2023) (Signed by Judge Colleen McMahon on 2/10/2023) Filed In Associated Cases: 1:20-cv-08924-CM et al.BY ECF TO ALL COUNSEL (kv) (Entered: 02/10/2023)"

Do I think this agreement could have been drafted more precisely to deal with the possibility of abuse? I certainly do. Do I think the agreement is ambiguous, notwithstanding the fact that it could have been better drafted? No, I do not. The plain language in the opening of Section VI makes it abundantly clear that the parties were doing nothing more than incorporating previously-defined terms into a section of the agreement - the one and only section of the agreement - that extended beyond FAAs. The Plaintiffs' motion is GRANTED. The City should engage with the Plaintiffs to be sure that protocols are drafted that incorporate procedures to be used in connection with press arrests during non-FAA situations. The Clerk of Court is directed to remove the motion at Docket Nos. 1193 (20 Civ. 8924 )(In re NYC Policing) and 167 (21 Civ. 66l0)(Gray) from the court's list of open motions. As the motion has also been filed under the numbers of the other consolidated cases -- in violation of the court's previous order that motions NOT be filed under all case numbers - I need to ask the Clerk to remove all of the following additional motions from the court's list of open motions: Docket 224 in 20 Civ. 10291 (Sierra); Docket 164 in 20 Civ. 10541 (Wood); Docket 187 in 21 Civ. 322 (People of the State of New York); Docket 205 in 21 Civ. 533 (Sow); Docket 112 in 21 Civ. 1904 (Yates) ; Docket 105 in 21 Civ. 2548 (Rolon). The consent letter motions asking for sealing in connection with this motion ( one motion per case) are all GRANTED. The Clerk is thus also ordered to remove the following motions from my docket: Docket 1192 in 20 civ 8924 (In re NYC Policing); Docket 223 in 20 Civ. 10291 (Sierra); Docket 161 in 20 Civ. 10541 (Wood) ; Docket 186 in 21 Civ. 322 (People of the State of New York); Docket 204 in 21 Civ. 533 (Sow); Docket 111 in 21 Civ. 1904 (Yates); Docket 104 in 21 Civ. 2548 (Rolon). There is no corresponding motion on the docket in Gray. However, the matter filed under seal is limited to parol evidence about settlement discussions, which the court did not consider in reaching its conclusion. As a result, there is absolutely nothing in this opinion that should be sealed, and I will file the complaint on the public docket immediately. Finally all motions seeking to remove the names of various former Corporation Counsel was granted in the main case (In re NYC Policing) some time ago. However, it seems that identical motions were filed on all dockets. They are GRANTED. Therefore, the clerk should remove the following motions from the court's list of open motions: Docket 221 in 20 Civ. 10291 (Sierra); Docket 161 in 20 Civ. 10541 (Wood); Docket 184 in 21 Civ. 322 (People of the State of New York); Docket 202 in 21 Civ. 533 (Sow); Docket 109 in 21 Civ. 1904 (Yates); Docket 102 in 21Civ. 2548 (Rolon); and Docket 164 in 21 Civ. 6610 (Gray). I beg the parties not to fi le under all docket numbers unless it is absolutely necessary. As long as you file under 20 Civ. 8924 any decision will be binding in all the consolidated cases.

Do I think this agreement could have been drafted more precisely to deal with the possibility of abuse? I certainly do. Do I think the agreement is ambiguous, notwithstanding the fact that it could have been better drafted? No, I do not. The plain language in the opening of Section VI makes it abundantly clear that the parties were doing nothing more than incorporating previously-defined terms into a section of the agreement - the one and only section of the agreement - that extended beyond FAAs. The Plaintiffs' motion is GRANTED. The City should engage with the Plaintiffs to be sure that protocols are drafted that incorporate procedures to be used in connection with press arrests during non-FAA situations. The Clerk of Court is directed to remove the motion at Docket Nos. 1193 (20 Civ. 8924 )(In re NYC Policing) and 167 (21 Civ. 66l0)(Gray) from the court's list of open motions. As the motion has also been filed under the numbers of the other consolidated cases -- in violation of the court's previous order that motions NOT be filed under all case numbers - I need to ask the Clerk to remove all of the following additional motions from the court's list of open motions: Docket 224 in 20 Civ. 10291 (Sierra); Docket 164 in 20 Civ. 10541 (Wood); Docket 187 in 21 Civ. 322 (People of the State of New York); Docket 205 in 21 Civ. 533 (Sow); Docket 112 in 21 Civ. 1904 (Yates) ; Docket 105 in 21 Civ. 2548 (Rolon). The consent letter motions asking for sealing in connection with this motion ( one motion per case) are all GRANTED. The Clerk is thus also ordered to remove the following motions from my docket: Docket 1192 in 20 civ 8924 (In re NYC Policing); Docket 223 in 20 Civ. 10291 (Sierra); Docket 161 in 20 Civ. 10541 (Wood) ; Docket 186 in 21 Civ. 322 (People of the State of New York); Docket 204 in 21 Civ. 533 (Sow); Docket 111 in 21 Civ. 1904 (Yates); Docket 104 in 21 Civ. 2548 (Rolon). There is no corresponding motion on the docket in Gray. However, the matter filed under seal is limited to parol evidence about settlement discussions, which the court did not consider in reaching its conclusion. As a result, there is absolutely nothing in this opinion that should be sealed, and I will file the complaint on the public docket immediately. Finally all motions seeking to remove the names of various former Corporation Counsel was granted in the main case (In re NYC Policing) some time ago. However, it seems that identical motions were filed on all dockets. They are GRANTED. Therefore, the clerk should remove the following motions from the court's list of open motions: Docket 221 in 20 Civ. 10291 (Sierra); Docket 161 in 20 Civ. 10541 (Wood); Docket 184 in 21 Civ. 322 (People of the State of New York); Docket 202 in 21 Civ. 533 (Sow); Docket 109 in 21 Civ. 1904 (Yates); Docket 102 in 21Civ. 2548 (Rolon); and Docket 164 in 21 Civ. 6610 (Gray). I beg the parties not to file under all docket numbers unless it is absolutely necessary. As long as you file under 20 Civ. 8924 any decision will be binding in all the consolidated cases.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED, as   follows: The Court hereby confirms  certification of the following Settlement Class pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3):  All persons who were arrested, or arrested and subjected to force, by NYPD officers during the  \"George Floyd protests\" at the dates and  locations in paragraph 32 of the Amended Stipulation  of Settlement and allege any of the Released Claims described in paragraph 31 of the Amended  Stipulation of Settlement, excluding (a) individuals who have settled claims with New York City  Compt roller's Office arising out of the events at the 18 protest locations in the chart at  paragraph 32; (b) individuals who brought lawsuits against the City and/or individual members of  NYPD arising out of the events at the 18 protest locations i n the chart at paragraph 32, and  whose claims were settled, dismissed or otherwise disposed; and (c) all persons charged with trespassing  (New York State Penal Law(\"NYS P.L.\") § 140), destruction of public property (NYS P.L. § 1 45),  assaulting an officer (NYS P.L. § 120.08), criminal possession of a weapon (NYS P.L. § 265),  arson (NYS P.L. § 150), or burglary (NYS P.L. § 140) where the person was arrested at the  location of the alleged burglary; and ( d) if there is video or other objective evidence of them clearly demonstrating that a class member, through physical conduct, intentionally obstructed, impaired, or prevented a Member of Service's ability to lawfully arrest, or attempt to lawful ly arrest, another individual. The proposed Settlement is hereby fully and finally approved as fair, reasonable, and adequate. The Parties and their counsel are directed to implement and consummate the Amended Stipulation of Settlement according to i ts  terms and conditions. The release of claims set forth at Paragraphs 79-83 of the Amended  Stipulation of Settlement is expressly incorporated herein in all respects. As  of the Effective Date of Payment (as defined in the Amended Stipulation of S ettlement), and without  modifying or limiting the full language of the release provisions in the Amended  Stipulation of Settlement, the release of claims set forth in the Amended Stipulation of Settlement shall be  given full force and effect as to  all Released Parties. Pursuant to Paragraph 40 of the Amended Stipulation of Settlement, each eligible Class Member will be paid $9,950.00  (Nine Thousand Nine Hundred and Fifty Dollars).  The Class Administrator has calculated the total awards  payout to be  approximately $9,532,100.00 (\"Total Class Settlement Amount\"). The City, in consultation with  the Claims Administrator, shall make best good faith estimates of the maximum amount that  shall be deducted from any awards  due to Department of Finance liens and for New York child  support liens. If any additional amount is determined to be owed to the City due to these liens, the  Claims Administrator shall return that amount to the City. Publication costs have already  been paid  to Rust Consulting by the City. The City shall pay any remaining administrative  cost to Rust Consulting up to the agreed-upon amount of $48,535.  Service Awards.

The Class Representatives shall  execute and deliver to Defendants' Counsel all documents necessary to effect such payme nts to them,  including, without limitation, General Releases, Affidavit of Status of Liens, and W-9s.  The Court finds that the Individual Settlements of $21,500.00 (Twenty-one thousand five hundred dollars) each to  non-Class Representative Pl aintiffs Adama Sow, Dara Pluchino, and Savatri Durkee which  reflects the settlement award they would have received under Samira Sierra, et al. v. City of  New York, et al., 20-CV-10291, 20 CV-10521 (CM)(GWG) are reasonable under the circumstances. T he  Court finds that the Individual Settlement of $41,400.00 (Forty-one thousand four hundred  dollars) to non-Class Representative Plaintiff Matthew Bredder which includes the class action  settlement award under Samira Sierra, et al. v.

The Court finds that the Individual  Settlement of $30,000.00 ( Thirty thousand dollars) to non-Class Representative Plaintiff Barbara Ross is  reasonable under the circumstances. These settlements shall be paid directly by the City to the  Plaintiffs named in this paragraph consistent with the applicable provisi ons of the Amended  Stipulation of Settlement. Within 90 days after the Court order and receipt of all necessary paperwork, the  City will pay the  Plaintiffs named in this paragraph the amounts ordered. The  non-Class Representatives shall execute a nd deliver to Defendants' Counsel all documents necessary to effect  such payments to them, including, without limitation, General Releases, Affidavits of Status of  Liens, and W-9s.  Attorneys' Fees and Costs. The Court finds that the requ ested negotiated  payment of $5,850,000.00 in attorneys' fees and expenses to Class Counsel for work  performed through June 15, 2023 (the date listed on the Class Notice), is reasonable. This amount  shall be paid by the City in a combinat ion of payments directly to Class Counsel and/or the funding  of annuities to provide future periodic payments consistent with the applicable provisions of  the Amended Settlement Agreement. Within 90 days after a Court order concerning attorneys 9;  fees and costs, or any appeal thereof, and receipt of all necessary paperwork, the City will make  payments to Class Counsel, including the annuity premium to the applicable life insurance or  assignment company, in the total sum of  $5,850, 000. Class Counsel shall execute and deliver to  Defendants' Counsel all documents necessary to effect such payments to them, including, without  limitation, General Releases and W-9s. The Court has jurisdiction to enter this Order. Without in a ny way affecting the finality of this Order or the judgment, the  Court expressly retains exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the Settlement, the Parties to the  Settlement, Class Members, and anyone else who appeared before this Court for all  matters relating  to the Settlement, including approving and awarding Class Counsels fees and costs incurred after  June 15, 2023, the implementation and enforcement of the terms of the Settlement and of this Order  and the judgment, and for any oth er reasonably necessary purpose.

City of New York, 21 Civ. 322; Sow v. City of New York, 21 Civ. 533. Counsel: I now have four matters on my docket relating to the conduct of the NYPD in connection with various demonstrations that occurred in New York City during 2020, that are connected to the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement and the deaths of George Floyd and other individuals at the hands of law enforcement officials in other jurisdictions. They are Payne v. DiBlasio, 20 Civ. 8924, Wood v. City of New York, 20 Civ. 10541, People v. City of New York, 21 Civ. 322, Sow v. City of New York, 21 Civ. 533. I preliminarily consolidated these cases for pre-trial purposes. The defendants have moved to deconsolidate Payne and Wood, and the plaintiffs in Payne object to consolidation of their action with the Attorney General's suit, though they do not object to coordinated discovery and joint motion practice on the common issues of law and fact regarding policies and practices of the NYPD that undergird all four of these lawsuits. I note that Wood, People and Sow were all filed as \"related cases\" to Payne - and so they are, whether they end up being tried together or not - so I anticipate that most pre-trial matters, and certainly discovery, will be consolidated. I want to conference all four cases initially, so I can get my head around how to manage these cases and start them moving. I want that conference to take place in person - \"in person\" meaning that no more than two attorneys for each plaintiff and no more than four attorneys for the defendants may be present in my courtroom, masked and socially distanced, at an on-the-record conference. We cannot possibly accommodate all the members of the public who would want to be present at this conference, even with an overflow courtroom; we will provide a call in number for maximum public access. At present, as you know, we are not holding in person proceedings in the federal courthouses, so the February 5 date that is currently on your calendars will not work. I would like to schedule this proceeding for the week of February 16-17-18-19. As to the exact date, I would prefer to suit the convenience of counsel, so please confer and be in touch with my deputy clerk, Mariela de Jesus, Mariela_DeJesus@nysd.uscourts.gov with suggested dates and times during that week. You should be prepared to discuss anticipated motions, coordinated discovery and the reasons why these cases should or should not be consolidated. If each plaintiff and the defendants would file a letter of no more than three pages summarizing your positions at last five days prior to the conference; you can flesh them out fully at the conference. There really is no need to make a lot of formal procedural motions; I would rather hear you outline your positions and rule from the bench. Magistrate Judge Gorenstein is the assigned MJ on these cases. I will be inviting him to participate at this conference as well.

    "summary": "<p>Ten New York residents, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, brought this class action against the City of New York and the New York City Police Department (&ldquo;NYPD&rdquo;) on January 21, 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs sued under 42 U.S.C &sect; 1983, alleging excessive force and unlawful seizure in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments; First Amendment violations, including retaliation for the exercise of First Amendment rights; and violations of the plaintiffs&rsquo; due process and equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs also alleged municipal liability on the part of the City of New York. Represented by private counsel, the complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>The complaint alleged that NYPD officers, with the approval of their supervisors, regularly engaged in the practice of using excessive force against and falsely arresting peaceful protesters during the widespread racial justice protests that took place in the summer of 2020. The complaint specifically alleged that the officers responded to the plaintiffs&rsquo; peaceful participation in the protests with violence, such as striking plaintiffs repeatedly with batons, fists, and bicycles; tackling plaintiffs to the ground and pinning them with their bodies; indiscriminately pepper spraying plaintiffs; tightly zip-tying or handcuffing plaintiffs&rsquo; wrists for extended periods of time, causing significant pain; and kettling plaintiffs to prevent their compliance with curfew. According to the complaint, the actions taken by officers resulted in loss of circulation, lacerations, fractures, nerve damage, bruising, abrasions, sprains, debilitating pain, and emotional distress to the plaintiffs and other protesters. In addition, the complaint alleged that several of the plaintiffs were arrested and held without cause in unclean, overcrowded cells, without food, water, or medical assistance to treat their injuries. Plaintiffs further alleged that&mdash;despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic&mdash;police officers responding to protests frequently failed to wear masks or to assist detained protesters in covering their noses and mouths, and on occasion even forcibly removed protesters&rsquo; masks, exposing protesters to a heightened risk of contracting COVID-19. The plaintiffs also alleged that on numerous occasions, NYPD officers confiscated personal belongings, including cell phones and eyeglasses, and declined to return them or returned them damaged.</p>\r\n<p>The case was related to <a href=\"../../../../case/18020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">People of New York v. New York</a> and assigned to District Judge Colleen McMahon. In January 2021, Judge McMahon consolidated this case with three other police conduct cases (<a href=\"../../../../case/18020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">People of New York</a>, <a href=\"../../../../case/18092/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Payne v. De Blasio</a>, and <a href=\"../../../../case/18093/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wood v. De Blasio</a>) for pre-trial purposes. On February 4, 2021, the case was referred to Magistrate Judge Gabriel W. Gorenstein. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March 6 that further alleged violations of the New York State Constitution and state law, including claims of assault and battery, conversion, false imprisonment and unreasonable detention, negligent training and supervision, and excessive detention.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Three labor unions&mdash;the Sergeant&rsquo;s Benevolent Association, the Police Benevolent Association (&ldquo;PBA&rdquo;), and the Detectives&rsquo; Endowment Association&mdash;sought to intervene in one or more of the consolidated cases. But the court denied each of their requests without prejudice on April 28, 2021. Judge McMahon found these unions' asserted collective-bargaining interests too remote for intervention at that time. If the city were to enter settlement discussion, that would change things.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The PBA appealed Judge McMahon&rsquo;s decision on May 19, 2021. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed on March 4, 2022. Circuit Judge Steven J. Menashi held that the PBA established a \"direct, substantial, and legally protectable interest in officer safety that may be impaired by the disposition of those actions seeking declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to NYPD policies,&rdquo; and thus granted the PBA&rsquo;s motion to intervene.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, during the time that the PBA's appeal was pending, the district court partially granted the defendants&rsquo; June 9 motion to dismiss. On July 9, 2021, Judge McMahon dismissed as redundant all claims against defendants de Blasio, Shea, and Monahan in their official capacities, since plaintiffs had also brought claims against the city. The court also dismissed claims against Commissioner Shea in his individual capacity because the complaints lacked any indication that the Commissioner had any personal involvement in the alleged constitutional violations. As for the Sow plaintiffs specifically, the court dismissed their claims against Mayor de Blasio in his individual capacity relating to the issuance and enforcement of the curfew orders.</p>\r\n<p>But the court refused to dismiss several of the plaintiffs' claims. First, the court held that all plaintiffs had standing to pursue their claims. All plaintiffs had likewise stated a claim for municipal liability regarding use of force and mass arrest allegations. Finally, the court upheld claims against Chief Monahan and Mayor de Blasio in their individual capacities (all plaintiffs except for Yates brought such claims).</p>\r\n<p>The parties held several mediation conferences from July 2022 to May 2023. They reached a proposed settlement agreement regarding attorneys&rsquo; fees on April 21, 2023, in which the city would pay $300,000 in attorneys&rsquo; fees and the plaintiffs would release their claims. On July 19, 2023, the plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion for class certification for settlement purposes and preliminary approval of a settlement plan. The settlement agreement, reached on July 19, contained the following terms: the city would pay $13.7 million dollars, amounting to $9,950 for each class member, and additional service awards to the named plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs would release their claims against all defendants. The agreement left open attorneys&rsquo; fees, which the parties agreed to negotiate without the need for court intervention. The parties issued a slightly amended agreement, which Judge McMahon signed on August 23, 2023. The mediator issued a final report on September 7, 2023, stating that the parties reached agreement on all issues.</p>\r\n<p>In another class action suit on behalf of NYC protesters, the PBA asked the court to vacate its approval of the settlement agreement. On September 11, 2023, Judge McMahon clarified that the PBA&rsquo;s opposition to the settlement of the related NYC protester cases should not impact the schedule in this case. The court scheduled a fairness hearing for February 22, 2024.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 8, 2024 the parties filed a Consent Motion to approve the amended class-wide settlement agreement. Following the fairness hearing held on February 22, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff's Motion for final approval of class action settlement, final certification of the Settlement Class, determination that the notice to the class was consistent with the Court's preliminary approval orders, approval of service payments, approval of individual plaintiffs' settlements and approval of class counsel's attorneys' fees and costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The 23(b)(3) settlement class was certified as: \"All persons who were arrested, or arrested and subjected to force, by NYPD officers during the 'George Floyd protests' at the dates and locations in paragraph 32 of the Amended Stipulation of Settlement and allege any of the Released Claims described in paragraph 31 of the Amended Stipulation of Settlement, excluding (a) individuals who have settled claims with New York City Comptroller's Office arising out of the events at the 18 protest locations in the chart at paragraph 32; (b) individuals who brought lawsuits against the City and/or individual members of NYPD arising out of the events at the 18 protest locations in the chart at paragraph 32, and whose claims were settled, dismissed or otherwise disposed; and as further set forth in this Order.</p>\r\n<p>On March 5, 2024, in the Courts decision granting Plaintiff's motion for final approval, the Court explained that it found the Settlement fair and reasonable, pointing out that the Class overwhelmingly supported the settlement. The Court also found that the notice to the class was adequate and consistent with the Court's Preliminary Approval Orders, approved the service awards to the Class Representatives, and approved individual settlements for various plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>Some highlights of the court approved settlement are that the parties agreed for each eligible Class Member to be paid $9,500.00 and each Class Representative to get a service award of $9,950.00, to be paid in addition to the class settlement awards owed to them. The Court also found that the individual settlements were reasonable under the circumstances.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Court also approved the interim payment of attorneys' fees and costs for work performed through June 15, 2023, approving a payment of $5,850,000 for Class Counsel's reasonable fees and costs. In it's reasoning the Court pointed out that there was a fair, arm's length negotiation, none of the objections to the Settlement took issue with the requested fee award, the hours reported by class counsel were reasonable and necessary to successfully litigate the case, and that the requested fees and expenses are broadly consistent with fees deemed reasonable in common fund cases.&nbsp;</p>",

89\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  On May 25, 2020, police killed George Floyd. Almost immediately, protests \nagainst police violence and in support of police accountability and the Black Lives Matter \nmovement spread across the United States and the world, including here in New York City where \nthousands exercised their constitutional rights to protest. \n2.  In the days and weeks following Floyd’s killing, the New York City Police \nDepartment (“NYPD”) engaged in activities that violated the constitutional rights of individuals \nwho were protesting police misconduct, including, inter alia, corralling protestors into spaces \nwhere they could not escape, beating protestors with batons and fists, throwing protestors to the \nground, using pepper spray indiscriminately, and ultimately arresting many of the protestors \nwithout lawful justification and without fair warning. Protestors were physically restrained with \nflex-cuffs in such a manner that caused them unnecessary pain and suffering and, in some cases, \npossible  serious  and  long-term  nerve  damage.  They  were  also  subjected  to  lengthy  and \nunnecessary arrest processing that put them in dangerously close quarters, all at the height of the \nglobal COVID-19 pandemic.  \n3.  All of these activities were without lawful justification. \n4.  The unlawful policies and practices used by Defendants against protestors included \na crowd-control tactic known as “kettling” to corral and detain individuals who were engaged in \npeaceful protest. Defendants used kettling and similar tactics in order to impede constitutionally \nprotected First Amendment activities, to conduct mass arrests without probable cause, and to deter \nthose arrested and beaten, and others, from exercising their First Amendment rights in the future.  \n5.  In addition, NYPD officers also targeted and arrested legal observers, medics, and \nother workers performing essential services without probable cause.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 5 of 89\n6.  By contrast, these same Defendants have responded to other protests (including, in \nparticular, “Blue Lives Matter” and other pro-police protests) without using the same tactics \nemployed against those who protested police conduct during the racial justice protests of 2020. In \nother words, it is the message of the protest that determines whether Defendants will respond with \nviolent tactics and indiscriminate mass arrests.  \n7.  The police actions in this case were part of overlapping policies and practices of \nthe City of New York and the NYPD which were well known to Defendants New York City Mayor \nBill de Blasio, New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea, and other City policymakers. \nThese overlapping policies and practices include, inter alia, the use of excessive force, false \narrests, and excessive and unreasonable detention at certain demonstrations—particularly those \nthat focus on misconduct by the NYPD—but not others. These overlapping policies and practices \nhave existed for years and have often resulted in litigation. Defendants have acknowledged and \nadmitted to their failures to remedy these unconstitutional policies in recently released reports by, \ninter alia, the New York City Department of Investigation and the New York City Corporation \nCounsel.1   \n8.  Defendants’ conduct caused serious, and in many cases, lasting physical and \nemotional injury to members of the class. Thus, Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all other \nsimilarly situated, seek damages for all members of the class as well as declaratory and injunctive \nrelief to end the NYPD’s unlawful policies and practices with regard to policing demonstrations.  \n \n \n \n1 Margaret Garnett, Commissioner, New York City Department of Investigation, Investigation into NYPD Response \nto the George Floyd Protests, (“DOI Report”), Dec. 2020, available at \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doi/reports/pdf/2020/DOIRpt.NYPD%20Reponse.%20GeorgeFloyd%20Protests.12.18\n.2020.pdf; New York City Law Department, Corporation Counsel Report Pursuant to Executive Order 58 (June 20, \n2020) Directing an Analysis of Factors Impacting the George Floyd Protests in New York City (Dec. 2020) (“OCC \nReport”), https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/law/downloads/pdf/ProtestReport-np.pdf.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 6 of 89\nJURISDICTION   \n9.

On May 28, 2020, days after George Floyd’s death, protests began across New \nYork City. One protest in Union Square saw a mobilization of hundreds of NYPD officers in \nresponse who made several arrests. A group of protestors marched to City Hall where officers \ntrapped them with bicycles, and arrested approximately 75 people.  \n \n2 Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the factual allegations in the complaints in related cases People of the State of \nNew York v. City Of New York et al, 21-cv-322 (CM), Wood v. De Blasio et al, 20-cv-10541 (CM), Payne et al v. De \nBlasio et al, 20-cv-8924 (CM), and Sierra et al v. City of New York et al, 20-cv-10291 (CM) as well as the facts \ncontained in the reports that have been issued concerning these series of protests, including, inter alia, the report \nissued by the New York City Corporation Counsel and the report issued by the New York City Department of \nInvestigations. See, footnote 1 above. \n \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 13 of 89\n66.  Protests continued on May 29th at Foley Square in Manhattan and Barclay’s Center \nin Brooklyn. At Barclay’s Center, NYPD officers peppered sprayed and struck protesters with \nbatons and hundreds of protestors were arrested.  \n67.  On May 30, protests continued in New York City in all five boroughs. The protests \nwere again met with NYPD shows of force including pepper spray, baton strikes, fist strikes and \nmass arrests. In the Flatbush area of Brooklyn, a police helicopter flew low overhead swirling \ndebris, trash, and dust into the marchers’ faces. Collectively, at least 321 protestors were arrested \nfollowing encounters with the Defendants on May 30th.  \n68.  On May 31, the protests in New York City continued, with thousands marching \nfrom the Barclays Center over the Manhattan Bridge into Lower Manhattan, near the Williamsburg \nBridge, and in Times Square and Midtown. At least 325 protestors were arrested.  \n69.  Although there were some instances of property damage and injuries to NYPD \nofficers occurred at some of these protests, the vast majority of the protesters were peaceful and \ndid not engage in property damage. Defendants failed to distinguish protestors from the individuals \nwho damaged property or otherwise violated the law. Defendant Shea acknowledged that those \nprotesting the death of George Floyd and other Black victims of police misconduct in New York \nwere “overwhelmingly . . . good people coming out to voice their opinion.” Defendant Monahan \nalso admitted in a public statement that, “the vast majority of people are out there to express their \nviews.”     \nDefendant de Blasio’s Curfew Orders and the NYPD’s Subsequent Arrests  \n72.  On June 1, 2020, in the midst of the protests in New York City, Governor Andrew \nCuomo and Defendant de Blasio announced that New York City would be subject to an 11:00 p.m. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 14 of 89\nto 5:00 a.m. curfew.3 \n73.  On the evening of June 1, 2020, Defendant de Blasio announced he would be \nextending the curfew to the evening of June 2, 2020 from 8:00 p.m. to 5 a.m.4 \n74.  On June 2, 2020, Defendant de Blasio issued Emergency Executive Order No. 119, \nordering “a City-wide curfew to be in effect each day from 8:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m., beginning at \n8:00 p.m. on June 3, 2020 and ending at 5:00 a.m. on June 8, 2020” during which “no persons or \nvehicles” could “be in public.”5  \n75.  Under the Curfew Orders6: “Failure to comply with this Order shall result in orders \nto disperse, and any person who knowingly violates the provisions in this Order shall be guilty of \na Class B misdemeanor.”  \n76.  The  Curfew  Orders  specifically  targeted  those  engaged  in  First  Amendment \nexpression, as they exempted certain categories of workers that were deemed “essential”, including \n“police officers, peace officers, firefighters, first responders and emergency medical technicians, \nindividuals  travelling  to  and  from  essential  work  and  performing  essential  work,  people \nexperiencing homelessness and without access to a viable shelter, and individuals seeking medical \ntreatment or medical supplies.”  \n77.  Pursuant to the Curfew Orders, “any person who knowingly violate[d] the provisions \nin th[e] Order[s] [was] guilty of a Class B misdemeanor” under NYC Administrative Code § 3-108. \n \n3 See https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-and-mayor-de-blasio-announce-citywide-curfew-new-\nyork-city-will-take-effect; Emergency Executive Order No. 117, available at \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2020/eeo-117.pdf. \n4 See, e.g., https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1267642422194057217?s=20; Emergency Executive Order No. \n118, available at https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2020/eeo-118.pdf.  \n5 See Emergency Executive Order No. 119, available at \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2020/eeo-119.pdf.  \n6 Hereinafter, we refer to Defendant de Blasio’s Emergency Executive Orders related to the curfew collectively as \nthe “Curfew Orders.” \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 15 of 89\n78.  NYC Administrative Code § 3-108 contains a knowing intent requirement: “Any \nknowing violation of a provision of any emergency measure established pursuant to this chapter \nshall be a class B misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars, or by \nimprisonment for not more than three months, or both.” \n79.  Under New York Penal Law § 15.05, “A person acts knowingly with respect to \nconduct or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware that his \nconduct is of such nature or that such circumstance exists.” \n80.  On June 1, the NYPD Operations Division issued a FINEST message—an internal \nmessage to NYPD members—regarding the curfew orders, instructing officers that “[e]nforcement \nwill only be taken after several warnings are issued and the violator is refusing to comply.” \n(emphasis added). \n81.  On  June  2,  demonstrations  again  occurred  at  multiple  locations  throughout \nManhattan. Protestors encountered NYPD officers in Lower Manhattan, the Upper West Side, \nAstor Place, Chelsea, and Midtown. More than 290 protesters were arrested at these locations. As \noccurred in many of the mass arrest locations identified herein, these arrests were made without \nadequate notice to those engaged in protest and without permitting sufficient time for those who \nwere notified to disperse.  \n82.  On June 3, another FINEST message omitted the instruction to issue a dispersal \norder prior to curfew enforcement stating that, for a “person violating the curfew, a C-summons \nmay be issued . . . for violating the Mayoral emergency order.”  \n83.  On June 3, protests again occurred in Brooklyn, at Cadman Plaza and Maria \nHernandez Park and in Manhattan, at Midtown East and the Upper East Side near Gracie Mansion. \nAnother 191 protesters were arrested following encounters with NYPD officers at these locations. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 16 of 89\n84.  On June 4, 2020, protests continued across the City. More arrests were made on \nthis day than any date before.  \n85.  NYPD officers arrested protesters on June 4 just minutes before, at, or after the \n8:00 p.m. curfew in Brooklyn and Manhattan, trapping or kettling (as described above) protesters \nand using unreasonable and excessive force against protesters in Midtown Manhattan as well as in \nFort Greene and Williamsburg in Brooklyn.  \n86.  Also on June 4, police in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx engaged in \nwhat Human Rights Watch later called a “planned assault”7 on a protest against, among other \nthings, police misconduct, trapping protesters on 136th Street before the 8:00 p.m. curfew had \nexpired. \n87.  Defendant Monahan was present at the June 4, 2020 Mott Haven demonstration \nand  subsequent  kettle,  directing,  authorizing,  and  ratifying  enforcement  actions  taken  by \nsubordinate NYPD members.  \n88.  At approximately 7:45 p.m., NYPD Strategic Response Group (“SRG”) officers \nwearing body armor formed a line with their bodies and NYPD bicycles at 135th Street and Willis \nAvenue, causing protesters who had been proceeding south on Willis Avenue to turn east onto \n136th Street. \n89.  At or around the same time, NYPD officers formed a police blockade ahead of, and \ndownhill from, the protesters on 136th Street and Brook Avenue. As protesters arrived on the 136th \nStreet block between Brown Place (on the west) and Brook Avenue (on the east, downhill), they \nwere effectively trapped between police lines.  \n \n7 Human Rights Watch, “Kettling” Protesters In The Bronx: Systemic Police Brutality And Its Costs In The United \nStates (“HRW Report”), Sept. 2020, available at https://www.hrw.org/report/2020/09/30/kettling-protesters-\nbronx/systemic-police-brutality-and-its-costs-united-states.

Officers blocked passage on 136th Street between Brown Place and Brook Avenue. \nA third group of NYPD Officers formed a third police blockade between the 136th Street roadway \nand the sidewalks to the north and south of 136th Street, effectively preventing people trapped on \n136th Street between Brook Avenue and Brown Place from going onto the sidewalk, and people \ntrapped on the sidewalk from entering the roadway.  \n91.  At 8:00 p.m., having kettled the protestors into a space blocking their ability to \nleave, the NYPD then effectuated mass arrests with heavy use of force for purported violations of \nthe Curfew Orders. The force included striking protesters with batons, deploying pepper spray, \nand arresting National Lawyers Guild – New York City Chapter Legal Observers, and medical \nvolunteers along with them. \n92.  Plaintiffs Bredder, Pluchino, Sow, and Durkee were among the hundreds of people \nwho were trapped on 136th Street by the NYPD’s use of the kettling tactic.  \n93.  In Mott Haven on June 4, and elsewhere throughout the City during the protests, \nNYPD officers failed to issue dispersal orders allowing for compliance in advance of making \narrests for perceived violations of the Curfew Orders.  \n94.  As protests continued across the City on June 5 and 6, police used almost identical \ntactics against protestors. \n95.  On June 7, 2020, Defendant de Blasio lifted the Curfew Orders—one day earlier \nthan the last of the orders was to remain in effect. \n96.  At the time of these arrests, NYPD personnel who were present failed to give \nclearly communicated dispersal orders and/or provided meaningful opportunities to disperse \nbefore trapping or arresting protesters.  \n97.  While the Curfew Orders were in effect, the NYPD arrested approximately 1,350 \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 18 of 89\nindividuals, disproportionately Black and minority individuals, for allegedly violating the Curfew \nOrders. \n98.  Upon information and belief, all charged violations of the Curfew Orders related to \nthe protests that are the subject of this litigation were eventually dismissed. \n99.  During this series of arrests, police officers routinely failed to distinguish the \nprotesters from individuals taking advantage of the demonstrations to destroy property and steal \nfrom businesses.  \nNYPD’s Permissive Response to Pro-Police and Other, Similar Demonstrations  \n100.  The NYPD’s violent response to protests against police brutality was dramatically \ndifferent from their response to other kinds of protests and rallies. \n101.   On July 11, 2020, pro-police demonstrators held a “Rally to Back the Blue” in \nDyker Heights, Brooklyn. Pro-police marchers yelled at and antagonized counter-protestors, \nmaking racist and sexist statements, grabbing them, and spitting in counter protestors’ faces. The \nNYPD made no arrests at the rally.8   \n102.  On July 13, 2020, pro-police “Blue Lives Matter” groups held a march in Bay \nRidge, Brooklyn. The march was attended by counter protestors organized against police brutality. \nThough members of the pro-police group shouted racist and homophobic slurs at the counter \nprotesters and assaulted them in view of NYPD officers, only two people were arrested – both \nBlack men protesting police brutality. By contrast, a Blue Lives Matter demonstrator who punched \na woman in the face in view of NYPD officers was not arrested.9  \n \n8 Sydney Pereira, Videos Show Pro-Police demonstrators in Brooklyn Unleashing Racist, Sexist Vitriol Against \nCounter-Protestors, Gothamist, July 12, 2020, available at https://gothamist.com/news/police-rally-back-the-blue-\nbrooklyn-dyker-heights.  \n9 Jake Offenhartz and Gwynne Hogan, “They Defend Their Own Side”: NYPD Accused of Protecting Blue Lives \nMatter Marchers in Bay Ridge, Gothamist, July 13, 2020, available at https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-accused-\nprotecting-violent-blue-lives-matter-marchers-bay-ridge.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 19 of 89\n103.  In October 2020, hundreds of members of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in \nBrooklyn gathered in Borough Park to protest coronavirus restrictions imposed by Governor \nCuomo. The protestors set fires in the street and threw masks into the flames. They chased away \nNYC Sheriff’s Deputies and attacked a photojournalist reporting on the protest. An ultra-Orthodox \nJewish man who opposed the protestors was attacked by protestors and beaten with rocks. Police \nsaid that no arrests or summons were issued to the protestors on the night of the rally.10  \n104.  On October 25, 2020, a group called Jews For Trump convoyed hundreds of cars \ndraped with American flags and Trump 2020 banners. The caravan traveled from Coney Island to \nthe Trump Tower in Manhattan before heading to a rally in a Brooklyn park. Despite engaging in \nacts of disorder during this caravan, this rolling group of pro-Trump agitators was allowed to \ncontinue unhindered by the NYPD.11 \n105.  On November 1, 2020, a coalition of Trump supporters in a vehicle caravan were \nescorted through New York City despite blocking numerous bridges and committing acts of \nviolence. One bystander attempted to photograph an obscured license plate of a vehicle in the \ncaravan, but the driver of the vehicle drove into her and police threw her to the ground.12 \n106.

Though NYPD deputies were stationed \noutside the bar, it was reported that no arrests or summons were issued.1314 \n107.  The NYPD has a history of treating even right-wing extremists more permissively. \nThis pattern can be observed from the 1990s to the present.  \na.  In the early 1990s the NYPD stood by and took no action when a group of skinheads \nattacked a group of peaceful demonstrators. Dwares v. City of New York, 985 F.2d \n94 (2d Cir. 1993).  \n \nb.  In 1992, the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, egged on by mayoral candidate \nRudy Giuliani, held a demonstration at City Hall Park in response to Mayor \nDinkins’s call for a Civilian Complaint Review Board. This led to one of the biggest \nriots in New York City history. On-duty police officers who were present did little \nto stop it, and even encouraged it, despite the fact that the off-duty rioting officers \nblocked the Brooklyn Bridge, stormed City Hall, committed acts of vandalism, and \nassaulted bystanders.15,16 \n \nc.  More recently, the NYPD has turned a blind eye to violence committed by the \nProud Boys and other neo-Nazi groups. In one such instance in October of 2018, a \nmob of uniformed Proud Boys and right-wing skinheads cried homophobic slurs \nand kicked and stomped a person laying on the sidewalk. NYPD officers observed \nthe  violence,  but  did  not  intervene  to  stop  it.  Instead,  the  NYPD  was  more \nconcerned with controlling left-wing activists.17 During this incident three left wing \nactivists were arrested but not a single Proud Boy was questioned or arrested. Proud \nBoy leader Gavin McInnes boasted about the incident that the group had support \nfrom “[t]ons of cops, I have a lot of support in the NYPD…”18 \n \nReports and Investigations into the 2020 Protests  \n \n13 Wilson Wong, Hundreds protest closing of Staten Island bar that refused Covid-19 measures, NBC NEWS, Dec. \n3, 2020, available at https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hundreds-protest-closing-staten-island-bar-refused-\ncovid-19-measures-n1249873 \n14 NBC News 4, Staten Island Bar Reopens, Defying City and State COVID Orders Once Again, December 5, 2020, \navailable at https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/staten-island-bar-reopens-defying-city-and-state-covid-\norders-once-again/2762850/ \n15 Nat Hentoff and Nick Hentoff, Rudy’s Racist Rants: An NYPD History Lesson, Cato.org, July 14, 2016, available \nat https://www.cato.org/commentary/rudys-racist-rants-nypd-history-lesson \n16 Pamela Oliver, When the NYPD Rioted, University of Wisconsin – Madison, July 18, 2020, available at \nhttps://www.ssc.wisc.edu/soc/racepoliticsjustice/2020/07/18/when-the-nypd-rioted/ \n17 Jake Offenhartz, NYPD Accused Of 'Incredibly Deferential Treatment' Of Proud Boys Following Beatings Caught \nOn Video, available at, https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-accused-of-incredibly-deferential-treatment-of-proud-\nboys-following-beatings-caught-on-video \n18 Jake Offenhartz, Proud Boys Leader: 'I Have A Lot Of Support In The NYPD', Gothamist, Oct. 15, 2018, \nhttps://gothamist.com/news/proud-boys-leader-i-have-a-lot-of-support-in-the-nypd \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 21 of 89\n108.  In July 2020, the New York State Office of the Attorney General (the “AG”) issued \na preliminary report on the NYPD’s response to the May and June protests (“AG Report”).19 \n109.  The AG Report found that most complaints received by the AG were allegations of \nexcessive force, kettling, false arrests, and excessive force against protestors as well as similar \nmisconduct directed at the press, National Lawyers Guild – New York City Chapter Legal \nObservers, elected officials, and essential workers. \n110.  The AG Report also found the pervasive use and misuse of tightly fastened flex-\ncuffs during arrests, NYPD officers covering their badge numbers, and failure of NYPD officers \nto wear protective face coverings to protect themselves and others against the spread of COVID-\n19.  \n111.  In  December  of  2020, the  NYC  Department  of  Investigation  issued  a  report \nexamining the NYPD’s conduct in response to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests (“DOI \nReport”).20 \n112.  The DOI Report found, inter alia, that the NYPD lacked a sufficiently tailored \nstrategy to respond to protests, used force and tactics of crowd control that led to excessive force \nand  “heightened  tensions,”  made  decisions  based  on  intelligence  that  lacked  “context  or \nproportionality,” and deployed officers who lacked sufficient training in responding to protests.21 \n \n19 New York State Office of the Attorney General, Preliminary Report on the New York City Police Department’s \nResponse to the Demonstrations Following the Death of George Floyd, (“AG Report”), July 2020, available at \nhttps://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2020-nypd-report.pdf.

In addition to noting the heavy-handed response by the SRG at the 2020 protests, \nthe DOI Report found that officers not from SRG lacked “any recent training related to protests.”22 \n114.  The DOI found that NYPD policies do not have specific First Amendment protest \nexpression policing policies and failed to distinguish policies for serious civil disorders and riots \nfrom those applicable to peaceful First Amendment expression. \n115.  The DOI distinguished between protest facilitation and protest control, regulation, \nor suppression.  \n116.  The former is preferred to allow for First Amendment expression, the DOI Report \nfound, but the NYPD employed protest control during the 2020 protests. \n117.  According to the DOI Report, between May 28 and June 5, 2020, approximately \n2,047 individuals were arrested during demonstrations.23 \n118.  The DOI also found that Black arrestees were disproportionately charged with \nfelonies.24  \n119.  The DOI also found that “the force required to carry out a mass arrest was \ndisproportionate to the identified threat,” and “placed the burden of potential crime on a wide \nswath of people who had no apparent connection to that potential criminal activity.”25  \n120.  According to the DOI Report, between May 28 and June 20, 2020, the CCRB had \nreceived 1,646 protest-related allegations related to 248 incidents.26 \n \n22 Id. at 61. \n23 Id. at 26. \n24 Id. at 27. \n25 DOI Report at 56.  \n26 Id. at 28. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 23 of 89\n121.  In September of 2020, Human Rights Watch issued a detailed analysis of the Mott \nHaven protest (the “HRW Report”) describing the preplanned and coordinated disruption of the \nmarch by the NYPD, including by Chief Monahan, who was present at the NYPD mobilization.27 \n122.  The HRW Report describes the systematic kettling of protesters in Mott Haven \nbefore the 8:00 p.m. curfew and the subsequent excessive force and mass arrest of the marchers, \nincluding National Lawyers Guild – New York City Chapter Legal Observers, as well as medics, \nall of whom were classified as essential workers exempt from the Mayor’s Curfew Orders. \n123.  Notwithstanding these reports condemning the conduct of the NYPD, following the \nMott Haven protest, Defendant Shea ratified the misconduct that occurred when he said the \nmobilization by the NYPD in Mott Haven was “executed nearly flawlessly.”28  \n124.  Defendant City and NYPD leadership and policymakers knew the department and \nits officers had problems with constitutionally policing protests but failed to adequately train and \notherwise prepare its officers to respond to the 2020 protests, prevent its officers from committing \nthe same acts of misconduct, or discipline officers who engaged in such misconduct. \nThe COVID-19 Pandemic in New York City  \n125.  As protesters were taking to the streets in the summer of 2020 to speak out against \npolice brutality and in support of Black lives, the COVID-19 virus raged across the country.  \n126.  In April 2020, Governor Cuomo ordered people to wear protective face masks in \npublic, to protect themselves and others from the spread of the virus.  \n \n27 Human Rights Watch, “Kettling” Protesters In The Bronx: Systemic Police Brutality And Its Costs In The United \nStates (“HRW Report”), Sept. 2020, available at https://www.hrw.org/report/2020/09/30/kettling-protesters-\nbronx/systemic-police-brutality-and-its-costs-united-states.  \n28 Jake Offenhartz, Nick Pinto, and Gwynne Hogan, “NYPD’s Ambush of Peaceful Bronx Protesters Was “Executed \nNearly Flawlessly,” City Leaders Agree, Gothamist, June 5, 2020, available at https://gothamist.com/news/nypds-\nambush-of-peaceful-bronx-protesters-was-executed-nearly-flawlessly-city-leaders-agree. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 24 of 89\n127.  However, many police officers failed to abide by this directive to wear masks. As \nthe AG Report documented, many officers who interacted with and arrested protesters in May and \nJune of 2020 were not wearing face masks, even as the City continued to record hundreds of new \ncoronavirus cases each week. By contrast, most protesters wore protective face masks—at least \nuntil their contacts with NYPD members. \n128.  During their arrests, some protesters’ masks fell off or were removed. These \nprotesters were transported in vans and/or buses and placed in holding cells in close indoor contact \nwith other arrestees whose masks fell off or were removed, and police officers who were not \nwearing masks.  \nNamed Plaintiffs’ Experiences  \nPlaintiff David Jaklevic’s May 30th Arrest  \n129.  Plaintiff David Jaklevic is a 41-year-old attorney who has worked for the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor for approximately ten years.  \n130.  Mr. Jaklevic participated in a protest at and around Union Square on the night of \nMay 30, 2020.  \n131.  Mr. Jaklevic wore a protective face covering to protect himself and others from the \nspread of COVID-19. \n132.  When Mr. Jaklevic attempted to leave the protest to return home at approximately \n10:15 p.m., NYPD members forced protesters westward on 13th Street. \n133.  With no other way to move, Mr. Jaklevic moved as directed west on 13th Street.  \n134.  Officers on bicycles then formed a wall across 13th Street in front of protestors, \ntrapping Mr. Jaklevic and the other protesters on the block between Broadway and University \nPlace.  \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 25 of 89\n135.  Without any announcements or orders, the officers on bicycles charged forward \ninto the protesters. \n136.  At least two officers on bicycles, including Defendant NYPD Officer Kevin Agro \n(NYPD Shield No. 8054), struck Mr. Jaklevic with their bicycles as they drove into the protesters. \n137.   An officer then grabbed Mr. Jaklevic from behind, threw him into the air, and \nslammed him to the ground. \n138.  The force of their actions caused Mr. Jaklevic’s mask to fall off.  \n139.  The officer pulled Mr. Jaklevic’s left wrist, arm, and shoulder forcefully back and \nup his back at an unnatural angle, causing pain. \n140.   An officer put Mr. Jaklevic in flex-cuffs, pulling Mr. Jaklevic’s flex-cuffs as hard \nas he could and as tight as the cuffs would go. \n141.  The  officer  lifted  Mr.  Jaklevic  off  the  ground  using  the  flex-cuffs,  causing \nexcruciating pain in Mr. Jaklevic’s left shoulder and wrists. \n142.  Mr. Jaklevic informed the officer that the flex-cuffs were too tight and repeatedly \npleaded for his flex-cuffs to be loosened or removed. \n143.   An officer replied, in sum and substance, “Shut the fuck up and sit down.” \n144.  Mr. Jaklevic was told to sit on the curb, which increased the pain to his shoulder \nand wrists, and remain there for approximately one hour. \n145.  Mr. Jaklevic repeatedly told the officers around him that he had lost feeling in his \nhands. \n146.  Mr. Jaklevic repeatedly requested that his mask be replaced, but officers refused.  \n147.  Officers with whom Mr. Jaklevic interacted overwhelmingly did not wear masks.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 26 of 89\n148.  After an hour, an officer finally removed Mr. Jaklevic’s flex-cuffs and released him \nfrom custody with no charges.  \n149.  Mr. Jaklevic asked the officer who had told him to shut up and forced him to sit for \nhis badge number.  \n150.  The officer refused to give his badge number and told Mr. Jaklevic to leave \nimmediately, and said if Mr. Jaklevic did not, he would be re-arrested.  \n151.  The Defendants’ conduct directly and proximately caused physical and emotional \ninjury to Mr. Jaklevic, including, inter alia, sustained bruises and scrapes to his right shoulder and \nelbow, bruising and swelling to his left hand, and numbness, tingling, and nerve damage to his left \nwrist that has required repeated medical treatment including physical therapy, among other \ninjuries. \nPlaintiff Alexandra de Mucha Pino’s May 30th Arrest  \n152.  Plaintiff Alexandra de Mucha Pino is a 29-year-old senior program associate at \nEarthjustice with a B.S. in Environmental Resource Management. \n153.  On the evening May 30, 2020, Ms. de Mucha Pino participated in a march from \nCity Hall across the Brooklyn Bridge.  \n154.  Ms. de Mucha Pino wore a protective face covering to protect herself and others \nfrom the spread of COVID-19. \n155.  As the marchers made their way over the Brooklyn Bridge, officers waiting near \nthe Brooklyn end of the bridge formed a wall across the street. \n156.  As the marchers exited the bridge, officers charged at them, including Ms. de \nMucha Pino. \n157.  Officers did not give any orders before charging at the protesters.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 27 of 89\n158.  Ms. de Mucha Pino turned around and retreated from the charging officers.  \n159.  As she looked over her shoulder, she saw officers tackle, body slam, and strike \nprotesters with batons. \n160.  Ms. de Mucha Pino stood on the sidewalk and began recording the police activity. \n161.  Two officers rushed at Ms. de Mucha Pino. \n162.   One officer pushed Ms. de Mucha Pino with his baton and told her to move back, \nbut she could not physically move backwards because of a row of bushes behind her.  \n163.  The second officer also began pushing Ms. de Mucha Pino. \n164.  Ms. de Mucha Pino put her arms in the air. \n165.  The two officers ripped a metal cuff bracelet off Ms. de Mucha Pino’s wrist, \ncausing a gash to her left arm that left a permanent scar. \n166.  The two officers twisted Ms. de Mucha Pino’s arms and hands such that one palm \nwas facing inwards and one palm was facing outwards, and then placed flex-cuffs tightly on her \nin this incorrect position, which caused the flex-cuffs to further cut into her skin.  \n167.  Officers then forced Ms. de Mucha Pino to wait for approximately thirty minutes \nin the street. \n168.  While she waited, Ms. de Mucha Pino told officers that her flex-cuffs were too tight \nand were hurting her. \n169.  Eventually, she was loaded into a prisoner transport vehicle, with approximately \nten other protesters, many of whom had their personal protective equipment removed by officers. \n170.  Ms. de Mucha Pino was held in this extremely hot transport vehicle with the other \nprotesters for over three hours with her hands cuffed behind her in an incorrect position, and with \nno air-conditioning. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 28 of 89\n171.  When she was finally allowed to exit the vehicle, Ms. de Mucha Pino was forced \nto wait outside of One Police Plaza in a line for approximately an hour, during which time Ms. de \nMucha Pino’s flex-cuffs were finally removed. \n172.  Ms. de Mucha Pino then spent approximately four and a half hours in a cell with \ntwo to three other people, which was so small that there was not enough room on the bench in the \ncell for all four individuals. \n173.  Ms. de Mucha Pino’s cellmates asked for water but officers told them that they \ncould not give them water because they did not have cups.  \n174.  When arrestees asked about food, officers laughed and said in sum and substance \n“No, you aren’t getting any meals.” \n175.  After about eight and a half hours in custody, Ms. de Mucha Pino was given two \nsummonses for Disorderly Conduct and released from custody. \n176.  Ms. de Mucha Pino’s charges were eventually dismissed.  \n177.  The Defendants’ conduct directly and proximately caused Ms. de Mucha Pino \nphysical and emotional injuries, including, inter alia, loss of circulation in her wrist and bruising \nand a cut to her left arm, as well as nightmares and a fear of the police.  \n178.  Ms. de Mucha Pino missed work as a result of this incident. \nPlaintiff Oscar Rios’s June 1st Arrest   \n \n179.  Plaintiff Oscar Rios is a 29-year-old software developer. \n180.  On June 1, 2020, Mr. Rios attended a protest that began at Barclay’s Center, crossed \nthe Manhattan Bridge, and approached Port Authority.  \n181.  Mr. Rios wore a protective face covering to protect himself and others from the \nspread of COVID-19. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 29 of 89\n182.  As the protesters approached Port Authority, the NYPD blocked off the forward \npath with police cars, began intersecting blocks, and pushing in from behind the crowd as well, \nforcing the crowd to steer in a different direction.  \n183.  When the protest march arrived at Port Authority, Mr. Rios saw hundreds of police \nofficers lined up.  \n184.  Without giving any announcements or any orders to disperse, officers rushed the \nprotesters. \n185.   An officer tackled Mr. Rios, forced him prostrate on the ground, struck him \nmultiple times with a baton, and then punched him repeatedly.  \n186.  One or more officers sat or kneeled on top of Mr. Rios and handcuffed him with \nflex-cuffs with excessive tightness on the ground, impeding Mr. Rios’s breathing.  \n187.  Officers continued to strike Mr. Rios while he was on the ground, causing cuts to \nhis hands and knees, punched him in the stomach, and struck his back with a baton. \n188.  As Mr. Rios’s face was being pressed to the ground while he was wearing a \nprotective face mask, he experienced difficulty breathing and told an officer that he was struggling \nto breathe.  \n189.  The officer responded, in sum and substance, “Shut the fuck up,” and he then \nstepped intentionally on Mr. Rios’s face, breaking his eyeglasses.  \n190.  Mr. Rios begged officers to let him recover his eyeglasses after officers made him \nstand up.  \n191.  When officers finally gave Mr. Rios his eyeglasses, they were completely broken, \nwith both arms and lenses snapped off and warped.  \n192.  An officer asked Mr. Rios, in sum and substance, why he was attending the protest. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 30 of 89\n193.  When Mr. Rios responded that he was there to protest police brutality and that his \narrest was part of that brutality, the officer told him, in sum and substance, “Shut the fuck up.”  \n194.  Another officer threatened Mr. Rios with a baton and also told him, in sum and \nsubstance, “Shut the fuck up.” \n195.

When Ms. Zurkuhlen asked if officers would pull up her mask or keep a safe \ndistance between persons present, the officers laughed, mocked her, and refused. \n267.  Ms. Zurkuhlen observed two protesters with purple hands telling officers their \nhands were numb from the tightness of their flex-cuffs.  \n268.  Ms. Zurkuhlen explained to the officers that she was a registered nurse, and she \nasked if she could look at protesters’ wrists, or if their flex-cuffs could be loosened or removed.  \n269.  Officers replied that no one knew how to remove the flex-cuffs, that removing the \nflex-cuffs was impossible, and that Ms. Zurkuhlen should, in sum and substance, “shut the fuck \nup.”  \n270.

Ms. Zurkuhlen was then unloaded from the van and forced to wait in an extremely \nlong line outside of the centralized arrest processing location. \n275.  The officer assigned to Ms. Zurkuhlen’s arrest repeatedly remarked that he did not \nhave the tool to remove the tight flex-cuffs, that he was from the Bronx, and that he had no idea \nwhat was going on. \n276.

Another officer grabbed Mr. Sow from behind and pushed him against a car. \n354.  Mr. Sow’s mask fell from his nose and mouth during this process.  \n355.  When Mr. Sow asked an officer to pull his mask up to cover his nose and mouth, \nthe officer pulled up Mr. Sow’s mask so that it covered Mr. Sow’s eyes instead, like a blindfold.  \n356.  Mr. Sow asked for the mask to be removed from his eyes and the officer ignored \nthe request, instead saying in sum and substance, “we’ll deal with it when you’re down.”  \n357.  The officer then shoved Mr. Sow onto the ground. \n358.  Officers put extremely tight flex-cuffs on Mr. Sow.  \n359.  Mr. Sow was forced to kneel in the street, still blindfolded.  \n360.  Eventually, someone removed the mask from Mr. Sow’s eyes.  \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 44 of 89\n361.  Now able to see, Mr. Sow discovered that he was kneeling in a pool of someone \nelse’s blood.  \n362.  Mr. Sow’s flex-cuffs were so tight he lost feeling in his hands. \n363.  A nearby friend told Mr. Sow his hands had turned purple. \n364.  Mr. Sow begged officers for help with his flex-cuffs for at least 30 minutes. \n365.  During that period, other protesters also saw that Mr. Sow’s hands were turning \npurple and shouted for help as well. \n366.  At least two officers directly in front of Mr. Sow heard and ignored his complaints \nabout the tightness of the flex-cuffs and his hands having turned purple.  \n367.  Eventually an officer removed and re-applied Mr. Sow’s flex-cuffs. \n368.  Before removing the flex-cuffs, however, the officer deliberately squeezed Mr. \nSow’s wrists and smacked him on his neck, causing significant pain.  \n369.  The replacement flex-cuffs were again extremely tight. \n370.  Mr. Sow was made to kneel in the street, in overtight flex-cuffs, for 3 hours. \n371.  While being detained, Mr. Sow requested medical assistance from Defendant \nOfficer Talha Ahmad for pain in both his wrists and numbness in both hands, but Ahmad refused.   \n372.  While Defendant Ahmad was detaining Mr. Sow, Ahmad spoke suggestively to \nhim, stroked his left forearm, and called Mr. Sow his (Ahmad’s) “Boo.” \n373.  Defendant Ahmad held Mr. Sow’s forearm for a prolonged period of time, while \nstroking it. \n374.  When Defendant Ahmad transported Mr. Sow to a correctional center in Queens, \nAhmad made Mr. Sow travel alone with him despite announcements overheard by Mr. Sow telling \nall officers to bring “two bodies” (that is, protesters).  \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 45 of 89\n375.  Rather than issuing Mr. Sow a summons or other legal process on the street, officers \nloaded Mr. Sow into a prisoner transport vehicle and took Mr. Sow to a centralized arrest location. \n376.  Mr. Sow had to wait outside in a line of other protesters for approximately 2 hours \nwhile he awaited processing.  \n377.  While waiting in line, Mr. Sow overheard an officer tell Ahmad, in sum and \nsubstance, “I miss the raping days,” in response to which Ahmad laughed. \n378.  Between this and Ahmad’s earlier behavior, Mr. Sow spent the entire night in \nAhmad’s custody in a state of anxiety, stress, and trauma about sexual assault.  \n379.  Mr. Sow was placed in an intermediary cell for around ten minutes, then moved to \nanother cell for an hour.  \n380.  Mr. Sow’s belongings were taken while he was in the precinct. \n381.  Throughout his time in custody, Mr. Sow repeatedly asked Ahmad for medical \nattention, stating that his wrists were in pain and both of his hands had gone numb. \n382.  Ahmad repeatedly said in response to those requests, in sum and substance, “No.” \n383.  The cells in the centralized arrest location were filthy. \n384.  There was a toilet in the cell, but it was not working, there was no toilet paper, and \nit was covered in feces.  \n385.  There was urine all over the floor of the cell, flies throughout the cell, and vomit in \nthe corner. \n386.  At least 20 to 25 people were crowded into the cell, with no way to keep any social \ndistance. \n387.  The temperature in the cell was extremely hot.  \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 46 of 89\n388.  After approximately one hour in the second cell, Mr. Sow’s belongings were \nreturned to him and he was given a summons for curfew violation and released from custody. \n389.  Mr. Sow’s charges were dismissed. \n390.  The conduct of the Defendants directly and proximately caused Mr. Sow physical \nand emotional pain and suffering, including, inter alia, pain in both wrists and numbness and loss \nof feeling in both hands. \nPlaintiff Savitri Durkee’s June 4th Arrest  \n391.  Plaintiff Savitri Durkee is a 48-year-old performing artist at the nonprofit The \nImmediate Life with a bachelor’s degree from the University of Montana.  \n392.  One June 4, 2020, Ms. Durkee participated in the protest at Mott Haven.  \n393.  Ms. Durkee wore a protective face covering to protect herself and others from the \nspread of COVID-19. \n394.  Ms. Durkee arrived at the Mott Haven protest at approximately 6:30 p.m. in support \nof a women-run local organizing group against police brutality, Take Back the Bronx, and listened \npeacefully to speakers in a park prior to the march. \n395.  Ms. Durkee noticed that police presence was very heavy from the moment she \nstepped off the train.  \n396.  Between approximately 7:40 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., Ms. Durkee was caught in the \nMott Haven Kettle on 136th Street between Brown Place and Brook Avenue when the Brook \nAvenue Line formed a barricade with their bicycles to prevent passage to Brook Avenue and began \npushing the crowd back with their bicycles, at the same time that the Brown Place Line began \npushing the crowd forward from the rear and the Sidewalk Lines formed to either side. \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 47 of 89\n397.  Ms. Durkee was near the back of the march when the Brown Place Line rushed the \nmarch from behind.  \n398.  Ms. Durkee witnessed officers beating protesters with batons, arresting protesters, \nremoving eyeglasses from protesters and throwing the eyeglasses to the ground, and opening \nprotester’s backpacks and dumping the contents in the street.  \n399.  NYPD members never gave Ms. Durkee an order to disperse.  \n400.  Ms. Durkee was so tightly crushed by the police and the protesters attempting to \nescape them that she could not even move her hands and she became concerned for some of the \nsmaller young women in the crowd, at least one of whom was a teenager.  \n401.  A helicopter that had been hovering over the protest moved in quickly and so close \nthat Ms. Durkee was buffeted by the wind from it and alarmed by its loudness and proximity.  \n402.  An officer grabbed Ms. Durkee from behind and threw her to the ground and on \ntop of other women who had been pushed to the street by officers as he said in sum and substance, \n“Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up.”  \n403.  The officer grabbed Ms. Durkee’s hair and pulled her head back and ripped her \nmask down.  \n404.  The officer then put his knee or baton into her back and forced her down on top of \nthe other women.  \n405.  At no point did Ms. Durkee resist arrest. \n406.  The officer applied cuffs to Ms. Durkee by yanking her up roughly and cuffing her \narms behind her back.  \n407.  The officer handed Ms. Durkee off to another officer, who would act as Ms. \nDurkee’s arresting officer.  \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 48 of 89\n408.  Both officers had tape over their badges, preventing Ms. Durkee from learning their \nnames or badge numbers.  \n409.  NYPD Officers making up the kettle deployed pepper spray amid the protesters, \ncausing Ms. Durkee to cough due to the removal of her mask and exposing her to coughing of \nother protesters whose masks had been removed by the NYPD.  \n410.  An officer forced Ms. Durkee to stand with a number of other protesters while they \nawaited transportation.  \n411.  When all officers ignored the arrested protester’s requests to have their masks \npulled up, the protesters began leaning on one another to help pull each other’s masks up with their \nhands cuffed behind their backs.  \n412.  Officers loaded Ms. Durkee into a prisoner transport vehicle with 2 other protesters. \n413.  Ms. Durkee was held in an NYPD SUV with 2 other protesters for 45 minutes with \nthe windows up and her hands cuffed behind her back.  \n414.  The SUV traveled first to one local precinct, then another.  \n415.  After two hours in the second precinct, Ms. Durkee was moved to a centralized \narrest processing location in Queens and placed in a holding cell with 25 people, many of whom \nwere unmasked.  \n416.  Ms. Durkee assisted others in pulling up their masks.  \n417.  At approximately 2:00 in the morning on June 5, 2020, Ms. Durkee was issued a \nsummons for a curfew violation, that was later dismissed.  \n418.  The conduct of the Defendant officers directly and proximately caused Ms. Durkee \nto suffer physical and emotional injuries, including, inter alia, persistent neck pain, a fear of the \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 49 of 89\npolice,  difficulty  sleeping,  feelings  of  trauma,  and  feelings  of  nervousness  when  someone \napproaches her from behind.  \n419.  Ms. Durkee experienced a chilling effect from her arrest and detention. Her fear \nthat she was nearly crushed in the kettle has caused her to worry that she should not go to future \nprotests in case she is killed, and her minor daughter is left without a mother.  \n420.  Ms. Durkee missed two days of work due to her arrest and detention and subsequent \nrecovery, which set her behind on production schedules.   \nThe NYPD’s History of Mishandling Certain Protests  \n421.  The extensive deprivations of constitutional rights suffered by Plaintiffs and class \nmembers  during  the  2020  protests  are  part  of  the  NYPD’s  long  history  of  aggressive  and \nunconstitutional policing of certain First Amendment-protected activities going back many years, \nincluding, inter alia, protests denouncing the murder of Amadou Diallo in 1999, as well as protests \nagainst the World Economic Forum (the “WEF”) in 2002, the Iraq War in 2003, the Republican \nNational Convention (“RNC”) in 2004, the Occupy Wall Street (“OWS”) protests in 2011 and \n2012, and many other protests since, including Black Lives Matter and anti-police brutality \nprotests.  \n422.  The NYPD response to the protests in New York City the summer of 2020 was in \nline with its history of violent and unconstitutional responses to past protests challenging police \nconduct in New York City, including its treatment of certain First Amendment assemblies with \ndemoralizing and brutal shows of force, rather than genuine efforts to facilitate protesters’ \nprotected First Amendment activity. \n423.  For example, the NYPD met protests following the start of the Iraq War in 2003 \nwith mass arrests, excessive force, use of pepper spray, riding horses into crowds and batons strikes \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 50 of 89\nto disperse protestors, and kettling to move protestors from specific locations to effectuate mass \narrests.29 \n424.  The next year, during the police “Operation Overlord II” operation in response to \nthe Republican National Convention in 2004, NYPD members treated protestors to similar uses of \nkettling tactics, excessive force and mass arrests, and excessive and unreasonable detention.30 \n425.  The NYPD continued to employ similar mass arrest and excessive force tactics \nduring a years-long crackdown on Critical Mass bicycle rides beginning in 2004.31 \n426.  Similarly, during the Occupy Wall Street (“OWS”) protests in 2011, the NYPD \nused excessive force against protestors, bystanders, and National Lawyers Guild – New York City \nChapter Legal Observers, as well as kettling tactics to move protestors or initiate mass arrests.32 \n427.  Additionally, Defendants have employed the same tactics and practices against \nBlack Lives Matter, police accountability, and other, similar protests, over the intervening years. \n428.  Following NYPD conduct during these and other protests, the City of New York \nand the NYPD and its members have been sued repeatedly by protestors who alleged that they had \nbeen unlawfully detained, kettled, arrested, subjected to mass arrest, unreasonable and prolonger \ndetentions and violations of their First Amendment and other, related rights, much in the same \nmanner as have the Plaintiffs in this case. \n429.  In many of these cases Defendants employed tactics developed and modified over \nthe course of many years by Defendants Shea, Monahan, and their predecessors and by other \ndefendant City policymakers at and in connection with other demonstrations in the City dating \n \n29 See, e.g., N.Y.

Since at least the 1990s, the NYPD has failed to appropriately train its officers on \nthe  proper  handling  of  First  Amendment  assemblies,  despite  being  on  notice  of  serious \nconstitutional deficiencies in their existing training. \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 55 of 89\n431.  In fact, the NYPD’s core training related to protest response to this day is based on \ncrowd management and disorder control tactics for policing large-scale civil disorder and riots. \n432.   In 1997, the NYPD’s Disorder Control Unit (“DCU”) created the “Disorder \nControl Guidelines.” \n433.  Upon information and belief, to this day, that document forms the core the NYPD \nprotest response-related training. \n434.  The Disorder Control Guidelines treat disorders as military engagements and copies \nmilitary tactics and focus on tactics designed to deter, disperse, and demoralize groups, including \nby staging overwhelming presence and force at protest activity, as well as making early and “pro-\nactive” arrests, and mass arrests, using disorder control formations, encirclement or kettling, and \nother, similar tactics. \n435.  Upon information and belief, the core NYPD training, based on the Disorder \nControl Guidelines, focuses on the use of such tactics to – using the trainings’ terminology – \n“disperse and demoralize” protesters. \n436.  These disperse and demoralize tactics and trainings have persisted through the \npresent as exemplified by the experiences of the Named Plaintiffs and Class Members in this case.  \n437.  Upon information and belief, Disorder Control Guidelines were never meant to be \nguidelines for the policing of lawful First Amendment assemblies such as demonstrations – only \nfor large-scale civil disorder such as riots. \n438.  However, neither the Disorder Control Guidelines, nor, upon information and \nbelief, any related NYPD training, contain meaningful direction on the core First, Fourth, or \nFourteenth Amendment principles that must guide constitutional policing of First Amendment \nassemblies. \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 56 of 89\n439.  On information and belief, there was, and is, virtually no NYPD training—and \ncertainly no meaningful NYPD training—focusing on how to utilize the tactics described in the \nDisorder Control Guidelines without infringing on the constitutional rights of protesters, such as \nhow to make probable cause determinations or the requirements of providing an alternative avenue \nof protest, meaningful time and a path of egress when issuing a dispersal order, and the like.   \n438.  Defendants’ failures to train, which led to violations of Plaintiffs’ rights in this case, \ninclude, inter alia, the following: \na.  The  failure  to  provide  constitutionally  meaningful  dispersal  orders  and \nopportunities to disperse or other, similar fair warning prior to using force or taking \nother enforcement action, including, for example, the manner in which to inform \ndemonstrators they must move or disperse, how many warnings to give before \ntaking enforcement action, the length of time to be given in order to provide a \nmeaningful opportunity to comply, and the like; \n \nb.  The failure to make clear the need for individualized probable cause to arrest in a \nprotest context; \n \nc.  The need failure to provide training on the need for fair warning and a meaningful \nopportunity to comply with police directions as a prerequisite for probable cause to \narrest for a Curfew Order violation; \n \nd.  The failure to provide training on the use of reasonable and proportionate force in \nconnecting with policing First Amendment assemblies; \n \ne.  The failure to provide training on the need for, or tactics regarding, escort and \nfacilitation of First Amendment activities, and instead focuses almost exclusively \non tactics designed to “disperse and demoralize” protesters; \n \nf.  The failure to provide training on the proper application and removal of flex-cuffs, \nincluding how to measure the appropriate tension on flex cuffs; how to assess the \nneed to remove flex-cuffs; how long flex-cuffs may be worn before a significant \nrisk of nerve damage develops; the safest types of flex-cuffs to use (for example, \nflex-cuffs with a double-locking feature and padding); the safest types of removal \nequipment  to  use  and  how  to  use  removal  equipment  properly  so  as  not  to \naccidentally tighten flex-cuffs further in the process of removal; and other topics \nrelated to the use of flex-cuffs; and \n \ng.  The failure to provide training on the importance and need for NYPD members to \nwear masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, to provide masks for arrestees, and \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 57 of 89\nto allow arrestees to engage in mask-wearing, social distancing, handwashing, and \nother, similar safety measures in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n440.  Although many of the above problems with the NYPD’s training are endemic and \ncut across all of the relevant NYPD training, at present, Defendant City has a policy and practice \nof deploying one particularly problematic, inadequately trained, poorly supervised and disciplined \ngroup of NYPD members: the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group (“SRG”).  \n441.  The SRG, deployed around the City at protests in 2020 including those that are the \nsubject of this lawsuit, was created in 2015 as a specialized unit tasked with responding to disorder-\ncausing events and to conduct counter-terrorism operations. \n442.  The SRG has a unit in each of the five boroughs and the DCU has now been \nincorporated into the SRG. \n443.  In response to the public’s skepticism that the SRG would be used to crack down \non protests, then-Chief of Department James O’Neill stated: “They will not be involved in handling \nprotests and demonstrations. They’ll have no role in protests. Their response is single-fold. They’ll \nbe doing counter-terror work. They’ll be assigned to different posts throughout the city.”35 \n444.  However, since 2015, the SRG has been regularly deployed at protests, including \nthose in 2020 related to the present lawsuit. \n445.  Many SRG members, including many of those deployed to the protests in 2020 that \nare the subject of this lawsuit, have histories of engaging in the kinds of misconduct complained \nof herein, documented among other places, by CCRB complaints, and in numerous lawsuits.36  \n446.  SRG members are meant to have additional DCU training. \n \n35 Ben Yakas, NYPD: Fine, Maybe We Won’t Police Protests With Machine Guns, Gothamist, Jan. 30, 2015, \navailable at https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-fine-maybe-we-wont-police-protests-with-machine-guns.  \n36 Ali Winston, NYPD Unit At Center Of Protest Policing Has Dozens Of Officers With Long Misconduct Histories, \nThe Appeal, Oct. 15, 2020, available at https://theappeal.org/nypd-srg-misconduct/.  \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 58 of 89\n447.  Upon information and belief, that additional DCU training is principally modelled \non the core principles and tactics in the Disorder Control Guidelines.  \n448.  However, many of the officers deployed to respond to the protests in 2020 did not \neven receive that training, which was supposedly required of them. \n449.  As a result, as noted in the OCC Report, “for a majority of the officers who were \nassigned to the George Floyd protests, their training on policing protests was limited to what they \nhad received as recruits in the Academy.”37 \n450.  Between at least 2004 and the present, the NYPD’s mass arrest and violent crowd \ncontrol and protest policing tactics have been on full display in the streets of New York City; the \nsubjects of unfavorable coverage in the media, including coverage explicitly showing video \nevidence of NYPD members engaging in uses of excessive force in connection with crowd control \nwhile policing protests; documented in complaints to the Civilian Complaint Review Board and \nother agencies; as well as the litigations discussed above, which have cost the city tens of millions \nof dollars in judgments and settlements. \n451.  Indeed, in connection with the 2002 World Economic Forum and the 2004 RNC \npolicing operations, NYPD supervisors - including DCU supervisors charged with designing and \nimplementing NYPD protest policing-related policies and related training – routinely created \n“after action reports” that documented and critiqued NYPD plans for and responses to protest \nactivities. \n452.  For example, in a March 17, 2006 New York Times article that was published while \ndiscovery about related policies and practices was ongoing in the 2004 RNC litigations, “Police \nMemos Say Arrest Tactics Calmed Protest,” Jim Dwyer reported on the revelation of 2002 WEF \n \n37 OCC Report at 37. \n \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 59 of 89\nafter-action reports in then-ongoing litigation, Allen v. City of New York, 03-cv-2829 (KMW) \n(GWG) (SDNY).38 \n453.  Those reports praised employing militarized tactics such as the “staging of massive \namounts” of officers in riot gear including riot helmets and militarized “equipment” such as \narmored vehicles, prisoner wagons, and buses in view of demonstrations in order to “cause them \nto be alarmed” and as a “deterrent” as well as the use of “proactive” arrests in order to have a \n“powerful psychological effect” on protesters.  \n454.  After the 2002 WEF after-action reports were disclosed in Allen and the 2004 RNC-\nrelated after-action reports were disclosed in the RNC litigations, and some of them were made \npublic as a result, upon information and belief, rather than continuing to create such reports frankly \ndocumenting and assessing the NYPD’s protest policing-related policies and tactics, the NYPD \nopted to stop creating such records. \n455.  For example, according to the Corporation Counsel’s report, NYPD records do not \nshow any protest-related after action reviews undertaken between the 2004 Republican National \nConvention until the events of the George Floyd protests. \n456.  Nevertheless, upon information and belief, at all times relevant herein, Defendants \nde Blasio, Shea, Monahan, and other defendant City policymakers, routinely received reports \nregarding arrests made in connection with First Amendment assemblies, including through internal \nreports  such  as  Unusual  Occurrence  Reports;  Mass  Arrest  Reports  including  data  tracking \narrestees, the length of time it took them to go through the system, whether they were released \nwith a summons or DAT, their proposed arrest charges, and other information related to the status \nand/or dispositions of the cases; internal critiques from supervisors and other officers involved in \n \n38 Jim Dwyer, “Police Memos Say Arrest Tactics Calmed Protest,” N.Y. Times, March 17, 2006, available at \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/17/nyregion/police-memos-say-arrest-tactics-calmed-protest.html. \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 60 of 89\nmass arrests related to police actions taken in relation to an event; and/or other reports including \ninformation arrests, use of force protest arrest processing, and/or related prosecutions. \n457.  Despite the wealth of evidence of NYPD members’ historical brutality against \nprotesters, Defendant City has ignored, and/or failed to utilize, relevant information, including \ninformation gleaned from reports and lawsuits, as well as other data points, to identify deficiencies \nin NYPD training as it relates to constitutionally compliant protest policing. \n458.  For  example,  in  a  deposition  in  Packard  v.  City  of  New  York,  15-cv-7130 \n(S.D.N.Y.) (AT), a witness for the City of New York testified that in regard to protest police \ntraining it did not review (i) decline to prosecute decisions, (ii) conviction conversion rates or (iii) \nallegations and settlements in lawsuits relating to protest. \n459.  As  another  example,  Defendant  City  apparently  does  not  take  allegations  in \nlawsuits filed by protesters claiming they were falsely arrested during protests into account in \nconsidering its protest policing-related policies and training, in effect taking the position that there \nis nothing to be learned from lawsuits and settlements.  \n460.  For example, in a 2017 deposition, a Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) witness designated to \ntestify on sidewalk policy protesting, dispersal orders, and training on probable cause standards \nfor crimes commonly charged in protest policing by the Defendant City could identify no impact \nthat litigation against Defendant City between 2000 and 2011 had on Defendant City’s relevant \npolicies, practices, customs, or NYPD training. \n461.  Relatedly, according to the Corporation Counsel, “the NYPD does not demonstrate \na consistent commitment to reviewing and responding to external critiques regarding the policing \nof protests.”39   \n \n39 OCC Report at 2, 30.   \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 61 of 89\n462.  At  bottom,  the  NYPD’s  near-exclusive  focus  on  deterring,  dispersing,  and \ndemoralizing in trainings related to policing protests, coupled with the failure to train on specific, \nrelevant aspects of constitutional policing of protests, let alone how to encourage or facilitate \nprotests—despite having received clear notice that NYPD policing of protests has caused the \nsystemic violations of protesters’ constitutional rights for years—demonstrates both a history and \na policy, of disregard for the First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, and \nother, related rights of Plaintiffs and other similarly injured protesters. \nThe NYPD’s Policy and/or Practice  \nof Using Excessive Force to Control the Speech of Protestors  \n \n463.  Defendants used types and levels of force that were excessive and unnecessary \nforce against the Plaintiffs and other similarly situated protestors.  \n464.  In many cases, those uses of force were in contravention of, or inconsistent with, \nrelated, written NYPD policies and/or training. \n465.  In  many  cases,  Defendants  failed  to  document,  and/or  require  that  fellow \nDefendants and/or other fellow officers document, uses of force in accordance with related NYPD \npolicies and/or training. \n466.  In many cases, Defendants used force against Plaintiffs based on their position in \nor  proximity  to  a  perceived  group,  without  first  having  given  the  perceived  group  clearly \ncommunicated prior notice as well as a meaningful opportunity to comply with police orders \nand/or dissociate with the perceived group.  \n467.  In many cases, Defendants used types of force, such as deploying pepper spray, that \nthey knew, or should have known, would impact numerous people at one time, and/or cause lasting \npain,  suffering,  and/or  injury,  without  making  individualized  or  otherwise  appropriate \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 62 of 89\ndeterminations about whether those uses of force were necessary, justified, or reasonable under \nthe circumstances.  \n468.  Additionally, Plaintiffs and others arrested at the protests that are the subject of this \nlitigation were handcuffed with their wrists together and their hands behind their back with plastic \nflex-cuffs. \n469.  In many cases, Plaintiffs and/or other arrestees complained about the fact that their \nflex-cuffs were too tight and/or causing them injury. \n470.  Specifically, because they were arrested at a protest, Plaintiffs were subjected to \nflex-cuffing pursuant to Defendants’ Protest Arrest Processing Policies, in connection with which \nDefendant City did not supply Defendants with enough of cutting tools with which to loosen or \nremove flex-cuffs, or any flex-cuff pads, which are designed to prevent the very types of injuries \nPlaintiffs and other arrestees suffered as a result of having flex-cuffs applied to them. \n471.  It  was  no  secret  to  Defendants  that  using  flex-cuffs  to  restrain  protesters— \nincluding without providing adequate numbers of cutting tools or any protective padding—would \nresult in injuries to protesters, of the sort that appropriate policies, training, and/or supervision \nwould have avoided.  \n472.  For example, Burley v. City of New York, 03-cv-2915 (WHP)(FM) 2005 WL \n668789 (S.D.N.Y. March 23, 2005) was a class action arising from mass arrests of over 200 \ndemonstrators during 2002 WEF in New York City challenging, inter alia, the NYPD’s then-\npolicy and practice of using plastic flex cuffs as “unreasonable and excessive because of the \nmanner in which the handcuffs were applied and the length of time for plaintiffs were handcuffed.” \n473.   Plaintiffs in Kunstler v. City of New York, 04-cv-1145 (RWS)(MHD) (S.D.N.Y.) \nand other related cases arising from alleged false and retaliatory arrests in connection with police \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 63 of 89\nresponses to protests on April 7, 2003, also raised Monell claims around NYPD members’ use of \nextremely tight, plastic handcuffs.  \n474.  Additionally,  in  MacNamara  v.  City  of  New  York,  04-cv-9216  (RJS)(JCF) \n(S.D.N.Y.), the Court certified a “Conditions of Confinement Class, comprising all RNC arrestees \nwho were handcuffed with plastic flex cuffs.” See MacNamara v. City of New York, 275 F.R.D. \n125, 154 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). \n475.  Those cases, and many others, challenged the City’s and NYPD’s policies and \npractices regarding the use of flex-cuffs to restrain protesters, and put the Defendants in this case \non notice of the  \n476.  Relatedly, the DOI Report found, “When voicing those concerns to their arresting \nofficers or other officers in the area, arrestees were told that the officers lacked the necessary \nequipment to remove the flex-cuffs. Arrestees therefore had to wait, oftentimes for long periods, \nuntil they got to their respective arrest processing center so that flex-cuffs could be removed.”40 \nDefendants’ Policies and Practices  \nRegarding Arrests—Including Mass Arrests—Without Fair Warning  \n \n477.  In many cases, Defendants seized Plaintiffs based on the perception that they were \npart of a perceived group, without having made an individualized determination that there was \nprobable cause to arrest the Plaintiff in question based on their own, individual conduct, as opposed \nto the perceived “group conduct.”  \n478.  In many cases, Defendants failed to give constitutionally meaningful and adequate \ndispersal orders and meaningful opportunities to disperse prior to making arrests where such notice \nand opportunity were required.  \n \n40 See, e.g., DOI Report at 42. See also, AG Report at 29 (“Officers kept the [flex-cuffs] on their wrists even after \nthey were placed in cells, which, for some, cut off their circulation or caused other injuries to their wrists, including \ncuts and nerve damage.”).   \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 64 of 89\n479.  For example, with respect to Plaintiffs who were arrested in connection with \nperceived violations of Defendant de Blasio’s Curfew Orders, or for perceived violations of New \nYork Penal Law § 240.20(6) (Disorderly Conduct – Failure to Obey Lawful Dispersal Order), \nDefendants  failed  to  give  constitutionally  meaningful  and  adequate  dispersal  orders  and \nmeaningful opportunities to disperse prior to making such arrests, and/or ensure that each such \narrested Plaintiff had the state of mind required for such arrest. \n480.  With respect to Defendant de Blasio’s Curfew Orders, the plain language of \nDefendant de Blasio’s Curfew Orders required both (a) a knowing violation of the Executive Order \nprior to any arrest and (b) that any arrest could only follow a dispersal order, a meaningful \nopportunity to disperse, and a person’s refusal to comply with the order. \n481.  As pleaded elsewhere herein, Defendants enforced the Curfew Orders by arresting \nPlaintiffs and other protesters without first ensuring that they had been given dispersal orders, \nmeaningful opportunities to disperse, and refused to comply, under circumstances in which they \nhad not ensured that arrestees had knowingly violated the Curfew Orders. \n482.  That enforcement was consistent with official NYPD policy.  \n483.  For example, in a September 16, 2020 letter from NYPD Deputy Commissioner of \nLegal Matters Ernest F. Hart to Ida Sawyer, Acting Crisis and Conflict Director, Human Rights \nWatch,41 Deputy Commissioner Hart stated that officers who merely “observed individuals who \nwere not essential workers in public…[t]hat observation provided officers with probable cause to \ntake, at a minimum, enforcement for Administrative Code § 3-108, Violating a Mayoral Executive \nOrder, a ‘B’ Misdemeanor.”  \n \n41 Available at https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/media_2020/09/Annex%20II_0.pdf. \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 65 of 89\n484.  Additionally, in many cases, Defendants enforced other provisions of New York \nlaw against Plaintiffs and other perceived protesters without probable cause and/or without first \nhaving  given  constitutionally  meaningful  and  adequate  dispersal  orders  and  meaningful \nopportunities to disperse prior to making such arrests. \n485.  For example, with respect to Plaintiffs who were arrested in connection with \nperceived violations of P.L. § 240.20(5) (Disorderly Conduct – Blocking Pedestrian or Vehicular \nTraffic), Defendants failed to ensure that each such arrested Plaintiff had caused a criminally \nsignificant blockage of traffic, and/or to ensure that each such arrested Plaintiff had the state of \nmind required for such arrest. \n486.  By  way  of  further  example,  with  respect  to  Plaintiffs  who  were  arrested  in \nconnection with perceived violations of New York Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1156(a) (Pedestrians \non Roadway), Defendants failed to ensure that each such arrested Plaintiff had notice that they \nwere allegedly violating the law by walking along and/or upon a roadway and/or a meaningful \nopportunity to conform their conduct to the law in order to avoid being arrested.  \n487.  Defendants enforced provisions of New York law against Plaintiffs that Defendants \ntypically exercise their discretion not to enforce, or not to make arrests in connection with – for \nexample, VTL § 1156(a), which involves walking along or upon a roadway when an adjacent and \nusable sidewalk is available – the equivalent of jaywalking, an everyday offense that Defendants \nall but ignore in the City. \n488.  In many cases, Defendants employed a crowd control tactic in which Defendants \npushed and/or corralled and/or otherwise physically trapped perceived groups including Plaintiffs \nand other perceived protesters, including by kettling, without first having given Plaintiffs and the \nothers so pushed and/or corralled and/or trapped meaningful notice and an opportunity to disperse \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 66 of 89\nor otherwise change their conduct in order to avoid being so pushed and/or corralled and/or \ntrapped.  \n489.  Plaintiffs  amount  an  as-applied,  First  Amendment-based  challenges  to  the \napplication of NYC Administrative Code § 3-108; PL §§ 240.20(5) and/or 240.20(6); and/or VTL \n§ 1156(a) to their conduct and the events leading up to their arrests, as well as to their related \ncharging and/or prosecutions. \nDefendants’ Protest Arrest Processing Policies and Practices  \n490.  Beyond that, in many cases, Defendants arrested Plaintiffs for alleged offenses \nwhich New York Criminal Procedure Law § 150.20 required them to grant Plaintiffs summonses \non the street in lieu of a fuller or lengthier detention; and/or in connection with which, under the \nNYPD policies and practices that are applied in non-protest contexts, arrestees are taken directly \nto a nearby local precinct, and released in an average of between around two and four hours with \na summons.  \n491.  However, because Defendants arrested Plaintiffs and other arrestees in connection \nwith a protest, Defendants subjected them to Defendants’ Protest Arrest Processing Policies, which \ninvolved,  among  other  components,  placing  Plaintiffs  and  other  arrestees  in  flex-cuffs  and \nremoving them from the street to a centralized arrest processing location such as a Mass Arrest \nProcessing Center (“MAPC”), where Defendants subject them to large-scale arrest processing \nprocedures and Mass Arrest Processing Plan (“MAPP”) rather than issuing them summonses, and \nreleasing them from custody, on the street.  \n492.  Additionally, as a result, instead of detaining Plaintiffs and other arrestees for a \nrelatively brief period of time on the street, issuing them summonses, and releasing them, \nDefendants subjected Plaintiffs to flex-cuffing as well as unreasonably lengthy, onerous arrest \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 67 of 89\nprocessing, significantly increasing the amount of time they would otherwise have been in custody \nand exposing them to inappropriate and especially hazardous conditions of confinement, as well \nas searches of their persons and property, and/or seizures and/or retentions of their property \nwithout adequate pre- or post-deprivation notice and/or opportunity to be heard to challenge the \ngrounds for seizing and/or retaining the property. \n493.  In some cases, NYPD members destroyed and/or damaged property belonging to \nPlaintiffs and other arrestees. \n494.  In other cases, NYPD members seized and retained property from Plaintiffs and \nother arrestees without providing them with the NYPD paperwork required by NYPD policies, \npractices, and procedures to retrieve property seized by NYPD members. \n495.  In still other cases, NYPD members seized and retained property without providing \nPlaintiffs with a meaningful opportunity to retrieve it, for example because the location at which \nDefendants were retaining the property was closed. \n496.  The conditions of confinement were unsafe and overcrowded, particularly in the \ncontext of the COVID-19 pandemic, and/or filthy and/or unsanitary; and lacked appropriate access \nto phone calls, food, water, bathrooms soap and/or hand sanitizer, other hygienic products such as \ntampons, and/or other basic necessities.  \n497.  With  particular  respect  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  during  Plaintiffs’ \nconfinements, the State of New York, and Defendant City, had advised people to comply with \nsocial distancing, to wear masks, and to engage in practices such as hand-washing; and Defendant \nCity, as well as Defendants Shea, Monahan, and other NYPD members, enforced Executive Orders \nissued by Mayor de Blasio requiring people to engage in social distancing and/or mask-wearing, \nall on an emergency basis. \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 68 of 89\n498.  However, as part of Defendants’ Protest Arrest Processing Policies and MAPP, \ninstead of detaining Plaintiffs and other arrestees for a relatively brief period of time on the street, \nissuing them summonses, and releasing them, Defendants transported Plaintiffs to a MAPC or \nother centralized arrest processing location, in close, forced proximity to other arrestees and NYPD \nmembers, many of whom were not wearing masks, rendering social distancing impossible. \n499.  Relatedly, many Defendants and other nearby NYPD members were not wearing \nmasks while arresting and/or using force on and/or detaining Plaintiffs. \n500.  Also  relatedly,  Defendants  and  other  NYPD  members  removed  masks  many \nPlaintiffs and other arrestees who had masks at one point prior to or during their arrests or \ndetentions.  \n501.  Also  as  part  of  Defendants’  Protest  Arrest  Processing  Policies  and  MAPP, \nDefendants subjected Plaintiffs and other arrestees to conditions of confinement in which they \nwere unable to wash their hands or otherwise engage in other, similar hygienic practices that the \nState and City were recommending for public health and safety. \n502.  Defendants knew or should have known that, as a result of subjecting Plaintiffs and \nother arrestees to Defendants’ Protest Arrest Processing Policies and MAPP, they would deprive \nPlaintiffs and other arrestees of basic needs, including for example the need to stay safe from \nCOVID-19, as well as unreasonable risks of serious damage to their physical and/or mental health \nor safety through potential exposure to COVID-19. \n503.  Defendants acted intentionally to impose those conditions because they subjected \nPlaintiffs and other arrestees to Defendants’ Protest Arrest Processing Policies and MAPP.  \n504.  Additionally, Defendants recklessly failed to act with reasonable care to mitigate \nthe risks that the conditions posed even though they knew or should have known that they posed \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 69 of 89\nexcessive risks to Plaintiffs’ physical and/or mental health or safety through potential exposure to \nCOVID-19. \n505.  Moreover, the risks were obvious and apparent, including based on the State and \nCity policies and practices related to COVID-19 safety, and common sense. \nDefendants’ Failure to Monitor and Supervise NYPD Members’ Protest Policing \n506.  Although Defendants City, de Blasio, Shea, Monahan, and other policymakers \nactually knew, or should have known, that NYPD members were engaging in or had engaged in \nthe unconstitutional conduct complained of herein, they failed to monitor, supervise, and/or \ndiscipline NYPD members who directed, engaged in, or observed such conduct. \n507.  For example, despite statements made by Defendants de Blasio and Shea in the \nmedia indicating they had knowledge of events related to violence and mass arrests at the protests \nas they were unfolding, and the wealth of video and other evidence that has been widely available \nin the intervening months, upon information and belief, virtually no NYPD members have been \nmeaningfully investigated or disciplined related to their conduct.  \nDEFENDANTS’ IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS  \n508.  Defendants (a) imposed restrictions on such protected speech and/or conduct that \nviolated Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights, including, but not limited to, in falsely arresting \nPlaintiffs, in subjecting Plaintiffs to excessive force, in selectively enforcing laws and regulations \nagainst Plaintiffs, in subjecting Plaintiffs to Defendants’ Protest Arrest Processing Policies, and in \notherwise violating Plaintiffs’ rights and engaging in the acts and omissions complained of herein. \n509.  In addition to being retaliatory, the restrictions Plaintiffs complain of herein, which \nDefendants imposed on Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights to participate in, observe, and/or stand \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 70 of 89\nnearby speech, conduct, association, and/or other expressive activities protected by the First \nAmendment on the streets, were themselves regulations on Plaintiffs’ protected conduct that: \na.  Were viewpoint discriminatory and/or otherwise not content-neutral, and were not \nnecessary,  and  precisely  tailored, to  serve  compelling  governmental interests, \nand/or were not the least restrictive means readily available to serve those interests; \nor, alternately,  \n \nb.  Were  content-neutral,  but  lacked  narrow  tailoring  to  serve  a  significant \ngovernmental interest, in that they burdened substantially more protected speech \nand/or conduct than necessary to serve those interests, and/or failed to provide \nample alternatives for Plaintiffs’ protected expression, including in that Plaintiffs’ \nabilities to communicate effectively were threatened; and/or \n \nc.  Afforded Defendants unbridled or otherwise inappropriately limited discretion to \nlimit or deny Plaintiffs’ abilities to engage in protected conduct (also raising \nconstitutionally  significant  Due  Process-based  vagueness  and/or  overbreadth \nconcerns); and/or \n \nd.  Amounted to the imposition of strict liability on Plaintiffs for engaging in protected \nspeech and/or expression.  \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS  \n510.  Pursuant to Rule 23(a), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nthe named Plaintiffs ADAMA SOW, DAVID JAKLEVIC, ALEXANDRA DE MUCHA PINO, \nOSCAR  RIOS,  MATTHEW  BREDDER,  SABRINA  ZURKUHLEN,  MARIA  SALAZAR, \nDARA  PLUCHINO,  and  SAVITRI  DURKEE  seek  to  represent  a  certified  Plaintiff  class \nconsisting of (a) all persons who were targeted for their First Amendment protected activity \nincluding being, inter alia, unlawfully detained and/or arrested without fair warning or ability to \ndisperse, subjected to excessive force, and/or subjected to unreasonably lengthy and unsafe \ncustodial arrest processing during the New York City protest marches in opposition to police \nmisconduct and in support of police reform from May 28, 2020 through no earlier than November, \n2020 (the “Protests”); (b) all persons who have been or will be unlawfully detained and/or arrested \nwithout fair warning or ability to disperse since May 28, 2020, pursuant to the NYPD’s policy, \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 71 of 89\npractice, and/or custom of, without legal justification, conducting retaliatory arrests and detentions \nof individuals protesting in opposition to police misconduct and in support of police reform (the \n“Class” or “Class Members”).The members of the Class are so numerous as to render joinder \nimpractical. A report from the NYC Department of Investigation indicates that at least 2,047 \nindividuals  were  arrested  by  the  NYPD  in  connection  with  the  Protests.42  Individual \ndemonstrations during the Protests sometimes numbered up to 10,000 individuals, and large \nprotest groups were subjected to mass detention through kettling.43 Given the substantial number \nof individuals arrested and detained during the Protests, the members of the Class and any potential \nfuture subclasses are so numerous as to render joinder impractical. It is likely that, without an \ninjunction prohibiting Defendants’ unconstitutional practices, thousands more protesters against \npolice brutality will be unlawfully arrested or detained in the future.  \n511.  In addition, joinder is impractical because, upon information and belief, many \nmembers of the Class are not or will be not be aware of the fact that their constitutional and \nstatutory rights have been violated and that they have the right to seek redress in court. Upon \ninformation and belief, many members of the class are or will be without the means to retain an \nattorney to represent them in a civil rights lawsuit.  \n512.  Common questions of law and fact predominate over individual ones among Class \nMembers, including, but not limited to:    \na.  Whether Defendants violated the Class members’ rights to be free of unreasonable \nand excessive force;  \n \nb.  Whether Defendants’ use of unreasonable and excessive force was the result of a \nmunicipal policy or practice; \n \nc.  Whether Defendants’ use of unreasonable and excessive force violated the First, \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution;  \n \n42 DOI Report, Dec. 2020, at 30. \n43 Id. at 22, 20.  \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 72 of 89\n \nd.  Whether Defendants engaged in indiscriminate mass arrests without probable cause \nand/or individualized determinations thereof;  \n \ne.  Whether the indiscriminate mass arrests without probable cause were the result of \na municipal policy or practice;  \n \nf.  Whether Defendants’ indiscriminate mass arrests without probable cause violated \nthe First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution;  \ng.  Whether  the  Defendants  deliberately  detained  protesters  for  excessive  and \nunreasonably prolonged periods of time;  \n \nh.  Whether  Defendants’  deliberate  detentions  of  protesters  for  excessive  and \nunreasonable periods of time were the result of a municipal policy or practice;  \n \ni.  Whether  Defendants’  deliberate  detentions  of  protesters  for  excessive  and \nunreasonable  periods  of  time  violated  the  First,  Fourth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution;  \n \nj.  Whether Defendants retaliated against Class Members for engaging in speech \nand/or conduct protected by the First Amendment;  \n \nk.  Whether the City’s full-blown, custodial arrest and treatment of protestors against \npolice  brutality  during  the  ongoing  COVID-19  pandemic  amount  to  an \nunreasonable seizure and/or unconstitutional conditions of confinement in violation \nof  the  First,  Fourth,  and/or  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  United  States \nConstitution;  \n \nl.  Whether the City, New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea, and other \nsupervisory defendants, supervising officials, and/or personnel have knowingly and \ndeliberately failed to screen, train, supervise, monitor, and discipline officers, and \nwhether those failures have resulted and will continue to result in constitutional \nviolations by officers and City employees against Class Members; and \n \nm.  Whether the City, New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea, and other \nsupervisory defendants, supervising officials, and/or personnel sanctioned and/or \ndeliberately failed to rectify unconstitutional practices and customs, and whether \nsuch acts and omissions have resulted and will continue to result in constitutional \nviolations by officers and City employees against Class Members. \n \n513.  These common questions of fact and law all flow from the same policies, enacted \nand implemented by the named and unnamed Defendants. Defendant City of New York’s city-\nwide policies, practices, and customs applied at the Protests constitute a unitary scheme in which \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 73 of 89\nthe Defendants violated the constitutional rights of Class Members. The named Plaintiffs and all \nClass Members were and will be victimized by these same retaliatory policies of arresting \nprotestors against police brutality without legal justification in violation of, inter alia, the First, \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and the New York State \nConstitution, and thus the foregoing common questions of law and fact greatly predominate over \nquestions  affecting  only  individual  members,  including  legal  and  factual  issues  relating  to \ndamages.  \n514.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of those of the Class in that at the \ntime the named Plaintiffs constitutional rights were violated, they were engaging and/or attempting \nto engage in activities protected by the First Amendment or were simply observing or in the \nvicinity of such conduct as bystanders. The Named Plaintiffs were the victims of the Defendants’ \npolicies or arresting, without individualized determinations of probable cause and indeed without \nprobable cause in general, groups of individuals engaged in lawful political protest. The Named \nPlaintiffs the victims of excessive and unreasonable force in the course of these unconstitutional \narrests and, following their arrests, were detained under conditions that were unreasonable, \ninhumane, excessive and punitive, all in violation of the First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments \nto the United States Constitution and the Constitution and laws of the State of New York. \n515.  The legal claims for which the Named Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive \nrelief are the same as or similar to those on which all members of the Class will rely, and the harms \nsuffered by the Named Plaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered by the class members. \n516.  The Named Plaintiffs have a strong personal interest in the outcome of this action, \nhave no conflicts of interest with members of the Class, and will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the Class. Moreover, many of the Named Plaintiffs reside in the New York City area \n73 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 74 of 89\nwhere the Defendants’ unconstitutional policies, practices and/or customs are implemented, and \ntherefore remain at high risk of being unconstitutionally harmed in the future pursuant to these \npolicies, practices and customs as they wish to participate in future protests in New York City \nagainst police misconduct.  \n517.  The Named Plaintiffs are adequate class representatives because they were arrested \nin New York City, without legal justification, while attending protests against police brutality \nbetween May 28 and June 6, 2020, their summonses or other charging instruments were later \ndismissed, and they were subjected to Defendants’ Protest Arrest Processing Policies. Plaintiffs \nare also typical of the members of the Class. Like other members the Class, the Named Plaintiffs \nwere subject to arrests in violation of their First Amendment rights, excessive use of force, and \nunconditional conditions of confinement.  \n518.  The named Plaintiffs are represented by Jonathan C. Moore, David B. Rankin, and \nLuna Droubi of the law firm Beldock, Levine & Hoffman LLP (“BLH”); Elena L. Cohen and J. \nRemy Green Cohen&Green P.L.L.C. (“C&G”); Gideon Orion Oliver (“Oliver”); Wylie Stecklow \nPLLC (“Stecklow”), and Masai Lord of Lord Law Group PLLC (“Lord”). \n519.  BLH attorneys have litigated a number of class action lawsuits including, but not \nlimited to: Floyd v. City of New York, 08-cv-1034 (S.D.N.Y.) (currently in the remedial stages); \nDaniels v. City of N.Y., 198 F.R.D. 409, 418 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (“Aided by the capable hands of \nJonathan C.

See also, Syed v. City of New York, 16-cv-04789 (S.D.N.Y.); Elsayed v. \nCity of New York et al., 18-cv-10566 (S.D.N.Y.). \n520.  C&G attorneys have litigated a number of class action and police suits, including, \nbut not limited to: Jones v. United States Postal Service, 20-cv-6516 (S.D.N.Y.) (nationwide \nvoting rights class action); Edrei v. Bratton, 16-cv-01652 (S.D.N.Y.), aff’d sub. nom. Edrei v. \nMaguire, 892 F.3d 525 (2d Cir. 2018) (landmark, precedential decision in challenge to NYPD’s \nuse of Long Range Acoustic Device (“LRAD”) against Black Lives Matter protesters), cert. denied \nMaguire v. Edrei, 139 S. Ct. 2614 (2019) (with Oliver)); Gallagher v. N.Y. State. Bd. of Elections, \n20-cv-5504 (S.D.N.Y.) (New York State voting rights class action). See also Yang v. N.Y. State \nBd. of Elections, 20-cv-3325 (S.D.N.Y.), aff’d sub. nom. Yang v. Kosinski, 960 F.3d 119 (2d Cir. \n2020).  \n521.  Oliver has over 16 years of experience litigating civil rights cases against the \nNYPD, including hundreds of cases challenging the City’s policies, practices, and customs related \nto protest policing. Oliver has frequently co-counseled with BLH attorneys and C&G attorneys in \nlitigation. For example, in addition to litigating other 2004 RNC-related cases, Oliver was Of \nCounsel to BLH attorneys at the summary judgment briefing stage of the MacNamara RNC 2004 \nclass action litigation. Ever since, Oliver has always maintained a docket including at least dozens \nof Plaintiffs’ protest-policing related cases. One such recent case was Edrei (with C&G). \n522.  Stecklow has extensive experience litigating civil rights both in New York and \nelsewhere including Baltimore, Maryland: Lomax v. O’Ree, 24-C-16-002313 (Circuit Court, \nBaltimore City) and Iowa: Cordero v. World Food Prize, 17-cv-0347 (S.D.Iowa). Stecklow has \n75 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 76 of 89\nbeen litigating NYPD policies and practices for fifteen (15) years, including, but not limited to: \nAlford v. City of New York, 06-cv-2512 (S.D.N.Y.); Peat v. City of New York, 12-cv-8230 \n(S.D.N.Y.); Gerskovich v. Iocco, City of New York, 15-cv-7280 (S.D.N.Y.), Packard v. City of \nNew York, 15-cv-7130 (S.D.N.Y.); Nigro v. City of New York, 19-cv-2369 (S.D.N.Y.); Monahan \nv. City of New York, 20-cv-2610 (S.D.N.Y.). \n523.  Lord has litigated dozens of civil rights cases involving the NYPD and other New \nYork state law enforcement agencies. Lord has been of counsel in 1983 actions throughout New \nYork state, including Epps v. City of Buffalo et al, 19-cv-281 (W.D.N.Y.) and Jones v. Albany et \nal, 18-cv-81 (N.D.N.Y.). He has also been lead counsel in multiple pending actions, including but \nnot limited to, Iyahen v. City of New York et al, 20-cv-03448 (S.D.N.Y), and Williams v. City of \nNew York et al, 20-cv-5995 (S.D.N.Y). \n524.  Plaintiffs’  counsel’s  firms  have  the  resources,  expertise,  and  experience  to \nprosecute this action, and know of no conflicts among members of the Class or between the \nattorneys and members of the Class.  \n525.  An Injunctive Class should be certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure because the Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to \nthe class, in engaging in the aforementioned practices and failing to correct the aforementioned \nunconstitutional policies thereby making class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief appropriate. \n526.  A Damages Class should be certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) because questions \nof law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only \nindividual Class Members and a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and \nefficient adjudication of the controversy. A class-wide proceeding will generate common answers \nto these questions. \n76 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 77 of 89\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUnlawful Seizure / False Arrest   \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for Defendants’ Violations of Plaintiffs’ Rights Under the \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \n \n527.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding and \nfollowing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n528.  Defendants’ seizure of the Plaintiffs herein was done without any judicial warrant \nauthorizing then to seize any Plaintiff was unreasonable and was done without privilege or lawful \njustification,  \n529.  Plaintiffs did not consent and were conscious of their confinements by Defendants.  \n530.  Defendants did not have individualized probable cause to seize, detain, or arrest \nPlaintiffs.  \n531.  As a result of Defendants’ acts and omissions, Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of \ntheir federal, state, and/or other legal rights; caused Plaintiffs bodily injury, pain, suffering, \npsychological and/or emotional injury, and/or humiliation; caused Plaintiffs to expend costs and \nexpenses; and/or otherwise damaged and injured Plaintiffs. \n532.  The unlawful conduct of the Defendants was willful, malicious, oppressive, and/or \nreckless, and was of such a nature that punitive damages should be imposed against them.  \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \nExcessive Force  \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for Defendants’ Violations of Plaintiffs’ Rights Under the \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \n \n533.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding and \nfollowing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n534.  Defendants’  use  of  force  against  Plaintiffs  was  unjustified  and  objectively \nunreasonable, taking into consideration the facts and circumstances that confronted Defendants. \n77 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 78 of 89\n535.  As a result of Defendants’ acts and omissions, Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of \ntheir federal, state, and/or other legal rights; caused Plaintiffs bodily injury, pain, suffering, \npsychological and/or emotional injury, and/or humiliation; caused Plaintiffs to expend costs and \nexpenses; and/or otherwise damaged and injured Plaintiffs. \n536.  The unlawful conduct of the Defendants was willful, malicious, oppressive, and/or \nreckless, and was of such a nature that punitive damages should be imposed against them. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFirst Amendment  \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for Defendants’ Violations of Plaintiffs’ Rights Under the First \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \n \n537.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding and \nfollowing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n538.  In committing the acts and omissions set forth herein, the Defendants acted under \ncolor of state law, individually and in concert, without lawful justification to deprive Plaintiffs of \ntheir rights to speech, expression and to assemble in violation of the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States. \n539.  As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiffs were deprived of liberty, suffered specific \nand serious bodily injury, emotional distress, costs, and expenses and were otherwise damaged \nand injured. \n540.  The unlawful conduct of the Defendants was willful, malicious, oppressive, and/or \nreckless, and was of such a nature that punitive damages should be imposed against them. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n78 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 79 of 89\nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFirst Amendment Retaliation  \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for Defendants’ Violations of Plaintiffs’ Rights Under the First \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \n \n541.  Defendants retaliated against Plaintiffs for engaging in speech and/or conduct \nprotected by the First Amendment.  \n542.  Defendants engaged in the acts and omissions complained of herein in retaliation \nfor Plaintiffs’ protected speech and/or conduct. \n543.  Defendants engaged in the acts and omissions complained of herein in order to \nprevent Plaintiffs from continuing to engage in such protected speech and/or conduct. \n544.  Defendants engaged in the acts and omissions complained of herein in order to \nprevent and/or discourage Plaintiffs from engaging in similar protected conduct in the future. \n545.  Additionally,  as  discussed  elsewhere  herein,  Defendants  City,  Shea,  and/or \nMonahan designed and/or implemented policies and practices pursuant to which those Defendants \nwho implemented them subjected Plaintiffs to violations of the First Amendment rights.   \n546.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  engaged  in  the  acts  and  omissions \ncomplained of herein with respect to Plaintiffs’ First Amendment-based claims—including the \nrelated municipal liability claims involving the adoption of policies, practices, and/or customs \nand/or related failures to train, supervise, and/or discipline—with malice. \n547.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  engaged  in  the  acts  and  omissions \ncomplained of herein with respect to Plaintiffs’ First Amendment retaliation claims—including \nthe related municipal liability claims involving the adoption of policies, practices, and/or customs \nand/or  related  failures  to  train,  supervise,  and/or  discipline—in  response  to  the  perceived \nviewpoint and/or message expressed by Plaintiffs.  \n79 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 80 of 89\n548.  Upon information and belief, Defendants did not subject other protesters expressing \n“Blue Lives Matter” or other, similar, pro-police messages who were similarly situated to Plaintiffs \nin terms of their conduct and/or its potential public ramifications to the conduct, policies, practices, \nand/or customs complained of herein.  \n549.  Additionally, the offenses charged against Plaintiffs, which Defendants might \nargue provided probable cause for Plaintiffs’ arrests, were all offenses that Defendants typically \nexercise their discretion not to enforce, or not to make arrests in connection with. \n550.  Each Plaintiff suffered actual chill in that each Plaintiff was prevented and/or \ndeterred from or impeded in participating in protected conduct on the date of and after the incident; \nand/or suffered adverse effects on their protected speech and/or conduct; and/or otherwise suffered \nsome concrete harm(s).  \n551.  Additionally,  in  many  cases,  Defendants  apparently  permitted,  acquiesced  in, \nand/or facilitated the speech and/or other expressive conduct in which Plaintiffs were engaging, \nbefore suddenly using force and/or making arrests, without first having given reasonable notice \nthat  such  force  and/or  arrest  activity  would  result  if  Plaintiffs  did  not  conduct  themselves \ndifferently and/or disperse, as well as a meaningful opportunity to comply.  \n552.  Additionally, as discussed elsewhere herein, Defendants City, de Blasio, Shea, \nand/or Monahan designed and/or implemented policies and practices pursuant to which those \nDefendants who ordered, effected, and otherwise participated in arresting and detaining Plaintiffs \nsubjected Plaintiffs to the violations of their First Amendment rights described elsewhere herein. \n553.  As a result of Defendants’ acts and omissions, Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of \ntheir federal, state, and/or other legal rights; caused Plaintiffs bodily injury, pain, suffering, \n80 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 81 of 89\npsychological and/or emotional injury, and/or humiliation; caused Plaintiffs to expend costs and \nexpenses; and/or otherwise damaged and injured Plaintiffs. \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nDue Process \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for Defendants’ Violations of Plaintiffs’ Rights Protected Under \nthe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \n \n554.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding and \nfollowing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n555.  In addition to the Due Process violations described above, Plaintiffs hereby mount \nan as-applied, Due Process-based challenge to the application of NYC Administrative Code § 3-\n108; PL §§ 240.20(5) and/or 240.20(6); and/or VTL § 1156(a) to their conduct and the events \nleading up to their arrests, as well as to their related charging and/or prosecutions. \n556.  As described above, Defendants enforced offenses, including the Curfew Orders \nand NYC Administrative Code § 3-108; PL §§ 240.20(5) and 240.20(6); and VTL § 1156(a), in a \nmanner that rendered them constitutionally void for vagueness and/or overbroad, such that their \nenforcement against Plaintiffs violated their Due Process rights, in that Defendants’ enforcement \nin connection with those offenses failed to provide and/or reflected the absence of adequately clear \nstandards to guide police officials’ extremely broad discretion to arrest anyone at their whim, based \non ad hoc determinations, often without fair warning.  \n557.  Additionally, as discussed elsewhere herein, Defendants City, de Blasio, Shea, \nand/or Monahan designed and/or implemented policies and practices pursuant to which those \nDefendants who ordered, effected, and otherwise participated in seizing and/or retaining Plaintiffs’ \nproperty and/or detaining Plaintiffs in the conditions as described subjected Plaintiffs to the \nviolations of their Due Process rights described elsewhere herein.  \n81 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 82 of 89\n558.  As a result of Defendants’ acts and omissions, Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of \ntheir federal, state, and/or other legal rights; caused Plaintiffs bodily injury, pain, suffering, \npsychological and/or emotional injury, and/or humiliation; caused Plaintiffs to expend costs and \nexpenses; and/or otherwise damaged and injured Plaintiffs. \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nEqual Protection and Selective Enforcement   \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for Defendants’ Violations of Plaintiffs’ Rights Protected \nUnder the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \n \n559.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding and \nfollowing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n560.  Plaintiffs  hereby  mount  an  as-applied,  Equal  Protection-based,  selective \nenforcement challenge to the application of NYC Administrative Code § 3-108; P.L. §§ 240.20(5) \nand/or 240.20(6); and/or V.T.L. § 1156(a) to their conduct and the events leading up to their \narrests, as well as to their related charging and/or prosecutions.  \n561.  Additionally, as described above, in many cases, Defendants arrested Plaintiffs for \nalleged  offenses  in  connection  with  which  C.P.L.  §  150.20  required  that  Plaintiffs  receive \nsummonses on the street in lieu of a fuller or lengthier detention; and/or in connection with which, \nunder the NYPD policies and practices that are applied in non-protest contexts, arrestees are taken \ndirectly to a nearby local precinct, and released in an average of between around two and four \nhours with a summons.  \n562.  However, because Defendants arrested Plaintiffs and other arrestees in connection \nwith a protest, Defendants subjected them to Defendants’ Protest Arrest Processing Policies, rather \nthan issuing them summonses, and releasing them from custody, on the street, while Defendants \ndid not apply those same Protest Arrest Processing Policies to other similarly situated arrestees.  \n82 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 83 of 89\n563.  Additionally, as discussed elsewhere herein, Defendants City, de Blasio, Shea, \nand/or Monahan designed and/or implemented policies and practices pursuant to which those \nDefendants who ordered, effected, and otherwise participated in arresting and/or detaining and/or \nprosecuting Plaintiffs subjected Plaintiffs to the above-described violations of Plaintiffs’ Equal \nProtection rights. \n564.  As a result of Defendants’ acts and omissions, Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of \ntheir federal, state, and/or other legal rights; caused Plaintiffs bodily injury, pain, suffering, \npsychological and/or emotional injury, and/or humiliation; caused Plaintiffs to expend costs and \nexpenses; and/or otherwise damaged and injured Plaintiffs. \nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nMunicipal Liability  \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983 and Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978) \nfor Defendants’ Violations of Plaintiffs’ Rights Under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution \nOn behalf of Plaintiffs against Defendant City of New York, Defendant Bill de Blasio, Defendant \nDermot Shea, and Defendant Terence Monahan \n \n565.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding \nand following paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n566.  The facts pleaded above describe the policies, practices, and customs Defendants \nsubjected the Named Plaintiffs and other Class Members to, including, but not limited to: uses of \nexcessive force, and false arrests, and unreasonable restrictions on protesters’ First Amendment-\nprotected conduct, often without fair warning; employing crowd control tactics such as pushing, \ncorralling,  encircling,  or  otherwise  trapping  protesters,  without  fair  warning;  engaging  in \nretaliatory and selective enforcement of the Curfew Orders and other violations against perceived \nparticipants in First Amendment assemblies, particularly Black Lives Matter and/or anti-police \nbrutality protests, in the absence of adequately clear standards to guide police officials’ extremely \n83 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 84 of 89\nbroad discretion to arrest anyone at their whim, based on ad hoc determinations as to their \nperceived violations, without fair warning; using flex-cuffs for protest-related arrests, while failing \nto supply officers with protective padding and adequate numbers of cutting tools to loosen or \nremove flex-cuffs, while and/or to ensure that such cutting tools are readily available when needed; \nfailing to loosen or remove over-tight cuffs; and subjecting arrestees to lengthy detentions and \nlengthy detentions and arrest processing at centralized arrest processing locations, exposing them \nto searches, property seizures, and unhealthy and conditions of confinement, in lieu of brief street \ndetentions.  \n567.  All of the wrongful acts or omissions complained of herein were carried out by the \nindividual named and unnamed police officer defendants pursuant to: (a) formal policies, rules, \nand procedures of Defendant City; (b) actions and decisions by Defendant City’s policymaking \nagents  including,  but  not  limited  to,  Defendant  de  Blasio,  Defendant  Shea,  and  Defendant \nMonahan; (c) customs, practices, and usage of the NYPD that are so widespread and pervasive as \nto  constitute  de  facto  policies  accepted,  encouraged,  condoned,  ratified,  sanctioned,  and/or \nenforced by Defendant City, Defendant de Blasio, Defendant Shea, Defendant Monahan, and other \npolicymaking officials; (d) Defendant City’s deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ rights secured \nby the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, as evidenced \nby the City’s failures, and the failures of the City’s policymaking agents, to train, supervise, and \ndiscipline NYPD officers, despite full knowledge of the officers’ wrongful acts, as described \nherein. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n84 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 85 of 89\nEIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolations of New York State Law  \nPursuant to the New York State Constitution and New York State Common Law \n \n568.   Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding and \nfollowing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n569.  The conduct of the police officials alleged herein occurred while they were on duty \nand/or in and during the course and scope of their duties and functions as police officials, and/or \nwhile they were acting as agents and employees of Defendant City, clothed with and/or invoking \nstate power and/or authority, and, as a result, Defendant City is liable to the Plaintiffs pursuant to \nthe state common law doctrine of respondeat superior. \nViolations of the New York State Constitution  \n570.  Defendants, acting under color of law, violated Plaintiffs’ rights pursuant to Article \nI, §§ 6, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of the New York State Constitution. \n571.  A damages remedy here is necessary to effectuate the purposes of Article I, §§ 6, \n8, 9, 11, and 12 of the New York State Constitution, and appropriate to ensure full realizations of \nPlaintiffs’ rights under those sections. \n572.  As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiffs were deprived of liberty, suffered specific \nand serious bodily injury, emotional distress, costs and expenses and were otherwise damaged and \ninjured. \n573.  The unlawful conduct of the Defendants was willful, malicious, oppressive, and/or \nreckless, and was of such a nature that punitive damages should be imposed against them.  \n \n \n \n85 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 86 of 89\nAssault and Battery \n574.  Defendants committed assault within the meaning of New York common law \nagainst Plaintiffs by intentionally placing Plaintiffs in fear of imminent harmful or offensive \ncontact. \n575.  Defendants committed battery within the meaning of New York common law \nagainst Plaintiffs by intentionally physically contacting Plaintiffs without Plaintiffs’ consent. \n576.  Defendants did thereby inflict assault and battery upon the Plaintiffs. \nConversion  \n577.  Defendants committed conversion by intentionally taking possession of and/or \ninterfering with Plaintiffs’ personal property in derogation of Plaintiffs’ rights.  \n578.  Defendants’ acts and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of injury and \ndamage to the Plaintiffs and violated their rights as guaranteed by the laws and Constitution of the \nState of New York. \nFalse Imprisonment and Unreasonable Detention  \n579.  By the actions described above, the police officials described above did falsely \narrest and/or imprison Plaintiffs within the meaning of New York common law without reasonable \nor probable cause, illegally and without a written warrant, and without any right or authority to do \nso. Plaintiffs were conscious of the confinement and it was without their consent. \nNegligent Training and Supervision  \n580.  Upon information and belief, Defendant City supervised, and trained the police \nofficials described above. \n86 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 49   Filed 03/06/21   Page 87 of 89\n581.  The acts and conduct of the police officials were the direct and proximate cause of \ninjury and damage to the Plaintiffs and violated their statutory and common law rights as \nguaranteed by the laws and Constitution of the State of New York. \n582.  Defendants’ acts and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of injury and \ndamage to the Plaintiffs and violated their rights as guaranteed by the laws and Constitution of the \nState of New York. \n583.  As a result of the acts and omissions complained of herein, Plaintiffs suffered the \ninjuries and deprivations of their constitutional and common law rights discussed herein. \nExcessive Detention \n584.  Defendants deliberately detained protesters for excessive and unreasonably prolonged \nperiods of time.  \n585.  As a result of the acts and omissions complained of herein, Plaintiffs suffered the \ninjuries and deprivations of their constitutional and common law rights discussed herein. \nDEMANDS FOR RELIEF  \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs demand the following relief against the Defendants: \na.

The \nlawsuits allege, among other things, that the NYPD violated the First, Fourth and Fourteen \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution in responding to the protests, and that officers used excessive \nand unnecessary force against nonviolent protestors, journalists, and bystanders. Plaintiffs claim \nthat these responses are reflective of a pattern of unconstitutional conduct by the NYPD in \nresponding to peaceful protests.   \nBefore the Court is Defendants’ motion to dismiss the operative complaints filed in 20-cv-\n8924 (dkt. 54, “Payne A.C.”), 20-cv-10291 (dkt. 38, “Sierra A.C.”)), 20-cv-10541 (dkt. 48, “Wood \nA.C.”), 21-cv-322 (dkt. 52, “People A.C.”)), 21-cv-533 (dkt. 49, “Sow A.C.”), and 21-cv-1904 \n(dkt. 43, “Yates Compl.”).1  (Dkt. 105.)   \n \n1 A seventh action, Rolon v. City of New York, No. 21-cv-2548, was filed on March 24, 2021.  \nHowever, it was not consolidated into the consolidated matter until April 29, 2021, at which \npoint the Court stayed the action pending the resolution of the earlier-filed cases.  (Dkt. 7.) \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 2 of 45\nDefendants’ motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.  \nBACKGROUND \n \nI.  Facts \nThe following summarizes only those facts pertinent to this motion to dismiss. \nA.  Protests Erupt Throughout New York City \nOn May 28, 2020, three days after George Floyd was killed by a police officer in \nMinneapolis, Minnesota, the first large-scale demonstration protesting police brutality erupted in \nNew York City.  Over 100 protesters gathered in Union Square in Manhattan, some of whom \nmarched in the direction of City Hall.  That day, over 70 protesters were arrested.  (People Am. \nCompl. ¶ 52.)   \nThe protests continued over the subsequent days throughout New York City’s boroughs, \nincluding on May 29, May 30, and May 31.  (People Am. Compl. ¶¶ 53-54.) I will refer to them, \nand to subsequent protests that are mentioned in various pleadings, as the Black Lives Matter, or \nBLM, protests.  \nMost of the complaints do not so much as suggest that persons other than the police \nengaged in any untoward behavior during these nightly protests. The Attorney General, as befits \nher office, does admit that there were instances of property damage and injuries to NYPD officers, \nalthough the complaint minimizes the seriousness of this misbehavior.  (People A.C. ¶ 26.) And \nthe plaintiffs in Wood allege, “In the first few days of protests, some isolated and much-publicized \ninstances of theft and violence also occurred.”  (Wood. A.C. ¶ 32.) However, contemporaneous \nnews reports – of which the Court cannot and will not pretend to be unaware – reported widespread \nlooting, smashed windows, and other property damage connected to the New York City protests.2 \n \n2 N.Y.C. Protests Turn Violent, New York Times (May 31, 2020), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/nyregion/nyc-protests-george-floyd.html; After Peaceful \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 3 of 45\nThis conduct by persons who may have been protesters or who may have used the protests as a \ncover for criminal behavior was no different than what was going on during post-Floyd protests in \nMinneapolis, Portland, and elsewhere.3 \nOn June 1, Mayor Bill de Blasio issued Emergency Executive Order 117 (“EO 117”), \nwhich imposed a curfew within New York City between the hours of 11:00 PM on June 1 and 5:00 \nAM on June 2.  In a subsequent order, Emergency Executive Order 119 (“EO 119”), Mayor De \nBlasio expanded the nightly curfew to last from 8:00 PM until 5:00 AM, beginning on the evening \nof June 2 and ending on the morning of June 8.  (Sow A.C. ¶¶ 73-74.)  The orders exempted \n“essential workers,” including “police officers, peace officers, firefighters, first responders and \nemergency technicians, [the homeless], [and] individuals travelling to and from essential work and \nperforming essential work,” from the curfew.  (Goykadosh Decl., Ex. F (Dkt. 107-6) at 2.)  Failure \nto comply would result in orders to disperse; individuals who knowingly violated the orders could \nbe charged with a Class B misdemeanor which, under the City’s administrative code, is punishable \nby a fine of no more than $500 or by imprisonment for no more than three months, or both.  (Id.; \nsee N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 3-108.) \nThe protests continued at night despite the curfew orders.  Several demonstrations occurred \nthroughout Manhattan on June 1 and 2, in Manhattan and Brooklyn on June 3, in Manhattan, \nQueens, Brooklyn, and the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx on June 4, and in Manhattan, \nBrooklyn,  and  Staten  Island  on  June  5.    Approximately  889  individuals  were  arrested  at \ndemonstrations between June 1 and June 6.  (People A.C. ¶¶ 55-60.)   \n \nProtests, Looters Strike at Macy’s and Across Midtown, New York Times (June 2, 2020), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/nyregion/nyc-looting-protests.html. \n3 ‘They Have Lost Control’: Why Minneapolis Burned, New York Times (July 3, 2020), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/minneapolis-government-george-floyd.html. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 4 of 45\nOn June 7, Mayor de Blasio lifted the curfew orders, one day earlier than planned. (Sow \nA.C. ¶ 95.)  Protests continued, mostly peacefully, until June 28, when hundreds of NYPD officers \nallegedly met protesters in Washington Square Park with violence and pepper spray.  (People A.C. \n¶¶ 61-62.) \nSimilar encounters occurred throughout the summer and fall of 2020.  Among others: on \nJuly 28, NYPD officers allegedly interrupted a protest in the Kips Bay neighborhood of Manhattan, \nwhere they blocked protesters and pushed one protester into an unmarked van that drove away (id. \n¶ 64); on September 26, hundreds of NYPD officers allegedly disrupted a demonstration in \nWashington Square Park, where they confiscated the property of the protesters and knocked some \ninto the ground (id. ¶ 66); in the days immediately following the 2020 presidential election, NYPD \nofficers surrounded and forcefully arrested protesters in the West Village, Union Square, and the \nNolita neighborhood of Manhattan (id. ¶¶ 68-69); and on January 18, 2021, Martin Luther King \nDay, protesters who had marched from the Barclays Center in Brooklyn to City Hall Park were \nmet by a large police presence that encircled protesters and used force to subdue and arrest them \n(id. ¶ 71). \nB.  The NYPD’s Alleged Treatment of Protesters \nPlaintiffs allege that they were subjected to unconstitutional mistreatment by NYPD \nofficers during the encounters and after their arrests.  On numerous occasions, Police used a tactic \ncalled “kettling” to surround, trap, and eventually arrest protesters, without first providing a \nwarning or opportunity for them to leave the area.  (Payne A.C. ¶¶ 2, 164-165; People A.C. ¶¶ 22, \n4; Wood A.C. ¶ 44; Sierra A.C. ¶¶ 2, 27.)  On nights when Mayor de Blasio’s curfew orders were \nin effect, the police kettled protesters shortly before 8:00 PM so they had no ability to disperse, \nwhich resulted in their violating the curfew.  (Payne A.C. ¶ 166.)  Plaintiffs allege that police \nproceeded to beat protesters with batons, shove them with bicycles and pin them to the ground, \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 5 of 45\ninjuring many.  (Payne A.C. ¶¶ 2, 167; People A.C. ¶ 3, Sierra A.C. ¶¶ 66-69.)  Plaintiffs further \nallege that arrested individuals were forcefully handcuffed and held for prolonged periods in \novercrowded cells.  (Payne A.C. ¶¶ 2, 126, 133, 147, 187, 198, 205, 216; People A.C. ¶¶ 244, 249-\n50, 404; Sierra A.C. ¶¶ 75-82, 94-97, 103, 110-114, 120-122.); and that police officers also used \nforce to arrest persons who were observing rather than protesting, including medics in hospital \nscrubs, journalists with press credentials and legal observers in neon green caps. (Payne A.C. ¶¶ \n54, 61-62, 97, 130, 161-69.)  All these people were allegedly arrested without probable cause.   \nPlaintiffs further allege that the treatment of protesters was a result of the City’s failure to \nconfront a decades-long pattern of police misconduct during similar protests; the City turned a \nblind eye to unconstitutional policing during protests; and the NYPD failed adequately to train, \nsupervise and discipline its officers in constitutionally-sound de-escalation tactics for policing \nprotests. As a result, there has long been a widespread pattern and practice of police misconduct \nduring First Amendment protected protests.  (Payne A.C. ¶ 218; People A.C. ¶ 80.) \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Claims \nPlaintiffs, in varying combinations, allege that the NYPD’s treatment of protesters violates \nthe First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  More specifically, they \nassert claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, premised on their allegations that the NYPD used excessive \nforce to subdue protesters and observers and executed mass arrests without probable cause, in \nviolation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  (The Sow plaintiffs also assert this claim \nunder the Fifth Amendment.)  Plaintiffs further assert that, in doing so, Defendants violated \nPlaintiffs’ right engage in constitutionally-protected First Amendment activities.  Plaintiffs also \nallege that Defendants retaliated against them because of the content of their constitutionally-\nprotected speech – a protest against alleged police misconduct in New York City and elsewhere.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 6 of 45\nPlaintiffs also assert numerous claims under New York State constitutional and common \nlaw,  including  state  law  tort  claims  for  assault,  battery,  false  arrest,  negligence,  negligent \nsupervision and denial of medical treatment.  \nII.  Procedural History \nFive of the six actions are filed on behalf of individuals who were present at various \ndemonstrations. See Payne v. De Blasio, No. 20-cv-8924; Sierra v. City of New York, No. 20-cv-\n10291; Wood v. De Blasio, No. 20-cv-10541; Sow v. City of New York, No. 21-cv-533; Yates v. \nNew York City, No. 21-cv-1904.  Payne and Yates were brought on behalf of a group of identified \nindividuals and were deliberately not brought as class actions. Sierra, Wood and Sow were filed as \nclass actions, with the named plaintiffs seeking to represent a class of individuals who were \nwronged by police conduct during the protests. In addition to claims against the City, all five of \nthese actions also allege claims against individual NYPD officers (some named, some not yet \nidentified) and seek compensatory damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on behalf of the named \nplaintiffs and, presumably, absent class members in the class action cases. The Payne, Sow, and \nSierra plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the policies and practices employed by the NYPD \nare unconstitutional; and the plaintiffs in two of the five cases – Payne and Sow – also seek to \nenjoin the continuation of policies the plaintiffs assert are illegal.  \nThe sixth case, People of the State of New York v. City of New York, No. 21-cv-322, is filed \nin parens patriae by the Attorney General of the State of New York. The only defendants in People \nare the City, Mayor Blasio, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea and NYPD Chief of Department \nTerence Monahan. The complaint in People alleges three claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and \nanother eight claims under New York law, with the State claiming jurisdiction to pursue the action \npursuant to New York State Executive Law § 63(1) and the parens patriae doctrine, which “allows \nstates to bring suit on behalf of their citizens in certain circumstances by asserting a ‘quasi-\n6 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 7 of 45\nsovereign interest.’” Connecticut v. Physicians Health Servs. of Connecticut, Inc., 287 F.3d 110, \n119 (2d Cir. 2002) (quoting Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. \n592, 601 (1982)). This action does not allege any claims against any individual NYPD officer, and \nthe amended complaint, which focuses exclusively on the practices and policies of the NYPD, \nseeks only declaratory and injunctive relief. \nPresently before the Court is a motion by four of the defendants – the City of New York, \nMayor de Blasio, Commissioner Shea and Chief Monahan – to dismiss the operative pleading in \neach of the six actions.4 (Dkt. 105.)  No other named defendant in any lawsuit has filed a pre-\nanswer motion to dismiss the complaint.  \nAll but the Sow plaintiffs joined in a consolidated brief opposing Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss; the Sow Plaintiffs filed their own papers.  \nDISCUSSION \n  Defendants move to dismiss the complaints pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  \n \nI.  Rule 12(b)(1) \nDefendants move to dismiss these six actions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(1) on grounds that (1) individual plaintiffs do not have standing to pursue any claim for \ninjunctive or declaratory relief, (2) their claims for injunctive and declaratory relief are moot, and \n(3) the State of New York does not have standing in parens patriae. \n \n4 In every case but Yates, the operative pleading is an amended complaint, filed as of right \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 8 of 45\nA.  Legal Standard \n“Article  III  of  the  Constitution  limits  federal  ‘judicial  power,’  that  is,  federal-court \njurisdiction, to ‘Cases’ and ‘Controversies.’” United States Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. \n388, 395 (1980). A case is properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule \n12(b)(1) when the district court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it. See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). Plaintiff bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence \nthat subject matter jurisdiction exists. See Malik v. Meissner, 82 F.3d 560, 562 (2d Cir. 1996). In \nresolving a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1), a district \ncourt may refer to evidence outside the pleadings. See Kamen v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 791 \nF.2d 1006, 1011 (2d Cir. 1986). \nB.  The Payne And Sow Plaintiffs Have Standing To Pursue Injunctive and Declaratory \nRelief; The Sierra Plaintiffs Have Standing to Pursue Declaratory Relief \nThe Payne and Sow plaintiffs seek a ruling declaring that Defendants’ actions violated the \nFirst and Fourth Amendments and enjoining Defendants (and their offices and employees) from \ntaking any action under the allegedly unconstitutional policies or practices of employing excessive \nforce, false arrests, and retaliatory tactics against protesters.  The Sierra plaintiffs, however, seek \nonly a declaration that the NYPD’s response to the June 4, 2020 Mott Haven protest was \nunconstitutional.  Defendants move to dismiss all these claims for injunctive and declaratory relief, \non grounds that none of the plaintiffs has standing to pursue these equitable remedies. \nAn individual plaintiff may demonstrate standing to seek injunctive and declaratory relief \nby plausibly alleging the existence of an official policy or custom and a likelihood of future harm \nfrom that policy or custom.  An v. City of N.Y., No. 16 Civ. 5381 (LGS), 2017 WL 2376576, at *2 \n(S.D.N.Y. June 1, 2017).  For the reasons described infra, Plaintiffs have alleged that the NYPD \nhad a policy or custom of using excessive force and mass arrests to effectuate crowd control at \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 9 of 45\nFirst Amendment-protected activities.  Thus, whether Plaintiffs have standing to seek injunctive \nand declaratory relief turns on whether their allegations show a likelihood of future harm. \nWhile reserving judgment on whether there was anything unconstitutional about the way \npolice handled the protests during the summer of 2020, at this stage in the proceedings it appears \nthat the Payne and Sow plaintiffs face a realistic prospect of future harm.  In the amended \ncomplaints, the Payne and Sow plaintiffs allege that they will continue to participate in protests \nthroughout the City.  (See Payne A.C. ¶¶ 124, 137, 142, 193, 201; Sow A.C. ¶ 516.)  At the motion \nto  dismiss  stage,  this  Court  is  required  to  accept  those  well-pleaded  allegations  as  true.  \nFurthermore, as described infra, Plaintiffs have alleged a systematic, ongoing, and city-wide \npractice of unlawful policing at large-scale protests dating back to at least 2003.  Many of the \nindividual plaintiffs have attended multiple protests where unconstitutional policing is alleged to \nhave occurred, and at least two were arrested twice.  (Sow A.C. ¶¶ 220-27, 310-30; Payne A.C. ¶¶ \n124, 138-39, 181, 201.)  Those allegations of repeated unlawful conduct, combined with the sheer \nvolume of violations alleged by Plaintiffs, are sufficient for the Court to conclude that the \npossibility of an encounter with the NYPD, and with NYPD policies, is far from speculative.  See \nStauber v. City of New York, 2004 WL 1593870, at *18-19 (S.D.N.Y. 2004); Roe v. City of New \nYork, 151 F. Supp. 2d 495, 502-03 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (collecting cases). \nThe Sierra plaintiff also have standing to pursue their claim for declaratory relief.  They \ndo not seek an injunction or declaratory relief relating to future conduct – they seek only a \ndeclaration that past conduct was unlawful.  They allege that they were victims of that past conduct.  \nAccordingly, they have standing to assert that claim. \nC.  Injunctive and Declaratory Relief Claims Are Not Moot \n“[A]t all times, the dispute before the court must be real and live, not feigned, academic, \nor conjectural.” Russman v. Bd. of Educ., 260 F.3d 114, 118 (2d Cir. 2001). “When the issues in \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 10 of 45\ndispute between the parties ‘are no longer live,’ a case becomes moot.” Lillbask ex rel. Mauclaire \nv. State of Conn. Dep't of Educ., 397 F.3d 77, 84 (2d Cir. 2005) (quoting Powell v. McCormack, \n395 U.S. 486, 496 (1969)). Therefore, even if standing exists when the plaintiff files the complaint, \nthis Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction if it concludes that the case is moot. Fox v. Bd. of Trs. \nof State Univ. of N.Y., 42 F.3d 135, 140 (2d Cir. 1994). \nHere,  Defendants  contend  that  Plaintiffs’  claims  for  forward-looking  injunctive  and \ndeclaratory relief are moot because the City has already taken steps to address police misconduct \nand, as a result, there is no expectation that the events of last summer will recur.  The Court \ndisagrees.   \n“It is well settled that a defendant’s voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not \ndeprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.”  Friends of the Earth, \nInc. v. Laidlaw Env’t Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000) (quotation omitted).  Cessation \nof allegedly illegal activities can moot a claim only “if the defendant can demonstrate that (1) there \nis no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation with recur and (2) interim relief or events \nhave completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.”  Seidmann v. \nBowen, 499 F.3d 119, 128 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Granite State Outdoor Advert., Inc. v. Town of \nOrange, Conn., 303 F.3d 450, 451 (2d Cir. 2002)).  “The heavy burden of persuading the court \nthat the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to start up again lies with the party \nasserting mootness.”  Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 189 (cleaned up). \nDefendants have not met that burden.  A majority of the so-called voluntary reforms – \nwhich include a new disorder control training for officers, several draft policies that are not yet in \neffect, and other initiatives marked as “in progress” (see Goykadosh Decl. Exs. A, B, C, I, J) – are \nnot finalized.  The fact that reforms remain under consideration does not moot the issues presented \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 11 of 45\nin these cases for the straightforward reason that they are not yet in effect, and Defendants’ \n“prospective intentions do not eradicate[] the effects” of the alleged unconstitutional policing.    \nSaba v. Cuomo, No. 20-cv-5958, 2021 WL 1600496, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 23, 2021).  Neither does \nthe new disorder control training, which the NYPD adopted sometime between July and October \n2020. (People A.C. ¶¶ 106-07.)  Plaintiffs have alleged instances of police misconduct since then, \nincluding in the days after the 2020 presidential election and on January 18, 2021, notwithstanding \nthe implementation of that training.  (Id. ¶¶ 68-69, 71).  Defendants cannot sincerely assert that the \nchallenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to recur when it has, in fact, recurred.   \nTo the extent Defendants argue that certain measures taken by the City were not voluntary, \nbut instead were taken in response to Governor Cuomo’s June 2020 orders requiring the City to \nconduct  a  review  of  the  NYPD’s  response  to  the  protests:  Those  measures  amount  to  the \ndevelopment of three draft plans for reform, the latest of which the City Council recently adopted.  \n(Goykadosh Decl. Ex. G, H, I.)  But even the plan adopted by the City Council is still just a plan; \nits objectives, which include “the decriminalization of poverty,” “recognition and continual \nexamination of . . . racialized policing,” and “a diverse, resilient, and supportive NYPD” have not \nyet come to fruition.  It remains to be seen whether any of the concrete practices that will eventually \nbe adopted pursuant to the plan will have any impact on the behavior that Plaintiffs allege is \nunconstitutional.   \nAccordingly, the Court declines to dismiss the claims for injunctive and declaratory relief \nas moot. \nD.  The State of New York Has Parens Patriae Standing \nDefendants argue next that the Attorney General’s amended complaint must be dismissed \nbecause the State does not have standing in parens patriae to sue on behalf of its citizens. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 12 of 45\nThere are three requirements for a state to have standing to sue on behalf of its citizens, \notherwise known as parens patriae standing: (a) injury to a sufficient number of state citizens; (b) \na quasi-sovereign interest and (c) a barrier to individual plaintiffs obtaining complete relief.  New \nYork v. Griepp, 991 F.3d 81, 131 (2d Cir. 2021).  Defendants concede that the first requirement is \nsatisfied, but argue that the State cannot satisfy the other two prongs. \n“Courts routinely acknowledge that a state has a quasi-sovereign interest in the health and \nwell-being – both physical and economic – of its residents.”  Griepp, 991 F.3d at 132.  Of particular \nrelevance here is the State’s interest in “the prevention of lawless exercises of the powers its laws \nconfer upon police officers.”  Pennsylvania v. Porter, 659 F.2d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 1981) (en banc); \nsee also New York v. Town of Wallkill, No. 01-Civ-0364 (CM), 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13364, at \n*9 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 16, 2001).  That is precisely the interest that the State seeks to vindicate, as is \nevident from its claims under Section 1983 for excessive force, unlawful seizure and First \nAmendment violations, as well as parallel claims under the New York State Constitution. \nDefendants recognize this interest, but contend that the State’s interest is “misplaced” \nbecause it is already being furthered through means other than litigation.  For example, Defendants \ncite to the DOI’s and the New York City Corporation Counsel’s review of the NYPD’s response \nto the protests, and assert that Mayor de Blasio and Commissioner Shea have accepted and are in \nthe process of implementing the recommendations resulting from those reviews.  Defendants also \npoint to steps that the New York State legislature has taken, including the establishment of a law \nenforcement misconduct investigative office.  The Court, however, is not persuaded that a \nbackward-looking review process is sufficient to negate the State’s interest in protecting its citizens \nagainst future constitutional violations. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 13 of 45\nThe State also satisfies the third prong of parens patriae standing, inadequacy of individual \nsuits.  The Second Circuit has confirmed that this requirement is satisfied “when it is difficult and \ncostly to litigate claims, and when the interests of individuals are not necessarily coextensive with \nthose of the public.”  Griepp, 991 F.3d at 192 (internal quotations omitted).  The numerous and \ncomplex issues presented in this lawsuit, coupled with the sheer breadth of relief that the State \nseeks, make it apparent that the State’s claims require resources and expertise that private parties \noften lack.  Although the Payne and Sow plaintiffs also seek injunctive relief, the relief sought by \nthe State is far broader – it covers not only protesters, but also journalists, legal observers, medics, \nand others.  Moreover, as the case law recognizes, private litigants “have greater incentive to \ncompromise requests for injunctive relief in exchange for increased money damages.”  People v. \nPeter & John’s Pump House, 914 F. Supp 809, 813 (N.D.N.Y. 1996).  The State, which seeks only \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, faces no such conflict. \nNew York State has thus satisfied all three requirements for asserting parens patriae \nstanding. \nII.  Rule 12(b)(6) \nA.  Legal Standard \nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), “a complaint must contain sufficient \nfactual matter . . . to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. \nCt. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). “A claim \nhas facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the \nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at \n1949 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556).  \n“While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed \nfactual allegations, a plaintiff’s obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 14 of 45\nrequires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of \naction will not do.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (internal quotations, citations, and alterations \nomitted). Thus, unless a plaintiff’s well-pleaded allegations have “nudged [its] claims across the \nline from conceivable to plausible, [the plaintiff’s] complaint must be dismissed.” Id. at 570; Iqbal, \n129 S. Ct. at 1950–51. The Court must accept all factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable \ninferences in Plaintiff’s favor. ATSI Commc’ns., Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 F.3d 87, 98 (2d Cir. \n2007). \nB.  Application \nDefendants do not move to dismiss the complaints on grounds that no constitutional \nviolations occurred during the BLM protests.  They argue that the complaints should be dismissed \nbecause (1) the demonstrations took place while the City was navigating a pandemic; (2) police \nofficers as well as civilians were beaten and injured in the protests; and (3) NYPD is in the process \nof implementing changes to its policies concerning the policing of protests.  \nListing these “reasons” for dismissing the complaints makes it clear that Defendants are \nnot seeking to have these actions dismissed in their entirety for failure to file “well pleaded” \ncomplaints. \nInstead, Defendants move to dismiss on the much more limited basis that Plaintiffs have \nfailed to state their federal constitutional claims against the City, Mayor de Blasio, Commissioner \nShea, and Chief Monahan on the ground that there is no theory of liability under which the four \nmoving defendants can be held responsible for the actions of individual NYPD officers.   \n1.  Municipal Liability \nDefendants first argue that the City cannot be held liable for the actions of individual \nNYPD officers because Plaintiffs have not satisfied the requirements for pleading municipal \nliability under Monell v. Department of Social Services., 436 U.S. 658 (1978). \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 15 of 45\nTo hold a city liable under § 1983 for the unconstitutional actions of its employees, a \nplaintiff is required to plead and prove three elements: “(1) an official policy or custom that (2) \ncauses the plaintiff to be subjected to (3) a denial of a constitutional right.”  Wray v. City of New \nYork, 490 F.3d 189, 195 (2d Cir. 2007) (cleaned up).  “Constitutional deprivations actionable under \n§ 1983 need not be contained in an explicitly adopted rule or regulation.”  Sorlucco v. New York \nCity Police Dep’t, 971 F.2d 864, 870 (2d Cir. 1992).  But “a municipality may not be held liable \nunder § 1983 simply for the isolated unconstitutional acts of its employees.”  Id.  The “official \npolicy” requirement may be met by alleging, among other things, (1) a practice so “persistent and \nwidespread,” or “permanent and well settled as to constitute a ‘custom or usage’ with the force of \nlaw” and to “imply the constructive knowledge of policymaking officials,” id. at 870-71 (citing \nCity of St. Louis v. Prapotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 113 (1988) (plurality)); (2) “deliberate indifference \nto the rights of those with whom [the employees] come into contact,” City of Canton v. Harris, \n489  U.S.  378,  388  (1989);  or  (3)  “actions  taken  by  government  officials  responsible  for \nestablishing municipal policies that caused the particular deprivation in question,” Kucharczyk v. \nWestchester Cty., 95 F. Supp. 3d 529, 538 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). \nDefendants do not contest that plaintiffs have alleged facts tending to support the second \nand third elements of municipal liability (causation and the denial of a constitutional right).  They \nmove to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Monell claims on the basis that Plaintiffs have not alleged an official \npolicy or custom, for the following three reasons: (1) Defendants have not admitted to any \nunconstitutional policies; (2) Plaintiffs allege no formal policy; and (3) Plaintiffs have not pleaded \nthe existence of a de facto policy, supported by allegations of an unofficial policy or custom or \npolicymakers’ deliberate indifference. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 16 of 45\nAt  the  pre-answer  juncture,  Defendants’  arguments  are  not  convincing.  Whether \nDefendants have admitted to the unconstitutionality of their practices is irrelevant.  And with the \nexception of the Sow plaintiffs’ claim relating to the curfew orders, Plaintiffs do not purport to \nallege that the NYPD has a formal, written policy directing officers to violate the constitutional \nrights of protesters. But  Plaintiffs do allege the existence of an official albeit unwritten policy or \ncustom, which can be discerned from (1) a widespread pattern of the complained-of practices that \nextends back many years; and (2) a persistent failure to train and supervise NYPD officers in the \nproper policing of protests.  \ni.  All Plaintiffs Have Stated Claims For Municipal Liability Predicated On The \nUse of Force And Mass Arrests \na.  Custom or Policy \nThe Attorney General and the Payne, Wood, Sierra, and Sow plaintiffs plead specific facts \nfrom which, if proven, would allow a trier of fact to conclude that NYPD officers engaged in a \nvariety of practices that constituted false arrest, excessive force or retaliation for the exercise of \nFirst Amendment rights.   \nTo make out a custom, policy or practice claim with respect to the NYPD’s use of excessive \nforce and mass arrests of protesters, these five groups of plaintiffs point to NGO reports that \ndocument accounts of police misconduct at anti-war protests in the early 2000s and during the \n2011  Occupy  Wall  Street  demonstrations,  targeted  at  protesters,  bystanders,  lawyers,  legal \nobservers, and journalists alike (People A.C. ¶¶ 25-26, 31, Sierra A.C. ¶ 9, 127; Sow A.C. ¶¶ 423, \n426); numerous lawsuits alleging incidences of police brutality against protesters, bystanders, legal \nobservers, and journalists (most of which were settled and some of which are ongoing) (People \nA.C. ¶ 32, Sow A.C. ¶¶ 428-29, Sierra A.C. ¶¶ 143-149); thousands of Civilian Complaint Review \nBoard (“CCRB”) complaints regarding the NYPD’s response to the protests that took place \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 17 of 45\nbetween May 28 and June 20, 2020 alone, as well as hundreds more dating back to 2003 (Payne \nA.C. ¶ 92, People A.C. ¶¶ 25, 34; Sow A.C. ¶ 120); the NYPD’s decision to deploy officers who \nwere the subjects of such lawsuits and CCRB complaints to the BLM protests as part of the \nNYPD’s Strategic Response Group (“SRG”) (Sow A.C. ¶¶ 451-55); NYAG, Human Rights Watch, \nCorporation  Counsel  and  Department  of  Investigation  (“DOI”)  investigations  and  reports \ndocumenting the police response to the BLM protests and protests past (Payne A.C. ¶¶ 95-106, \nPeople A.C. ¶¶ 73-97, 106-07, 276-97, Sierra A.C. ¶ 147; Wood A.C. ¶ 176; Sow A.C. ¶¶ 7, 120)5; \nand, of course, the individual incidents alleged in the complaints.  Plaintiffs contend that these \nfactual allegations are sufficient to plead that the NYPD had long had a widespread practice of \nemploying excessive force to police large demonstrations throughout New York City – a practice \nso persistent and long-standing that Mayor de Blasio, Commissioner Shea and Chief Monahan can \nbe imputed with constructive knowledge of its existence.  The Court agrees. \nDefendants also contend that Plaintiffs have merely identified a series of isolated acts that \nare insufficient to demonstrate a municipal custom that would justify the imposition of municipal \nliability.  They argue that the practices that Plaintiffs identify, including the alleged use of bikes, \nbatons, tasers, and pepper spray to assault and subdue protesters, shoving and punching, are too \nnumerous to give rise to a unified pattern of police misconduct. \n \n5 \"In reviewing a motion to dismiss, a court may consider, inter alia, (1) documents that are \nincorporated by reference into the complaint, and (2) documents that, even if not incorporated by \nreference, the defendant has notice of and that are 'integral' to the complaint\" without converting \nthe motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment. BankUnited, N.A. v. Merrit Envtl. \nConsulting Corp., 360 F. Supp. 3d 172, 183 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (citing Weiss v. Inc. Vill. Of Sag \nHarbor, 762 F. Supp. 2d 560, 567 (E.D.N.Y. 2011); Cortec Indus., Inc. v. Sum Holding L.P., 949 \nF.2d 42, 47–48 (2d Cir. 1992).  The pleadings refer to and quote from these documents, making \nit proper to consider them in determining the motion. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 18 of 45\nBut Defendants do not cite a single case requiring this Court to narrow its view of the \nMonell claim to a single, individual tactic employed by police.  Plaintiffs allege that there exists a \nwidespread practice of trying to control crowds at protests – notably those with political overtones, \nwhich plainly implicated Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights – by employing excessive force \n(whether by baton or bicycle is irrelevant) and by making mass arrests without probable cause. \nThe fact that the complaints allege that excessive force was perpetrated in multiple ways and at \nmultiple protests does not alter the implications of the facts pleaded, which are that a variety of \ntactics were used to impede the Plaintiffs from exercising their right to protest or to punish them \nfor doing so.  \nEven if Plaintiffs were required to plead a discrete custom or policy for each individual \ntactic, their allegations would still be sufficient to state a claim for municipal liability.   \nFor example, the Payne amended complaint alleges that the NYPD kettled protesters to \nprevent them from dispersing at a significant number of demonstrations that occurred during the \nsummer and fall of 2020 – including on six separate occasions between May 28 and June 4, 2020 \nalone – all of which led to mass arrests without probable cause.  (A.C. ¶¶ 44, 47, 50, 55, 59, 74, \n76, 77, 78.)  The same pleading refers to additional instances of kettling that took place as long \nago as 2003 and 2004 during large-scale protests (id. ¶ 66) and cites to reports by the DOI and \nHuman Rights Watch, both of which highlighted the NYPD’s unwarranted use of this tactic (id. \n¶¶ 99, 105).  Drawing all inferences in favor of Plaintiffs, those allegations create a plausible \ninference of a custom or practice of the unwarranted use of kettling in order to effect the mass \narrests of peaceful protesters who were literally prevented from complying with the Mayor’s \ncurfew order.   \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 19 of 45\nThe Attorney General’s parens patriae complaint and the Sow plaintiffs’ complaint contain \nallegations concerning “kettling” that are nearly identical to those in Payne.  All three complaints \nalso plead specific instances of other practices – perfectly permissible police practices in the right \ncontext, such as the use of batons, bikes, and pepper spray – in an impermissible manner and/or \nfor impermissible purposes during the BLM protests.6 Again drawing all inferences in favor of the \npleader, those allegations are sufficient as well. \nIn short, Plaintiffs identify a number of police practices that were allegedly wrongfully \nused or abused during the BLM protests and pleads facts from which it could be inferred that this \nwas not some “one off” instance of misuse of these practices, but had been part and parcel of the \nNYPD’s “arsenal” for dealing with political protests for that past two decades. That sufficiently \npleads a custom or policy of using excessive force and making false arrests at large protests \nthroughout New York City.  \nb.  Deliberate Indifference \nThe  Attorney  General  and  the  Payne,  Wood,  Sierra,  and  Sow  plaintiffs  have  also \nadequately plead municipal liability under the theory that the City was deliberately indifferent to \nthe Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights during the BLM protests.   \nFailure To Train.  To allege such deliberate indifference based on a supervisor’s alleged \nfailure to train, a plaintiff must show an obvious need for more or better supervision to protect \nagainst  the  constitutional  violations,  which  may  be  inferred  from,  among  other  things,  a \ndemonstrated failure to train or supervise subordinates.  Vann v. City of New York, 72 F.3d 1040, \n1049 (2d Cir.1995). At the pleading stage, this means, at least in this Circuit, that a complaint \nalleging deliberate indifference must plead some facts that, if proven, would tend to show that (1) \n \n6 The Wood and Sierra plaintiffs’ amended complaints incorporate these allegations by \nreference.  (Wood A.C. at 5 n.1.; Sierra A.C. ¶¶ 146, 148, 149.) \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 20 of 45\na policymaker knows “to a moral certainty” that employees will confront a given situation; (2) \n“the situation either presents the employee with a difficult choice of the sort that training or \nsupervision will make less difficult or that there is a history of employees mishandling the situation \nand (3) “the wrong choice will frequently cause the deprivation of citizens’ constitutional rights.”  \nJenkins v. City of New York, 478 F.3d 76, 94 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Walker v. City of New York, \n974 F.3d 293, 297 (2d Cir. 1992)). \nThe facts pleaded and discussed above easily admit of the  following Jenkins/Walker \ninferences: (1) the police had encountered numerous similar protests in years past, (2) as a result, \nthe policymaker defendants had to know to a moral certainty that the BLM protests would result \nin certain types of behavior by the protesters that were likely to lead to certain types of responses \nby the police;  (3) there would be difficult policing decisions to make in trying to keep the protests \nunder control without violating the protesters’ First Amendment rights; (4) training police officers \nto deal with crowd control in these specific situations could make it easier for them to make the \nright decisions; and (5) making the wrong decision (i.e., by employing too much force) could result \nin  depriving  protesters  of  their  constitutional  rights.  Indeed,  the  essence  of  the  deliberate \nindifference allegations in the complaint is that these situations arise repeatedly in New York City, \nyet the NYPD – despite years of litigation and complaints involving police behavior at mass \npolitical protests – still  has not come up with a way to train its officers to control crowds without \nviolating constitutional rights. Again, viewing these allegations in the light most favorable to \nPlaintiffs, the Court concludes that the five complaints sufficiently allege municipal liability under \na “deliberate indifference” theory. See Bertuglia v. City of New York, 839 F. Supp. 2d 703, 738–\n39 (S.D.N.Y. 2012).   \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 21 of 45\nDefendants argue that the COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed the nature of the \nprotests that took place in the summer and fall of 2020, and so the City could not have known that \nNYPD officers would (1) confront protesters with violence, (2) conduct mass arrests, and (3) \nrefuse to wear masks in violation of state law.  But the plaintiffs do not allege that the NYPD \nhandled the BLM protests differently because of the pandemic. Quite the contrary: masks aside, \nthe behaviors alleged to be unconstitutional in these complaints are exactly the same behaviors \nthat were alleged against the same police force in connection with the demonstrations in 2003, \nduring the 2004 Republican National Convention, and during the 2011 Occupy Wall Street \nprotests, when there was no pandemic. The pandemic did not lessen the plaintiffs’ right to engage \nin First Amendment protected behavior, see Roman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo, 141 S.Ct. 63 \n(2020); neither did it divest them of their right to be free from excessive force or from arrest \nwithout probable cause.  In their pleadings, Plaintiffs are not “taking the pandemic out of the \nequation,” as Defendants contend.  Rather, they allege the existence of a decades-old problem, one \nthat existed prior to the pandemic and that was allegedly dealt with in the same way before and \nduring the pandemic.7 Defendants’ invocation of the pandemic is a total red herring.   \nTo the extent that Defendants argue that there were differences between the BLM protests \nof 2020 and the protests that took place in 2003, 2004 and 2011 – and that these differences \nrendered conduct that might have been unlawful during the earlier protests lawful in this instance – \nthat is not an appropriate argument for a motion to dismiss, which is addressed to the sufficiency \n \n7 In 2015, the OIG issued a report acknowledging the NYPD’s need for improved training on the \nuse of force and de-escalation tactics, though the report was not limited to the use of those tactics \nto control protests.  The report found that the NYPD’s “use-of-force police was vague and \nimprecise;” its “training programs did not adequately focus on de-escalation”; and it “frequently \nfailed to impose discipline even when provided with evidence of excessive force.”  (People A.C. \n¶ 33.) \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 22 of 45\nof the allegations of the complaint, not the sufficiency of the evidence. Perhaps it is an argument \nthat can be made on a motion for summary judgment or at trial. But it goes well beyond the four \ncorners of the pleadings and would require consideration of evidence in connection with a motion \nwhere evidence is not relevant. The only issue is whether the inference the plaintiffs seek to have \nthe trier of fact draw from their allegations is plausible. It is. Whether Plaintiffs’ suggested \ninference is the only inference that can be drawn, or the best inference that can be drawn, is a \nquestion for another day.   \nFinally,  Defendants  assert  that  Plaintiffs  cannot  satisfy  the  third  prong  of  the \nJenkins/Walker test – which asks whether the wrong choice will frequently cause the deprivation \nof constitutional rights – because there has only been one liability verdict arising out of an alleged \nconstitutional violation stemming from a protest (in that case, against Monahan arising out of the \n2004 RNC protests).  But that is absurd. Plaintiffs have alleged that hundreds of other lawsuits \nwere brought and settled out of court prior to trial, while others are ongoing.  Defendants certainly \nknew to a moral certainty that the employment of the kind of crowd control tactics that were used \nduring the 2003-04 and 2011 protests would lead to allegations of constitutional violations – \nallegations that would result in numerous lawsuits, which would likely not be dismissed on motion. \nThe fact that the lawsuits were settled goes only to the weight to be afforded to Plaintiffs’ evidence.  \nSee Medina v. City of New York, No. 19-cv-9412 (AJN), 2020 WL 7028688, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. \n30, 2020).  \nDefendants will have an opportunity at an appropriate time to argue that Plaintiffs have \nfailed to prove any history of employee mismanagement. But at this stage, the issue is only whether \nthe well pleaded facts alleged by the Plaintiffs – which are presumed true by the Court – “allows \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 23 of 45\nthe court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged,” \nIqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949.  The answer is yes. \nRatification.  The Attorney General and the Payne, Sow, and Wood plaintiffs also allege \nthat Defendants acted with deliberate indifference to their constitutional rights by implicitly \nratifying their subordinates’ unconstitutional conduct.  Jones v. Town of E. Haven, 691 F.3d 72, \n81 (2d Cir. 2012).  Because “the disposition of the policymaker may be inferred from his conduct \nafter the events giving rise to the constitutional violation.” Collins v. City of New York, 923 F. \nSupp. 2d 462, 477 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (brackets omitted) (quoting Grandstaff v. City of Borger, 767 \nF.2d 161, 170 (5th Cir. 1985)), “deliberate indifference may be inferred if the complaints [of \nwrongdoing] are followed by no meaningful attempt on the part of the municipality to investigate \nor to forestall further incidents,” Vann, 72 F.3d at 1049, or from allegations that policymakers \n“repeatedly condoned and even rewarded” unlawful police conduct, Batista v. Rodriguez, 702 F.2d \n393, 397 (2d Cir. 1983).  Like any other theory of deliberate indifference, “The operative inquiry \nis whether the facts suggest that the policymaker’s inaction was a result of ‘conscious choice’ \nrather than mere negligence.”  Amnesty Am. v. Town of West Hartford, 361 F.3d 113, 128 (2d Cir. \n2004) (citing City of Canton, Ohio v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 389 (1989)). \nPlaintiffs allege that the policymaker defendants ratified the unlawful actions taken by \nNYPD officers when they made the following statements praising and defending their actions: \nAfter an NYPD truck drove into a crowd of protesters, Mayor de Blasio stated on May 30, 2020, \n“I do believe the NYPD has acted appropriately.”  (Payne A.C. ¶ 48.)  On May 31, 2020, \nCommissioner Shea tweeted, “In no small way, I want you to know that I’m extremely proud of \nthe way you’ve comported yourselves in the face of such persistent danger.”  (Payne A.C. ¶ 49.)  \nAnd after the Mott Haven protest on June 4, 2020, Commissioner Shea publicly stated that the \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 24 of 45\nNYPD “had a plan which was executed nearly flawlessly” (People A.C. ¶ 387, Wood A.C. ¶ 7, \nSow A.C. ¶ 187, Payne A.C. ¶ 69.)   \nIn addition to these statements, the plaintiffs allege that Defendants have shown deliberate \nindifference by failing to discipline officers in any meaningful way.  They allege numerous \ninstances of the NYPD’s ignoring CCRB disciplinary recommendations following complaints of \npolice misconduct.  (People A.C. ¶¶ 34-36.)  Notably, they allege that the NYPD failed to \ndiscipline then-Deputy Chief Monahan after he directed the use of force and mass arrests without \nprobable cause to subdue protesters at the 2004 RNC protest; instead, he was eventually promoted \nto Chief of Department, and in that capacity directed the use of the same strategies against the \nMott Haven protesters on June 4, 2020.  (People A.C. ¶ 29; Wood A.C. ¶¶ 114-15.) With respect \nto the BLM protests, they allege that at most, three officers have been disciplined for their actions – \nand none for their actions during the Mott Haven protest – a shockingly low number given the \nvolume of allegations of police misconduct throughout the BLM protests.  (People A.C. ¶¶ 37, \n298; Wood A.C. ¶186; Sow A.C. ¶ 507.) \nIn support of their deliberate indifference claim, the Sow plaintiffs also allege that the \nNYPD repeatedly deployed a specialized unit called the Strategic Response Group (“SRG”) to \npolice the BLM protests, notwithstanding the fact that many members of SRG, including many \nwho were at the BLM protests, have faced CCRB complaints and lawsuits stemming from their \nprior use of the same policing tactics complained of in these lawsuits.  (Sow A.C. ¶¶ 440-45.)  They \nallege further that, in the past, the NYPD created “after-action reports” that documented and \nanalyzed plans for and responses to protests in the early 2000s; that some of the reports praised \n \n8 The Payne plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 27 – 32 of the Attorney General’s amended \ncomplaint into their own.  (Payne A.C. ¶ 219.) \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 25 of 45\nofficers for using “militarized tactics”; and that after several of those reports were made public \nduring the course of the litigation over the 2004 RNC protests, they NYPD stopped creating these \nreports altogether.  (Id. ¶¶ 451-55.)   \nTaken together, these allegations give rise to an inference that Defendants ratified the \nactions taken by the NYPD by publicly praising, failing to discipline, and, at times, even rewarding \nofficers for their conduct. \nIn their motion to dismiss, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs’ own allegations preclude an \ninference that the municipality ratified officers’ unlawful conduct.  They point to the Corporation \nCounsel and DOI investigations, both of which were undertaken at the direction of Mayor de \nBlasio, as well as to a handful of statements made by the Mayor in which he, according to \nDefendants, condemned the NYPD’s behavior. 9 \nDefendants rely on one statement in particular.  During a June 4 press conference, a reporter \nasked Mayor de Blasio about a widely circulated video showing NYPD officers hitting protesters \nwith batons at a protest on June 3.  When asked if he condoned the officers’ behavior, the Mayor \ndenied having seen the video (though it was allegedly shown to him the previous night), and \nresponded: “It is the nature of New York City and the restraint shown by the NYPD that we’re \ntrying to give people extra space, if they do it the right way – if they respect the instructions of the \nNYPD and do no violence, no harm – don’t commit any violence.”  (Payne A.C. ¶ 56; Wood A.C. \n¶¶ 182-83.)  Defendants insist that this statement shows that the Mayor disapproved of the officers’ \nuse of force.   \n \n9 Defendants mention several other reforms that the City is undertaking, and argue that it is only \na matter of time before more officers are disciplined for their role in policing the BLM protests.  \nNone of those remedial measures is contained within the four corners of the complaints; they \ncannot properly be considered at this stage. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 26 of 45\nBut it is also plausible to infer from that statement that Mayor de Blasio chose to ignore \nwidely circulated evidence of the alleged use of excessive force by the police, and instead lauded \nofficers for their “restraint.” Plaintiffs are, for now, entitled to the latter inference.   \nAs to the investigations and the remaining statements: The Mayor directed DOI to conduct \na review of the NYPD’s response to the BLM protests on May 31, 2020 (Goykadosh Decl. Ex. D \nat 2), and directed the Corporation Counsel’s office to do the same on June 20, 2020 (Goykadosh \nDecl. Ex. E at 1).  Those investigations led to the DOI and Corporation Counsel reports relied upon \nin the pleadings.  The Attorney General’s complaint also alleges that, on June 5, 2020, Mayor de \nBlasio told a reporter that he “did not like everything [he] saw in the videos” of the NYPD’s \nresponse  to  the  Mott  Haven  protest  (People  A.C.  ¶  101),  and  on  December  18,  2020,  he \nacknowledged a need for better training (id. ¶ 110).  These factual allegations may very well \nsuggest that the Mayor eventually took steps to address the behavior on which these lawsuits are \npredicated.  However, drawing all inferences in favor of Plaintiffs at the pre-answer stage,  a trier \nof fact could plausibly infer, from the allegations regarding the City’s long history of inaction, that \nthe City maintained a policy of deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights leading \nup to and during the first few days of the BLM protests. \nThe Attorney General and the Payne, Wood, Sierra, and Sow plaintiffs have therefore \nstated a claim for municipal liability.10 \n \n10 In addition to the claims described above, the Sierra plaintiffs also allege that the City has a \npolicy of racially biased policing, and that such policy caused a disproportionate number of \nminority arrests during the BLM protests, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \nDefendants do not address this claim in their motion to dismiss; neither do Plaintiffs in their \nopposition.  It remains in the case.   \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 27 of 45\nFinally the City moves to dismiss the Yates complaint to the extent its municipal liability \nclaim is predicated on a policy of using excessive force and mass arrests to effect crowd control at \nprotests. \nYates alleges that he participated in a protest on May 31, 2020, during which NYPD \nofficers surrounded and charged at protesters, hit him with their batons, and detained him without \nprobable cause.  (Yates Compl. ¶¶ 13-31.)  He alleges that similar unconstitutional tactics were \nused against others at protests on May 29 and June 2, and at two protests on June 4.  (Id. ¶ \n23.)  Other than that, his allegations of a widespread practice of police misconduct are limited to \nthe following conclusory statement: “In the protest in this matter, as well as the protests listed \nabove,  and  in  decades  worth  of  prior  protests,  the  NYPD  has  allowed  its  officers  to \nindiscriminately use force on peaceful protesters, including allowing random baton strikes on \npeaceful protesters.”  (Id. ¶ 24.)  The detailed factual allegations that characterize the other \nplaintiff’s pleadings are conspicuously missing.    \nIf Yates were the only case pending, I might well conclude that Plaintiff’s allegations of \npolice misconduct at five protests during a single week in 2020, coupled with the purely conclusory \nallegation that similar conduct occurred at an unspecified number of protests in past decades, \nwithout more, was insufficient to plead a claim that the NYPD has a widespread practice of \nengaging in practices that constituted excessive force, false arrest, or retaliation when confronting \nprotesters.  See Felix v. City of New York, 344 F. Supp. 3d 644, 659 (S.D.N.Y. 2018); Kucharczyk \nv. Westchester Cty., 95 F. Supp. 3d 529, 543 (S.D.N.Y. 2015).  However, Yates is not the only \ncase; I would have to dismiss without prejudice, because the municipal liability claims it asserts \nare not time barred; and all that will happen is that Yates’ counsel will refile, parroting the \nallegations that have already been found to be sufficient in the other cases. Rather than subject us \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 28 of 45\nall to the possibility of yet another round of preliminary motions in connection with what is, in \nessence, a copycat case, I conclude, in the context of this consolidated set of cases, that the Yates \npleading gets across the line. I reach the same conclusion with respect to the deliberate indifference \ntheory of municipal liability, because there is no principled basis to dismiss the Yates complaint \nwhen it is perfectly clear that all plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Defendants knew “to a \nmoral certainty” that NYPD officers would confront certain types of behavior from protesters that \nwould require them to make difficult policing decisions, that the wrong decision could result in \nthe deprivation of protesters’ constitutional rights, or that training officers in ways to manage the \ncrowds without violating the First Amendment could make it easier for those officers to make the \nright decision. See Jenkins v. City of New York, 478 F.3d 76, 94 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Walker v. \nCity of New York, 974 F.3d 293, 297 (2d Cir. 1992)).  The City is not wrong that Yates could (and \nshould) have done a better job of crafting a pleading, but – again in the context of all the other \ncases being litigated – it is clear enough what is alleged.  \nii.  Allegations Unique to the Sow Plaintiffs \nThe Sow plaintiffs assert several additional grounds for holding the City liable under \nMonell.  \nThey allege that the City had an official policy of enforcing curfew orders selectively and \nwithout first ensuring that protesters were given an order to disperse.  The curfew order itself \nprovides, “Failure to comply with this Order shall result in orders to disperse, and any person who \nknowingly violates the provisions in this Order shall be guilty of a Class B misdemeanor.”  The \nSow plaintiffs suggest that individual officers did not give dispersal orders and ask the trier of fact \nto infer that this was official city policy.   \nNothing in the Constitution requires that police give a dispersal order once a curfew is in \neffect before arresting a violator for a curfew violation. However, failing to give such an order, \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 29 of 45\nespecially where, as here, one is explicitly required, may be relevant evidence in connection with \na claim of false arrest.  See Dinler v. City of New York, 2012 WL 4513352, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. \n30, 2012).   \nBut that does not mean the City can be held liable for the failure to give dispersal orders \non the ground that not giving them prior to arrest was “city policy.” There is not a single factual \nallegation in the complaint tending to show that it was official City policy that no dispersal order \nbe given.  The text of the order is the best evidence of the City’s official policy, and the text of the \ncurfew order says that dispersal orders should be given.  There is no allegation that the Mayor, or \nChief Monahan, or Commissioner Shea ever told a single police officer to ignore what the curfew \norder said, so no municipal liability can be inferred from their behavior.  What the Sow plaintiffs \nallege is that individual officers ignored official City policy when enforcing the curfew order.  That \ncannot be a basis for Monell liability. \nThe Sow plaintiffs alternatively allege that the City should be held liable under Monell \nbecause they failed to train NYPD officers to enforce the curfew order in accordance with its terms.  \nThat is encompassed by the failure to train argument already discussed (see supra, pp. 19-22).  The \nevidence will point one way or another.  But failure to train evincing deliberate indifference is the \nonly conceivable basis for Monell liability predicated on the failure to give a dispersal order.  \nOfficial City policy it was not. \nFinally,  the  Sow  plaintiffs  allege  that  the  City  was  deliberately  indifferent  to  their \nconstitutional rights because it failed to train officers in proper mask wearing protocols, resulting \nin many officers not wearing, or not properly wearing, masks during the BLM demonstrations.  \nThe City has yet to address the possibility that protesters did not have a  constitutional right to (i) \nhave police officers wear their masks properly, or (ii) have the City train them to do so (a purely \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 30 of 45\nconclusory allegation on the part of the Sow plaintiffs). So the Court will not visit this issue at \npresent; I simply flag it for future reference. \n2.  Claims Against the Individual Defendants in Their Official Capacities \nThe  Attorney  General  and  the  Payne  and  Sow  plaintiffs  sue  Mayor  de  Blasio, \nCommissioner  Shea  and  Chief  Monahan  in  both  their  official  and  individual  capacities.  \nDefendants move to dismiss the claims brought against these three individual defendants in their \nofficial capacities on grounds that those claims are redundant of the municipal claims against the \nCity. \n“[O]fficial-capacity suits generally represent only another way of pleading an action \nagainst an entity of which an officer is an agent.” Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 691 \nn. 55 (1978).  “Where the governmental entity can itself be held liable for damages as a result of \nits official policy, a suit naming the legislators in their official capacity is redundant.”  Schubert v. \nCity of Rye, 775 F. Supp. 2d 689, 699 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (quoting Rini v. Zwirn, 886 F. Supp. 270, \n281 (E.D.N.Y. 1995)).  Accordingly, courts in the Second Circuit routinely dismiss official \ncapacity claims against municipal officials as duplicative of the claims against the municipality.  \nSee Phillips v. Cty. Of Orange, 894 F. Supp. 2d 345, 384 n.35 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (collecting cases). \nThe claims against de Mayor de Blasio, Commissioner Shea and Chief Monahan in their \nofficial capacities are, therefore, dismissed. \n3.  Claims Against the Individual Defendants in Their Individual Capacities \nAll but the Yates plaintiffs sue Mayor de Blasio, Commissioner Shea and Chief Monahan \nin  their  individual  capacities.    Defendants  contend  that  the  claims  against  them  alleging \nconstitutional violations should be dismissed because Plaintiffs have not adequately pled any \ntheory, including supervisory liability, on which they could be held liable. They also bring a motion \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 31 of 45\nfor qualified immunity addressed to one set of claims: the Sow plaintiffs’ claims arising out of the \nissuance and enforcement of the two curfew orders.  \n“Because vicarious liability is inapplicable to . . . § 1983 suits, a plaintiff must plead that \neach Government-official defendant, through the official's own individual actions, has violated the \nConstitution.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 676. In other words, “a plaintiff must plead and prove the \nelements of the underlying constitutional violation directly against the official.” Tangreti v. \nBachmann, 983 F.3d 609, 620 (2d Cir. 2020). Prior to Tangreti, the Second Circuit held that the \nfollowing could establish a defendant's personal involvement: \n1)  the  defendant  participated  directly  in  the  alleged  constitutional  violation,  (2)  the \ndefendant, after being informed of the violation through a report or appeal, failed to remedy \nthe wrong, (3) the defendant created a policy or custom under which unconstitutional \npractices occurred, or allowed the continuance of such a policy or custom, (4) the defendant \nwas grossly negligent in supervising subordinates who committed the wrongful acts, or (5) \nthe defendant exhibited deliberate indifference to the rights of inmates by failing to act on \ninformation indicating that unconstitutional acts were occurring. \n \nGrullon v. City of New Haven, 720 F.3d 133, 139 (2d Cir. 2013). But in Tangreti, the Second \nCircuit rejected “a special test for supervisory liability.” 983 F.3d at 620. Since Tangreti, whatever \nthe alleged constitutional violation may be, “[t]he violation must be established against the \nsupervisory official directly.” Id. at 618.  A plaintiff must therefore allege facts that would, if \nproven, establish the government official’s personal involvement in the violation of the plaintiff’s \nrights.  Celestin v. Angletta, No. 19 CV 1887 (NSR), 2021 WL 1062344, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 19, \n2021). \n  I turn first to a discussion of all claims other than the Sow plaintiffs’ claims relating to the \nissuance and enforcement of the curfew orders. I will discuss those claims separately (see infra., \npp. 34 et seq.).  \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 32 of 45\ni.  Claims Common to All Plaintiffs \nPlaintiffs have pleaded facts tending to show Chief Monahan’s personal involvement in \npolice activity at two of the protest events.  They allege that he was present at and personally led \nthe NYPD’s response to the June 4 protest in Mott Haven, where he personally directed officers \nto kettle, subdue and arrest protesters. (People A.C. ¶¶ 292-96, Sierra A.C. ¶ 46, Wood A.C. ¶¶ \n124-26, Sow A.C. ¶ 87, 121, Payne A.C. ¶¶ 63, 65).  They also allege that Chief Monahan \npersonally approved the mass use of pepper spray against protesters at the Barclays Center on May \n29, 2020. (People A.C. ¶ 200.)  Those allegations raise an inference of his personal involvement \nin alleged violations of Plaintiffs’ rights.  Defendants do not move to dismiss on grounds that those \nactions were unconstitutional. Nor does Chief Monahan move to dismiss claims arising out of \nthese allegations on the ground of qualified immunity (a much more limited qualified immunity \nmotion will be discussed in greater detail infra). \nThe Attorney General and the Payne, Wood, and Sierra plaintiffs have also stated a claim \nagainst Mayor de Blasio, insofar as they allege that he was personally involved  in the development \nof the tactics employed by the NYPD that they allege to be unconstitutional.  He allegedly admitted \nto having seen videos of the clashes between police and protesters and had personnel present at \nseveral of the protests.  (Wood A.C. ¶ 95.)  They further allege that he personally approved the \nstrategies employed by the NYPD beginning during the June 3 and June 4 protests: During a June \n7 press conference, de Blasio was asked, “Did you approve the tactics that we saw at [sic] the \nNYPD using, starting on June 3rd and June 4th?  That’s the use of batons, more sort of pushing at \nprotests, that kind of thing?  Did you approve those?”  He responded, “I approved the broad \nstrategies and sometimes very specific choices.”  (People A.C. ¶ 101, Sierra A.C. ¶ 45, Wood A.C. \n¶ 93; Payne ¶ 73.)  This gets the plaintiffs past a motion to dismiss. Whether this claim against the \nMayor survives a motion for summary judgment after discovery remains to be seen.  \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 33 of 45\nBut no plaintiff has stated a claim for individual liability against Commissioner Shea.  Their \nallegations amount to the following: Shea made several statements to the press indicating that he \nhad seen protest footage and was aware of the confrontations between police and protesters, \nincluding at a June 4 news conference, during which he “spoke about the NYPD’s purported \nadjustment of its tactics to the specific context of each protest, described in detail events at certain \nprotests the previous night, and explained that the NYPD had recently made a tactical adjustment \nconcerning vehicles” (Wood A.C. ¶ 84); he received regular reports from Chief Monahan and other \nNYPD officials responsible for implementing the City’s response to the protests (Payne A.C. ¶ \n91); he nonetheless failed to prevent NYPD officers from using the allegedly unconstitutional \ntactics, (People A.C. ¶¶ 102-03) and praised the NYPD’s handling of the protests – for example, \nhe described the NYPD’s operation in Mott Haven as “a plan which was executed nearly flawlessly \n(Payne A.C. ¶ 69) – and at times made statements to the press criticizing the protesters and their \ncalls to defund the police (id. ¶ 46).   \nThose allegations do not provide a sufficient basis from which this Court can infer that \nCommissioner  Shea  had  any  personal  involvement  in  the  alleged  violations  of  Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional rights.  With regard to the allegations that he learned of the misconduct, “Receipt of \nnotice after the violation is insufficient to constitute personal involvement in the violation.”  \nRahman v. Fisher, 607 F. Supp. 2d 580, 585 (S.D.N.Y. 2009).  His praise of the NYPD’s response \nsuggests only that he approved of their tactics after the fact – not that he had any role in designing \nthose tactics in the first place.  And while Plaintiffs allege in conclusory fashion that in some \ninstances the Commissioner “personally directed, promoted and/or condoned the deployments and \noperations that led to this violence,” (Payne A.C. ¶ 88), they plead no facts in support of that \nallegation.   \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 34 of 45\nFinally, to the extent Plaintiffs allege that the NYPD’s mistreatment of protesters resulted \nfrom Commissioner Shea’s failure to remedy the violations committed by individual officers: that \nis essentially a failure to intervene claim, and no plaintiff alleges that Commissioner Shea was \npresent at any of the protests or that he was in a position to intervene.  Cf. Correa v. Lynch, No. \n20-CV-02875 (PMH), 2021 WL 2036697, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2021). Conclusory allegations \nof “deliberate indifference,” without more, do not amount to personal involvement.  Brown v. Wetz, \nNo. 18CV11178(NSR), 2021 WL 964922, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 15, 2021). To the extent \nplaintiffs  ground  their  suggestion  of  personal  involvement  on  some  alleged  failure  by  the \nCommissioner to discipline officers after the fact for misconduct that occurred during the protests, \nthe argument obviously fails, as the Commissioner cannot be held liable for personal involvement \nin the allegedly unconstitutional actions that were perpetrated during the protests based on what \nhe did or did not do after the protests were over.  \nii.  The Sow Curfew Order Claims and the Limited Qualified Immunity Motion \nThe  Sow  plaintiffs  (and  only  the  Sow  plaintiffs)  allege  that  the  imposition  and  the \nenforcement of the curfew orders was unconstitutional. More specifically, they allege that the \ncurfew orders were unconstitutional on their face because they targeted protesters engaged in First \nAmendment expression, while exempting certain categories of workers deemed “essential.” (Sow \nA.C. ¶ 76.)  They also bring several as-applied challenges to the curfew orders: They allege that \n(1) the curfew orders were enforced against BLM protesters in retaliation for their anti-police \nviews (id. ¶ 547); (2) the curfew orders were selectively enforced against the BLM protesters (id. \n¶ 100); and (3) the curfew orders were vague and overbroad under the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment (id. ¶ 556).  They also allege that the curfew orders were unconstitutional \nas applied because protesters were not given clearly communicated dispersal orders or provided \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 35 of 45\nwith meaningful opportunity to disperse before they were arrested for violating the curfew.  (Id. \n¶¶ 96, 479.)  They assert these claims against all three supervisory defendants. \nDefendants move to dismiss all claims related to enforcement of the curfew orders on the \nground of qualified immunity.  \nThe doctrine of qualified immunity shields government employees from civil liability \nwhere performance of their discretionary functions “does not violate clearly established statutory \nor constitutional rights of which a reasonable person should have known.”  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, \n457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).  Because qualified immunity is an immunity from suit rather than a \nmere defense to liability, the issue should be decided at the earliest opportunity – preferably at the \noutset of the case – and may be resolved on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  Liberian Cmty. Ass’n of Conn. \nV. Lamont, 970 F.3d 174, 186 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThe best explanation I have ever read of the confounding doctrine of qualified immunity \nis found in the Second Circuit’s opinion in Stephenson v. Doe, 332 F.3d 68 (2d Cir. 2003).  There, \nthe Circuit explained that when determining a motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds \nin advance of full merits discovery, the plaintiff’s version of the facts is assumed to be true, \n“without regard to any objection defendants may have to the truth of plaintiff’s version of events.”  \nSee Harris v. City of New York, 222 F. Supp. 3d 341, 348 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (internal citations \nomitted).  The question to be answered is whether a reasonable government officer, confronted \nwith the facts as alleged by plaintiff, could reasonably have believed that his actions did not violate \nsome settled constitutional right. \nThere are two steps involved in determining qualified immunity.  The court must determine \nwhether, taking the facts in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, a constitutional \ninfraction was committed.  Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201.  If the answer is no, the case is over – not \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 36 of 45\nbecause the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity, but because the defendant did nothing \nwrong.  Harris, 222 F. Supp. 3d at 348 (citing Quezada v. Roy, No. 14-cv-4056, 2015 WL \n5970355, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 13, 2015)).  If, however, the answer is yes, the court must decide \nwhether a reasonable official in the defendant’s position (as that position is described by the \nplaintiff) ought to have known that he was violating the plaintiff’s constitutional rights by doing \nwhat the plaintiffs alleges he did.  At that point, the operative question becomes whether “the \nunlawfulness of [the official’s] conduct was clearly established at the time.”  Liberian Cmty., 970 \nF.3d at 186 (internal citations and quotations omitted) \nSubsequent to Stephenson, the Supreme Court has clarified that a district court confronted \nwith a qualified immunity motion may skip over the first question (was there or was there not a \nconstitutional violation) and answer the question about whether a reasonable official in defendant’s \nposition (as that position is described by plaintiff) would have known that his conduct violated the \nlaw.  Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223 (2009).  In most instances, that turns out to be the easiest \nway to dispose of a qualified immunity motion – especially when qualified immunity is asserted \nat the outset of a lawsuit, and “the answer to whether there was a violation may depend on a \nkaleidoscope of facts not yet fully developed.”  Id. \na.  First Amendment Challenge \nThe Sow plaintiffs first allege that the Mayor violated their First Amendment rights by \nordering a curfew. It is so patently obvious that it was not unconstitutional for the Mayor to issue \nthe curfew orders that it behooves the Court to dismiss this aspect of the Sow complaint because \nno violation of the plaintiffs’ rights has taken place. \nDisposal of a claim on these grounds is particularly appropriate where (as is so often the \ncase) the moving defendants conflate the two questions in their motion. That is precisely what has \nhappened here.  Defendants argue that Mayor de Blasio is shielded from liability with respect to \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 37 of 45\nthe curfew order by the doctrine of qualified immunity because (1) plaintiffs have not pleaded any \nviolation of a federal right, and (2) there was no clearly established law in June 2020 barring a \nmayor from imposing a curfew during a pandemic to protect the health and safety of residents. But \nif the answer to question (1) is that plaintiffs have not pleaded the violation of a federal right, then \nqualified immunity is irrelevant;  the Mayor (and his co-defendants) are entitled to dismissal, not \non qualified immunity grounds, but because they have done nothing wrong. That is the case here. \nPolitical demonstrations and protests lie at the heart of First Amendment concerns.  See \nBoos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 318 (1988).  But First Amendment protections, while broad, are not \nabsolute.  “Expression, whether oral or written or symbolized by conduct, is subject to reasonable \ntime, place, or manner restrictions.”  Clark v. Cmty. for Creative Nonviolence, 468 U.S. 288, 293 \n(1984).  The government may impose such restrictions in public forums so long as they “are \njustified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,” “are narrowly tailored to serve \na significant governmental interest, and “leave open ample alternative channels for communication \nof the information.”  Ibid. \n“The principal inquiry in determining content neutrality, in speech cases generally and in \ntime, place, or manner cases in particular, is whether the government has adopted a regulation of \nspeech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.”  Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 \nU.S. 781, 791 (1989) (citing Clark, 468 U.S. at 295).  Not a single fact is pleaded in the Sow \ncomplaint tending to suggest that the curfew ordinances, EO 117 and EO 119, were adopted in \norder to suppress speech with which the defendants disagreed. In fact, the orders were entirely \ncontent neutral. The curfew was applicable to all citizens except those whose services were \nurgently required during the night hours – firemen, health care workers, police officers, peace \nofficers, and “individuals travelling to and from essential work and performing essential work” – \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 38 of 45\nand the homeless.  (Goykadosh Decl. Ex. F at 2.) The orders barred all large gatherings during the \nnight hours, regardless of the reason for them or any message that participants planned to convey.  \nThey targeted no one and barred no message.   \nThe curfew was narrowly tailored to a significant governmental interest. It is beyond \ndispute  that  previous  demonstrations,  in  New  York  and  elsewhere  –  including  BLM \ndemonstrations – had escalated during the night hours from peaceful protest “to include actions of \nassault, vandalism, property damage, and/or looting.” Such conduct, much of it criminal in nature, \nposed a risk of “severe endangerment and harm to [residents’] health, safety, and property.” \nBecause it is more difficult for the City to preserve public safety after dark, the curfew was limited \nto the overnight hours.  (Goykadosh Decl. Ex. F.)11   \nThat tailoring left protesters’ First Amendment rights intact. Significantly, protesters were \nnot restricted from gathering to exercise their First Amendment rights during the day.  They were \nbarred from the streets only between the hours of 11:00 PM on June 1, 2020, until 5:00 AM on \nJune 2, 2020 (EO 117), and between the hours of 8:00 PM and 5:00 AM from June 2 until June 7. \n(EO 119).12  The BLM protesters had over twelve hours every day during which to make their \npoint – the daylight hours, during which government officials could well have had reason to believe \nfewer acts of vandalism and looting would take place, and during which period they could protect \n \n11 The orders also listed the pandemic as a reason for the curfew, but as it does not seem that the \nMayor or Police Commissioner were prepared to break up crowds of demonstrators during the \ndaylight hours, I set that to one side.  \n12 The extension occurred on the night of June 1, after looters began ransacking storefronts and \ncommitting acts of violence before the 11:00 PM curfew had even started, and continued their \nspree throughout the night.  After Peaceful Protests, Looters Strike at Macy’s and Across \nMidtown, New York Times (June 2, 2020), https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/nyregion/nyc-\nlooting-protests.html. \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 39 of 45\nmore easily protect residents and business owners of the City from anything untoward that might \nhappen.  No one was denied the right to protest by virtue of the Executive Orders.  \nAccordingly, this Court agrees with Defendants that the executive orders did nothing more \nthan impose reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on Plaintiffs’ right to protest, without \ncurtailing  those  rights.  The  curfew  was  not  inconsistent  with  the  protections  of  the  First \nAmendment, and the Mayor (and his co-defendants, assuming they participated in the decision to \nimpose a curfew) did nothing unconstitutional in issuing the executive orders. Therefore, the Sow \nplaintiffs’ facial challenge to the curfew order is dismissed. \nBut should there be any doubt on that score, the individual defendants are clearly entitled \nto qualified immunity for issuing the curfew orders, for the simple reason that, in June 2020, there \nwas no clearly established law prohibiting a mayor from imposing a content-neutral curfew, during \na pandemic, to protect citizens from widespread looting, vandalism, and violence that were \noccurring in connection with similar protests elsewhere in the country.  To the extent that the Sow \nplaintiffs rely on recent Supreme Court jurisprudence in cases involving alleged incursions on the \nfree exercise of religion during the pandemic, see Roman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo, 141 S.Ct. \n63 (2020),  that decision was not issued until after the BLM protests and the issuance of the early \nJune 2020 curfew orders (it was handed down on November 25, 2020). So even assuming that the \nreasoning of that case could be extended to the situation facing the Mayor in early June of 2020 – \na difficult and complicated issue that, as it has not been adequately briefed, need not be explored \nhere13 – the Supreme Court had not yet spoken in the arguably analogous context of free exercise \n \n13 That issue is whether Diocese is limited to free exercise rights or whether its reasoning extends \nto all First Amendment protected conduct (as the Sow plaintiffs argue). The parties have not \nbegun to give this serious and complicated issue the briefing it deserves. Fortunately, the Court \nneed not reach it because the fact that the Supreme Court did not settle the issue in the free \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 40 of 45\nat the time the curfew orders were handed down. So no reasonable official in the Mayor’s position \nin early June 2020 would have had any reason to think that  he could not order an emergency \novernight curfew that contained carve outs for police, health care and other essential workers, \nbecause doing so would impermissibly impinge on the right of other individuals to engage in First \nAmendment protected activity. That being so, issuance of the order is a quintessential example of \nactivity for which the issuing officials have qualified immunity.  \nb.  Fourteenth Amendment Challenge: Vagueness \nNext, the Sow plaintiffs allege that “Defendants enforced . . . the Curfew Orders . . . in a \nmanner that rendered them constitutionally void for vagueness and/or overbroad, such that their \nenforcement against Plaintiffs violated their Due Process rights.”  (Sow A.C. ¶ 556.)   \nAs an initial matter, there is no such thing as an as-applied challenge for overbreadth under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment.  Overbreadth challenges are a form of First Amendment challenge \nand an exception to the general rule against third-party standing.  See Broadrick v. Okla., 413 U.S. \n601 (1973).  A party alleging overbreadth contends that, although a statute did not violate his or \nher First Amendment rights, it would violate the First Amendment rights of a hypothetical third \nparty if applied to that third party.  Farrell v. Burke, 449 F.3d 470, 498 (2d Cir. 2006) (citing \nBroadrick, 413 U.S. at 612).  “All overbreadth challenges are facial challenges, because an \noverbreadth challenge by its nature assumes that the measure is constitutional as applied to the \nparty before the court.”  Id.  For that reason, the Court dismisses the “as applied/overbreadth” \naspect of the Sow plaintiffs’ challenge to the curfew orders.   \nTurning to the as-applied/vagueness challenge to the curfew orders, dismissal is warranted \nbecause the orders are not at all vague, so no constitutional violation has occurred. \n \nexercise context means that qualified immunity shields the Mayor and his co-defendants from \nliability on this novel and untested ground.  \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 41 of 45\n“It is established that a law fails to meet the requirements of the Due Process Clause if it is \nso vague and standardless that it leaves the public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibits.”  City of \nChicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 56 (quoting Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U.S. 399, 402-03 \n(1966)).  There is a two-part test for as-applied vagueness challenges: a court must first determine \nwhether the statute “gives the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know \nwhat is prohibited and then consider whether the law provides explicit standards for those who \napply it.”  U.S. v. Nadi, 996 F.2d 548, 550 (2d Cir. 1993) (cleaned up). \nIt hardly seems possible for a law to be more clear about what conduct it prohibits.  The \ncurfew orders provide that, during specified times, “no persons or vehicles may be in public” aside \nfrom “police officers, peace officers, firefighters, first responders and emergency technicians, [the \nhomeless], individuals travelling to and from essential work and performing essential work . . . \nand individuals seeking medical treatment or supplies.”  The orders provide that any person who \n“knowingly violates the provisions in this Order shall be guilty of a Class B misdemeanor.”  Surely \na person of ordinary intelligence (1) knows what it means to be in public; (2) understands the \nmeaning of the words 8:00 (or 11:00) PM to 5:00 AM; and (3) knows whether that individual is a \npolice officer, peace officer, firefighter, first responder, emergency technician, homeless, or is \ntravelling to/from essential work or seeking medical treatment or supplies.  If you are out after \n8:00  (or  11:00)  PM,  and  you  are  not  peace  officer,  firefighter,  first  responder,  emergency \ntechnician, homeless, travelling to/from essential work, or seeking medical treatment, you are in \nviolation of the curfew order and guilty of a misdemeanor.   \nNeither is the term “essential worker” as used in the Executive Order vague or undefined. \n“Essential worker” was and is a term of art during the pandemic state of emergency. Essential \nwork was identified in a series of Executive Orders issued by the Governor beginning in late March \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 42 of 45\nof 2020.14 So persons could readily identify whether they were or were not engaged in “essential \nwork” at all times during the BLM protests.  \nFinally, nothing in the text of the curfew orders “encourages arbitrary and discriminatory \nenforcement.”  See Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972).  \nAs I read their complaint, the Sow plaintiffs do not appear to contest that there is anything \nunclear about the prohibition in EO 117 or EO 119; that is, they do not mount a facial challenge \nto the orders on vagueness grounds.  Instead, they appear to allege that the law is vague as applied \nbecause there were instances in which officers failed to give mandatory dispersal orders before \ncharging protesters with curfew violations.   \nThe dispersal order issue is another red herring. \nThe aspect of the Executive Orders that required officers to give dispersal orders if they \nwitnessed what appeared to be curfew violations governed the conduct of police officers, not the \nconduct of members of the public. If any officers who saw people out after curfew failed to give \ndispersal orders, they (the officers) failed to do their duty in the prescribed manner. That failure \ncould impact the officers’ ability to prove that certain plaintiffs who were arrested violated the \ncurfew “knowingly,” which in turn could affect the analysis of probable cause to arrest. See Dinler, \n2012 WL 4513352, at *11.15 \nBut the fact that a police officer may have failed to comply with the officer’s obligations \ndoes not make it difficult for citizens to understand what conduct of theirs is prohibited by the \n \n14 See Executive Order 202.6; “Guidance for Determining Whether a Business Enterprise Is \nSubject To a Workforce Reduction Under Recent Executive Orders” (first issued Mar. 29, 2020; \nlast updated Oct. 23, 2020), https://esd.ny.gov/guidance-executive-order-2026. \n15 This court does not here hold that an officer would have to issue a dispersal order before s/he \nwould have at least “arguable probable cause” to arrest someone who is out after curfew without \nfirst giving a dispersal order.  See Zalaski v. City of Hartford, 723 F.3d 382, 390 (2d Cir. 2013). \nThat is an issue that will undoubtedly be litigated during this case.  \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 43 of 45\ncurfew orders.  The conduct prohibited by the orders here challenged was being out in public \nbetween certain hours – not failing to obey a dispersal order.  See Morales, 527 U.S. at 49.  And \nunlike Morales – a case in which a Chicago ordinance used the paradigmatically vague term \n“loitering” to identify the forbidden conduct, and then defined loitering in a manner that had “no \ncommon and accepted meaning”16 – the conduct that violates EO 117 and EO 119 is defined with \nsufficient precision to avoid any suggestion that it cannot be understood by a person of average \nintelligence.   \nc.  Enforcement of the Curfew Orders \nFinally, the Sow plaintiffs allege that the curfew orders were issued and/or enforced in a \nselective  and/or  retaliatory  manner,  thus  rendering  the  individual  defendants  liable.    This \ncontention, too, can be readily dismissed, except as to Chief Monahan.  \nThe orders on their face do not apply “selectively.”  They apply to anyone who is not \nhomeless and who is not engaged in a line of work that can reasonably be deemed essential during \nthe overnight hours (law enforcement, healthcare workers traveling to and from work, etc.).  \nThe orders are not facially unreasonable.  The “carve out” for “essential workers” who \nneeded to travel to and from work during the pandemic emergency was limited to workers whose \nservices were required to provide basic and crucial services to New Yorkers, as clearly set forth in \nexecutive orders and guidance issued by the Governor’s office (see supra, n.14). \nThe only allegation of fact made specifically against the Mayor is that he issued the curfew \norders.  But I have already held that it was not unconstitutional for him to do so.  No facts are \n \n16 The ordinance defined “loitering” as “to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose.”  \nId. at 56-57.  The curfew orders here under attack, by contrast, carve out exceptions for persons \nwho were trying to keep the peace, treat the sick, obtain medical treatment, or engage in work \nthat had been deemed “essential” under orders previously issued by the Governor of the State of \nNew York. See supra, p. 41.  \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 44 of 45\nalleged  tending  to  show  that  he  decided  to  impose  a  curfew  in  order  to  retaliate  against \ndemonstrators; indeed, the order did not apply only to demonstrators, but to everyone who was not \nan essential worker. The Sow plaintiffs are simply throwing around loaded words, which are not \nback with allegations of specific fact.  \nThere is no factual allegation in the Sow complaint that the Mayor, the Commissioner, or \nthe Chief directed any member of the NYPD to enforce the curfew order selectively against some \npersons but not others, or in retaliation for protesters’ anti-police views.  In fact, the Sow plaintiffs \naffirmatively allege that a message was sent to NYPD officers authorizing the issuance of a C \nsummons for anyone – anyone – who violated the order.  That is the antithesis of selective or \nretaliatory enforcement. \nIf one of the plaintiffs in Sow can allege that the officer who issued him or her a summons \nfor a curfew violations did so selectively, or in retaliation for protesting, then that plaintiff will \nhave stated a claim against that particular officer. The individual officers have not moved to \ndismiss any of the claims asserted by the Sow plaintiffs, on qualified immunity grounds or \notherwise (though they may later assert such a defense, as the facts are gathered).  But no such \nclaim has been stated against any of the supervisory defendants. \nAs their last effort to challenge the enforcement of the curfew orders, the Sow plaintiffs \nclaim that Defendants violated the Fourth Amendment by failing to issue dispersal orders before \narresting protesters for curfew violations.  \nNot a single fact is alleged tending to show that the Mayor or the Commissioner personally \nfailed to issue a dispersal order, or directed any police officer to ignore the plain text of the curfew \norders by failing to issue a dispersal order. Nor is any fact alleged tending to show that the Mayor \nor the Commissioner was in any position to intervene when officers failed to issue dispersal orders.  \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 116   Filed 07/09/21   Page 45 of 45\nThere is, however, one aspect of the Sow plaintiffs’ curfew order enforcement claim that \ncan proceed. Chief Monahan is alleged to have been present at the Mott Haven protest that is the \nsubject of the Sow complaint.  The plaintiffs allege that he directed the NYPD’s planning and \nresponse to the Mott Haven protest. Specifically, the Sow plaintiffs allege that, at Chief Monahan’s \ndirection, NYPD officers surrounded and kettled the protesters shortly before 8:00 PM, which \nmade it impossible for them to comply with the curfew order and resulted in their being falsely \narrested. That claim cannot be dismissed at this juncture, either on the merits or on the ground of \nqualified immunity.  \nCONCLUSION \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaints is granted in part and denied in \npart, as follows: \n1.  All claims against Defendants de Blasio, Shea and Monahan in their official capacities \nare dismissed.   \n2.  All claims against Defendant Shea in his individual capacity are dismissed.   \n3.  The Sow plaintiffs’ claims relating to the issuance and enforcement of the curfew orders \nagainst Defendant de Blasio in his individual capacity are dismissed.  \nThe Clerk of Court is directed to close the motion at docket numbers 105. \nDated: July 9, 2021 \n \n                 \n                  United States District Judge \n \n \nBY ECF TO ALL COUNSEL \n \n45 \n ",

The Settlement Agreement reached by the parties (“Agr.”) is attached as \nExhibit 1 to the Declaration of Jonathan C. Moore (“Moore Decl.”). \nSpecifically, Defendants will pay each eligible class member $9,950.00 (Nine Thousand \nNine Hundred and Fifty Dollars) with a maximum distribution to class members from a class fund \nof $13,731,000.00 (Thirteen Million Seven Hundred and Thirty-One Thousand Dollars).  An \nadditional service award will be paid to the Named Plaintiffs in this action who were arrested \nand/or force was used against at several “George Floyd protests” in 2020, and a settlement will be \npaid to those Named Plaintiffs arrested at Mott Haven on June 4, 2020.  These amounts are \nexclusive of attorney’s fees and costs which the parties have agreed to negotiate and, hopefully \nresolve, separately without the need for court intervention. \nBecause this proposed settlement satisfies all of the criteria for preliminary approval, \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: (1) preliminarily approve the proposed settlement \nterms as reflected in the parties’ Stipulation of Settlement and Order (referred to herein as \n“Settlement  Agreement\"  or  “Agreement”);  (2) conditionally  certify  the  proposed  class  for \nsettlement purposes pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c) and 23(e); (3) appoint Beldock Levine & \n \n1 The Named Plaintiffs are Adama Sow, David Jaklevic, Alexandra De Mucha Pino, Oscar \nRios, Barbara Ross, Matthew Bredder, Sabrina Zurkuhlen, Maria Salazar, Dara Pluchino, and Savitri \nDurkee. \n  1 \n\n \nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 166   Filed 07/19/23   Page 6 of 28\nHoffman, LLP, Cohen & Green, PLLC, Wylie Stecklow, PLLC, Masai Lord, and Gideon Orion \nOliver, Esq. (collectively, “Plaintiffs’ Counsel”) as Class Counsel; (4) approve the proposed class \nsettlement notice procedure as reflected in the Agreement; and (5) appoint Rust Consulting, Inc. \nas Class Administrator.  \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nI.  THE SOW ACTION \nIn the Sow action, Plaintiffs allege that the City of New York systematically attacked, \ntrapped, and arrested  people who were joining in  protests condemning police violence  in \nresponse to the gruesome murder of George Floyd. Plaintiffs allege that starting on May 28, \n2020,  and  continuing  through  at  least  November  2020,  Defendants  assaulted  protesters, \nbystanders, and observers with fist strikes, baton strikes to the head and body, tackles to the \nground, and subjected them to excessively tight handcuffs (both metal and plastic flex-cuffs) and \npepper spray. \nPlaintiffs also allege that as a frequent prelude to these assaults, NYPD officers corralled \nBlack Lives Matter (“BLM”) protesters into spaces from which they could not escape—a practice \nknown as “kettling”—engaging in making mass arrests, all without lawful justification or fair \nwarning and subjected arrestees to lengthy and unnecessary arrest processing, and detained them \nin cruel and inhumane conditions.  Videos produced during discovery show these practices as \nwidespread and pervasive. \nII.  INVESTIGATION, DISCOVERY, AND SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS \nThe Sow Complaint was filed on January 21, 2021.  For purposes of discovery, the Court \neventually consolidated Sow with nine other related cases (the “Consolidated Cases”).  Consistent \nwith the Court’s consolidation order, the plaintiffs in the Consolidated Cases coordinated and \ncollaborated in taking discovery.  Moore Decl. ¶¶ 3–6, 8, 10. \n  2 \n\n \nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 166   Filed 07/19/23   Page 7 of 28\nGiven the breadth of the consolidated actions and the number of parties, discovery in the \nConsolidated Cases has been complex, lengthy, and hard-fought.  To date, Defendants have \nproduced hundreds of thousands of documents, and thousands of hours of videos and audio \nrecordings which plaintiffs have categorized and logged.  Id. ¶ 4.  On March 6, 2021, the Sow \nPlaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint.  ECF Dkt. No. 49.  The Sow Plaintiffs were partially \nsuccessful in defending  a motion to dismiss that pleading.  ECF Dkt. No. 116. \nThe Sow Named Plaintiffs responded to Defendants’ discovery requests and were all \ndeposed in 2021, and Sow Plaintiffs’ Counsel participated in numerous depositions of NYPD \nofficers and defendants.  Moore Decl. ¶ 5.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel participated in discovery motion \npractice including filing numerous motions to compel discovery that were granted, and also \nresponded to motions from Defendants and counsel for Intervenor Unions the PBA, DEA and \nSBA.  The Sow counsel were actively preparing for depositions of high-level NYPD officials \nuntil the parties reached an agreement.  Id. ¶ 8.  The Court also scheduled motion practice on \nclass certification which was being prepared by Sow Counsel until the parties reached a settlement \nagreement.  Id. ¶ 9.  The Sow counsel had digested hundreds of hours of video and many \nthousands of pages of documents produced by the City of New York during discovery.  Id. ¶ 10. \nThe Sow Plaintiffs engaged in numerous settlement discussions over a number of months.  \nThese negotiations were hard fought and the proposed settlement amount for each class member \nreflects significant compromise on the part of both Plaintiffs and Defendants. \nSUMMARY OF PRINCIPLE SETTLEMENT TERMS \nThe  Agreement  provides  significant  compensation  to  approximately  1,380  protestors \nsubjected to arrest and/or police force. \nI.  PROPOSED SETTLEMENT CLASS DEFINITION \nThe proposed Settlement Class is defined as all persons who were arrested, and/or \n  3 \n\n \nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 166   Filed 07/19/23   Page 8 of 28\nsubjected to force by NYPD officers during the “George Floyd protest” on the following 18 dates \nand locations: \nProtest Date  Protest Location  Location Boundaries \nMay 28, 2020  Lafayette to City Hall  Arrests made at the protest within the area of Manhattan \nin the surrounding vicinity bordered by Spring Street, \nCentre Street, Park Row, Nassau Street, Broad Street, \nBeaver  Street,  Broadway,  Battery  Place,  and  West \nStreet. \nMay 28, 2020  Union Square  Arrests made at the protest within the area of Manhattan \nin the surrounding vicinity bordered by West and East \n20th Street, Second Avenue, East and West 11th Street, \nand Seventh Avenue. \nMay 29, 2020  Barclays Center area  Arrests made at the protest within the area of Brooklyn \nin the surrounding vicinity bordered by Myrtle Avenue, \nClasson Avenue, Fulton Street, Washington Avenue, \nProspect  Place,  Vanderbilt  Avenue,  Sterling  Place, \nSeventh Avenue, Union Street, Nevins Street, Atlantic \nAvenue, Bond Street and Butler Street and within the \narea of Manhattan in the surrounding vicinity bordered \nby  Canal  Street,  Mulberry  Street,  Park  Row,  and \nBroadway. \nMay 30, 2020  East Flatbush/  Arrests made at the protest within the area of \nBarclays Center area  Brooklyn in the surrounding vicinity bordered by \nMyrtle Avenue, Washington Avenue, Prospect Place, \nVanderbilt Avenue, Sterling Place, Seventh Avenue, \nUnion Street, Nevins Street, Atlantic Avenue, Baltic \nStreet  and Bond Street and Third Avenue;

Agr. ¶ 33. \nII.  PROPOSED PAYMENTS TO CLASS MEMBERS \nUnder the Agreement, all eligible class members who submit timely Claim Forms will each \nreceive $9,950.00.  Agr. ¶ 40.  For their efforts in bringing and maintaining this action, including \nengaging in discovery and being deposed, and subject to Court approval, the City agrees to pay \nawards for the services provided to the class by Class Representatives David Jaklevic, Alexandra \nde Mucha Pino, Oscar Rios, Sabrina Zurkuhlen, Maria Salazar, and Matthew Bredder, in the \namount of nine thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars ($9.950.00).  In light of the unique facts \nand circumstances of her claims, the City agrees to pay to Barbara Ross a service award in the sum \nof twenty thousand and fifty dollars ($20,050.00).  These service payment awards shall be in \naddition to any amounts otherwise due to them with respect to their individual claim as Class \nMembers. \nSubject to the Court’s approval, the City agrees to pay Plaintiffs Adama Sow, Dara \n  7 \n\n \nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 166   Filed 07/19/23   Page 12 of 28\nPluchino,  and  Savitri  Durkee  the  sum  of  twenty-one  thousand  and  five  hundred  dollars \n($21,500.00), in full satisfaction and settlement of all claims in this Civil Action.  In consideration \nfor the settlement herein, Plaintiffs will not submit a claim form or in any way participate in the \nclass action settlement under Samira Sierra, et al. v. City of New York, et al., Nos. 20-CV-10291, \n20-CV-10541 (CM) (GWG). \nIII.  PROPOSED PROCESS FOR PROVIDING NOTICE TO CLASS MEMBERS \nThe parties have agreed to provide notice to the Class in three forms. First, a “Claims \nPackage” will be mailed to every known Class Member.  Agr. ¶ 36.  The Claims Package consists \nof a long form Class Notice and a Claim Form.  Id. ¶¶ 7, 9.  As noted below, the Claims \nAdministrator will translate the Claims Package into Spanish (which the parties will review for \naccuracy), and both the English and Spanish versions of the Claims Package will be transmitted \ntogether to each class member.  Id. ¶ 50.  Second, a Class Notice Summary will be published in \nthe Daily News, the Amsterdam News, and El Diario.  Id. ¶ 37.  Third, a website will be established \nwhere Class Members can review the terms of the proposed Settlement, and submit a Claim Form.  \nId. ¶ 38. \nIV.  ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS \nThe City will pay Plaintiffs’ reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.  Agr. ¶ 83.  The parties \nagree that they will attempt to settle the amount of fees and costs incurred up to and including the \ndate of the Agreement and for those fees and costs that are reasonably likely to be incurred through \nthe date of the Final Approval hearing; Plaintiffs will move this Court for approval of their \nattorneys’ fees and costs, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(h) and 54(d)(1) and (2), \nsimultaneously with their Motion for Final Approval of the Settlement.  Plaintiffs intend to seek \napproximately $8,284,543.17 for reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred through June 15, \n2023, plus all additional reasonable fees and costs incurred from that date through the completion \n  8 \n\n \nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 166   Filed 07/19/23   Page 13 of 28\nof this settlement. \nTHE COURT SHOULD PRELIMARILY APPROVE THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT \nPreliminary approval of this settlement is appropriate, especially given the “strong judicial \npolicy in favor of settlements, particularly in the class action context.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. \nVisa U.S.A. Inc., 396 F.3d 96, 116 (2d Cir. 2005).  Approval of a class action settlement is a matter \nof discretion, see Maywalt v. Parker & Parsley Petroleum Co., 67 F.3d 1072, 1078 (2d Cir. 1995), \nwith “proper deference” given “to the private consensual decision of the parties,” Clark v. Ecolab \nInc., Nos. 07-CV-8623, 04-CV-4488, 06-CV-5672, 2009 WL 6615729, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 27, \n2009) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Courts considering a proposed class action \nsettlement “should keep in mind the unique ability of class and defense counsel to assess the \npotential risks and rewards of litigation.”  Id. \nPreliminary approval of a proposed class settlement “requires only an initial evaluation of \nthe fairness of the proposed settlement on the basis of written submissions and an informal \npresentation by the settling parties.”  Lizondro-Garcia v. Kefi LLC, 300 F.R.D. 169, 179 (S.D.N.Y. \n2014).  Granting preliminary approval is “at most a determination that there is what might be \ntermed ‘probable cause’ to submit the proposal to class members and hold a full-scale hearing as \nto its fairness.”  In re Traffic Exec. Ass’n-E. R.Rs., 627 F.2d 631, 634 (2d Cir. 1980).  “A proposed \nsettlement of a class action should therefore be preliminarily approved where it appears to be the \nproduct of serious, informed, non-collusive negotiations, has no obvious deficiencies, does not \nimproperly grant preferential treatment to class representatives or segments of the class and falls \nwithin the range of possible approval.”  Felix v. Northstar Location Servs., LLC, 290 F.R.D. 397, \n407 (W.D.N.Y. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nThe proposed settlement here is fair, reasonable, and adequate and should be preliminarily \n  9 \n\n \nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 166   Filed 07/19/23   Page 14 of 28\napproved. In evaluating the fairness of a proposed class action settlement, courts in the Second \nCircuit generally consider the nine factors set forth in City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., 495 F.2d \n448, 463 (2d Cir. 1974), abrogated on other grounds by Goldberger v. Integrated Res., Inc., 209 \nF.3d 43 (2d Cir. 2000).  The Grinnell factors are: \n(1)  the complexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation; \n(2)  the reaction of the class to the settlement; \n(3)  the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed; \n(4)  the risks of establishing liability; \n(5)  the risks of establishing damages; \n(6)  the risks of maintaining the class action through the trial; \n(7)  the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment; \n(8)  the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the best possible \nrecovery; and \n(9)  the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund to a possible recovery in light of \nall the attendant risks of litigation. \nGrinnell, 495 F.2d at 463.  These factors all weigh in favor of the granting preliminary approval \nto the Agreement. \nI.  CONTINUED  LITIGATION  WOULD  BE  COMPLEX,  EXPENSIVE,  AND \nLENGTHY (FACTOR 1) \nBy reaching a favorable settlement prior to  the completion of discovery, dispositive \nmotions and/or trial, Plaintiffs seek to avoid additional significant expense and delay and ensure \nrecovery for the class.  “Most class actions are inherently complex and settlement avoids the costs, \ndelays and multitude of other problems associated with them.”  In re Austrian & German Bank \nHolocaust Litig., 80 F. Supp. 2d 164, 174 (S.D.N.Y. 2000), aff’d sub nom. D’Amato v. Deutsche \nBank, 236 F.3d 78 (2d Cir. 2001). \nThere is no question that litigating this case through trial would be complicated and time-\n  10 \n\n \nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 166   Filed 07/19/23   Page 15 of 28\nconsuming. Completing discovery for this case would require the Sow Plaintiffs to take additional \ndepositions of high-level NYPD officials, and engage in expert discovery.  Preparing for and \ntaking those depositions would require hundreds of hours of attorney time.  There is also additional \npaper discovery that would need to be completed if this case is not resolved by settlement. \nAbsent settlement, Plaintiffs would also need to litigate the issue of class certification and, \nmost likely, prepare for and defend against summary judgment motions on a significant number \nof claims or elements of claims.  Thus, by settling now, the Parties avoid protracted motion practice \nand save the Court the task of reviewing and deciding these sequential motions.  Moreover, given \nthat it is highly unlikely that this case could be fully resolved through summary judgment, a full \njury trial would be necessary—which would be another burden on the Court and the Parties that \nsettlement avoids. \nSettlement avoids the time and costs of numerous additional depositions, further paper \ndiscovery, disputed motions for class certification and summary judgment, and trial.  Significantly, \nit also avoids years of delay in obtaining compensation for class members.  Thus, the first Grinnell \nfactor weighs strongly in favor of approval. \nII.  THE REACTION OF THE CLASS TO THE SETTLEMENT (FACTOR 2) \nBecause notice of the settlement has not yet been issued to the class, the Court can and \nshould more fully consider this factor after notice is sent and class members are given the \nopportunity to respond to it.  Still, at this stage, the ten Named Plaintiffs have all expressed their \napproval of the settlement and, given the size of the awards, there is likely to be a positive reaction \nfrom the class.  This factor, too, weighs in favor of approval. \nIII.  DISCOVERY HAS ADVANCED FAR ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE PARTIES TO \nRESOLVE THE CASE RESPONSIBLY (FACTOR 3) \nThe parties have completed enough discovery to recommend settlement.  “Because much \n  11 \n\n \nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 166   Filed 07/19/23   Page 16 of 28\nof the point of settling is to avoid litigation expenses such as full discovery, it would be inconsistent \nwith the salutary purposes of settlement to find that extensive pre-trial discovery is a prerequisite \nto approval of a settlement.”  Martens v. Smith Barney, Inc., 181 F.R.D. 243, 263 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  The proper question is “whether counsel had an \nadequate appreciation of the merits of the case before negotiating.”  In re Warfarin Sodium \nAntitrust Litig., 391 F.3d 516, 537 (3d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).  “[T]he \npretrial negotiations and discovery must be sufficiently adversarial that they are not designed to \njustify a settlement . . . [, but] an aggressive effort to ferret out facts helpful to the prosecution of \nthe suit.”  In re Austrian, 80 F. Supp. 2d at 176 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nDiscovery to date easily meets this standard.  This Court is fully aware of how hard-fought \ndiscovery has been to date, with dozens of discovery disputes coming before the Court for \nresolution.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel have reviewed and analyzed many thousands of documents, \nreviewed hundreds of hours of video and audio recordings (including CCRB and NYC Department \nof Investigation interviews of many officers), defended the Named Plaintiffs’ depositions, and \ntaken or sat in on numerous depositions of NYPD personnel. Plaintiffs also obtained subpoenaed \nrecords from the Bronx District Attorney’s Office. \nAfter reviewing some of this discovery, Plaintiffs’ counsel in Sow prepared an amended \ncomplaint that identified additional appropriate defendants and modified claims against defendants \ninitially named. \nThis case has been litigated at an expedited pace for more than two years—more than \nenough time for the parties to responsibly resolve the case.  This factor weighs in favor of approval. \nIV.  PLAINTIFFS  WOULD  FACE  REAL  RISKS  IF  THE  CASE  PROCEEDED \n(FACTORS 4 AND 5) \nPlaintiffs believe their case is strong. But considerable risks remain if the case does not \n  12 \n\n \nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 166   Filed 07/19/23   Page 17 of 28\nsettle.  “Litigation inherently involves risks.”  In re PaineWebber Ltd. P’ships Litig., 171 F.R.D. \n104, 126 (S.D.N.Y. 1997).  “The proposed settlement benefits each plaintiff in that he or she will \nrecover a monetary award immediately, without having to risk that an outcome unfavorable to the \nplaintiffs will emerge from a trial.”  Velez v. Majik Cleaning Serv., Inc., No. 03-CV-8698, 2007 \nWL 7232783, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. June 25, 2007). \nA trial on the merits would involve significant risks for Plaintiffs as to both liability and \ndamages.  To prevail on some of their constitutional claims, Plaintiffs would need to prove that \nthey were singled out for police mistreatment on the basis of their message (against police \nbrutality).  They would also need to overcome Defendants’ insistence that probable cause—and, \nwith respect to the individual Defendants’ qualified immunity defense, arguable probable cause—\nexisted to arrest the protestors. Plaintiffs would also have to prove that the use of force against the \nprotestors was objectively unreasonable, not to mention the other Class Claims—like the violation \nof protestors’ First Amendment Rights. Plaintiffs also would need to show that each of the named \nDefendants was personally involved in the alleged constitutional deprivations and that the City \nwas liable as a municipality. \nEven if Plaintiffs succeeded at trial (and on appeal) in proving Defendants’ liability, they \nwould face additional difficulty in proving the full extent of damages.  Given the generally \nrelatively modest times in detention, Plaintiffs would face a substantial risk a jury would award \nless. These factors also weigh in favor of approval. \nV.  MAINTAINING  THE  CLASS  THROUGH  TRIAL  WOULD  NOT  BE  SIMPLE \n(FACTOR 6) \nWhile Plaintiffs are confident that they would obtain certification of the class under Rule \n23, the many other litigations surrounding the Summer 2020 protests mean that maintaining the \nclass through trial would be complicated, given other cases that could impinge upon the class. \n  13 \n\n \nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 166   Filed 07/19/23   Page 18 of 28\nFurther, any trial would not occur for another year or more, further complicating efforts to maintain \nthe class (as members may move away or become harder to find).  Risk, expense, and delay \npermeate the class certification process. Settlement eliminates these risks, expenses, and delay. \nThis factor favors preliminary approval. \nVI.  DEFENDANTS  COULD  CONCEIVABLY  WITHSTAND  A  GREATER \nJUDGMENT,  BUT  THIS  FACT  ALONE  DOES  NOT  WEIGH  AGAINST \nAPPROVAL (FACTOR 7) \nWhile the City of New York could presumably withstand a judgment greater than the total \nclass settlement awards, that fact “does not render the settlement unfair, especially where the other \nGrinnell factors favor approval.”  McBean v. City of New York, 233 F.R.D. 377, 388 (S.D.N.Y. \n2006).  Indeed, “fairness does not require that the City of New York empty its coffers before this \nCourt will approve a settlement.” Id. \nVII.  THE  SETTLEMENT  IS  SUBSTANTIAL,  EVEN  IN  LIGHT  OF  THE  BEST \nPOSSIBLE  RECOVERY  AND  THE  ATTENDANT  RISKS  OF  LITIGATION \n(FACTORS 8 AND 9) \nThe City has agreed to pay a significant sum to each eligible class member: $9,950.00.  This \nrepresents a substantial per-plaintiff settlement amount for a case like this, involving mass arrests \nand excessive force, among other things. \nThe determination of whether a settlement amount is reasonable “does not involve the use \nof a ‘mathematical equation yielding a particularized sum.’”  Frank v. Eastman Kodak Co., 228 \nF.R.D. 184, 186 (W.D.N.Y. 2005) (quoting In re Austrian, 80 F. Supp. 2d at 178).  “Instead, ‘there \nis  a  range  of  reasonableness  with  respect  to  a  settlement—a  range  which  recognizes  the \nuncertainties of law and fact in any particular case and the concomitant risks and costs necessarily \ninherent in taking any litigation to completion.’”  Id. (quoting Newman v. Stein, 464 F.2d 689, 693 \n(2d Cir. 1972)).  Because the settlement agreement is, on its face, “‘fair, adequate, and reasonable, \nand not a product of collusion,’” Frank, 228 F.R.D. at 184 (quoting Joel A. v. Giuliani, 218 F.3d \n  14 \n\n \nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 166   Filed 07/19/23   Page 19 of 28\n132, 138–39 (2d Cir. 2000)), the Court should grant preliminary approval. \nTHE COURT SHOULD CONDITIONALLY CERTIFY THE PROPOSED CLASS \nPURSUANT TO RULE 23(E) \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that the Court certify the Proposed Class under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 23(e) for purposes of effectuating the settlement. As discussed below, the Class \nmeets all of the requirements for class certification, and Defendants do not oppose certification \nunder Rule 23(e).  See Herbert B. Newberg & Alba Conte, Newberg on Class Actions, § 13:3 (“If \na class has not yet been certified, the parties stipulate to the conditional or temporary establishment \nof settlement classes for the purposes of the agreement.”); County of Suffolk v. Long Island \nLighting Co., 710 F. Supp. 1422, 1424 (E.D.N.Y. 1989) (“negotiat[ing] a proposed settlement . . . \nprior to certification of the class” is appropriate), aff’d in part, rev’d in part on other grounds, 907 \nF.2d 1295 (2d Cir. 1990). \nUnder Rule 23(a), a class action may be maintained if all the prongs of Rule 23(a) are met, \nas well as one of the prongs of Rule 23(b).  In the Second Circuit, “Rule 23 is given liberal rather \nthan restrictive construction, and courts are to adopt a standard of flexibility” in evaluating class \ncertification.  Reade-Alvarez v. Eltman, Eltman & Cooper, P.C., 237 F.R.D. 26, 31 (E.D.N.Y. \n2006) (quoting Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 377 (2d Cir. 1997)). \nI.  THE PROPOSED CLASS SATISFIES THE RULE 23(A) FACTORS \nThe Proposed Class is, subject to the exclusion listed above,  all persons who were arrested, \nand/or subjected to force by NYPD officers during the “George Floyd protest” at the 18 dates and \nlocations listed in the Chart at pages 4–6 above. \n This motion satisfies the Rule 23(a) requirements.  The class is sufficiently numerous; \nquestions of law and fact are common to the class; the class representatives’ claims are typical of \nthose of the class; and there is adequacy of representation.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n  15 \n\n \nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 166   Filed 07/19/23   Page 20 of 28\nPursuant to the Agreement Plaintiffs will dismiss the remaining claims with prejudice, \nincluding any claims for injunctive relief sought through Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  Agr. ¶ 85–86.  \nHowever, Plaintiffs’ Counsel was substantively involved in the framework being used in further \nsettlement discussions that, if successful, will greatly benefit this class as well. \nA.  Numerosity \nThe Proposed Class is “so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.”  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(a).  “[T]he numerosity analysis begins with the presumption that a class comprising \n40 or more members is generally sufficient.”  MacNamara v. City of New York, 275 F.R.D. 125, \n141 (S.D.N.Y. 2011).  Here, there are  approximately 1,380 class members.  Agr. ¶ 40.  And while \nsome class members may have a separate lawsuit pending, “the presence of those actions does not \nmilitate against class certification,” In re WorldCom, Inc. Sec. Litig., 219 F.R.D. 267,  305 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2003), because, for purposes of the Rule 23 analysis, “individuals are considered class \nmembers until they opt out of the suit,” MacNamara, 275 F.R.D. at 141.  Accordingly, the \nProposed Class is sufficiently numerous to satisfy Rule 23(a). \nB.  Commonality \nFed. R. Civ. P.  23(a)(2) requires “questions of law and fact common to the class.”  Even a \n“single common question” will suffice.  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 359 (cleaned up).  The rule “does \nnot require all questions of law or fact be common to the class,” and, indeed, such a requirement \n“would be the death knell for class actions challenging the systemic enforcement of an [unlawful] \nstatute,” an “unacceptable result.”  Brown v. Kelly, 244 F.R.D. 222, 230–31 (S.D.N.Y. 2007), \naffirmed in part and vacated in part on other grounds, 609 F.3d 467 (2d Cir. 2010). \nThere are numerous factual and legal issues common to the class.  Most centrally, the case \nis about the NYPD’s response to specific protests on specific dates in specific neighborhoods at \nwhich  all  class  members  were  present  and  experienced  the  same  or  similar  conduct.    In \n  16 \n\n \nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 166   Filed 07/19/23   Page 21 of 28\nMacNamara, this court certified subclasses of arrestees from the Republican National Convention \nprotests under markedly similar circumstances.  The court found that the commonality requirement \nwas met because the mass arrests of protestors presented common questions of fact and law, \nincluding, whether officers arrested protestors without probable cause, whether officers issued \ndispersal orders and provided an opportunity to disperse, and whether officers acted pursuant to \nan unlawful policy or practice of indiscriminate mass arrest.  MacNamara, 275 F.R.D. at 143; see \nalso Black Lives Matter Los Angeles v. City of Los Angeles, No. 20-CV-5027, Dkt. # 174 (C.D. \nCal. Oct. 3, 2022) (certifying class of protestors subjected to mass arrest during first week of Black \nLives Matter protests). \nC.  Typicality \nThe Named Plaintiffs’ experiences and claims are typical of those in the class.  Here, “each \nclass member’s claim arises from the same course of events”—their arrest, or experience of police \nforce at the Settlement Locations “and each class member makes similar legal arguments to prove \nthe defendant’s liability.”  In re Flag Telecom Holdings, Ltd. Sec. Litig., 574 F.3d 29, 35 (2d \nCir.2009).  “[T]he same unlawful conduct was directed at or affected both the named plaintiff[s] \nand the class sought to be represented.”  Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 936–37 (2d Cir. 1993).  \nSpecifically, each Named Plaintiff, and the class members, were subjected to a coordinated police \naction.  The Class Representatives claims arise from the same factual and legal circumstances that \nform the bases of the Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 Class Members’ claims. \nD.  Adequacy of the Class Representatives \nThe Named Plaintiffs have no interests that are “antagonistic to those of the []class \nmembers,” and “there is no dispute that if the named Plaintiffs prevail, the putative class members \nwill also benefit, since all were subject to the same allegedly unconstitutional course of conduct.”  \nMacNamara, 275 F.R.D. at 144.  Accordingly, the Named Plaintiffs—most of whom were present \n  17 \n\n \nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 166   Filed 07/19/23   Page 22 of 28\nat the 18 locations listed above, marched peacefully, were subjected to the use of force and \narrested, were placed in tight flexicuffs, and were given summonses or desk appearance tickets—\nare adequate representatives of the proposed class. \nII.  THE PROPOSED CLASS SATISFIES THE RULE 23(B)(3) FACTORS \nIn addition to satisfying the Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) factors, the Proposed Class meets the \nmore stringent requirements necessary to certify a damages class under Rule 23(b)(3), which \nrequires that common questions of law or fact “predominate” over individual matters, and that a \nclass action is “superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the \ncontroversy.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). \nFirst, Plaintiffs can demonstrate that “the issues in the class action that are subject to \ngeneralized proof, and thus applicable to the class as a whole, predominate over those issues that \nare subject only to individualized proof.”  Cordes & Co. Fin. Serv., Inc. v. A.G. Edwards & Sons, \nInc.,  502  F.3d  91,  107–08  (2d  Cir.  2007).    Like  the  certified  mass  arrest  subclasses  in \nMacNamara, common issues predominate over individual ones in this case, where hundreds of \npeople were arrested at a single location under a single plan orchestrated by Defendants. Because \nthe Proposed Class comprises “individuals who were arrested as part of a group based on the \nalleged conduct of the group,” and not their individual actions, the Court can find predominance.  \nMacNamara, 275 F.R.D. at 146.  Further, while “assessment of damages may ultimately require \nindividualized inquiries, that possibility is no bar to class certification here.”  Id.  “[F]actors \nrelevant to the superiority analysis include: the interest of class members in controlling separate \nactions; the extent and nature of existing litigation concerning the controversy; the desirability or \nundesirability of concentrating litigation of the class claims in the particular forum; and the likely \ndifficulties in managing a class action.”  Id. at 148.  A class action is certainly the most fair and \nefficient way of resolving this case.  Almost three years have passed since these protests, and the \n  18 \n\n \nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 166   Filed 07/19/23   Page 23 of 28\nvast majority of the putative class members have not filed separate actions.  In addition, “the \nlikely difficulties in managing a class action” are not greater here – particularly where Plaintiffs \nseek certification under Rule 23(e) as part of a proposed money-damages class settlement – than \nthe difficulties of continuing to litigate as one of the Consolidated Cases, which have presented \ntheir own management difficulties. \nIndeed,  whatever  “‘management  difficulties’  that  might  accompany  the  proposed \ncertification are certainly no greater than the management difficulties that would inevitably result \nfrom hundreds of separate trials.”  Id.  “Given the number of class members injured” by the \nNYPD’s alleged conduct, “a class action is not only the most efficient and convenient method to \nresolve this controversy, it is the only ‘fair’ and ‘efficient’ means to adjudicate this controversy.”  \nIn re NASDAQ Market-Makers Antitrust Litig., 169 F.R.D. 493, 527 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). \nPLAINTIFFS’ COUNSEL SHOULD BE APPOINTED AS CLASS COUNSEL \nPlaintiffs’ Counsel are appropriate Class Counsel under Rule 23(g), which sets forth the \nfour criteria for appointing class counsel: (1) “the work counsel has done in identifying or \ninvestigating potential claims in the action”; (2) “counsel’s experience in handling class actions, \nother complex litigation, and the types of claims asserted in the action”; (3) “counsel’s knowledge \nof the applicable law”; and (4) “the resources that counsel will commit to representing the class.”  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A).  The Court may also consider any other matter pertinent to counsel’s \nability to fairly and adequately represent the class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(B). \nPlaintiffs’ Counsel have successfully and efficiently worked together on this case for the \nlast two and a half years.  Moore Decl. ¶ 14.  Plaintiffs’ counsel are highly experienced in complex \nclass actions and have prosecuted numerous class actions.  Id. ¶¶ 15–20.

(injunctive claims, including a revised Patrol Guide policy, resolved on June 11, 2021); \nSyed v City of New York, No. 16-CV-04789 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (class certified on February 15, 2019); \nMcLennon v City of New York, No. 14-CV-6320 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (injunctive claims resolved on \nMarch 3, 2020); Floyd v City of New York, No. 08-CV-1034 (S.D.N.Y.) (currently in remedial \nstage); Daniels v City of New York, 198 F.R.D. 409, 418 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (“Aided by the capable \nhands of Jonathan C. Moore . . . , class counsel is undoubtedly qualified and experienced to \nconduct this litigation”); MacNamara, 275 F.R.D. at 154 (S.D.N.Y. 2011).  Moore Decl. ¶ 16.  \nAttorneys at BLH have litigated hundreds of civil rights claims against the City of New York, \nmany of which pertained to the NYPD’s policies and practices and have a breadth of knowledge \nof the NYPD issuing summons in an allegedly unlawful pattern that is demonstrative of racially \nbiased enforcement. \nCohen and Green, PLLC, (“C&G”) attorneys have litigated a number of class actions and \npolice suits, including, but not limited to: Jones v. United States Postal Service, No. 20-CV-6516 \n(S.D.N.Y.) (nationwide voting rights class action); Edrei v. Bratton, No.16-CV-1652 (S.D.N.Y.), \naff’d sub. nom. Edrei v.

Moore Decl. ¶ 18. \nGideon Orion Oliver has over 18 years of experience litigating civil rights cases against \nthe NYPD, including hundreds of cases challenging the City’s policies, practices, and customs \nrelated to protest policing.  Sow FAC ¶ 460.  Oliver has frequently co-counseled with BLH \n  20 \n\n \nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 166   Filed 07/19/23   Page 25 of 28\nattorneys and C&G attorneys in litigation.  Id.  For example, in addition to litigating other 2004 \nRNC-related cases, Oliver was Of Counsel to BLH attorneys at the summary judgment briefing \nstage of the MacNamara RNC 2004 class action litigation.  Id.  Oliver has always maintained a \nportfolio including at least dozens of Plaintiffs’ protest-policing related cases.  One such recent \ncase was Edrei (with C&G).  Moore Decl. ¶ 19.  \nWylie M. Stecklow has extensive experience litigating civil rights both in New York and \nelsewhere including Baltimore, Maryland: Lomax v. O’Ree, No. 24-C-16-2313 (Circuit Court, \nBaltimore City) and Iowa: Cordero v. World Food Prize, No. 17-CV-347 (S.D. Iowa).  Stecklow \nhas been litigating NYPD policies and practices for fifteen (15) years, including, but not limited \nto: Alford v. City of New York, No. 06-CV-2512 (S.D.N.Y.); Peat v. City of New York, No. 12-CV-\n8230 (S.D.N.Y.); Gerskovich v. Iocco, City of New York, No. 15-CV-7280 (S.D.N.Y.); Packard v. \nCity of New York, No. 15-CV-7130 (S.D.N.Y.); Nigro v. City of New York, No. 19-CV-2369 \n(S.D.N.Y.).  He is the former national chair of the Federal Bar Association Civil Rights Section \n(2016-2018); has organized and been a moderator and/or panelist on numerous civil rights CLE \npanels including—since 2017—organizing the biennial Civil Rights Etouffee (1-2 day CLE) in \nNew Orleans; published a scholarly article on Qualified Immunity by the New York State Bar \nAssociation (2020) and a chapter on QI in a text book on Constitutional Policing by American Bar \nAssociation (2023); is an adjunct professor of law at Fordham University School of Law since \n2018; and was the 2021 Sarah T. Hughes Civil Rights Award Honoree presented by the Federal \nBar Association.  Moore Decl. ¶ 20. \nTHE PROPOSED PROCESS FOR NOTIFYING THE CLASS, RECEIVING CLAIM \nFORMS, AND DISTRIBUTING PAYMENTS TO ELIGIBLE CLASS MEMBERS IS FAIR \nAND REASONABLE \nThe Proposed Notices comply with due process and Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.  The Class Notice \nthat will be mailed to class members in two languages, English and Spanish, and the Class Notice \n  21 \n\n \nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 166   Filed 07/19/23   Page 26 of 28\nSummary that will be used in publishing notice also in those two languages, will contain all the \ninformation required by Rule 23(c)(2)(B).  They describe the terms of the settlement, inform the \nclass that Plaintiffs will seek to recover costs, attorneys’ fees, and service/settlement awards from \nthe City, and provide specific information regarding the date, time, and place of the final approval \nhearing.  Moreover, the proposed class administration process involves establishing a website, \nwhere anyone can easily access the full settlement terms and the Class Notice, and class members \ncan submit a claim form. \nCourts have approved class notices even when they provided only general information \nabout a settlement.  See In re Michael Milken & Assocs. Sec. Litig., 150 F.R.D. 57, 60 (S.D.N.Y. \n1993) (class notice “need only describe the terms of the settlement generally”).  The detailed \ninformation in the proposed Notices—and the easily accessibility of a detailed website—far \nexceeds this bare minimum and fully complies with the requirements of Rule 23 (c)(2)(B). \nThe Parties have agreed to a clear and comprehensive plan to send out notice to all class \nmembers, provide time for inquiries and claim submission, and pay out all timely legitimate \nclaims.  Agr. ¶ 36–39.  Specifically, no more than 45 days after the Preliminary Approval Order is \nissued, the Claim Package will be mailed directly to all Class Members at their last known \naddresses.  Id. ¶ 57.  Notice will also be published in Spanish and English language newspapers.  \nId. ¶ 37.  To receive a payment, class members must timely submit a Claim Form, either by mail \nor online, by the deadline set by the Court.  Id. ¶ 61.  Those members wishing to opt out of or \nobject to the settlement will need to do so by the same deadline.  Id. ¶ 71.  With help from the \nParties, the Claims Administrator will be responsible for determining who is eligible for payment \nand calculating class payments from an established Class Fund.  Id. ¶ 51. \nThe Parties propose that Plaintiffs submit their motion for final approval by 14 days before \n  22 \n\n \nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 166   Filed 07/19/23   Page 27 of 28\nthe Fairness Hearing and that the Fairness Hearing take place on a date convenient to the Court \nsometime after the administration of the claims.  The Agreement proposes that the Claims \nAdministrator will begin paying class members after the Final Approval Order, unless there is an \nappeal.  Id. ¶ 47. \nTHE PROPOSED CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR IS ADEQUATE \nThe  parties  have  agreed  to  retain  Rust  Consulting,  Inc.  to  serve  as  the  Claims \nAdministrator.  Id. ¶ 49.  Rust has 30+ years of class action settlement administration experience \nand  has  administered  more  than  5,200  class  action  settlements,  judgments,  and  similar \nadministrative programs. Rust employs a permanent staff of more than 200.  Rust has handled \nclaims administration in matters in this district and involving the City of New York, including, but \nnot limited to, Stinson, et al. v. City of New York, No. 10-CV-4228 (S.D.N.Y) (RWS), and the \nSierra-Wood  class  action  pending  before  this  Court.    Attached  as  Exhibit  2  to  the  Moore \nDeclaration is a declaration from then-Senior Vice President of Rust Tiffaney Janowicz, filed in \nthe Stinson case, explaining Rust’s experience and services.  The costs of Class Administration \nwill be paid by the City of New York.  Id. ¶ 45. \nCONCLUSION \nBecause the Proposed Settlement is fair and reasonable and serves the interests of the \nproposed Class, this Court should enter the proposed Stipulation of Settlement and Order and \npreliminarily approve the class settlement, conditionally certify the class, appoint Plaintiffs’ \nCounsel as Class Counsel, approve the claims administration process, and approve the appointment \nof Rust as Claims Administrator. \n   \n  23 \n\n \nCase 1:21-cv-00533-CM   Document 166   Filed 07/19/23   Page 28 of 28\nDated: July 19, 2023 \n  New York, New York \n \nBELDOCK LEVINE & HOFFMAN LLP  GIDEON ORION OLIVER \n   \n   \n   \nBy:              __________________________ \nJonathan C.

(“PBA”) appeals the denial \nof its motion to intervene as of right pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 24(a) in six civil actions consolidated under the caption In \nre New York City Policing During Summer 2020 Demonstrations. Both \nNew York State and private plaintiffs brought the actions, which \nname as defendants the City of New York and its leadership (“City”), \nthe New York City Police Department and its leadership (“NYPD”), \nand NYPD officers in their individual and official capacities. The \nclaims  relate  to  police  actions  and  practices  in  response  to \ndemonstrations that occurred in the summer of 2020. We hold that the \ndistrict court erred in holding that the PBA did not have a cognizable \ninterest in the personal safety of its member officers at the merits \nstages of the actions seeking injunctive or declaratory relief and that \nsuch interests were adequately represented. We therefore reverse the \njudgment of the district court as to those cases and remand with \ninstructions to grant the PBA’s motion to intervene. \nBACKGROUND \nI \n  In re New York City Policing During Summer 2020 Demonstrations \nincludes six civil actions. In each, the plaintiffs allege that the NYPD \nacted unlawfully at demonstrations occurring in the summer of 2020.   \nA \n  Three actions were brought by individual plaintiffs on behalf \nof themselves or putative classes against the City, the NYPD, and \nNYPD officers. The plaintiffs in these actions allege violations of the \nfederal and New York State constitutions, New York civil rights law, \n4 \n\nCasCea s1e:2 211-c-1v-301065, 3D3o-CcuMm  e Dnto 1cu3m5,e 0n3t /10248/2  0 F22ile, d3 20731/0643/12,2 P  a Pgaeg5e o 5f  2o2f 22\nand common-law torts. The actions seek injunctive or declaratory \nrelief as well as damages.1 Another action, People of the State of New \nYork v. City of New York, No. 21-CV-322, was brought by the New York \nState  Attorney  General  against  the  City  and  the  NYPD,  alleging \nviolations of the federal and New York State constitutions as well as \nother  violations  of  New  York  law,  and  seeks  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief. The final two actions were brought by individuals on \nbehalf of themselves or putative classes against the City, the NYPD, \nand NYPD officers, alleging violations of the federal and New York \nState constitutions and common-law torts. These actions seek only \ndamages.2 \nThe complaints in each of the cases allege that the NYPD used \nexcessive force, engaged in unreasonable searches and seizures, and \nviolated First Amendment rights of the press and peaceful assembly. \nThe  Sow  plaintiffs,  for  example,  refer  to  “militarized  tactics,” \nincluding  “massive  amounts”  of  NYPD  officers  “in  riot  gear \nincluding riot helmets and militarized” vehicles intended to “alarm[]” \n1 These actions are Payne v. de Blasio, No. 20-CV-8924; Sow v. City of New \nYork, No. 21-CV-533; and Sierra v. City of New York, No. 20-CV-10291. The \nSierra action seeks a declaratory judgment as well as damages. The Sierra \nplaintiffs argue that their request for declaratory relief is “limited” to “a \nrequest for ‘a declaration that past conduct was unlawful.’” Sierra, Wood, \nand Yates Appellees’ Br. 3 (quoting In re New York City Policing During \nSummer  2020  Demonstrations,  No.  20-CV-8924,  2021  WL  2894764,  at  *5 \n(S.D.N.Y. July 9, 2021)). Because such a declaration would declare unlawful \n“the  City’s  policies,  practices,  and/or  customs,”  App’x  337,  Sierra  is \nproperly considered alongside those actions that seek injunctive relief. \n2 These actions are Yates v. New York City, No. 21-CV-1904, and Wood v. City \nof New York, No. 20-CV-10541. Two additional cases, Rolon v. City of New \nYork, No. 21-CV-2548, and Hernandez v. City of New York, No. 21-CV-7406, \nwere filed after the PBA’s intervention motion and are therefore not at issue \nin this appeal. \n5 \n\nCasCea s1e:2 211-c-1v-301065, 3D3o-CcuMm  e Dnto 1cu3m5,e 0n3t /10248/2  0 F22ile, d3 20731/0643/12,2 P  a Pgaeg6e o 6f  2o2f 22\nand “deter[]” protesters. App’x 270. Likewise, the Attorney General \nalleges in the People case that many NYPD officers who responded to \nprotests “appeared in full riot gear, including external Kevlar vests, \nhelmets, and forearm plates,” before “unlawfully arrest[ing] over 300 \nindividuals” in a campaign of “excessive force” that culminated in \n“mass detentions and arrests.” App’x 127-28.  \nIndividual  plaintiffs  allege  that  such  tactics  were  deployed \nunlawfully against them when, for example, a “group of at least 100 \nNYPD officers form[ed] a line” and “began to move towards the \nprotesters with their helmets on and batons out.” App’x 245. An \nofficer then allegedly “pointed his drawn baton at” one plaintiff, \n“lunged at” her, “forcefully knocked the phone” out of her hands, \n“struck” her “across her chest,” and “began beating [her] on the arms \nand  upper  body,”  at  which  point  “[a]dditional  NYPD  members \ndescended” to “beat her with their batons and kick[] her.” App’x 245-\n46. The plaintiffs allege that such interactions reflect the NYPD’s \n“long history of violence towards Black and Latinx people,” App’x \n158, and “historical brutality against protesters,” App’x 271. \nB \nFour  of  the  consolidated  actions  seek  broad  injunctive  and \ndeclaratory relief. For example, the Attorney General asks that the \ndistrict court  \n[e]njoin Defendants … from implementing, applying, or \ntaking any action whatsoever under its unconstitutional \npolicies or practices of employing excessive force, false \narrests, and retaliatory tactics … in the form of an order \nrequiring  Defendants  to  take  all  affirmative  steps, \nincluding  changing  policies,  conducting  training,  and \nundergoing monitoring, among others, to … eliminate \n6 \n\nCasCea s1e:2 211-c-1v-301065, 3D3o-CcuMm  e Dnto 1cu3m5,e 0n3t /10248/2  0 F22ile, d3 20731/0643/12,2 P  a Pgaeg7e o 7f  2o2f 22\nongoing unlawful policing practices and their effects, \nand … prevent this unlawful conduct in the future.  \nApp’x 148. The Attorney General further requests that the district \ncourt “[i]ssue an order holding unlawful, vacating, and setting aside \nDefendants’ policies or practices of employing excessive force and \nfalse arrests, suppressing free expression and press reporting, and \nretaliating  against”  who  participated  in  the  Summer  2020 \ndemonstrations. App’x 148.  \n  Similarly,  the  Sow  plaintiffs  request  that  the  district  court \n“[i]ssue a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant City of New \nYork and the NYPD from violently disrupting protests.” App’x 299. \nAnd  the  Sierra  plaintiffs  ask  that  the  district  court  declare \nunconstitutional  “defendants’  conduct  and  the  City’s  policies, \npractices, and/or customs of retaliating against peaceful protesters out \nof  hostility  toward  their  message,  arresting  protesters  without \nprobable  cause,  using  excessive  force  against  the  protesters,  and \ntargeting  protesters  for  law  enforcement  action  because  of  their \nadvocacy for racial justice and equality.” App’x 337.  \n  By  contrast,  the  plaintiffs  in  Yates  and  Wood  seek  neither \ndeclaratory nor injunctive relief. \nII \nOn March 3, 2021, the Police Benevolent Association of the City \nof New York, Inc. (“PBA”) moved to intervene as of right in the \nconsolidated actions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a). The \nPBA is “the designated collective bargaining agent for the more than \n23,000 police officers employed by the NYPD,” and its “core mission” \nis “to advocate for and protect the interests of … the front-line police \nofficers of the NYPD.” App’x 66.9-66.10. The PBA argued that it had \ninterests  at  stake  at  both  the  merits  and  remedy  phases  of  the \n7 \n\nCasCea s1e:2 211-c-1v-301065, 3D3o-CcuMm  e Dnto 1cu3m5,e 0n3t /10248/2  0 F22ile, d3 20731/0643/12,2 P  a Pgaeg8e o 8f  2o2f 22\nlitigation and that the parties did not adequately represent those \ninterests.  \nThe PBA identified an interest in maintaining officer safety that \nwould be affected if the policies that governed front-line officers’ \nrules of engagement with demonstrators were declared unlawful or \notherwise  altered.  According  to  the  PBA,  front-line  officers  who \nresponded to the Summer 2020 protests suffered multiple casualties. \nFor  example,  the  PBA  described  a  female  officer  who  suffered \nfractured vertebrae from being repeatedly kicked in the head at a \ndemonstration, even though she was wearing a helmet. App’x 66.24. \nAnother officer “was struck in the face with a brick,” which bounced \noff the face shield of his helmet, striking his shoulder. App’x 66.25. \nAnd in responding to a reported robbery at a retail store during the \nprotests, another officer was run over by the getaway vehicle, and he \n“sustained injuries to his back, knee, and hip.” App’x 66.26-66.27.  \nThe  PBA  also  criticized  the  leadership  of  the  City  and  the \nNYPD for failing to provide guidance to police officers in advance of \nprotests occurring on May 29, 2020, and for adopting a posture of \n“business  as  usual.”  App’x  66.23.  The  PBA  argued  that  “NYPD \nmanagement was taking a purely reactive and defensive approach, \nand  had  failed  to  account  for  the  escalating  violence  witnessed \naround the country on previous nights and in New York City the \nnight prior,” and as a result “a significant number of police officers \nassigned to protest details … were not equipped with disorder control \nhelmets,” a “standard” piece of protective equipment. App’x 66.23. \nThe PBA suggested that the approach of management caused officer \ninjuries, including one officer who was “hit in the back of the head \nwith a metal trash can” after he was “instructed by supervisors to \nleave his helmet in the vehicle.” App’x 66.25. The PBA reported that \n8 \n\nCasCea s1e:2 211-c-1v-301065, 3D3o-CcuMm  e Dnto 1cu3m5,e 0n3t /10248/2  0 F22ile, d3 20731/0643/12,2 P  a Pgaeg9e o 9f  2o2f 22\n“nearly 400 police officers … were injured during the protests.” App’x \n66.24.  \nIn its motion papers, the PBA connected its interest in officer \nsafety to its role in negotiating collective-bargaining agreements with \nthe City. As the collective-bargaining agent for the officers, the PBA \nhas  the  right  to  bargain  over  “questions  concerning  the  practical \nimpact that” even non-negotiable management “decisions … have on \nterms and conditions of employment, including … questions of … \nemployee safety.” N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 12-307(b). However, the \nPBA maintains that its interest in officer safety is “not limited to \n‘collective-bargaining  rights’”  but  independently  serves  as  a \ncognizable interest entitling it to intervene as of right. Appellant’s Br. \n12.  \nThe PBA argued that both the merits and remedies phases of \nthe  litigation  implicated  its  interest  in  officer  safety  because  the \n“sweeping  demands  for  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  in  the \ncomplaints” could “encompass restrictions on NYPD officers’ ability \nto use defensive and non-lethal equipment … to protect themselves” \nin future protests. App’x 66.18. Because any conclusions of the district \ncourt on the merits would affect the scope of a resulting settlement \nagreement  between  the  parties  and  would  constrain  the  policy \noptions  available  for  new  rules  of  engagement,  the  PBA  said  its \nintervention at the merits stage is necessary.  \nIII \nThe district court denied the PBA’s motion to intervene in the \nconsolidated  actions  on  April  28,  2021.  The  district  court \ncharacterized the PBA’s interest as “an interest in [its] collective-\nbargaining  rights,  and  how  any  future  injunctions  or \nsettlements/consent  decrees  might  impact  working  conditions  or \n9 \n\nCasCea s1e:2 211-c-1v-301065, 3D3o-CcuMm  e Dnto 1cu3m5,e 0n3t /10248/2  0 F22ile, d3 20731/0643/12,2 P  a Pgaeg1e0  1o0f  2o2f 22\nofficer  safety.”  In  re  New  York  City  Policing  During  Summer  2020 \nDemonstrations, 537 F. Supp. 3d 507, 512 (S.D.N.Y. 2021). The district \ncourt concluded that because “[a]t this early stage of the litigation, the \nprimary question … is whether certain NYPD policies are, in fact, \nunconstitutional—an issue that has nothing to do with the unions’ \ncollective-bargaining rights”—the PBA had no “protectable interest” \nthat would justify its intervention. Id. at 515. The PBA “might have an \ninterest” only “if the parties were to propose a settlement that would \nresult in changes to NYPD tactics/personnel procedures, or if the \n[district c]ourt, at the remedy stage after liability was found, was \nconsidering the imposition of injunctive relief that would have the \nsame effect” because “such relief might have a practical impact on the \nunions’ collective-bargaining interests.” Id. at 512.   \n  The merits stage of the litigation, according to the district court, \ndid not implicate a cognizable interest of the PBA in officer safety \nbecause at the merits stage “the focus is on whether … certain NYPD \ntactics during protests are unconstitutional,” id., and “[t]he unions \nhave  not  demonstrated  why  they  have  a  protectable  interest  in \npreserving any allegedly unconstitutional policies that the NYPD \nmight be employing,” id. at 515. The district court denied the PBA’s \nmotion  to  intervene  “without  prejudice  to  renewal  if  changed \ncircumstances give rise to a legitimate impact on the unions’ collective \nbargaining rights,” id. at 516, in particular “if the City agrees to any \nproposed  settlement  or  consent  decree  that  impacts  the  unions’ \ncollective-bargaining rights, or if the [district c]ourt proposes to order \ninjunctive relief that does so,” id. at 520. \nOn appeal, the PBA argues that the district court abused its \ndiscretion in denying the motion to intervene. The PBA contends that \nit  is  entitled  to  intervene  on  the  basis  not  only  of  its  interest  in \n10 \n\nCasCea s1e:2 211-c-1v-301065, 3D3o-CcuMm  e Dnto 1cu3m5,e 0n3t /10248/2  0 F22ile, d3 20731/0643/12,2 P  a Pgaeg1e1  1o1f  2o2f 22\ncollective bargaining but also of its related but independent interest \nin protecting the personal safety of its member officers.3  \nDISCUSSION \n  “On timely motion, the [district] court must permit anyone to \nintervene  who  …  claims  an  interest  relating  to  the  property  or \ntransaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that \ndisposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the \nmovant’s  ability  to  protect  its  interest,  unless  existing  parties \nadequately represent that interest.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a). To prevail on \na motion for intervention as of right, a movant must “(1) timely file \nan application, (2) show an interest in the action, (3) demonstrate that \nthe interest may be impaired by the disposition of the action, and \n(4) show that the interest is not protected adequately by the parties to \nthe action.” “R” Best Produce, Inc. v. Shulman-Rabin Mktg. Corp., 467 \nF.3d 238, 240 (2d Cir. 2006).   \n  No one disputes that the PBA timely filed its motion. This \nappeal turns on whether the PBA sufficiently identified a protectable \ninterest at stake in the litigation. “For an interest to be cognizable by \nRule 24(a)(2), it must be ‘direct, substantial, and legally protectable.’” \nBridgeport Guardians, Inc. v. Delmonte, 602 F.3d 469, 473 (2d Cir. 2010) \n(quoting Wash. Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 922 \nF.2d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 1990)). The district court concluded, and the \nappellees contend, that the PBA failed to show that it has a cognizable \ninterest that the dispositions of the consolidated actions may impair \nand that the parties do not adequately represent.   \n \n3 The PBA also claims to have an interest in protecting the reputations of its \nmember  officers.  Because  the  interest  in  officer  safety  is  sufficient  to \nestablish a right to intervention under Rule 24(a), we need not consider the \nPBA’s interests in officers’ reputations or in collective bargaining.  \n11 \n\nCasCea s1e:2 211-c-1v-301065, 3D3o-CcuMm  e Dnto 1cu3m5,e 0n3t /10248/2  0 F22ile, d3 20731/0643/12,2 P  a Pgaeg1e2  1o2f  2o2f 22\n  We review the district court’s denial of a motion to intervene as \nof right for abuse of discretion. Id. A district court has abused its \ndiscretion if it “based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law,” \n“made a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,” or “rendered \na decision that cannot be located within the range of permissible \ndecisions.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nWe  hold  that  the  PBA  identified  a  direct,  substantial,  and \nlegally protectable interest in officer safety that may be impaired by \nthe disposition of those actions seeking declaratory or injunctive relief \nwith respect to NYPD policies. The PBA also showed that its interest \nwas  not  adequately  represented  by  the  parties  to  those  actions. \nAccordingly,  we  reverse  the  judgment  of  the  district  court  and \nremand with instructions to grant the PBA’s motion to intervene in \nthose actions.  \nI \n  The PBA asserted an interest in the safety of front-line officers. \nThat interest may be impaired in litigation that could result in a \ndetermination  that  NYPD  policies  governing  the  interaction  of \nofficers and protesters are unlawful and must be altered. Therefore, \nthe PBA has a cognizable interest at stake in those actions seeking \ndeclaratory or injunctive relief with respect to NYPD policies—that is, \nthe Payne, Sow, Sierra, and People actions. The district court erred in \nconcluding otherwise.  \nA \nThe  district  court  mischaracterized  the  PBA’s  interest  as \n“preserving any allegedly unconstitutional policies that the NYPD \nmight be employing, such as the use of excessive force or unlawful \narrests,” and it erred in holding that officer safety would not be \nimplicated in litigation over police policies because “officers are not \n12 \n\nCasCea s1e:2 211-c-1v-301065, 3D3o-CcuMm  e Dnto 1cu3m5,e 0n3t /10248/2  0 F22ile, d3 20731/0643/12,2 P  a Pgaeg1e3  1o3f  2o2f 22\nallowed  to  violate  the  constitutional  rights  of  citizens.”  537 \nF. Supp. 3d at 515-16. This reasoning begs the question to be decided\nin  the  litigation—whether  the  challenged  policies  are  in  fact\nunlawful—and thereby confuses the merits of the litigation with the\nstandard  for  intervention  under  Rule  24(a)(2).  As  we  have\nemphasized,  “except  for  allegations  frivolous  on  their  face,  an\napplication  to  intervene  cannot  be  resolved  by  reference  to  the\nultimate merits of the claims which the intervenor wishes to assert\nfollowing intervention.” Oneida Indian Nation of Wisc. v. State of New\nYork, 732 F.2d 261, 265 (2d Cir. 1984).\nThe merits question before the district court is whether certain \nNYPD policies are permissible. The answer to that question may \nrequire a change in those policies. And changing the policies that \ngovern  officer  conduct  may  affect  officer  safety.  That  means  the \nlitigation—at the merits phase—may impair the PBA’s interest. \nThe district court quoted the Ninth Circuit in stating that “it \ngoes without saying that the unions ‘and the officers [they] represent \nhave  no  protectable  interest  in  violating  other  individuals’ \nconstitutional rights.’” 537 F. Supp. 3d at 515 (quoting United States v. \nCity of Los Angeles, 288 F.3d 391, 398-99 (9th Cir. 2002)). But the Ninth \nCircuit—in  that  very  passage—specifically  rejected  the  view  that \nbecause a police union and its officers do not have an interest in \nviolating constitutional rights, the union lacks an interest in the merits \nphase  of  litigation  that  will  determine  whether  officers  violated \nconstitutional rights:  \nOf course, as the district court noted, the Police League \nand the officers it represents have no protectable interest \nin violating other individuals’ constitutional rights. No \none  could  seriously  argue  otherwise.  However,  the \nPolice League claims a protectable interest because the \n13 \n\nCasCea s1e:2 211-c-1v-301065, 3D3o-CcuMm  e Dnto 1cu3m5,e 0n3t /10248/2  0 F22ile, d3 20731/0643/12,2 P  a Pgaeg1e4  1o4f  2o2f 22\ncomplaint  seeks  injunctive  relief  against  its  member \nofficers and raises factual allegations that its member \nofficers committed unconstitutional acts in the line of \nduty. These allegations are sufficient to demonstrate that the \nPolice League had a protectable interest in the merits phase of \nthe litigation. \nCity of Los Angeles, 288 F.3d at 398-99 (emphasis added). We agree \nwith the Ninth Circuit that there is a crucial difference between an \ninterest in unconstitutional practices, on the one hand, and an interest \nin  the  outcome  of  litigation  seeking  a  determination  that  certain \npractices are unconstitutional, on the other. In this case, as in City of \nLos Angeles, the PBA does not have a protectable interest in acting \nunlawfully. But it does have a protectable interest in the continuation \nor alteration of policies that are alleged to be unlawful—and therefore \nit has such an interest in the outcome of the litigation at issue here. \n  The district court improperly assumed that any decision on the \nmerits  of  the  litigation  would  be  limited  to  prohibiting  unlawful \nconduct and therefore the PBA could not show an interest that would \nbe impaired by such a decision. But Rule 24(a) assumes that questions \nabout  the  lawfulness  of  challenged  conduct  will  be  subject  to \nadversarial testing. If a proposed intervenor has an interest that may \nbe impaired by a decision that challenged conduct is unlawful, the \ndistrict  court  may  not  deny  intervention  on  the  ground  that  its \ndecision on the merits will be legally correct.  \nIn Brennan v. New York City Board of Education, the district court \nhad concluded that non-minority employees of the defendant school \ndistrict lacked “a cognizable interest in their employment status and \nseniority rights” that would justify intervention in a discrimination \ncase  “because  these  benefits  were  presumptively  obtained  as  the \nresult of discriminatory practices.” 260 F.3d 123, 129 (2d Cir. 2001). \n14 \n\nCasCea s1e:2 211-c-1v-301065, 3D3o-CcuMm  e Dnto 1cu3m5,e 0n3t /10248/2  0 F22ile, d3 20731/0643/12,2 P  a Pgaeg1e5  1o5f  2o2f 22\nWe explained that “the district court’s ruling put the cart before the \nhorse.” Id. In the underlying litigation, it was “precisely the existence \nor non-existence of prior discrimination and its relationship to [the \nemployees’] present status that they want to contest by intervening as \nparties.” Id. at 130. It was possible to resolve that merits issue “only \nafter”  the  employees  had  “an  opportunity  for  discovery  and  the \npresentation of evidence as a party to the action.” Id.  \nThe district court’s decision in this case similarly put the cart \nbefore the horse. The PBA seeks to contest the proposition that the \nchallenged policies are unlawful and should be changed. The district \ncourt erred in denying intervention on the ground that this asserted \ninterest amounts to a defense of unlawful policies.   \nB \nThe  district  court  also  erred  as  a  matter  of  law  when  it \nconcluded that the PBA’s interest in officer safety was derivative of \nits interest in collective bargaining. The collective bargaining law \nrecognizes  the  importance  of  employee  safety  by  authorizing \nnegotiation  over  “questions  concerning  the  practical  impact”  of \nmanagement decisions on “employee safety.” N.Y.C. Admin. Code \n§ 12-307(b). But the interest in officer safety is not limited to the PBA’s \ncollective-bargaining rights and is independently cognizable.  \nWe  have  cautioned  against  requiring  that  a  proposed \nintervenor  identify  a  narrow  interest  amounting  to  a  legal \nentitlement. In Brennan, the district court had denied intervention \nbecause the non-minority employees had “no vested property right \nin a particular position or appointment.” 260 F.3d at 128 (quoting \nUnited States v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ., 85 F. Supp. 2d 130, 155 (E.D.N.Y. \n2000)). In reversing the judgment of the district court, we explained \nthat “Rule 24(a)(2) requires not a property interest but, rather, ‘an \n15 \n\nCasCea s1e:2 211-c-1v-301065, 3D3o-CcuMm  e Dnto 1cu3m5,e 0n3t /10248/2  0 F22ile, d3 20731/0643/12,2 P  a Pgaeg1e6  1o6f  2o2f 22\ninterest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of \nthe action.’” Id. at 130 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 24). Because the action \ncould require changes in the personnel policies of the school district, \nwhich would affect the non-minority employees through the “loss of \nrelative seniority,” the intervenors met that standard. Id. Similarly, in \nBridgeport  Guardians,  we  held  that  non-party  employees  had  “an \ninterest  in  their  employers’  employment  practices”  that  justified \nintervention in a discrimination case that could alter those policies. \n602 F.3d at 474.  \nThe appellees suggest that our decision in Floyd v. City of New \nYork, 770 F.3d 1051 (2d Cir. 2014), requires the conclusion that the PBA \nlacks  a  cognizable  interest.  We  are  not  persuaded.  In  Floyd,  we \naffirmed  the  denial  of  motions  by  police  unions  to  intervene  in \nlitigation over the NYPD’s “stop and frisk” practices, which yielded \n“an order imposing remedies … in the form of various ‘reforms’” to \nthose policies. Id. at 1055. In that case, however, we noted that “there \nwas no evidence in the record showing that the union members’ \ncareers had been tarnished, that their safety was in jeopardy, or that \nthey had been adversely affected in any tangible way.” Id. at 1061. By \ncontrast, the record in this case more clearly shows that changes to \npolicies affecting interactions between officers and protesters may \naffect  officer  safety.  The  PBA  introduced  evidence  that  officers \nsuffered  injuries  during  interactions  with  protesters  because  of \npolicies governing the rules of engagement with protesters and the \nequipment issued to officers. See App’x 66.24-66.27. The plaintiffs in \nthe consolidated actions seek to change those policies to be more \nprotective of the protesters and correspondingly less focused on the \nsafety  interest  of  the  front-line  officers.  The  PBA  is  asserting  an \ninterest in officer safety that is “the mirror image” of the claims \n16 \n\nCasCea s1e:2 211-c-1v-301065, 3D3o-CcuMm  e Dnto 1cu3m5,e 0n3t /10248/2  0 F22ile, d3 20731/0643/12,2 P  a Pgaeg1e7  1o7f  2o2f 22\npressed in the individual actions, Brennan, 260 F.3d at 130, and that \ninterest justifies its intervention.  \nC \nThe  district  court  distinguished  Brennan  and  Bridgeport \nGuardians on the ground that the motions for intervention were filed \nin  those  cases  after  “the  parties  to  the  lawsuit  had  agreed  on  a \nsettlement.”  537  F. Supp. 3d  at  516.  But  in  neither  Brennan  nor \nBridgeport  Guardians  did  we  hold  that  such  an  agreement  was \nnecessary  to  establish  a  cognizable  interest.  To  the  contrary,  we \nfocused  on  “the  nature  of  appellants’  interest  in  the  underlying \naction,” in light of the relief being sought, and we cautioned district \ncourts against requiring too direct a connection between the interest \nasserted and the relief sought. “[T]he effects of a loss of relative \nseniority rights,” we said, “should not be regarded as too speculative \nand remote to justify intervention save, perhaps, in a case where a \nconcrete effect on an employee is impossible.” Brennan, 260 F.3d at \n129,  132  (footnote  omitted).  Given  the  relatively  straightforward \nconnection  between  the  relief  sought  in  this  case  and  the  PBA’s \nclaimed interest, the PBA’s interest is not too remote. \n  In Floyd, we faulted the police unions for failing to move to \nintervene before the parties agreed to the remedial order that settled \nthe litigation. We said that the “unions knew, or should have known, \nof their alleged interests in these controversial and public cases well \nbefore they filed their motions” because “the full scope of these cases \nand the potential reform measures were readily apparent from years \nof extensive public filings and intense media scrutiny.” Floyd, 770 F.3d \nat 1054, 1058. We explained that the litigation “should have put the \nunions on notice of the potential political and judicial dangers that \nthese cases posed to their interests well before” the remedial order \n17 \n\nCasCea s1e:2 211-c-1v-301065, 3D3o-CcuMm  e Dnto 1cu3m5,e 0n3t /10248/2  0 F22ile, d3 20731/0643/12,2 P  a Pgaeg1e8  1o8f  2o2f 22\nand, for that reason, we would not “allow[] the unions to revive a \nnow-settled dispute by intervening at this late juncture.” Id. at 1054, \n1058. \n  Our decision in Floyd is incompatible with the conclusion that \nthe PBA must await a settlement agreement in order to establish an \ninterest justifying intervention under Rule 24(a)(2). As in Floyd, the \nscope of these cases and the potential reform measures are apparent \nfrom the character of the actions that seek to “hold[] unlawful” and \n“vacat[e] … policies” that allegedly authorize “excessive force and \nfalse arrests.” App’x 148. The nature and scope of any injunctive relief \nand accommodations could turn on political calculations with respect \nto which the individual officer defendants would not be influential \nand to which they may not even be privy. Likewise, the nature and \nscope  of  any  injunctive  relief  would  likely  be  influenced  by  the \ncircumstances shown in discovery and the resolution of issues that \nmay predate the remedy phase. We therefore hold that the PBA has \nidentified an interest that may be impaired by the disposition of the \nconsolidated actions.  \nII \nWe further hold that the PBA has “carried the minimal burden \nrequired for a showing that representation by the existing parties may \nbe inadequate.” LaRouche v. FBI, 677 F.2d 256, 258 (2d Cir. 1982). The \ndistrict court correspondingly erred in concluding that the PBA’s \ninterest  in  officer  safety  was  adequately  represented  by  the  City \ndefendants.  \nIntervention under Rule 24(a)(2) is warranted when there is \n“sufficient doubt about the adequacy of representation.” Trbovich v. \nUnited Mine Workers of Am., 404 U.S. 528, 538 (1972). This requirement \n“is satisfied if the applicant shows that representation of his interest \n18 \n\nCasCea s1e:2 211-c-1v-301065, 3D3o-CcuMm  e Dnto 1cu3m5,e 0n3t /10248/2  0 F22ile, d3 20731/0643/12,2 P  a Pgaeg1e9  1o9f  2o2f 22\n‘may be’ inadequate; and the burden of making that showing should \nbe treated as minimal.” Id. at 538 n.10. We have explained that an \nemployer may inadequately represent the interest of its employees \nwhen the employer may have an interest in “bringing such litigation \nto an end by settlements involving the displacement of employees \nwho are not parties to the action.” Brennan, 260 F.3d at 133. “The \nemployer may, in short, behave like a stakeholder rather than an \nadvocate” for those employees. Id.  \nWe observed in Floyd that it was not evident that the City “ever” \nadequately protected the interests of NYPD officers. 770 F.3d at 1059. \nWe  noted  that  “the  interests  of  employers  and  their  employees \nfrequently  diverge,  especially  in  the  context  of  municipal \nemployment, where an employer’s interests are often not congruent \nwith the employee’s and the employer may argue that the employee \nwas acting outside the scope of his employment.” Id. Given “[t]his \ninherent conflict,” we said that “it should have been readily apparent \nto the [police] unions that their interests diverged from the City’s long \nbefore the unions filed for intervention.” Id. And we emphasized that \nthe  inadequacy-of-representation  standard  was  met  before  any \nsettlement was discussed: “the unions should have known that their \n‘interests might not be adequately represented’ far in advance of any \nindication that the City might settle the dispute.” Id. (quoting Butler, \nFitzgerald & Potter v. Sequa Corp., 250 F.3d 171, 182 (2d Cir. 2001)).  \nIn this case, the PBA has shown that its interest might not be \nadequately represented by the City. The PBA provided a detailed \naccount of how its view of the appropriate response to the Summer \n2020 protests diverged from the views of the City and the NYPD. \nIndeed, the PBA argued that the approach of the City and the NYPD \nresulted in officer injuries. App’x 66.23. In addition, the PBA took \naccount  of  the  “widely  understood  …  views  of  the  incumbent \n19 \n\nCasCea s1e:2 211-c-1v-301065, 3D3o-CcuMm  e Dnto 1cu3m5,e 0n3t /10248/2  0 F22ile, d3 20731/0643/12,2 P  a Pgaeg2e0  2o0f  2o2f 22\nmunicipal administration.” Floyd, 770 F.3d at 1058. As the PBA notes, \nafter the Attorney General filed the complaint in the People action \nagainst the City, the Mayor of the City announced that he had met \nwith the Attorney General and “couldn’t agree more that there are \npressing reforms that must—and will—be made this year.” App’x \n66.17-66.18.  On  this  record,  the  PBA  has  met  its  burden  to \ndemonstrate that the City’s representation may be inadequate.   \nWe also agree with the PBA that “[t]he defense of individual \ndamage actions is not comparable to the defense of a high-profile, \npolitically  charged  litigation  seeking  ‘reforms.’”  Reply  Br.  9. \nAccordingly, the individual officers named as defendants in some of \nthe actions do not necessarily represent the PBA’s interest. While the \nindividual officers might be interested in the impact of NYPD policies \non officer safety, their interests in the litigation are not “so similar” to \nthose of the PBA that “adequacy of representation” is “assured.” \nBrennan,  260  F.3d  at  133.  Those  officers  may  well  be  primarily \nconcerned  with  vindicating  their  own  conduct  because  personal \nliability  would  predictably  affect  each  individual  officer’s  career. \nMoreover, if the conduct alleged is found to violate “any rule or \nregulation” of the NYPD, N.Y. Gen. Mun. L. § 50-k(3), the City will \nhave grounds to withhold indemnity. As a result, the individual \nofficers have reason to fear financial consequences, and concerns over \npolicing  policies  regarding  officer  safety  are  of  discounted \nimportance. We therefore hold that the district court erred in denying \nthe PBA’s motion to intervene in those actions that seek declaratory \nor injunctive relief regarding NYPD policies.4   \n4  We  do  not  believe  that  the  PBA  has  shown  a  cognizable  interest \ninadequately represented in those actions that seek only damages against \n20 \n\nCasCea s1e:2 211-c-1v-301065, 3D3o-CcuMm  e Dnto 1cu3m5,e 0n3t /10248/2  0 F22ile, d3 20731/0643/12,2 P  a Pgaeg2e1  2o1f  2o2f 22\nIII \nBecause the PBA was entitled to intervention as of right for the \nfour litigations that seek declaratory or injunctive relief, we need not \naddress the district court’s denial of permissive intervention. As to \nthose  two  litigations  that  seek  neither  declaratory  nor  injunctive \nrelief, we review the district court’s denial of permissive intervention \nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b)(1) for abuse of discretion. \nPermissive intervention is appropriate when a proposed intervenor \n“has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common \nquestion of law or fact.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B). The district court \ndid not abuse its discretion when it concluded that the PBA had not \nidentified such a claim or defense with respect to the damages-only \nactions. \nCONCLUSION \n  The district court abused its discretion in denying the PBA’s \nmotion to intervene as of right in the actions seeking declaratory or \ninjunctive  relief  with  respect  to  NYPD  policies.  The  PBA  has  a \ncognizable  interest  in  officer  safety  that may  be  impaired  by  the \ndisposition of those actions and that the parties may inadequately \nrepresent. Accordingly, we REVERSE the district court’s judgment \ndenying intervention under Rule 24(a) as to Payne v. De Blasio, No. 20-\nCV-8924; People of the State of New York v. City of New York, No. 21-CV-\n322; Sow v. City of New York, No. 21-CV-533; and Sierra v. City of New \nYork, No. 20-CV-10291. We AFFIRM the district court’s judgment \ndenying intervention under Rules 24(a) and (b) as to those litigations \nwithin the consolidated actions that seek only damages: Yates v. New \n \ncertain defendants for past conduct and that could not directly require a \nchange in NYPD policies. We affirm the district court’s judgment with \nrespect to those actions—namely, Yates and Wood. \n21 \n\nCasCea s1e:2 211-c-1v-301065, 3D3o-CcuMm  e Dnto 1cu3m5,e 0n3t /10248/2  0 F22ile, d3 20731/0643/12,2 P  a Pgaeg2e2  2o2f  2o2f 22\nYork City, No. 21-CV-1904, and Wood v.

(laq) (Entered: \n01/25/2021) \n01/25/2021     NOTICE OF CASE REASSIGNMENT to Judge Colleen McMahon. \nJudge Unassigned is no longer assigned to the case. (laq) (Entered: \n01/25/2021) \n\n01/25/2021     Magistrate Judge Gabriel W. Gorenstein is so designated. Pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. Section 636(c) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 73(b)(1) parties are \nnotified that they may consent to proceed before a United States \nMagistrate Judge. Parties who wish to consent may access the \nnecessary form at the following \nlink: https://nysd.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/2018-06/AO-3.pdf. \n(laq) (Entered: 01/25/2021) \n01/25/2021  ORDER: Please docket this notice from Chief Judge McMahon in \n28    cases: Payne v. DiBlasio, 20 Civ. 8924; Wood v. City of New York, \n20 Civ. 10541; People v. City of New York, 21 Civ. 322; Sow v. City \nof New York, 21 Civ. 533. Counsel: I now have four matters on my \ndocket relating to the conduct of the NYPD in connection with \nvarious demonstrations that occurred in New York City during 2020, \nthat are connected to the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement and \nthe deaths of George Floyd and other individuals at the hands of law \nenforcement officials in other jurisdictions. They are Payne v. \nDiBlasio, 20 Civ. 8924, Wood v. City of New York, 20 Civ. 10541, \nPeople v. City of New York, 21 Civ. 322, Sow v. City of New York, \n21 Civ. 533. I preliminarily consolidated these cases for pre-trial \npurposes. The defendants have moved to deconsolidate Payne and \nWood, and the plaintiffs in Payne object to consolidation of their \naction with the Attorney General's suit, though they do not object to \ncoordinated discovery and joint motion practice on the common \nissues of law and fact regarding policies and practices of the NYPD \nthat undergird all four of these lawsuits. I note that Wood, People and \nSow were all filed as \"related cases\" to Payne - and so they are, \nwhether they end up being tried together or not - so I anticipate that \nmost pre-trial matters, and certainly discovery, will be consolidated. I \nwant to conference all four cases initially, so I can get my head \naround how to manage these cases and start them moving. I want that \nconference to take place in person - \"in person\" meaning that no more \nthan two attorneys for each plaintiff and no more than four attorneys \nfor the defendants may be present in my courtroom, masked and \nsocially distanced, at an on-the-record conference. We cannot \npossibly accommodate all the members of the public who would want \nto be present at this conference, even with an overflow courtroom; we \nwill provide a call in number for maximum public access. At present, \nas you know, we are not holding in person proceedings in the federal \ncourthouses, so the February 5 date that is currently on your \ncalendars will not work. I would like to schedule this proceeding for \nthe week of February 16-17-18-19. As to the exact date, I would \nprefer to suit the convenience of counsel, so please confer and be in \ntouch with my deputy clerk, Mariela de Jesus, \nMariela_DeJesus@nysd.uscourts.gov with suggested dates and times \nduring that week. You should be prepared to discuss anticipated \n\nmotions, coordinated discovery and the reasons why these cases \nshould or should not be consolidated. If each plaintiff and the \ndefendants would file a letter of no more than three pages \nsummarizing your positions at last five days prior to the conference; \nyou can flesh them out fully at the conference. There really is no need \nto make a lot of formal procedural motions; I would rather hear you \noutline your positions and rule from the bench. Magistrate Judge \nGorenstein is the assigned MJ on these cases. I will be inviting him to \nparticipate at this conference as well.

After the May 25, 2020 police killing of George Floyd, protests against police \nviolence and in support of police accountability and the Black Lives Matter movement spread \nacross the United States and the world, including here in New York City, where thousands \nexercised their constitutional rights to protest across the City. \n2.  In an effort to instill fear and chill the speech of the protestors, the New York Police \nDepartment repeatedly corralled protestors into spaces where they could not escape. They beat \nprotestors  with  batons,  sprayed  them  with  pepper  spray,  and  arrested  them  without  lawful \njustification, all without fair warning. They then physically restrained them with flex-cuffs in such \na manner that many reported serious, long-term nerve damage. Protestors were subjected lengthy \nand unnecessary arrest processing that put them in dangerously close quarters, all in the height of \nthe global COVID-19 pandemic.  \n3.  In contrast, the same police department has responded to other protests (including, \nin particular, “Blue Lives Matter” and other pro-police protests) with virtually no arrests at all, let \nalone such brutality.  \n4.  Relatedly, as Defendants New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York City \nPolice Commissioner Dermot Shea, and other City policymakers well know, NYPD members \nreceive  insufficient  training  related  to  policing  and  use  of  force  in  connection  with  First \nAmendment assemblies. including because the core training, based on Disorder Control Unit \nprinciples, treats protest activities as forms of civil unrest, like riots, and focuses on disrupting and \ndemoralizing protests and protesters, rather than encouraging and facilitating them.  \n5.  The NYPD’s violent assault on protesters in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx \non June 4, 2020 exemplified the worst of the NYPD’s unconstitutional protest policing tactics and \ninsufficient training. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 5 of 85\n6.  Defendants  Shea,  along  with  Defendant  Terence  Monahan  and  other \ndecisionmakers, targeted the event based on its perceived message and perceived organizers; \nstrategically  trapping  protesters,  as  well  as  National  Lawyers  Guild  –  NYC  Chapter  Legal \nObservers, and volunteer medics, for purported violations of Defendant de Blasio’s Executive \nOrders imposing a City-wide curfew so that police would have a casus belli to initiate planned \nviolence. \n7.  NYPD members held protesters, as well as bystanders, observers, and medics, in \nplace performatively giving the trapped protesters “dispersal orders” that they could not comply \nwith,  \n8.  NYPD members then attacked protestors, climbing on cars, swinging batons, \nspraying pepper spray, and arresting anyone and everyone, without regard to probable cause, let \nalone individualized probable cause.   \n9.  And yet, Defendants de Blasio and Shea have routinely defended the NYPD’s \nresponse to the protests – for example, as discussed below, Shea has described the NYPD’s \nconduct in attacking the Mott Haven protest as “executed nearly flawlessly.”   \n10.  Put simply, if such deliberate violence is a flawless execution of New York City \npolicies and reflects the apex of the NYPD’s training, then the City must immediately change those \npolicies, and the related training. \n11.  The City can, and must, do much better. \n12.  Plaintiffs, on their own behalf and on behalf of others similarly situated, seek to \nhold  the  NYPD accountable for  its unconstitutional policies and practices of  violently and \ndisrupting and penalizing peaceful protests.  \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 6 of 85\nJURISDICTION   \n13.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ federal claims pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a)(3) and (4).  \n14.  The federal civil rights claims in this action are brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § \n1983 for violations of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the \nUnited States. \n15.

Defendant NYPD Chief of Department TERENCE MONAHAN was at all times \nrelevant  to  this  Complaint,  and  still  is,  the  Chief  of  Department  of  the  NYPD  who  has \npolicymaking authority over the Department. \n33.  Defendants NYPD Detective EDWARD CARRASCO (Shield No. 1567), NYPD \nOfficer TALHA AHMAD (Shield No. 21358), NYPD Officer KEVIN AGRO (Shield No. 8054) \nand NYPD Officers JOHN and JANE DOES # 1- 40, are NYPD Police Officers who unlawfully \nused excessive force, arrested, and/or detained Plaintiffs and others similarly situated in violation \nof their constitutional rights. \n34.

Plaintiffs demand a trial by jury in this action on each and every one of their claims \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 10 of 85\nfor which a jury trial is legally available. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS  \nBlack Lives Matter Protests from May 28, 2020 to June 6, 2020  \n43.  On May 28, 2020, days after George Floyd’s death, protests began across New \nYork City. One protest in Union Square saw a mobilization of hundreds of NYPD officers in \nresponse who made several arrests. A group of protestors marched to City Hall where officers \nkettled them with bicycles, and arrested approximately 75 people.  \n44.  Protests continued on May 29th at Foley Square and Barclays Center. At Barclay’s \nCenter, NYPD officers peppered sprayed and struck protesters with batons.  \n45.  On May 30th, protests continued in New York City in all five boroughs. The protests \nwere again met with NYPD shows of force including pepper spray, baton strikes, and mass arrests.  \nIn the Flatbush area of Brooklyn, a police helicopter flew low overhead swirling debris, trash, and \ndust into the marchers’ faces. \n46.  On May 31st, the protests in New York City continued, even garnering support from \nsome officers who knelt in a symbolic allegiance with the cause of the protestors.  While some \nindividuals  participated  in  property  crimes,  the  defendants  failed  to  distinguish  among  the \nprotestors and other individuals.   \nDefendant de Blasio’s Curfew Orders and the NYPD’s Subsequent Arrests  \n \n47.  On June 1, 2020, in the midst of the protests in New York City, Governor Andrew \nCuomo and Defendant de Blasio announced that New York City would be subject to an 11:00 p.m. \nto 5:00 a.m. curfew.1 \n \n1 See https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-and-mayor-de-blasio-announce-citywide-curfew-new-\nyork-city-will-take-effect; Emergency Executive Order No. 117, available at \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2020/eeo-117.pdf. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 11 of 85\n48.  On the evening of June 1, 2020, Defendant de Blasio announced he would be \nextending the curfew to the evening of June 2, 2020. 2 \n49.  On June 2, 2020, Defendant de Blasio issued Emergency Executive Order No. 119, \nordering “a City-wide curfew to be in effect each day from 8:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m., beginning at \n8:00 p.m. on June 3, 2020 and ending at 5:00 a.m. on June 8, 2020” during which “no persons or \nvehicles” could “be in public.”3  \n50.  Under the Curfew Orders4: “Failure to comply with this Order shall result in orders \nto disperse, and any person who knowingly violates the provisions in this Order shall be guilty of \na Class B misdemeanor.”  \n51.  The Curfew Orders specifically exempted certain categories of workers that were \ndeemed “essential” workers, including “police officers, peace officers, firefighters, first responders \nand  emergency  medical  technicians,  individuals  travelling  to  and  from  essential  work  and \nperforming essential work, people experiencing homelessness and without access to a viable \nshelter, and individuals seeking medical treatment or medical supplies.”  \n52.  Pursuant to the Curfew Orders, “any person who knowingly violate[d] the provisions \nin th[e] Order[s] [was] guilty of a Class B misdemeanor” under NYC Administrative Code § 3-108. \n53.  NYC Administrative Code § 3-108 contains a knowing intent requirement: “Any \nknowing violation of a provision of any emergency measure established pursuant to this chapter \nshall be a class B misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars, or by \nimprisonment for not more than three months, or both.” \n \n2 See, e.g., https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1267642422194057217?s=20; Emergency Executive Order No. \n118, available at https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2020/eeo-118.pdf.  \n3 See Emergency Executive Order No. 119, available at \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2020/eeo-119.pdf.  \n4 Hereinafter, we refer to Defendant de Blasio’s Emergency Executive Orders related to the curfew collectively as the \n“Curfew Orders.” \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 12 of 85\n54.  Under New York Penal Law § 15.05, “A person acts knowingly with respect to \nconduct or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware that his \nconduct is of such nature or that such circumstance exists.” \n55.  On June 1st, the NYPD Operations Division issued a FINEST message regarding \nthe curfew orders, instructing officers that “[e]nforcement will only be taken after several warnings \nare issued and the violator is refusing to comply.” (emphasis added).  \n56.  On June 3rd, another FINEST message omitted the instruction to issue a dispersal \norder prior to curfew enforcement stating that, for a “person violating the curfew, a C-summons \nmay be issued . . . for violating the Mayoral emergency order.”  \n57.  As seen below, many Plaintiffs other arrestees were arrested in connection with \npurported violations of the Curfew Orders, under circumstances in which the NYPD members \nordering or making the arrests had not given clearly communicated dispersal orders and/or \nprovided meaningful opportunities to disperse.  \n58.  On June 7, 2020, Defendant de Blasio lifted the Curfew Orders - one day earlier \nthan the last of the orders was to remain in effect. \n59.  While the Curfew Orders were in effect, the NYPD arrested approximately 1,350 \nindividuals, disproportionately Black and minority individuals, for allegedly violating the Curfew \nOrders. \n60.  The overwhelming majority, if not all, of the purported charged violations of the \nCurfew Orders related to the protests that are the subject of this litigation were eventually \ndismissed. \n \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 13 of 85\nProtests Continue on June 1, June 2, and June 3, 2020  \n61.  On June 1st, demonstrations continued. Officers continued to fail to distinguish the \nprotesters from individuals taking advantage of the demonstrations to destroy property and steal \nfrom businesses.  \n62.  On June 2nd, police effectuated mass arrests of protesters demonstrating across the \nCity, in some cases shortly after curfew, using excessive force, including in the form of punching, \nkicking, tackling, and striking them with batons.  \n63.  For example, around 2,000 protesters were trapped by the NYPD on the Manhattan \nBridge for over an hour and a half after officers closed both sides of the bridge and refused to let \nprotesters either proceed into Manhattan or return to Brooklyn.   \n64.  On June 3rd, protest participation increased, with demonstrations widely dispersed \nacross the City, including at Cadman Plaza in Brooklyn and in front of Gracie Mansion in \nManhattan. Officers in both locations kettled protesters and shoved and struck protesters with \nbatons. Officers at Cadman Plaza deployed tear gas. \n65.  A federal lawsuit filed on behalf of four attendees of the Cadman Plaza and \nBarclays Center protests describes this NYPD conduct including, inter alia, “kettling,” abusive \nlanguage, and excessive force including of the use of batons, bicycles, chemical irritants, and \ntightly fastened flex-cuffs and handcuffs. See Gelbard et al. v. City of New York et al., 20-cv-3163 \n(E.D.N.Y.).  \nThe NYPD’s Unconstitutional Policy of First Amendment Retaliatory Arrests  \nReaches its Apex in Mott Haven on June 4, 2020    \n \n66.  On June 4th, protests continued across the City, and, in a marked escalation, police \nmade more arrests than the day before.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 14 of 85\n67.  NYPD members arrested protesters after the 8:00 p.m. curfew in Brooklyn and \nManhattan, utilizing kettling and wanton force against protesters in Midtown Manhattan and Fort \nGreene and Williamsburg in Brooklyn.  \n68.  In an attack on a FTP4 action against, among other things, police misconduct in the \nBronx, police in the Mott Haven neighborhood blocked all exits of a protest group on 136th Street \nbefore 8:00 p.m., prevented protesters from leaving, and then effectuated mass arrests with heavy \nuse of force for purported violations of the Curfew Orders when the time passed 8:00 p.m., \nincluding striking protesters with batons, deploying pepper spray, and arresting National Lawyers \nGuild – New York City Chapter Legal Observers, and medical volunteers along with them.  \n69.  At some time before 8:00 p.m., NYPD Strategic Response Group officers wearing \ndark padding or body armor and bicycle helmets formed a line with their bodies and NYPD \nbicycles at 135th Street and Willis Avenue, causing protesters proceeding south on Willis Avenue \nto turn east onto 136th Street. \n70.  At or around the same time, NYPD officers John and Jane Does 1-20 formed a \npolice blockade ahead of, and downhill from, the protesters on 136th Street and Brook Avenue (the \n“Brook Avenue Line.” As protesters arrived on the 136th Street block between Brown Place (on \nthe west) and Brook Avenue (on the east, downhill), they encountered the Brook Avenue Line. \n71.  At or around the same time as protesters encountered the Brook Avenue Line, \nNYPD Officers John and Jane Does 21-40 (the “Brown Place Does”) formed a second police \nblockade on 136th Street and Brown Place (the “Brown Place Line”). \n72.  Also, at or around the same time, a third group of NYPD Officers John and Jane \nDoes 41-60 (the “Sidewalk Line Does”) formed a third police blockade between the 136th Street \nroadway  and  the  sidewalks  to  the  north  and south  of  136th  Street  (the  “Sidewalk  Lines”), \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 15 of 85\neffectively preventing people trapped on the roadway between the Brook Avenue Line and the \nBrown Place Line from going onto the sidewalk, and people trapped on the sidewalk from entering \nthe roadway.  \n73.  The Brook Avenue Line Does, Brown Place Does, and Sidewalk Line Does formed \na police trap or “kettle” from which protesters, including Plaintiffs Bredder, Pluchino, and Sow \ncould not leave – the “Mott Haven Kettle.” \n74.  NYPD officers failed to issue sufficient dispersal orders allowing for compliance \nin advance of enforcement On June 4th, protests continued to grow in size across the city.  \n75.  Other attendees of the June 4, 2020 march in Mott Haven have filed a complaint in \nthis United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. See Sierra et al. v. City \nof New York et al., 20-cv-10291 (S.D.N.Y.). \n76.  In  Sierra,  Plaintiffs  describe  similar  NYPD  conduct  including,  inter  alia, \nencirclement or “kettling,” abusive language, and excessive force including of the use of batons, \nbicycles, chemical irritants, and tightly-fastened flex-cuffs and handcuffs. \n77.  Protests continued across the City on June 5th and 6th. \nNYPD’s Permissive Response to Pro-Police and Other, Similar Demonstrations  \n78.  The NYPD’s violent response to protests against police brutality was dramatically \ndifferent from their response to other kinds of protests and rallies in the summer and fall of 2020.  \n79.   For example, on July 11, 2020, pro-police demonstrators held a “Rally to Back the \nBlue”  in  Dyker  Heights,  Brooklyn.  Pro-police  marchers  yelled  at  and  antagonized  counter \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 16 of 85\nprotestors against police brutality, making racist and sexist statements, grabbing them, and spitting \nin counter protestors’ faces. The NYPD made no arrests at the rally.5   \n80.  On July 13, 2020, pro-police “Blue Lives Matter” groups held a march in Bay \nRidge, Brooklyn. The march was attended by counter protestors organized against police brutality. \nThough members of the pro-police group shouted racist and homophobic slurs at the counter \nprotesters and assaulted them in view of NYPD officers, only two people were arrested – both \nBlack men protesting police brutality. By contrast, a Blue Lives Matter demonstrator who punched \na woman in the face in view of NYPD officers was not arrested.6  \n81.  In October 2020, hundreds of members of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in \nBrooklyn gathered in Borough Park to protest coronavirus restrictions imposed by Governor \nCuomo. The protestors set fires in the street and threw masks into the flames. They chased away \nNYC Sheriff’s Deputies and attacked a photojournalist reporting on the protest. An ultra-Orthodox \nJewish man who opposed the protestors was attacked by protestors and beaten with rocks. Police \nsaid that no arrests or summons were issued to the protestors on the night of the rally.7  \nReports and Investigations into the 2020 Protests  \n82.  In July 2020, the New York State Office of the Attorney General (the “AG”) issued \na preliminary report on the NYPD’s response to the May and June protests (“AG Report”).8 \n \n5 Sydney Pereira, Videos Show Pro-Police demonstrators in Brooklyn Unleashing Racist, Sexist Vitriol Against \nCounter-Protestors, Gothamist, July 12, 2020, available at https://gothamist.com/news/police-rally-back-the-blue-\nbrooklyn-dyker-heights.  \n6 Jake Offenhartz and Gwynne Hogan, “They Defend Their Own Side”: NYPD Accused of Protecting Blue Lives \nMatter Marchers in Bay Ridge, Gothamist, July 13, 2020, available at https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-accused-\nprotecting-violent-blue-lives-matter-marchers-bay-ridge.  \n7 Jake Offenhartz, Orthodox Borough Park Residents Burn Masks, Beat Dissenters Over COVID Lockdown, \nGothamist, Oct. 7, 2020, available at https://gothamist.com/news/orthodox-borough-park-residents-burn-masks-\nbeat-dissenters-over-covid-lockdown.  \n8 New York State Office of the Attorney General, Preliminary Report on the New York City Police Department’s \nResponse to the Demonstrations Following the Death of George Floyd, (“AG Report”), July 2020, available at \nhttps://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2020-nypd-report.pdf.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 17 of 85\n83.  The AG Report found that most complaints received by the AG were allegations of \nexcessive force, “kettling,” arrest and excessive force against press, National Lawyers Guild – \nNew York City Chapter Legal Observers, elected officials, and essential workers. \n84.  The AG Report also found the pervasive use and misuse of tightly fastened flex-\ncuffs during arrests, NYPD officers covering their badge numbers, and failure of NYPD officers \nto wear protective face coverings to protect themselves and others against the spread of COVID-\n19.  \n85.  In December of 2020, the NYC Department of Investigation also issued a report \nexamining the NYPD’s conduct in response to the protests (“DOI Report”).9 \n86.  The DOI Report found, inter alia, that the NYPD lacked a sufficiently tailored \nstrategy to respond to protests, used force and tactics of crowd control that led to excessive force \nand  “heightened  tensions,”  made  decisions  based  on  intelligence  that  lacked  “context  or \nproportionality,” and deployed officers who lacked sufficient training in responding to protests. 10 \n87.  In addition to the heavy-handed response by the SRG at the 2020 protests, the DOI \nReport found that officers not from SRG lacked “any recent training related to protests.”11 \n88.  The DOI found that NYPD policies do not have specific First Amendment protest \nexpression policing policies and failed to distinguish policies for serious civil disorders and riots \nfrom those applicable to First Amendment expression. \n89.  The DOI distinguished between protest facilitation and protest control, regulation, \nor suppression.  \n \n9 Margaret Garnett, Commissioner, New York City Department of Investigation, Investigation into NYPD Response \nto the George Floyd Protests, (“DOI Report”), Dec. 2020, available at \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doi/reports/pdf/2020/DOIRpt.NYPD%20Reponse.%20GeorgeFloyd%20Protests.12.18\n.2020.pdf.  \n10   Id.  at 36. \n11 Id. at 61. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 18 of 85\n90.  The former is preferred to allow for First Amendment expression, the DOI Report \nfound, but the NYPD employed the latter during the 2020 protests. \n91.  According to the DOI Report, between May 28 and June 5, 2020, approximately \n2,047 individuals were arrested during demonstrations.12 \n92.  The  DOI  found  that  Black  arrestees  were  disproportionately  charged  with \nfelonies.13 \n93.  According to the DOI Report, between May 28 and June 20, 2020, the CCRB had \nreceived 1,646 protest-related allegations related to 248 incidents.14 \n94.  In September of 2020, Human Rights Watch issued a detailed analysis of the Mott \nHaven protest (“HRW Report”) describing the preplanned and coordinated disruption of the march \nby the NYPD, including by Chief Monahan who was present at the NYPD mobilization.15 \n95.  The HRW Report describes the systematic “kettling” of protesters in Mott Haven \nbefore the 8:00 p.m. curfew and the subsequent excessive force and mass arrest of the marchers, \nincluding National Lawyers Guild – New York City Chapter Legal Observers, as well as medics, \nall of whom were classified as essential workers exempt from the Mayor’s Curfew Orders. \n96.  Following the Mott Haven protest, Defendant Shea said the mobilization by the \nNYPD in Mott Haven was “executed nearly flawlessly.”16 \n \n12  Id.  at 26. \n13  Id.  at 27. \n14  Id.  at 28. \n15 Human Rights Watch, “Kettling” Protesters In The Bronx: Systemic Police Brutality And Its Costs In The United \nStates (“HRW Report”), Sept. 2020, available at https://www.hrw.org/report/2020/09/30/kettling-protesters-\nbronx/systemic-police-brutality-and-its-costs-united-states.  \n16 Jake Offenhartz, Nick Pinto, and Gwynne Hogan, “NYPD’s Ambush of Peaceful Bronx Protesters Was “Executed \nNearly Flawlessly,” City Leaders Agree, Gothamist, June 5, 2020, available at https://gothamist.com/news/nypds-\nambush-of-peaceful-bronx-protesters-was-executed-nearly-flawlessly-city-leaders-agree. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 19 of 85\n97.  The NYPD sought to justify their Mott Haven mobilization, citing purported \nintelligence about criminality17 which was identified as unrelated to the march and significantly \ndistanced from the march.18  \n98.  The NYPD’s claims were almost immediately debunked – including, for example, \nin a June 8, 2020 New York Post article by Craig McCarthy entitled “NYPD Commissioner ignores \nhis own ‘misinformation’ warnings.”19 \n99.  Relatedly, the DOI found that “the force required to carry out a mass arrest was \ndisproportionate to the identified threat, placed the burden of potential crime on a wide swath of \npeople who had no apparent connection to that potential criminal activity.”20  \n100.  The DOI Report, AG Report, and HRW Report, in addition to the lawsuits filed \nfollowing the 2020 protests, document the NYPD’s persisting policy and practice of violently \nsuppressing First Amendment expression using excessive force and mass arrests. \n101.  NYPD leadership and policymakers knew the department and its officers had \nproblems with constitutionally policing protests, but failed to adequately prepare its officers to \nrespond to the 2020 protests, prevent its officers from committing the same acts of misconduct, or \ndiscipline officers who engaged in such misconduct. \n102.

City of New York et al., 21-cv-0322, (S.D.N.Y.), among others. \nThe COVID-19 Pandemic in New York City  \n103.  As protesters were taking to the streets in the summer of 2020 to speak out against \npolice brutality and in support of Black lives, the COVID-19 virus raged across the country.  \n104.  In April 2020, Governor Cuomo ordered civilians to wear protective face masks in \npublic, to protect themselves and others from the spread of the virus. But many NYPD officers \nrefused to do so.  \n105.  As the AG Report documented, many officers who interacted with and arrested \nprotesters in May and June of 2020 were not wearing face masks, even as the City continued to \nrecord hundreds of new coronavirus cases each week—and, by contrast, most protesters wore \nprotective face masks—at least until their contacts with NYPD members. \n106.  During their arrests, some protesters’ masks fell off or were removed. These \nprotesters were transported in vans and/or buses and placed in holding cells in close indoor contact \nwith other arrestees whose mask fell off or were removed, and police officers who were not \nwearing masks.  \nNamed Plaintiffs’ Experiences  \nPlaintiff David Jaklevic’s May 30th Arrest  \n107.  Plaintiff David Jaklevic is a 41-year-old attorney who has worked for the US \nDepartment of Labor for approximately ten years.  \n108.  Mr. Jaklevic participated in a protest at and around Union Square on the night of \nMay 30, 2020.  \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 21 of 85\n109.  Mr. Jaklevic wore a protective face covering to protect himself and others from the \nspread of COVID-19. \n110.  When Mr. Jaklevic attempted to leave the protest to return home at approximately \n10:15 p.m., NYPD members funneled protesters westward on 13th Street. \n111.  With no other way to move, Mr. Jaklevic moved as directed west on 13th Street.  \n112.  Officers on bicycles then formed a wall across 13th Street in front of protestors, \ntrapping Mr. Jaklevic and the other protesters on the block between Broadway and University \nPlace.  \n113.  Without  any  announcements  and  without  making  any  orders,  the  officers  on \nbicycles charged forward into the protesters. \n114.  At least two officers on bicycles, including Defendant NYPD Officer Kevin Agro \n(NYPD shield #8054), struck Mr. Jaklevic with their bicycles as they drove into the protesters. \n115.   An officer then grabbed Mr. Jaklevic from behind, threw him into the air, and \nslammed him to the ground. \n116.  The officer then pulled Mr. Jaklevic’s left wrist, arm, and shoulder forcefully back \nand up his back at an unnatural angle, causing pain. \n117.   An officer then cuffed Mr. Jaklevic with flex-cuffs, pulling Mr. Jaklevic’s flex-\ncuffs as hard as he could and as tight as they would go. \n118.  The officer then yanked Mr. Jaklevic off the ground by the flex-cuffs, causing \nexcruciating pain in Mr. Jaklevic’s left shoulder and wrists. \n119.  Mr. Jaklevic immediately informed the officer that the flex-cuffs were too tight. \n120.  Mr. Jaklevic repeatedly pleaded for his flex-cuffs to be loosened or removed. \n121.   An officer replied, in sum and substance, “Shut the fuck up and sit down.” \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 22 of 85\n122.  Mr. Jaklevic sat down on the curb, which increased the pain to his shoulder and \nwrists. \n123.  Mr. Jaklevic was required to remain on a curb in extremely tight flex-cuffs with an \ninjured shoulder for nearly an hour. \n124.  Mr. Jaklevic repeatedly told the officers around him that he had lost feeling in his \nhands. \n125.  Mr. Jaklevic’s protective face mask fell around his neck when officers tackled him \nto the ground. \n126.  Officers refused to place Mr. Jaklevic’s mask back onto his face. \n127.   Officers with whom Mr. Jaklevic interacted with overwhelmingly did not wear \nmasks.   \n128.  After around 1 hour, an officer approached Mr. Jaklevic and other protesters, and \ntold them that they should not have been arrested and that the officers were under a lot of stress.     \n129.  An officer then finally removed Mr. Jaklevic’s flex-cuffs and released him from \ncustody with no charges.  \n130.  Mr. Jaklevic asked the officer who had told him to shut up and forced him to sit for \nhis badge number.  \n131.  The officer refused to give his badge number and told Mr. Jaklevic to leave \nimmediately or he would re-arrest him.  \n132.  Mr. Jaklevic sustained bruises and scrapes to his right shoulder and elbow, bruising \nand swelling to his left hand, and numbness, tingling, and nerve damage to his left wrist that has \nrequired repeated medical treatment including physical therapy, among other injuries. \nPlaintiff Alexandra de Mucha Pino’s May 30th Arrest  \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 23 of 85\n133.  Plaintiff Alexandra de Mucha Pino is a 29-year-old senior program associate at \nEarthjustice with a B.S. in Environmental Resource Management. \n134.  On the evening May 30th, 2020, Ms. de Mucha Pino participated in a march from \nCity Hall across the Brooklyn Bridge.  \n135.  Ms. de Mucha Pino wore a protective face covering to protect herself and others \nfrom the spread of COVID-19. \n136.  As the marchers made their way over the Brooklyn Bridge, officers waiting near \nthe Brooklyn end of the bridge formed a wall across the street. \n137.  As the marchers exited the bridge, officers charged at them, including Ms. de \nMucha Pino. \n138.  Officers did not give any orders before charging at the protesters.  \n139.  Ms. de Mucha Pino turned around and retreated from the charging officers.  \n140.  Ms. de Mucha Pino looked over her shoulder and saw officers tackle, body slam, \nand strike protesters with batons. \n141.  Ms. de Mucha Pino stood on the sidewalk and began recording the police activity. \n142.  Two officers rushed at Ms. de Mucha Pino. \n143.   One officer pushed Ms. de Mucha Pino with his baton and told her to move back, \nbut she could not physically move backwards further because of a row of bushes behind her.  \n144.  The second officer also began pushing Ms. de Mucha Pino. \n145.  Ms. de Mucha Pino put her arms in the air. \n146.  The two officers ripped a metal cuff bracelet off of Ms. de Mucha Pino’s wrist, \ncausing a gash to her left arm that left a permanent scar. \n147.  The two officers threw her bracelet to the ground, and she never got it back. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 24 of 85\n148.  The two officers twisted Plaintiff de Mucha Pino’s arms and hands such that one \npalm was facing inwards and one palm was facing outwards, and then placed flex-cuffs extremely \ntightly on her in this incorrect position, which caused the flex-cuffs to further cut into her skin.   \n149.  Officers then forced Ms. de Mucha Pino to wait for approximately thirty minutes \nin the street. \n150.  While she waited, Ms. de Mucha Pino told officers that her flex-cuffs were too tight \nand were hurting her. \n151.  Eventually Ms. de Mucha Pino was loaded into a prisoner transport vehicle, with \napproximately ten other protesters, many of whom had their personal protective equipment \nremoved by officers. \n152.  Ms. de Mucha Pino was held in this extremely hot transport vehicle with the other \nprotesters for over three hours with her hands cuffed behind her, and with no air-conditioning. \n153.  When she was finally allowed to exit the vehicle, Ms. de Mucha Pino was forced \nto wait outside of One Police Plaza in a line for approximately an hour, where Ms. de Mucha \nPino’s cuffs were finally removed. \n154.  Ms. de Mucha Pino then spent approximately four and a half hours in a cell with 2 \nto 3 other people, which was so small that there was not enough room on the bench in the cell for \nall four individuals. \n155.  Ms. de Mucha Pino’s cellmates asked for water, and officers told them that they \ncould not give them water because they did not have cups.  \n156.  When arrestees asked about food, officers laughed and said in sum and substance \n“No, you aren’t getting any meals.” \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 25 of 85\n157.  After about 8 and a half hours in custody, Ms. de Mucha Pino was given two \nsummonses for Disorderly Conduct and released from custody. \n158.  Ms. de Mucha Pino’s charges were eventually dismissed.  \n159.  Ms. de Mucha Pino suffered physical and emotional injuries, including, but not \nlimited to, loss of circulation in her wrist and bruising and a cut to her left arm, as well as \nnightmares and a fear of the police.  \n160.  Ms. de Mucha Pino missed work as a result of this incident. \nPlaintiff Oscar Rios’s June 1st Arrest   \n161.  Plaintiff Oscar Rios is a 29-year-old software developer. \n162.  On June 1, 2020, Mr. Rios attended a protest that began at Barclay’s Center, crossed \nthe Manhattan Bridge, and approached Port Authority.  \n163.  Mr. Rios wore a protective face covering to protect himself and others from the \nspread of COVID-19. \n164.  As the protesters approached Port Authority, the NYPD blocked off the forward \npath with police cars, began intersecting blocks, and pushing in from behind the crowd as well, \nforcing the crowd to steer in a different direction.  \n165.  When the protest march arrived at Port Authority, Mr. Rios saw hundreds of police \nofficers lined up.  \n166.  NYPD Members did not announce that a curfew was going into effect. \n167.  Without giving any announcements or any orders to disperse, officers rushed the \nprotesters. \n168.   An officer tackled Mr. Rios, forced him prostrate on the ground, struck him \nmultiple times with a baton, and then punched him repeatedly.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 26 of 85\n169.  One or more officers sat or kneeled on top of Mr. Rios and handcuffed him with \nflex-cuffs with excessive tightness on the ground, impeding Mr. Rios’s breathing.  \n170.  Officers continued to strike Mr. Rios while he was on the ground, causing cuts to \nhis hands and knees, punching him in the stomach, and striking his back with a baton. \n171.  As Mr. Rios’s face was being pressed to the ground while he was wearing a \nprotective face mask, Mr. Rios was having difficulty breathing and an officer that he was \nstruggling to breathe.  \n172.  The officer responded, in sum and substance, “Shut the fuck up,” and he then \nstepped intentionally on Mr. Rios’s face, breaking his glasses.  \n173.  Mr. Rios begged officers to let him recover his glasses after officers made him stand \nup.  \n174.  When officers finally gave Mr. Rios his glasses, they were completely broken, with \nboth arms and lenses snapped off and warped.  \n175.  An officer asked Mr. Rios, in sum and substance, why he was attending the protest. \n176.  When Mr. Rios responded that he was there to protest police brutality and his arrest \nwas part of that brutality, the officer told him, in sum and substance, “Shut the fuck up.”  \n177.  Another officer threatened Mr. Rios was a baton and also told him, in sum and \nsubstance, “Shut the fuck up.” \n178.  Mr.  Rios  complained  about  the  excessive  tightness  of  his  handcuffs  and  the \nnumbness of his hands to officers.  \n179.  Officers informed Mr. Rios that they could not do anything about the tightness of \nhis flex-cuffs.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 27 of 85\n180.  Officers loaded Mr. Rios into a prisoner transport vehicle with several other \nprotesters.  \n181.  While in the vehicle, Mr. Rios asked officers for a mask and was denied one. \n182.  Another protester in the transport van commented that Mr. Rios’s hands had turned \npurple, and only then did an officer finally remove the flex-cuffs and replace them with a metal \npair. \n183.  Officers confiscated Mr. Rios’s fannypack and phone. \n184.  When the transport van arrived at One Police Plaza, Mr. Rios waited outside in line \nfor hours.  \n185.

Between approximately 7:40 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., Ms. Durkee was caught in the \nMott Haven Kettle on 136th Street between Brown Place and Brook Avenue when the Brook \nAvenue Line formed a barricade with their bicycles to prevent passage to Brook Avenue and began \npushing the crowd back with their bicycles, at the same time that the Brown Place Line began \npushing the crowd forward from the rear and the Sidewalk Lines formed to either side. \n377.  Ms. Durkee was near the back of the march when the Brown Place Line rushed the \nmarch from behind.  \n378.  Ms. Durkee witnessed officers beating protesters with batons, arresting protesters, \nremoving glasses from protesters and throwing the glasses to the ground, and opening protester’s \nbackpacks and dumping the contents in the street.  \n379.  NYPD members never gave Ms. Durkee an order to disperse.  \n380.  Ms. Durkee was so tightly crushed by the police and the protesters attempting to \nescape them that she could not even move her hands and she became concerned for some of the \nsmaller young women in the crowd, at least one of whom was a teenager.  \n381.  A helicopter that had been hovering over the protest moved in quickly and so close \nthat Ms. Durkee was buffeted by the wind from it and alarmed by its loudness and proximity.  \n382.  An officer grabbed Ms. Durkee from behind and threw her to the ground and on \ntop of other women who had been pushed to the street by officers as he said in sum and substance, \n“Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up.”  \n383.  The officer grabbed Ms. Durkee’s hair and pulled her head back and ripped her \nmask down.   \n384.  The officer then put his knee or baton into her back and forced her down on top of \nthe other women.  \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 44 of 85\n385.  At no point did Ms. Durkee resist arrest. \n386.  The officer applied cuffs to Ms. Durkee by yanking her up roughly and cuffing her \narms behind her back.  \n387.  The officer handed Ms. Durkee off to another officer, who would act as Ms. \nDurkee’s arresting officer.  \n388.  Both officers had tape over their badges, preventing Ms. Durkee from learning their \nnames or badge numbers.  \n389.  NYPD Officers making up the kettle deployed pepper spray amid the protesters, \ncausing coughing in Ms. Durkee due to the removal of her mask, and exposing her to coughing of \nother protesters whose masks had been removed by the NYPD.  \n390.  An officer forced Ms. Durkee to stand with a number of other protesters while they \nawaited transportation.  \n391.  When all officers ignored the arrested protester’s requests to have their masks \npulled up, the protesters began leaning on one another to help pull each other’s masks up with their \nhands cuffed behind their backs.  \n392.  Officers loaded Ms. Durkee into a prisoner transport vehicle with 2 other protesters. \n393.  Ms. Durkee was held in an NYPD SUV with 2 other protesters for 45 minutes with \nthe windows up and her hands cuffed behind her back.  \n394.  The SUV traveled first to one local precinct, then another.  \n395.  After two hours in the second precinct, Ms. Durkee was moved to a centralized \narrest processing location in Queens and placed in a holding cell with 25 people, many of whom \nwere unmasked.  \n396.  Ms. Durkee assisted others in pulling up their masks.   \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 45 of 85\n397.  At approximately 2:00 in the morning on June 5, 2020, Ms. Durkee was issued a \nsummons for a curfew violation, that was later dismissed.  \n398.  Ms. Durkee suffered physical and emotional injuries, including but not limited to \npersistent neck pain, a fear of the police, difficulty sleeping, feelings of trauma, and feelings of \nnervousness when someone approaches her from behind.  \n399.  Ms. Durkee experienced a chilling effect from her arrest and detention. Her fear \nthat she was nearly crushed in the kettle has caused her to worry that she should not go to future \nprotests in case she is killed, and her minor daughter is left without a mother.  \n400.  Ms. Durkee missed two days of work due to her arrest and detention and subsequent \nrecovery, which set her behind on production schedules.    \nThe NYPD’s Historical Policy and Practice  \nof Violently Disrupting Protected First Amendment Activity  \n \n401.  The extensive deprivation of constitutional rights during the 2020 protests is \ndirectly attributable to the City’s disregard of many years of notice, criticism, and other relevant \ndata points, both internal and external, related to its unconstitutional policing of similar protests \nover the past twenty years, at protests including those against the World Economic Forum (the \n“WEF”) in 2002, the Iraq War in 2003, the Republican National Convention (“RNC”) in 2004, the \nOccupy Wall Street (“OWS”) protests in 2011 and 2012, and many other protests since, including \nBlack Lives Matter and anti-police brutality protests.   \n402.  The NYPD response to the protests in New York City in May and June 2020 was \nin line with its history of violent and unconstitutional responses to those as other past protests in \nNew York City, including its treatment of First Amendment assemblies with demoralizing and \nbrutal  shows  of  force,  rather  than  genuine  efforts  to  facilitate  protesters’  protected  First \nAmendment activity. \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 46 of 85\n403.  For example, the NYPD met protests following the start of the Iraq War in 2003 \nwith mass arrests, excessive force, use of pepper spray and batons strikes to disperse, and “kettling” \nto move protestors from specific locations to effectuate mass arrests.21 \n404.  The next year, during the police “Operation Overlord II” operation in response to \nthe Republican National Convention in 2004, NYPD members treated protestors to similar uses of \nexcessive force and mass arrests.22 \n405.  The NYPD continued to employ similar mass arrest and excessive force tactics \nduring a years-long crackdown on Critical Mass bicycle rides beginning in 2004.23  \n406.  Similarly, during the Occupy Wall Street (“OWS”) protests in 2011, the NYPD \nused excessive force against protestors, bystanders, and National Laywers Guild – New York City \nChapter Legal Observers, as well as “kettling” tactics to move protestors or initiate mass arrests.24  \n407.  Additionally, Defendants have employed the same tactics and practices against \nBlack Lives Matter, police accountability, and other, similar protests, over the intervening years. \n408.  Following NYPD conduct during these and other protests, the City of New York \nand the NYPD and its members have been sued repeatedly by protestors who alleged that they had \nbeen unlawfully detained, kettled, arrested, subjected to mass arrests and violations of their First \nAmendment and other, related rights, much in the same manner as have the Plaintiffs in this case. \n409.  Indeed, in Plaintiffs’ cases, Defendants employed tactics developed and modified \nover the course of many years by Defendants Shea, Monahan, and their predecessors and by other \ndefendant City policymakers at and in connection with other demonstrations in the City dating \n \n21 See, e.g., N.Y.

Since at least the 1990’s, the NYPD has failed to appropriately train its officers on \nthe proper handling of First Amendment assemblies. \n411.  In fact, the NYPD’s core training related to protest response to this day is based on \ncrowd management and disorder control tactics for policing large-scale civil disorder and riots. \n \narrested for disorderly conduct, unreasonable noise, resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration.” \nhttps://www.nyclu.org/en/nyc-free-speech-threat-assessment.  \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 53 of 85\n412.   In 1997, the NYPD’s Disorder Control Unit  (“DCU”) created the “Disorder \nControl Guidelines.” \n413.  Upon information and belief, to this day, that document forms the core of today’s \nNYPD protest response-related training. \n414.  The Disorder Control Guidelines treat disorders as military engagements and copies \nmilitary tactics and focus on tactics designed to deter, disperse, and demoralize groups, such as \ndisorder control formations and making mass arrests. \n415.  As seen elsewhere herein, such disperse and demoralize tactics have persisted \nthrough the present as exemplified by the experiences of the Named Plaintiffs and Class Members.  \n416.  Upon information and belief, Disorder Control Guidelines were never meant to be \nguidelines for the policing of lawful First Amendment assemblies such as demonstrations – only \nfor large-scale civil disorder such as riots. \n417.  However, neither the Disorder Control Guidelines, nor, upon information and \nbelief, any related NYPD training, contain meaningful direction on the core First, Fourth, or \nFourteenth Amendment principles that must guide constitutional policing of First Amendment \nassemblies. \n418.  For example, upon information and belief, there is virtually no NYPD training—\nand certainly no meaningful NYPD training—focusing on how to utilize the tactics described in \nthe Disorder Control Guidelines without infringing on the constitutional rights of protesters, such \nas how to make probable cause determinations or the requirements of providing an alternative \navenue of protest, meaningful time and a path of egress when issuing a dispersal order, and the \nlike.    \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 54 of 85\n419.  Although the above, and related, problems with the NYPD’s training are endemic \nand cut across all of the relevant NYPD training, at present, Defendant City has a policy and \npractice of deploying one particularly problematic, inadequately trained, poorly supervised and \ndisciplined group of NYPD members: the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group (“SRG”).  \n420.  The SRG, deployed around the City at protests in 2020 including those that are the \nsubject of this lawsuit, was created in 2015 as a specialized unit tasked with responding to disorder-\ncausing events and to conduct counter-terrorism operations. \n421.  The SRG has a unit in each of the five boroughs and the Disorder Control Unit has \nnow been incorporated into the SRG. \n422.  In response to the public’s skepticism that the SRG would be used to crack down \non protests, then-Chief of Department James O’Neill stated: “They will not be involved in handling \nprotests and demonstrations. They’ll have no role in protests. Their response is single-fold. They’ll \nbe doing counter-terror work. They’ll be assigned to different posts throughout the city.”27 \n423.  However, since 2015, the SRG has been regularly deployed at protests, including \nthose in 2020 related to the present lawsuit. \n424.  Many SRG members, including many of those deployed to the protests in 2020 that \nare the subject of this lawsuit, have histories of engaging in the kinds of misconduct complained \nof herein, among other places, by CCRB complaints, and in numerous lawsuits.28  \n425.  SRG members are meant to have additional DCU training. \n426.  Upon information and belief, that additional DCU training is principally modelled \non the core principles and tactics in the Disorder Control Guidelines.  \n \n27 Ben Yakas, NYPD: Fine, Maybe We Won’t Police Protests With Machine Guns, Gothamist, Jan. 30, 2015, \navailable at https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-fine-maybe-we-wont-police-protests-with-machine-guns.  \n28 Ali Winston, NYPD Unit At Center Of Protest Policing Has Dozens Of Officers With Long Misconduct Histories, \nThe Appeal, Oct. 15, 2020, available at https://theappeal.org/nypd-srg-misconduct/.  \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 55 of 85\n427.  However, many of the officers deployed to respond to the protests in 2020, did not \neven receive that training, which was supposedly required of them. \n428.  As a result, as a report by the Corporation Counsel for the City of New York (“OCC \nReport”) noted, “for a majority of the officers who were assigned to the George Floyd protests, \ntheir training on policing protests was limited to what they had received as recruits in the \nAcademy.”29 \n429.  Between at least 2004 and the present, the NYPD’s mass arrest and violent crowd \ncontrol and protest policing tactics have been on full display in the streets of New York City; the \nsubjects of unfavorable coverage in the media, including coverage explicitly showing video \nevidence of NYPD members engaging in uses of excessive force in connection with crowd control \nwhile policing protests; documented in complaints to the Civilian Complaint Review Board and \nother agencies, as well as the litigations discussed above, which have cost the city tens of millions \nof dollars in judgments and settlements. \n430.  Indeed, in connection with the 2002 World Economic Forum and the 2004 RNC \npolicing operations, NYPD supervisors - including DCU supervisors charged with designing and \nimplementing NYPD protest policing-related policies and related training – routinely created \n“after action reports” that documented and critiqued NYPD plans for and responses to protest \nactivities. \n431.  For example, in a March 17, 2006 New York Times article that was published while \ndiscovery about related policies and practices was ongoing in the 2004 RNC litigations, “Police \nMemos Say Arrest Tactics Calmed Protest,” Jim Dwyer reported on the revelation of 2002 WEF \n \n29 New York City Law Department, Corporation Counsel Report (Dec. 2020) (“OCC Report”), \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/law/downloads/pdf/ProtestReport-np.pdf. \n \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 56 of 85\nafter-action reports in then-ongoing litigation, Allen v. City of New York, 03 Civ. 2829 (KMW) \n(GWG) (SDNY).30 \n432.  Those reports praise employing militarized tactics such as the “staging of massive \namounts” of officers in riot gear including riot helmets and militarized “equipment” such armored \nvehicles, prisoner wagons, and buses in view of demonstrations in order to “cause them to be \nalarmed” and as a “deterrent” as well as the use of “proactive” arrests in order to have a “powerful \npsychological effect” on protesters.  \n433.  After the 2002 WEF after-action reports were disclosed in Allen and the 2004 RNC-\nrelated after-action reports were disclosed in the RNC litigations, and some of them were made \npublic as a result, upon information and belief, rather than continuing to create such reports frankly \ndocumenting and assessing the NYPD’s protest policing-related policies and tactics, the NYPD \nopted to stop creating such records. \n434.  For example, according to the Corporation Counsel’s report, NYPD records do not \nshow any protest-related after action reviews undertaken between the 2004 Republican National \nConvention and until the events of the George Floyd protests. \n435.  Nevertheless, upon information and belief, at all times relevant herein, defendants \nde Blasio, Shea, Monahan, and other defendant City policymakers, routinely received reports \nregarding arrests made in connection with perceived First Amendment assemblies, including \nthrough internal reports such as Unusual Occurrence Reports; Mass Arrest Reports including data \ntracking arrestees, the length of time it took them to go through the system, whether they were \nreleased with a summons or DAT, their proposed arrest charges, and other information related to \nthe status and/or dispositions of the cases; internal critiques from supervisors and other officers \n \n30 Jim Dwyer, “Police Memos Say Arrest Tactics Calmed Protest,” N.Y. Times, March 17, 2006, available at \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/17/nyregion/police-memos-say-arrest-tactics-calmed-protest.html. \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 57 of 85\ninvolved in mass arrests related to police actions taken in relation to an event; and/or other reports \nincluding information arrests, use of force protest arrest processing, and/or related prosecutions. \n436.  Despite the wealth of evidence of NYPD members’ historical brutality against \nprotesters, Defendant City has ignored, and/or failed to utilize, relevant information, including \ninformation gleaned from reports and lawsuits, as well as other data points, to identify deficiencies \nin NYPD training as it relates to constitutionally compliant protest policing  \n437.  For  example,  in  a  deposition  in  Packard  v.  City  of  New  York,  15-cv-7130 \n(S.D.N.Y.), the City of New York testified that in regards to protest police training it did not review \n(i)  decline  to  prosecute  decisions,  (ii)  conviction  conversion  rates  or  (iii)  allegations  and \nsettlements in lawsuits relating to protest. \n438.  As  another  example,  Defendant  City  apparently  does  not  take  allegations  in \nlawsuits filed by protesters claiming they were falsely arrested during protests into account in \nconsidering its protest policing-related policies and training, in effect taking the position that there \nis nothing to be learned from lawsuits and settlements. \n439.  For example, in a 2017 deposition, Defendant City could identify no impact \nlitigation against Defendant City between 2000 and 2011 had on Defendant City’s relevant \npolicies, practices, customs, or training. \n440.  Relatedly, according to the Corporation Counsel, “the NYPD does not demonstrate \na consistent commitment to reviewing and responding to external critiques regarding the policing \nof protests.”31   \n441.  Defendant de Blasio directed the DOI and the Corporation Counsel to produce the \nDOI and Corporation Counsel reports referred to herein.  \n \n31 OCC Report at 2, 30.   \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 58 of 85\n442.  While both City agencies made reports and recommendations that include what \nmay be characterized as critiques of some NYPD protest-related training, neither the DOI nor the \nCorporation Counsel, nor any other City agency, has released the contents of that training – despite \nthat much of its core contents are already publicly available, including on the public docket in \nCase, et al. v. City of New York, et al., 14 Civ. 9148 (AT)(BCM). \n443.  At  bottom,  the  NYPD’s  near-exclusive  focus  on  deterring,  dispersing,  and \ndemoralizing in trainings related to policing protests, coupled with the failure to train on specific, \nrelevant aspects of constitutional policing of protests, let alone how to encourage or facilitate \nprotests - despite having received clear notice that NYPD policing of protests has caused the \nsystemic violations of protesters’ constitutional rights for years – demonstrates both a history, and \na policy, of disregard for the First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, and \nother, related rights of Plaintiffs and other similarly injured protesters. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS  \n \n444.  Pursuant to Rule 23(a), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nthe named Plaintiffs ADAMA SOW, DAVID JAKLEVIC, ALEXANDRA DE MUCHA PINO, \nOSCAR  RIOS,  BARBARA  ROSS,  MATTHEW  BREDDER,  SABRINA  ZURKUHLEN, \nMARIA SALAZAR, DARA PLUCHINO, and SAVITRI DURKEE seek to represent a certified \nPlaintiff class consisting of (a) all persons who attended the protest marches in opposition to the \nhistoric and ongoing systemic violation of constitutional rights of those police encounter in New \nYork City from May 28, 2020 through June 6, 2020 (the “Protests”) who were arrested and had \ntheir summonses or charges dismissed; (b) all persons who suffered physical and emotional harm \nas a result of the NYPD’s excessive force and mass arrest at and detention after attending the \nProtests in support; (c) all persons who have been or will be subjected to the NYPD’s policy, \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 59 of 85\npractice, and/or custom of intentionally and violently disrupting protests in violation of, inter alia, \nthe First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and the New York \nState Constitution (the “Class” or “Class Members”). \n445.  The members of each class are so numerous as to render joinder impractical. A \nreport from the NYC Department of Investigation indicates that at least 2,047 individuals were \narrested by the NYPD in connection with the Protests.32 Upon information and belief, hundreds or \nthousands more suffered physical and emotional harm as a result of the NYPD’s actions at the \nProtests  but  were  not  arrested.33  Individual  demonstrations  during  the  Protests  sometimes \nnumbered up to 10,000 individuals, and large protest groups were subjected to kettling and use of \nforce, including batons.34 Given the substantial number of individuals involved with the Protests, \nthe members of the class and any potential future subclasses are so numerous as to render joinder \nimpractical.  \n446.  In addition, joinder is impractical because, upon information and belief, many \nmembers of each class are not aware of the fact that their constitutional and statutory rights have \nbeen violated and that they have the right to redress in Court.  Upon information and belief, many \nmembers of the class are without the means to retain an attorney to represent them in a civil rights \nlawsuit.   \n447.  Common questions of law and fact predominate over individual ones among class \nmembers, including, but not limited to:    \n \n32 DOI Report, Dec. 2020, at 30. \n33 Id. at 28 (indicating the CCRB received 1,052 protest-related force allegations against the NYPD from May 28 to \nJune 20, 2020).  \n34 Id. at 22, 20.  \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 60 of 85\na.  Whether  the  City  engages  in  a  policy,  practice,  and/or  custom  of  violently \ndisrupting protests in violation of protections against First Amendment retaliation \nand other violations of their First Amendment rights.  \nb.  Whether the City engages in a policy, practice, and/or custom of arresting perceived \nprotesters  under  circumstances  in  which  a  clearly  communicated  order  and \nmeaningful opportunity to comply, coupled with refusal to comply, are required in \norder to provide legal justification, when such fair warning was not given and \ndisregarded, including, but not limited to, through the enforcement of the Curfew \nOrders. \nc.  Whether the City engages in a policy, practice, and/or custom of using excessive \nforce on protesters, including, but not limited to, by tightly handcuffing protesters \nwith flex-cuffs and/or failing to loosen and/or remove unduly tight flex-cuffs. \nd.  Whether the City engages in a policy, practice, and/or custom of unreasonably \nprolonging or extending the detention of individuals arrested at protests against \npolice brutality beyond that of otherwise similarly situated arrestees.  \ne.  Whether the City’s treatment of protesters during full-blown, custodial arrests amid \nthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic amounts to an unreasonable seizure and/or \nunconstitutional conditions of confinement in violation of the First, Fourth, and/or  \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  \nf.  Whether the City, New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea, and other \nsupervisory defendants, supervising officials, and/or personnel, have knowingly \nand deliberately failed to screen, train, supervise, monitor, and discipline officers, \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 61 of 85\nand  whether  those  failures  have  resulted  in  and  will  continue  to  result  in \nconstitutional violations by officers and City employees against Class members.  \ng.  Whether the City, New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea, and other \nsupervisory defendants, supervising officials, and/or personnel, sanctioned and/or \ndeliberately failed to rectify unconstitutional practices and customs, and whether \nsuch acts and omissions have resulted in and will continue to result in constitutional \nviolations by officers and City employees against class members. \n448.  These common questions of fact and law all flow from the same policies, enacted \nand implemented by the named and unnamed Defendants.  Defendant City of New York’s city-\nwide policies, practices, and custom with regard to the Protests constitutes a unitary scheme in \nwhich the Defendants violate the constitutional rights of Class members. The named Plaintiffs and \nall class members were and are victimized by these same policies of intentionally and violently \ndisrupting protests in violation of, inter alia, the First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the \nUnited States Constitution, and the New York State Constitution, and thus the foregoing common \nquestions of law and fact greatly predominate over any questions affecting only individual \nmembers, including legal and factual issues relating to damages.  \n449.  Defendant the City of New York failed to implement constitutional protest policies \ncity-wide and failed to review and remediate noncompliance with the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth \nAmendments in the NYPD response to protest activities. \n450.  The Named Plaintiffs are adequate class representatives because they were and are \ndirectly impacted by the Defendants’ intentional and violent disruption of protests, and Plaintiffs \nare typical of the members of each class. Like other members of both the Injunctive and Damages \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 62 of 85\nClasses, named Plaintiffs were subject to First Amendment Retaliation, excessive use of force, and \nunconditional conditions of confinement.  \n451.  Like other members of both the injunctive and damages Classes, named Plaintiffs \nrisk being arrested in the future and/or likely will continue to be subject to the Defendants’ \nunconstitutional conduct. \n452.  Plaintiffs are residents of New York City and are susceptible to excessive force and \nmass arrest at and detention after protests in the same patently impermissible manner should these \nunconstitutional practices not be enjoined from continuing. \n453.  In fact, Plaintiff Bredder was arrested on multiple occasions at the Protests. During \neach arrest, he was subjected to First Amendment retaliation, excessive force, and unconstitutional \nconditions of confinement. \n454.  The legal theories under which the named Plaintiffs seek relief are the same or \nsimilar to those on which all members of the class will rely, and the harms suffered by the named \nPlaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered by the class members. \n455.  The Named Plaintiffs have a strong personal and representational interests in the \noutcome of this action, have no conflicts of interest with members of either class, and will fairly \nand adequately protect the interests of each class.  Plaintiffs’ interests are not antagonistic to, or in \nconflict with, the interests of the class as a whole. \n456.  As long as the City engages in its policies, practices, and/or customs of intentionally \nand violently disrupting protests in violation of protections against First Amendment retaliation; \ntightly handcuffing protesters with flex-cuffs in a reckless manner constituting a deliberate \nindifference to the risk of actual physical injury; unreasonably prolonging or extending the \ndetention of individuals arrested at protests against police brutality beyond that of otherwise \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 63 of 85\nsimilarly situated arrestees; and detaining protesters during custodial arrests amid the ongoing \nCOVID-19  pandemic  in  such  a  manner  as  to  amount  to  an  unreasonable  seizure  and/or \nunconstitutional conditions of confinement in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments \nto the United States Constitution, the named Plaintiffs are and will remain at high risk of having \ntheir constitutional rights violated by Defendants.  \n457.  Plaintiffs are represented by Jonathan C. Moore, David B. Rankin, and Luna Droubi \nof the law firm Beldock, Levine & Hoffman LLP (“BLH”); Elena L. Cohen and J. Remy Green \nCohen&Green P.L.L.C. (“C&G”); Gideon Orion Oliver (“Oliver”); and Wylie Stecklow PLLC \n(“Stecklow”). \n458.  BLH attorneys have litigated a number of class action lawsuits including, but not \nlimited to: Syed v. City of New York, 16-cv-04789 (S.D.N.Y.); Elsayed v. City of New York et al., \n18-cv-10566 (S.D.N.Y.); Floyd v. City of New York, 08-cv-1034 (S.D.N.Y.) (currently in the \nremedial stages); Daniels v. City of N.Y., 198 F.R.D. 409, 418 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (“Aided by the \ncapable hands of Jonathan C. Moore . . ., class counsel is undoubtedly qualified and experienced \nto conduct this litigation.”); see also MacNamara v. City of N.Y., 275 F.R.D. 125, 154 (S.D.N.Y. \n2011).   \n459.  C&G attorneys have litigated a number of class action and police suits, including, \nbut not limited to: Jones v. United States Postal Service, 20-cv-6516 (S.D.N.Y.) (nationwide \nvoting rights class action); Edrei v. Bratton, 16-cv-01652 (S.D.N.Y.), aff’d sub. nom. Edrei v. \nMaguire, 892 F.3d 525 (2d Cir. 2018) (landmark, precedential decision in challenge to NYPD’s \nuse of Long Range Acoustic Device (“LRAD”) against Black Lives Matter protesters), cert. denied \nMaguire v. Edrei, 139 S. Ct. 2614 (2019) (with Oliver); Gallagher v. N.Y. State. Bd. of Elections, \n20-cv-5504 (S.D.N.Y.) (New York State voting rights class action).  See also Yang v. N.Y. State \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 64 of 85\nBd. of Elections, 20-cv-3325 (S.D.N.Y.), aff’d sub. nom. Yang v. Kosinski, 960 F.3d 119 (2d Cir. \n2020).  \n460.  Oliver has over 16 years of experience litigating civil rights cases against the \nNYPD, including hundreds of cases challenging the City’s policies, practices, and customs related \nto protest policing. Oliver has frequently co-counseled with BLH attorneys and C&G attorneys in \nlitigation. For example, in addition to litigating other 2004 RNC-related cases, Oliver was Of \nCounsel to BLH attorneys at the summary judgment briefing stage of the MacNamara RNC 2004 \nclass action litigation. Ever since, Oliver has always maintained a docket including at least dozens \nof Plaintiffs’ protest-policing related cases. One such recent case was Edrei (with C&G). \n461.  Stecklow has extensive experience litigating civil rights both in New York and \nelsewhere including Baltimore, Maryland: Lomax v. O’Ree, 24-C-16-002313 (Circuit Court, \nBaltimore City) and Iowa: Cordero v. World Food Prize, 17CV0347 (S.D.Iowa).  Stecklow has \nbeen litigating NYPD policies and practices for fifteen (15) years, including, but not limited to: \nAlford v. City of New York, 06-cv-2512 (S.D.N.Y.); Peat v. City of New York, 12-cv-8230 \n(S.D.N.Y.); Gerskovich v. Iocco, City of New York, 15-cv-7280 (S.D.N.Y.), Packard v. City of \nNew York, 15-cv-7130 (S.D.N.Y.); Nigro v. City of New York, 19-cv-2369 (S.D.N.Y.); Monahan \nv. City of New York, 20-cv-2610 (S.D.N.Y.). \n462.  Plaintiffs counsel’s firms have the resources, expertise, and experience to prosecute \nthis action, and know of no conflicts among members of the class or between the attorneys and \nmembers of the class. \n463.  The Injunctive Class should be certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure because the Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 65 of 85\nthe class, in engaging in the aforementioned practices and failing to correct the aforementioned \nunconstitutional policies thereby making class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief appropriate. \n464.  The Damages Class should be certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) because questions \nof law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only \nindividual class members and a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and \nefficient adjudication of the controversy. A Class-wide proceeding will generate common answers \nto these questions. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \nUnlawful Seizure / False Arrest   \n \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for Defendants’ Violations of Plaintiffs’ Rights Under the \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \n \n465.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding and \nfollowing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n466.  Defendants had no judicial warrant authorizing then to seize any Plaintiff. \n467.  Defendants  seized  Plaintiffs,  restricting  their  freedom  of  movement,  without \nprivilege or lawful justification.  \n468.  Plaintiffs were conscious of their confinements by Defendants. \n469.  Plaintiffs did not consent to their confinements by Defendants. \n470.  It was unreasonable for Defendants to believe that they had lawful cause to seize, \ndetain, or arrest Plaintiffs.  \n471.  Thus, Defendants did not have individualized probable cause to seize, detain, or \narrest Plaintiffs.  \n472.  Additionally, as discussed elsewhere herein, Defendants City, de Blasio, Shea, \nand/or Monahan designed and/or implemented policies and practices pursuant to which those \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 66 of 85\nDefendants who ordered, effected, and otherwise participated in arresting Plaintiffs subjected \nPlaintiffs to unlawful seizures, false arrests, and/or searches and/or seizures of their persons and/or \nproperty.   \n473.  In many cases, Defendants seized Plaintiffs based on the perception that they were \npart of a perceived group, without having made an individualized determination that there was \nprobable cause to arrest the Plaintiff in question based on their own, individual conduct, as opposed \nto the perceived “group conduct.”  \n474.  In many cases, Defendants failed to give constitutionally meaningful and adequate \ndispersal orders and meaningful opportunities to disperse prior to making arrests where such notice \nand opportunity were required.  \n475.  For example, with respect to Plaintiffs who were arrested in connection with \nperceived violations of Defendant de Blasio’s Curfew Orders, or for perceived violations of New \nYork Penal Law § 240.20(6) (Disorderly Conduct – Failure to Obey Lawful Dispersal Order), \nDefendants  failed  to  give  constitutionally  meaningful  and  adequate  dispersal  orders  and \nmeaningful opportunities to disperse prior to making such arrests, and/or ensure that each such \narrested Plaintiff had the state of mind required for such arrest. \n476.  With respect to Defendant de Blasio’s Curfew Orders, the plain language of \nDefendant de Blasio’s Curfew Orders required both (a) a knowing violation of the Executive Order \nprior to any arrest and (b) that any arrest could only follow a dispersal order, a meaningful \nopportunity to disperse, and a person’s refusal to comply with the order. \n477.  As pleaded elsewhere herein, Defendants enforced the Curfew Orders by arresting \nPlaintiffs and other protesters without first ensuring that they had been given dispersal orders, \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 67 of 85\nmeaningful opportunities to disperse, and refused to comply, under circumstances in which they \nhad not ensured that arrestees had knowingly violated the Curfew Orders. \n478.  That enforcement was consistent with official NYPD policy.  \n479.  For example, in a September 16, 2020 letter from NYPD Deputy Commissioner of \nLegal Matters Ernest F. Hart to Ida Sawyer, Acting Crisis and Conflict Director, Human Rights \nWatch35, DCLM Hart stated that officers who merely “observed individuals who were not essential \nworkers in public…[t]hat observation provided officers with probable cause to take, at a minimum, \nenforcement for Administrative Code § 3-108, Violating a Mayoral Executive Order, a ‘B’ \nMisdemeanor.”  \n480.  Additionally, in many cases, Defendants enforced other provisions of New York \nlaw against Plaintiffs and other perceived protesters without probable cause and/or without first \nhaving  given  constitutionally  meaningful  and  adequate  dispersal  orders  and  meaningful \nopportunities to disperse prior to making such arrests. \n481.  For example, with respect to Plaintiffs who were arrested in connection with \nperceived violations of P.L. § 240.20(5) (Disorderly Conduct – Blocking Pedestrian or Vehicular \nTraffic), Defendants failed to ensure that each such arrested Plaintiff had caused a criminally \nsignificant blockage of traffic, and/or to ensure that each such arrested Plaintiff had the state of \nmind required for such arrest. \n482.  By  way  of  further  example,  with  respect  to  Plaintiffs  who  were  arrested  in \nconnection with perceived violations of New York Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1156(a) (Pedestrians \non Roadway), Defendants failed to ensure that each such arrested Plaintiff had notice that they \n \n35 Available online at https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/media_2020/09/Annex%20II_0.pdf. \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 68 of 85\nwere allegedly violating the law by walking along and/or upon a roadway and/or a meaningful \nopportunity to conform their conduct to the law in order to avoid being arrested.  \n483.  In many cases, Defendants employed a crowd control tactic in which Defendants \npushed and/or corralled and/or otherwise physically trapped perceived groups including Plaintiffs \nand other perceived protesters, without first having given Plaintiffs and the others so pushed and/or \ncorralled and/or trapped meaningful notice and an opportunity to disperse or otherwise change \ntheir conduct in order to avoid being so pushed and/or corralled and/or trapped.  \n484.  One version of the above-described pushing/corralling/trapping tactic, in which \npolice encircle or otherwise surround a perceived group, is commonly referred to as “kettling.”   \n485.  Beyond that, in many cases, Defendants arrested Plaintiffs for alleged offenses in \nconnection with which New York Criminal Procedure Law § 150.20 required that Plaintiffs \nreceive summonses on the street in lieu of a fuller or lengthier detention; and/or in connection with \nwhich, under the NYPD policies and practices that are applied in non-protest contexts, arrestees \nare taken directly to a nearby local precinct, and released in an average of between around two and \nfour hours with a summons.  \n486.  However, because Defendants arrested Plaintiffs and other arrestees in connection \nwith a protest, Defendants subjected them to Defendants’ Protest Arrest Processing Policies, which \ninvolved,  among  other  components,  placing  Plaintiffs  and  other  arrestees  in  flex-cuffs  and \nremoving them from the street to a centralized arrest processing location such as a Mass Arrest \nProcessing Center (“MAPC”), where Defendants subject them to large-scale arrest processing \nprocedures and Mass Arrest Processing Plan (“MAPP”) rather than issuing them summonses, and \nreleasing them from custody, on the street.  \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 69 of 85\n487.  As a result, instead of detaining Plaintiffs and other arrestees for a relatively brief \nperiod of time on the street, issuing them summonses, and releasing them, Defendants subjected \nPlaintiffs to unreasonably long, onerous, punitive arrest processing, as well as obviously hazardous \nconditions of confinement given the COVID-19 pandemic. \n488.  Additionally, as a result, instead of detaining Plaintiffs and other arrestees for a \nrelatively brief period of time on the street, issuing them summonses, and releasing them, as part \nof Defendants’ Protest Arrest Processing Policies and MAPP, Defendants subjected Plaintiffs to \nsearches of their persons and property, as well as seizures and/or retentions of their property \nwithout Due Process. \n489.  As a result of Defendants’ acts and omissions, Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of \ntheir federal, state, and/or other legal rights; caused Plaintiffs bodily injury, pain, suffering, \npsychological and/or emotional injury, and/or humiliation; caused Plaintiffs to expend costs and \nexpenses; and/or otherwise damaged and injured Plaintiffs. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \nExcessive Force  \n \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for Defendants’ Violations of Plaintiffs’ Rights Under the \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \n \n490.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding and \nfollowing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n491.  Defendants  used  force  against  Plaintiffs  that  was  unjustified  and  objectively \nunreasonable, taking into consideration the facts and circumstances that confronted Defendants. \n492.  The types and levels of force Defendants used against Plaintiffs were unjustified \nand objectively unreasonable, taking into consideration the facts and circumstances that confronted \nDefendants. \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 70 of 85\n493.  In many cases, Defendants used types and levels of force against Plaintiffs and \nother protesters that were in contravention of, or inconsistent with, related NYPD policies and/or \ntraining. \n494.  In  many  cases,  Defendants  failed  to  document,  and/or  require  that  fellow \nDefendants and/or other fellow officers document, uses of force in accordance with related NYPD \npolicies and/or training. \n495.  In many cases, Defendants failed to investigate incidents of which they were aware \nor should have been aware in which NYPD members used excessive force against Plaintiffs and \nother protesters.  \n496.  In many cases, failed to discipline NYPD members who used excessive force \nagainst Plaintiffs and other protesters.  \n497.  In many cases, Defendants used force against Plaintiffs based on their position in \nor  proximity  to  a  perceived  group,  without  first  having  given  the  perceived  group  clearly \ncommunicated, prior notice as well as a meaningful opportunity to comply with police orders \nand/or dissociate with the perceived group.  \n498.  In many cases, Defendants used types of force, such as by deploying pepper spray, \nthat they knew, or should have known, would impact numerous people at one time, and/or cause \nlasting pain, suffering, and/or injury, without making individualized or otherwise appropriate \ndeterminations about whether those uses of force were necessary, justified, or reasonable under \nthe circumstances.  \n499.  Additionally, Plaintiffs and others arrested at the protests that are the subject of this \nlitigation were handcuffed with their wrists together and their hands behind their back with plastic \nflex-cuffs. \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 71 of 85\n500.  In many cases, Plaintiffs and/or other arrestees complained about the fact that their \nflex-cuffs were too tight and/or causing them injury. \n501.  Specifically, because they were arrested at a protest, Plaintiffs were subjected to \nflex-cuffing pursuant to Defendants’ Protest Arrest Processing Policies, in connection with which \nDefendant City did not supply Defendants with an adequate numbers of cutting tools with which \nto loosen or remove flex-cuffs, or any flex-cuff pads, which are designed to prevent the very types \nof injuries Plaintiffs and other arrestees suffered as a result of having flex-cuffs applied to them. \n502.  It was no secret to Defendants that using flex-cuffs to restrain protesters – including \nwithout providing adequate numbers of cutting tools or any protective padding – would result in \ninjuries to protesters, of the sort that appropriate policies, training, and/or supervision would have \navoided.  \n503.  For example, Burley v. City of New York, 03 Civ. 2915 (WHP)(FM) 2005 WL \n668789 (S.D.N.Y. March 23, 2005) was a class action arising from mass arrests of over 200 \ndemonstrators during 2002 WEF in New York City challenging, inter alia, the NYPD’s then-\npolicy and practice of using plastic flex cuffs as “unreasonable and excessive because of the \nmanner in which the handcuffs were applied and the length of time for plaintiffs were handcuffed.” \n504.  By way of additional example, Plaintiffs in Kunstler v. City of New York, 04 Civ. \n1145 (RWS)(MHD) (S.D.N.Y.) and other related cases arising from alleged false and retaliatory \narrests in connection with police responses to protests on April 7, 2003, also raised Monell claims \naround NYPD members’ use of extremely tight, plastic handcuffs.  \n505.  And, as a final, further example, in MacNamara v. City of New York, 04 Civ. 9216 \n(RJS)(JCF) (S.D.N.Y.), the Court certified a “Conditions of Confinement Class, comprising all \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 72 of 85\nRNC arrestees who were handcuffed with plastic flex cuffs.” See MacNamara v. City of New York, \n275 F.R.D. 125, 154 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). \n506.  The DOI Report found, “When voicing those concerns to their arresting officers or \nother officers in the area, arrestees were told that the officers lacked the necessary equipment to \nremove the flex-cuffs. Arrestees therefore had to wait, oftentimes for long periods, until they got \nto their respective arrest processing center so that flex-cuffs could be removed.”36 \n507.  As a result of Defendants’ acts and omissions, Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of \ntheir federal, state, and/or other legal rights; caused Plaintiffs bodily injury, pain, suffering, \npsychological and/or emotional injury, and/or humiliation; caused Plaintiffs to expend costs and \nexpenses; and/or otherwise damaged and injured Plaintiffs. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \nFirst Amendment Infringements, Including First Amendment Retaliation  \n \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for Defendants’ Violations of Plaintiffs’ Rights Under the First \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \n \n508.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding and \nfollowing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n509.  Plaintiffs hereby mount an as-applied, First Amendment-based challenges to the \napplication of NYC Administrative Code § 3-108; PL §§ 240.20(5) and/or 240.20(6); and/or VTL \n§ 1156(a) to their conduct and the events leading up to their arrests, as well as to their related \ncharging and/or prosecutions. \n510.  Defendants (a) retaliated against Plaintiffs for engaging in speech and/or conduct \nprotected by the First Amendment, and (b) imposed restrictions on such protected speech and/or \n \n36 See, e.g., DOI Report at 42.  See also, AG Report at 29 (“Officers kept the [flex-cuffs] on their wrists even after \nthey were placed in cells, which, for some, cut off their circulation or caused other injuries to their wrists, including \ncuts and nerve damage.”).   \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 73 of 85\nconduct that violated Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights, including, but not limited to, in falsely \narresting Plaintiffs, in subjecting Plaintiffs to excessive force, in selectively enforcing laws and \nregulations against Plaintiffs, in subjecting Plaintiffs to Defendants’ Protest Arrest Processing \nPolicies, and in otherwise violating Plaintiffs’ rights and engaging in the acts and omissions \ncomplained of herein.  \n511.  Defendants engaged in those and other acts and omissions complained of herein in \nretaliation for Plaintiffs’ protected speech and/or conduct. \n512.  Defendants engaged in the acts and omissions complained of herein in order to \nprevent Plaintiffs from continuing to engage in such protected speech and/or conduct. \n513.  Defendants engaged in the acts and omissions complained of herein in order to \nprevent and/or discourage Plaintiffs from engaging in similar protected conduct in the future. \n514.  Additionally,  as  discussed  elsewhere  herein,  Defendants  City,  Shea,  and/or \nMonahan designed and/or implemented policies and practices pursuant to which those Defendants \nwho implemented them subjected Plaintiffs to violations of the First Amendment rights.    \n515.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  engaged  in  the  acts  and  omissions \ncomplained of herein with respect to Plaintiffs’ First Amendment-based claims – including the \nrelated municipal liability claims involving the adoption of policies, practices, and/or customs \nand/or related failures to train, supervise, and/or discipline - with malice. \n516.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  engaged  in  the  acts  and  omissions \ncomplained of herein with respect to Plaintiffs’ First Amendment retaliation claims – including \nthe related municipal liability claims involving the adoption of policies, practices, and/or customs \nand/or related failures to train, supervise, and/or discipline – in response to the perceived viewpoint \nand/or message expressed by Plaintiffs.  \n73 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 74 of 85\n517.  Upon information and belief, Defendants did not subject other protesters expressing \n“Blue Lives Matter” or other, similar, pro-police messages who were similarly situated to Plaintiffs \nin terms of their conduct and/or its potential public ramifications to the conduct, policies, practices, \nand/or customs complained of herein.  \n518.  Additionally, the offenses charged against Plaintiffs, which Defendants might \nargue provided probable cause for Plaintiffs’ arrests, were all offenses that Defendants typically \nexercise their discretion not to enforce, or not to make arrests in connection with – for example, \nVTL § 1156(a), which involves walking along or upon a roadway when an adjacent and usable \nsidewalk is available – the equivalent of jaywalking, an everyday offense that Defendants all but \nignore in the City. \n519.  Each Plaintiff suffered actual chill in that each Plaintiff was prevented and/or \ndeterred from or impeded in participating in protected conduct on the date of and after the incident; \nand/or suffered adverse effects on their protected speech and/or conduct; and/or otherwise suffered \nsome concrete harm(s).  \n520.  Additionally,  in  many  cases,  Defendants  apparently  permitted,  acquiesced  in, \nand/or facilitated the speech and/or other expressive conduct in which Plaintiffs were engaging, \nbefore suddenly using force and/or making arrests, without first having given reasonable notice \nthat  such  force  and/or  arrest  activity  would  result  if  Plaintiffs  did  not  conduct  themselves \ndifferently and/or disperse, as well as a meaningful opportunity to comply.  \n521.  In addition to being retaliatory, the restrictions Plaintiffs complain of herein, which \nDefendants imposed on Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights to participate in, observe, and/or stand \nnearby speech, conduct, association, and/or other expressive activities protected by the First \nAmendment on the streets, were themselves regulations on Plaintiffs’ protected conduct that: \n74 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 75 of 85\na.  Were viewpoint discriminatory and/or otherwise not content-neutral, and \nwere  not  necessary,  and  precisely  tailored,  to  serve  compelling \ngovernmental interests, and/or were not the least restrictive means readily \navailable to serve those interests; or, alternately,  \nb.  Were content-neutral, but lacked narrow tailoring to serve a significant \ngovernmental interest, in that they burdened substantially more protected \nspeech and/or conduct than necessary to serve those interests, and/or failed \nto provide ample alternatives for Plaintiffs’ protected expression, including \nin that Plaintiffs’ abilities to communicate effectively were threatened; \nand/or \nc.  Afforded  Defendants  unbridled  or  otherwise  inappropriately  limited \ndiscretion to limit or deny Plaintiffs’ abilities to engage in protected conduct \n(also  raising  constitutionally  significant  Due  Process-based  vagueness \nand/or overbreadth concerns); and/or \nd.  Amounted to the imposition of strict liability on Plaintiffs for engaging in \nprotected speech and/or expression.  \n522.  Additionally, as discussed elsewhere herein, Defendants City, de Blasio, Shea, \nand/or Monahan designed and/or implemented policies and practices pursuant to which those \nDefendants who ordered, effected, and otherwise participated in arresting and detaining Plaintiffs \nsubjected Plaintiffs to these violations of their First Amendment rights. \n523.  As a result of Defendants’ acts and omissions, Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of \ntheir federal, state, and/or other legal rights; caused Plaintiffs bodily injury, pain, suffering, \n75 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 76 of 85\npsychological and/or emotional injury, and/or humiliation; caused Plaintiffs to expend costs and \nexpenses; and/or otherwise damaged and injured Plaintiffs. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \nDue Process \n \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for Defendants’ Violations of Plaintiffs’ Rights Protected Under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \n \n524.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding and \nfollowing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n525.  Plaintiffs  hereby  mount  an  as-applied,  Due  Process-based  challenge  to  the \napplication of NYC Administrative Code § 3-108; PL §§ 240.20(5) and/or 240.20(6); and/or VTL \n§ 1156(a) to their conduct and the events leading up to their arrests, as well as to their related \ncharging and/or prosecutions. \n526.  As described above, Defendants enforced offenses, including the Curfew Orders \nand NYC Administrative Code § 3-108; PL §§ 240.20(5) and 240.20(6); and VTL § 1156(a), in a \nmanner that rendered them constitutionally void for vagueness and/or overbroad, such that their \nenforcement against Plaintiffs violated their Due Process rights.  \n527.  For example, Defendants’ enforcement in connection with those offenses failed to \nprovide and/or reflected the absence of adequately clear standards to guide police officials’ \nextremely broad discretion to arrest anyone at their whim, based on ad hoc determinations, often \nwithout fair warning.  \n528.  For example, with respect to Plaintiffs who were arrested in connection with \nperceived violations of P.L. § 240.20(5) (Disorderly Conduct – Blocking Pedestrian or Vehicular \nTraffic), Defendants failed to ensure that each such arrested Plaintiff had caused a criminally \n76 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 77 of 85\nsignificant blockage of traffic, and/or to ensure that each such arrested Plaintiff had the state of \nmind that would have been required to authorize such an arrest. \n529.  By  way  of  further  example,  with  respect  to  Plaintiffs  who  were  arrested  in \nconnection with  perceived violations of  P.L. § 240.20(6) (Disorderly Conduct  – Failure to \nDisperse), Defendants failed to ensure that lawful, clearly communicated dispersal orders and \nmeaningful opportunities to disperse were given and that Plaintiffs refused to comply with them, \nand/or to ensure that each such arrested Plaintiff had the state of mind that would have been \nrequired to authorize such an arrest. \n530.  For example, with respect to Plaintiffs who were arrested in connection with \nperceived violations of the Curfew Orders, Defendants failed to ensure that lawful, clearly \ncommunicated dispersal orders and meaningful opportunities to disperse were given and that \nPlaintiffs refused to comply with them, and/or to ensure that each such arrested Plaintiff had the \nstate of mind that would have been required to authorize such an arrest. \n531.  By  way  of  further  example,  with  respect  to  Plaintiffs  who  were  arrested  in \nconnection with perceived violations of New York Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1156(a) (Pedestrians \non Roadway), Defendants failed to ensure that each such arrested Plaintiff had notice that they \nwere allegedly violating the law by walking along and/or upon a roadway and/or a meaningful \nopportunity to conform their conduct to the law in order to avoid being arrested. \n532.  Additionally, as described above, in many cases, Defendants arrested Plaintiffs for \nalleged offenses in connection with which New York Criminal Procedure Law § 150.20 required \nthat Plaintiffs receive summonses on the street in lieu of a fuller or lengthier detention; and/or in \nconnection with which, under the NYPD policies and practices that are applied in non-protest \n77 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 78 of 85\ncontexts, arrestees are taken directly to a nearby local precinct, and released in an average of \nbetween around two and four hours with a summons.  \n533.  However, because Defendants arrested Plaintiffs and other arrestees in connection \nwith a protest, Defendants subjected them to Defendants’ Protest Arrest Processing Policies, which \ninvolved,  among  other  components,  placing  Plaintiffs  and  other  arrestees  in  flex-cuffs  and \nremoving them from the street to a centralized arrest processing location such as a MAPC, where \nDefendants subject them to large-scale arrest processing procedures and MAPP rather than issuing \nthem summonses, and releasing them from custody, on the street.  \n534.  Additionally, instead of detaining Plaintiffs and other arrestees for a relatively brief \nperiod of time on the street, issuing them summonses, and releasing them, as part of Defendants’ \nProtest Arrest Processing Policies and MAPP, Defendants subjected Plaintiffs and other arrestees \nto searches of their persons and property, as well as seizures and/or retentions of their property, \nwithout providing Plaintiffs and others situated with adequate pre-or post-deprivation notice and/or \nopportunity to be heard to challenge the grounds for seizing and/or retaining their property. \n535.  In  some  cases,  Defendants  destroyed  and/or  damaged  property  belonging  to \nPlaintiffs and other arrestees. \n536.  In other cases, Defendants seized and retained property from Plaintiffs and other \narrestees without providing them with the NYPD paperwork required by NYPD policies, practices, \nand procedures to retrieve property seized by NYPD members. \n537.  In other cases, Defendants seized and retained property without providing Plaintiffs \nwith a meaningful opportunity to retrieve it, for example because the location at which Defendants \nwere retaining the property was closed. \n78 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 79 of 85\n538.  As a result, instead of detaining Plaintiffs and other arrestees for a relatively brief \nperiod of time on the street, issuing them summonses, and releasing them, Defendants subjected \nPlaintiffs to flex-cuffing as well as unreasonably lengthy, onerous arrest processing, significantly \nincreasing the amount of time they would otherwise have been in custody and exposing them to \ninappropriate and especially hazardous conditions of confinement, particularly given that the \nconfinements took place around the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n539.  Additionally, instead of detaining Plaintiffs and other arrestees for a relatively brief \nperiod of time on the street, issuing them summonses, and releasing them, as part of Defendants’ \nProtest Arrest Processing Policies and MAPP, Defendants subjected Plaintiffs to conditions of \nconfinement that were overcrowded, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and/or \nfilthy and/or unsanitary; and that lacked appropriate access to phone calls, food, water, bathrooms \nsoap and/or hand sanitizer, other hygienic products such as tampons, and/or other basic necessities.   \n540.  With  particular  respect  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  during  Plaintiffs’ \nconfinements, the State of New York, and Defendant City, had advised people to comply with \nsocial distancing, to wear masks, and to engage in practices such as hand-washing; and Defendant \nCity, as well as Defendants Shea, Monahan, and other NYPD members, enforced Executive Orders \nissued by Mayor de Blasio requiring people to engage in social distancing and/or mask-wearing, \nall on an emergency basis. \n541.  However, as part of Defendants’ Protest Arrest Processing Policies and MAPP, \ninstead of detaining Plaintiffs and other arrestees for a relatively brief period of time on the street, \nissuing them summonses, and releasing them, Defendants transported Plaintiffs to a MAPC or \nother centralized arrest processing location, in close, forced proximity to other arrestees and NYPD \nmembers, many of whom were not wearing masks, rendering social distancing impossible. \n79 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 80 of 85\n542.  Relatedly, many Defendants and other nearby NYPD members were not wearing \nmasks while arresting and/or using force on and/or detaining Plaintiffs. \n543.  Also  relatedly,  Defendants  and  other  NYPD  members  removed  masks  many \nPlaintiffs and other arrestees who had masks at one point prior to or during their arrests or \ndetentions.  \n544.  Also  as  part  of  Defendants’  Protest  Arrest  Processing  Policies  and  MAPP, \nDefendants subjected Plaintiffs and other arrestees to conditions of confinement in which they \nwere unable to wash their hands or otherwise engage in other, similar hygienic practices that the \nState and City were recommending for public safety. \n545.  Defendants knew or should have known that, as a result of subjecting Plaintiffs and \nother arrestees to Defendants’ Protest Arrest Processing Policies and MAPP, they would deprive \nPlaintiffs and other arrestees of basic needs, including for example the need to stay safe from \nCOVID-19, as well as unreasonable risks of serious damage to their physical and/or mental health \nor safety through potential exposure to COVID-19. \n546.  Defendants acted intentionally to impose those conditions because they subjected \nPlaintiffs and other arrestees to Defendants’ Protest Arrest Processing Policies and MAPP.  \n547.  Additionally, Defendants recklessly failed to act with reasonable care to mitigate \nthe risks that the conditions posed even though they knew or should have known that they posed \nexcessive risks to Plaintiffs’ physical and/or mental health or safety through potential exposure to \nCOVID-19. \n548.  Moreover, the risks were obvious and apparent, including based on the State and \nCity policies and practices related to COVID-19 safety, and common sense. \n80 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 81 of 85\n549.  Additionally, as discussed elsewhere herein, Defendants City, de Blasio, Shea, \nand/or Monahan designed and/or implemented policies and practices pursuant to which those \nDefendants who ordered, effected, and otherwise participated in seizing and/or retaining Plaintiffs’ \nproperty and/or detaining Plaintiffs in the conditions as described subjected Plaintiffs to these \nviolations of their Due Process rights.  \n550.  As a result of Defendants’ acts and omissions, Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of \ntheir federal, state, and/or other legal rights; caused Plaintiffs bodily injury, pain, suffering, \npsychological and/or emotional injury, and/or humiliation; caused Plaintiffs to expend costs and \nexpenses; and/or otherwise damaged and injured Plaintiffs. \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nEqual Protection and Selective Enforcement   \n \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for Defendants’ Violations of Plaintiffs’ Rights Protected Under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \n \n551.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding and \nfollowing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n552.  Plaintiffs  hereby  mount  an  as-applied,  Equal  Protection-based,  selective \nenforcement challenge to the application of NYC Administrative Code § 3-108; P.L. §§ 240.20(5) \nand/or 240.20(6); and/or V.T.L. § 1156(a) to their conduct and the events leading up to their \narrests, as well as to their related charging and/or prosecutions.  \n553.  Additionally, as described above, in many cases, Defendants arrested Plaintiffs for \nalleged  offenses  in  connection  with  which  C.P.L.  §  150.20  required  that  Plaintiffs  receive \nsummonses on the street in lieu of a fuller or lengthier detention; and/or in connection with which, \nunder the NYPD policies and practices that are applied in non-protest contexts, arrestees are taken \n81 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 82 of 85\ndirectly to a nearby local precinct, and released in an average of between around two and four \nhours with a summons.  \n554.  However, because Defendants arrested Plaintiffs and other arrestees in connection \nwith a protest, Defendants subjected them to Defendants’ Protest Arrest Processing Policies, \nincluding Defendants’ large-scale arrest processing procedures and MAPP rather than issuing them \nsummonses, and releasing them from custody, on the street. \n555.  Defendants did not apply those same Protest Arrest Processing Policies to other \nsimilarly situated arrestees.  \n556.  Additionally, as discussed elsewhere herein, Defendants City, de Blasio, Shea, \nand/or Monahan designed and/or implemented policies and practices pursuant to which those \nDefendants who ordered, effected, and otherwise participated in arresting and/or detaining and/or \nprosecuting Plaintiffs subjected Plaintiffs to the above-described violations of Plaintiffs’ Equal \nProtection rights. \n557.  As a result of Defendants’ acts and omissions, Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of \ntheir federal, state, and/or other legal rights; caused Plaintiffs bodily injury, pain, suffering, \npsychological and/or emotional injury, and/or humiliation; caused Plaintiffs to expend costs and \nexpenses; and/or otherwise damaged and injured Plaintiffs. \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nMunicipal Liability  \n \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983 and Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978) \nfor Defendants’ Violations of Plaintiffs’ Rights Under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution \nOn behalf of Plaintiffs against Defendant City of New York, Defendant Bill de Blasio, \nDefendant Dermot Shea, and Defendant Terence Monahan \n \n558.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding \nand following paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n82 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00533   Document 1   Filed 01/21/21   Page 83 of 85\n559.  All of the wrongful acts or omissions complained of herein were carried out by the \nindividual named and unnamed police officer defendants pursuant to: (a) formal policies, rules, \nand procedures of Defendant City; (b) actions and decisions by Defendant City’s policymaking \nagents  including,  but  not  limited  to,  Defendant  de  Blasio,  Defendant  Shea,  and  Defendant \nMonahan; (c) customs, practices, and usage of the NYPD that are so widespread and pervasive as \nto  constitute  de  facto  policies  accepted,  encouraged,  condoned,  ratified,  sanctioned,  and/or \nenforced by Defendant City, Defendant de Blasio, Defendant Shea, Defendant Monahan, and other \npolicymaking officials; (d) Defendant City’s deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ rights secured \nby the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, as evidenced \nby the City’s failures, and the failures of the City’s policymaking agents, to train, supervise, and \ndiscipline NYPD officers, despite full knowledge of the officers’ wrongful acts, as described \nherein.  \nDEMANDS FOR RELIEF  \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs demand the following relief against the Defendants: \na.  Enter an order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Rule \n23(b)(2) and (b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in the manner described \nabove herein, with Plaintiffs ADAMA SOW, DAVID JAKLEVIC, ALEXANDRA \nDE MUCHA PINO, OSCAR RIOS, BARBARA ROSS, MATTHEW BREDDER, \nSABRINA  ZURKUHLEN,  MARIA  SALAZAR,  DARA  PLUCHINO,  and \nSAVITRI DURKEE as class representatives; \nb.

Retain jurisdiction in this case until the unlawful conditions, practice, \npolicies, acts and omissions complained of herein no longer exist and this \nCourt is satisfied that they will not recur; \ne.  Award Plaintiffs compensatory and punitive damages in amounts that are \nfair, just and reasonable, to be determined at trial; \nf.
