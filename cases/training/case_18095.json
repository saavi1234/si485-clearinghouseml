    "summary": "<p>Thirteen demonstrators protesting George Floyd's murder filed this lawsuit on July 8, 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against the city of Columbus, Ohio and various law enforcement officers in their official and individual capacities for the alleged use of excessive force. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs brought this suit under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, alleging that police officers used pepper spray and rubber bullets, among other crowd-control methods, without first giving warning to the protestors. The plaintiffs alleged violations of their First Amendment right to assemble and their Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force, as well as state law claims of gross negligence, battery, and malicious prosecution. The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment, injunctive relief enjoining defendants from using similar conduct in the future, compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorneys' fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Algenon Marbley. On September 16, 2020, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding additional individual named plaintiffs and an additional state law claim. Two months later, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction, seeking to enjoin the defendants from using non-lethal force such as tear gas, flash-bang grenades, or batons on nonviolent protestors. On April 30, 2021, Judge Marbley granted the preliminary injunction. 2021 WL 1725554. In a lengthy opinion that began by recounting how \"formal policing took its earliest form in slave patrols,\" Judge Marbley enjoined the defendants from using non-lethal force (including tear gas, flash-bang grenades, rubber bullets, batons, etc.) to disperse nonviolent protestors. Instead, defendants could only use citations or arrests.

The Parties agree that the goals should focus on implementing industry best \npractices or standards; quality assurance for calls and dispatching; steps to achieve \naccreditation through CALEA and/or IAED; training; staff retention and employee \n3 \n\nmorale; and appropriate responses to silent or TTY calls and calls coded “unknown \ntrouble” or with similar codes. One goal will be to assess the actions or inactions ECC \ncall takers and first responders that contributed to the death of Kyle Plush and the \nadequacy of the subsequent measures taken by the City to address those issues. The \ngoals should reflect the City’s commitment to problem solving as the primary public \nsafety strategy including an openness to interdepartmental efforts. As it conducts its \nassessment and to the extent it is consistent with the goals in this Agreement and in \nExhibit  A,  the  Team  shall  serve  as  technical  advisors  and  coaches  making \nrecommendations for improvement in real time to encourage continuous improvement \nat the ECC and police department.   \nb.

The \nrecommendations shall include any and all obstacles to adoption or implementation \nincluding, but not limited to, anticipated costs, legal constraints, funding, or other \nconsiderations. \nThe Team shall ensure that Parties, the Magistrate described below and the QSF \nAdministrator  described  in  Part  D  receive  copies  of  all  its  written  reports  and \nrecommendations. The Team shall provide any supporting material upon request by the \nParties, QSF Administrator or Magistrate.  \ne.  SCOPE OF EXPERT TEAM REVIEW LIMITED.  \nThe Team’s review and recommendations shall be limited to advice for achievement \nof the goals set out in this agreement and in Exhibit A to this Agreement. The Team \nshall not study Fire and EMS call taking, dispatching, and responding unless the City \nrequests consultations in that regard which shall be the subject of a separate contract. \nThe Team will limit its review of police incident codes to calls classified as “unknown \ntrouble” or similar call incident codes as the Team deems appropriate and as is \nconsistent with the goals in Exhibit A and in this agreement.  \n3.  IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS.   \na.  The City shall implement the recommendations of the Team’s Report where legal, \npractical, in the best interest of the people of Cincinnati, and consistent with the goals \nin Exhibit A.  \nb.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the City shall have no \nobligation  to  engage  in  the  creation  of  additional  staff  positions  or  implement \n7 \n\ntechnological  improvements  beyond  routine  upgrades.  In  the  event  that  such  a \nrecommendation is made regarding staffing or technology, the City shall facilitate \nrequesting the additional funds from Council in a timely manner and provide Plaintiffs \nand the Team the opportunity to publicly express their opinions on the recommendation \nand/or appropriation. The Parties further acknowledge that the adoption of some \nrecommendations may have an associated cost which requires an appropriation by City \nCouncil. In the event that the recommendation is consistent with the goals in Exhibit A \nand this agreement and an appropriation is required, the City shall facilitate requesting \nthe additional funds with Council in a timely manner and provide Plaintiffs and the \nTeam the opportunity to publicly express their opinions on the recommendation and/or \nappropriation. In the event that Council declines to appropriate the funds, the City shall \nhave no obligation to adopt the recommendation.   \nNo legal obligation of the City, including collective bargaining agreements, shall be \nviolated by the implementation of any of the Team recommendations. This Agreement \nis intended to be implemented consistent with any relevant bargaining agreement \nprovisions. \nc.  Any objection to a recommendation must be set out in writing with an explanation. Any \ndisagreement between the parties shall be resolved as set out in Part E.  \nd.  The Team shall assist with implementation of its recommendations to the extent that \nassistance is not duplicative of the efforts of City staff. \ne.  The Parties expect that the Team shall be very engaged initially as it frames its \nrecommendations to achieve the goals in Exhibit A and this agreement.  As the Parties \nproceed to implementation of the goals, the Team shall step back as soon as practicable \n8 \n\nand support the ECC and Police staff by only offering evaluation and technical \nassistance.  It is expected that the recommendations will be sufficiently in place and \nthat little action will be needed by the Team in the final year of the agreement. \n4.  REPORTS AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. \n \nEvery six-months, the City shall make a public written report to the QSF Administrator \nregarding the status of implementing the Team’s recommendations. Prior to making such \nreport, the City shall consult with the Team and Plaintiffs to obtain input. At the request of \nany Party or the Team, the City Administration shall facilitate holding a public hearing \nregarding the report. The Parties shall all appear and participate as appropriate in any such \npublic hearing. As it conducts its assessment and thereafter, the Team shall serve as \ntechnical advisors making recommendations for improvement to encourage continuous \nimprovement at the ECC and police department. \nC.  SUBSTITUTION OF PARTIES. After payment of the monetary sum as described below, \nthe Plaintiffs shall dismiss the individual defendants. The City of Cincinnati will remain a party \nfor the purposes of ensuring compliance and enforcing the terms of this agreement. \nD.  QUALIFIED SETTLEMENT FUND.  \n1.  ESTABLISHMENT.  The Parties will join in petitioning the United States District Court \nfor the establishment of a qualified settlement fund (QSF) to hold and disburse funds from \nthe settlement, and to hold and disburse funds for Team fees and expenses.  The QSF shall \nalso assume jurisdiction over the ongoing duties of the parties under this settlement \nagreement and compliance shall be monitored within the QSF.   \n9 \n\n2.  APPOINTMENT. The parties agree to recommend Karen Meyers as QSF administrator. \nThe parties agree to stipulate to the jurisdiction of the United States Magistrate for final \ndetermination of all issues that arise under this settlement agreement.   \n3.  TERMS. The QSF shall be named The Kyle Plush Qualified Settlement Fund. The QSF \nAdministrator shall receive all reports provided to the Magistrate and the public. Upon the \nentry of the order establishing the QSF and funding of the QSF, Plaintiffs shall dismiss the \ncase of Ron Plush et al v. City of Cincinnati, et al, Ham Co. C.P. Ct., CASE NO. A1903752, \nwith prejudice.  The documents establishing a QSF or the terms of any structured settlement \nannuity or similar instrument approved by the Probate Court shall be set forth in a separate \n“Addendum to Settlement Agreement.” Parties agree to cooperate fully, to execute any and \nall supplementary documents (including a qualified assignment), and to take additional \nactions that may be necessary or appropriate to establish said QSF, structured settlement \nannuity which are not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement. \nE.  DISPUTE  RESOLUTION.  In  the  event  that  the  City  does  not  agree  with  any \nrecommendation provided by the Team, the Parties shall confer in good faith and seek to \nresolve the matter within thirty days.  If that is not successful, the issue shall be submitted to a \nqualified, independent mediator for mediation.  If mediation is unsuccessful, the matter will be \nsubmitted  to  the  Magistrate  for  determination.    To  the  extent  that  implementing \nrecommendations requires a Cincinnati City Council appropriation in excess of funds already \nbudgeted, the City shall facilitate requesting the additional funds with Council in a timely \nmanner and provide Plaintiffs and the Team the opportunity to publicly express their opinions \non  the  recommendation  and/or  appropriation.    In  evaluating  the  practicality  of  any \nrecommendation  by  the  Team,  the  Magistrate  shall  order  the  implementation  of  the \n10 \n\nrecommendation only if the Magistrate determines first that the recommendation is consistent \nwith this Agreement and the goals in Exhibit A to this Agreement and also considering whether \nthe recommendation is (i) efficacious, (ii) consistent with national industry standards, (iii) \neconomical when weighing the benefit against the cost; and (iv) in the best interest of the \ncitizens of Cincinnati. \nF.  TERM OF REVIEW.  The term of this agreement shall be five years.  The Team and \nMagistrate shall remain in place performing their functions for five years unless the Parties \nmutually agree otherwise. \nG. MONETARY TERMS.  The City of Cincinnati, on behalf of the Defendants, shall pay six \nmillion dollars to the Plaintiffs as valuable consideration in full and final settlement of all \nclaims and causes of action, as set forth below, including all claims for attorney fees and costs \npayable  under  any  provision  of  law.  Such  payment  is  expressly  conditioned  on  an \nappropriation of the $6 million, as well as the $250,000.00 for the Team, by Cincinnati City \nCouncil. The City shall pay the filing fee for the QSF petition. The Plaintiffs will pay all other \ncosts associated with the QSF administrator.   \nWithin 30 days of the passage of such Ordinance, payment shall be made to the Kyle Plush \nQualified Settlement Fund established in the United States District Court as ordered by said \nCourt.  The Fund shall be paid in a manner that protects the Fund’s ability to fund the qualified \nsettlement fund (QSF), special needs trusts, Medicaid payback pooled trust accounts, and/or \nfund structured settlement annuity contracts, or similar instruments.  All payments are made \non account of personal physical injury under Internal Revenue Code Section 104(a)(2). The \nsource and origin of the claim and monetary payment is the physical injury to and death of \nKyle Plush.  No payments are made on account of punitive damages of any kind.  Defendants \n11 \n\nmake no representations as to the tax consequences of the settlement or of this Agreement.  \nThis Agreement is not contingent upon acceptance by the Internal Revenue Service of the \ncharacterization of the nature of payments as set forth in this Paragraph.  This Agreement is \ncontingent on the approval of the Probate Court of Hamilton County. \nH. RELEASE.  Upon payment to the QSF, THE PLAINTIFFS, individually and on behalf of \nthemselves, the estate of Kyle Plush, and all other children, heirs, administrators, guardians, \nexecutors, and beneficiaries further agree to RELEASE and DISCHARGE THE CITY OF \nCINCINNATI, its directors, employees, agents, partners, and affiliates and the individual \nDEFENDANTS, their agents, spouses, heirs, partners, children, beneficiaries, and affiliates,  \nfrom any and all personal injury, wrongful death, civil rights, medical negligence, loss of \nconsortium or survival claims of any kind or character which they ever had, now have or might \nin the future have against DEFENDANTS, on account of any and all claimed damages, losses, \nor  injuries,  physical,  mental  or  emotional,  known  and  unknown,  either  developed  or \nundeveloped, resulting to or to result from events described in the above lawsuit.

Preliminary Statement   \n  1.  On May 25, 2020, the killing of George Floyd, who was being arrested for \nallegedly passing a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes, by then Minneapolis Police Department \nOfficer Derek Chauvin was live-streamed over the Internet for eight minutes and 46 seconds and \nlater televised around the world. \n2.  Starting on May 28, 2020, in Columbus, Ohio, Plaintiffs, along with hundreds of \nthousands in cities, states, and countries, took to the streets to demonstrate against excessive use \nof force by police, saying the names of Black men and women who had recently been killed by \npolice  or  vigilantes;  chanting  that  “Black  Lives  Matter,”  “No  Justice,  No  Peace,”  “I  can’t \n \n2 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 3 of 147  PAGEID #: 6444\n \nbreathe,” “Hands up, Don’t Shoot,” and “Whose Streets? Our Streets”; and expressing their \noutrage at the militarization of police forces, the disparate impact on minority communities of \nlaw enforcement priorities, and a pattern or practice of governments at all levels tolerating \nsystemic  racism  and  failing  to  adopt  effective  policies  or  implement  adequate  training, \nsupervision, and discipline of law enforcement officers. \n3.  Plaintiffs and other demonstrators in Columbus comprised a multi-racial group, \ninformally brought together by Black community leaders and activists primarily through the use \nof social media and dedicated to nonviolent protest, including civil disobedience of traffic, \nparade, and mass-gathering regulations, to generate urgent widespread public attention to the \nhistoric and continuing police violence directed overwhelmingly at communities and people of \ncolor condoned by mostly White police supervisors and administrators.   \n4.  The goals of Plaintiffs and other demonstrators included engendering serious, \neffective, and immediate actions to bring a halt to the endemic racism infecting America’s law \nenforcement  and  justice  systems  and  the  general  tolerance  of  excessive  force  routinely \nadministered by police officers against arrestees, regardless of innocence or guilt, and especially \nagainst citizens who question an officer’s actions. \n5.  On May 28, 2020, Plaintiffs and other demonstrators in Columbus exercised their \nrights of assembly and expression by gathering downtown. \n6.  Defendants Commander, Lieutenants, Sergeants, and Officers were angered by \nthe  civil  disobedience  they  observed,  the  message  of  the  protests,  and  the  criticisms  and \ndenunciation they heard.   \n7.  Defendants  Commander,  Lieutenants,  Sergeants,  and  Officers  had  received \nminimal and ineffective training from Defendants City and Chief and were subject to vague, \nineffective, and rarely enforced policies regarding the need to handle protesters without using \nforce or using the least amount of non-lethal force necessary.  \n \n3 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 4 of 147  PAGEID #: 6445\n \n8.  Defendants Commander, Lieutenants, Sergeants, and Officers instead responded \nto the protests with excessive use of force, including kettling, pepper spraying, tear gassing, \nsmoke bombs, and assaulting with physical force, sonic cannon, batons, horses, bicycles, and \nrubber and wooden bullets, or bean bag rounds and flash-bang grenades against nonviolent \nprotestors who were standing in the streets, from which vehicular traffic had already been \nblocked and eliminated by police, or on sidewalks, chanting, and holding signs and posing no \nthreat of violence or property destruction, typically without giving audible warnings to their \ntargets, and targeting clearly-identifiable journalists, medical assistants, and legal observers who \nwere there peaceably to assist protestors. \n9.   Defendants Commander, Lieutenants, Sergeants, and Officers either criticized, \noften profanely, the protestors for their chants, signs, and civil disobedience or heard, without \ncommenting, other Officers do so while using excessive force. \n10.  Defendants  Commander,  Lieutenants,  Sergeants,  and  Officers  purposely  used \nexcessive force to punish one or more Plaintiffs and other demonstrators, to deter them from \ncontinuing to protest and others from joining a protest with which they disagreed, and to reclaim \nthe streets. \n11.  Defendants  Commander,  Lieutenants,  Sergeants,  and  Officers  maliciously \nprosecuted one or more Plaintiffs to punish them and deter other demonstrators from continuing \nto protest and some purposely covered their names and badge numbers with tape to avoid being \nidentified when they used excessive force or retaliated for speech they resented. \n12.  Just the month before, Defendants had exercised restraint when demonstrators, \nsome of whom openly carried weapons and engaged in hate speech while violating statewide \nsocial-distancing and mask mandates, protested the COVID-19 lockdown at and around the \nStatehouse. \n \n4 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 5 of 147  PAGEID #: 6446\n \n13.  Despite the excessive use of force earlier on May 28, 2020, the overwhelming \nmajority of the demonstrators remained nonviolent, fled from the toxic chemicals, and left, \nsought medical assistance, or tried to regroup at a safe distance. \n14.  After  Defendants  needlessly  escalated  and  provoked  protestors,  there  were \nsporadic incidents of property destruction or harassment of law enforcement officers by throwing \nobjects, but none of these actions caused serious injury to officers, and none of them was \ncommitted by or reasonably could have been attributed to the Plaintiffs and other nonviolent \ndemonstrators. \n15.  After  Defendants  had  escalated  their  force  against  non-violent  protestors, \ntriggering  property  destruction  by  others,  they  authorized  more  police  and  mutual-aid  law \nenforcement personnel  to  use greater force against the remaining demonstrators, who were \ninjured even though the overwhelming majority of them were not engaged in any violence \ntoward police or property destruction. \n16.  On May 29 and 30, a similar dynamic occurred; a curfew from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 \na.m. was imposed on May 30; and public indignation at the broadcasts on social media and local \nand  national  television  of  the  demonstrations  and  reports  and  pictures  or  video  sent  to \nreportcpd@columbus.gov ultimately convinced the Columbus Mayor, who had initially falsely \ndescribed what had been happening and excused the police use of force, to limit the use of tear \ngas and, on June 1, 2020, denounce excessive force by police officers.  \n17.  Plaintiffs have suffered injuries to their civil rights and their bodies, and they \nreasonably expect to exercise, and are unwilling to refrain from exercising, their fundamental \nrights to assemble, protest, travel, and live freely within and around Columbus in the future.   \n18.  Plaintiffs  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief;  compensatory  damages  for \ninjuries; punitive damages from Defendants Chief, Commander, Lieutenants, Sergeants, and \nOfficers; and attorneys’ fees and costs for violations of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments \nrights  to  be  free  from  excessive  use  of  force  and  malicious  prosecution;  their  First  and \n \n5 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 6 of 147  PAGEID #: 6447\n \nFourteenth  Amendments  rights  to  peaceably  assemble  and  exercise  freedom  of  expression; \nand/or their Ohio common-law right not to be battered or maliciously prosecuted and/or injured \nby the gross negligence of police officers, and/or their Ohio statutory right to recover damages \ninflicted by a criminal act caused by the failure of Defendants City of Columbus and Chief to \nadopt effective policies and adequately train, supervise, and discipline police officers. \nII.  Jurisdiction and Venue \n  19.  This  Court has jurisdiction over this action by virtue of 28 U.S.C. §§  1331 \n(federal question); 1343 (civil rights); and 1367 (supplemental jurisdiction). \n  20.  Declaratory, equitable, and injunctive relief is sought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n2201; 2202; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and the common law of the State of Ohio. \n  21.  Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the statutory and common law of the State of Ohio, \ncompensatory damages may be awarded against all Defendants and punitive damages may be \nawarded against Defendants Chief, Commander, Lieutenants Sergeants, and Officers. \n  22.  Costs and attorneys’ fees may be awarded pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 54, and the common law of the State of Ohio. \n  23.  Venue lies in this forum pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and S.D. Civ. R. 82.1 \nbecause the claims arose in Franklin County, Ohio where Defendant City of Columbus is located \nand operates the Division of Police, headed by Defendant Chief, which empowered Defendants \nChief, Commander, Lieutenants, Sergeants, and Officers to use force. \nIII.

Facts \n  A.  Societal Background \n   \n83.  For years, African-Americans have been the victims of police and vigilante use of \ndeadly excessive force, and Plaintiffs and the other demonstrators have said the victims’ names \nduring their protests. \n84.  Those names include Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old African-American killed in 2015 \nby a Cleveland Police Officer when the child was carrying a pellet gun; Breonna Taylor, an \nAfrican-American Emergency Medical Technician, shot eight times on March 13, 2020, by \nofficers of the Louisville Metro Police Department who were executing a no-knock warrant at \nher residence; Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American teenager, fatally shot in 2014 by a \nFerguson,  Missouri  police  officer;  Eric  Garner,  an  African-American  whose  cry,  “I  can’t \n \n17 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 18 of 147  PAGEID #: 6459\n \nbreathe,” was repeated by George Floyd, fatally choked in 2014 by a New York City police \nofficer who was arresting him for selling loose cigarettes; Philando Castile, an African-American \nelementary school cafeteria worker shot five times during a 2016 traffic stop by a St. Paul, \nMinnesota police officer; and Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery, young African-Americans \nkilled by vigilantes, one of whom was a former police officer. \n85.  Since  the  May  28-June  3,  2020  Columbus  protests,  the  list  has  grown.  \nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/say-their-names-list-people-injured-killed-police-officer-\ninvolved-incidents/ \n86.  While in a handful of cases, discipline had been meted out and prosecutions \npursued, most of the police officers were not disciplined, let alone successfully prosecuted; \nindeed, when George Floyd was killed there had been no police discipline meted out for Breonna \nTaylor’s death. \n87.  The widespread dissemination of the May 25, 2020 video of Officer Chauvin \nkilling George Floyd coupled with the killing of Breonna Taylor and the history reflected in \nthose names, caused an eruption of public revulsion about police use of excessive force on \nAfrican-Americans and other minorities. \n88.  Social media facilitated the scheduling of demonstrations. \n  B.  Defendants’ Preparation for Demonstrations \n89.  Defendants  knew  by  May  26,  2020,  that  demonstrations  would  occur  in \ndowntown Columbus. \n90.  Defendants  knew  that  the  group  Black  Lives  Matter  would  call  for  such \ndemonstrations. \n \n18 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 19 of 147  PAGEID #: 6460\n \n91.  Defendants knew that Black Lives Matter is an organized movement dedicated to \nnon-violent  civil  disobedience  in  protest  of  incidents  of  police  brutality  against  African-\nAmericans, which began in 2013 when activists used the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social \nmedia after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teen \nTrayvon Martin in February 2012, and was nationally recognized for street demonstrations \nfollowing the Brown and Garner deaths. \n92.  Defendants City and Chief monitored social media communications to and from \nBlack Lives Matter and were aware, before the evening of May 28, 2020, that Black Lives \nMatter was encouraging a non-violent protest in Columbus. \n93.  Many of the Plaintiffs and other protestors were affiliated with, identified with, \nand/or inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, dressing in clothing with the group’s name \nor initials, and using chants, such as “Black Lives Matter”; “I Can’t Breathe”; “No Justice, No \nPeace”; and “Hands up, Don’t Shoot,” which were associated with the group. \n94.  Many Columbus Police Officers and their supervisors, along with some mutual-\naid law enforcement personnel, nurse an abiding hatred of the Black Live Matters movement, \nbelieving that it hurts the image of police and despising the movement’s goals and actions \nseeking to limit the prerogative of police to use force in any manner and amount they wish. \n95.  Many Columbus Police Officers and their supervisors, along with some mutual-\naid law enforcement personnel, resent the chant “Black Lives Matter” and prefer “Blue Lives \nMatter” and/or “All Lives Matter,” slogans that dismiss and deny the existence and importance \nof systemic racism in policing. \n96.  Anticipating the Columbus protests, many Columbus police officers and their \nsupervisors,  along  with  some  mutual-aid  law  enforcement  personnel,  decided  to  use  their \n \n19 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 20 of 147  PAGEID #: 6461\n \nassignments  to  exact  revenge  on  the  Black  Lives  Matter  group  and  chill  the  exercise  of \nassociation and freedom of expression by protestors. \n97.  One tactic used by Defendants City and Chief was to have Columbus Police \nOfficers declare that a peaceful, nonviolent protest in the streets of Columbus had become an \nemergency  and  then  order  the  protestors  to  disperse,  using  projectile  weapons  and  caustic \nchemical agents to enforce that order. \n98.  Defendants  City  and  Chief  had  adopted  a  policy,  training  Columbus  Police \nOfficers on that policy, to use that tactic in response to large protests. \n99.  Failure  to  disperse  when  ordered  by  a  law  enforcement  officer  is,  under \nR.C.  2917.04, a minor misdemeanor, unless the order is given in an emergency, when the crime \nbecomes a fourth-degree misdemeanor. \n100.  Under R.C.  2917.04(B), “Nothing in this section requires persons to disperse who \nare peaceably assembled for a lawful purpose.” \n101.  Defendants City and Chief have not emphasized in that policy or training the \nalternative to use of non-lethal force of citing and/or arresting protestors who do not disperse. \n102.  Defendants City and Chief have not emphasized in that policy or training a means \nfor Columbus Police Officers to differentiate peaceable assembly for a lawful purpose from an \nactual emergency. \n103.  Defendant City’s Division of Police has a history of excessive use of force and \nother abuses of their authority in response to nonviolent demonstrations and expressive conduct \nby those with whom police officers and their superiors disagree. \n \n20 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 21 of 147  PAGEID #: 6462\n \n104.  For example, on January 30, 2017, nearly two thousand protestors against the \nMuslim Ban by President Trump came to the Ohio Statehouse and, after a peaceful rally, began \nto march south on High Street to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. \n105.  During the march and upon their arrival, protestors overflowed the sidewalks, \nand, after more protesting, they used the High Street to march back toward the Statehouse. \n106.  Columbus Police Officers then ordered approximately 300 protestors to disperse. \n107.  Pepper  spray  or  mace  was  used  to  disperse  the  protestors  and  gratuitously \nadministered directly in the face and eyes of one or more protestors who were not actively \nresisting arrest. \n108.  On June 17, 2017, when Black Lives Matter became involved with a protest at the \nColumbus Pride Parade, police officers raced to the scene with pepper-spray canisters already \ndrawn. \n109.  Only weeks later, on July 7, 2017, when protestors with disabilities, many of them \nin wheelchairs, peacefully occupied Senator Rob Portman’s Columbus office to urge him to vote \nagainst a federal health care bill supported by President Trump (who is supported publicly and \nprivately by many police officers because he opposes any form of accountability for police \nabuses), Columbus Police Officers arrived at the scene, claiming there was an emergency call for \nassistance,  and  forcibly  arrested  the  peaceful  protestors  using  excessive  force,  including \nknocking over wheelchairs and carrying some protestors with mobility issues out of the building. \n110.  The following year, on July 11, 2018, Stephanie Clifford (also known as Stormy \nDaniels), the adult film star who was paid hush money by President Trump to conceal an affair, \nvisited a Columbus strip club on a publicity tour embarrassing to the President, and several \nColumbus Police Officers targeted Daniels for arrest because of her status as an anti-Trump \n \n21 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 22 of 147  PAGEID #: 6463\n \npolitical symbol and arrested other women working at the club because of their association with \nDaniels and to cover up their retaliatory motive.   \n111.  Social media message board posts among Columbus Police Officers celebrated \nthe arrests as a blow against President Trump’s critics.    \n112.  In contrast, Columbus Police Officers have peacefully monitored protests and \nother  expressive  events  in  downtown  Columbus  with  whose  messages  they  are  neutral  or \nsympathetic,  including  the  recent  protests  by  an  overwhelmingly  White  group  at  the  Ohio \nStatehouse against COVID-19-related closures, where many protestors were armed with rifles \nand carried ammunition, and the intense mass protests and public rallies in 2011 by public \nemployee unions (including their own) against the effort to restrict collective bargaining rights.  \n113.  Despite knowing about this history of Defendant City’s Division of Police and the \nnegative feelings towards Black Lives Matter of its officers and their superiors, Defendants City \nand Chief took no specific precautions against excessive use of force in handling the protests. \n114.  Defendants City and Chief ensured that Columbus Police Officers were armed \nwith batons, pepper spray, tear gas canisters, sonic cannons, smoke bombs or grenades, flash-\nbang grenades, and/or weapons that could shoot rubber and wooden bullets or bean bag rounds. \n115.  Defendants  City  and  Chief  characterized  such  weapons  as  “non-lethal”  and \nencouraged their use as an alternative to Tasers and guns and/or rifles that used regular bullets, \ndespite  knowing  that  these  “non-lethal”  weapons,  while  less  lethal  than  officers’  service \nweapons,  still  have  the  potential  to  cause  death  or  serious  injury,  especially  (though  not \nexclusively) when used without appropriate precautions \n \n22 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 23 of 147  PAGEID #: 6464\n \n116.  The way Columbus Police Officers, Deputies, and mutual-aid law enforcement \npersonnel used such weapons posed a significant risk of serious and harmful bodily injury to \nnonviolent protestors. \n117.  Batons are hard, ergonomic sticks designed to inflict pain and, when applied with \nthe usual force, will break bones and cause concussions and internal bleeding. \n118.  Pepper spray is a chemical compound that irritates the target’s eyes, causing a \nburning sensation, pain, and temporary blindness; inflicts shortness of breath by burning the \ntarget’s lungs; and interferes with breathing by irritating the respiratory system, which, during \nthe protests, was already a concern because of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n119.  Tear gas canisters contain a chemical weapon, colloquially known as mace, which \ncauses severe eye and respiratory pain, skin irritation, bleeding, and blindness.  \n120.  The use of tear gas in warfare is prohibited by international treaties. \n121.  Long-lasting effects of tear gas can include development of respiratory illnesses, \nand the canisters can be delivered with such force that they cause severe bruising, loss of \neyesight, and/or skull or bone fractures. \n122.  Tear gas has also been linked with painful disruptions to the menstrual cycle of \nfemale protestors, including a heavier flow at abnormal intervals with more intense cramping, \nand unexpected spotting by those with IUDs (intrauterine device).  \n123.  Flash-bang  grenades,  which  are  also  known  as  stun  grenades,  are  explosive \ndevices that emit both an extremely loud bang, usually with higher decibels than a jet engine at \nfull throttle, and ultra-bright light to disorient their targets. \n124.  Flash-bang grenades cause temporary blindness and pain to the retina, impaired \nhearing, and/or disruption of the inner-ear fluid and consequent loss of balance. \n \n23 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 24 of 147  PAGEID #: 6465\n \n125.  Rubber bullets, technically kinetic impact projectiles, are hard rubber or rubber-\ncoated projectiles that can be fired at the same velocity as bullets from standard weapons or riot \nguns. \n126.  Rubber  bullets  are  intended  to  cause  pain  without  serious  injury,  but  they \ntypically cause not only contusions, abrasions, and hematomas, but also bone fractures. \n127.  Rubber bullets are not designed to be safely shot point-blank or at a target’s head, \nbut it is well known that law enforcement officers often disregard this instruction. \n128.  Wooden bullets are dowel-shaped rods sliced  into projectiles the size of pill \nbottles to be fired at the same velocity as bullets. \n129.  Like rubber bullets, wooden bullets are intended to cause pain without serious \ninjury, but they typically cause bone fractures as well as contusions, abrasions, and hematomas. \n130.  Wooden bullets can also splinter and infect areas where their targets are hit. \n131.  While wooden bullets are not designed to be safely shot point-blank or at a \ntarget’s head, officers frequently do so anyway. \n132.  Bean bag rounds consist of nylon or other fabric sacks filled with lead shot and \nfired at high speed from 12-gauge shotguns. \n133.  Officers are trained to aim for “green” (thigh or leg) or “yellow” (stomach) zones \nof the body, while avoiding the “red” (face or groin) zone, though they frequently target the \nhead. \n134.  A bean bag round spreads to hit a one square inch area of the target where it is \nintended to cause a muscle spasm; however, the bean bag round often causes a fracture or \nconcussion. \n \n24 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 25 of 147  PAGEID #: 6466\n \n135.  Smoke  bombs,  grenades,  or  canisters  consist  of  a  device  loaded  with  white \nphosphorus and an internal bursting mechanism. \n136.  Smoke bombs, grenades, or canisters are typically thrown indiscriminately into or \nnear a group. \n137.  Upon detonation, a brilliant yellow flame is emitted and produces a large amount \nof white smoke or phosphorus pentoxide. \n138.  A chemical irritant can be added to smoke bombs, grenades, or canisters, though \nthe ones used by Defendants appear to have produced pure smoke. \n139.  The smoke obscures the vision of individuals by creating a fog, irritates eyes, and \naffects the breathing of individuals nearby the deployed smoke bombs, grenades, or canisters.  \n140.  Sonic  cannons,  known  by  the  acronym  LRAD  for  “Long  Range  Acoustic \nDevice,” emit focused soundwaves over a long distance, inflict pain, and can cause permanent or \nlong-term damage to an individual’s hearing. \n141.  A normal conversation level is 60 dB (decibels), a lawn mower averages 90 dB, \nthe pain threshold for the average person is 103 dB, and an LRAD’s maximum continuous \nvolume is 162 dB.   \n142.  Columbus Police Officers were provided protective ear plugs when sonic cannons \nwere used on protestors.   \nC.  Days and Nights of Police and Deputy Rage \n143.  Over the course of the demonstrations on May 28, 29, and 30 and June 1, 2, and 3, \nColumbus  Police  Officers  beat  peaceful  protestors  and  bystanders;  pepper-sprayed  without \nprovocation  and  at  point  blank  range  protestors  and  observers,  including  United  States \nCongresswoman  Joyce  Beatty,  City  Council  President  Shannon  Hardin,  and  County \n \n25 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 26 of 147  PAGEID #: 6467\n \nCommissioner Kevin Boyce; lobbed and/or shot tear gas canisters without provocation; fired \nrubber or wooden bullets and flash-bang grenades directly at vulnerable body areas of protestors, \nas  truly  and  accurately  reflected  in  a  video  posted  at \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&v=vZaoz9ZRVOc&feature=emb_title  and \nshown below; and targeted identified journalists and individuals providing medical assistance. A \ntrue and accurate copy of that video is provided below (double click to play or click the link). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n144.  The targeting of identified journalists was done to eliminate eye-witness reports \nand photographs or videos of police engaging in use of excessive force and retaliating against \nprotestors for the content and urgency of their expression.  \n145.  A tactic used by Defendants is “kettling,” where groups of nonviolent protestors \nare boxed in, typically by using commands, bicycles, horses, and/or lines of police, and moved \nfrom one place to another, even though the protestors were unwilling or, due to other protestors \nor physical barriers, unable to move, and then arresting them for resisting, obstructing, and/or \nfailing to disperse. \n \n26 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 27 of 147  PAGEID #: 6468\n \n146.  Apart from assembling and chanting or holding signs in the middle of streets or \nother  locations  Defendants  wanted  them  to  abandon,  these  groups  of  protestors  were  not \nviolating, as reflected in the true and accurate pictures below, any laws, threatening violence, \ndestroying any property, or hampering traffic. \n \n \n \n27 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 28 of 147  PAGEID #: 6469\n \n \n \n \n147.  Another tactic used by Defendants was collective punishment: responding to any \naction by an isolated individual who threw a water bottle, harassed or taunted an officer, or \nengaged in property destruction by indiscriminately pepper-spraying or tear-gassing a group of \nobviously different protestors who had not engaged in any such conduct. \n148.  The “kettling” and collective punishment created a chaotic situation among the \nprotestors which Defendants then used as an excuse for additional force including using force \nagainst protestors who moved to assist others who had been subjected to excessive force. \n \n28 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 29 of 147  PAGEID #: 6470\n \n149.  Defendant Chief knew that such tactics were being used to provoke demonstrators \nand justify arrests, but he did not intervene to limit their use. \n150.  To the contrary, Defendant Chief excused the targeting of identifiable journalists \nby falsely claiming that they had been difficult to identify and force was used in a fast-moving \nsituation where officers were being assaulted, “pelted with bottles and rocks.” \n151.  The false claims of Defendant Chief to excuse misconduct were intended to be \ntaken  by  Columbus  Police  Officers,  and  were  in  fact  taken,  as  a  form  of  approval  and \ncondonation of their tactics and an invitation to continue and escalate them. \n152.  Photographs and videos taken at the scene demonstrate that journalists, who were \nwearing hats and hoodies bearing the name of their newspaper, were targeted even though \nnothing was being thrown at the police, the protestors were not out of control, and the situation \nwas not fast-moving. \n153.  The way Defendants Commander, Lieutenants, Sergeants, and Officers routinely \npepper-sprayed  demonstrators  who  were  not  engaging  in  violent  behavior  is  accurately \nillustrated by the picture below; a true and accurate depiction of Defendants’ aggressive conduct \nappears in the video posted at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npXL2-NT1Zs, where pepper \nspray was used on small sections of the protestors and one protestor was punched by Defendant \nLucci. A true and accurate copy of that video is provided below (double click to play or click the \nlink): \n \n29 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 30 of 147  PAGEID #: 6471\n \n© Getty   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n154.  Social media contained first-hand accounts of excessive use of force; for example, \nhttps://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1686026474878930&id=1000041478178\n \n30 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 31 of 147  PAGEID #: 6472\n \n93 accurately reported about tear gas on May 30, 2020: “I experienced a traumatic event today. I \nwas participating in a BLM protest with hundreds of other people today in downtown Columbus. We \nwere yelling chants & marching around the statehouse on the sidewalks but nothing more as we were \ntold this would be a peaceful demonstration.  Then bike cops show up. All of them had gas masks on. \nPeople started getting uneasy.  A SWAT truck drives by, yelling people to stay off the road. But \nother than people crossing on the crosswalk, no one was on the streets nor blocking the traffic.  More \ncops on horseback show up.  People starts murmuring.  More police cars show up & park in the \nmiddle of a busy street. Police officers start unloading and gearing up.  People were yelling ‘what are \nyou doing? We’re not doing anything wrong!’  First rounds of tear gas goes off in the crosswalk area. \nPeople start screaming and yelling others to run. People were coughing and crying from the effects of \nthe gas (there were children & seniors in the group). People were handing out water to those who \nneeded to rinse their face.  Another round of gas goes off. This time, ON THE SIDEWALK. Not on \nthe roads, but directly on the sidewalk. People were running, jumping over the fence, falling on the \nground & running for their lives. This is when my friend and I were impacted and we had to rinse our \nfaces off with water for several minutes. We decided that it was getting too dangerous and left \nshortly afterwards.  We weren’t attacking the police. We weren’t vandalizing/looting any properties.  \nNo protester had weapons on them.  So tell me, why did we get maced?” \n155.  Corroborating  that  report  is  a  video  housed  at \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=30&v=AswhNfIjqG4&feature=emb_title, \naccurately showing the tear-gassing of a group of protestors and police on horseback moving the \nprotestors.

Reflecting the animus toward medical helpers are two accurate videotapes of \nColumbus Police Officers on May 30, 2020, chasing a clearly-marked medic down an alley \nwhere  she  had  gone  to  help  a  protestor;  the  first  posted  on  Twitter,  (1) \nhttps://twitter.com/OncoKaty/status/1266816739444166656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp\n%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1266873339542470656&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.col\numbusnavigator.com%2Fcolumbus-police-protests%2F  by  Katy@OncoKaty  asks,  “Tell  me, \n@ColumbusPolice what part of this is protect or serve?

The  true  and  accurate  copy  of  the  picture  below,  which  was  posted  by \nKRobPhoto, gives a sense of how Columbus Police Officers used pepper spray to punish, here \non May 30, 2020, walking up to a protester and spraying her in the face for being on South High \nStreet while Congresswoman Beatty was nearby:  \n \n34 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 35 of 147  PAGEID #: 6476\n \n \n \n159.  Columbus Police Officers pushing and pepper spraying protestors on the other \nside  of  a  barrier  on  May  28,  2020,  is  accurately  depicted  at \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=26&v=npXL2-NT1Zs&feature=emb_title.

The earlier portion of the nonviolent protests on May 28, 2020, is accurately \ndepicted in the video at https://youtu.be/AB6LmkmLnUI which shows peaceful protestors sitting \nin the middle of a street when a phalanx of Columbus Police Officers on bicycles suddenly and \nwithout warning pepper spray them.

On May 29, 2020, Columbus Police Officers walked their bicycles, used them to \nblock off a group of protestors, and then pepper-sprayed protestors, as accurately depicted on the \n \n36 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 37 of 147  PAGEID #: 6478\n \nvideo at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thjbZhftL_A. A true and accurate copy of that video \nis provided below (double click to play or click the link). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n162.  In addition to the injuries described below that each Plaintiff suffered from being \nmistreated by Columbus Police Officers, all plaintiffs suffered fear, frustration, anger, emotional \ndistress, and/or humiliation, as a proximate cause of being mistreated. \nD.  Defendants  City  and  Chief  Knew  of  the  Need  for  Effective  Training, \nSupervision,  and  Discipline  to  Curb  Police  Use  of  Excessive  Force  and \nRetaliation for Associations or Expression Officers Hated. \n \n163.  According  to  the  police  tracking  website  https://mappingpoliceviolence.org, \nduring the years 2013 through 2019, Columbus Police Officers killed at a rate of 7.3 per 100,000 \nresidents, which was the highest rate of any department in the State of Ohio and more than \ndouble the rate in Cleveland, Ohio. \n164.  During  that  period,  Columbus  Police  Officers  killed  27  African-Americans, \nincluding  in  2016  Henry  Green,  age  23,  who  was  killed  by  plainclothes  officer  in  the \npredominantly Black neighborhood of South Linden, and three months later, 13-year-old Tyre \nKing. \n \n37 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 38 of 147  PAGEID #: 6479\n \n165.  African-Americans make up 28% of the population of the City of Columbus, but \nduring that period constituted half (varying between 49% and 53% since 2013) of the use-of-\nforce incidents. \n166.  Defendants City and Chief were aware of these statistics and, while claiming to \nbelieve that most of the individual uses of force were justified, still knew Columbus Police \nOfficers were engaging in a troubling pattern of mistreating African-Americans. \n167.  Despite this knowledge, Defendants City and Chief did not take specific steps to \naddress what appeared to be mistreatment of African-Americans. \n168.  In order to become a Columbus Police Officer, applicants need only have a high \nschool diploma or GED, be 20 years of age or older, have a valid driver’s license, and be a U.S. \ncitizen. \n169.  Upon hire, Columbus Police Officers receive an initial salary of $58,947.20 per \nyear, which steadily increases over their first four years of service, with officers who have \nworked for the Division for more than 48 months receiving an annual salary of $90,230.40.  \n170.  In addition to their salary, Columbus Police Officers receive a generous benefits \npackage which includes paid training, college tuition reimbursement, life insurance, individual \nand family health insurance, vision and dental plans, and a significant pension package through \nthe Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund. \n171.  In addition to pay and benefits, Columbus Police Officers have the option to \nprovide security and traffic control services, usually referred to as “special duty pay,” at the rate \nof $54.00 per hour, which services are a condition for a parade permit and outdoor events and are \ntypically provided by Columbus Police Officers. \n \n38 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 39 of 147  PAGEID #: 6480\n \n172.  The training received by Columbus Police Officers is based on the notion that \nbeing a police officer is an extremely dangerous profession, and stresses their security and safety \nabove all else, especially their ability to use force whenever they feel threatened or perceive a \nthreat to another. \n173.  Although being an actual patrol officer is a relatively dangerous profession, with \naverage deaths of 13.7 per 100,000 employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it is \nnowhere nearly as dangerous as common occupations such as roofers (51.5), farmers (24.7). \ntruck drivers (26.0), and groundskeepers (18.6); indeed, with fatal injuries in the amount of 44.3 \nper 100,000, trash and recycling collectors’ jobs are more than three times as dangerous as a \npatrol officer’s job. \n174.  A reliable 2020 study demonstrates that only 4% of a police officer’s time is \ngenerally spent on handling violent crime.  https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/upshot/unrest-\npolice-time-violent-crime.html   \n175.  Defendant City has resisted appointing a civilian review board for police officer \nactivities; instead, all citizen complaints against officers are handled by the Columbus Police \nDivision’s Internal Affairs Bureau. \n176.  The Internal Affairs Bureau routinely dismisses citizen complaints against its \nofficers as unfounded, almost always believing the statements of officers over that of citizens.  \n177.  The  Internal  Affairs  Bureau  is  motivated  to  dismiss  citizen  complaints  as \nunfounded because finding against the Officer or Officers might subject the City to civil liability. \n178.  Even  when  citizen  complaints  of  violence  are  sustained,  over  the  years  the \nColumbus Police Division has meted out disproportionately minor discipline for violent acts, \nsuch as written reprimand and short suspensions.   \n \n39 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 40 of 147  PAGEID #: 6481\n \n179.  In turn, this custom of failing to discipline establishes standards which the union \nfor Columbus Police Officers invoke to persuade arbitrators to reverse serious discipline as \ninconstant with past disciplinary standards. \n180.  Defendants City and Chief know that it is nearly impossible to fire a Columbus \nPolice Officer for use of excessive force.   \n181.  Per  their  union  contract  with  Defendant  City,  Columbus  Police  Officers  are \nindemnified for any damages (except punitive damages) awarded due to a claim of excessive \nforce, and Defendant City provides free legal representation to officers accused of excessive \nforce.   \n182.  Defendants City and Chief knew before the demonstrations which started on May \n28,  2020,  that  Columbus  Police  Officers  faced  little  or  no  disincentive  from  engaging  in \nexcessive use of force and regularly failed to comply with the letter or spirit of training and \npolicies on use of force, handling demonstrations, and retaliating for speech they hated. \n183.  Within the Columbus Division of Police, it is an unspoken rule that, regardless of \nwhatever violent acts a police officer may witness another officer doing, criminal charges will \nnot be brought against that officer. \n184.  In the City of Columbus, misdemeanor offenses are prosecuted by the Columbus \nCity Attorney, and felony offenses are prosecuted by the Franklin County Prosecutor’s Office. \n185.  Both the Columbus City Attorney’s Office and the Franklin County Prosecutor’s \nOffice have an unwritten rule or custom that no criminal charges are to be brought against police \nofficers for acts of violence committed against citizens while in uniform.  \n186.  This  unwritten rule or  custom applies regardless  of the egregiousness of the \noffense or the strength of the evidence of the officer committing the offenses and reflects, among \n \n40 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 41 of 147  PAGEID #: 6482\n \nother pressures, a conflict of interest that prosecutors have with relying on police witnesses to \nprosecute other crimes and not wanting to antagonize them by prosecuting their crimes; the \nperceived political power of police unions and elected status of the City Attorney and Franklin \nCounty Prosecutor; and the barriers victims of acts of violence by police officers confront in \nreaching grand jurors and, if they have any criminal record or suspicious conduct, persuading \ntrial jurors.  \n187.  Incidents of violence which would cause a regular citizen to be charged with \nassault, battery, or other crimes of violence are not charged against police officers for the sole \nreason that they are police officers.   \n188.  It is common knowledge among Columbus Police Officers that, with the possible \nexception of deadly violence videotaped by citizens, they are immune from any prosecution for \nacts of violence committed within the City of Columbus. \n189.  The combination of a toothless disciplinary policy, indemnification from civil \nliability, and practical immunity from criminal prosecution, creates a perfect storm in which \nColumbus Police Officers know that there will nearly always be no repercussions to them for \nviolent acts.   \n190.  With regard to all but one recent police killing (a shooting of a White woman by \nan  African-American  officer),  the  Columbus  Division  of  Police  did  not  issue  significant \ndiscipline for any of the officers involved, and no criminal  charges were filed  against  the \nofficers. \n191.  For example, in April of 2017, one of the officers who shot Henry Green, Officer \nZachary Rosen, was caught on videotape stomping on the head of a handcuffed and helpless \nAfrican-American suspect who was lying on the sidewalk.   \n \n41 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 42 of 147  PAGEID #: 6483\n \n192.  Despite the fact that Officer Rosen had plainly committed an act of felonious \nassault that could have killed or grievously injured the suspect, the Columbus City Attorney’s \nOffice  and  Franklin  County  Prosecutor’s  office  declined  to  bring  criminal  charges  against \nOfficer Rosen solely because of the fact he was a police officer.   \n193.  On June 14, 2017, then-Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs determined that an \nappropriate punishment for Officer Rosen stomping on the head of a helpless individual was a \n24-hour suspension and recommended this punishment to Columbus Public Safety Director Ned \nPettus.   \n194.  In July of 2017, Public Safety Director Pettus rejected the recommendation of \nChief Jacobs and terminated Officer Rosen’s employment.   \n195.  Infuriated that one of their members had been terminated for kicking a helpless \nAfrican-American suspect in the head, the Columbus Fraternal Order of Police (“FOP”) Lodge \nNo. 9 unanimously approved a no-confidence vote in Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther, Public \nSafety Director Pettus, and then-City Council President Zach Klein. \n196.  In announcing the no-confidence vote, FOP President Jason Pappas stated: “We \nwant to send the message that we’ve lost faith. It demonstrates to those individuals that we no \nlonger have confidence in their ability to lead. Unless they make significant changes by funding \nus and staffing us and supporting our officers who are out there day in and day out, that we will \nnot have confidence in their ability to lead us or this city.” \n197.  In March 2018, an arbitrator rescinded Safety Director Pettus’s termination and \nreinstated Officer Rosen to his patrol officer position with full back pay.   \n198.  In May 2018, Defendant City paid a $30,000.00 settlement to the individual \nwhose head Officer Rosen had stomped on.   \n \n42 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 43 of 147  PAGEID #: 6484\n \n199.  This  settlement  came  from  public  tax  dollars,  not  from  Officer  Rosen,  and \nDefendant City provided free legal representation to Officer Rosen throughout the process.   \n200.  To eliminate the pattern or practice of excessive use of force and retaliating for \nspeech they hated by Defendant City Police Officers, structural reform, modified policies, and \ncivilian monitoring should, in addition to other policies and practices that may be deemed \nnecessary after further discovery of the facts, include: \na.  Creation of a civilian review board empowered, funded, and staffed to \nreceive complaints from individuals who believe they have been the victims of \nexcessive use of force and/or retaliation for their speech; to investigate those \ncomplaints; and to recommend discipline which the Director of the Department of \nPublic Safety must mete out absent clear and convincing evidence that the Board \nbased the recommendation on inaccurate facts. \nb.  Prohibition of the use by Defendant City Division of Police and/or mutual \naid law enforcement personnel cooperating with the Division of tear gas, rubber \nor wooden bullets, sonic cannons, bean bag rounds, smoke bombs, grenades, or \ncannisters, pepper spray, flashbang grenades, kettling, chokeholds, strangleholds, \nno-knock warrants, and pressure or weight on the neck, back, or hip of a prone \nsuspect. \nc.  Maintenance of body and vehicle cameras in good working order and use \nof those cameras during any interaction with a civilian. \nd.  Prominent display of badge numbers and/or identity cards whenever a \npolice officer interacts with the public. \n \n43 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 44 of 147  PAGEID #: 6485\n \ne.  Recognition  that  individuals  legitimating  displaying  “press,”  “media,” \n“reporter,”  “paramedic,”  “medic,”  “legal  observer,”  or  similar  words  and/or \nsymbols are permitted to be present in a position enabling them to observe and \nrecord at protests and/or to intervene to assist individuals who appear to have \nbeen injured and that all individuals, regardless of their occupation or non-violent \nactivity, are permitted to record at protests or whenever an police officer interacts \nwith the public. \nf.  Commitment to affirmative action in recruitment, selection, retention, and \npromotion to ensure that, at all ranks, minority officers have more than a token \npresence. \ng.  Training and adoption of policies on the use of batons, Tasers, firearms, \nand physical force that emphasize use of the least force necessary and then only \nafter de-escalation and disengagement have been attempted, a clearly understood \noral warning given, and a purpose other than punishing the target exists, with \ndeadly force as the very last resort after other efforts to prevent serious bodily \ninjury or death have been exhausted, and, unless imminent serious bodily injury \nor death is reasonably perceived, never to prevent flight or property damage, and \nexpose how stereotyping, implicit bias, and racism affect an officer’s perception \nof an individual and the level of threat that individual poses. \nh.  Contracting  with  and/or  employing  unarmed  intervention  specialists \nrequired to be used in responding to calls involving intoxication, drug use or \nabuse, mental health crises, teenagers or children, vandalism, and/or the homeless. \n \n44 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 45 of 147  PAGEID #: 6486\n \ni.  Mandating that (i) any officer who witnesses what he or she believes in \ngood faith to be an excessive use of force or retaliation must stop or attempt to \nstop another officer from that use of force or retaliation and report in detail within \n24 hours that conduct to both the Division Chief and the Internal Affairs Bureau, \nand explain what steps the officer took to intervene in use of force or retaliation; \nand that (ii) any officer who uses force must prepare and file with superiors an \nincident report within eight hours detailing the amount of force used, his or her \nperception of the justification for that force to be used, the known or suspected \ninjury to the suspect, the witnesses to that use of force, and any recordings from \nbody and vehicle cameras, cell telephones, and/or other surveillance cameras. \nj.  Inventory  of  Division  equipment,  assessing  which  equipment  is  more \nappropriate  for  use  by  the  military  during  war  than  by  police  officers,  and \ndiscarding such equipment. \nk.  Screening applicants to determine whether they have been suspected of \nusing excessive force in employment, military, and/or social settings and either \naffirmatively ensure that the suspicion was unfounded or reject the applicant, and \nre-screen officers every three years for psychological fitness. \nl.  Documenting each suspected use of excessive force by an officer; placing \na copy of the suspicion, investigation, and resolution in the officer’s file and \npreserving for ten years in a separate file the original or an electronic counterpart \nalong with exhibits, drawings, recordings, and other evidence; making the entire \nfile available to the Civilian Review Board and any prospective employer; and \n \n45 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 46 of 147  PAGEID #: 6487\n \nconsidering the entire file in making retention, assignment, and/or promotion \ndecisions. \nm.  Engaging in focused deterrence of serious crime by analyzing the specific \nblocks in neighborhoods and known individuals who have engaged in criminal \nactivity  and  can  reasonably  be  anticipated  to  do  so  again  and  allocating \nenforcement priority and referrals for social services accordingly.  \nn.  Scheduling meetings in predominantly minority neighborhoods to listen to \ncivilian concerns; to acknowledge that past law enforcement practices, starting \nwith the roots of modern policing in Southern States as slave patrols and later the \nenforcement  of  Jim  Crow  segregation,  proceeding  through  acquiescence  in \nlynching, racist mobs, and/or Ku Klux Klan activities, and culminating in the \ndisproportionate focus on minorities in the war on drug use and abuse and related \ntraffic stops, have created a rift which must be healed; and to discuss steps which \nmight contribute to that healing. \no.  Payment for individual officers to have professional liability insurance but \nthen requiring an officer to pay any premium increase attributed to that officer’s \nimproper use of force and/or retaliation and conditioning continued employment \non being insured. \np.  Appoint and pay for the employment of an independent monitor to oversee \nand ensure the successful implementation of the above steps. \n  E.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Tamara K. Alsaada \n \n46 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 47 of 147  PAGEID #: 6488\n \n201.  On May 30, 2020, Ms. Alsaada, in her position as Organizing Director for the \nPeople’s Justice Project, showed up to a Black Lives Matter rally organized in front of the Ohio \nStatehouse with the goal of helping to lead the rally and to advocate for police reform. \n202.  Ms. Alsaada did not plan the event; however, given her role in the community she \nwas looked at to help provide a voice for the event.   \n203.  While  Ms.  Alsaada  and  other  members  of  the  People’s  Justice  Project  were \nspeaking on the microphone, protestors at the rally came to Ms. Alsaada and informed her that \nprotestors were being arrested by Columbus Police Officers without justification. \n204.  Again, due to her role as a respected community organizer, even serving on \nMayor Ginther’s Community Safety Advisory Commission, Ms. Alsaada and others walked over \nto the intersection of Broad and High to help resolve any pending conflicts.  \n205.  Ms. Alsaada saw Deputy Chief Michael Woods standing near the intersection, \nwho she knew from her time on the Mayor’s Community Safety Advisory Commission.  \n206.  Ms. Alsaada noticed there were lines of police officers at the intersection on \nbicycles, on horseback, and in riot gear.  \n207.  Ms. Alsaada asked Deputy Chief Woods who was being arrested, and he informed \nher that no one was being arrested.  \n208.  Ms. Alsaada asked Deputy Chief Woods to have the officers clear a path so that \nshe could walk through and continue to address the topic of arrestees, and he subsequently had \nthe officers allow her through.  \n209.  As Ms. Alsaada and others walked through the line of officers in order to continue \npeacefully  discussing  any  arrestees,  Columbus  Police  Officers  without  notice,  without  any \n \n47 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 48 of 147  PAGEID #: 6489\n \nwarning,  and  without  any  provocation,  began  to  assault  Ms.  Alsaada  and  others  with  an \nonslaught of pepper spray. \n210.  Ms. Alsaada fell to the ground due to the assault and was unable to breathe or see. \n211.  Ms.  Alsaada  was  carried  to  the  corner  of  Broad  and  High  where  she  was \nadministered medical attention by volunteer medics.  \n212.  Ms.  Alsaada  and  numerous  others  suffered  injuries  and  trauma  due  to  the \nunprovoked assault by Columbus Police Officers.  \nF.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Mahir Ali \n213.  On May 30, 2020, Mr. Ali was peacefully protesting police brutality and racial \ninjustice in Downtown Columbus, near the intersection of Cleveland Avenue and Broad Street.   \n214.  As  Mr.  Ali  was  involved  in  the  peaceful  protest,  Columbus  Police  Officers \nformed a line and began moving towards Mr. Ali and other protestors. \n215.  A Columbus Police Officer singled out and targeted Mr. Ali by approaching him \nand attempting to pepper spray him. \n216.  Mr. Ali was able to evade most of the pepper spray and, as he did, he yelled out, \n“Hands up! Don’t shoot!”, repeatedly in an attempt to avoid becoming the victim of any police \nbrutality. \n217.  Mr.  Ali  then  noticed  one  Columbus  Police  Officer,  who  appeared  to  be  a \nsupervisor  or  commanding  officer,  later  identified  as  Defendant  Lieutenant  Lowell  Rector \n(“Defendant Lt. Rector”), instruct another officer to shoot Mr. Ali.  \n218.  That officer then aimed at Mr. Ali and shot him in the left leg with a rubber bullet. \n219.  After getting shot, Mr. Ali was able to gather himself and found a parked car that \nhe then used to shield and protect him from the Columbus Police Officers who had targeted him. \n \n48 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 49 of 147  PAGEID #: 6490\n \n220.   While hiding behind this parked car, Mr. Ali witnessed Columbus Police Officers \nshoot two other peaceful protestors, a male and a female, who happened to be riding bikes. \n221.  Mr. Ali continued to hide and protect himself while he witnessed Columbus \nPolice Officers attack other protestors, as the uses of force, chemical agents, and less lethal \nmunitions had been authorized and directed by Defendant Lt. Rector.  \n222.  Mr. Ali was able to call his wife and, after approximately 15 minutes, Mr. Ali’s \nwife was able to locate and rescue him.  \n223.  Mr. Ali then went home and attempted to treat his bruises and muscle aches.  \nG.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Mary Barczak \n224.  On May 30, 2020, Ms. Barczak went downtown to photograph the protests. \n225.  Between 6:30 and 7:00pm, Ms. Barczak was walking with a group of protestors \nnear the intersection of East Broad and 5th Streets. \n226.  The streets were not closed to vehicular traffic, and protestors were in the street \nalong with Columbus Police Officers. \n227.   Vehicles were becoming trapped by the crowd and officers in the street, and Ms. \nBarczak noticed that Columbus Police Officers nearby were not doing anything to direct traffic. \n228.  Ms. Barczak and another protestor alerted the crowd of protestors to the vehicles \ntrying to get through and were successful in getting the protestors to move to the side in two \ngroups to allow the vehicles to pass. \n229.  During this time, Ms. Barczak approached a group of Columbus Police Officers \non bikes and asked them to direct traffic. \n230.  Ms.  Barczak’s  request  was  ignored  by  the  officers,  and  she  ended  up  being \nshoved by the bike officers up onto the sidewalk. \n \n49 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 50 of 147  PAGEID #: 6491\n \n231.  While on the sidewalk, Ms. Barczak noticed a vehicle was again trapped in a \ncrowd and had turned towards the officers; she attempted to tell the driver to “get out of here” as \nhe  was  apparently  confused  and  was  turning  directly  behind  the  line  of  Columbus  Police \nOfficers. \n232.  Ms. Barczak witnessed Columbus Police Officers pull the driver out of the car to \narrest him. \n233.  Ms. Barczak went over to the Columbus Police Officers to tell them that they \nneeded to direct traffic and that the individual in the car was an innocent bystander who was \nmerely confused because of the lack of traffic regulation,  but  when she approached them, \nDefendant Lieutenant Duane Mabry (“Defendant Lt. Mabry”) ordered Ms. Barczak to “get out of \nhere.” \n234.  At this time, the officers already had the driver of the car in handcuffs and \nappeared to be finished arresting him as Ms. Barczak approached. \n235.  Ms. Barczak immediately turned the opposite direction of Defendant Lt. Mabry \nand the arrested individual to leave the area so as to comply with this order. \n236.  However, when Ms. Barczak turned and began walking to leave the area, her path \nwas blocked by the officers’ bikes, as Defendant Lt. Mabry ordered she be arrested. \n237.  A bike officer used his bike to strike Ms. Barczak as she was attempting to leave \nthe area. \n238.  She was then shoved by an officer at hip-level with his bike. \n239.  Yet another officer grabbed Ms. Barczak’s left arm from behind and used his leg \nto attempt to trip her and knock her to the ground. \n \n50 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 51 of 147  PAGEID #: 6492\n \n240.  At the same time, another officer ran up behind Ms. Barczak and grabbed her by \nher shoulders. \n241.  After being shoved,  grabbed, and tripped, Ms. Barczak started  falling  to  the \nground and put her arm out in an automatic effort to brace herself.  \n242.   All three officers then forcefully pushed her down on the pavement, one keeping \nhis palm on her face while he shoved her downwards. \n243.  Ms. Barczak landed back-first and hit the street pavement with such force that her \nhead bounced off of the ground and her glasses were broken during the takedown. \n244.  While  on  the  ground  lying  on  her  stomach,  one  of  the  bike  officers  began \npunching her in the face with a closed fist strike. \n245.  Another bike officer joined in punching Ms. Barczak in the face with a closed fist \nstrike. \n246.  The two officers who punched Ms. Barczak in the face were later identified as \nDefendant Officers Shawn Dye and Gary Patterson, and the third arresting officer was identified \nas Defendant Sergeant Paul Szabo. \n247.  Ms. Barczak remained on the ground as it became evident that she was tangled up \nin her camera bag and photo strap, preventing her from being able to freely give her arms to the \nofficers for cuffing purposes. \n248.  As such, Defendant Sergeant Szabo forcefully pulled back both of her thumbs to \nput zip ties on her wrists, dislocating her thumb in the process. \n249.  Defendant Officer Dye then grabbed Ms. Barczak by her hair, yanked her head \nback, and maced her point blank in the face with a Mark-9 chemical spray canister; at this point, \nMs. Barczak was in zip tie cuffs on the ground. \n \n51 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 52 of 147  PAGEID #: 6493\n \n250.  Ms. Barczak was then taken to a prisoner transport van while she repeatedly asked \nofficers for her inhaler, as she has a serious lung condition that requires use of an inhaler; she \nalso requested hospital transport. \n251.  Ms. Barczak was told by one of the officers, “if you get into the van and tell us \nyour name, then we will give it to you.” \n252.  Eventually, after approximately fifteen to twenty minutes had elapsed since her \nrepeated requests, she was provided with her inhaler, examined by EMTs at a secondary staging \nlocation, and transported to the Franklin County Jail, despite Ms. Barczak’s requests to be taken \nto the hospital. \n253.  Within  thirty  minutes  of  her  arrest,  Defendant  Sergeant  Caroline  Castro \n(“Defendant Sgt. Castro”) conducted an ad hoc administrative investigation on the scene by \ninterviewing Ms. Barczak and Defendant Officers Dye and Patterson; Defendant Sgt. Szabo; and \nincluding Defendant Sgt. Castro’s own witness statement where she noted that she interviewed \nMs. Barczak immediately following her arrest. \n254.  During this investigation, Defendant Officers Dye, Patterson, and Defendant Sgt. \nSzabo knowingly made false statements about Ms. Barczak’s conduct leading up to and during \nher arrest. \n255.  Specifically, Defendant Sgt. Szabo falsely reported that Ms. Barczak “refused to \ncomply with Lt. Mabry’s lawful order” when, in reality, Ms. Barczak immediately attempted to \ncomply when her path was blocked by the bike officers. \n256.  Defendant Officers Dye and Patterson admitted to each striking Ms. Barczak in \nthe head with a closed fist. \n \n52 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 53 of 147  PAGEID #: 6494\n \n257.  Defendant Officer Dye further admitted to using his Mark-9 canister “near” Ms. \nBarczak’s face. \n258.  Based  on  the  false  statements  given  during  the  administrative  investigation, \nDefendant Sgt. Castro found the Defendant Officers’ and Sergeant’s use of force against Ms. \nBarczak to be within Division policy on July 2, 2020. \n259.  While at the Jail, Ms. Barczak was examined by a nurse who opined that her \nthumb was likely broken and recommended Ms. Barczak be transported to the hospital. \n260.  Rather than transport Ms. Barczak to the hospital, she was taken to a holding cell \nand eventually released, where she had to walk to the hospital, as her cell phone was not among \nher returned items. \n261.  On the probable cause affidavit for her arrest, Defendant Officer Dye falsely \nreported  that  Ms.  Barczak  engaged  in  “disorderly  conduct,”  damaged  personal  and  public \nproperty, blocked public streets, and assaulted him “by punching him in the left ear.” \n262.  Upon release from the Jail, Ms. Barczak received a summons charging her with \n“aggravated riot,” a felony of the fifth degree. \n263.  A  true  and  accurate  depiction  of  Ms.  Barczak’s  arrest  on  May  30,  2020  is \nreflected on the linked video (click this link to play). \n264.  Ms. Barczak thereafter took herself to the emergency room, was diagnosed with a \nthumb sprain, head injury, and post-concussion syndrome, and later learned that the tendons in \nher thumb were torn. \n265.  In addition to her dislocated thumb and its torn tendons, Ms. Barczak suffered \nfrom bruising, bleeding, scrapes and cuts to her face, arms, and legs as a proximate result of her \n \n53 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 54 of 147  PAGEID #: 6495\n \narrest and excessive force used on her by Defendant Officers Dye and Patterson and Defendant \nSgt. Szabo. \n266.  Ms. Barczak’s charges were dismissed on June 3, 2020. \n267.  Ms. Barczak continues to suffer from the injury to her right thumb, which is her \ndominant hand, is currently receiving physical therapy and treatment for her diagnosis of Post-\nTraumatic Stress Disorder as a result of this incident. \nH.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Demetrius Burke   \n268.  On Wednesday, June 3, 2020, late at night, Mr. Burke was inside his apartment \nnear the intersection of East Starr Avenue and North 9th Street when he heard sirens and a \ncommotion outside.   \n269.  Mr. Burke’s motorcycle was then parked in his apartment complex’s parking lot. \n270.  Because he was concerned that whatever was  going on outside would cause \ndamage to his motorcycle, Mr. Burke went outside to get his motorcycle and move it to a garage \nprovided by his apartment complex. \n271.  When he reached his motorcycle, Mr. Burke observed police officers walking \nnorth on North 9th Street and decided to ask the officers what was going on.   \n272.  Because he is an African-American male, Mr. Burke was concerned that the \npolice would act violently towards him and so he turned on his cellphone camera and filmed as \nhe approached the officers.   \n273.  Mr. Burke was aware that the City of Columbus had imposed a 10:00 p.m. curfew \non all residents in public areas and so he was careful to remain on his own property and not step \ninto the street while approaching the Columbus Police Officers.   \n \n54 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 55 of 147  PAGEID #: 6496\n \n274.  Mr. Burke’s cellphone video clearly shows that he remained on the grass at all \ntimes and did not enter the street. \n275.  Below is a true and accurate copy of that video (double click to play or click \n20200603_003718.mp4). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n276.  When he was within speaking distance of the Columbus Police Officers, Mr. \nBurke asked, “What’s happening”?  \n277.  An unknown male Columbus Police Officer approached Mr. Burke and answered, \n“I’m sure you know you’re out after curfew, right?” \n \n55 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 56 of 147  PAGEID #: 6497\n \n278.  Mr. Burke responded, “I live right here, I’m on my property.” \n279.  The unknown officer then said, “You’re standing on the street, come here.”   \n280.  Mr. Burke protested that he was “right here, I’m on the grass.”   \n281.  The unknown male officer then stated that “it doesn’t matter, you’re under arrest” \nand falsely told another officer, later identified as Defendant Officer Amber Rich, that Mr. Burke \nwas standing in the street. \n282.  Defendant Officer Rich then used a zip tie to restrain Mr. Burke’s hands behind \nhis back. \n283.  Defendant Officer Rich then swore to and signed a probable cause affidavit for \nMr. Burke’s arrest, knowing its contents were false and that his arrest lacked probable cause. \n284.  Defendant Officer Kenneth Kirby then signed and notarized the probable cause \naffidavit to cause criminal charges to be filed against Mr. Burke, knowing its contents were false \nand that his arrest lacked probable cause. \n285.  Mr. Burke was then transported to a nearby fire station being used to process \nindividuals who had been arrested during the George Floyd protests.   \n286.  From the fire station, Mr. Burke was taken to the Jackson Pike Correctional \nCenter, where he was placed in a cell with other arrested individuals.   \n287.  In the cell where Mr. Burke was detained, there were many individuals who had \nbeen arrested for issues not related to the protest, including felonies and violent crimes.  \n288.   During his time in the cell, Mr. Burke witnessed an intensely violent fight, which \nwas terrifying and put him at risk of physical harm.   \n289.  Mr. Burke remained in the cell until early afternoon when his friend posted bail \nfor him.   \n \n56 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 57 of 147  PAGEID #: 6498\n \n290.  On Tuesday, June 9, 2020, Mr. Burke’s curfew violation charges were dismissed \nas part of the blanket dismissal of curfew violations. \nI.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Bernadette Calvey \n291.  On May 30, 2020, Ms. Calvey was in the Short North area, accompanied by a \nroommate. \n292.  Although Ms. Calvey had not intended to participate in a protest, she and her \nroommate were walking in the vicinity of First or Second Avenue and High Street when they \nheard protestors nearby. \n293.  They  walked in  the direction of the protests to see what  was  going  on and \npotentially join the protest since they agreed with the message against police brutality and \nracism. \n294.  Ms. Calvey was aware that there had been a curfew imposed that evening, but it \nwas approximately 9:00 p.m., she was not far from her residence, and the curfew would not start \nfor another hour. \n295.  As Ms. Calvey approached the protest, it appeared peaceful, though Columbus \nPolice Officers were massed in the street approximately 50 feet away from where she was \nstanding.   \n296.  The Columbus Police Officers were shouting at the protestors and began firing \nprojectiles at them at close range. \n297.  Within moments of approaching the protest, Ms. Calvey was struck in the face by \na projectile that, upon information and belief, was a wooden bullet.   \n298.  The wooden bullet split open her chin and caused excruciating pain. \n \n57 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 58 of 147  PAGEID #: 6499\n \n299.  The round that hit Ms. Calvey in the face had been directly fired at her with the \nintention of hitting her and had not been “skip-fired” as a “knee-knocker” off the ground.  \n300.  A true and accurate picture of her injury the morning after is below: \n \n58 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 59 of 147  PAGEID #: 6500\n \n \n301.  Ms. Calvey and her roommate fled down a side alley, where she received water \nand bandages from a group of protestors. \n \n59 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 60 of 147  PAGEID #: 6501\n \n302.  Ms. Calvey was forced to miss two days of work due to her facial injury and \nremained unable to chew solid food for approximately a week due to the pain in her jaw.   \n303.  The projectile wound has created a prominent scar on Ms. Calvey’s chin, which \nappears to be permanent. \nJ.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Stephanie Carlock \n304.  In the late afternoon of Saturday, May 30, 2020, near the Statehouse, around \nBroad and High Streets, Ms. Carlock joined friends who were protesting against police brutality \nand racism. \n305.  When  Ms.  Carlock  arrived  at  the  protest,  non-emergency  traffic  had  been \nrerouted, and she and others were standing stationary in the crosswalk across High Street.   \n306.  Many  Columbus  Police  Officers  were  there  dressed  in  riot  gear,  but  no \nannouncements were made and no orders were given.  \n307.  While Ms. Carlock was standing stationary in the crosswalk, a Columbus Police \nOfficer in riot gear sprayed her in the face with pepper spray at close range with no provocation, \ncausing Ms. Carlock intense pain and affecting her vision. \n308.  Columbus  Police  Officers  began  pushing  the  crowd  of  people  in  which  Ms. \nCarlock was standing with their riot shields and telling them to leave.   \n309.  A van rolled up and many Columbus Police Officers or Franklin County Sheriff’s \nOffice Deputies left the van and began firing projectiles at the crowd. \n310.  Ms. Carlock and her companions then moved to the Statehouse lawn, but mounted \nColumbus  Police  Officers  approached  and  used  their  horses  to  push  the  crowd  out  of  the \nStatehouse area.   \n \n60 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 61 of 147  PAGEID #: 6502\n \n311.  Ms. Carlock moved onto Broad Street and began walking east, with mounted \nColumbus Police Officers following the crowd and using their horses to push it further down \nBroad Street. \n312.  Ms. Carlock and her companions reached the intersection of Broad Street and \nFifth Street and were standing on the sidewalk, next to the plaque recognizing the site of the first \nWendy’s restaurant.   \n313.  Columbus Police Officers were still pushing the crowd, and Ms. Carlock and \nothers were asking them where they wanted the protestors to go. \n314.  Instead of answering and directing the crowd, the mounted Columbus Police \nOfficers rode their horses onto the sidewalk and began pushing their horses into the crowd.   \n315.  Ms. Carlock was struck by the legs of horses purposely being ridden into her and \nother protestors. \n316.  Ms. Carlock and others in the crowd continued to walk to the next corner, at \nwhich point they were confronted by Columbus Police Officers on bicycles.   \n317.  These  officers  cornered  the  crowd  against  a  building,  on  the  sidewalk,  and \ndeployed tear gas, causing Ms. Carlock to choke and cough and have difficulty breathing. \n318.  Ms. Carlock and others asked the officers why they were tear-gassing a peaceful \ncrowd on a sidewalk, and, instead of answering, the officers laughed while the protestors choked \non the gas.   \n319.  Ms. Carlock fled and rejoined protestors in another area. \n320.  The following evening, Sunday, May 31, at around 8 p.m., Ms. Carlock and a \nfriend went to the Short North area of Columbus, walking down High Street toward downtown, \non the sidewalk, seeking to join another protest against police brutality and racism.   \n \n61 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 62 of 147  PAGEID #: 6503\n \n321.  Ms. Carlock was aware there was a curfew of 10:00 p.m. that evening, but it was \nstill 40 minutes before curfew (approximately 9:20 p.m.), when the group she was in approached \nthe intersection of High Street and Spring Street.   \n322.  Ms. Carlock and the protestors she had joined were peaceful, walking on the \npublic sidewalk, and not disobeying any orders from law enforcement.  \n323.  As Ms. Carlock neared Spring Street, a black van pulled up and Columbus Police \nOfficers in riot gear jumped out.   \n324.  Without  warning,  the  officers  began  shooting  projectiles  and  tear  gas  at  the \ncrowd.   \n325.  Ms. Carlock was once again exposed to tear gas, affecting her breathing and \ncausing her to choke and cough. \nK.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff S.L.C. \n326.  On May 30, 2020, S.L.C. traveled from Hamilton County, with his uncle, Plaintiff \nJ. Horn, to downtown Columbus, Ohio, where they met his cousin, Plaintiff K. Horn, and his \ncousin’s girlfriend.  \n327.  Prior to traveling to Columbus, Mr. C. had created hand-drawn signs with “Black \nLives Matter” and the names of some of the victims of police brutality.  \n328.  Mr. C. was intending to protest peacefully by holding his hand-drawn signs. \n329.  Mr. C. and his family joined a group of peaceful protestors.  \n330.  After  being  there  less  than  15  minutes,  Mr.  C.  witnessed  Columbus  Police \nOfficers throw tear gas canisters at another group of peaceful protestors, and he and Plaintiff K. \nHorn went over to help the protestors who had been tear-gassed. \n \n62 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 63 of 147  PAGEID #: 6504\n \n331.  They  moved  the  injured  protestors  to  a  different  location  because  Columbus \nPolice Officers were throwing tear-gas canisters all around the area.   \n332.  In the commotion of helping the other injured protestors, Mr. C. got disconnected \nfrom his family and then joined another group of protestors who were walking and carrying signs \npeacefully.  \n333.  While in the middle of this group of protestors, Columbus Police Officers threw \nfour canisters of tear gas into Mr. C.’s group. \n334.  The tear gas reached Mr. C.’s eyes, causing a severe burning sensation.  \n335.  There was no one there to offer medical assistance, so Mr. C. ran from the area \nwhere he was struck with tear gas, sat down on a sidewalk, and applied water to his eyes until the \npain subsided slightly. \n336.  Mr. C. was able to reconnect with his family and decided to continue his peaceful \nprotest with his cousin. \n337.  Mr. C. witnessed Plaintiff K. Horn get struck in the leg with a wooden bullet \nwhile trying to run from tear gas in the area.  \n338.    Mr. C. observed Plaintiff K. Horn during this entire period, and Plaintiff K. Horn \ndid not act violently or aggressively in any way before being struck.  \n339.  Mr. C. and his uncle, Plaintiff J. Horn, returned home to Hamilton County the \nevening of May 30, 2020, and did not return again for any protests.  \nL.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Keith Duerk \n340.  On May 30, 2020, Mr. Duerk decided to go downtown to join protestors at the \nintersection of Broad and High Streets. \n \n63 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 64 of 147  PAGEID #: 6505\n \n341.  Mr. Duerk brought his thirty-pound d’jembe drum with him to play music in \nsupport of the protests. \n342.  He arrived at the intersection of Broad and High around 4:30 p.m. and sat with his \ndrum on a bench on the east side of Broad Street directly outside of the Statehouse and began \nplaying. \n343.  Many protestors were in the street,  facing Division Officers, lined along the \nintersection. \n344.  Mr.  Duerk  was  approximately  fifty  yards  from  the  crowd  of  protestors  and \nofficers in the street; he was close to the Statehouse grounds, remaining on the bench. \n345.  During  this  time,  Mr.  Duerk  witnessed  Division  Officers  use  crowd  control \ndevices to disperse the crowd, including pepper spray, tear gas canisters, and gas grenades. \n346.  Each time the police used a particular crowd control device, it made a loud \nbooming sound. \n347.  Mr. Duerk responded to the booming sounds of the crowd control devices by \nincreasing the volume by which he played his drum, remaining seated on the bench away from \nthe crowd. \n348.  There were a few protestors near Mr. Duerk on the sidewalk, but the majority of \nprotestors were in the street. \n349.  After approximately twenty minutes of playing his drum, around 5:00 p.m., Mr. \nDuerk was struck in the face with a wooden bullet while playing loudly in response to police \ncrowd control devices. \n350.  The wooden bullet came from in front of him, towards his left side, and struck \nhim on his left cheek, immediately under his eye. \n \n64 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 65 of 147  PAGEID #: 6506\n \n351.  When Mr. Duerk was hit with the wooden bullet, he was struck at such a velocity \nthat his entire head rocked back and he experienced a ringing sensation throughout his head. \n352.  Upon being struck, Mr. Duerk ran away from the area to put his drum away in his \ncar because he no longer felt safe having it out and believed the police targeted him for making \ntoo much noise. \n353.  Mr. Duerk then returned to protest but remained at a far distance from the crowd \nand any officers. \n354.  The wooden bullet, shot by an unknown Division Officer, caused Mr. Duerk’s \nface to swell and left a bruise immediately under his left eye and cheek area. \nM.  Mistreatment of Jennifer Eidemiller \n \n355.  On May 30, 2020, in the early evening, Ms. Eidemiller, who resides near where \nprotests were taking place in downtown Columbus, decided to join the peaceful protests against \npolice brutality. \n356.  Ms. Eidemiller had been protesting with others for around ten minutes when she \nfound herself on Third Street. \n357.  Ms. Eidemiller began to cross the street legally by remaining in the crosswalk. \n358.  When Ms. Eidemiller reached the sidewalk, though, she and a group of other \npeaceful protestors were pepper-sprayed at point-blank range. \n359.  Ms. Eidemiller’s vision was temporarily impaired, and the pain in her eyes was \nterrible.  \n360.  The Columbus Police Officer who sprayed Ms. Eidemiller sprayed everyone in \nthe area collectively and indiscriminately.   \n361.  Ms. Eidemiller also witnessed officers on horseback attacking peaceful protestors. \n \n65 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 66 of 147  PAGEID #: 6507\n \n362.  Ms. Eidemiller was taken by medics who immediately provided care for her at the \nscene. \n363.  After being treated by the medics and given instructions on how to self-treat her \ninjuries, Ms. Eidemiller went home and followed those instructions in order to cope with the \neffects of the chemical spray on her body. \n364.  The  next  morning,  May  31,  2020,  Ms.  Eidemiller  returned  to  downtown \nColumbus, along with two friends, in order to continue to peacefully protest police brutality. \n365.  As they approached the scene of protests already taking place, they noticed a \ngroup of protestors and organizers in the intersection of Broad and High Streets, near the east \nside of the intersection.  \n366.  Ms. Eidemiller proceeded to lock arms with them and chant out calls for justice. \n367.  Protestors stood there peacefully for approximately 30 minutes. \n368.  Columbus Police Officers then announced that they would begin using chemical \nweapons if protestors did not leave the area. \n369.  As the protestors were attempting to disperse, Columbus Police Officers used \nvarious chemical weapons. \n370.  Ms.  Eidemiller  was  pepper-sprayed  three  or  four  times  at  close  range  by  a \nColumbus Police Officer. \n371.  Medics again treated Ms. Eidemiller at the scene and instructed her on how she \ncould deal with the pain, impaired vision, and headache from the chemical spray once she got \nhome.   \nN.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Andrew Fahmy  \n \n66 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 67 of 147  PAGEID #: 6508\n \n372.  On  June  1,  2020,  Mr. Fahmy  and  a  friend  went  to  downtown  Columbus  to \nparticipate in the protests.   \n373.  They arrived at the Statehouse at 7:00 p.m. and then participated in a march north \non High Street along with several thousand other protestors.   \n374.  Eventually, at approximately 10:20 p.m., the march reached the intersection of \nLane Avenue and High Street just north of The Ohio State University. \n375.  By the time the march had reached Lane Avenue, the number of marchers had \ndwindled considerably and the march seemed to be coming to an end. \n376.  As  the  marchers  approached  Lane  Avenue  on  High  Street,  Columbus  Police \nOfficers wearing riot gear approached the marchers from the south.   \n378.  When the Columbus Police Officers were within approximately 15 feet of the \nremaining marchers, they began spraying pepper spray.  \n379.  The  use  of  pepper  spray,  chemical  agents,  and  less-lethal  munitions  against \nnonviolent protestors at Lane and High was authorized and directed by Defendant Lieutenant \nLawrence Yates. \n380.  The pepper spraying caused the remaining marchers to run in all directions.  \n381.  Mr. Fahmy retreated east on Lane Avenue along with many other marchers.  \n382.  The  Columbus  Police  Officers  then  formed  a  line  across  Lane  Avenue \napproximately 200 feet east of High Street facing east. \n383.  Mr.  Fahmy  and  other  protestors  got  out  their  phones  and  began  filming  the \nColumbus Police Officers, who were approximately 20 feet away.   \n384.  None  of  the  protestors  were  behaving  violently  or  throwing  anything  at  the \nColumbus Police Officers.  \n \n67 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 68 of 147  PAGEID #: 6509\n \n385.  Mr. Fahmy then observed the Columbus Police Officers preparing to fire tear gas \ncanisters. \n386.  Before Mr. Fahmy could move out of the way, the Columbus Police Officers shot \ntear gas canisters directly into the crowd. \n387.  Mr. Fahmy was hit in the leg with a canister, which fractured his fibula, causing \nsevere pain, and requiring treatment. \n388.  True and accurate pictures of his injuries, including an x-ray of the fracture, are \nshown below. \n \n68 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 69 of 147  PAGEID #: 6510\n \n \n \n69 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 70 of 147  PAGEID #: 6511\n \n \n \n70 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 71 of 147  PAGEID #: 6512\n \nO.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Talon Garth    \n389.  On May 31, 2020, Mr. Garth attended a downtown protest of police abuse. \n390.  In the early evening, along with hundreds of other protestors, Mr. Garth was \nstanding in the street at the intersection of Broad and High Streets.   \n391.  That  intersection  and  several  blocks  had  long  been  closed  that  evening  to \nvehicular traffic.   \n392.  While Mr. Garth was standing at the intersection, a Columbus Division of Police \nArmored Vehicle with the word acronym SWAT painted on the side pulled into the intersection \nand stopped.   \n393.  After the armored SWAT vehicle stopped, a team of officers disembarked from it. \n394.  The SWAT officers began to tell the crowd standing at Broad and High Street to \nmove.   \n395.  Prior to the arrival of the SWAT officers, the protest at Broad and High had been \npeaceful, with no violence or attacks on property.   \n396.  Prior to the arrival of the SWAT officers, protestors at Broad and High had \nmaintained a good relationship with Ohio Highway Patrol Officers stationed at the Statehouse. \n397.  Because there was no vehicular traffic on Broad or High Streets, there was no \nreason for the protestors to be removed from the streets.   \n398.  After being told to move, Mr. Garth and more than 100 other protestors close to \nthe SWAT officers sat down on the street in an act of passive resistance. \n399.  Mr. Garth was then approximately ten feet away from the SWAT Officers.  \n400.  At this point, a few individuals in the back of the huge crowd, who were not \namong those sitting close to the SWAT officers, threw several water bottles at them.   \n \n71 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 72 of 147  PAGEID #: 6513\n \n401.  It was obvious that the bottles had not been thrown by Mr. Garth or any of the \nprotestors sitting in front of the SWAT officers. \n402.  Nevertheless, the SWAT Officers immediately took deliberate aim and began \nfiring wooden bullets directly into the peaceful seated protestors who were sitting directly in \nfront of them. \n403.  The use of wooden bullets against non-violent protestors was authorized and \ndirected by Defendants Sergeant Scott Bray and Sergeant Brian Bruce. \n404.  The wooden bullets were around the size of pill bottles.   \n405.  Mr. Garth was struck by a total of ten wooden bullets, one on each knee, four on \nhis right leg, one on his right thigh, one in the arm, and one in the back of his head. \n406.  A wooden bullet also struck Mr. Garth in the foot, fracturing his fourth metatarsal \nbone.  \n407.  True and accurate pictures of his leg and foot injuries are below.   \n \n \n72 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 73 of 147  PAGEID #: 6514\n \n \n \n73 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 74 of 147  PAGEID #: 6515\n \n \n408.  Mr. Garth had to seek medical attention for his fractured foot and has been \nrequired to wear a walking boot while it heals.   \n \n74 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 75 of 147  PAGEID #: 6516\n \n409.  In addition to breaking his foot, the wooden bullet caused severe lacerations to his \nshins and other parts of his body, many of which are likely to cause permanent scarring.   \n410.  As a proximate result of his injuries, Mr. Garth has been unable to work since the \nincident and has suffered significant lost income.  \nP.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Holly Hahn \n411.  At approximately 7:30 p.m. on May 30, 2020, Ms. Hahn traveled west from \nItalian Village towards the protest that was taking place at the intersection of High Street and the \nI-670 cap. \n412.  Ms. Hahn’s intention that day was to videotape the interactions of protestors with \nthe police. \n413.  Around 8:00 p.m., Ms. Hahn arrived at the intersection of High and Russell \nStreets just as protestors there were being pushed north by Franklin County Sheriff’s Deputies in \nSWAT uniforms.   \n414.  Ms. Hahn stood on the sidewalk at the southeast side of the intersection and began \nfilming the protestors who were backing up High Street. \n415.  Shortly after Ms. Hahn began filming, SWAT Officers executed their surrounding \nmaneuver on Russell Street. \n416.  Ms. Hahn did not hear any order to leave the area. \n417.  In  reviewing  the  videotape  recording  she  made,  Ms.  Hahn  heard  that  order; \nhowever, the noise and chaos where she was standing rendered it inaudible to her at the time. \n418.  Ms. Hahn was tackled to the ground, maced directly in the face at close range, and \nhandcuffed. \n \n75 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 76 of 147  PAGEID #: 6517\n \n419.  While Ms. Hahn was handcuffed and blinded on the street, a Columbus Police \nOfficer approached her, told her to look at him, and then stated, “You should be ashamed of \nyourself.  You shouldn’t be here, you should be at home making cookies.” \n420.  Ms. Hahn was placed in a police wagon for several hours, where her hands were \nhandcuffed behind her back, she was not given water, mace remained on her face, and Columbus \nPolice Officers then transported her to an emergency room where she was examined for a \nconcussion, treated for chemical burns, had her face cleansed and took a shower, and given a CT \nscan.  \n421.  Ms. Hahn was given a citation for a minor misdemeanor count of failing to \ndisperse by Officer Michael Laird, stating that on the 30th day of May, Ms. Hahn knowingly \nfailed to comply with the order of a law enforcement officer or public official to disperse from \nthe scene of a riot and defining riot as five or more persons participating in a course of disorderly \nconduct, specifically throwing rocks and bricks at police officers and interfering with another’s \narrest.     \n422.  On June 23, 2020, the charge against Ms. Hahn was dismissed.   \n423.  Previously, on May 28, 2020, Ms. Hahn had gone to the protest taking place near \nthe intersection of Broad and High Streets, arriving around 8:30 p.m. \n424.  Ms. Hahn’s intent in attending the protest was to video the interactions of the \nprotestors and the police, and she paid special attention to individuals who seemed to be in \nagitated conversations with police officers. \n425.   Ms. Hahn found herself towards the front of the protest near a police line and \nfilming an African-American female who was being vocally aggressive to a police officer.  \n \n76 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 77 of 147  PAGEID #: 6518\n \n426.  While Ms. Hahn was filming, something happened to her right that caught her \nattention, and she saw a group of Columbus Police Officers quickly move towards the protestors. \n427.  One Columbus Police Officer knocked her cellphone out of Ms. Hahn’s hand. \n428.  Nearly simultaneously, another Columbus Police Officer then pepper-sprayed Ms. \nHahn in the left side of her face, blinding her in one eye. \n429.  Columbus Police Officers then grabbed Ms. Hahn by her ponytail and wrist and \nbegan to take her to the ground.   \n430.  As Ms. Hahn was going down, out of her right eye she observed a Columbus \nPolice Officer stomping on her phone. \n431.  While Ms. Hahn was being taken down, the Columbus Police Officer who had her \nwrist began screaming at her to “turn it.”   \n432.  Because of a prior medical issue, Ms. Hahn’s wrist bones are fused, and she is \nunable to turn the wrist; however, she was able to partially use the wrist to break her fall. \n433.  When Ms. Hahn landed on the ground, her fused wrist was partially under her \nbody and a Columbus Police Officer was trying to pull it from under her and yelling at her to \nturn it.  \n434.  Ms. Hahn attempted to tell the Columbus Police Officer that she could not turn \nthe wrist because it was fused. \n435.  The Columbus Police Officer then grabbed Ms. Hahn by the ponytail, used it as a \nhandle to slam her face on the ground, and then handcuffed her.   \n436.  After being handcuffed, Ms. Hahn was placed in the back of a police car for three \nhours.  \n \n77 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 78 of 147  PAGEID #: 6519\n \n437.  Ms. Hahn was then released and told that she would be receiving an “indictment” \nin the mail. \n438.  Ms. Hahn was never charged with any crime as a result of the events of the \nevening of May 28, 2020. \n439.  The pepper spray continued to irritate her eye and the she suffered pain, bruises, \nand headaches from the physical force used by Columbus Police Officers.   \nQ.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Bryan Hazlett \n440.  On May 30, 2020, Mr. Hazlett and a friend decided to attend a downtown protest \nthat was occurring near the I-670 Cap over High Street by the intersection of Goodale and High \nStreets. \n441.  At approximately 6:30 p.m., Mr. Hazlett and his friend arrived in the Short North \nand parked near the intersection of High Street and First Avenue. \n442.  Before heading south to join the protest, Mr. Hazlett and his friend spent time \nlocating another friend who was meeting up with them.   \n443.  After locating the other friend, Mr. Hazlett and his group began walking towards \nthe protest on High Street, which was taking place near the intersection of West Poplar Avenue \nand High Street, arriving around 8:00 p.m. \n444.  Upon  Mr.  Hazlett’s  arrival,  he  observed  approximately  20  Franklin  County \nSheriff’s Deputies forming a line across High Street, took a picture of the line of officers, and a \ntrue and accurate copy of that picture is below. \n \n78 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 79 of 147  PAGEID #: 6520\n \n \n445.  After arriving at the protest, Mr. Hazlett held a sign and participated in chants. \n446.  Shortly after his arrival, Franklin County Sheriff’s Deputies played a recording \ntelling protestors to leave.   \n447.  Mr. Hazlett took the recording to mean that protestors should get off the street and \nonto the sidewalk, and he retreated to the sidewalk on the south side of the street.  . \n448.  Unbeknownst to Mr. Hazlett, the Franklin County Sheriff’s Deputies forming the \nline were SWAT officers assisted by Columbus Police Officers. \n449.  The SWAT officers were on the scene as part of planned maneuver to surround, \nattack, and arrest the protestors on High Street. \n450.  As part of the SWAT team’s plan, coordinated in advance with Columbus Police \nDivision SWAT and officers, the SWAT officers stationed at the I-670 Cap were to advance \n \n79 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 80 of 147  PAGEID #: 6521\n \nnorth on High Street, driving the protestors north by showering them with glass from broken \nwindows, directly shooting them with wooden bullets, and spraying them with tear gas and \npepper spray.  \n451.  While the SWAT officers were driving the protestors north on High Street, a large \nnumber of other SWAT officers were to take up positions east and west of High Street on \nRussell Street, and, when the protestors on High Street were driven close to Russell Street, the \nSWAT officers were to come running out on High Street and take the protestors from the rear. \n452.  As part of the plan, it was decided in advance that all of the individuals trapped in \nthe street were to be targeted by wooden bullets, violently tackled to the ground, and pepper-\nsprayed directly in the face, regardless of whether they resisted arrest or posed any danger to the \nSWAT officers. \n453.  This plan was not made in the heat of the battle or a split-second decision but was \ncalmly created ahead of time. \n454.  The Deputies and Officers concocted a pretext for this plan, telling the media that \nan officer-in-distress call came from protestors allegedly throwing water bottles and rocks at \nthem. \n455.  The officer-in-distress call had actually been made around 6:30 p.m., two hours \nprior to the actions of the SWAT team. \n456.  Defendants determined in advance that they would make no distinction between \nindividuals  throwing  objects  at  Columbus  Police  Officers  or  mutual-aid  law  enforcement \npersonnel and those engaged in peaceful protesting, videotaping the events, serving as medics or \nreporters, and/or residing in the neighborhood. \n \n80 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 81 of 147  PAGEID #: 6522\n \n457.  Franklin County Sheriff’s Office Sergeant Ray DeBolt, whose officers were also \ninvolved  in  the  surrounding  operation,  admitted  that  he  had  no  idea  whether  the  people \nsurrounded on the street were protestors or rioters: “I can’t tell who’s a protester and who’s a \nrioter at that point.” \n458.  Instead of making an effort to determine which individuals had actually engaged \nin violence towards the police, Defendants decided in advance to inflict group punishment, with \nall individuals present  on the street being shot with wooden bullets, violently tackled, and \npepper-sprayed at close range. \n459.  By May 30, 2020, Defendants had seen videos of Columbus Police Officers \nengaging in unnecessary violence against protestors, including the assault of a United States \nCongresswoman; were aware that the Officers were undertrained and incapable of engaging in \nconstitutional crowd control; and took no remedial steps, including reconsidering the weaponry \nused by the Columbus Police Officers and mutual aid law enforcement personnel cooperating \nwith them. \n460.  Further, Defendants knew by then that some of Columbus Police Officers and \nmutual aid law enforcement personnel cooperating with them were incapable of keeping their \ncool during demonstrations and were prone to violence.   \n461.  Nevertheless, such officers were placed in a position where they would be directly \ninteracting with protestors. \n462.  Defendants  also  then  knew  that  Columbus  Police  Officers  were  routinely \ndisregarding the requirement that wooden bullets be skip-fired and instead were directly firing \nthem at protestors.   \n \n81 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 82 of 147  PAGEID #: 6523\n \n463.  Despite that knowledge, Defendants continued to equip Columbus Police Officers \nwith wooden bullet launchers knowing they would be misused.   \n464.  After Mr. Hazlett had retreated, he observed that SWAT Officers opened fire with \nwooden bullets  at  the second-floor windows of buildings along  High  Street,  shattering the \nwindows and causing glass to rain down on Mr. Hazlett and other protestors standing on the \nsidewalk. \n465.  The SWAT Officers intended to not only inflict pain on the protestors but also to \ncause property damage which could be blamed on the protestors and then justify additional use \nof violence. \n466.  In order to avoid the falling glass, Mr. Hazlett walked to the curb of the sidewalk. \n467.  Columbus Police Officers or mutual-aid law enforcement personnel were then \nmarching up the street direct-firing wooden bullets at any protestors they saw, and protestors in \nthe street were being pushed towards Russell Street. \n468.  Approximately ten of the protestors had been in the middle of the street with \nsheets of plywood in front of them to block flying wooden bullets.   \n469.  As Columbus Police Officers or mutual-aid law enforcement personnel marched \ntoward them, the protestors picked up their sheets of plywood and began walking backwards \nnorth on High Street while using the plywood to block flying wooden bullets. \n470.  Mr. Hazlett realized as the protestors were being herded towards Russell Street \nthat serious danger lurked, and he began to look around for his friend, a younger female, to tell \nher that they needed to get out of there right away.   \n471.  When Mr. Hazlett  located his  friend, she was  one of the protestors walking \nbackwards with the sheets of plywood. \n \n82 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 83 of 147  PAGEID #: 6524\n \n472.  Mr. Hazlett then stepped off the sidewalk into the street to get his friend and drag \nher out of the situation.   \n473.  As soon as Mr. Hazlett left the sidewalk, he was hit in the shin by a wooden \nbullet. \n474.  Mr. Hazlett continued into the street, ran up to his friend, and yelled, “We need to \nget the fuck out of here.” \n475.  Just as Mr. Hazlett was entering the street, cruisers driven by Columbus Police \nOfficers  or  mutual-aid  law  enforcement  personnel  increased  their  rate  of  speed  and  drove \ndirectly toward the group of protestors walking backward, only veering off to the side at the last \nsecond. \n476.  Thinking that they were about to be hit by the cars, the protestors immediately \ndropped the sheets of plywood and ran north. \n477.  At just this moment, SWAT Officers hiding on both sides of Russell Street ran \nonto High Street and attacked both the protestors running from the street and individuals who \nwere on the sidewalk or trying to cross High Street at the crosswalk. \n478.  Implementing  their prearranged plan  for  group punishment,  Columbus Police \nOfficers  and/or  mutual-aid  law  enforcement  personnel  methodically  pepper-sprayed  fleeing \nprotestors in the face at close range and, while the protestors could not see, other Officers \nviolently tackled the protestors to the ground. \n479.  To inflict pain and teach the protestors a lesson, SWAT Officers even pepper-\nsprayed protestors while they were helplessly restrained on the ground. \n480.  One particularly excited SWAT Officer launched himself like a bowling ball into \na group of individuals crossing High Street, knocking at least three of them to the ground. \n \n83 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 84 of 147  PAGEID #: 6525\n \n481.  Along with the rest of the protestors in the middle of the street, Mr. Hazlett ran \nfrom the onrushing police cars. \n482.  As can be seen in the below videos (double click to play or click the links), which \ntruly and accurately reflect the events, before he had taken more than a couple of steps Mr. \nHazlett was pepper-sprayed in the face at point-blank range by an officer as Mr. Hazlett raised \nhis  hand  in  the  air.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/nr6t9y2ph8yydv7/IMG_0113.mov?dl=0  and \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/u954qu086ecsn9m/06-05-\n2020%20officers%20tackling%20protesters%20in%20the%20Short%20North.mp4?dl=0.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n84 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 85 of 147  PAGEID #: 6526\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n85 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 86 of 147  PAGEID #: 6527\n \n483.  After  he  was  hit  by  the  pepper  spray,  Mr.  Hazlett  was  completely  blinded, \nstaggered forward several steps, and then began to pull up.  \n484.  As the officers from Russell Street ran out to arrest protestors, one officer, later \nidentified as Defendant Columbus Police Officer Michael Eschenburg, Badge Number 2734, \nhung back awaiting the opportunity to violently attack a protestor. \n485.  Defendant Eschenburg harbored animosity and anger towards what the protestors \nstood for and wanted to impress other Columbus Police Officers with his body-slamming a \nprotestor. \n486.  As is reflected on the video, Defendant Eschenburg waited to target a protestor \nwho had been sprayed in the face with pepper spray and blinded. \n487.  As  Mr.  Hazlett  stumbled  after  being  pepper  sprayed,  Defendant  Eschenburg \nobserved that Mr. Hazlett had been sprayed in the face with pepper spray and was now a helpless \ntarget, and he then lined up Mr. Hazlett for a body slam. \n \n86 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 87 of 147  PAGEID #: 6528\n \n488.  As can be seen in the video, Defendant Eschenburg never attempted a tackle or an \narm-bar takedown; instead, he kept himself aligned with Mr. Hazlett’s front. \n489.  Defendant  Eshenburg  is  a  large,  muscular  man  who  was  fully  dressed  in \nprotective tactical gear and equipped with both lethal and less-than-lethal weaponry.   \n490.  Defendant Eschenburg had been trained in numerous forms of physical combat. \n491.  Defendant  Eschenburg  was  among  50  or  more  SWAT  Officers,  all  as  fully \ndressed, armed, and trained as he was. \n492.  Mr. Hazlett is considerably smaller than Defendant Eschenburg; was wearing a t-\nshirt, shorts, and tennis shoes; had no combat training; and was completely blinded by pepper \nspray.   \n493.  As can be seen in the video, after Defendant Eschenburg had lined Mr. Hazlett up, \nhe charged towards him, making no effort to tackle Mr. Hazlett or take him to the ground, and, \ninstead, bent down to hit Mr. Hazlett in his midsection. \n494.  After hitting Mr. Hazlett in the midsection, Defendant Eschenburg physically \npicked Mr. Hazlett up in the air and then jumped forward, throwing Mr. Hazlett on his back with \nDefendant Eschenburg’s full weight on him.   \n495.  As Defendant Eschenburg had planned, Mr. Hazlett’s primary point of contact \nwith the pavement was his back and neck area, and that maneuver easily could have caused a \nbroken neck and permanent paralysis. \n496.  After  being  pepper-sprayed  and  slammed  to  the  ground,  Mr.  Hazlett  was \ncompletely disoriented, and he curled up in the fetal position on the pavement.   \n497.  Several Columbus Police Officers then converged on Mr. Hazlett as he was lying \nin the street.   \n \n87 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 88 of 147  PAGEID #: 6529\n \n498.  In response to Columbus Police Officers yelling at Mr. Hazlett to give them his \narm, he told them that his arm was injured and that he was blinded. \n499.  One Columbus Police Officer then kicked or kneed him in the back, and another \nsprayed him in the face with pepper spray at point blank range. \n500.  Mr. Hazlett’s hands were then placed in handcuffs and taken to the curb. \n501.  Columbus Police Officers took Mr. Hazlett to a makeshift police station where he \nremained for six hours and was then transported to the Franklin County Jail at Jackson Pike. \n502.  Mr. Hazlett was bleeding, injured, and still covered with pepper spray, and the jail \nstaff at Jackson Pike refused to admit him. \n503.  After the jail refused to accept Mr. Hazlett, he was taken back to downtown \nColumbus where he was given a citation for a fourth-degree misdemeanor count of failing to \ndisperse and dropped off on the street. \n504.  In a great deal of pain from his leg injury, Mr. Hazlett limped through downtown \nup to the Short North to get his car. \n505.  On June 16, 2020, the criminal charge against Mr. Hazlett was dismissed.   \nR.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Justin Horn  \n506.  On May 30, 2020, around 5:30 p.m., Mr. J. Horn arrived in downtown Columbus \nwith the intent to peacefully protest police brutality and racial injustice.  \n507.  Mr. J. Horn was accompanied by his son, Kurghan Horn; his nephew, a 16-year-\nold minor, Plaintiff S.L.C.; and his son’s significant other. \n508.  After they parked, they walked toward the protest. \n \n88 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 89 of 147  PAGEID #: 6530\n \n509.  After being at the protest for about five minutes, which up until Columbus Police \nOfficers’ order to disperse had been peaceful, Mr. J. Horn’s son was tear-gassed and shot with a \nwooden bullet, and Plaintiff S.L.C. was tear-gassed. \n510.    Mr. J. Horn walked to where Columbus Police Officers were standing in front of \nthe protestors, and he began videotaping their bombarding protestors. \n511.  Mr. J. Horn videotaped for approximately an hour. \n512.  As he started to walk away, Mr. J. Horn was tackled by Defendant Sergeant Brian \nSteele (“Defendant Sgt. Steele”), and his shoulder was dislocated. \n513.  Another Columbus Police Officer, Joshua Cramer, assisted Defendant Sgt. Steele \nin arresting Mr. J. Horn. \n514.  Mr. J. Horn screamed in pain and anger at the Columbus Police Officers, and one \nofficer popped his shoulder back into the socket. \n515.  Officer Cramer then pulled Mr. J. Horn’s arm behind his back and handcuffed \nhim. \n516.  Mr. J. Horn remained in pain and asked for medical care. \n517.  Columbus Police Officers told Mr. J. Horn that it always hurts when a shoulder is \ndislocated. \n518.  For four hours Mr. J. Horn remained handcuffed and in pain. \n519.  Columbus Police Officers told Mr. J. Horn that he would be released on his own \nrecognizance if he signed away the right to any medical care. \n520.  Columbus Police Officers transported Mr. J. Horn to a holding facility, speeding \nup and then quickly braking so that his body bounced around, and he cried out in pain. \n \n89 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 90 of 147  PAGEID #: 6531\n \n521.  Ultimately, Mr. J. Horn sought medical care and was diagnosed with a closed \ndisplaced fracture of the proximal end of his left humerus. \n522.  Mr. J. Horn was prescribed a lengthy rehabilitation period which he has started. \n523.  The  fracture  continues  to  cause  Mr.  J.  Horn  pain;  a  true  and  accurate \nrepresentation of Mr. J. Horn’s back injury sustained from being tackled by the officers is shown \nbelow. \n \n \n90 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 91 of 147  PAGEID #: 6532\n \nS.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Kurghan Horn \n524.  On May 30, 2020, Mr. K. Horn was watching a live-feed on social media and \nsaw Columbus Police Officers indiscriminately throwing tear gas at peaceful protestors.  \n525.  Mr. K. Horn had prior limited first-aid training and felt the need to go to the \nprotests and provide whatever assistance he could. \n526.  Mr.  K.  Horn  headed  to  downtown  Columbus  with  his  friends  and  family \nmembers, including Plaintiffs J. Horn and S.L.C..  \n527.  They parked near The Garden, a Short North store, on High Street.  \n528.  They began helping individuals who had been tear-gassed and were hurt.  \n529.  They then approached near the front of the protest and witnessed Columbus \nPolice Officers laughing at the protestors.   \n530.  Columbus Police Officers in a vehicle then ordered everyone to disperse and \nsuddenly began throwing tear gas canisters.  \n531.  One of the canisters of tear gas was thrown towards Mr. K. Horn.  \n532.  As Mr. K. Horn picked up the canister to move it away from him, a Columbus \nPolice Officer shot him with an object in the back of his left thigh. \n533.  Mr. K. Horn started to retreat, and Columbus Police Officers continued to \nthrow tear gas canisters.  \n534.  Mr. K. Horn lost contact with his family and friends in the chaos that ensued. \n535.  Mr. K. Horn witnessed a Columbus Police Officer grasp a protestor, take her \nmask off, and then pepper-spray her in the face. \n536.  Ultimately, Mr. K. Horn was hit by wooden and/or rubber bullets over a dozen \ntimes.  \n \n91 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 92 of 147  PAGEID #: 6533\n \n537.  Mr. Horn sustained painful injuries to his left thigh from one or more rubber \nbullets.  \n538.  The picture below truly and accurately reflects the bruise on his thigh caused by \none or more rubber bullets. \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nT.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Terry D. Hubby, Jr. \n539.  On the evening of May 29, 2020, Mr. Hubby joined the ongoing protests in \ndowntown Columbus.  \n540.  When Mr. Hubby arrived at the protest, the air was already filled with chemical \nagents, causing a burning sensation in his eyes and on his skin. \n541.  At  approximately  9:00  p.m.,  Mr.  Hubby  and  his  companions  arrived  at  the \nintersection of State Street and High Street where they stood on the sidewalk at the corner. \n542.  None of the people with or near Mr. Hubby was doing anything except peacefully \nprotesting, chanting slogans, and observing a large crowd of Columbus Police Officers massed in \nthe street. \n \n92 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 93 of 147  PAGEID #: 6534\n \n543.  Mr. Hubby had his mobile phone in his hand and was filming the scene at the \nintersection. \n544.  Without prior warning, Columbus Police Officers opened fire on the crowd Mr. \nHubby was in with projectile weapons, including rubber and wooden bullets. \n546.  A loud announcement was made by the Columbus Police Officers as they opened \nfire, stating that crowd control devices were about to be deployed.   \n547.  There was no time between when the announcement and when the projectiles \nbegan to hit the crowd in which anyone could safely disperse or avoid the projectiles. \n548.  A true and accurate reflection and audio of what occurred was captured on the \nvideo  below  (double  click  to  play  or  click  the  link): \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/rlzcry9zbhshkcx/IMG_0119%20%281%29.mov?dl=0.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n93 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 94 of 147  PAGEID #: 6535\n \n549.  Mr. Hubby was immediately struck by a wooden bullet which broke his kneecap, \ncausing him excruciating pain. \n550.  Mr.  Hubby  fell  to  the  ground  as  additional  projectiles  continued  striking \nprotestors and the area around them on the sidewalk. \n551.  Mr. Hubby was assisted by other protestors, including one who fashioned a splint, \nand they carried him away from the area where he had been shot.   \n552.  The other protestors did all of this while attempting to protect Mr. Hubby and \nthemselves from further injury as Columbus Police Officers continued to fire on them.   \n553.  Unable to walk or safely seek medical attention, Mr. Hubby waited for nearly an \nhour until a friend was able to transport him to Grant Hospital. \n554.  X-rays administered at the hospital revealed that Mr. Hubby’s kneecap had been \nshattered and he needed surgery. \n555.  The next day, May 30, Mr. Hubby underwent knee surgery, and a number of \nscrews and a metal plate were placed in and around his knee.   \n556.  Mr. Hubby was hospitalized for an additional two days. \n557.  Mr. Hubby is recovering from his severe knee injury and will need long-term \nrehabilitation to restore his mobility. \n558.  Mr. Hubby has Type 1 Diabetes, which makes any restriction of blood flow to his \nextremities dangerous, and he has been informed that his injury and the need to insert the screws \nand plate in his knee has greatly increased the likelihood that his leg will require amputation in \nthe future.  \nU.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Randy Kaigler \n \n94 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 95 of 147  PAGEID #: 6536\n \n559.  On Thursday, May 28, 2020, at approximately 7:30 p.m., Plaintiff Kaigler was \ndriving through downtown Columbus when he observed a peaceful protest in process near the \nintersection of Broad and High Streets. \n560.  Because he believed in the message of the protest, Mr. Kaigler decided to join it, \nparking his car and proceeding on foot towards the intersection of Broad and High Streets. \n561.  While walking to the protest, Mr. Kaigler observed a group of Columbus Police \nOfficers standing on Broad Street across the street from the Ohio Statehouse. \n562.  The Columbus Police Officers observed by Mr. Kaigler did not appear to be \nengaged in crowd-control activities or carrying crowd-control paraphernalia but rather were \nmilling around a cruiser with ample room in the street to move. \n563.   When Mr. Kaigler observed the Columbus Police Officers, Broad Street was \nclosed to vehicular traffic and officers and protestors were in the street. \n564.  The protest was loud but peaceful.   \n565.  Upon  seeing  the  Columbus  Police  Officers,  Mr.  Kaigler  decided  to  make  a \npolitical statement: he walked within approximately five feet of them, stopped and raised his \narms in a “hands up, don’t shoot” position and stated to the officers “I can’t breathe.” \n566.  The “hands up, don’t shoot” gesture originated at protests after the August 9, \n2014, shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and displayed a common sign of \nsubmission which communicated that a suspect was not presenting a threat and, like Brown’s \nalleged conduct, should not be shot.   \n567.  The statement “I can’t breathe” is a reference to the 2014 killing of Eric Garner \nand 2020 killing of George Floyd. \n \n95 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 96 of 147  PAGEID #: 6537\n \n568.  The Columbus Police Officers who observed and heard Mr. Kaigler knew the \norigin and meaning of those phrases. \n569.  The sun was out, and the area around Mr. Kaigler was well lit.  \n570.  Mr. Kaigler did not have any sort of weapon, and his empty hands were clearly \nvisible to the officers.   \n571.  Mr. Kaigler’s political statement did not cause any alarm or concern about their \nsafety for the group of Columbus Police Officers; indeed, when Mr. Kaigler was pepper-sprayed, \nthe other Columbus Police Officers appeared nonchalant. \n572.  After Mr. Kaigler made his statement, one of the officers, later identified as \nDefendant  Gitlitz,  casually  drew  a  canister  of  mace  or  pepper  spray  and,  without  audible \nwarning, sprayed Mr. Kaigler directly in the face at point blank range.  \n573.  This  true and accurate  copy  of  a photograph  posted by  @Cheesemaman   at \nhttps://twitter.com/Cheesemaman/status/1266788762295717888,  accurately  depicts  Defendant \nGitlitz pepper-spraying Mr. Kaigler: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n96 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 97 of 147  PAGEID #: 6538\n \n \n \n97 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 98 of 147  PAGEID #: 6539\n \n574.  After he was sprayed, Mr. Kaigler was blinded, could not breathe, and was in \nintense pain.   \n575.  Other protestors around Mr. Kaigler assisted him to a first-aid station, where his \neyes were rinsed.   \nV.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Elizabeth Koehler \n576.  During late May and early June of 2020, Ms. Koehler attended numerous protests \nin the downtown area of Columbus.   \n577.  Ms. Koehler was often pepper-sprayed as part of a group after Columbus Police \nOfficers demanded that protestors leave the street. \n578.  On at least six occasions, Ms. Koehler was pepper-sprayed when she was standing \non the sidewalk after the streets had been cleared. \n579.  On May 30, 2020, Ms. Koehler was attending a protest near the intersection of \nBroad and High Streets. \n580.  Columbus Police Officers had then established a barricade across Broad Street \nnear Third Avenue, and Broad and High Streets were completely blocked to vehicular traffic \naround their intersection. \n581.  Columbus Police Officers wished to use violence against the protestors because \nthey harbored animosity towards the political message of the protestors. \n582.  To manufacture an opportunity for that violence, throughout the day Columbus \nPolice Officers would periodically move west down Broad Street from their barricade and clear \nthe street of protestors by pepper-spraying them, driving them back to the sidewalks on both \nsides of the street.   \n \n98 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 99 of 147  PAGEID #: 6540\n \n583.  Because Broad Street was blocked off, there was no danger and no reason for \nBroad Street to be cleared of protestors. \n584.  In herding the protestors, Columbus Police Officers intended to provoke them into \nfighting back, which the Officers would then use to justify increased violence. \n585.  At  approximately  5:00  p.m.,  Ms.  Koehler  was  driven  to  the  sidewalk  by \nColumbus Police Officers using pepper spray as part of their periodic street clearing. \n586.  Ms. Koehler was then positioned on the sidewalk on the south side of Broad \nStreet in front of the Ohio Statehouse. \n587.  Broad  Street  was  then  completely  clear,  and  Columbus  Police  Officers  had \nreturned to behind their barricade. \n588.  Ms. Koehler observed a Black female enter the street from the opposite (north) \nside of Broad. \n589.  It is part of the ethos of many protestors that White protestors are supposed to \nplace themselves between Columbus Police Officers and Black protestors in the expectation that \nthat Columbus Police Officers are far less likely to use force on White individuals; consequently, \nMs. Koehler entered the street intending to place herself between the police and the Black \nwoman.   \n590.  After Ms. Koehler had taken five or six steps into the street, a Columbus Police \nOfficer fired a tear gas canister directly at her, hitting her in the leg. \n591.  When  the  tear  gas  canister  was  shot  at  Ms.  Koehler,  there  were  no  other \nindividuals in her vicinity that could possibly have been a target and an ample clear area in the \nstreet for Columbus Police Officers to fire a canister without hitting a person. \n592.  The tear gas canister hit her with such force that it inflicted significant pain.   \n \n99 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 100 of 147  PAGEID #: 6541\n \nW.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Rebecca Lamey \n593.  On May 31, 2020, Ms. Lamey, along with two friends, participated in a peaceful \nprotest for hours. \n594.  At 7:54 p.m., Columbus Police Officers abruptly decided to stop the protest. \n595.  At that point, Ms. Lamey and other protestors were on their knees, with their \nhands up, on the sidewalk. \n596.  Columbus Police Officers ordered the protestors to leave and appeared to be ready \nto use force against them. \n597.  Protestors started running in fear of the force, with some getting knocked down \nand trampled. \n598.  Ms. Lamey and her two friends hung back to avoid getting separated or knocked \ndown. \n599.  Ms. Lamey was filming on her cellphone, which she was holding well above her \nwaist, and walking backwards while keeping an eye on her friends. \n600.  A  Columbus  Police  Officer  turned  the  corner  and,  without  warning,  shot  a \nwooden bullet at Ms. Lamey, hitting her hand, knocking the cellphone to the ground. \n601.  The use of wooden bullets against non-violent protestors was authorized and \ndirected by Defendants Sergeant Scott Bray and Sergeant Brian Bruce. \n602.  When Ms. Lamey bent over to pick up her cellphone, she was shot four more \ntimes; around the same time, her friend was hit by wooden bullet in the back of the head, neck, \nand upper arm. \n603.  Based on the location where the wooden bullet hit Ms. Lamey, it must have been \ndirectly fired at her, rather than “skip-fired” off the ground. \n \n100 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 101 of 147  PAGEID #: 6542\n \n604.  Ms. Lamey and a friend ran to a building half a block away, and he left the stairs \nthere to get some ice for her injury. \n605.  Moments after the friend returned with the ice and applied it to Ms. Lamey’s \nhand, he screamed, “Get behind the pillar!,” as several unmarked vans approached. \n606.  The  van  doors  opened  and  two  Columbus  Police  Officers  opened  fire  with \nwooden bullets on Ms. Lamey, her friend, and two others, striking them. \n607.  A true and accurate video of the moment Ms. Lamey was hit by the wooden \nbullets  (double  click  to  play  or  click  the  link  \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/dmu6uucrkhxmkim/Video.MOV?dl=0)  and  true  and  accurate \npictures of the swelling on Ms. Lamey’s hand and wrist and a wooden bullet which had been \nfired by Columbus Police Officers are below. \n \n101 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 102 of 147  PAGEID #: 6543\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n102 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 103 of 147  PAGEID #: 6544\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n103 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 104 of 147  PAGEID #: 6545\n \n \n608.  The swelling took so long to go down and the pain remained so bad that Ms. \nLamey went to an Emergency Room a few days later, had X-rays, and learned that no bones \nwere broken. \n609.  Ms. Lamey has not yet recovered the full use of her hand. \nX.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Ricky Lee Lane \n610.  On  the  evening  of  May  29,  2020,  Mr.  Lane  joined  the  ongoing  protests  in \ndowntown Columbus.  \n611.  Mr. Lane works full time as a security operations center operator.  He is also a \nfreelance photographer. \n612.  Mr. Lane attended the protests to observe what was happening, take photographs, \nand participate in peaceful protests of police racism and violence, locally and nationwide. \n \n104 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 105 of 147  PAGEID #: 6546\n \n613.  Shortly after 8:40 p.m., a group of Columbus Police Officer assigned to the \nbicycle team, including Defendant Officer Phillip Walls, gathered on North  Ludlow Street, \nadjacent to the Columbus Police headquarters building.   \n614.  At  that  time,  Defendant  Sergeant  Christopher  Capretta  (“Defendant  Sgt. \nCapretta”) told the officers, including Defendant Officer Walls, to don gas masks.   \n615.  Defendant Sgt. Capretta shouted instructions to the officers that “the group at \nBroad and High is gonna move. They are not gonna stay there. . . . When we get up there we are \ngonna move them by any means necessary.”   \n616.  He then added, less forcefully, “reasonably necessary,” and told the officers, “Get \nyour mace ready.” \n617.  After giving these orders, Defendants Sgt. Capretta, Officer Walls, and the other \nbicycle team officers rode their bicycles onto Broad Street, approaching the southwest corner of \nBroad Street and High Street from the west. \n618.  As the bicycle unit approached High Street, whatever “group” Defendant Sgt. \nCapretta had referred to in his orders had largely or entirely left the area.   \n619. What Defendant Sgt. Capretta, Defendant Officer Walls, and the other bicycle team \nofficers encountered instead was a handful of individuals on the south sidewalk of Broad Street. \n620.  A few of the individuals were holding signs; others were clearly suffering from \nthe effects of chemical agents that had already been deployed. \n621.  None of these individuals were blocking traffic in the street or on the sidewalk. \n622.  Despite the lack of any apparent threat or illegal activity among the individuals on \nthe sidewalk, Defendant Officer Walls and the other bicycle team officers dismounted from their \n \n105 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 106 of 147  PAGEID #: 6547\n \nbicycles, brought them onto the sidewalk, and began attacking with their bicycles and chemical \nspray any individuals they encountered. \n623.  At the time Defendant Officer Walls reached the sidewalk, Mr. Lane was assisting \nan older Black woman who had apparently already been pepper-sprayed.   \n624.  Defendant Officer Walls approached Mr. Lane and the woman.   \n625.  Defendant Officer Walls was easily able to see and hear what Mr. Lane was \ndoing, including telling the woman to “keep blinking.” \n626.  Defendant Officer Walls nevertheless sprayed pepper spray in the faces of both \nMr. Lane and the woman he was assisting, resulting in immediate pain and burning in Mr. \nLane’s eyes. \n627.  A true and accurate representation of Mr. Lane being sprayed is reflected on this \nvideo (click the link to play):  \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/bx35jx2hnxxzncg/Ex.%20P123B.mp4?dl=0.  \n628.  Mr. Lane left the protest shortly after being pepper-sprayed as a result of the \nDefendants’ actions. \n629.  On the following evening, May 30, 2020, Mr. Lane decided to return to the \ndowntown area in another attempt to document the protests with his camera. \n630.  When Mr. Lane reached the Short North area, at approximately 7:30 p.m., a group \nof Columbus Police Officers was marching north on High Street, accompanied by some Franklin \nCounty Sheriff’s Office deputies, and had reached the area between East Lincoln Street and \nButtles Avenue. \n631.  At the time Mr. Lane reached the area, a crowd of protesters was facing the \nofficers who were marching north. \n \n106 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 107 of 147  PAGEID #: 6548\n \n632.   Mr. Lane gradually made his way toward the front of the crowd so he could take \nphotographs. \n633.  Due to his experience the previous night, he was wearing goggles to protect from \nchemical agents and a protective vest he sometimes uses when taking photographs in potentially \ndangerous areas. \n634.  The vest was prominently marked with the word “PRESS.” \n635.  When Mr. Lane reached the front of the crowd, he could see that both Columbus \nPolice officers and Franklin County sheriff’s deputies were subjecting the peaceful crowd to \nthrown canisters of tear gas and flash-bang grenades and firing wooden and rubber projectiles \ninto the crowd.  \n636.  Mr. Lane did not observe any violent or threatening conduct from the crowd \nprovoking a response of this kind. \n637.  The officers holding the projectile launchers appeared to be Columbus Police \nofficers, as they were wearing protective gear marked “police” and were primarily dressed in \nwhite Columbus Police uniform shirts under black protective gear. \n638.  A true and accurate representation of the group of Columbus Police Officers and \nFranklin County Sheriff’s Office deputies in the Short North area is reflected in the photograph \nbelow, taken by Mr. Lane. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n107 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 108 of 147  PAGEID #: 6549\n \n \n639.   Mr. Lane began photographing the line of officers as they continued to push the \ncrowd north using chemical agents, grenades, and projectiles.   \n640.  As he took a photograph, he was struck in the chest with a direct-fired wooden \nprojectile.   \n641.  He picked up the projectile and turned to run from the officers’ attack. \n642.  After turning to run, Mr. Lane was struck by additional wooden projectiles in his \nupper right thigh and buttock area, causing him intense pain and forcing him to limp instead of \nrunning. \n643.  Shortly after being struck from behind, Mr. Lane left the area of the protests \nbecause he no longer felt safe, even in his protective gear, and because he could no longer walk \ncorrectly due to the continued pain and limited motion in his right leg.           \nY.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Nadia Lynch \n \n108 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 109 of 147  PAGEID #: 6550\n \n644.  On  Saturday,  May  30,  2020,  at  approximately  11:30  a.m.,  Ms.  Lynch  was \nattending the protest at the intersection of Broad and High Streets in downtown Columbus. \n645.  The intersection had been taken over by Columbus Police Officers, who had \nformed a box at the intersection with lines of officers facing protestors. \n646.  The intersection had long been closed to vehicular traffic that afternoon, and \nmany Columbus Police Officers were milling around in the middle of the street. \n647.  The Columbus Police Officers facing the protestors were wearing black helmets, \nblack gas masks, and black military style tactical clothing. \n648.  Ms. Lynch stepped up to greet other protestors on the other side of the police line, \ntaking a photo of other protestors and displaying the sign she had brought to the event. \n649.  Columbus Police Officers then began forming a line with their bicycles right next \nto Ms. Lynch, and she realized she was in a bad position.  \n  650.  Ms. Lynch then decided to go around and started walking back to her group of \nfriends on the curb.   \n651.  On her way back to the curb, Ms. Lynch was grabbed by Defendant Officer \nShawn Dye and thrown down, causing her head to hit the ground. \n652.  Following  the  lead  of  Officer  Dye,  Defendant  Officers  Holly  Kanode  and \nShannon Schmid began to attack Ms. Lynch while she was lying on the ground. \n653.  While on top of Ms. Lynch, Officer Dye used his closed fist to strike Ms. Lynch \nwhile she was lying compliantly on the ground and not resisting arrest.   \n654.  The officers pulled Ms. Lynch’s hands behind her back and zip-tied them. \n655.  Before using force on her, no officer ever said anything to Ms. Lynch or yelled \nany commands. \n \n109 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 110 of 147  PAGEID #: 6551\n \n656.  All of these events took place in an open, well lit, and relatively calm area. \n657.  Following Ms. Lynch’s arrest, Defendant Officer Schmid was aware that Ms. \nLynch had not committed a crime and that he, Officer Kanode, and Officer Dye had no grounds \nto attack and arrest her.   \n658.  Officer Schmid was also aware that Officer Dye had used excessive force against \nMs. Lynch when he threw Ms. Lynch to the ground, causing her to hit her head, and when he \ndelivered a closed fist strike to Ms. Lynch.   \n659.  In order to cover for himself and the other three Officers, in particular Officer \nDye, Officer Schmid knowingly and intentionally fabricated a version of events that would \njustify the false arrest of Ms. Lynch and the excessive force.   \n660.  Officer Schmid subsequently intentionally and knowingly falsified a U-10-100 \nform, an official government document, by making the following false statements in the form: \na.  That Ms. Lynch had “grabbed an unknown Officer by his riot gear and \nthrew him to the ground.”   \nb.  That as “the arrest team was attempting to take Ms. Lynch into custody, \nshe pulled away from Officers were trying to arrest her.”  \n661.  Video footage of the assault on Ms. Lynch conclusively shows that neither of the \nabove allegations were true.  \n662.  At the time Officer Schmid falsified the U-10-100 form, he was aware that this \nform would make it more likely that Ms. Lynch would be prosecuted for crimes she had not \ncommitted.   \n663.  He was further aware that such a criminal prosecution could cause Ms. Lynch to \nbe jailed and face other criminal penalties, that she would need to hire an attorney and post bail, \n \n110 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 111 of 147  PAGEID #: 6552\n \nand  that  criminal  convictions  could  have  a  long-term  effect  on  Ms.  Lynch’s  educational, \npersonal, and professional opportunities.   \n664.  Following the incident, Defendant Officer Dye filled out a Columbus Division of \nPolice Use of Force Report, an official government document. \n665.  In order to cover up his actions, in that report he falsely stated that he had placed \nhis hands on Ms. Lynch’s back and attempted to guide her to a different side of the barricade.   \n666.  He then stated that “Ms. Lynch then became irate, yelling and cursing at Officer \nDye.  Ms. Lynch then pulled away from Officer Dye, spun around to face him, attempted to \nremove Officer Dye’s gas mask from his face.” He then stated that after he had taken Ms. Lynch \nto the ground “she continued attempting to remove his gas mask.”   \n667.  Video footage of the assault on Ms. Lynch conclusively shows that Officer Dye’s \nclaims in his Use of Force Report were untrue.   \n668. Ms. Lynch, who is 5 feet 3 inches tall, did not at any time throw an officer to the \nground by his riot gear, attack Defendant Officer Dye, attempt to remove Officer Dye’s gas \nmask, pose a threat to a police officer, or resist arrest. \n669. Ms. Lynch was then taken to Jackson Pike where she was slated and spent two hours \nin jail before she bonded out. \n670. Ms. Lynch suffered physical injuries due to the assault and damage to her physical \nproperty.  \n671.  In order to effectuate Ms. Lynch’s arrest and take her to jail, that same day, \nDefendant Officer Robert Reffitt filed two sworn criminal complaints against Ms. Lynch.  \n672.  In the first criminal complaint, Defendant Officer Reffitt swore that Ms. Lynch \nhad committed the second-degree misdemeanor crime of resisting arrest when she “grabbed an \n \n111 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 112 of 147  PAGEID #: 6553\n \nofficer and took him to the ground when she refused to disperse from Broad and High Street \nduring a protest that became unlawful.” \n673.  In  the  second  criminal  complaint,  Officer  Reffitt  swore  that  Ms.  Lynch  had \ncommitted the fourth-degree misdemeanor crime of disorderly conduct when she threw “water \nfilled bottles at police during a protest that became unlawful.”   \n674.  Video evidence conclusively and accurately shows that both charges filed by \nOfficer Reffitt were complete fabrications and utterly without probable cause; a true and accurate \ncopy  of  the  video  is  shown  below  (double  click  to  play  or  click  the  link \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/nr6t9y2ph8yydv7/IMG_0113.mov?dl=0). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n112 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 113 of 147  PAGEID #: 6554\n \n675.  At the time Officer Reffitt falsified the sworn criminal complaints, he was aware \nthat  this  criminal  prosecution  could  cause  Ms.  Lynch  to  be  jailed  and  face  other  criminal \npenalties, that she would need to hire an attorney and post bail, and that criminal convictions \ncould  have  a  long-term  effect  on  Ms.  Lynch’s  educational,  personal,  and  professional \nopportunities.   \n676.  Defendant Officer Reffitt falsified these criminal charges in order to cover up \nOfficer Dye’s violent attack on Ms. Lynch and her false arrest.    \n677.  The fabricated criminal charges against Ms. Lynch were dismissed on June 15, \n2020, with bond and fees refunded. \nZ.  Mistreatment of Mia Mogavero   \n678.  On the morning of May 30, 2020, Ms. Mogavero and several friends arrived at the \nprotest against police brutality and racial injustice taking place outside the Ohio Statehouse.  \n679.  Ms. Mogavero and her friends started marching peacefully around Broad and \nHigh Streets. \n680.  Columbus  Police  Officers  started  shoving  anyone  who  was  close  to  the \nintersection.  \n681.  Columbus Police Officers who were on horseback began riding their horses onto \nthe sidewalk, pushing protestors back, and injuring some. \n682.  Ms. Mogavero observed all of this occurring and witnessed her friend, Ellen \n“Hana” Abdur-Rahim, get pepper-sprayed at close range.  \n683.  Ms. Mogavero and her friends ran for cover and turned down Pearl Alley, where \nthey noticed medics who were there to assist protestors.  \n \n113 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 114 of 147  PAGEID #: 6555\n \n684.  As Ms. Mogavero helped Ms. Abdur-Rahim and several other protestors receive \nmedical attention, they noticed approximately ten Columbus Police Officers create a “wall” and \nbegin marching down the alley.  \n685.  Protestors who were being treated and the medics began to leave from the alley. \n686.  Ms. Mogavero saw a Columbus Police Officer attempt to grab a young Black \nchild who was attempting to move his bicycle which appeared to be stuck.  \n687.  Ms. Mogavero responded by attempting to help him move the bicycle, and the \nColumbus Police Officer threw her to the ground.  \n688.  Upon hitting the ground, Ms. Mogavero’s head bounced off the pavement. \n689.  Ms. Mogavero was then pepper-sprayed by the Columbus Police Officer while \nshe lay there still on the ground, defenseless, unarmed, and suffering from what was later \ndiagnosed as a concussion. \n690.  Ms. Mogavero’s friend attempted to help her off of the ground, and a Columbus \nPolice Officer pepper-sprayed the friend at close range. \n691.  As a proximate result of the excessive force, Ms. Mogavero suffered a concussion \nand chemical burns on her left arm, on the left side of her face, and on her neck.  \nAA.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Michael Moses \n692.  In the early evening of May 30, 2020, Moses decided to attend the protests which \nwere occurring downtown.  \n693.  Somewhere  between  8  and  8:30  PM  that  day,  Mr.  Moses  left  his  house  in \nClintonville and travelled on foot south on High Street.  He brought  a sign  with  him that \nexpressed his views on police misconduct.  \n \n114 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 115 of 147  PAGEID #: 6556\n \n694.  Near the Ohio State University Campus, Mr. Moses joined with other protestors \nwho were heading downtown.  Together they walked south, carrying signs and chanting.  \n695.  Mr.  Moses  arrived  at  the  intersection  of  5th Avenue  and  High  Street  at \napproximately 9:00 PM. \n696.  When he arrived, Mr. Moses observed a protest taking place in the middle of High \nStreet.   \n697.  Mr. Moses decided to join the protest  and participated for approximately 15 \nminutes. \n698.  Although the individuals involved in the protest were loud and vocal, they were \npeaceful and were not throwing objects. \n699.  As he took part in the protest, Mr. Moses observed a line of Columbus Police \nOfficers across High Street near the 4th Avenue intersection.   \n700.  The Officers were approximately 50 yards from the protestors. \n701.  After 15 minutes had passed, Mr. Moses heard a muffled command from what \nseemed to be a bullhorn. \n702.  Because of the noise level in the area, Mr. Moses could not make out what the \ncommand was. \n703.  Because of this, he looked to other protestors in the area and they indicated to him \nthat he needed to head north. \n704.  Shortly thereafter, Mr. Moses started heading north on High Street.   \n705.  As he began to leave, Mr. Moses was shot in the left side and lower back with \nwooden bullets. \n \n115 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 116 of 147  PAGEID #: 6557\n \n706.  After being shot, Mr. Moses jogged north on High Street for approximately half a \nblock.  \n707.  Because his injuries were painful, after he had jogged for half a block Mr. Moses \nstopped outside of a coffee shop to examine himself to see how badly he was hurt.  \n708.  While Mr. Moses was examining himself, several officers including Defendant \nOfficer Benjamin Mackley grabbed him by his right wrist and arm and took him forcefully to the \nground causing abrasions and bruising to his face and right shoulder. \n709.  At no time did Mr. Moses offer any resistance or do anything to cause the police \nto violently take him to the ground in this fashion. \n710.  Following  the  takedown,  Mr.  Moses  was  placed  in  a  van  along  with  other \narrestees and taken to the Jackson Pike Jail facility. \n711.  Motivated by anger at the political message of Mr. Moses and the other protestors \nin the van, unknown officers driving the police van gave Mr. Moses and the others what the \npolice refer to as a “rough ride.” \n712.  This consisted of taking a sharp turn with the van causing the prisoners, who were \nhandcuffed and not strapped in, to fly across the back of the wagon. \n713.  Defendant Officer Mackley then swore out a criminal complaint charging Mr. \nMoses with a fourth-degree misdemeanor count of failing to disperse. \n714.  Mr. Moses remained at Jackson Pike until he was bonded out the following day. \n715.  On June 23, 2020, the charges against Mr. Moses were dismissed.  \nBB.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Aleta Mixon  \n \n116 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 117 of 147  PAGEID #: 6558\n \n716.  On the evening of Friday, May 29, 2020, Ms. Mixon was aware that her oldest \ndaughter, who is 20 years old, was attending a protest against police brutality in downtown \nColumbus. \n717.  After dropping a younger daughter at a different event, Ms. Mixon learned that \nthe protests her oldest daughter was attending might become dangerous.   \n718.  Ms. Mixon unsuccessfully attempted to contact her daughter by telephone and \ndrove toward downtown Columbus. \n719.  Ms. Mixon had trouble driving to the vicinity where she believed her daughter \nwas and ultimately, around 9:00 p.m., parked her car on State Street, near the Ohio Statehouse. \n720.  Ms. Mixon left her vehicle to attempt to find her daughter and saw that Columbus \nDivision of Police officers in riot gear were massing in the street. \n721.  Ms. Mixon approached a White female officer who was not in riot gear and was \nstanding separate from the officers who were massing and began to ask the female officer for \nassistance in locating her daughter.   \n722.  As the female officer was about to reply to her request, Defendant Officer Paul \nBadois charged toward her and sprayed her in the face with pepper spray.   \n723.  The female officer confronted the male officer and said words to the effect of, \n“Why the fuck did you do that? She was just asking for help.”   \n724.  Ms. Mixon began screaming from the pain of the pepper spray and calling for \nrelief. \n725.  Two White male officers, including Defendant Officer Badois, then approached \nand sprayed Ms. Mixon again.  \n \n117 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 118 of 147  PAGEID #: 6559\n \n726.   Ms. Mixon fell to a seated position on the ground from the effects of the pepper \nspray, and she was sitting out of the street, on the sidewalk, still calling for help.  \n727.  One of the White male officers continued spraying her, and she attempted to \nstand. \n728.  As Ms. Mixon attempted to stand up, the officer shoved her off the sidewalk and \nover the curb.   \n729.  Ms. Mixon felt intense pain and a snap in her leg.   \n730.  The officer who had shoved Ms. Mixon then stood over her and told her, “That’s \nwhat you get for your protest, bitch,” and he stepped hard on her knee, before walking away. \n731.  Another White male officer who had not been involved in the use of excessive \nforce arrived and assisted Ms. Mixon, calling an ambulance and giving her advice for dealing \nwith the effects of the spray. \n732.  Ms. Mixon was transported to Grant Hospital, where she was given X-rays and \ntold she needed emergency surgery due to critical tears in a major tendon in her leg.   \n733.  The X-rays also showed that Ms. Mixon’s  kneecap had been shattered, with \nmultiple fractures in the bone. \n734.  Ms. Mixon’s surgery was delayed until May 31, 2020, due to the urgent medical \nneeds of others injured in the protests.  \n735.  Ms. Mixon was hospitalized until Tuesday, June 2, 2020, after which she was \nreleased, with significant restrictions on her mobility.  \n736.  Ms. Mixon is uncertain whether she will recover full use of her leg, and she \nexpects to be unable to work for a period of several months or longer; a true and accurate picture \nof her leg post-surgery, including permanent scarring, is shown below. \n \n118 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 119 of 147  PAGEID #: 6560\n \n \n \n \n119 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 120 of 147  PAGEID #: 6561\n \nCC.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Darrell Mullen \n737.  On Tuesday, June 2, 2020, at around 1:30 a.m., Darrell Mullen was walking by \nhimself northbound on the sidewalk on the east side of North High Street.   \n738.  Mr. Mullen was walking home from a friend’s house on Oakland Avenue to his \nresidence on Findley Avenue.   \n739.  On May 30, 2020, Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther had issued an executive \norder instituting a city-wide curfew which required most residents to remain indoors from 10 \np.m. to 6 a.m. and was to remain in effect until he rescinded it.  \n740.   The executive order stated that being outside in violation of the curfew was an \nunspecified degree misdemeanor. \n741.  As  of  the  time  that  Mr.  Mullen  was  walking  home,  North  High  Street  was \ndeserted.   \n742.  Near the intersection of High Street and Oakland Avenue, Mr. Mullen observed \nfour or five police cars drive past him going northbound on High Street.  \n   743.  Upon observing the police cars, Mr. Mullen made no effort to flee and continued \nwalking northbound on High Street. \n744.  Mr. Mullen then observed at least one of the police cars execute a U-turn and \ndrive towards him. \n745.  Again, Mr. Mullen made no attempt to flee and watched the police vehicle drive \nup to him. \n746.  At this point, several Columbus Police Officers, later identified as Defendant \nOfficers Thomas Hammel and Michael Dunlevy and Defendant Sergeants Brian Steele and \nBenjamin Messerly, got out of the police cruiser and began running at Mr. Mullen. \n \n120 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 121 of 147  PAGEID #: 6562\n \n747.  At no time did any Columbus Police Officer order Mr. Mullen to stop, give Mr. \nMullen any verbal commands, or inform Mr. Mullen that he was under arrest.   \n748.  Instead, Defendant Officer Hammel violently tackled Mr. Mullen, taking him face \ndown on the sidewalk, and then applied pressure to the back of his head, grinding his face into \nthe pavement. \n749.  Shortly after that tackling, three more officers, including Dunlevy, Sgt. Steele, \nand Sgt. Messerly, got on top of Mr. Mullen and began striking his back and legs with their \nknees. \n750.  Mr. Mullen was quickly handcuffed, but officers continued to apply pressure to \nhis back and legs, with Officer Hammel continuing to apply pressure to the back and side of his \nneck, pushing his face into the ground and preventing him from talking. \n751.  When he was finally able to talk, Mr. Mullen told the officers that he had just \nbeen walking home, and Officer Hammel replied, “I know exactly where you live, is your \ngirlfriend out of jail yet?”   \n752.  As a proximate result of the excessive use of force, Mr. Mullen suffered facial \nabrasions, bruising, and a significant injury to his leg that left him unable to walk. \n753.  A true and accurate picture of his facial injuries is below: \n \n121 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 122 of 147  PAGEID #: 6563\n \n \n754.  Mr. Mullen was then charged with violating curfew and taken to jail.   \n755.  Because of his leg injury, when Mr. Mullen arrived at the jail, he was checked out \nby a nurse, who placed him in a wheelchair and recommended x-rays. \n \n122 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 123 of 147  PAGEID #: 6564\n \n756.  When Mr. Mullen was released later that day at approximately 1:00 p.m., he was \nreleased on crutches.   \n757.  Mr. Mullen was not charged with resisting arrest. \n758.  All charges against Mr. Mullen were subsequently dismissed.   \n759.  Mr. Mullen has been unable to use his injured leg and as a result has been unable \nto work or care for himself.   \n760.  On Friday, June 5, 2020, a lawsuit was filed against Defendant City alleging that \nthe indefinite, city-wide curfew was unconstitutional.   \n761.  Hours after the lawsuit was filed, Mayor Ginther rescinded the curfew.  \n762.  On Tuesday, June 9, Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein dismissed all criminal \ncharges for curfew violations brought under Mayor Ginther’s executive order, which included \nthe criminal charge brought against Mr. Mullen.  \nDD.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Leeanne Pagliaro \n763.  On the morning of Saturday, May 30, 2020, Ms. Pagliaro headed to downtown \nColumbus from her home in the Olde Town East area of Columbus with her wife, Plaintiff \nSummer Schultz, and an African-American female friend to participate in peaceful protests \nagainst the killing of George Floyd and general police misconduct disproportionately inflicted \nupon people of color. \n764.  Ms. Pagliaro, her wife, and her friend intentionally decided to go to the protests in \nthe morning with the hope of avoiding any potential conflicts or problems from the police that \nthey heard happened to peaceful protesters who demonstrated later during the evenings and/or \nafter dark. \n \n123 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 124 of 147  PAGEID #: 6565\n \n765.  They arrived downtown at approximately 11:00 a.m., parked on Long Street and \nheaded toward Broad and High Streets. \n766.  They stopped in the front of the Statehouse on the east side of Broad Street to \nlisten to speakers. \n767.  There was a crowd of people on the Statehouse lawn listening to speakers on a \nstage and people casually walking around and assembling in the general area of Broad and High \nStreets. \n768.  Ms. Pagliaro remained on the east side of High Street while Plaintiff Schultz and \nher friend crossed to the west side of High Street to take pictures of the Statehouse and of the \ncrowd listening to speakers on the lawn. \n769.  Plaintiff Schultz and her friend then returned to join Ms. Pagliaro. \n770.  While they were initially standing on a sidewalk crowded with protestors, they \nwere forced onto the side when the protestors started marching. \n771.  Ms. Pagliaro noticed more Columbus Police Officers were arriving, including \nunits that looked like SWAT teams, and the Officers started forming a line across High Street. \n772.  Ms. Pagliaro heard some type of commotion nearby, some protestors began to \nscream loudly, and she became separated from her wife and friend. \n773.  Columbus Police Officers were standing with their bicycles in front of the crowd \nand close to Ms. Pagliaro, but she purposely did not talk or speak to the police at all. \n774.  Ms. Pagliaro was kneeling in front of other protesters but was being pushed so she \nhad to stand up to avoid being trampled. \n775.  She was pushed up to the line of Columbus Police Officers on bicycles, but she \ndid not make physical contact with them or speak to them. \n \n124 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 125 of 147  PAGEID #: 6566\n \n776.  Ms.  Pagliaro  watched  Columbus  Police  Officers  pull,  without  provocation,  a \nwoman over the bikes and then repeatedly punched her head into the ground. \n777.  Without any warning, Columbus Police Officers turned and sprayed Ms. Pagliaro \ndirectly in the face from less than three feet away with what she believes was pepper spray, and \nshe felt her eyes burn, started coughing, and found it difficult to breathe. \n778.  The  use  of  chemical  agents  and  munitions  to  disperse  the  crowd  had  been \nauthorized and directed by Defendants Commander David Griffith and Sergeant Caroline Castro. \n779.  She was dragged out of the crowd by strangers who took her to a medical station. \n780.  While  Ms.  Pagliaro  was  receiving  medical  attention,  she  was  again,  without \nwarning, sprayed directly in the face by a different Columbus Police Officer using a substance \nthat she came to believe was pepper spray. \n781.  By then, Ms. Pagliaro’s eyes were burning badly and watering, she could not \nbreathe, she continued to cough, and her throat was hurting. \n782.  Ms. Pagliaro did not know where her wife and friend were. \n783.  Ms. Pagliaro and others moved away from the medic station, her wife called her, \nand they reunited at the medic station. \n784.  When Ms. Pagliaro could finally open her eyes, the group moved away from the \nmedic station to let others be treated and they were sprayed again. \n785.  Ms. Pagliaro, Ms. Schultz, and others helped pull protesters out of the crowd who \nhad been sprayed and helped them get to medic stations. \n786.  Someone in the group looked to see what time it was and remarked, “Wow, it’s \nnot even noon yet,” or words to that effect. \n \n125 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 126 of 147  PAGEID #: 6567\n \n787.  Ms. Pagliaro left the downtown area and returned home with the people she \narrived with. \n788.  Ms.  Pagliaro  felt  the  spray  in  her  eyes  and  throat  long  after  she  had  left \ndowntown. \n789.  The spray remained on her clothes and book bag even after cleaning. \n790.  Ms. Pagliaro was shocked, disappointed, and in a state of disbelief because of the \nmistreatment she had received from Columbus Police Officers when she had purposely not \nuttered a word to them or done anything to provoke being pepper-sprayed the first time, let alone \nthe second and third times. \nEE.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Torrie Ruffin \n \n791.  Ms. Ruffin attended the protests in downtown Columbus near the Statehouse each \nday from May 30, 2020, until approximately June 5, 2020. \n792.  Around 11:00 a.m. on May 30, 2020, at the intersection of Broad and High \nStreets, Ms. Ruffin had linked arms with other protestors and stood in front of Columbus Police \nOfficers. \n793.  Ms. Ruffin observed several Columbus Police Officer snipers standing on top of \nbuildings surrounding the protests. \n794.  Ms. Ruffin was in the second row of the linked protestors; in front of her, she \nobserved Columbus Police Officers using their bikes to force protestors to move. \n795.  Without  prior warning  or a dispersal  order,  Columbus Police Officers began \npepper-spraying the group of linked protestors. \n796.  The  use  of  chemical  agents  and  munitions  to  disperse  the  crowd  had  been \nauthorized and directed by Defendants Commander David Griffith and Sergeant Caroline Castro. \n \n126 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 127 of 147  PAGEID #: 6568\n \n797.  A Columbus Police Officer who sprayed Ms. Ruffin was standing a few feet away \nfrom her face, and Ms. Ruffin had to remove herself from the group to flush out her eyes while \nsitting on the sidewalk. \n798.  Ms. Ruffin then joined a large group of protestors sitting on the curb of the \nsidewalk next to parked Columbus Police Officer cruisers, where protestors were sitting and \nchanting, “This is a peaceful protest,” in front of the Officers. \n799.  Columbus Police Officers then approached the group and pepper-sprayed them \nwithout prior warning or an order to disperse. \n800.  Columbus Police Officers pepper-sprayed downwards, towards the faces of the \nprotestors, including Ms. Ruffin. \n801.  Ms. Ruffin started coughing and crying as the pepper-spray rained down upon her \neyes and face. \n802.  Ms. Ruffin experienced a burning sensation and had to flush her eyes out again. \n803.  Ms. Ruffin then crossed the street and continued protesting on the sidewalk. \n804.  Columbus Police Officers then approached her group on the sidewalk with their \nhorses, using the horses to push the protestors who were standing on the sidewalk up against the \nnearby buildings. \n805.  At that point, there were virtually no protestors in the streets, and Ms. Ruffin and \nother protestors were on the sidewalk.  \n806.  Columbus Police Officers began deploying tear-gas and smoke bombs against the \nprotestors. \n807.  The  onslaught  of  tear-gas  and  smoke  bombs  continued  for  more  than  five \nminutes. \n \n127 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 128 of 147  PAGEID #: 6569\n \n808.  Columbus  Police  Officers  then  drove  through  the  streets  and  ordered  the \nprotestors to disperse, threatening arrest for failure to disperse. \n809.  Columbus Police Officers continued to use tear-gas and smoke bombs to get \nprotestors to leave the downtown area, and the video below fairly and accurately depicts what \nMs.  Ruffin  observed  (double  click  to  play  or  click  the  link). \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/e0arxn2syb3j5cm/IMG_2051%20%281%29.MOV?dl=0.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n810.  Ms. Ruffin’s exposure to the pepper-spray, tear gas, and smoke bombs caused her \nto choke, cry, cough, and experience breathing issues. \n \n128 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 129 of 147  PAGEID #: 6570\n \nFF.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Summer Schultz  \n811.  On Saturday, May 30, 2020, at about 11:00 a.m., Ms. Schultz headed toward \ndowntown Columbus from her home in the Olde Town East area of Columbus with her wife, \nPlaintiff Leeanne Pagliaro, and an African-American female friend to participate in peaceful \ndemonstrations against the killing of George Floyd and police misconduct in general that is \ndisproportionately inflicted upon people of color. \n812.  They intentionally decided to go to the protests in the morning with the hope of \navoiding any potential conflicts or problems from the police that they heard happened to peaceful \nprotesters who demonstrated later during the evenings and/or after dark. \n813.  They arrived downtown around 11:15 a.m. and parked on East Long Street. \n814.  They walked to where peaceful demonstrators had gathered, near Broad and High \nStreets.  \n815.  They walked down the east side of High Street and stopped in front of the Ohio \nStatehouse. \n816.  Protestors  were  gathered  on  the  Statehouse  lawn  listening  to  speakers,  some \nsitting and some standing, and all were peaceful. \n817.  Ms. Schultz and her friend wanted to take pictures of the Statehouse and the \nprotestors, so they decided to cross to the west side of High Street to get a better picture. \n818.  As they were taking pictures, Ms. Schultz noticed more Columbus Police Officers \nwere arriving. \n819.  Within about five minutes, the number of Columbus Police Officers had increased \nconsiderably, and Ms. Schultz noticed there were police snipers on the scene. \n \n129 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 130 of 147  PAGEID #: 6571\n \n820.  Columbus  Police  Officers  with  bicycles  started  to  form  a  line  blocking  the \nintersection of High and Broad Streets. \n821.  Ms.  Schultz  and  her  friend  returned  to  the  other  side  of  High  Street  where \nPlaintiff Pagliaro was located. \n822.  Ms.  Schultz  could  hear that something was happening  near  Broad and High \nStreets. \n823.  All of a sudden, her throat felt closed up, her eyes started burning, and she \nrealized something was being sprayed at her. \n824.  The  use  of  chemical  agents  and  munitions  to  disperse  the  crowd  had  been \nauthorized and directed by Defendants Commander David Griffith and Sergeant Caroline Castro. \n825.  It was difficult to see and to hear, and in the confusion she was separated from \nMs. Pagliaro. \n826.  Columbus Police Officers on bicycles lined up next to the sidewalk where she \nwas standing, and they eventually brought their bikes onto the sidewalk. \n827.  Columbus Police Officers told protestors to get on the sidewalk, but there was not \nenough room for everyone to fit.  \n828.  As protestors were trying to get on the sidewalk, something was again sprayed, \nand Ms. Schultz was sprayed in the face. \n829.  Ms. Schultz’s eyes were burning, and someone rinsed them with saline and a milk \nof magnesia solution.  \n830.  Protestors tried to get on the sidewalk as instructed by the Columbus Police \nOfficers, but they spilled into the street near the corner of Broad and High Streets. \n \n130 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 131 of 147  PAGEID #: 6572\n \n831.  Ms. Schultz saw Columbus Police Officers grab a young African-American male \n– he appeared to be a boy or a teenager – by his shirt and attempt to pull him over a bike. \n832.  White protestors attempted to shield the child from the Columbus Police Officers \nto protect him, because the police were not acting as aggressively toward White people. \n833.  Ms.  Schultz  was  approximately  ten  feet  from  the  line  of  Columbus  Police \nOfficers, and it was still difficult to see and breathe. \n834.  Ms.  Schultz  and  others  turned  to  leave  and  move  away  from  the  street  and \nColumbus Police Officers, and she heard protestors repeating, “Walk, do not run; walk, do not \nrun.” \n835.  Ms. Schultz walked away from Columbus Police Officers with her back turned to \nthem and the street. \n836.  Ms. Schultz was suddenly hit with something so forceful that it knocked her off \nher feet to the ground, and, when she tried to get up, she could not. \n837.  Ms. Schultz tried to stand on her feet again, stumbled, and could not get up; she \nwas disoriented, in pain, and could barely see. \n838.  Ms. Shultz felt someone pull her up and help her walk and soon realized that she \nknew the person. \n839.  The person helped Ms. Schultz walk down Broad Street past a tall building with \nscaffolding (the Rhodes Office Tower), toward Third Street, and down an alley. \n840.  Ms. Schultz used her cell phone to call her wife, Plaintiff  Pagliaro, and she \nanswered. \n841.  Ms. Schultz was reunited with her wife and friend, and they left downtown. \n \n131 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 132 of 147  PAGEID #: 6573\n \n842.  Ms. Schultz believes all of the events from the time they arrived downtown until \nthe time they left took place within about 30 to 45 minutes. \n843.  Ms. Schultz later realized that she had been shot in the buttocks with wooden \nbullets. \n844.  Ms. Schultz was in significant pain from being shot.  \n845.  Ms. Schultz could not sit down comfortably for days, was forced to lie on her \nside, applied ice to reduce the swelling, used over-the-counter pain medication, and took Epsom \nsalt baths to alleviate the pain and swelling. \n846.  The wooden bullets left a large round indentation on her buttocks that turned blue \nwith obvious bruising and swelling, and Plaintiff Pagliaro took pictures on the day of the incident \nand periodically thereafter; a true and accurate copy of one of those pictures is below. \n \n132 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 133 of 147  PAGEID #: 6574\n \n \n847.  Ms. Schultz was in pain for more than a week, and bruises, which were the size of \na disk or hockey puck, were visible for weeks. \n848.  Ms.  Schultz  remains  disturbed  about  being  shot  with  wooden  bullets  while \npeacefully walking away from the police; suffering the smell of tear gas and inhaling pepper \nspray while she was peaceably protesting; hearing the sound of protestors screaming; and the \nunprovoked  abuse  by  Columbus  Police  Officers  that  she  witnessed  against  other  peaceful \nprotesters on the May 30, 2020. \n \n133 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 134 of 147  PAGEID #: 6575\n \nGG.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Reverend Clarressa Thompson \n849.  Plaintiff Reverend Clarressa Thompson (“Rev. Thompson”) preaches as a non-\naffiliated community-based minister and provides clergy services to various community partners, \nas well as officiating weddings, funerals, and baptisms in and around Columbus Ohio. \n850.  Because of a 2014 work accident, Rev. Thompson is affected by an auto-immune \ndisorder that impacts several of her key body systems. \n851.  This  auto-immune  disorder  predisposes  Rev.  Thompson  to  suffer  significant \neffects of pepper spray and other crowd control chemical agents. \n852.  Prior to May 29, 2020, Rev. Thompson had attended several social justice protests \nin Ohio and Kentucky regarding LGBTQ+ rights, and police misconduct.  \n853.  When  attending  protests,  Rev.  Thompson  does  so  in  her  religious  regalia \nincluding her clerical robe and collar. \n854.  On May 29, 2020, Rev. Thompson was watching the 6:00pm local news; the news \nwas covering the protests occurring downtown Columbus. \n855.  Rev. Thompson was shocked by the coverage and interactions between the police \nand protestors. \n856.  In watching the coverage, Rev. Thompson was concerned by the lack of spiritual \nleaders at the protest.  \n857.  Prior to leaving her home to go to the protest, Rev. Thompson donned her clerical \nrobes and collar, and made a sign on canvas out of materials in her home.  \n858.  The sign read “No Violence God Lives.” \n859.  Rev.  Thompson  then  drove  downtown  and  parked  her  car  just  west  of  the \nintersection at Broad Street and High Street at approximately 6:45 p.m. \n \n134 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 135 of 147  PAGEID #: 6576\n \n860.  Rev. Thompson saw the crowd of protestors marching peacefully on Broad Street \nand joined them. \n861.  Between 7:45 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. Rev. Thompson witnessed a verbal altercation \nbetween a protestor and police officer. \n862.  Rev. Thompson approached the protestor and pulled them away from the officer, \ntelling the protestor words to the effect of “we need you out here, you don’t have to go to jail.” \n863.  The protestor acknowledged Rev. Thompson, calmed down and disengaged with \nthe officer. \n864.  Rev.  Thompson  deescalated  verbal  confrontations  between  at  least  one  other \nprotestor and officer between 7:45 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. \n865.  As the protest continued, Rev. Thompson and others marched on the sidewalk \neast on Broad Street towards the Rhodes Tower office building. \n866.  Between 8:00 p.m. and 8:15 p.m., Rev. Thompson was marching with other \nprotestors on the sidewalk on the north side of East Broad Street directly in front of the Rhodes \nTower located at 30 E. Broad Street. \n867.  While on the sidewalk, Rev. Thompson saw several horse mounted police officers \nmarch by and they were flanked by street level officers. \n868.  As she was marching holding her sign, Rev. Thompson was pushed down by an \nunknown Columbus Police Officer and fell to the ground.  \n869.  Rev. Thompson was stunned by being pushed, as she had not been warned to \nmove or that force would be used against her. \n870.  She was not given any direction from the officers prior to being pushed down. \n871.  After collecting herself, Rev. Thompson continued to march with the protestors. \n \n135 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 136 of 147  PAGEID #: 6577\n \n872.  Roughly 45 minutes later, Rev. Thompson was at the northwest corner of Broad \nStreet and High Street. \n873.   While marching, a woman parked her car, and got out and was looking for her \ndaughter. \n874.  Rev. Thompson approached the woman and instructed her to leave the area, as \nshe was concerned that the situation was getting dangerous. \n875.  After a few moments, the woman agreed to leave the intersection and search for \nher daughter elsewhere. \n876.  At that point, Rev. Thompson turned around, and was sprayed in the face with \npepper spray by an unknown Columbus Police Officer. \n877.  When  she  was  sprayed,  Rev.  Thompson  was  standing  in  a  small  group  of \nprotestors who were spaced several feet apart. \n878.  Rev. Thompson was not warned that she was about to be sprayed, nor did Rev. \nThompson hear any orders to leave the area. \n879.  The spray caused extreme pain for Rev. Thompson, which lasted several minutes. \n880.  Because of her auto-immune disorder, Rev. Thompson felt residual pain in her \nface and neck for the next several days. \n881.  Shortly after collecting herself and regaining her faculties, Rev. Thompson left \nthe protest and returned home. \n882.  Rev. Thompson was so scared by the actions of the police in pushing her down \nand pepper spraying her without provocation that she did not return to the protests any of the \nnext days. \n \n136 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 137 of 147  PAGEID #: 6578\n \n883.  Rev. Thompson has not engaged in any protest since May 29, 2020, despite her \ndesire to protest for social justice. \n884.  Rev. Thompson fears that if she attends another protest that she will be subject to \nthe same violence from the police as she was subject to on May 29, 2020. \n  HH.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Amanda Weldon \n \n885.  On  the  morning  of  May  30,  2020,  Ms.  Weldon  and  her  roommate  headed \ndowntown for an organized protest against police brutality and racism.  \n886.  While attending the event and peacefully protesting, Ms. Weldon was asked to \nstand in the front line of a group of protestors to protect the minorities standing behind her as \npolice armed in riot gear began to line the streets.  \n887.  Many protestors believed that Columbus Police Officers would be less likely to \nuse  excessive  force  against  White  protestors  than  Black  protestors  and  called  for  White \nprotestors to stand between Columbus Police Officers and Black protestors. \n888.  Ms. Weldon neither acted violently nor showed any aggression.  \n889.  While peacefully protesting in front of other protestors, Ms. Weldon was maced \ntwice and pepper-sprayed once by Columbus Police Officers. \n890.  On June 1, 2020, Ms. Weldon was attending a protest near the intersection of \nNorth High Street and Lane Avenue. She was approached by a Columbus Police Officer who \nhopped out his cruiser and pointed, without shooting, what she assumed was a real gun at her. \n891.  Ms. Weldon was terrified by that incident. \n892.  Ms.  Weldon  witnessed  Columbus  Police  Officers  inflicting  pain  on  peaceful \nprotestors and was horrified by what she saw. \n \n137 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 138 of 147  PAGEID #: 6579\n \n893.  Ms. Weldon also observed a female protestor, who was handcuffed and lying on \nthe ground, be pepper-sprayed by a Columbus Police Officer. \n894.  The way in which Ms. Weldon was mistreated and the incidents of excessive use \nof force she observed generated so much anxiety and fear of being harmed that she became \nphysically ill, including vomiting after the incident on June 1, and discontinued going to protests.  \nII.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Amanda Williams \n895.  Ms. Amanda Williams (“Ms. Williams”) attended several Black Lives Matter \nprotests downtown in May and June of 2020. \n896.  On  May  28,  2020,  around  10:30  p,m,,  Ms.  Williams  was  protesting  at  the \nintersection of Broad and High Streets, where she was in the front of a crowd in the intersection. \n897.  Columbus  Police  Officers  began  using  crowd  control  devices  against  Ms. \nWilliams and the crowd, including pepper spray, tear gas, gas and/or flash bang grenades. \n898.  Around 2:00 a.m., Ms. Williams was holding a sign against police violence and \nstanding on a half wall on the sidewalk of High Street near the intersection of North High and \nEast Broad Streets with a small group of protestors. \n899.  While standing on the half wall, Division Officers approached Ms. Williams and \nthe group of protestors and pepper sprayed them point blank in the face, continuing to spray \nthem as they were running away from the area. \n900.  On the same night and the next night, May 29, 2020, Ms. Williams experienced \nbeing pepper sprayed and teargassed on multiple occasions while standing in the front of a group \nof non-violent protestors. \n901.  On  May  30,  2020,  Ms.  Williams  was  again  protesting  downtown  at  the \nintersection of East Broad and North High Streets. \n \n138 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 139 of 147  PAGEID #: 6580\n \n902.  She marched with a group of protestors before the group formed a line in the \nintersection by kneeling and chanting. \n903.  Around 5:00 p.m., Ms. Williams was in the first line of this group of protestors \nkneeling and facing police officers and engaging in chants regarding police violence in front of \nthe Statehouse, including “Black lives matter,” “go home,” and “murderers.”  \n904.  Columbus Police Officers formed a line across from the group of protestors where \nMs. Williams was kneeling and were gradually pushing back the line of protestors away from the \nStatehouse using chemical agents, including tear gas and wooden bullets. \n905.  The  use  of  chemical  agents  and  less  lethal  munitions  against  non-violent \nprotestors was authorized and directed by Defendants Commander David Griffith and Sergeant \nCaroline Castro. \n906.  During this time, Columbus Police Officers sprayed protestors, including Ms. \nWilliams, indiscriminately with pepper spray. \n907.  Ms. Williams then attempted to leave the intersection with other protestors and \nwas running across Broad Street and away from High Street to get away from the officers using \ncrowd control devices. \n908.  While running away, a wooden bullet shot by an unknown Columbus Police \nOfficer struck Ms. Williams on the side of her left knee, leaving a bruise. \n909.  Columbus  Police  Officers  continued  shooting  wooden  bullets  at  protestors \nattempting to leave the intersection. \n910.  Ms. Williams and a smaller group of protestors regrouped and again knelt in the \nintersection further east down Broad Street, close to the intersection of East Broad and South \nSixth Streets, after they had been split up from the larger crowd by Columbus Police Officers. \n \n139 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 140 of 147  PAGEID #: 6581\n \n911.  Columbus Police Officers again formed a line against the crowd with their bikes \nwhere Ms. Williams was kneeling and chanting, “Black lives matter,” “go home,” and “stop \nkilling.” \n912.  During  this  time,  Ms.  Williams  noticed  at  least  two  officers  pointing  at  her \ndirectly and talking amongst themselves and laughing, as if they were targeting her for arrest. \n913.  At approximately 7:00p.m,, Columbus Police Officers began riding their bikes \ninto the crowd and spraying division-issued Mark-9 pepper spray at the crowd indiscriminately, \ncausing the protestors to stand up and run away. \n914.  Ms. Williams and other protestors attempted to run in the opposite direction in \ngoing east on Broad, away from the bike officers. \n915.  In running away from the intersection, Ms. Williams was blocked by a bike \nofficer waiting on the sidewalk, who jumped off his bike directly in front of her. \n916.  Ms. Williams attempted to avoid this officer and turned quickly to run in another \ndirection when another bike officer, believed to be Defendant Officer Phillip Walls, ran up \nbehind her and tackled her into the ground off of the sidewalk. \n917.  Defendant Officer Walls tackled Ms. Williams with such force that she was lifted \noff the ground and tossed into a bed of mulch lining the sidewalk, landing on the left side of her \nface and body. \n918.  Upon landing in the mulch, Ms. Williams’ glasses came off her face and an \nunidentified male Columbus Police Officer, the bike officer who was waiting on the sidewalk, \nimmediately ripped off her face mask and backpack, with such force that it ripped the fabric on \nboth items. \n \n140 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 141 of 147  PAGEID #: 6582\n \n919.  Ms. Williams attempted to turn her head to use her mouth to grab her glasses, and \nthe unknown officer forcefully twisted her head towards him and struck her with his knee on the \nright side of her face. \n920.  The unknown officer kept his knee on her head for an extended period of time \nwhile she was in the prone position on the ground, while Defendant Officer Walls sat on both of \nher legs and zip tied her hands. \n921.  Ms. Williams yelled loudly and repeatedly that she was not resisting arrest. \n922.  The Officers responded by laughing and saying, “we know” and that they heard \nher “loud and clear,” but the Officer’s knee remained on her head, pinning her to the ground the \nwhole time she was being arrested. \n923.  Ms. Williams was so scared by the arrest situation that she urinated on herself the \nmoment Defendant Officer Walls tackled her. \n924.  Ms. Williams is 5 feet 2 inches tall, less than 120 pounds, and posed no threat to \nthe officers nor was she resisting arrest in any way. \n925.  Ms. Williams was then placed on a prisoner transport bus and taken to a satellite \nbooking location behind COSI. \n926.  Ms. Williams’ face was swelling, her lip was bleeding, and she was in pain from \nthe takedown, knee strike, and being shot by the wooden bullet. \n927.  Ms. Williams remained on the bus in handcuffs for approximately nine hours \nwhile she awaited transport to the Franklin County Jail. \n928.  While  Ms.  Williams  was  having  the  zip  ties  removed,  an  unknown  male \nColumbus Police Officer was holding her right wrist upwards and bending it so that her palm \nwas facing her in a way that caused her pain. \n \n141 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 142 of 147  PAGEID #: 6583\n \n929.  Ms. Williams stated that the officer was hurting her and he said, “it’s going to \nhurt, you should not have gotten yourself arrested.” \n930.  She tried to readjust her arm to stop the pain and immediately was grabbed on her \nleft arm by another unknown male Columbus Police Officer; both officers then held her arms out \nstraight and yelled at her. \n931.  One of the officers yelled, “don’t try to assault my partner, do you know what we \ncould do to you?” \n932.  Again, Ms. Williams was so scared by this situation that she urinated on herself. \n933.  Ms. Williams was booked and charged with “failure to disperse,” a level four \nmisdemeanor charge, which was later dismissed. \n934.  During her booking, Ms. Williams requested an ice pack for her face where the \nofficer kneed her and the booking officers laughed at her. \n935.  Ms. Williams was released from the Jail around 2:00pm on May 31, 2021. \n936.  As a proximate result of the excessive force used in being tackled, kneed in the \nface, and pinned down by Defendant Officer Walls, Ms. Williams suffered from bruising on her \nface and legs for several weeks and still has a knot on her kneecap from where she was struck \nwith the wooden bullet.  \nJJ.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Heather Wise  \n937.  On June 21, 2020, Ms. Wise went to downtown Columbus to participate in the \nprotests.   \n938.  During previous incidents, Ms. Wise had been subjected to violence at the hands \nof Columbus Police Officers, however on her June 21, 2020 visit downtown she was subjected to \nespecially gratuitous violence.   \n \n142 \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 71 Filed: 05/27/21 Page: 143 of 147  PAGEID #: 6584\n \n939.  At  the  corner  of  Broad  and  High,  Ms.  Wise  was  standing  with  a  group  of \nprotestors who were trying to protect themselves from any potential police violence. \n940.  Columbus Police Officers on bicycles approached the protestors and began to use \ntheir bodies as well as their bicycles as weapons against the protestors, physically assaulting the \npeaceful protestors.  \n941.  Ms. Wise was standing there at the intersection of Broad and High as Columbus \nPolice Officers began pepper spraying the peaceful protestors.  \n942.  As some people dispersed, Ms. Wise was standing next to a Black woman who \nwas being pepper-sprayed and attempted to shield her. \n943.  While attempting to protect her fellow peaceful protestor, Ms. Wise was assaulted \nby a Columbus Police Officer who used the space in between his thumb and index finger to press \nhis hand into her throat and push her back. \n944.  Near the same time, Ms. Wise was being assaulted by a Columbus Police Officer \nwho was pushing his bicycle into her and others.  \n945.  Ms. Wise and others fell to the ground and Columbus Police Officers continued \npepper spraying them as they lay there attempting to cover themselves.  \n946.  Columbus Police Officers then pulled out a vial of a brown liquid that they began \npouring into the eyes and faces of Ms. Wise and others.  \n947.  Ms.  Wise  suffered  bruising  across  her  arms  and  legs  in  addition  to  injuries \nsuffered from the pepper spray and the unknown substance.  \nV.  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \n  A.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO \n    EASTERN DIVISION \n \nTAMARA ALSAADA, et al.,    : \n            :  Case No. 2:20-CV-3431 \n    Plaintiffs,      : \n     : CHIEF JUDGE ALGENON L. MARBLEY \nv.          :   \n          :  Magistrate Judge Jolson \nCITY OF COLUMBUS, OHIO, et al.,  : \n    : \nDefendants.      : \n   \n   \nOPINION & ORDER \n \nThis matter comes before the Court on the Joint Motion of Plaintiffs and Defendants, \nexcluding  the  Intervenor-Defendant  Fraternal  Order  of  Police,  to  Modify  the  Preliminary \nInjunction Order that this Court issued on April 30, 2021. (ECF No. 75). This Court held a \ntelephonic status conference with the parties on June 24, 2021 at 4:30 p.m. For the reasons set \nforth below and orally on the record, the Motion to Modify the Preliminary Injunction Order is \nGRANTED. (Id.). \nRule 60(b) provides that, “[o]n motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its \nlegal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding[.]” “Sound judicial discretion may \nrequire the modification of the terms of an injunctive decree if the circumstances, whether of fact \nor law, obtained at the time of its issuance have changed, or new ones have arisen.” Tri Cty. \nWholesale Distributors, Inc. v. Labatt USA Operating Co., LLC, No. 2:13-CV-317, 2014 WL \n4076041, at *3–4 (S.D. Ohio Aug. 14, 2014) (Marbley, J.) (citing System Federation No. 91 Ry. \nEmp. Dept., AFL–CIO v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 647 (1961)). \n1 \n \n\nRule 60(b)(6) “is a catchall provision, which provides for relief from a final judgment for \nany reason justifying relief not captured in the other provisions of Rule 60(b).” Henness v. Bagley, \n766 F.3d 550 at 553 (6th Cir. 2014), cert. denied, 135 S.Ct. 1708 (2015). “A movant seeking relief \nunder Rule 60(b)(6) must show ‘extraordinary circumstances’ justifying the reopening of a final \njudgment.” Abdur’Rahman v. Carpenter, 805 F.3d 710, 713 (6th Cir. 2015) (quoting another \nsource). Rule 60 applies to all judgments, not just preliminary injunctions, and a preliminary \ninjunction is less concerned with finality than other orders, such as a final judgment. \nIn this case, the parties propose two modifications to this Court’s preliminary injunction. \nThe first modification narrows the entities and individuals directly enjoined to be the City of \nColumbus,  including  its  Division  of  Police,  removing  individual  police  officers  from  the \npreliminary injunction. The second modification narrows the reference to “streets” by excluding \n“expressways and freeways.”  \nFor good cause shown, the motion is GRANTED. This Court’s preliminary injunction \norder is thus revised as follows: \n1.  Defendant City of Columbus, including its Division of Police, is restrained from using non-\nlethal force, including tear gas, pepper spray, flash-bang grenades, rubber bullets, wooden \npellets, batons, body slams, pushing or pulling, or kettling, on nonviolent protestors to \nenforce dispersal orders, traffic laws, such as clearing the streets or sidewalks, and/or \nmisdemeanors, that were not committed with actual or imminently threatened physical \nharm or property destruction; \n2.  Defendant City of Columbus, including its Division of Police, is required to recognize that, \nfor  purposes  of  the  injunction,  “nonviolent  protestors”  includes  individuals  who  are \nchanting, verbally confronting police, sitting, holding their hands up when approaching \npolice,  occupying  sidewalks  or  streets,  apart  from  expressways  or  freeways,  and/or \npassively resisting police orders; \n3.  Defendant City of Columbus, including its Division of Police, may only enforce dispersal \norders, traffic laws, such as clearing the streets or sidewalks, or misdemeanor enforcement, \nto the extent practicable, through citations or arrests, based on probable cause that an \nindividual has committed a violation; \n2 \n \n\n4.  Defendant City of Columbus, including its Division of Police, is prohibited from using the \ninfliction of pain to punish or deter “nonviolent protestors” and is directed to limit infliction \nof pain on any protestor when incidental to a use of force necessary for preventing crimes \ncommitted with actual or imminently threatened physical harm or property destruction \nand/or arresting, based on probable cause, an individual who allegedly committed such an \noffense; \n5.  Defendant City of Columbus, including its Division of Police, must ensure that body and \nvehicle  cameras  are  in  good  working  order  and  used  during  every  interaction  with \n“nonviolent protestors” and badge numbers and/or identity cards are prominently displayed \nin each such interaction, even when riot gear is being worn; \n6.  Defendant  City  of  Columbus,  including  its  Division  of  Police,  must  recognize that \nindividuals legitimately displaying “press,” “media,” “reporter,” “paramedic,” “medic,” \n“legal observer,” or similar words and/or symbols are permitted to be present in a position \nenabling them to record at protests and/or to intervene to assist individuals who appear to \nhave been injured and that all individuals, regardless of their occupation or nonviolent \nactivity, are permitted to record at protests or whenever any police officer interacts with \nthe public; and \n7.  Defendant City of Columbus’ Division of Police must request that mutual aid law enforcement \npersonnel who cooperate with them adhere to the foregoing restraints or standards on the use of \nnon-lethal force and enforcement, infliction of pain, cameras and identification, and recognition of \n“nonviolent protestors” and individuals assisting or observing them. \n \n  IT IS SO ORDERED.           \n                                                        \n            ALGENON L.

ALSAADA, et al.    : \n:  Civil Action No. 2:20cv3431  \nPlaintiffs,  :    \n:  CHIEF JUDGE MARBLEY  \n  v.          : \n            :  MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOLSON  \nTHE CITY OF COLUMBUS, et al.,   : \n            : \n        Defendants.  : \n \n \nJOINT MOTION OF PLAINTIFFS AND DEFENDANTS, OTHER THAN THE \nFRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE, TO MODIFY PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \nPlaintiffs and Defendants, other than the Fraternal Order of Police, hereby move, pursuant \nto Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6), that the preliminary injunction issued on April 30, 2021, Doc #: 66, \nPAGEID #: 5756-57, be modified by: (1) replacing “Defendants” with “The City of Columbus, \nincluding its Division of Police”; and (2) inserting in the second paragraph after “streets” the \nphrase, “apart from expressways and freeways,” because these modifications are necessary for \njustice to be done by enabling the City to address any conflict of interest that might impair adequate \nlegal  representation  of  individual  party-defendants;  by  recognizing  the  practical  reach  of  a \npreliminary injunction issued against the City of Columbus; and by focusing on the special \ncircumstances of expressways and freeways.  The moving parties further request that the order \ngranting this motion expressly state that, in all respects other than the modifications, the April 30, \n2021 preliminary injunction remains in full force and effect.  The Fraternal Order of Police, Capital \nCity Lodge No. 9, does not oppose this Joint Motion. \n \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 75 Filed: 06/24/21 Page: 2 of 6  PAGEID #: 6594\nMEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF JOINT MOTION OF PLAINTIFFS \nAND DEFENDANTS, OTHER THAN THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE, \nTO MODIFY PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \n  Rule 60(b) provides that, “[o]n motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its \nlegal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons[.]”  \nSubsection (6) lists “any other reason that justifies relief.”  Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6).  This motion \npreserves the substance of the preliminary injunction while requesting that the Court “mold its \ndecree to meet the exigencies of the particular case.”  Trump v. Int'l Refugee Assistance Project, \n137 S. Ct. 2080, 2087 (2017) (per curiam) (quoting approvingly 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. \nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2947, at 115 (3d ed. 2013)).   \n  The proposed modifications to the preliminary injunction are attached hereto as Exhibit A.  \nThe first modification narrows the entities and individuals directly enjoined to the City of \nColumbus, including its Division of Police (CDP), removing individual police officers from the \npreliminary  injunction.    Plaintiffs  fully  intend  to  continue  pursuing  damages  against  such \nindividual police officers and, depending on verdicts, permanent injunctive relief against them.  \nFor purposes of a preliminary injunction, though, as a practical matter enjoining the City will grant \nthe full preliminary relief Plaintiffs seek. \n  The  moving  parties  realize  that  “[c]rafting  a preliminary injunction is  an  exercise  of \ndiscretion and judgment, often dependent as much on the equities of a given case as the substance \nof the legal issues it presents.”  Trump, 137 S. Ct. at 2087.  Consequently, “[t]he purpose of such \ninterim equitable relief is not to conclusively determine the rights of the parties, but to balance the \nequities as the litigation moves forward.”  Id. (citation omitted).   \nIn that balancing, a difficulty articulated by Defendants to support their motion for an \nextended  interlocutory  appeal  period  --  ensuring  individual  police  officers  are  adequately \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 75 Filed: 06/24/21 Page: 3 of 6  PAGEID #: 6595\nrepresented  --  should  be  considered.    While  modifying  the  preliminary  injunction  will  not \neliminate that difficulty for the remainder of the case, it will alleviate the time constraint and permit \nthe adequacy of representation to be considered on an individual basis.  For example, charges have \nrecently been brought against three officers for their alleged conduct during the protests underlying \nthis action.   \n  The second modification narrows the reference to “streets” by excluding “expressways and \nfreeways.”    Defendants  have  raised  with  Plaintiffs  the  special  circumstances  presented  by \nprotestors entering high-speed, limited-access freeways.  The public, protestors, and officers face \nincreased danger that differs from protests on city streets.  The evidence adduced at the preliminary \ninjunction hearing nearly exclusively concerned city streets and sidewalks.   \n“Sound judicial discretion may require the modification of the terms of an injunctive \ndecree if the circumstances, whether of fact or law, obtained at the time of its issuance have \nchanged, or new ones have arisen.”  Tri Cty. Wholesale Distributors, Inc. v. Labatt USA Operating \nCo., LLC, No. 2:13-CV-317, 2014 WL 4076041, at *3–4 (S.D. Ohio Aug. 14, 2014) (Marbley, J.) \n(citing System Federation No. 91 Ry. Emp. Dept., AFL–CIO v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 647 (1961)).  \nThe  customary  interpretation  of  Rule  60(b)(6)  confines  it  to  exceptional  or  extraordinary \ncircumstances.  See, e.g., McCurry ex. rel. Turner v. Adventist Health Sys./Sunbelt, Inc., 298 F.3d \n586, 596 (6th Cir. 2002); Olle v. Henry & Wright Corp., 910 F.2d 357, 365 (6th Cir. 1990).  That \ninterpretation flows primarily from the concern for finality.  Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, \n535 (2005).  Rule 60 applies to all judgments, not just preliminary injunctions, and a preliminary \ninjunction is less concerned with finality than other orders, such as a final judgment.    \n“The decision to grant Rule 60(b)(6) relief is a case-by-case inquiry that requires the trial \ncourt to intensively balance numerous factors, including the competing policies of the finality of \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 75 Filed: 06/24/21 Page: 4 of 6  PAGEID #: 6596\njudgments and the incessant command of the court's conscience that justice be done in light of all \nthe facts.”  Thompson v. Bell, 580 F.3d 423, 442 (6th Cir. 2009) (quoting Blue Diamond Coal Co. \nv. Trustees of UMWA Combined Benefits Fund, 249 F.3d 519, 529 (6th Cir. 2001)) (alteration \nomitted).  For justice to best be done at bar, these modifications should be made.   \n            Respectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Alana V. Tanoury  /s/ John S. Marshall \nAlana V. Tanoury (0092265)  John S.

Preliminary Statement   \n1 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 2 of 118  PAGEID #: 84\n  1.  On May 25, 2020, the killing of George Floyd, who was being arrested for \nallegedly passing a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes, by then Minneapolis Police Department \nOfficer Derek Chauvin was live-streamed over the Internet for eight minutes and 46 seconds and \nlater televised around the world. \n2.  Starting on May 28, 2020, in Columbus, Ohio, Plaintiffs, along with hundreds of \nthousands in cities, states, and countries, took to the streets to demonstrate against excessive use \nof force by police, saying the names of Black men and women who had recently been killed by \npolice  or  vigilantes;  chanting  that  “Black  Lives  Matter,”  “No  Justice,  No  Peace,”  “I  can’t \nbreathe,” “Hands up, Don’t Shoot,” and “Whose Streets? Our Streets”; and expressing their \noutrage at the militarization of police forces, the disparate impact on minority communities of \nlaw enforcement priorities, and a pattern or practice of governments at all levels tolerating \nsystemic  racism  and  failing  to  adopt  effective  policies  or  implement  adequate  training, \nsupervision, and discipline of law enforcement officers. \n3.  Plaintiffs and other demonstrators in Columbus comprised a multi-racial group, \ninformally brought together by Black community leaders and activists primarily through the use \nof social media and dedicated to nonviolent protest, including civil disobedience of traffic, \nparade, and mass-gathering regulations, to generate urgent widespread public attention to the \nhistoric and continuing police violence directed overwhelmingly at communities and people of \ncolor condoned by mostly White police supervisors and administrators.   \n4.  The goals of Plaintiffs and other demonstrators included engendering serious, \neffective, and immediate actions to bring a halt to the endemic racism infecting America’s law \nenforcement  and  justice  systems  and  the  general  tolerance  of  excessive  force  routinely \nadministered by police officers against arrestees, regardless of innocence or guilt, and especially \nagainst citizens who question an officer’s actions. \n5.  On May 28, 2020, Plaintiffs and other demonstrators in Columbus exercised their \nrights of assembly and expression by gathering downtown. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 3 of 118  PAGEID #: 85\n6.  Defendants Sergeant and Officers were angered by the civil disobedience they \nobserved, the message of the protests, and the criticisms and denunciation they heard.   \n7.  Defendants Sergeant and Officers had received minimal and ineffective training \nfrom Defendants City and Chief and were subject to vague, ineffective, and rarely enforced \npolicies regarding the need to handle protesters without using force or using the least amount of \nnon-lethal force necessary.  \n8.  Defendants Sergeant and Officers instead responded to the protests with excessive \nuse of force, including kettling, pepper spraying, tear gassing, smoke bombs, and assaulting with \nphysical force, sonic cannon, batons, horses, bicycles, and rubber and wooden bullets, or bean \nbag rounds and flash-bang grenades against nonviolent protestors who were standing in the \nstreets, from which vehicular traffic had already been blocked and eliminated by police, or on \nsidewalks, chanting, and holding signs and posing no threat of violence or property destruction, \ntypically  without  giving  audible  warnings  to  their  targets,  and  targeting  clearly-identifiable \njournalists, medical assistants, and legal observers who were there peaceably to assist protestors. \n9.   Defendants Sergeant and Officers either criticized, often profanely, the protestors \nfor their chants, signs, and civil disobedience or heard, without commenting, other Officers do so \nwhile using excessive force. \n10.  Defendants Sergeant and Officers purposely used excessive force to punish one or \nmore Plaintiffs and other demonstrators, to deter them from continuing to protest and others from \njoining a protest with which they disagreed, and to reclaim the streets. \n11.  Defendants Sergeant and Officers maliciously prosecuted one or more Plaintiffs \nto punish them and deter other demonstrators from continuing to protest and some purposely \ncovered their names and badge numbers with tape to avoid being identified when they used \nexcessive force or retaliated for speech they resented. \n12.  Just the month before, Defendants had exercised restraint when demonstrators, \nsome of whom openly carried weapons and engaged in hate speech while violating statewide \n3 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 4 of 118  PAGEID #: 86\nsocial-distancing and mask mandates, protested the COVID-19 lockdown at and around the \nStatehouse. \n13.  Despite the excessive use of force earlier on May 28, 2020, the overwhelming \nmajority of the demonstrators remained nonviolent, fled from the toxic chemicals, and left, \nsought medical assistance, or tried to regroup at a safe distance. \n14.  After  Defendants  needlessly  escalated  and  provoked  protestors,  there  were \nsporadic incidents of property destruction or harassment of law enforcement officers by throwing \nobjects, but none of these actions caused serious injury to officers, and none of them was \ncommitted by or reasonably could have been attributed to the Plaintiffs and other nonviolent \ndemonstrators. \n15.  After  Defendants  had  escalated  their  force  against  non-violent  protestors, \ntriggering  property  destruction  by  others,  they  authorized  more  police  and  mutual-aid  law \nenforcement personnel  to  use greater force against the remaining demonstrators, who were \ninjured even though the overwhelming majority of them were not engaged in any violence \ntoward police or property destruction. \n16.  On May 29 and 30, a similar dynamic occurred; a curfew from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 \na.m. was imposed on May 30; and public indignation at the broadcasts on social media and local \nand  national  television  of  the  demonstrations  and  reports  and  pictures  or  video  sent  to \nreportcpd@columbus.gov ultimately convinced the Columbus Mayor, who had initially falsely \ndescribed what had been happening and excused the police use of force, to limit the use of tear \ngas and, on June 1, 2020, denounce excessive force by police officers.  \n17.  Plaintiffs have suffered injuries to their civil rights and their bodies, and they \nreasonably expect to exercise, and are unwilling to refrain from exercising, their fundamental \nrights to assemble, protest, travel, and live freely within and around Columbus in the future.   \n18.  Plaintiffs  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief;  compensatory  damages  for \ninjuries; punitive damages from Defendants Chief, Sergeant, and Officers; and attorneys’ fees \n4 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 5 of 118  PAGEID #: 87\nand costs for violations of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments rights to be free from \nexcessive use of force and malicious prosecution; their First and Fourteenth Amendments rights \nto peaceably assemble and exercise freedom of expression; and/or their Ohio common-law right \nnot to be battered or maliciously prosecuted and/or injured by the gross negligence of police \nofficers, and/or their Ohio statutory right to recover damages inflicted by a criminal act caused \nby  the  failure  of  Defendants  City  of  Columbus  and  Chief  to  adopt  effective  policies  and \nadequately train, supervise, and discipline police officers. \nII.  Jurisdiction and Venue \n  19.  This  Court has jurisdiction over this action by virtue of 28 U.S.C. §§  1331 \n(federal question); 1343 (civil rights); and 1367 (supplemental jurisdiction). \n  20.  Declaratory, equitable, and injunctive relief is sought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n2201; 2202; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and the common law of the State of Ohio. \n  21.  Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the statutory and common law of the State of Ohio, \ncompensatory damages may be awarded against all Defendants and punitive damages may be \nawarded against Defendants Chief, Sergeant, and Officers. \n  22.  Costs and attorneys’ fees may be awarded pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 54, and the common law of the State of Ohio. \n  23.  Venue lies in this forum pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and S.D. Civ. R. 82.1 \nbecause the claims arose in Franklin County, Ohio where Defendant City of Columbus is located \nand operates the Division of Police, headed by Defendant Chief, which empowered Defendants \nChief, Sergeant, and Officers to use force. \nIII.

Facts \n  A.  Societal Background \n   \n60.  For years, African-Americans have been the victims of police and vigilante use of \ndeadly excessive force, and Plaintiffs and the other demonstrators have said the victims’ names \nduring their protests. \n61.  Those names include Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old African-American killed in 2015 \nby a Cleveland Police Officer when the child was carrying a pellet gun; Breonna Taylor, an \nAfrican-American Emergency Medical Technician, shot eight times on March 13, 2020, by \nofficers of the Louisville Metro Police Department who were executing a no-knock warrant at \nher residence; Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American teenager, fatally shot in 2014 by a \nFerguson,  Missouri  police  officer;  Eric  Garner,  an  African-American  whose  cry,  “I  can’t \n11 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 12 of 118  PAGEID #: 94\nbreathe,” was repeated by George Floyd, fatally choked in 2014 by a New York City police \nofficer who was arresting him for selling loose cigarettes; Philando Castile, an African-American \nelementary school cafeteria worker shot five times during a 2016 traffic stop by a St. Paul, \nMinnesota police officer; and Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery, young African-Americans \nkilled by vigilantes, one of whom was a former police officer. \n62.  Since  the  May  28-June  3,  2020  Columbus  protests,  the  list  has  grown.  \nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/say-their-names-list-people-injured-killed-police-officer-\ninvolved-incidents/ \n63.  While in a handful of cases, discipline had been meted out and prosecutions \npursued, most of the police officers were not disciplined, let alone successfully prosecuted; \nindeed, when George Floyd was killed there had been no police discipline meted out for Breonna \nTaylor’s death. \n64.  The widespread dissemination of the May 25, 2020 video of Officer Chauvin \nkilling George Floyd coupled with the killing of Breonna Taylor and the history reflected in \nthose names, caused an eruption of public revulsion about police use of excessive force on \nAfrican-Americans and other minorities. \n65.  Social media facilitated the scheduling of demonstrations. \n  B.  Defendants’ Preparation for Demonstrations \n66.  Defendants  knew  by  May  26,  2020,  that  demonstrations  would  occur  in \ndowntown Columbus. \n67.  Defendants  knew  that  the  group  Black  Lives  Matter  would  call  for  such \ndemonstrations. \n12 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 13 of 118  PAGEID #: 95\n68.  Defendants knew that Black Lives Matter is an organized movement dedicated to \nnon-violent  civil  disobedience  in  protest  of  incidents  of  police  brutality  against  African-\nAmericans, which began in 2013 when activists used the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social \nmedia after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teen \nTrayvon Martin in February 2012, and was nationally recognized for street demonstrations \nfollowing the Brown and Garner deaths. \n69.  Defendants City and Chief monitored social media communications to and from \nBlack Lives Matter and were aware, before the evening of May 28, 2020, that Black Lives \nMatter was encouraging a non-violent protest in Columbus. \n70.  Many of the Plaintiffs and other protestors were affiliated with, identified with, \nand/or inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, dressing in clothing with the group’s name \nor initials, and using chants, such as “Black Lives Matter”; “I Can’t Breathe”; “No Justice, No \nPeace”; and “Hands up, Don’t Shoot,” which were associated with the group. \n71.  Many Columbus Police Officers and their supervisors, along with some mutual-\naid law enforcement personnel, nurse an abiding hatred of the Black Live Matters movement, \nbelieving that it hurts the image of police and despising the movement’s goals and actions \nseeking to limit the prerogative of police to use force in any manner and amount they wish. \n72.  Many Columbus Police Officers and their supervisors, along with some mutual-\naid law enforcement personnel, resent the chant “Black Lives Matter” and prefer “Blue Lives \nMatter” and/or “All Lives Matter,” slogans that dismiss and deny the existence and importance \nof systemic racism in policing. \n73.  Anticipating the Columbus protests, many Columbus police officers and their \nsupervisors,  along  with  some  mutual-aid  law  enforcement  personnel,  decided  to  use  their \n13 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 14 of 118  PAGEID #: 96\nassignments  to  exact  revenge  on  the  Black  Lives  Matter  group  and  chill  the  exercise  of \nassociation and freedom of expression by protestors. \n74.  One tactic used by Defendants City and Chief was to have Columbus Police \nOfficers declare that a peaceful, nonviolent protest in the streets of Columbus had become an \nemergency  and  then  order  the  protestors  to  disperse,  using  projectile  weapons  and  caustic \nchemical agents to enforce that order. \n75.  Defendants  City  and  Chief  had  adopted  a  policy,  training  Columbus  Police \nOfficers on that policy, to use that tactic in response to large protests. \n76.  Failure  to  disperse  when  ordered  by  a  law  enforcement  officer  is,  under \nR.C.  2917.04, a minor misdemeanor, unless the order is given in an emergency, when the crime \nbecomes a fourth-degree misdemeanor. \n77.  Under R.C.  2917.04(B), “Nothing in this section requires persons to disperse who \nare peaceably assembled for a lawful purpose.” \n78.  Defendants City and Chief have not emphasized in that policy or training the \nalternative to use of non-lethal force of citing and/or arresting protestors who do not disperse. \n79.  Defendants City and Chief have not emphasized in that policy or training a means \nfor Columbus Police Officers to differentiate peaceable assembly for a lawful purpose from an \nactual emergency. \n80.  Defendant City’s Division of Police has a history of excessive use of force and \nother abuses of their authority in response to nonviolent demonstrations and expressive conduct \nby those with whom police officers and their superiors disagree. \n14 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 15 of 118  PAGEID #: 97\n81.  For example, on January 30, 2017, nearly two thousand protestors against the \nMuslim Ban by President Trump came to the Ohio Statehouse and, after a peaceful rally, began \nto march south on High Street to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. \n82.  During the march and upon their arrival, protestors overflowed the sidewalks, \nand, after more protesting, they used the High Street to march back toward the Statehouse. \n83.  Columbus Police Officers then ordered approximately 300 protestors to disperse. \n84.  Pepper  spray  or  mace  was  used  to  disperse  the  protestors  and  gratuitously \nadministered directly in the face and eyes of one or more protestors who were not actively \nresisting arrest. \n85.  On June 17, 2017, when Black Lives Matter became involved with a protest at the \nColumbus Pride Parade, police officers raced to the scene with pepper-spray canisters already \ndrawn. \n86.  Only weeks later, on July 7, 2017, when protestors with disabilities, many of them \nin wheelchairs, peacefully occupied Senator Rob Portman’s Columbus office to urge him to vote \nagainst a federal health care bill supported by President Trump (who is supported publicly and \nprivately by many police officers because he opposes any form of accountability for police \nabuses), Columbus Police Officers arrived at the scene, claiming there was an emergency call for \nassistance,  and  forcibly  arrested  the  peaceful  protestors  using  excessive  force,  including \nknocking over wheelchairs and carrying some protestors with mobility issues out of the building. \n87.  The following year, on July 11, 2018, Stephanie Clifford (also known as Stormy \nDaniels), the adult film star who was paid hush money by President Trump to conceal an affair, \nvisited a Columbus strip club on a publicity tour embarrassing to the President, and several \nColumbus Police Officers targeted Daniels for arrest because of her status as an anti-Trump \n15 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 16 of 118  PAGEID #: 98\npolitical symbol and arrested other women working at the club because of their association with \nDaniels and to cover up their retaliatory motive.   \n88.  Social media message board posts among Columbus Police Officers celebrated \nthe arrests as a blow against President Trump’s critics.    \n89.  In contrast, Columbus Police Officers have peacefully monitored protests and \nother  expressive  events  in  downtown  Columbus  with  whose  messages  they  are  neutral  or \nsympathetic,  including  the  recent  protests  by  an  overwhelmingly  White  group  at  the  Ohio \nStatehouse against COVID-19-related closures, where many protestors were armed with rifles \nand carried ammunition, and the intense mass protests and public rallies in 2011 by public \nemployee unions (including their own) against the effort to restrict collective bargaining rights.  \n90.  Despite knowing about this history of Defendant City’s Division of Police and the \nnegative feelings towards Black Lives Matter of its officers and their superiors, Defendants City \nand Chief took no specific precautions against excessive use of force in handling the protests. \n91.  Defendants City and Chief ensured that Columbus Police Officers were armed \nwith batons, pepper spray, tear gas canisters, sonic cannons, smoke bombs or grenades, flash-\nbang grenades, and/or weapons that could shoot rubber and wooden bullets or bean bag rounds. \n92.  Defendants  City  and  Chief  characterized  such  weapons  as  “non-lethal”  and \nencouraged their use as an alternative to Tasers and guns and/or rifles that used regular bullets, \ndespite  knowing  that  these  “non-lethal”  weapons,  while  less  lethal  than  officers’  service \nweapons,  still  have  the  potential  to  cause  death  or  serious  injury,  especially  (though  not \nexclusively) when used without appropriate precautions \n16 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 17 of 118  PAGEID #: 99\n93.  The way Columbus Police Officers, Deputies, and mutual-aid law enforcement \npersonnel used such weapons posed a significant risk of serious and harmful bodily injury to \nnonviolent protestors. \n94.  Batons are hard, ergonomic sticks designed to inflict pain and, when applied with \nthe usual force, will break bones and cause concussions and internal bleeding. \n95.  Pepper spray is a chemical compound that irritates the target’s eyes, causing a \nburning sensation, pain, and temporary blindness; inflicts shortness of breath by burning the \ntarget’s lungs; and interferes with breathing by irritating the respiratory system, which, during \nthe protests, was already a concern because of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n96.  Tear gas canisters contain a chemical weapon, colloquially known as mace, which \ncauses severe eye and respiratory pain, skin irritation, bleeding, and blindness.  \n97.  The use of tear gas in warfare is prohibited by international treaties. \n98.  Long-lasting effects of tear gas can include development of respiratory illnesses, \nand the canisters can be delivered with such force that they cause severe bruising, loss of \neyesight, and/or skull or bone fractures. \n99.  Tear gas has also been linked with painful disruptions to the menstrual cycle of \nfemale protestors, including a heavier flow at abnormal intervals with more intense cramping, \nand unexpected spotting by those with IUDs (intrauterine device).  \n100  Flash-bang  grenades,  which  are  also  known  as  stun  grenades,  are  explosive \ndevices that emit both an extremely loud bang, usually with higher decibels than a jet engine at \nfull throttle, and ultra-bright light to disorient their targets. \n101.  Flash-bang grenades cause temporary blindness and pain to the retina, impaired \nhearing, and/or disruption of the inner-ear fluid and consequent loss of balance. \n17 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 18 of 118  PAGEID #: 100\n102.  Rubber bullets, technically kinetic impact projectiles, are hard rubber or rubber-\ncoated projectiles that can be fired at the same velocity as bullets from standard weapons or riot \nguns. \n103.  Rubber  bullets  are  intended  to  cause  pain  without  serious  injury,  but  they \ntypically cause not only contusions, abrasions, and hematomas, but also bone fractures. \n104.  Rubber bullets are not designed to be safely shot point-blank or at a target’s head, \nbut it is well known that law enforcement officers often disregard this instruction. \n105.  Wooden bullets are dowel-shaped rods sliced  into  projectiles the size of pill \nbottles to be fired at the same velocity as bullets. \n106.  Like rubber bullets, wooden bullets are intended to cause pain without serious \ninjury, but they typically cause bone fractures as well as contusions, abrasions, and hematomas. \n107.  Wooden bullets can also splinter and infect areas where their targets are hit. \n108.  While wooden bullets are not designed to be safely shot point-blank or at a \ntarget’s head, officers frequently do so anyway. \n109.  Bean bag rounds consist of nylon or other fabric sacks filled with lead shot and \nfired at high speed from 12-gauge shotguns. \n110.  Officers are trained to aim for “green” (thigh or leg) or “yellow” (stomach) zones \nof the body, while avoiding the “red” (face or groin) zone, though they frequently target the \nhead. \n111.  A bean bag round spreads to hit a one square inch area of the target where it is \nintended to cause a muscle spasm; however, the bean bag round often causes a fracture or \nconcussion. \n18 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 19 of 118  PAGEID #: 101\n112.  Smoke  bombs,  grenades,  or  canisters  consist  of  a  device  loaded  with  white \nphosphorus and an internal bursting mechanism. \n113.  Smoke bombs, grenades, or canisters are typically thrown indiscriminately into or \nnear a group. \n114.  Upon detonation, a brilliant yellow flame is emitted and produces a large amount \nof white smoke or phosphorus pentoxide. \n115.  A chemical irritant can be added to smoke bombs, grenades, or canisters, though \nthe ones used by Defendants appear to have produced pure smoke. \n116.  The smoke obscures the vision of individuals by creating a fog, irritates eyes, and \naffects the breathing of individuals nearby the deployed smoke bombs, grenades, or canisters.  \n117.  Sonic  cannons,  known  by  the  acronym  LRAD  for  “Long  Range  Acoustic \nDevice,” emit focused soundwaves over a long distance, inflict pain, and can cause permanent or \nlong-term damage to an individual’s hearing. \n118.  A normal conversation level is 60 dB (decibels), a lawn mower averages 90 dB, \nthe pain threshold for the average person is 103 dB, and an LRAD’s maximum continuous \nvolume is 162 dB.   \n119.  Columbus Police Officers were provided protective ear plugs when sonic cannons \nwere used on protestors.   \nC.  Days and Nights of Police and Deputy Rage \n120.  Over the course of the demonstrations on May 28, 29, and 30 and June 1, 2, and 3, \nColumbus  Police  Officers  beat  peaceful  protestors  and  bystanders;  pepper-sprayed  without \nprovocation  and  at  point  blank  range  protestors  and  observers,  including  United  States \nCongresswoman  Joyce  Beatty,  City  Council  President  Shannon  Hardin,  and  County \n19 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 20 of 118  PAGEID #: 102\nCommissioner Kevin Boyce; lobbed and/or shot tear gas canisters without provocation; fired \nrubber or wooden bullets and flash-bang grenades directly at vulnerable body areas of protestors, \nas  truly  and  accurately  reflected  in  a  video  posted  at \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&v=vZaoz9ZRVOc&feature=emb_title  and \nshown below; and targeted identified journalists and individuals providing medical assistance. A \ntrue and accurate copy of that video is provided below (double click to play or click the link). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n121.  The targeting of identified journalists was done to eliminate eye-witness reports \nand photographs or videos of police engaging in use of excessive force and retaliating against \nprotestors for the content and urgency of their expression.  \n122.  A tactic used by Defendants is “kettling,” where groups of nonviolent protestors \nare boxed in, typically by using commands, bicycles, horses, and/or lines of police, and moved \nfrom one place to another, even though the protestors were unwilling or, due to other protestors \nor physical barriers, unable to move, and then arresting them for resisting, obstructing, and/or \nfailing to disperse. \n20 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 21 of 118  PAGEID #: 103\n123.  Apart from assembling and chanting or holding signs in the middle of streets or \nother  locations  Defendants  wanted  them  to  abandon,  these  groups  of  protestors  were  not \nviolating, as reflected in the true and accurate pictures below, any laws, threatening violence, \ndestroying any property, or hampering traffic. \n \n \n21 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 22 of 118  PAGEID #: 104\n \n \n \n124.  Another tactic used by Defendants was collective punishment: responding to any \naction by an isolated individual who threw a water bottle, harassed or taunted an officer, or \nengaged in property destruction by indiscriminately pepper-spraying or tear-gassing a group of \nobviously different protestors who had not engaged in any such conduct. \n125.  The “kettling” and collective punishment created a chaotic situation among the \nprotestors which Defendants then used as an excuse for additional force including using force \nagainst protestors who moved to assist others who had been subjected to excessive force. \n22 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 23 of 118  PAGEID #: 105\n126.  Defendant Chief knew that such tactics were being used to provoke demonstrators \nand justify arrests, but he did not intervene to limit their use. \n127.  To the contrary, Defendant Chief excused the targeting of identifiable journalists \nby falsely claiming that they had been difficult to identify and force was used in a fast-moving \nsituation where officers were being assaulted, “pelted with bottles and rocks.” \n128.  The false claims of Defendant Chief to excuse misconduct were intended to be \ntaken  by  Columbus  Police  Officers,  and  were  in  fact  taken,  as  a  form  of  approval  and \ncondonation of their tactics and an invitation to continue and escalate them. \n129.  Photographs and videos taken at the scene demonstrate that journalists, who were \nwearing hats and hoodies bearing the name of their newspaper, were targeted even though \nnothing was being thrown at the police, the protestors were not out of control, and the situation \nwas not fast-moving. \n130.  The  way  Defendants  Sergeant  and  Officers  routinely  pepper-sprayed \ndemonstrators who were not engaging in violent behavior is accurately illustrated by the picture \nbelow; a true and accurate depiction of Defendants’ aggressive conduct appears in the video \nposted at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npXL2-NT1Zs, where pepper spray was used on \nsmall sections of the protestors and one protestor was punched by Defendant Lucci.

I \nwas participating in a BLM protest with hundreds of other people today in downtown Columbus. We \nwere yelling chants & marching around the statehouse on the sidewalks but nothing more as we were \ntold this would be a peaceful demonstration.  Then bike cops show up. All of them had gas masks on. \nPeople started getting uneasy.  A SWAT truck drives by, yelling people to stay off the road. But \nother than people crossing on the crosswalk, no one was on the streets nor blocking the traffic.  More \ncops on horseback show up.  People starts murmuring.  More police cars show up & park in the \nmiddle of a busy street. Police officers start unloading and gearing up.  People were yelling ‘what are \nyou doing? We’re not doing anything wrong!’  First rounds of tear gas goes off in the crosswalk area. \nPeople start screaming and yelling others to run. People were coughing and crying from the effects of \nthe gas (there were children & seniors in the group). People were handing out water to those who \nneeded to rinse their face.  Another round of gas goes off. This time, ON THE SIDEWALK. Not on \nthe roads, but directly on the sidewalk. People were running, jumping over the fence, falling on the \nground & running for their lives. This is when my friend and I were impacted and we had to rinse our \nfaces off with water for several minutes. We decided that it was getting too dangerous and left \nshortly afterwards.  We weren’t attacking the police. We weren’t vandalizing/looting any properties.  \nNo protester had weapons on them.  So tell me, why did we get maced?” \n132.

On May 29, 2020, Columbus Police Officers walked their bicycles, used them to \nblock off a group of protestors, and then pepper-sprayed protestors, as accurately depicted on the \n30 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 31 of 118  PAGEID #: 113\nvideo at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thjbZhftL_A. A true and accurate copy of that video \nis provided below (double click to play or click the link). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n139.  In addition to the injuries described below that each Plaintiff suffered from being \nmistreated by Columbus Police Officers, all plaintiffs suffered fear, frustration, anger, emotional \ndistress, and/or humiliation, as a proximate cause of being mistreated. \nD.  Defendants  City  and  Chief  Knew  of  the  Need  for  Effective  Training, \nSupervision,  and  Discipline  to  Curb  Police  Use  of  Excessive  Force  and \nRetaliation for Associations or Expression Officers Hated. \n \n140.  According  to  the  police  tracking  website  https://mappingpoliceviolence.org, \nduring the years 2013 through 2019, Columbus Police Officers killed at a rate of 7.3 per 100,000 \nresidents, which was the highest rate of any department in the State of Ohio and more than \ndouble the rate in Cleveland, Ohio. \n141.  During  that  period,  Columbus  Police  Officers  killed  27  African-Americans, \nincluding  in  2016  Henry  Green,  age  23,  who  was  killed  by  plainclothes  officer  in  the \npredominantly Black neighborhood of South Linden, and three months later, 13-year-old Tyre \nKing. \n31 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 32 of 118  PAGEID #: 114\n142.  African-Americans make up 28% of the population of the City of Columbus, but \nduring that period constituted half (varying between 49% and 53% since 2013) of the use-of-\nforce incidents. \n143.  Defendants City and Chief were aware of these statistics and, while claiming to \nbelieve that most of the individual uses of force were justified, still knew Columbus Police \nOfficers were engaging in a troubling pattern of mistreating African-Americans. \n144.  Despite this knowledge, Defendants City and Chief did not take specific steps to \naddress what appeared to be mistreatment of African-Americans. \n145.  In order to become a Columbus Police Officer, applicants need only have a high \nschool diploma or GED, be 20 years of age or older, have a valid driver’s license, and be a U.S. \ncitizen. \n146.  Upon hire, Columbus Police Officers receive an initial salary of $58,947.20 per \nyear, which steadily increases over their first four years of service, with officers who have \nworked for the Division for more than 48 months receiving an annual salary of $90,230.40.  \n147.  In addition to their salary, Columbus Police Officers receive a generous benefits \npackage which includes paid training, college tuition reimbursement, life insurance, individual \nand family health insurance, vision and dental plans, and a significant pension package through \nthe Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund. \n148.  In addition to pay and benefits, Columbus Police Officers have the option to \nprovide security and traffic control services, usually referred to as “special duty pay,” at the rate \nof $54.00 per hour, which services are a condition for a parade permit and outdoor events and are \ntypically provided by Columbus Police Officers. \n32 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 33 of 118  PAGEID #: 115\n149.  The training received by Columbus Police Officers is based on the notion that \nbeing a police officer is an extremely dangerous profession, and stresses their security and safety \nabove all else, especially their ability to use force whenever they feel threatened or perceive a \nthreat to another. \n150.  Although being an actual patrol officer is a relatively dangerous profession, with \naverage deaths of 13.7 per 100,000 employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it is \nnowhere nearly as dangerous as common occupations such as roofers (51.5), farmers (24.7). \ntruck drivers (26.0), and groundskeepers (18.6); indeed, with fatal injuries in the amount of 44.3 \nper 100,000, trash and recycling collectors’ jobs are more than three times as dangerous as a \npatrol officer’s job. \n151.  A reliable 2020 study demonstrates that only 4% of a police officer’s time is \ngenerally spent on handling violent crime.  https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/upshot/unrest-\npolice-time-violent-crime.html   \n152.  Defendant City has resisted appointing a civilian review board for police officer \nactivities; instead, all citizen complaints against officers are handled by the Columbus Police \nDivision’s Internal Affairs Bureau. \n153.  The Internal Affairs Bureau routinely dismisses citizen complaints against its \nofficers as unfounded, almost always believing the statements of officers over that of citizens.  \n154.  The  Internal  Affairs  Bureau  is  motivated  to  dismiss  citizen  complaints  as \nunfounded because finding against the Officer or Officers might subject the City to civil liability. \n155.  Even  when  citizen  complaints  of  violence  are  sustained,  over  the  years  the \nColumbus Police Division has meted out disproportionately minor discipline for violent acts, \nsuch as written reprimand and short suspensions.   \n33 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 34 of 118  PAGEID #: 116\n156.  In turn, this custom of failing to discipline establishes standards which the union \nfor Columbus Police Officers invoke to persuade arbitrators to reverse serious discipline as \ninconstant with past disciplinary standards. \n157.  Defendants City and Chief know that it is nearly impossible to fire a Columbus \nPolice Officer for use of excessive force.   \n158.  Per  their  union  contract  with  Defendant  City,  Columbus  Police  Officers  are \nindemnified for any damages (except punitive damages) awarded due to a claim of excessive \nforce, and Defendant City provides free legal representation to officers accused of excessive \nforce.   \n159.  Defendants City and Chief knew before the demonstrations which started on May \n28,  2020,  that  Columbus  Police  Officers  faced  little  or  no  disincentive  from  engaging  in \nexcessive use of force and regularly failed to comply with the letter or spirit of training and \npolicies on use of force, handling demonstrations, and retaliating for speech they hated. \n160.  Within the Columbus Division of Police, it is an unspoken rule that, regardless of \nwhatever violent acts a police officer may witness another officer doing, criminal charges will \nnot be brought against that officer. \n161.  In the City of Columbus, misdemeanor offenses are prosecuted by the Columbus \nCity Attorney, and felony offenses are prosecuted by the Franklin County Prosecutor’s Office. \n162.  Both the Columbus City Attorney’s Office and the Franklin County Prosecutor’s \nOffice have an unwritten rule or custom that no criminal charges are to be brought against police \nofficers for acts of violence committed against citizens while in uniform.  \n163.  This  unwritten rule or  custom applies regardless  of the egregiousness of the \noffense or the strength of the evidence of the officer committing the offenses and reflects, among \n34 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 35 of 118  PAGEID #: 117\nother pressures, a conflict of interest that prosecutors have with relying on police witnesses to \nprosecute other crimes and not wanting to antagonize them by prosecuting their crimes; the \nperceived political power of police unions and elected status of the City Attorney and Franklin \nCounty Prosecutor; and the barriers victims of acts of violence by police officers confront in \nreaching grand jurors and, if they have any criminal record or suspicious conduct, persuading \ntrial jurors.  \n164.  Incidents of violence which would cause a regular citizen to be charged with \nassault, battery, or other crimes of violence are not charged against police officers for the sole \nreason that they are police officers.   \n165.  It is common knowledge among Columbus Police Officers that, with the possible \nexception of deadly violence videotaped by citizens, they are immune from any prosecution for \nacts of violence committed within the City of Columbus. \n166.  The combination of a toothless disciplinary policy, indemnification from civil \nliability, and practical immunity from criminal prosecution, creates a perfect storm in which \nColumbus Police Officers know that there will nearly always be no repercussions to them for \nviolent acts.   \n167.  With regard to all but one recent police killing (a shooting of a White woman by \nan  African-American  officer),  the  Columbus  Division  of  Police  did  not  issue  significant \ndiscipline for any of the officers involved, and no criminal  charges were filed  against  the \nofficers. \n168.  For example, in April of 2017, one of the officers who shot Henry Green, Officer \nZachary Rosen, was caught on videotape stomping on the head of a handcuffed and helpless \nAfrican-American suspect who was lying on the sidewalk.   \n35 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 36 of 118  PAGEID #: 118\n169.  Despite the fact that Officer Rosen had plainly committed an act of felonious \nassault that could have killed or grievously injured the suspect, the Columbus City Attorney’s \nOffice  and  Franklin  County  Prosecutor’s  office  declined  to  bring  criminal  charges  against \nOfficer Rosen solely because of the fact he was a police officer.   \n170.  On June 14, 2017, then-Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs determined that an \nappropriate punishment for Officer Rosen stomping on the head of a helpless individual was a \n24-hour suspension and recommended this punishment to Columbus Public Safety Director Ned \nPettus.   \n171.  In July of 2017, Public Safety Director Pettus rejected the recommendation of \nChief Jacobs and terminated Officer Rosen’s employment.   \n172.  Infuriated that one of their members had been terminated for kicking a helpless \nAfrican-American suspect in the head, the Columbus Fraternal Order of Police (“FOP”) Lodge \nNo. 9 unanimously approved a no-confidence vote in Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther, Public \nSafety Director Pettus, and then-City Council President Zach Klein. \n173.  In announcing the no-confidence vote, FOP President Jason Pappas stated: “We \nwant to send the message that we’ve lost faith. It demonstrates to those individuals that we no \nlonger have confidence in their ability to lead. Unless they make significant changes by funding \nus and staffing us and supporting our officers who are out there day in and day out, that we will \nnot have confidence in their ability to lead us or this city.” \n174.  In March 2018, an arbitrator rescinded Safety Director Pettus’s termination and \nreinstated Officer Rosen to his patrol officer position with full back pay.   \n175.  In May 2018, Defendant City paid a $30,000.00 settlement to the individual \nwhose head Officer Rosen had stomped on.   \n36 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 37 of 118  PAGEID #: 119\n176.  This  settlement  came  from  public  tax  dollars,  not  from  Officer  Rosen,  and \nDefendant City provided free legal representation to Officer Rosen throughout the process.   \n177.  To eliminate the pattern or practice of excessive use of force and retaliating for \nspeech they hated by Defendant City Police Officers, structural reform, modified policies, and \ncivilian monitoring should, in addition to other policies and practices that may be deemed \nnecessary after further discovery of the facts, include: \na.  Creation of a civilian review board empowered, funded, and staffed to \nreceive complaints from individuals who believe they have been the victims of \nexcessive use of force and/or retaliation for their speech; to investigate those \ncomplaints; and to recommend discipline which the Director of the Department of \nPublic Safety must mete out absent clear and convincing evidence that the Board \nbased the recommendation on inaccurate facts. \nb.  Prohibition of the use by Defendant City Division of Police and/or mutual \naid law enforcement personnel cooperating with the Division of tear gas, rubber \nor wooden bullets, sonic cannons, bean bag rounds, smoke bombs, grenades, or \ncannisters, pepper spray, flashbang grenades, kettling, chokeholds, strangleholds, \nno-knock warrants, and pressure or weight on the neck, back, or hip of a prone \nsuspect. \nc.

Scheduling meetings in predominantly minority neighborhoods to listen to \ncivilian concerns; to acknowledge that past law enforcement practices, starting \nwith the roots of modern policing in Southern States as slave patrols and later the \nenforcement  of  Jim  Crow  segregation,  proceeding  through  acquiescence  in \nlynching, racist mobs, and/or Ku Klux Klan activities, and culminating in the \ndisproportionate focus on minorities in the war on drug use and abuse and related \ntraffic stops, have created a rift which must be healed; and to discuss steps which \nmight contribute to that healing. \no.

Alsaada \n40 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 41 of 118  PAGEID #: 123\n178.  On May 30, 2020, Ms. Alsaada, in her position as Organizing Director for the \nPeople’s Justice Project, showed up to a Black Lives Matter rally organized in front of the Ohio \nStatehouse with the goal of helping to lead the rally and to advocate for police reform. \n179.  Ms. Alsaada did not plan the event; however, given her role in the community she \nwas looked at to help provide a voice for the event.   \n180.  While  Ms.  Alsaada  and  other  members  of  the  People’s  Justice  Project  were \nspeaking on the microphone, protestors at the rally came to Ms. Alsaada and informed her that \nprotestors were being arrested by Columbus Police Officers without justification. \n181.  Again, due to her role as a respected community organizer, even serving on \nMayor Ginther’s Community Safety Advisory Commission, Ms. Alsaada and others walked over \nto the intersection of Broad and High to help resolve any pending conflicts.  \n182.  Ms. Alsaada saw Deputy Chief Michael Woods standing near the intersection, \nwho she knew from her time on the Mayor’s Community Safety Advisory Commission.  \n183.  Ms. Alsaada noticed there were lines of police officers at the intersection on \nbicycles, on horseback, and in riot gear.  \n184.  Ms. Alsaada asked Deputy Chief Woods who was being arrested, and he informed \nher that no one was being arrested.  \n185.  Ms. Alsaada asked Deputy Chief Woods to have the officers clear a path so that \nshe could walk through and continue to address the topic of arrestees, and he subsequently had \nthe officers allow her through.  \n186.  As Ms. Alsaada and others walked through the line of officers in order to continue \npeacefully  discussing  any  arrestees,  Columbus  Police  Officers  without  notice,  without  any \n41 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 42 of 118  PAGEID #: 124\nwarning,  and  without  any  provocation,  began  to  assault  Ms.  Alsaada  and  others  with  an \nonslaught of pepper spray. \n187.  Ms. Alsaada fell to the ground due to the assault and was unable to breathe or see. \n188.  Ms.  Alsaada  was  carried  to  the  corner  of  Broad  and  High  where  she  was \nadministered medical attention by volunteer medics.  \n189.  Ms.  Alsaada  and  numerous  others  suffered  injuries  and  trauma  due  to  the \nunprovoked assault by Columbus Police Officers.  \nF.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Mahir Ali \n190.  On May 30, 2020, Mr. Ali was peacefully protesting police brutality and racial \ninjustice in Downtown Columbus, near the intersection of Cleveland Avenue and Broad Street.   \n191.  As  Mr.  Ali  was  involved  in  the  peaceful  protest,  Columbus  Police  Officers \nformed a line and began moving towards Mr. Ali and other protestors. \n192.  A Columbus Police Officer singled out and targeted Mr. Ali by approaching him \nand attempting to pepper spray him. \n193.  Mr. Ali was able to evade most of the pepper spray and, as he did, he yelled out, \n“Hands up! Don’t shoot!”, repeatedly in an attempt to avoid becoming the victim of any police \nbrutality. \n194.  Mr.  Ali  then  noticed  one  Columbus  Police  Officer,  who  appeared  to  be  a \nsupervisor or commanding officer, instruct another officer to shoot Mr. Ali.  \n195.  That officer then aimed at Mr. Ali and shot him in the left leg with a rubber bullet. \n196.  After getting shot, Mr. Ali was able to gather himself and found a parked car that \nhe then used to shield and protect him from the Columbus Police Officers who had targeted him. \n42 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 43 of 118  PAGEID #: 125\n197.   While hiding behind this parked car, Mr. Ali witnessed Columbus Police Officers \nshoot two other peaceful protestors, a male and a female, who happened to be riding bikes. \n198.  Mr. Ali continued to hide and protect himself while he witnessed Columbus \nPolice Officers attack other protestors.  \n199.  Mr. Ali was able to call his wife and, after approximately 15 minutes, Mr. Ali’s \nwife was able to locate and rescue him.  \n200.  Mr. Ali then went home and attempted to treat his bruises and muscle aches.  \nG.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Demetrius Burke   \n201.  On Wednesday, June 3, 2020, late at night, Mr. Burke was inside his apartment \nnear the intersection of East Starr Avenue and North 9th Street when he heard sirens and a \ncommotion outside.   \n202.  Mr. Burke’s motorcycle was then parked in his apartment complex’s parking lot. \n203.  Because he was concerned that whatever was  going on outside would cause \ndamage to his motorcycle, Mr. Burke went outside to get his motorcycle and move it to a garage \nprovided by his apartment complex. \n204.  When he reached his motorcycle, Mr. Burke observed police officers walking \nnorth on North 9th Street and decided to ask the officers what was going on.   \n205.  Because he is an African-American male, Mr. Burke was concerned that the \npolice would act violently towards him and so he turned on his cellphone camera and filmed as \nhe approached the officers.   \n206.  Mr. Burke was aware that the City of Columbus had imposed a 10:00 p.m. curfew \non all residents in public areas and so he was careful to remain on his own property and not step \ninto the street while approaching the Columbus Police Officers.   \n43 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 44 of 118  PAGEID #: 126\n \n \n \n \n207.  Mr. Burke’s cellphone video clearly shows that he remained on the grass at all \ntimes and did not enter the street. \n208.  Below is a true and accurate copy of that video (double click to play or click \n20200603_003718.mp4). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n44 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 45 of 118  PAGEID #: 127\n209.  When he was within speaking distance of the Columbus Police Officers, Mr. \nBurke asked, “What’s happening”?  \n210.  A  Columbus  Police  Officer,  later  identified  as  Defendant  Kenneth  Kirby, \napproached Mr. Burke and answered, “I’m sure you know you’re out after curfew, right?” \n211.  Mr. Burke responded, “I live right here, I’m on my property.” \n212.  Defendant Kirby then said, “You’re standing on the street, come here.”   \n213.  Mr. Burke protested that he was “right here, I’m on the grass.”   \n214.  Defendant Kirby then stated that “it doesn’t matter, you’re under arrest” and \nfalsely told another officer that Mr. Burke was standing in the street. \n215.  An officer then used a zip tie to restrain Mr. Burke’s hands behind his back.   \n216.  Mr. Burke was then transported to a nearby fire station being used to process \nindividuals who had been arrested during the George Floyd protests.   \n217.  From the fire station, Mr. Burke was taken to the Jackson Pike Correctional \nCenter, where he was placed in a cell with other arrested individuals.   \n218.  In the cell where Mr. Burke was detained, there were many individuals who had \nbeen arrested for issues not related to the protest, including felonies and violent crimes.  \n219.   During his time in the cell, Mr. Burke witnessed an intensely violent fight, which \nwas terrifying and put him at risk of physical harm.   \n220.  Mr. Burke remained in the cell until early afternoon when his friend posted bail \nfor him.   \n221.  On Tuesday, June 9, 2020, Mr. Burke’s curfew violation charges were dismissed \nas part of the blanket dismissal of curfew violations. \nH.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Bernadette Calvey \n45 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 46 of 118  PAGEID #: 128\n222.  On May 30, 2020, Ms. Calvey was in the Short North area, accompanied by a \nroommate. \n223.  Although Ms. Calvey had not intended to participate in a protest, she and her \nroommate were walking in the vicinity of Second Avenue and High Street when they heard \nprotestors nearby. \n224.  They  walked in  the direction of the protests to see what  was  going  on and \npotentially join the protest since they agreed with the message against police brutality and \nracism. \n225.  Ms. Calvey was aware that there had been a curfew imposed that evening, but it \nwas approximately 9:00 p.m., she was not far from her residence, and the curfew would not start \nfor another hour. \n226.  As Ms. Calvey approached the protest, it appeared peaceful, though Columbus \nPolice Officers were massed in the street approximately 50 feet away from where she was \nstanding.   \n227.  The Columbus Police Officers were shouting at the protestors and began firing \nprojectiles at them at close range. \n228.  Within moments of approaching the protest, Ms. Calvey was struck in the face by \na projectile that, upon information and belief, was a wooden bullet.   \n229.  The wooden bullet split open her chin and caused excruciating pain. \n230.  The round that hit Ms. Calvey in the face had been directly fired at her with the \nintention of hitting her and had not been “skip-fired” as a “knee-knocker” off the ground.  \n46 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 47 of 118  PAGEID #: 129\n231.  A  true  and  accurate  picture  of  her  injury  the  morning  after  is  below:\n \n47 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 48 of 118  PAGEID #: 130\n232.  Ms. Calvey and her roommate fled down a side alley, where she received water \nand bandages from a group of protestors. \n233.  Ms. Calvey was forced to miss two days of work due to her facial injury and \nremained unable to chew solid food for approximately a week due to the pain in her jaw.   \n234.  The projectile wound has created a prominent scar on Ms. Calvey’s chin, which \nappears to be permanent. \nI.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Stephanie Carlock \n235.  In the late afternoon of Saturday, May 30, 2020, near the Statehouse, around \nBroad and High Streets, Ms. Carlock joined friends who were protesting against police brutality \nand racism. \n236.  When  Ms.  Carlock  arrived  at  the  protest,  non-emergency  traffic  had  been \nrerouted, and she and others were standing stationary in the crosswalk across High Street.   \n237.  Many  Columbus  Police  Officers  were  there  dressed  in  riot  gear,  but  no \nannouncements were made and no orders were given.  \n238.  While Ms. Carlock was standing stationary in the crosswalk, a Columbus Police \nOfficer in riot gear sprayed her in the face with pepper spray at close range with no provocation, \ncausing Ms. Carlock intense pain and affecting her vision. \n239.  Columbus  Police  Officers  began  pushing  the  crowd  of  people  in  which  Ms. \nCarlock was standing with their riot shields and telling them to leave.   \n240.  A van rolled up and many Columbus Police Officers or Franklin County Sheriff’s \nOffice Deputies left the van and began firing projectiles at the crowd. \n48 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 49 of 118  PAGEID #: 131\n241.  Ms. Carlock and her companions then moved to the Statehouse lawn, but mounted \nColumbus  Police  Officers  approached  and  used  their  horses  to  push  the  crowd  out  of  the \nStatehouse area.   \n242.  Ms. Carlock moved onto Broad Street and began walking east, with mounted \nColumbus Police Officers following the crowd and using their horses to push it further down \nBroad Street. \n243.  Ms. Carlock and her companions reached the intersection of Broad Street and \nFifth Street and were standing on the sidewalk, next to the plaque recognizing the site of the first \nWendy’s restaurant.   \n244.  Columbus Police Officers were still pushing the crowd, and Ms. Carlock and \nothers were asking them where they wanted the protestors to go. \n245.  Instead of answering and directing the crowd, the mounted Columbus Police \nOfficers rode their horses onto the sidewalk and began pushing their horses into the crowd.   \n246.  Ms. Carlock was struck by the legs of horses purposely being ridden into her and \nother protestors. \n247.  Ms. Carlock and others in the crowd continued to walk to the next corner, at \nwhich point they were confronted by Columbus Police Officers on bicycles.   \n248.  These  officers  cornered  the  crowd  against  a  building,  on  the  sidewalk,  and \ndeployed tear gas, causing Ms. Carlock to choke and cough and have difficulty breathing. \n249.  Ms. Carlock and others asked the officers why they were tear-gassing a peaceful \ncrowd on a sidewalk, and, instead of answering, the officers laughed while the protestors choked \non the gas.   \n250.  Ms. Carlock fled and rejoined protestors in another area. \n49 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 50 of 118  PAGEID #: 132\n251.  The following evening, Sunday, May 31, at around 8 p.m., Ms. Carlock and a \nfriend went to the Short North area of Columbus, walking down High Street toward downtown, \non the sidewalk, seeking to join another protest against police brutality and racism.   \n252.  Ms. Carlock was aware there was a curfew of 10:00 p.m. that evening, but it was \nstill 40 minutes before curfew (approximately 9:20 p.m.), when the group she was in approached \nthe intersection of High Street and Spring Street.   \n253.  Ms. Carlock and the protestors she had joined were peaceful, walking on the \npublic sidewalk, and not disobeying any orders from law enforcement.  \n254.  As Ms. Carlock neared Spring Street, a black van pulled up and Columbus Police \nOfficers in riot gear jumped out.   \n255.  Without  warning,  the  officers  began  shooting  projectiles  and  tear  gas  at  the \ncrowd.   \n256.  Ms. Carlock was once again exposed to tear gas, affecting her breathing and \ncausing her to choke and cough. \nJ.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff S.L.C. \n257.  On May 30, 2020, S.L.C. traveled from Hamilton County, with his uncle, Plaintiff \nJ. Horn, to downtown Columbus, Ohio, where they met his cousin, Plaintiff K. Horn, and his \ncousin’s girlfriend.  \n258.  Prior to traveling to Columbus, Mr. C. had created hand-drawn signs with “Black \nLives Matter” and the names of some of the victims of police brutality.  \n259.  Mr. C. was intending to protest peacefully by holding his hand-drawn signs. \n260.  Mr. C. and his family joined a group of peaceful protestors.  \n50 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 51 of 118  PAGEID #: 133\n261.  After  being  there  less  than  15  minutes,  Mr.  C.  witnessed  Columbus  Police \nOfficers throw tear gas canisters at another group of peaceful protestors, and he and Plaintiff K. \nHorn went over to help the protestors who had been tear-gassed. \n262.  They  moved  the  injured  protestors  to  a  different  location  because  Columbus \nPolice Officers were throwing tear-gas canisters all around the area.   \n263.  In the commotion of helping the other injured protestors, Mr. C. got disconnected \nfrom his family and then joined another group of protestors who were walking and carrying signs \npeacefully.  \n264.  While in the middle of this group of protestors, Columbus Police Officers threw \nfour canisters of tear gas into Mr. C.’s group. \n265.  The tear gas reached Mr. C.’s eyes, causing a severe burning sensation.  \n266.  There was no one there to offer medical assistance, so Mr. C. ran from the area \nwhere he was struck with tear gas, sat down on a sidewalk, and applied water to his eyes until the \npain subsided slightly. \n267.  Mr. C. was able to reconnect with his family and decided to continue his peaceful \nprotest with his cousin. \n268.  Mr. C. witnessed Plaintiff K. Horn get struck in the leg with a wooden bullet \nwhile trying to run from tear gas in the area.  \n269.    Mr. C. observed Plaintiff K. Horn during this entire period, and Plaintiff K. Horn \ndid not act violently or aggressively in any way before being struck.  \n270.  Mr. C. and his uncle, Plaintiff J. Horn, returned home to Hamilton County the \nevening of May 30, 2020, and did not return again for any protests.  \nK.  Mistreatment of Jennifer Eidemiller \n51 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 52 of 118  PAGEID #: 134\n271.  On May 30, 2020, in the early evening, Ms. Eidemiller, who resides near where \nprotests were taking place in downtown Columbus, decided to join the peaceful protests against \npolice brutality. \n272.  Ms. Eidemiller had been protesting with others for around ten minutes when she \nfound herself on Third Street. \n273.  Ms. Eidemiller began to cross the street legally by remaining in the crosswalk. \n274.  When Ms. Eidemiller reached the sidewalk, though, she and a group of other \npeaceful protestors were pepper-sprayed at point-blank range. \n275.  Ms. Eidemiller’s vision was temporarily impaired, and the pain in her eyes was \nterrible.  \n276.  The Columbus Police Officer who sprayed Ms. Eidemiller sprayed everyone in \nthe area collectively and indiscriminately.   \n277.  Ms. Eidemiller also witnessed officers on horseback attacking peaceful protestors. \n278.  Ms. Eidemiller was taken by medics who immediately provided care for her at the \nscene. \n279.  After being treated by the medics and given instructions on how to self-treat her \ninjuries, Ms. Eidemiller went home and followed those instructions in order to cope with the \neffects of the chemical spray on her body. \n280.  The  next  morning,  May  31,  2020,  Ms.  Eidemiller  returned  to  downtown \nColumbus, along with two friends, in order to continue to peacefully protest police brutality. \n281.  As they approached the scene of protests already taking place, they noticed a \ngroup of protestors and organizers in the intersection of Broad and High Streets, near the east \nside of the intersection.  \n52 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 53 of 118  PAGEID #: 135\n282.  Ms. Eidemiller proceeded to lock arms with them and chant out calls for justice. \n283.  Protestors stood there peacefully for approximately 30 minutes. \n284.  Columbus Police Officers then announced that they would begin using chemical \nweapons if protestors did not leave the area. \n285.  As the protestors were attempting to disperse, Columbus Police Officers used \nvarious chemical weapons. \n286.  Ms.  Eidemiller  was  pepper-sprayed  three  or  four  times  at  close  range  by  a \nColumbus Police Officer. \n287.  Medics again treated Ms. Eidemiller at the scene and instructed her on how she \ncould deal with the pain, impaired vision, and headache from the chemical spray once she got \nhome.   \nL.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Andrew Fahmy  \n288.  On  June  1,  2020,  Mr. Fahmy  and  a  friend  went  to  downtown  Columbus  to \nparticipate in the protests.   \n289.  They arrived at the Statehouse at 7:00 p.m. and then participated in a march north \non High Street along with several thousand other protestors.   \n290.  Eventually, at approximately 10:20 p.m., the march reached the intersection of \nLane Avenue and High Street just north of The Ohio State University. \n291.  By the time the march had reached Lane Avenue, the number of marchers had \ndwindled considerably and the march seemed to be coming to an end. \n292.  As  the  marchers  approached  Lane  Avenue  on  High  Street,  Columbus  Police \nOfficers wearing riot gear approached the marchers from the south.   \n53 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 54 of 118  PAGEID #: 136\n293.  When the Columbus Police Officers were within approximately 15 feet of the \nremaining marchers, they began spraying pepper spray.   \n294.  The pepper spraying caused the remaining marchers to run in all directions.  \n295.  Mr. Fahmy retreated east on Lane Avenue along with many other marchers.  \n296.  The  Columbus  Police  Officers  then  formed  a  line  across  Lane  Avenue \napproximately 200 feet east of High Street facing east. \n297.  Mr.  Fahmy  and  other  protestors  got  out  their  phones  and  began  filming  the \nColumbus Police Officers, who were approximately 20 feet away.   \n298.  None  of  the  protestors  were  behaving  violently  or  throwing  anything  at  the \nColumbus Police Officers.  \n299.  Mr. Fahmy then observed the Columbus Police Officers preparing to fire tear gas \ncanisters. \n300.  Before Mr. Fahmy could move out of the way, the Columbus Police Officers shot \ntear gas canisters directly into the crowd. \n301.  Mr. Fahmy was hit in the leg with a canister, which fractured his fibula, causing \nsevere pain, and requiring treatment. \n302.  True and accurate pictures of his injuries, including an x-ray of the fracture, are \nshown below. \n54 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 55 of 118  PAGEID #: 137\n \n55 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 56 of 118  PAGEID #: 138\n \n56 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 57 of 118  PAGEID #: 139\nM.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Talon Garth    \n303.  On May 31, 2020, Mr. Garth attended a downtown protest of police abuse. \n304.  In the early evening, along with hundreds of other protestors, Mr. Garth was \nstanding in the street at the intersection of Broad and High Streets.   \n305.  That  intersection  and  several  blocks  had  long  been  closed  that  evening  to \nvehicular traffic.   \n306.  While Mr. Garth was standing at the intersection, a Columbus Division of Police \nArmored Vehicle with the word acronym SWAT painted on the side pulled into the intersection \nand stopped.   \n307.  After the armored SWAT vehicle stopped, a team of officers disembarked from it. \n308.  The SWAT officers began to tell the crowd standing at Broad and High Street to \nmove.   \n309.  Prior to the arrival of the SWAT officers, the protest at Broad and High had been \npeaceful, with no violence or attacks on property.   \n310.  Prior to the arrival of the SWAT officers, protestors at Broad and High had \nmaintained a good relationship with Ohio Highway Patrol Officers stationed at the Statehouse. \n311.  Because there was no vehicular traffic on Broad or High Streets, there was no \nreason for the protestors to be removed from the streets.   \n312.  After being told to move, Mr. Garth and more than 100 other protestors close to \nthe SWAT officers sat down on the street in an act of passive resistance. \n313.  Mr. Garth was then approximately ten feet away from the SWAT Officers.  \n314.  At this point, a few individuals in the back of the huge crowd, who were not \namong those sitting close to the SWAT officers, threw several water bottles at them.   \n57 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 58 of 118  PAGEID #: 140\n315.  It was obvious that the bottles had not been thrown by Mr. Garth or any of the \nprotestors sitting in front of the SWAT officers. \n316.  Nevertheless, the SWAT Officers immediately took deliberate aim and began \nfiring wooden bullets directly into the peaceful seated protestors who were sitting directly in \nfront of them. \n317.  The wooden bullets were around the size of pill bottles.   \n318.  Mr. Garth was struck by a total of ten wooden bullets, one on each knee, four on \nhis right leg, one on his right thigh, one in the arm, and one in the back of his head. \n319.  A wooden bullet also struck Mr. Garth in the foot, fracturing his fourth metatarsal \nbone.  \n320.  True and accurate pictures of his leg and foot injuries are below.   \n \n58 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 59 of 118  PAGEID #: 141\n \n59 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 60 of 118  PAGEID #: 142\n \n321.  Mr. Garth had to seek medical attention for his fractured foot and has been \nrequired to wear a walking boot while it heals.   \n60 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 61 of 118  PAGEID #: 143\n322.  In addition to breaking his foot, the wooden bullet caused severe lacerations to his \nshins and other parts of his body, many of which are likely to cause permanent scarring.   \n323.  As a proximate result of his injuries, Mr. Garth has been unable to work since the \nincident and has suffered significant lost income.  \nN.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Holly Hahn \n324.  At approximately 7:30 p.m. on May 30, 2020, Ms. Hahn traveled west from \nItalian Village towards the protest that was taking place at the intersection of High Street and the \nI-670 cap. \n325.  Ms. Hahn’s intention that day was to videotape the interactions of protestors with \nthe police. \n326.  Around 8:00 p.m., Ms. Hahn arrived at the intersection of High and Russell \nStreets just as protestors there were being pushed north by Franklin County Sheriff’s Deputies in \nSWAT uniforms.   \n327.  Ms. Hahn stood on the sidewalk at the southeast side of the intersection and began \nfilming the protestors who were backing up High Street. \n328.  Shortly after Ms. Hahn began filming, SWAT Officers executed their surrounding \nmaneuver on Russell Street. \n329.  Ms. Hahn did not hear any order to leave the area. \n330.  In  reviewing  the  videotape  recording  she  made,  Ms.  Hahn  heard  that  order; \nhowever, the noise and chaos where she was standing rendered it inaudible to her at the time. \n331.  Ms. Hahn was tackled to the ground, maced directly in the face at close range, and \nhandcuffed. \n61 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 62 of 118  PAGEID #: 144\n332.  While Ms. Hahn was handcuffed and blinded on the street, a Columbus Police \nOfficer approached her, told her to look at him, and then stated, “You should be ashamed of \nyourself.  You shouldn’t be here, you should be at home making cookies.” \n333.  Ms. Hahn was placed in a police wagon for several hours, where her hands were \nhandcuffed behind her back, she was not given water, mace remained on her face, and Columbus \nPolice Officers then transported her to an emergency room where she was examined for a \nconcussion, treated for chemical burns, had her face cleansed and took a shower, and given a CT \nscan.  \n334.  Ms. Hahn was given a citation for a minor misdemeanor count of failing to \ndisperse by Officer Michael Laird, stating that on the 30th day of May, Ms. Hahn knowingly \nfailed to comply with the order of a law enforcement officer or public official to disperse from \nthe scene of a riot and defining riot as five or more persons participating in a course of disorderly \nconduct, specifically throwing rocks and bricks at police officers and interfering with another’s \narrest.     \n335.  On June 23, 2020, the charge against Ms. Hahn was dismissed.   \n336.  Previously, on May 28, 2020, Ms. Hahn had gone to the protest taking place near \nthe intersection of Broad and High Streets, arriving around 8:30 p.m. \n337.  Ms. Hahn’s intent in attending the protest was to video the interactions of the \nprotestors and the police, and she paid special attention to individuals who seemed to be in \nagitated conversations with police officers. \n338.   Ms. Hahn found herself towards the front of the protest near a police line and \nfilming an African-American female who was being vocally aggressive to a police officer.  \n62 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 63 of 118  PAGEID #: 145\n339.  While Ms. Hahn was filming, something happened to her right that caught her \nattention, and she saw a group of Columbus Police Officers quickly move towards the protestors. \n340.  One Columbus Police Officer knocked her cellphone out of Ms. Hahn’s hand. \n341.  Nearly simultaneously, another Columbus Police Officer then pepper-sprayed Ms. \nHahn in the left side of her face, blinding her in one eye. \n342.  Columbus Police Officers then grabbed Ms. Hahn by her ponytail and wrist and \nbegan to take her to the ground.   \n343.  As Ms. Hahn was going down, out of her right eye she observed a Columbus \nPolice Officer stomping on her phone. \n344.  While Ms. Hahn was being taken down, the Columbus Police Officer who had her \nwrist began screaming at her to “turn it.”   \n345.  Because of a prior medical issue, Ms. Hahn’s wrist bones are fused, and she is \nunable to turn the wrist; however, she was able to partially use the wrist to break her fall. \n346.  When Ms. Hahn landed on the ground, her fused wrist was partially under her \nbody and a Columbus Police Officer was trying to pull it from under her and yelling at her to \nturn it.  \n347.  Ms. Hahn attempted to tell the Columbus Police Officer that she could not turn \nthe wrist because it was fused. \n348.  The Columbus Police Officer then grabbed Ms. Hahn by the ponytail, used it as a \nhandle to slam her face on the ground, and then handcuffed her.   \n349.  After being handcuffed, Ms. Hahn was placed in the back of a police car for three \nhours.  \n63 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 64 of 118  PAGEID #: 146\n350.  Ms. Hahn was then released and told that she would be receiving an “indictment” \nin the mail. \n351.  Ms. Hahn was never charged with any crime as a result of the events of the \nevening of May 28, 2020. \n352.  The pepper spray continued to irritate her eye and the she suffered pain, bruises, \nand headaches from the physical force used by Columbus Police Officers.   \nO.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Bryan Hazlett \n353.  On May 30, 2020, Mr. Hazlett and a friend decided to attend a downtown protest \nthat was occurring near the I-670 Cap over High Street by the intersection of Goodale and High \nStreets. \n354.  At approximately 6:30 p.m., Mr. Hazlett and his friend arrived in the Short North \nand parked near the intersection of High Street and First Avenue. \n355.  Before heading south to join the protest, Mr. Hazlett and his friend spent time \nlocating another friend who was meeting up with them.   \n356.  After locating the other friend, Mr. Hazlett and his group began walking towards \nthe protest on High Street, which was taking place near the intersection of West Poplar Avenue \nand High Street, arriving around 8:00 p.m. \n357.  Upon  Mr.  Hazlett’s  arrival,  he  observed  approximately  20  Franklin  County \nSheriff’s Deputies forming a line across High Street, took a picture of the line of officers, and a \ntrue and accurate copy of that picture is below. \n64 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 65 of 118  PAGEID #: 147\n \n358.  After arriving at the protest, Mr. Hazlett held a sign and participated in chants. \n359.  Shortly after his arrival, Franklin County Sheriff’s Deputies played a recording \ntelling protestors to leave.   \n360.  Mr. Hazlett took the recording to mean that protestors should get off the street and \nonto the sidewalk, and he retreated to the sidewalk on the south side of the street.  . \n361.  Unbeknownst to Mr. Hazlett, the Franklin County Sheriff’s Deputies forming the \nline were SWAT officers assisted by Columbus Police Officers. \n362.  The SWAT officers were on the scene as part of planned maneuver to surround, \nattack, and arrest the protestors on High Street. \n363.  As part of the SWAT team’s plan, coordinated in advance with Columbus Police \nDivision SWAT and officers, the SWAT officers stationed at the I-670 Cap were to advance \n65 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 66 of 118  PAGEID #: 148\nnorth on High Street, driving the protestors north by showering them with glass from broken \nwindows, directly shooting them with wooden bullets, and spraying them with tear gas and \npepper spray.  \n364.  While the SWAT officers were driving the protestors north on High Street, a large \nnumber of other SWAT officers were to take up positions east and west of High Street on \nRussell Street, and, when the protestors on High Street were driven close to Russell Street, the \nSWAT officers were to come running out on High Street and take the protestors from the rear. \n365.  As part of the plan, it was decided in advance that all of the individuals trapped in \nthe street were to be targeted by wooden bullets, violently tackled to the ground, and pepper-\nsprayed directly in the face, regardless of whether they resisted arrest or posed any danger to the \nSWAT officers. \n366.  This plan was not made in the heat of the battle or a split-second decision but was \ncalmly created ahead of time. \n367.  The Deputies and Officers concocted a pretext for this plan, telling the media that \nan officer-in-distress call came from protestors allegedly throwing water bottles and rocks at \nthem. \n368.  The officer-in-distress call had actually been made around 6:30 p.m., two hours \nprior to the actions of the SWAT team. \n369.  Defendants determined in advance that they would make no distinction between \nindividuals  throwing  objects  at  Columbus  Police  Officers  or  mutual-aid  law  enforcement \npersonnel and those engaged in peaceful protesting, videotaping the events, serving as medics or \nreporters, and/or residing in the neighborhood. \n66 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 67 of 118  PAGEID #: 149\n370.  Franklin County Sheriff’s Office Sergeant Ray DeBolt, whose officers were also \ninvolved  in  the  surrounding  operation,  admitted  that  he  had  no  idea  whether  the  people \nsurrounded on the street were protestors or rioters: “I can’t tell who’s a protester and who’s a \nrioter at that point.” \n371.  Instead of making an effort to determine which individuals had actually engaged \nin violence towards the police, Defendants decided in advance to inflict group punishment, with \nall individuals present  on the street being shot with wooden bullets, violently tackled, and \npepper-sprayed at close range. \n372.  By May 30, 2020, Defendants had seen videos of Columbus Police Officers \nengaging in unnecessary violence against protestors, including the assault of a United States \nCongresswoman; were aware that the Officers were undertrained and incapable of engaging in \nconstitutional crowd control; and took no remedial steps, including reconsidering the weaponry \nused by the Columbus Police Officers and mutual aid law enforcement personnel cooperating \nwith them. \n373.  Further, Defendants knew by then that some of Columbus Police Officers and \nmutual aid law enforcement personnel cooperating with them were incapable of keeping their \ncool during demonstrations and were prone to violence.   \n374.  Nevertheless, such officers were placed in a position where they would be directly \ninteracting with protestors. \n375.  Defendants  also  then  knew  that  Columbus  Police  Officers  were  routinely \ndisregarding the requirement that wooden bullets be skip-fired and instead were directly firing \nthem at protestors.   \n67 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 68 of 118  PAGEID #: 150\n376.  Despite that knowledge, Defendants continued to equip Columbus Police Officers \nwith wooden bullet launchers knowing they would be misused.   \n377.  After Mr. Hazlett had retreated, he observed that SWAT Officers opened fire with \nwooden bullets  at  the second-floor windows of buildings along  High  Street,  shattering the \nwindows and causing glass to rain down on Mr. Hazlett and other protestors standing on the \nsidewalk. \n378.  The SWAT Officers intended to not only inflict pain on the protestors but also to \ncause property damage which could be blamed on the protestors and then justify additional use \nof violence. \n379.  In order to avoid the falling glass, Mr. Hazlett walked to the curb of the sidewalk. \n380.  Columbus Police Officers or mutual-aid law enforcement personnel were then \nmarching up the street direct-firing wooden bullets at any protestors they saw, and protestors in \nthe street were being pushed towards Russell Street. \n381.  Approximately ten of the protestors had been in the middle of the street with \nsheets of plywood in front of them to block flying wooden bullets.   \n382.  As Columbus Police Officers or mutual-aid law enforcement personnel marched \ntoward them, the protestors picked up their sheets of plywood and began walking backwards \nnorth on High Street while using the plywood to block flying wooden bullets. \n383.  Mr. Hazlett realized as the protestors were being herded towards Russell Street \nthat serious danger lurked, and he began to look around for his friend, a younger female, to tell \nher that they needed to get out of there right away.   \n384.  When Mr. Hazlett  located his  friend, she was  one of the protestors walking \nbackwards with the sheets of plywood. \n68 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 69 of 118  PAGEID #: 151\n385.  Mr. Hazlett then stepped off the sidewalk into the street to get his friend and drag \nher out of the situation.   \n386.  As soon as Mr. Hazlett left the sidewalk, he was hit in the shin by a wooden \nbullet. \n387.  Mr. Hazlett continued into the street, ran up to his friend, and yelled, “We need to \nget the fuck out of here.” \n388.  Just as Mr. Hazlett was entering the street, cruisers driven by Columbus Police \nOfficers  or  mutual-aid  law  enforcement  personnel  increased  their  rate  of  speed  and  drove \ndirectly toward the group of protestors walking backward, only veering off to the side at the last \nsecond. \n389.  Thinking that they were about to be hit by the cars, the protestors immediately \ndropped the sheets of plywood and ran north. \n390.  At just this moment, SWAT Officers hiding on both sides of Russell Street ran \nonto High Street and attacked both the protestors running from the street and individuals who \nwere on the sidewalk or trying to cross High Street at the crosswalk. \n391.  Implementing  their prearranged plan  for  group punishment,  Columbus Police \nOfficers  and/or  mutual-aid  law  enforcement  personnel  methodically  pepper-sprayed  fleeing \nprotestors in the face at close range and, while the protestors could not see, other Officers \nviolently tackled the protestors to the ground. \n392.  To inflict pain and teach the protestors a lesson, SWAT Officers even pepper-\nsprayed protestors while they were helplessly restrained on the ground. \n393.  One particularly excited SWAT Officer launched himself like a bowling ball into \na group of individuals crossing High Street, knocking at least three of them to the ground. \n69 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 70 of 118  PAGEID #: 152\n394.  Along with the rest of the protestors in the middle of the street, Mr. Hazlett ran \nfrom the onrushing police cars. \n395.  As can be seen in the below videos (double click to play or click the links), which \ntruly and accurately reflect the events, before he had taken more than a couple of steps Mr. \nHazlett was pepper-sprayed in the face at point-blank range by an officer as Mr. Hazlett raised \nhis  hand  in  the  air.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/nr6t9y2ph8yydv7/IMG_0113.mov?dl=0  and \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/u954qu086ecsn9m/06-05-\n2020%20officers%20tackling%20protesters%20in%20the%20Short%20North.mp4?dl=0.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n70 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 71 of 118  PAGEID #: 153\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n71 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 72 of 118  PAGEID #: 154\n396.  After  he  was  hit  by  the  pepper  spray,  Mr.  Hazlett  was  completely  blinded, \nstaggered forward several steps, and then began to pull up.  \n397.  As the officers from Russell Street ran out to arrest protestors, one officer, later \nidentified as Defendant Columbus Police Officer Michael Eschenburg, Badge Number 2734, \nhung back awaiting the opportunity to violently attack a protestor. \n398.  Defendant Eschenburg harbored animosity and anger towards what the protestors \nstood for and wanted to impress other Columbus Police Officers with his body-slamming a \nprotestor. \n399.  As is reflected on the video, Defendant Eschenburg waited to target a protestor \nwho had been sprayed in the face with pepper spray and blinded. \n400.  As  Mr.  Hazlett  stumbled  after  being  pepper  sprayed,  Defendant  Eschenburg \nobserved that Mr. Hazlett had been sprayed in the face with pepper spray and was now a helpless \ntarget, and he then lined up Mr. Hazlett for a body slam. \n72 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 73 of 118  PAGEID #: 155\n401.  As can be seen in the video, Defendant Eschenburg never attempted a tackle or an \narm-bar takedown; instead, he kept himself aligned with Mr. Hazlett’s front. \n402.  Defendant  Eshenburg  is  a  large,  muscular  man  who  was  fully  dressed  in \nprotective tactical gear and equipped with both lethal and less-than-lethal weaponry.   \n403.  Defendant Eschenburg had been trained in numerous forms of physical combat. \n404.  Defendant  Eschenburg  was  among  50  or  more  SWAT  Officers,  all  as  fully \ndressed, armed, and trained as he was. \n405.  Mr. Hazlett is considerably smaller than Defendant Eschenburg; was wearing a t-\nshirt, shorts, and tennis shoes; had no combat training; and was completely blinded by pepper \nspray.   \n406.  As can be seen in the video, after Defendant Eschenburg had lined Mr. Hazlett up, \nhe charged towards him, making no effort to tackle Mr. Hazlett or take him to the ground, and, \ninstead, bent down to hit Mr. Hazlett in his midsection. \n407.  After hitting Mr. Hazlett in the midsection, Defendant Eschenburg physically \npicked Mr. Hazlett up in the air and then jumped forward, throwing Mr. Hazlett on his back with \nDefendant Eschenburg’s full weight on him.   \n408.  As Defendant Eschenburg had planned, Mr. Hazlett’s primary point of contact \nwith the pavement was his back and neck area, and that maneuver easily could have caused a \nbroken neck and permanent paralysis. \n409.  After  being  pepper-sprayed  and  slammed  to  the  ground,  Mr.  Hazlett  was \ncompletely disoriented, and he curled up in the fetal position on the pavement.   \n410.  Several Columbus Police Officers then converged on Mr. Hazlett as he was lying \nin the street.   \n73 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 74 of 118  PAGEID #: 156\n411.  In response to Columbus Police Officers yelling at Mr. Hazlett to give them his \narm, he told them that his arm was injured and that he was blinded. \n412.  One Columbus Police Officer then kicked or kneed him in the back, and another \nsprayed him in the face with pepper spray at point blank range. \n413.  Mr. Hazlett’s hands were then placed in handcuffs and taken to the curb. \n414.  Columbus Police Officers took Mr. Hazlett to a makeshift police station where he \nremained for six hours and was then transported to the Franklin County Jail at Jackson Pike. \n415.  Mr. Hazlett was bleeding, injured, and still covered with pepper spray, and the jail \nstaff at Jackson Pike refused to admit him. \n416.  After the jail refused to accept Mr. Hazlett, he was taken back to downtown \nColumbus where he was given a citation for a fourth-degree misdemeanor count of failing to \ndisperse and dropped off on the street. \n417.  In a great deal of pain from his leg injury, Mr. Hazlett limped through downtown \nup to the Short North to get his car. \n418.  On June 16, 2020, the criminal charge against Mr. Hazlett was dismissed.   \nP.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Justin Horn  \n419.  On May 30, 2020, around 5:30 p.m., Mr. J. Horn arrived in downtown Columbus \nwith the intent to peacefully protest police brutality and racial injustice.  \n420.  Mr. J. Horn was accompanied by his son, Kurghan Horn; his nephew, a 16-year-\nold minor, Plaintiff S.L.C.; and his son’s significant other. \n421.  After they parked they walked toward the protest. \n74 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 75 of 118  PAGEID #: 157\n422.  After being at the protest for about five minutes, which up until Columbus Police \nOfficers’ order to disperse had been peaceful, Mr. J. Horn’s son was tear-gassed and shot with a \nwooden bullet, and Plaintiff S.L.C. was tear-gassed. \n423.    Mr. J. Horn walked to where Columbus Police Officers were standing in front of \nthe protestors, and he began videotaping their bombarding protestors. \n424.  Mr. J. Horn videotaped for approximately an hour. \n425.  As  he  started  to  walk  away,  Mr.  J.  Horn  was  tackled  by  Columbus  Police \nOfficers, and his shoulder was dislocated. \n426.  Mr. J. Horn screamed in pain and anger at the Columbus Police Officers, and one \nofficer popped his shoulder back into the socket. \n427.  Columbus Police Officers then pulled Mr. J. Horn’s arm behind his back and \nhandcuffed him. \n428.  Mr. J. Horn remained in pain and asked for medical care. \n429.  Columbus Police Officers told Mr. J. Horn that it always hurts when a shoulder is \ndislocated. \n430.  For four hours Mr. J. Horn remained handcuffed and in pain. \n431.  Columbus Police Officers told Mr. J. Horn that he would be released on his own \nrecognizance if he signed away the right to any medical care. \n432.  Columbus Police Officers transported Mr. J. Horn to a holding facility, speeding \nup and then quickly braking so that his body bounced around, and he cried out in pain. \n433.  Ultimately, Mr. J. Horn sought medical care and was diagnosed with a closed \ndisplaced fracture of the proximal end of his left humerus. \n434.  Mr. J. Horn was prescribed a lengthy rehabilitation period which he has started. \n75 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 76 of 118  PAGEID #: 158\n435.  The  fracture  continues  to  cause  Mr.  J.  Horn  pain;  a  true  and  accurate \nrepresentation of Mr. J. Horn’s back injury sustained from being tackled by the officers is shown \nbelow. \n \n \n \nQ.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Kurghan Horn \n76 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 77 of 118  PAGEID #: 159\n436.  On May 30, 2020, Mr. K. Horn was watching a live-feed on social media and \nsaw Columbus Police Officers indiscriminately throwing tear gas at peaceful protestors.  \n437.  Mr. K. Horn had prior limited first-aid training and felt the need to go to the \nprotests and provide whatever assistance he could. \n438.  Mr.  K.  Horn  headed  to  downtown  Columbus  with  his  friends  and  family \nmembers, including Plaintiffs J. Horn and S.L.C..  \n439.  They parked near The Garden, a Short North store, on High Street.  \n440.  They began helping individuals who had been tear-gassed and were hurt.  \n441.  They then approached near the front of the protest and witnessed Columbus \nPolice Officers laughing at the protestors.   \n442.  Columbus Police Officers in a vehicle then ordered everyone to disperse and \nsuddenly began throwing tear gas canisters.  \n443.  One of the canisters of tear gas was thrown towards Mr. K. Horn.  \n444.  As Mr. K. Horn picked up the canister to move it away from him, a Columbus \nPolice Officer shot him with an object in the back of his left thigh. \n445.  Mr. K. Horn started to retreat, and Columbus Police Officers continued to \nthrow tear gas canisters.  \n446.  Mr. K. Horn lost contact with his family and friends in the chaos that ensued. \n447.  Mr. K. Horn witnessed a Columbus Police Officer grasp a protestor, take her \nmask off, and then pepper-spray her in the face. \n448.  Ultimately, Mr. K. Horn was hit by wooden and/or rubber bullets over a dozen \ntimes.  \n77 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 78 of 118  PAGEID #: 160\n449.  Mr. Horn sustained painful injuries to his left thigh from one or more rubber \nbullets.  \n450.  The picture below truly and accurately reflects the bruise on his thigh caused by \none or more rubber bullets. \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nR.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Terry D. Hubby, Jr. \n451.  On the evening of May 29, 2020, Mr. Hubby joined the ongoing protests in \ndowntown Columbus.  \n452.  When Mr. Hubby arrived at the protest, the air was already filled with chemical \nagents, causing a burning sensation in his eyes and on his skin. \n453.  At  approximately  9:00  p.m.,  Mr.  Hubby  and  his  companions  arrived  at  the \nintersection of State Street and High Street where they stood on the sidewalk at the corner. \n454.  None of the people with or near Mr. Hubby was doing anything except peacefully \nprotesting, chanting slogans, and observing a large crowd of Columbus Police Officers massed in \nthe street. \n78 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 79 of 118  PAGEID #: 161\n455.  Mr. Hubby had his mobile phone in his hand and was filming the scene at the \nintersection. \n456.  Without prior warning, Columbus Police Officers opened fire on the crowd Mr. \nHubby was in with projectile weapons, including rubber and wooden bullets. \n457.  A loud announcement was made by the Columbus Police Officers as they opened \nfire, stating that crowd control devices were about to be deployed.   \n458.  There was no time between when the announcement and when the projectiles \nbegan to hit the crowd in which anyone could safely disperse or avoid the projectiles. \n459.  A true and accurate reflection and audio of what occurred was captured on the \nvideo  below  (double  click  to  play  or  click  the  link): \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/rlzcry9zbhshkcx/IMG_0119%20%281%29.mov?dl=0.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n79 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 80 of 118  PAGEID #: 162\n460.  Mr. Hubby was immediately struck by a wooden bullet which broke his kneecap, \ncausing him excruciating pain. \n461.  Mr.  Hubby  fell  to  the  ground  as  additional  projectiles  continued  striking \nprotestors and the area around them on the sidewalk. \n462.  Mr. Hubby was assisted by other protestors, including one who fashioned a splint, \nand they carried him away from the area where he had been shot.   \n463.  The other protestors did all of this while attempting to protect Mr. Hubby and \nthemselves from further injury as Columbus Police Officers continued to fire on them.   \n464.  Unable to walk or safely seek medical attention, Mr. Hubby waited for nearly an \nhour until a friend was able to transport him to Grant Hospital. \n465.  X-rays administered at the hospital revealed that Mr. Hubby’s kneecap had been \nshattered and he needed surgery. \n466.  The next day, May 30, Mr. Hubby underwent knee surgery, and a number of \nscrews and a metal plate were placed in and around his knee.   \n467.  Mr. Hubby was hospitalized for an additional two days. \n468.  Mr. Hubby is recovering from his severe knee injury and will need long-term \nrehabilitation to restore his mobility. \n469.  Mr. Hubby has Type 1 Diabetes, which makes any restriction of blood flow to his \nextremities dangerous, and he has been informed that his injury and the need to insert the screws \nand plate in his knee has greatly increased the likelihood that his leg will require amputation in \nthe future.  \nS.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Randy Kaigler \n80 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 81 of 118  PAGEID #: 163\n470.  On Thursday, May 28, 2020, at approximately 7:30 p.m., Plaintiff Kaigler was \ndriving through downtown Columbus when he observed a peaceful protest in process near the \nintersection of Broad and High Streets. \n471.  Because he believed in the message of the protest, Mr. Kaigler decided to join it, \nparking his car and proceeding on foot towards the intersection of Broad and High Streets. \n472.  While walking to the protest, Mr. Kaigler observed a group of Columbus Police \nOfficers standing on Broad Street across the street from the Ohio Statehouse. \n473.  The Columbus Police Officers observed by Mr. Kaigler did not appear to be \nengaged in crowd-control activities or carrying crowd-control paraphernalia but rather were \nmilling around a cruiser with ample room in the street to move. \n474.   When Mr. Kaigler observed the Columbus Police Officers, Broad Street was \nclosed to vehicular traffic and officers and protestors were in the street. \n475.  The protest was loud but peaceful.   \n476.  Upon  seeing  the  Columbus  Police  Officers,  Mr.  Kaigler  decided  to  make  a \npolitical statement: he walked within approximately five feet of them, stopped and raised his \narms in a “hands up, don’t shoot” position and stated to the officers “I can’t breathe.” \n477.  The “hands up, don’t shoot” gesture originated at protests after the August 9, \n2014, shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and displayed a common sign of \nsubmission which communicated that a suspect was not presenting a threat and, like Brown’s \nalleged conduct, should not be shot.   \n478.  The statement “I can’t breathe” is a reference to the 2014 killing of Eric Garner \nand 2020 killing of George Floyd. \n81 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 82 of 118  PAGEID #: 164\n479.  The Columbus Police Officers who observed and heard Mr. Kaigler knew the \norigin and meaning of those phrases. \n480.  The sun was out, and the area around Mr. Kaigler was well lit.  \n481.  Mr. Kaigler did not have any sort of weapon, and his empty hands were clearly \nvisible to the officers.   \n482.  Mr. Kaigler’s political statement did not cause any alarm or concern about their \nsafety for the group of Columbus Police Officers; indeed, when Mr. Kaigler was pepper-sprayed, \nthe other Columbus Police Officers appeared nonchalant. \n483.  After Mr. Kaigler made his statement, one of the officers, later identified as \nDefendant  Gitlitz,  casually  drew  a  canister  of  mace  or  pepper  spray  and,  without  audible \nwarning, sprayed Mr. Kaigler directly in the face at point blank range.  \n484.  This  true and accurate  copy  of  a photograph  posted by  @Cheesemaman   at \nhttps://twitter.com/Cheesemaman/status/1266788762295717888,  accurately  depicts  Defendant \nGitlitz pepper-spraying Mr. Kaigler: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n82 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 83 of 118  PAGEID #: 165\n \n83 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 84 of 118  PAGEID #: 166\n485.  After he was sprayed, Mr. Kaigler was blinded, could not breathe, and was in \nintense pain.   \n486.  Other protestors around Mr. Kaigler assisted him to a first-aid station, where his \neyes were rinsed.   \nT.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Elizabeth Koehler \n487.  During late May and early June of 2020, Ms. Koehler attended numerous protests \nin the downtown area of Columbus.   \n488.  Ms. Koehler was often pepper-sprayed as part of a group after Columbus Police \nOfficers demanded that protestors leave the street. \n489.  On at least six occasions, Ms. Koehler was pepper-sprayed when she was standing \non the sidewalk after the streets had been cleared. \n490.  On May 30, 2020, Ms. Koehler was attending a protest near the intersection of \nBroad and High Streets. \n491.  Columbus Police Officers had then established a barricade across Broad Street \nnear Third Avenue, and Broad and High Streets were completely blocked to vehicular traffic \naround their intersection. \n492.  Columbus Police Officers wished to use violence against the protestors because \nthey harbored animosity towards the political message of the protestors. \n493.  To manufacture an opportunity for that violence, throughout the day Columbus \nPolice Officers would periodically move west down Broad Street from their barricade and clear \nthe street of protestors by pepper-spraying them, driving them back to the sidewalks on both \nsides of the street.   \n84 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 85 of 118  PAGEID #: 167\n494.  Because Broad Street was blocked off, there was no danger and no reason for \nBroad Street to be cleared of protestors. \n495.  In herding the protestors, Columbus Police Officers intended to provoke them into \nfighting back, which the Officers would then use to justify increased violence. \n496.  At  approximately  5:00  p.m.,  Ms.  Koehler  was  driven  to  the  sidewalk  by \nColumbus Police Officers using pepper spray as part of their periodic street clearing. \n497.  Ms. Koehler was then positioned on the sidewalk on the south side of Broad \nStreet in front of the Ohio Statehouse. \n498.  Broad  Street  was  then  completely  clear,  and  Columbus  Police  Officers  had \nreturned to behind their barricade. \n499.  Ms. Koehler observed a Black female enter the street from the opposite (north) \nside of Broad. \n500.  It is part of the ethos of many protestors that White protestors are supposed to \nplace themselves between Columbus Police Officers and Black protestors in the expectation that \nthat Columbus Police Officers are far less likely to use force on White individuals; consequently, \nMs. Koehler entered the street intending to place herself between the police and the Black \nwoman.   \n501.  After Ms. Koehler had taken five or six steps into the street, a Columbus Police \nOfficer fired a tear gas canister directly at her, hitting her in the leg. \n502.  When  the  tear  gas  canister  was  shot  at  Ms.  Koehler,  there  were  no  other \nindividuals in her vicinity that could possibly have been a target and an ample clear area in the \nstreet for Columbus Police Officers to fire a canister without hitting a person. \n503.  The tear gas canister hit her with such force that it inflicted significant pain.   \n85 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 86 of 118  PAGEID #: 168\nU.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Rebecca Lamey \n504.  On May 31, 2020, Ms. Lamey, along with two friends, participated in a peaceful \nprotest for hours. \n505.  At 7:54 p.m., Columbus Police Officers abruptly decided to stop the protest. \n506.  At that point, Ms. Lamey and other protestors were on their knees, with their \nhands up, on the sidewalk. \n507.  Columbus Police Officers ordered the protestors to leave and appeared to be ready \nto use force against them. \n508.  Protestors started running in fear of the force, with some getting knocked down \nand trampled. \n509.  Ms. Lamey and her two friends hung back to avoid getting separated or knocked \ndown. \n510.  Ms. Lamey was filming on her cellphone, which she was holding well above her \nwaist, and walking backwards while keeping an eye on her friends. \n511.  A  Columbus  Police  Officer  turned  the  corner  and,  without  warning,  shot  a \nwooden bullet at Ms. Lamey, hitting her hand, knocking the cellphone to the ground. \n512.  When Ms. Lamey bent over to pick up her cellphone, she was shot four more \ntimes; around the same time, her friend was hit by wooden bullet in the back of the head, neck, \nand upper arm. \n513.  Based on the location where the wooden bullet hit Ms. Lamey, it must have been \ndirectly fired at her, rather than “skip-fired” off the ground. \n514.  Ms. Lamey and a friend ran to a building half a block away, and he left the stairs \nthere to get some ice for her injury. \n86 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 87 of 118  PAGEID #: 169\n515.  Moments after the friend returned with the ice and applied it to Ms. Lamey’s \nhand, he screamed, “Get behind the pillar!,” as several unmarked vans approached. \n516.  The  van  doors  opened  and  two  Columbus  Police  Officers  opened  fire  with \nwooden bullets on Ms. Lamey, her friend, and two others, striking them. \n517.  A true and accurate video of the moment Ms. Lamey was hit by the wooden \nbullets  (double  click  to  play  or  click  the  link  \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/dmu6uucrkhxmkim/Video.MOV?dl=0)  and  true  and  accurate \npictures of the swelling on Ms. Lamey’s hand and wrist and a wooden bullet which had been \nfired by Columbus Police Officers are below. \n87 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 88 of 118  PAGEID #: 170\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n88 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 89 of 118  PAGEID #: 171\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n89 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 90 of 118  PAGEID #: 172\n \n518.  The swelling took so long to go down and the pain remained so bad that Ms. \nLamey went to an Emergency Room a few days later, had X-rays, and learned that no bones \nwere broken. \n519.  Ms. Lamey has not yet recovered the full use of her hand. \nV.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Nadia Lynch \n520.  On  Saturday,  May  30,  2020,  at  approximately  11:30  a.m.,  Ms.  Lynch  was \nattending the protest at the intersection of Broad and High Streets in downtown Columbus. \n521.  The intersection had been taken over by Columbus Police Officers, who had \nformed a box at the intersection with lines of officers facing protestors. \n522.  The intersection had long been closed to vehicular traffic that afternoon, and \nmany Columbus Police Officers were milling around in the middle of the street. \n90 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 91 of 118  PAGEID #: 173\n523.  The Columbus Police Officers facing the protestors were wearing black helmets, \nblack gas masks, and black military style tactical clothing. \n524.  Ms. Lynch stepped up to greet other protestors on the other side of the police line, \ntaking a photo of other protestors and displaying the sign she had brought to the event. \n525.  Columbus Police Officers then began forming a line with their bicycles right next \nto Ms. Lynch, and she realized she was in a bad position.  \n526.  Ms. Lynch then decided to go around and started walking back to her group of \nfriends.  \n527.  Ms. Lynch was grabbed by the backpack she was wearing by Defendant Officer \nHolly Kanode and thrown down to the ground, causing her head to hit the ground.  \n528.  Three or more officers began to attack Ms. Lynch. \n529.  Ms. Lynch lay there, while they placed her hands behind her back and zip-tied \nthem.  \n530.  Before using force on her, no officer ever said anything to Ms. Lynch or yelled \nany commands. \n531.  All of these events took place in an open, well lit, and relatively calm area. \n532.  Ms. Lynch did not at any time pose a threat to a police officer or resist arrest.  \n533.  Ms. Lynch was grabbed so quickly that, even if an order had been given to her, \nshe would not have had time to comply with it. \n534.  Ms. Lynch was then arrested and taken to Jackson Pike where she was slated and \nspent two hours in jail before she bonded out.   \n535.  Ms.  Lynch  suffered  physical  injuries  due  to  the  assault  and  damage  to  her \nphysical property. \n91 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 92 of 118  PAGEID #: 174\n536.  Defendant Kanode had Ms. Lynch arrested for disorderly conduct and resisting \narrest and later formally filed those criminal charges, which were dismissed on June 15, 2020, \nwith bond and fees refunded. \n537.  In order to charge Ms. Lynch with resisting arrest, Defendant Kanode falsely \nswore, under oath, that Ms. Lynch grabbed an officer and took him to the ground.  \n   538.  In addition to her false charges, Officer Kanode further submitted a police report \nwith the ludicrous claim that Ms. Lynch had grabbed an unknown Officer by his riot gear and \nthrew him to the ground.  \n   539.  Video footage of the incident conclusively and accurately shows that Ms. Lynch \nnever  engaged  in  any  such  conduct  and  that  Officer  Kanode’s  account  was  a  complete \nfabrication.  \n540.  In order to charge Ms. Lynch with disorderly conduct, Defendant Kanode falsely \nswore, under oath, that Ms. Lynch had thrown water-filled bottles at police officers.  \n   541.  Video footage of the incident conclusively and accurately shows that Ms. Lynch \nnever engaged throwing bottles; a true and accurate copy of the video is shown below (double \nclick to play or click https://www.dropbox.com/s/nr6t9y2ph8yydv7/IMG_0113.mov?dl=0). \n \n \n92 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 93 of 118  PAGEID #: 175\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n542.  When she charged Ms. Lynch, Defendant Kanode was aware that she had used \nexcessive force in arresting her. \n543.  Defendant Kanode falsified criminal charges to justify and cover up her excessive \nuse of force against Ms. Lynch. \n93 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 94 of 118  PAGEID #: 176\n544.  When she falsified charges against Ms. Lynch, Defendant Kanode was aware that \nbeing  convicted  of  a  charge  involving  an  assault  on  an  officer  could  lead  to  significant \nimprisonment, a large fine, and a debilitating criminal record. \nW.  Mistreatment of Mia Mogavero   \n545.  On the morning of May 30, 2020, Ms. Mogavero and several friends arrived at the \nprotest against police brutality and racial injustice taking place outside the Ohio Statehouse.  \n546.  Ms. Mogavero and her friends started marching peacefully around Broad and \nHigh Streets. \n547.  Columbus  Police  Officers  started  shoving  anyone  who  was  close  to  the \nintersection.  \n548.  Columbus Police Officers who were on horseback began riding their horses onto \nthe sidewalk, pushing protestors back, and injuring some. \n549.  Ms. Mogavero observed all of this occurring and witnessed her friend, Ellen \n“Hana” Abdur-Rahim, get pepper-sprayed at close range.  \n550.  Ms. Mogavero and her friends ran for cover and turned down Pearl Alley, where \nthey noticed medics who were there to assist protestors.  \n551.  As Ms. Mogavero helped Ms. Abdur-Rahim and several other protestors receive \nmedical attention, they noticed approximately ten Columbus Police Officers create a “wall” and \nbegin marching down the alley.  \n552.  Protestors who were being treated and the medics began to leave from the alley. \n553.  Ms. Mogavero saw a Columbus Police Officer attempt to grab a young Black \nchild who was attempting to move his bicycle which appeared to be stuck.  \n94 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 95 of 118  PAGEID #: 177\n554.  Ms. Mogavero responded by attempting to help him move the bicycle, and the \nColumbus Police Officer threw her to the ground.  \n555.  Upon hitting the ground, Ms. Mogavero’s head bounced off the pavement. \n556.  Ms. Mogavero was then pepper-sprayed by the Columbus Police Officer while \nshe lay there still on the ground, defenseless, unarmed, and suffering from what was later \ndiagnosed as a concussion. \n557.  Ms. Mogavero’s friend attempted to help her off of the ground, and a Columbus \nPolice Officer pepper-sprayed the friend at close range. \n558.  As a proximate result of the excessive force, Ms. Mogavero suffered a concussion \nand chemical burns on her left arm, on the left side of her face, and on her neck.  \nX.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Aleta Mixon  \n559.  On the evening of Friday, May 29, 2020, Ms. Mixon was aware that her oldest \ndaughter, who is 20 years old, was attending a protest against police brutality in downtown \nColumbus. \n560.  After dropping a younger daughter at a different event, Ms. Mixon learned that \nthe protests her oldest daughter was attending might become dangerous.   \n561.  Ms. Mixon unsuccessfully attempted to contact her daughter by telephone and \ndrove toward downtown Columbus. \n562.  Ms. Mixon had trouble driving to the vicinity where she believed her daughter \nwas and ultimately, around 9:00 p.m., parked her car on State Street, near the Ohio Statehouse. \n563.  Ms. Mixon left her vehicle to attempt to find her daughter and saw that Columbus \nDivision of Police officers in riot gear were massing in the street. \n95 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 96 of 118  PAGEID #: 178\n564.  Ms. Mixon approached a White female officer who was not in riot gear and was \nstanding separate from the officers who were massing and began to ask the female officer for \nassistance in locating her daughter.   \n565.  As the female officer was about to reply to her request, a White male Columbus \nPolice officer charged toward her and sprayed her in the face with pepper spray.   \n566.  The female officer confronted the male officer and said words to the effect of, \n“Why the fuck did you do that? She was just asking for help.”   \n567.  Ms. Mixon began screaming from the pain of the pepper spray and calling for \nrelief. \n568.  Two White male officers then approached and sprayed Ms. Mixon again.  \n569.   Ms. Mixon fell to a seated position on the ground from the effects of the pepper \nspray, and she was sitting out of the street, on the sidewalk, still calling for help.  \n570.  One of the White male officers continued spraying her, and she attempted to \nstand. \n571.  As Ms. Mixon attempted to stand up, the officer shoved her off the sidewalk and \nover the curb.   \n572.  Ms. Mixon felt intense pain and a snap in her leg.   \n573.  The officer who had shoved Ms. Mixon then stood over her and told her, “That’s \nwhat you get for your protest, bitch,” and he stepped hard on her knee, before walking away. \n574.  Another White male officer who had not been involved in the use of excessive \nforce arrived and assisted Ms. Mixon, calling an ambulance and giving her advice for dealing \nwith the effects of the spray. \n96 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 97 of 118  PAGEID #: 179\n575.  Ms. Mixon was transported to Grant Hospital, where she was given X-rays and \ntold she needed emergency surgery due to critical tears in a major tendon in her leg.   \n576.  The X-rays also showed that Ms. Mixon’s kneecap had been shattered, with \nmultiple fractures in the bone. \n577.  Ms. Mixon’s surgery was delayed until May 31, 2020, due to the urgent medical \nneeds of others injured in the protests.  \n578.  Ms. Mixon was hospitalized until Tuesday, June 2, 2020, after which she was \nreleased, with significant restrictions on her mobility.  \n579.  Ms. Mixon is uncertain whether she will recover full use of her leg, and she \nexpects to be unable to work for a period of several months or longer; a true and accurate picture \nof her leg post-surgery, including permanent scarring, is shown below. \n97 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 98 of 118  PAGEID #: 180\n \n \n98 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 99 of 118  PAGEID #: 181\nY.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Darrell Mullen \n580.  On Tuesday, June 2, 2020, at around 1:30 a.m., Darrell Mullen was walking by \nhimself northbound on the sidewalk on the east side of North High Street.   \n581.  Mr. Mullen was walking home from a friend’s house on Oakland Avenue to his \nresidence on Findley Avenue.   \n582.  On May 30, 2020, Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther had issued an executive \norder instituting a city-wide curfew which required most residents to remain indoors from 10 \np.m. to 6 a.m. and was to remain in effect until he rescinded it.  \n583.   The executive order stated that being outside in violation of the curfew was an \nunspecified degree misdemeanor. \n584.  As  of  the  time  that  Mr.  Mullen  was  walking  home,  North  High  Street  was \ndeserted.   \n585.  Near the intersection of High Street and Oakland Avenue, Mr. Mullen observed \nfour or five police cars drive past him going northbound on High Street.  \n   586.  Upon observing the police cars, Mr. Mullen made no effort to flee and continued \nwalking northbound on High Street. \n587.  Mr. Mullen then observed at least one of the police cars execute a U-turn and \ndrive towards him. \n588.  Again, Mr. Mullen made no attempt to flee and watched the police vehicle drive \nup to him. \n589.  At this point, a Columbus Police Officer, later identified as Thomas Hammel, got \nout of the police cruiser and began running at Mr. Mullen. \n99 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 100 of 118  PAGEID #: 182\n590.  At no time did any Columbus Police Officer order Mr. Mullen to stop, give Mr. \nMullen any verbal commands, or inform Mr. Mullen that he was under arrest.   \n591.  Instead, Officer Hammel violently tackled Mr. Mullen, taking him face down on \nthe sidewalk, and then applied pressure to the back of his head, grinding his face into the \npavement. \n592.  Shortly after that tackling, two more officers got on top of Mr. Mullen and began \nstriking his back and legs with their knees. \n593.  Mr. Mullen was quickly handcuffed, but officers continued to apply pressure to \nhis back and legs, with Officer Hammel continuing to apply pressure to the back and side of his \nneck, pushing his face into the ground and preventing him from talking. \n594.  When he was finally able to talk, Mr. Mullen told the officers that he had just \nbeen walking home, and Officer Hammel replied, “I know exactly where you live, is your \ngirlfriend out of jail yet?”   \n595.  As a proximate result of the excessive use of force, Mr. Mullen suffered facial \nabrasions, bruising, and a significant injury to his leg that left him unable to walk. \n596.  A true and accurate picture of his facial injuries is below: \n100 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 101 of 118  PAGEID #: 183\n \n597.  Mr. Mullen was then charged with violating curfew and taken to jail.   \n598.  Because of his leg injury, when Mr. Mullen arrived at the jail, he was checked out \nby a nurse, who placed him in a wheelchair and recommended x-rays. \n101 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 102 of 118  PAGEID #: 184\n599.  When Mr. Mullen was released later that day at approximately 1:00 p.m., he was \nreleased on crutches.   \n600.  Mr. Mullen was not charged with resisting arrest. \n601.  All charges against Mr. Mullen were subsequently dismissed.   \n602.  Mr. Mullen has been unable to use his injured leg and as a result has been unable \nto work or care for himself.   \n603.  On Friday, June 5, 2020, a lawsuit was filed against Defendant City alleging that \nthe indefinite, city-wide curfew was unconstitutional.   \n604.  Hours after the lawsuit was filed, Mayor Ginther rescinded the curfew.  \n605.  On Tuesday, June 9, Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein dismissed all criminal \ncharges for curfew violations brought under Mayor Ginther’s executive order, which included \nthe criminal charge brought against Mr. Mullen.  \nZ.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Leeanne Pagliaro \n606.  On the morning of Saturday, May 30, 2020, Ms. Pagliaro headed to downtown \nColumbus from her home in the Olde Town East area of Columbus with her wife, Plaintiff \nSummer Schultz, and an African-American female friend to participate in peaceful protests \nagainst the killing of George Floyd and general police misconduct disproportionately inflicted \nupon people of color. \n607.  Ms. Pagliaro, her wife, and her friend intentionally decided to go to the protests in \nthe morning with the hope of avoiding any potential conflicts or problems from the police that \nthey heard happened to peaceful protesters who demonstrated later during the evenings and/or \nafter dark. \n102 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 103 of 118  PAGEID #: 185\n608.  They arrived downtown at approximately 11:00 a.m., parked on Long Street and \nheaded toward Broad and High Streets. \n609.  They stopped in the front of the Statehouse on the east side of Broad Street to \nlisten to speakers. \n610.  There was a crowd of people on the Statehouse lawn listening to speakers on a \nstage and people casually walking around and assembling in the general area of Broad and High \nStreets. \n611.  Ms. Pagliaro remained on the east side of High Street while Plaintiff Schultz and \nher friend crossed to the west side of High Street to take pictures of the Statehouse and of the \ncrowd listening to speakers on the lawn. \n612.  Plaintiff Schultz and her friend then returned to join Ms. Pagliaro. \n613.  While they were initially standing on a sidewalk crowded with protestors, they \nwere forced onto the side when the protestors started marching. \n614.  Ms. Pagliaro noticed more Columbus Police Officers were arriving, including \nunits that looked like SWAT teams, and the Officers started forming a line across High Street. \n615.  Ms. Pagliaro heard some type of commotion nearby, some protestors began to \nscream loudly, and she became separated from her wife and friend. \n616.  Columbus Police Officers were standing with their bicycles in front of the crowd \nand close to Ms. Pagliaro, but she purposely did not talk or speak to the police at all. \n617.  Ms. Pagliaro was kneeling in front of other protesters but was being pushed so she \nhad to stand up to avoid being trampled. \n618.  She was pushed up to the line of Columbus Police Officers on bicycles, but she \ndid not make physical contact with them or speak to them. \n103 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 104 of 118  PAGEID #: 186\n619.  Ms.  Pagliaro  watched  Columbus  Police  Officers  pull,  without  provocation,  a \nwoman over the bikes and then repeatedly punched her head into the ground. \n620.  Without any warning, Columbus Police Officers turned and sprayed Ms. Pagliaro \ndirectly in the face from less than three feet away with what she believes was pepper spray, and \nshe felt her eyes burn, started coughing, and found it difficult to breathe. \n621.  She was dragged out of the crowd by strangers who took her to a medical station. \n622.  While  Ms.  Pagliaro  was  receiving  medical  attention,  she  was  again,  without \nwarning, sprayed directly in the face by a different Columbus Police Officer using a substance \nthat she came to believe was pepper spray. \n623.  By then, Ms. Pagliaro’s eyes were burning badly and watering, she could not \nbreathe, she continued to cough, and her throat was hurting. \n624.  Ms. Pagliaro did not know where her wife and friend were. \n625.  Ms. Pagliaro and others moved away from the medic station, her wife called her, \nand they reunited at the medic station. \n626.  When Ms. Pagliaro could finally open her eyes, the group moved away from the \nmedic station to let others be treated and they were sprayed again. \n627.  Ms. Pagliaro, Ms. Schultz, and others helped pull protesters out of the crowd who \nhad been sprayed and helped them get to medic stations. \n628.  Someone in the group looked to see what time it was and remarked, “Wow, it’s \nnot even noon yet,” or words to that effect. \n629.  Ms. Pagliaro left the downtown area and returned home with the people she \narrived with. \n104 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 105 of 118  PAGEID #: 187\n630.  Ms.  Pagliaro  felt  the  spray  in  her  eyes  and  throat  long  after  she  had  left \ndowntown. \n631.  The spray remained on her clothes and book bag even after cleaning. \n632.  Ms. Pagliaro was shocked, disappointed, and in a state of disbelief because of the \nmistreatment she had received from Columbus Police Officers when she had purposely not \nuttered a word to them or done anything to provoke being pepper-sprayed the first time, let alone \nthe second and third times. \nAA.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Torrie Ruffin \n \n633.  Ms. Ruffin attended the protests in downtown Columbus near the Statehouse each \nday from May 30, 2020, until approximately June 5, 2020. \n634.  Around 11:00 a.m. on May 30, 2020, at the intersection of Broad and High \nStreets, Ms. Ruffin had linked arms with other protestors and stood in front of Columbus Police \nOfficers. \n635.  Ms. Ruffin observed several Columbus Police Officer snipers standing on top of \nbuildings surrounding the protests. \n636.  Ms. Ruffin was in the second row of the linked protestors; in front of her, she \nobserved Columbus Police Officers using their bikes to force protestors to move. \n637.  Without  prior warning  or a dispersal  order,  Columbus Police Officers began \npepper-spraying the group of linked protestors. \n638.  A Columbus Police Officer who sprayed Ms. Ruffin was standing a few feet away \nfrom her face, and Ms. Ruffin had to remove herself from the group to flush out her eyes while \nsitting on the sidewalk. \n105 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 106 of 118  PAGEID #: 188\n639.  Ms. Ruffin then joined a large group of protestors sitting on the curb of the \nsidewalk next to parked Columbus Police Officer cruisers, where protestors were sitting and \nchanting, “This is a peaceful protest,” in front of the Officers. \n640.  Columbus Police Officers then approached the group and pepper-sprayed them \nwithout prior warning or an order to disperse. \n641.  Columbus Police Officers pepper-sprayed downwards, towards the faces of the \nprotestors, including Ms. Ruffin. \n642.  Ms. Ruffin started coughing and crying as the pepper-spray rained down upon her \neyes and face. \n643.  Ms. Ruffin experienced a burning sensation and had to flush her eyes out again. \n644.  Ms. Ruffin then crossed the street and continued protesting on the sidewalk. \n645.  Columbus Police Officers then approached her group on the sidewalk with their \nhorses, using the horses to push the protestors who were standing on the sidewalk up against the \nnearby buildings. \n646.  At that point, there were virtually no protestors in the streets, and Ms. Ruffin and \nother protestors were on the sidewalk.  \n647.  Columbus Police Officers began deploying tear-gas and smoke bombs against the \nprotestors. \n648.  The  onslaught  of  tear-gas  and  smoke  bombs  continued  for  more  than  five \nminutes. \n649.  Columbus  Police  Officers  then  drove  through  the  streets  and  ordered  the \nprotestors to disperse, threatening arrest for failure to disperse. \n106 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 107 of 118  PAGEID #: 189\n650.  Columbus Police Officers continued to use tear-gas and smoke bombs to get \nprotestors to leave the downtown area, and the video below fairly and accurately depicts what \nMs.  Ruffin  observed  (double  click  to  play  or  click  the  link). \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/e0arxn2syb3j5cm/IMG_2051%20%281%29.MOV?dl=0.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n651.  Ms. Ruffin’s exposure to the pepper-spray, tear gas, and smoke bombs caused her \nto choke, cry, cough, and experience breathing issues. \nBB.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Summer Schultz  \n107 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 108 of 118  PAGEID #: 190\n652.  On Saturday, May 30, 2020, at about 11:00 a.m., Ms. Schultz headed toward \ndowntown Columbus from her home in the Olde Town East area of Columbus with her wife, \nPlaintiff Leeanne Pagliaro, and an African-American female friend to participate in peaceful \ndemonstrations against the killing of George Floyd and police misconduct in general that is \ndisproportionately inflicted upon people of color. \n653.  They intentionally decided to go to the protests in the morning with the hope of \navoiding any potential conflicts or problems from the police that they heard happened to peaceful \nprotesters who demonstrated later during the evenings and/or after dark. \n654.  They arrived downtown around 11:15 a.m. and parked on East Long Street. \n655.  They walked to where peaceful demonstrators had gathered, near Broad and High \nStreets.  \n656.  They walked down the east side of High Street and stopped in front of the Ohio \nStatehouse. \n657.  Protestors  were  gathered  on  the  Statehouse  lawn  listening  to  speakers,  some \nsitting and some standing, and all were peaceful. \n658.  Ms. Schultz and her friend wanted to take pictures of the Statehouse and the \nprotestors, so they decided to cross to the west side of High Street to get a better picture. \n659.  As they were taking pictures, Ms. Schultz noticed more Columbus Police Officers \nwere arriving. \n660.  Within about five minutes, the number of Columbus Police Officers had increased \nconsiderably, and Ms. Schultz noticed there were police snipers on the scene. \n661.  Columbus  Police  Officers  with  bicycles  started  to  form  a  line  blocking  the \nintersection of High and Broad Streets. \n108 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 109 of 118  PAGEID #: 191\n662.  Ms.  Schultz  and  her  friend  returned  to  the  other  side  of  High  Street  where \nPlaintiff Pagliaro was located. \n663.  Ms.  Schultz could  hear that something was happening  near  Broad and High \nStreets. \n664.  All of a sudden, her throat felt  closed up, her eyes started burning, and she \nrealized something was being sprayed at her. \n665.  It was difficult to see and to hear, and in the confusion she was separated from \nMs. Pagliaro. \n666.  Columbus Police Officers on bicycles lined up next to the sidewalk where she \nwas standing, and they eventually brought their bikes onto the sidewalk. \n667.  Columbus Police Officers told protestors to get on the sidewalk, but there was not \nenough room for everyone to fit.  \n668.  As protestors were trying to get on the sidewalk, something was again sprayed, \nand Ms. Schultz was sprayed in the face. \n669.  Ms. Schultz’s eyes were burning, and someone rinsed them with saline and a milk \nof magnesia solution.  \n670.  Protestors tried to get on the sidewalk as instructed by the Columbus Police \nOfficers, but they spilled into the street near the corner of Broad and High Streets. \n671.  Ms. Schultz saw Columbus Police Officers grab a young African-American male \n– he appeared to be a boy or a teenager – by his shirt and attempt to pull him over a bike. \n672.  White protestors attempted to shield the child from the Columbus Police Officers \nto protect him, because the police were not acting as aggressively toward White people. \n109 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 110 of 118  PAGEID #: 192\n673.  Ms.  Schultz  was  approximately  ten  feet  from  the  line  of  Columbus  Police \nOfficers, and it was still difficult to see and breathe. \n674.  Ms.  Schultz  and  others  turned  to  leave  and  move  away  from  the  street  and \nColumbus Police Officers, and she heard protestors repeating, “Walk, do not run; walk, do not \nrun.” \n675.  Ms. Schultz walked away from Columbus Police Officers with her back turned to \nthem and the street. \n676.  Ms. Schultz was suddenly hit with something so forceful that it knocked her off \nher feet to the ground, and, when she tried to get up, she could not. \n677.  Ms. Schultz tried to stand on her feet again, stumbled, and could not get up; she \nwas disoriented, in pain, and could barely see. \n678.  Ms. Shultz felt someone pull her up and help her walk and soon realized that she \nknew the person. \n679.  The person helped Ms. Schultz walk down Broad Street past a tall building with \nscaffolding (the Rhodes Office Tower), toward Third Street, and down an alley. \n680.  Ms. Schultz used her cell phone to call her wife, Plaintiff  Pagliaro, and she \nanswered. \n681.  Ms. Schultz was reunited with her wife and friend, and they left downtown. \n682.  Ms. Schultz believes all of the events from the time they arrived downtown until \nthe time they left took place within about 30 to 45 minutes. \n683.  Ms. Schultz later realized that she had been shot in the buttocks with wooden \nbullets. \n684.  Ms. Schultz was in significant pain from being shot.  \n110 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 111 of 118  PAGEID #: 193\n685.  Ms. Schultz could not sit down comfortably for days, was forced to lie on her \nside, applied ice to reduce the swelling, used over-the-counter pain medication, and took Epsom \nsalt baths to alleviate the pain and swelling. \n686.  The wooden bullets left a large round indentation on her buttocks that turned blue \nwith obvious bruising and swelling, and Plaintiff Pagliaro took pictures on the day of the incident \nand periodically thereafter; a true and accurate copy of one of those pictures is below. \n \n111 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 112 of 118  PAGEID #: 194\n687.  Ms. Schultz was in pain for more than a week, and bruises, which were the size of \na disk or hockey puck, were visible for weeks. \n688.  Ms.  Schultz  remains  disturbed  about  being  shot  with  wooden  bullets  while \npeacefully walking away from the police; suffering the smell of tear gas and inhaling pepper \nspray while she was peaceably protesting; hearing the sound of protestors screaming; and the \nunprovoked  abuse  by  Columbus  Police  Officers  that  she  witnessed  against  other  peaceful \nprotesters on the May 30, 2020. \n  CC.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Amanda Weldon \n \n689.  On  the  morning  of  May  30,  2020,  Ms.  Weldon  and  her  roommate  headed \ndowntown for an organized protest against police brutality and racism.  \n690.  While attending the event and peacefully protesting, Ms. Weldon was asked to \nstand in the front line of a group of protestors to protect the minorities standing behind her as \npolice armed in riot gear began to line the streets.  \n691.  Many protestors believed that Columbus Police Officers would be less likely to \nuse  excessive  force  against  White  protestors  than  Black  protestors  and  called  for  White \nprotestors to stand between Columbus Police Officers and Black protestors. \n692.  Ms. Weldon neither acted violently nor showed any aggression.  \n693.  While peacefully protesting in front of other protestors, Ms. Weldon was maced \ntwice and pepper-sprayed once by Columbus Police Officers. \n694.  On June 1, 2020, Ms. Weldon was attending a protest near the intersection of \nNorth High Street and Lane Avenue. She was approached by a Columbus Police Officer who \nhopped out his cruiser and pointed, without shooting, what she assumed was a real gun at her. \n695.  Ms. Weldon was terrified by that incident. \n112 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 113 of 118  PAGEID #: 195\n696.  Ms.  Weldon  witnessed  Columbus  Police  Officers  inflicting  pain  on  peaceful \nprotestors and was horrified by what she saw. \n697.  Ms. Weldon also observed a female protestor, who was handcuffed and lying on \nthe ground, be pepper-sprayed by a Columbus Police Officer. \n698.  The way in which Ms. Weldon was mistreated and the incidents of excessive use \nof force she observed generated so much anxiety and fear of being harmed that she became \nphysically ill, including vomiting after the incident on June 1, and discontinued going to protests.  \nDD.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Heather Wise  \n699.  On June 21, 2020, Ms. Wise went to downtown Columbus to participate in the \nprotests.   \n700.  During previous incidents, Ms. Wise had been subjected to violence at the hands \nof Columbus Police Officers, however on her June 21, 2020 visit downtown she was subjected to \nespecially gratuitous violence.   \n701.  At  the  corner  of  Broad  and  High,  Ms.  Wise  was  standing  with  a  group  of \nprotestors who were trying to protect themselves from any potential police violence. \n702.  Columbus Police Officers on bicycles approached the protestors and began to use \ntheir bodies as well as their bicycles as weapons against the protestors, physically assaulting the \npeaceful protestors.  \n703.  Ms. Wise was standing there at the intersection of Broad and High as Columbus \nPolice Officers began pepper spraying the peaceful protestors.  \n704.  As some people dispersed, Ms. Wise was standing next to a Black woman who \nwas being pepper-sprayed and attempted to shield her. \n113 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 2 Filed: 09/16/20 Page: 114 of 118  PAGEID #: 196\n705.  While attempting to protect her fellow peaceful protestor, Ms. Wise was assaulted \nby a Columbus Police Officer who used the space in between his thumb and index finger to press \nhis hand into her throat and push her back. \n706.  Near the same time, Ms. Wise was being assaulted by a Columbus Police Officer \nwho was pushing his bicycle into her and others.  \n707.  Ms. Wise and others fell to the ground and Columbus Police Officers continued \npepper spraying them as they lay there attempting to cover themselves.  \n708.  Columbus Police Officers then pulled out a vial of a brown liquid that they began \npouring into the eyes and faces of Ms. Wise and others.  \n709.  Ms.  Wise  suffered  bruising  across  her  arms  and  legs  in  addition  to  injuries \nsuffered from the pepper spray and the unknown substance.  \nV.  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \n  A.

INTRODUCTION \nBut somewhere I read of the freedom of assembly. Somewhere I read of the freedom of \nspeech. Somewhere I read of the freedom of press. Somewhere I read that the greatness \nof America is the right to protest for rights.1 \n \n  The document to which Nobel Laureate, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., referred is the First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. Unfortunately, some of the members of the \nColumbus Police Department had no regard for the rights secured by this bedrock principle of \nAmerican democracy. This case is the sad tale of police officers, clothed with the awesome power \nof the state, run amok. \nBecause cell phones captured last year’s police killing of George Floyd, the world stopped. \nLast year’s protests in the aftermath of Mr. Floyd’s death reignited the flashpoint around which \nthis case revolves—the accessibility and protection of constitutional rights. Dr. King’s words serve \nas a reminder that progress is not linear and that history is both a collective diary and a mirror.

The History of Policing \nAn 1871 New York Times article on the history of policing wrote: “The personnel of the \nforce is an excellent one, though there are of course some decided exceptions, as in all large bodies \nof men.”3 The history of policing in the United States presents, as history is wont to do, \nuncomfortable truths upon which this Court pauses to reflect. \n  As  the  nascent  colonies  matured,  a  concerted  effort  to  surveil  society’s  goings-on \ndeveloped. Night watches, constables, and sheriffs were a mix of ad hoc vigilante groups and those \nwith more institutional legitimacy.4 It was 1631 Boston that created the idea of the so-called Boston \nWatch (also known as “The Court”; “Town Watch”; and “citizen Watchmen”). These citizen \nWatchmen were organized as a “military guard” to surveil and punish infractions. Everything from \nwearing “extravagant boots,” to northeastern Indian tribes engaging in sacred cultural traditions, \nto infamous accusations of witchcraft, became punishable at the hands of the Town Watch.5 New \nYork followed suit in 1845, establishing a police force of 800 men.6 The recruits were told that \n \n3 The New-York Police, N.Y.

Kelly, Police Dep’t City of New York, The History of the New York City Police Department 5, \nhttps://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/145539NCJRS.pdf. The first reported police shooting took place in 1858 \nin New York City, when an unarmed Irish immigrant named John Hollis was shot with an officer’s personal firearm \nwhile attempting to flee. \n  4\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 5 of 88  PAGEID #: 5675\n“the prevention of crime [was] the most important object.”7 And “[b]y the late 1880s, all major \nU.S. cities had municipal police forces in place.”8 \n  In the Antebellum South, formal policing took its earliest form in slave patrols. By 1822, \nthe slave patrol system in South Carolina was 100-members strong.9 During the 1830s, New \nOrleans adopted a militaristic police force to control slaves.10 These slave patrols had three primary \nfunctions: (1) to chase down, apprehend, and return to their owners, runaway slaves; (2) to provide \na form of organized terror to deter slave revolts; and (3) to maintain a form of discipline for slave-\nworkers who were subject to summary justice, outside of the law, if they violated plantation rules.11 \nAfter the Civil War, chattel slavery ended formally, but the legal and economic subjugation \nof Black Americans endured, as slave codes gave way to Black Codes.12 The two codes were so \nsimilar it is a wonder that the copy-and-paste functionality was only invented more recently.13 \nConfederate  defeat  also  initiated  the  convict-lease  system—which  reified  the  societal \nsynonymization of blackness with criminality.14 Of course, ratification of the Reconstruction \nAmendments, i.e., the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, did not create de jure \n \n7 Id. \n8 Samuel Walker, Popular Justice, A History of American Criminal Justice 49–80  (2d  ed.  1998).

Rather, Jim Crow laws took the place of the Black Codes—lasting until recently: \n1968.15 \nIn the American West, law officers such as the Texas Rangers committed violence against \nindigenous  persons,  Mexicans,  and  Mexican-Americans  in  Texas.16  In  California,  so-called \n“vigilance committees” terrorized Chinese immigrants; some such committees acted with legal \nauthority, arresting, trying, and eventually executing people.17  \nIn the North, the development of policing as we know it today was intimately bound up \nwith the policing of “undesirable” immigrant groups and free or freed Blacks in the swelling \ncities.18 In cities like Boston, Chicago, and New York, nineteenth-century police participated in \nstrike-breaking and perpetrated election fraud in the service of political machines of the day.19 \nAs history books turned from black-and-white to full color, the role of law enforcement in \nsociety remained fraught. The organizational structure of police departments grew increasingly \ndependent on technology such as the two-way radio and surveillance devices. Televisions aired \npolice barring Black students from integrating Little Rock Central High School; they showed that \npeaceful protests for civil rights were met with police violence and arrests, fire hoses, and dog \n \n15 See Jim Crow Laws, History (updated Mar. 26, 2021), https://www.history.com/topics/early-20th-century-us/jim-\ncrow-laws. \n16 Jill  Lepore,  The  Invention  of  the  Police,  New  Yorker  (July  13,  2020),  https://www.newyorker.com/ \nmagazine/2020/07/20/the-invention-of-the-police (noting that immigration from Ireland and German contributed to \nthe emergence of urban policing in major American cities). \n17 Id. \n18 See Potter, The History of Policing (observing that one of primary focuses of police in the 1830s and 1840s was the \nsurveillance of immigrants); Robinson, Black Bodies on the Ground at 555 (opining that “police departments had a \nfunction of controlling immigrants with brute force and brutality”); Lawrence M.

It also thrust officer conduct into scrutiny’s spotlight. The 1985 Philadelphia Police \nDepartment bombing targeted a rowhome inhabited by a Black separatist group, killing eleven \npeople and destroying sixty-one homes (a formal municipal apology came just in 2020).22 The \nbrutal police beating of Rodney King in 1991—and the acquittal of police officers on all charges \nof excessive force—precipitated riots across the United States. The 1993 law-enforcement siege \nin Waco, Texas, was broadcast live for weeks on end. \nThat brings us to today. Police occupy an interesting role in our societal consciousness. \nChildren play cops-and-robbers and dream of becoming a police officer when grown. And law \nenforcement is an ever-present topic in songs,23 musical theater,24 television,25 and movies.26  \n \n20 Id.; see also Jeremy Gray, Bull Connor Used Fire Hoses, Police Dogs on Protestors, Birmingham News (May 3, \n1963), https://www.al.com/birmingham-news-stories/2013/05/bull_connor_used_fire_hoses_po.html. \n21 Potter, The History of Policing. \n22 Lindsey Norward, The Day Philadelphia Bombed Its Own People, Vox (Aug. 15, 2019), https://www.vox.com/the-\nhighlight/2019/8/8/20747198/philadelphia-bombing-1985-move; John Ismay, 35 Years After MOVE Bombing that \nKilled  11,  Philadelphia  Apologizes,  N.Y.

The Killing of George Floyd \nAgainst this backdrop, Columbus, Ohio, the United States, and our international neighbors \nare fighting dual battles: a horrifying and deadly pandemic and grappling with historical vestiges \nand present displays of racial hatred. Neither has a panacea. Both have wrought and revealed \nsubstantial division in our communities. 2020 was a precedent-setting year. Many of us wish we \ncould erase the year from our minds and calendars. But last year remains indelible, particularly as \nit proved a tragic flashpoint between the COVID-19 pandemic and deep-seated racism. Analogous \nto  how  the  television  brought  the  Civil  Rights  Movement  into  living  rooms,  cell  phones \nimmortalizing the killings of unarmed black citizens bring these intimate final moments to our \npalms.  \nOn May 25, 2020, George Floyd, a Black American, presented a counterfeit $20 bill at a \nconvenience store. Police arrived. Moments later, Mr. Floyd showed no signs of life. After Officer \nDerek Chauvin kneeled on Mr. Floyd’s neck for approximately nine minutes and 29 seconds, Mr. \nFloyd died.28 “I can’t breathe”—a cry for help gasped by an incalculable number of Americans \ndying at the hands of government officials, including Mr. Floyd—became an international rallying \ncry.29 \n \n27 Today’s stop-and-frisk programs, employed on massive scales throughout American society, may be but a modern-\nday version of enforcement of the Black Codes.

Most of the demonstrations occurred between May 28 and June 21, 2020, with further \nprotests on either end of that period in response to deaths of other Americans at the hands of law \nenforcement. (ECF No. 1 ¶ 47). \nC.  Policies and Procedures of the Columbus Division of the Police  \nBefore this Court today are protestors desiring to engage in their rights guaranteed by the \nConstitution, without fear of retaliation by police officers’ use of tear gas, pepper spray, flash-bang \ngrenades, rubber bullets, wooden pellets, batons, body slams, pushing or pulling, or kettling.  \nThe heart of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction is that apart from assembling, \nchanting, or holding signs in the middle of streets or other locations that Columbus police officers \nwanted them to abandon, Plaintiffs were not violating any laws, threatening violence, destroying \nany property, or hampering traffic. (ECF No. 6; see also ECF No. 1 ¶ 92). Rather than responding \nappropriately to an isolated incident—such as a protestor throwing a water bottle—Plaintiffs allege \nthat officers engaged in collective punishment by indiscriminately pepper-spraying, tear-gassing, \nor shooting wooden bullets at a group of obviously different protestors who had not engaged in \nany such conduct; and, what is more, sometimes failed to give audible warnings or adequate time \nto disperse before resorting to less-lethal force. (ECF No. 1 ¶ 93). \nThe term “less-lethal force” is a term of art that refers to munitions, projectiles, and the use \nof physical force that officers might use to restrain or compel movement (but not intended to cause \n \nheard telling the deputies he had congestive heart failure”); Stacia Glenn, Tacoma’s ‘Can’t Breathe’ Case: Manuel \nEllis’ Family Demands Answers After He Was Killed While Being Restrained by Police, Seattle Times, June 4, 2020; \nMeagan Flynn, Another Black Man Who Died in Custody Told Officer, ‘I Can’t Breathe.’ One Responded, ‘I don’t \nCare.’ Wash. Post, June 11, 2020 (“Officers also suggested aloud on multiple occasions that Scott was only pretending \nto be unconscious, only “acting” like he was”); Anita Hassan, When Byron Williams Died Saying, ‘I Can’t Breathe,’ \nFew Protested. Now His Family Is Fighting for Justice, NBC News, June 18, 2020 (telling officers “I can’t breathe” \nat least 17 days before dying); Lee Sanderlin & Michael Hewlett, ‘Help Me,’ John Neville Pleaded, Winston-Salem \nJ., July 9, 2020 (“The officers didn’t let him go, one of them telling him at least twice “Come on, buddy, if you can \ntalk, you can breathe,” according to three independent sources familiar with the investigation.”). \n  9\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 10 of 88  PAGEID #: 5680\ndeath). Less-lethal force is intended to create temporary and minimal pain in order “to gain \ncompliance, restore order, [or] temporarily incapacitate dangerous persons.” (ECF No. 26-2 at 83). \nIndeed, the Columbus Division of Police (“CPD”) has various policies dictating which of these \ncrowd-control tactics officers may use and under what circumstances they may use them.30 This \nCourt heard from multiple departmental personnel, including from Mayor Andrew Ginther, \nDefendant Deputy Chief Quinlan, and several officers on the proper use of force and less-lethal \nweapons.31  \n1.  Use of Force Policy \nCPD policies define “use of force” as: “The exertion of energy or the actions of personnel \nin the performance of their duties used to direct or control another’s movements or actions. A use \nof force may be implemented to control resistive or aggressive behavior toward the involved \npersonnel, other personnel, third parties, or property.” (Pl.’s Ex. 8 ¶ 1(A) (emphasis added)).32  \nTo determine if force is authorized in a crowd-control scenario, a 2017 CPD training \nmanual instructs officers to “identify[] and isolate[e]” unlawful behavior from lawful behavior. \n(Pl.’s Ex. 12 at 10).33 CPD officers are trained to be “mentally prepared to use force.” (Mabry Dep. \n \n30 CPD’s Emergency Operations and the Directives Manuals provide instructions with respect to field force operations, \nincluding riot gear, civil disturbance tactics, and operating guidelines for riot-control munitions. (See generally Pl.’s \nEx. 5). \n31 Witness and Defendant Thomas Quinlan is the Deputy Chief at the Columbus Division, Support Services Division, \nand has been with the division for thirty-two years. He served previously as Chief of the Columbus Division of Police.  \n32 In addition, there are eight levels of force the Division of Police follows. Level 0 is officer presence, verbal, and \nnon-verbal commands, flashbangs, baton rounds, and the use of the Long Range Acoustic Device (“LRAD”) warning \ntone; Level 1 is empty hand control, grounding techniques, and joint manipulations; Level 2 is chemical spray; Level \n3 is electronic device, such as a taser; Level 4 is “hard empty hand control,” e.g., strike, punch, kick; Level 5 is use of \nan impact weapon, e.g., baton or flashlight; Level 6 is a police K-9 bite; Level 7 is less-lethal weapons, such as \nbeanbags or multiple baton rounds; and Level 8 is deadly force. \n33 CPD trains lieutenants to use five tactics in crowd-control scenarios: (1) monitor; (2) contain; (3) block; (4) disperse; \nand (5) arrest. (ECF No. 26-2 at 24). To “monitor” is to “[w]atch the crowd’s progress and development . . . [to] gauge \ntheir intent.” (Id. at 25). To “contain” refers to “[p]erimter control,” and “[c]onsists of restraining a large number of \nindividuals within the area, containing any further aggressive activity. (Id. at 26). To “block” amounts to a “[p]hysical \ndenial of a crowd’s advance upon an area or facility,” and is deployed via riot formations or barricades. (Id. at 27). To \n“disperse” is to “fragment a crowd,” but officers are warned “that this technique may spread lawlessness rather than \n \n  10\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 11 of 88  PAGEID #: 5681\nat 147). Even seemingly innocent behavior by a demonstrator—e.g., bringing gas masks, oven \nmitts, backpacks, bandanas, or half masks—might conceal unlawful intent. (Pl.’s Ex. 14; ECF No. \n26-3 at 32). Likewise, a 2020 training to new CPD supervisors instructed that not all protestors \nstanding with their hands raised are peaceful. And children, the elderly, and individuals with \ndisabilities might be used to control the protestors’ message to maximize shock and awe. (Mabry \nDep. at 164). Signs made with heavy sticks or written or verbal statements (e.g., “Fuck the Police, \nPigs Must Die”) carry the potential for a violent crowd. (ECF No. 26-3 at 32).  \nOther  indicia  officers  are  trained  to  notice  are  whether  the  chants  are  “calm”  and \n“structured” (demonstrating “good behavior”) or  “erratic,” “excessively loud,” or “not organized” \n(demonstrating “bad behavior”). (Id. (instructing that good behavior is where laws are obeyed; bad \nbehavior is where laws are not obeyed)).  \n2.  Chemical Irritants \nColumbus police officers used dispersal irritants, including pepper spray and CS gas (“tear \ngas”), with regularity during the 2020 protests. (Pl.’s Ex. 149 (providing instructions on use); Pl.’s \nEx. 141 (showing scores of individuals coughing, apparently experiencing the effects of a chemical \nspray); Pl.’s Ex. 126 (officers on bikes, spraying congregants); Pl’s Ex. 110-B (protestors yelling \n“hands  up,  don’t  shoot,”  followed  by  officers  spraying  the  crowd);  Pl.’s  Ex.  117  (officers \nspraying); Pl.’s Ex. 105 (same)). \nCPD policy on the use of these sprays is memorialized in Directive 2.04, “Chemical \nIntermediate Weapons Regulations,” and subsequent implementing amendments. (Pl.’s Ex. 9). \nThe policy requires officers to provide notifications before deploying irritants. Typically, an \n \nreduce it[,] so it is important to control the escape routes.” Dispersing also includes proclamations, shows of force, \nuse of riot formations, and chemical or specialty munitions that are done upon the order of a ranking person.

Further, “[t]he notifications should be made in a manner which the \nparticipants in the crowd should reasonably be able to hear and understand.” (Pl.’s Ex. 16 ¶ 5(a)). \nThe use of chemical spray should only “be directed at the persons participating in the violent \nconduct, not at the group in general.” (Id. ¶ 6). \nThese dispersal irritants are sometimes deployed by a hand-thrown canister or by direct \nspraying. Pepper spray is deployed through spray canisters or Mark-9 propellant systems designed \nto disperse larger crowds. Tear gas is often deployed through canisters, rolled, thrown, or placed \nnear the crowd to-be-dispersed. “The use of a chemical irritant deployed by a gas gun or a chemical \nirritant grenade being thrown or rolled requires the approval of a lieutenant or higher authority.” \n(Pl.’s Ex. 16). After deploying a chemical irritant, law enforcement personnel should “make a \nreasonable effort to decontaminate exposed persons once the situation is under control,” such as \nby flushing the individual’s eyes with freshwater or seeking medical attention. (Id. ¶ 7).  \nIn the wake of the Columbus protests, Mayor Ginther instructed then-Chief Quinlan34 to \nchange departmental policy on the use of force, reflected in Amended Directive 2.04. (ECF No. \n46 at 184). “The changes include prohibiting the use of tear gas to disperse a crowd and prohibiting \nthe use of chemical spray to disperse a non-aggressive, non-violent crowd.”35 (ECF No. 10; \nQuinlan Aff. ¶ 14). But the exceptions are significant (and arguably swallow the rule). For instance, \na key exception allows officers to use chemical irritants to clear a congregation from a traffic way, \ni.e., “every street or highway” that congregants “have no legal right of access to or from.” (Quinlan \n \n34 In January 2021, Mayor Ginther demoted then-Chief Quinlan, stating that the latter had lost the faith and trust of \nthe community and proved unable to change the culture of the division of the police. (ECF No. 46 at 150).  \n35 On November 11, 2020, Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein and Defendant Chief Quinlan announced “a recent \npolicy change issued by the Columbus Division of Police related to the process of arresting and incarcerating \nindividuals who commit nonviolent misdemeanors, such as theft or trespassing.” (ECF No. 6 at 18). \n  12\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 13 of 88  PAGEID #: 5683\nAff. ¶ 14 (citing O.R.C. § 4511.01(CC)).36 In addition, the trigger for officers’ use of force is if \nthe crowd is violent, aggressive, or resistive. But these terms are not crisply defined in CPD’s use \nof force policy or elsewhere. As Deputy Chief Kuebler explained in his deposition: \nQ. Is there something in the division’s policies that explains what it means for protestors \nwho are in the street to be aggressive? \n \nA. That remains very unclear to us in the division. \n \n(Kuebler Dep. 148:15-19). \n3.  Impact Munitions  \nWooden baton rounds, also known as knee knockers, are less-lethal projectiles loaded in a \nrotary gun and are designed to avoid a hand-to-hand scenario. (Pl.’s Ex. 122; Pl.’s Ex. 5). These \nlaunchers look like a regular assault rifle to the untrained eye, except they fire wooden projectiles \nin a 4.8-inch casing. (See ECF No. 26-2 at 86; Pl.’s Ex. 6). CPD’s grenadier37 trainer John Gagnon \nis responsible for training the officers on how these munitions are deployed. A 40 mm wood baton \nrotary gun fires three wooden pellets at once, while the 37 mm gun fires five wooden pellets. (Id.). \nSince the 40 mm fires two fewer knee knockers than its counterpart, when using a 40 mm gun, \nOfficer Gagnon states in a training video: “We just have to fire more of them.” (Pl.’s Ex. 149). \nUnder CPD policy, the knee knockers should be skip-fired on the ground in front of \nprotestors, from a distance of 30–50 feet, rather than direct-fired. (Pl.’s Ex. 149 (“[W]ith the old \n37 mm, we direct-fired them often . . . But our policy is that they are not to be direct-fired.”); see \nalso ECF No. 48 at 21–22 (“[A] weapon that is designed to . . . skip-fire them downrange.”)). The \n \n36 An additional change required officers working in civil unrest situations, like protests, to wear traffic vests over \ntheir riot gears, and mark helmets and vests with badge numbers. The body-worn cameras must be mounted on the \ntraffic vest. (Quinlan Aff. ¶ 15). \n37 A grenadier is an officer “specifically designated for the throwing of grenades and operating less lethal grenade \nlaunchers and sometimes assault operations. Grenadiers may also often lead entry into a crowd” by using “less lethal \nmunitions. (ECF No. 26-2 at 81). \n  13\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 14 of 88  PAGEID #: 5684\nskip-fire policy allows for a more effective crowd-control device; as Officer Gagnon noted, direct-\nfiring targets an individual, but skip-firing could “hit him, and him, and him, and maybe bounce \nover and deter more people. So, the effective use of this is on the ground, in front of the crowd.” \n(Pl.’s Ex. 149). Next, officers are also trained on where a knee knocker round should be aimed on \nthe recipient’s body. (Pl.’s Ex. 149 (stating that the spine and kidney areas should not be \nintentionally targeted; conversely, hard-bony areas like the knees, elbows, and shoulders “could \ncause an injury . . . so [it’s] okay to hit th[ose areas], but we’re not targeting them . . . not trying to \ncause a permanent injury.”)). \n4.  Bikes, Horses, and Kettling \nOfficers also effectuate crowd control dispersals with bikes, horses, or physical shows of \nforce. Notably, CPD bike training instructs officers to use bikes as a barrier between the protestors \nand police officers, with the bikes turned sideways. But evidence from the hearing indicated this \nrule was often flouted, sometimes apparently with the go-ahead of a higher-up. (See Pl.’s Ex. 105 \n(showing officers riding bikes forward into protestors repeating, “Get out of the road”); ECF No. \n48 at 64; see also id. at 193 (“As multiple protestors began taking over High Street from the east \nsidewalk, they began to close in on the backside of the bike squad, so the squad had to fall back \nand reposition and make a bike barricade at the south side of the intersection across High Street.”)).  \nD.  The Protests \nHere, the protests began in earnest on May 28, 2020, and lasted throughout the spring and \nsummer, including June 21 (“The Father’s Day Demonstration”). Witnesses who attended the \nprotests characterized the demonstrations as both peaceful and tense. Multiple witnesses testified \nto their physical and emotional injuries suffered at the hands of CPD officers while exercising their \nfundamental rights to assemble and protest. (ECF No. 1 ¶ 17). Others—including officers and a \n  14\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 15 of 88  PAGEID #: 5685\nTV reporter witness—testified differently, contending that the use of force matched the threat the \ndemonstrators posed. The submitted evidence both supports and undermines these testimonies. \n1.  Thursday, May 28, 2020 \nOn May 28, 2020, Plaintiffs and other demonstrators in Columbus gathered downtown and \nthroughout the city to generate widespread public attention to past and continuing police violence \ndirected overwhelmingly at communities and individuals of color. (ECF No. 1 ¶ 3). \nAn incident action plan (“IAP”) “specifies the goals for [CPD] . . . and additional direction \nfor the field force units.” (Pl.’s Ex. 2 (citing Weekley Aff. ¶ 3)). The Columbus Division of Police \ndid not have an IAP for the first day of protests but made one for the following days. (Pl.’s Ex. 1 \n(citing Woods Aff. ¶¶ 4–5)). In addition, the Division received reports that there would be two \nprotests the evening of May 28: one at Livingston and Lockbourne and the other downtown. (Id. \n¶¶ 6–7). \nAt the preliminary injunction hearing, Plaintiff Terry Dean Hubby, Jr. testified that he and \na coworker spontaneously joined the protests on May 28 after getting off of work at a warehouse \nnear Livingston and Lockbourne. (ECF No. 48 at 215). Mr. Hubby made a sign with markers and \nposter boards that other protestors had brought—his sign read, “American Refugee,” a term which \nconnotes a sense of alienation and foreignness some citizens experience while in their own country. \n(Id.  at  217).  Mr.  Hubby  testified  that  no  protestors  were  blocking  traffic,  though  some \ndemonstrated in the street, nor did he observe any conflict between protestors and police. (See also \nWoods Aff. ¶ 7 (“I saw protestors blocking the street. We were able to clear the street with no uses \nof force and no arrests.”)). \nDowntown,  crowds  were  larger,  and  clashes  between  congregants  and  police,  more \nfrequent. (Id. ¶ 9 (“Because of the scope of the unrest, I ordered more officers downtown and had \n  15\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 16 of 88  PAGEID #: 5686\nthem put on riot gear.”)). Officer Anthony Johnson testified that he was dispatched downtown \naround 2:00 p.m. (ECF No. 51 at 68 (discussing the atmosphere near Broad and High Street)). He \nrecalled an unruly and disobedient crowd, holding signs that said things like, “Defund the police,” \nor “‘F’ the police.” (ECF No. 51 at 69 (recalling orders to disperse were unheeded or answered \nwith, “fuck you, and fuck the police”)). Mr. Johnson recalled that protestors surrounded his and \nother officers’ cruisers. (ECF No. 51 at 75). After telling congregants to leave and stop banging \non the cruiser, the officers deployed the Mark 9, or pepper spray. (ECF No. 51 at 76 (“[A] Mark 9 \nis a big canister of pepper spray meant to disperse large crowds”); Pl.’s Ex. 145).38 \nOfficer Johnson joined a police barricade line at the northern part of the Broad and High \nStreet intersection, facing south. It was still daylight. “At this point[,] they got much more violent. \nThey began like throwing objects at us[,] such as rocks, bricks, and water bottles. People were \nwalking up to us with bottles and opening them and throwing, like, unknown liquids on us, yelling \nin our face.” (ECF No. 51 at 79; see also Woods Aff. ¶ 13 (stating protestors ignored a dispersal \norder, though they had a clear exit)). A senior member of the department ordered officers to change \ninto riot gear; the crowd continued to grow; and this standoff continued. (ECF No. 51 at 82; ECF \nNo. 50 at 184 (stating May 28 was the first day that SWAT deployed)). \nBy 6:00 or 7:00 p.m., “[t]hings were definitely tense,” with a heavy police presence, \naccording to witness Kayla Merchant. (ECF No. 49 at 149, 153 (“Mostly it was, you know, just \npeople doing general protesting activities.”)). Maxwell Garrison, a student at Ohio State University \nand assistant campus editor of The Lantern, who documented the protest near the corner of Broad \nand High Street, agreed that much of the evening was nonviolent. (ECF No. 49 at 91–92, 94 \n(testifying that he arrived around 9:40 or 9:45 p.m. and witnessed three or four water bottles thrown \n \n38 Officer Johnson’s body-cam footage, running from about 8:00 p.m.–9:15 p.m. on May 28. \n  16\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 17 of 88  PAGEID #: 5687\nfrom deep in the crowd towards the police officers); see also ECF Nos. 23, 24 (recalling that there \nwere a couple of hundred protestors near Broad and High Street by 9:30 p.m.)). \nBryant Somerville, a Channel 10 WBNS (“10TV”) reporter, arrived at Broad and High \nStreet to report on the protests on May 28, 2021.39 He arrived a little after 8:00 p.m. and left around \n12:30 a.m. Friday morning. He described a tense atmosphere with police clad in riot gear and about \nten feet in front of them, a line of protestors. He testified: “There w[as] chanting[], there w[as] \nyelling, there was a lot of yelling. Raised voices. But as far as the term peaceful protesting goes, it \nwas peaceful . . . Everybody has a voice[,] and they were letting it be heard.” (ECF No. 51 at 9). \nThe tension rose as the night drew on. Mr. Somerville said that protestors “rows and rows \ndeep” threw objects at officers, including  bottles of water, jugs of water and milk, shoes, and \nsmall-grade fireworks, characterizing the throwing as “frequent.” (Id. at 11). Mr. Somerville \ncontinued, recalling that protestors would sometimes get right in the officers’ faces. (See generally \nDefs.’ Ex. 24 (recording bottles and jugs of water thrown at the police, as well as officers spraying \nthe crowd with irritants)). Officers, Mr. Somerville said, showed restraint. (Id. at 12 (“They were \nvery, what I would consider, very calm.”)). \nWitness Rachel Wenning recalls demonstrators throwing water bottles toward the police \nat an estimated rate of one per minute. (ECF No. 47 at 147). But most of the water bottles hit the \nground, another protestor, or flew over the officers’ heads. (Id.). Ms. Wenning did not see any \nwater bottle hit an officer without the officer hitting it down first, nor did she observe any visible \ninjuries caused by the water bottles. (Id. at 148 (explaining the throwing was not “constant”)). Ms. \nMerchant agreed: though she did not see any behavior from the protestors that would have justified \nthe deployment of chemical agents, she did witness a couple of water bottles thrown towards the \n \n39 Mr. Somerville took two videos, one on May 28, 2020 (Defs.’ Ex. 24) and another on May 29. (Defs.’ Ex. 25). \n  17\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 18 of 88  PAGEID #: 5688\nofficers. But, similarly, she did not observe any bottles hit the officers. (Id. at 49; see also Pl.’s Ex. \n122 (showing a water bottle thrown towards the officers, hitting the ground before the police line)). \nThroughout the hour and fifteen minutes that Mr. Garrison, the student journalist, was \npresent, he observed that CPD’s “pepper[-]spraying became a bit more frequent. On the protest \nside of it, not much changed.” (ECF No. 49 at 96; ECF No. 47 at 150 (“[T]here were people who \nstarted to be pepper[-]sprayed by the police.”)). To flee the pepper spray, Ms. Wenning ran from \nBroad and High Street towards the intersection of High Street and State Street, where there were \n40 or 50 protestors in the street and on the sidewalk. Around that same time—between 9:00 or \n10:00 p.m.—Duck Bardus, a volunteer street medic, set up a medic station to treat those injured \nby chemical agents.40 But within twenty minutes, the station itself was sprayed, rendering it useless \nfor treatment purposes.  \nCloser to 11:00 p.m., there were “hundreds” of people downtown still. (ECF No. 51 at 21). \nMr.  Somerville  repeatedly  described  what  he  viewed  as  a  game  of  cat-and-mouse:  “These \nprotestors would go places[,] and police would respond.” (Id.). \nA troubling video shows an electric scooter hurled from deep in the crowd of congregants \ntowards the line of officers around 10:00 p.m. A few police officers blunted the scooter’s impact \nmid-air. (Id. at 95; see also Defs.’ Ex. 26 (showing scooter hurled towards officers at 1:17:10 into \n \n40 Duck Bardus is a volunteer street medic—a term used to refer to people who have completed a 20-hour training that \ncovers first aid, CPR, and some other tailored training around typical injuries seen in protest environments. (ECF No. \n50 (explaining he typically goes to protests to look for ailments like dehydration, hypothermia, or asthma attacks)). \nSince his certification in 2016, Mr. Bardus has provided first-aid for a range of protestors, including those with whom \nhe disagreed politically. (ECF No. 50 at 31 (recalling providing aid at a conservative rally to an individual who was \nface down on the Statehouse lawn)). Mr. Bardus attended multiple days of protest to serve as a street medic; he was \nnot there to protest. (ECF No. 50 at 33 (“My red pack is red and says first aid on it. I try to be as loud and obnoxious \nabout that as I can [to distinguish himself]”)). Typically, the medics operate in a buddy system, where one is treating \ninjured folks, and the other is standing sentinel to assess any incoming dangers.  \n  18\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 19 of 88  PAGEID #: 5689\nvideo, followed by officers spraying the crowd with irritants); Defs.’ Ex. 29 (showing officers’ \nprotest-related injuries, including a May 28 injury from a scooter thrown by a protestor)).41  \nAround that same time at Broad and High Street, a surveillance camera video shows a line \nof officers (some with bikes, some mounted on horses, nearly all in riot gear) facing protestors \nwho are sitting in the street. (Pl.’s Ex. 113; see generally Pl.’s Ex. 144). An officer, presumably \nwith some sort of authority, waves her hand, prompting the others to move the police line forwards, \nnow more than a foot away from the sitting protestors. Officers spray the demonstrators’ faces \nwith a chemical irritant, causing one individual to crawl away in pain. (Pl.’s Ex. 113; see Pl.’s Exs. \n119, 120, 121 (same)). \nBy midnight, a body-worn camera video shows a handful of protestors in the street or on \nthe sidewalk at the intersection of West State and High Street. (Pl.’s Exs. 122, 122-A). CPD \nofficers stand facing the demonstrators. (Id.). Some protestors shout various invectives at the \nofficers; others throw water bottles towards the officers in riot gear, with the visible ones landing \nbefore the line of officers.  Six or seven protestors kneel or stand in the street with their hands in \nthe air—in the familiar, “hands up, don’t shoot” position. Four minutes later, an officer throws, \napparently unprompted, a flashbang device. (Pl.’s Ex. 122). Two men remain in the street after the \nexplosion,  and  officers  throw  another  device.  Fifty  seconds  later,  officers  say,  “knockers, \nknockers, knockers,” and an officer fires wooden projectiles at the individuals remaining in the \nstreet. Additional riot gear is handed out to officers, and an emergency announcement to leave the \narea sounds.  \n \n41 Officer Johnson himself was hit with an electronic scooter. (ECF No. 51 at 82 (“The weight and the force of the \nscooter kind of wrenched my arm back resulting in me tearing my rotator cuff and suffering a back sprain and a neck \nsprain”); see also id. at 84 (“[A] majority of the individuals there were not peaceful, meaning they weren’t listening \nto our commands, they were screaming at us, throwing stuff at us and throwing stuff on us.”) (emphasis added); Pl.’s \nEx. 75 (injury report)).  \n  19\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 20 of 88  PAGEID #: 5690\nAlso, around midnight, Ms. Wenning and other protestors saw the officers line up side-by-\nside with shields, from which she deduced, “they were probably going to come down the street \nand force everyone out of the street.” (ECF No. 47 at 156). Indeed, an officer’s body camera \nfootage captured a dispersal order, roughly transcribed as follows: “This is an emergency. The area \nmust be cleared. If you remain in the area, you will be subject to arrest, and chemical agents may \nbe used against you. You must leave the area now.” (Pl.’s Ex. 122). Mr. Somerville of 10TV said \nthat there were multiple announcements over the loudspeakers telling protestors to leave the area. \n(ECF No. 51 at 13).  \nAfter hearing the dispersal order, Ms. Wenning and others walked westward, into an alley \n“to get away.” (ECF No. 47 at 157 (“I was walking away, so I felt I was leaving the area.”)). Once \nshe and others got into the alley, she “heard a clink and . . . another like really loud explosion from \nanother flashbang that had been thrown into the alley. And that one had tear gas in it because I \ninhaled some of it.” (Id. at 156 (stating that the tear gas was “very thick,” making it difficult to \n“breathe in or out”); see also Pl.’s Exs. 122, 122A (taken at the intersection of State and High \nStreet, appearing to show direct-fired projectiles); Pl.’s Ex 122 (showing an officer throwing a \ndevice into an alleyway near State Street and Front Street)).42  \n2.  Friday, May 29, 2020 \nOn May 29, the Division of Police changed its staffing levels to a phase-two mobilization, \nwith all sworn personnel working 12-hour shifts. (Woods Aff. ¶¶ 21, 26, 30). That day, Deputy \nChief Quinlan also met telephonically with major city chiefs around the country, including the \nMinneapolis police chief. (ECF No. 48 at 122). Mr. Quinlan stated: “[W]e had information from \nthe FBI that people were being paid to create chaos or damage or vandalism or looting . . . . [W]e \n \n42 The video also shows a flash-bang device deployed at 4:07 and again at 4:25 against protestors standing in the street. \n  20\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 21 of 88  PAGEID #: 5691\nhad a meeting with major city chiefs [about] what was occurring all across the country and started \nto get an indication that we needed to be on high alert.” (ECF No. 48 at 122, 127). Officer Ohl, a \nmember of the Columbus Division of Police in the SWAT section, recalled that his team was \ndispatched to the protests on May 29 “[t]o support field-force operations.” (ECF No. 50 at 189). \nThe evening proved to be a terrible one, with Plaintiff Mixon’s and Plaintiff Hubby’s \nexperiences serving as microcosms. Neither Ms. Mixon nor Mr. Hubby was there to create chaos, \ndamage,  vandalism,  or  to  loot.  Yet,  both  suffered  lasting  physical  and  emotional  harm.  In \nsummary, Plaintiff Hubby had his kneecap shattered by a CPD-deployed projectile at State and \nHigh Street about an hour and a half before Plaintiff Mixon was repeatedly pepper-sprayed and \nhad her knee broken by a separate group of Columbus police officers.  \na.  Plaintiff Terry Dean Hubby, Jr. \nAfter spontaneously attending the previous day’s protest, Plaintiff Hubby returned to the \nprotest—this time, downtown—on May 29 around 8:45 or 9:00 p.m. (ECF No. 48 at 219–20). \nThere was not much traffic, and “about a hundred” protestors were “just chanting and holding \nsigns.” (Id. at 221–22). Mr. Hubby did not see any destruction of property, violence, or vandalism. \nA video he recorded shows what happened subsequently. Plaintiff Hubby is walking along the \nsidewalk of State Street and High Street. (Pl.’s Ex. 133). All the sounds characteristic of a modern-\nday protest are present: honking, screaming, yelling, and sirens. Plaintiff Hubby approaches the \ncorner and stands on the sidewalk. Shortly after reaching the corner, he is struck and injured by a \nprojectile. (Id.). \nThe timing is critical. \nThe video reveals that the police begin to shoot less-lethal projectiles while the CPD loud \nsystem sounds a dispersal order. In other words, there was no time for protestors to react. (ECF \n  21\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 22 of 88  PAGEID #: 5692\nNo. 48 at 226–27 (stating that only Plaintiff Hubby heard a dispersal announcement after he was \nhit)). The projectile rendered Plaintiff Hubby unable to stand. (Id. at 225–26 (“It kind of felt like \na hammer or like a steel bat or something was hitting it . . . [My knee] was broken into many little \npieces . . . It kind of looked like a puzzle.”)). A group of twelve Good Samaritans, strangers to \nPlaintiff Hubby, dragged him around the corner, out of the way of the raining munitions. (Id. at \n233 (“Q. How could you tell they were still shooting? A. Because you could hear the shots.”)). \nThe protestors-turned-medics fashioned a splint for Mr. Hubby’s knee before obtaining a rental \nbicycle and transforming it into a gurney so that he could be transported without over-exerting his \nknee. (Id. at 234 (“As they were running, a helicopter was following us.”)). \nEventually, Mr. Hubby was transported to the hospital and had surgery, resulting in twenty \npins and a plate in his knee. Plaintiff Hubby, a 31-year-old man, no longer can walk more than a \nhalf-mile without significant pain—an improvement from his condition for the first four to five \nmonths post-shooting, when he was unable to walk at all. His knee swells regularly. His balance \nsuffers. (Pl.’s Ex. 77 (containing photographs from February 2021 of injury)). As to whether \nPlaintiff Hubby would attend a future protest, he answered: “No sir . . . I just don’t think it’s a \ngood idea now.” (ECF No. 48 at 38). \nb.  Plaintiff Aleta Mixon \n  Plaintiff Mixon, a patient support assistant, traveled to the vicinity of the Statehouse in the \nevening, around 9:00 p.m. (ECF No. 47 at 58). She was not there to protest. Instead, she was \nattempting to locate her daughter, a 21-year-old who joined the demonstrations. Plaintiff Mixon \napproached a female officer in riot gear, asking if the officer would assist her in locating her \ndaughter. Plaintiff Mixon recounted the following: \nQ.  Okay. You mention you saw a female officer. Did you approach her? \n \n  22\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 23 of 88  PAGEID #: 5693\nA.  Yes, sir, I did . . . I noticed that there was a female officer that was in riot gear. She \nhad one of the helmets on[,] but her face shield was raised up. And her fade was blond[,] \nkind of like mine. So[,] I approached her[,] and I asked her if she could assist me with \nhelping me find my daughter. The female asked me did I know where she was located, and \nI told her the last location of me speaking with her was on Broad and High, on the corner \nof Broad and High Street. \n \nQ.  So[,] what happened after . . . . \n \nA.  Before the conversation could continue, I noticed that someone was coming up \nfrom my left side . . . I noticed that it was a male officer that sprayed me with mace as I \nslightly turned my face. And I began to ask why did he do that. I could hear the female \nofficer say . . . why the fuck did you do that? She was just asking for help. She was asking \nme to help her find her baby. She just wanted help finding her daughter. \n \nQ.  Okay. [T]ell us what happened next. \n \nA.  Then the officers started to -- the female officer eventually left with her colleagues. \nI didn’t see her or hear her anymore. And the male officers then began to ask me to leave. \nAnd I just was very concerned with finding my daughter. So, as authorities, I thought they \nwould assist me in helping me find my daughter. So[,] I just was very concerned and asking \nthe male officers if they could help me find my daughter, that I repetitively said that I just \nwanted to find my baby. And I was not there, for the record, to protest at all. I just wanted \nto find my daughter. \n \n(Id. at 67–68). \nThis treatment worsened. She kept seeking help, but the officers “seemed to not care . . . \nThey told me to leave. They just kept telling me to leave. Eventually I was beginning to . . . leave \nas one of the male officers pushed me.” (Id. at 70). She continued to try to depart the area, an effort \nwhich officers continued to thwart. Near West Broad Street and High Street, Plaintiff Mixon \nrecalled: \n[O]fficers were – they were following me and just telling me to leave as I was already \nwalking and leaving. So[,] I turned around just to tell them like I was just wanting help in \nfinding my daughter, I just wanted to find my baby, that’s it; I wasn’t here to protest. And \nas I was walking, one of the officers sprayed me from behind again [hitting the right side \nof her face]. I proceeded to run into now the street on West Broad Street[,] where there \nw[ere] several officers. And I began to run to them screaming for help. And as I was \nrunning screaming for help, I kind of like ran through because I saw -- I ran through the \ncrowd of officers screaming for help. As I was screaming for help, I began to scream[,] I’m \nleaving. So[,] I was telling the officers I was leaving. \n  23\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 24 of 88  PAGEID #: 5694\n \n[After being sprayed a second time,] I noticed that the officers w[ere] chasing me . . . So[,] \nI let them know I was obeying their commands. So[,] I ran back to the sidewalk. \n \n(Id. at 71–72 (emphasis added)). The second spraying was painful. Her eyes burned, and her vision \nblurred. She was unable to continue her search for her daughter. She sat down on the sidewalk, \nbetween High Street and Third Street, screaming for help. She discerned two officers were walking \ntowards her in riot gear; she hoped help was on the way at last. Instead, CPD officers sprayed her \nagain—now, for the third time. (Id. at 73). \nImmobilized on the street curb, she tried to stand up. But this awful tale was still far from \nover: \nAnd one of the officers pushed me down so hard off the curb. And once again, pardon my \nlanguage, Your Honor, and members of the court, he stomped on my kneecap, my left \nkneecap, and stated to me, That’s what you get for being down here, you black, protesting \nbitch.43 That’s what the fuck you get for being down here, you black protesting bitch . . . . \n \nI began to scream, You broke my leg – that he broke my leg, basically, because I felt a snap \nand intense pain. It happened so quickly that the next thing you know, I was getting \nsnatched back up onto the sidewalk[,] where people began to try to help me walk and get \naway. \n   \n(ECF No. 47 at 74–75). \nA 22-second video introduced at the hearing shows a portion of these events. (Pl.’s Ex. \n101). In it, Plaintiff Mixon is shown near two or three officers. She walks away. The individual \nrecording provides narration of increased urgency: “This lady has done nothing. This lady has \ndone nothing. They have done nothing wrong.” (Id.). At this point, Plaintiff Mixon is pepper-\nsprayed while walking away from the officers, stumbles into the street while an officer continues \nin pursuit. The narrated video continues: “They have done nothing wrong. They did nothing wrong. \nAre you kidding me?” (Pl.’s Ex. 101). \n \n43 There was some ambiguity as to whether the officer said, “you black bitch” or if he omitted the word “black.” \n(Compare ECF No. 47 at 74, with id. at 99).  Either way, that statement is atrocious.  \n  24\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 25 of 88  PAGEID #: 5695\nA body camera video shows the same events, timestamped at 10:08 p.m. (Pl.’s Ex. 147). \nPlaintiff Mixon approaches the officers, yelling repeatedly and unmistakably that she is trying to \nfind her daughter—imploring that they help. An officer shakes a can of chemical spray as Plaintiff \nMixon draws near. A separate officer pushes her away. While Plaintiff Mixon tells the body-\ncamera-wearing officer, “I just want to find my daughter. I don’t think all officers are bad,” a \nseparate officer comes and pushes her away again. (Id.). \nApproximately one minute into the body camera video, Plaintiff Mixon is heard screaming \nafter being sprayed from behind. The officers continue east on Broad Street, spraying individuals \nwho are standing still or walking away from them. Approximately 2 minutes and 5 seconds into \nthe video, Plaintiff Mixon can be seen and heard falling from the sidewalk into the street. An \nofficer to her left then sprays her with chemical spray while she is on the ground and pushes her \nfrom behind as she attempts to stand. The officer whose body-worn camera is recording walks past \nMs. Mixon as she states that her leg is broken and asks for help. He returns at approximately 3 \nminutes, 20 seconds into the video as Plaintiff Mixon is speaking to another officer, Officer Frank \nLeeman, who is assisting her with her injuries. \nPlaintiff Mixon is heard, pleading, while surrounded by officers: \nI don’t want to die. I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die. I just came to find my daughter \n. . . I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die. Please, Frank, don’t let me \ndie. Please, Frank. Please, Frank, Please. Please, Frank. I can’t see. Please help me . . . \nFrank, Frank, I can’t see, Frank. I don’t think all officers are bad . . . Please. Please . . . I \njust came to find my daughter. \n \n(Pl.’s Ex. 147). Plaintiff Mixon never located her daughter. But, she recalls: “[S]omehow she \nended up finding me.” (ECF No. 47 at 81). Ms. Mixon was then taken to the hospital, where she \nhad emergency surgery on her knee and was hospitalized for five days. (Pl.’s Ex. 73 (showing her \nscar)). Whether she would attend, or perhaps, more accurately, be in the vicinity of a protest again, \n  25\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 26 of 88  PAGEID #: 5696\nMs. Mixon testified that she would not: “If I wasn’t afraid of police officers before, I’m nervous \nabout them now.” (ECF No. 47 at 89). \nc.  Other Events on May 29 \nElsewhere on May 29, there was, indeed, the sort of chaos and vandalism that then-Chief \nQuinlan feared. Testimony from CPD officers evinced their difficulty in controlling a growing \nprotest. Officer Johnson arrived during daylight on May 29 to a “much more organized” crowd \n“with like fatigue-style clothing, tactical-style clothing on, backpacks full of, like, items with \nfrozen water bottles now, meaning they went downtown with frozen water bottles, chunks of rocks \nin their backpacks, gas masks.” (ECF No. 51 at 90). SWAT-team member Officer Ohl recalled \narriving downtown around 9:00 or 9:30 p.m., where individuals were graffitiing the Ohio Supreme \nCourt building. (ECF No. 50 at 188 (testifying those individuals ran away when the officers turned \ntheir lights and sirens on)). Commander Smith Weir testified to the looting from that evening. \n(ECF No. 52 at 129).  \nMr. Somerville of 10TV arrived downtown around 5:30 p.m. and departed at 8:00 p.m. He \nrecalled seeing protestors throwing objects at the police and officers pepper-spraying the crowd \nnear  Broad  and  High  Street.  (ECF  No.  51  at  29).  Mr.  Somerville  testified  at  the  hearing: \n“[A]nytime I saw pepper spray used, it was as a measure to control the crowd[,] and it was not \nunwarranted.” (Id. at 30). Yet, in his video from the day prior, he is recorded saying: “Oh, wow, \nwe’ve just been pepper[-]sprayed for no reason.” (Defs.’ Ex. 24 (at 46:29)). \nIn terms of which came first—protestors throwing items towards police or police spraying \nprotestors with irritants and munitions—the record is mixed. \nCommander Weir testified that the use of crowd-control devices followed protestor-\ninvolved violence: “[N]othing would happen when they weren’t throwing things and objects, \n  26\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 27 of 88  PAGEID #: 5697\nwhatever. But obviously[,] at different times[,] there would be objects thrown at our officers, and \nthat’s when we would authorize the use of mace to move the crowd or try to disperse the crowd  . . . \n[I]f the crowd is being peaceful, we’re not using mace.” (ECF No. 52 at 131–32). Mr. Somerville’s \nrecordings also show numerous standoffs between police and protestors, each with a familiar \npattern of congregants throwing objects (water bottles or milk jugs, and rarely, fireworks) and the \npolice engaging in direct and indiscriminate firing of munitions and chemical irritants. (Defs.’ Exs. \n24, 25). Other times, the timing was reversed: “Every time [the officers] spray, more and more \nbottles come their way.” (Defs.’ Ex. 24). \nOther evidence points towards the department’s reflexive reliance on pepper spray. A \nbody-worn camera video that evening shows a CPD supervisor stating to the officers that “the \ngroup at Broad and High is going to move. They’re not going to stay there . . . Tell them to move \n. . . We are going to move them by any means necessary⸺reasonably necessary. Everybody got \nthat? Get your mace ready.” (Pl.’s Ex. 123-A). \nThere were multiple other instances of the use of less-lethal tactics without apparent \nprovocation. One video shows a SWAT officer deploying chemical spray against two people \nstanding on the sidewalk, who appear to be recording the officers on their phones. (Pl.’s Ex. 107). \nA body-worn camera at the corner of Broad and Front Street shows a supervisor directing officers \nthat they will use a Mark-9 chemical spray against the protestors nearby “on the bang,” i.e., once \nan officer activated a noise signal. (Pl.’s Exs. 110-A, 110-B, 123-C). A video at the intersection of \nBroad and High Street shows an officer throwing a dispersal device into protestors standing in the \nstreet; much of the crowd flees, and two additional munitions follow. (Pl.’s Ex. 115; see also Pl.’s \nEx. 116 (throwing an explosive device towards protestors holding signs)). \n  27\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 28 of 88  PAGEID #: 5698\nThe same group of officers who were told to “get [their] mace ready” at roll call are now \nmounted on bikes, riding into individuals standing on the sidewalk while screaming at them to \n“move.” (Pl.’s Ex. 123-B). The body-camera-wearing officer sprays chemical irritants at random, \nhitting individuals standing peacefully on the sidewalk—and then yells, “clear the area!” (Id.). \nSome sprayed individuals have their hands up and are asking why they are being sprayed. All of \nthese individuals were standing on the sidewalk. (Pl.’s Ex. 123-B; see also Pl.’s Ex. 123-C \n(explosive devices and large amounts of chemical spray); Pl.’s Ex. 110-B (same event); Pl.’s Ex. \n125 (throwing a grenade across Broad Street toward the sidewalk, while another officer deploys \nchemical spray at a car); Pl.’s Ex. 126 (spraying protestors directly in the face with chemical \nirritants)). \nPlaintiff Torrie Ruffin, a special education teacher’s assistant, summarized the night of \nMay 29 well: “[T]here was peaceful protesting going on, there was some police aggression and \nsome police push towards the protestors. And the situation turned, I guess, chaotic or dangerous.” \n(ECF No. 46 at 125 (summarizing her friends’ recounting)). \n3.  Saturday, May 30, 2020 \nOn May 30, Governor Mike DeWine called in the National Guard; Mayor Ginther declared \na State of Emergency and instituted a 10:00 p.m. curfew. (Quinlan Aff. ¶ 7). The tension of the \nlast two days continued. (Pl.’s Ex. 103 (officers firing projectiles, striking individuals); Pl.’s Ex. \n104 (bowling tear gas canister into crowd); Pl.’s Ex. 108 (spraying kneeling individuals on May \n30  or  31);  Pl.’s  Ex.  112  (spraying  irritants  directly  at  individuals  who  are  fleeing  a  prior \ndeployment of spray); Pl.’s Ex.117 (similar); Pl.’s Ex.118 (similar); Pl.’s Ex. 114 (similar, \nincluding against a woman using a mobility device); Pl.’s Exs. 136, 137 (similar, including \nspraying those fleeing or turning to flee); Pl.’s Ex. 127 (officers on horses deploying tear gas, with \n  28\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 29 of 88  PAGEID #: 5699\nothers spraying individuals on sidewalks); Pl.’s Ex. 141 (recording High and Broad Street in the \nafternoon, showing scores of individuals coughing, evidently fleeing the deployment of a chemical \nirritant); Pl.’s Ex. 142 (firing projectiles at crowd on street and sidewalk, with a videographer \ntackled by an officer); Pl.’s Ex. 42 (using bicycle to shove woman who has been yelling, and then \nusing chemical spray against her)). \nIn one of the more shocking series of events, an officer grabs a man’s gas mask off of his \nhead from behind, while, notably, the man was walking away. The man reacts and fights back; \nother officers tackle him to the ground. (Pl.’s Exs. 127, 128, 138). \nAt 12:10 p.m., a body-worn camera shows the officer who grabbed the gas mask off of the \nindividual’s head celebrating; he fist-bumps another officer and giggles gleefully: “I took his mask \noff . . . He didn’t like it.” (Pl.’s Ex. 138). \nThis Court heard similar stories from other witnesses and Plaintiffs present on May 30, \nreviewed below. \na.  Plaintiff Summer Schultz \nPlaintiff Summer Schultz, a master-maker artist, attended the protests on High Street, \naround 10:30 a.m., with her wife, Leanne, and friend, Tori. (ECF No. 49 at 118). The atmosphere \nwas  “beautifully  painful,”  with  an  overwhelming  sense  of  community.  (Id.  at  119).  Law \nenforcement presence was large and included rooftop sharpshooters, bicycle officers, and “[a]rmy \nReserve or military people.” (Id. at 120). \nThe trio listened to speeches on the lawn at the Statehouse before hearing “people \nscreaming.” (Id. at 121–22). Ms. Schultz, who has sensitive lungs, started coughing and deduced \nthat officers began spraying some sort of chemical irritant. She does not recall any comprehensible \norder to disperse, but only a “muffled” speaker atop a “Hummer-looking police vehicle.” (Id.). In \n  29\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 30 of 88  PAGEID #: 5700\nmemorable language, Plaintiff Schultz describe the speaker as sounding “a lot like how Charlie \nBrown’s phone conversations sound. We couldn’t make it out.” (Id. at 141; see also id. at 123 \n(“[A]ll the protestors were looking at each other like[,] what did they say, did you hear that . . . \nAnd nobody could make it out”)). \nThough Plaintiff Schultz noted no hostile protesting, she was hit by the first of what would \nbe three sprayings of a chemical irritant. (ECF No. 49). Soon thereafter, Plaintiff Schultz was \nstanding in Broad Street, and officers deployed another two rounds of spray, at least one of which \nhit her in the face. (Id. at 127 (“Like split second, as soon as you open your eyes, it burns.”)). It \nwas then that Plaintiff Schultz was struck with some projectile—which turned out to be a knee \nknocker—bringing her to the ground. (Pl.’s Ex. 67 (showing injury)). \nPlaintiff Schultz did not attend any more protests afterward. She “was very scared to go \nback.” (ECF No. 49 at 133). Instead, she offered her support to the protests in other ways, such as \nhaving conversations with people or dropping off water to demonstrators. (Id.). When advising her \nfriends on whether to attend protests, she “urged them against it.” (Id.). \nb.  Plaintiff Torrie Ruffin \nPlaintiff Torrie Ruffin and a few friends attended the protest downtown just after 10:00 \na.m. (ECF No. 46 at 105 (“It was a very peaceful, powerful moment.”)). Later, she and her friends \njoined a sit-in protest in the street, by the intersection of Broad and High Street, chanting, “this is \na peaceful protest.” (Id.). Two or three officers came by with mace and sprayed the faces of the \nsitting protestors, hitting Ms. Ruffin. She received no order to leave the street. (Id. at 111). Plaintiff \nRuffin fled to cleanse her eyes, face, and throat from the spray.  \nLater that day, Ms. Ruffin and other demonstrators stood in a crosswalk chanting, linked \narm-in-arm. (Id. at 110). Bicycle officers arrived “to actually push and physically move us to the \n  30\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 31 of 88  PAGEID #: 5701\nside to allow more officers to come in . . . And then there was another mass spraying of pepper \nspray into the protestors’ faces.” (ECF No. 46 at 110–11). \nShe did not observe any physically aggressive behavior from the protestors preceding \neither spraying. \nAt some point that day, Plaintiff Ruffin recalled sitting on a curb when horse-mounted \nofficers started walking through the crowd; officers in riot gear placed things in the middle of the \nstreet before running away. “And then there were . . . smoke bombs that ended up going off.” (ECF \nNo. 46 at 116 (explaining that officers also threw smoke bombs onto the sidewalk)). \nPlaintiff Ruffin testified that she observed a young woman who was recording while talking \nto a bicycle officer; the officer sprayed the woman with pepper spray “directly point-blank in the \neyes. She turned for a second. She came back up and said something to him[,] and he sprayed her \npoint-blank in the eyes again.” (Id. at 116). A similar event occurred moments later. She saw a \nman with a gas mask “calmly walking” away. (Id. at 117). “And there’s an officer that ran from \nbehind him, ran up to him, seemingly hit him on the head, pulled his mask off and then took pepper \nspray and was spraying into his mask, into the guy’s face.” (Id. at 117). A police truck then drives \nby, ordering the congregants to leave the area. \nc.  Plaintiff Bryan Hazlett \nPlaintiff Bryan Hazlett attended the protest to accompany a friend around 7:30 p.m. Upon \narrival along High Street, he noted a “quite peaceful” crowd; “just a bunch of people standing \naround, hands up, don’t shoot chants, stuff like that.” (ECF No. 49 at 51; id. at 53 (“When we first \ngot down there, there was really nothing much going on, just a wall of police.”)). As the hour drew \non, officers “started firing wooden bullets,” prompting protestors to get “plywood to protect \nthemselves from said wood bullets and tear gas canisters.” (Id. at 53; Defs.’ Ex. 52 (same); ECF \n  31\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 32 of 88  PAGEID #: 5702\nNo. 49 at 61 (stating the knee knockers were “everywhere” on the ground)). Some protestors threw \nwater bottles at officers, but Mr. Hazlett did not observe any other objects thrown. In addition, a \n“piercing siren,” ordering protestors to disperse, was sounding. (ECF No. 49 at 60). Mr. Hazlett \nsaid he was unsure why there was a dispersal order, as the protest was primarily peaceful and there \nwas no effective curfew. Nevertheless, he entered the street to reunite with his friend (she had gone \ninto the street to protest earlier); he intended to depart afterward. \nBut, as Plaintiff Hazlett enters the intersection of Russell Street and High Street, a video \nshows CPD officers chasing several individuals and body slamming them to the ground, including \nMr. Hazlett; an officer also sprays him with a chemical irritant. (Pl.’s Exs. 135, 139). Mr. Hazlett \nprovides a summary of what transpired: \nI was tear[-]gassed. That was painful. And then I got hit by the police officer, dropped to \nthe ground. That was extremely painful . . . I curled up in the fetal position to protect my \nface and then to which the officer said[,] give me your arm[,] and then another officer \ncircled back around, tear[-]gassed me again, and at that point[,] I had given up my arm[,] \nand then they basically were just kneeing me and elbowing me and shoving my head into \nthe ground and then they zip[-]tied my hands behind my back. My leg was bleeding. My \nface was burning. That was about it. \n \n(ECF No. 49 at 68). Mr. Hazlett was then arrested. (Id.). \nWhether Mr. Hazlett would attend another protest: “I don’t think I would . . . It was a \nhorrible experience.” (Id. at 72). \nd.  Witness Michael Andrew Moses \nWitness Michael Andrew Moses attended the protests on May 30 around 9:00 p.m. \n“[S]onically,” he recalled, “it was an overwhelming environment.” (ECF No. 46 at 32). There was \nabout a half-football-field buffer between the officers, clad in armor and holding shields, and the \nprotestors. (Id. at 32). While the scene was largely peaceful—and he did not observe protestors \nthrowing any bottles, rocks, or other items—the atmosphere was “chaotic.” (Id. at 33). Mr. Moses \n  32\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 33 of 88  PAGEID #: 5703\nheard a “garbled” and “muffled” bullhorn command. (Id. at 32, 37, 58). Other protestors gestured \nto the confused congregants that the police wanted them to start moving north. Minutes after \nmoving north, Mr. Moses was surprised to almost immediately feel two projectiles of some kind \nhit him in quick succession: one on his left ribs and the other on his back. He ran away from the \nscene to a coffeeshop doorway. He “heard a whole lot of boots marching directly their way,” and \nMr. Moses was grabbed by his right wrist and arm, forced down to the ground, hitting his face and \nright shoulder. (Id. at 36). He was cuffed, put into a vehicle with a handful of other seized \nindividuals, and went through processing at Jackson Pike Corrections Center. (Pl.’s Ex. 65 \n(showing his injuries)). \nAs to whether he would attend a protest again: “In general, no.” (ECF No. 46 at 44). \ne.  Plaintiff Bernadette Calvey \nPlaintiff Bernadette Calvey, a nurse’s assistant, attended the protest in the Short North area \nwith her friend, arriving around 9:00 p.m. at the intersection of High Street and Second or Third \nStreet. (ECF No. 46 at 61–62 (“Protestors were yelling or chanting Black Lives Matter or specific \nnames . . . [officers] were in riot gear lined up across the street.”)). At this point, Plaintiff Calvey \nwas standing on the sidewalk and had not yet even joined in the actual protest. (Id. at 63 (“I \nwas . . . there for a very short period of time . . . I hadn’t joined the protestors . . .  I didn’t step into \nthe street where the other protestors were. I was just observing from the sidewalk.”)). \nThough Plaintiff Calvey did not observe any protestor-police confrontations, she noticed \npolice officers shouting; CPD personnel then fired projectiles at demonstrators at close range. (Id. \nat 62). Ms. Calvey, still on the sidewalk, was struck in the face by a projectile, a wooden pellet, \nwhich split open her chin. (Id. at 64 (“It hit me directly like dead center on my chin.”)). A white \npowder also exploded, which temporarily blinded her. She and others fled into an alley, at which \n  33\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 34 of 88  PAGEID #: 5704\npoint she heard a police bullhorn order the protestors’ dispersal. (Id. at 237). She did not hear any \nannouncement to leave before she was struck in the face. (Pl.’s Ex. 132 (video); Pl.’s Ex. 62 \n(picture of chin injury); Pl.’s Ex. 55 (police report)). \nWhether Ms. Calvey would attend a protest again: “I would definitely be hesitant. This was \nmy first protest, and I was there for less than five minutes and ended up getting shot in the face . . \n. but I don’t want to say I would never attend one again because I don’t want to be scared off.” \n(ECF No. 46 at 73). \nf.  Plaintiff Nadia Lynch \nPlaintiff Nadia Lynch, a billing and savings analyst, joined the protests near the Statehouse \nin the morning, around 10:45 or 11:00 a.m., with her sister. She testified to the protestors’ “unity” \nand “lifted spirits.” (ECF No. 48 at 181). Closer to noon, Plaintiff Lynch was walking toward the \nsidewalk at High and Broad Street when an officer pulls her by her backpack, tackles her to the \nground, and arrests her. (Pl.’s Ex. 148; ECF No. 48 at 182 (“I couldn’t tell you the reason I was \narrested. And as soon as I went down, I didn’t know what crime I had committed”); Pl.’s Ex. 71 \n(arrest sheet)). And she testified that she did not hear any instruction to disperse from the traffic \nway prior to being arrested. (ECF No. 48 at 189–90). Plaintiff Lynch was then placed in what she \ndescribed as “a paddy wagon,” was taken to a police substation where she and others were zip-\ntied, sat outside in the sun for five to six hours, and then transported on a sheriff’s bus to Jackson \nPike Corrections Center for slating, sitting in a holding cell for about half an hour or so. (Id. at \n187). She did not attend any more protests after her arrest. (Id. at 199). \ng.  Plaintiff Stephanie Carlock \nPlaintiff Stephanie Carlock traveled to the protests downtown around 4:00 p.m. (ECF No. \n49 at 185). By 5:15 p.m., she and others were standing arm-in-arm in the High Street crosswalk, \n  34\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 35 of 88  PAGEID #: 5705\nfacing south; the police were standing in front of that group, with just a three-foot separation \nbetween the groups. The officers “in sync all reached for their pepper spray” and sprayed the \nprotestors “point-blank in the face,” causing “[a] really intense burning pain.” (Id. at 191). She \nretreated to the sidewalk, pouring milk into her eyes to ease the pain. A dispersal announcement \nsounded, “[b]ut then a moment later[,] [officers in riot gear] started throwing tear gas canisters,” \ncausing Plaintiff Carlock and others to retreat further south towards the Statehouse. (Id. at 193). \nShe observed some protestors throwing water bottles towards police officers, prompting other \nprotestors to urge them to stop.  \nLater, she and other demonstrators sat in the road as a form of protest at the intersection of \nFifth and Broad Street. (Id. at 197). An officer told them to get out of the street and onto the \nsidewalk, so some of the group, Plaintiff Carlock included, stood up and dispersed to the sidewalk. \nBut some of the horse-mounted officers “started pushing into the crowd . . . physically [running] \ninto some of us.” (Id.). The demonstrators’ questions of what to do—now that they had complied \nwith the order to disperse from the street—went unanswered. Instead, the officers “herded” the \ngroup south, where they met another line of officers blocking the street, thus trapping the \nprotestors. (Id.). Officers then threw a tear gas canister at the group on the sidewalk, and “it was \nalmost impossible to get out of that spot we were in.” (Id. at 199). The protestors fled toward the \nonly point of egress: an alleyway in which a delivery truck was parked, thus allowing for a \nbottleneck of one person at a time to squeeze through. (ECF No. 49 at 201 (“They hadn’t \ncommunicated anything after they said to get up on the sidewalk despite us asking what they \nwanted us to do. They didn’t provide any further instruction.”)). \n  35\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 36 of 88  PAGEID #: 5706\nMs.  Carlock  attended  additional  protests  in  late  summer  and  early  fall,  including  a \n“gathering of remembrance” for Breonna Taylor, a 27-year-old Black medical worker who was \nshot and killed in her own apartment by Louisville, Kentucky police.44  (Id. at 213). \n4.   Sunday, May 31, 2020 \nLea Pagels, an investigator and litigation specialist at the Ohio Public Defenders, attended \nmost days of last year’s protests, including May 31, as a legal observer for the National Lawyers \nGuild. (ECF No. 49 at 4). She testified to seeing police use force against protestors “[u]nder a wide \nrange of circumstances. I saw them use chemical weapons, bicycles, fists, flashbangs on people on \nsidewalks, on streets, in groups, alone.” (Id. at 5). The most common less-lethal dispersal technique \nshe  observed  was  pepper  spray,  followed  by  knee-knockers.  “And  then  more  increasingly \nthroughout the summer[,] I saw [officers’] bicycles being used as weapons.” (Id.). Although she \ntestified to mostly peaceful crowds, she recalled bottles of water thrown. (Id. at 22; Defs.’ Ex. 41 \n(showing protestors throwing bottles, and officers shooting projectiles indiscriminately at 57:27)). \nMs. Pagels arrived downtown, near the intersection of Broad and High Street, early evening \non Sunday, with her fellow legal observer, Chris Noble. (ECF No. 49 at 7). Much of her testimony \nwas devoted to discussing a woman to whom she referred as “the woman in white.” (Id.). A video \nMs. Pagels recorded shows the woman in white sitting in the middle of West Broad Street. (Pl.’s \nEx. 102-A; ECF No. 49 at 9). The witness recounted: \nI observed the woman in white . . . sitting there peacefully . . . I observed the camouflaged \nofficers point a gun at her. At the time[,] I didn’t know what was in the gun . . . I saw an \nofficer spray her in the face with pepper spray at what I would consider point-blank range \n. . . her body is quite limp. \n \n(ECF No. 49 at 9–10). \n \n44 Richard A. Oppel, Jr., Derrick Bryson Taylor, and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs, What to Know About Breonna \nTaylor’s Death, N.Y. Times, Apr. 26, 2021,  https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html. \n  36\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 37 of 88  PAGEID #: 5707\nStills taken from a video show officers spraying the woman in white at point-blank range. \n(Pl.’s Ex. 68). Another video Ms. Pagels took shows an officer standing in a bus shelter, apparently \nshooting an unknown projectile towards the woman in white. (Pl.’s Ex. 102-B (narrating “Oh, my \nGod, they’re going to shoot her again . . . She’s injured.”)). In both videos, a police recording \nordering congregants’ dispersal is heard plainly. (Pl.’s Exs. 102-A, 102-B). \nAn officer dressed in military combat gear pivots his attention toward Ms. Pagels and Mr. \nNoble. He begins shooting projectiles at the pair of fleeing legal observers. (Pl.’s Ex. 102-B \n(narrating, “I’m getting shot at right now”)). The noise from the rotary gun echoes; Ms. Pagels \nyells to Mr. Noble, “Stay with me, Chris. Stay with me.” (Id.). Ms. Pagels likened what she \nexperienced to a video game, recalling “ducking,” “dodging,” “avoiding officers . . . spring[ing] \nout from alleys with their guns,” and “zigzagging our way as best as we could to safety.” (ECF \nNo. 49 at 28; see also id. at 48 (“Most terrifying experience . . . I definitely suffered from PTSD.”)). \nWhen asked if she would encourage or discourage others from attending a protest, Ms. \nPagels stated that she would advise nobody with underlying health conditions to attend, given the \nuse of chemical agents. (Id. at 31 (recalling that those with respiratory conditions suffered \nespecially)). She also would encourage prospective protestors to understand “the violence that they \nmight endure” from law enforcement. (Id. at 31). \nAround 5:00 p.m., Plaintiff Rebecca Lamey traveled with a friend to the area near the \nStatehouse, around Broad and High Street. (ECF No. 47 at 13). There was a bit of “idle time,” \ninterspersed with demonstrators shouting, chanting, and kneeling. (Id.; see also id. at 9 (“Some \npeople were obviously maybe a little bit louder than others. But it was, overall, I would say \npleasant.”)). The atmosphere began to change when the demonstrations divided into two. (Id. at \n12 (“A lot of [the officers] were already wearing their riot gear, but a lot of them were starting to \n  37\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 38 of 88  PAGEID #: 5708\nput their gas masks on. It started to become more apparent that violence was the language they \nwere wanting to speak that day.”)).  \nAt 7:50 p.m., the now-familiar automated dispersal order sounded. (Pl.’s Ex. 130 (“This is \nan emergency situation . . . Please leave the area.”); see ECF No. 47 at 14 (emphasizing there was \nnot any direct order to depart)). \nAt 7:52 p.m., a defense exhibit video shows this same intersection—Broad and High \nStreet—with several demonstrators standing atop a truck, brandishing guns. (Defs.’ Ex. 41 (at \n52:32)). Ms. Lamey did not recall seeing the truck or these individuals atop it. The video also \nshows a different young man throwing something like a water bottle towards the officers, who \nwere wearing riot gear. (Id.). \nA video recorded by a surveillance camera, stationed at the corner of Broad Street and High \nStreet, shows SWAT officers firing projectiles and tear gas into a crowd that soon after disperses. \n(Pl.’s Ex. 109; see also ECF No. 47 at 15). Ms. Lamey, fearful of being trampled, stepped to the \nside to avoid the dispersing crowd. \nAt  7:54  p.m.—four  minutes  after  Plaintiff  Lamey  first  recalls  hearing  the  dispersal \nannouncement—she was struck by one of these munitions while walking on the sidewalk. (Id. at \n15). Specifically, a SWAT officer turned the corner and fired his rotary gun; one knee knocker \nstruck Plaintiff Lamey on the hand; she was struck four more times on her inner thighs, left hip, \nand buttock. (Pl.’s Exs. 146, 130, 130-A; Defs.’ Ex. 36 (showing a screenshot of Pl.’s Ex. 140)). \nIt is unclear whether the projectile was direct- or skip-fired. (Pl.’s Ex. 130 (video of incident); Pl.’s \nEx. 131 (similar); Defs.’ Ex. 46)). \n  38\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 39 of 88  PAGEID #: 5709\nLater, the above-mentioned surveillance camera video also shows a tactical van driving \nsouth on High Street, firing projectiles at protestors on either side, while SWAT officers continue \nto fire projectiles north at individuals on High Street. \nPhotojournalist for The Columbus Dispatch, Adam Cairns, arrived at the intersection of \nBroad and High Street in his professional capacity around 9:15 p.m., bearing his press badge. (ECF \nNo. 46 at 230). A photo Mr. Cairns took, timestamped at 9:44 p.m., shows an officer who appears \nfull faced to his camera. Mr. Cairns testified that the officer yelled in Mr. Cairns’ direction to leave, \nand as Mr. Cairns turned to leave, he was struck in the cheek with a wooden projectile. \n5.  Monday, June 1, 2020 \nPlaintiff Andrew Fahmy, a personal banker, joined the protests downtown, near Broad and \nHigh Street, the evening of June 1 at 5:00 p.m. (See generally ECF No. 47; id. at 105 (“People \nwere not really organized . . . .”)). Later, the protestors marched north on High Street; Mr. Fahmy, \nand his friend who accompanied him, followed. (Id. at 109).  \nBy 9:45 p.m., Plaintiff Fahmy ended up near High and Lane, close to Ohio State’s campus. \nAt 10:20 p.m., five to ten police cruisers, mostly SUVs, drove northbound on High Street. \n(Id. at 113). The officers were wearing riot gear, corralling the crowd from the south. Within a few \nminutes, Mr. Fahmy “saw like a yellow mist and streams of pepper spray, and I saw people kind \nof -- a couple of people like hit the ground and were screaming, and a couple of people were trying \nto pour water in their eyes.” (Id. at 114). Mr. Fahmy did not hear any orders to disperse, nor any \norders relating to curfew. (Id. at 115 (“No, not at all”); id. at 135–36 (“I would have heard it over \nthe chants.”)). \n  39\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 40 of 88  PAGEID #: 5710\nWithin a few minutes, tensions continued to rise, and protestors continued to protest. (ECF \nNo. 47 at 118 (“[A] lot of the protestors were yelling . . . .”)). Officers in riot gear were positioned \non one side of the street, and the protestors, roughly 20 or 30 feet away, opposite the police. \nShortly after 10:27 p.m., Plaintiff Fahmy was struck by a canister of tear gas a few inches \nabove his left ankle, which “felt like . . . a big . . . 20-pound dumbbell.” (Id. at 119; Pl.’s Ex. 134-\nB (video taken by witness); Pl.’s Ex. 134-A (same incident from a different angle)). Mr. Fahmy \nsought medical attention a few days after, and the injury proved to be a severe break. (Compare \nECF No. 47 at 126 (stating he was in a boot for two-and-a-half-months), and Pl.’s Ex. 76 (x-ray \nof fracture), with ECF No. 48 at 28 (Deputy Chief Quinlan testifying that he would be surprised if \nbeing hit by a tear gas canister could fracture a bone)). \nMr. Fahmy has been invited to subsequent protests, and he has responded with: “a hard no \n. . . my personal experience was very negative.” (ECF No. 47 at 128). \nWitness Maeve Walsh, a student journalist for the Ohio State student newspaper, The \nLantern, covered the protests on location that evening, June 1. (ECF No. 46 at 11). Just as Mr. \nFahmy testified, the protest began downtown, near the Statehouse, and terminated closer to the \nOhio State’s campus. (Id.). She was joined by her two colleagues, Max Garrison and Sarah Szilagy. \n(Id. at 11–12 (estimating 200 protestors and 20 officers)). The trio arrived around 9:00 or 9:30 \np.m. (Id. at 11). Part of the newspaper protocol is for the student-journalists to identify themselves \nas much as possible. Thus, Ms. Walsh and her colleagues donned their press badges, a Lantern \nsweatshirt, and a Lantern hat. (Id. at 13). She did not observe any acts of violence by the protestors.  \nThe curfew came at 10:00 p.m. Around 10:25 p.m., officers approached the student \njournalists in riot gear, ordering them to depart. Ms. Walsh tells the officers that she and her \n  40\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 41 of 88  PAGEID #: 5711\ncolleagues were members of the media and thus exempt from the 10:00 p.m. curfew. A video taken \nby Ms. Walsh near High Street and Lane Avenue shows how this interaction unfolded. \nAn officer approaches the students and says, “Leave, or you’re going to jail. Leave, or \nyou’re going to jail.” (Pl.’s Ex. 140-A). Ms. Walsh replies, “We’re members of the press,” and \nthus exempt from curfew, to which the officer replies, “I don’t care.” (Id.). At this point, the crowd \nof protestors had diminished significantly, and a dozen or so officers now outnumber the three \nstudents. The students begin to retreat while reminding the officers of their press pass. Seconds \nlater, an officer fires pepper spray at the students. The students run into an alley. The officers \ncontinue to pepper spray the journalists’ necks and backs. (Pl.’s Ex. 140-B). The next day, at the \nJune 2 CPD roll call, the incident commander alluded to the prior day’s events: “Reporters are not \nsubject to a curfew. And that should have been clear from the start.” (Pl.’s Ex. 25). \nMs. Walsh continued to cover the protests as a journalist. But she took precautions, \nincluding donning a facemask with a plastic film to protect her eyes against pepper spray. \n6.  Sunday, June 21, 2020 (Father’s Day Demonstration) \nProtests continued in Columbus throughout early June. Renewed protests began mid-June, \nparticularly after Rayshard Brooks, a 27-year-old Black man—was shot and killed by Atlanta \nPolice Department officers on June 12, 2020. In addition, Mayor Ginther and then-Chief Quinlan \nannounced a change in CPD policy, limiting the use of chemical sprays for crowd-control \nscenarios. (Quinlan Aff. ¶¶ 12–13 (“CPD policies now prohibit officers from using chemical spray \non a violent, non-aggressive crowd, even if they fail to leave the street.”) (emphasis added); ECF \nNo. 48 at 14 (“I understood that they would only use pepper spray against people who were being \nviolent.”); id. at 66 (same); id. at 71 (speculating officers did not “get the memo”)). \n  41\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 42 of 88  PAGEID #: 5712\nMr. Bardus, the street medic who rendered aid to the injured throughout the spring and \nsummer, returned to the protests to do the same on June 21, around 11:00 a.m., near High Street, \nsouth of Broad Street. (ECF No. 50 at 63 (observing about 50 protestors, mostly on the sidewalk)).  \nMs. Wenning also returned to the demonstrations on June 21 around 3:30 p.m. as a legal observer \nfor the National Lawyers Guild. (ECF No. 47 at 170, 175). \nAt Broad and High Street, she saw a dozen officers standing in the intersection, facing the \nprotestors, who were standing all along the southern edge of the intersection. (Id. at 170). Some \nprotestors at the front were holding reflective material in an apparent artistic protest to symbolize \npolice violence-reflecting police violence. (ECF No. 50 at 68). \nCommander Weir spoke into his radio and instructed officers to “clear High Street.” (ECF \nNo. 47 at 171; ECF No. 50 at 66). In attempts to do so, bicycle-mounted officers strike the \nprotestors and push them back. Mr. Bardus put it more directly: \nSo[,] they showed up on their bikes[,] and they shoved folks out of the street toward the \nsidewalk. They turned their bikes sideways and basically pushed people. I remember one \nprotestor, a woman, fell in the street, and the officer continued to push her with his bike \nwhile she was on the ground. \n \n(ECF No. 50 at 66). \nSome officers implemented Commander Weir’s order to clear High Street, but with the \nbicycles facing forwards, not sideways. A video shows an officer repeating, in an aggressively \nmonotone voice: “Get out of the road,” while riding forward into the crowd of stationary \nprotestors, who pled with him to stop and were crying out in pain. He and other officers engaged \nin some hand-to-hand combat with the protestors. (Pl.’s Ex. 105 (with one officer remarking, \napparently, “bitch” after pushing a protestor backward, into the ground)). The use of bicycles in \nthis manner is a tactic that Mayor Ginther testified was not compliant with the old or new policies. \nDeputy Chief Quinlan agreed impliedly but would not go so far as to say that the technique shown \n  42\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 43 of 88  PAGEID #: 5713\nin the above-mentioned video was inconsistent with training. (ECF No. 48 at 64). Mr. Quinlan \ntestified: “[O]ur bike training is designed to use a barrier between the protestors and police officers. \nTypically[,] the way I see it done is the bikes are turned sideways. [In the video played at the \nhearing, the bicycle,] looks like it’s more forward[-]facing. The other bikes appear to be sideways. \nThat’s more the technique.” (Id.). \nMost importantly, despite CPD’s newly implemented prohibition on the use of chemical \nirritants on non-aggressive individuals, such sprayings continued. (Pl.’s Exs. 105, 106).  \nMs. Wenning recalled from June 21: “I remember seeing this protestor get pepper[-] \nsprayed in the face[,] and then they turned around[,] and there was a medic right there [who] \nflushed their eyes . . . and then the protestor turned back around and immediately got sprayed again \ndirectly in the face.” (ECF No. 47 at 174). \nMr. Bardus remembered similarly: “Basically, the group that got sprayed was farther south, \ncloser to State [S]treet and High, and there was another group sprayed closer to High and Broad.” \n(ECF No. 55 at 66; id. at 68 (“I’m sort of ping-ponging between folks who need to have their eyes \nflushed.”); id. at 68–69 (describing “big arc[h]ing sprays of mace”)). \nBefore both of these crowd-control devices were deployed—the use of bikes and the \nspray—Mr. Bardus did not hear any order given to the protestors standing on the sidewalk. He \nalso did not witness the protestors do anything violent against the officers. (ECF No. 50 at 67). \nMs.  Wenning’s  outlook  on  attending  protests  changed  after  attending  last  year’s \ndemonstrations. (ECF No. 47 at 176). She testified: \n[T]here are definitely times now where I will know that a protest is happening, and I feel \nlike I should not go or I decide not to go because I don’t want to risk getting sprayed or \ngetting tear gassed . . . [A]fter I was tear gassed on the 28th – and then also we didn’t talk \nabout this date, but two days afterward, I think on the 30th, I was also exposed to some tear \ngas on that day -- I had like spotting in between periods which I have heard my friends \nreport as well. And that really frightened me. That made me think there was damage done \n  43\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 44 of 88  PAGEID #: 5714\nto my body from tear gas. So[,] there are times that I have not gone to events, protests, \nbecause I thought something like that could happen.  \n \n(Id. at 177—76).  \n7.  CPD’s Characterization of the Protests \nMuch  of  the  testimony  and  evidence  presented  in  the  briefing  and  at  the  hearing \ndemonstrated that CPD approached last year’s protests differently than if the protests had not been \nabout police brutality. This is evident in then-Chief Quinlan’s June 2, 2020 roll call speech to \nofficers: “And with the situation when we’re the focus of the protest, we can’t afford to be the ones \nthat create that provocation. We just can’t . . . It’s a lot easier when they’re protesting something \nelse.”  (Pl.’s Ex. 25 (emphasis added); see also Pl.’s Ex. 4 (citing Thomas Quinlan Aff. ¶ 6)). \nHe echoed this position at the hearing: “They were against the police . . . I just know \nofficers were concerned for their safety[,] and they were against the police.” (ECF No. 48 at 89; \nbut see ECF No. 46 at 10, 28, 60, 103 (stating these witnesses are not members of any antipolice \ngroups); ECF No. 47 at 58, 142, 103 (same); ECF No. 49 at 4, 51, 117, 184 (same)). \nThis Court engaged in the following colloquy with Mr. Quinlan: \nTHE COURT:   Chief, you indicated that you advised our officers who were going \nto be the police presence at the protest that there was a national movement that was an \nantipolice movement. Did I characterize that correctly? And if not, tell me how you \ncharacterized it.  \n \nTHE WITNESS:  Yes, Your Honor. When I talked to officers, I said that these are – \nthese times are different than protests we typically deal with. We typically deal with \nprotestors on two sides[,] and we’re in the middle trying to keep the two opposing sides \nseparate to keep [the] peace. In this case, there [are] no two sides. It was protestors facing \npolice to have their voices heard about systemic racism in this country and in Columbus \nand that they were speaking out about that and that we were the focus of the protest activity. \nSo[,] that changed the dynamics.  \n \n(ECF No. 48 at 103–04). \n  44\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 45 of 88  PAGEID #: 5715\n  Commander Weir agreed, testifying that on May 28, the first substantive day of the \nprotests: “[B]ecause the protests were anticipated to be antipolice protests, we didn’t necessarily \nwant to be very visible.” (ECF No. 52 at 104). \n  CPD’s conduct revealed that officers conflated the spark of the protests (i.e., Mr. Floyd’s \nmurder) with the effects of the protest (i.e., chants that criticized police and police brutality). It is \nunderstandable why an officer might take personally profane and provocative chants. (ECF No. \n47 at 95 (“[O]ther people were yelling stuff like fuck you.”); ECF No. 51 at 71 (“They were saying \nfuck you[,] and fuck the police.”); ECF No. 52 at 127 (“[T]here was a bunch of [All Cops Are \nBastards (“ACAB”)] graffiti all around there.”)). But what is not comprehensible is why she would \nthen let that dictate her treatment of individuals exercising their First Amendment right, no matter \nhow unkind their chants and signs might be. (ECF No. 47 at 74–75 (“That’s what you get for being \ndown here you black protesting bitch.”)). \nWhat separates our nation from some others is the ability to criticize our leaders and those \nbearing the imprimatur of state authority without fear of retribution. Typically, police are the ones \nwho protect and ensure that this cherished right remains unencumbered. That is not what occurred \nlast summer. \nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nFour factors control the Court’s discretion to grant a preliminary injunction: (1) whether \nthe moving party has shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether the moving \nparty will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not issued; (3) whether the issuance of the \ninjunction would cause substantial harm to others; and (4) whether the public interest would be \nserved by issuing the injunction. Hall v. Edgewood Partners Ins. Ctr., Inc., 878 F.3d 524, 526–27 \n(6th Cir. 2017). While a strong likelihood of success is the crucial factor, all four must be balanced \n  45\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 46 of 88  PAGEID #: 5716\nrather than treated as prerequisites. McPherson v. Mich. High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, Inc., 119 F.3d \n453, 459 (6th Cir. 1997). Irreparable harm is nearly as crucial as the success factor: “Our frequently \nreiterated standard requires plaintiffs seeking preliminary relief to demonstrate that irreparable \ninjury is likely in the absence of an injunction.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, \n22–24 (2008). “The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, \nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.” Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976). \nIV.  LAW & ANALYSIS \nThis Court begins its legal analysis with a reminder from the Ninth Circuit: \nDemonstrations can be expected when the government acts in highly controversial ways[] \nor other events occur that excite  or arouse the passions of the citizenry. The more \ncontroversial the occurrence, the more likely people are to demonstrate. Some of these \ndemonstrations may become violent. The courts have held that the proper response to \npotential and actual violence is for the government to ensure an adequate police presence \nand to arrest those who actually engage in such conduct, rather than to suppress legitimate \nFirst Amendment conduct as a prophylactic measure. \n \nCollins v. Jordan, 110 F.3d 1363, 1372 (9th Cir. 1996) (citation omitted). \nA.  The Floyd Case Law \n \nSince the last year’s protests in the wake of George Floyd’s killing, there have been no \nfewer than seventy-three cases exploring how these protests shine a light on existing First \nAmendment or Fourth Amendment principles. (“Floyd Caselaw”).45  \n \n45 See, e.g., Abay v. City of Denver, 445 F. Supp. 3d 1286, 1292 (D. Colo. 2020) (granting the temporary restraining \norder and noting: “Officers used physical weapons and chemical agents to prevent not just peaceful demonstration, \nbut also the media’s ability to document the demonstrations and plaintiffs’ and third parties’ ability to offer aid to \ndemonstrators.”); Goyette v. City of Minneapolis, No. 20-CV-1302 (WMW/DTS), 2020 WL 3056705, at *1 (D. Minn. \nJune 9, 2020) (dismissing the case absent allegation of immediacy of harm); Don’t Shoot Portland v. City of Portland, \n465 F. Supp. 3d 1150, 1157 (D. Or. 2020) (granting a temporary restraining order, finding that while there was \ndestruction, these plaintiffs only engaged in peaceful and non-destructive protest and that officers might have been \nsubstantially motivated by an intent to interfere with plaintiffs’ constitutionally protected expression); Black Lives \nMatter Seattle-King Cnty. v. City of Seattle, Seattle Police Dep’t, 466 F. Supp. 3d 1206, 1210 (W.D. Wash. 2020) \n(finding a “clear showing” of a likelihood of success on the merits of the First Amendment claim because Plaintiffs \ndemonstrated that the officers’ actions—in the use of less-lethal crowd-control tactics, such as tear gas and pepper \nspray—were substantially motivated by Plaintiffs’ conduct and also had a chilling effect on the First Amendment \nactivity); Anti Police-Terror Project v. City of Oakland, 477 F. Supp. 3d 1066, 1069 (N.D. Cal. 2020). \n  46\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 47 of 88  PAGEID #: 5717\nEach case in the Floyd Caselaw presents a similar tale: protestors gather near buildings of \ncommunity significance, such as state capitol buildings, courthouses, and police stations, to \nexpress their horror and outrage at the killings of Black Americans at the hands of police officers; \nviolence occurs at the hands of demonstrators and officers alike; most demonstrators chant, sing, \nand exercise a number of nonviolent and constitutionally protected activities; other demonstrators \nserve as an accelerant, engage in violence, and ignore police commands; at various points, officers \nprotecting  municipal,  federal,  and  private  properties  are  subject  to  threats,  projectiles,  and \nsometimes violence; dispersal orders or instructions for how to comply with police orders are \neither unheard, unprovided, or unheeded; police deploy less-lethal munitions, resulting in injuries \nto violent, nonviolent, and compliant protestors as well as passersby. \nAs our sister courts have noted, there are several prevailing legal principles from the Floyd \nCaselaw. First, all individuals have a First Amendment right to protest the actions of government \nofficials, including police officers, without fear for their safety. Second, police officers, almost by \ndefinition, operate in an intense and volatile workplace context. Third, the Floyd Caselaw arises \nin unprecedented times that have upended life; the pandemic has also reminded us of the structural, \nunequal access to healthcare, particularly for Black, brown, indigenous, and rural communities, \nthose with pre-existing illnesses or stigmatized health profiles, and those with mobility limitations. \nFinally, the Floyd Caselaw courts have recognized an inherent difficulty in drawing an enforceable \nline that is sensitive to officers’ ability to quell violence and prevent the destruction of property \nwithout crossing the line into chilling free speech and abusing those who wish to exercise it. \nB.  Standing to Seek Injunctive Relief \nDefendants challenge the existence of standing to seek injunctive relief, arguing that \nPlaintiffs have not shown a real and immediate threat of future harm. (ECF No. 61-1 at 7). The \n  47\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 48 of 88  PAGEID #: 5718\ndoctrine  of  standing  arises  from Article  III  of  the  Constitution,  which  gives  federal  courts \njurisdiction over cases and controversies. U.S. CONST. art. III § 2; see also Lujan v. Defs. of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 559–60 (1992). The basic elements of standing are: (1) an injury in fact; \n(2) a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of; and (3) it must be likely, \nas opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Id. at \n560–61. To win declaratory or injunctive relief, a plaintiff “must show actual present harm or a \nsignificant possibility of future harm.” Grendell v. Ohio Supreme Court, 252 F.3d 828, 832 (6th \nCir. 2001).  \n1.  Injury in Fact \nAn injury in fact must be concrete, particularized, actual, and imminent. Friends of the \nEarth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180 (2000). Put another way, the \n“threatened injury must be ‘certainly impending’ to constitute injury in fact, and ‘[a]llegations \nof possible future injury’ are not sufficient.” Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 \n(2013) (quoting another source); O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495–96 (1974) (“Past exposure \nto illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief \n. . . if unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects.”). \nDefendants rely on City of Los Angles v. Lyons, where the plaintiff sought an injunction \nagainst  the  City  of  Los  Angeles  to  ban  the  use  of  chokeholds  in  certain \ncircumstances. 461 U.S. 95, 97–98  (1983).  In  Lyons,  LAPD  officers  placed  Mr.  Lyons  in  a \nchokehold during a routine traffic stop, which rendered Mr. Lyons unconscious and caused damage \nto his larynx. Id. at 97. On the initial remand, the district court found that officers stopped Mr. \nLyons for a traffic infringement without provocation or legal justification, the officers applied a \n  48\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 49 of 88  PAGEID #: 5719\ndepartment-authorized chokehold. Id. at 99 (summarizing the district court’s finding that the use \nof chokeholds in this manner “is unconscionable in a civilized society”). \nMr. Lyons sought injunctive relief. The Supreme Court found that Mr. Lyons failed to \ndemonstrate a case or controversy to justify his requested relief. That is, he was unable to establish \nstanding, absent proof of some real and immediate, rather than conjectural or hypothetical, injury \nor threatened injury. Id. at 101. “Nothing” in the police’s policy “suggest[ed] that the chokeholds \n. . . [were] authorized absent some resistance or other provocation,” the Court explained. Id. at \n106. Mr. Lyons could not show that another encounter with the police was likely, nor could he \ndemonstrate: (1) that all police officers in Los Angeles always choke any citizen with whom they \nhappen to have an encounter; or (2) that the City ordered or authorized police officers to act in \nsuch manner. Id. at 106, 110. Accordingly, the Lyons court reasoned that because no city policy \nauthorized  officers  to  use  illegal  chokeholds,  “it  is  surely  no  more  than  speculation  .  .  . \nthat Lyons himself will again be involved in one of those unfortunate instances, or that he will be \narrested in the future and provoke the use of a chokehold.” See id. at 108.46 \n \n46 While Lyons became a seminal case on the mootness doctrine, courts often rely upon it to assess standing. Indeed, \nthe Sixth Circuit has recently applied Lyons in election-law cases. See Shelby Advocates for Valid Elections v. Hargett, \n947 F.3d 977 (6th Cir. 2020), cert. denied, ––– U.S. ––––, (2020); Memphis A. Philip Randolph Inst. v. Hargett, 978 \nF.3d 378, 387 (6th Cir. 2020). In Shelby Advocates, an organizational plaintiff and four individual plaintiffs alleged \n“a variety of election administration problems,” including that “election workers [were] poorly trained, sometimes \ndistributing the wrong ballots . . . , sometimes recording the wrong address when registering a voter, and once \ndistributing a poll book without redacting voters’ personal information.” Shelby Advocates for Valid Elections, 947 \nF.3d at 980. Echoing Lyons, the court found that the plaintiffs failed to allege imminent harm because there was no \nevidence that “Shelby County election officials always make these mistakes” or that “the government entities ordered \nthe election workers to make any such mistakes.” Id. at 981 (emphasis added). \n \nIn Memphis A. Philip Randolph Institute, plaintiffs challenged Tennessee’s statutory scheme governing absentee \nvoting, particularly the signature verification procedures. Memphis A. Philip Randolph Inst., 978 F.3d at 378. \nAffirming the district court’s order denying the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, the Sixth Circuit found \nthat the plaintiffs had not clearly demonstrated that they face an actual, concrete, particularized, and imminent threat \nof harm. Unlike in Lyons, where the plaintiff had a concrete past injury resulting from government conduct, in \nMemphis A. Philip Randolph Institute, the plaintiffs could not cite with certainty or specificity any past erroneous \nrejection of absentee ballots. The Memphis A. Philip Randolph Institute plaintiffs also failed to overcome declarations \nfrom state election officials detailing the procedures implemented to protect against human errors in the signature \nverification process. For example, a mandatory training video instructed election officials to accept all but the most \n \n  49\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 50 of 88  PAGEID #: 5720\nEven when there is a concrete past harm such as in Lyons, the Sixth Circuit heeds the \nSupreme Court’s directive that “past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present \ncase or controversy regarding injunctive relief . . . if unaccompanied by any continuing, present \nadverse effects.” Grendell, 252 F.3d at 832 (quoting Lyons, 461 U.S. at 102, 103). In Grendell, for \nexample, the Sixth Circuit reviewed a case against the Ohio Supreme Court. Plaintiffs sought \ninjunctive  relief,  contending  that  the  Ohio  Supreme  Court  Practice  Rule  XIV  §  5  was \nunconstitutional on its face. Absent evidence of a real and immediate threat of repeated injury, Mr. \nGrendell’s prior injury (i.e., being previously sanctioned by the Ohio Supreme Court) did not \nestablish an adequate injury in fact to confer standing,. \nAs is relevant to this case, this Court draws the following principles from the Sixth Circuit’s \ninterpretation of Lyons. First, an absence of a concrete past injury proves fatal to proving standing. \nSecond, the alleged unlawful conduct must be pursuant to some policy, practice, or functional \nequivalent, and Plaintiffs’ past injuries must have stemmed from these policies or procedures. \nThird, there must be a non-speculative threat of repetition. \nHere, Defendants do not contest the existence of a past injury, so this Court’s standing \ndetermination will focus on the second and third questions. \na.  Policy, Practice, or Functional Equivalent \nRecall that the Supreme Court found in Lyons that because nothing in the policy of the Los \nAngeles  police  suggested  that  chokeholds  were  authorized  absent  some  resistance  or  other \nprovocation by the arrestee or other suspect, Mr.  Lyons had not established a “real and immediate \nthreat” that he would be stopped and choked again. Lyons, 461 U.S. at 105, 110. Evidence of  \n \nobviously inconsistent signatures. Before any ballot was rejected, three trained election officials, including an \nadministrator, must agree that the signature on the absentee ballot does not match the signature in the voter registration \nrecords. Given the training and protections practiced by state officials, the Sixth Circuit found it far from inevitable \nthat an absentee ballot will be incorrectly rejected due to an inconsistent signature. \n  50\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 51 of 88  PAGEID #: 5721\nrelatively few instances of violations by individual police officers, “without any showing of \na deliberate policy on behalf of the named defendants,” does not provide a basis to seek equitable \nrelief. Id. at 104. \nTherefore, in this case, Plaintiffs must show more than a few instances of alleged excessive \nforce or retaliatory treatment. Instead, Plaintiffs must put forth specific facts establishing a \ndeliberate policy of the City authorizing such misconduct. Daubenmire v. City of Columbus, No. \n2:04-CV-01105, 2008 WL 4758677, at *10 (S.D. Ohio Oct. 24, 2008). Short of an official written \npolicy authorizing the contested conduct, the question is whether anyone with policymaking \nauthority authorizes its officers to act in such a manner. Curtis v. City of New Haven, 726 F.2d 65, \n68 (2d Cir. 1984). \nHere,  Plaintiffs  identify  two  written  policies  or  practices  and  multiple  instances  of \nencouragement or authorization from senior departmental personnel sanctioning the contested \nconduct. Cf. Lyons, 461 U.S. at 106 (stating that Mr. Lyons did not have standing in part because \nhe failed to show that the City ordered or authorized the LAPD to place him in a chokehold).  \n(i)  Written Policies or Practices \nFirst, CPD’s use of force directive allows for an exertion of energy to direct or control \n“resistive or aggressive behavior toward the involved personnel, other personnel, third parties, or \nproperty.” (Pl.’s Ex. 8). Use of chemical spray is a Level 2 use of force, and striking, punching, or \nkicking is a Level 4. (Id.).  \nSecond, and relatedly, CPD’s Amended Directive 2.04 (“Amended Directive”) revised \ndepartmental policies on the use of chemical irritants on non-aggressive protestors. (Defs.’ Ex. 44 \nat 4). Chemical spray may be used to gain control of “a physically aggressive/resistive subject, to \nprevent escape, or to prevent or stop the commission of a criminal offense.” (Pl.’s Ex. 9 at 1). But \n  51\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 52 of 88  PAGEID #: 5722\n“it should be directed at the persons participating in the violent or aggressive conduct, not at the \ngroup in general.” (Id.). Importantly, the Amended Directive states: “Failure to leave a street or \nmove, by itself, shall not justify the use of chemical spray against a non-aggressive[,] non-violent \ncrowd.” (Id. at 5). Indicia of violence or aggression include: (1) stopping or impeding the \nmovement of individuals not engaged in the protest; (2) trapping an occupied vehicle; or (3) \nimpeding emergency personnel.  \nThe Amended Directive contains a large carveout: “Sworn personnel may use chemical \nirritants to clear a congregation of people from a controlled-access highway or to prevent a \ncongregation of people from entering a controlled-access highway,” which, as statutorily defined, \nrefers to “every street or highway.”47 (Id.).  \n(ii)  Encouragement or Authorization \nIn addition to these written policies, Plaintiffs also point to a host of orders given from \nCPD senior personnel during last year’s protests as evidence of a policy, practice, or functional \nequivalent. The hearing revealed verbal orders by CPD higher-ups which point to a pattern of \npolice  behavior  applying  excessive  force  to  protestors  and  congregants  who  not  physically \nresisting, destroying property, or threatening to do so. This Court reviews two such examples. \nOn May 29, 2020, a body-worn camera video from that evening shows a CPD supervisor \ninstructing bicycle officers that “the group at Broad and High is going to move. They’re not going \nto stay there . . . We are going to move them by any means necessary⸺reasonably necessary. \nEverybody got that? Get your mace ready.” (Pl.’s Ex. 123-A). These officers ride their bicycles \ninto congregants standing on the sidewalk and spray chemical irritants at random. \n \n47 “Controlled-access highway,” statutorily defined, means “every street or highway in respect to which owners or \noccupants of abutting lands and other persons have no legal right of access to or from the same except at some points \nonly and in such manner as may be determined by the public authority having jurisdiction over such street or highway.” \nO.R.C. § 4511.01(CC). \n  52\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 53 of 88  PAGEID #: 5723\nSimilarly, recall that the Father’s Day Demonstration on June 21, 2020, occurred after the \nAmended Directive 2.04 in the use of chemical irritants became operative. Commander Weir \ninstructed officers to “clear High Street” of protestors. One video shows officers push, shove, and \nspray protestors standing in the street. A separate video shows an officer indiscriminately spraying \ncongregants, including some standing on fleeing toward the sidewalk. (Pl.’s Ex. 106). \nUnlike in the Sixth Circuit’s review of the voting-law cases where it found the training of \nelection staff to be adequate, here, there are questions of the adequacy of CPD training on the \ndefinition of when a crowd or individuals  are “violent,” “aggressive,” and “resistive.” \nDeputy Chief Kuebler admitted the vagueness: \nQ. Is there something in the division’s policies that explains what it means for protestors \nwho are in the street to be aggressive? \n \nA. That remains very unclear to us in the division. \n \n(Kuebler 148:15—19). This definitional gap is important since an officer is permitted only to use \nchemical spray, for example, against a violent, aggressive, or resistive individual. \nIn addition, neither the Directives nor the  training relating to the use of wood projectiles \nand the use of bicycles to shove protestors has been amended at all. Under existing guidelines, \nCPD can order demonstrators to “clear the area,” and officers can treat that order as encompassing \nsidewalks as well as streets and use their discretion as to whether protestors are leaving fast \nenough. \nPlaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the officers’ use of force on protestors and passersby \nat last year’s protest was conducted pursuant to a formal policy or its functional equivalent, regular \nand routine practice, and even encouragement. Cf. Lyons, 461 U.S. at 110 n.9 (“The dissent does \nnot . . . point to any written or oral pronouncement by the LAPD or any evidence showing a pattern \n  53\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 54 of 88  PAGEID #: 5724\nof police behavior that would indicate that the official policy would permit the application of \n[chokeholds on suspects who refrained from engaging in unlawful conduct].”). \nBased on the written policies and the verbal commands, this Court finds that Plaintiffs’ \nallegations of unlawful police conduct are premised upon unlawful policies and practices, since \nthe use of force policy and Amended Directive 2.04 still allow for the repeated and indiscriminate \nuse of chemical spray, wooden projectiles, and physical force on large swaths of people—not just \non those involved in violence or aggression. \nb.  Future Harm \n“Despite being harmed in the past, the [plaintiffs] must still show that the threat of injury \nin the future is ‘certainly impending’ or that it presents a ‘substantial risk’ of recurrence for the \ncourt to hear their claim for prospective relief.” Clapper, 568 U.S. at 414 n.5. \nPlaintiffs have alleged that the unreasonable deployment of less-lethal force is likely to be \nre-deployed in the future. Conversely, Defendants, relying on Lyons, argue that Plaintiffs cannot \nestablish standing by presenting evidence that CPD used the alleged policies against them in the \npast. Several Plaintiffs and witnesses declared their intention to attend future demonstrators \nrelating to police reform and the treatment of police brutality. Their fear that they will be subjected \nto an allegedly illegal action is more than subjective. \nThis is not Lyons, where a future risk was found to arise from an isolated incident of abuse. \nRather, Plaintiffs introduced evidence of the Defendants’ ongoing, sustained pattern of conduct \nthat resulted in numerous injuries to protestors and congregants. “[T]he possibility of recurring \ninjury ceases to be speculative when actual repeated incidents are documented.” Thomas v. Cnty. \nof Los Angeles, 978 F.2d 504, 507 (9th Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n  54\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 55 of 88  PAGEID #: 5725\nMs. Pagels, a witness who attended most days of the protest, observed repeated instances \nof excessive force: “Under a wide range of circumstances[,] I saw them use chemical weapons, \nbicycles, fists, flashbangs on people on sidewalks, on streets, in groups, alone.” (ECF No. 49 at 5). \nThe most common less-lethal dispersal technique she observed was pepper spray, followed by \nknee-knockers. And then more increasingly, “throughout the summer[,] I saw [officers’] bicycles \nbeing used as weapons.” (ECF No. 49 at 5). \nIn other words, CPD’s use of less-lethal force on non-aggressive individuals is not, to \nborrow the Sixth Circuit’s terminology, “vanishingly rare.” Hearring v. Sliwowski, 806 F.3d 864, \n868 (6th Cir. 2015) (reviewing Lyons). And as the Supreme Court said in Lyons: “It is the reality of \nthe threat of repeated injury that is relevant to the standing inquiry, not the plaintiff's subjective \napprehensions.” Lyons, 461 U.S. at 107 n.8. An encounter with CPD at a demonstration, and thus \nwith CPD policies, is likely to occur much more frequently than the speculation Mr. Lyons bore. \nThus, Plaintiffs have standing to seek injunctive relief.  Thus, Plaintiffs have satisfied the injury-\nin-fact requirement. See Samaha v. City of Minneapolis, No. 20-cv-01715, 2021 WL 931243, at \n*8 (D. Minn. Mar. 11, 2021) (“Plaintiffs are not required to divine the date when the next \ncontroversy will spark widespread outrage in this community. The Court finds that Plaintiffs \nhave standing.”).  \n2.  Causation and Redressability \nIn addition to the injury-in-fact requirement, a plaintiff must also satisfy the causation and \nredressability requirements of standing. Plaintiffs have established causation because the alleged \nexcessive force and retaliation is fairly traceable to the City’s actions. Under the redressability \nrequirement, a plaintiff must show a likelihood that the requested relief will redress the alleged \ninjury. Plaintiffs seek an injunction restraining CPD’s use of less-lethal force on nonviolent \n  55\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 56 of 88  PAGEID #: 5726\nprotesters  to  enforce  dispersal  orders.  This  requested  relief  is  directly  tied  to  the  injuries \nPlaintiffs—all nonviolent protestors, observers, and passersby sustained last summer. \nThus, this Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated a concrete past injury of being \nsubjected to less-lethal force, pursuant to CPD’s policies and procedures and that the specter of \nrepetition is concrete and non-speculative. A favorable decision would redress these concerns. \nC.  Mootness \nDefendants further assert that Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction is moot because \nthey did not seek injunctive relief back in May or June of 2020 when the alleged unconstitutional \nconduct occurred. (ECF No. 61-1 at 10).  In the months that have followed the protests, Defendants \ncontend that much of Plaintiffs’ claim for injunctive relief has become moot due to changes the \nCity has made to CPD Directives and the City Code. (Id.).  \n“In addition to requiring that a party have standing, the Constitution’s case or controversy \nrequirement mandates that a claim must not become moot prior to the court’s decision on the \nmerits.” Speech First, Inc. v. Schlissel, 939 F.3d 756, 767 (6th Cir. 2019). A case becomes moot \nwhen either the “issues presented are no longer ‘live’ or the parties lack a legally cognizable \ninterest in the outcome.” Id. (internal citations omitted). To determine mootness, “the question is \nnot whether the precise relief sought at the time the application for an injunction was filed is still \navailable. The question is whether there can be any effective relief.” Nw. Envtl. Def. Ctr. v. \nGordon, 849 F.2d 1241, 1244—45 (9th Cir. 1988). If a course of action is mostly completed, but \nmodifications can be made that could alleviate the harm suffered by the plaintiff’s injury, the issue \nis not moot. Tyler v. Cuomo, 236 F.3d 1124, 1137 (9th Cir. 2000). A case becomes moot “only \nwhen  it  is  impossible  for  a  court  to  grant  any  effectual  relief  whatever  to  the  prevailing \nparty.” Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, 172 (2013) (quotation marks omitted). The party alleging \n  56\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 57 of 88  PAGEID #: 5727\nmootness bears a “heavy burden” to establish that a court can provide no effective relief. Karuk \nTribe of Cal. v. U.S. Forest Serv., 681 F.3d 1006, 1017 (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting Forest Guardians \nv. Johanns, 450 F.3d 455, 461 (9th Cir. 2006)). \nBelow,  this  Court  reviews  two  mootness  doctrines:  (1)  the  capable  of  repetition \nyet evading review doctrine; and (2) the voluntary cessation doctrine. Both are often referred to  \nas “exceptions” to the mootness doctrine. See Boston Teachers Union, Local 66, AFT, AFL-CIO \nv. Edgar, 787 F.2d 12, 16 (6th Cir.1986) (referring to the voluntary cessation doctrine as an \nexception to the mootness doctrine); see also Gottfried v. Medical Planning Servs., Inc., 280 F.3d \n684, 693 (6th Cir. 2002)) (referring to the capable of repetition yet evading review doctrine as an \nexception to the mootness doctrine). \n1.  Capable of Repetition Yet Evading Review \nThe capable of repetition, yet evading review exception to the mootness doctrine applies \nwhere: “(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation \nor expiration and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be \nsubject to the same action again.” Coal. for Gov't Procurement v. Fed. Prison Indus., Inc., 365 \nF.3d 435, 470, 473 (6th Cir. 2004) (quoting Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 17 (1998)).The \nSupreme Court has further stated that it has been “unwilling to assume that the party seeking relief \nwill repeat the type of misconduct that would once again place him or her at risk of that \ninjury.” Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 320, (1988) (citing Lyons, 461 U.S. at 105–06).  \nThis Court finds that there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining parties, \nPlaintiffs, would be subject to the same action again. Ms. Pagels, a witness who attended most \ndays of the protest, observed repeated instances of less-lethal force deployed on non-violent \ncongregants: “Under a wide range of circumstances[,] I saw them use chemical weapons, bicycles, \n  57\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 58 of 88  PAGEID #: 5728\nfists, flashbangs on people on sidewalks, on streets, in groups, alone.” (ECF No. 49 at 5). As long \npolice killings are met with public outrage and protest—and as long as CPD relies upon less-lethal \nforce to disperse non-violent congregants—there remains a reasonable likelihood that Plaintiffs \nwill face the same challenged conduct again.48    \n2.  Voluntary Cessation Doctrine \nFurther,  voluntary  cessation  of  conduct  moots  a  claim  only  in  limited  and  narrow \ncircumstances. As explained by the Supreme Court: \nThe test for mootness in cases such as this is a stringent one. Mere voluntary cessation of \nallegedly illegal conduct does not moot a case; if it did, the courts would be compelled to \nleave the defendant free to return to his old ways. A case might become moot if subsequent \nevents made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably \nbe expected to recur. Of course[,] it is still open to appellees to show, on remand, that the \nlikelihood  of  further  violations  is  sufficiently  remote  to  make  injunctive  relief \nunnecessary. This is a matter for the trial judge. But this case is not technically moot, an \nappeal has been properly taken, and we have no choice but to decide it. \n \nCity of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289 n.10 (1982) (simplified).49 \n \nDefendants contend that because Plaintiffs did not seek injunctive relief back in June when \nthe alleged unconstitutional conduct occurred, much of their claim for injunctive relief has become \nmoot. (ECF No. 10 at 12).  Further, in the six months that followed the protests, CPD amended its \ndirectives with respect to the use of chemical irritants to (according to Mayor Ginther) facilitate \nbetter trust and relations with the community. Consequently, Defendants argue that this voluntary \nchange in enforcement tactics moot Plaintiffs’ claims as well. \n \n48 Eric Lagatta, Protests Continue Sunday in Downtown Columbus for Ma’Khia Bryant, Others Killed by Police, \nColumbus Dispatch (Apr. 25, 2021), https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2021/04/25/protests-continue-sunday-\ncolumbus-makhia-bryant/7377610002. \n49 See Brownback v. King 141 S. Ct. 740, 748 (2021) (using a “cleaned up” parenthetical).  \n  58\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 59 of 88  PAGEID #: 5729\nThis mootness argument fails. Even acknowledging that the department amended its \ndirectives, much of Plaintiffs’ Complaint centers on not just the department’s written policies but \nalso how those policies are implemented in practice. \nThus, there is a live issue of whether Defendants have a policy, practice, or custom of using \nexcessive force and retaliatory infliction of pain on peaceful protestors. \nD.  Factors for Preliminary-Injunctive Relief \n1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nPlaintiffs argue that Defendants use of non-lethal, or less-lethal, crowd-control tactics \nviolate their Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force and their First Amendment \nright to protest without retaliation. Plaintiffs also allege that the Defendants are liable for violations \nof  Plaintiffs’  constitutional  rights  under  a  theory  of  municipal  liability,  under Monell  v. \nDepartment of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978). \na.  The Fourth Amendment (Excessive Force) \nPlaintiffs contend that they have a strong likelihood of success on their claim that CPD’s \nuse of excessive force was violative of the Fourth Amendment. (ECF No. 6 at 23). Defendants \nretort CPD’s use of force did not constitute a seizure because the protestors were free to leave—\nin fact, they were ordered to do so, thereby demonstrating that Plaintiffs cannot succeed on their \nFourth Amendment claims and must rely instead upon the substantive Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment. This Court reviews these arguments below. First, it considers whether a \nseizure has occurred under the Fourth Amendment. After determining that it has, this Court \nanalyzes the reasonableness of force applied. \n \n \n  59\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 60 of 88  PAGEID #: 5730\n(1) Seizure \nViolation  of  the Fourth Amendment requires  an  intentional  acquisition  of  physical \ncontrol. Brower v. Cnty. of Inyo, 489 U.S. 593, 596 (1989). Thus, the threshold question this Court \nmust resolve is: Has there been a seizure? The arrest of a suspect indisputably constitutes a seizure. \nCircumstances falling short of an arrest also might constitute a seizure, where an “officer, by means \nof physical force or show of authority, terminates or restrains [someone’s] freedom by movement \nthrough means intentionally applied.” Brendlin v. California, 551 U.S. 249, 254—55 (2007) \n(internal citations omitted). Such a seizure occurs “only when there is a governmental termination \nof  freedom  of  movement  through  means  intentionally  applied.” Brower, 489  U.S.  at \n597 (emphasis omitted). \nAt the outset, this Court notes that Defendants’ reliance on Torres v. Madrid, 141 S. Ct. \n989, 991 (2021), is misplaced. In that case, the issue was whether the application of physical force \nis a seizure if the force hits the targeted individual but fails to stop the person. Id. at 995. The \nSupreme Court said yes: “The application of physical force to the body of a person with the intent \nto restrain is a seizure, even if the force does not succeed in subduing the person.” Id. at 993. \nDefendants attempt to draw from this case a different principle—namely, that no seizure ever \noccurs unless an officer manifests an intent to restrain the subject. (ECF No. 61-1 at 14; ECF No. \n64 at 2 n.2). But this is not what the Supreme Court held. Chief Justice Roberts even said as much: \nThis approach improperly erases the distinction between seizures by control and seizures \nby force. In all fairness, we too have not always been attentive to this distinction when a \ncase did not implicate the issue . . . But each type of seizure enjoys a separate common law \npedigree that gives rise to a separate rule . . . Unlike a seizure by force, a seizure by \nacquisition of control involves either a voluntary submission to a show of authority or the \ntermination of movement. \n \nId. at 1001. Accordingly, the Court held in Torres that a woman was seized when officers shot her, \ndespite her failure to yield to that force, as it amounted to a seizure by force given the officers’ \n  60\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 61 of 88  PAGEID #: 5731\nintent to restrain. Defendants ignore this distinction and instead argue that any circumstance \nlacking an intent to restrain falls outside the ambit of the Fourth Amendment entirely.50 That \nmisreads Torres and aggressively narrows Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.  \nThis case deals with both seizures by force and seizures by control. Defendants do not deny \nthat Plaintiff Hazlett and Plaintiff Lynch were seized (by force) when they were arrested. An arrest, \nof course, is the quintessential seizure.  \nThe rub here is whether other circumstances (falling short of an arrest) amounted to a \nseizure by the acquisition of control. \nA constitutionally cognizable seizure can occur in crowd-control scenarios. Nelson v. City \nof Davis is instructive. 685 F.3d 867, 872 (9th Cir. 2012). There, a partygoing college student was \nshot in the eye by a pepper ball projectile fired from the weapon of a university officer attempting \nto clear an apartment complex of 1,000 partygoers. Such a large gathering created crowd-control \ndifficulties and gridlock. Id. (recalling a partygoer described the event as “the biggest party in \nhistory”). The Nelson defendants issued a verbal order to disperse but lacked any means of \namplifying  their  voices  to  a  meaningful  level.  As  their  crowd-dispersal  strategies  proved \nunsuccessful,  the  officers  found  themselves  overwhelmed  by  the  crowd,  including  some \nindividuals who threw bottles at a police vehicle. Some partygoers were attempting to leave the \nparty, but police blocked their means of egress and did not provide any additional instructions on \nhow to leave; the partygoers also raised their hands to show their willingness to comply. There \nwas no audible warning or notice prior to shooting projectiles towards the partyers.  \n \n50 Because of the facts presented here, this Court hesitates to ignore the Torres Court’s language: “We do not accept \nthe dissent’s invitation to opine on matters not presented here—pepper spray, flash-bang grenades, lasers, and more.” \nId. at 998. \n  61\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 62 of 88  PAGEID #: 5732\nWhether a constitutionally cognizable seizure by control can occur in protest scenarios is \na murkier landscape. The question before this Court is: Was there a seizure by control when the \npolice used less-lethal force, including pepper spray, tear gas, and physical force, to disperse—\nrather than detain—activists, protestors, and congregants? Some courts answer this question in the \naffirmative51 and others in the negative.52 Others do not answer it at all and instead assume the \nFourth Amendment applies.53 But there is a body of authority suggesting that the use of a chemical \nagent or other less-lethal crowd control tactics over a demonstrating crowd constitutes a seizure \nwithin the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. This Court finds three cases persuasive. \nPredating the Floyd Caselaw are two instructive cases: Marbet v. City of Portland, No. CV \n02-1448-HA, 2003 WL 23540258, at *10 (D. Or. Sept. 8, 2003), and Jennings v. City of Miami, \nNo. 07-23008-CIV, 2009 WL 413110, at *8 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 27, 2009). Within the Floyd Caselaw, \nDownes-Covington v. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, No. 220CV01790, 2020 WL \n7408725, at *10 (D. Nev., Dec. 17, 2020) is useful. As analyzed below, in the cases, the courts \nconsidered similar facts and reasoned that officers’ use of chemical irritants and physical force \ncould amount to a constitutionally redressable seizure. \nFirst,  the  District  Court  of  Oregon  in  Marbet  reviewed  officers’  use  of  force  on \ndemonstrators protesting the policies of President George W. Bush while the president spoke at a \n \n51 Lamb v. City of Decatur, 947 F. Supp. 1261, 1267 (C.D. Ill. 1996) (concluding that the officers’ use of pepper spray \non protestors could support a finding of excessive force that constitutes a seizure); Marbet v. City of Portland, No. \nCV 02–1448–HA, 2003 WL 23540258, at *10  (“By physically moving certain plaintiffs and circumscribing the area \nof movement of other plaintiffs, defendants seized plaintiffs within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.”); \nJennings v. City of Miami, No. 07-23008-CIV, 2009 WL 413110, at *8 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 27, 2009); Coles v. City of \nOakland, No. C03-2961 TEH, 2005 WL 8177790, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 27, 2005). \n52 Dundon v. Kirchmeier, No. 1:16-cv-406, 2017 WL 5894552, at *20 (D.N.D. Feb. 7, 2017), aff’d mem. 701 F. App’x \n538 (8th Cir.) (per curiam) (speculating no seizure occurred because the protestors were never arrested or affirmatively \ndetained by the police). \n53 Quraishi v. St. Charles Cnty., Missouri, 986 F.3d 831, 840 (8th Cir. 2021) (“This court did not consider whether \nthe use of chemical agents alone is a seizure.”); Ellsworth v. City of Lansing, 34 F. Supp. 2d 571 (W.D. Mich. \n1998), aff’d, 205 F.3d 1340 (2000); Edrei v. City of New York, 254 F. Supp. 3d 565, 574 (S.D.N.Y. 2017), aff’d sub \nnom. Edrei v. Maguire, 892 F.3d 525 (2d Cir. 2018). \n  62\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 63 of 88  PAGEID #: 5733\nhotel in downtown Portland. Marbet, 2003 WL 23540258, at *10. The Portland Police Bureau \nused a loudspeaker to order protestors to move back 120 feet; plaintiffs and protestors allegedly \nignored several orders to move, prompting officers to deploy pepper spray and move the crowd \nwith force. Officers later fired rubber bullets at the demonstrators. In denying the motion to \ndismiss, the court reasoned that officers’ show of physical force and use of pepper spray each \namounted to a seizure: \nDefendants used pepper spray and physical force to achieve [the dispersal order]. Clearly[,] \nthe effect of defendants’ actions was to control plaintiffs’ movement. Additionally, certain \nplaintiffs assert that they were physically prevented from leaving an area cordoned off by \nthe  police.  By  physically  moving  certain  plaintiffs  and  circumscribing  the  area  of \nmovement of other plaintiffs, defendants seized plaintiffs within the meaning of the Fourth \nAmendment.   \n \nId. at 10. Thus, it found dispositive that officers acted intentionally to restrain plaintiffs’ freedom \nof movement. The Marbet court relied upon Lamb v. City of Decatur, 947 F. Supp. 1261, 1265 \n(C.D. Ill. 1996), which reviewed the City of Decatur’s motion for summary judgment in an action \narising  out  of  a  demonstration,  where  officers  sprayed  pepper  spray  into  the  crowd  of \ndemonstrators. Lamb, 947 F. Supp. at 1265 (“This is not a typical excessive force case where the \npolice were struggling with a fleeing felon or a rebellious prisoner. Instead, the police were \nmonitoring  a  peaceful,  lawful[,]  and  constitutionally  protected  demonstration.”).  It  denied \nsummary judgment, reasoning that the complaint alleged facts that could support a finding of \nexcessive force that constituted a seizure under the Fourth Amendment.  \nSecond, in Jennings, the Southern District of Florida found that plaintiffs sufficiently \nalleged that a seizure occurred where protestors alleged that they were peacefully observing, \nfilming, or protesting when police opened fire on the demonstrators with tear gas, pepper spray, \n  63\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 64 of 88  PAGEID #: 5734\nshotgun-based projectiles, and other weapons.54 Jennings, 2009 WL 413110, at *7. The police \nofficers  began  marching  shoulder-to-shoulder,  continuing  to  fire  projectiles  at  the  peaceful \ndemonstrators and observers. The court found a seizure occurred because officers’ tactic as \n“herding,” creating “a large encirclement perimeter,” and used riot-clad officers to form “a \nskirmish line to force the demonstrators in a desired direction” evinced an intentional government \ntermination of protestors’ freedom of movement. Id. \n  Third, in accord with Jennings is a recent Floyd Caselaw action, Downes-Covington, where \nthe District of Nevada reviewed a suit similar to the one presented here: demonstrators sought \ninjunctive relief after being subjected to less-lethal force while protesting in the wake of Mr. \nFloyd’s death. A video documenting the event showed protestors retreating from a tank, which \nwas flanked by two officers. Despite a dispersal order, some demonstrators were blocked: “[T]hey \ncould not go forward over the freeway and could not go backward because police were blocking \nthem.” Downes-Covington, 2020 WL 7408725, at *9. Protestors, in the video, are seen retreating \naway from the Interstate-15 on-ramp, mostly walking on the sidewalk, although due to the size of \nthe crowd, some trickle onto the street where other officers are stationed. Id. While retreating, \nofficers by the tank are seen firing some chemical irritant. The court found a cognizable seizure \nbecause the use of a tank corralling the protestors away from the on-ramp, while two or more \nofficers blocked the street, suggested that protestors were seized. Id. \n \n54 The Jennings court relied on Coles. Coles v. City of Oakland, No. C03-2961 TEH, 2005 WL 8177790, at *2 (N.D. \nCal. Apr. 27, 2005). In Coles, the plaintiffs were demonstrators, legal observers, videographers, journalists, and \ndockworkers who were protesting the Iraq war. The Coles plaintiffs alleged that police officers fired projectiles into \nthe crowd, charged the plaintiffs with motorcycles, and hit the plaintiffs with clubs. Id. They also alleged that the \npolice  herded  them  from  the  port  area  to  the  West  Oakland  BART  station,  a  distance  of  more  than  a \nmile. Id. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claims, arguing that plaintiffs had not \nalleged a seizure. Id. at *4. The Coles court, relying in part on Marbet, found that plaintiffs had in fact been seized \nand noted that Defendants did more than just order the plaintiffs to disperse but “left Plaintiffs with only one available \npath by which to leave the scene and applied physical force to ensure that Plaintiffs followed that path.” Id. at *10. \n  64\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 65 of 88  PAGEID #: 5735\nThus, a constitutionally redressable seizure can occur where officers use physical force to \nprevent protestors from coming any closer, such as by herding protestors, forming a skirmish line, \nor failing to provide a means of egress—where such governmental action is intentional and results \nin the termination of freedom of movement. Jennings, 2009 WL 413110, at *9 (finding a seizure \nwhere officers clad in riot gear aligned in a skirmish line to force demonstrators in the desired \ndirection through the use of excessive force); see also Rauen v. City of Miami, No. 06-21182-CIV, \n2007 WL 686609, at *8 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 2, 2007) (“Plaintiffs’ freedom of movement was terminated \nby the deliberate use of force and skirmish lines to herd and then encircle Plaintiffs in an area in \nwhich they otherwise would not have been.”). \nThis  Court  now  asks  whether  the  type  of  force  used—chemical  agents,  less-lethal \nprojectiles such as wooden knockers, and physical force—militates in favor of finding that a \nseizure occurred. The dispositive question is one of control: Did the police control Plaintiffs’ and \nprotestors’ movement through the use of force intentionally applied? See Florida v. Bostick, 501 \nU.S. 429, 435–36 (1991) (determining whether a seizure has occurred implicates the “coercive \neffect of the encounter” with police). Relevant factors that weigh in favor of a finding of a seizure \nof a person include the officer’s tone of voice, whether the officer displayed a weapon or handcuffs, \nwore a uniform, touched the individual without permission, or threatened or physically intimidated \nhim. Id. \nPlaintiffs allege that throughout last summer’s protests, they were peacefully observing, \nproviding medical aid, or protesting when Defendants, often clad in riot gear, exercised an \nindiscriminate use of chemical irritants, physical force, and other weapons. Given that the standard \nfor injunctive relief is a likelihood of success, the Court finds that the evidence and testimony from \n  65\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 66 of 88  PAGEID #: 5736\nlast year’s protests—explored summarily—suggest that Plaintiffs have met their burden as to the \nelements of a Fourth Amendment claim.  \nHere, some protestors were subject to physical force and less-lethal projectiles without a \nmeans of escape or egress, as Ms. Carlock’s testimony shows. She and other protestors complied \nwith orders to leave the street for the sidewalk. Once they got up on the sidewalk, Ms. Carlock \nrecalled being “herded” by horse-mounted officers who “started pushing into the crowd.” (ECF \nNo. 49 at 198). The protestors—again, now on the sidewalk—asked: “[W]hat do you want us to \ndo, what are you doing, where are we allowed to go, like, where should we stand . . . And there \nwas no response that we got from them.” (Id.). Towards Fifth Street, there were non-mounted \npolice officers blocking the cross street and the mounted officers on the other side. (Id. at 198–99). \nThe group of fifteen protestors was “pinned . . . into that small area.” (Id. at 199). Officers threw \na tear gas canister toward the protestors on the sidewalk. (Id. at 199 (“And it was almost impossible \nto get out of that spot we were in.”)). The group ran into an alley that had mostly been blocked off \nby a delivery truck, permitting just one person at a time to squeeze between the alley wall and the \ntruck.  Ms. Wenning’s testimony is of similar legal import. She recalled walking away in an alley \nafter hearing a dispersal order. (ECF No. 47 at 157 (“I was walking away, so I felt I was leaving \nthe area.”)). Yet, a tear gas canister was thrown into the alley into which she dispersed. \nThese circumstances are on all fours with Nelson—where officers deploy force and order \ndispersal but without a means of egress. Such restraint on movement amounts to a seizure. Nelson, \n685 F.3d at 882–83 (“Additionally, there is nothing in the record that indicates that the group was \ntold prior to the shooting how they should comply with the dispersal orders (particularly when the \nofficers were blocking their primary means of egress) or that force would be used against them if \nthey did not behave in a particular manner.”). \n  66\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 67 of 88  PAGEID #: 5737\nCPD’s  show  of  force  during  the  Father’s  Day  Demonstration  resulted  in  a  similar \ntermination of freedom. Mr. Bardus testified: \nSo[,] they showed up on their bikes[,] and they shoved folks out of the street toward the \nsidewalk. They turned their bikes sideways and basically pushed people. I remember one \nprotest[o]r, a woman, fell in the street, and the officer continued to push her with his bike \nwhile she was on the ground. Several officers continued to hamper their efforts by shoving \nthem with their bikes. \n \n(ECF No. 50 at 66). Ms. Ruffin testified similarly, stating that bicycle officers came to “push and \nphysically move us to the side to allow more officers to come in.” (ECF No. 46 at 110–11). \nA body-worn camera video shows a CPD supervisor instructing officers that “the group at \nBroad and High is going to move. They’re not going to stay there . . . Tell them to move . . . We \nare going to move them by any means necessary – reasonably necessary. Everybody got that? Get \nyour mace ready.” (Pl.’s Ex. 123-A). Moments later, these same officers, now mounted on bikes, \nride into individuals standing on the sidewalk, spraying chemical irritants broadly, without \nprovocation. (Pl.’s Exs. 123-A, 123-B). \nUnfortunately, this use of bicycles was not the only way CPD exerted physical force. Recall \nthat Ms. Mixon testified as follows: “And one of the officers pushed me down so hard off the curb \n. . . he stomped on my kneecap.” (ECF No. 47 at 74–75).  \nIt is not fatal to the sufficiency of the Fourth Amendment claim that Plaintiffs were not \ncompletely immobilized by CPD’s use of force. Rather, what is required is that a person’s freedom \nof movement had been terminated, not that the person’s movement itself had been terminated. \nYelverton v. Vargo, 386 F. Supp. 2d 1224 (M.D. Ala. 2005) (“[Defendant’s] pepper[-]spraying of \n[Plaintiff] constituted a seizure even though it did not stop him.”). Even if a “citizen is able to walk \nor hobble away,” a seizure still lies, so long as there was an intentional application of physical \nforce. Jennings, 2009 WL 413110, at *7. The impact that chemical irritants and less-lethal \n  67\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 68 of 88  PAGEID #: 5738\nprojectiles, such as tear gas, pepper spray, and knee knockers had on the congregants also support \nPlaintiffs’ argument that they were seized. Young v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 655 F.3d 1156, 1163 \n(9th Cir. 2011) (explaining that pepper spray is “‘intermediate force’ that, while less severe than \ndeadly force, nonetheless present[s] a significant intrusion upon an individual’s liberty interests”). \nAccordingly, even absent an arrest, the use of chemical spray and less-lethal projectiles can \namount to is a cognizable restraint under the Fourth Amendment where the “clear[]” effect of \nofficers’ use of pepper spray “was to control plaintiffs’ movement.” Marbet, 2003 WL 23540258, \nat *10; see also Hamilton v. City of Olympia, 687 F. Supp. 2d 1231, 1241 (W.D. Wash. 2009) \n(“[H]is freedom of movement was terminated in both instances after he was sprayed with pepper \nspray.”). Here, the impact of the pepper spray often literally rendered the protestor unable to move \nfreely. And the evidence establishes much more than a minimal intrusion on the protestors’ bodily \nintegrity; many of the protestors suffered disorientation or were otherwise physically impacted. \n(ECF No. 47 at 114 (recalling that sprayed protestors hit the ground and were screaming); Pl.’s \nEx. 113 (showing a pepper-sprayed individual crawling away)). \nProjectiles like knee knockers also denied protestors of their movement. Plaintiff Hubby \nwas standing on the sidewalk when, without audible warning, he was hit with a wooden munition. \nHis knee went numb, and he was unable to stand independently, prompting about a dozen \ndemonstrators to fashion a rental bicycle into a gurney to transport Mr. Hubby. (ECF No. 48 at \n234). Plaintiff Schultz was also hit with a knee knocker, which brought her to the ground. (ECF \nNo. 49 at 127). She recalled: “I was struck with something so hard that it brought me to the ground. \nI went to get back up and I couldn’t . . . I went to take a step with my right leg[,] and it just dropped \nfrom underneath me. It was kind of like dead-legged . . . Every time I tried to get up, I would fall \nback down.” (Id. at 127–28). A friend swung Ms. Schultz’s right arm over her shoulder and helped \n  68\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 69 of 88  PAGEID #: 5739\ntransport her to an alleyway. (Id.; see also ECF No. 49 at 28 (recalling “ducking,” “dodging” \nofficers shooting projectiles at them while complying with a dispersal order)). \nThis Court finds that Plaintiffs’ allegations are sufficient to set forth a likelihood of success \non  the  merits  that  the  deployment  of  less-lethal  munitions  constituted  physical  force  that \ntemporarily restrained the protestors. See Pluma v. City of New York, No. 13 CIV. 2017 LAP, 2015 \nWL 1623828, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2015) (same). The intentionality requirement of the Fourth \nAmendment seizure analysis is fulfilled since there is no dispute that the protestors were the target \nof  police  conduct  when  the  officers  held  out  their  hands  and  sprayed  the  protestors \nindiscriminately. Ciminillo v. Streicher, 434 F.3d 461, 466 (6th Cir. 2006) (quoting Fisher v. City \nof Memphis, 234 F.3d 312, 318 (6th Cir. 2000)) (“[W]e emphasized that police officers seize those \npersons who are the ‘deliberate object of their exertion of force.’”). Regardless of officers’ \nmotives, their application of force terminated the protestors’ freedom of movement and constituted \na seizure under the Fourth Amendment. \n(2) Reasonableness of Force \nA  seizure  results  in  a  constitutional  violation  only  if  it  is  unreasonable. Graham  v. \nConnor, 490 U.S. 386, 394 (1989). The reasonableness of a particular use of force should be \njudged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene—not with the benefit of hindsight. \nGraham, 490 U.S. at 396. In addition, the Sixth Circuit has determined that a police officer may \nbe responsible for another officer’s use of excessive force if the officer: (1) actively participated \nin the use of excessive force; (2) supervised the officer who used excessive force; or (3) owed the \nvictim a duty of protection against the use of excessive force. Bletz v. Gribble, 641 F.3d 743, 754 \n(6th Cir. 2011). \n  69\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 70 of 88  PAGEID #: 5740\nThe objective reasonableness of a seizure depends upon a balancing of “the nature and \nquality of the intrusion on the individual’s Fourth Amendment interests against the importance of \nthe governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.” Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 8 \n(1985)) (quoting United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 703 (1983)).55 \nThree factors must be used in determining the degree of force employed: (1) the nature or \n“severity” of the crime for which the suspect is charged; (2) whether the suspect poses any threat \nto the officers or others; and (3) whether the suspect has attempted or is likely to attempt to flee \nofficers or to resist arrest. Whether the officer had other means of force available is not relevant to \nthe inquiry. Lyons v. City of Xenia, 417 F.3d 565, 576 (6th Cir. 2005). The question is whether a \nreasonable officer would have known the actions used were objectively unreasonable, not that \nthere existed a less intrusive means.56 \nThe first factor, the severity of the crime at issue, weighs heavily in Plaintiffs’ favor and \nagainst the use of force employed by the officers. Testimonial, video, and pictorial evidence \nestablish that most congregants were peacefully protesting, observing, reporting, passing by, or \nproviding medical aid when they fell victim to the use of these less-lethal munitions. The protests \nwere mostly peaceful—the incident commander for CPD said as much on June 2, 2020: “99% of \nthese people are peaceful . . . whether they’re yelling stuff at you or not, that’s still peaceful there \nif they’re not threatening you.” (Pl.’s Ex. 25). Even those Plaintiffs that were committing crimes—\ne.g., failure to disperse—were committing a minor misdemeanor under O.R.C. § 2917(d). While \na legally punishable offense, failure to disperse is a minor infraction that justifies raised voices, \n \n55 Prior to Garner and Graham, most § 1983 excessive-force cases were litigated under the substantive due process \n“shocks the conscience” theory. Defendants contend that the Fourth Amendment is inapposite here and that Plaintiffs \nmust instead proceed under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n56 While courts, including the Sixth Circuit, offer considerable deference to the apparent need for officers to make \nsplit-second judgments concerning the level of force necessary, scholarly commentary has questioned how much \ndeference should be paid, particularly when the totality of the circumstances suggest there was time for thoughtful \nreflection. Ciminillo v. Streicher, 434 F.3d 461, 467 (6th Cir. 2006). \n  70\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 71 of 88  PAGEID #: 5741\nnot raised weapons. See Black Lives Matter Seattle-King Cnty. v. City of Seattle, Seattle Police \nDep’t, 466 F. Supp. 3d 1206, 1215 (W.D. Wash. 2020) (“At most, this evidence shows that \nPlaintiffs, and many protestors alike, were engaging in minor property crime and offered only \npassive resistance at the time they were attacked.”). That CPD felt the need to clear the streets \nmight be legitimate. But in the absence of an actual exigency, these traffic concerns cannot \nlegitimize the application of force when it is not otherwise justified. Nelson, 685 F.3d at 880. \nMoving to the second Graham factor, the threat analysis must be based on objective factors \nand not merely “a simple statement by an officer that he fears for his safety or the safety of others.” \nNelson, 685 F.3d at 880. In this case, the protests were not overwhelmingly dangerous scenarios \nfor officers clad in riot gear and armed with guns and other munition-deploying devices. And there \nis no allegation that these Plaintiffs engaged in any sort of destructive or harmful behavior aimed \nat the police. (Cf. Defs.’ Exs. 30—40, 56 (showing property damage but without any connection \nto the Plaintiffs or witnesses here)). “These are peaceful demonstrators, journalists, and medics \nwho  have  been  targeted  with  extreme  tactics  meant  to  suppress  riots,  not  to  suppress \ndemonstrations.” Abay v. City of Denver, 445 F. Supp. 3d 1286, 1292 (D. Colo. 2020). Under the \nPlaintiffs’ allegations, the security threat posed by the protest was low. On the other hand, recent \nevents in Washington, D.C., and across the nation emphasize the need for robust security, \nparticularly of governmental buildings—which, of course, tend to be the locus of First Amendment \nactivity. But the current record still presents unanswered questions as to whether the level of force \napplied was reasonable. \nThird, the factors that justify the use of force must be weighed against the degree of \nintrusion posed by the particular type of force to determine if the use in the particular instance was \nreasonable. The totality of the circumstances suggests objective unreasonableness: the disparity \n  71\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 72 of 88  PAGEID #: 5742\nbetween the threat posed by the protest and the degree of force is wide, and the Defendants have \nnot pointed to the existence of a specific exigent circumstance justifying the use of non-lethal \nforce.  There is no evidence that the officers reasonably believed that Plaintiffs posed a risk to the \nofficers or any other persons, and the group engaged in passive resistance, at most, by failing to \ndisperse immediately if and when such an order was given. \nMany of these instances of force were without provocation or applied at random and \nindiscriminately. A video from May 30 shows a CPD officer deploying chemical spray against \nindividuals who already appear to be suffering from a prior deployment of chemical spray. It shows \nofficers in riot gear spray one individual in the intersection at point-blank range, and then the same \nofficer pivots and sprays another individual in her face. (Pl.’s Ex. 112; see also Pl.’s Ex.117 (horse-\nmounted officers hurling tear gas canisters into the crowd; bicycle officers spraying chemical \nirritants at point-blank range); Pl.’s Ex.118 (same, from a different angle)). Another video shows \na SWAT officer deploying chemical spray at point-blank range against two people standing on the \nsidewalk. (Pl.’s Ex. 107). \nThere is a mountain of evidence that some protestors were confronted with less-lethal \nmunitions while trying to follow police orders to leave the demonstrations. (See, e.g., Pl.’s Ex. 137 \n(walking away while sprayed); Pl.’s Ex. 128 (spraying individuals as they walk away); Pl.’s Ex. \n147 (spraying individuals standing still or walking away); Pl.’s Ex. 101 (spraying Plaintiff Mixon \nwhile she walks on the sidewalk away from the officers); ECF No. 47 at 157 (“I was walking away, \nso I felt I was leaving the area,” before being subjected to tear gas)). See also Don’t Shoot Portland \nv. City of Portland, 465 F. Supp. 3d 1150, 1155 (D. Or. 2020) (finding a strong likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits where tear gas was used against protestors trying to follow police orders and \nleave the demonstrations). Furthermore, the video evidence of police conduct shows that most of \n  72\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 73 of 88  PAGEID #: 5743\nthe officers had ample time for reflection, often while the officers are actually talking with the to-\nbe-sprayed individual. (See Pl.’s Exs. 140-A, 140-B (ignoring journalists’ statements that they \nwere exempt from curfew); ECF No. 46 at 230 (striking a journalist with a wooden munition, \nthough he bore his press badge)). \nAlso militating strongly against a finding of reasonable force is that CPD routinely failed \nto give coherent dispersal instructions to protestors. Accordingly, Defendants’ reliance on Dundon \nv. Kirchmeier, No. 1:16-CV-406, 2017 WL 5894552, at *18 (D.N.D. Feb. 7, 2017), aff’d, 701 F. \nApp’x 538 (8th Cir. 2017) is unpersuasive. There, Plaintiffs could have complied with lawful \ncommands to disperse. Dispersal orders were either not provided or unintelligible. Witnesses \ntestified to “muffled,” “garbled,” and “not very clear” orders preceding the deployment of sprays, \nmunitions, or the exercise of physical force. (ECF No. 46 at 65; ECF No. 47 at 157; ECF No. 46 \nat 32, 37, 58).  \nOther times, the dispersal orders were given contemporaneously with the use of less-lethal \ncrowd control devices. For a dispersal order to be meaningful,  officers generally must give time \nfor a dispersal order to be heeded before the use of force. (ECF No. 48 at 219–20 (stating that, at \nany rate, that he did not hear any message)). Similarly, Ms. Lamey was struck with a knee knocker \nfour minutes after first hearing the dispersal announcement. Four minutes is not enough time for \ncongregants to comply with officers’ orders. Officers sometimes rode their horses or bikes into \ncrowds while giving a dispersal order—a constitutionally deficient dispersal order given that there \nwas little time to comply. This, too, tracks Nelson’s logic. A dispersal order given moments before \nthe exercise of force demonstrates a likelihood of success on whether there was an unreasonable \nuse of force. Nelson, 685 F.3d at 881 (noting the object of the police force “certainly could not \nhave been expected to comply with instructions that were never given to him.”). \n  73\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 74 of 88  PAGEID #: 5744\nWhile it is undisputed that there were individuals hurling both bottles and provocative \nexpletives  at  officers,  Defendants  do  not  allege  that  Plaintiffs  were  among  them.  Nor  do \nDefendants claim that the individuals causing the problems were so numerous that the two \ncategories  of  demonstrators  were  indistinguishable.  The  application  of  force  to  Plaintiffs, \ntherefore, could not have been justified by the government’s interest in stopping any disorderly \nbehavior. Nor, even if this Court were to consider all the demonstrators as a single entity, was the \ndesire to clear the area a sufficient justification for employing the force used by the government—\nthe firing of less-lethal force, resulting in this instance in serious and permanent injuries to multiple \nindividuals. This force resulted in substantially more than a minimal intrusion and was not justified \nby the governmental interest in dispersing a group of peaceful protestors and congregants who \ncould most likely be dispersed by less forceful means. \nThis Court, therefore, concludes that the force used by the government was unreasonable \nand resulted in a violation of the Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights. Defendants’ conduct—\nspecifically, the reliance on the use of less-lethal force during the protests—is so excessive as to \nconstitute a violation of constitutional rights, thus raising the specter of imposing liability under \n§ 1983. Nelson, 685 F.3d at 874. There may later be questions of qualified immunity to grapple \nwith, but Plaintiffs have established a strong likelihood of success that Defendants engaged in \nexcessive force contrary to the Fourth Amendment. Abay v. City of Denver, 445 F. Supp. 3d 1286, \n1292 (D. Colo. 2020) (finding strong a likelihood of excessive force in protestor after Mr. Floyd’s \nkilling). \nb.  First Amendment (Retaliation) \n“[T]he First Amendment safeguards an individual’s right to participate in the public debate \nthrough political expression and political association.” McCutcheon v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 572 \n  74\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 75 of 88  PAGEID #: 5745\nU.S. 185, 203 (2014). “Organized political protest is a form of ‘classically political speech.’” Don’t \nShoot Portland, 465 F. Supp. 3d at 1155 (quoting Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 318 (1988)). And \nthis protection includes criticism of public officials even when it is “vehement, caustic, and \nsometimes unpleasantly sharp.” Leonard v. Robinson, 477 F.3d 347 (6th Cir. 2007) (internal \ncitations omitted). \nTo establish a First Amendment retaliation claim, plaintiffs must show that: (1) they were \nengaged in a constitutionally protected activity; (2) the defendant’s actions would chill a person of \nordinary firmness from continuing to engage in the protected activity; and (3) the protected activity \nwas a substantial or motivating factor in the defendant’s conduct. Martin v. Brown-Clark, 76 F. \nApp'x 701, 706 (6th Cir. 2003). At this stage, Plaintiffs have made a clear showing of all three \nelements. \nFirst, Plaintiffs show that they were engaged in the constitutional right to protest police \nbrutality. They exercised their right in public fora. On this record, their protests have been \npassionate but peaceful, and they must thus be protected even if they stand in opposition to the \npolice.  The  video  and  testimonial  evidence  reveal  as  much. Both  parties  agree  that  some \ndemonstrators were violent, launching objects at the police.  This, no doubt, poses a serious threat \nto officer life and safety.  But, as to these protestors, per Collins v. Jordan, 110 F.3d 1363, 1371 \n(9th Cir. 1996): “[T]he proper response to potential and actual violence is for the government to \nensure an adequate police presence, and to arrest those who actually engage in such conduct, rather \nthan to suppress legitimate First Amendment conduct as a prophylactic measure.” 110 F.3d at \n1372. \nSecond,  CPD’s  use  of  less-lethal  crowd-control  weapons  has  surely  chilled  speech. \nExposure to tear gas and pepper spray is extremely painful, as are projectiles lobbed into the crowd, \n  75\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 76 of 88  PAGEID #: 5746\nwhich resulted in lasting and serious physical injuries. Though “less lethal,” these devices have \nbeen sufficient to deter some protestors from protesting again. “Ordinary firmness” is an objective \nstandard that will not “allow a defendant to escape liability for a First Amendment violation merely \nbecause an unusually determined plaintiff persists in his protected activity.” Mendocino Envtl. Ctr. \nv. Mendocino Cnty., 192 F.3d 1283, 1300 (9th Cir. 1999).  \nThird, Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits that the nature of \nthe protests was a substantial or motivating factor in CPD’s use of less-lethal force on nonviolent \nprotestors. CPD characterized the protests as antipolice, and division personnel echoed that \nmessage throughout the duration of the protests. Recall then-Chief Quinlan’s June 2, 2020 roll call \nspeech to officers: “And if you go one step too far one way, you end up aggravating or provoking \na situation. And with the situation when we’re the focus of the protest, we can’t afford to be the \nones that create that provocation. We just can’t . . . It’s a lot easier when they’re protesting \nsomething else.”  (Pl.’s Ex. 25 (emphasis added); Pl.’s Ex. 4 (citing Quinlan Aff. ¶ 6) (“The police \nwere the focus of the protests.”)). This attitude seeped its way into the treatment of individuals in \nthe vicinity of the protest, most notably, Plaintiff Mixon, the non-protestor who traveled downtown \nto find her 21-year-old daughter. Ms. Mixon testified that a CPD officer pushed her off of the curb, \nstomped on her left kneecap [breaking it], and stated to her: “That’s what you get for being down \nhere, you black, protesting bitch.” (ECF No. 47 at 74–75). \nThe use of force on nonviolent protestors and congregants raises a serious question if \nofficers acted in reaction to the protests’ antipolice message and aimed to intimidate protestors to \ndeter such speech. This is especially so because the allegations and evidence submitted appear to \nshow that at least some Plaintiffs—peaceful protestors or passersby—were targeted and not \ninadvertently hit.  \n  76\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 77 of 88  PAGEID #: 5747\nThis evidence supports a finding that Plaintiffs have made a showing of a likelihood of \nsuccess of the merits on their First Amendment claim.  \nc.  Municipal Liability under Monell \nLocal governments may not be sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for an injury inflicted solely \nby employees or agents under a respondeat superior theory of liability. See Monell, 436 U.S. at \n691. “Instead, it is when execution of a government’s policy or custom, whether made by its \nlawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts \nthe injury that the government as an entity is responsible under § 1983.” Id. at 694. A municipality \ncan therefore be held liable when it unconstitutionally “implements or executes a policy statement, \nordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted by that body’s officers.” Id. at 690; DePiero \nv. City of Macedonia, 180 F.3d 770, 786 (6th Cir. 1999).57 \nTo demonstrate Monell liability, one must: (1) identify the policy or custom; (2) connect \nthe policy to the governmental entity; and (3) show causality—i.e., that an injury of a constitutional \nmagnitude occurred because of that policy or custom’s execution. Alkire v. Irving, 330 F.3d 802, \n815 (6th Cir. 2003) (internal citations omitted).58 Of these, courts’ analyses hinge on the proof of \nan illegal policy or custom. There are four ways a plaintiff may prove the existence of a \nmunicipality’s illegal policy or custom: “(1) the existence of an illegal official policy or legislative \nenactment; (2) that an official with final decision-making authority ratified illegal actions; (3) the \nexistence of a policy of inadequate training or supervision; or (4) the existence of a custom of \n \n57 The term “policy” has been defined broadly as a deliberate choice to follow a course of action made from various \nalternatives by the official or officials responsible for establishing final policy with respect to the subject matter in \nquestion. Arsan v. Keller, 784 F. App’x 900, 917 (6th Cir. 2019). \n58 Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have failed to identify a policy or custom that authorizes officers to use excessive \nforce against nonviolent protestors or to retaliate against them based on their assembly and expression. (ECF No. 10 \nat 23). Defendants further argue that even if Plaintiffs could identify such a policy or custom, their claims against the \nCity would still fail because they cannot establish causation or culpability sufficient for municipal liability. \n  77\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 78 of 88  PAGEID #: 5748\ntolerance or acquiescence of federal rights violations.” Burgess v. Fischer, 735 F.3d 462, 478 (6th \nCir. 2013). Each of these four sub-prongs is addressed, in turn, below: \n(1) Illegal Official Policy or Legislative Enactment \nThe  easiest  (and  thus  rarest)  sort  of  Monell  case  is  one  where  there  is  a  written \nunconstitutional policy. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs do not identify any written policy that \ndirects or allows Columbus police officers to use excessive force of any kind or to retaliate against \nprotestors on the basis of their speech and assembly. (ECF No. 10 at 23). Plaintiffs acknowledge \nthat they do not challenge “a single, particular City or CPD policy.” (ECF No. 6 at 19). While \nPlaintiffs do cite numerous policies, which they characterize as problematic or illegal, Plaintiffs \nfocus primarily on the remaining three sub-prongs of municipal liability, and this Court follows \nsuit. \n(2) Actions by Officials with Final Decision-Making Authority & Ratification \nThe second type of Monell liability involves a showing of an illegal policy or custom by \ndemonstrating that an official with final decision-making authority ratified illegal actions. Lipman \nv. Budish, 974 F.3d 726, 747 (6th Cir. 2020). To establish a § 1983 claim against a municipality \nbased on the ratification theory, a municipal official with the final policymaking authority must \napprove the subordinate’s decision and the basis for it. Killinger v. Johnson, 389 F.3d 765, 772 \n(7th Cir. 2004). The ratification theory of municipal liability does not require proof of a pattern or \ncustom. Wilson v. Louisville-Jefferson Cnty. Metro Gov’t & Brett Hankison, No. 3:19-CV-00739-\nCRS, 2020 WL 981717, at *2, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34437, at *4–6 (W.D. Ky. Feb. 26, 2020). \nInstead, ratification of a single violative act is enough for municipal liability to attach. Pembaur v. \nCity of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 480 (1986). An official acting with the final decision-making \nauthority may ratify the unconstitutional acts of its employees in two ways. The first is through \n  78\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 79 of 88  PAGEID #: 5749\n“affirmative approval of a particular decision made by a subordinate.” Feliciano v. City of \nCleveland, 988 F.2d 649, 650 (6th Cir. 1993). The second is by “failing to meaningfully investigate \nand punish allegations of unconstitutional conduct.” Wright v. City of Euclid, 962 F.3d 852, 882 \n(6th Cir. 2020); see also Wilson, 2020 WL 981717, at *2 (“[T]he Sixth Circuit has held that \nmunicipal liability may attach when an official with final decision-making authority and a duty to \nknow and act upon unconstitutional conduct fails to investigate or correct the unconstitutional \nconduct.”). \nHere, Plaintiffs assert that then-Chief Quinlan was the final policymaker on police practices \nand provided the “marching orders” to quell the protests, rather than just to prevent a riot—and \nthat resulted in their constitutional violations. As for proof, Plaintiffs claim that in Columbus, a \npattern or practice has long existed of flouting the letter or spirit of CPD policies against excessive \nuse of force, favoring the right to protest, or racially discriminating. What happened to Plaintiffs \nand other protestors went beyond that pattern or practice because the then-Chief issued the policies \nthe officers were implementing against Plaintiffs and other protestors.  \nAssuming Plaintiffs’ allegations are true—that police were armed with military-grade \nequipment and had a green light to spray pepper spray, deploy tear gas, and fire wooden pellets to \ninflict pain as a deterrent—then, the consistency of officers’ alleged actions supports the assertion \nthat officers were implementing CPD customs or policies. In other words, this Court finds that \nPlaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits of a Monell claim, insofar as it is \npremised upon ratification of illegal actions by officials with final decision-making authority. \n(3) Failure to Supervise and Discipline \nPlaintiffs assert that Columbus police officers received minimal and ineffective training \nfrom Defendants City and CPD Chief and were subject to vague, ineffective, and rarely enforced \n  79\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 80 of 88  PAGEID #: 5750\npolicies regarding the need to handle protestors without using force or using the least amount of \nnon-lethal force necessary. (ECF No. 6 at 4). This is essentially an allegation of omission—that \nDefendants  had  a  “custom”  of  failing  to  supervise  and  discipline.  A  custom,  for  purposes \nof Monell liability, must “be so permanent and well settled as to constitute a custom or usage with \nthe force of law.” Monell, 436 U.S. at 691. It must reflect a course of action deliberately chosen \nfrom among various alternatives. City of Oklahoma v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 823 (1985). \nThis contention, Defendants retort, is also unsupported. True, Defendants admit that \ninadequate police training and supervision can demonstrate an improper policy or custom for \npurposes of municipal liability—but only when the purported failures to train or supervise amount \nto deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the police come into contact. (ECF \nNo. 10 at 27). Defendants insist that Plaintiffs cannot show that the training or supervision of \nColumbus police officers was, or is, lacking or inadequate because all officers receive extensive \ntraining, which includes instruction on community diversity and the inappropriateness of biased-\nbased profiling. With respect to the use of chemical spray, sworn officers are not permitted to carry \nchemical spray until training and qualification standards have been satisfied. (ECF No. 10 at 28).  \nPlaintiffs identify multiple deficiencies and inadequacies in CPD’s use-of-force or civil \ndisorder and crowd control training or supervision. For example, the crowd-control training \ninstructed that not all protestors standing with their hands raised were peaceful, that children and \nthe elderly were pawns and shields, that volunteers distributing water on a hot day were fomenting \nviolence, and that protestors wearing protective gear for fear of CPD force were “not actually \nnonviolent,” so officers needed to be “mentally prepared to use force” against them. (Mabry Aff. \n¶¶ 5278−81, 5287−88). CPD’s directives and instructions for its officers to collectively punish \n  80\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 81 of 88  PAGEID #: 5751\nnonviolent demonstrators, even though using the force they had been trained to use, was palpably \nexcessive.  \nAs to discipline, even though the Mayor and then-Chief admitted officers’ video-recorded \nconduct was improper, there have been zero reports by officers of excessive force by others during \nthe protests, zero disciplinary actions or criminal charges for excessive force, and zero efforts to \nrelieve violent officers from duty or to remove them from special response teams. (ECF No. 63 at \n8). \nPlaintiffs have also demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of Monell liability \nbased upon failure to supervise or discipline.  \n(4) Custom or Tolerance of Acquiescence \n \nFinally, to proceed on an “inaction theory” of liability—i.e., a custom or tolerance of \nacquiescence—a plaintiff must show: \n(1) the existence of a clear and persistent pattern of [illegal activity]; (2) notice or \nconstructive notice on the part of the [defendant]; (3) the [defendant’s] tacit approval of \nthe unconstitutional conduct, such that their deliberate indifference in their failure to act \ncan be said to amount to an official policy of inaction; and (4) that the [defendant’s] custom \nwas the ‘moving force’ or direct causal link in the constitutional deprivation. \n \nStanfield v. Lima, 727 F. App’x 841, 851 (6th Cir. 2018) (quoting another source). \nOne instance of potential misconduct is insufficient to show a clear and persistent pattern \nof constitutional violations. Stewart v. City of Memphis, 788 F. App’x 341, 347 (6th Cir. 2019). \nSuch a pattern, however, is shown by “enough similar incidents” sufficient to put officials on \nnotice  that  persons  “would  be  subject  to  constitutional  deprivation”  if  the  problem  is  not \nremedied. See Leach v. Shelby Cnty. Sheriff, 891 F.2d 1241, 1247 (6th Cir. 1989). For instance, \nin Lipman v. Budish, the Sixth Circuit held that allegations of six different instances in which \ncounty officials interviewed a potential child abuse victim in the presence of her alleged abusers \n  81\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 82 of 88  PAGEID #: 5752\nwere “enough to draw the reasonable inference that this custom [of interviewing potential abuse \nvictims in the presence of their alleged abusers] was widespread throughout [the County Division \nof Children and Family Services] and known to policymakers within the county.” 974 F.3d 726, \n748 (6th Cir. 2020). Therefore, the court decided these allegations were sufficient to survive a \nmotion to dismiss. Id. \nThe required showing is that the “evidence must show that the need to act is so obvious” \nthat the “conscious decision not to act” amounts to a “policy of deliberate indifference” toward the \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional rights. Doe v. Claiborne Cnty., Tenn. By & Through Claiborne Cnty. Bd. \nof Educ., 103 F.3d 495, 508 (6th Cir. 1996). Deliberate indifference requires “proof that a \nmunicipal actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his action.” Miller v. Calhoun \nCnty., 408 F.3d 803, 815 (6th Cir. 2005). This “requires proof that the municipality was aware of \nprior unconstitutional actions by its employees and failed to take corrective measures.” Id. \nIn the present case, Plaintiffs allege that the City has an unwritten policy, practice, or \ncustom of condoning the use of excessive force against some protestors, such as those protesting \npolice violence. They argue specifically that the use of excessive force and the quelling of speech \nby  police  during  peaceful  protests  demonstrated  Defendants’  deliberate  indifference  in  the \npolicies, training, supervision, and discipline needed to prevent officers and mutual-aid law \nenforcement personnel from violating constitutional rights. This alleged failure to investigate or \ndiscipline, or to make any meaningful policy reforms, suggests a conscious choice to allow the \npattern of alleged conduct to continue. \nPlaintiffs also allege that Defendants’ custom of acquiescence was the cause of their \ninjuries. The Sixth Circuit has held that a municipality’s failure to act in the face of obvious \n  82\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 83 of 88  PAGEID #: 5753\nconstitutional violations is properly treated as the cause of subsequent, similar violations. Leach, \n891 F.2d at 1248.  \nDefendants state that Plaintiffs have failed to provide any evidence of a pattern or practice \nof CPD using excessive force on nonviolent protestors or retaliating against them on the basis of \ntheir speech and assembly. As a legal matter, Defendants concede that a failure to discipline or \ninvestigate can demonstrate a municipal policy or custom “if the plaintiff can show that the \nmunicipality  historically  failed  to  investigate  or  discipline  similar  conduct  such  that  the \nmunicipality’s inaction represents an unofficial custom or tolerance.” (ECF No. 10 at 25 (citing \nBear v. Del. Cnty., Case No. 2:14-cv-00043, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6537, at *38 (S.D. Ohio Jan. \n20, 2016))). But Defendants assert that Plaintiffs’ claim still is insufficient because, per Sherrod v. \nWilliams, “an after-the-fact approval of an officer’s conduct cannot logically be the moving force \nbehind the constitutional violation.” 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8915, at *70−71 (S.D. Ohio Jan. 15, \n2019) (citing another source). \nAccepting Plaintiffs’ allegations as true, it is at least plausible that CPD’s alleged failure \nto act on city officials’ knowledge of potential constitutional violations over the course of several \ndays of protests was the “moving force” behind subsequent violations of the same type. Therefore, \nin addition to the “ratification” theory of liability, Plaintiffs have also adequately pled all four \nelements of the “inaction theory” of municipal liability under Monell. \nThus, even though the mayor and then-Chief Quinlan admitted officers’ video-recorded \nconduct was improper, there have been zero reports by officers of excessive force by others during \nthe protests, zero disciplinary actions or criminal charges for excessive force, and zero efforts to \nrelieve violent officers from duty or remove them from special response teams. (ECF No. 59). \n  83\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 84 of 88  PAGEID #: 5754\n(5)  Finding on Monell Factors \nThe video and testimonial evidence presented by Plaintiffs suggests that police have used \nphysical violence, tear gas, and pepper spray against peaceful protestors without provocation, and \ncity officials have done nothing or not enough to condemn and correct these actions. This evidence \nleads  to  the  inference  that  Plaintiffs  have  a  likelihood  of  success  in  establishing  that \nunconstitutional conduct by police was carried out pursuant to an official policy or custom. \n2.  Irreparable Harm \nIrreparable harm is nearly as crucial as the success factor: “Our frequently reiterated \nstandard requires plaintiffs seeking preliminary relief to demonstrate that irreparable injury is \nlikely in the absence of an injunction.” Winter, 555 U.S. at 22−24. “The loss of First Amendment \nfreedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.” Elrod \nv. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976).  \nHere, Defendants argue that: (1) it is likely that Plaintiffs will again be subject to the alleged \nunconstitutional conduct; (2) their delay in seeking an injunction further undercuts their argument \nthat they will suffer irreparable harm without it; (3) when a defendant voluntarily ceases the alleged \noffending conduct, a cognizable danger of recurrent violation is not shown; and (4) Plaintiffs have \nnot shown irreparable injury because they do not actually attempt to enjoin unconstitutional \npolicies (this basically appears to be an overbreadth argument). (ECF No. 10 at 34).  \nThis Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated irreparable harm. Protests combatting \npolice brutality against Black Americans have proven cumulative. Protests are inherently ongoing, \nand it is often difficult to tell where one protest ends and the next begins. There is nothing in the \nrecord that indicates that upon another protest, Plaintiffs will not experience further constitutional \ndeprivations and physical harm at the hands of the police. Indeed, Plaintiffs and witnesses have \n  84\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 85 of 88  PAGEID #: 5755\nattended multiple protests and were twice subject to problematic police treatment. Because “a \nconstitutional  right  is  being  threatened  or  impaired,  a  finding  of  irreparable  injury  is \nmandated.” Bonnell v. Lorenzo, 241 F.3d 800, 809 (6th Cir. 2001). \n3.  Balance of the Equities \nWhen considering the third factor, the balance of equities, a court “must balance the \ncompeting claims of injury” and “consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding \nof the requested relief.” Winter, 555 U.S. at 24 (internal quotations omitted). Police officers are \noften faced with dangerous and rapidly evolving situations while trying to enforce the law and \nmaintain the safety of the public. And, societally, we have determined it is important that police \nofficers have non-lethal options to use to protect themselves and the public when necessary. Most \nprotests tend to have an element of violence or destruction—and even when nonviolent, they are, \nby definition, disruptive. The locus of First Amendment activity often is public buildings, the risk \nof a protest overflowing—intentionally or not—into the citadels of republican democracy is non-\ntrivial. \nRecent events—including the January 6 attempted insurrection at Capitol Hill, the breach \nof Governor Inslee’s mansion in Washington on the same day, the December 2020 armed break-\nin to the Oregon state capitol, armed protestors rallying inside the Michigan Statehouse last May, \na recent break-into Bellingham City Hall—reify the extent to which many of us rely on police \nofficers to keep our communities and those who serve the government safe. But the relief that \nPlaintiffs request leaves open all lawful options for police to use reasonable force when necessary \nto defend against a threat and to make arrests when supported by probable cause. And any possible \nbenefit police officers could gain from deploying chemical agents, projectiles, or striking weapons \n  85\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 86 of 88  PAGEID #: 5756\nagainst demonstrators who pose no threat and are not resisting lawful commands is outweighed by \nthe irreparable harm peaceful protestors could face. \n4.  Public Interest \nThe final factor, the public interest, also weighs in favor of an injunction. “It is always in \nthe public interest to prevent the violation of a party’s constitutional rights.” Connection Distrib. \nCo. v. Reno, 154 F.3d 281, 288 (6th Cir. 1998) (quoting G & V Lounge, Inc. v. Mich. Liquor \nControl Comm’n, 23 F.3d 1071, 1079 (6th Cir. 1994)). Because the Plaintiffs have established a \nlikelihood of success on the merits of their constitutional claims, an injunction to prevent further \nirreparable constitutional harm is in the public interest. \n5.  Scope of Preliminary Injunction \nHaving found that a preliminary injunction is warranted, this Court turns to the scope of \nthe injunctive relief. This Court hereby ORDERS the following: \n(1) Defendants are restrained from using non-lethal force, including tear gas, pepper spray, \nflash-bang grenades, rubber bullets, wooden pellets, batons, body slams, pushing or pulling, or \nkettling, on nonviolent protestors to enforce dispersal orders, traffic laws, such as clearing the \nstreets or sidewalks, and/or misdemeanors, that were not committed with actual or imminently \nthreatened physical harm or property destruction; \n(2) Defendants are required to recognize that, for purposes of the injunction, “nonviolent \nprotestors” includes individuals who are chanting, verbally confronting police, sitting, holding \ntheir hands up when approaching police, occupying streets or sidewalks, and/or passively resisting \npolice orders; \n  86\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 87 of 88  PAGEID #: 5757\n(3) Defendants may only enforce dispersal orders, traffic laws, such as clearing the streets \nor sidewalks, or misdemeanor enforcement, to the extent practicable, through citations or arrests, \nbased on probable cause that an individual has committed a violation; \n(4)  Defendants  are  prohibited  from  using  the  infliction  of  pain  to  punish  or  deter \n“nonviolent protestors” and are directed to limit infliction of pain on any protestor when incidental \nto a use of force necessary for preventing crimes committed with actual or imminently threatened \nphysical harm or property destruction and/or arresting, based on probable cause, an individual who \nallegedly committed such an offense; \n(5) Defendants must ensure that body and vehicle cameras are in good working order and \nused during every interaction with “nonviolent protestors” and badge numbers and/or identity \ncards are prominently displayed in each such interaction, even when riot gear is being worn; \n(6) Defendants must recognize that individuals legitimately displaying “press,” “media,” \n“reporter,” “paramedic,” “medic,” “legal observer,” or similar words and/or symbols are permitted \nto be present in a position enabling them to record at protests and/or to intervene to assist \nindividuals who appear to have been injured and that all individuals, regardless of their occupation \nor nonviolent activity, are permitted to record at protests or whenever any police officer interacts \nwith the public; and \n(7) The City of Columbus and its Division of Police must request that mutual aid law \nenforcement personnel to cooperate with them adhere to the foregoing restraints or standards on \nthe use of non-lethal force and enforcement, infliction of pain, cameras and identification, and \nrecognition of “nonviolent protestors” and individuals assisting or observing them. \n  87\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 66 Filed: 04/30/21 Page: 88 of 88  PAGEID #: 5758\nV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction because: (1) they have standing to sue and the matter is not moot; (2) they have \ndemonstrated a likelihood of success on their Fourth Amendment excessive-force claim, First-\nAmendment retaliation claim, and the municipal-liability factors under Monell; (3) they have \nestablished irreparable injury because protests, especially against police brutality, are inherently \nongoing; (4) the balance of the equities tilts in Plaintiffs’ favor; and (5) the public interest weighs \nin favor of an injunction because it seeks to prevent the violation of constitutional rights. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n                                                         \n            ALGENON L.

Preliminary Statement   \n  1.  On May 25, 2020, the killing of George Floyd, who was being arrested for \nallegedly passing a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes, by then Minneapolis Police Department \nOfficer Derek Chauvin was live-streamed over the Internet for eight minutes and 46 seconds and \nlater televised around the world. \n \n1 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 2 of 81  PAGEID #: 2\n2.  Starting on May 28, 2020, in Columbus, Ohio, Plaintiffs, along with hundreds of \nthousands in cities, states, and countries, took to the streets to demonstrate against excessive use \nof force by police, saying the names of Black men and women who had recently been killed by \npolice  or  vigilantes;  chanting  that  “Black  Lives  Matter,”  “No  Justice,  No  Peace,”  “I  can’t \nbreathe,” “Hands up, Don’t Shoot,” and “Whose Streets? Our Streets”; and expressing their \noutrage at the militarization of police forces, the disparate impact on minority communities of \nlaw enforcement priorities, and a pattern or practice of governments at all levels tolerating \nsystemic  racism  and  failing  to  adopt  effective  policies  or  implement  adequate  training, \nsupervision, and discipline of law enforcement officers. \n3.  Plaintiffs and other demonstrators in Columbus comprised a multi-racial group, \ninformally brought together by Black community leaders and activists primarily through the use \nof social media and dedicated to nonviolent protest, including civil disobedience of traffic, \nparade, and mass-gathering regulations, to generate urgent widespread public attention to the \nhistoric and continuing police violence directed overwhelmingly at communities and people of \ncolor condoned by mostly white police supervisors and administrators.   \n4.  The goals of Plaintiffs and other demonstrators included engendering serious, \neffective, and immediate actions to bring a halt to the endemic racism infecting America’s law \nenforcement  and  justice  systems  and  the  general  tolerance  of  excessive  force  routinely \nadministered by police officers against arrestees, regardless of innocence or guilt, and especially \nagainst citizens who question an officer’s actions. \n5.  On May 28, 2020, Plaintiffs and other demonstrators in Columbus exercised their \nrights of assembly and expression by gathering downtown. \n6.  Defendants Sergeant and Officers were angered by the civil disobedience they \nobserved, the message of the protests, and the criticisms and denunciation they heard.   \n \n2 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 3 of 81  PAGEID #: 3\n7.  Defendants Sergeant and Officers had received minimal and ineffective training \nfrom Defendants City and Chief and were subject to vague, ineffective, and rarely enforced \npolicies regarding the need to handle protesters without using force or using the least amount of \nnon-lethal force necessary.  \n8.  Defendants Sergeant and Officers instead responded to the protests with excessive \nuse of force, including pepper spraying, tear gassing, and assaulting with physical force and \nrubber bullets or wooden pellets, and flash-bang grenades against nonviolent protestors who \nwere  standing  in  the  streets,  from  which  vehicular  traffic  had  already  been  blocked  and \neliminated by police, or on sidewalks, chanting, and holding signs and posing no threat of \nviolence or property destruction, and typically without giving audible warnings to their targets. \n9.   Defendants Sergeant and Officers either criticized, often profanely, the protestors \nfor their chants, signs, and civil disobedience or heard, without commenting, other Officers do so \nwhile using excessive force. \n10.  Defendants Sergeant and Officers purposely used excessive force to punish one or \nmore Plaintiffs and other demonstrators, to deter them from continuing to protest and others from \njoining a protest with which they disagreed, and to reclaim the streets. \n11.  Defendants Sergeant and Officers maliciously prosecuted one or more Plaintiffs \nto punish them and deter other demonstrators from continuing to protest. \n12.  Just the month before, Defendants had exercised restraint when demonstrators, \nsome of whom openly carried weapons and engaged in hate speech while violating statewide \nsocial-distancing and mask mandates, protested the COVID-19 lockdown at and around the \nStatehouse. \n13.  Despite the excessive use of force earlier on May 28, 2020, the overwhelming \nmajority of the demonstrators remained nonviolent, fled from the toxic chemicals, and left, \nsought medical assistance, or tried to regroup at a safe distance. \n \n3 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 4 of 81  PAGEID #: 4\n14.  After  Defendants  needlessly  escalated  and  provoked  protestors,  there  were \nsporadic incidents of property destruction or harassment of law enforcement officers by throwing \nobjects, but none of these actions caused serious injury to officers, and none of them were \ncommitted by or reasonably could have been attributed to the Plaintiffs and other nonviolent \ndemonstrators. \n15.  After  Defendants  had  escalated  their  force  against  non-violent  protestors, \ntriggering  property  destruction  by  others,  they  authorized  more  police  and  mutual-aid  law \nenforcement personnel  to  use greater force against the remaining demonstrators, who were \ninjured even though the overwhelming majority of them were not engaged in any violence \ntoward police or property destruction. \n16.  On May 29 and 30, a similar dynamic occurred; a curfew from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 \np.m. was imposed on May 30; and public indignation at the broadcasts on social media and local \nand  national  television  of  the  demonstrations  and  reports  and  pictures  or  video  sent  to \nreportcpd@columbus.gov ultimately convinced the Columbus Mayor, who had initially falsely \ndescribed what had been happening and excused the police use of force, to limit the use of tear \ngas and, on June 1, 2020, denounce excessive force by police officers.  \n17.  Plaintiffs have suffered injuries to their civil rights and their bodies, and they \nreasonably expect to exercise, and are unwilling to refrain from exercising, their fundamental \nrights to assemble, protest, travel, and live freely within and around Columbus in the future.   \n18.  Plaintiffs  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief;  compensatory  damages  for \ninjuries; punitive damages from Defendants Chief, Sergeant, and Officers; and attorneys’ fees \nand costs for violations of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments rights to be free from \nexcessive use of force and malicious prosecution; their First and Fourteenth Amendments rights \nto peaceably assemble and exercise freedom of expression; and/or their Ohio common-law right \nnot  to  battered  or  maliciously  prosecuted  and/or  injured  by  the  gross  negligence  of  police \n \n4 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 5 of 81  PAGEID #: 5\nofficers, caused by the failure of Defendants City of Columbus and Chief to adopt effective \npolicies and adequately train, supervise, and discipline police officers. \nII.  Jurisdiction and Venue \n  19.  This  Court has jurisdiction  over this action by virtue of 28 U.S.C. §§  1331 \n(federal question); 1343 (civil rights); and 1367 (supplemental jurisdiction). \n  20.  Declaratory, equitable, and injunctive relief is sought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n2201; 2202; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and the common law of the State of Ohio. \n  21.  Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the common law of the State of Ohio, compensatory \ndamages may be awarded against all Defendants and punitive damages be awarded against \nDefendants Chief, Sergeant, and Officers. \n  22.  Costs and attorneys’ fees may be awarded pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 54, and the common law of the State of Ohio. \n  23.  Venue lies in this forum pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and S.D. Civ. R. 82.1 \nbecause the claims arose in Franklin County, Ohio where Defendant City of Columbus is located \nand operates the Division of Police, headed by Defendant Chief, which empowered Defendants \nChief, Sergeant, and Officers to use force. \nIII.

Those names include Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old African-American killed in 2015 \nby a Cleveland Police Officer when the child was carrying a pellet gun; Breonna Taylor, an \nAfrican-American Emergency Medical Technician, shot eight times on March 13, 2020, by \nofficers of the Louisville Metro Police Department who were executing a no-knock warrant at \nher residence; Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American teenager, fatally shot in 2014 by a \n \n9 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 10 of 81  PAGEID #: 10\nFerguson,  Missouri  police  officer;  Eric  Garner,  an  African-American  whose  cry,  “I  can’t \nbreathe,” was repeated by George Floyd, fatally choked in 2014 by a New York City police \nofficer who was arresting him for selling loose cigarettes; Philando Castile, an African-American \nelementary school cafeteria worker shot five times during a 2016 traffic stop by a St. Paul, \nMinnesota police officer; and Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery, young African-Americans \nkilled by vigilantes, one of whom was a former police officer. \n47.  Since  the  May  28-June  3,  2020  Columbus  protests,  the  list  has  grown.  \nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/say-their-names-list-people-injured-killed-police-officer-\ninvolved-incidents/ \n48.  While in a handful of cases, discipline had been meted out and prosecutions \npursued, most of the police officers were not disciplined, let alone successfully prosecuted; \nindeed, when George Floyd was killed there had been no police discipline meted out for Breonna \nTaylor’s death. \n49.  The widespread dissemination of the May 25, 2020 video of Officer Chauvin \nkilling George Floyd coupled with the killing of Breonna Taylor and the history reflected in \nthose names, caused an eruption of public revulsion about police use of excessive force on \nAfrican-Americans and other minorities. \n50.  Social media facilitated the scheduling of demonstrations. \n  B.  Defendants’ Preparation for Demonstrations \n51.  Defendants  knew  by  May  26,  2020,  that  demonstrations  would  occur  in \ndowntown Columbus. \n \n10 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 11 of 81  PAGEID #: 11\n52.  Defendants  knew  that  the  group  Black  Lives  Matter  would  call  for  such \ndemonstrations. \n53.  Defendants knew that Black Lives Matter is an organized movement dedicated to \nnon-violent  civil  disobedience  in  protest  of  incidents  of  police  brutality  against  African-\nAmericans, which began in 2013 when activists uses the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social \nmedia after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teen \nTrayvon Martin in February 2012, and was nationally recognized for street demonstrations \nfollowing the Brown and Garner deaths. \n54.  Defendant City and Chief monitored social media communications to and from \nBlack Lives Matter and were aware, before the evening of May 28, 2020, that Black Lives \nMatter was encouraging a non-violent protest in Columbus. \n55.  Many  of  Plaintiffs  and  other  protestors  were  affiliated  with,  identified  with, \nand/or were inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, dressing in clothing with the group’s \nname or initials, and using chants, such as “Black Lives Matter”; “I Can’t Breathe”; “No Justice, \nNo Peace”; and “Hands up, Don’t Shoot,” which were associated with the group. \n56.  Many Columbus police officers and their supervisors, along with some mutual-aid \nlaw  enforcement  personnel,  nurse  an  abiding  hatred  of  the  Black  Live  Matters  movement, \nbelieving that it hurts the image of police and functions as a limitation on the prerogative of \npolice to use force in keeping peace, protecting property, and preserving law and order. \n57.  Many Columbus police officers and their supervisors, along with some mutual-aid \nlaw  enforcement  personnel,  resent  the  chant  “Black  Lives  Matter”  and  prefer  “Blue  Lives \n \n11 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 12 of 81  PAGEID #: 12\nMatter” and/or “All Lives Matter,” slogans that dismiss and deny the existence and importance \nof systemic racism in policing. \n58.  Anticipating the Columbus protests, many Columbus police officers and their \nsupervisors,  along  with  some  mutual-aid  law  enforcement  personnel,  decided  to  use  their \nassignments  to  exact  revenge  on  the  Black  Lives  Matter  group  and  chill  the  exercise  of \nassociation and freedom of expression by protestors. \n59.  One tactic used by Defendants City and Chief was to have Columbus Police \nOfficers declare that a peaceful, nonviolent protest in the streets of Columbus had become an \nemergency  and  then  order  the  protestors  to  disperse,  using  projectile  weapons  and  caustic \nchemical agents to enforce that order. \n60.  Defendants  City  and  Chief  had  adopted  a  policy,  training  Columbus  Police \nOfficers on that policy, to use that tactic in response to large protests. \n61.  Failure  to  disperse  when  ordered  by  a  law  enforcement  officer  is,  under \nR.C.  2917.04, a minor misdemeanor, unless the order is given in an emergency, when the crime \nbecomes a fourth-degree misdemeanor. \n62.  Under R.C.  2917.04(B), “Nothing in this section requires persons to disperse who \nare peaceably assembled for a lawful purpose.” \n63.  Defendants City and Chief have not emphasized in that policy or training the \nalternative to use of non-lethal force of citing and/or arresting protestors who do not disperse. \n64.  Defendants City and Chief have not emphasized in that policy or training a means \nfor Columbus Police Officers to differentiate peaceable assembly for a lawful purpose from an \nactual emergency. \n \n12 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 13 of 81  PAGEID #: 13\n65.  Defendant City’s Division of Police has a history of excessive use of force and \nother abuses of their authority in response to nonviolent demonstrations and expressive conduct \nby those with whom police officers and their superiors disagree. \n66.  For example, on June 17, 2017, when Black Lives Matter became involved with a \nprotest at the Columbus Pride Parade, police officers raced to the scene with pepper-spray \ncanisters already drawn. \n67.  Only weeks later, on July 7, 2017, when protestors with disabilities, many of them \nin wheelchairs, peacefully occupied Senator Rob Portman’s Columbus office to urge him to vote \nagainst a federal health care bill supported by President Trump (who is supported publicly and \nprivately by many police officers because he opposes any form of accountability for police \nabuses), Columbus Police Officers arrived at the scene, claiming there was an emergency call for \nassistance,  and  forcibly  arrested  the  peaceful  protestors  using  excessive  force,  including \nknocking over wheelchairs and carrying some protestors with mobility issues out of the building. \n68.  The following year, on July 11, 2018, Stephanie Clifford (also known as Stormy \nDaniels), the adult film star who was paid hush money by President Trump to conceal an affair, \nvisited a Columbus strip club on a publicity tour embarrassing to the President, and several \nColumbus police officers targeted Daniels for arrest because of her status as an anti-Trump \npolitical symbol and arrested other women working at the club because of their association with \nDaniels and to cover up their retaliatory motive.   \n69.  Social media message board posts among Columbus Police Officers celebrated \nthe arrests as a blow against President Trump’s critics.    \n \n13 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 14 of 81  PAGEID #: 14\n70.  In contrast, Columbus police officers have peacefully monitored protests and \nother  expressive  events  in  downtown  Columbus  with  whose  messages  they  are  neutral  or \nsympathetic, including the recent protests at the Ohio statehouse against COVID-19-related \nclosures and the intense mass protests and public rallies in 2011 by public employee unions \n(including their own) against the effort to restrict collective bargaining rights.  \n71.  Despite knowing about this history of Defendant City’s Division of Police and the \nnegative feelings towards Black Lives Matter of its officers and their superiors, Defendants City \nand Chief took no specific precautions against excessive use of force in handling the protests. \n72.  Defendants City and Chief ensured that Columbus Police Officers were armed \nwith batons, pepper spray, tear gas canisters, flash-bang grenades, and/or weapons that could \nshoot rubber bullets or wooden pellets. \n73.  Defendants  City  and  Chief  characterized  such  weapons  as  “non-lethal”  and \nencouraged their use as an alternative to Tasers and guns and/or rifles that used regular bullets, \ndespite  knowing  that  these  “non-lethal”  weapons,  while  less  lethal  than  officers’  service \nweapons,  still  have  the  potential  to  cause  death  or  serious  injury,  especially  (though  not \nexclusively) when used without appropriate precautions \n74.  The way Columbus Police Officers and mutual-aid law enforcement personnel \nused such weapons posed a significant risk of serious and harmful bodily injury to nonviolent \nprotestors. \n75.  Batons are hard, ergonomic sticks designed to inflict pain and, when applied with \nthe usual force, will break bones and cause concussions and internal bleeding. \n \n14 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 15 of 81  PAGEID #: 15\n76.  Pepper spray is a chemical compound that irritates the target’s eyes, causing a \nburning sensation, pain, and temporary blindness; inflicts shortness of breath by burning the \ntarget’s lungs; and interferes with breathing by irritating the respiratory system, which, during \nthe protests, was already a concern because of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n77.  Tear gas canisters contain a chemical weapon, colloquially known as mace, which \ncauses severe eye and respiratory pain, skin irritation, bleeding, and blindness.  \n78.  The use of tear gas in warfare is prohibited by international treaties. \n79.  Long-lasting effects of tear gas can include development of respiratory illnesses, \nand and the canisters can be delivered with such force that they cause severe bruising, loss of \neyesight, and/or skull or bone fractures.  \n80.  Flash-bang  grenades,  which  are  also  known  as  stun  grenades,  are  explosive \ndevices that emit both an extremely loud bang, usually with higher decibels than a jet engine at \nfull throttle, and ultra-bright light to disorient their targets. \n81.  Flash-bang grenades cause temporary blindness and pain to the retina, impaired \nhearing, and/or disruption of the inner-ear fluid and consequent loss of balance. \n82.  Rubber bullets, technically kinetic impact projectiles, are hard rubber or rubber-\ncoated projectiles that can be fired at the same velocity as bullets from standard weapons or riot \nguns. \n83.  Rubber  bullets  are  intended  to  cause  pain  without  serious  injury,  but  they \ntypically cause not only contusions, abrasions, and hematomas, but also bone fractures. \n84.  Rubber bullets are not designed to be safely shot point-blank or at a target’s head, \nbut it is well known that law enforcement officers often disregard this instruction. \n \n15 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 16 of 81  PAGEID #: 16\n85.  Wooden pellets are dowel-shaped rods sliced into small, bullet-sized projectiles to \nbe fired at the same velocity as bullets. \n86.  Like rubber bullets, wooden pellets are intended to cause pain without serious \ninjury, but they typically cause typically cause bone fractures as well as contusions, abrasions, \nand hematomas. \n87.  Wooden pellets can also splinter and infect areas where their targets are hit. \n88  While they are not designed to be safely shot point-blank or at a target’s head, \nofficers frequently do so anyway.  \nC.  Days and Nights of Police Rage \n89.  Over the course of the demonstrations on May 28, 29, and 30 and June 1, 2, and 3, \nColumbus  Police  Officers  beat  peaceful  protestors  and  bystanders;  pepper-sprayed  without \nprovocation  and  at  point  blank  range  protestors  and  observers,  including  United  States \nCongresswoman  Joyce  Beatty,  City  Council  President  Shannon  Hardin,  and  County \nCommissioner Kevin Boyce; lobbed and/or shot tear gas canisters without provocation; fired \nrubber bullets or wooden pellets and flash-bang grenades directly at vulnerable body areas of \nprotestors,  as  truly  and  accurately  reflected  in  a  video  posted  at \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&v=vZaoz9ZRVOc&feature=emb_title  and \nshown below; and targeted identified journalists and individuals providing medical assistance. A \ntrue and accurate copy of that video is provided below (double click to play or click the link). \n \n \n \n16 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 17 of 81  PAGEID #: 17\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n90.  The targeting of identified journalists was done to eliminate eye-witness reports \nand photographs or videos of police engaging in use of excessive force and retaliating against \nprotestors for the content and urgency of their expression.  \n91.  A  tactic  used  by  Columbus  Police  Officers  is  “kettling,”  where  groups  of \nnonviolent protestors are boxed in, typically by using commands, bicycles, horses, and/or lines \nof police, and moved from one place to another, even though the protestors were unwilling or, \ndue to other protestors or physical barriers, unable to move, and then arresting them for resisting, \nobstructing, and/or failing to disperse. \n92.  Apart from assembling and chanting or holding signs in the middle of streets or \nother locations Columbus Police Officers wanted them to abandon, these groups of protestors \nwere not violating, as reflected in the true and accurate pictures below, any laws, threatening \nviolence, destroying any property, or hampering traffic. \n \n17 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 18 of 81  PAGEID #: 18\n \n \n \n18 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 19 of 81  PAGEID #: 19\n \n \n \n93.  Another tactic used by Columbus Police Officers was collective punishment: \nresponding to any action by an isolated individual who threw a water bottle, harassed or taunted \nan  officer,  or  engaged  in  property  destruction  by  indiscriminately  pepper-spraying  or  tear-\ngassing a group of obviously different protestors who had not engaged in any such conduct. \n94.  The “kettling” and collective punishment created a chaotic situation among the \nprotestors which Columbus Police Officers then used as an excuse for additional force including \n \n19 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 20 of 81  PAGEID #: 20\nusing force against protestors who moved to assist others who had been subjected to excessive \nforce. \n95.  Defendant Chief knew that such tactics were being used to provoke demonstrators \nand justify arrests, but he did not intervene to limit their use. \n96.  To the contrary, Defendant Chief excused the targeting of identifiable journalists \nby falsely claiming that they had been difficult to identify and force was used in a fast-moving \nsituation where officers were being assaulted “pelted with bottles and rocks.” \n97.  The false claims of Defendant Chief to excuse misconduct were intended to be \ntaken  by  Columbus  Police  Officers,  and  were  in  fact  taken,  as  a  form  of  approval  and \ncondonation of their tactics and an invitation to continue and escalate them. \n98.  Photographs and videos taken at the scene demonstrate that journalists, who were \nwearing hats and hoodies bearing the name of their newspaper, were targeted even though \nnothing was being thrown at the police, the protestors were not out of control, and the situation \nwas not fast-moving. \n99.  The  way  Defendants  Sergeant  and  Officers  routinely  pepper-sprayed \ndemonstrators who were not engaging in violent behavior is accurately illustrated by the picture \nbelow: \n \n \n20 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 21 of 81  PAGEID #: 21\n© Getty   \n100.  Social media contained first-hand accounts of excessive use of force; for example, \nhttps://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1686026474878930&id=1000041478178\n93 accurately reported about tear gas on May 30, 2020: “I experienced a traumatic event today. I \nwas  participating  in  a  BLM  protest  with  hundreds  of  other  people  today  in  downtown \nColumbus. We were yelling chants & marching around the statehouse on the sidewalks but \nnothing more as we were told this would be a peaceful demonstration.  Then bike cops show \nup. All of them had gas masks on. People started getting uneasy.  A SWAT truck drives by, \nyelling people to stay off the road. But other than people crossing on the crosswalk, no one was \non the streets nor blocking the traffic.  More cops on horseback show up.  People starts \nmurmuring.  More police cars show up & park in the middle of a busy street. Police officers \nstart unloading and gearing up.  People were yelling ‘what are you doing? We’re not doing \nanything wrong!’  First rounds of tear gas goes off in the crosswalk area. People start screaming \n \n21 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 22 of 81  PAGEID #: 22\nand yelling others to run. People were coughing and crying from the effects of the gas (there \nwere children & seniors in the group). People were handing out water to those who needed to \nrinse their face.  Another round of gas goes off. This time, ON THE SIDEWALK. Not on the roads, \nbut directly on the sidewalk. People were running, jumping over the fence, falling on the \nground & running for their lives. This is when my friend and I were impacted and we had to \nrinse our faces off with water for several minutes. We decided that it was getting too dangerous \nand left shortly afterwards.  We weren’t attacking the police. We weren’t vandalizing/looting \nany properties.  No protester had weapons on them.  So tell me, why did we get maced?” \n101.  Corroborating  that  report  is  a  video  housed  at \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=30&v=AswhNfIjqG4&feature=emb_title \naccurately showing the tear-gassing of a group of protestors and police on horseback moving the \nprotestors.

In addition to the injuries described below that each Plaintiff suffered from being \nmistreated by Columbus Police Officers, all plaintiffs suffered fear, frustration, anger, emotional \ndistress, and/or humiliation, as a proximate cause of being mistreated. \nD.  Defendant  City  and  Chief  Knew  of  the  Need  for  Effective  Training, \nSupervision,  and  Discipline  to  Curb  Police  Use  of  Excessive  Force  and \nRetaliation for Associations or Expression Officers Hated. \n \n \n28 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 29 of 81  PAGEID #: 29\n109.  According  to  the  police  tracking  website  https://mappingpoliceviolence.org, \nduring the years 2013 through 2019, Columbus Police Officers killed at a rate of 7.3 per 100,000 \nresidents, which was the highest rate of any department in the State of Ohio and more than \ndouble the rate in Cleveland, Ohio. \n110.  During  that  period,  Columbus  Police  Officers  killed  27  African-Americans, \nincluding  in  2016  Henry  Green,  age  23,  who  was  killed  by  plainclothes  officer  in  the \npredominantly Black neighborhood of South Linden, and three months later, 13-year-old Tyre \nKing. \n111.  African-Americans make up 28% of the population of the City of Columbus, but \nduring that period constituted half (varying between 49% and 53% since 2013) of the use-of-\nforce incidents. \n112.  Defendant City and Chief were aware of these statistics and, while claiming to \nbelieve that most of the individual uses of force were justified, still knew Columbus Police \nOfficers were engaging in a troubling pattern of mistreating African-Americans. \n113.  Despite this knowledge, Defendant City and Chief did not take specific steps to \naddress what appeared to be mistreatment of African-Americans. \n114.  In order to become a Columbus Police Officer, applicants need only have a high \nschool diploma or GED, be 20 years of age or older, have a valid driver’s license, and be a U.S. \ncitizen. \n115.  Upon hire, Columbus Police Officers receive an initial salary of $58,947.20 per \nyear, which steadily increases over their first four years of service, with officers who have \nworked for the department for more than 48 months receiving an annual salary of $90,230.40.  \n \n29 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 30 of 81  PAGEID #: 30\n116.  In addition to their salary, Columbus Police Officers receive a generous benefits \npackage which includes paid training, college tuition reimbursement, life insurance, individual \nand family health insurance, vision and dental plans, and a significant pension package through \nthe Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund. \n117.  In addition to pay and benefits, Columbus Police Officers have the option to \nprovide security and traffic control services, usually referred to as “special duty pay,” at the rate \nof $54.00 per hour, which services are a condition for a parade permit and outdoor events and are \ntypically provided by Columbus Police Officers. \n118.  The training received by Columbus Police Officers is based on the notion that \nbeing a police officer is an extremely dangerous profession, and stresses their security and safety \nabove all else, especially their ability to use force whenever they feel threatened or perceive a \nthreat to another. \n119.  Although being an actual patrol officer is a relatively dangerous profession, with \naverage deaths of 13.7 per 100,000 employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it is \nnowhere nearly as dangerous as common occupations such as roofers (51.5), farmers (24.7). \ntruck drivers (26.0), and groundskeepers (18.6); indeed, with fatal injuries in the amount of 44.3 \nper 100,000, trash and recycling collectors’ jobs are more than three times as dangerous as a \npatrol officer’s job. \n120.  A reliable 2020 study demonstrates that only 4% of a police officer’s time is \ngenerally spent on handling violent crime.  https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/upshot/unrest-\npolice-time-violent-crime.html   \n \n30 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 31 of 81  PAGEID #: 31\n121.  Defendant City has resisted appointing a civilian review board for police officer \nactivities; instead, all citizen complaints against officers are handled by the Columbus Police \nDivision’s Internal Affairs Bureau. \n122.  The Internal Affairs Bureau routinely dismisses citizen complaints against its \nofficers as unfounded, almost always believing the statements of officers over that of citizens.  \n123.  The  Internal  Affairs  Bureau  is  motivated  to  dismiss  citizen  complaints  as \nunfounded because finding against the Officer or Officers might subject the City to civil liability. \n124.  Even  when  citizen  complaints  of  violence  are  sustained,  over  the  years  the \nColumbus Police Division has meted out disproportionately minor discipline for violent acts, \nsuch as written reprimand and short suspensions.   \n125.  In turn, this custom of failing to discipline establishes standards which the union \nfor Columbus Police Officers invoke to persuade arbitrators to reverse serious discipline as \ninconstant with past disciplinary standards. \n126.  Defendant City and Chief know that it is nearly impossible to fire a Columbus \nPolice Officer for use of excessive force.   \n127.  Per  their  union  contract  with  Defendant  City,  Columbus  Police  Officers  are \nindemnified for any damages (except punitive damages) awarded due to a claim of excessive \nforce, and Defendant City provides free legal representation to officers accused of excessive \nforce.   \n128.  Defendant City and Chief knew before the demonstrations which started on May \n28,  2020,  that  Columbus  Police  Officers  faced  little  or  no  disincentive  from  engaging  in \n \n31 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 32 of 81  PAGEID #: 32\nexcessive use of force and regularly failed to comply with the letter or spirit of training and \npolicies on use of force, handling demonstrations, and retaliating for speech they hated. \n129.  Within the Columbus Police Division, it is an unspoken rule that, regardless of \nwhatever violent acts a police officer may witnesses another officer doing, criminal charges will \nnot be brought against that officer. \n130.  In the City of Columbus, misdemeanor offenses are prosecuted by the Columbus \nCity Attorney, and felony offenses are prosecuted by the Franklin County Prosecutor’s Office. \n131.  Both the Columbus City Attorney’s Office and the Franklin County Prosecutor’s \nOffice have an unwritten rule that no criminal charges are to be brought against police officers \nfor acts of violence committed against citizens while in uniform.  \n132.  This unwritten rule applies regardless of the egregiousness of the offense or the \nstrength of the evidence of the officer committing the offenses.   \n133.  Incidents of violence which would cause a regular citizen to be charged with \nassault, battery, or other crimes of violence are not charged against police officers for the sole \nreason that they are police officers.   \n134.  It is common knowledge among Columbus Police Officers that, with the possible \nexception of deadly violence videotaped by citizens, they are immune from any prosecution for \nacts of violence committed within the City of Columbus. \n135.  The combination of a toothless disciplinary policy, indemnification from civil \nliability, and practical immunity from criminal prosecution, creates a perfect storm in which \nColumbus Police Officers know that there will nearly always be no repercussions to them for \nviolent acts.   \n \n32 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 33 of 81  PAGEID #: 33\n136.  With regard to all but one recent police killings (a shooting of a white woman by \nan African-American officer), the Columbus Police Division did not issue significant discipline \nfor any of the officers involved, and no criminal charges were filed against the officers. \n137.  For example, in April of 2017, one of the officers who shot Henry Green, Officer \nZachary Rosen, was caught on videotape stomping on the head of a handcuffed and helpless \nAfrican-American suspect who was lying on the sidewalk.   \n138.  Despite the fact that Officer Rosen had plainly committed an act of felonious \nassault that could have killed or grievously injured the suspect, the Columbus City Attorney’s \nOffice  and  Franklin  County  Prosecutor’s  office  declined  to  bring  criminal  charges  against \nOfficer Rosen solely because of the fact he was a police officer.   \n139.  On June 14, 2017, then-Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs determined that an \nappropriate punishment for Officer Rosen stomping on the head of a helpless individual was a \n24-hour suspension and recommended this punishment to Columbus Public Safety Director Ned \nPettus.   \n140.  In July of 2017, Public Safety Director Pettus rejected the recommendation of \nChief Jacobs and terminated Officer Rosen’s employment.   \n141.  Infuriated that one of their members had been terminated for kicking a helpless \nAfrican-American suspect in the head, the Columbus Fraternal Order of Police (“FOP”) Lodge \nNo. 9 unanimously approved a no-confidence vote in Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther, Public \nSafety Director Pettus, and then-City Council President Zach Klein. \n142.  In announcing the no-confidence vote, FOP President Jason Pappas stated: “We \nwant to send the message that we’ve lost faith. It demonstrates to those individuals that we no \n \n33 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 34 of 81  PAGEID #: 34\nlonger have confidence in their ability to lead. Unless they make significant changes by funding \nus and staffing us and supporting our officers who are out there day in and day out, that we will \nnot have confidence in their ability to lead us or this city.” \n143.  In March 2018, an arbitrator rescinded Safety Director Pettus’s termination and \nreinstated Officer Rosen to his patrol officer position with full back pay.   \n144.  In May 2018, Defendant City paid a $30,000.00 settlement to the individual \nwhose head Officer Rosen had stomped on.   \n145.  This settlement came from public tax dollars, not from Officer Rosen, Defendant \nCity provided free legal representation to Officer Rosen throughout the process.   \n146.  To eliminate the pattern or practice of excessive use of force and retaliating for \nspeech they hated by Defendant City Police Officers and mutual aid law enforcement personnel \ncooperating with them, structural reform, modified policies, and civilian monitoring should, in \naddition to other policies and practices that may be deemed necessary after further discovery of \nthe facts, include: \na.  Creation of a civilian review board empowered, funded, and staffed to \nreceive complaints from individuals who believe they have been the victims of \nexcessive use of force and/or retaliation for their speech; to investigate those \ncomplaints; and to recommend discipline which the Director of the Department of \nPublic Safety must mete out absent clear and convincing evidence that the Board \nbased the recommendation on inaccurate facts. \nb.  Prohibition of the use by Defendant City Division of Police and/or mutual \naid law enforcement personnel cooperating with the Division of tear gas, rubber \n \n34 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 35 of 81  PAGEID #: 35\nbullets, wooden pellets, pepper spray, flashbang grenades, kettling, chokeholds, \nstrangleholds, no-knock warrants, and pressure or weight on the neck, back, or hip \nof a prone suspect. \nc.  Maintenance of body and vehicle cameras in good working order and use \nof those cameras during any interaction with a civilian. \nd.  Prominent display of badge numbers and/or identity cards whenever a \npolice officer interacts with the public. \ne.  Recognition  that  individuals  legitimating  displaying  “press,”  “media,” \n“reporter,” “paramedic,” “medic,” or similar words and/or symbols are permitted \nto be present in a position enabling them to record at protests and/or to intervene \nto assist individuals who appear to have been injured and that all individuals, \nregardless of their occupation or non-violent activity, are permitted to record at \nprotests or whenever an police officer interacts with the public. \nf.  Commitment to affirmative action in recruitment, selection, retention, and \npromotion to ensure that at all ranks minority officers have more than a token \npresence. \ng.  Training and adoption of policies on the use of batons, Tasers, firearms, \nand physical force that emphasize use of the least force necessary and then only \nafter de-escalation and disengagement have been attempted, a clearly understood \noral warning given, and a purpose other than punishing the target exists, with \ndeadly force as the very last resort after other efforts to prevent serious bodily \ninjury or death have been exhausted, and, unless imminent serious bodily injury \n \n35 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 36 of 81  PAGEID #: 36\nor death is reasonably perceived, never to prevent flight or property damage, and \nexpose how stereotyping, implicit bias, and racism affect an officer’s perception \nof an individual and the level of threat that individual poses. \nh.  Contracting  with  and/or  employing  unarmed  intervention  specialists \nrequired to be used in responding to calls involving intoxication, drug use or \nabuse, mental health crises, teenagers or children, vandalism, and/or the homeless. \ni.  Mandating that (i) any officer who witnesses what he or she believes in \ngood faith to be an excessive use of force or retaliation must stop or attempt to \nstop another officer from that use of force or retaliation and report in detail within \n24 hours that conduct to both the Division Chief and the Internal Affairs Bureau, \nand explain what steps the officer took to intervene in use of force or retaliation; \nand that (ii) any officer who uses force must prepare and file with superiors an \nincident report within eight hours detailing the amount of force used, his or her \nperception of the justification for that force to be used, the known or suspected \ninjury to the suspect, the witnesses to that use of force, and any recordings from \nbody and vehicle cameras, cell telephones, and/or other surveillance cameras. \nj.  Inventory  of  Division  equipment,  assessing  which  equipment  is  more \nappropriate  for  use  by  the  military  during  war  than  by  police  officers,  and \ndiscarding such equipment. \nk.  Screening applicants to determine whether they have been suspected of \nusing excessive force in employment, military, and/or social settings and either \n \n36 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 37 of 81  PAGEID #: 37\naffirmatively ensure that the suspicion was unfounded or reject the applicant, and \nre-screen officers every three years for psychological fitness. \nl.  Documenting each suspected use of excessive force by an officer; placing \na copy of the suspicion, investigation, and resolution in the officer’s file and \npreserving for ten years in a separate file the original or an electronic counterpart \nalong with exhibits, drawings, recordings, and other evidence; making the entire \nfile available to the Civilian Review Board and any prospective employer; and \nconsidering the entire file in making retention, assignment, and/or promotion \ndecisions. \nm.  Engaging in focused deterrence of serious crime by analyzing the specific \nblocks in neighborhoods and known individuals who have engaged in criminal \nactivity  and  can  reasonably  be  anticipated  to  do  so  again  and  allocating \nenforcement priority and referrals for social services accordingly.  \nn.  Scheduling meetings in predominantly minority neighborhoods to listen to \ncivilian concerns; to acknowledge that past law enforcement practices, starting \nwith the roots of modern policing in Southern States as slave patrols and later the \nenforcement  of  Jim  Crow  segregation,  proceeding  through  acquiescence  in \nlynching, racist mobs, and/or Ku Klux Klan activities, and culminating in the \ndisproportionate focus on minorities in the war on drug use and abuse and related \ntraffic stops, have created a rift which must be healed; and to discuss steps which \nmight contribute to that healing. \n \n37 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 38 of 81  PAGEID #: 38\no.  Payment for individual officers to have professional liability insurance but \nthen requiring an officer to pay any premium increase attributed to that officer’s \nimproper use of force and/or retaliation and conditioning continued employment \non being insured. \np.  Appoint and pay for the employment of an independent monitor to oversee \nand ensure the successful implementation of the above steps. \n  E.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Tamara K. Alsaada \n147.  On May 30, 2020, Ms. Alsaada, in her position as Organizing Director for the \nPeople’s Justice Project, showed up to a Black Lives Matter rally organized in front of the Ohio \nStatehouse with the goal of helping to lead the rally and to advocate for police reform. \n148.  Ms. Alsaada did not plan the event; however, given her role in the community she \nwas looked at to help provide a voice for the event.   \n149.  While  Ms.  Alsaada  and  other  members  of  the  People’s  Justice  Project  were \nspeaking on the microphone, protestors at the rally came to Ms. Alsaada and informed her that \nprotestors were being arrested by Columbus Police Officers without justification. \n150.  Again, due to her role as a respected community organizer, even serving on \nMayor Ginther’s Community Safety Advisory Commission, Ms. Alsaada and others walked over \nto the intersection of Broad and High to help resolve any pending conflicts.  \n151.  Ms. Alsaada saw Deputy Chief Michael Woods standing near the intersection, \nwho she knew from her time on the Mayor’s Community Safety Advisory Commission.  \n152.  Ms. Alsaada noticed there were lines of police officers at the intersection on \nbicycles, on horseback, and in riot gear.  \n \n38 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 39 of 81  PAGEID #: 39\n153.  Ms. Alsaada asked Deputy Chief Woods who was being arrested, and he informed \nher that no one was being arrested.  \n154.  Ms. Alsaada asked Deputy Chief Woods to have the officers clear a path so that \nshe could walk through and continue to address the topic of arrestees, and he subsequently had \nthe officers allow her through.  \n155.  As Ms. Alsaada and others walked through the line of officers in order to continue \npeacefully  discussing  any  arrestees,  Columbus  Police  Officers  without  notice,  without  any \nwarning,  and  without  any  provocation,  began  to  assault  Ms.  Alsaada  and  others  with  an \nonslaught of pepper spray. \n156.  Ms. Alsaada fell to the ground due to the assault and was unable to breathe or see. \n157.  Ms.  Alsaada  was  carried  to  the  corner  of  road  and  High  where  she  was \nadministered medical attention by volunteer medics.  \n158.  Ms.  Alsaada  and  numerous  others  suffered  injuries  and  trauma  due  to  the \nunprovoked assault by Columbus Police Officers.  \nF.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Demetrius Burke   \n159.  On Wednesday, June 3, 2020, late at night, Mr. Burke was inside his apartment \nnear the intersection of East Starr Avenue and North 9th Street when he heard sirens and a \ncommotion outside.   \n160.  Mr. Burke’s motorcycle was then parked in his apartment complex’s parking lot. \n161.  Because he was concerned that whatever was  going on outside would cause \ndamage to his motorcycle, Mr. Burke went outside to get his motorcycle and move it to a garage \nprovided by his apartment complex. \n \n39 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 40 of 81  PAGEID #: 40\n162.  When he reached his motorcycle, Mr. Burke observed police officers walking \nnorth on North 9th Street and decided to ask the officers what was going on.   \n163.  Because he is an African-American male, Mr. Burke was concerned that the \npolice would act violently towards him and so he turned on his cellphone camera and filmed as \nhe approached the officers.   \n164.  Mr. Burke was aware that the City of Columbus had imposed a 10:00 p.m. curfew \non all residents in public areas and so he was careful to remain on his own property and not step \ninto the street while approaching the Columbus Police Officers.   \n165.  Mr. Burke’s cellphone video clearly shows that he remained on the grass at all \ntimes and did not enter the street. \n166.  Below is a true and accurate copy of that video (double click to play or click \n20200603_003718.mp4). \n \n40 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 41 of 81  PAGEID #: 41\n \n \n167.\n  When  he \nwas  within \nspeaking  distance \nof  the  Columbus \nPolice  Officers, \nMr.  Burke  asked, \n“What’s \nhappening”?  \n168.  A \nColumbus  Police \nOfficer,  later \nidentified  as \nDefendant Kenneth \nKirby,  approached \nMr.  Burke  and \nanswered,  “I’m \nsure  you  know \nyou’re  out  after \ncurfew, right?” \n \n41 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 42 of 81  PAGEID #: 42\n169.  Mr. Burke responded, “I live right here, I’m on my property.” \n170.  Defendant Kirby then said, “You’re standing on the street, come here.”   \n171.  Mr. Burke protested that he was “right here, I’m on the grass.”   \n172.  Defendant Kirby then stated that “it doesn’t matter, you’re under arrest” and \nfalsely told another officer that Mr. Burke was standing in the street. \n173.  An officer then used a zip tie to restrain Mr. Burke’s hands behind his back.   \n174.  Mr. Burke was then transported to a nearby fire station being used to process \nindividuals who had been arrested during the George Floyd protests.   \n175.  From the fire station, Mr. Burke was taken to the Jackson Pike Correctional \ncenter, where he was placed in a cell with other arrested individuals.   \n176.  In the cell where Mr. Burke was detained, there were many individuals who had \nbeen arrested for issues not related to the protest, including felonies and violent crimes.  \n177.   During his time in the cell, Mr. Burke witnessed an intensely violent fight, which \nwas terrifying and put him at risk of physical harm.   \n178.  Mr. Burke remained in the cell until early afternoon when his friend posted bail \nfor him.   \n179.  On Tuesday, June 9, 2020, Mr. Burke’s curfew violation charges were dismissed \nas part of the blanket dismissal of curfew violations. \nG.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Bernadette Calvey \n180.  On May 30, 2020, Ms. Calvey was in the Short North area, accompanied by a \nroommate. \n \n42 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 43 of 81  PAGEID #: 43\n181.  Although Ms. Calvey had not intended to participate in a protest, she and her \nroommate were walking in the vicinity of Second Avenue and High Street when they heard \nprotestors nearby. \n182.  They  walked in  the direction of the protests to see what  was  going  on and \npotentially join the protest since they agreed with the message against police brutality and \nracism. \n183.  Ms. Calvey was aware that there had been a curfew imposed that evening, but it \nwas approximately 9:00 p.m., she was not far from her residence, and the curfew would not start \nfor another hour. \n184.  As Ms. Calvey approached the protest, it appeared peaceful, though Columbus \nPolice Officers were massed in the street approximately 50 feet away from where she was \nstanding.   \n185.  The Columbus Police Officers were shouting at the protestors and began firing \nprojectiles at them at close range. \n186.  Within moments of approaching the protest, Ms. Calvey was struck in the face by \na projectile that, upon information and belief, was a wooden pellet.   \n187.  The wooden pellet split open her chin and caused excruciating pain. \n188.  The round that hit Ms. Calvey in the hand had been directly fired at her with the \nintention of hitting her and had not been “skip-fired” off the ground.  \n \n43 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 44 of 81  PAGEID #: 44\n189.  A  true  and  accurate  picture  of  her  injury  the  morning  after  is  below:\n \n44 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 45 of 81  PAGEID #: 45\n \n \n45 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 46 of 81  PAGEID #: 46\n190.  Ms. Calvey and her roommate fled down a side alley, where she received water \nand bandages from a group of protestors. \n191.  Ms. Calvey was forced to miss two days of work due to her facial injury and \nremained unable to chew solid food for approximately a week due to the pain in her jaw.   \n192.  The projectile wound has created a prominent scar on Ms. Calvey’s chin, which \nappears to be permanent. \nH.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Stephanie Carlock \n193.  In the late afternoon of Saturday, May 30, 2020, near the Statehouse, around \nBroad and High Streets, Ms. Carlock joined friends who were protesting against police brutality \nand racism. \n194.  When  Ms.  Carlock  arrived  at  the  protest,  non-emergency  traffic  had  been \nrerouted, and she and others were standing stationary in the crosswalk across High Street.   \n195.  Many  Columbus  Police  Officers  were  there  dressed  in  riot  gear,  but  no \nannouncements were made and no orders were given.  \n196.  While Ms. Carlock was standing stationary in the crosswalk, a Columbus Police \nOfficer in riot gear sprayed her in the face with pepper spray at close range with no provocation, \ncausing Ms. Carlock intense pain and affecting her vision. \n197.  Columbus  Police  Officers  began  pushing  the  crowd  of  people  in  which  Ms. \nCarlock was standing with their riot shields and telling them to leave.   \n198.  A van rolled up and many Columbus Police Officers or Franklin County Sheriff’s \nOffice Deputies left the van and began firing projectiles at the crowd. \n \n46 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 47 of 81  PAGEID #: 47\n199.  Ms. Carlock and her companions then moved to the Statehouse lawn, but mounted  \nColumbus  Police  Officers  approached  and  used  their  horses  to  push  the  crowd  out  of  the \nStatehouse area.   \n200.  Ms. Carlock moved onto Broad Street and began walking east, with mounted \nColumbus Police Officers following the crowd and using their horses to push it further down \nBroad Street. \n201.  Ms. Carlock and her companions reached the intersection of Broad Street and \nFifth Street and were standing on the sidewalk, next to the plaque recognizing the site of the first \nWendy’s restaurant.   \n202.  Columbus Police Officers were still pushing the crowd, and Ms. Carlock and \nothers were asking them where they wanted the protestors to go. \n203.  Instead of answering and directing the crowd, the mounted Columbus Police \nOfficers rode their horses onto the sidewalk and began pushing their horses into the crowd.   \n204.  Ms. Carlock was struck by the legs of horses purposely being ridden into her and \nother protestors. \n205.  Ms. Carlock and others in the crowd continued to walk to the next corner, at \nwhich point they were confronted by Columbus Police Officers on bicycles.   \n206.  These  officers  cornered  the  crowd  against  a  building,  on  the  sidewalk,  and \ndeployed tear gas, causing Ms. Carlock to choke and cough and have difficulty breathing. \n207.  Ms. Carlock and others asked the officers why they were tear-gassing a peaceful \ncrowd on a sidewalk, and, instead of answering, the officers laughed while the protestors choked \non the gas.   \n \n47 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 48 of 81  PAGEID #: 48\n208.  Ms. Carlock fled and rejoined protestors in another area. \n209.  The following evening, Sunday, May 31, at around 8 p.m., Ms. Carlock and a \nfriend went to the Short North area of Columbus, walking down High Street toward downtown, \non the sidewalk, seeking to join another protest against police brutality and racism.   \n210.  Ms. Carlock was aware there was a curfew of 10:00 p.m. that evening, but it was \nstill 40 minutes before curfew (approximately 9:20 p.m.), when the group she was in approached \nthe intersection of High Street and Spring Street.   \n211.  Ms. Carlock and the protestors she had joined were peaceful, walking on the \npublic sidewalk, and not disobeying any orders from law enforcement.  \n212.  As Ms. Carlock neared Spring Street, a black van pulled up and Columbus Police \nOfficers in riot gear jumped out.   \n213.  Without  warning,  the  officers  began  shooting  projectiles  and  tear  gas  at  the \ncrowd.   \n214.  Ms. Carlock was once again exposed to tear gas, affecting her breathing and \ncausing her to choke and cough. \nI.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Andrew Fahmy  \n215.  On  June  1,  2020,  Mr. Fahmy  and  a  friend  went  to  downtown  Columbus  to \nparticipate in the protests.   \n216.  They arrived at the Statehouse at 7:00 p.m. and then participated in a march north \non High Street along with several thousand other protestors.   \n217.  Eventually, at approximately 10:20 p.m., the march reached the intersection of \nLane Avenue and High Street just north of The Ohio State University. \n \n48 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 49 of 81  PAGEID #: 49\n218.  By the time the march had reached Lane Avenue, the number of marchers had \ndwindled considerably and the march seemed to be coming to an end. \n219.  As  the  marchers  approached  Lane  Avenue  on  High  Street,  Columbus  Police \nOfficers wearing riot gear approached the marchers from the south.   \n220.  When the Columbus Police Officers were within approximately 15 feet of the \nremaining marchers, they began spraying pepper spray.   \n221.  The pepper spraying caused the remaining marchers to run in all directions.  \n222.  Mr. Fahmy retreated east on Lane Avenue along with many other marchers.  \n223.  The  Columbus  Police  Officers  then  formed  a  line  across  Lane  Avenue \napproximately 200 feet east of High Street facing east. \n224.  Mr.  Fahmy  and  other  protestors  got  out  their  phones  and  began  filming  the \nColumbus Police Officers, who were approximately 20 feet away.   \n225.  None  of  the  protestors  was  behaving  violently  or  throwing  anything  at  the \nColumbus Police Officers.  \n226.  Mr. Fahmy then observed the Columbus Police Officers preparing to fire tear gas \ncanisters. \n227.  Before Mr. Fahmy could move out of the way, the Columbus Police Officers shot \ntear gas canisters directly into the crowd. \n228.  Mr. Fahmy was hit in the leg with a canister, which fractured his fibula, causing \nsevere pain, and requiring treatment; true and accurate pictures of his injuries, including an x-ray \nof the fracture, are shown below. \n \n49 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 50 of 81  PAGEID #: 50\n \n \n50 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 51 of 81  PAGEID #: 51\n \n51 \n \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 52 of 81  PAGEID #: 52\nJ.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Talon Garth    \n229.  On May 31, 2020, Mr. Garth attended a downtown protest of police abuse. \n230.  In the early evening, along with hundreds of other protestors, Mr. Garth was \nstanding in the street at the intersection of Broad and High Streets.   \n231.  That  intersection  and  several  blocks  had  long  been  closed  that  evening  to \nvehicular traffic.   \n232.  While Mr. Garth was standing at the intersection, a Columbus Division of Police \nArmored Vehicle with the word acronym SWAT painted on the side pulled into the intersection \nand stopped.   \n233.  After the armored SWAT vehicle stopped, a team of officers disembarked from it. \n234.  The SWAT officers began to tell the crowd standing at Broad and High Street to \nmove.   \n235.  Prior to the arrival of the SWAT officers, the protest at Broad and High had been \npeaceful, with no violence or attacks on property.   \n236.  Prior to the arrival of the SWAT officers, protestors at Broad and High had \nmaintained a good relationship with Ohio Highway Patrol Officers stationed at the Statehouse. \n237.  Because there was no vehicular traffic on Broad or High Streets, there was no \nreason for the protestors to be removed from the streets.   \n238.  After being told to move, Mr. Garth and more than 100 other protestors close to \nthe SWAT officers sat down on the street in an act of passive resistance. \n239.  Mr. Garth was then approximately ten feet away from the SWAT Officers.  \n \n52 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 53 of 81  PAGEID #: 53\n240.  At this point, a few individuals in the back of the huge crowd, who were not \namong those sitting close to the SWAT officers, threw several water bottles at them.   \n241.  It was obvious that the bottles had not been thrown by Mr. Garth or any of the \nprotestors sitting in front of the SWAT officers. \n242.  Nevertheless, the SWAT Officers immediately took deliberate aim and began \nfiring wooden pellets directly into the peaceful seated protestors who were sitting directly in \nfront of them. \n243.  The wooden pellets were around the size of pill bottles.   \n244.  Mr. Garth was struck by a total of ten wooden pellets, one on each knee, four on \nhis right leg, one on his right thigh, one in the arm, and one in the back of his head. \n245.  A wooden pellet also struck Mr. Garth in the foot, fracturing his fourth metatarsal \nbone.  \n246.  True and accurate pictures of his leg and foot injuries are below.   \n \n \n53 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 54 of 81  PAGEID #: 54\n \n \n54 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 55 of 81  PAGEID #: 55\n \n247.  Mr. Garth had to seek medical attention for his fractured foot and has been \nrequired to wear a walking boot while it heals.   \n \n55 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 56 of 81  PAGEID #: 56\n248.  In addition to breaking his foot, the wooden pellets caused severe lacerations to \nhis shins and other parts of his body, many of which are likely to cause permanent scarring.   \n249.  As a proximate result of his injuries, Mr. Garth has been unable to work since the \nincident and has suffered significant lost income.  \nK.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Eva Heyer \n250.  Around 7:00 p.m. on May 28, 2020, Ms. Heyer joined a group of protestors in a \nmarch  from  the  King-Lincoln  area  of  Columbus  to  downtown  Columbus,  where  she  and \napproximately 100 other protestors continued protesting in the intersection of Broad and High. \n251.  At approximately 8:35 p.m., shortly after the group arrived at that intersection,  \nColumbus Police Officers in regular uniforms of white shirts and trousers formed a line north of \nthe intersection to prevent protestors from marching north up High. \n252.  Columbus Police Officers had blocked off the intersection with four vehicles and \nwere also blocking sidewalks north of the intersection. \n253.  Prior to the arrival of the Columbus Police Officers, the protest has been peaceful. \n254.  Upon  their  arrival,  though,  some  of  the  Columbus  Police  Officers  became \naggressive  with  protestors,  and,  as  truly  and  accurately  depicted  in  the  video  posted  at \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npXL2-NT1Zs pepper spray was used on small sections of \nthe protestors and one protestor was punched. A true and accurate copy of that video is provided \nbelow (double click to play or click the link). \n \n \n \n \n56 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 57 of 81  PAGEID #: 57\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n255.  Because of the placement of the police cars and the way streets and sidewalks \nwere blocked, protestors began to feel that they were being pinned in the intersection.  \n256.  At around 10:00  p.m.,  most of the Columbus Police Officers who had been \nkeeping order were replaced with Officers wearing riot gear. \n257.  Columbus Police Officers then announced that an emergency had been declared \nand the protestors had to disperse. \n258.  From what Ms. Heyer observed, the vast majority of the protestors had remained \npeaceful,  shouting  chants,  including  profanity,  singing,  carrying  protest  signs,  and  making \ngestures such as keeping their hands up or sitting down. \n259.  Two African-American protestors had megaphones and were leading the chants \nand singing. \n260.  One of the chants was, “Whose streets?  Our streets.” \n \n57 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 58 of 81  PAGEID #: 58\n261.  Apart from the desire of Columbus Police Officers to regain control of the streets, \nthere was no apparent emergency. \n262.  Traffic on Broad and High had long been diverted. \n263.  Columbus Police Officers had blocked off the intersection with four vehicles and \nwere also blocking sidewalks north of the intersection. \n264.  The  sidewalks  south  of  the  intersection  were  crowded  with  protestors  and \ncomplying with the dispersal order was difficult due to the crowds being wedged in and unable \nto move. \n265.  Ms. Heyer observed Columbus Police Officers shaking pepper-spray cans and \nexpected that they were going to use them on the protestors. \n266.  Because she was directly in the line of fire, Ms. Heyer removed her contact lenses \nand put them in her pocket. \n267.  Ms. Heyer was pepper-sprayed and, though she blocked most of it with the sign \nshe was carrying, was hit in her eyes and moved to the rear for medical attention. \n268.  Protestors soon reported hearing a Columbus Police Officer point at the two \nAfrican-American protestors with megaphones and telling the Officers to neutralize them. \n269.  A call came for “white” protestors to link arms into a human chain to shield the \ntwo African-American protestors. \n270.  Ms. Heyer re-entered the intersection to join the human chain, and she stood \nabout a foot away from a Columbus Police Officer. \n271.  At that time, Ms. Heyer was linking arms with other protestors, and neither she \nnor they were touching Columbus Police Officers or pushing forward. \n \n58 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 59 of 81  PAGEID #: 59\n272.  The Columbus Police Officer in front of Ms. Heyer raised his pepper-spray can \nless than three feet away from her eyes and sprayed her. \n273.  The pepper spray hurt Ms. Heyer so much that she bent over to touch her face and \neyes and protestors helped her move to sit down and get medical attention; her eyes were \ncompletely swollen shut, and she could not see for ten minutes or so. \n274.  Ms. Heyer attended another day of protest on May 30, 2020 on Broad Street \ndowntown, where she was ultimately injured by wooden pellets shot at and/or near protestors \nwho were standing and chanting about twenty-feet away from a line of police. \nL.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Randy Kaigler \n275.  On Friday, May 29, 2020, at  approximately 7:30  p.m.,  Plaintiff Kaigler was \ndriving through downtown Columbus when he observed a peaceful protest in process near the \nintersection of Broad and High Streets. \n276.  Because he believed in the message of the protest, Mr. Kaigler decided to join it, \nparking his car and proceeding on foot towards the intersection of Broad and High Streets. \n277.  While walking to the protest, Mr. Kaigler observed a group of Columbus Police \nOfficers standing on Broad Street across the street from the Ohio Statehouse. \n278.  The Columbus Police Officers observed by Mr. Kaigler did not appear to be \nengaged in crowd-control activities or carrying crowd-control paraphernalia but rather were \nmilling around a cruiser with ample room in the street to move. \n279.   When Mr. Kaigler observed the Columbus Police Officers, Broad Street was \nclosed to vehicle traffic and officers and protestors were in the street. \n280.  The protest was loud but peaceful.   \n \n59 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 60 of 81  PAGEID #: 60\n281.  Upon  seeing  the  Columbus  Police  Officers,  Mr.  Kaigler  decided  to  make  a \npolitical statement: he walked within approximately five feet of them, stopped and raised his \narms in a “hands up, don’t shoot” position and stated to the officers “I can’t breathe.” \n282.  The “hands up, don’t shoot” gesture originated at protests after the August 9, \n2014, shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and displayed a common sign of \nsubmission which communicated that a suspect was not presenting a threat and, like Brown’s \nalleged conduct, should not be shot.   \n283.  The statement “I can’t breathe” is a reference to the 2014 killing of Eric Garner \nand 2020 killing of George Floyd. \n284.  The Columbus Police Officers who observed and heard Mr. Kaigler knew the \norigin and meaning of those phrases. \n285.  The sun was out, and the area around Mr. Kaigler was well lit.  \n286.  Mr. Kaigler did not have any sort of weapon, and his empty hands were clearly \nvisible to the officers.   \n287.  Mr. Kaigler’s political statement did not cause any alarm or concern about their \nsafety for the group of Columbus Police Officers; indeed, when Mr. Kaigler was pepper-sprayed, \nthe other Columbus Police Officers appeared nonchalant. \n288.  After Mr. Kaigler made his statement, one of the officers, later identified as \nDefendant  Gitlitz,  casually  drew  a  canister  of  mace  or  pepper  spray  and,  without  audible \nwarning, sprayed Mr. Kaigler directly in the face at point blank range.  \n289.  This  true  and  accurate  copy  of  a  photograph  posted  by  @Cheesemaman \naccurately depicts Defendant Gitlitz pepper-spraying Mr. Kaigler: \n \n60 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 61 of 81  PAGEID #: 61\n \n61 \n \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 62 of 81  PAGEID #: 62\n290.  After he was sprayed, Mr. Kaigler was blinded, could not breathe, and was in \nintense pain.   \n291.  Other protestors around Mr. Kaigler assisted him to a first-aid station, where his \neyes were rinsed.   \nM.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Rebecca Lamey \n292.  On May 31, 2020, Ms. Lamey, along with two friends, participated in a peaceful \nprotest for hours. \n293.  At 7:54 p.m., Columbus Police Officers abruptly decided to stop the protest. \n294.  At that point, Ms. Lamey and other protestors were on their knees, with their \nhands up, on the sidewalk. \n295.  Columbus Police Officers ordered the protestors to leave and appeared to be ready \nto use force against them. \n296.  Protestors started running in fear of the force, with some getting knocked down \nand trampled. \n297.  Ms. Lamey and her two friends hung back to avoid getting separated or knocked \ndown. \n298.  Ms. Lamey was filming on her cellphone, which she was holding well above her \nwaist, and walking backwards while keeping an eye on her friends. \n299.  A  Columbus  Police  Officer  turned  the  corner  and,  without  warning,  shot  a \nwooden pellet at Ms. Lamey, hitting her hand, knocking the cellphone to the ground. \n \n62 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 63 of 81  PAGEID #: 63\n300.  When Ms. Lamey bent over to pick up her cellphone, she was shot four more \ntimes; around the same time, her friend was hit by wooden pellets in the back of the head, neck, \nand upper arm. \n301.  Based on the location where the wooden pellet hit Ms. Lamey, it must have been \ndirectly fired at her, rather than “skip-fired” off the ground. \n302.  Ms. Lamey and a friend ran to a building half a block away, and he left the stairs \nthere to get some ice for her injury. \n303.  Moments after the friend returned with the ice and applied it to Ms. Lamey’s \nhand, he screamed, “Get behind the pillar!,” as several unmarked vans approached. \n304.  The  van  doors  opened  and  two  Columbus  Police  Officers  opened  fire  with \nwooden pellets on Ms. Lamey, her friend, and two others, striking them. \n305.  A true and accurate video of the moment Ms. Lamey was hit by the wooden \npellets  (double  click  to  play  or  click \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/dmu6uucrkhxmkim/Video.MOV?dl=0)  and  true  and  accurate \npictures of the swelling on Ms. Lamey’s hand and wrist and a wooden pellet which had been \nfired by Columbus Police Officers are below. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n63 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 64 of 81  PAGEID #: 64\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n64 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 65 of 81  PAGEID #: 65\n \n306.  The swelling took so long to go down and the pain remained so bad that Ms. \nLamey went to an Emergency Room a few days later, had X-rays, and learned that no bones \nwere broken. \n307.  Ms. Lamey has not yet recovered the full use of her hand. \nN.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Nadia Lynch \n308.  On  Saturday,  May  30,  2020,  at  approximately  11:30  a.m.,  Ms.  Lynch  was \nattending the protest at the intersection of Broad and High Streets in downtown Columbus. \n309.  The intersection had been taken over by Columbus Police Officers, who had \nformed a box at the intersection with lines of officers facing protestors. \n \n65 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 66 of 81  PAGEID #: 66\n310.  The intersection had long been closed to vehicular traffic that afternoon, and \nmany Columbus Police Officers were milling around in the middle of the street. \n311.  The Columbus Police Officers facing the protestors were wearing black helmets, \nblack gas masks, and black military style tactical clothing. \n312.  Ms. Lynch stepped up to greet other protestors on the other side of the police line, \ntaking a photo of other protestors and displaying the sign she had brought to the event. \n313.  Columbus Police Officers then began forming a line with their bicycles right next \nto Ms. Lynch, and she realized she was in a bad position.  \n314.  Ms. Lynch then decided to go around and started walking back to her group of \nfriends.  \n315.  Ms. Lynch was grabbed by the backpack she was wearing by Defendant Officer \nHolly Kanode and thrown down to the ground, causing her head to hit the ground.  \n316.  Three or more officers began to attack Ms. Lynch. \n317.  Ms. Lynch laid there, while they placed her hands behind her back and zip-tied \nthem.  \n318.  Before using force on her, no officer ever said anything to Ms. Lynch or yelled \nany commands. \n319.  All of these events took place in an open, well lit, and relatively calm area. \n320.  Ms. Lynch did not at any time pose a threat to a police officer or resist arrest.  \n321.  Ms. Lynch was grabbed so quickly that, even if an order had been given to her, \nshe would not have had time to comply with it. \n \n66 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 67 of 81  PAGEID #: 67\n322.  Ms. Lynch was then arrested and taken to Jackson Pike where she was slated and \nspent two hours in jail before she bonded out.   \n323.  Ms.  Lynch  suffered  physical  injuries  due  to  the  assault  and  damage  to  her \nphysical property. \n324.  Defendant Kanode had Ms. Lynch arrested for disorderly conduct and resisting \narrest and later formally filed those criminal charges. \n325.  In order to charge Ms. Lynch with resisting arrest, Defendant Kanode falsely \nswore, under oath, that Ms. Lynch grabbed an officer and took him to the ground.  \n   326.        In addition to her false charges, Officer Kanode further submitted a police \nreport with the ludicrous claim that Ms. Lynch had grabbed an unknown Officer by his riot gear \nand threw him to the ground.  \n   327.  Video footage of the incident conclusively and accurately shows that Ms. Lynch \nnever  engaged  in  any  such  conduct  and  that  Officer  Kanode’s  account  was  a  complete \nfabrication.  \n328.         In order to  charge Ms.  Lynch with disorderly  conduct,  Defendant  Kanode \nfalsely swore, under oath, that Ms. Lynch had thrown water-filled bottles at police officers.  \n   329.  Video footage of the incident conclusively and accurately shows that Ms. Lynch \nnever engaged throwing bottles; a true and accurate copy of the video is shown below (double \nclick to play or click https://www.dropbox.com/s/nr6t9y2ph8yydv7/IMG_0113.mov?dl=0). \n \n \n \n \n67 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 68 of 81  PAGEID #: 68\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n68 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 69 of 81  PAGEID #: 69\n330.  When she charged Ms. Lynch, Defendant Kanode was aware that she had used \nexcessive force in arresting her. \n331.  Defendant Kanode falsified criminal charges to justify and cover up her excessive \nuse of force against Ms. Lynch. \n332.  When she falsified charges against Ms. Lynch, Defendant Kanode was aware that \nbeing  convicted  of  a  charge  involving  an  assault  on  an  officer  could  lead  to  significant \nimprisonment, a large fine, and a debilitating criminal record. \nO.    Mistreatment of Plaintiff Aleta Mixon  \n333.  On the evening of Friday, May 29, 2020, Ms. Mixon was aware that her oldest \ndaughter, who is 20 years old, was attending a protest against police brutality in downtown \nColumbus. \n334.  After dropping a younger daughter at a different event, Ms. Mixon learned that \nthe protests her oldest daughter was attending might become dangerous.   \n335.  Ms. Mixon unsuccessfully attempted to contact her daughter by telephone and \ndrove toward downtown Columbus. \n336.  Ms. Mixon had trouble driving to the vicinity where she believed her daughter \nwas and ultimately, around 9:00 p.m., parked her car on State Street, near the Ohio Statehouse. \n337.  Ms. Mixon left her vehicle to attempt to find her daughter and saw that Columbus \nDivision of Police officers in riot gear were massing in the street. \n338.  Ms. Mixon approached a white female officer who was not in riot gear and was \nstanding separate from the officers who were massing and began to ask the female officer for \nassistance in locating her daughter.   \n \n69 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 70 of 81  PAGEID #: 70\n339.  As the female officer was about to reply to her request, a white male Columbus \nPolice officer charged toward her and sprayed her in the face with pepper spray.   \n340.  The female officer confronted the male officer and said words to the effect of, \n“Why the fuck did you do that? She was just asking for help.”   \n341.  Ms. Mixon began screaming from the pain of the pepper spray and calling for \nrelief. \n342.  Two white male officers then approached and sprayed Ms. Mixon again.  \n343.   Ms. Mixon fell to a seated position on the ground from the effects of the pepper \nspray, and she was sitting out of the street, on the sidewalk, still calling for help.  \n344.  One of the white male officers continued spraying her, and she attempted to stand. \n345.  As Ms. Mixon attempted to stand up, the officer shoved her off the sidewalk and \nover the curb.   \n346.  Ms. Mixon felt intense pain and a snap in her leg.   \n347.  The officer who had shoved Ms. Mixon then stood over her and told her, “That’s \nwhat you get for your protest, bitch,” and he stepped hard on her knee, before walking away. \n348.  Another white male officer who had not been involved in the use of excessive \nforce arrived and assisted Ms. Mixon, calling an ambulance and giving her advice for dealing \nwith the effects of the spray. \n349.  Ms. Mixon was transported to Grant Hospital, where she was given X-rays and \ntold she needed emergency surgery due to critical tears in a major tendon in her leg.   \n350.  The X-rays also showed that Ms. Mixon’s  kneecap had been shattered, with \nmultiple fractures in the bone. \n \n70 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 71 of 81  PAGEID #: 71\n351.  Ms. Mixon’s surgery was delayed until May 31, 2020, due to the urgent medical \nneeds of others injured in the protests.  \n352.  Ms. Mixon was hospitalized until Tuesday, June 2, 2020, after which she was \nreleased, with significant restrictions on her mobility.  \n353.  Ms. Mixon is uncertain whether she will recover full use of her leg, and she \nexpects to be unable to work for a period of several months or longer; true and accurate picture \nof her leg post-surgery, including permanent scarring, is shown below. \n \n71 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 72 of 81  PAGEID #: 72\n \n \n72 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 73 of 81  PAGEID #: 73\nP.  Mistreatment of Plaintiff Darrell Mullen \n354.  On Tuesday, June 2, 2020, at around 1:30 a.m., Darrell Mullen was walking by \nhimself northbound on the sidewalk on the east side of North High Street.   \n355.  Mr. Mullen was walking home from a friend’s house on Oakland Avenue to his \nresidence on Findley Avenue.   \n356.  On May 30, 2020, Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther had issued an executive \norder instituting a city-wide curfew which required most residents to remain indoors from 10 \np.m. to 6 a.m. and was to remain in effect until he rescinded it.  \n357.   The executive order stated that being outside in violation of the curfew was an \nunspecified degree misdemeanor. \n358.  As  of  the  time  that  Mr.  Mullen  was  walking  home,  North  High  Street  was \ndeserted.   \n359.  Near the intersection of High Street and Oakland Avenue, Mr. Mullen observed \nfour or five police cars drive past him going northbound on High Street.  \n   360.  Upon observing the police cars, Mr. Mullen made no effort to flee and continued \nwalking northbound on High Street. \n361.  Mr. Mullen then observed at least one of the police cars execute a U-turn and \ndrive towards him. \n362.  Again, Mr. Mullen made no attempt to flee and watched the police vehicle drive \nup to him. \n363.  At this point, a Columbus Police Officer, later identified as Thomas Hammel, got \nout of the police cruiser and began running at Mr. Mullen. \n \n73 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 74 of 81  PAGEID #: 74\n364.  At no time did any Columbus Police Officer order Mr. Mullen to stop, give Mr. \nMullen any verbal commands, or inform Mr. Mullen that he was under arrest.   \n365.  Instead, Officer Hammel violently tackled Mr. Mullen, taking him face down on \nthe sidewalk, and then applied pressure to the back of his head, grinding his face into the \npavement. \n366.  Shortly after that tackling, two more officers got on top of Mr. Mullen and began \nstriking his back and legs with their knees. \n367.  Mr. Mullen was quickly handcuffed, but officers continued to apply pressure to \nhis back and legs, with Officer Hammel continuing to apply pressure to the back and side of his \nneck, pushing his face into the ground and preventing him from talking. \n368.  When he was finally able to talk, Mr. Mullen told the officers that he had just \nbeen walking home, and Officer Hammel replied, “I know exactly where you live, is your \ngirlfriend out of jail yet?”   \n369.  As a proximate result of the excessive use of force, Mr. Mullen suffered facial \nabrasions, bruising, and a significant injury to his leg that left him unable to walk. \n370.  A true and accurate picture of his facial injuries is below: \n \n74 \n \n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 1 Filed: 07/08/20 Page: 75 of 81  PAGEID #: 75\n \n371.

On Friday, June 5, 2020, a lawsuit was filed against Defendant City alleging that \nthe indefinite, city-wide curfew was unconstitutional.   \n378.  Hours after the lawsuit was filed, Mayor Ginther rescinded the curfew.  \n379.

As some people dispersed, Ms. Wise was standing next to a Black woman who \nwas being pepper sprayed and attempted to shield her. \n386.  While attempting to protect her fellow peaceful protestor, Ms. Wise was assaulted \nby a Columbus Police Officer who used the space in between his thumb and index finger to press \nhis hand into her throat and push her back. \n387.  Near the same time, Ms. Wise was being assaulted by a Columbus Police Officer \nwho was pushing his bicycle into her and others.  \n388.  Ms. Wise and others fell to the ground and Columbus Police Officers continued \npepper spraying them as they lay there attempting to cover themselves.  \n389.  Columbus Police Officers then pulled out a vial of a brown liquid that they began \npouring into the eyes and faces of Ms. Wise and others.  \n390.

Defendant City of Columbus,  including its  Division  of Police,  is  restrained from  using  non-lethal \nforce,  including tear gas,  pepper spray, flash-bang grenades,  rubber bullets, wooden  pellets,  batons, \nbody slams,  pushing or  pulling,  or  kettling’,  on  nonviolent  protestors to  enforce  dispersal  orders, traffic \nlaws,  such  as  clearing the  streets  or sidewalks,  and/or misdemeanors, that were  not  committed with \nactual  or imminently threatened  physical  harm  or property destruction  or with  attempted  or actual \ncriminal  trespass  on private property  or  secured  government buildings/facilities,  areas,  or \nstructures; \n2.  Defendant  City of Columbus,  including its  Division of Police, is  required to  recognize that, for \npurposes  of the  injunction,  “nonviolent  protestors”  includes  individuals who  are  chanting,  verbally \nconfronting  police,  sitting,  holding their hands up when  approaching police,  occupying sidewalks or \nstreets,  apart from  expressways  or freeways,  and/or passively  resisting  police orders  in connection \nwith the  exercise  of rights  of free  speech  and  association under the  First Amendment; \n3.  Defendant City of Columbus,  including its  Division  of Police,  may only enforce  dispersal  orders, \ntraffic  laws,  such  as  clearing the  streets or sidewalks, and/or misdemeanors  in  a  manner and  under the \ncircumstances  described  in  Paragraph  1 against  nonviolent protestors, to the extent  practicable, through \ncitations  or arrests,  based on  probable cause. \n4.  Defendant City of Columbus,  including its  Division  of Police,  is  prohibited from  using the \ninfliction  of pain  to  punish or deter “nonviolent protestors”  and  is  directed to  avoid  infliction  of pain on \nany  nonviolent  protestor when  incidental to a  use of force  necessary to  prevent or effectuate  an  arrest \nfor crimes  committed  involving the  actual  or imminent threat of physical  harm  or property  destruction \nor attempted  or actual  criminal trespass on  private  property or secured  government  buildings/facilities, \nareas, or structures, and/or when  arresting,  based  on  probable  cause,  an  individual  who  allegedly \ncommitted  such  an  offense.  For  purposes of this order and this  provision,  reasonable  incidental  contact \nwith  individuals  in  connection  with  entering  into or moving through  a  crowd to  effect an arrest does  not \nconstitute the  infliction of pain to  punish or deter  nonviolent protestor action  and does  not violate \nParagraph  1 of this Agreed Order. \n5,  Defendant City of Columbus,  including its  Division  of Police,  must  ensure that body and vehicle \ncameras  are  in  good working order and  used  during  every  interaction  with  “nonviolent  protestors”  and \nbadge  numbers  and/or identity cards are prominently displayed  in  each such  interaction,  even  when  riot \ngear is  being worn.  Plain  clothes  or undercover officers,  are  not required to  wear  a body  worn \n 1For purposes  o f this  agreement,  “kettling”  is  defined  as  a tactic  where  law enforcement  officers \nsurround  a crowd  of nonviolent  protestors  who  have  been ordered to  disperse  in a manner which \nprohibits  them  from  having  a reasonable  route  of exit  (such as  an  unobstructed  sidewalk,  street, \nor alley)  to  comply  with the  dispersal  order.\nCase:  2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ  Doc  #:  85-1  Filed:  12/22/21  Page:  11  of  11  PAGEID  #:  6632 \ncamera,  but  shall  not  engage  in enforcement action,  including,  but not  limited to,  arresting  or \ndetaining  a suspect,  or using  force,  unless  exigent  circumstances  of actual  or  imminently \nthreatened  physical  harm  to  officers  or  others  exist; \n6.  Defendant City of Columbus,  including its  Division  of Police,  must recognize that individuals \nlegitimately displaying  “press,”  “media,”  “reporter,”  “paramedic,”  “medic,”  “legal  observer,”  or similar \nwords and/or symbols  are  permitted to  be  present  in a  position enabling them to  record  at  protests \nand/or to  intervene to assist  individuals who  appear to  have  been  injured  so  long  as  their presence \ndoes  not physically  interfere  with  a  lawful  arrest,  involve entering  a  closed  or  cordoned-off \ncrime  scene,  or physically  interfere  with  medical  aid  already  being rendered  by  an officer or  an \nEMT/Firefighter and that all  individuals,  regardless  of their occupation  or nonviolent activity, are \npermitted to  record  at  protests or whenever any  police  officer  interacts with the  public;  and \n7.  Defendant City of Columbus’  Division  of Police  must  request that mutual  aid  law enforcement \npersonne! who  cooperate with  them adhere to the foregoing  restraints or standards  on the  use of non- \nlethal  force  and  enforcement,  infliction  of pain,  cameras and  identification, and  recognition  of \n“nonviolent  protestors”  and  individuals assisting or observing them.  If a mutual  aid  entity  does  not \nhave  body  worn  cameras,  its  personnel  must  either be  assigned  to  peripheral  traffic  control \noperations  where  interaction with protestors  during  actual  protests  are  unlikely  or,  if the  mutual \naid request  relates  to  SWAT  or other similar tactical  units,  mutual  aid personnel  must  be \nembedded  with CPD  officers that have  body  worn  cameras,  and  who  are  recording  in accordance \nwith this  Order and  Columbus  Division  of Police  Directives.\n\n############# Old Text on 20240828 ###############\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 85-1 Filed: 12/22/21 Page: 1 of 11  PAGEID #: 6622\nExhibit A\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 85-1 Filed: 12/22/21 Page: 2 of 11  PAGEID #: 6623\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 85-1 Filed: 12/22/21 Page: 3 of 11  PAGEID #: 6624\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 85-1 Filed: 12/22/21 Page: 4 of 11  PAGEID #: 6625\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 85-1 Filed: 12/22/21 Page: 5 of 11  PAGEID #: 6626\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 85-1 Filed: 12/22/21 Page: 6 of 11  PAGEID #: 6627\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 85-1 Filed: 12/22/21 Page: 7 of 11  PAGEID #: 6628\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 85-1 Filed: 12/22/21 Page: 8 of 11  PAGEID #: 6629\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 85-1 Filed: 12/22/21 Page: 9 of 11  PAGEID #: 6630\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 85-1 Filed: 12/22/21 Page: 10 of 11  PAGEID #: 6631\n\nCase: 2:20-cv-03431-ALM-KAJ Doc #: 85-1 Filed: 12/22/21 Page: 11 of 11  PAGEID #: 6632",
