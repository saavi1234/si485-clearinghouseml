    "summary": "<p>On March 11, 2021, the NAACP and several individuals filed this class-action lawsuit against the city of San Jose and public officials in the United States Northern District Court of California. The plaintiffs stated that they were peacefully protesting police brutality and institutionalized racism on May 29-31, 2020 when San Jose police fired impact munitions and attacked them with flash-bang grenades, chemical weapons, and batons. The plaintiffs contended that the defendants had exhibited a long history of targeting Black, Brown, and Muslim communities and that the use of force in these protests was racially motivated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sued under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, alleging that the defendants violated their First Amendment rights to free speech and association, their Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unlawful arrest and excessive force, and their Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection. The plaintiffs brought similar claims under state constitution equivalents of these provisions. The plaintiffs also brought claims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, arguing that the defendants&rsquo; policing practices failed to make reasonable modifications that allowed people with disabilities to participate in protests. Finally, the plaintiffs sued under a variety of state laws, including tort claims like assault and negligence. The lawsuit sought declaratory relief stating that the defendants&rsquo; policing practices were unconstitutional, as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining the defendants from engaging in the same behavior in the future. The class members also sought compensatory damages.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Phyllis Jean Hamilton of the Northern District of California.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 7, 2021, the defendants moved to dismiss the suit, making arguments for qualified immunity, lack of supervisory liability, and failure to state plausible claims under the various constitutional provisions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 24, 2021, the court dismissed the plaintiffs&rsquo; Fourteenth Amendment claims that they were targeted on the basis of race and denied &ldquo;freedom of movement.&rdquo; It likewise dismissed a curfew-related claim under the First Amendment with regard to most, but not all, defendants. The court also dismissed the plaintiffs&rsquo; claim that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to violate their constitutional rights. However, the court largely denied the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss, and it specifically decided to delay its assessment of whether the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity until summary judgment so as to permit factual development in discovery.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, thirteen of the plaintiffs&rsquo; causes of action persisted. These causes of action included the plaintiffs&rsquo; requests for injunctive and declaratory relief, which were not at issue in the motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs&rsquo; state law claims also remained, as did some claims under the First Amendment, claims under the Fourth Amendment for excessive force and wrongful arrest, an allegation of failure to intervene, an alleged violation of the ADA, tort claims for assault and battery, certain of the plaintiffs&rsquo; cause of action for false arrest, and an action for negligence.</p>\r\n<p>On February 23, 2023, the court held a hearing on the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for class certification. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, amending the plaintiffs and defendants to the case and removing three counts as claims for relief on February 27, 2023.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 7, 2023, Judge Hamiliton denied certifying the plaintiffs as a class because the plaintiffs did not show that common issues would predominate over individual issues and that the defendants&rsquo; conduct did not generally apply to the class.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants, on April 14, 2023, filed a motion for summary judgment. In the motion, the defendants alleged that the plaintiffs excessive force claims are a product of guesswork, they have no evidence to suggest their First Amendment claims, they have not indicated one federal disability law that was not accommodated, and their state claims fail for the same reasons their federal claims purportedly fail.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Judge Hamilton, on August 3, 2023, Judge Hamiliton granted in part and denied in part the defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgment, considering the various claims alleged by the various plaintiffs against each of the defendants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 7, 2023, Judge Hamilton set a settlement conference before Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler. On August 23, 2023, the case settled as to one plaintiff, and the other four plaintiffs presented proposals of settlement to each other that were to be presented to the City Council on August 29, 2023.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 29, 2023, the entire case settled before Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler, subject to ordinary contingency of final approval by the governing authorities. The Clearinghouse was unable to find the settlement agreement; however, the <a href=\"https://www.justiceonline.org/news/san-jose-city-council-oks-3-35-million-settlement-for-five-racial-justice-protestors-attacked-by-san-jose-police/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Partnership for Civil Justice Fund</a> indicated that the San Jose City Council approved a $3.35 million settlement on September 12, 2023.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs, on October 19, 2023, filed a stipulation for dismissal, dismissing the action with prejudice. All parties were to bear their own costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case is closed.&nbsp;</p>",

DISCOVERY, AND SEALING \n8   \nCITY OF SAN JOSE, et al.,  Re: Dkt. No. 87, 101, 102 \n9 \nDefendants. \n10   \n \n11    \n a  12  Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification came on for hearing on February 23, 2023.  \nurtni\noor 13  Plaintiffs appeared through their counsel, Mitchell Engel, Rachel Lederman, and Tammy \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  Webb.  Defendants appeared through their counsel, Matthew Pritchard.  Also before the \nDict  15  court are the parties’ discovery letter brief and plaintiffs’ motion to seal.  Having read the \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  papers filed by the parties and carefully considered their arguments and relevant \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  authority, and good cause appearing, the court hereby rules as follows. \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  BACKGROUND \nN\n19    This is a civil rights case arising out of the May 2020 protests in response to the \n20  killing of George Floyd by police.  Specifically, on May 29 and 30, 2020, plaintiffs \n21  participated in protests in San Jose to “express their view that police brutality and \n22  institutionalized racism must end,” and now “seek redress for the violation of their \n23  constitutional rights to assemble, protest, and be free from racial discrimination, disability \n24  discrimination, excessive force, and wrongful arrest.”  Dkt. 108, ¶¶ 2, 3.1 \n25    There are two organization plaintiffs and eleven individual plaintiffs in this case.  \n26 \n \n1 At the time that the class certification motion was filed, plaintiffs had been granted leave \n27 \nto file an amended complaint to substitute Doe defendants.  See Dkt. 81.  Plaintiffs filed a \nproposed amended complaint, which was ultimately filed as the operative complaint.  See \n28 \nDkt. 94, 108.  This order will cite to the currently-operative version of the complaint.   \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 113   Filed 04/07/23   Page 2 of 13\n \n1  The organization plaintiffs are (1) the National Association for the Advancement of \n2  Colored People of San Jose/Silicon Valley, and (2) the San Jose Peace and Justice \n3  Center.  Dkt. 108, ¶¶ 14-15.  There are eleven individual plaintiffs, not all of whom are \n4  proposed class representatives.  For purposes of this section, only the proposed class \n5  representatives will be discussed.   \n6    The first proposed class representative is Joseph Cañas.  Dkt. 108, ¶ 20.  Cañas \n7  was at the protest on May 29, 2020, playing a guitar, when he was shot in the eye by an \n8  impact munition (also referred to as “projectile impact weapon,” or “PIW”).  Id. \n9    The second proposed class representative is Leslie Vasquez.  Dkt. 108, ¶ 21.  \n10  Vasquez attended the May 29, 2020 protest and was shot in the groin, thighs, and genital \n11  area, and bludgeoned in the stomach with a baton as she stood with her hands up.  Id. \n a  12    The third proposed class representative is Peter Allen.  Dkt. 108, ¶ 22.  Allen \nurtni\noor 13  attended the protest on May 29, 2020, and was pushed to the ground and repeatedly \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  shot with impact munitions.  Id.  Allen alleges that he was backing away when he was \nDict  15  shoved to the ground by an officer with his baton, then shoved to the ground again when \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  he tried to get up and back away.  Id., ¶ 111.  Allen alleges that he was again attempting \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  to retreat when he was shot in the thigh and in the chest with PIW.  Id., ¶ 112-113.   \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18    The fourth proposed class representative is Shaunn Cartwright.  Dkt. 108, ¶ 23.  \nN\n19  Cartwright was shot in the knee, calf, and finger with PIW on May 30, 2020.  Id. \n20    The fifth proposed class representative is Yessica Riles.  Dkt. 108, ¶ 24.  On May \n21  29, Riles was shot with PIW in the abdomen while her hands were up in a ‘don’t shoot’ \n22  gesture.  Id., ¶ 78.   \n23    The sixth proposed class representative is Gustavo Flores.  Dkt. 108, ¶ 25.  Flores \n24  was present at the May 29, 2020 protest, and “tried to warn the other demonstrators, \n25  walking down the front line of demonstrators suggesting that they put their hands up in a \n26  gesture of ‘don’t shoot’ to show they were unarmed [and] did not pose a threat.”  Id., ¶ 82.  \n27  While Flores was doing so,  a San Jose police officer “shot him in the groin and testicle \n28  with an impact munition.”  Id.  Flores fell to the ground, and as he got up, he saw the \n2 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 113   Filed 04/07/23   Page 3 of 13\n \n1  officer reloading his gun.  Id., ¶ 83.  As Flores was trying to walk away, someone warned \n2  that the officer was aiming at him again, and when Flores turned to look, the officer shot \n3  him in his left collarbone with another impact munition.  Id. \n4  The seventh proposed class representative is Cindy Cuellar.  Dkt. 108, ¶ 28.  \n5  Cuellar attended the May 29, 2020 protest and saw officers “shoot impact munitions into \n6  the crowd,” hitting a friend of hers who is a journalist.  Id., ¶ 71.  When Cuellar went to \n7  her friend’s aid, an officer shot her in her left calf.  Id. \n8  There are four other plaintiffs who are proceeding only as individuals, not as class \n9  representatives: Michael Acosta, Joseph Maldonado, Mahmoudreza Naemeh, and \n10  Megan Swift.   \n11    The defendants are as follows: the City of San Jose, David Sykes (city manager of \n a  12  San Jose), Edgardo Garcia (police chief of the SJPD), Christopher Knopf (SJPD \nurtni\noor 13  assistant chief of police), Jason Dwyer (SJPD caption and the ‘special operations \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  commander’ during the May 2020 protests), Brian Matchett (SJPD lieutenant), Steve \nDict  15  Lagorio (SJPD lieutenant), Ronnie Lopez (SJPD sergeant), Lee Tassio (SJPD sergeant), \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  Jaren Yuen (SJPD officer), Bill Nguyen (SJPD officer), Clifford Grodin (SJPD officer), \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  Stephen Michael Curry (SJPD officer), Michael Simonini (SJPD officer), Victor Ayala \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  (SJPD officer), James Adgar (SJPD officer), Steve Gaona (SJPD officer), Tyler Moran \nN\n19  (SJPD officer), John Lynch (SJPD sergeant), Larry Situ (SJPD officer), Frank Orabuena \n20  (SJPD officer), Gerardo Silva (SJPD officer), and Chris Weber (SJPD officer).  Dkt. 108, \n21  ¶¶ 27-47.    \n22    The complaint purports to assert eleven causes of action, though the first is for \n23  “injunctive relief” and the second is for “declaratory relief,” which are types of remedies \n24  rather than standalone causes of action.  That leaves nine substantive causes of action:  \n25  (1) violation of First Amendment rights under section 1983, asserted by all \n26  plaintiffs against all defendants; \n27     (2) excessive force in violation of Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, under \n28  section 1983, asserted by all plaintiffs against defendants City of San Jose, Garcia, \n3 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 113   Filed 04/07/23   Page 4 of 13\n \n1  Knopf, Dwyer, Matchett, and Tassio; and further asserted by plaintiff Acosta against \n2  defendants Yuen, Nguyen, Grodin, Lopez, and Lynch; by plaintiff Naemeh against \n3  defendants Orabuena, Weber, Situ, and Lopez; by plaintiff Swift against defendants \n4  Curry, Silva, and Ayala; by plaintiff Cañas against defendants Yuen and Lopez; by \n5  plaintiff Vasquez against defendants Yuen, Simonini, and Lopez; by plaintiff Allen against \n6  defendants Yuen and Lopez; by plaintiff Riles against defendant Simonini; by plaintiff \n7  Flores against defendants Gaona and Grodin; by plaintiff Cuellar against defendants \n8  Simonini, Adgar, Nguyen, Grodin, Moran, and Lynch; and by plaintiff Maldonado against \n9  defendant Lagorio; \n10  (3) failure to intervene under section 1983, asserted by all plaintiffs against all \n11  defendants; \n a  12  (4) violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, asserted by plaintiff \nurtni\noor 13  Cartwright against defendant City of San Jose; \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  (5) violation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, asserted by plaintiff Cartwright \nDict  15  against defendant City of San Jose;2 \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  (6) violation of the California Bane Act, asserted by all plaintiffs against all \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  defendants; \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  (7) violation of the California Ralph Act, asserted by all plaintiffs against \nN\n19  defendants City of San Jose, Garcia, Knopf, Dwyer, Matchett, and Tassio; and further \n20  asserted by plaintiff Acosta against defendants Yuen, Nguyen, Grodin, Lopez, and Lynch; \n21  by plaintiff Naemeh against defendants Orabuena, Weber, Situ, and Lopez; by plaintiff \n22  Swift against defendants Curry, Silva, and Ayala; by plaintiff Cañas against defendants \n23  Yuen and Lopez; by plaintiff Vasquez against defendants Yuen, Simonini, and Lopez; by \n24  plaintiff Allen against defendants Yuen and Lopez; by plaintiff Riles against defendant \n25  Simonini; by plaintiff Flores against defendants Gaona and Grodin; by plaintiff Cuellar \n26  against defendants Simonini, Adgar, Nguyen, Grodin, Moran, and Lynch; and by plaintiff \n27 \n \n2 In their reply, plaintiffs clarify that they are not seeking class certification as to “the \n28 \ndisability discrimination claims.”  Dkt. 103 at 13, n.7.   \n4 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 113   Filed 04/07/23   Page 5 of 13\n \n1  Maldonado against defendant Lagorio; \n2  (8) assault and battery, asserted by all plaintiffs against defendants City of San \n3  Jose, Garcia, Knopf, Dwyer, Matchett, and Tassio; and further asserted by plaintiff \n4  Acosta against defendants Yuen, Nguyen, Grodin, Lopez, and Lynch; by plaintiff Naemeh \n5  against defendants Orabuena, Weber, Situ, and Lopez; by plaintiff Swift against \n6  defendants Curry, Silva, and Ayala; by plaintiff Cañas against defendants Yuen and \n7  Lopez; by plaintiff Vasquez against defendants Yuen, Simonini, and Lopez; by plaintiff \n8  Allen against defendants Yuen and Lopez; by plaintiff Riles against defendant Simonini; \n9  by plaintiff Flores against defendants Gaona and Grodin; by plaintiff Cuellar against \n10  defendants Simonini, Adgar, Nguyen, Grodin, Moran, and Lynch; and by plaintiff \n11  Maldonado against defendant Lagorio; and \n a  12  (9) negligence, asserted by all plaintiffs against defendants City of San Jose, \nurtni\noor 13  Garcia, Knopf, Dwyer, Matchett, and Tassio; and further asserted by plaintiff Acosta \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  against defendants Yuen, Nguyen, Grodin, Lopez, and Lynch; by plaintiff Naemeh \nDict  15  against defendants Orabuena, Weber, Situ, and Lopez; by plaintiff Swift against \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  defendants Curry, Silva, and Ayala; by plaintiff Cañas against defendants Yuen and \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  Lopez; by plaintiff Vasquez against defendants Yuen, Simonini, and Lopez; by plaintiff \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  Allen against defendants Yuen and Lopez; by plaintiff Riles against defendant Simonini; \nN\n19  by plaintiff Flores against defendants Gaona and Grodin; by plaintiff Cuellar against \n20  defendants Simonini, Adgar, Nguyen, Grodin, Moran, and Lynch; and by plaintiff \n21  Maldonado against defendant Lagorio.  See Dkt. 108, ¶¶ 206-284.  \n22    Plaintiffs now move for certification on the following proposed classes: \n23  Damages class:  The direct force damages class is defined as all persons \npresent at protests regarding the killing of George Floyd in the city of San \n24  Jose on May 29, 2020 or May 30, 2020 who were struck by either Projectile \nImpact Weapons (including 37mm and 40mm projectiles and bean-bag \n25 \nshotguns), batons, or otherwise physically struck by a San Jose Police \nDepartment officer.   \n26 \nInjunctive relief class:  The injunctive relief class is defined as all persons \n27 \nwho have in the past participated, presently are participating, or may in the \nfuture participate in, or be present at, demonstrations within the city of San \n28 \n5 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 113   Filed 04/07/23   Page 6 of 13\n \nJose in the exercise of their rights of free speech, assembly, association, \n1 \npetition, and of the press, in general, and particularly as it relates to \nprotesting police violence and discrimination against people of color. \n2 \n \n3  Dkt. 108, ¶¶ 185, 186.   \nDISCUSSION \n4 \nA.  Legal standard \n5 \n“Before certifying a class, the trial court must conduct a ‘rigorous analysis' to \n6 \ndetermine whether the party seeking certification has met the prerequisites of Rule 23.” \n7 \nMazza v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc., 666 F.3d 581, 588 (9th Cir. 2012) (citation \n8 \nand quotation omitted).    \n9 \nThe party seeking class certification bears the burden of affirmatively \n10 \ndemonstrating that the class meets the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n11 \n a  12  23.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011).  In order for a class action \nurtni\noor 13  to be certified, plaintiffs must prove that they meet the requirements of Federal Rule of \nCf\nt ali\ncC Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b).  \nstriof  14 \nDict  15  Rule 23(a) requires that plaintiffs demonstrate numerosity, commonality, typicality \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  and adequacy of representation in order to maintain a class.  First, the class must be so \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  numerous that joinder of all members individually is “impracticable.”  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  23(a)(1).  Second, there must be questions of law or fact common to the class.  Fed. R. \nN\nCiv. P. 23(a)(2).  Third, the claims or defenses of the class representative must be typical \n19 \nof the claims or defenses of the class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  And fourth, the class \n20 \nrepresentative(s) must be able to protect fairly and adequately the interests of all \n21 \nmembers of the class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  The parties moving for class certification \n22 \nbear the burden of establishing that the Rule 23(a) requirements are satisfied.  Gen'l Tel. \n23 \nCo. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982); see also Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350. \n24 \nIf all four prerequisites of Rule 23(a) are satisfied, the court must also determine \n25 \nwhether to certify the class under one of the three subsections of Rule 23(b), pursuant to \n26 \nwhich the named plaintiffs must establish that either (1) that there is a risk of substantial \n27 \nprejudice from separate actions; or (2) that declaratory or injunctive relief benefitting the \n28 \n6 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 113   Filed 04/07/23   Page 7 of 13\n \n1  class as a whole would be appropriate; or (3) that common questions of law or fact \n2  common to the class predominate and that a class action is superior to other methods \n3  available for adjudicating the controversy at issue.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b). \n4  The court does not make a preliminary inquiry into the merits of plaintiffs' claims in \n5  determining whether to certify a class.  Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177 \n6  (1974).  The court will, however, scrutinize plaintiffs’ legal causes of action to determine \n7  whether they are suitable for resolution on a class-wide basis.  See, e.g., Moore v. \n8  Hughes Helicopters, Inc., 708 F.2d 475, 480 (9th Cir. 1983).  Making such a \n9  determination will sometimes require examining issues that overlap with the merits.  See \n10  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350-51 (acknowledging that court's “rigorous analysis” will frequently \n11  entail some overlap with merits of plaintiff's underlying claim).  \n a  12  The court will consider matters beyond the pleadings, if necessary, in order to \nurtni\noor 13  ascertain whether the asserted claims or defenses are susceptible of resolution on a \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  class wide basis.  See McCarthy v. Kleindienst, 741 F.2d 1406, 1419 n.8 (D.C. Cir. \nDict  15  1984). \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  B.  Analysis \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  1.  Damages class \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  As set forth above, in order to certify a damages class under Rule 23(b)(3), \nN\n19  plaintiffs must show that the four Rule 23(a) requirements are met, and must also show \n20  that “common questions of law or fact common to the class predominate and that a class \n21  action is superior to other methods available for adjudicating the controversy at issue.”  \n22  Because, as will be set forth below, the court finds this matter can be determined on the \n23  basis of the Rule 23(b) showing alone, the court does not reach the Rule 23(a) showing.   \n24  Plaintiffs argue that their claims present “common questions of law and fact \n25  regarding the city’s customs and policies related to policing public protest” that \n26  predominate over any individual issues.  Specifically, plaintiffs identify the following \n27  common questions: (1) did the SJPD have an unconstitutional custom and practice of \n28  using indiscriminate and other excessive force against peaceful protestors, as evidenced \n7 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 113   Filed 04/07/23   Page 8 of 13\n \n1  during the Floyd protests, (2) was there a failure to train the city’s employees in the \n2  proper use of force, and a failure to adequately supervise their use of force, and (3) were \n3  the foregoing violations authorized by city policymakers because no discipline was \n4  imposed for any of the excessive force and violations of written SJPD policies.  Dkt. 87 at \n5  20-21.   \n6    Plaintiffs argue that another district court, on similar facts, granted a motion for \n7  class certification after finding that common issues predominated over individual ones.  \n8  See Multi-Ethnic Immigrant Workers Org. Network v. City of Los Angeles, 246 F.R.D. 621 \n9  (C.D. Cal. 2007) (“MIWON”). \n10  The MIWON court found that the predominance requirement was indeed met as to \n11  plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment excessive force claims: \n \nurt nia  12  The Court recognizes that the conduct of individual officers in the field may \noor 13  present individual issues of reasonableness, namely whether it was \nCf\nt ali reasonable under the circumstances for a particular officer to fire less-lethal \nstricof C 14  masu pnuitisohnins,g u asned h sish obvaitnogn.  to strike people, or use other forms of force, such \ns Dirict  15   \nest Nonetheless, the individual issues share a common source: the command \natDi 16 \nt decisions to disperse the crowd and to authorize the use of less-lethal \nS \nn\nd er 17  munitions if the crowd’s behavior warranted it.  LAPD Report at 8, 34–35.  \ne\nth Because the legality of these command decisions is the overriding common \nnirt\nUo 18  question, the predominance requirement is met as to the Fourth \nN\nAmendment claim. \n19 \nMIWON at 635.   \n20 \n  That final sentence – the focus on the command decisions, rather than the actions \n21 \nof individual officers – is the key to the court’s conclusion on predominance.  Earlier in the \n22 \nsame section, the MIWON court emphasized that “plaintiffs focus on the LAPD \n23 \ncommanders’ authorization of ‘less lethal’ force (as distinct from the application of such \n24 \nforce).”  Id. (emphasis in original).  Also of note is that, in MIWON, the plaintiffs filed suit \n25 \nagainst only the City of Los Angeles, William Bratton (the Chief of Police), Cayler Carter \n26 \n(Deputy Chief of Police), and Louis Gray (a LAPD commander).  Id. at 624.3 \n27 \n \n28 \n3 The MIWON opinion also states that Does 1 through 10 were named as defendants, but \n8 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 113   Filed 04/07/23   Page 9 of 13\n \n1    In contrast, there is no such narrow focus on the command decisions in the \n2  present case.  Plaintiffs are pursuing claims against not only the defendants who made \n3  the high-level decisions to authorize force, but also the officers who applied such force.  \n4  That is the key distinction between this case and MIWON. \n5  The distinction can be most clearly seen when looking at plaintiffs’ excessive force \n6  claim under section 1983.  See Dkt. 108, ¶¶ 222-226.  Plaintiffs assert the claim on behalf \n7  of all plaintiffs against defendants City of San Jose, Garcia, Knopf, Dwyer, Matchett, and \n8  Tassio, those defendants having been involved in the authorization of force, but plaintiffs \n9  also assert the excessive force claim against individual officers who were involved in the \n10  application of force.  Specifically, the excessive force claim is asserted by plaintiff Acosta \n11  against defendants Yuen, Nguyen, Grodin, Lopez, and Lynch; by plaintiff Naemeh \n a  12  against defendants Orabuena, Weber, Situ, and Lopez; by plaintiff Swift against \nurtni\noor 13  defendants Curry, Silva, and Ayala; by plaintiff Cañas against defendants Yuen and \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  Lopez; by plaintiff Vasquez against defendants Yuen, Simonini, and Lopez; by plaintiff \nDict  15  Allen against defendants Yuen and Lopez; by plaintiff Riles against defendant Simonini; \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  by plaintiff Flores against defendants Gaona and Grodin; by plaintiff Cuellar against \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  defendants Simonini, Adgar, Nguyen, Grodin, Moran, and Lynch; and by plaintiff \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  Maldonado against defendant Lagorio.  See id.  The same non-overlapping sets of \nN\n19  plaintiffs and defendants are listed for plaintiffs’ state law claims for assault and battery, \n20  negligence, and violation of the Ralph Act.  See id., ¶¶ 268-284.    \n21    Because this case involves not only common claims regarding the authorization of \n22  force, but also individual claims arising out of each individual application of force, the \n23  court finds that the reasoning of MIWON is distinguishable, and accordingly, the court \n24  concludes that plaintiffs have not shown that common issues would predominate over \n25  individual issues as required by Rule 23(b)(3).  For that reason, plaintiffs’ motion for \n26  certification of a damages class is DENIED.  As discussed above, the court need not \n27 \n \n28 \nthe opinion provides no indication that any Doe substitutions were ultimately made. \n9 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 113   Filed 04/07/23   Page 10 of 13\n \n1  address the Rule 23(a) factors as they relate to the proposed damages class. \n2  2.  Injunctive relief class \n3  Certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate where the opposing party “has \n4  acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making \n5  appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the \n6  class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \n7    As an initial matter, the court points out the lack of clarity in plaintiffs’ pursuit of \n8  injunctive relief.  Neither the complaint nor the amended complaint sets forth the scope or \n9  nature of the injunction that plaintiffs are seeking.  Plaintiffs’ class certification motion \n10  similarly fails to specify what type of injunction they seek the court to impose.  In their \n11  reply brief, plaintiffs state for the first time that they are seeking to enjoin “the \n a  12  indiscriminate use of impact munitions and batons on peaceful protestors,” and “to \nurtni\noor 13  ensure the written policy is followed, plaintiffs also seek training and accountability \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  measures.”  Dkt. 103 at 16.  No further details are provided.  \nDict  15    Even putting aside any vagueness problems, the larger obstacle to certification \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  under Rule 23(b)(2) is the cross-cutting, non-overlapping nature of the various claims \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  brought by different plaintiffs against different defendants.  In contrast, in the MIWON \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  case cited above, the court certified an injunctive relief class in a case where plaintiffs \nN\n19  brought suit against only LAPD command personnel, and “focus[ed] on the LAPD \n20  commanders’ authorization of ‘less lethal’ force (as distinct from the application of such \n21  force).”  MIWON, 246 F.R.D. at 635 (emphasis in original).  However, as discussed \n22  above, the plaintiffs in this case did not focus their claims in a similar manner.  Rather \n23  than bringing suit against only command personnel and focusing on their authorization of \n24  force, the plaintiffs in this case challenge both the authorization of force by command \n25  personnel as well as the application of force by line officers.  The number of individual, \n26  non-overlapping claims brought by different sets of plaintiffs against different sets of \n27  defendants prevents the court from concluding that defendants’ conduct applies generally \n28  to the class, and accordingly, plaintiffs’ motion for certification of an injunctive relief class \n10 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 113   Filed 04/07/23   Page 11 of 13\n \n1  is DENIED.  As discussed above, the court need not address the Rule 23(a) factors as \n2  they apply to the proposed injunctive relief class.   \n3  C.  Other issues \n4  1.  Discovery letter brief \n5    Also before the court is a discovery dispute between the parties.  The discovery \n6  dispute is a request by defendants to “preclude plaintiff Acosta’s claim for future income \n7  loss based on documents plaintiffs did not provide in initial disclosures or during \n8  discovery.”  Dkt. 102 at 1. \n9  The essence of defendants’ argument is that plaintiffs waited until after the close \n10  of discovery to reveal that plaintiff Acosta would be pursuing damages based on lost \n11  future income.  Dkt. 102 at 1.  Defendants argue that the late disclosure prevents them \n a  12  from taking discovery from Acosta’s employer and coworkers.  Defendants thus ask for \nurtni\noor 13  an order precluding Acosta from pursuing damages based on lost future income, and \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  from using any documents related to Acosta’s employment that were not provided before \nDict  15  the close of discovery.  Defendants’ request is made pursuant to Rules 26 and 37.  Rule \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  26 requires a party to disclose damages-related information and to supplement or correct \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  those disclosures in a timely manner, and Rule 37 forbids the use at trial of information \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  that was not properly disclosed, unless the failure to disclose was substantially justified or \nN\n19  harmless.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26, 37; R & R Sails, Inc. v. Insurance Co. of Penn., 673 \n20  F.3d 1240, 1246 (9th Cir. 2012).   \n21    Plaintiffs argue that “Acosta’s discovery responses have always made clear that \n22  he might have a future wage loss claim,” and cite to interrogatory responses stating that \n23  “he is struggling to keep up at his demanding job” and “the amount of any future wage \n24  loss is undetermined at this time.”  Dkt. 102 at 4.  Plaintiffs argue that “when defendants \n25  requested documents supporting a claim for loss of income or earning capacity in \n26  October 2021, no such documents existed and any future wage loss was speculative,” \n27  but “in October and November 2022, events transpired that made it more likely that Mr. \n28  Acosta could suffer an injury-related future income loss.”  Id.  Specifically, plaintiffs point \n11 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 113   Filed 04/07/23   Page 12 of 13\n \n1  to Acosta’s job performance review in October 2022 that was “significantly less positive” \n2  than prior reviews, and to news of a “tech downturn” in November 2022, arguing that \n3  those events turned a speculative wage-loss claim into a non-speculative one.  \n4  Overall, plaintiffs have not shown that their failure to timely disclose was \n5  substantially justified or harmless.  Essentially, they argue that Acosta was aware of his \n6  own limitations, but was not aware that his supervisor had noticed until the performance \n7  review in October 2022.  First of all, the fact discovery cutoff was not until November 14, \n8  2022, so plaintiffs still could have made the disclosure before the close of discovery – but \n9  more importantly, Acosta himself is in the best position to assess whether he feels that \n10  his work performance was affected, and by plaintiffs’ own account, he was aware of that \n11  at least as early as July 2022.  Accordingly, defendants’ request to preclude the claim of \n a  12  future income loss and the late-produced documents is GRANTED.   \nurtni\noor 13  2.  Motion to seal \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  In connection with the discovery letter brief, plaintiffs filed a motion to seal.  See \nDict  15  Dkt. 97.  Because the motion sought the sealing of entire exhibits, rather than seeking \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  limited redactions of truly sensitive information, the court denied the motion to seal \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  without prejudice.  See Dkt. 100.   \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  Plaintiffs have filed a revised motion to seal, but in addition to seeking the sealing \nN\n19  of medical and mental health information, plaintiffs also seek the sealing of information \n20  related to plaintiff’s employment, such as salary information and the names of products \n21  that plaintiff worked on.  See Dkt. 101.   \n22  To the extent that plaintiffs seek the sealing of medical and/or mental health \n23  information, the motion to seal is GRANTED.  However, to the extent that plaintiffs seek \n24  the sealing of information related to plaintiff Acosta’s employment, the motion to seal is \n25  DENIED.  Plaintiffs are directed to re-file the exhibits with only medical or mental health \n26  information redacted from public filing. \n27  CONCLUSION \n28  For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs’ motion for class certification (Dkt. 87) is \n12 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 113   Filed 04/07/23   Page 13 of 13\n \n1  DENIED as to both the proposed damages class under Rule 23(b)(3) as well as the \n2  proposed injunctive relief class under Rule 23(b)(2).  Defendants’ discovery request to \n3  preclude evidence based on Acosta’s future lost income (Dkt. 102) is GRANTED, and \n4  plaintiffs’ motion to seal (Dkt. 101) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.   \n5    IT IS SO ORDERED. \n6  Dated:  April 7, 2023 \n7     /s/ Phyllis J.

COMPLAINT AND DISCOVERY \n8    LETTER BRIEFS \nCITY OF SAN JOSE, et al., \n9  Re: Dkt. No. 70, 76, 79 \nDefendants. \n10   \n \n11    \n a  12    Plaintiffs’ motion to amend the complaint came on for hearing on November 10, \nurtni\noor 13  2022.  Plaintiffs appeared through their counsel, Rachel Lederman.  Defendants \nCf\nt ali\ncC\nstriof  14  appeared through their counsel, James Huang and Ardell Johnson.  Having read the \nDict  15  papers filed by the parties and carefully considered their arguments and relevant \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  authority, and good cause appearing, the court hereby rules as follows. \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  BACKGROUND \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18    This is a civil rights case arising out of the May 2020 protests in response to the \nN\n19  killing of George Floyd by police.  The original complaint in this case asserted claims \n20  against the City of San Jose and nine individual defendants, which included members of \n21  the San Jose Police Department.  The complaint also named as defendants 100 fictitious \n22  Doe defendants, which included police officers who were alleged to have used force \n23  against plaintiffs but who could not be identified, as well as Doe defendants who \n24  supervised the officers.  See, e.g., Dkt. 3, ¶¶ 39, 65, 104.    \n25    Plaintiffs now move to amend the complaint to substitute certain Doe defendants, \n26  arguing that the allegations against those defendants relate back to the filing of the \n27  original complaint. \n28  Defendants challenge five categories of additions: (1) “‘directing’ Doe officers \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 81   Filed 12/06/22   Page 2 of 14\n \n1  allegations against Asuelo,” (2) “‘false identification’ allegations against Bird1, Weber, and \n2  Erbes,” (3) “blanket ‘supervisory’-type First Amendment suppression allegations against \n3  Knopf, Matchett, Lagorio, Lynch, and Erbes,” (4) “‘failure to intervene’ allegations against \n4  Simonini, Gaona, Adgar, Moran, Nguyen, and Grodin,” and (5) “the single factually \n5  devoid and conclusory sentence against defendant Preuss.”  See Dkt. 72 at 8-13.  \n6  DISCUSSION \n7  A.  Legal Standard \n8  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 requires that a plaintiff obtain either consent of \n9  the defendant or leave of court to amend its complaint once the defendant has answered, \n10  but “leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a).  Rule \n11  15(c) further provides that “[a]n amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the \n a  12  original pleading when,” among other requirements, “the amendment asserts a claim or \nurtni\noor 13  defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out – or attempted \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  to be set out – in the original pleading.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c).   \nDict  15  The Ninth Circuit has held that federal courts must “consider both federal and state \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  law and employ whichever affords the ‘more permissive’ relation back standard.”  Butler \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  v. Nat’l Community Renaissance of California, 766 F.3d 1191, 1201 (9th Cir. 2014).  \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  California Code of Civil Procedure section 474 specifically covers situations “[w]hen the \nN\n19  plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defendant” and must designate the defendant by a \n20  fictitious name until “his true name is discovered,” at which time “the pleading or \n21  proceeding must be amended accordingly.”  Cal. C.C.P. § 474.   \n22  California courts have held that “the relation-back doctrine can save an amended \n23  complaint that identifies a fictitiously-named defendant and asserts a cause of action \n24  against that defendant only if: (1) the amended complaint is based on the same general \n25  state of facts as the original; (2) the original complaint stated a valid cause of action \n26 \n \n27 \n1 Plaintiffs concede that Bird was “incorrectly named” and that he should be removed \nfrom the complaint.  See Dkt. 73 at 7.  Plaintiffs also acknowledge that Jacob Morris and \n28 \nFnu (“first name unknown”) Roude were named in error.  See id. \n2 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 81   Filed 12/06/22   Page 3 of 14\n \n1  against the now-identified defendant; and (3) the plaintiff was “genuinely ignorant” of the \n2  defendant's identity or the facts rendering defendant liable when the original complaint \n3  was filed.”  Eghtesad v. State Farm General Insurance Company, 51 Cal.App.5th 406, \n4  415 (2020) (citing Austin v. Massachusetts Bonding & Insurance Co., 56 Cal.2d 596, 600-\n5  601 (1961)). \n6  B.  Analysis \n7  Before applying the relation-back doctrine to the current motion to amend, the \n8  court must set forth some of the relevant procedural background.  The original complaint \n9  in this case asserted sixteen causes of action against the City of San Jose, nine \n10  individual defendants, and the Doe defendants.  See Dkt. 3.  When defendants filed a \n11  motion to dismiss the complaint, the court issued an order in advance of the hearing, \n a  12  stating that “the complaint is unclear in stating which claims are being asserted by which \nurtni\noor 13  plaintiffs against which defendants.”  See Dkt. 35.  The court directed plaintiffs to file a \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  chart specifically listing each plaintiff and each defendant for each cause of action, and \nDict  15  further asked plaintiffs’ counsel to clarify the scope of their claims at the hearing.  See \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  Dkt. 37; Dkt. 44 at 23-25.   \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  Despite the court’s previous attempts to bring clarity as to the scope of the claims \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  asserted, the original complaint still remains unclear as to exactly which claims were \nN\n19  intended to be asserted against Doe defendants.  In particular, the court notes that only \n20  certain causes of action in the original complaint – such as the eighth cause of action for \n21  failure to intervene in violation of section 1983 – specifically listed Doe defendants as part \n22  of the group of defendants against whom the claim was asserted.  See Dkt. 3 at 62.  \n23  Other claims in the original complaint, such as the third cause of action for violation of \n24  First Amendment rights under section 1983 and the fourth cause of action for excessive \n25  force under section 1983, did not list any plaintiffs or defendants at all, let alone Doe \n26  defendants.  Because of the complaint’s lack of clarity – which could have been avoided \n27  if plaintiffs had simply listed each plaintiff and each defendant, including Does, for each \n28  cause of action – the court must look more closely at the original complaint’s allegations \n3 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 81   Filed 12/06/22   Page 4 of 14\n \n1  to determine which claims were adequately asserted against Doe defendants, such that \n2  the proposed amendments would relate back.   \n3  Moreover, compounding the lack of clarity, plaintiffs’ current proposed amended \n4  complaint repeats many of the same problems as the original complaint.  In particular, \n5  many of the causes of action again do not set forth which plaintiffs are asserting the claim \n6  or against which defendants the claim is intended to be asserted.  See, e.g., Dkt. 70-1 at \n7  57 (third cause of action for violation of the First Amendment under section 1983, no \n8  plaintiffs or defendants listed in heading); 58 (fourth cause of action for excessive force, \n9  no plaintiffs or defendants listed); 60 (seventh cause of action for violation of the \n10  Americans with Disabilities Act, no plaintiffs or defendants listed in heading).   \n11    As a separate initial matter, the court also notes that plaintiffs submitted a \n a  12  proposed amended complaint along with their motion to amend, but then submitted a \nurtni\noor 13  “corrected” proposed amended complaint along with their reply brief, purporting to add \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  new allegations against defendant Preuss.  Plaintiffs’ attempt to add new allegations in \nDict  15  their reply brief was improper and deprived defendants an opportunity to respond, and \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  thus, the “corrected” proposed amended complaint (Dkt. 73-1) will be STRICKEN and will \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  not be considered by the court on this motion.  Instead, the court will consider only the \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  proposed additions contained within the earlier-filed proposed amended complaint (Dkt. \nN\n19  70-1).   \n20  1.  Category (1) – “‘directing’ allegations as to defendant Asuelo” \n21  The first category of additions challenged by defendants is the “‘directing’ Doe \n22  officers allegations against Asuelo.”  See Dkt. 72 at 9.  Defendants argue that defendant \n23  Asuelo “is added as having ‘directed’ City of San Jose police officers who shoved Ms. \n24  Cartwright hard in the chest on May 29, shot her in the right knee, left calf, and finger on \n25  May 30, and wrongfully arrested her on May 31.”  Id. (quoting Dkt. 70-1, ¶ 20).  \n26  Defendants argue that the Doe substitution does not relate back to the original complaint, \n27  which does not include any “directing” allegations and instead alleges only that officers \n28  shoved, shot, and wrongfully arrested Cartwright.  See Dkt. 72 at 9 (citing Dkt. 3, ¶ 20).   \n4 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 81   Filed 12/06/22   Page 5 of 14\n \n1    The proposed amended complaint is not entirely clear in stating which causes of \n2  action are intended to be asserted against proposed defendant Asuelo.  At minimum, the \n3  proposed amended complaint seeks to add Asuelo as a defendant to the fifth cause of \n4  action for wrongful arrest under federal law and the twelfth cause of action for false arrest \n5  under state law.  See Dkt. 70-1 at 58, 65.  However, as mentioned above, the proposed \n6  amended complaint does not list any specific defendants for claims such as the fourth \n7  cause of action for excessive force, making it unclear as to whether plaintiffs intend to \n8  assert that claim, or other claims with a similar lack of detail, against Asuelo.  And as also \n9  mentioned above, the original complaint was unclear as to exactly which claims were \n10  asserted against Doe defendants.  To determine whether the new allegations against \n11  Asuelo do indeed relate back to the original complaint, the court will need to compare the \n a  12  new proposed allegations to the allegations made against Doe defendants in the original \nurtni\noor 13  complaint.    \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14    The proposed amended complaint alleges that Asuelo “participated in the police \nDict  15  conduct complained of,” including “directing multiple officers to shove plaintiff Shaunn \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  Cartwright.”  Dkt. 70-1, ¶ 57.  The proposed amended complaint further alleges that \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  Asuelo “shot into the crowd and directed City of San Jose police officers who shoved \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  [Cartwright] in the chest very forcefully.”  Id., ¶ 95.   \nN\n19    As it relates to plaintiff Cartwright, the original complaint alleged that “Doe City of \n20  San Jose police officers shoved [her] in the chest on May 29, shot her in the right knee, \n21  left calf, and finger on May 30, and wrongfully arrested her on May 31.”  Dkt. 3, ¶ 20.  The \n22  original complaint further alleged that “Cartwright observed City of San Jose police \n23  officers shooting impact munitions into the crowd of demonstrators” and “attempted to \n24  take photographs to document and discourage this police use of force, but City of San \n25  Jose police officer Fnu Delgado or a Doe City of San Jose police officer shoved her in the \n26  chest very forcefully.”  Id., ¶ 74.  The original complaint also alleged that “a Doe City of \n27  San Jose police officer shot at her four times in quick succession with impact munitions.”  \n28  Id., ¶ 102.   \n5 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 81   Filed 12/06/22   Page 6 of 14\n \n1    Based on those allegations in the original complaint, the court concludes that the \n2  original complaint did indeed assert claims against Doe defendants for violation of the \n3  First Amendment and for excessive force, at least as to the injuries alleged by plaintiff \n4  Cartwright.  \n5    Having determined that the original complaint can be reasonably read to assert a \n6  First Amendment claim and excessive force claim against Doe defendants, the next \n7  question is whether the “Doe” allegations encompass Asuelo’s alleged conduct of \n8  “directing” the officers who allegedly violated Cartwright’s rights.  \n9    Plaintiffs point to the original complaint’s allegation that “[t]he Doe defendants \n10  include other individuals who supervised and/or participated in the conduct complained of \n11  herein,” and that the Doe defendants “proximately caused said incidents, injuries, and \n a  12  damages by reason of their negligence, breach of duty, negligent supervision, \nurtni\noor 13  management or control, [or] violation of constitutional and legal rights.”  Dkt. 3, ¶ 39.  \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  Plaintiffs further argue that the original complaint alleged that “Doe defendants, and/or \nDict  15  each of them, caused the violation of the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights as a result of their \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  supervisory malfeasance and/or deliberate indifference to the need for more or different \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  training, supervision, and/or discipline.”  Id., ¶ 196.   \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18    Overall, despite the confusion created by the lack of specificity in plaintiffs’ filings, \nN\n19  the court concludes that plaintiffs’ substitution of Asuelo for a Doe defendant is proper as \n20  to at least some causes of action; namely, the fifth and twelfth causes of action for \n21  wrongful/false arrest, the third cause of action for violation of the First Amendment, and \n22  the fourth cause of action for excessive force.  Applying the standard set forth in \n23  Eghtesad, (1) the amended complaint’s allegations regarding plaintiff Cartwright and the \n24  officers who injured her are based on the same general state of facts as the original, (2) \n25  the original complaint stated valid causes of action for violation of the First Amendment, \n26  excessive force, and wrongful/false arrest against Doe defendants, including supervisory \n27  Doe defendants, and (3) plaintiffs were “genuinely ignorant” of Asuelo's identity or the \n28  facts rendering him liable when the original complaint was filed.  Accordingly, plaintiffs’ \n6 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 81   Filed 12/06/22   Page 7 of 14\n \n1  motion is GRANTED as to category (1), the “directing” allegations as to defendant \n2  Asuelo.  Plaintiffs may add Asuelo as a defendant to the four causes of action specifically \n3  listed above, but not to any other causes of action.    \n4 \n2.  Category (2) – “‘false identification’ allegations as to defendants Weber and \nErbes” \n5 \n6    The second category of additions challenged by defendants is the “‘false \n7  identification’ allegations as to defendants Weber and Erbes.”  As mentioned above, \n8  defendants also challenged the addition of defendant Bird to this category of allegations, \n9  but plaintiffs conceded in their reply that Bird had been incorrectly named as a defendant.   \n10    Defendants argue that the original complaint alleged only that Doe officers shot \n11  and wrongfully arrested plaintiff Naemeh, while the proposed amended complaint further \n a  12  alleges that Weber “falsely identified Naemeh as threatening” and Erbes “approved of the \nurtni\noor 13  false identification of Naemeh.”  Dkt. 72 at 10 (citing Dkt. 70-1, ¶ 26; Dkt. 3, ¶ 26).  \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  Defendants argue that, because the proposed amended complaint adds new factual \nDict  15  allegations, the addition of Weber and Erbes does not relate back to the original \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  complaint.   \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17    Plaintiffs argue that the original complaint alleged that “Doe City of San Jose \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  police officers told Mr. Naemeh that he was the person responsible for throwing frozen \nN\n19  water bottles and that they had caught this on video.”  Dkt. 3, ¶ 107.  The original \n20  complaint further alleged that Naemeh denied throwing frozen water bottles, “but the Doe \n21  officers told him that he was going to jail for six months.”  Id.  Plaintiffs argue that the \n22  wrongful arrest cause of action alleges that there was “no probable cause to support \n23  Naemeh’s arrest,” thus arguing that the proposed amendments do indeed relate back to \n24  the original complaint.   \n25    As a general matter, the court agrees with plaintiffs that the allegations regarding \n26  the “false identification” by Doe defendants do indeed relate back to the filing of the \n27  original complaint.  The original complaint adequately alleged that Doe officers falsely \n28  identified Naemeh as throwing frozen water bottles and that the allegedly false \n7 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 81   Filed 12/06/22   Page 8 of 14\n \n1  identification was used as a basis for arresting him.  See Dkt. 3, ¶ 107.  Moreover, the \n2  court notes that the original complaint did name Doe defendants as defendants in the \n3  heading of the fifth cause of action for wrongful arrest under federal law and the twelfth \n4  cause of action for false arrest under state law.  See id. at 60, 70.   \n5  That said, the court notes that plaintiffs’ proposed amended complaint includes a \n6  list of defendants against whom the federal and state causes of action for wrongful arrest \n7  are asserted, and while the lists include Erbes, they do not include Weber.  See Dkt. 70-1 \n8  at 58 (count five for wrongful arrest under federal law), 65 (count twelve for false arrest \n9  under state law).  Because the substance of the proposed amended complaint itself \n10  contains sufficient factual allegations against Weber, the court believes Weber’s \n11  exclusion from the headings of these two causes of action to be an inadvertent error.  \n a  12  Accordingly, because the court concludes that the original complaint adequately stated a \nurtni\noor 13  cause of action for wrongful/false arrest of Naemeh against Doe defendants, and that the \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  other requirements from Eghtesad are met, the court also concludes that the proposed \nDict  15  amended complaint does properly add Erbes and Weber as defendants on the claims for \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  wrongful arrest under federal law and false arrest under state law.  Therefore, as to the \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  category (2) additions, plaintiffs’ motion to amend the complaint is GRANTED as to \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  defendant Erbes and Weber, and DENIED as moot as to Bird.   \nN\n19    In plaintiffs’ reply brief, they for the first time request that Officer Brian Fee be \n20  substituted as a Doe defendant, arguing that his identity was “revealed in a deposition” \n21  just one day before the reply brief was filed.  See Dkt. 73 at 8.  As an initial matter, this \n22  request was improperly raised in a reply brief, which gave defendants no opportunity to \n23  respond.  Moreover, plaintiffs provide no support for their argument that they could not \n24  have known of Officer Fee’s identity any earlier, instead relying on bare attorney \n25  assertion that his identity was revealed only a day earlier.  Accordingly, plaintiffs’ attempt \n26  to substitute Brian Fee as a Doe defendant is DENIED.   \n27   \n28   \n8 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 81   Filed 12/06/22   Page 9 of 14\n \n3.  Category (3) – “blanket ‘supervisory’-type First Amendment suppression \n1 \nallegations against Knopf, Matchett, Lagorio, Lynch, and Erbes” \n2 \nThe third category of additions challenged by defendants is the “blanket \n3 \n‘supervisory’-type First Amendment suppression allegations against Knopf, Matchett, \n4 \nLagorio, Lynch, and Erbes.”  Defendants argue that the proposed amended complaint \n5 \nalleges that those defendants committed the “previously unalleged acts” of “approving the \n6 \nuse of chemical weapons and [projectile impact weapons] at the demonstrations.”  Dkt. \n7 \n72 at 11 (citing Dkt. 70-1, ¶ 32).  Defendants argue that, in the original complaint, no Doe \n8 \ndefendants “were alleged in context of these allegations.”  Id. at 12.   \n9 \n  Plaintiffs argue that the original complaint alleged that Doe defendants “caused the \n10 \nCity of San Jose police officers’ constitutional violations” by “approving the use of impact \n11 \nmunitions, explosive grenades, and chemical weapons at the demonstrations.”  Dkt. 3, \n a  12 \nurtni ¶ 193.  The original complaint further alleges that the “Doe City officials caused the City \noor 13 \nCf\nt ali of San Jose police officers’ constitutional violations complained of herein by failing to” \ncC\nstriof  14  implement policy and training to “stop the officers from engaging in racial and religious \nDict  15 \ns ri profiling and harassment, use of excessive force, wrongful arrests, and deprivation of \net\ns\natDi 16 \nSt  First Amendment rights.”  Id., ¶ 191.   \nn\nd er 17 \ne\nth   Based on the above allegations from the original complaint, the court concludes \nnirt\nUo 18 \nN\nthat the original complaint did indeed assert supervisory-type First Amendment \n19 \nallegations against Doe defendants, including Doe supervisory defendants.  Although the \n20 \nanalysis would have been much clearer if the original complaint had specifically named \n21 \nDoe defendants as part of the third cause of action for violation of First Amendment \n22 \nrights, the court nonetheless concludes that the substitutions challenged in category (3) \n23 \ndo relate back to the original complaint.  Applying the standard set forth in Eghtesad, (1) \n24 \nthe amended complaint’s allegations regarding the approval of chemical and impact \n25 \nweapons are based on the same general state of facts as the original, (2) the original \n26 \ncomplaint stated a valid cause of action for violation of the First Amendment against Doe \n27 \ndefendants, and (3) plaintiffs were “genuinely ignorant” of defendants’ identity or the facts \n28 \n9 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 81   Filed 12/06/22   Page 10 of 14\n \n1  rendering defendants liable when the original complaint was filed.  Accordingly, plaintiffs’ \n2  motion is GRANTED as to category (3), the supervisory-type First Amendment \n3  suppression allegations against Knopf, Matchett, Lagorio, Lynch, and Erbes. \n4 \n4.  Category (4) – “‘failure to intervene’ allegations against Simonini, Gaona, \nAdgar, Moran, Nguyen, and Grodin” \n5 \n6  The fourth category of additions challenged by defendants is the “‘failure to \n7  intervene’ allegations against Simonini, Gaona, Adgar, Moran, Nguyen, and Grodin.”  \n8  Defendants argue that the original complaint directed ‘failure to intervene’ allegations \n9  towards only defendants Liccardo2, Sykes, Garcia, Dwyer, Lopez, and Tassio, “but with \n10  no corresponding Doe placeholders.”  Dkt. 72 at 12-13.   \n11  Plaintiffs point to the heading of the eighth cause of action in the original \n a  12  complaint, which asserted a section 1983 claim for failure to intervene against “Sykes, \nurtni\noor 13  Garcia, Dwyer, Yuen, Curry, Delgado, and Does.”  See Dkt. 3 at 62.  Plaintiffs further \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  point to the allegations that “Doe defendants include other individuals who supervised \nDict  15  and/or participated in the conduct complained of herein,” and that the Doe defendants \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  “caused the violation of the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights as a result of their supervisory \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  malfeasance and/or deliberate indifference to the need for more or different training, \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  supervision, and/or discipline.”  See Dkt. 3, ¶ 39, 196. \nN\n19  Plaintiffs are correct that the original complaint’s eighth cause of action does \n20  specifically list Doe defendants in the heading of the claim.  See Dkt. 3 at 62.  The court \n21  concludes that the original complaint did adequately assert a claim for failure to intervene \n22 \n \n23 \n2 The court notes that neither the original complaint nor the proposed amended complaint \nnames Liccardo as a defendant on the ‘failure to intervene’ claim, and further notes that \n24 \nthe original complaint did not name Tassio as a defendant.  See Dkt. 3 at 62; Dkt. 70-1 at \n59.  To the extent that the proposed amended complaint seeks to name as defendants \n25 \n“all defendants except Liccardo,” that attempt is rejected.  The original complaint named \nas defendants only Sykes, Garcia, Dwyer, Yuen, Curry, Delgado, and the Doe \n26 \ndefendants.  See Dkt. 3 at 62.  Thus, the only defendants who may be named on the \n‘failure to intervene’ claim are those from the original complaint (Sykes, Garcia, Dwyer, \n27 \nYuen, Curry, Delgado) and the Doe substitutions made as part of this motion (Simonini, \nGaona, Adgar, Moran, Nguyen, and Grodin).  No other defendants may be added to this \n28 \nclaim.   \n10 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 81   Filed 12/06/22   Page 11 of 14\n \n1  against Doe defendants, and thus, the proposed substitutions do relate back to the \n2  original complaint.  Applying the standard set forth in Eghtesad, (1) the amended \n3  complaint’s allegations regarding any failure to intervene are based on the same general \n4  state of facts as the original, (2) the original complaint stated valid causes of action for \n5  failure to intervene against Doe defendants, and (3) plaintiffs were “genuinely ignorant” of \n6  defendants’ identity or the facts rendering defendants liable when the original complaint \n7  was filed.  Accordingly, plaintiffs’ motion is GRANTED as to category (4), the ‘failure to \n8  intervene’ allegations against Simonini, Gaona, Adgar, Moran, Nguyen, and Grodin. \n9  5.  Category (5) – addition of defendant Preuss \n10  The fifth category of additions challenged by defendants is “the single factually \n11  devoid and conclusory sentence against defendant Preuss.”  Defendants argue that the \n a  12  proposed amended complaint alleges only that Preuss “participated in the police conduct \nurtni\nCofor 13  complained of,” without any further detail.  Dkt. 72 at 13.   \nt ali\ncC\nstriof  14  Plaintiffs state in their reply that they “inadvertently omitted the substantive \nDict  15  allegations against defendant Preuss,” and as mentioned above, plaintiffs submitted a \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  purported ‘corrected’ proposed amended complaint along with their reply.  See Dkt. 73 at \nt\nS \nn\ned er 17  6; Dkt. 73-1.  As discussed above, plaintiffs’ late-filed proposed complaint was improper \nh\nt\nnirt\nUNo 18  and denied defendants a chance to meaningfully respond, and is thus stricken and will be \n19  disregarded.  Therefore, based only on the allegations in the timely-filed proposed \n20  amended complaint (Dkt. 70-1), the court agrees with defendants that there are no \n21  substantive allegations against Preuss, and therefore, no relation back is possible.  \n22  Accordingly, plaintiffs’ motion is DENIED as to category (5), the addition of Preuss as a \n23  defendant.   \n24  Thus, plaintiffs’ motion to amend the complaint (Dkt. 70) is GRANTED in part and \n25  DENIED in part.  Specifically: \n26  (1) as to the category (1) allegations regarding defendant Asuelo, the motion is \nGRANTED, and Asuelo may be substituted as a Doe defendant only for the \n27 \nthird cause of action for violation of First Amendment rights, fourth cause of \n28 \n11 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 81   Filed 12/06/22   Page 12 of 14\n \naction for excessive force, and the fifth/twelfth causes of action for \n1 \nwrongful/false arrest under federal and state law; \n2 \n(2) as to the category (2) allegations, the motion is GRANTED as to defendant \n3 \nErbes and Weber and DENIED as moot as to defendant Bird, and defendants \n4  Erbes and Weber may be substituted as Doe defendants for the fifth/twelfth \n5  causes of action for wrongful/false arrest under federal and state law; \n(3) as to the category (3) allegations regarding defendants Knopf, Matchett, \n6 \nLagorio, Lynch, and Erbes, the motion is GRANTED, and Knopf, Matchett, \n7 \nLagorio, Lynch, and Erbes may be substituted as Doe defendants for the third \n8 \ncause of action for violation of First Amendment rights; \n9 \n(4) as to the category (4) allegations regarding defendants Simonini, Gaona, \n10 \nAdgar, Moran, Nguyen, and Grodin, the motion is GRANTED, and Simonini, \n11  Gaona, Adgar, Moran, Nguyen, and Grodin may be substituted as Doe \n a  12  defendants for the sixth cause of action for failure to intervene; and \nourtorni 13  (5) as to the category (5) allegations regarding Preuss, the motion is DENIED.   \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14    Plaintiffs are directed to file a revised proposed amended complaint incorporating \nDict  15  the court’s rulings.  The revised proposed amended complaint shall, for each cause of \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  action, clearly set forth the name of each plaintiff asserting the claim, and the name of \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  each defendant against whom the claim is asserted.  And as mentioned above, other \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  than the Doe substitutions that were expressly approved in this order or unchallenged by \nN\n19  defendants, no new plaintiffs or defendants may be added to any claim.  The revised \n20  proposed amended complaint shall also remove the defendants who plaintiffs \n21  acknowledge were incorrectly named, namely Bird, Morris, and Rouede.  To the extent \n22  that the court offered to review the issue of plaintiffs’ attempt to add Officers Fee and \n23  Preuss again after a meet and confer, the court has changed its mind.  Finally, the \n24  revised proposed amended complaint may no longer include Doe defendants, and all as-\n25  yet-unnamed Doe defendants are DISMISSED from the case.  Plaintiffs are directed to \n26  file their proposed amended complaint no later than December 22, 2022.   \n27  Discovery letter briefs (Dkt. 76, 79) \n28    Also before the court is the parties’ joint discovery letter brief regarding plaintiffs’ \n12 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 81   Filed 12/06/22   Page 13 of 14\n \n1  interrogatory responses.  As stated at the hearing, plaintiffs’ objections to the \n2  interrogatories are OVERRULED.  While plaintiffs are correct that an interrogatory \n3  seeking the factual basis for request-for-admission denials is properly treated as a \n4  compound interrogatory, plaintiffs’ argument ignores the fact that each defendant may \n5  serve their own interrogatories, and to the extent that any one defendant exceeded their \n6  limit, courts have been willing to deem any excess interrogatories as coming from the \n7  other defendants.  See, e.g., Trevino v. ACB American, 232 F.R.D. 612, 614 (N.D. Cal. \n8  2006) (“the court will treat the first 25 interrogatories as served by” the first plaintiff, and \n9  the remaining interrogatories were “treated as served” by another plaintiff); see also \n10  Safeco of America v. Rawstron, 181 F.R.D. 441, 445 (C.D. Cal. 1998) (“Allowing service \n11  of an interrogatory which requests disclosure of all of the information on which the denials \n a  12  of each of 50 requests for admissions were based, however, essentially transforms each \nurtni\noor 13  request for admission into an interrogatory”); Chapman v. California Dept. of Education, \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  2002 WL 32854376, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 6, 2002) (“If the interrogatory relates to distinct \nDict  15  and separate requests for admission, the interrogatories should be treated as the same \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  number of subparts as there are requests for admission.”) \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  Accordingly, given the number of defendants in this case, the court finds no basis \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  for concluding that the number of interrogatories is excessive.  For that reason, plaintiffs’ \nN\n19  objection to compound interrogatories reflected in the parties’ October 27 discovery letter \n20  brief (Dkt. 76) is OVERRULED.     \n21    There is a second discovery letter brief before the court (Dkt. 79), filed on \n22  November 21.  In the letter, plaintiffs seek leave to take a deposition despite the close of \n23  fact discovery having already occurred on November 14.  Plaintiffs’ request is DENIED.   \n24  CONCLUSION \n25    For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs’ motion to amend the complaint is GRANTED \n26  in part and DENIED in part, plaintiffs’ objections to compound interrogatories reflected in \n27  the October 27 joint discovery letter brief (Dkt. 76) are OVERRULED, and plaintiffs’ \n28  request to take a deposition after the close of discovery reflected in the November 21 \n13 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 81   Filed 12/06/22   Page 14 of 14\n \n1  discovery letter brief (Dkt. 79) is DENIED.   \n2  Plaintiffs are directed to file a revised proposed amended complaint in accordance \n3  with this order – specifically listing each plaintiff and each defendant named on each \n4  cause of action – no later than December 22, 2022.   \n5    IT IS SO ORDERED. \n6  Dated:  December 6, 2022 \n7     /s/ Phyllis J.

Plaintiffs NAACP of San Jose/Silicon Valley, San Jose Peace and Justice Center, \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  M. Michael Acosta, Joseph Cañas, Leslie Vasquez, Peter Allen, Shaunn Cartwright, \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  Yessica Riles, Jose Gustavo Flores Rodriguez, Alex Lee, Joseph Maldonado, Cindy \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  Cuellar, Mahmoudreza Naemeh, and Megan Swift appeared through their counsel, \nN\n19  Rachel Lederman, Tifanei Ressl-Moyer, and James Chanin.  Defendants City of San \n20  Jose, Sam Liccardo, Edgardo Garcia, David Sykes, Jason Dwyer, Ronnie Lopez, Lee \n21  Tassio, Jared Yuen, Sean Michael Curry, and Fnu Delgado appeared through their \n22  counsel, Matthew Pritchard and Yue-Han Chow.  Having read the papers filed by the \n23  parties and carefully considered their arguments and relevant authority, and good cause \n24  appearing, the court hereby rules as follows. \n25  BACKGROUND \n26  This is a civil rights case.  The allegations all arise out of last summer’s protests in \n27  response to the killing of George Floyd.  Specifically, between May 29 and May 31, 2020, \n28  plaintiffs participated in protests in San Jose to “express their view that police brutality \n\n \n1  and institutionalized racism must end,” and now “seek redress for the violation of their \n2  constitutional rights to assemble, protest, and be free from racial discrimination, disability \n3  discrimination, excessive force, and wrongful arrest.”  Dkt. 3 (Complaint), ¶¶ 2, 3. \n4    There are two “organization plaintiffs” and twelve individual plaintiffs in this case.  \n5  The organization plaintiffs are (1) the National Association for the Advancement of \n6  Colored People of San Jose/Silicon Valley (“NAACP”), and (2) the San Jose Peace and \n7  Justice Center (“SJPJC”).  Both organizations allege in the complaint that their \n8  constituents’ rights to speech and assembly were violated, and that the organizations \n9  plan to assist and participate in similar protests in the future and are “fearful that the \n10  same unlawful police actions in response to these and similar protests of institutional \n11  racism and police brutality will be repeated absent injunctive relief.”  Dkt. 3, ¶¶ 14, 15. \n a  12  Both organizations are plaintiffs for equitable relief only.  Dkt. 37 at 1, n.2. \nurtni\noor 13    Now, the twelve individual plaintiffs.  First is Michael Acosta, a 49-year-old \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  engineering manager of mixed ethnicity.  Dkt. 3, ¶ 16.  Acosta was attempting to shop at \nDict  15  Walmart or Target on May 29, 2020, but discovered they were both closed.  Id., ¶ 80.  As \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  he was driving back home, he “became aware that a large demonstration was going on” \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  and “wanted to show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.”  Id.  Acosta was in \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  a crowd of people when police officers allegedly “threw a flash bang grenade and/or \nN\n19  stinger grenades.”  Id., ¶ 83.  A San Jose police officer then “shot Acosta in the eye with \n20  an impact munition,” causing him to lose all vision as he “fell to one knee.”  Id., ¶ 84.  \n21  Police officers did not come to his aid, but other protestors helped bandage his eye.  Id., \n22  ¶ 85.  Acosta went to the hospital later that night, and underwent surgery to “completely \n23  remove his eye globe as a result of being shot.”  Id., ¶ 87.   \n24    The second individual plaintiff is Joseph Cañas, a 26-year-old musician of mixed \n25  ethnicity.  Dkt. 3, ¶ 17.  Cañas was at the protest on May 29, 2020, “peacefully playing \n26  his guitar” when he “heard an announcement from the police, but could not make out the \n27  words.”  Id., ¶ 55.  The complaint alleges that a San Jose police officer (either defendant \n28  Jared Yuen, or a ‘Doe’ officer) “shot Mr. Cañas in the eye with an impact munition, \n2 \n\n \n1  causing searing pain and permanently damaging his vision.”  Id. \n2    The third individual plaintiff is Leslie Vasquez, a 32-year-old Latinx woman who \n3  works in the maternity and children’s division of a hospital.  Dkt. 3, ¶ 18.  Vasquez was at \n4  the protest with her sister, Yessica Riles, who is also a plaintiff in this case.  Vasquez and \n5  Riles attended the protest on May 29, 2020.  When the police arrived, Vasquez and Riles \n6  “became separated in the crowd.”  Id., ¶ 61.  Vasquez “saw police were shooting a young \n7  woman with impact munitions” and “tried to help the woman.”  Id., ¶ 62.  When Vasquez \n8  tried to help, she was shot “in the groin at close range” by defendant Jared Yuen or a \n9  ‘Doe’ defendant.  Id.  Another officer “hit [her] in the stomach with his baton multiple times \n10  and pushed her, even though she put her hands up.”  Id., ¶ 63.   \n11    Yessica Riles is listed as the sixth individual plaintiff in the complaint, but the court \n a  12  includes her factual allegations here because they overlap with Vasquez’s.  Riles is a 41-\nurtni\noor 13  year-old Latinx labor and delivery nurse.  Dkt. 3, ¶ 21.  After being separated from \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  Vasquez, Riles went looking for her, and saw her “standing in front of the police line with \nDict  15  her hands up.”  Id., ¶ 64.  Riles also “put her hands up too in a gesture of ‘don’t shoot,’” \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  but a San Jose police officer “took aim and shot her, too, in the abdomen with an impact \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  munition.”  Id. ¶ 65.  Riles further alleges that she was shot in the groin and pelvic region.  \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  Id.  Riles further alleges that police “failed to give clear warnings before using force,” and \nN\n19  that she heard police give an amplified dispersal order “only after they had already shot \n20  her and multiple others.”  Id., ¶ 67.  \n21    The fourth individual plaintiff is Peter Allen, a 43-year-old white communications \n22  specialist.  Dkt. 3, ¶ 19.  Allen attended the protest on May 29, 2020, and “observed the \n23  crowd was peaceful and posed no threat to the police.”  Id., ¶ 95.  The police then \n24  “suddenly . . . charged the demonstrators while throwing explosive flashbangs and/or OC \n25  blast stinger grenades into the crowd.”  Id., ¶ 96.  Allen “tried to back away but before he \n26  could do so,” a San Jose police officer “shoved him forcefully to the ground with his \n27  baton.”  Id.  Allen tried to stand up and back away, but the same officer “used his baton to \n28  shove him to the ground again.”  Id.  Allen then stood up and “jogged away from the \n3 \n\n \n1  police line.”  Id., ¶ 97.  When he was about 20 yards away, “he turned to face them with \n2  his hands up in a gesture of ‘don’t shoot’ while backing away from them,” and a San Jose \n3  police officer “proceeded to shoot him in the left upper thigh with an impact munition.”  Id.  \n4  An officer then “shot him again, this time in the left upper chest with an impact munition.”  \n5  Id., ¶ 98.   \n6    The fifth individual plaintiff is Shaunn Cartwright, a 51-year-old disabled, white \n7  woman who “attended the San Jose demonstrations on May 29, 30, and 31, 2020 as a \n8  legal observer.”  Dkt. 3, ¶ 20.  Cartwright “suffers from trigeminal neuralgia and has a \n9  brain implant to treat this that runs on a battery implanted in her chest.”  Id.  Her right \n10  knee was surgically replaced in October 2019, and her left knee also needed \n11  replacement at the time of the May 2020 protests.  Id.  On May 29, 2020, Cartwright \n a  12  observed San Jose police officers “shooting impact munitions into the crowd of \nurtni\noor 13  demonstrators,” and also saw officers “throw two people, including a young teen girl, to \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  the ground [] and beat them with batons.”  Id., ¶ 74.  Cartwright “attempted to take \nDict  15  photographs to document and discourage this police use of force,” but defendant police \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  officer Fnu Delgado or a ‘Doe’ officer “shoved her in the chest very forcefully.”  Id.  \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  Cartwright told the officer that she had a brain injury, but “he shoved her twice more.”  Id. \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  On May 30, 2020, Cartwright observed the police using chemical agents against \nN\n19  the protestors, and she “stayed in what she thought was a safe spot against a wall” \n20  because she was physically unable to run.  Dkt. 3, ¶ 102.  A San Jose police officer then \n21  “shot at her four times in quick succession with impact munitions,” striking her right knee, \n22  as well as her calf and finger.  Id.   \n23    On May 31, 2020, Cartwright went to the protest to “distribute a legal hotline \n24  number to demonstrators and again serve as a legal observer.”  Dkt. 3, ¶ 116.  She was \n25  wearing a “green ‘legal observer’ hat and a face mask to protect her and others from \n26  COVID-19.”  Id.  That same day, at around 5:30pm, the City of San Jose had announced \n27  a curfew to go into effect at 8:30pm that night.  At around 8:30pm, Cartwright was \n28  “peacefully talking on the sidewalk” with medics and journalists, when San Jose police \n4 \n\n \n1  officers “threatened them with arrest telling them that they were going to be made \n2  examples of and were going to jail for violating the curfew.”  Id., ¶ 118.  Cartwright \n3  “explained that she was a legal observer and that others were medics and journalists,” \n4  but they were arrested later that night.  Id.  Cartwright then alleges that she was held in a \n5  patrol car with two officers who were not wearing masks, then was forced to sit in a bus \n6  with people without masks, and then was dropped off in a mall parking lot at 1am, after \n7  public transportation had stopped running, and “with no way to get home, and despite the \n8  still ongoing curfew.”  Id., ¶¶ 119-120.   \n9    The sixth individual plaintiff is Yessica Riles, who was already discussed above. \n10    The seventh individual plaintiff is Jose Gustavo Flores Rodriguez (referred to as \n11  “Gustavo Flores” in the complaint), a 48-year-old Latinx commercial driver.  Dkt. 3, ¶ 22.  \n a  12  Flores was present at the May 29, 2020 protest, and heard one San Jose police officer \nurtni\noor 13  “tell the other [] officers, softly, ‘get ready to shoot!’”  Id., ¶ 69.  The officers did not make \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  any announcement or warning to the crowd, so Flores “tried to warn the other \nDict  15  demonstrators, walking down the front line of demonstrators suggesting that they put \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  their hands up in a gesture of ‘don’t shoot’ to show they were unarmed [and] did not pose \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  a threat.”  Id.  While Flores was doing so, a San Jose police officer “shot him in the groin \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  and testicle with an impact munition.”  Id.  Flores fell to the ground, and as he got up, he \nN\n19  saw the officer reloading his gun.  Id., ¶ 70.  As Flores was trying to walk away, someone \n20  warned that the officer was aiming at him again, and when Flores turned to look, the \n21  officer shot him in his left collarbone with another impact munition.  Id. \n22    The eighth individual plaintiff is Alex Lee, a 25-year-old Asian member of the \n23  California state assembly1.  Dkt. 3, ¶ 23.  Lee attended the protest on May 29, 2020, and \n24  observed officers shoot “impact munitions, explosive grenades, and chemical agents at \n25  the demonstrators,” who were not “threatening the police in any way.”  Id., ¶ 99.  The next \n26  night, Lee also observed police firing “munitions, grenades, and chemical agents” into a \n27 \n \n1 Lee was elected to the assembly in the 2020 general election, he was a candidate at \n28 \nthe time of the protests. \n5 \n\n \n1  crowd without warning, and was struck by a tear gas canister or grenade.  Id., ¶¶ 100-\n2  101.  The day after that, on May 31, Lee was standing with plaintiff Cartwright and \n3  medics and journalists when he was arrested for violating curfew.  Id., ¶ 118. \n4    The ninth individual plaintiff is Joseph Maldonado, a 33-year-old Latinx technology \n5  administrator.  Dkt. 3, ¶ 24.  On May 29, 2020, Maldonado attended the protest and \n6  “observed only peaceful demonstrating – nothing that would justify the use of chemical \n7  weapons – but noticed that the police put on gas masks.”  Id., ¶ 76.  The officers then \n8  “launched a chemical agent, most likely teargas, into the crowd,” causing Maldonado to \n9  experience “an intense burning sensation.”  Id., ¶ 77.   \n10  The tenth individual plaintiff is Cindy Cuellar, a 22-year-old Latinx recent graduate \n11  of San Jose State University.  Dkt. 3, ¶ 25.  Cuellar attended the May 29, 2020 protest \n a  12  and saw officers “shoot impact munitions into the crowd,” hitting a friend of hers who is a \nurtni\noor 13  journalist.  Id., ¶ 57-58.  When Cuellar went to her friend’s aid, an officer shot Cuellar in \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  her left calf.  Id., ¶ 58. \nDict  15  The eleventh individual plaintiff is Mahmoudreza Naemeh, a 30-year-old Iranian \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  chemical analyst.  Dkt. 3, ¶ 26.  Naemeh attended the May 30 protest and saw officers \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  block an intersection with a line of officers.  Id., ¶ 104.  Naemeh “walked backward on the \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  sidewalk away from the police with his hands up,” but an officer “shot him in the shin just \nN\n19  below his knee with an impact munition.”  Id.  Naemeh walked away, looking for his friend \n20  who was giving him a ride home, and came upon a small group of demonstrators.  Id., \n21  ¶¶ 105-106.  A group of San Jose police officers “charged towards them on foot and \n22  motorcycles . . . surrounding the demonstrators so they could not leave.”  Id., ¶ 106.  \n23  Naemeh was tackled and arrested along with 30-40 other people.  Id.   \n24  An officer told Naemeh that “he was the person responsible for throwing frozen \n25  water bottles,” which Naemeh denied.  Dkt. 3, ¶ 107.  When Naemeh provided his \n26  identification, an officer asked how to pronounce his name, and Naemeh said to call him \n27  “Reza” (short for Mahmoudreza).  Id.  The officers continued to call him “Mohammed,” \n28  even after he corrected them and asked to be called “Reza.”  Id.  Naemeh further alleges \n6 \n\n \n1  that a ‘Doe’ officer photographed him, but not any other arrestees, which “felt like an act \n2  of intimidation.”  Id.  Naemeh further alleges that officers removed his face mask without \n3  consent, and that he was held in two enclosed vehicles with other people who were not \n4  wearing masks.  Id., ¶ 108.  After approximately three hours in custody, Naemeh was \n5  released without being charged with a crime.  Id., ¶¶ 108, 110. \n6  The twelfth individual plaintiff is Megan Swift, a 49-year-old white community \n7  organizer.  Dkt. 3, ¶ 27.  On May 29, 2020, Swift “heard about the police violence” and \n8  went to the demonstration “with water and first aid materials, including gauze and gloves” \n9  in order to “bring aid in support of the racial justice demonstrators.”  Id., ¶ 89.  When she \n10  arrived, she saw the police “charge the crowd with guns and/or launchers raised, while \n11  throwing explosive flashbang and/or OC blast stinger grenades into the crowd.”  Id., ¶ 90.  \n a  12  She then saw officers form a line and march towards her and other demonstrators, yelling \nurtni\noor 13  “move.”  Id., ¶ 91.  Swift “tried to comply by stepping back,” but defendant officer Sean \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  Michael Curry and/or a ‘Doe’ officer “stepped out of the police line multiple times to strike \nDict  15  Swift hard in two-handed blows with his club.”  Id.  A nearby demonstrator yelled at the \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  officer to stop hitting Swift.  The officer hit Swift one more time, then “grabbed her and \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  dragged her through and behind the police line,” then handcuffed her with her hands \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  behind her back.  Id., ¶ 92.  Swift was detained for three hours, then released without \nN\n19  being charged with any crime.  Id., ¶ 93-94.   \n20    Named as defendants are one organization defendant (the City of San Jose), nine \n21  individual defendants, and then Doe defendants.  The nine individual defendants are as \n22  follows: (1) Sam Liccardo, mayor of San Jose at all relevant times, (2) David Sykes, city \n23  manager of San Jose at all relevant times, (3) Edgardo Garcia, police chief of the San \n24  Jose Police Department at all relevant times, (4) Jason Dwyer, a captain with the San \n25  Jose Police Department and the ‘special operations commander’ during the May 2020 \n26  protests, (5) Ronnie Lopez, a sergeant with the San Jose Police Department, (6) Lee \n27  Tassio, a sergeant with the San Jose Police Department, (7) Jared Yuen, an officer with \n28  the San Jose Police Department who is alleged to have participated in the conduct \n7 \n\n \n1  related to plaintiffs Cañas and Vasquez, (8) Sean Michael Curry2, an officer with the San \n2  Jose Police Department who is alleged to have participated in the conduct related to \n3  plaintiff Swift, and (9) Fnu Delgado, an officer with the San Jose Police Department who \n4  is alleged to have participated in the conduct related to plaintiff Cartwright.   \n5    The complaint purports to assert sixteen causes of action, though the first is for \n6  “injunctive relief” and the second is for “declaratory relief,” which are types of remedies \n7  rather than standalone causes of action.  That leaves fourteen substantive causes of \n8  action to be analyzed on this motion.   \n9    After briefing was complete, but before the motion to dismiss hearing, the court \n10  issued an order noting that “the complaint is unclear in stating which claims are being \n11  asserted by which plaintiffs against which defendants,” and directing plaintiffs to file a \n a  12  chart providing a more specific identification of claims, plaintiffs, and defendants.  See \nurtni\noor 13  Dkt. 35.  Plaintiffs filed their chart the next day.  See Dkt. 37.  In most instances, the chart \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  narrowed the scope of asserted claims.  For instance, the complaint states that the \nDict  15  eleventh cause of action is asserted against all defendants, whereas the claim chart \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  narrows the claim such that it is asserted against only the City of San Jose.  However, in \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  other instances, the claim chart purports to widen the scope of asserted plaintiffs or \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  defendants.  For instance, the complaint limits the seventh cause of action to a subset of \nN\n19  plaintiffs and defendants, whereas the claim chart purports to expand the cause of action \n20  such that it is asserted by all plaintiffs against all defendants.  The court will not accept \n21  any attempt to add new plaintiffs or defendants to any claim, and will incorporate \n22  plaintiffs’ chart only to the extent that it narrows the number of plaintiffs or defendants.   \n23  The fourteen substantive causes of action are as follows (using the numbering of \n24  the complaint): \n25   \n26 \n \n2 The court notes that the heading of the complaint lists “Sean Michael Curry,” while the \n27 \nbody of the complaint refers to Stephen Michael Curry.  Because the name listed on the \ncourt’s docket is Sean Michael Curry, the court will use that name unless a correction is \n28 \nfiled on the docket. \n8 \n\n \n(3) violation of First Amendment rights under section 1983, asserted by all \n1 \nplaintiffs against all defendants, \n \n2 \n(4) excessive force in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, under \n3  section 1983, asserted by all plaintiffs against all defendants, \n \n4  (5) wrongful arrest in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, under \nsection 1983, asserted by plaintiffs Cartwright, Lee, Swift, Naemeh, NAACP, and \n5 \nSJPJC, against defendants City of San Jose, Sykes, Garcia, and Dwyer,3 \n \n6 \n(6) violation of the Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection, under section \n7  1983, asserted by plaintiffs Acosta, Cañas, Vasquez, Riles, Flores, Lee, \nMaldonado, Cuellar, Naemeh, NAACP, and SJPJC, against all defendants, \n8 \n \n(7) violation of the right to freedom of movement under the Fourth, Ninth, and \n9 \nFourteenth Amendment, under section 19834, asserted by plaintiffs NAACP, \nSJPJC, Lee, and Cartwright, against defendants City of San Jose, Liccardo, \n10 \nSykes, and Garcia,5 \n11    \n(8) failure to intervene under section 1983, asserted by all plaintiffs against \n a  12  defendants Sykes, Garcia, Dwyer, Yuen, Curry, and Delgado,6 \nourtorni 13    \nt Calif (9) conspiracy to deprive plaintiffs of their constitutional rights, under section 1983, \nstricof C 14  a  sserted by all plaintiffs against all defendants, \nDict  15  (10) violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, asserted by plaintiffs \ns ri\nest Cartwright and SJPJC against defendant City of San Jose,  \ntatDi 16   \nS \nn\nd er 17  (11) violation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, asserted by plaintiffs \ne\nth Cartwright and SJPJC against defendant City of San Jose, \nnirt\nUo 18   \nN\n(12) violation of the California Bane Act, asserted by all plaintiffs against all \n19  defendants, \n \n20 \n(13) violation of the California Ralph Act, asserted by all plaintiffs against all \ndefendants, \n21 \n \n22  (14) assault and battery under state law, asserted by all plaintiffs against all \ndefendants, \n23 \n \n24 \n3 Plaintiffs’ claim chart also includes Liccardo, Lopez, Tassio, and Curry as defendants, \nbut because they were not named as a defendants on this claim in the complaint, they \n25 \nwill not be added now.   \n4 The complaint cites to section 1982, but that appears to be a typo.  \n26 \n5 As mentioned above, the claim chart purports to expand this claim to be asserted by all \nplaintiffs against all defendants, but that attempted expansion is rejected.   \n27 \n6 Plaintiffs’ chart purports to add the City of San Jose as a defendant on this claim, but \nthe City was not named on this cause of action in the complaint, and will not be added \n28 \nnow.   \n9 \n\n \n(15) false arrest and false imprisonment under state law, asserted by plaintiffs \n1 \nCartwright, Lee, Swift, Naemeh, NAACP, and SJPJC, against defendants City of \nSan Jose, Sykes, Garcia, and Dwyer,7 and \n2 \n \n3  (16) negligence under state law, asserted by all plaintiffs against all defendants. \n  Defendants now move to dismiss the entirety of the complaint.     \n4 \n5  DISCUSSION \n6  A.  Legal Standard \n7  A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) tests for the \n8  legal sufficiency of the claims alleged in the complaint.  Ileto v. Glock, Inc., 349 F.3d \n9  1191, 1199-1200 (9th Cir. 2003).  Review is limited to the contents of the complaint.  \n10  Allarcom Pay Television, Ltd. v. Gen. Instrument Corp., 69 F.3d 381, 385 (9th Cir. 1995).  \n11  To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a complaint generally must \n a  12  satisfy only the minimal notice pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \nurtni\nCofor 13  8, which requires that a complaint include a “short and plain statement of the claim \nt ali\ncC\nstriof  14  showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).   \ns Dirict  15  A complaint may be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim if the \net\ns\natDi 16  plaintiff fails to state a cognizable legal theory, or has not alleged sufficient facts to \nt\nS \nn\ned er 17  support a cognizable legal theory.  Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep't, 901 F.2d 696, 699 \nh\nt\nnirt\nUNo 18  (9th Cir. 1990).  The court is to “accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and \n19  construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.”  Outdoor \n20  Media Group, Inc. v. City of Beaumont, 506 F.3d 895, 899-900 (9th Cir. 2007).   \n21  However, legally conclusory statements, not supported by actual factual \n22  allegations, need not be accepted.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678-79 (2009).  The \n23  allegations in the complaint “must be enough to raise a right to relief above the \n24  speculative level.”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (citations \n25  and quotations omitted).  A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual \n26 \n \n27 \n7 As with the fifth cause of action for wrongful arrest under federal law, plaintiffs’ chart \npurports to add Liccardo, Lopez, Tassio, and Curry as defendants, but that attempt is \n28 \nrejected.   \n10 \n\n \n1  content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable \n2  for the misconduct alleged.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citation omitted).  In the event \n3  dismissal is warranted, it is generally without prejudice, unless it is clear the complaint \n4  cannot be saved by any amendment.  See Sparling v. Daou, 411 F.3d 1006, 1013 (9th \n5  Cir. 2005). \n6  Review is generally limited to the contents of the complaint, although the court can \n7  also consider a document on which the complaint relies if the document is central to the \n8  claims asserted in the complaint, and no party questions the authenticity of the \n9  document.  See Sanders v. Brown, 504 F.3d 903, 910 (9th Cir. 2007).  The court may \n10  consider matters that are properly the subject of judicial notice, Knievel v. ESPN, 393 \n11  F.3d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir. 2005); Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688-89 (9th \n a  12  Cir. 2001), and may also consider exhibits attached to the complaint, see Hal Roach \nurtni\noor 13  Studios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner & Co., Inc., 896 F.2d 1542, 1555 n.19 (9th Cir. 1989), and \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  documents referenced extensively in the complaint and documents that form the basis of \nDict  15  a the plaintiff’s claims.  See No. 84 Emp’r-Teamster Jt. Counsel Pension Tr. Fund v. Am. \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  W. Holding Corp., 320 F.3d 920, 925 n.2 (9th Cir. 2003). \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  B.  Analysis \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  1.  Qualified immunity \nN\n19    Before addressing the causes of action individually, the court notes that much of \n20  defendants’ motion is based on qualified immunity.  The defense of qualified immunity \n21  protects “government officials . . . from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct \n22  does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a \n23  reasonable person would have known.”  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).  \n24  A court considering a claim of qualified immunity must determine whether the plaintiff has \n25  alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right and whether such right was clearly \n26  established such that it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was \n27  unlawful in the situation he confronted.  See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 \n28  (2009). \n11 \n\n \n1    While courts may consider qualified immunity at the pleadings stage, the Ninth \n2  Circuit has noted that “[d]etermining claims of qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss \n3  stage raises special problems for legal decision making.”  Keates v. Kolie, 883 F.3d 1228, \n4  1234 (9th Cir. 2018) (citing Kwai Fun Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952, 956-57 (9th \n5  Cir. 2004)).  The Ninth Circuit has also observed that, by considering qualified immunity \n6  at the pleadings stage, “the courts may be called upon to decide far-reaching \n7  constitutional questions on a nonexistent factual record.”  Kwai Fun Wong, 373 F.3d at \n8  957.   \n9    Moreover, as seen above in the Background section of this order, many of the \n10  factual allegations are specific to each plaintiff and not amenable to a blanket ruling of \n11  qualified immunity.  For those reasons, the court is inclined to consider defendants’ \n a  12  qualified immunity arguments at the summary judgment stage, when the court will have \nurtni\noor 13  the benefit of a developed factual record.  While defendants may ultimately prevail on \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  many of the arguments it makes now with respect to qualified immunity, because the \nDict  15  qualified immunity analysis often turns on the specific facts of each alleged violation, the \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  court finds that the qualified immunity arguments are better suited to summary judgment.   \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  2.  Municipal and supervisory liability \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  Defendants’ motion also presents a threshold issue regarding municipal and \nN\n19  supervisory liability.  Because these issues are raised in connection with many of the \n20  individual causes of action, the court will first address the parties’ arguments here. \n21    Under Monell v. Dept. of Soc. Servs. of City of New York, a city is not liable for the \n22  torts of its agents unless the city’s policymakers adopted a policy or custom that was the \n23  “moving force” behind the alleged violations.  Monell, 436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978).  The \n24  inadequacy of police training may serve as the basis for liability, but “only where the \n25  failure to train amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the \n26  police come into contact.”  City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 388 (1989). \n27  Defendants argue that there was no policy or custom behind the alleged violations, \n28  and further argue that plaintiffs’ “failure to train” theory is not viable because plaintiffs do \n12 \n\n \n1  not allege facts showing that the training program before May 2020 was constitutionally \n2  inadequate.   \n3    Plaintiffs point to the following three categories of allegations: (1) defendants \n4  adopted specific policies for a curfew and to allow expanded use of dangerous riot \n5  weapons, (2) defendants encouraged, tolerated, and ratified a series of racist policing \n6  and excessive force incidents over the years, and (3) defendants failed to train officers \n7  despite obvious knowledge of a culture of white supremacist racism and history of \n8  excessive force.  See Dkt. 32 at 19.  Plaintiffs also point to the complaint’s allegations \n9  that city policymakers “changed its policies days before the May 29, 2020 demonstration \n10  to allow use of additional chemical agent devices and allow use of impact munitions that \n11  it had previously prohibited in crowd control situations.”  Dkt. 3, ¶ 192.  Plaintiffs argue \n a  12  that these allegations support all three theories of Monell liability as used in the Ninth \nurtni\noor 13  Circuit: (1) an unconstitutional custom or policy, (2) deliberately indifferent omission, such \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  as a failure to train, and (3) a final policymaker’s involvement in, or ratification of, the \nDict  15  conduct underlying the violation of rights.  See Clouthier v. County of Contra Costa, 591 \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  F.3d 1232, 1249-50 (9th Cir. 2010).   \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17     As to the individual supervisory defendants, the Ninth Circuit has held that \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  supervisors may be liable for the constitutional violations of their subordinates “when \nN\n19  culpable action, or inaction, is directly attributed to them.”  652 F.3d 1202, 1205 (9th Cir. \n20  2011).  A defendant may be held liable as a supervisor under § 1983 “if there exists \n21  either (1) his or her personal involvement in the constitutional deprivation, or (2) a \n22  sufficient causal connection between the supervisor's wrongful conduct and the \n23  constitutional violation.”  Id. at 1207.  The supervisor need not be “directly and personally \n24  involved in the same way as are the individual officers who are on the scene inflicting \n25  constitutional injury.”  Id. at 1205.  “Rather, the supervisor's participation could include his \n26  own culpable action or inaction in the training, supervision, or control of his subordinates, \n27  his acquiescence in the constitutional deprivations of which the complaint is made, or \n28  conduct that showed a reckless or callous indifference to the rights of others.”  Id. at \n13 \n\n \n1  1205-06.   \n2    Plaintiffs argue that the complaint provides specific allegations regarding the \n3  personal involvement of the supervisory defendants, and argue that such allegations are \n4  sufficient at the pleadings stage of the case.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that \n5  defendants Liccardo, Garcia, and Sykes caused the constitutional violations by \n6  “equipping inadequately trained officers with highly dangerous impact munitions, \n7  explosive grenades, and chemical weapons,” and “approving the use” of those weapons \n8  at the demonstrations, “which resulted in such weapons being used in an unconstitutional \n9  [and] excessive manner.”  Dkt. 3, ¶ 193.  Plaintiffs also allege that Liccardo, Garcia, and \n10  Sykes made “the decision to declare a curfew on May 31, which was unconstitutional,” \n11  and “used as a pretext to wrongfully arrest 70 people.”  Id., ¶ 190.   \n a  12  Plaintiffs further allege that Dwyer, Lopez, and Tassio were “supervising and \nurtni\noor 13  giving direct orders at the scene.”  Dkt. 32 at 18.  Plaintiffs cite an order from another \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  court in this district, in a case also arising out of last year’s protests: \nDict  15   \ns ri [I]n a more typical police case, involving an isolated incident of alleged \net\natDis 16  misconduct against one or two citizens, it is hard to infer that the conduct of \nSt  a police officer is attributable to the municipality.  And in such a case, it \nn\nd er 17  might be a stretch to infer—merely from a police chief’s after-the-fact \ne\nh\nnitrt general defense of the officer—that the municipality is responsible for the \nUNo 18  officer’s conduct. \n… \n19 \nThis case involves a different situation. The complaint suggests that the \nBlack Lives Matter protests (along with the activity that spun off from the \n20 \nprotests) gripped Santa Rosa, prompting the full attention of the entire \n21  police department, from the police chief to command staff to line officers.  In \ntimes like that, when the department is executing an organized, \n22 \ndepartment-wide response, one can presume that the police chief was in \ncontrol of his department, either directing that response himself or—at the \n23 \nvery least—ratifying the actions of his subordinates.  Therefore, it becomes \neasier to infer that the repeated conduct of individual police officers is really \n24 \nthe conduct of the department, particularly when the police chief makes \n25  comments that could be interpreted as suggesting that the officers who \nused force did not meaningfully deviate from the department’s plan for how \n26 \nto control the crowds. \n… \n27 \nIn requesting dismissal of this claim, the City appears to ask the Court to \n28  draw an inference that the police chief was not meaningfully aware of either \n14 \n\n \nthe department’s plan for responding to the protests or the degree to which \n1 \nthe conduct of the officers involved in these high-profile incidents \nconformed to that plan.  It would not be appropriate to draw that inference \n2 \nat this stage of the case, where the allegations in the complaint must be \n3  presumed true and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in the plaintiffs’ \nfavor. Instead, it is reasonable to infer that the conduct of the individual \n4  officers was directed or ratified by the police chief. \n5  Martinez v. City of Santa Rosa, 499 F.Supp.3d 748, 750 (N.D. Cal. 2020) (emphasis \n6  added). \n7  The court finds Martinez to be persuasive in the context of the present case.  All of \n8  the plaintiffs in this case were either targeted with impact munitions or chemical agents \n9  and/or arrested under a challenged curfew order.  Plaintiffs have alleged that “defendants \n10  adopted specific policies for a curfew and to allow expanded use of dangerous riot \n11  weapons,” and at the pleadings stage, these allegations are sufficient.  While defendants \n a  12  may ultimately succeed in showing that the supervisory defendants did not actually have \nurtni\noor 13  any role in causing the alleged violations, any such showing requires the development of \nCf\nt ali\ncC\nstriof  14  a factual record.   \nDict  15    Moreover, specifically as to the “failure to train’ allegations, the court points out \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  that defendants’ own “after-action report,” of which defendants have requested judicial \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  notice8, specifically states that “crowd control training has been minimal and infrequent” \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  and that “commanders lacked sufficient training and experience” in crowd control.  Dkt. \nN\n19  27-1 at 4.   \n20    As with qualified immunity, defendants may ultimately prevail on this issue after \n21  the development of a factual record.  However, at this stage of the case, the court will not \n22  issue a blanket dismissal for all municipal and supervisory defendants.   \n23  3.  Third cause of action (violation of the First Amendment) \n24  Defendants’ motion points out that plaintiffs’ third cause of action advances two \n25  First Amendment theories: (1) viewpoint discrimination, based on the argument that their \n26  participation in the protests was a substantial or motivating factor in the use of force, and \n27 \n \n8 Defendants’ request for judicial notice is GRANTED to the extent the report is cited in \n28 \nplaintiffs’ complaint. \n15 \n\n \n1  (2) suppression of speech based on the curfew order.  See also Dkt. 3, ¶¶ 235, 236.  The \n2  court will address the two theories separately. \n3  a.  Viewpoint discrimination \n4  To demonstrate a First Amendment violation, plaintiffs must allege (1) they were \n5  engaged in a constitutionally protected activity, (2) the defendants’ actions would chill a \n6  person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in the protected activity, and (3) \n7  the protected activity was a substantial or motivating factor in the defendants’ conduct.  \n8  See Index Newspapers LLC v. U.S. Marshals Service, 977 F.3d 817, 827 (9th Cir. 2020); \n9  Pinard v. Clatskanie Sch. Dist., 467 F.3d 755, 770 (9th Cir. 2006).   \n10  Defendants appear to challenge only the third element, arguing that plaintiffs \n11  “allege no facts plausibly establishing that the officers’ force was motivated by invidious \n a  12  speech-based animus rather than legitimate law-enforcement purposes.”  Dkt. 33 at 1.  \nurtni\noor 13  Defendants further argue that any allegations regarding animus are “sheer speculation” \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  because “plaintiffs do not allege that any police officer who arrested or used force against \nDict  15  a protestor made remarks to suggest hostility towards plaintiffs’ views or affiliation while \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  doing so.”  Dkt. 27 at 3. \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  Plaintiffs respond by arguing that the third element can be demonstrated “through \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  direct or circumstantial evidence” and “involves questions of fact that normally should be \nN\n19  left for trial.”  Index Newspapers, 977 F.3d at 827.   \n20    Plaintiffs then cite numerous cases dealing with the same issue in the context of \n21  the 2020 protests and finding in the plaintiffs’ favor.  For instance, another court in this \n22  district concluded that the alleged “aggressive conduct” by officers, “such as shooting a \n23  reporter with a rubber bullet even though it does not appear she was engaged in illegal \n24  activity or posed a threat of any kind, raises a serious question as to whether some of the \n25  uses of force described in those declarations was in reaction to the anti-police message \n26  of the protests and aimed at intimidating protestors to deter such speech.”  Anti Police-\n27  Terror Project v. City of Oakland, 477 F.Supp.3d 1066, 1088 (N.D. Cal. 2020).   \n28    Another district court case noted that “officers indiscriminately used force against \n16 \n\n \n1  peaceful protestors on multiple occasions,” including “continu[ing] to fire tear gas \n2  canisters as people attempted to leave the protest area.”  Based on those allegations, the \n3  court concluded that “preventing criminal activity . . . was not the sole purpose of \n4  [officers’] use of force,” and that they instead “may have been substantially motivated by \n5  an intent to interfere with plaintiffs’ constitutionally protected expression.”  Don’t Shoot \n6  Portland v. City of Portland, 465 F.Supp.3d 1150, 1155-56 (D. Or. 2020).   \n7    In another case arising out of the police response to the 2020 protests, the court \n8  relied on the allegation that officers “indiscriminately threw an excessive amount of \n9  chemical agents at peaceful protests” in concluding that the protected activity was a \n10  substantial or motivating factor of the use of force.  Black Lives Matter Seattle-King \n11  County v. City of Seattle, 466 F.Supp.3d 1206, 1214 (W.D. Wash. 2020) (“The use of \n a  12  indiscriminate weapons against all protestors – not just the violent ones – supports the \nurtni\noor 13  inference that SPD’s actions were substantially motivated by the plaintiffs’ protected First \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  Amendment activity.”).   \nDict  15    In addition to those cases, plaintiffs cite to the allegations of the complaint, which \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  support the inference that their protected activity was a substantial or motivating factor of \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  the use of force.  Specifically, they point to allegations that officers shot impact munitions \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  and chemical weapons at people who were kneeling on the ground praying, standing with \nN\n19  their hands up, playing the guitar, trying to walk away, or otherwise peacefully \n20  demonstrating.  See, e.g., Dkt. 3, ¶¶ 52, 55, 63, 90.  The complaint also cites to a video \n21  of defendant Yuen where he “appeared visibly excited and eager to shoot demonstrators” \n22  as he shouted “Let’s get this motherfucker!” and “Shut up, bitch!” to a woman who asked \n23  him a question.  Id., ¶ 181.  In the complaint, plaintiff Swift also alleges that she saw \n24  officers “take a group selfie” and “making jokes about George Floyd’s death.”  Id., ¶ 180.   \n25    In their reply, defendants seek to distinguish the 2020 cases cited by plaintiffs by \n26  arguing that those court were conducting a preliminary injunction analysis and are \n27  therefore inapplicable.   \n28    Overall, as to the argument that defendants violated plaintiffs’ First Amendment \n17 \n\n \n1  rights by using force against them because of their participation in the protests (i.e., \n2  because of their viewpoint), plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a claim for pleading \n3  purposes.  The cited district court cases are persuasive, and defendants’ argument to \n4  distinguish them based on their procedural posture is rejected.  If anything, the different \n5  procedural posture makes them even more persuasive, because on a motion for \n6  preliminary injunction, the court does not take all of plaintiff’s allegations as true, but \n7  rather weighs the credibility of the evidence from both sides.  On this motion, where the \n8  court is to take all of plaintiffs’ allegations as true, including their allegations as to the \n9  substantial or motivating factor behind the defendants’ conduct, the court concludes that \n10  plaintiffs have adequately alleged a claim for a First Amendment violation based on \n11  viewpoint discrimination.  As other district courts have noted, given that the protestors \n a  12  were specifically protesting police misconduct, it is reasonable to allege that the \nurtni\noor 13  protestors’ viewpoint was a substantial or motivating cause – even if not necessarily the \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  sole cause – behind the defendants’ conduct.  Defendants also argue that plaintiffs have \nDict  15  not alleged the violation of a clearly established First Amendment right, but that qualified \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  immunity argument will be considered on summary judgment, for the reasons set forth \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  above.   \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  Accordingly, the court DENIES defendants’ motion to dismiss the viewpoint \nN\n19  discrimination-related portion of plaintiffs’ third cause of action.    \n20  b.  Curfew \n21  Even in a public forum, the government “may impose reasonable restrictions on \n22  the time, place, or manner of protected speech.”  Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. \n23  781, 791 (1989).  To be constitutional, those restrictions must be: (1) “without reference \n24  to the content of the regulated speech,” i.e., content neutral, (2) “narrowly tailored to \n25  serve a significant government interest,” and must (3) “leave open ample alternative \n26  channels for communication of the information.”  Id.   \n27  In this case, the curfew order stated that “no person shall be upon the public \n28  street, avenue, alley, park, or other public place or unimproved public realty within the \n18 \n\n \n1  limits of the City of San Jose” from the hours from 8:30pm to 5:00am.  Dkt. 30, Ex. A.9  \n2  The curfew order states that it “shall not apply to police officers, peace officers, \n3  firefighters, or other emergency personnel or civilians engaged in police, emergency, \n4  government work, delivery services, or utility services, nor shall it apply to authorized \n5  representatives of any news service, newspaper, or radio or television station or network, \n6  nor shall it apply to individuals seeking or providing medical care or care for family \n7  members or others.”  Id.   \n8  Defendants argue, and plaintiffs do not dispute, that the curfew was content \n9  neutral.  Thus, the analysis turns on whether plaintiffs have adequately alleged that the \n10  curfew was not narrowly tailored and/or that it did not leave open ample alternative \n11  channels for communication.   \n a  12  Defendants’ briefing largely relies on one case, a Ninth Circuit case arising out of \nurtni\noor 13  the World Trade Organization (“WTO”) protests in Seattle in 1999 and the curfew that \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  was ordered in response.  See Menotti v. City of Seattle, 409 F.3d 1113 (9th Cir. 2005).  \nDict  15  And at the hearing, defendants’ counsel stated that “the analysis really begins and ends \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  with the Menotti decision.”  Dkt. 44 at 9. \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  However, critically, Menotti was decided on summary judgment, where the district \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  court had an evidentiary record by which to evaluate whether the challenged curfew was \nN\n19  narrowly tailored and whether it left open ample alternative channels for communication.  \n20  409 F.3d at 1119.  In contrast, on the present motion to dismiss for failure to state a \n21  claim, the court has no evidentiary record before it, and thus does not have adequate \n22  means of determining whether the challenged curfew was narrowly tailored or whether it \n23  left open ample alternative channels for communication.  That reason alone warrants \n24  denial of defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ third cause of action as to the curfew. \n25  For instance, there are no facts in the record about the location and scope of any \n26 \n \n27 \n9 Plaintiffs have requested judicial notice of the curfew order, and defendants have \nrequested judicial notice of the emergency order preceding the curfew order.  Both \n28 \nrequests are GRANTED.  See Dkt. 30, 27-1. \n19 \n\n \n1  looting and/or violence, which would inform the court’s analysis of whether the curfew \n2  order was narrowly tailored to the government interest in preventing property damage.  \n3  Defendants’ argument appears to presume that simply by invoking the specter of \n4  property damage, a citywide curfew order was automatically warranted as a matter of \n5  law.  The court cannot rule on the issue of whether the curfew order was narrowly tailored \n6  without more facts regarding the nature of the disorder which the curfew sought to \n7  prevent.  The court further notes that the curfew was not ordered until May 31, 2020, two \n8  days after the demonstrations had begun, suggesting that the course of events during the \n9  first two days of demonstrations had prompted defendants to issue the curfew order.  \n10  However, without a factual record to establish the specific events of those two days, the \n11  court cannot make a determination as to whether the curfew order passed constitutional \n a  12  muster.  \nurtni\noor 13  Moreover, even if the court were to compare the facts of Menotti to the facts set \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  forth in the present case, it would still appear that Menotti is distinguishable.  Whereas \nDict  15  the curfew order challenged in this case applied to the entire city of San Jose, the Menotti \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  court emphasized that the restriction “merely restricted access within a well-defined \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  security zone to facilitate a public event” and “did not apply generally to the City of \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  Seattle.”  409 F.3d at 1138.  The Menotti court further explained that the anti-WTO \nN\n19  protestors had the “ability to communicate directly across the street from most WTO \n20  venues.”  Id.  In contrast, the curfew order challenged in this case applied to the entire \n21  178 square miles of the city of San Jose.  Dkt. 32 at 10.  \n22  While plaintiffs have stated a viable claim as to the constitutionality of the curfew, \n23  defendants argue that “as a matter of law, only the City Manager [Sykes] had authority to \n24  impose the curfew at issue,” citing the city charter and municipal code.  Dkt. 27 at 4.  \n25  Defendants thus argue that the other supervisory defendants should be dismissed from \n26  any claim arising out of the curfew.  However, as discussed above, plaintiffs’ complaint \n27  does allege that Liccardo and Garcia were also personally involved in the curfew’s \n28  issuance, and given the citywide response to the protests as explained in Martinez, \n20 \n\n \n1  plaintiffs’ allegations are sufficient for purposes of this motion.  While defendants may \n2  later present evidence showing that only the city manager was involved in issuing the \n3  curfew order, at this stage of the case, plaintiffs have adequately alleged that defendants \n4  Liccardo and Garcia were also involved.   \n5   Accordingly, the court DENIES defendants’ motion to dismiss the curfew-related \n6  portion of plaintiffs’ third cause of action as to defendants Sykes, Liccardo, Garcia, and \n7  the City of San Jose, but GRANTS defendants’ motion to dismiss this claim with \n8  prejudice as to the remaining defendants, as the complaint does not allege that any other \n9  individual defendants were involved in issuing the curfew.  While the complaint did name \n10  all defendants as part of its third cause of action, the complaint made no distinction \n11  between the viewpoint discrimination-related and curfew-related portions of the claim.  \n a  12  On the viewpoint discrimination-related portion, plaintiffs did make allegations as to all \nurtni\noor 13  defendants, but on the curfew-related portion, they did not.  Nor did plaintiffs’ opposition \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  brief present any reason why the non-supervisory defendants should be considered \nDict  15  responsible for issuing the curfew order.  Thus, as to the curfew-related portion of the \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  third cause of action, no leave to amend is granted as to the dismissed defendants.      \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  4.  Fourth cause of action (excessive force) \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18    The next claim is the fourth cause of action, for excessive force in violation of the \nN\n19  Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Excessive force claims are governed by the \n20  “reasonableness” standard of the Fourth Amendment, which looks to whether the “nature \n21  and quality of the intrusion on the individual’s Fourth Amendment interests” is balanced \n22  against the “countervailing government interests.”  Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395 \n23  (1989).  In evaluating the government’s interest, courts look at (1) the severity of the \n24  crime at issue, (2) whether the suspect posed an immediate threat to the safety of the \n25  officers or others, and (3) whether the suspect was actively resisting arrest or attempting \n26  to evade arrest by flight.  Young v. City of Los Angeles, 655 F.3d 1156, 1163 (9th Cir. \n27  2011). \n28  Defendants’ motion starts by arguing that a viable excessive force claim depends \n21 \n\n \n1  on a threshold showing that plaintiffs were actually seized, and defendants argue that \n2  “the vast majority of them were not seized.”  Defendants focus on a recent Supreme \n3  Court case, Torres v. Madrid, which they argue supports their position.  141 S.Ct. 989 \n4  (2021).     \n5    In their opposition, plaintiffs argue that defendants have mischaracterized Torres.  \n6  In Torres, the only issue before the Court was whether a use of force qualifies as a \n7  “seizure” if the force fails to stop the person.  141 S.Ct. at 993.  Specifically, in Torres, a \n8  woman was shot, but the shot did not subdue her, and officers argued that she could not \n9  have been “seized” because she did not actually yield to the force.  Id. at 994.  The Court \n10  rejected that argument.  Id. at 1003. \n11    Plaintiffs instead point the court to Nelson v. City of Davis, 685 F.3d 867 (9th Cir. \n a  12  2012).  In Nelson, police officers shot pepperball guns (paintball guns that fire rounds \nurtni\noor 13  containing pepper spray) into a crowd with the stated purpose of dispersing them.  Id. at \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  873.  The plaintiff was struck in the eye, and asserted a Fourth Amendment excessive \nDict  15  force claim.  The officers argued that the plaintiff was not actually seized, but the court \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  rejected that argument, holding that “[a] person is seized by the police . . . when the \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  officer by means of physical force or show of authority terminates or restrains the \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  freedom of movement through means intentionally applied.”  Id. at 875 (citing Brendlin v. \nN\n19  California, 551 U.S. 249, 254 (2007)).  The court noted that the plaintiff was “hit in the eye \n20  by a projectile filled with pepper spray” and “rendered immobile until he was removed by \n21  an unknown individual,” and on those facts, the plaintiff “was both an object of intentional \n22  governmental force and his freedom of movement was limited as a result.”  Id. at 875-76.  \n23  The Nelson court then went on to explain that: \n \n24 \nRegardless of whether Nelson was the specific object of governmental \nforce, he and his fellow students were the undifferentiated objects of shots \n25 \nintentionally fired by the officers in the direction of that group.  Although the \n26  officers may have intended that the projectiles explode over the students’ \nheads or against the wall, the officers’ conduct resulted in Nelson being hit \n27  by a projectile that they intentionally fired towards a group of which he was \na member.  Their conduct was intentional, it was aimed towards Nelson and \n28 \nhis group, and it resulted in the application of physical force to Nelson’s \n22 \n\n \nperson as well as the termination of his movement.  Nelson was therefore \n1 \nintentionally seized under the 4th Amendment.  \n2 \nId. at 877.   \n3 \n  The Nelson court then specifically rejected the officers’ argument that “their \n4 \nactions could not constitute a seizure because their intent was to disperse the crowd,” \n5 \nnoting that “the Fourth Amendment regulates conduct rather than thoughts.”  685 F.3d at \n6 \n877.  The court concluded that “[r]egardless of their motives, [the officers’] application of \n7 \nforce was a knowing and willful act that terminated Nelson’s freedom of movement,” and \n8 \nthus, “[i]t unquestionably constituted a seizure under the Fourth Amendment.”  Id. at 877-\n9 \n78.   \n10 \nOverall, the court finds that the alleged facts of this case are governed by Nelson, \n11 \nand the Court’s decision in Torres does not change that conclusion.  Accordingly, the \n a  12  court concludes that each plaintiff has adequately alleged that they were seized for \nurtni\noor 13 \nCf Fourth Amendment purposes.  Defendants’ motion to dismiss is thus DENIED as to the \nt ali\ncC\nstriof  14  fourth cause of action.  The court also notes that, in the previously-cited district court \ns Dirict  15  cases arising out of the 2020 protests, each court found that the challenged conduct did \net\ns\natDi 16  constitute a Fourth Amendment seizure and proceeded to evaluate the merits of plaintiffs’ \nt\nS \nn\ned er 17  claims under the Graham v. Connor reasonableness standard.  See Anti Police-Terror \nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18 \nN Project v. City of Oakland, 477 F.Supp.3d at 1086 (citing Graham, 490 U.S. 386, 395 \n19 \n(1989)); Don’t Shoot Portland v. City of Portland, 465 F.Supp.3d at 1155 (same); Black \n20 \nLives Matter Seattle-King County v. City of Seattle, 466 F.Supp.3d at 1214 (same). \n21 \n5.  Fifth cause of action (wrongful arrest) \n22 \n  Plaintiffs’ fifth cause of action, for wrongful arrest, is asserted on behalf of plaintiffs \n23 \nCartwright, Lee, Naemeh, Swift, NAACP, and SJPJC, and is asserted against defendants \n24 \nDwyer, Garcia, Sykes, and the City of San Jose.     \n25 \n  “[A]n arrest without probable cause violates the Fourth Amendment and gives rise \n26 \nto a claim for damages under § 1983.”  Rosenbaum v. Washoe County, 663 F.3d 1071, \n27 \n1076 (9th Cir. 2011).  “An officer has probable cause to make a warrantless arrest when \n28 \nthe facts and circumstances within his knowledge are sufficient for a reasonably prudent \n23 \n\n \n1  person to believe that the suspect has committed a crime.”  Id.  Importantly, “[t]he \n2  analysis involves both fact and law.”  Id. \n3  Defendants argue that there was probable cause to arrest Cartwright and Lee for \n4  curfew violation.  Defendants further argue that they had probable cause to arrest Swift \n5  based on her alleged failure to move, and probable cause to arrest Naemeh because \n6  they believe he was throwing frozen water bottles, and “plaintiffs do not allege that frozen \n7  water bottles had not been thrown at officers from the crowd of which Naemeh was a \n8  part.”  Dkt. 27 at 12. \n9  In their opposition, plaintiffs first argue that the arrests were wrongful because they \n10  were made pursuant to an unconstitutional curfew order.  Plaintiffs then argue that, even \n11  if the curfew was legal, there was no probable cause to arrest Cartwright and Lee \n a  12  because Cartwright was a legal observer.  They similarly argue that there was no \nurtni\noor 13  probable cause to arrest Swift and Naemeh based on the allegations of the complaint, \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  and specifically point out that the frozen water bottle allegations regarding Naemeh \nDict  15  throwing frozen water bottles are directly contradicted by the complaint.    \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16    In reply, defendants urge the court to reject “plaintiffs’ self-serving \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  characterization” of their behavior.  They argue that the protests “had resulted in \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  widespread theft, arson, and property damage,” thereby giving the officers probable \nN\n19  cause to arrest Lee and Cartwright.  Defendants further argue that “these novel questions \n20  are close enough that the officers would be entitled to qualified immunity.”   \n21    As the Rosenbaum court observed, these false arrest claims require a mixed \n22  inquiry of fact and law that precludes dismissal at this stage of the case.  To determine \n23  whether each of the four arrests were constitutionally valid, the court will need to consider \n24  the circumstances of each of the four plaintiffs at the time they were arrested.  This \n25  consideration needs a developed factual record.   \n26    Defendants ask the court to discount the plaintiffs’ “self-serving characterization,” \n27  but that is not for the court to do at this stage.  The court takes the allegations as true.    \n28    As an example, the parties have raised an express factual dispute with respect to \n24 \n\n \n1  Naemeh and his arrest.  Defendants allege he was involved with throwing frozen water \n2  bottles, while plaintiffs allege he was not.  That dispute cannot be resolved at the \n3  pleading stage. \n4    Also, while defendants can argue that, even if the curfew order was \n5  unconstitutional, they still believed it was constitutional and therefore believed there was \n6  probable cause to arrest plaintiffs – and they may prevail on that argument, but it is a \n7  qualified immunity argument, and will be considered only after the court has an \n8  evidentiary record before it.   \n9    Accordingly, defendants’ motion to dismiss is DENIED as to the fifth cause of \n10  action.    \n11  6.  Sixth cause of action (equal protection) \n a  12  An equal protection claim for discriminatory enforcement requires plaintiffs to \nurtni\noor 13  plead that (1) officers’ enforcement efforts had a discriminatory effect on plaintiffs due to \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  their race or other protected status, and (2) the police were motivated by a discriminatory \nDict  15  purpose.  Rosenbaum v. City and County of San Francisco, 484 F.3d 1142, 1152 (9th \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  Cir. 2007).   \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  Defendants argue that there are no facts suggesting that officers targeted \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  protestors based on their ethnicity, or that similarly situated protestors outside that class \nN\n19  received better treatment. \n20  In their opposition, plaintiffs offer only a short response to this argument, arguing \n21  that “police officers targeted demonstrators seeking accountability for police violence \n22  against Black people supports the inference of the defendants’ discriminatory impact and \n23  purpose.”  Dkt. 32 at 26.  Plaintiffs then state that “[a]lternatively, plaintiffs’ First \n24  Amendment claim may provide analogous relief.”  Id.   \n25  As discussed above, while plaintiffs’ complaint does adequately allege that \n26  plaintiffs were targeted for their viewpoint, and while that viewpoint relates to the issue of \n27  ethnicity, the complaint does not adequately allege that plaintiffs were targeted for their \n28  own ethnicity.  Thus, while the court previously concluded that plaintiffs have adequately \n25 \n\n \n1  pled a First Amendment claim, it now concludes that plaintiffs have not adequately \n2  alleged an equal protection clam under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Defendants’ motion \n3  to dismiss the sixth cause of action is GRANTED.  Because this claim is substantively \n4  similar to plaintiffs’ third cause of action for viewpoint discrimination, and because \n5  plaintiffs’ opposition brief did not set forth reasons why this claim should proceed, and in \n6  fact acknowledged that the third cause of action may “provide analogous relief,” the \n7  dismissal of the sixth cause of action shall be with prejudice.   \n8  7.  Seventh cause of action (freedom of movement) \n9  Defendants argue that there is no standalone cause of action for violation of the \n10  “freedom of movement,” and instead, courts have found laws that unduly restrict \n11  movement to violate either the Due Process or Equal Protection clauses.   \n a  12  Plaintiffs argue that “citizens have a fundamental right of free movement” and that \nurtni\noor 13  the “curfew order was not narrowly tailored nor was it necessary to serve a compelling \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  state interest.”  The opposition contains only two paragraphs on this claim.  Dkt. 32 at 14.   \nDict  15  Defendants’ reply argues that plaintiffs have “effectively abandoned” this claim.   \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  Plaintiffs have not identified any authority for their argument that there is a \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  standalone cause of action for violation of the freedom of movement.  While plaintiffs cite  \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  Nunez by Nunez v. City of San Diego, that case recognized a “fundamental right of free \nN\n19  movement” only as part of an equal protection claim.  114 F.3d 935, 944 (9th Cir. 1997).   \n20  Moreover, this cause of action appears to challenge only the curfew order and \n21  related arrests, which are already challenged as part of the third and fifth causes of \n22  action.  Accordingly, because plaintiffs have not adequately shown a basis for a \n23  standalone cause of action for freedom of movement, and because this cause of action is \n24  effectively duplicative of the third and fifth causes of action in this case, the court \n25  GRANTS defendants’ motion to dismiss the seventh cause of action.  Because plaintiffs \n26  have not identified any authority for treating this claim as a standalone cause of action, \n27  the dismissal shall be with prejudice.     \n28   \n26 \n\n \n1  8.  Eighth cause of action (failure to intervene) \n2    “[P]olice officers have a duty to intercede when their fellow officers violate the \n3  constitutional rights of a suspect or other citizen.”  Cunningham v. Gates, 229 F.3d 1271, \n4  1289 (9th Cir. 2000).  “Importantly, however, officers can be held liable for failing to \n5  intercede only if they had an opportunity to intervene.”  Id.     \n6    Defendants’ primary argument is that “plaintiffs do not state a clearly established \n7  violation based on a failure to intervene,” thus entitling them to qualified immunity.  \n8  However, as stated above, the qualified immunity analysis is premature when such \n9  analysis depends on the underlying facts.  To determine whether defendants “had an \n10  opportunity to intervene,” the court first needs the factual record to be developed.  \n11  Accordingly, defendants’ motion to dismiss is DENIED as to the eighth cause of action.   \n a  12  9.  Ninth cause of action (conspiracy) \nurtni\noor 13  “To establish the defendants’ liability for a conspiracy, a plaintiff must demonstrate \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  the existence of an agreement or ‘meeting of the minds' to violate constitutional rights.”  \nDict  15  Mendocino Environmental Center v. Mendocino County, 192 F.3d 1283, 1301 (9th Cir. \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  1999).   \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  Defendants argue that plaintiffs must plead “the existence of an agreement or \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  meeting of the minds to violate constitutional rights” and must go beyond “vague and \nN\n19  conclusory conspiracy claims.”   \n20  The court agrees with defendants that plaintiffs’ conspiracy-related allegations are \n21  too vague and conclusory to meet the standards for pleading.  Plaintiffs make no attempt \n22  to make specific allegations as to what role each defendant played in any conspiracy.  \n23  Accordingly, defendants’ motion to dismiss the ninth cause of action is GRANTED.  The \n24  dismissal shall be without prejudice to reasserting this claim if plaintiffs learn facts \n25  through discovery that would show this claim to be viable.    \n26  10.  Tenth cause of action (ADA) and eleventh cause of action (Rehabilitation \nAct) \n27 \n  The Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits disability-based discrimination in the \n28 \n27 \n\n \n1  “services, programs, or activities of a public entity,” while the Rehabilitation Act prohibits \n2  disability-based discrimination in “any program or activity receiving federal financial \n3  assistance.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132; 29 U.S.C. § 794.  The Ninth Circuit has held that “[t]here \n4  is no significant difference in analysis of the rights and obligations created by the ADA \n5  and the Rehabilitation Act.”  Zukle v. Regents of University of California, 166 F.3d 1041, \n6  1045, n.11 (9th Cir. 1999).   \n7    The complaint did not specify which plaintiffs assert these two claims, and also \n8  appears to assert the claims against all defendants.  See Dkt. 3, ¶¶ 280-308.  However, \n9  plaintiffs’ claim chart states that the ADA and RA claims are asserted only by plaintiff \n10  Cartwright, and against only the City of San Jose.  Dkt. 37 at 6.   \n11    The Ninth Circuit has held that the ADA applies to police officers making arrests.  \n a  12  Sheehan v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 743 F.3d 1211, 1232 (9th Cir. 2014).  \nurtni\noor 13  Specifically, “where, although police properly investigate and arrest a person with a \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  disability for a crime unrelated to that disability, they fail to reasonably accommodate the \nDict  15  person's disability in the course of investigation or arrest, causing the person to suffer \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  greater injury or indignity in that process than other arrestees,” such failure to reasonably \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  accommodate violates the ADA.  Id.  Whether an accommodation is reasonable is \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  ordinarily a question of fact.  Id. at 1233.   \nN\n19    Defendants argue that the Ninth Circuit has only ever applied the ADA to preclude \n20  the use of deadly force on disabled suspects when non-deadly force was feasible, but \n21  there is nothing in the Sheehan opinion that so limits its holding. \n22    The complaint alleges that Cartwright has a brain injury as well as injuries to both \n23  of her knees, and alleges, in part, that she was “physically unable to run” away from \n24  officers shooting impact munitions because of her disability.  Dkt. 3, ¶¶ 20, 102.  While \n25  defendants challenge the reasonableness of any possible accommodations, that inquiry \n26  is a question of fact and cannot be resolved at the pleading stage.  Accordingly, \n27  defendants’ motion to dismiss is DENIED as to the tenth and eleventh causes of action.  \n28  However, as stated above, only these claims as asserted by plaintiff Cartwright against \n28 \n\n \n1  the City of San Jose remain in the case.   \n2  11.  Remaining state law causes of action \n3  Defendants’ motion does not present separate arguments on the state law claims, \n4  instead taking the position that “plaintiffs’ state-law claims rely on the same allegations \n5  and theories of liability as in their federal claims under § 1983 and fail for the same \n6  reasons.”  Dkt. 27 at 25.   \n7  As to the twelfth cause of action (Bane Act), defendants argue that it is \n8  “coextensive” with an excessive force claim except that the Bane Act also requires a \n9  showing of specific intent, but defendants do not challenge that additional requirement in \n10  their motion.  Because the court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss as to the federal \n11  excessive force claim, the court also DENIES defendants’ motion to dismiss as to the \n a  12  twelfth cause of action under the Bane Act. \nurtni\noor 13  As to the thirteenth cause of action (Ralph Act), defendants argue it is the same as \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  a viewpoint-discrimination claim.  Because the court denied defendants’ motion to \nDict  15  dismiss as to the federal First Amendment viewpoint-discrimination claim, the court also \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  DENIES defendants’ motion to dismiss as to the thirteenth cause of action under the \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  Ralph Act. \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  As to the fourteenth cause of action for assault and battery, defendants argue it is \nN\n19  the same as an excessive force claim.  Because the court denied defendants’ motion to \n20  dismiss as to the federal excessive force claim, the court also DENIES defendants’ \n21  motion to dismiss as to the fourteenth cause of action. \n22  As to the fifteenth cause of action for false arrest, defendants argue it is the same \n23  as the federal wrongful arrest claim.  Because the court denied defendants’ motion to \n24  dismiss as to the federal wrongful arrest claim, the court also DENIES defendants’ motion \n25  to dismiss as to the fifteenth cause of action. \n26  And as to the sixteenth cause of action for negligence, defendants argue it is the \n27  same as the Fourth Amendment claim.  Because the court denied defendants’ motion to \n28  dismiss as to the federal Fourth Amendment claims for excessive force and wrongful \n29 \n\n \n1  arrest, the court also DENIES defendants’ motion to dismiss as to the sixteenth cause of \n2  action. \n3  Defendants then invoke the state-law “discretionary act immunity.”  However, as \n4  with the federal qualified immunity analysis, this analysis is better suited for summary \n5  judgment when the factual record will have been developed.  See, e.g., Conway v. City of \n6  Tuolumne, 231 Cal.App.4th 1005 (2014) (considering discretionary act immunity on a \n7  motion for summary judgment).   \n8  CONCLUSION \n9    For the foregoing reasons, defendants’ motion to dismiss is GRANTED in part and \n10  DENIED in part.  The court summarizes its rulings, and the claims remaining in the case, \n11  as follows: \n a  12    Defendants’ motion to dismiss the third cause of action for violation of the First \nurtni\noor 13  Amendment is DENIED as to the viewpoint-discrimination claim, and DENIED as to \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  the curfew-related claim as to defendants Sykes, Liccardo, Garcia, and the City of \nDict  15  San Jose, but GRANTED without leave to amend as to the curfew-related claims as \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  to all other defendants; \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17    Defendants’ motion to dismiss the fourth cause of action for excessive force is \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  DENIED;  \nN\n19    Defendants’ motion to dismiss the fifth cause of action for wrongful arrest is DENIED; \n20    Defendants’ motion to dismiss the sixth cause of action for violation of equal \n21  protection is GRANTED without leave to amend; \n22    Defendants’ motion to dismiss the seventh cause of action for violation of the freedom \n23  of movement is GRANTED without leave to amend; \n24    Defendants’ motion to dismiss the eighth cause of action for failure to intervene is \n25  DENIED; \n26    Defendants’ motion to dismiss the ninth cause of action for conspiracy is GRANTED \n27  without prejudice to reasserting this claim with more facts should discovery reveal that \n28  it is viable; \n30 \n\n \n1    Defendants’ motion to dismiss the tenth and eleventh causes of action for violations of \n2  the ADA and RA is DENIED; \n3    Defendants’ motion to dismiss the twelfth cause of action for violation of the Bane Act \n4  is DENIED; \n5    Defendants’ motion to dismiss the thirteenth cause of action for violation of the Ralph \n6  Act is DENIED; \n7    Defendants’ motion to dismiss the fourteenth cause of action for assault and battery is \n8  DENIED; \n9    Defendants’ motion to dismiss the fifteenth cause of action for false arrest is DENIED; \n10  and \n11    Defendants’ motion to dismiss the sixteenth cause of action for negligence is \n a  12  DENIED. \nurtni\noor 13  That leaves the following claims remaining in the case: \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14    First cause of action for injunctive relief and second cause of action for declaratory \nDict  15  relief, which are types of remedies and were not at issue on this motion; \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16    Third cause of action for First Amendment violation: \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  -  Viewpoint discrimination claim, asserted by all plaintiffs against all defendants; \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  -  Curfew-related claim, asserted by all plaintiffs against defendants Sykes, \nN\n19  Liccardo, Garcia, and City of San Jose; \n20    Fourth cause of action for excessive force, asserted by all plaintiffs against all \n21  defendants; \n22    Fifth cause of action for wrongful arrest, asserted by plaintiffs Cartwright, Lee, \n23  Naemeh, Swift, NAACP, and SJPJC, against defendants Dwyer, Garcia, Sykes, and \n24  City of San Jose; \n25    Eighth cause of action for failure to intervene, asserted by all plaintiffs against \n26  defendants Dwyer, Garcia, Sykes, Yuen, Curry, and Delgado; \n27    Tenth cause of action for violation of the ADA, asserted by plaintiff Cartwright against \n28  defendant City of San Jose; \n31 \n\n \n1    Eleventh cause of action for violation of the RA, asserted by plaintiff Cartwright \n2  against defendant City of San Jose; \n3    Twelfth cause of action for violation of the Bane Act, asserted by all plaintiffs against \n4  all defendants; \n5    Thirteenth cause of action for violation of the Ralph Act, asserted by all plaintiffs \n6  against all defendants; \n7    Fourteenth cause of action for assault and battery, asserted by all plaintiffs against all \n8  defendants; \n9    Fifteenth cause of action for false arrest, asserted by plaintiffs Cartwright, Lee, \n10  Naemeh, Swift, NAACP, and SJPJC, against defendants Dwyer, Garcia, Sykes, and \n11  City of San Jose;  \n a  12    Sixteenth cause of action for negligence, asserted by all plaintiffs against all \nurtni\noor 13  defendants. \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  The court reschedules the case management conference for October 21, 2021 at \nDict  15  2:00pm.   \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16    IT IS SO ORDERED. \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  Dated:  September 24, 2021 \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18     /s/ Phyllis J.

To prove excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment, a plaintiff must show that an \n3 \nofficer intentionally used force against her with the objective purpose to restrain, and that the \n4 \nforce was unreasonable.  Are Defendants entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiffs’ \n5 \nexcessive force claims here where: (a) most Plaintiffs were struck by police, if at all, by \n6 \naccident; (b) the circumstances of officers’ force in all but one case objectively manifested a \n7  purpose to disperse or repel rather than restrain; and (c) in the one case involving a purposeful \n8  detention, the officer believed the plaintiff had dangerous objects and pushed him to effect an \narrest after the plaintiff tried to run away? \n9 \n10 \n2.  The central element of a First Amendment retaliation claim is speech-based animus by the \n11  defendant.  Here, no Defendant said anything to express adversity or hostility to Plaintiffs’ \nspeech activity, and Plaintiffs have identified no other evidence of retaliatory animus.  Are \n12 \nDefendants entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiffs’ First Amendment retaliation \n13 \nclaims? \n14 \n15  3.  To hold a supervisory official liable for the constitutional violations of a subordinate, a plaintiff \nmust at a minimum prove that the supervisor caused the violations through deliberate \n16 \nindifference, meaning that the supervisor knew his conduct would result in a subordinate \n17 \nviolating the Constitution yet consciously chose to allow that violation.  Here, Plaintiffs have no \n18 \nevidence that any supervisory official ordered, authorized, or consciously allowed a subordinate \n19 \nto violate any Plaintiff’s constitutional rights.  Are the supervisory officials entitled to judgment \n20 \nas a matter of law on Plaintiff’s constitutional claims?  \n21 \n4.  Qualified immunity prohibits liability for police officers unless controlling authority or a robust \n22 \nconsensus of persuasive authority put them on notice that their particular conduct violated the \n23 \nConstitution.  Here, Plaintiffs can point to no case in which a police officer was held to have \n24 \nviolated the Constitution under circumstances resembling those faced by Defendants: i.e., a \n25  violent unlawful assembly in which officers are required to disperse the crowd and restore order \nwith force.  Nor have Plaintiffs pointed to any case holding a supervisory official liable in such \n26 \na context.  Can Plaintiffs overcome the protections of qualified immunity to hold Defendants \n27 \nliable? \n28 \n \nDEFENDANTS’ NOTICE OF MOTION   21-cv-01705-PJH \nAND MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 3 of 61\n \n5.  A city cannot be held liable for the constitutional violations of its employees unless an official \n1 \npolicy, endorsed by its highest policymaking officials, caused the violations.  Here, the City had \n2 \nexplicit policies that prohibited excessive force and unlawful retaliation and required all officers \n3 \nto be trained specifically in the weapons they used during the unlawful assembly.  There is also \n4 \nno evidence that San Jose officers had engaged in excessive force or unlawful retaliation at any \n5 \npast expressive event.  Is the City of San Jose entitled to judgment as a matter of law on \n6  Plaintiffs’ municipal liability claim?  \n7 \n6.  For a failure-to-accommodate claim, the Americans with Disabilities and Rehabilitation Acts \n8 \nrequire a plaintiff affirmatively to prove that a reasonable accommodation existed, was known \n9 \nto the city defendant, and was denied.  Here, a police officer pushed Plaintiff Cartwright away \n10  three times after she disobeyed his order to get back from a moving police line.  Cartwright said \n11  that she had an unspecified brain injury in between one of these pushes, but she did not tell the \nofficer she had a disability or suggest any accommodation he should provide.  Is the City \n12 \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law on Cartwright’s federal disability claims? \n13 \n14  7.  Plaintiffs predicate their state-law claims on the same allegations and theories as their federal \nconstitutional claims.  Are Defendants entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the state-law \n15 \nclaims as a result, and if not, do the immunities in California law for police tactical decisions \n16 \nduring an unlawful riot independently preclude liability on those claims? \n17 \n \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \nDEFENDANTS’ NOTICE OF MOTION   21-cv-01705-PJH \nAND MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 4 of 61\n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n1 \n2 \nIntroduction ............................................................................................................................................... 1 \n3 \nFactual Background .................................................................................................................................. 2 \n4 \nI.

Protesters took over streets and highways, assaulted civilians and police officers, and \n4  destroyed public and private property.  In the attempt to restore order, San Jose police declared an \n5  unlawful assembly and ordered protesters to disperse.  Few heeded that order.  On the contrary, \n6  protesters responded by screaming at and escalating their assaults on police officers, including by \n7  knocking one police officer unconscious.  Police responded by using force, both to disperse and move \n8  the crowd and also to target those who were actively assaulting officers by throwing objects.  \n9  Ultimately, the City had to declare a state of emergency given the rampant lawlessness it faced.  \n10    The Plaintiffs in this case were all present amid this violent and unlawful assembly.  Each had \n11  been ordered to disperse multiple times yet chose to remain downtown.  And each now claims one or \n12  more of the 22 named Defendants used or caused force against him or her in violation of the First and \n13  Fourth Amendment (and state law).  Plaintiffs’ claims cannot survive summary judgment.  \n14    Plaintiffs’ excessive force claims against the various Defendants are scattershot and consist \n15  largely of guesswork.  Plaintiffs do not know what police officer, if any, was responsible for the \n16  violations they assert, so they name multiple officers in multiple claims as part of an undifferentiated \n17  monolith.  Yet the undisputed facts are that most Plaintiffs were struck by a police projectile, if at all, \n18  by an unknown officer, and even then only by accident.  It follows that these Plaintiffs cannot prove \n19  any Defendant intentionally used force against him or her, much less that any officer did so with the \n20  objective purpose to restrain (rather than to disperse or repel).  As to the Plaintiffs who have identified \n21  officers who intentionally used force, that force was a reasonable response to the officers’ reasonable \n22  perception that the Plaintiffs had engaged in obstructive or assaultive conduct.  Because no Plaintiff can \n23  prove both a seizure and unreasonableness, Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claims necessarily fail.   \n24    The record precludes Plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim for the simple reason that they have no \n25  evidence to suggest any Defendant secretly harbored retaliatory animus against them.  Defendants \n26  faced hundreds of protesters over the course of the protest.  There is no basis for the inference that, of \n27  all these individuals engaging in the same protest activity, Defendants targeted Plaintiffs in particular to \n28  punish them for their speech.  Plaintiffs therefore cannot prove unlawful retaliation.  \n1 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 12 of 61\n \n1    Plaintiffs’ claim against the City of San Jose likewise fails.  City policy before May 2020 was \n2  explicit and extensive in prohibiting excessive force and viewpoint discrimination.  Training and policy \n3  in the City also delineated with particularity the circumstances under which force—including projectile \n4  weapons—could be used safely and effectively, in the crowd-control context or any other.  Indeed, it is \n5  precisely because the City’s policies and training so effectively prevented misconduct during public \n6  demonstrations that Plaintiffs have not adduced evidence of a single instance in which a San Jose \n7  police officer has every violated a protester’s rights through excessive force or unlawful retaliation.  \n8  Plaintiffs’ municipal liability claim is meritless.  \n9    The standalone claims of one Plaintiff (Cartwright) under federal disability law based on a \n10  purported failure to accommodate must also be dismissed.  Plaintiffs have pointed to no possible \n11  accommodation Cartwright was denied at the protest, and indeed Cartwright herself has admitted she \n12  neither requested nor was denied accommodation there.  Under no proper conception of applicable \n13  federal law did the City violate Cartwright’s rights through a failure to accommodate.  \n14    Finally, Plaintiffs’ state-law claims rely on the same theories and allegations as their federal \n15  constitutional claims, so they fail for the same reason.  They fail for the additional reason that state-law \n16  immunities preclude liability for tactical decision during a riot of the type Defendants face here.  \n17    All Defendants are entitled to judgment as a law.  They request an order so holding.  \n18  Factual Background \n19  I.  San Jose Police Department policies on crowd control and the use of force \n20  The San Jose Police Department’s (“SJPD”) policies and training before May 29, 2020 \n21  regarding the use of projectile impact weapons (“PIW”) and other force during crowd-control events \n22  were robust and specific.  The policies were codified in the 2020 SJPD Duty Manual (“DM”), which all \n23  police officers were required to know.  Tassio Dec., ¶ 1. The DM defined objectively reasonable force \n24  and prohibited police officers from using excessive force, whether in a crowd-control situation or any \n25  other.  Id. ¶ 5.   The DM also contained specific provisions regarding protests, riots, and other crowd-\n26  control scenarios.  Id. ¶¶ 2-3.  The DM further cautioned police officers that protests and \n27  demonstrations are emotional events that require calmness and objectivity, and it explicitly mandated \n28  “equal treatment” of any “demonstrators” whom officers encounter.  Id. ¶ 2.  Officers were instructed \n2 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 13 of 61\n \n1  not to interfere with any person, whether formal media or just a member of the public, who wished to \n2  take video or photographs in normally accessible areas.  Id. ¶ 3.   \n3  Also included in the DM was an outline of the tools commonly available to assist law \n4  enforcement in the singular and difficult task of controlling violent crowds.  These tools, which are \n5  used by police officers across the country, include: batons, often as part of the effort to move groups of \n6  people with a police line; oleoresin capsicum (OC) cannisters; teargas cannisters; and PIW.  The PIW \n7  available to SJPD officers and outlined in the DM were the 37mm projectile launcher (“37mm”); \n8  40mm launchers (shooting foam baton rounds (“40mm”) and OC rounds); and a beanbag shotgun.  Id. \n9  ¶ 6 & Ex. 2; Pritchard Dec., Ex. 3, 81:19-25.  Each of these tools is different, and the DM instructed \n10  police officers about when it was appropriate or inappropriate to use them.  Id. \n11  The 37mm is used as an indirect crowd-control device.  Id. Ex. 1 82:11-89:9.  It functions by \n12  allowing a police officer to fire a round against the ground in front of a group of people, which impact \n13  causes the round to disperse five small foam discs outward.  Id. Ex. 2, 55:1-22, 65:24-66:4.  Each of the \n14  discs is slightly larger than a quarter.  See id.  The 37mm is designed not to cause serious injury; its \n15  purpose is more to startle and disorient a crowd than to inflict force—when the 37mm is fired, it emits \n16  a loud noise and smoke.  Id. Ex. 1 105:9-25.  The action of skipping the projectile off the ground before \n17  the discs disperse causes most of the forceful energy of the discs to dissipate, meaning that the force of \n18  any impact on a person is significantly minimized.  Id. 82:11-89:9.  All officers trained to use 37mm \n19  launchers are themselves subjected to its force, meaning that they are personally fired upon and \n20  experience the resulting impact.  Tassio Dec., ¶ 15. \n21  The DM specifies that the 37mm may be used for crowd-control only by special operations \n22  officers specifically trained on that device, and such officers may deploy it only after (1) an unlawful \n23  assembly and dispersal order has been given; (2) a commanding officer has authorized deployment and \n24  use of the 37mm; and (3) the 37mm is fired at a sufficient distance from the crowd to ensure the energy \n25  of the projectile will have sufficiently dissipated to prevent substantial injury.  Tassio Dec., Ex. 2.  \n26  The 40mm (along with the beanbag shotgun), by contrast, is intended to be used not for general \n27  crowd control but to target specific individuals.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 1 at 95:10-20.  The 40mm is used \n28  by firing one foam baton directly at a subject.  Id.  The DM provides that officers may not use the \n3 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 14 of 61\n \n1  40mm unless they have completed an approved training course on it, and it prohibits its use except to \n2  prevent serious injury.  Tassio Dec., Ex. 2.  The 40mm OC rounds have the same caliber as the 40mm \n3  foam baton rounds, but they contain OC powder, the same chemical agent in pepper spray.  Pritchard \n4  Dec., Ex. 3 305:21-306:5.  The 40mm OC rounds can be used as a direct impact weapon, in which case \n5  they are subject to the same rules and restraints as the 40mm foam batons, but OC rounds are also used \n6  indirectly for crowd dispersal purposes.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 1 114: 2-114:18.  Such indirect use \n7  involves the officer firing an OC round against a hard surface near or above an unlawful assembly of \n8  people, and the impact of the projectile causes OC powder to release in the area of the crowd.  Id.  \n9  Teargas is contained in cannisters.  To use it, police officers throw the cannister in the direction \n10  of an unlawful assembly, after which it releases a smoky gas.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 4 112:7-19.  The gas \n11  acts as an irritant on the surrounding crowd and is designed to induce its members to leave the area.  \n12  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 5 78:5-7, 83:6-83:23. \n13  II.  San Jose Police Department training on crowd control and the use of force \n14  All law enforcement agencies in California must by law comply with the state’s Peace Officer \n15  Standards and Training, or “POST,” requirements.  E.g., Cal. Code Regs. tit. 11, § 1005.  Any person \n16  in the state who wishes to become a police officer must be POST certified.  Id. § 1950.  Certification \n17  entails a rigorous course of training, particularly on issues related to the use of force.  See Sciba Dec. \n18  ¶¶ 4-8.  Further, to maintain POST certification after it has been granted, officers must successfully \n19  complete continuing professionally training requirements every two years.  Id. ¶ 4. \n20  The SJPD’s training program and requirements before May 2020 exceeded those prescribed by \n21  POST.  Id. ¶ 6.  All officers with SJPD were required to complete a 26-week Police Academy, which \n22  entails approximately 976 hours of training.  Id. Officers were taught about the definition and real-\n23  world meaning of objectively reasonable force, including the force appropriate in response to different \n24  levels of resistance.  Id. ¶ 7. Officers were taught the proper way to use different force techniques, from \n25  the use of hands and control holds, batons, non-lethal weapons, and firearms.  Id. ¶ 6.  In addition to \n26  POST certification, SJPD officers were required to complete a four-hour course devoted specifically to \n27  the use of PIW.  Id. ¶ 9. This special course taught officers how to use PIW properly, under what \n28  circumstances they are appropriate, and how best to minimize serious injury.  Id.  Officers were taught \n4 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 15 of 61\n \n1  about the areas on a person’s body they may and may not target, including that PIW should never be \n2  fired at a person’s head, groin, or other areas that can cause serious injury except where necessary to \n3  prevent death or serious bodily injury.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 6 at 143:23-144:10, 151:19-153:9.    \n4  Beyond what officers learned in the Academy, POST and SJPD required them to complete \n5  ongoing training.  Sciba Dec., ¶¶ 4, 10.  This training included many of the same topics on the use of \n6  force and other issues, including as part of a “defensive tactics update” every two years.  Id. ¶ 10.  The \n7  defensive tactics update covers the use of PIW, and officers were again taught to avoid the head or \n8  groin area with PIW devices.  Id. ¶ 12.  In addition, SJPD supplemented these trainings in 2018 by \n9  providing all police officers with a training video on the use of 40mm PIW.  Id. ¶ 11.  The video \n10  discussed the effective range of 40mm projectiles, cautioned about the areas (the head, neck, spine, and \n11  groin) that should not be targeted, and warned of the risks 40mm PIW can pose.  Id.  The video also \n12  directed officers to the DM provisions governing PIW use.  Id.  \n13  Police officers with SJPD were also trained on crowd control and demonstrations before May \n14  2020.  Officers were taught at the Academy that they have a responsibility to protect every individual’s \n15  right to free speech and assembly, regardless of the officers’ own personal opinions or views.  Tassio \n16  Dec., ¶ 9.  The Academy also taught officers about legal observers and members of the media at \n17  protests, making clear that all such individuals have a constitutional right to be present and document \n18  events.  Id.   Officers training also covered dispersal orders, what constitutes an unlawful assembly, and \n19  Ninth Circuit case law governing these concepts.  Id. ¶ 10.   The SJPD’s crowd-control training \n20  involved both instruction and simulation exercises.  Id.  Officers learned about the difference between \n21  passive and active resisters in crowd situations, and the appropriate force that may be used with each.  \n22  Id.  Officers also participated in simulations where they were required to apply their knowledge.  Id. \n23  In addition to this basic training, and beyond POST requirements, SJPD mandated significant \n24  training to the groups of officers who will most frequently be involved in crowd-control scenarios, i.e., \n25  those in the Special Operations Unit.  Id. ¶ 12.  Specifically, Special Operations officers had to \n26  complete a six to eight-hour crowd-control training at least once a year.  Id.  This special training \n27  covered how to control a crowd effectively and safely, including arrest techniques, control tactics, \n28  updates on the First Amendment and case law surrounding the use of force, the role of legal observers \n5 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 16 of 61\n \n1  in crowds, and the proper use of PIW.  Id.  Before May 2020, the most recent of these required annual \n2  crowd-control trainings took place April 29, 2020 and May 23, 2019.  Id.  \n3  Every officer-defendant here was POST certified and up-to-date in training requirements during \n4  the period of May 29, 2020 to May 30, 2020.  Sciba Dec., ¶¶ 14-27; Moran Dec., ¶ 3.   Every officer-\n5  defendant who used a PIW was specifically trained on that device.  Id. ¶¶ 17, 19-22, 24, 27; Moran \n6  Dec., ¶ 4.  And every officer-defendant who was in Special Operations had received the extra training \n7  on crowd-control.  Tassio Dec., ¶¶ 17-23. \n8  III.  Violent and disruptive protest activity beginning on May 29, 2020 \n9    Following the May 25, 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minnesota police officers, \n10  there were demonstrations across the country.  Many of these demonstrations became violent and \n11  involved widespread looting and destruction of property.  Commanding officers with SJPD were aware \n12  of some of these events, but based on prior experiences in San Jose, they did not expect the same levels \n13  of violence or disorder to accompany any San Jose protest.  Dwyer Dec., Ex. 1; Pritchard Dec., Ex. 3 at \n14  42:14-43:14, 219:23-220:23; id. Ex. 4 at 14:5-16:5, 59:15-60:2.  Nevertheless, at 10:51 p.m. on May \n15  28, 2020, Deputy Chief of Police David Tindall sent an email directing police officials to develop a \n16  plan to prepare for protest activity in San Jose.  Dwyer Dec., Ex. 1.  The officials acted quickly to do \n17  so, creating an Incident Action Plan that was provided to commanding officers on May 29.  Dwyer \n18  Dec., Ex. 2.  The plan was intended “to ensure the safety of persons and property around the event.”  \n19  Id. (SJ350063).  The plan further made clear that “[c]rowd management and protecting [F]irst \n20  [A]mendment rights of all involved is of the utmost importance.”  Id.   \n21    Because SJPD’s commanders did not anticipate significant violence or unrest, their original \n22  Incident Action Plan did not call for the mass deployment of all SJPD police officers.  Rather, the Plan \n23  called only for select Special Operations units, aided by “Mobile Field Force Teams” consisting of \n24  officers trained in crowd-control, to be prepared to respond as needed in the event of particular civil \n25  disturbances or unrest.  Id. (SJ350067-SJ350069).  But things changed as the day unfolded.  \n26    In the early afternoon of May 29, a protest crowd gathered near San Jose City Hall.  Pritchard \n27  Dec., Ex. 4 92:5-7.  Shortly after that, demonstrators began to take over streets near City Hall, blocking \n28  traffic and creating disorder.  Id. Ex. 3 57:16-58:7.  Despite these violations of law, SJPD did not yet \n6 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 17 of 61\n \n1  deploy police officers to the location of the protesters for direct crowd control.  Id. Ex. 4 44:1-5, 49:17-\n2  24.  It was SJPD’s goal to remain out of sight in the hope that the crowd’s lawlessness would remain \n3  relatively limited.  Id. Ex. 3 43:4-44:8.  But at around 3:00 p.m., the large crowd of demonstrators \n4  walked onto Highway 101 amid moving traffic, creating a significant safety hazard and an incalculably \n5  large backlog of stranded motorists.  Id. Ex. 4 49:8-12, 63:3-64:24, 102:23-103:14; Neumer Dec., Ex. 1 \n6  (SJ002808).  Members of the crowd jumped on motorists’ vehicles, smashed their windows, and \n7  vandalized their cars.  Id. (SJ002810, SJ002834, SJ002839); https://www.ktvu.com/video/689432; In \n8  re Facebook, Inc. Sec. Litig., 405 F. Supp. 3d 809, 828 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (holding judicial notice of \n9  “publicly available news articles” is appropriate). \n10    California Highway Patrol deployed to respond to the violent crowd, intending to remove it \n11  from the highway, and requested aid from SJPD.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 3 43:12-19.  A group of SJPD \n12  officers were deployed to the area to assist. Id. The officers who arrived were subjected to immediate \n13  assaults. Neumer Dec., Ex. 1 (SJ002839-40).  Members of the crowd threw rocks, bottles, bricks, \n14  asphalt, and other objects at them.  Dwyer Dec., ¶ 6.  The window of at least one police vehicle was \n15  smashed out, and protesters spray painted others.  Neumer Dec., Ex. 1 (SJ002840-41). \n16  Finally, at 4:31 p.m., SJPD declared the violent crowd an unlawful assembly and ordered it to \n17  disperse.  Id. (SJ002842).  All such orders were largely ignored.  Police officers formed a line near \n18  Santa Clara and Eighth and Ninth Streets and continued to broadcast the unlawful assembly and \n19  dispersal order over a long-range acoustic device.  Id. (SJ002848). The purpose of this police line was \n20  to prevent the unlawful assembly from going back in the direction of the highway and to move it in a \n21  controlled way back toward City Hall, where many of the protesters had likely parked their vehicles, in \n22  the hope that participants would leave of their own accord.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 1 199:7-200:2.  Almost \n23  immediately after officers formed their line, however, the crowd of protesters rushed up to it, shouting \n24  and throwing bottles, rocks, and other objects.  Id. 176:7-177:6.  Officers repeated the unlawful \n25  assembly announcement to no avail.   \n26  At around 5:00 p.m., the Special Operations Division Commander, Captain Jason Dwyer, \n27  arrived at the scene.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 3 129:7-17.  Captain Dwyer witnessed a shocking level of \n28  violence and aggression from the moment he arrived.  After being there for just a short period, Captain \n7 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 18 of 61\n \n1  Dwyer was struck by a piece of asphalt that some member of the crowd threw over the police line to \n2  where Captain Dwyer was standing.  Id. 31:2-32:9.  He also observed many rocks and other objects \n3  raining down on other police officers in the area.  Id. 60:22-61:12, 83:21-84:2.  Captain Dwyer \n4  informed other commanding officers what he was seeing.  Id. 166:5-12.  Around that same time, a \n5  protester punched an officer in the police line in the face and knocked him unconscious.  Id. 57:15-\n6  59:16, 85:12-85:20, 166:5-12. \n7  In fear for the safety of police officers, Captain Dwyer authorized the trained Special \n8  Operations officers equipped with the 37mm to use those devices in an effort to back the hostile crowd \n9  away from the line of officers and cause them to disperse.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 3 82:17-84:20.  The \n10  37mm deployments temporarily caused the crowd to back away, but most in the crowd did not disperse \n11  and continued to approach the police line aggressively and throw objects at officers.  Id. 83:5-84:20.  \n12  Upon learning of the violent and assaultive actions of the unlawful assembly, Assistant Chief David \n13  Knopf authorized the use of teargas as necessary to effect dispersal.  Id. 100:11-101:3; id. Ex. 7 56:18-\n14  57:10.  Police officers used the teargas, but the unlawful assembly still did not disperse.  Id. Ex. 5 \n15  83:25-84:12.  The SJPD also took the extraordinary step of calling for a “Code 30,” which is a request \n16  for help to all law enforcement agencies in the area.  Id. Ex. 7 36:10-36:24-38:12-38:20.  The Code 30 \n17  also directs the deployment of as many SJPD officers as possible.  Id. Ex. 3 201:5-202:1.  Numerous \n18  agencies responded to the Code 30, including over a hundred officers from the Santa Clara County \n19  Sheriff’s Office and the Santa Clara Police Department.  Id. 67:13-67:24.  These officers were, like \n20  SJPD, equipped with PIW.  Id. 304:8-23. \n21    The police line that formed between Eighth and Ninth Streets and Santa Clara subsequently \n22  moved west down Santa Clara toward City Hall, repeating the unlawful assembly and dispersal order \n23  all the while.  Id. Ex. 1 172:17-172:25, 176:7-176:16; id. Ex. 3 129:7-129:17.  Protesters continued to \n24  assault police officers by throwing bottles, rocks, mortars, hammers, and other debris.  Pritchard Dec., \n25  Ex. 3 158-12-19; Neumer Dec., Ex. 3, 18:00:55-18:01:05.  Members of the protest also started fires, \n26  including of dumpsters, and furniture.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 3 97:5-22; Dwyer Dec., ¶ 7; Pritchard Dec., \n27  Ex. 5 141:11-142:3.  A UPS truck was looted and a fire was set next to it.  Neumer Dec., Ex. 1 \n28  (SJ002881); Pritchard Dec., Ex. 5 141-11-25.  And a police motorcycle was struck by a protester with a \n8 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 19 of 61\n \n1  claw hammer.  Neumer Dec., Ex. 1 (SJ002860). Some of the officers that were part of the police line \n2  were equipped with 40mm PIW.  Pursuant to SJPD policy and training, these officers were only to use \n3  their 40mm only to prevent serious injury.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 3 121:8-122:5; id. Ex. 1 74:7-75:4.  In \n4  the context of the protest, that meant using the device largely to target individuals who the officers \n5  observed throwing objects at or in the direction of the police line.  Id. Ex. 1 95:10-20, 98:1-99:15.   \n6    The unlawful assembly continued into the late evening on May 29.  The police line continued to \n7  move the crowd, including by directing parts of it west and south once the line got to City Hall, still \n8  with the objective of causing its members to disperse.  Id. Ex. 3 at 136:9-136:19.  Contingents of the \n9  unlawful assembly moved to different areas, including a larger group that took over Plaza de Cesar \n10  Chavez Park near City Hall and set a number of trash cans there on fire.  Id.  Ex. 5 156:5-156:17.  \n11  Officers arrested some of the more violent members of the crowd when possible, though such arrests \n12  were tactically very challenging given limited police manpower and resources.  Id. Ex. 3 at 63:12-65:1.  \n13  Late in the evening, after many hours of these efforts, most unlawful assembly members finally \n14  dissipated, leaving an aftermath of fires, graffiti, and property damage. Dwyer Dec., Ex. 3. \n15  IV.  Protest activity and violence continue on May 30, and the City declares an emergency \n16    The following day likewise saw significant protest activity accompanied by violence and \n17  assaults from the crowd.  This time, SJPD attempted to forestall some of the significant issues that had \n18  arisen the day before by placing police lines in the area of City Hall.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 3 144:4-\n19  145:15.  Once again, protesters moved toward the police lines, and several began throwing objects at \n20  police.  Some were handing out frozen water bottles to be launched at police.  Neumer Decl. Ex. 1 \n21  (SJ025732).  At least one protester used a potato gun to launch objects at police.  Id. (SJ025743).  \n22  Officers attempted to prevent further such assaultive conduct by targeting the responsible individuals \n23  with 40mm, but they did not use any force against anyone in the crowd otherwise.  At around 7:00 \n24  p.m., protesters lit a nearby dumpster on fire.  Id. (SJ025730).  \n25    At 7:17 p.m., SJPD declared an unlawful assembly and ordered the crowd to disperse.  Neumer \n26  Dec., Ex. 19, 19:17:36-19:17:51.  The crowd responded by throwing more objects at officers.  Officers \n27  received information that a person in a paintball mask was carrying frozen water bottles to pass out.  \n28  Neumer Dec., Ex. 1 (SJ025732).  Officers continued to experience assaults throughout the night.  It \n9 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 20 of 61\n \n1  took until 1:00 a.m. the following morning for SJPD to clear the downtown core.  Id. (SJ025761; \n2  SJ025765).  On May 31, the City of San Jose declared a state of emergency based on the widespread \n3  violence, looting, property damage, and destruction that accompanied the protests.  Dwyer Dec., Ex. 4. \n4  Argument \n5  Summary judgment is appropriate where there is “no genuine dispute as to any material fact and \n6  the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  The moving party bears \n7  the burden to show there is no genuine factual dispute.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24 \n8  (1986).  Defendants need only highlight the absence of evidence supporting Plaintiffs’ claims to obtain \n9  summary judgment.  Devereaux v. Abbey, 263 F.3d 1070, 1076 (9th Cir. 2001).  Plaintiffs must then \n10  identify admissible evidence establishing a material issue for trial.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), (e).  \n11  The operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) asserts nine substantive claims by 13 \n12  plaintiffs against 23 different defendants: Claims 3, 4, and 5 assert liability against all Defendants by all \n13  Plaintiffs under 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Claims 7 and 8 assert liability under federal disability laws on behalf \n14  of Plaintiff Cartwright only against the City of San Jose; and Claims 9, 10, 11, and 13 assert claims \n15  against all Defendants by all Plaintiffs under California state law.  Dkt. 108.1 \n16  I.  The individually named officer-Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on \nPlaintiffs’ § 1983 claims \n17 \n18    “To succeed on a § 1983 claim, a plaintiff must show that (1) the conduct complained of was \n19  committed by a person acting under color of state law; and (2) the conduct deprived the plaintiff of a \n20  federal constitutional or statutory right.”  Patel v. Kent Sch. Dist., 648 F.3d 965, 971 (9th Cir. 2011).  \n21  “The doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages \n22  unless a plaintiff pleads facts showing (1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right, \n23  and (2) that the right was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.”  Wood v. Moss, 572 \n24  U.S. 744, 757 (2014) (internal quotations omitted).  The Court analyzes these questions in “two distinct \n25  steps,” though it may do so “in either order.”  Thompson v. Rahr, 885 F.3d 582, 586 (9th Cir. 2018) \n26  (citing Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009)).  Both are “questions of law.”  Id. \n27   \n1 Because of numbering irregularities, and because Plaintiffs list two “counts” that merely state the \n28  relief they seek, the FAC recites claims numbering up to 13, of which only nine are substantive. \nPlaintiffs have also clarified that the FAC names Defendant Sykes only in his official capacity. \n10 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 21 of 61\n \n1  Once qualified immunity is pleaded as a defense, “the burden is on the plaintiff to prove” the \n2  violation of a clearly established right.  Isayeva v. Sacramento Sherriff’s Dept., 872 F.3d 938, 946 (9th \n3  Cir. 2017); Emmons v. City of Escondido, 921 F.3d 1172, 1174 (9th Cir. 2019).  “For a right to be \n4  clearly established” as necessary to overcome the defense of qualified immunity, “existing precedent \n5  must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.”  White v. Pauly, 137 S. Ct. \n6  548, 552 (2017).  Plaintiffs “must point to prior case law that articulates a constitutional rule specific \n7  enough to alert these [officers] in this case that their particular conduct was unlawful.”  Sharp v. Cty. \n8  of Orange, 871 F.3d 901, 911 (9th Cir. 2017). \n9  As can best be determined from the FAC, Plaintiffs here bring their § 1983 claims against \n10  Defendants Garcia, Knopf, Dwyer, Tassio, Matchett, Lynch, Lopez, and Lagorio (hereinafter \n11  “supervisory Defendants”) under a theory of supervisory liability.  Plaintiffs’ claims against the \n12  remaining Defendants (hereinafter “non-supervisory Defendants”) appear to assert theories of direct \n13  liability.  Plaintiffs predicate their § 1983 claims on two substantive constitutional theories: excessive \n14  force in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and speech-based retaliation in violation of the First \n15  Amendment.  Neither has merit.  \n16  A.  The non-supervisory Defendants did not violate clearly established Fourth \nAmendment law \n17 \n18  The Fourth Amendment prohibits “unreasonable . . . seizures.”  U.S. CONST. amend. IV.  This \n19  Amendment is not a proscription of any unreasonable law-enforcement conduct; it is concerned only \n20  with unreasonable “seizures.”  Id.  Thus, to establish a Fourth Amendment violation, a plaintiff must \n21  prove two things: (1) that he was seized, and (2) that the seizure was unreasonable.  E.g., Tennessee v. \n22  Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 7 (1985).    \n23  A person subject to law-enforcement force is only seized within the meaning of the Fourth \n24  Amendment when a police officer intentionally applies the force for the purpose of “taking possession” \n25  of that person.  California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 624 (1991) (“From the time of the founding to \n26  the present, the word ‘seizure’ has meant a ‘taking possession.’”); Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U.S. \n27  593, 596-97 (1989) (“[A] Fourth Amendment seizure . . . [occurs] only when there is a governmental \n28  termination of freedom of movement through means intentionally applied.”).  Thus, by definition, a \n11 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 22 of 61\n \n1  person whom police officers unintentionally or accidentally subject to force while attempting to detain \n2  another has not been seized.  See Brower, 489 U.S. at 596 (“[T]he Fourth Amendment addresses \n3  misuse of power, not . . . accidental effects . . . .”) (cleaned up); United States v. Lockett, 919 F.2d 585, \n4  590 n.4 (9th Cir. 1990) (“[A]n innocent bystander struck by a stray bullet . . . would not have [a Fourth \n5  Amendment] claim.”).  Rather, the plaintiff must have been the intended target of the force, and the \n6  force must have been used with the purpose of effecting an actual seizure.  See id. \n7   The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed this basic principle, holding that a “seizure requires the \n8  use of force with intent to restrain, as opposed to force applied . . . for some other purpose.”  Torres v. \n9  Madrid, 141 S. Ct. 989, 991 (2021).  Thus, the mere fact that a police officer uses force against a \n10  person cannot, in itself, establish a seizure.  Id.  The relevant Fourth Amendment question “is whether \n11  the [force used] objectively manifests an intent to restrain.”  Id.; see also Brower, 489 U.S. at 596 \n12  (holding that to constitute a seizure, a “detention or taking [of a person by police] must be willful”).  \n13  Moreover, a plaintiff seeking to prove that a seizure has occurred must establish this objective intent to \n14  restrain “unambiguous[ly].”  Jackson-Moeser v. Armstrong, 765 F. App’x 299, 299 (9th Cir. 2019) \n15  (citing Brendlin v. California, 551 U.S. 249, 255 (2007)).  \n16  Once a plaintiff proves she was seized, she must further prove that the seizure was \n17  unreasonable.  The Court determines “reasonableness by balancing the nature and quality of the \n18  intrusion on the individual’s Fourth Amendment interests against the countervailing governmental \n19  interests at stake.”  Felarca v. Birgeneau, 891 F.3d 809, 816 (9th Cir. 2018).  In most cases involving a \n20  seizure, where officers are attempting to arrest a particular person, this analysis turns primarily on such \n21  factors as “the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat . . . and \n22  whether he is actively resisting arrest.”  Id. 817.  But the crowd-control context involves additional \n23  governmental interests.  In particular, the Ninth Circuit has recognized the important governmental \n24  interest in avoiding “organized lawlessness” by “quickly dispersing and removing [] lawbreakers with \n25  the least risk of injury to police and others.”  Id. 818 (cleaned up).  The Ninth Circuit has further \n26  observed that the government has a significant “safety interest in controlling a mass of people,” \n27  especially where “protesters [] substantially outnumber[] officers, refuse[] to obey the officers’ \n28  commands to disperse, shout[] at the officers, and engage[] the officers in verbal and physical \n12 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 23 of 61\n \n1  altercations.”  Id. (cleaned up); Forrester v. City of San Diego, 25 F.3d 804, 807 (9th Cir. 1994) (“The \n2  wholesale commission of common state-law crimes creates dangers that are far from ordinary.  Even in \n3  the context of political protest, persistent, organized, premeditated lawlessness menaces in a unique \n4  way the capacity of a State to maintain order and preserve the rights of its citizens.”).  \n5  Plaintiffs’ excessive force claims here fail under these fundamental principles.  Defendants take \n6  the claims of each Plaintiff against the non-supervisory Defendants in turn.  \n7  1.  Cañas v. Yuen \n8  Plaintiff Cañas was struck in the eye by an unknown object at about 5:00 p.m. on May 29 while \n9  he was standing on Santat Clara Street, between Seventh and Eighth Streets.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 8 \n10  74:15-22, 84:7-86:12-19 (identifying on video marked PLF 0175 where and when object struck him); \n11  Dwyer Dec., ¶ 11.  Before that, Cañas had joined protesters who took over the streets of downtown San \n12  Jose and then marched onto Highway 101 to stop moving traffic.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 8 60:14-61:7.  \n13  Cañas saw people throwing things at the police line and feared police might respond by using force.  Id. \n14  56:8-18, 70:24-71:15, 83:5-15.  Cañas also heard police officers issuing the unlawful assembly \n15  declaration and dispersal order, and believes he heard a warning that police might use teargas if the \n16  crowd did not disperse.  Id. 77:5-78:17.  Cañas nevertheless decided not to leave the area because he \n17  wanted to play his guitar.  Id. 77:8-78:17.   At some point, Cañas noticed what he believed was teargas \n18  and “pop” sounds around him, which prompted many in the crowd to run back away from the police \n19  line.  Id. 84:18-86:9.  Still Cañas remained.  Id.  Shortly after this he felt an object hit his eye near the \n20  bridge of his nose.  Id.  Cañas did not see any police officer fire in his direction, and he has no basis for \n21  believing any police officer intentionally fired a projectile at him.  Id. 86:25-87:10, 94:12-24. \n22  Cañas has alleged that what hit him was a projectile fired by Officer Yuen.  That allegation is \n23  false.  Officer Yuen was not at or near Santa Clara between Eighth and Seventh Streets at the time \n24  Cañas felt he was hit; he did not arrive at the police line until nearly half an hour later, at which point \n25  the line and Officer Yuen were farther west of where Cañas was struck.  Yuen Dec., ¶ 3.  For that \n26  matter, Officer Yuen testified that he only used his PIW—a 40mm—to target assaultive suspects and to \n27  prevent serious injury.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 8 76:10-22.  So if Cañas was struck with a police \n28  projectile—which is unclear—and was, as he testified, only playing his guitar at the time, there is no \n13 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 24 of 61\n \n1  basis for the allegation that Yuen would have targeted him or deliberately struck him.  Finally, even if \n2  Cañas had evidenced to suggest Yuen fired a PIW on him, the clear purpose of that PIW use under the \n3  circumstances (following a dispersal order) was not to restrain but to disperse.  It is therefore \n4  impossible to say on this record that Yuen intentionally fired on Cañas for the purpose of restraining \n5  him, as necessary to show a Fourth Amendment seizure.  Torres, 141 S. Ct. at 991.  On the undisputed \n6  facts, Officer Yuen is entitled to judgment as a matter of law against Cañas.  \n7  2.  Vasquez v. Yuen & Simonini \n8  On May 29, Plaintiff Vasquez joined with protesters standing in the area of Santa Clara and \n9  Seventh Streets.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 9 54:8-14, 61:2-6, 75:9-76:9.  Vasquez saw police officers firing \n10  37mm toward the ground to disperse the crowd away from the police line.  Id. 58:10-59:12; Neumer \n11  Dec., Ex. 4, 17:07:15-17:08:05 (camera footage depicting Vasquez in green shirt and black jeans).  As \n12  Vasquez approached, she saw a woman who ignored officers’ orders and separated herself from the \n13  crowd to stand defiantly in front of the police line.  Id.; Pritchard Dec., Ex. 9 65:7-17.  Vasquez joined \n14  the woman, claiming that she was afraid for her given that officers had fired 37mm around her.  Id.  \n15  Vasquez heard the police unlawful assembly and dispersal order over the loudspeaker, but instead of \n16  leaving, she walked even closer to the police line.  Id. 85:9-12.  Officers ordered Vasquez to move, but \n17  she remained where she was.  Id. 98:5-8.   At some point after she had been commanded multiple times \n18  to disperse or move, Vasquez felt impact in her legs by something that felt similar to being hit by a \n19  paintball gun.  Id. 51:6-14.  She did not recover any item that she believes hit her.  Id. 54:5-7.  Vasquez \n20  testified that she left the protest “like 30 minutes” after officer dispersal orders, which she heard when \n21  she was in front of the police line at approximately 5:08 p.m.  Id. 90:2-19; Neumer Dec., Ex. 4, \n22  17:06:40-17:07:05.  Vasquez did not seek any medical treatment related to any injury sustained at the \n23  protest.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 9 132:3-8. \n24  Vasquez accuses Defendants Yuen and Simonini of striking her with projectiles.  But again, \n25  Officer Yuen was not even in the area at the time Vasquez claims she was hit—Vasquez puts that time \n26  between about 5:08 and 5:11, id. Ex. 28, well before Officer Yuen had arrived—so it is impossible that \n27  he fired upon her.  Officer Simonini was in the area of Santa Clara and Seventh Streets on May 29, but \n28  Plaintiffs have identified no evidence to suggest Officer Simonini fired upon Plaintiff.  They have \n14 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 25 of 61\n \n1  identified only body-worn camera footage showing officers firing 37mm around the vicinity of where \n2  Vasquez was standing.  Id.; Neumer Dec., Ex. 4, 17:08:20-17:13:00.  Moreover, even this footage does \n3  not show Vasquez being struck by anything.  Rather, the officers are firing around Vasquez toward the \n4  crowd behind her.  See id.  This is consistent with Officer Simonini’s testimony.  When shown the \n5  same video Plaintiffs identify at his deposition, Officer Simonini testified that although one officer in \n6  the video appeared to be him, he did not fire at Vasquez but rather aimed his 37mm at the ground well \n7  beyond and to the left of where she was standing.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 2 116:1-118:13.  The video \n8  reflects this as well—the officer standing to the left of the frame never fires anywhere near where \n9  Vasquez is standing.  Neumer Dec., Ex. 4, 17:08:20-17:13:00.  These undisputed facts foreclose \n10  Vasquez’s claim that Officer Simonini used force against her.  \n11  In her discovery responses, Vasquez later claimed that Officer Simonini’s body-worn camera \n12  also depicts her being struck just after 6:12 p.m.  See Pritchard Dec., Ex. 28.  This cannot support her \n13  excessive force claim against Officer Simonini for several reasons.  First, Vasquez testified at \n14  deposition that she left downtown San Jose within “like 30 minutes” of hearing the police dispersal \n15  order at just after 5:00 p.m.  Thus, according to Vasquez own sworn testimony, she was not even in the \n16  area at 6:12 p.m. when she claims she was struck. See Van Asdale v. Int’l Game Tech., 577 F.3d 989, \n17  998 (9th Cir. 2009) (“[A] party cannot create an issue of fact by an affidavit contradicting his prior \n18  deposition testimony.”) (cleaned up).  Second, the portion of the identified video does not show any \n19  projectile striking Vasquez.  Neumer Dec., Ex. 5, 18:12:15-18:13:00.  Rather, it shows Officer \n20  Simonini firing a projectile on the ground far to the side of Vasquez in the direction of a hostile crowd.  \n21  Although a woman wearing green pants (possibly Vasquez) can be seen to the right of this crowd, that \n22  woman is plainly not in the path of Officer Simonini’s projectile weapon.  Id.  Rather, she is \n23  significantly to the right of the frame when Officer Simonini fires.  Id.  It is not possible for a fact-\n24  finder to conclude based on this video that Officer Simonini struck Vasquez with a projectile.  \n25  Third, and finally, even if it were possible for a jury rationally to infer that Officer Simonini \n26  used his 37mm in a way that caused Vasquez to be struck with one of its small foam discs, (1) the \n27  clear, objective purpose of the force was to disperse, not to restrain, and therefore was not a seizure, see \n28  Black Lives Matter D.C. v. Trump, No. 20-CV-1469, 2021 WL 2530722, at *20 (D.D.C. June 21, 2021) \n15 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 26 of 61\n \n1  (holding officers did not seize plaintiffs but the “opposite,” as officers “attempted to cause the \n2  protesters and fleeing crowd to leave their location, rather than cause them to remain there”); and (2) \n3  that minimal force was reasonable under the circumstances.  Before Vasquez claims she was struck, the \n4  unlawful assembly in front of the police line where Officer Simonini was situated had been violent and \n5  hostile.  In the minutes after 5:00 p.m., officers had been pelted with objects, and one was knocked \n6  unconscious.  And roughly ten minutes before Officer Simonini fired his 37mm at 6:12, he witnessed \n7  protesters attacking a police officer and engaging in a scuffle, prompting the crowd to close in on the \n8  area.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 2 126:16-127:17.  This scuffle was significant enough that Officer Simonini \n9  thought the assaulted officer might need medical attention.  Id. 127:20-25; Neumer Dec., Ex. 5, \n10  18:11:30-18:12:05.  Seeing the crowd’s increasing aggressiveness, and as the police line approached a \n11  construction area where protesters were gaining access to dangerous objects that could be used as \n12  weapons, Officer Simonini aimed his 37mm to the area behind the closest protesters to back the crowd \n13  up and further attempt to cause dispersal.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 2 130:6-131:6.   \n14  The relatively minimal force of 37mm smoke and impact by skip-fired foam discs was justified \n15  given the significant government interest in “quickly dispersing and removing [] lawbreakers with the \n16  least risk of injury to police and others.”  Felarca, 891 F.3d at 818.  In a chaotic and dangerous \n17  situation in which “protesters [] substantially outnumbered officers, refused to obey the officers’ \n18  commands to disperse, shouted at the officers, and engaged the officers in verbal and physical \n19  altercations,” Officer Simonini determined that public safety demanded his prompt use of the 37mm to \n20  push the crowd back and prevent the situation on the police line from escalating yet further.  See id. \n21  818.  That decision was reasonable, and his force was not excessive as a matter of law.   \n22  This conclusion is all the more powerful in light of qualified immunity.  The purpose of the \n23  qualified immunity doctrine is to protect officers who are required to make fast public-safety decisions \n24  in situations where there is no controlling case law putting them on notice that their particular conduct \n25  would be unlawful.  See Sharp, 871 F.3d 901 at 911.  Plaintiffs here can point to no case involving \n26  remotely similar facts in which a police officer before May 2020 was held to have violated the Fourth \n27  Amendment by using a 37mm.  Even if Officer Simonini was mistaken in some aspect of fact or law \n28  leading up to his split-second decision to use the 37mm, it cannot be said that his mistake was so \n16 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 27 of 61\n \n1  unreasonable that only the “plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law” would have \n2  acted as he did.  Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U.S. 7, 12 (2015).  He is therefore entitled to qualified \n3  immunity under both the first and second prongs of the analysis.  See id. \n4  3.  Riles v. Simonini  \n5  Plaintiff Riles attended the protest on May 29.  She walked around the area near City Hall \n6  holding burning sage.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 12 84:1-20.  Riles was still holding the burning sage when \n7  she felt something strike her in the abdomen twice.  Id.  After this, Riles walked to where she saw her \n8  sister standing in front of the police line.  Id.; id. 67:22-68:14.  She spoke with her sister for a minute or \n9  so before leaving for home.  Id. 78:4-9.  She did not mention anything to her sister about being struck, \n10  nor is there any indication in camera footage of her that she is experiencing any pain or discomfort.  Id. \n11  76:1-13; Neumer Dec., Ex. 6, 17:21:30-17:22:35 (depicting Riles holding sage next to Vasquez).  Riles \n12  did not seek medical treatment for any injuries after the protest.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 12 86:9-10.   \n13  Plaintiffs allege that Officer Simonini struck Riles with a projectile, but that allegation is \n14  without any basis in the record.  The only evidence Plaintiffs have cited in discovery related to Riles is \n15  a three-minute portion of Officer Simonini’s body-worn camera video.  See Pritchard Dec., Ex. 31.  \n16  This is puzzling.  Officer Simonini does not fire his 37mm during the entirety of the three-minute clip \n17  of video indicated.  See Neumer Dec., Ex. 7, 17:20:00-17:23:00.  And Riles leaves the area within 30 \n18  seconds of the clip ending without a shot ever fired in her direction.  Id. 17:23:00-17:23:30.  These \n19  undisputed facts demonstrate that Officer Simonini did not use force against Riles, so he is entitled to \n20  judgment as a matter of law on her excessive force claim.  \n21  4.  Flores-Rodriguez v. Gaona & Grodin \n22  Plaintiff Flores was part of the crowd blocked Highway 101 traffic and then assaulted SJPD \n23  officers in the area.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 13 40:17-23, 44:17-19.  Once the crowd returned to Santa \n24  Clara Street, Flores saw that police officers had lined up, and he walked up to that police line.  Id. \n25  64:22-25.  The crowd of which Flores was a part pelted police officers with bottles, including one \n26  bottle the smashed into the windshield of a police vehicle directly in front of Flores as he was within \n27  feet of the police line.  See id. Ex. 36, 1:00-3:00.  Flores heard unlawful assembly and dispersal orders \n28  but did not leave the area because he was protesting and “documenting [the] situation.”  Id. Ex. 13 \n17 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 28 of 61\n \n1  65:1-68:11.  After police officers broadcast repeated dispersal orders and shouted at the crowd to \n2  “move,” Flores yelled out “don’t move!”  Id. 73:16-74:24.  Protesters then pushed up right against the \n3  police line, some engaging in skirmishes with officers there.  See Neumer Dec., Ex. 8, 17:03:00-\n4  17:04:00.  One of the protesters then approached the police line and, at just before 5:04 p.m., punched a \n5  police officer in the face, knocking him unconscious.  Officers in the line deployed 37mm to back the \n6  hostile crowd away and rescue the unconscious officer, and initially, much of the crowd backed up to \n7  an area farther away from the police line.  Id. 17:04:00-17:04:45.   \n8  Flores, however, remained close to the police line, pacing in front of officers with a red bandana \n9  on his face and something in his hand.  Id.  Nearly simultaneously, a bottle and then block of asphalt \n10  was thrown in the direction of the police line from the area where Flores was walking, prompting one \n11  officer to yell “watch out!”  Id. Ex. 2 17:04:30-17:04:50.  Officer Gaona, who was deployed in the area \n12  with a 40mm OC PIW and had witnessed the violence of the crowd up to that point, was at a vantage \n13  where he would have seen these objects coming from Flores’s general direction and heard the officer \n14  yell “watch out!”  Id.  Almost immediately after the objects were thrown, Flores appeared in front of \n15  the police line with an object in his hand.  Id.  Officer Gaona then officer fired one 40mm OC round at \n16  Flores’s thigh at 5:04 p.m.  Id.  Flores momentarily knelt to the ground, then continued to walk around \n17  the area, and after walking “no more than five steps” Flores felt another impact on his shoulder.  \n18  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 13 87:3-5.   Flores believes it was the same officer responsible for this second \n19  impact, but camera footage does not show Officer Gaona shooting his 40mm OC until nearly a minute \n20  after he struck Flores, and Flores does not appear in the scene when this later round is fired.  See \n21  Neumer Dec., Ex. 8, 17:04:35-17:05:30.  Flores then departed the area.  Flores testified that he had \n22  injuries to his shoulder and testicle, but he did not seek medical treatment for any injury after the \n23  protest, and he took no pictures of except to show bruising on his shoulder. \n24  Flores alleges excessive force against Officers Grodin and Gaona.  As to Officer Grodin, there \n25  is no basis in the evidentiary record for concluding that he used force against Flores.  Plaintiffs’ \n26  discovery responses do not identify any video footage besides that of Officer Goana in which Plaintiffs \n27  claim Flores’s rights were violated, see Pritchard Dec., Ex. 29, and there is nothing in Officer Gaona’s \n28  body-worn camera footage to suggest Officer Grodin appears there or used any force against Flores.  \n18 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 29 of 61\n \n1  Officer Grodin is accordingly entitled to judgment on this claim.  \n2  As to Officer Gaona, his is one of the rare instances in which Plaintiffs have identified an \n3  officer who actually struck the Plaintiff with a PIW.  But Flores’s excessive force claim fails for two \n4  reasons.  First, Officer Gaona did not seize Flores in any possible sense.  Officer Gaona was equipped \n5  with 40mm OC rounds, which he used directly only to target dangerous suspects who were throwing \n6  things at officers so as to prevent them from doing so.  Id. Ex. 14 93:18-94:20.  Thus, when Officer \n7  Gaona fired his 40mm OC round at Flores, he did so either in the attempt to disperse OC powder or to \n8  prevent Flores from throwing and object at police officers.  The circumstances of that force do not \n9  “objectively manifest[] an intent to restrain.”  Torres, 141 S. Ct. at 991.  They are, objectively, \n10  indications of force used for an altogether different purpose: to disperse an unlawful assembly or inflict \n11  force to prevent imminent injury by one of its members during an active riot.  See id.  At a minimum, it \n12  was not clearly established before May 29, 2020 that such force could constitute a seizure within the \n13  meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  So Officer Gaona would be entitled to qualified immunity even if \n14  the Court were to find that his force amounted to a seizure under the circumstances.   \n15  Second, even if Officer Gaona’s force constituted a seizure, it was reasonable.  In the moments \n16  preceding Officer Gaona’s use of the 40mm OC round, he witnessed a large and hostile crowd \n17  assaulting police officers with a rain of dangerous objects.  He saw members of the crowd scream at \n18  and scuffle with officers.  And he was there when one protester knocked an officer unconscious.  When \n19  Flores paced in front of the police line with something in his hands just seconds after a bottle and \n20  asphalt were thrown in the direction of police, it would be reasonable for Officer Gaona to conclude \n21  that Flores likely threw that bottle and would do so again.  His split-second decision to strike Flores in \n22  the thigh with a 40mm OC round and thereby prevent a perceived risk of further objects being thrown \n23  at officers was reasonable.  At a minimum, his decision was not so clearly unreasonable as to strip him \n24  of the protections of qualified immunity, as Plaintiffs can cite no case in which a police officer was \n25  held to have violated the Fourth Amendment under comparable circumstances.   \n26  5.  Cuellar v. Simonini, Adgar, Nguyen, Grodin, & Moran \n27  Plaintiff Cuellar joined protesters in marching onto Highway 101 and blocking traffic on May \n28  29.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 15 58:1-11.  While on the highway, she saw people destroying motorists’ \n19 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 30 of 61\n \n1  vehicles by smashing windows and denting cars, vandalizing public property, and destroying police \n2  cars.  Id. 80:2-81:11, 90:7-16.  Later, Cuellar was marching somewhere near City Hall—she is not sure \n3  exactly where—and heard unlawful assembly announcements.  Id. 116:5-117:11.  She subsequently felt \n4  something strike her in the calf.  She did not see any officer fire a projectile in her direction and does \n5  not believe any struck her struck intentionally.  Id. 130:17-22.  Cuellar sustained bruising, for which \n6  she sought medical treatment consisting of one online doctor’s visit.  Id. 149:2-22, 151:15-17.   \n7  Though she was struck only once, Cuellar accuses no fewer than five officers of shooting her \n8  with a PIW.  FAC ¶ 67.  The reason for this scattershot allegation is that Plaintiffs have no idea \n9  whether a police projectile caused Cuellar’s injury, or if so, what police officer with what agency fired \n10  the projectile.  Rather, Plaintiffs appear to assert that because some SJPD officers in the general \n11  vicinity of City Hall were using different PIW around the time Cuellar felt impact on her leg, each of \n12  these officers independently can be held liable for her alleged injury.  That assertion is wrong for many \n13  reasons.  The first and simplest is causation.  Without knowing anything more than that various \n14  individuals were using force at various times in a general area, Cuellar cannot possibly prove that any \n15  one of those individuals was responsible for hitting her with a projectile.  Sanchez v. City of Atherton, \n16  No. 22-cv-03106-JSW, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3763, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 9, 2023) (rejecting theory \n17  that plaintiff stuck by projectile at protest was “entitled to seek relief for his injury from officers [who] \n18  were present at the demonstrations even though he cannot identify which . . . caused his injury”). This \n19  is all the more clear given that there was agencies other than SJPD at the protest also using PIW.  Id. \n20  Second, there is no basis for the conclusion that any SJPD officer who might have used force on \n21  Cuellar did so with the objectively manifested purpose of detaining or otherwise restraining her.  To \n22  know whether the circumstances surrounding a use of force objectively indicate an intent to seize, the \n23  Court (and factfinder) must know what those circumstances are.  Plaintiffs, however, have none of that \n24  information.  They do not know what officer used force on Cuellar, what that officer observed, or what \n25  was happening around Cuellar at the time she was struck.  Indeed, the only facts that are known to the \n26  Court—that Cuellar was struck amid a chaotic riot in which protesters were repeatedly ordered to \n27  disperse—point strongly to the inference that any force used on Cuellar was for the purpose of \n28  dispersal.  And this is only if such force was even intentionally directed at Cuellar, which is dubious.  \n20 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 31 of 61\n \n1  This too precludes an excessive force claim against any of the named Defendants.  \n2  Finally, without knowing which officer (if any) struck Cuellar, the Court cannot possibly assess \n3  whether the officer doing so acted reasonably.  Again, the calculus for whether a use of force was \n4  reasonable turns on the circumstances known to the officer.  S.R. Nehad v. Browder, 929 F.3d 1125, \n5  1132 (9th Cir. 2019) (“Only information known to the officer at the time the conduct occurred is \n6  relevant [to reasonableness analysis].”). The Court must balance the governmental interest in force \n7  based on what the officer knew at the time against the intrusion on the individual the force caused.  It is \n8  impossible to conduct this balancing without knowing anything on one side of the equation, i.e., facts \n9  within the officer’s perception and knowledge.  Particularly where, as here, every officer named has \n10  testified that he did not use force except (1) for the 37mm, to disperse a hostile and violent crowd, and \n11  (2) for the 40mm, to target individuals throwing objects at police or otherwise posing a risk of \n12  imminent injury, there is no basis in the record for the Court to infer that any officer who used force \n13  around the time and place where Cuellar was struck did so without adequate cause.  Plaintiffs can \n14  therefore show neither that any of the named defendants acted unreasonably nor that clearly established \n15  law put them on notice that their conduct was unreasonable.   \n16  6.  Swift v. Curry, Silva, & Ayala \n17  Plaintiff Swift left to attend the protest on May 29 later in the evening, at about 7:30 p.m., with \n18  a friend.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 16 72:3-10.  Swift had seen news coverage of the protest and knew police \n19  had used teargas to disperse the crowd.  Id. 55:24-56:8.  She decided she would join the protesters to \n20  show support.  Id.  She brought goggles in anticipation of exposure to teargas.  Id. 61:10-16.  Swift and \n21  her friend drove to downtown and parked their car, after which they walked to Plaza de Cesar Chavez \n22  Park.  Id. 72:20-22, 74:20-75:4.  When they arrived at the park, Swift saw people facing a line of \n23  police.  Id. 80:5-11.  She saw a bottle thrown in the direction of the police line.  Id. 97:21-25.  The \n24  police officers issued an unlawful assembly and dispersal order to the crowd in the park—indeed, this \n25  was a portion of the same crowd to which police had been repeating dispersal orders for hours—though \n26  Swift claims she could not understand what was being said on the police loudspeaker. Id. 96:25-97:14.  \n27  Swift saw police officers using flashbang grenades and PIW, though she did not see any individual who \n28  was struck with a PIW.  Id. 100:15-101:17.   \n21 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 32 of 61\n \n1    Almost everyone in the park responded to the police dispersal orders by leaving, but Swift \n2  decided to stand at the entrance of the park to yell at the police.  Id.; Neumer Dec., Ex. 9, 20:42:30-\n3  20:43:00.  As the officers approached, they stayed in a line intended to slowly advance through the \n4  park and clear it of any unlawful assembly members.  See id. The officers yelled “get back!” and \n5  “move!” repeatedly, including by issuing that order directly to Swift.  Id. 20:42:45-20:44:50.  Swift, \n6  however, stood her ground at the entrance, yelling “nuh-uh” and “shame!” at the officers.  Id.  The \n7  officers continued to slowly advance while commanding Swift to move, pushing Swift in measured \n8  movements with their hands or batons when she planted herself in front of them.  Id.  The officers \n9  ordered Swift to “move!” dozens of times.  Id.  Yet after each time the officers said “move!” and \n10  pushed Swift, she again resituated herself in front of their moving line, and at times pushed back at the \n11  officers.  Id.  At one point Swift tussled with Officer Sean Curry by grabbing his baton and knocking \n12  his body-worn camera from his chest.  Id. Ex. 10, 20:43:10-20:43:15.  Swift testified that her “intent” \n13  was to “stay where [she] was and protest” regardless of officer commands.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 16 \n14  125:2-127:9.  Finally, after Swift’s repeated obstruction of the police line, one of the officers on the \n15  line arrested Swift.  Neumer Dec., Ex. 9, 20:44:50-20:45:00; id. Ex. 11, 20:43:00-20:44:50 \n16  Swift’s excessive force claim against Officers Curry, Silva,2 and Ayala is predicated on the \n17  officers’ use of a baton (or hands) to push her body back as she deliberately obstructed a police line \n18  from advancing.  The claim fails.  First, there can be no question that the objectively manifested \n19  purpose of the officers’ “force” in pushing Swift was to effect dispersal and move her away, rather than \n20  to stop her movement for the purpose of detention.  See Jackson-Moeser, 765 F. App’x at 299 (holding \n21  that the use of “baton strike[s]” to “push protesters off the freeway” did not show an intent to restrain \n22  and so did not constitute a seizure).  It follows that none of the pushes or shoves forming the basis for \n23  Swift’s excessive force claim constituted a seizure.  Her claim fails for this reason at the outset.   \n24  Second, the officers’ de minimis force in pushing Swift with their hands or batons as she \n25 \n \n2 Silva should be dismissed for the independent reason that he was not properly added as a defendant.  \n26 \nAfter orders from the Court dismissing all unnamed defendants, Plaintiffs never sought leave to add \n27  Silva in their amended complaint.  See Dkt. 70-1; Dkt. 81 at 12:23-25.  In their proposed FAC, \nPlaintiffs did not include Silva in the caption but improperly referenced him in body of the pleading. \n28  Dkt. 94.  Plaintiffs also never served Silva the First Amended Complaint.  Dkt. 109.  Thus, he was not \nproperly added, and the statute of limitations would bar any claims against him in any event.  Id. \n22 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 33 of 61\n \n1  willfully and persistently ignored their commands to “move!” and “go back!” was reasonable.  “Not \n2  every push or shove . . . violates the Fourth Amendment.”  Luchtel v. Hagemann, 623 F.3d 975, 982 \n3  (9th Cir. 2010).  Officers have a “significant” public safety interest in “quickly dispersing and \n4  removing” an unlawful assembly, including by using a police line to clear the area where that assembly \n5  has gathered.  Forrester, 25 F.3d at 807 (holding that the use of “pain compliance techniques” to clear \n6  demonstrators was reasonable).  The minimal force of using a baton or hands to shove a person creating \n7  an obstruction for the very purpose of removing the obstruction was reasonable.  Id.  Certainly it was \n8  not so obviously unreasonable in light of extant case law that officers here could lose the protection of \n9  qualified immunity.  The officers are consequently entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \n10  7.  Allen v. Yuen \n11    Plaintiff Allen left his home and walked to Plaza de Cesar Chavez Park sometime between 7:30 \n12  and 8:00 p.m. on May 29.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 17 45:24-46:2.  Like Swift, Allen saw the line of police \n13  officers issuing dispersal orders to the crowd from a nearby loudspeaker, though he claims not to have \n14  understood it.  Id. 73:21-74:4.  Allen then saw a line of police officers advancing toward the park, \n15  throwing flashbang devices in the area.  Id. 76:7-77:10.  Allen understood that officers were deploying \n16  the devices “to clear the park.”  Id. 77:16-17.  But Allen remained where he was at the park entrance as \n17  the officers advanced.  Id. 85:25-86:8.  When the officers got closer to Allen, he heard them ordering \n18  him to “move along,” “leave, go home.”  Id. 80:19-81:7.  Still Allen did not move or leave because he \n19  “felt like [he had] every right to be there.”  Id. 85:25-86:11.  When the police line arrive to Allen’s \n20  position, officers pushed him backwards.  Neumer Dec., Ex. 12, 20:43:00-20:43:30.  Allen did not then \n21  leave but joined a group of protesters further into the park.   \n22    The only force Allen has identified in connection with his excessive force claim is Officer \n23  Yuen’s pushing him once.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 32.  As with Plaintiff Swift, this excessive force claim \n24  fails because shoving a person as part of an ongoing effort to move the person back and disperse \n25  members of an unlawful assembly from an area is, by any objective measure, not force used with the \n26  intent to restrain but rather the opposite—i.e., force the with the intent to repel.  E.g., Jackson-Moeser, \n27  765 F. App’x at 299; McCoy v. Harrison, 341 F.3d 600, 606 (7th Cir. 2003) (police officer hitting \n28  knocking plaintiff to the ground was not a seizure because there was no objective intent to seize).  \n23 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 34 of 61\n \n1  Moreover, the Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit have made clear that mere shoves do not implicate the \n2  Fourth Amendment, particularly when there is a strong governmental interest in dispersing an unlawful \n3  assembly.  See Luchtel, 623 F.3d at 982; Forrester, 25 F.3d at 807.  “[E]ven if [such a push or shove] \n4  may later seem unnecessary in the peace of a judge’s chambers,” that does not mean “it violates the \n5  Fourth Amendment.”  Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396 (1989).  This is especially clear, again, in \n6  light of qualified immunity, as no cases has found excessive force in a similar context involving the \n7  enforcement of a dispersal order during a chaotic protest.  Allen does not allege any other force by \n8  Officer Yuen—he alleges that some other, unidentified officer struck him with a projectile, FAC \n9  ¶ 103—so Officer Yuen is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on his excessive force claim.   \n10  8.  Acosta v. Yuen, Nguyen, & Grodin \n11  Plaintiff Acosta left his home to attend the protest sometime during the evening of May 29.  He \n12  was aware beforehand that protesters had taken over the streets around Santa Clara.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. \n13  18 40:16-41:23.  Acosta walked toward police he saw in the distance because he wanted to be where \n14  things were “going on.”  Id. 47:14-25.  He eventually encountered a police line across Fourth Street \n15  facing toward Third Street.  Id. 60:12-61:1.  While Acosta was mere feet from the police line, the \n16  police loudspeaker broadcasted an unlawful assembly and dispersal order.  Pritchard Dec. Ex. 35.  \n17  Acosta assumes he heard this order, but he did not thereafter leave the area.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 18 \n18  97:7-21.  He instead walked to the intersection of Third and Santa Clara Streets, where he stopped and \n19  took a number of pictures and videos on his phone.  Id.; id. 110:4-113:24. \n20  As Acosta stood at this intersection, the situation around him devolved into chaos.  Acosta \n21  testified that the crowd became “much more aggressive and violent.”  Id. 122:7-18.  An out-of-control \n22  SUV suddenly screeched up to the intersection, endangering nearby pedestrians.  Pritchard Dec. Ex. 34, \n23  0:30-2:00.  A small group of police officers coming from the direction of Third Street fired their PIW \n24  at the SUV, prompting its driver to stop and get out next to where Acosta stood.  Id.  As officers \n25  attempted to take the driver into custody, nearby protesters rushed up to the scene aggressively.  The \n26  officers removed the man from the area, moving to the police line at Fourth Street.  Id. at 2:30-3:00.  \n27  As soon as the officers were no longer next to the SUV, protesters began to destroy it, smashing its \n28  windows with skateboards and other objects and attempting to overturn the vehicle with coordinated \n24 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 35 of 61\n \n1  pushes.  Id. 2:45-3:50.  At the same time, other protesters set a large dumpster on fire and the pushed \n2  the flaming dumpster into the SUV next to Acosta.  Id.; id. Ex. 37.   \n3  Though Acosta testified that he found these events “shocking,” he did not leave the area as they \n4  unfolded.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 18 118:13-120:24.  He instead stood there and took photos and video, \n5  including of the destroyed SUV and flaming dumpster.  Id.; id. Ex. 34, 3:30-50.  As he did so, violence \n6  around him escalated.  Police officers attempted to put a stop to it with flashbang grenades and teargas \n7  around the violent crowd.   Id.  These flashbangs burst all around Acosta, even to the point of causing \n8  him to duck to avoid flying debris.  Id.  Protesters threw objects at police, including one directly in \n9  front of Acosta who threw a teargas canister back at the police line.  Id.  Yet even as he was ducking \n10  debris and watching the unfolding battle between protesters and police, Acosta continued to stand there \n11  and film.  Id.  Then, at 7:09 p.m. an object struck Acosta in the eye, causing it serious injury.  Id.; FAC \n12  ¶ 91.  He did not recover the object and does not know what exactly it was. Pritchard Dec., Ex. 18 \n13  140:22-141:9. \n14  Although only one object struck Acosta a single time, Plaintiffs name three different police \n15  officers in his excessive force count: Officers Yuen, Nguyen, and Grodin.  This is because Plaintiffs do \n16  not know which of these officers, if any, was responsible for the object that struck Acosta’s eye.  See \n17  Sanchez, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3763 at *9 (holding that plaintiff at protest cannot “have a valid claim \n18  against all Defendants when it is undisputed that only one projectile caused him harm”).  Rather, \n19  Plaintiffs have named the officers as an undifferentiated troika based solely, it appears, on the opinions \n20  of their putative expert, a retired police chief.  This witness concluded based on his review of body-\n21  camera footage that Officer Yuen “most likely” fired the projectile that struck Acosta, but that he could \n22  not “rule out” Officers Nguyen or Grodin.  See Pritchard Dec. ¶¶ 40-42. \n23  All three named Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on these facts.  As to \n24  Officers Nguyen and Grodin, the undisputed facts do not create any triable issue regarding whether \n25  they used force on Acosta.  Plaintiffs’ own expert has concluded it was Officer Yuen who more likely \n26  than not fired a projectile that struck Acosta.  Id.  It follows necessarily that it is less likely than not that \n27  the other two did.  Plaintiffs’ own evidence, then, could not prove by a preponderance that Officers \n28  Nguyen and Grodin were responsible for the use of force Acosta alleges.  Moreover, even without the \n25 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 36 of 61\n \n1  opinion testimony Plaintiffs will offer, the record does not create a dispute about whether Officers \n2  Nguyen and Grodin fired the projectile that struck Acosta.  The only video evidence on record does not \n3  show those officers firing at Acosta, so there is no dispute that they were not responsible for the \n4  projectile that struck him.  Even if those officers were in the general area and fired their PIW \n5  somewhere near in time to when Acosta was struck, those facts cannot, without more, suffice to create \n6  a dispute of material fact or to hold them liable for excessive force.  Sanchez, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n7  3763 at *11 (rejecting excessive force claim based on projectile hitting plaintiff in the eye where he \n8  “identified three individual officers by name who deployed rounds around the time and place of his \n9  injury, but he cannot allege which of them deployed the injury-causing round”); Celotex, 477 U.S. at \n10  323; Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87 (1986). \n11  As to Officer Yuen, Plaintiffs’ excessive force claim against him fails (and would fail against \n12  the other officers even if they did use force on him) because Plaintiffs can prove neither (1) an \n13  intentional seizure nor (2) unreasonableness.  First, it is undisputed on this record that no officer struck \n14  Acosta intentionally.  On the contrary, if any of these officers fired a round that hit Acosta, it was \n15  plainly accidental.  The undisputed facts are that Acosta was struck in the midst of a chaotic scene in \n16  which a mob of violent protesters immediately behind and around Acosta were destroying a vehicle, \n17  lighting things on fire, throwing objects at officers, and otherwise exhibiting rampant lawlessness.  The \n18  flashbangs and other instruments used on the crowd nearly simultaneously with Acosta’s being struck \n19  were officers’ attempt to bring back some semblance of order and safety in the midst of this chaos.  The \n20  only reasonable inference from these undisputed facts is that any officer who fired in the direction of \n21  Acosta did so to strike one of the many violent protesters in his immediate vicinity and merely struck \n22  Acosta by mistake.  Indeed, all officers confirmed in deposition when shown video of Acosta’s being \n23  struck they would not have fired at Acosta intentionally.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 8 152:4-153:24; id. Ex. 26 \n24  83:7-12, 148:3-9; id. Ex. 27 121:4-122:24.  As a matter of law, such unintentional or collateral force is \n25  not a Fourth Amendment seizure, because it does not involve a “termination of freedom of \n26  movement through means intentionally applied.”  Brower, 489 U.S. at 596-97; Lockett, 919 F.2d at 590 \n27  n.4 (“[A]n innocent bystander struck by a stray bullet” cannot “have [a Fourth Amendment] claim.”).   \n28  An additional reason why Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate an intentional seizure is that the \n26 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 37 of 61\n \n1  circumstances do not permit the inference that police officers’ force in firing PIW was, objectively \n2  measured, for the purpose of detaining or restraining Acosta (or any other person).  Rather, any such \n3  PIW use was for the purpose of repelling violent protesters and preventing them from throwing objects \n4  at officers.  This is very different from the typical use of force in a police scenario, where officers \n5  deploy weapons or other means for the purpose of apprehending a person suspected of a crime.  \n6  Because the officers’ use of PIW was used objectively not to restrain but for “some other purpose,” that \n7  force cannot constitute a seizure under the Fourth Amendment.  See Torres, 141 S. Ct. at 991. \n8  Finally, even if Plaintiffs were able to show any officer intentionally applied force to Acosta \n9  with the purpose of restraining, that force was reasonable under the circumstances.  Again, the context \n10  is critical.  Acosta was hit at the locus of perhaps the most violent, lawless activity of the entire protest.  \n11  A large dumpster on fire, the wanton and open destruction of property, assaults toward police officers \n12  (including by lobbing teargas or other objects back at the police line)—these are the hallmarks of an \n13  utter breakdown in law and order.  As the Ninth Circuit observed, this type of unmitigated, open \n14  lawlessness “creates dangers that are far from ordinary,” for it “menaces in a unique way the capacity \n15  of a State to maintain order and preserve the rights of its citizens.”  Forrester, 25 F.3d at 807.  \n16  Although the use of 40mm is not without risks, the compelling government interest in restoring order \n17  amid such chaos justifies it as against violent lawbreakers.  Officers here therefore acted reasonably in \n18  making the split-second decision to use their 40mm in a way they justifiably perceived was needed to \n19  regain control of the situation and subdue the violent members of the unlawful assembly.  At a \n20  minimum, any mistake in judgment the officers made would be just that—a mistake, which is not \n21  sufficient to create Fourth Amendment liability over the protections of qualified immunity.  Plaintiffs \n22  can cite no case involving an acutely violent episode amid an ongoing, largescale unlawful assembly in \n23  which a police officer has been held to violate the Fourth Amendment by firing a PIW at members of \n24  that unlawful assembly.  Qualified immunity therefore precludes liability against Defendants here. \n25  9.  Naemeh v. Orabuena, Weber, & Situ \n26  Plaintiff Naemeh came to City Hall to protest what he called a “class war” on May 30.  \n27  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 19 17:6-12, 27:5-28:12.  He brought with him a paintball mask because he expected \n28  clashes with police officers and thought it would protect him against teargas.  Id. 51:3-6, 54:8-55:20.  \n27 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 38 of 61\n \n1  Later in the afternoon, Naemeh was in front of City Hall near Fourth Street, where he heard police \n2  declare an unlawful assembly and order the crowd to disperse.  Id. 63:25-64:16.  He did not leave \n3  because he did not agree with the unlawful assembly declaration and wanted to remain and protest.  Id. \n4  70:24-71:12.  As he walked around the City Hall area, Naemeh had two water bottles in his hands filled \n5  with a white substance.  Id. 68:10-70:1, 86:20-87:10.  At some point when he was near the “rocks” and \n6  “cement seating areas” in front of City Hall, Naemeh felt impact on his leg from what he believes was a \n7  “rubber bullet.”  Id. 75:8-12, 76:11-77:6.  He claims he had his hands with the two white water bottles \n8  raised at the time.  Id. 76:14-18.  Naemeh later told police officers that the impact to his leg did not \n9  “hurt that bad,” and that he expected a “rubber bullet to hurt more.”  Id. 162:17-24.   \n10  Naemeh then walked around different streets of downtown, often standing in the middle of \n11  intersections and blocking traffic.  Id. 125:16-23.  A helicopter unit in the area observing the unlawful \n12  assembly broadcast these facts and specifically alerted police officers to the presence of a person in a \n13  paintball mask with red laces who had frozen water bottles in his hands.  Neumer Dec., Ex. 1 \n14  (SJ025732).  Among these officers was Officer Situ.  Officer Situ was on an arrest team on May 30.  \n15  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 20 34:18-36:2.  Officer Situ received information that Naemeh (by description) was \n16  throwing frozen water bottles at police officers, and he was told the area where Naemeh was located.  \n17  Id. 71:3-10.  Officer Situ responded to the area and saw Naemeh, fitting the description of the person \n18  who had assaulted police officers.  Id. 86:21-87:11.  As soon as Officer Situ arrived in the area, \n19  Naemeh ran away.  Neumer Dec., Ex. 18, 20:37:45-20:38:45.  Officer Situ chased Naemeh and yelled \n20  at him to stop, but Naemeh continued to run until he came upon another group of police officers.  Id.  \n21  Naemeh then abruptly stopped, and Officer Situ pushed him to the ground so as to take him into \n22  custody.  Id. \n23   Plaintiffs’ excessive force claim against Officers Orabuena and Weber is based on their \n24  contention that the former fired a projectile that struck Naemeh in the leg.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 30.   \n25  Plaintiffs point to a segment of video in which, following a radio broadcast about a suspect throwing \n26  frozen water bottles near City Hall, Officer Weber told Officer Orabuena that a person in a paintball \n27  mask had frozen water bottles in his hands and was behind a large planter.  Id.; id. Ex. 21 22:6-14; \n28  Neumer Dec., Ex. 13, 19:21:50-19:22:40.  Officer Orabuena determined this person would continue to \n28 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 39 of 61\n \n1  assault officers, so he fired two 40mm rounds in that direction with the purpose of causing the suspect \n2  to stop hurling dangerous objects and leave.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 21 97:14-24.  \n3  Plaintiffs’ claim against these officers fails for several reasons.  First, the obvious purpose of \n4  Officer Orabuena’s deploying of the 40mm round Naemeh claims hit him was not to arrest or restrain \n5  but to repel.  There is no dispute of fact on this question: the circumstances of Officer Orabuena’s \n6  40mm use make clear as an objective matter that it was intended to cause Naemeh to leave the area and \n7  desist in throwing frozen water bottles at police officers.  It was therefore not a seizure, which ends the \n8  Fourth Amendment inquiry.  Second, even if Officer Orabuena had used his 40mm with the objective \n9  intent to restrain Naemeh, that was a reasonable use of force.  Frozen water bottles are the equivalent of \n10  large rocks when lobbed at a police officer.  Officer Orabuena had experienced personally frozen water \n11  bottles, rocks, and other objects thrown at him, and he was aware of the danger they presented.  Id. \n12  Ex. 21 22:11-24.  When he discovered a person carrying water bottles and hiding behind planters—a \n13  tactic he had observed others who threw things at officers to use—he acted quickly by firing his 40mm \n14  at the person so as to cause him to leave the area.  Id. 97:14-99:15.  That was not so unreasonable under \n15  the circumstances that only the “plainly incompetent” officer or one who “knowingly violates the law” \n16  would have understood it to be excessive.  Qualified immunity therefore prohibits liability for that \n17  split-second decision.  \n18  Finally, as to Officer Weber, it is not a Fourth Amendment violation merely to point out facts to \n19  a fellow officer.  Officer Weber told Officer Orabuena that a person had frozen water bottles in his \n20  hand.  This is an appropriate thing for a police officer to do during a riot in which people were \n21  throwing frozen water bottles at police officers.  Even if Officer Orabuena’s subsequent use of his \n22  40mm was somehow improper, that act is not chargeable to Officer Weber, who could not know \n23  exactly what his fellow officer would do with the information.  Plaintiff can articulate no law—much \n24  less clearly established law—showing such conduct to constitute a Fourth Amendment violation.  \n25  Officer Weber is therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this independent ground. \n26  Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claim against Officer Situ fails as well.  The only force the \n27  officer used was to push Naemeh to the ground as Naemeh fled from police officers and evaded arrest.  \n28  Neumer Dec., Ex. 18, 20:37:45-20:38:45.  That force was reasonable.  Under the applicable Graham \n29 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 40 of 61\n \n1  factors: (1) Naemeh was suspected of assaulting police officers by throwing frozen water bottles at \n2  them, which is dangerous criminal activity, in addition to his repeatedly disregarding dispersal orders; \n3  (2) Naemeh’s suspected activity of assaulting officers presented a significant threat to them and the \n4  public; and (3) Naemeh evaded arrest by fleeing from officers and ignoring their commands that he \n5  stop.  Graham, 490 U.S. at 396.  In light of the substantial government interests in arresting Naemeh, \n6  the minimal force of pushing him to the ground—resulting in no injury, Neumer Dec., Ex. 18, 20:39:10 \n7  (Naemeh stating he was uninjured during arrest)—was easily reasonable as a matter of law.  This is no \n8  less true because Naemeh stopped for a brief moment before he was pushed.  Officer Situ did not have \n9  time in the midst of chasing a fleeing suspect to register that Naemeh had stopped before his push, and \n10  in any event, he did not have to assume that Naemeh would not resume his flight from officers if not \n11  pushed.  Particularly in light of qualified immunity, and that Plaintiffs can cite no case finding \n12  excessive force under similar circumstances, Plaintiffs’ claim against Officer Situ fails.   \n13  B.   The non-supervisory Defendants did not violate clearly established First Amendment \nlaw \n14 \n15  To succeed on their First Amendment retaliation claims, Plaintiffs must prove (1) “they were \n16  engaged in a constitutionally protected activity,” (2) Defendants’ actions would “chill a person of \n17  ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in the protected activity,” and (3) “the protected activity \n18  was a substantial or motivating factor in [Defendants’] conduct.”  Index Newspapers LLC v. United \n19  States Marshals Serv., 977 F.3d 817, 827 (9th Cir. 2020).  Plaintiffs retaliation claims fail on the third \n20  of these elements, because they can point to no evidence that any Defendant took any action against \n21  him or her based on retaliatory or speech-based animus.   \n22  As demonstrated above, most Plaintiffs—Cañas, Vasquez, Riles, Cuellar, and Acosta—cannot \n23  prove on the undisputed facts that the Defendants they have named intended to use force on them at all.  \n24  See supra Argument Section I.A.  These Plaintiffs are necessarily unable to make the further \n25  evidentiary showing that the named Defendants targeted each of them for force based on retaliatory or \n26  speech-based animus (rather than inadvertently in the course of attempting to control a violent crowd or \n27  stop imminent assaults).  See id.  For those Plaintiffs who do have evidence that the named Defendants \n28  used force against them on purpose—Flores-Rodriguez, Swift, Allen, and Naemeh—the undisputed \n30 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 41 of 61\n \n1  facts foreclose the inference that those Plaintiffs’ speech had anything to do with the officers’ actions.  \n2  This follows from the context of each use of force.  Police officers were facing a violent \n3  unlawful assembly that had, following assaults of civilians and police officers, been ordered to disperse \n4  multiple times to no avail.  See id.  For Flores-Rodriguez, a police officer had just been knocked out, \n5  and officers were in the process of being pelted with dangerous objects.  Id.  For Swift and Allen, \n6  officers were in the process of dispersing an entire park after members of the crowd had shot fireworks \n7  and other objects at the police line.  Id.  And for Naemeh, officers had received information that he \n8  specifically had two frozen water bottles and had been throwing the same at police officers.  Id.   \n9  On the other side of the equation, Plaintiffs cannot adduce a single fact to show that any \n10  Defendants harbored speech-based animus against them.  Completely absent from this record is any \n11  evidence that any Defendant suggested to Plaintiffs they were not allowed to express any particular \n12  idea or message, or that Defendants did anything else to suggest “opposition to [Plaintiffs’] speech” at \n13  the protest.  Howard v. City of Coos Bay, 871 F.3d 1032, 1045 (9th Cir. 2017) (noting evidence of such \n14  opposition among the types of cognizable “[c]ircumstantial evidence” that “can create a ‘genuine issue \n15  of material fact on the question of retaliatory motive’”).  Indeed, every Plaintiff in this case has been \n16  given the opportunity at deposition to testify as to any statements or actions by Defendants they \n17  witnessed suggesting they were targeted for their message, and none has identified any.  There is \n18  simply no basis on which a rational jury could infer these officers used force not for the obvious law-\n19  enforcement objectives associated with crowd control but because each officer secretly intended to \n20  punish these Plaintiffs in particular—among all the hundreds of other people expressing an identical \n21  message—based on their expressive activity.   \n22  C.  The supervisory Defendants did not violate clearly established First or Fourth \nAmendment law \n23 \n24    Because “masters do not answer for the torts of their servants” under § 1983, “the term \n25  ‘supervisory liability’ is a misnomer.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 677 (2009).  Thus, a police \n26  supervisor can never be held “liable for ‘knowledge and acquiescence in [his] subordinates’” alleged \n27  misconduct.  Id.  Rather, a supervisor is liable only for his own affirmative conduct that violates a \n28  person’s constitutional rights.  Id.  The Ninth Circuit has held “in conditions of confinement cases” that \n31 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 42 of 61\n \n1  a supervisory official can be held liable “if there exists either (1) his or her personal involvement in the \n2  constitutional deprivation, or (2) a sufficient causal connection between the supervisor’s wrongful \n3  conduct and the constitutional violation.”  Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir. 2011) (cleaned \n4  up).  The plaintiff in such cases must prove that the supervisor acted with “deliberate indifference,” and \n5  that his conduct was the “proximate cause of the [plaintiff’s] injury.”  Id.3  “Deliberate indifference is a \n6  stringent standard of fault, requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a known or obvious \n7  consequence of his action.”  Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51, 61 (2011) (cleaned up).  When there \n8  are multiple supervisory defendants, proof of causation “must be individualized and focus [on] each \n9  individual defendant.”  Leer v. Murphy, 844 F.2d 628, 633 (9th Cir. 1988). \n10  As with much of Plaintiffs’ FAC, their allegations against the nine named supervisory \n11  Defendants are vague and non-specific.  For the vast majority of them, Plaintiffs provide no hint as to \n12  the basis for each supervisory Defendants’ purported liability.  Contra id. (requiring specific proof as to \n13  each individual named).  Nor has discovery made the basis for these claims any clearer.  Regardless, \n14  the undisputed facts establish that no supervisory Defendant violated any Plaintiff’s constitutional \n15  rights, much less clearly so as necessary to overcome qualified immunity.  Defendants will endeavor to \n16  review the claim as to each supervisory Defendant in turn.4  \n17  1.  Chief Edgardo Garcia and Assistant Chief David Knopf \n18  Defendant Garcia was the SJPD Chief of Police during May 2020.  Other than at the most \n19  general level, Chief Garcia was not involved in planning, implementation, or tactics at the protest.  \n20  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 22 24:24-25:5, 42:12-17.  Chief Garcia was aware that a protest was occurring in \n21   \n3 Except in the unique state-created danger context, the Ninth Circuit has never in a published decision \n22 \nfound supervisory liability for “deliberate indifference” outside condition of confinement cases.  For \nthe sake of completeness, Defendants will analyze Plaintiffs’ claims under the deliberate indifference \n23 \nstandard here, but it is their position that, following Iqbal, supervisory liability is permissible only \n24  when a state actor affirmatively and intentionally causes another harm—not when his purported \ndeliberate indifference results in a third party or subordinate causing harm.   \n25 \n  \n4 Among the Plaintiffs listed in the claims against supervisory Defendants are NAACP of San Jose/ \n26 \nSilicon Valley and San Jose Peace and Justice Center.  Though spacing limitations preclude Defendants \n27  from briefing the issue, these organizations do not have standing to assert claims, nor do they have \nstanding to pursue equitable relief (the only form of relief they seek).  See Dkt. 99, pp. 23-25.  In any \n28  event, these organizations have not alleged nor articulated any basis for the supervisory liability claims \nin which they are listed, so their claims would fail for the same reasons that apply to all other Plaintiffs.  \n32 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 43 of 61\n \n1  San Jose on May 29, and he received general updates about the protest from his chain of command.  Id. \n2  19:6-11.   Chief Garcia considered Assistant Chief (“A.C.”) Knopf to be the “operational commander,” \n3  meaning that he would coordinate the SJPD response to the protest at the highest level.  Id. 41:11-16.  \n4  After learning that the protest had become very violent, Chief Garcia and A.C. Knopf discussed the \n5  need to declare the crowd an unlawful assembly, which was subsequently done at around 4:30 p.m.  Id. \n6  27:3-20.  Chief Garcia and A.C. Knopf also talked about teargas, and Chief Garcia agreed that teargas \n7  could be used if necessary.  Id. 31:8-22.  Chief Garcia was not present downtown during any of the \n8  protest on May 29; he received updates from his chain of command remotely, and on May 30, he \n9  attended a briefing of police officers at the SAP Center.  Id. 41:17-20, 74:4-5, 111:5-10 \n10  As operational commander, A.C. Knopf was provided regular updates regarding the violence at \n11  the protest.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 7 31:4-16.  After protesters took over the highway, assaulted civilians \n12  there, threw objects at police, and destroyed property, A.C. Knopf agreed that the crowd should be \n13  declared an unlawful assembly and ordered dispersed.  Id. 56:18-57:10.  He also approved teargas as a \n14  crowd-control tool as he learned that protesters had failed to disperse after multiple warnings, escalated \n15  assaults against police officers, and knocked one officer unconscious.  Id.  A.C. Knopf otherwise had \n16  no substantive involvement in the tactics or response of SJPD at the protest.  Id. 33:23-34:7.   \n17    Plaintiffs name Chief Garcia and A.C. Knopf in their individual capacities in all their First and \n18  Fourth Amendment claims.  The reasons for their doing so on this evidentiary record are a mystery.  \n19  Neither Chief Garcia nor A.C. Knopf ordered any use of force against any Plaintiff.  They did not \n20  instruct or authorize any police officers to use force in any instance, and there is no evidence to suggest \n21  they were ever aware of any such use of force before or while it happened.  Chief Garcia was not even \n22  at the protests.  Plainly Chief Garcia and A.C. Knopf cannot have proximately caused the violation of \n23  any Plaintiff’s First or Fourth Amendment rights, whether intentionally or through deliberate \n24  indifference based on facts known to them.  A contrary finding would amount to pure vicarious \n25  supervisory liability, which case law flatly prohibits.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. 677. \n26    To the extent Plaintiffs mean to assert supervisory liability against Chief Garcia or A.C. Knopf \n27  based solely on their decision to approve an unlawful assembly order or the use of teargas, the assertion \n28  is meritless.  It is not unconstitutional for police officers to issue unlawful assembly or dispersal orders \n33 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 44 of 61\n \n1  to a violent crowd, and Plaintiffs do not argue otherwise.  Nor is it unconstitutional for police officers \n2  to use teargas amid an unlawful assembly.  As with any police force, the use of teargas and other \n3  dispersal efforts is only unconstitutional (as relevant here) if the officer employing them does so in \n4  retaliation for expressive activity or under circumstances rendering the force excessive in light of the \n5  governmental interests at stake.  See supra Argument Sections I.A. & I.B.  Thus, Chief Garcia’s and/or \n6  A.C. Knopf’s decision to authorize these valid law-enforcement tools cannot possibly reflect an \n7  intention to violate the Constitution, nor does it show they were aware that protesters’ constitutional \n8  rights would be violated and acquiesced to that possibility, as needed to show deliberate indifference.  \n9  The undisputed facts entitled Chief Garcia and A.C. Knopf to judgment as a matter of law.   \n10  2.  Captain Jason Dwyer \n11  Defendant Captain Dwyer was head of the Special Operations Unit in May 2020.  Pritchard \n12  Dec., Ex. 3 12:8-15, 17:23-18:3, 76:1-10.  He and other police officials were the “incident \n13  commanders” at different times of the protest, meaning they coordinated the police response as a \n14  whole.  Id. 75:25-77:2.  As intermittent incident commander, Captain Dwyer spent most of his time at \n15  the SJPD Command Post located in the SAP Center near downtown San Jose, though he was \n16  occasionally out in the field so that he could maintain “situational awareness.”   Id. 77:3-80:17, 321:13-\n17  20.  On May 29, Captain Dwyer was provided ongoing updates regarding the unfolding protest, \n18  including about the crowd taking over Highway 101 and assaulting innocent bystanders there.  Id. 50:7-\n19  24, 111:4-8.  Captain Dwyer also learned about assaults to SJPD police officers and destruction of \n20  SJPD (and other) property near the highway.  Id. 46:21-50:24.  He was informed when SJPD declared \n21  the crowd responsible for these acts an unlawful assembly and issued dispersal orders starting at about \n22  4:30 p.m.  Id. 54:16-55:3. \n23  Shortly after that, at about 5:00 p.m., Captain Dwyer arrived in the general area of the police \n24  line at Santa Clara and Ninth Streets.  Id. 44:11-13, 53:4-10.  Once there, Captain Dwyer witnessed \n25  immediate and unprecedented violence and hostility from the crowd, including multiple objects being \n26  thrown at the police line.  Id. 59:17-60:4.  Captain Dwyer was himself struck by at least one such \n27  object—a chunk of asphalt that hit his arm.  Id. 31:5-10.  Captain Dwyer became aware that a protester \n28  had knocked a police officer on the line unconscious.  The situation was one of the scariest and most \n34 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 45 of 61\n \n1  shocking Captain Dwyer had witnesses in over two decades in law enforcement.  Id. 286:15-19.  \n2  Having seen these levels of aggression and violence from the unlawful assembly, as well as the \n3  crowd’s manifest unwillingness to comply with the repeatedly issued dispersal order, Captain Dwyer \n4  authorized police officers to use 37mm.  Id. 83:21-84:20, 301:14-19.  Captain Dwyer also later \n5  authorized use of 40mm OC rounds.  Id. 329:6-24.  He did not order any officer to use any PIW or \n6  instruct any individual police officer to use a PIW in any particular instance.  Rather, as the SJPD Duty \n7  Manual explicitly contemplated, he provided authorization for use of the 37mm and 40mm OC rounds \n8  where appropriate and within the strictures of the DM amid a declared unlawful assembly. Id. 83:21-\n9  84:20, 86:6-88:3, 121:8-122:5, 138:17-139:1.  \n10  Between 5:30 and 6:30 p.m., Captain Dwyer left the field for the Command Post, where he \n11  remained except for occasional excursions back into the field to attain situational awareness.  Id. 76:11-\n12  77:6, 321:13-20.  When the unlawful assembly moved into Plaza de Cesar Chavez Park, several \n13  members lit various trash cans on fire and launched fireworks at police officers.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 3 \n14  205:19-206:25.  Upon learning of this Captain Dwyer agreed with Sergeant Lee Tassio that SJPD \n15  officers would attempt dispersing the crowd from the park after further dispersal orders were given.  Id.  \n16  There is nothing from these undisputed facts, or any others on record, to show Captain Dwyer’s \n17  actions or conduct could possibly have amounted to a violation of any Plaintiff’s constitutional rights. \n18  He did not order any SJPD officer to use force against any Plaintiff.  Indeed, Plaintiffs can point to no \n19  evidence in the record to suggest that Captain Dwyer even saw any instance in which a police officer \n20  used force against any Plaintiff.  It follows that Captain Dwyer could not have caused any police use of \n21  force that Plaintiffs allege violated their rights.  \n22  To the extent Plaintiffs seek to hold Captain Dwyer liable for other officers’ conduct based \n23  merely on the fact that he authorized use of the 37mm (or 40mm OC rounds), they cannot do so.  When \n24  Captain Dwyer gave his authorization for the use of particular crowd-control or PIW devices, he did so \n25  against the backdrop of clear SJPD policies prohibiting unreasonable force and delineating the \n26  appropriate circumstances for use of those devices.  And he did so only after it became clear police \n27  were faced with a hostile and violent unlawful assembly that had been commanded multiple times to \n28  disperse to no avail.  There is no basis in evidence for the inference that Captain Dwyer had reason to \n35 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 46 of 61\n \n1  think SJPD officers would use PIW to retaliate against protesters based on viewpoint or under \n2  circumstances where such force would be constitutionally unreasonable.  So his mere decision to \n3  permit the use of those PIW cannot have been tantamount to a conscious decision to allow violations of \n4  any Plaintiff’s constitutional rights, as necessary to show deliberate indifference.  See Terebesi v. \n5  Torresco, 764 F. 3d 217, 132 n.14 (2d Cir. 2014) (rejecting supervisor liability to “attach to any \n6  decision to deploy a tactical team” since it may be properly “properly activated for a number of \n7  reasons, some of which [may not be anticipated] in any single case”). \n8  The same goes for Captain Dwyer’s decision to have SJPD officers disperse the unlawful \n9  assembly from Cesar Chavez Park.  As with any other decision to cause or allow dispersal efforts, \n10  Captain Dwyer was not thereby authorizing unconstitutional conduct as part of those efforts.  On the \n11  contrary, Captain Dwyer had every reason to presume that subordinate police officers would follow \n12  SJPD policies and training by using only appropriate, non-retaliatory force.  So even if Plaintiffs could \n13  prove that a subordinate officer violated Swift or Allen’s (the two Plaintiffs who complain about force \n14  at the Park) rights in some respect, they cannot possibly show Captain Dwyer’s deliberate indifference \n15  was the actual and proximate cause for that violation.  Starr, 652 F.3d at 1207; L.W. v. Grubbs, 92 F.3d \n16  894, 899 (9th Cir. 1996) (holding that supervisors must have “recognized [an] unreasonable risk and \n17  actually intended to expose [plaintiffs] to such risks without regard to the consequences”) (cleaned up). \n18  3.  Lieutenant Brian Matchett \n19  Plaintiffs alleged that Lieutenant Matchett violated their rights “by approving the use of force to \n20  move the crowd, approving the use of chemical weapons and PIW at the demonstrations, and failing to \n21  provide adequate policies, training, supervision or command of the officers” at the protest.  FAC ¶ 32.  \n22  Plaintiffs do not explain when or in what way Lieutenant Matchett authorized any force at the protest, \n23  in what location this was undertaken, or in what way this caused a violation of any Plaintiff’s rights.  \n24  Indeed, Plaintiffs have confirmed through discovery that Lieutenant Matchett had no role at the protest \n25  in authorizing or using force against any Plaintiff.  E.g., Pritchard Dec., Ex. 4 38:14-19, 82:5-17.  \n26  Rather, he was simply a lieutenant helping to coordinate attendance among and inform different \n27  members of the teams under his supervision.  He therefore cannot have caused any constitutional \n28  violation against any Plaintiff, either intentionally or through deliberate indifference, and he is entitled \n36 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 47 of 61\n \n1  to judgment as a matter of law.   \n2  4.  Sergeant Lee Tassio \n3  Defendant Tassio was a sergeant who was deployed at the protest on May 29 and 30.  On May \n4  29, Sergeant Tassio oversaw some police officers who responded to the area of Santa Clara and Eighth \n5  Streets and created a police line.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 1 175:18-177:18.  Sergeant Tassio saw that as \n6  soon as police officers arrived at that area, the crowd of protesters that had been declared an unlawful \n7  assembly began to advance in the officers’ direction.  Id.  Officers then formed a line, and Sergeant \n8  Tassio witnessed the crowd throw a barrage of objects at police.  Id.  Sergeant Tassio was himself hit \n9  with bottles, rocks, pieces of wood, and other objects.  Id.  He was also aware that an officer on the line \n10  was knocked unconscious.  Id. 178:13-19.  Sergeant Tassio determined that the use of 37mm was \n11  necessary to protect the police officers on the line and cause the crowd to back up and disperse.  Id.  \n12  When Captain Dwyer gave authorization for the 37mm, Sergeant Tassio directed Officer Simonini and \n13  another subordinate to use their 37mm when there was sufficient distance with the crowd to do so \n14  safely and consistently with SJPD policies and training.  Id. 82:5-89:9, 103:03-110:02. \n15  Sergeant Tassio also coordinated the efforts of the police line to push the unlawful assembly \n16  back toward City Hall with the object of effecting dispersal.  Id. 177:15-178:19.  He believed that many \n17  in the unlawful assembly would have parked their cars near City Hall and reasoned that they might \n18  therefore disperse on their own once pushed there.  Id.  Sergeant Tassio remained with the line as it \n19  pushed the crowd west toward City Hall.  He later redeployed to the area of Plaza de Cesar Chavez \n20  Park, where the core of the unlawful assembly had relocated and continued to engage in violent and \n21  assaultive behavior towards officers, as well as starting fires in the park.  Id. 183:16-184:7, 205:14-\n22  207:15.  Sergeant Tassio helped to coordinate the police line as it advanced toward the park to effect \n23  dispersal.  Id.  While doing so, he witnessed Plaintiff Swift refusing to comply with multiple officer \n24  orders to move and tussling with officers on the line, to which officers responded by pushing Swift.  \n25  Neumer Dec., Ex. 11, 20:43:00-20:44:50.  Sergeant Tassio instructed officers to arrest Swift after \n26  witnessing her conduct.  He then proceeded with the line to continue dispersal of the Park.  Id. \n27  Only two Plaintiffs allege anything concerning supervisory liability against Sergeant Tassio: \n28  Swift and Allen.  Swift claims that Sergeant Tassio violated her rights by “order[ing]” officers to “yell \n37 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 48 of 61\n \n1  ‘Move’ . . . while simultaneously pushing” Swift with their batons.  FAC ¶ 99.  The record, however, is \n2  undisputed that Sergeant Tassio did not order police officers to use any force on Swift.  See Neumer \n3  Dec., Ex. 11, 20:43:00-20:44:50.  Rather, he coordinated the advance of multiple officers in the police \n4  line as it moved through the park, and the officers on that line pushed Swift when she failed to comply \n5  with their orders to move and get back.  See id.  Sergeant Tassio then ordered Swift arrested.  Id.  Even \n6  if the officers somehow violated Swift’s rights in pushing her, Sergeant Tassio did not specifically \n7  authorize, order, or set in motion any act he would have known to cause such a violation.  Swift’s \n8  supervisory liability claim against him therefore fails. \n9  As to Allen, he alleges that Sergeant Tassio ordered officers to “charge[]” demonstrators and \n10  throw flashbang or similar munitions at the crowd.  FAC ¶ 102.  Again, there is no basis for this \n11  allegation in the undisputed factual record.  Plaintiffs can point to no evidence that Tassio ordered, \n12  authorized, or caused in any way the force Allen alleges as unconstitutional, and the record shows he \n13  did not.  His claim against Sergeant Tassio therefore fails as well.  \n14  5.  Sergeant John Lynch \n15  Plaintiffs’ only allegations concerning Sergeant Lynch are that he was the supervisor of Officer \n16  Bill Nguyen, who Plaintiffs allege fired a projectile that struck Cuellar and Acosta.  The undisputed \n17  facts preclude Plaintiffs’ claim of supervisory liability based on Officer Nguyen’s alleged conduct.  \n18  First, when Acosta alleges a projectile struck him at 7:09 p.m. near the intersection of Santa Clara and \n19  Third Streets, FAC ¶ 91, Sergeant Lynch was in front of the Chevron gas station on Santa Clara and \n20  Fourth Streets.  Neumer Dec., Ex. 14, 19:07:45-19:09:30.  Camera footage of Sergeant Lynch \n21  throughout this time period show that he did not order, authorize, or even witness Officer Nguyen fire \n22  any projectile.  Id.  He was, rather, occupied the entire time interacting with drivers in the area and \n23  instructing them to leave.  Id.  Sergeant Lynch necessarily had nothing to do with the force that Acosta \n24  claims resulted in his injury.  He therefore could not have intentionally or through deliberate \n25  indifference of supervision violated Acosta’s rights. \n26  Second, because Plaintiffs have no evidence that Officer Nguyen fired the projectile that \n27  Cuellar claims hit her, so too they lack any evidence that Sergeant Lynch could have ordered, \n28  authorized, or otherwise caused the officer to fire a projectile at Cuellar in a way that violated her \n38 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 49 of 61\n \n1  rights.  Plaintiffs have pointed to no camera footage or other source of evidence in discovery to suggest \n2  Sergeant Lynch had anything to do with force used on Cuellar (by Officer Nguyen or any other \n3  officer).  Sergeant Lynch is therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law on both Acosta’s and \n4  Cuellar’s supervisory liability claims.   \n5  6.  Sergeant Ronnie Lopez \n6  Sergeant Lopez supervised a team of officers serving on the police line on May 29 and 30, \n7  which team included Officers Yuen and Situ.  His team was there to assist with moving the crowd and \n8  to effect arrests when possible and appropriate.  Plaintiffs Vasquez, Cañas, Acosta, and Allen assert \n9  First and Fourth Amendment claims against Sergeant Lopez derivatively by virtue of their claims \n10  against Officer Yuen.  FAC ¶ 34.   As shown, however, it is undisputed that Officer Yuen did not use \n11  force against Vasquez or Cañas.  Even if he had, Plaintiffs can point to no evidence that Sergeant \n12  Lopez ordered, authorized, or was present for any force Officer Yuen used against those Plaintiffs.   \n13  The same is true for Plaintiffs Acosta and Allen.  Sergeant Lopez did not direct Officer Yuen \n14  (or any other officer) to use his PIW in any instance but depended on officers following standard \n15  training and procedures regarding the use of those weapons.  Moreover, during the period when Acosta \n16  was struck with a projectile—at 7:09 p.m. on May 29—Sergeant Lopez was nowhere near Officer \n17  Yuen.  He (like Sergeant Lynch) was instead in the parking lot of a Chevron gas station and focused on \n18  clearing that area of people.  Neumer Dec., Ex. 15, 19:06:00-19:09:25.  And he testified that he had no \n19  awareness that a person was struck in the eye until well after the protest.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 23 \n20  103:17-22.  So it is impossible that Sergeant Lopez had anything to do with Officer Yuen’s alleged \n21  firing of a projectile that struck Acosta.   \n22  Likewise with Allen, the only force alleged against Officer Yuen is that the officer pushed him \n23  while moving with the police line into the park.  But there is no evidence to suggest Sergeant Lopez \n24  ordered Officer Yuen to push Allen, authorized that particular act, or even saw it when it happened.  \n25  Indeed, when shown footage of Officer Yuen pushing Allen, Sergeant Lopez testified he had no \n26  memory of seeing Allen being pushed.  Id. 119:16-23, 122:10-17.  \n27  Finally, Plaintiff Naemeh’s claim against Sergeant Lopez is based on his allegation that Officer \n28  Situ’s used excessive or retaliatory force in pushing him to the ground during his arrest.  Once again, \n39 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 50 of 61\n \n1  Plaintiffs have no evidence that Sergeant Lopez ordered Officer Situ to use any force as part of his \n2  arrest, must less that he prescribed the particular force the officer used.  On the contrary, Sergeant \n3  Lopez was overseeing an entire team involved in effecting arrests of multiple people in the area where \n4  Naemeh was pushed and certainly did not focus his attention on any one of those officers.   \n5  Sergeant Lopez did nothing to cause excessive force or retaliation by Officers Yuen or Situ.  He \n6  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiffs’ supervisory liability claims. \n7  7.  Lieutenant Steven Lagorio \n8  Plaintiff Maldonado complains that he was subjected to teargas on May 29.  Maldonado does \n9  not know who threw the cannister (if any) that released the teargas near enough to him that he was \n10  affected by it, meaning that it could have been an SJPD officer, an officer with another agency, or a \n11  member of the crowed (as it was common during the protest that protesters threw teargas cannisters \n12  back in the direction of police and sometimes caused the gas to release right next to other protesters).  \n13  E.g., Neumer Dec., Ex. 16, 18:33:40-18:33:55.  Maldonado did not see any police officer throw teargas \n14  in his direction, and he does not even know from which direction the teargas—before wafting toward \n15  him from a significant distance—originated.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 24 51:18-52:3; 126:21-127:14; id. Ex. \n16  36.  Plainly he cannot make out a valid excessive force or retaliatory claim against any SJPD officer, \n17  precluding any derivative such claim against Lieutenant Lagorio. See also Quraishi v. St. Charles \n18  County, 986 F.3d 831, 834 (8th Cir. 2021) (holding use of teargas is not as seizure). \n19  In any event, Plaintiffs have no basis for the assertion that Lieutenant Lagorio had anything to \n20  do with the particular teargas cannister that Maldonado claims affected him.  Officers were trained, \n21  following the authorization by Assistant Chief Knopf permitting teargas, to use the gas when \n22  appropriate without further direction from any superior officer.  Plaintiffs have no evidence to suggest \n23  Lieutenant Lagorio ordered the use of teargas that purportedly affected Maldonado, much less that he \n24  did so under circumstances evincing knowledge or deliberate indifference that it would be used \n25  excessively or as retaliation for expressive activity.  Plaintiff Maldonado’s First and Fourth \n26  Amendment claims against Lieutenant Lagorio therefore fail on the undisputed facts.   \n27  D.  Plaintiffs’ failure-to-intervene claim against all Defendants is not cognizable \n28  Plaintiffs’ FAC asserts a standalone claim for “failure to intervene” against all Defendants.  \n40 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 51 of 61\n \n1  This undifferentiated claim is meritless.  For one thing, the theory that a police officer can be held \n2  liable for another officer’s constitutional torts is not viable outside the custodial context.  In the case \n3  giving rise to the “failure to intervene” theory of constitutional liability, United States v. Koon, 34 F.3d \n4  1416, 1447 (9th Cir. 1994), the court considered only the claim that police officers failed to protect an \n5  inmate from harm while he was incarcerated.  In the dicta of a footnote, the court also mentioned a \n6  separate line of case law recognizing a duty to intervene in other contexts, Id. 1447 n.25, but that case \n7  law all predated the Supreme Court’s watershed decision in Deshaney v. Winnebago County, 489 U.S. \n8  189, 196 (1989), holding that there can never be constitutional liability based on the failure of state \n9  agents to protect a person from harm.  Thus, since Koons (and Deshaney), the Ninth Circuit has never \n10  in a published decision found a police officer liable under a “failure to intervene” theory outside the \n11  custodial context.  It follows that Plaintiffs’ failure-to-intervene theory of supervisory or officer \n12  liability was not clearly established at the time of the events at issue.  See Penaloza v. City of Rialto, \n13  836 F. App’x 547, 549 (9th Cir. 2020) (holding that Ninth Circuit case law “does not clearly establish \n14  when an officer must intervene,” thus mandating qualified immunity for “failure to intervene” claims). \n15  Finally, even if such a theory were viable, a plaintiff can only establish such liability where the \n16  defendant establishes that there was an ongoing constitutional violation that the defendant officer was \n17  witnessing and that the officer had a “realistic opportunity” to intercede.  Cunningham v. Gates, 229 \n18  F.3d 1271, 1289 (9th Cir. 2000).  This will never be true where the alleged constitutional violation \n19  happened within “a matter of seconds,” as is the case with every alleged violation here.  Cortesluna v. \n20  Leon, 979 F.3d 645, 656 (9th Cir. 2020) (“[T]here is no evidence that [the defendant] knew what the \n21  other [officers] would do, and the events unfolded very rapidly—in a matter of seconds.”).  Plaintiffs \n22  can point to no evidence that any Defendant was (1) in the immediate vicinity of any other officer’s \n23  allegedly unconstitutional act; (2) had an opportunity not only to recognize that the officer was going to \n24  act suddenly but also the knowledge that the act was unconstitutional; and then (3) had the opportunity \n25  or ability to stop that unconstitutional act.  Their failure-to-train claims all fail as a matter of law.   \n26  II.  The City is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiffs’ § 1983 claims \n27  A municipal entity cannot be sued as a “person” under § 1983 unless an “official municipal \n28  policy of some nature caused a constitutional tort.”  Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs. of City of New York, \n41 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 52 of 61\n \n1  436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978).  This means that “a municipality cannot be made liable by application of the \n2  doctrine of respondeat superior” for the constitutional violations of its employees.  Pembaur v. City of \n3  Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 478 (1986).  Rather, a plaintiff must show that the municipality itself caused \n4  a constitutional violation through a policy set by its “properly constituted legislative body” or by \n5  “officials whose acts or edicts may fairly be said to represent official policy.”  See Id. 480 (internal \n6  quotations omitted).  “A ‘policy’ consists of a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision \n7  officially adopted and promulgated by [the city’s policymaking] officers.”  Lozano v. Cty. of Santa \n8  Clara, No. 19-CV-02634, 2019 WL 6841215, at *17 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 16, 2019).   \n9    Plaintiffs’ theory of Monell liability here is that the City can be held liable for its employees’ \n10  alleged violations of the First and Fourth Amendments during the course of a single event—i.e., the \n11  George Floyd protest and accompanying riots over the course of May 29 (and in the case of one \n12  Plaintiff, May 30).   Plaintiffs must therefore prove (1) that a San Jose police officer unlawfully \n13  retaliated against them and used excessive force; and (2) that an official City of San Jose policy caused \n14  each of those constitutional violations.  See Jackson v. City of Bremerton, 268 F.3d 646, 653 (9th Cir. \n15  2001).  As established, supra Factual Background Section I, Plaintiffs cannot on this record prove that \n16  any SJPD officer violated their First and Fourth Amendment rights, so their Monell claim fails at the \n17  outset.  The claim fails for the additional reason that the City of San Jose had no official policy before \n18  May 29, 2020 to cause or allow excessive force or speech-based retaliation by law enforcement.   \n19  A.  The City had no express policy to cause or allow unlawful retaliation or excessive force \n20    Plaintiffs do not appear to challenge any formal or express San Jose policy.  Nor could they.  \n21  The SJPD’s explicit policies and training were exactly contrary to what Plaintiffs allege in their \n22  complaint.  Those policies prohibited excessive force and viewpoint discrimination or retaliation.  The \n23  City’s policies were also that PIW could only be used by trained officers and only under limited \n24  conditions.  Thus, for the 37mm, SJPD policy was that they could only be used to effect dispersal of a \n25  violent crowd following an unlawful assembly declaration, and even then only through indirect \n26  projectiles that skip-fired small foam discs off the ground at a sufficiently safe distance.  And SJPD \n27  policy was further to train any police officer who used the 37mm in exactly these methods.  Likewise, \n28  for the 40mm, SJPD policy was that their use was prohibited except by trained officers, and even then \n42 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 53 of 61\n \n1  only to target suspects who presented a direct threat of serious injury, such as when members of the \n2  violent unlawful assembly were assaulting police officers.  Indeed, every officer who used PIW at the \n3  protest testified that these were SJPD’s policies.   \n4  These are undisputed facts, and there is nothing in this record of any other SJPD policy that \n5  could have caused constitutional violations of the sort Plaintiffs claim.  Plaintiffs allege in their FAC \n6  that SJPD adopted official policies “to allow use of additional chemical agent devices and . . . impact \n7  munitions that it had previously prohibited in crowd control situations,” FAC ¶ 179, but it is unclear to \n8  what they could be referring.  The violations Plaintiffs claim in this case are in Defendants’ use of \n9  37mm as a dispersal weapon and the 40mm as a direct targeting device (along with Maldonado’s claim \n10  related to teargas).  Nothing about the use of those tools Plaintiffs complain about here was changed \n11  anytime before the George Floyd protest, and Plaintiffs do not claim otherwise.  Although SJPD altered \n12  the language of its DM regarding the use of OC powder during crowd-control events (presumably what \n13  Plaintiffs mean to reference in their allegations), see Tassio Dec., Ex. 2, no Plaintiff is claiming a \n14  constitutional violation based on OC powder.  So that language change is irrelevant.   \n15    In any event, it would not matter if SJPD policies were changed at some point before the \n16  George Floyd protest to permit the use of any particular “chemical agent” or impact munition,” because \n17  Plaintiffs do not—and cannot—argue that the mere equipping of officers with any munition police used \n18  in this case amounted to a constitutional violation in itself.  In other words, Plaintiffs do not claim that \n19  every use of a 37mm or 40mm during a protest or riot would amount to excessive force or unlawful \n20  speech-based retaliation.  That claim would plainly fail, as PIW (like guns or any other force) can be \n21  used both constitutionally and unconstitutionally depending on the intent of or circumstances known to \n22  a police officer.  Rather, Plaintiffs’ argument is one of omission: they fault SJPD for its alleged failure \n23  to prevent constitutional violations by officers using PIW.  As can best be determined, Plaintiffs \n24  advance two theories in support of this argument: (1) that the City’s training and supervision program \n25  was constitutionally deficient; and (2) that the City had a longstanding custom and practice of allowing \n26  viewpoint discrimination and excessive force.  See FAC ¶¶ 178-183.  Neither theory has merit. \n27  B.  The City did not have unconstitutional training and supervision policies \n28  The theory that a city’s inadequate training or supervision of employees led to a constitutional \n43 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 54 of 61\n \n1  violation is generally indistinguishable from respondeat superior liability, which Monell and its \n2  progeny prohibit.  See City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 392 (1989) (observing that, absent \n3  heightened culpability and causation proofs, imposing city liability for omissions “would result in de \n4  facto respondeat superior liability on municipalities”).  “After all, when a municipal employee \n5  commits a constitutional tort, it could always be alleged that the municipality failed to enact a policy \n6  that would have prevented the tort.”  Tsao v. Desert Palace, Inc., 698 F.3d 1128, 1143–44 (9th Cir. \n7  2012).  Failure-to-train or -supervise claims are therefore the “most tenuous” of Monell theories.  \n8  Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51, 61 (2011).  They are only cognizable “in [the] limited \n9  circumstance[]” where policymaking officials’ “deliberate indifference to [constitutional] rights” \n10  caused the claimed violation.  Id. at 61.   \n11  “Deliberate indifference is a stringent standard of fault, requiring proof that a municipal actor \n12  disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his action.”  Id. (cleaned up).  To state a claim under \n13  this standard, a plaintiff must allege facts showing the city’s final policymakers were on “notice that \n14  [the city’s] omission would likely result in a constitutional violation” and made the “deliberate or \n15  conscious choice to countenance the possibility of [that] violation.”  Tsao, 698 F.3d at 1143–44.  “A \n16  pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained employees is ordinarily necessary to \n17  demonstrate deliberate indifference,” because without the notice that pattern provides the city’s \n18  “decisionmakers can hardly be said to have deliberately chosen a [training or supervision] program that \n19  will cause [such] violations.”  Connick, 563 U.S. at 62.  The exception is the “rare” case where the need \n20  for a particular training or supervision program is “so patently obvious” that the failure to institute it \n21  can evince deliberate indifference even without a prior pattern of violations.  Id. at 64. \n22    Plaintiffs’ failure-to-train/supervise theory fails on all these elements.  First, Plaintiffs have no \n23  evidence of a history in San Jose of police officers engaging in unlawful speech-based retaliation or \n24  excessive force against protesters.  Indeed, Plaintiffs have not identified a single past instance in which \n25  SJPD officers have committed those constitutional violations during a protest, despite being asked to \n26  do so specifically in discovery.  E.g., Pritchard Dec., Ex. 28 (failing to identify any instance before the \n27  George Floyd protest in which an SJPD officer violated a person’s “constitutional right at any protest” \n28  or other “expressive event”).  Plaintiffs therefore cannot prove a prior “pattern of similar constitutional \n44 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 55 of 61\n \n1  violations” as necessary to demonstrate deliberate indifference.  See Connick, 563 U.S. at 62.    \n2    Nor is this one of the “rare” cases in which the City’s final policymakers can be charged with \n3  deliberate indifference even in the absence of any prior pattern of violations to put them on notice of a \n4  training/supervision policy deficiency.  Id. 64.  Before May 29, 2020, SJPD policies and practices \n5  regarding officer training in the use of PIW and crowd control were robust and exceeded the \n6  requirements of California state law in multiple respects.  Supra Sections I & II.  The SJPD’s policy \n7  manual outlined with specificity when and how PIW, batons, or other force could be used; different \n8  crowd-control devices and the restrictions on them; and the significant First Amendment considerations \n9  governing protests and expressive activity.  Id.  For years before May 2020, officers with SJPD have \n10  been trained in crowd control, including annual six-to-eight-hour trainings since at least 2016 in which \n11  all Special Operations officers—the officers most significantly involved in crowd-control events—\n12  cover topics on the First Amendment, the role of legal observers, proper arrest techniques, the use of \n13  PIW, and general crowd-control tactics.  Tassio Dec. ¶¶ 2-23.  This training has included instruction \n14  and practice on the use of 40mm since at least 2016 and 37mm since at least 2017.  Id. ¶¶ 13, 15. The  \n15  SJPD even provided an additional specific training video to every police officer (which video was also \n16  reviewed in briefings) regarding the use of 40mm PIW.  Sciba Dec. ¶11. And all of this training is in \n17  addition to the significant training required of every SJPD officer, including specific training on crowd-\n18  control and ongoing training regarding the use of batons, PIW, and other force options.  Id.  It is no \n19  wonder, given these extensive and longstanding training and supervision policies, that Plaintiffs can \n20  point to no prior constitutional violations in the protest context. \n21    It would be unprecedented, and in contravention of all applicable legal standards, to find \n22  deliberate indifference on this record.  It could not have been obvious to City policymakers, much less \n23  “so patently obvious” as to dispense with all notice requirements, that SJPD’s considerable training and \n24  supervision program was so deficient that SJPD officers would invariably violate the Constitution in \n25  providing crowd control in response to a massive protest event like the George Floyd protest.  Connick, \n26  563 U.S. at 64.  Because neither a prior pattern nor a patently obvious deficiency put any City \n27  policymaker on notice before May 2020 that SJPD’s training and supervision program was so lacking \n28  that it would cause unlawful retaliation and excessive force, Plaintiffs cannot prove a Monell violation \n45 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 56 of 61\n \n1  based on this “most tenuous” of theories.  Id. at 61. \n2  C.  The City did not have a custom and practice of unlawful retaliation or excessive force \n3    “To prevail on” their theory that the City had a custom and practice of promoting, causing, or \n4  allowing excessive force and unlawful retaliation against protesters, Plaintiffs must prove “the \n5  existence of a widespread practice” in San Jose that “is so permanent and well settled as to constitute a \n6  ‘custom or usage’ with the force of law.’”  Gillette v. Delmore, 979 F.2d 1342, 1348 (9th Cir. 1992).  \n7  As with a failure-to-train theory, this significant showing generally requires proof “of repeated \n8  constitutional violations” over a sufficiently long period “for which the errant municipal officials were \n9  not discharged or reprimanded.”  Id.; see also Trevino v. Gates, 99 F.3d 911, 918 (9th Cir. 1996) \n10  (“Liability for improper custom . . . must be founded upon practices of sufficient duration, frequency \n11  and consistency that the conduct has become a traditional method of carrying out policy” in the city).   \n12    Because Plaintiffs have no evidence of a single prior instance in which SJPD officers have \n13  engaged in unlawful speech-based retaliation or excessive force against protesters, it follows that they \n14  cannot prove a “permanent and well settled” custom in SJPD of such misconduct.  Gillette, 979 F.2d at \n15  1348.  Their longstanding custom-and-practice theory thus fails. \n16  III.  The City is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Cartwright’s disability claims \n17  Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) prohibits governments from \n18  discriminating against persons with disabilities by “exclud[ing]” them from participation in \n19  government “programs, services, or activities.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132 (1990).  The Rehabilitation Act \n20  (“RA”) does the same thing with regard to “any program or activity receiving Federal financial \n21  assistance.”  29 U.S.C. 794 (2016).  “There is no significant difference in analysis” between the ADA \n22  and RA.  Zukle v. Regents of Univ. of California, 166 F.3d 1041, 1045, n.11 (9th Cir. 1999).   \n23  A plaintiff relying on a “reasonable accommodation” theory of ADA/RA liability “bears the \n24  initial burden of . . . proving, that a reasonable accommodation exists.”  Hui Jie Jin v. Alameda Cty., \n25  No. 18-CV-04885, 2019 WL 7831143, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 4, 2019).  The plaintiff must further show \n26  the alleged failure to accommodate “caused her to suffer greater injury or indignity than others” who \n27  are not disabled.  Juricich v. Cty. of San Mateo, No. 19-CV-06413, 2020 WL 619840, at *6 (N.D. Cal. \n28  Feb. 10, 2020).  And where (as here) the plaintiff seeks damages, she must allege facts establishing not \n46 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 57 of 61\n \n1  just a failure to accommodate but “intentional discrimination on the part of the defendant” officers.  \n2  Hall v. City of Walnut Creek, No. C-19-05716, 2020 WL 408989, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 24, 2020).  The \n3  Ninth Circuit has held that Title II can require accommodation during arrests, but as with any other \n4  ADA claim, the accommodation must be reasonable under the circumstances, meaning that it cannot \n5  interfere with the ordinary function of law enforcement.  See Sheehan v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, \n6  743 F.3d 1211 (9th Cir. 2014).   \n7  The only Plaintiff claiming violation of the ADA or RA here is Cartwright.  Cartwright claims \n8  she suffered from a disability in the form of a brain condition called trigeminal neuralgia, and that she \n9  had an implant in her chest as a result. She also claims arthritis in her knee, though that is not a \n10  qualifying disability.  E.g., Kelly v. Drexel Univ., 94 F.3d 102, 107 (3d Cir. 1996); Moore v. J.B. Hunt \n11  Transp., 221 F.3d 944, 951 (7th Cir. 2000).  Plaintiffs appear to argue that the City violated the ADA \n12  and RA because, after telling Cartwright to move repeatedly, an SJPD officer pushed her back several \n13  times, which caused her to have the battery in her implant checked by medical personnel a week later.  \n14  On May 29, Cartwright attended the protest downtown, where she hoped the crowd would be \n15  large.  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 25 99:7-18, 114:18-23.  She did not have any concern about attending a \n16  protest with a large crowd, despite any physical limitation she might have.  Id. 100:8-10.  She believed \n17  staying to the side of large crowds sufficiently accounted for any lack of mobility.  Id. 102:17-103:13.  \n18  While at the protest, Cartwright heard the police issue dispersal orders but disobeyed them because she \n19  thought it was important to stay and observe events.  Id. 145:4-22, 155:3-16.  After these orders, and \n20  after seeing officers use force against the unlawful assembly around her, Cartwright approached a \n21  police line near Sixth Street, next to City Hall.  Id. 158:9-24.  As she was standing there, several police \n22  officers in front of her started advancing as a line, yelling “get back!” and “back!” to Cartwright and \n23  others in the area.  Neumer Dec., Ex. 17, 18:02:00-18:02:23 (Cartwright in maroon shirt with purple \n24  hair).  Others moved back, but Cartwright did not.  Id.  She instead started to shout at the closest \n25  officer.  Id.  Nothing prevented Cartwright from moving when officers ordered her to, but she intended \n26  to stay and observe regardless of officers’ orders.  Id.; Pritchard Dec., Ex. 25 167:12-24.  \n27  The officer near Cartwright then pushed her right shoulder while continuing to order her back.  \n28  Neumer Dec., Ex. 17, 18:02:00-18:02:23.  Cartwright responded not by leaving but by yelling at the \n47 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 58 of 61\n \n1  officer and saying she had a brain injury.  Id.  Cartwright said nothing about any implant or other \n2  concern, and again, nothing prevented her from walking away after the officer pushed her.  Id.; \n3  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 25 171:21-172:25.  She remained because she wanted to stay and “observe,” and \n4  because she was “full of adrenaline.”  Id.  The officer pushed Cartwright again while ordering her back.  \n5  Neumer Dec., Ex. 17, 18:02:00-18:02:23.  Cartwright again refused to leave because she “thought it \n6  was important for [her] to stay there.”   Pritchard Dec., Ex. 25 176:13-23.  The officer pushed \n7  Cartwright a third time, after which she finally complied with his commands and left.  Neumer Dec., \n8  Ex. 17, 18:02:00-18:02:23.  Plaintiffs claim on the basis of this event that the City failed to \n9  accommodate Cartwright by pushing her and “mist[aking] [her] inaction, delayed action, or slowed \n10  action in response to [officer orders] as a refusal to comply.”  FAC ¶ 241. \n11    That is false—by her own testimony, Cartwright’s “inaction” explicitly was a refusal to comply, \n12  and nothing preventing her from leaving when ordered—and the undisputed facts preclude \n13  Cartwright’s ADA/RA claims, for multiple reasons.  First, Cartwright’s condition does not affect her \n14  ability to hear or understand officer orders, such as “get back!”  Pritchard Dec., Ex. 25 69:9-15.  Her \n15  refusal to move when officers ordered her back thus has nothing to do with any qualifying disability.   \n16  Second, Plaintiffs have identified no reasonable accommodation that the City failed to provide \n17  Cartwright on account of a qualifying disability.  Nor is there any such.  For one thing, an officer \n18  cannot provide an accommodation that is not requested.  Cartwright did not ask for accommodation or \n19  tell police officers she had a device in her chest that might be disrupted if pushed.  Her mere utterance \n20  about an unspecified brain injury in the middle of a chaotic and noisy crowd-control situation cannot \n21  have alerted the City to a disability in need of accommodation.  In any event, Plaintiffs’ apparent \n22  argument that police were required to allow Cartwright to disobey officer orders or to hold up an entire \n23  police line as an “accommodation” is meritless.  Police officers need not, under the ADA, immediately \n24  halt crowd-control efforts against a defiant member of an unlawful assembly simply because that \n25  person claims some vague injury.  It is unclear what such an accommodation would even look like.  \n26  Hence Cartwright’s admission during deposition, after being given the opportunity to define a needed \n27  accommodation, that officers “maybe” did not fail to accommodate her disability.  Id. 186:2-190:4.  \n28  Plaintiffs cannot meet their burden of proving a reasonable accommodation existed. \n48 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 59 of 61\n \n1    Third, Plaintiffs cannot show Cartwright suffered an injury different from any other non-\n2  disabled person (or any injury at all).  Cartwright’s implant device was unaffected by her experience, \n3  and she continued attending the protest for multiple days afterward.  Id. 190:6-193:20, 83:24-84:11.  \n4  Fourth, Cartwright cannot prove that the officer who pushed her while enforcing an order to move \n5  “intentionally discriminated” against her.  There is no factual basis for proving such discriminatory \n6  intent; on the contrary, the only possible inference from the undisputed facts is that the officer was \n7  merely engaging in crowd-control efforts, as he would with any other defiant member of the crowd.   \n8    Finally, if the ADA applied to impose such onerous requirements on municipal law \n9  enforcement, it would violate the federalism principles of the Tenth Amendment.  See Bd. of Trustees \n10  of Univ. of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 366 (2001); Chadam v. Palo Alto Unified Sch. Dist., No. \n11  13cv4129, 2014 WL 325323 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 29, 2014).  And Plaintiffs have taken no discovery and \n12  have no other factual basis for their assertion that SJPD receives federal financial assistance, which \n13  precludes their RA claim.  See Sharer v. Oregon, 581 F.3d 1176, 1180 (9th Cir. 2009). \n14  IV.  Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiff’s state-law claims \n15  Plaintiffs’ state-law claims rely on the same allegations and theories of liability as in their \n16  federal claims under § 1983 and fail for the same reasons.  See Reese v. County of Sacramento, 888 \n17  F.3d 1030, 1045 (9th Cir. 2018) (Bane Act and excessive force are coextensive except insofar as the \n18  former also requires a showing of specific intent); Campbell v. Feld Entm’t, Inc., 75 F.Supp.3d 1193, \n19  1205 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (Ralph Act requires invidious viewpoint animus); J.P. v. City of Porterville, 801 \n20  F. Supp. 2d 965, 990 (E.D. Cal. 2011) (“Battery is a state law tort counterpart to [an] excessive force \n21  claim.”); FAC ¶¶ 281-283 (alleging same facts between same plaintiffs and defendants in negligence \n22  and Fourth Amendment claims).  The claims fail for several additional reasons as well.  \n23  First, for their Bane Act claims, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that Defendants had “a specific \n24  intent to violate [his] right to freedom from unreasonable seizure.”  Reese, 888 F.3d at 1043. This \n25  means that Plaintiffs must show the officers “intended not only the force, but its unreasonableness.”  Id. \n26  1045.  The “mere intention to use force that [is found to be] unreasonable . . . is insufficient.” Id.  \n27  Plaintiffs can cite no evidence to show this specific intent here.  Even if they could establish that force \n28  in some instance was unreasonable, there is nothing about the circumstances to suggest any Defendant \n49 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 60 of 61\n \n1  specifically intended the unreasonable character of the force.  See id.; Smith v. County of Santa Cruz, \n2  No. 17-CV-05095, 2019 WL 2515841, at *14 (N.D. Cal. June 17, 2019) (“[S]imply showing that an \n3  officer’s conduct amounts to a constitutional violation under an ‘objectively reasonable’ standard is \n4  insufficient to satisfy the additional intent requirement under the Bane Act.”).  \n5  Second, for their Ralph Act claims, Plaintiffs must prove “Defendants committed or threatened \n6  violent acts against [them]” because of their “political affiliation” or some similar trait.  Campbell v. \n7  Feld Ent., Inc., 75 F. Supp. 3d 1193, 1205 (N.D. Cal. 2014).  Plaintiffs can point to no evidence that \n8  any Defendant discriminated against them because of political affiliation.  Merely alleging unlawful \n9  force at a protest does not qualify.  E.g., Bolbol v. City of Daly City, 754 F. Supp. 2d 1095, 1117 (N.D. \n10  Cal. 2010) (granting summary judgment on Ralph Act claim where officer held an activist’s hand in a \n11  pain-compliance hold for approximately 15-20 minutes”). \n12  Finally, California immunity provisions also bar Plaintiffs’ claims.  “California’s common law \n13  has long provided personal immunity from lawsuits challenging a governmental official’s discretionary \n14  acts within the scope of his or her authority.”  Conway v. Cty. of Tuolumne, 231 Cal. App. 4th 1005, \n15  1014 (Cal. Ct. App. 2014).  This immunity extends to decisions by police officials about how best to \n16  fulfill government’s law-enforcement function in a given case, including the decision by police \n17  authorities to use tear gas.  See id.  Like the use of tear gas to effect arrest, the decision by police \n18  officers to use one particular crowd-control tactic—i.e., PIW to disperse a crowd—is a discretionary \n19  act that entails significant law enforcement judgment and expertise.  It is therefore protected by \n20  discretionary-act immunity.  See Id. 1017–18.  Additionally under California law, an officer’s use of \n21  force against a person who is part of an unlawful assembly is a privileged act and is thus not amenable \n22  to tort liability.  See Gilmore v. Superior Ct., 230 Cal. App. 3d 416, 421 (Ct. App. 1991) (“A privileged \n23  act is by definition one for which the actor is absolved of any tort liability, whether premised on the \n24  theory of negligence or of intent.”); Restatement 2d of Torts § 141 (1965) (“[A] peace officer . . . is \n25  privileged to use force against another . . . for the purpose of terminating or preventing the reviewal of \n26  an affray or an equally serious breach of the peace . . . .”). \n27  Conclusion \n28    Defendants respectfully request that the Court grant them summary judgment.  \n50 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 121   Filed 04/14/23   Page 61 of 61\n \n1   \n2     \n3   \n4   \n    Respectfully submitted, \n5 \nNORA FRIMANN, City Attorney \n6  Dated:  April 14, 2023 \n \n7 \n \n \n8 \nBy: ___ /s/Matthew Pritchard   \n              MATTHEW PRITCHARD \n9 \n              Sr. Deputy City Attorney  \n \n10 \nAttorneys for Defendants \n \n11 \n \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n51 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT    21-cv-01705-PJH \n2009333_2 \n ",

INTRODUCTION \n \n1  1.  Black people have been hunted, brutalized and killed by the police since the \n2  inception of law enforcement in the United States, including a demonstrable history of \n3  violence in San José. This action arises out of protests across the nation in response to \n4  the May 25, 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police Department officers. \n5  Floyd’s death, so soon after law enforcement killed Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud \n6  Arbery, mobilized millions of people around the country to condemn the deaths of \nBlack and Brown people by law enforcement in one of the largest social justice \n7 \nmovements in U.S. history.1  \n8 \n2.  In San José, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets on May 29, 2020, and \n9 \nfor several days thereafter, to express their view that police brutality and \n10 \ninstitutionalized racism must end. But the demonstrators were met with brutal and \n11 \nracially targeted repression by defendant CITY OF SAN JOSÉ.  \n12 \n3.  This is a civil rights action for damages, injunctive and declaratory relief arising \n13 \nfrom unconstitutional CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police’s violence and arrests of \n14 \ndemonstrators on May 29-31, 2020. Named plaintiffs M. MICHAEL ACOSTA (suing \n15 \nas an individual), and JOSEPH CAÑAS, LESLIE VASQUEZ, PETER ALLEN, \n16 \nSHAUNN CARTWRIGHT, YESSICA RILES, JOSÉ GUSTAVO FLORES \n17 \nRODRIGUEZ, ALEX LEE, JOSÉPH MALDONADO, CINDY CUELLAR, \n18 \nMAHMOUDREZA NAEMEH, AND MEGAN SWIFT (suing as individuals and class \n19 \nrepresentatives) seek redress for the violation of their constitutional rights to assemble, \n20 \nprotest, and be free from racial discrimination, disability discrimination, excessive \n21 \nforce, and wrongful arrest. Organization plaintiffs NAACP OF SAN JOSÉ / SILICON \n22 \nVALLEY and SAN JOSÉ PEACE AND JUSTICE CENTER, along with all of the \n23 \nindividual plaintiffs, seek prospective and declaratory relief to ensure the right to \n24 \nexpress viewpoints critical of the police or government in San José without fear of \n25 \n \n26 \n \n27  1Larry Buchanan, Quoctrung Bui, and Jugal K. Patel, Black Lives Matter May Be the Largest Movement in \nU.S. History, N.Y. Times (Jul. 3, 2020), https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-\n28  protests-crowd-size.html. \n \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 2 \n \n\n \n \n \nviolent repression or wrongful arrest. \n4.  Starting on May 29, 2020, and continuing during the demonstrations on May 30, \n1 \n31, and thereafter, the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police fired impact munitions into the \n2 \nbodies of unarmed, predominately peaceful demonstrators, observers and journalists \n3 \nwithout justification; threw explosive flash-bang and “stinger” grenades at them; \n4 \nattacked them with chemical weapons; and beat them with hands and batons.  \n5 \n5.  Impact munitions are widely known to cause serious harm. These munitions, \n6 \nalso known as Projectile Impact Weapons (PIW), Specialty Impact Munitions (SIM), or \n7 \nKinetic Impact Projectiles (KIP), can cause fractures, serious organ injuries, and death, \n8 \nespecially when the point of impact is the head, neck, or torso.2 Two of the plaintiffs in \n9 \nthis case were struck in the eye: plaintiff M. MICHAEL ACOSTA lost his eye entirely, \n10 \nand plaintiff JOSEPH CAÑAS sustained permanent vision impairment. Police also shot \n11 \nseveral plaintiffs with impact munitions in the groin area. The groin is another area \n12 \nwhere impact munitions can cause serious injuries or death if shot into.3  \n13 \n6.  The CITY and its Police Department failed to establish policies to mitigate the \n14 \nrisk of harm from impact munitions, were intentionally indifferent to the risk of these \n15 \nharms, and caused Plaintiffs’ injuries. Indeed, the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ has admitted \n16 \nthat “[c]rowd control training has been minimal and infrequent” and that most of the \n17 \ncommanders and officers assigned to the events at issue in this case were not trained \n18 \nadequately.4 \n19 \n7.  The CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police have a long history of targeting Black, Brown, \n20 \nand Muslim communities, or people who they perceive as such, for racially \n21 \ndiscriminatory policing, and unreasonable force.

Defendants CITY OF SAN JOSÉ, SAM LICCARDO, EDGARDO GARCIA, \n6 \nDAVID SYKES, and DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ officials violated the plaintiffs’ \n7 \nconstitutional rights by maintaining customs, policies and/or practices which would \n8 \nforeseeably result in constitutional violations such as those suffered by the plaintiffs, \n9 \nand/or by their deliberate indifference in the hiring, training, supervision and discipline \n10 \nof CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers involved in the May 29 – June 7, 2020 \n11 \noperations. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that Defendants \n12 \nencouraged, tacitly authorized, and/or condoned unlawful customs, policies and/or \n13 \npractices: the use of excessive force; the failure to report the use of excessive force; the \n14 \nfailure to hold officers and supervisors accountable for the use of excessive force; the \n15 \nfailure to enforce policies which were intended to prevent the use of excessive force on \n16 \ncivilians and the violation of their rights to free speech, freedom of association and \n17 \nfreedom of the press by CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers during demonstrations; \n18 \nfiring chemical agents and impact munitions at non-violent persons; wrongful arrests \n19 \nwithout probable cause; the failure to hold officers and supervisors responsible for \n20 \nwrongful arrests; the racial and religious profiling of perceived Muslims and Black, \n21 \nIndigenous and people of color by CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers; the failure to \n22  hold officers and supervisors accountable for racial profiling; the failure to enforce \n23  policies which were intended to prevent racial and religious profiling by CITY OF SAN \n24  JOSÉ Police Officers; and/or other unlawful customs, policies and/or practices. \n25  9.  The CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Department’s mass use of excessive force \n26  engulfed downtown San José in toxic chemical agents and caused chaos and panic as \n27  police discharged explosive Flashbang and Stinger grenades into the crowd, shot people \n28  with impact munitions, and used clubs and hands to beat demonstrators and push them \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 4 \n \n\n \n \n \nto the ground. The burden of these brutal tactics fell disproportionately on \ndemonstrators and observers with disabilities, who receive little or no notice or \n1 \nopportunity to comply with any police orders before the police subjected them to \n2 \nexcessive force. In fact, demonstrators and observers were brutalized even as they \n3 \ninformed officers of their disabilities and attempted to comply with police instructions. \n4 \nII.

Plaintiff NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF \n25  COLORED PEOPLE OF SAN JOSÉ/ SILICON VALLEY (hereafter, NAACP) is a \n26  501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that works on issues related to equal access to education, \n27  voter empowerment, criminal justice, police misconduct, health equity, and economic \n28  growth for People of Color. The NAACP’s mission is to secure the political, educational, \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 5 \n \n\n \n \n \nsocial, and economic equality of rights in order to eliminate race-based discrimination \nand ensure the health and well-being of all persons. NAACP’s constituents engage in \n1 \npublic protest in San José on the issues NAACP is concerned about, including \n2 \ninstitutional racism and police brutality, and wish to continue to do so in the future, but \n3 \nthey are not able to participate in public protests in San José without fear of unlawful, \n4 \nracially discriminatory policing, excessive force, and arrest without probable cause. \n5 \nDefendants’ actions interfered with the NAACP’s constituents’ rights to assembly and \n6 \nspeech. NAACP plans to assist in and participate in similar events to the late May – early \n7 \nJune, 2020, protests in the future, on its own or in conjunction with others, and is fearful \n8 \nthat the same unlawful police actions in response to these and similar protests of \n9 \ninstitutional racism and police brutality will be repeated absent injunctive relief to \n10 \nprohibit the San José Police Department’s (hereafter, SJPD) practices, policies, and \n11 \ncustoms that caused the unlawful action in response to the recent protests.  \n12 \n15.  Plaintiff SAN JOSÉ PEACE AND JUSTICE CENTER (hereafter, SJPJC), is an \n13 \nunincorporated association and a project of the Collins Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. \n14 \nSJPJC was established in 1957 as a resource and action center for progressive activism, \n15 \nseeking to develop and nurture the growing community of people who work to create and \n16 \nparticipate in a just, peaceful, and non-violent society, one that ensures human rights for \n17 \nall people and ensures the continuation of, and respect for, all life on earth.  SJPJC serves \n18 \nmore than 50 affiliated organizations, many of whom plan and/or participate in \n19 \ndemonstrations in San José. SJPJC supported its constituent organizations in mobilizing \n20 \nfor the late May – early June, 2020, demonstrations. SJPJC’s staff, volunteers and \n21 \nconstituent organizations’ rights to speech and assembly were violated by the SJPD’s \n22  unlawful response to the demonstrations. SJPJC and its constituent organizations plan to \n23  assist, plan, participate in, and hold similar events in the future, and are fearful that the \n24  same unlawful police actions in response to these and similar protests of institutional \n25  racism and police brutality will be repeated absent injunctive relief to prohibit the SJPD’s \n26  practices, policies, and customs that caused the unlawful action in response to the recent \n27  protests. \n28   \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 6 \n \n\n \n \n \n2.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n13 \nA. The CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers responded violently to \n14 \nprotestors participating in demonstrations against racist police \n15 \nviolence. \n16 \n43.  On May 25, 2020, Minneapolis police officers killed George Floyd, a 46-year-old \n17 \nBlack resident. One white police officer knelt on Mr. Floyd’s neck for nearly nine \n18 \nminutes while three other officers observed. Mr. Floyd died calling out for his mother and \n19 \nbegging for his life as passersby recorded. The recordings were shared on multiple media \n20 \nplatforms for all of America to witness. \n21 \n44.  In the weeks and months following Mr. Floyd’s death, people across the country \n22  flooded into streets demanding an end to police brutality against Black people; protesting \n23  the deaths of Mr. Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and countless others by the \n24  hands of police through vigils, demonstrations, and public gatherings.  \n25  45.  In San José, demonstrators began to gather outside San José City Hall around 2 \n26  p.m. on May 29, 2020, and then marched through the streets. Some participants carried \n27  signs denouncing the policing system that kills Black people and other people of color. \n28  Other participants came with medical supplies, water, and aid for the demonstrators. \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 12 \n \n\n \n \n \nFinally, some, including journalists, legal observers, and passersby, simply observed the \ndemonstration. Most of the demonstrators and observers wore masks and observed social \n1 \ndistancing. \n2 \n46.  The defendants would ultimately inflict the same sort of ruthless violence on the \n3 \ndemonstrators that the demonstrators were protesting, indiscriminately dispersing tear gas \n4 \ninto the crowd, shooting impact munitions without justification, beating demonstrators, \n5 \nand detonating explosive grenades to cause panic and disorientation.  \n6 \n \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n \n18 \n \n19 \nB. Defendants attacked and injured Plaintiffs at the Black Lives Matter \n20 \nprotests. \n21 \n47.  Plaintiffs JOSEPH CAÑAS and CINDY CUELLAR arrived separately at City \n22 \nHall at approximately 2:00 p.m., intending to protest the Minneapolis Police murder of \n23 \nGeorge Floyd, systemic racism and police violence. Each watched as the crowd grew \n24 \nfrom a few scattered people to around one-hundred demonstrators, chanting their support \n25 \nfor the Black Lives Matter movement and denouncing police brutality. The crowd \n26 \nmarched from City Hall toward Highway 101, where some demonstrators continued \n27 \nprotesting and repeated their chants. Demonstrators safely exited the highway area and \n28 \nmade their way back downtown, where organizers had publicized a rally with speakers in \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 13 \n \n\n \n \n \nfront of City Hall.  \n48.  Reverend Jethroe Moore II, President of NAACP, attended the demonstration to \n1 \nmeet with CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Chief of Police EDGARDO GARCIA with the intent to \n2 \nhelp coordinate dialogue between protesters and the police. EDGARDO GARCIA and \n3 \nRev. Moore arranged for the meeting over the phone. However, when Rev. Moore \n4 \narrived, he could not find EDGARDO GARCIA anywhere and neither did the CITY OF \n5 \nSAN JOSÉ Police Officers \n6 \nanswer his request to notify \n7 \nEDGARDO GARCIA of Rev. \n8 \nMoore’s arrival.  \n9 \n49.  Instead, as the \n10 \ndemonstrators peacefully \n11 \nmarched toward City Hall, CITY \n12 \nOF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers, \n13 \non orders from defendant JASON \n14 \nDWYER, formed a line behind \n15   \nthe demonstrators, at E. Santa \nImage 1. Demonstrator Khennedi Meeks, crying, \n16 \nClara and 8th Streets, and another  feeling disappointed and helpless to stop the violence.  \n \n17 \nline of police, including officers on foot, on motorcycles and in vehicles, blocked the \n18 \nmarchers’ way at E. Santa Clara and S. 7th Streets. \n19 \n50.  Blocked by the police line, the plaintiffs and other demonstrators stopped \n20  marching. The CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers moved to surround and kettle5 them. \n21 \nPlaintiffs did not see, hear, or perceive any unlawful or dangerous activity that would \n22  warrant this police action or the police use of force that ensued. There was no \n23  justification for defendant DWYER’s decision that the demonstration constituted an \n24  unlawful assembly. \n25  51.  Rev. Moore watched as CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers aggressively \n26 \n \n27   \n5“Kettling” refers to a military or police tactic in which military or police box in a crowd on all sides in a confined \n28  space. \n \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 14 \n \n\n \n \n \nassembled and became concerned for the safety of the young people in the crowd. He \ninstructed the people at the front of crowd—those closest to the police formation—to \n1 \nkneel before the law enforcement officers and pray. Several people did as Rev. Moore \n2 \nsuggested. This was ineffective in deescalating the police response.  \n3 \n52.  The CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers aimed their weapons at the \n4 \ndemonstrators and began to strike and jab protesters with batons in their faces, chest, and \n5 \nabdomen. The police show of force quickly escalated to using chemical weapons, impact \n6 \nmunitions and explosive flash-bang grenades and stinger grenades.  \n7 \n53.  Rev. Moore witnessed one DOE defendant CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer \n8 \ngrab a young woman by her legs from her kneeling position, exposing her undergarments \n9 \nand body to the crowd. He saw another young woman fall as she attempted to stand and \n10 \nmove away from the aggressive forward movements of the police. But as Rev. Moore \n11 \nattempted to help her, CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers pushed them both down. \n12 \nDOE defendant CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers then jabbed Rev. Moore in the ribs \n13 \nmore than once. Two demonstrators helped extricate Rev. Moore from the kettle as the \n14 \npolice closed tighter around the crowd. \n15 \n54.  Rev. Moore sat outside of the enclosing police circle to gather his breath and \n16 \nstrength enough to leave downtown. However, before Rev. Moore could stand to leave, \n17 \nthe police launched chemical weapons into the crowd. Rev. Moore could not see or \n18 \nbreathe for several minutes, and suffered from wheezing for months afterward.  \n19 \n \n20 \n \n21 \n \n22   \n23   \n24   \n25   \n26   \n27   \n28   \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 15 \n \n\n \n \n \n55.  Plaintiff JOSEPH CAÑAS had been playing his guitar while marching, and \ncontinued to play while kettled by the police. As he was standing, peacefully playing the \n1 \nguitar about 5 p.m., he heard an announcement from the police, but could not make out \n2 \nthe words. Suddenly, defendant JARED YUEN or a DOE defendant CITY OF SAN \n3 \nJOSÉ Police Officer shot Mr. Cañas in the eye with an impact munition, causing searing \n4 \npain and permanently damaging his vision.  \n5 \n56.  The impact caused Mr. Cañas to collapse to the ground in the middle of the street. \n6 \nNo CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers came to Mr. Cañas’ aid or summoned aid for \n7 \nhim. Other demonstrators picked him up, gave him first aid, and helped him get home.  \n8 \n57.  Plaintiff CINDY CUELLAR watched the defendants shoot impact munitions into \n9 \nthe crowd while she standing in front of City Hall. She saw the munitions hit \n10 \ndemonstrators and cause them to fall to the ground. Some demonstrators scrambled in \n11 \nhorror and attempted to run away from Defendants. \n12 \n58.  Ms. Cuellar saw a CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer shoot a journalist she knew \n13 \nwith a munition. Ms. Cuellar started to go to her friend’s aid, but a DOE defendant CITY \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27   \nImage 2.

The impact and pain \n2 \nsent her tumbling toward the ground.  \n3 \n59.  Other demonstrators caught Ms. \n4 \nCuellar before she hit the ground. A \n5 \ndemonstrator applied disinfectant to Ms. \n6 \nCuellar’s wound, which had immediately \n7 \nbruised and swelled.  No CITY OF SAN \n8 \nJOSÉ Police Officer came to Ms. \n9 \nCuellar’s aid or summoned aid for her. \n10 \n60.  As Ms. Cuellar sat to tend to her \n11 \nwound, she witnessed CITY OF SAN \n12 \n  JOSÉ Police Officers cover their faces \n13  Image 3. Ms. Cuellar’s bleeding left calf  \nwith gas masks, and then shoot rounds of \n14 \ntear gas and explosive Stinger grenades and/or flash-bang grenades into the crowd. It \n15 \nbecame so frightening that Ms. Cuellar decided she needed to go home, as she would not \n16 \nbe able to run from the munitions the police were shooting into the crowd. Walking on \n17 \nher injured leg made the wound bleed heavily.  \n18 \n61.  Plaintiffs LESLIE VASQUEZ and YESSICA RILES, sisters, also went to the May \n19 \n29, 2020, San José demonstration to protest the Minneapolis Police murder of George \n20 \nFloyd, systemic racism and police violence, arriving around 4 p.m. When the police \n21 \narrived in the civic center area, the sisters became separated in the crowd. \n22  62.  As Ms. Vasquez walked toward E. Santa Clara and S. 7th Streets, she saw police \n23  were shooting a young woman with impact munitions. When Ms. Vasquez tried to help \n24  the woman, defendant JARED YUEN or a DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer \n25  shot her in the groin at close range with an impact munition. \n26  63.  Another DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer hit Ms. Vasquez in the stomach \n27 \n28 \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 17 \n \n\n \n \n \nwith his baton multiple times \nand pushed her, even though \n1 \nshe put her hands up.   \n2 \n64.   Ms. Riles walked \n3 \ntoward S. 7th Street looking \n4 \nfor her sister, Ms. Vasquez, \n5 \nwhen she heard shooting. At \n6 \nthe intersection of E. Santa \n7 \nClara and S. 7th Streets, she \n8 \nsaw Ms. Vasquez standing \n9 \nin front of the police line \n10 \nwith her hands up.  \n11 \n65.  Ms. Riles put her \n12 \nhands up too in a gesture of \n13 \n“Don’t shoot”, and crossed \n14 \nthe street, intending to get \n15 \nher sister and leave. But \n16 \n  then, without warning, a \nImage 4. Ms. Vasquez with her hands up  \n17 \nDOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ \n18 \nPolice Officer took aim at and shot her, too, in the abdomen with an impact munition. \n19 \nMs. Riles heard multiple shots and felt searing pain as the DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ \n20 \nPolice Officer shot her in the groin, pelvic region and abdomen, repeatedly, and other \n21 \nofficers shot people around her. \n22  66.  No CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers came to Ms. Vasquez’ or Ms. Riles’ aid \n23  or summoned aid for them. \n24  67.  Defendants failed to give clear warnings before using force against the plaintiffs. \n25  Ms. Riles first heard the police give an amplified dispersal order after they had already \n26  shot her and multiple others. Other plaintiffs did not hear or could not make out an order. \n27  68.  Plaintiff GUSTAVO FLORES participated in the May 29, 2020, demonstration to \n28  protest the Minneapolis Police murder of George Floyd, systemic racism and police \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 18 \n \n\n \n \n \nviolence. Shortly after 5:00 \np.m., Mr. Flores walked in the \n1 \ndirection of Mexican Heritage \n2 \nPlaza with other demonstrators, \n3 \nwhen their path was blocked by \n4 \nCITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \n5 \nOfficers who had formed a line \n6 \nin the area of E. Santa Clara St. \n7 \nbetween 8th and 9th Streets.  \n8 \n69.  Mr. Flores was near the \n9 \nfront of the crowd when he \n10 \nheard a DOE CITY OF SAN \n11 \nJOSÉ Police Officer tell the \n12 \nother CITY OF SAN JOSÉ \n13 \n \nPolice Officers, softly, “Get \nImage 5. Ms. Riles’ bruises. \n14 \nready to shoot!” Defendants did \n15 \nnot make any announcement or warning to the crowd. Mr. Flores tried to warn the other \n16 \ndemonstrators, walking down the front line of demonstrators suggesting they put their \n17 \nhands up in a gesture of “Don’t shoot!”, to show they were unarmed did not pose a threat.  \n18 \nBut before Mr. Flores reached the end of the line, a DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \n19 \nOfficer shot him in the groin and testicle with an impact munition.  \n20 \n70.  Mr. Flores fell to the ground as a result of being shot. As he stood up, he saw that \n21 \nthe DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer was reloading his gun. Mr. Flores tried to \n22  walk away, limping from his injury. Someone in the crowd warned Mr. Flores that the \n23  officer was aiming at him again. When Mr. Flores turned to look, the DOE CITY OF \n24  SAN JOSÉ Police Officer shot him in the left collarbone with another impact munition.  \n25  71.  Mr. Flores saw CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers shoot other people who, like \n26  him, were doing no wrong and presenting no threat.  \n27  72.  No CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers provided or summoned aid for Mr. \n28  Flores.  \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 19 \n \n\n \n \n \n73.  SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT attended the May 29, 2020, demonstration as a legal \nobserver to support the participants’ right to protest for racial justice.  \n1 \n74.  At E. Santa Clara and 7th Streets, Ms. Cartwright observed CITY OF SAN JOSÉ \n2 \nPolice Officers shooting impact munitions into the crowd of demonstrators, and officers \n3 \nthrow two people, including a young teen girl, to the ground by police and beat them with \n4 \nbatons. Ms. Cartwright attempted to take photographs to document and discourage this \n5 \npolice use of force, but CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer FNU DELGADO or a DOE \n6 \nCITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer shoved her in the chest very forcefully with his \n7 \nhands. Ms. Cartwright told the officer that she had a brain injury, but he shoved her twice \n8 \nmore, almost knocking her off her feet.  \n9 \n75.  Ms. Cartwright suffers from trigeminal neuralgia, a chronic pain condition that \n10 \nwas being treated with neurostimulator devices implanted in her head which are powered \n11 \nby a battery implanted in her chest. The area where Officer Delgado struck Ms. \n12 \nCartwright is where the battery is located, and she had to later have her medical team \n13 \ncheck to make sure the wire leading to the neurostimulators was intact. \n14 \n76.  Plaintiff JOSÉPH MALDONADO went to the May 29, 2020, San José \n15 \ndemonstration to protest the Minneapolis Police murder of George Floyd, systemic \n16 \nracism and police violence, arriving after the police had blocked Santa Clara at 7th Street. \n17 \nMr. Maldonado observed only peaceful demonstrating - nothing that would justify the \n18 \nuse of chemical weapons - but noticed that the police put on gas masks.  \n19 \n77.  Mr. Maldonado heard no warning before DOE defendant CITY OF SAN JOSÉ \n20 \nPolice Officers launched a chemical agent, most likely teargas, into the crowd. The gas \n21 \nfelt like it slapped Mr. Maldonado in the face. He experienced an intense burning \n22  sensation like no pain he had ever experienced before: “like a thousand needles hitting \n23  your eyeballs at once.” \n24  78.  Mr. Maldonado ran, and a stranger gave him some water to rinse his eyes. The \n25  CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers did not offer decontamination or any other form of \n26  aid. \n27  79.  At 6:15 p.m., the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Department moved its line of \n28  officers to 5th and Santa Clara. At 6:30 p.m., they began to use “flashbang grenades” and \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 20 \n \n\n \n \n \n“OC Blast Stinger grenades”6 on the crowd, grenades that explode with a very loud bang \nand bright flash of light, and are designed to cause panic and chaos. These grenades can \n1 \ncause temporary or permanent hearing loss, burns, and impact injuries.. The Stinger \n2 \ngrenades also contain pepper spray and release rubber pellets indiscriminately in all \n3 \ndirections.7  \n4 \n80.    Plaintiff M. MICHAEL ACOSTA tried to go shopping on May 29, 2020, but \n5 \ndiscovered that both Walmart and Target were closed. As he was driving back to his \n6 \nresidence in downtown San José, he became aware that a large demonstration was going \n7 \non in response to the Minneapolis Police murder of George Floyd. Mr. Acosta realized \n8 \nthat this was a historic event and wanted to show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter \n9 \nmovement, and to document the demonstration. He parked at his building and walked \n10 \naround taking photos and video with his cell phone over an approximately five block \n11 \narea. He observed that the demonstration was peaceful. \n12 \n81.  But unbeknownst to Mr. Acosta, around 7 p.m., a reported white supremacist \n13 \ndeliberately drove a grey SUV into the crowd, hitting two people near 3rd and E. Santa \n14 \nClara and sending demonstrators running and screaming. CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \n15 \nOfficers shot impact munitions at the vehicle, which broke the windshield, and arrested \n16 \nthe driver.  \n17 \n18 \n19 \n \n20 \n \n21  6The San Jose Police Department’s “Special Operations division is equipped with DEFTECH 1095 / CTS 9594 OC \nBlast Stinger Grenades.

The laceration on his face also required stitches. \n22  87.  Mr. Acosta had to be transported to a different hospital for immediate eye surgery \n23  to try to repair the rupture. However, vision in his left eye could not be restored. \n24  Eventually, Mr. Acosta had to undergo further surgery to completely remove his eye \n25  globe as a result of being shot by the DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer. \n26  88.  As local media covered the defendants’ violent reaction to the demonstration, \n27  additional San José residents began to arrive to aid the demonstrators, but they, too, were \n28  met with CITY OF SAN JOSÉ police violence.  \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 23 \n \n\n \n \n \n89.  Plaintiff MEGAN SWIFT heard about the police violence and went to find the \nMay 29, 2020, demonstration at the Plaza de César Chávez in downtown San José in \n1 \norder to bring aid in support of the racial justice demonstrators. She brought a book bag \n2 \nfilled with water and first aid materials, including gauze and gloves.  \n3 \n90.  When she arrived between 8:30 and 9 p.m., Ms. SWIFT observed a crowd of \n4 \nmostly young people, chanting and holding signs, while some passersby observed from a \n5 \ndistance. Suddenly, DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers charged the crowd with \n6 \nguns and/or launchers raised, while throwing explosive flashbang and/or OC Blast \n7 \nStinger grenades into the crowd. The mood abruptly shifted to panic and the \n8 \ndemonstrators began to scatter.  \n9 \n91.  At this point, Ms. Swift noticed CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers form a line \n10 \nwith batons held crosswise from the bodies, and march toward her. The police yelled \n11 \n“Move” at the demonstrators while simultaneously pushing Ms. Swift and others back \n12 \nwith their clubs. Ms. Swift tried to comply by stepping back, but defendant STEPHEN \n13 \nMICHAEL CURRY #4700 and/or DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers stepped \n14 \nout of the police line multiple times to strike Ms. Swift hard in two-handed blows with \n15 \nhis club.  \n16 \n92.

He took her book \n21 \nbag with force and then proceeded \n22  to handcuff her with her hands \n23  behind her back.  \n24  93.

Plaintiff PETER ALLEN walked \n5 \nto the May 29, 2020, demonstration from \n6 \nhis home, to protest the Minneapolis \n7 \nPolice murder of George Floyd, systemic \n8 \nracism and police violence. Mr. Allen \n9 \njoined the demonstration at the Plaza de \n10 \nCésar Chávez around 8:30 p.m. and sat on \n11 \nthe edge of the stage.  \nImage 10. Mr. Allen’s thigh.  \n12 \n96.  Mr. Allen observed that the crowd \n13 \nwas peaceful and posed no threat to the police. Suddenly, CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \n14 \nOfficers charged the demonstrators while throwing explosive flashbangs and/or OC Blast \n15 \nStinger grenades into the crowd. Mr. Allen tried to back away but before he could do so, \n16 \na DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer shoved him forcefully to the ground with his \n17 \nbaton. Mr. Allen again tried to stand and back away, but the same DOE CITY OF SAN \n18 \nJOSÉ Police Officer used his baton to shove him to the ground again.  \n19 \n97.  Mr. Allen scrambled up and jogged away from the police line. When he was about \n20 \n20 yards from them, he turned to face them with his hands up in a gesture of “Don’t \n21 \nshoot” while backing away from them, but a DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer \n22  proceeded to shoot him in the left upper thigh with an impact munition.  \n23  98.  Moments later, a DOE defendant CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer shot him \n24  again, this time in the left upper chest with an impact munition.  \n25  99.  Plaintiff ALEX LEE also attended the May 29, 2020 demonstrations in downtown \n26  San José to protest the Minneapolis Police murder of George Floyd, systemic racism and \n27  police violence, and to document the events on social media. Around 8 p.m. at City Hall \n28  Plaza, without warning, CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers started shooting impact \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 25 \n \n\n \n \n \nmunitions, explosive grenades and chemical agents at the demonstrators, even though \nneither Mr. Lee nor anyone nearby was threatening the police in any way. As a result of \n1 \nDOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers’ use of chemical agents, Mr. Lee suffered \n2 \nserious difficulty breathing. As a result of DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers’ \n3 \nuse of impact munitions and grenades, Mr. Lee was in fear of serious harm. He perceived \n4 \nthat the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers were trying to prevent him and others from \n5 \nexercising their rights to protest the police killing of George Floyd. \n6 \n100.  Another anti-police violence/racial justice demonstration took place in downtown \n7 \nSan José on Saturday, May 30, 2020, and Mr. Lee again participated. That evening, near \n8 \nCity Hall, DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers again, without warning, fired \n9 \nmunitions, grenades, and chemical agents into the crowd of demonstrators.  \n10 \n101.  A DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer launched and/or threw a projectile, \n11 \nbelieved to be a tear gas canister or a grenade, that hit Mr. Lee’s heel and ankle. This \n12 \ncaused pain, bruising, and fear. As a result of the chemical agent, Mr. Lee again suffered \n13 \ndifficulty breathing, feared serious harm from the police-fired projectiles, and felt the \n14 \npolice were trying to prevent him and others from exercising their rights to protest the \n15 \npolice killing of George Floyd. \n16 \n102.  Plaintiff SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT also attended the May 30, 2020, San José \n17 \ndemonstration, as a legal observer, when DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers used \n18 \nchemical agents against her and the demonstrators. Ms. Cartwright stayed in what she \n19 \nthought was a safe spot against a wall on 4th Street by City Hall, because she was \n20 \nphysically unable to run due to her knee condition: her right knee had been surgically \n21 \nreplaced and her left knee needed replacement. Then, a DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \n22  Officer shot at her four times in quick succession with impact munitions. Munitions \n23  struck her right knee (the one that had recently been replaced), her left calf, and her \n24  pinkie finger. The fourth shot whizzed by, barely missing her hip. \n25  103.  Plaintiff MAHMOUDREZA NAEMEH went to the May 30, 2020, demonstration \n26  in San José to protest the Minneapolis Police murder of George Floyd, systemic racism \n27  and police violence against Black people. Mr. Naemeh was wearing Muslim prayer \n28  beads, a gift from his mother. He arrived at about 2:30 p.m. near City Hall, and took \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 26 \n \n\n \n \n \nphotos as a small crowd gathered. Around 5:30 p.m., Mr. Naemeh marched to the library \nwith the other demonstrators. Some of the demonstrators engaged in a die-in, lying down \n1 \non the ground for a couple of minutes. There were speakers and chanting, conveying their \n2 \nmessage against police violence and racism.  \n3 \n104.  At about 6:30 p.m., CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers blocked the intersection \n4 \nof E. Santa Clara and 4th Streets with a line of officers, increasing tension so that police \n5 \nand demonstrators began yelling at each other. Mr. Naemeh walked backward on the \n6 \nsidewalk away from the police with his hands up, but a DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \n7 \nOfficer shot him in the shin just below his knee with an impact munition.  \n8 \n105.  Mr. Naemeh tried to take cover and walked between the buildings back to 4th and \n9 \nSan Fernando, but the line of police came down and blocked the street at that location \n10 \nand began shooting. Mr. Naemeh walked away and continued looking for the friend who \n11 \nwas giving him a ride home \n12 \n106.  At 2nd and San Fernando Streets, Mr. Naemeh came upon a small group of \n13 \ndemonstrators and walked with them to the Plaza de César Chávez. Suddenly, a large \n14 \ngroup of CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers charged toward them on foot and \n15 \nmotorcycles. Mr. Naemeh and others ran, but DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers \n16 \ncame from all directions, surrounding the demonstrators so that they could not leave. \n17 \nThey then tackled and arrested Mr. Naemeh along with about thirty to forty other people \n18 \nat around 8:30 - 9 p.m. \n19 \n107.  DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers told Mr. Naemeh that he was the \n20 \nperson responsible for throwing frozen water bottles and that they had caught this on \n21 \nvideo. Mr. Naemeh had not thrown anything and denied this, but the DOE officers told \n22  him that he was going to jail for six months. When Mr. Naemeh provided his \n23  identification, a DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer asked him how to pronounce \n24  his name. Mr. Naemeh said to call him Reza (short for Mahmoudreza). Another DOE \n25  CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer came up and photographed him. Mr. Naemeh did not \n26  see the police take anyone else’s photograph, so this felt like an act of intimidation. The \n27  officers continued to talk about Mr. Naemeh throwing frozen water bottles and that he \n28  would be going to jail, seeming to single him out as a ringleader. Once the police were \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 27 \n \n\n \n \n \nready to transport the arrestees, they handed Mr. Naemeh to another DOE CITY OF SAN \nJOSÉ Police Officer, who looked at his identification and called him “Mohammed”. Mr. \n1 \nNaemeh corrected him, saying, “It’s Reza.” The DOE officer smirked, and another DOE \n2 \nCITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer repeated, “Mohammed”. Mr. Naemeh was placed on \n3 \na bus and taken to a stadium parking lot, where he was put on a different bus.  \n4 \n108.  On the second bus, DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers or Santa Clara \n5 \nCounty Sheriff Officers took Mr. Naemeh’s face mask off without his consent. He was \n6 \nforced to remain in an enclosed space, caged in the back of the bus, with about ten other \n7 \npeople, most of whom were not wearing masks. Finally, after approximately three hours \n8 \nin custody, Mr. Naemeh was given a citation and placed in the back of another vehicle \n9 \nwith six other people, none of whom were wearing masks. Public health officials have \n10 \nwarned against remaining in enclosed areas in close quarters with other people without \n11 \nface masks as this greatly increases the risk of COVID-19 transmission.  \n12 \n109.  Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Department personnel proceeded to drive Mr. \n13 \nNaemeh and the other arrestees to the parking lot of the Great Mall in Milpitas, CA, \n14 \nwhere they were released after 11:30 p.m., when no public transit was running.   \n15 \n110.  Mr. Naemeh was never charged with any crime. \n16 \n111.  On May 31, 2020, defendant CITY OF SAN JOSÉ imposed an unlawful city-wide \n17 \n8:30 p.m. – 5:30 a.m. curfew. The 8:30 p.m. curfew was declared by San José City \n18 \nManager defendant DAVID SYKES, approved by San José Mayor defendant SAM \n19 \nLICCARDO and CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Chief defendant EDDIE GARCIA, and \n20 \nannounced at approximately 5:30 p.m. that same day, Sunday May 31. The curfew \n21 \nremained in effect until June 4, 2020. \n22  112.  The curfew was enacted by CITY OF SAN JOSÉ policymakers LICCARDO, \n23  GARCIA and SYKES with the intention to unlawfully suppress First Amendment rights \n24  by purporting to ban all political protest in the evening hours, during a time when \n25  thousands of people sought to express their opposition to racially discriminatory police \n26  violence.  \n27  113.  Defendant CITY OF SAN JOSÉ’s curfew violated the First Amendment’s \n28  prohibition on laws restricting speech by entirely suppressing all demonstrations \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 28 \n \n\n \n \n \noccurring after 8:30 p.m., when the CITY had other, less restrictive, lawful means to \nprevent any actual or imminent violence. \n1 \n114.  Moreover, to satisfy First Amendment requirements, a curfew must both be \n2 \nnarrowly tailored and allow for ample alternative channels of communication. Defendant \n3 \nCITY OF SAN JOSÉ’s curfew was not narrowly tailored and did not allow for ample \n4 \nalternative channels of communication. Less burdensome means for preventing violence \n5 \nwere readily available by employing traditional legal methods.  \n6 \n115.  Defendants’ curfew also violated the fundamental constitutional right of freedom \n7 \nof movement by imposing restrictions on the plaintiffs’ and class members’ freedom of \n8 \nmovement that were not narrowly tailored.  \n9 \n116.  Defendants failed to provide sufficient notice of the curfew before enforcing it. \n10 \nThe curfew was only announced three hours before its start, and it was not adequately \n11 \npublicized. This inadequate notice deprived plaintiffs SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT, ALEX \n12 \nLEE, and class members of their Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. \n13 \n117.  Despite hobbling from her injuries of the preceding night, plaintiff SHAUNN \n14 \nCARTWRIGHT went to the May 31, 2020, San José demonstration at approximately \n15 \n6:30 or 7 p.m. to distribute a legal hotline number to demonstrators and again serve as a \n16 \nlegal observer. She was wearing a green “legal observer” hat and a face mask to protect \n17 \nher and others from COVID-19. Plaintiff ALEX LEE also attended the May 31, 2020, \n18 \ndemonstration.  \n19 \n118.  At about 8:30 p.m., Ms. Cartwright, Mr. Lee, medics, and journalists were \n20 \npeacefully talking on the sidewalk, when DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers \n21 \nthreatened them with arrest telling them that they were going to be made examples of and \n22  were going to jail for violating the curfew. Ms. Cartwright explained that she was a legal \n23  observer and that others were medics and journalists. Ms. Cartwright, Mr. Lee, the \n24  medics and journalists went on to observe the police, and once they returned around \n25  11:30 p.m., the DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers arrested Ms. Cartwright, Mr. \n26  Lee, and the others.  \n27  119.  A DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer told Ms. Cartwright to get into a \n28  police van, but she could not step up into the van because of her injuries from being shot \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 29 \n \n\n \n \n \nthe previous night, so DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers had her sit in a patrol \ncar with two officers who were not wearing masks. The officers drove her to the SAP \n1 \nCenter, where she was forced to sit in a bus with two other people who were not wearing \n2 \nmasks for 30-60 minutes.  \n3 \n120.  The police then processed Ms. Cartwright, and handed her off to Santa Clara \n4 \nCounty Sheriff’s Office personnel to transport her. The Santa Clara Sheriffs dropped Ms. \n5 \nCartwright off in the parking lot of Eastridge Mall at 1 a.m., with no way to get home, \n6 \nand despite the still ongoing curfew. Ms. Cartwright was never charged with any crime. \n7 \n121.  Mr. Lee on the other hand was taken to the Great Mall in Milpitas, CA, and \n8 \ndropped off in the parking lot, similarly after public transportation had stopped running. \n9 \nMr. Lee was never charged with any crime. \n10 \n122.  The CITY OF SAN JOSÉ and its police neither provided nor summoned medical \n11 \naid for any of the plaintiffs they had shot with impact munitions or subjected to chemical \n12 \nweapons on May 29, 30, and 31, 2020.  \n13 \n123.  None of the plaintiffs presented a threat or engaged in any conduct justifying any \n14 \nuse of force by the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers at any time.  \n15 \n124.  The force of the munitions knocked the plaintiffs and class members off their feet \n16 \nand/or otherwise restricted their freedom of movement by stopping them in their tracks \n17 \nand causing injuries. People who were trying to disperse or back up in compliance with \n18 \npolice orders were as likely to be shot as people who stood still. Clouds of chemical \n19 \nagents prevented plaintiffs and other assembled persons from escaping. Others were \n20 \ntemporarily stopped from getting to injured persons to aid them and helping them to \n21 \nsafety. \n22  125.  Defendants egregiously restrained and intruded upon the liberty and privacy of \n23  plaintiffs by their show of force in striking plaintiffs about their bodies with munitions \n24  and explosives, and assaulting plaintiffs with chemical agents in their eyes, noses and \n25  mouths. \n26  126.  There was no probable cause to support Mr. Naemeh’s, Mr. Lee’s, Ms. Swift’s, or \n27  Ms. Cartwright’s arrests, or any of the arrests of class members for curfew violations, \n28  failure to disperse, failure to follow a lawful order of a police officer, and/or unlawful \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 30 \n \n\n \n \n \nassembly.  \n127.  As a direct and proximate cause of the conduct described herein, the named \n1 \nindividual plaintiffs and the class members have been denied their constitutional, \n2 \nstatutory, and legal rights as stated herein, and have suffered general and special \n3 \ndamages, including but not limited to, mental and emotional distress, physical injuries \n4 \nand bodily harm, loss of wages and damage to career, pain, fear, humiliation, \n5 \nembarrassment, discomfort, and anxiety and other damages in an amount according to \n6 \nproof.  \n7 \nC. Defendants’ excessive force impeded each of the plaintiffs’ ability to \n8 \ncontinue exercising their First Amendment rights and continues to chill \n9 \ntheir First Amendment rights.  \n10 \n128.  Each of the plaintiffs continues to desire, and possesses the intention, to peacefully \n11 \nand lawfully assemble and express their views in opposition to police racist violence and \n12 \nrelated issues in San José, but the defendants’ indiscriminate and excessive use of \n13 \nmunitions, explosive grenades and chemical agents is causing them to fear that when they \n14 \nparticipate in such expressive activities, the defendants will injure them again by such \n15 \nindiscriminate, unlawful and/or excessive use of force that harmed them and other \n16 \npersons engaged in lawful and peaceful activity on May 29, 30, and 31, 2020. \n17 \n129.  Plaintiff MEGAN SWIFT suffered sizeable and painful bruising as a result of the \n18 \nactions of the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police, including defendant Officer CURRY. Since \n19 \nbeing beaten and wrongfully arrested on May 29, 2020, she has felt nervous and scared \n20 \naround officers. The day after her arrest, CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers contacted \n21 \nher mother in Pennsylvania asking her mother if she knew her daughter had been \n22  arrested. Ms. Swift has not lived in Pennsylvania since 1993, and had not given her \n23  mother’s contact information to Defendants, so this was very disconcerting and \n24  intimidating, and compounded Ms. Swift’s fear of the police. She is not only afraid for \n25  herself, but for friends who interact with the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police. Ms. Swift is \n26  upset and embarrassed that her daughters saw her injured by the police. While she still \n27  wants to help make social change, she feels helpless and is more hesitant to participate in \n28  demonstrations in San José as a result of Defendants’ misconduct. \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 31 \n \n\n \n \n \n130.  After the protest on May 29, Plaintiff LESLIE VASQUEZ went to work, but tried \nnot to walk as she was in so much pain. Unfortunately, her job requires her to walk all \n1 \nover a large hospital. She usually does so easily, but the pain made walking so \n2 \nunbearable, that she did her best to avoid walking for about two weeks. She felt this \n3 \ndecision impacted how she functioned at work and as a parent. Because of the location of \n4 \nthe bruises, she was too embarrassed to tell anyone, or ask for help managing the pain. As \n5 \na result, the only medication she took was Tylenol. The week after the May 29 protest, \n6 \nshe had a gynecologist appointment, and seeing her enormous bruises, her doctor was \n7 \nconcerned that Ms. Vasquez was being abused. This upset and embarrassed Ms. Vasquez. \n8 \nShe avoided seeing her partner until the bruises healed, and is still uncomfortable wearing \n9 \nshorts or other clothing that exposes what is now permanent scarring. Ms. Vasquez feels \n10 \nscared that this happened just because she was trying to help someone. As a result of \n11 \ndefendants’ misconduct, she is hesitant to attend San José demonstrations or be around \n12 \npolice.  \n13 \n131.  Plaintiff JOSÉPH \n14 \nMALDONADO has suffered \n15 \nfrom anxiety, tension, and \n16 \ndifficulty sleeping as a result of \n17 \nthe police violence on May 29, \n18 \n2020, and his performance at \n19 \nwork has suffered. Mr. \n20 \nMaldonado lives in the \n21 \ndowntown area where the police \n22  violence occurred, and going to \n23  his usual grocery store or even \n24  just leaving his house triggers \n25  his anxiety and memories of the \n26  experience of being teargassed. \n27  He has only attended one other   \nImage 11. Ms. Vasquez’s bruising on one of her inner \n28  demonstration since then, and  thighs.  \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 32 \n \n\n \n \n \nwhen the group started marching, Mr. Maldonado became so anxious that he had to step \nout. He stood to the side because he didn’t feel safe. As a result of Defendants’ \n1 \nmisconduct, Mr. Maldonado distrusts police and feels they are dangerous to him.  \n2 \n132.  After his arrest on May 30, 2020, plaintiff MAHMOUDREZA NAEMEH was \n3 \nworried that he might be infected with COVID-19 as a result of the DOE CITY OF SAN \n4 \nJOSÉ Police and/or Santa Clara County Sheriffs’ acts of removing his mask and \n5 \nunlawfully detaining him for an extended period under conditions likely to spread \n6 \nCOVID-19. He had to quarantine himself and undergo testing, and could not go into the \n7 \nlaboratory where he worked as a chemical analyst for two weeks. He suffered a bleeding \n8 \nwound, bruising, pain and disability as a result of being shot. The shooting, wrongful \n9 \narrest, and Islamophobic profiling and harassment deeply affected him and caused him \n10 \ncontinuing psychological trauma.  \n11 \n133.  Plaintiff M. MICHAEL ACOSTA remained in severe pain over the month after \n12 \nthe DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer shot him in the eye. Doctors advised him \n13 \nthat he was at risk for sympathetic ophthalmia of his right eye, which could result in \n14 \ncomplete blindness. Mr. Acosta ultimately had to have his left eye enucleated – surgically \n15 \nremoved – as a result of the severe injury caused by being shot with an impact munition \n16 \nby a DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer.  \n17 \n134.  Mr. Acosta missed weeks of work after he was shot. After having the surgery to \n18 \nremove his eye on July 1, 2020, he is no longer in pain, but struggled to adjust to his new \n19 \nmonocular, impaired vision, and to the trauma of being shot by the police and losing a \n20 \npart of his body. In November, 2020, Mr. Acosta was fitted with a prosthetic eye for his \n21 \neye socket. He experiences continuing numbness on the left side of his face, which is a \n22  constant reminder of the fact that his eye is missing. \n23  135.  The loss of his eye, emotional trauma, and reduced vision have impacted every \n24  aspect of Mr. Acosta’s personal and professional life. At first, he could not leave the \n25  house by himself. He is now starting to be more independent, but has particular difficulty \n26  at night. His impaired vision precluded him from driving until very recently, which was \n27  extraordinarily inconvenient given his continuing need to see doctors for his injuries. For \n28  example, a follow-up medical appointment with the ocularist involved more than six \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 33 \n \n\n \n \n \nhours round trip on public transportation unless a friend was available to drive him. Due \nto the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and Santa Clara County public health orders, each \n1 \ntime Mr. Acosta was forced to take public transportation for such a long trip, he had to \n2 \nthen quarantine himself for two weeks from his small social “bubble”. In February, 2021, \n3 \nMr. Acosta began to try driving again but only in daylight and good weather. Driving is \n4 \nvery challenging and he feels very nervous, and still cannot drive at all at night. Mr. \n5 \nAcosta has a demanding position at Apple, and work, too, has been a struggle. \n6 \n136.  Before he was shot, if Mr. Acosta became aware of a protest nearby in his \n7 \nneighborhood of downtown San José, he would want to see what was going on and \n8 \npotentially observe and document as he did on May 29, 2020. Now, if he is out walking \n9 \nand hears the sound of a protest, he feels uncomfortable and immediately heads to the \n10 \nsafety of his home. \n11 \n137.  Plaintiff JOSEPH CAÑAS was struck in the eye with the impact munition as well, \n12 \nleaving him with a black eye and blurred vision. Over the following days he had \n13 \ncontinued pain, and although this gradually eased, his vision continued to be impaired. \n14 \nMr. Cañas has trouble reading, viewing lighted screens, adjusting to brightness, and \n15 \nexperiences flashes, floaters and issues with depth perception and peripheral vision with \n16 \nhis left eye. This vision impairment is permanent and he must now wear glasses which he \n17 \nnever needed before. The glasses are helpful, but do not completely alleviate the \n18 \nproblems caused by being shot in the eye. \n19 \n138.  Mr. Cañas still feels strongly about police racism and violence and would like to \n20 \nexpress his views through street demonstrations. But, since he was shot, he has not been \n21 \nas active in demonstrations because he experiences anxiety about the police injuring him \n22  again. He knows from experience that even if he is being peaceful, he can still pay a price \n23  for being in the crowd. If he does attend a demonstration, he is always looking over his \n24  shoulder.  \n25  139.  Mr. Cañas moved out of San José after the May 29 incident in large part because \n26  he felt anxious about police retaliation. After he was shot, his name and photograph \n27  appeared in the San José Mercury News, and he found out that he was mentioned on a \n28  CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police private Facebook page that has been exposed as a forum for \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 34 \n \n\n \n \n \nracist and anti-Muslim hate speech by current and former CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \nOfficers.8 On the Facebook page, a recently retired CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer, \n1 \nSteve Wilson, seems to be referring to Mr. Cañas in a publicized post which called Mr. \n2 \nCañas an “idiot” who deserved to have his eye injured, and referred to the demonstrators \n3 \nas “trash”.9  This caused Mr. Cañas considerable anxiety.  \n4 \n140.  Plaintiff GUSTAVO FLORES, too, had his life upended by Defendants’ act of \n5 \nintentionally shooting him in the groin, genitals and collarbone in retaliation for warning \n6 \nother protestors that the police were preparing to shoot them. Mr. Flores was shocked \n7 \nwhen the police shot not only him, but others in his vicinity, including an elderly woman \n8 \nand a young boy.  \n9 \n141.  Mr. Flores suffered severe bruising, and continuing pain and disability that only \n10 \ngradually improved over the following months. He struggled with everyday activities \n11 \nsuch as lifting things, doing chores, or getting groceries.  \n12 \n142.  The injuries Defendants caused prevented Mr. Flores from working and earning \n13 \nhis regular full-time income for months. Mr. Flores, a tow truck driver, was unable to \n14 \nwork from May 30, 2020, until approximately June 22, 2020. He then returned to work \n15 \npart time even though he was not completely healed. He needed the income to pay basic \n16 \nliving expenses but could only work part-time due to his continuing serious shoulder and \n17 \ngroin pain. \n18 \n143.  There is still a hard, painful lump in Mr. Flores’ testicle. \n19 \n144.  Defendants’ violent actions shook Mr. Flores to the core and made him much \n20 \nmore hesitant to express advocacy against white supremacy and for changes in policing. \n21 \n145.  Plaintiff PETER ALLEN suffered severe bruising to his leg, chest, and rib area as \n22  a result of Defendants’ violence. He had to stay off his feet for a few days after May 29, \n23  2020. The bruises lasted for a month, and Mr. Allen still feels some pain when walking. \n24 \n25 \n \n26 \n \n27  8Charlie Paulsen, Racism and Hate Behind the Blue Wall: Exposing Secret Law Enforcement Facebook Group, \nNoteworthy – The Journal Blog (Jun. 26, 2020), https://blog.usejournal.com/racism-and-hate-behind-the-blue-wall-\n28  exposing-secret-law-enforcement-facebook-groups-6cf23a596a98. \n9Id. \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 35 \n \n\n \n \n \n146.  Since being shot by Defendants on May \n29, Mr. Allen feels apprehensive to participate \n1 \nin demonstrations in San José. When he pushed \n2 \nhimself to attend another rally at City Hall in \n3 \nSan José, he found that when he walked past the \n4 \nstreet where he was shot, his leg began to throb \n5 \nand he experienced anxiety. In fact, whenever he \n6 \nfinds himself at the Plaza de César Chávez his \n7 \nheart rate goes up and he has flashbacks of the \n8 \npolice charging and shooting him on May 29.  \n9 \n147.  Mr. Allen has beautiful memories of the \n10 \nPlaza de César Chávez, one of San José’s oldest \n11 \nparks, which he considers the heart of the city. It \n12 \n  was the site of his first date with his wife. They \nImage 12. Ms. Cartwright’s knee.  \n13 \nwere married in the nearby Cathedral Basilica of \n14 \nSt. Joseph, and took wedding photographs in the Plaza with the cathedral tower in the \n15 \nbackground. Mr. Allen remembers seeing this same tower when he was being shot. It \n16 \nreally upsets Mr. Allen that his beautiful memories of this park are now tarnished by the \n17 \npolice violence and that he will no longer be able to fully enjoy Plaza de César Chávez \n18 \nbecause of the negative emotions and memories associated with the May 29, 2020, police \n19 \nviolence.  \n20 \n148.  Mr. Allen continues to be a part of civic life and does not like letting defendants’ \n21 \nactions get in the way of expressing himself and his values, yet the trauma of having been \n22  brutalized on May 29 gives him pause. \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 36 \n \n\n \n \n \n149.  Plaintiff SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT incurred multiple physical injuries and Post \nTraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a result of Defendants’ violence. This has made her \n1 \ndaily activities such as driving, hearing sounds, and seeing police officers difficult. Ms. \n2 \nCartwright dreads going to bed because she wakes up, startled, repeatedly throughout the \n3 \nnight. Every time Ms. Cartwright leaves her house, her leg shakes, she breathes heavily \n4 \nand starts hyperventilating. Her trigeminal neuralgia requires that she not express herself \n5 \nthrough her facial muscles, but the PTSD causes her to use these muscles, triggering \n6 \nexcruciating pain. Ms. Cartwright must struggle to hold back her tears and emotions to \n7 \navoid unbearable pain in her face. \n8 \n150.  Ms. Cartwright now has a permanent scar on her right knee where she was shot. \n9 \nSeeing this is extremely upsetting as it reminds her of the pain and Defendants’ wrongful \n10 \nactions towards her. \n11 \n151.  Ms. Cartwright still wishes to attend demonstrations, but feels traumatized by the \n12 \nviolence, wrongful arrest, and other mistreatment Defendants inflicted on her on May 29, \n13 \n30, and 31, 2020, and must overcome this in \n14 \norder to exercise her First Amendment rights.  \n15 \n152.  For at least a month after she was shot, \n16 \nthe bruises on Plaintiff YESSICA RILES’ \n17 \nabdomen and pelvis were tender, and it was \n18 \ndifficult and painful for her to breastfeed and \n19 \ncare for her baby. As a result of the police \n20 \nviolence, she had trouble sleeping, was restless, \n21 \ntearful, and often felt uneasy for an even longer \n22  time.  \n23  153.  Ms. Riles is afraid to express her views \n24  by attending demonstrations as a result of being \n25  shot on May 29, although she has overcome this \n26  to attend one demonstration that had little police \n \nImage 13. Ms. Cartwright’s knee.  \n27  presence. Ever since May 29, 2020, when Ms. \n \n28  Riles sees police officers, her heart rate goes up and she experiences anxiety. Just the \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 37 \n \n\n \n \n \nthought of that day causes Ms. Riles to feel sick to her stomach. For example, the sound \nof loud fireworks on July 4th and New Year’s Eve brought back the memory of the police \n1 \nviolence, causing Ms. Riles to experience anxiety and difficulty sleeping.  \n2 \n154.  For Plaintiff ALEX LEE, being arrested and experiencing the CITY OF SAN \n3 \nJOSÉ Police Officers’ violent use of chemical weapons and impact munitions on himself \n4 \nand the peaceful demonstrators around him on May 29, 30, and 31, 2020, had long lasting \n5 \nimpacts. Even after his difficulty breathing, pain and bruising subsided, the traumatic \n6 \nexperiences of those three nights continue to haunt him. Although Mr. Lee has attended \n7 \nsome other demonstrations since then, he feels triggered and apprehensive when he sees \n8 \npolice, because he remembers how the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers reacted to \n9 \nthe demonstrations with anger and punitive aggression, evidently intending to suppress \n10 \nhis and others’ rights to demonstrate to express their outrage over racist police killings. \n11 \nHe tries to avoid being near the police, and does not stay as long as he would have prior \n12 \nto the May 2020, police misconduct. He has lost trust in CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \n13 \nOfficers to keep him safe and uphold his constitutional rights.  \n14 \n155.  Plaintiff CINDY CUELLAR’s calf injury continued to hurt for more than two \n15 \nweeks after the incident. Walking was difficult, and she needed help doing ordinary life \n16 \nactivities that involved standing, such as showering and cooking.  \n17 \n156.  The May 29, 2020, police misconduct was draining for Ms. Cuellar physically, \n18 \npsychologically and mentally, and being physically unable to participate in the \n19 \nsubsequent demonstrations over the following two weeks was frustrating. \n20 \n157.  Ms. Cuellar has a permanent scar now reminding her that the police shot her. \n21 \nD. Defendants targeted Black, Indigenous, and other people of color \n22  when using excessive force to break up the crowd.  \n23  158.  Defendants targeted the May 29-31 demonstrations for excessive force and \n24  imposition of a curfew because the message of the demonstrations was focused on police \n25  racist killings of Black people. Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the CITY OF SAN \n26  JOSÉ Police have never used the amount or level of excessive force used against the May \n27  29, 30, and 31 protests, against any San José demonstration that was not focused on \n28  police killings of Black people and other people of color.  \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 38 \n \n\n \n \n \n159.  Defendants targeted people of color for wrongful arrest. According to the CITY, \nof 176 total arrests related to the demonstrations on May 29 – June 2 and 5, 2020, only \n1 \n34, or 19.3%, were of Whites, whereas 96 or 54.5% were Latinx, and 46 or 26%, other \n2 \npeople of color10. In contrast San José is only 32.8% Latinx and is 26.7% White11. \n3 \n160.  YESSICA RILES saw a DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer repeatedly \n4 \nstrike her sister LESLIE VASQUEZ with a baton, and when a White woman asked why \n5 \nthey were targeting people of color instead of her, the DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \n6 \nOfficer hit her sister, who is Latina, harder with the baton. At the same time, there was a \n7 \nMuslim woman wearing a hijab to the left of Ms. Vasquez. The White woman was still \n8 \nasking the DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers why they were targeting people of \n9 \ncolor when those officers then arrested the Muslim hijabi woman. \n10 \n161.  Moreover, the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Department has a well-documented \n11 \nhistory of discriminatory policing, failing to adequately address the behavior that \n12 \nprecipitates discriminatory policing, and fostering a culture of white supremacy. \n13 \n162.  Defendants have long stopped, cited, and arrested people of color at considerably \n14 \ndisproportionate rates. In 1999, SJPD was found to stop Black and Latinx drivers at high \n15 \nrates relative to census population data for the city: Latinx drivers represented 31% of the \n16 \npopulation and 43% of people stopped, while Black people represent 4.5% of the \n17 \npopulation and 7% of the people stopped by SJPD.12 \n18 \n163.  From 2013-2016, in an analysis of the 80,000 traffic and pedestrian stops, Black \n19 \ndrivers were 9 times more likely, and Latinx drivers 3.4 times more likely, than white \n20 \ndrivers to be stopped by SJPD, and 2 times and 1.7 times, respectively, more likely to be \n21  searched. In pedestrian stops, the disparities persisted for Latinx people.13  \n22 \n \n23   \n10 Edgardo Garcia, Memorandum: Police Department Preliminary After Action Report for the Public Protests, Civil \n24  Unrest, and Law Enforcement Response From May 29 — June 7, 2020 1, 122 (September 4, 2020),  \nhttps://sanjose.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=8769493&GUID=3ED4A6F5-F069-4E7F-BADE-\n25  99421D9991B3. \n11City of San José, Fact Sheet: Community Profile, https://www.sanjoseca.gov/your-\n26  government/departments/planning-building-code-enforcement/planning-division/data-and-maps/demographics/fact-\nsheet-community-profile (last visited Dec. 6, 2020). \n27  12American Civil Liberties Union, Police and Community React to San Jose Traffic Stop Data (Dec. 18, 1999), \nhttps://www.aclu.org/press-releases/police-and-community-react-san-jose-traffic-stop-data.   \n28  13Michael R.

The most recent FBI data, from 2018, reveals that despite Black people making up \nonly three percent of the San José population, they are three times more likely to be \n1 \narrested by SJPD compared to White people14.  \n2 \n165.  In 2020, Racial Identity Profiling Act (“RIPA”) data demonstrated the SJPD still \n3 \nhas racially discriminatory ticketing practices for infractions—Latinx people are 2.2 \n4 \ntimes and Black people are 6.6 times more likely to receive a citation than their White \n5 \ncounterparts, more than 20 years after community advocates raised the alarm over \n6 \nSJPD’s original stop data study.15 This data confirms that SJPD has not adequately \n7 \naddressed its harmful practice of targeting people of color and that SJPD’s discriminatory \n8 \npolicing persists. \n9 \n166.  In 2013, the San José Independent Police Auditor (IPA) recommended that the \n10 \n“Field Training Officer (FTO) Handbook to include better instruction and guidance about \n11 \nhow recruits should interact with people of color16.” While the SJPD revised their FTO \n12 \nHandbook in response to this recommendation, the IPA determined that they have \n13 \n“continuing concerns and found the revisions to be woefully inadequate17.” In 2019, the \n14 \nIPA again recommended that the SJPD evaluate its FTO program, and specifically \n15 \ncategorized “Improper Behavior” as an area of concern18. In its analysis, the IPA wrote:  \n16 \n“…the FTO and a recruit stated that two detained Hispanic males \n17  were directed to sit on the curb for their comfort and not to exert \ncontrol. In another encounter, an FTO and recruit pulled over a Black \n18 \nbicyclist for riding without a reflective light at night. At the end of \nthis encounter, the bicyclist asked why he was ordered to throw his \n19 \nbicycle on the ground. The FTO’s response included self-initiated \n20 \nreferences to Black Lives Matter and Hands Up-Don’t Shoot.

In 2020, a private SJPD Facebook group called “10-7ODSJ” was exposed as a \n3  platform for white supremacist racism within the department. William Rockmiller, a \n4  retired SJPD officer, posted publicly about Black Lives Matter, describing its supporters \n5  as “racist idiots,” “un-American” and “enemies” that the police “swore an oath \n6  against.”20 He condemned any of his friends who support BLM and stated, “Fuck \nBLM.”21 Current CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer, Mark Pimental posted, “Black \n7 \nlives don’t really matter.”22 Rockmiller also posted about a Los Angeles Muslim woman, \n8 \nwhose hijab, a head covering, was pulled off by a male cop. His post drew comments \n9 \nfrom current SJPD officers, including Pimental who said, “Hell, I would have pulled it \n10 \nover her face.”23 Retired officer Michael Nagel posted, “I say re-purpose the hijabs into \n11 \nnooses”, with a smile emoji.24 Nagel also posted a chilling image of a “Sharia Barbie” -- \n12 \na woman wearing a hijab with a black eye and bruises.(cid:0)25 \n13 \n168.

In 2018, a Muslim SJPD officer of Lebanese-American heritage sued the CITY \n1 \nOF SAN JOSÉ, alleging years of discriminatory harassment from other officers based on \n2 \nhis race, national origin, and/or religion since September 11, 2001.28 This officer alleged, \n3 \ninter alia, that fellow officers suggested on multiple occasions that he was a member of \n4 \nISIS or a terrorist, and that when he complained, his superiors in SJPD retaliated against \n5 \nhim, for example with a disciplinary writeup.”29 \n6 \n171.  Further, it appears that CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers were unnecessarily \n7 \npanicked prior to the May 29, 2020 demonstration in part due to information their \n8 \ndepartment passed on to them that GARCIA and other high-ranking officers should have \n9 \nknown to be unreliable. In the days leading up to the May 29 protest, the SJPD received \n10 \nbriefings from the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center (NCRIC) which \n11 \nparroted unsubstantiated secondhand reports.30 In its After Action Report, the CITY OF \n12 \nSAN JOSÉ admitted that this NCRIC information “contextualize[d] the mindset of the \n13 \nofficers in the days leading up to and throughout the civil unrest.”31 A 2012 Senate \n14 \ninvestigation of fusion centers, like NCRIC, determined that they provided intel of \n15 \n“uneven quality — oftentimes shoddy, rarely timely, sometimes endangering civilians’ \n16 \nliberties and Privacy Act protections, occasionally taken from already-published sources, \n17 \nand more often than not unrelated to counterterrorism.”32 \n18 \nE.

Defendants routinely fail to provide reasonable accommodations for people with \n2 \ndisabilities to equally participate in constitutionally protected free speech during \n3 \ndemonstrations. Further, they fail to provide reasonable modifications to their orders such \n4 \nthat a person with a disability will have the same opportunity to comply and/or escape \n5 \nbrutal force.  \n6 \n173.  In a recent report, the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ was found to be the only major city \n7 \nwithin the United States to govern without an Office of Disability Affairs and the CITY \n8 \nOF SAN JOSÉ Police Department wholly fails to track any data regarding disability \n9 \nstatus and accommodations.33  \n10 \n174.  During each day of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations, Defendants failed to \n11 \ncommunicate orders to disperse, including instructions for doing so, warnings about \n12 \nimminent use of force, and declarations of unlawful assemblies. When Defendants have \n13 \ncommunicated orders, they were inaudible to most people in and near the demonstrations. \n14 \nThe insufficient orders placed Plaintiff CARTWRIGHT and SJPJC Director Michele \n15 \nMashburn at great risk of harm due to their disabilities. \n16 \n175.  SJPJC Director Michele Mashburn lives with multiple disabilities and chronic \n17 \nhealth conditions that limit her daily life activities and uses an electronic wheelchair for \n18 \nmobility. On May 29, 2020, Ms. Mashburn left her downtown apartment to join the \n19 \ndemonstrations using her electronic wheelchair. Ms. Mashburn intended to join her \n20 \nfriends participating in the demonstration, but when she approached the corner of 4th and \n21 \nSanta Clara Streets she saw the heavy police presence and decided not to continue \n22  forward. The sheer number of police surrounding the crowd was dangerous for her, \n23  because there were no clear paths for her to maneuver her chair in the event of an \n24  emergency. Ms. Mashburn could hear indiscernible announcements from Defendants \n25  from where she observed. Being unable to decipher what the police were saying also \n26  made Ms. Mashburn weary of going into the crowd toward her friends. Instead, she sat \n27 \n \n28   \n33Tifanny Maciel, Juvenile Justice Involved Youth with Disabilities: An Epidemic of Misunderstanding, 1,8 (2020). \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 43 \n \n\n \n \n \nout and watched the demonstration from the sidelines rather than being able and free to \nparticipate in the anti-brutality demonstrations.  \n1 \n176.  When Defendants began to deploy impact munitions, Ms. Mashburn saw impact \n2 \nmunitions fly into multiple directions around her, even on the sidelines. Ms. Mashburn \n3 \ncould see that Defendants were not exercising any restraint with who they were shooting \n4 \nand how, which made things especially dangerous for Ms. Mashburn in a wheelchair. She \n5 \nretreated home and seldom left her apartment in the days following to even go to work, \n6 \nbecause the police presence—given their extreme violence—was too dangerous with her \n7 \ndisability. \n8 \n177.  Similarly, on May 30, 2020, Plaintiff SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT tried to stay \n9 \nback against a wall near City Hall on 4th Street while Defendants indiscriminately \n10 \ndeployed chemical weapons into the crowd. She could not outrun the chemicals due to \n11 \nher disability. Defendants aimed at Ms. Cartwright as she attempted to make herself \n12 \nsmaller and hide, and shot her four times in quick succession with impact munitions as if \n13 \nshe were a sitting duck. The munitions struck her knee replacement and other parts of her \n14 \nbody. \n15 \n178.  In another instance, on May 29, 2020, Ms. Cartwright, who attended the protest as \n16 \na legal observer, attempted to take photos of the Defendants’ treatment of other \n17 \ndemonstrators at E. Santa Clara and 7th Streets. Defendants approached her, and one \n18 \nDOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer attempted to stop Ms. Cartwright from \n19 \nrecording by forcefully shoving her in the chest. Ms. Cartwright told the officer she had a \n20 \ndisability, but the officer shoved her twice more anyway and almost knocked her to her \n21 \nfeet.  \n22  179.  Ms. Cartwright endured significant trauma to her body. Her leg turned purple from \n23  thigh to ankle, swelled, and the alignment of her artificial knee was affected. As a result, \n24  Ms. Cartwright had to use crutches and undergo physical therapy. Because a DOE CITY \n25  OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer shoved Ms. Cartwright in the chest despite being warned \n26  that she had a brain condition, she had to have her neurosurgeon team check whether the \n27  wire had broken. \n28   \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 44 \n \n\n \n \n \nF.

During her detention, Plaintiff SWIFT saw a group of CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \n2 \nOfficers take a picture to send to their boss in order to show how much fun they were \n3 \nhaving. She also overheard the officers making jokes about George Floyd’s death. CITY \n4 \nOF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers around the area she was detained did not wear masks, \n5 \ndespite the fact that they were engaging with the public during a pandemic.  \n6 \n181.  Defendant JARED YUEN was captured on video shouting “Let’s get this \n7 \nmotherfucker” and “Shut up, bitch” to a young woman who asked him a question. Yuen \n8 \nappeared visibly excited and eager to shoot demonstrators. When a protestor said “Fuck \n9 \nyou”, Yuen could be seen on the video to rush forward and shoot impact munitions out of \n10 \nanger, and not because the use of force was necessary or reasonable. However, in \n11 \nresponse to widespread outcry over YUEN’s behavior, defendant Chief GARCIA stated \n12 \npublicly, inter alia, “He’s a good kid and a good cop.”34 \n13 \nG. CITY OF SAN JOSÉ officials made a number of false and misleading \n14 \nstatements to the public and media about the May 29 – June 7, 2020, \n15 \ndemonstrations and the actions of CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers.  \n16 \n182.  For example, the After Action Report the CITY released emphasizes that SJPD \n17 \nhad received reports of violence at other demonstrations around the country in a tone that \n18 \nis clearly exaggerated. One demonstrably false statement in the Report is the claim that \n19 \nSJPD received bulletins “in the days leading up to May 29th, 2020”, which stated that a \n20 \nFederal Security Officer at the Federal Building in Oakland was murdered during a \n21  protest and implies that this was related to the George Floyd protests.35 (The federal \n22  security officer was killed on the evening of May 29, not prior to May 29, so SJPD could \n23  not have received such reports; moreover, federal authorities have acknowledged that the \n24  crime was committed by an individual linked to the “Boogaloo Boys” far-right white \n25 \n \n26 \n \n27  34Robert Salonga, Let’s get this motherf—ker’: San Jose officer benched after viral protest comments, The Mercury \nNews, May 31, 2020, https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/05/31/lets-get-this-motherf-ker-san-jose-officers-viral-\n28  protest-comments-draw-wide-condemnation/. \n35Garcia, supra, at 34. \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 45 \n \n\n \n \n \nsupremacist movement, and was not related to the George Floyd protests.)36 \n183.  The CITY released only three selected, edited excerpts from the SJPD body \n1 \ncamera footage to the public, rather than releasing all of the body camera footage. In \n2 \nparticular, the CITY withheld the body camera footage of the most serious excessive \n3 \nforce incidents.  \n4 \n184.  The After Action Report also contains a highly misleading summary of the injuries \n5 \nsustained by protesters.37  This summary is based only on the few protester injuries that \n6 \nthe police documented in their reports, plus one additional high-profile injury that was \n7 \nreported in the media. Since CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers failed to summon \n8 \nmedical aid for any of the plaintiffs herein, for example, none of their injuries are \n9 \nincluded in these numbers. In fact, the report lists the number of injuries to protesters on \n10 \nMay 29 as only nine, but the report also states that officers expended approximately 246 \n11 \n40mm foam baton rounds, 200 OC/pepper spray rounds, 100 37mm foam baton rounds, 2 \n12 \nbeanbag rounds, 30 stinger grenades, 13 flashbangs, and 45 baton strikes on May 29 \n13 \nalone.38 These facts show that far more than nine people, and far more than the thirteen \n14 \nnamed individual plaintiffs herein, were injured.  \n15 \n185.  While GARCIA accused rioters of causing “millions of dollars” in property \n16 \ndamage, private business reported about $160,000 in vandalism and theft, and the CITY \n17 \nestimated only $120,000 in damages.39 The largest cost, according to the CITY’s damage \n18 \nestimates from May 29 to June 13, was the amount the CITY paid to deploy 816 police, \n19 \nseven firefighters, and four non-sworn employees.40 \n20 \n186.  Defendants’ acts were willful, wanton, malicious, and oppressive, and done with \n21 \nconscious disregard and deliberate indifference for plaintiff’s rights and safety, justifying \n22  an award of punitive damages.  \n23  187.

The constitutional violations alleged herein were the proximate result of decisions, \n8 \norders, acts, and omissions of the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ’s authorized policymakers \n9 \nincluding but not limited to defendants LICCARDO, GARCIA, and SYKES.  \n10 \n190.  For LICCARDO, GARCIA and SYKES, this included the decision to declare a \n11 \ncurfew on May 31, which was unconstitutional as further explained below, and used as a \n12 \npretext to wrongfully arrest 70 people. \n13 \n191.  LICCARDO, GARCIA, SYKES, and DOE City officials caused the CITY OF \n14 \nSAN JOSÉ Police Officers’ constitutional violations complained of herein by failing to \n15 \nprovide adequate policies, training, supervision, and command of their officers assigned \n16 \nto the May 29- June 7, 2020, demonstrations to stop the officers from engaging in racial \n17 \nand religious profiling and harassment, use of excessive force, wrongful arrests, and \n18 \ndeprivation of First Amendment rights. This included, but is not limited to, sending \n19 \ninadequately trained commanders and officers to the May 29 - June 7, 2020, \n20 \ndemonstrations. The CITY has admitted in its After Action Report approved by \n21 \ndefendant Police Chief GARCIA and defendant City Manager SYKES that the CITY OF \n22  SAN JOSÉ Police Officers who responded to the demonstrations were inadequately \n23  trained and supervised, and that the SJPD failed to call in more experienced agencies \n24  through mutual aid. \n25  Much of the Department’s personnel lack experience and tenure in their \nrank. . . . In recent years, the Department has engaged in rapid hiring \n26 \nwhich dilutes the experience pool. Most of the Department’s officers have \n27  never experienced civil unrest of this type.

In some instances, commanders lacked the \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 47 \n \n\n \n \n \nsufficient training and experience in the implementation of the [Incident \nCommand System] as it related to crowd control. 41 \n1  . . . .  \nThere were no patrol commanders in the field for the first two days, \n2 \nresulting in a lack of continuity in communicating mission objectives and \n3  tactical plans.42  \n. . . . \n4 \n \n5  Special Operations commanders expressed concern that without patrol \ncommanders in the field, their span of control was unmanageable…. \n6 \n…[A]t times, [Mobile Field Force] sergeants began making independent \ndecisions about where to move the crowd without unity in command and \n7 \nfull understanding of the mission. 43  \n8 \n. . . .  \n \n9 \nWhile some command staff have received training in crowd control, few of \n10  those trained were involved on the ground during the [May-June 2020 \ndemonstrations].44 \n11 \n \n12  192.  Defendant GARCIA and the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Department changed \n13  its policies days before the May 29, 2020, demonstration to allow use of additional \n14  chemical agent devices and allow use of impact munitions that it had previously \n15  prohibited in crowd control situations and which it acknowledges can cause serious \n16  injury or death.45 These and other impact munitions are highly likely to cause \n17  unjustified injuries when used in crowds, but GARCIA and other CITY OF SAN JOSÉ \n18  Police supervisors failed to adequately train and supervise the officers supplied with the \n19  dangerous munitions.  \n193.  LICCARDO, GARCIA, SYKES and DOE City officials caused the CITY OF \n20 \nSAN JOSÉ Police Officers’ constitutional violations complained of herein by equipping \n21 \ninadequately trained officers with highly dangerous impact munitions, explosive grenades \n22 \nand chemical weapons; approving the use of impact munitions, explosive grenades and \n23 \nchemical weapons at the demonstrations, which resulted in such weapons being used in \n24 \n25 \n \n26   \n41Garcia, supra, at 4. \n27  42Id. at 5. \n43Id. at 47. \n28  44Id. at 32. \n45Id. at 167-168, 170-172. \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 48 \n \n\n \n \n \nan unconstitutional, indiscriminate, racially discriminatory, unnecessary, and excessive \nmanner; failing to have adequate policies and practices for oversight of the use of such \n1 \ndangerous weapons; and by failing to train or have an explicit policy requiring CITY OF \n2 \nSAN JOSÉ Police Officers to intervene in and report excessive force by other officers \n3 \nwhen they are present and observe it.  \n4 \n194.

Plaintiffs are further informed and believe and thereon allege that the \n10 \nconstitutional violations alleged herein were the proximate result of a custom, policy, \n11 \npattern or practice of deliberate indifference by defendant CITY OF SAN JOSÉ to the \n12 \nrepeated violations of the constitutional rights of citizens by defendant CITY OF SAN \n13 \nJOSÉ’s Police Officers, which have included, but are not limited to, the repeated use of \n14 \nexcessive force, racial and religious bias and profiling, and the repeated failure to \n15 \nproperly and/or adequately train, supervise and/or discipline officers with respect to the \n16 \nuse of excessive force, constitutional limitations on the use of force, and racial and \n17 \nreligious bias and profiling; the repeated failure by CITY OF SAN JOSÉ’s high ranking \n18 \nofficials, police department managers and/or supervisors to hold officers accountable for \n19 \nviolating the rights of citizens; and/or other customs, policies and/or practices subject to \n20 \ncontinuing discovery. \n21 \n196.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that defendants GARCIA, DWYER, SYKES, \n22  LOPEZ, TASSIO, and DOE defendants, and/or each of them, caused the violation of the \n23  plaintiffs’ constitutional rights as a result of their supervisory malfeasance and/or \n24  deliberate indifference to the need for more or different training, supervision and/or \n25  discipline of the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police personnel assigned to the subject incident, \n26  including, but not limited to, defendants YUEN, CURRY, DELGADO, and the DOE \n27  defendants, and each of them, to prevent the foreseeable violation of plaintiffs’ \n28  constitutional rights, as further discussed above. \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 49 \n \n\n \n \n \nVII.

CLASS DEFINITION – 23(B)(2) (INJUNCTIVE RELIEF CLASS)  \n8 \n198.  The injunctive relief class is defined as all persons who have in the past \n9 \nparticipated, presently are participating, or may in the future participate in, or be present \n10 \nat, demonstrations within the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ in the exercise of their rights of free \n11 \nspeech, assembly, association, petition, and of the press, in general, and particularly as it \n12 \nrelates to protesting police violence and discrimination against people of color, and \n13 \nobserving, documenting or reporting on such protests.  \n14 \nB. CLASS DEFINITIONS – 23(B)(3) (DAMAGES CLASSES)  \n15 \n199.  One or more of the named plaintiffs (who are indicated for each class) bring this \n16 \naction individually and on behalf of a proposed class of all other persons similarly \n17 \nsituated pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3). The damages classes \n18 \nare defined as:  \n19 \n1.  Arrest Damages Class:   \n20 \n200.  All persons present at or during the aftermath of protests regarding the killing of \n21 \nGeorge Floyd in the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ, between May 29 and June 4, 2020, who were \n22  arrested by CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers on suspicion of one or more of the \n23  following misdemeanors or infractions, and never convicted of a crime related to this \n24  arrest: failure to obey a curfew, failure to disperse, failure to follow a lawful order of a \n25  police officer and/or unlawful assembly. The Class Representatives for this class are \n26  MAHMOUDREZA NAEMEH, MEGAN SWIFT, ALEX LEE and SHAUNN \n27  CARTWRIGHT.  \n28  2.  Direct Force Damages Class \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 50 \n \n\n \n \n \n201.  The direct force damages class is defined as all person who were present during \nthe May 29 – June 7, 2020, anti-police violence/racial justice demonstrations in the \n1 \ngeneral downtown San José area, who did not engage in any conduct justifying the \n2 \ndefendants' use of force against them, and who were subjected to the use of force, \n3 \nincluding those who CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers hit with projectiles, struck with \n4 \nbatons, or who were injured by chemical agents or grenades deployed by the CITY OF \n5 \nSAN JOSÉ Police at the demonstrations. The Class Representatives for this class are \n6 \nJOSEPH CAÑAS; LESLIE VASQUEZ; PETER ALLEN; SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT; \n7 \nYESSICA RILES; JOSÉ GUSTAVO FLORES RODRIGUEZ; ALEX LEE; JOSÉPH \n8 \nMALDONADO; CINDY CUELLAR; MAHMOUDREZA NAEMEH; AND MEGAN \n9 \nSWIFT. \n10 \nC. RULE 23 PREREQUISITES \n11 \ni.  Numerosity \n12 \n202.  This case satisfies the prerequisites of a Rule 23 class action. The class is so \n13 \nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. The injunctive relief class consists \n14 \nof hundreds or even thousands of people. The direct force damages class consists of at \n15 \nleast 50 or more people. The arrest damages class consists of 70-131 people. Plaintiffs do \n16 \nnot know the identities of all of the class members.  \n17 \nii.   Questions of Law or Fact Prevail \n18 \n203.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class, in that the named \n19 \nplaintiffs claim that defendants’ unlawful indiscriminate use of force and threats of force \n20 \nat the San José demonstrations described herein, were based on San José Police \n21 \nDepartment policies and orders that were unlawful and chilled their First Amendment \n22  rights, including but not limited to unwarranted use of riot weapons including impact \n23  munitions, ‘flashbang’ and Stinger grenades, chemical weapons, batons, and physical \n24  violence by officers with their strikes, blows or kicks against protestors who did not pose \n25  a threat to officers, and unlawful curfews targeting protestors against racism and police \n26  violence.  \n27  204.  The questions of law and/or fact which predominate over any question affecting \n28  only individual members include, but are not limited to: \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 51 \n \n\n \n \n \n-  Whether defendants improperly declared an unlawful assembly or assemblies, \nwithout justification and without adequate sound amplification and without \n1 \nproviding directions, means, and opportunity to disperse before taking violent, \n2 \ninjurious and potentially deadly police action; \n3 \n-  Whether the curfew imposed was unjustified and unconstitutional;  \n4 \n-  Whether defendants used excessive force against the crowd, without regard to \n5 \nwhether the individuals against whom force was used were engaged in conduct \n6 \njustifying such force;  \n7 \n-  Whether defendants routinely used impact munitions and other force against \n8 \ndemonstrators and observers even though those people were not engaging in \n9 \nconduct justifying such force; \n10 \n-  Whether the officers who used force at the events in question were properly \n11 \ntrained in use of force standards and the proper use of the weapons they were \n12 \ngiven;  \n13 \n-  Whether when arresting people at these demonstrations, defendants routinely \n14 \nsubjected arrestees to prolonged detention in vehicles without all occupants \n15 \nbeing masked and without adequate ventilation for COVID-19 safety; \n16 \n-  Whether the length of the arrestees’ detention was excessive and whether it \n17 \nwas reasonable to transport them to distant malls to be released; \n18 \n-  Whether defendants were obligated to provide decontamination and medical \n19 \ntreatment to persons impacted by their chemical weapons, impact munitions \n20 \nand grenades; \n21 \n-  Whether defendants' motivation for the unlawful assembly declarations, \n22  curfew, use of force and arrests was to deprive participants of their First \n23  Amendment rights;  \n24  -  Whether defendants engaged in racial, content and viewpoint-discrimination;  \n25  -  Whether the defendants failed to accommodate disabled demonstrators by not \n26  providing them adequate opportunity and ability to avoid being subjected to \n27  use of force and arrest;  \n28 \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 52 \n \n\n \n \n \n-  Whether these actions violated the class members’ First, Fourth, and \nFourteenth amendment rights and their California analogues; \n1 \n-  Whether these actions violated the Americans with Disabilities Act; \n2 \n-  Did some or all of the conduct described above constitute a policy or custom of \n3 \ndefendant CITY OF SAN JOSÉ; \n4 \n-  Whether any individual defendants entitled to qualified immunity on the \n5 \nfederal claims; \n6 \n-  Whether any of the conduct alleged herein violated Cal. Civil Code, § 52.1; \n7 \n-  Whether general class wide damages are available to the Damages Classes; and \n8 \n-  Whether statutory damages under § 52.1 are available to the Damages Classes.  \n9 \n205.  By declaring unlawful assemblies and a curfew, ordering officers to use highly \n10 \ndangerous weapons on the crowd at the demonstrations, failing to adequate adequately \n11 \ntrain the officers given impact munitions and other dangerous weapons at the \n12 \ndemonstrations in the use of those weapons, failing to adequately respond to accusations \n13 \nof racism and Islamophobia within the SJPD and failing to adequately discipline and train \n14 \nofficers accused of excessive force, racist and Islamophobic misconduct, allowing a \n15 \nculture of violence, racism and Islamophobia to exist within the SJPD, and failing to \n16 \nadopt policies prohibiting race, religion, national origin, and viewpoint discrimination \n17 \nand use of excessive force. As further described above, defendants have acted on grounds \n18 \ngenerally applicable to the class, so that injunctive and declaratory relief is appropriate \n19 \nrespecting the class as a whole.  \n20 \n206.  The questions of law and fact common to the classes, which are outlined above, \n21 \npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members.  \n22  iii.  Typicality \n23  207.  The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class in that the \n24  named plaintiffs and class members claim that their First Amendment rights have been \n25  chilled by the same misconduct of defendants’ unlawful curfew law and related unlawful \n26  arrests, as well as the aggressive and unwarranted use of force, including batons, impact \n27  munitions, chemical agents, and grenades. Plaintiffs seek redress for the past violations of \n28  their rights and protection to bar the repeat of those violations in the future.  \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 53 \n \n\n \n \n \n208.  Thus, the named plaintiffs have the same interests and have suffered the same type \nof damages as the class members. The class representative plaintiffs’ claims are based \n1 \nupon the same or similar legal theories as the claims of the class members of each class. \n2 \nEach class member suffered actual damages as a result of being subjected to one or more \n3 \nof the violations enumerated above. The actual injuries suffered by the named plaintiffs \n4 \nare similar in type to the actual damages suffered by each class member although the \n5 \nseverity of those injuries may vary among class members. \n6 \n209.  The class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \n7 \nclass because they were subject to the unlawful law enforcement conduct complained of \n8 \nherein, and have no interests antagonistic to the class.  \n9 \niv.  Adequate Representation \n10 \n210.  The class representatives will fairly and adequately represent the common class \n11 \ninterest. The class representatives have a strong interest in achieving the relief requested \n12 \nin this Complaint, they have no conflicts with members of the plaintiff class, and they \n13 \nwill fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  \n14 \n211.  The class representatives are represented by counsel who are well-experienced in \n15 \nfederal civil rights class action litigation and are familiar with the issues in this case. \n16 \n212.  Counsel for the class representatives know of no conflicts among or between \n17 \nmembers of the class, the named plaintiffs, or the attorneys in this action.  \n18 \nv.   Maintenance and Superiority \n19 \n213.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(1)(A), the prosecution of separate \n20 \nactions by individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent or \n21 \nincompatible standards of conduct for the defendants, thereby making a class action the \n22  superior method of adjudicating the controversy.  \n23  214.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of separate \n24  actions by individual members of the classes would create a risk of adjudications with \n25  respect to individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, \n26  substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect \n27  their interests.  \n28  215.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(2), defendants have acted on grounds \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 54 \n \n\n \n \n \ngenerally applicable to the class.  \n216.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(3), the questions of law or fact \n1 \ncommon to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only \n2 \nindividual members, and this class action is superior to other available methods for the \n3 \nfair and efficient adjudication of the controversy between the parties. Plaintiffs are \n4 \ninformed and believe, and thereon allege, that the interests of class members in \n5 \nindividually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low in that most class \n6 \nmembers would be unable to individually prosecute any action at all. Plaintiffs are \n7 \ninformed and believe, and thereon allege, that the amounts at stake for individuals are \n8 \nsuch that separate suits would be impracticable in that most members of the class will not \n9 \nbe able to find counsel to represent them. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon \n10 \nallege, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the \n11 \nclaims arise in the same location, i.e., the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ. It will promote judicial \n12 \nefficiency to resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum rather than in \n13 \nmultiple courts.  \n14 \n217.  Plaintiffs do not know the identities of most class members. Plaintiffs are \n15 \ninformed and believe, and thereon allege, that the identities of the arrest class members \n16 \nare ascertainable from SJPD records. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon \n17 \nallege, that a significant number of direct force class members may be reached by the use \n18 \nof outreach efforts by organizations that participated in organizing the affected protests.  \n19 \n218.  Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that will be encountered in the management of this \n20 \nlitigation that would preclude its maintenance as a class action. Liability can be \n21 \ndetermined on a class-wide basis. Plaintiffs are informed and believe that defendants \n22  have little or no records or evidence of any kind justifying any use of force against \n23  individual demonstrators, and that defendants' only justifications for any use of force \n24  against peaceful participants is based on facts which apply to all the peaceful participants \n25  equally.  \n26  219.  General damages can also be determined through use of subclasses. \n27  220.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(3), class members must be furnished \n28  with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 55 \n \n\n \n \n \nmembers who can be identified through reasonable effort. Plaintiffs contemplate that \nindividual notice be given to class members at last known address by first class mail, \n1 \nemail, cell phone outreach, social media, and efforts of organizations that organized the \n2 \nprotests. Plaintiffs contemplate that the notice inform class members of the following \n3 \nregarding their damages claims: \n4 \na.  The pendency of the class action, and the issues common to the class; \n5 \nb.  The nature of the action; \n6 \nc.  Their right to ‘opt out’ of the action within a given time, in which event \n7 \nthey will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action; \n8 \nd.  Their right, if they do not ‘opt out,’ to be represented by their own counsel \n9 \nand enter an appearance in the case; otherwise, they will be represented by \n10 \nthe named plaintiffs and their counsel; and \n11 \ne.  Their right, if they do not ‘opt out,’ to share in any recovery in favor of the \n12 \nclass, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the common issues, \n13 \nadverse to the class. \n14 \n     \n15 \nVIII. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF  \n16 \nCOUNT ONE – INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n17  (First, Fourth And Fourteenth Amendments, 42 U.S.C. § 1983; California \nConstitution Articles 1 §§ 2, 3, 7, 13; Cal. Penal Code \n18 \n§ 835.5; Civil Code § 52.1; and Civil Code § 815.6) \n19   \n221.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate herein by reference the preceding paragraphs of \n20 \nthis Complaint. \n21 \n222.  The Defendants engaged in repeated, widespread violations of law, as outlined \n22 \nabove, over the course of at least several nights, using excessive force against hundreds if \n23 \nnot thousands of protestors in retaliation for their First Amendment activity; imposing a \n24 \ncurfew without accommodating the right to peaceable assembly and protest; declaring \n25 \nunlawful assemblies without adequate sound amplification and without providing \n26 \nadequate notice, means and opportunity to disperse before taking aggressive police action \n27 \nincluding the use of highly dangerous PIW, chemical weapons and explosive grenades; \n28 \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 56 \n \n\n \n \n \nhitting large numbers of protestors with batons, hands, grenades and/or PIW and using \nchemical weapons on them all with unreasonable and excessive force; failing to provide \n1 \nmedical aid or decontamination to persons defendants shot and/or teargassed; unlawfully \n2 \narresting and detaining 70 or more people and placing detainees at great risk of exposure \n3 \nto COVID-19 while on buses as described above; and targeting perceived people of color \n4 \nfor these civil rights violations. \n5 \n223.  The CITY, through GARCIA and the SJPD, has failed to train its officers in the \n6 \nconstitutional responses to demonstrations as revealed by the above allegations. \n7 \n224.   Without intervention by this Court, the plaintiffs, including the NAACP and \n8 \nSJPJC and the Injunctive Relief class members, who have participated, observed or \n9 \ndocumented protest activities and wish to do so in the future, particularly related to police \n10 \nviolence and racial justice, are at risk of having their rights violated in the future due to \n11 \nthe defendants’ demonstrated pattern of constitutional violations. The plaintiffs have no \n12 \nadequate remedy at law to protect the future lawful exercise of their constitutional rights, \n13 \nand, without action by this court, will suffer irreparable injury, thereby entitling them to \n14 \ninjunctive and declaratory relief. \n15 \n225.  The Defendants have acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to \n16 \nthe putative Injunctive Relief Class. Injunctive and declaratory relief for the class as a \n17 \nwhole is appropriate. \n18 \n226.  Defendants’ policies, practices, customs, conduct and acts alleged herein have \n19 \nresulted and will continue to result in irreparable injury to the plaintiffs, including but not \n20 \nlimited to violations of their constitutional and statutory rights. Plaintiffs have no plain, \n21 \nadequate or complete remedy at law to address the wrongs described herein. Plaintiffs \n22  intend in the future to exercise their constitutional rights of freedom of speech and \n23  association by engaging in demonstrations, observation and documentation of \n24  demonstrations and police actions, and other expressive activities in the CITY OF SAN \n25  JOSÉ. Defendants’ conduct described herein has created fear, anxiety and uncertainty \n26  among plaintiffs with respect to their exercise now and in the future of these \n27  constitutional rights. \n28  227.  Specifically, plaintiffs are concerned that if they participate in, observe or \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 57 \n \n\n \n \n \ndocument protest activities in the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ they will again be subjected to \nunreasonable and excessive force by CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers. \n1 \n228.  Plaintiffs are concerned that, when engaged in protest activities, Defendants will \n2 \nimpose curfews without accommodating or attempting to accommodate First Amendment \n3 \nrights; will not provide adequate notice of such curfews or in the event unlawful \n4 \nassemblies are declared; will not provide adequate means and opportunity to disperse; \n5 \nand will again employ indiscriminate, racially discriminatory, unreasonable or excessive \n6 \nforce, injuring and terrifying protestors. \n7 \n229.  Plaintiffs are also concerned that they will be wrongfully arrested and detained \n8 \nunder conditions that increase their risk of infection with COVID-19. \n9 \n230.  Plaintiffs therefore seek injunctive relief from this court to ensure that plaintiffs \n10 \nand persons similarly situated will not suffer violations of their rights from defendants’ \n11 \nillegal and unconstitutional policies, customs, and practices described herein. \n12 \n231.  Plaintiffs also seek injunctive relief in the form of an order requiring that \n13 \ndefendants seal and destroy and records derived from the arrests of the Arrest Damages \n14 \nClass, including fingerprints, photographs, and other identification and descriptive \n15 \ninformation, and all information, and biological samples and information obtained from \n16 \nsuch biological samples collected from the Arrest Damages Class, and identify to the \n17 \nArrest Damages Class all entities and agencies to which such information has been \n18 \ndisseminated; and that all such disseminated records be collected and destroyed.  \n19 \nCOUNT TWO – DECLARATORY RELIEF \n20 \n232.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \n21 \nComplaint. \n22  233.  An actual controversy exists between plaintiffs and defendants in that plaintiffs \n23  contend that the policies, practices and conduct of defendants alleged herein are unlawful \n24  and unconstitutional, whereas plaintiffs are informed and believe that defendants contend \n25  that said policies, practices and conduct are lawful and constitutional. Plaintiffs therefore \n26  seek a declaration of rights with respect to this controversy pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n27  2201-2202. \n28   \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 58 \n \n\n \n \n \nCOUNT THREE – 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nVIOLATION OF FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS \n1   \n234.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \n2 \nComplaint. \n3 \n235.  Plaintiffs’ association with the anti-police violence/racial justice demonstrations \n4 \nand observation and/or documentation of the police response were substantial and \n5 \nmotivating factors for the defendants use excessive force on all of the plaintiffs, and in \n6 \nthe case of CARTWRIGHT, LEE, SWIFT, NAEMEH and the Arrest Damages Class, \n7 \narrest them. The acts and/or omissions of the defendants, and each of them, individually \n8 \nand/or while acting in concert with one another, chilled the plaintiffs’ rights to freedom \n9 \nof speech, expression and association, under the First Amendment to the United States \n10 \nConstitution. \n11 \n236.  The curfew order also violated and chilled the plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights. \n12 \n237.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, the named plaintiffs, Direct Force \n13 \nDamages Class members, and Arrest Damages class members suffered damages as \n14 \nalleged above. \n15 \n238.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, and the potential that such conduct \n16 \nwill recur, the Injunctive Relief Class is entitled to relief from the potential that such \n17 \nviolations will recur.  \n18 \n239.  Wherefore, the plaintiffs pray for relief as hereinafter set forth. \n19 \nCOUNT FOUR - 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nEXCESSIVE FORCE – U.S. Const., 4th and 14th Amds. \n20 \n \n21 \n240.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \n22  Complaint. \n23  241.  The acts and/or omissions of the defendants, and each of them, individually and/or \n24  while acting in concert with one another, violated plaintiffs’ rights to be free from \n25  excessive force, under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \n26  Constitution. \n27  242.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, all of the named plaintiffs and the \n28  Direct Force Damages Class members suffered damages as alleged above. \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 59 \n \n\n \n \n \n243.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, and the potential that such conduct \nwill recur, the Injunctive Relief Class is entitled to relief from the potential that such \n1 \nviolations will recur.  \n2 \n244.  Wherefore, the plaintiffs pray for relief as hereinafter set forth. \n3 \nCOUNT FIVE –42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n4 \nWRONGFUL ARREST – U.S. Const., 4th and 14th Amds. \n5  (By Plaintiffs NAACP, SJPJC, CARTWRIGHT, LEE, SWIFT, NAEMEH, \nARREST DAMAGES CLASS, and INJUNCTIVE RELIEF CLASS against \n6 \nDefendants CITY OF SAN JOSÉ, SYKES, GARCIA, DWYER, AND DOES) \n \n7 \n245.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \n8 \nComplaint. \n9 \n246.   There was no probable cause to support the arrests of CARTWRIGHT, LEE, \n10 \nSWIFT, NAEMEH, and the ARREST DAMAGES CLASS. Therefore, the acts and/or \n11 \nomissions of the defendants, and each of them, individually and/or while acting in \n12 \nconcert with one another, violated plaintiffs’ rights to be free from wrongful arrest, under \n13 \nthe Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n14 \n247.  CARTWRIGHT, LEE, SWIFT, NAEMEH, and all of the Arrest Damages Class \n15 \nmembers were arrested on suspicion of misdemeanors consisting of failure to obey a \n16 \ncurfew, failure to disperse, failure to follow a lawful order of a police officer and/or \n17 \nunlawful assembly during the protests, and were placed on buses and driven to distant \n18 \nlocations where they were released. While held on buses or otherwise detained prior to \n19 \ntheir release, Arrest Damages Class members held in enclosed vehicles with people who \n20 \nwere not wearing masks, and the police removed masks from some of the plaintiffs and \n21 \nclass members. This significantly increased their risk of COVID-19 exposure because, \n22  even if they had previously been similarly distanced from others during outdoor protests, \n23  the risk of exposure is significantly greater in enclosed, unventilated spaces. \n24  248.  Defendants’ above-described conduct violated Arrest Class members’ rights to be \n25  free from unreasonable seizures under the Fourth Amendment and under the Fourteenth \n26  Amendment’s due process clause and the state constitutional analogues. \n27  249.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, Arrest Damages Class members \n28  suffered damages as alleged above. \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 60 \n \n\n \n \n \n250.

The named and DOE unidentified defendants subjected plaintiffs, many of whom \n8 \nare people of color, and all of whom were protesting anti-Black racist police violence and \n9 \nin support of the movement for Black lives, to excessive force and/or unlawful detention \n10 \nand arrest, and/or suppressed their right to freedom of speech and assembly, with \n11 \ndiscriminatory motive and intent, and racial animus toward each and every plaintiff \n12 \nindividually and as a group, either because of their identity and/or because of what they \n13 \nwere protesting, and therefore violated plaintiffs’ rights under the Equal Protection \n14 \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n15 \n254.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, all of the plaintiffs and damages \n16 \nclass members suffered damages as alleged above. \n17 \n255.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, and the potential that such conduct \n18 \nwill recur, the Injunctive Relief Class is entitled to relief from the potential that such \n19 \nviolations will recur.  \n20 \n256.  Wherefore, the plaintiffs pray for relief as hereinafter set forth. \n21 \nCOUNT SEVEN – 42 U.S.C. § 1982 \nFREEDOM OF MOVEMENT – U.S. Const., 4th, 9th and 14th Amds. \n22 \n(By Plaintiffs NAACP, SJPJC, ALEX LEE, SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT, the \n23  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF CLASS and the ARREST DAMAGES CLASS against \nDefendants CITY OF SAN JOSÉ, LICCARDO, SYKES, GARCIA and DOE CITY \n24 \nOF SAN JOSÉ POLICE OFFICERS) \n25   \n257.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \n26 \nComplaint. \n27 \n258.  The curfew order violated the plaintiffs’ constitutionally protected freedom of \n28 \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 61 \n \n\n \n \n \nmovement. “Citizens have a fundamental right of free movement, ‘historically part of the \namenities of life as we have known them.’” Nunez by Nunez v. City of San Diego, 114 \n1 \nF.3d 935, 944 (9th Cir. 1997) (internal citations omitted); United States v. Wheeler, 254 \n2 \nU.S. 281, 293 (1920). As discussed above, the curfew order was without lawful basis and \n3 \nwas not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. \n4 \n259.  Therefore, the acts and/or omissions of the defendants, and each of them, \n5 \nindividually and/or while acting in concert with one another, violated plaintiffs \n6 \nCARTWRIGHT, LEE, NAACP and SJPJC’s members and constituents, and the \n7 \nARREST DAMAGES CLASS members’ rights to freedom of movement under the Fifth, \n8 \nNinth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n9 \n260.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, CARTWRIGHT, LEE, and the arrest \n10 \ndamages class members suffered damages as alleged above. \n11 \n261.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, and the potential that such conduct \n12 \nwill recur, the Injunctive Relief Class is entitled to relief from the potential that such \n13 \nviolations will recur.  \n14 \n262.  Wherefore, the plaintiffs pray for relief as hereinafter set forth.  \n15 \nCOUNT EIGHT – 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n16  FAILURE TO INTERVENE \n(By All Plaintiffs against SYKES, GARCIA, DWYER, YUEN, CURRY, DELGADO \n17 \nand DOES) \n18   \n263.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \n19 \nComplaint. \n20 \n264.  During the events described above, the Defendants stood by without intervening to \n21 \nprevent the violations of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights heretofore alleged, even though \n22 \nthe violations occurred in plain view of numerous CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers \n23 \nand all of the Police Defendants had the opportunity and duty to do so. \n24 \n265.  Defendants’ failure to intervene was caused in part by the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ’s, \n25 \nSYKES and GARCIA’s failure to provide adequate policies and training requiring CITY \n26 \nOF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers to intervene in and report excessive force by other officers \n27 \nwhen they are present and observe it. \n28 \n266.  The misconduct described in this Count was objectively unreasonable and was \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 62 \n \n\n \n \n \nundertaken intentionally, with malice and knowing disregard for Plaintiffs’ clearly \nestablished constitutional rights. \n1 \n267.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, all of the plaintiffs and damages \n2 \nclass members suffered damages as alleged above. \n3 \n268.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, and the potential that such conduct \n4 \nwill recur, the Injunctive Relief Class is entitled to relief from the potential that such \n5 \nviolations will recur.  \n6 \n269.  Wherefore, the plaintiffs pray for relief as hereinafter set forth.  \n7 \n \n8 \nCOUNT NINE – 42 U.S.C. § 1983  \n9  CONSPIRACY TO DEPRIVE PLAINTIFFS OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL \nRIGHTS \n10 \n  \n11  270.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \n12  Complaint. \n13  271.  Count Nine is alleged against all Defendants. \n14  272.  Defendants CITY OF SAN JOSÉ, DAVID SYKES, SAM LICCARDO, \n15  EDGARDO GARCIA; JASON DWYER; JARED YUEN; SEAN MICHAEL CURRY, \n16  OFFICER FNU DELGADO, and each of the as yet unidentified DOE defendants, acted \n17  in concert with each other and conspired by concerted action to accomplish an unlawful \n18  purpose by unlawful means. \n19  273.  EDGARDO GARCIA; JASON DWYER; JARED YUEN; SEAN MICHAEL \nCURRY, OFFICER FNU DELGADO, and DOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers, \n20 \nand each of them, took concrete steps to enter into an agreement to unlawfully use \n21 \nexcessive force on all Plaintiffs without notice or cause, and to detain and arrest certain \n22 \nPlaintiffs, knowing they lacked reasonable suspicion and/or probable cause to do so, and \n23 \nfor the purpose of violating Plaintiffs’ First, Fourth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendment \n24 \nrights. \n25 \n274.   Defendants CITY OF SAN JOSÉ, SYKES, and LICCARDO took concrete steps \n26 \nto enter into an agreement with GARCIA, DWYER, YUEN, CURRY, DELGADO and \n27 \nDOES to retroactively justify and cover-up GARCIA, DWYER, YUEN, CURRY, \n28 \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 63 \n \n\n \n \n \nDELGADO and DOES’ unwarranted use of excessive force on all Plaintiffs and to \nunlawfully detain and arrest certain Plaintiffs for the purpose of violating Plaintiffs’ First, \n1 \nFourth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. \n2 \n275.  In furtherance of this conspiracy, DWYER, YUEN, CURRY, DELGADO and \n3 \nDOES committed specific overt acts, misusing their police powers for the purpose of \n4 \nviolating Plaintiff’s rights. They accomplished this goal by using unwarranted, excessive \n5 \nforce on all Plaintiffs, including, but not limited to, using flashbang and stinger grenades \n6 \nto break up lawful demonstrations, shooting at individual protestors with impact \n7 \nmunitions at close range, and releasing teargas into lawful crowds without notice. \n8 \nDefendants also unlawfully arrested certain Plaintiffs knowing they lacked reasonable \n9 \nsuspicion and/or probable cause to do so. \n10 \n276.  Defendants CITY OF SAN JOSÉ, SYKES, LICCARDO and GARCIA committed \n11 \nadditional specific overt acts, misusing their powers as high-ranking city officials for the \n12 \npurpose of violating Plaintiff’s rights. They accomplished this goal by issuing an \n13 \nunconstitutional curfew order without adequate notice and directing DWYER, YUEN, \n14 \nCURRY, DELGADO and DOES to enforce the order against Plaintiffs. Further, they \n15 \ncovered-up DWYER, YUEN, CURRY, DELGADO and DOES’ constitutional violations \n16 \nof Plaintiffs’ rights by knowingly issuing an After Action Report which was purposely \n17 \nmisleading as to the number of injuries to protestors at the hands of DWYER, YUEN, \n18 \nCURRY, DELGADO and DOES , and falsely claiming that they were reacting to the \n19 \nreport of a murder of a federal officer at a protest, which has since been proven to be \n20 \nunrelated to the protests, and more notably, had not been issued prior to Defendant CITY \n21 \nOF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers’ violent actions. \n22  277.  Each individual named and unknown Defendant is therefore liable for the \n23  violation of Plaintiffs’ rights by any other individual Defendant. \n24  278.  As a direct and proximate result of the result of the Defendants’ conspiracy, \n25  Plaintiffs suffered damages as alleged above. \n26  279.  Wherefore, the plaintiffs pray for relief as hereinafter set forth. \n27   \n \n28 \n \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 64 \n \n\n \n \n \nCOUNT TEN – 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq. \nVIOLATION OF TITLE II OF THE A.D.A. \n1   \n280.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \n2 \nComplaint. \n3 \n281.  The Americans with Disabilities Act and its implementing regulations provide that \n4 \n“no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded \n5 \nfrom participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a \n6 \npublic entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132; \n7 \n28 C.F.R. § 35.149. Title II’s requirements extend to “anything a public entity does,” \n8 \nincluding arrests and other law enforcement interactions. 8 C.F.R. § 35, app. B. Despite \n9 \nthese requirements, Defendants violated the ADA and its implementing regulations in \n10 \nmultiple ways. \n11 \n282.  Defendants have an affirmative obligation to make benefits, services, and \n12 \nprograms accessible to people with disabilities. § 35.150. “The general regulatory \n13 \nobligation to modify policies, practices, or procedures requires law enforcement to make \n14 \nchanges in policies that result in discriminatory arrests or abuse of individuals with \n15 \ndisabilities.” 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, app. B. Defendants, however, have failed to make \n16 \nreasonable modifications that will make law enforcement’s actions equally accessible to \n17 \npeople with disabilities; indeed, their responses to protests actively deny people with \n18 \ndisabilities their rights at protests. \n19 \n283.  Title II protects people with disabilities against facially neutral policies that \n20 \nburden people with disabilities more than others, by requiring that the public entity \n21 \nprovide reasonable modifications to avoid the discrimination unless the public entity can \n22  demonstrate that such modifications would result in a fundamental alteration of the \n23  program. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7); Crowder v. Kitagaw, 81 F. 3d 1480 (9th Cir. 1996). \n24  284.   Defendants’ use of teargas, pepper balls, and other chemical irritants poses a \n25  significant risk of harm or death for people with respiratory and inflammatory conditions. \n26  285.  The lack of clear egress routes for dispersal, and barriers to egress erected by \n27  Defendants, violate the rights of people with disabilities who are forced to risk stampedes \n28  and trampling from other protesters, law enforcement force, and other grievous harm. \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 65 \n \n\n \n \n \n286.  The lack of clear and consistent directions likewise puts Plaintiffs, including those \nwith mobility impairments, at significant risk of harm, arrest, and violence. \n1 \n287.  Defendants subjected Plaintiff SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT to use of force and \n2 \narrest because they mistake Plaintiffs’ inaction, delayed action, or slowed action in \n3 \nresponse to orders to disperse and other commands as a refusal to comply.  \n4 \n288.  Further, Defendants’ crowd management directives and other measures constitute \n5 \nprograms and/or activities under the ADA. By failing to establish crowd management \n6 \nmeasures that permit protesters with disabilities an opportunity to avoid harm by police, \n7 \nDefendants have denied those people with disabilities meaningful access to their crowd \n8 \nmanagement program/activity. \n9 \n289.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C § 12133, Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory and injunctive \n10 \nrelief as well as damages and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. \n11 \nCOUNT ELEVEN – 29 U.S.C. §§ 794 et seq. \n12  VIOLATION OF SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT \n(Against All Defendants) \n13 \n290.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \n14 \nComplaint. \n15 \n291.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”) and its implementing \n16 \nregulations provide that “[N]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, \n17 \nsolely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied \n18 \nthe benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving \n19 \nfederal financial assistance . . .” 29 U.S.C. § 794. Defendants violate Section 504 in \n20 \nmultiple ways. A “program or activity” means “all of the operations of a department, \n21 \nagency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or of a local \n22 \ngovernment, or the entity of such State or local government that distributes such \n23 \nassistance and each such department or agency (and each other State or local government \n24 \nentity) to which the assistance is extended, in the case of assistance to a State or local \n25 \ngovernment.” 29 U.S.C. 794(b)(1)(A), (B).  \n26 \n292.  Section 504 regulations prohibit discrimination by a recipient of federal funds by \n27 \ndenying a qualified person with a disability the opportunity to participate in or benefit \n28 \nfrom the aid, benefit, or service. 34 C.F.R. § 104.4(1)(i). \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 66 \n \n\n \n \n \n293.  Section 504 regulations prohibit discrimination by a recipient of federal funds by \naffording a qualified person with a disability an opportunity to participate in and benefit \n1 \nfrom the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others. 34 C.F.R. § \n2 \n104.4.(1)(ii). \n3 \n294.  Section 504 regulations prohibit discrimination by a recipient of federal funds by \n4 \naffording a qualified person with a disability an opportunity to participate in and benefit \n5 \nfrom the aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective as that provided others. 34 C.F.R. \n6 \n§ 104.4.(1)(iii). \n7 \n295.  Section 504 regulations prohibit discrimination by a recipient of federal funds by \n8 \n“providing significant assistance to an agency, organization, or person that discriminates \n9 \non the basis of [disability] in providing any aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the \n10 \nrecipients’ program or activity.” 34 C.F.R. § 104.4(1)(v). \n11 \n296.  Section 504 regulations prohibit discrimination by a recipient of federal funds by \n12 \nutilizing “criteria or methods of administration that have the effect of subjecting qualified \n13 \n[persons with disabilities] to discrimination on the basis of [disability].” 34 C.F.R. § \n14 \n104.4(4). \n15 \n297.  Section 504 regulations require that recipients of federal financial assistance “shall \n16 \ntake appropriate steps to ensure that communications with their . . . beneficiaries are \n17 \navailable to persons with impaired vision and hearing.” 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(e). \n18 \n298.  Plaintiffs are otherwise qualified to participate in the services, programs, or \n19 \nactivities that are provided to individuals by Defendants. 29 U.S.C. § 794(b).  \n20 \n299.  Defendants all receive federal financial assistance. \n21 \n300.  Through the acts and omissions described above, Defendants and their agents and \n22  employees have and continue to violate the Rehabilitation Act and the regulations \n23  promulgated thereunder by excluding Plaintiffs from participation in, denying Plaintiffs \n24  the benefits of, and subjecting Plaintiffs based solely by reason of their disability to, \n25  discrimination in Defendants’ services and activities in managing and regulating protests \n26  in San Jose. \n27  301.  Defendants’ use of teargas, pepper balls, and other chemical irritants poses a \n28  significant risk of harm or death for people with respiratory and inflammatory conditions. \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 67 \n \n\n \n \n \n302.  The lack of clear egress routes for dispersal, and barriers to egress erected by \nDefendants, violate the rights of people with disabilities who are forced to risk stampedes \n1 \nand trampling from other protesters, law enforcement force, and other grievous harm. \n2 \n303.  The lack of clear and consistent directions likewise puts Plaintiffs, including those \n3 \nwith mobility impairments, at significant risk of harm, arrest, and violence. \n4 \n304.  Defendants subjected Plaintiff SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT to use of force and \n5 \narrest because they mistake Plaintiffs’ inaction, delayed action, or slowed action in \n6 \nresponse to orders to disperse and other commands as a refusal to comply.  \n7 \n305.  Further, Defendants’ crowd management directives and other measures constitute \n8 \nprograms and/or activities under the Rehabilitation Act. By failing to establish crowd \n9 \nmanagement measures that permit protesters with disabilities an opportunity to avoid \n10 \nharm by police, Defendants have denied those people with disabilities meaningful access \n11 \nto their crowd management program/activity. \n12 \n306.  As set forth above, Defendants have failed to satisfy their affirmative obligation to \n13 \nprovide reasonable modifications and auxiliary aids and services that provide equal \n14 \naccess, with or without a specific request from a person with a disability.  \n15 \n307.  Defendants' failure to provide reasonable modifications was with deliberate \n16 \nindifference and reckless disregard to the rights of Plaintiffs. \n17 \n308.  Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory and injunctive \n18 \nrelief as well as damages and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.  \n19 \n \n20 \nCOUNT TWELVE – Cal. Civ. Code, § 52.1 \nVIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA BANE ACT \n21 \n \n22  309.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \n23  Complaint. \n24  310.  The acts and/or omissions of the defendants, and each of them, individually and/or \n25  while acting in concert with one another, constituted interference, and attempted \n26  interference, by threats, intimidation and coercion, with plaintiffs’ peaceable exercise and \n27  enjoyment of rights secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States and the \n28  State of California, in violation of California Civil Code § 52.1. \n \nCOMPLAINT\tNAACP,\tet\tal.,\tv.\tCITY\tOF\tSAN\tJOSÉ\t 68 \n \n\n \n \n \n311.

As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, and the potential that such conduct \n2 \nwill recur, the Injunctive Relief Class is entitled to relief from the potential that such \n3 \nviolations will recur.  \n4 \n313.  Wherefore, the plaintiffs pray for relief as hereinafter set forth. \n5 \nCOUNT THIRTEEN – Cal. Civ. Code, § 51.7 \n6 \nVIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA RALPH ACT \n \n7 \n314.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \n8 \nComplaint. \n9 \n315.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe bias against Plaintiffs’ perceived political \n10 \naffiliation with the protest against police violence and police racism, and bias against \n11 \nplaintiffs’ perceived race, national origin, and/or religion, were motivating reasons for the \n12 \ndefendants’ above-described misconduct toward them. \n13 \n316.  Defendants' above-described conduct violated plaintiffs’ rights to be free from \n14 \nviolence and intimidation by threat of violence because of their actual or perceived \n15 \npolitical affiliation and/or viewpoint, in violation of California Civil Code § 51.7. \n16 \n317.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, all of the plaintiffs and damages \n17 \nclass members suffered damages as alleged above. \n18 \n318.

JUDGMENT \n8   \nCITY OF SAN JOSE, et al.,  Re: Dkt. No. 121 \n9 \nDefendants. \n10   \n \n11    \n a  12  Defendants’ motion for summary judgment came on for hearing on June 1, 2023.  \nurtni\noor 13  Plaintiffs appeared through their counsel, Rachel Lederman, Chris Johnson, and Robert \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  Flynn.  Defendants appeared through their counsel, Matthew Pritchard.  Having read the \nDict  15  papers filed by the parties and carefully considered their arguments and relevant \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  authority, and good cause appearing, the court hereby rules as follows. \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  BACKGROUND \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18    This is a civil rights case arising out of the May 2020 protests in response to the \nN\n19  killing of George Floyd by police.  Specifically, on May 29 and 30, 2020, plaintiffs \n20  participated in protests in San Jose to “express their view that police brutality and \n21  institutionalized racism must end,” and now “seek redress for the violation of their \n22  constitutional rights to assemble, protest, and be free from racial discrimination, disability \n23  discrimination, [and] excessive force.”  Dkt. 108, ¶¶ 2, 3. \n24    There are two organizational plaintiffs and eleven individual plaintiffs in this case.  \n25  The organizational plaintiffs are (1) the National Association for the Advancement of \n26  Colored People of San Jose/Silicon Valley, and (2) the San Jose Peace and Justice \n27  Center.  Dkt. 108, ¶¶ 14-15.  The eleven individual plaintiffs are as follows: \n28     The first plaintiff is Michael Acosta.  The complaint alleges that Acosta was shot in \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 2 of 34\n \n1  the eye with projectile impact weapons (“PIW”).  Dkt. 108, ¶ 16.  He ultimately lost vision \n2  in his eye, and his eye globe had to be removed.  Id., ¶  95. \n3    The second plaintiff is Joseph Maldonado.  The complaint alleges that he was shot \n4  with teargas while at the protests.  Dkt. 108, ¶ 17. \n5  The third plaintiff is Mahmoudreza Naemeh.  The complaint alleges that he was \n6  shot with PIW and pushed to the ground.  Dkt. 108, ¶ 18.   \n7  The fourth plaintiff is Megan Swift.  The complaint alleges that she was clubbed \n8  while at the protests.  Dkt. 108, ¶ 19.   \n9    The fifth plaintiff is Joseph Cañas.  The complaint alleges that Cañas was at the \n10  protest on May 29, 2020, playing a guitar, when he was shot in the eye by an impact \n11  munition.  Dkt. 108, ¶ 20.   \n a  12    The sixth plaintiff is Leslie Vasquez.  The complaint alleges that Vasquez attended \nurtni\noor 13  the May 29, 2020 protest and was shot in the groin, thighs, and genital area, and \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  bludgeoned in the stomach with a baton as she stood with her hands up.  Dkt. 108, ¶ 21.   \nDict  15    The seventh plaintiff is Peter Allen.  Dkt. 108, ¶ 22.  The complaint alleges that \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  Allen attended the protest on May 29, 2020, and was pushed to the ground and \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  repeatedly shot with impact munitions.  Allen alleges that he was backing away when he \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  was shoved to the ground by an officer with his baton, then shoved to the ground again \nN\n19  when he tried to get up and back away.  Id., ¶ 111.  Allen alleges that he was again \n20  attempting to retreat when he was shot in the thigh and in the chest with PIW.  Id., ¶ 112-\n21  113.   \n22    The eighth plaintiff is Shaunn Cartwright.  The complaint alleges that Cartwright \n23  was shot in the knee, calf, and finger with PIW on May 30, 2020.  Dkt. 108, ¶ 23.   \n24    The ninth plaintiff is Yessica Riles.  Dkt. 108, ¶ 24.  The complaint alleges that \n25  Riles was shot with PIW in the abdomen while her hands were up in a ‘don’t shoot’ \n26  gesture.  Id., ¶ 78.   \n27    The tenth plaintiff is Gustavo Flores Rodriguez (also referred to as Gustavo \n28  Flores).  Dkt. 108, ¶ 25.  The complaint alleges that Flores was present at the May 29, \n2 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 3 of 34\n \n1  2020 protest, and “tried to warn the other demonstrators, walking down the front line of \n2  demonstrators suggesting that they put their hands up in a gesture of ‘don’t shoot’ to \n3  show they were unarmed [and] did not pose a threat.”  Id., ¶ 82.  While Flores was doing \n4  so,  a San Jose police officer “shot him in the groin and testicle with an impact munition.”  \n5  Id.  Flores fell to the ground, and as he got up, he saw the officer reloading his gun.  Id., ¶ \n6  83.  As Flores was trying to walk away, someone warned that the officer was aiming at \n7  him again, and when Flores turned to look, the officer shot him in his left collarbone with \n8  another impact munition.  Id. \n9  The eleventh plaintiff is Cindy Cuellar.  Dkt. 108, ¶ 28.  The complaint alleges that \n10  Cuellar attended the May 29, 2020 protest and saw officers “shoot impact munitions into \n11  the crowd,” hitting a friend of hers who is a journalist.  Id., ¶ 71.  When Cuellar went to \n a  12  her friend’s aid, an officer shot her in her left calf.  Id. \nurtni\noor 13    The defendants are as follows:  the City of San Jose, Edgardo Garcia (police chief \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  of the SJPD), Christopher Knopf (SJPD assistant chief of police), Jason Dwyer (SJPD \nDict  15  captain and the ‘special operations commander’ during the May 2020 protests), Brian \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  Matchett (SJPD lieutenant), Steve Lagorio (SJPD lieutenant), Lee Tassio (SJPD \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  sergeant), Ronnie Lopez (SJPD sergeant), John Lynch (SJPD sergeant), Jaren Yuen \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  (SJPD officer), Bill Nguyen (SJPD officer), Clifford Grodin (SJPD officer), Stephen \nN\n19  Michael Curry (SJPD officer), Michael Simonini (SJPD officer), Victor Ayala (SJPD \n20  officer), James Adgar (SJPD officer), Steve Gaona (SJPD officer), Tyler Moran (SJPD \n21  officer), Larry Situ (SJPD officer), and Frank Orabuena (SJPD officer).1     \n22    The complaint purports to assert eleven causes of action, though the first is for \n23  “injunctive relief” and the second is for “declaratory relief,” which are types of remedies \n24  rather than standalone causes of action.  That leaves nine substantive causes of action:  \n25  (1) violation of First Amendment rights under section 1983, asserted by all \n26 \n \n27 \n1 The complaint also names city manager David Sykes as a defendant, but defendants’ \nmotion explains that Sykes was sued only in his official capacity, making the claims \n28 \nagainst him functionally the same as the claims against the city.  See Dkt. 121 at 20, n.1.   \n3 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 4 of 34\n \n1  plaintiffs against all defendants; \n2     (2) excessive force in violation of Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, under \n3  section 1983, asserted by all plaintiffs against defendants City of San Jose, Garcia, \n4  Knopf, Dwyer, Matchett, and Tassio; and further asserted by plaintiff Acosta against \n5  defendants Yuen, Nguyen, Grodin, Lopez, and Lynch; by plaintiff Naemeh against \n6  defendants Orabuena, Weber, Situ, and Lopez; by plaintiff Swift against defendants \n7  Curry, Silva, and Ayala; by plaintiff Cañas against defendants Yuen and Lopez; by \n8  plaintiff Vasquez against defendants Yuen, Simonini, and Lopez; by plaintiff Allen against \n9  defendants Yuen and Lopez; by plaintiff Riles against defendant Simonini; by plaintiff \n10  Flores against defendants Gaona and Grodin; by plaintiff Cuellar against defendants \n11  Simonini, Adgar, Nguyen, Grodin, Moran, and Lynch; and by plaintiff Maldonado against \n a  12  defendant Lagorio;  \nurtni\noor 13  (3) failure to intervene under section 1983, asserted by all plaintiffs against all \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  defendants; \nDict  15  (4) violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, asserted by plaintiff \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  Cartwright against defendant City of San Jose; \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  (5) violation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, asserted by plaintiff Cartwright \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  against defendant City of San Jose; \nN\n19  (6) violation of the California Bane Act, asserted by all plaintiffs against all \n20  defendants; \n21  (7) violation of the California Ralph Act, asserted by all plaintiffs against \n22  defendants City of San Jose, Garcia, Knopf, Dwyer, Matchett, and Tassio; and further \n23  asserted by plaintiff Acosta against defendants Yuen, Nguyen, Grodin, Lopez, and Lynch; \n24  by plaintiff Naemeh against defendants Orabuena, Weber, Situ, and Lopez; by plaintiff \n25  Swift against defendants Curry, Silva, and Ayala; by plaintiff Cañas against defendants \n26  Yuen and Lopez; by plaintiff Vasquez against defendants Yuen, Simonini, and Lopez; by \n27  plaintiff Allen against defendants Yuen and Lopez; by plaintiff Riles against defendant \n28  Simonini; by plaintiff Flores against defendants Gaona and Grodin; by plaintiff Cuellar \n4 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 5 of 34\n \n1  against defendants Simonini, Adgar, Nguyen, Grodin, Moran, and Lynch; and by plaintiff \n2  Maldonado against defendant Lagorio; \n3  (8) assault and battery, asserted by all plaintiffs against defendants City of San \n4  Jose, Garcia, Knopf, Dwyer, Matchett, and Tassio; and further asserted by plaintiff \n5  Acosta against defendants Yuen, Nguyen, Grodin, Lopez, and Lynch; by plaintiff Naemeh \n6  against defendants Orabuena, Weber, Situ, and Lopez; by plaintiff Swift against \n7  defendants Curry, Silva, and Ayala; by plaintiff Cañas against defendants Yuen and \n8  Lopez; by plaintiff Vasquez against defendants Yuen, Simonini, and Lopez; by plaintiff \n9  Allen against defendants Yuen and Lopez; by plaintiff Riles against defendant Simonini; \n10  by plaintiff Flores against defendants Gaona and Grodin; by plaintiff Cuellar against \n11  defendants Simonini, Adgar, Nguyen, Grodin, Moran, and Lynch; and by plaintiff \n a  12  Maldonado against defendant Lagorio; and \nurtni\noor 13  (9) negligence, asserted by all plaintiffs against defendants City of San Jose, \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  Garcia, Knopf, Dwyer, Matchett, and Tassio; and further asserted by plaintiff Acosta \nDict  15  against defendants Yuen, Nguyen, Grodin, Lopez, and Lynch; by plaintiff Naemeh \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  against defendants Orabuena, Weber, Situ, and Lopez; by plaintiff Swift against \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  defendants Curry, Silva, and Ayala; by plaintiff Cañas against defendants Yuen and \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  Lopez; by plaintiff Vasquez against defendants Yuen, Simonini, and Lopez; by plaintiff \nN\n19  Allen against defendants Yuen and Lopez; by plaintiff Riles against defendant Simonini; \n20  by plaintiff Flores against defendants Gaona and Grodin; by plaintiff Cuellar against \n21  defendants Simonini, Adgar, Nguyen, Grodin, Moran, and Lynch; and by plaintiff \n22  Maldonado against defendant Lagorio.  See Dkt. 108, ¶¶ 206-284.  \n23    Defendants now move for summary judgment on all claims.   \n24  DISCUSSION \n25  A.  Legal standard \n26  Summary judgment is proper where the pleadings, discovery, and affidavits show \n27  that there is “no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to \n28  judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  Material facts are those which may \n5 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 6 of 34\n \n1  affect the outcome of the case.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 \n2  (1986).  A dispute as to a material fact is genuine if there is sufficient evidence for a \n3  reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.  Id.  “A ‘scintilla of evidence,’ \n4  or evidence that is ‘merely colorable’ or ‘not significantly probative,’ is not sufficient to \n5  present a genuine issue as to a material fact.”  United Steelworkers of Am. v. Phelps \n6  Dodge Corp., 865 F.2d 1539, 1542 (9th Cir. 1989) (citation omitted). \n7  Courts recognize two ways for a moving defendant to show the absence of \n8  genuine dispute of material fact: (1) proffer evidence affirmatively negating any element \n9  of the challenged claim and (2) identify the absence of evidence necessary for plaintiff to \n10  substantiate such claim.  Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Cos., 210 F.3d 1099, \n11  1102 (9th Cir. 2000) (“In order to carry its burden of production, the moving party must \n a  12  either produce evidence negating an essential element of the nonmoving party's claim or \nurtni\noor 13  defense or show that the nonmoving party does not have enough evidence of an \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  essential element to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial.”)   \nDict  15  “Once the moving party meets its initial burden, the nonmoving party must go \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  beyond the pleadings and, by its own affidavits or by the depositions, answers to \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  interrogatories, and admissions on file, come forth with specific facts to show that a \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  genuine issue of material fact exists.”  Hansen v. United States, 7 F.3d 137, 138 (9th Cir. \nN\n19  1993) (per curiam).  “When the nonmoving party relies only on its own affidavits to \n20  oppose summary judgment, it cannot rely on conclusory allegations unsupported by \n21  factual data to create an issue of material fact.”  Id.   \n22  The court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \n23  party: if evidence produced by the moving party conflicts with evidence produced by the \n24  nonmoving party, the judge must assume the truth of the evidence set forth by the \n25  nonmoving party with respect to that fact.  See Tolan v. Cotton, 134 S. Ct. 1861, 1865 \n26  (2014); Leslie v. Grupo ICA, 198 F.3d 1152, 1158 (9th Cir. 1999).  However, when a non-\n27  moving party fails to produce evidence rebutting defendants’ showing, then an order for \n28  summary adjudication is proper.  Nissan Fire, 210 F.3d at 1103 (“If the nonmoving party \n6 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 7 of 34\n \n1  fails to produce enough evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact, the moving \n2  party wins the motion for summary judgment.”) \n3  B.  Analysis \n4    As an organizational matter, the court starts its analysis with the plaintiffs’ Fourth \n5  Amendment claims for excessive force, as resolution of those claims will serve to guide \n6  the resolution of the remaining claims.     \n7    Defendants’ motion makes a number of different arguments as to the Fourth \n8  Amendment claims, some of which are applicable to all plaintiffs as a whole, and some of \n9  which are applicable only to certain plaintiffs.  In their reply, defendants include a chart \n10  that summarizes their arguments as to each plaintiff.  See Dkt. 140 at 18.  The chart \n11  shows that, as to all plaintiffs, defendants argue that there was “no objective intent to \n a  12  restrain,” and thus no possible Fourth Amendment violation.  Stated differently, \nurtni\noor 13  defendants argue that any force used by officers was used with the “intent to disperse” \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  rather than the “intent to restrain.”   \nDict  15    However, the Ninth Circuit in Nelson v. City of Davis has already addressed this \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  very same argument, and has rejected the approach advocated by defendants.  685 F.3d \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  867 (9th Cir. 2012).   \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18    Nelson involved police attempting to clear a college-town party by shooting \nN\n19  pepper-ball projectiles at the partygoers.  This is the relevant passage from Nelson: \n \n20 \nThe officers also argue that their actions could not constitute a seizure \nbecause their intent was to disperse the crowd.  The Supreme Court has \n21 \nrepeatedly held that the Fourth Amendment analysis is not a subjective \n22  one.  “The intent that counts under the Fourth Amendment is the intent \n[that] has been conveyed to the person confronted, and the criterion of \n23  willful restriction on freedom of movement is no invitation to look to \nsubjective intent when determining who is seized.”  \n24 \n… \n25 \n \nWhether the officers intended to encourage the partygoers to disperse is of \n26 \nno importance when determining whether a seizure occurred. The officers \n27  took aim and fired their weapons towards Nelson and his associates.  \nRegardless of their motives, their application of force was a knowing and \n28 \nwillful act that terminated Nelson’s freedom of movement. It unquestionably \n7 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 8 of 34\n \nconstituted a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. \n1 \n685 F.3d at 877-88 (internal citations omitted). \n2 \n  The logic of Nelson applies with equal force to the present case.  Defendants \n3 \nclaim that they intended to encourage the protestors to disperse, but under Nelson, this is \n4 \nof “no importance,” because they “took aim and fired their weapons towards” the plaintiffs \n5 \nand their fellow protestors, which was a “knowing and willful act that terminated [their] \n6 \nfreedom of movement . . . regardless of their motives.”  685 F.3d at 877. \n7 \n  To the extent that defendants rely on the Ninth Circuit’s unpublished and non-\n8 \nprecedential decision in Jackson-Moeser v. Armstrong, 765 Fed. App’x 299 (2019), or on \n9 \nthe Supreme Court’s decision in Torres v. Madrid, those decisions do not change the \n10 \nanalysis.  In particular, the Torres Court addressed only the issue of whether a plaintiff \n11 \nwho eludes custody can be deemed “seized,” and made clear that “we rarely probe the \n a  12 \nurtni subjective motivations of police officers in the Fourth Amendment context.”  141 S.Ct. \noor 13 \nCf\nt ali 989, 998 (2021).  Instead, the Fourth Amendment analysis is an objective one, and looks \ncC\nstriof  14  to whether the “nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual’s Fourth Amendment \nDict  15 \ns ri\net interests” is balanced against the “countervailing government interests.”  Graham v. \ns\natDi 16 \nt\nSn  Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395 (1989).  In evaluating the government’s interest, courts look at \nd er 17 \ne\nh\nnitrt (1) the severity of the crime at issue, (2) whether the suspect posed an immediate threat \nUo 18 \nN\nto the safety of the officers or others, and (3) whether the suspect was actively resisting \n19 \narrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.  Young v. City of Los Angeles, 655 F.3d \n20 \n1156, 1163 (9th Cir. 2011). \n21 \n   The court now turns to the Fourth Amendment claims brought by each individual \n22 \nplaintiff.   \n23 \n  1.  Acosta \n24 \n  The complaint asserts Acosta’s excessive force claim against Yuen, Nguyen, and \n25 \nGrodin (and the supervisory defendants and City, who will be discussed later in the \n26 \norder).   \n27 \n  In addition to the “no intent to restrain” argument that was addressed above, \n28 \n8 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 9 of 34\n \n1  defendants make three additional arguments as to Acosta: (1) the force used against him \n2  was accidental, rather than intentional, (2) there is no proof of causation as to the named \n3  defendants, and (3) the force was reasonable under the circumstances.   \n4    As to (1), defendants’ argument is that Acosta was not individually targeted as the \n5  subject of force.  This argument was directly addressed by the Nelson court: \n6  Regardless of whether Nelson was the specific object of governmental \nforce, he and his fellow students were the undifferentiated objects of shots \n7  intentionally fired by the officers in the direction of that group.  Although the \nofficers may have intended that the projectiles explode over the students’ \n8 \nheads or against a wall, the officers’ conduct resulted in Nelson being hit by \na projectile that they intentionally fired towards a group of which he was a \n9 \nmember.  Their conduct was intentional, it was aimed towards Nelson and \n10  his group, and it resulted in the application of physical force to Nelson’s \nperson as well as the termination of his movement.  Nelson was therefore \n11  intentionally seized under the Fourth Amendment. \n a  12  685 F.3d at 877.   \nurtni\noor 13    Nelson also relied on Supreme Court case law holding that “the intentionality \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  requirement is satisfied when the ‘termination of freedom of movement [occurs] through \nDict  15  means intentionally applied.’”  Id. at 876 (citing Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U.S. at 597 \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  (emphasis in original)). \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17    Applying Nelson, the court concludes that defendants are not entitled to summary \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  judgment based on the argument that Acosta was struck unintentionally.   \nN\n19    Next is (2), the argument that Acosta does not have proof of causation as to the \n20  named defendants.  Defendants argue that the video evidence does not make clear \n21  which of the three defendants is the one who fired the shot that hit Acosta, and thus \n22  argue that summary judgment should be granted in favor of all three.  \n23    Plaintiffs, on the other hand, cite to Grandstaff v. City of Borger, Tex., a case \n24  where four officers fired towards the decedent, and where the government made the \n25  same argument as the defendants in this case – that no single officer could be found to \n26  be the person who fired the fatal shot.  The Grandstaff court held that “they may as well \n27  argue that no one on a firing squad is responsible for the victim’s death unless we know \n28  whose bullet first struck the heart.”  767 F.2d 161, 168 (5th Cir. 1985).  Although \n9 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 10 of 34\n \n1  Grandstaff is a Fifth Circuit case, plaintiffs also cite Ninth Circuit cases reaching similar \n2  conclusions.  See Dkt. 128 at 27-28.   \n3    In support of their argument, plaintiffs cite not only to video evidence taken from \n4  police body cameras and from witnesses’ smartphones, they also provide a combined \n5  version of the videos that syncs up all of the videos to depict the same event occurring \n6  from different angles.  See Dkt. 131. \n7    However, the video evidence shows that the facts in this case are not analogous \n8  to the facts of Grandstaff and the firing-squad example used by the court in that case.  A \n9  useful description of what is shown in the video evidence comes in the expert report of \n10  former Oakland chief of police Sean Whent, one of plaintiffs’ experts.  Whent concludes \n11  that it was most likely Yuen who fired the shot that hit Acosta, and while he “would not \n a  12  exclude the possibility of it being” Nguyen or Grodin, he admits that those two scenarios \nurtni\noor 13  are less likely.  Dkt. 130 at 9.  Where plaintiffs’ own expert can state only that he “would \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  not exclude the possibility of it being” Nguyen or Grodin, and with no clear evidentiary \nDict  15  support in the video evidence that either Nguyen or Grodin fired the shot that struck \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  Acosta, the court cannot allow the claim against those two defendants to survive \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  summary judgment.  Accordingly, the court concludes that causation issues warrant \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  summary judgment as to Nguyen and Grodin, but not as to Yuen.   \nN\n19    The court also briefly distinguishes a case cited by defendants (also arising from \n20  the 2020 racial justice protests).  See Sanchez v. City of Atherton, 2023 WL 137475 \n21  (N.D. Cal. Jan. 9, 2023).  In Sanchez, the plaintiff filed suit against three officers who \n22  deployed 40mm PIW at the protests, even though he had not alleged that “he was in \n23  close proximity to any of the defendants,” only that the officers deployed rounds at the \n24  same demonstration.  That is not akin to the present case, where plaintiffs have indeed \n25  established not only that all three defendants were “in close proximity” to Acosta’s \n26  location when he was shot, but also that all three deployed their weapons in very close \n27  temporal proximity to the moment when Acosta was shot.   \n28    As to only Yuen, the court will address defendants’ argument (3) as to Acosta, that \n10 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 11 of 34\n \n1  the force was reasonable under the circumstances.   \n2    Defendants’ argument is that Acosta was “at the locus of perhaps the most violent, \n3  lawless activity of the entire protest.  A large dumpster on fire, the wanton and open \n4  destruction of property, assaults towards police officers (including by lobbing teargas or \n5  other objects back at the police line).”  Dkt. 121 at 37.   \n6    Plaintiffs’ expert concedes that “if an officer reasonably perceived a specific \n7  person was about to throw a hard object at them, then it may be reasonable for an officer \n8  to use force to prevent such an assault from occurring,” but also emphasizes that “Acosta \n9  did not commit any violent acts that would justify shooting him with an impact munition,” \n10  and that “impact munitions cannot be used if officers can’t prevent injuries to unintended \n11  targets.”  Dkt. 130 at 10-12.  While there were other people around Acosta at the time he \n a  12  was shot, and “even if one of those people had thrown an object at the officers, the officer \nurtni\noor 13  would not be justified in firing into that crowd because they were surrounded by too many \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  people for an officer to ensure that only the target would be struck.”  Id. at 11. \nDict  15    Overall, the court concludes that plaintiffs have raised a triable issue of fact as to \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  whether the force used against Acosta was reasonable under the circumstances, and \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  thus whether it was excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  However, \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  plaintiffs must also overcome the doctrine of qualified immunity.   \nN\n19    “In evaluating a grant of qualified immunity, a court considers whether (1) the state \n20  actor’s conduct violated a constitutional right and (2) the right was clearly established at \n21  the time of the alleged misconduct.”  Gordon v. County of Orange, 6 F.4th 961, 967-68 \n22  (9th Cir. 2021).  “Whether a constitutional right is clearly established is purely a question \n23  of law for the court to decide.”  Id. at 968 (internal citations omitted).  The court must \n24  consider “whether the law was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct,” \n25  and “the clearly established right must be defined with specificity.”  Felarca v. Birgenau, \n26  891 F.3d 809, 816 (9th Cir. 2018); City of Escondido, Cal. v. Emmons, 139 S.Ct. 500, \n27  503 (2019).   \n28    In a case arising out of similar facts as the present case, another court in this \n11 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 12 of 34\n \n1  district framed the relevant qualified immunity question as “whether it was clearly \n2  established that an officer could not shoot a projectile at an individual who was peacefully \n3  protesting.”  Sanderlin v. City of San Jose, 2023 WL 2562400 at *11 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 16, \n4  2023).  Relying on the Ninth Circuit’s opinion in Nelson, in which qualified immunity was \n5  denied, the Sanderlin court concluded that defendants had sufficient notice that their \n6  actions were unconstitutional.  Id. at *12 (citing Nelson, 685 F.3d at 872-77).  Specifically, \n7  the Nelson court held that, “[u]nder the factual circumstances present in this case, a \n8  reasonable officer would have been on notice that both the firing of a projectile that risked \n9  causing serious harm, in the direction of non-threatening individuals who had committed \n10  at most minor misdemeanors, and the release of pepper spray in the area occupied by \n11  those individuals, would constitute unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth \n a  12  Amendment.”  685 F.3d at 886.  To the extent that defendants attempt to argue that no \nurtni\noor 13  previous case involved the specific 37mm projectile impact weapons which were used \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  against Acosta, the court notes that Nelson and other cases have made clear that “an \nDict  15  officer is not entitled to qualified immunity on the ground that the law is not clearly \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  established every time a novel method is used to inflict injury.”  Id. at 884 (citing Deorle v. \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  Rutherford, 272 F.3d 1272, 1286 (9th Cir. 2001) (quoting Mendoza v. Block, 27 F.3d \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  1357, 1362 (9th Cir. 1994)). \nN\n19    Overall, the court concludes that the reasoning of the Sanderlin court is persuasive \n20  and adopts it in this case.  Accordingly, the court concludes that, at the time of the events \n21  giving rise to this case, it was clearly established by the Ninth Circuit in Nelson that an \n22  officer could not constitutionally shoot a projectile that risked causing serious harm in the \n23  direction of non-threatening individuals who had committed, at most, minor \n24  misdemeanors, and thus, defendants’ motion for summary judgment based on qualified \n25  immunity for Yuen as to his alleged shooting of Acosta must be DENIED.    \n26    Acosta’s Fourth Amendment claim against Yuen will therefore proceed to a jury.  \n27  Acosta also asserts his Fourth Amendment claim against SJPD supervisors and against \n28  the City of San Jose, and those claims will be discussed later in the order, along with \n12 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 13 of 34\n \n1  other claims brought by Acosta under the First Amendment and under state law.   \n2    2.  Maldonado \n3    Plaintiff Maldonado alleges in the complaint that he was subjected to “a chemical \n4  agent, most likely teargas.”  Dkt. 108, ¶ 83-85.  However, plaintiff Maldonado has not \n5  identified the individual(s) who deployed the chemical agents, instead asserting his \n6  Fourth Amendment claim against only supervisory defendants and the City.   \n7    Defendants argue that plaintiffs cannot maintain a claim where they cannot identify \n8  an officer who caused their alleged injury, emphasizing that “there were other agencies \n9  using force at the protest,” including the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office and the \n10  Santa Clara Police Department.  See Dkt. 140 at 17; Dkt. 121 at 18.   \n11    The court agrees that, in this case, a plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment claim against \n a  12  the San Jose Police Department and its employees cannot go forward where officers \nurtni\noor 13  from other agencies were using force and where a plaintiff cannot identify the officer(s) \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  who used the alleged force against him.  For that reason, summary judgment must be \nDict  15  granted as to all claims asserted by plaintiff Maldonado.  As stated above, plaintiff \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  Maldonado has no viable Fourth Amendment claim against either non-supervisory \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  defendants or supervisory defendants.  At the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel clarified that \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  their theory of relief under the First Amendment is that defendants used excessive force \nN\n19  in retaliation for plaintiffs’ expression of their viewpoint, which means that, where a \n20  plaintiff does not have a viable excessive force claim, that plaintiff also does not have a \n21  viable First Amendment claim under that theory.  As to plaintiffs’ claim for failure to \n22  intervene, that claim can also not be viable without an underlying constitutional tort.  To \n23  the extent that plaintiffs attempt to assert an alternative theory of a due process violation \n24  under the Fourteenth Amendment, that claim fails because it was not properly pleaded \n25  nor actually litigated during the course of discovery.  Finally, both parties agree that \n26  plaintiffs’ state law claims are based on the same theories as their federal § 1983 claims, \n27  and thus rise and fall together.  As a result, as to plaintiff Maldonado, defendants’ motion \n28  for summary judgment is GRANTED as to all of his claims.   \n13 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 14 of 34\n \n1    3.  Naemeh \n2    The complaint asserts Naemeh’s excessive force claim against Orabuena, Weber, \n3  and Situ, as well as supervisory defendants and the City of San Jose.   \n4    The opposition argues only that Orabuena shot Naemeh with PIW, and that Situ \n5  used unreasonable force by tackling him when he was not resisting.  Dkt. 128 at 39.  That \n6  seems to concede that Weber is not properly part of this claim, thus, summary judgment \n7  is GRANTED as to all claims asserted by Naemeh against Weber.    \n8    In addition to the ‘no intent to restrain’ argument addressed above, defendants \n9  make one additional argument as to Naemeh: that the force was reasonable under the \n10  circumstances. \n11    As to Orabuena, defendants argue that he was told by another officer (Weber) that \n a  12  a person wearing a paintball mask was throwing frozen water bottles at officers and was \nurtni\noor 13  hiding behind a planter.  See Dkt. 121 at 38.  According to defendants, Orabuena \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  reasonably believed that Naemeh had been throwing frozen water bottles at officers, \nDict  15  which justified the use of force against him.  \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16    The court concludes that, after considering the facts known to Orabuena and the \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  doctrine of qualified immunity, summary judgment must be granted in his favor.  Even if \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  Orabuena was mistaken about his belief that Naemeh was responsible for throwing \nN\n19  frozen water bottles at officers, plaintiffs have not provided the court with a basis for \n20  concluding that such a belief was unreasonable, and thus, the use of force would be \n21  covered by qualified immunity.  See, e.g., Hopson v. Alexander, 71 F.4th 692, 700 (9th \n22  Cir. 2023) (“In performing the qualified immunity analysis, we do not second-guess \n23  officers’ real-time decisions from the standpoint of perfect hindsight.”) (internal citation \n24  omitted).  Accordingly, defendants’ motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to the \n25  claims asserted by plaintiff Naemeh against defendant Orabuena.   \n26    Similarly, although Naemeh’s encounter with Situ occurred approximately an hour \n27  later, the parties appear to agree that Situ’s use of force and his arrest of Naemeh were \n28  made in connection with the earlier suspicion that Naemeh had thrown frozen water \n14 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 15 of 34\n \n1  bottles at officers.  Plaintiffs’ expert Whent opines that “Situ clearly had been looking for \n2  Naemeh as officers had identified him as a person that had been throwing objects.”  Dkt. \n3  130 at 33.  The Whent report further opines that Naemeh began to run as Situ \n4  approached, and that the force was used incident to arrest.  Accordingly, after \n5  considering all of these facts, along with the doctrine of qualified immunity, the court \n6  concludes that defendants’ motion for summary judgment must also be GRANTED as to \n7  the claims asserted by plaintiff Naemeh against defendant Situ.   \n8    As discussed above in the context of plaintiff Maldonado, where a plaintiff has no \n9  viable Fourth Amendment claim against any non-supervisory defendant, that plaintiff also \n10  cannot assert a viable Fourth Amendment claim against a supervisory defendant or \n11  against the City of San Jose.  Thus, summary judgment is warranted as to the entirety of \n a  12  plaintiff Naemeh’s Fourth Amendment claim.  And as also discussed above, the lack of a \nurtni\noor 13  viable excessive force claim also renders unviable plaintiff Naemeh’s First Amendment \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  claim and ‘failure to intervene’ claim.  For the same reasons as discussed above, plaintiff \nDict  15  Naemeh also cannot assert a theory under the Fourteenth Amendment, and because his \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  state law claims are based on the same allegations as his federal claims, they rise and \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  fall together.  Accordingly, the court concludes that defendants’ motion for summary \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  judgment must be GRANTED as to all claims asserted by plaintiff Naemeh.   \nN\n19    4.  Swift \n20    The complaint asserts Swift’s excessive force claim against Curry, Silva, and \n21  Ayala (and the supervisory defendants and City).  \n22    Plaintiffs’ opposition argues that all three officer defendants used unreasonable \n23  force on Swift by clubbing and shoving her.  See Dkt. 128 at 36. \n24    Defendants argue that Silva was improperly added to the complaint, and should be \n25  dismissed for that reason.  See Dkt. 121 at 32, n.2.  Specifically, when plaintiffs moved \n26  for leave to amend the complaint, Silva’s name was not included in the amended \n27  complaint.  See Dkt. 70-1.  Even after the court partially granted the motion for leave and \n28  directed plaintiffs to file a proposed amended complaint, that version did not include Silva \n15 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 16 of 34\n \n1  either.  See Dkt. 94.  Only after the court issued an order directing plaintiffs to file the \n2  proposed amended complaint as the new operative complaint – only then did Silva’s \n3  name appear, and even then, his name is not in the complaint’s caption, but only in the \n4  body.  Also, defendants allege that Silva was never served with the complaint.  Overall, \n5  the court concludes Silva was indeed improperly added, and he is not a proper defendant \n6  on this claim.   \n7    That leaves the claims against Curry and Ayala.  Defendants argue that the force \n8  was reasonable because it was “de minimis.”  Dkt. 121 at 32-33. \n9    The Ninth Circuit has made clear that baton strikes are considered “intermediate \n10  force.”  See, e.g., Young v. County of Los Angeles, 655 F.3d at 1162.  The Young court \n11  also established when such force may – or more specifically, may not – be used: “Our \n a  12  conclusion comports with the logical notion that it is rarely necessary, if ever, for a police \nurtni\noor 13  officer to employ substantial force without warning against an individual who is suspected \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  only of minor offenses, is not resisting arrest, and, most important, does not pose any \nDict  15  apparent threat to officer or public safety.”  Id. at 1167; see also Gravelet-Blondin v. \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  Shelton, 728 F.3d 1086, 1093 (9th Cir. 2013) (“The right to be free from the application of \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  non-trivial force for engaging in mere passive resistance was clearly established prior to \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  2008.”). \nN\n19    While plaintiffs’ expert concedes that defendants had probable cause to arrest \n20  Swift – and indeed, plaintiffs do not challenge Swift’s arrest – he opines that defendants \n21  “shoved or jabbed her at least seventeen times which is excessive for the level of threat \n22  that she posed.”  Dkt. 130 at 37.   \n23    Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, the court \n24  concludes that there remains a triable issue of fact as to the reasonableness of the force \n25  used against Swift by Curry and Ayala, and that qualified immunity does not shield the \n26  defendants from liability.  Accordingly, defendants’ motion for summary judgment is \n27  DENIED as to Swift’s Fourth Amendment claim against Curry and Ayala.   \n28    Swift also asserts a Fourth Amendment claim against supervisory defendants and \n16 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 17 of 34\n \n1  the City of San Jose, and those claims will be discussed later in the order, along with \n2  other claims brought by Swift under the First Amendment and under state law.   \n3    5.  Cañas \n4    The complaint asserts Cañas’s excessive force claim against Yuen (and the \n5  supervisory defendants and City).   \n6    The opposition alleges that “video produced by defendants has revealed that it \n7  was defendant Simonini who shot Joseph Cañas.”  Dkt. 128 at 33.  Plaintiffs “concede \n8  that Yuen did not shoot Cañas,” and instead seek to assert this claim against Simonini.  \n9  Id.   \n10    While the court appreciates plaintiffs’ candor about making the correct \n11  identification, the fact remains that it is too late for plaintiffs to change course.  To have \n a  12  given defendants proper notice, plaintiffs would have needed to move to amend the \nurtni\noor 13  complaint to make this change before the deadline for doing so.  Plaintiffs cannot assert a \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  new legal theory for the first time on summary judgment, and for that reason, summary \nDict  15  judgment must be GRANTED as to the Fourth Amendment claim asserted against Yuen \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  by plaintiff Cañas.  Additionally, the court also notes that plaintiffs’ own expert report does \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  not conclude that Simonini was the officer who shot Cañas, instead maintaining that “it is \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  unknown which officer specifically fired the round that hit Cañas.”  Dkt. 130 at 14.   \nN\n19    As discussed above in the context of plaintiffs Maldonado and Naemeh, the lack of \n20  a viable Fourth Amendment claim against any non-supervisory defendant also precludes \n21  a viable Fourth Amendment claim against a supervisory defendant or against the City of \n22  San Jose.  The lack of a viable excessive force claim against any defendant, in turn, \n23  renders unviable plaintiff Cañas’s First Amendment and ‘failure to intervene’ claims.  And \n24  for the reasons discussed above, plaintiff Cañas also cannot assert any viable Fourteenth \n25  Amendment claim or state law claims.  Thus, the court concludes that defendants’ motion \n26  for summary judgment must be GRANTED as to all claims asserted by plaintiff Cañas.   \n27  6.  Vasquez \n28    The complaint asserts Vasquez’s excessive force claim against Yuen and \n17 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 18 of 34\n \n1  Simonini (and the supervisory defendants and City).   \n2    Plaintiffs’ opposition narrows the claim to defendant Simonini (and the supervisors \n3  and City).  See Dkt. 128 at 33.  Thus, summary judgment is GRANTED as to all claims \n4  asserted by Vasquez against Yuen.   \n5    Plaintiffs allege that Simonini’s force was unreasonable because he shot 37mm \n6  directly into a crowd, and because he shot Vasquez in the groin and inner thighs.  \n7  Plaintiffs further allege that an unidentified officer struck Vasquez in the stomach with a \n8  baton, causing further bruising.  Id. at 34.   \n9    As an initial matter, because Vasquez cannot identify the officer who struck her \n10  with a baton, summary judgment is GRANTED to the extent that any claim is based on \n11  those allegations.   \n a  12    As to the PIW-related allegations, defendants argue that the evidence shows only \nurtni\noor 13  that Simonini was firing PIW in the vicinity of where Vasquez was standing, and further \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  argue that the use of force was minimal.  See Dkt. 121 at 25-26.   \nDict  15    Overall, the court concludes that the Fourth Amendment claim of Vasquez is to be \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  analyzed similarly to the Fourth Amendment claim of Acosta, discussed above.  Like \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  Acosta, Vasquez was struck with PIW while passively protesting.  And like Acosta, the \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  fact that Vasquez may not have been intentionally targeted is not relevant to the analysis, \nN\n19  because the force occurred “through means intentionally applied.”  And, as with Acosta’s \n20  claim, the Ninth Circuit’s opinion in Nelson forecloses any claim of qualified immunity by \n21  the officers who fired the PIW.  Notably, plaintiffs’ expert report cites Officer Simonini’s \n22  own deposition testimony, acknowledging that PIW are not intended to be used against \n23  passive resisters.  Dkt. 130 at 17.  Accordingly, defendants’ motion for summary \n24  judgment is DENIED as to the Fourth Amendment claim asserted by plaintiff Vasquez \n25  against defendant Simonini.   \n26    Vasquez also asserts a Fourth Amendment claim against supervisory defendants \n27  and the City of San Jose, and those claims will be discussed later in the order, along with \n28  other claims brought by Vasquez under the First Amendment and under state law.   \n18 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 19 of 34\n \n1    7.  Allen \n2    The complaint asserts Allen’s excessive force claim against Yuen (and the \n3  supervisory defendants and City).   \n4    Plaintiffs’ opposition alleges that Yuen knocked Allen to the ground as he was \n5  trying to walk in the direction indicated by the officers.  See Dkt. 128 at 37.  Plaintiffs \n6  further allege that an unknown officer shot Allen with PIW in the chest area.  Id. \n7    Defendants argue in reply that the PIW-allegations are barred, because they were \n8  not identified in interrogatory responses asking for all alleged unconstitutional uses of \n9  force.  But at the hearing, plaintiffs cited discovery responses showing that the PIW \n10  allegations were indeed made known to defendants, and defendants conceded as much.  \n11  Regardless, because Allen has not identified which officer fired the PIW that struck him, \n a  12  any claims based on that conduct are not viable.   \nurtni\noor 13    The only individual that Allen identifies as using force on him is defendant Yuen, \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  who is alleged to have shoved him to the ground while holding his baton with both hands.  \nDict  15  See Dkt. 130 at 18-19.  The video evidence also shows that Yuen deployed PIW shortly \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  after the shove, but plaintiffs’ expert concedes that Yuen’s shots were fired in a different \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  direction from where Allen had stood up and begun walking.  See Dkt. 130 at 19.  Thus, \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  when considering Allen’s Fourth Amendment claim against Yuen, the court will consider \nN\n19  only the shove with his baton. \n20    As discussed above, in the context of Swift’s claim, use of a baton is generally \n21  considered intermediate force.  And, as also discussed above in the context of Swift’s \n22  claim, it was clearly established at the time of events giving rise to this suit that such \n23  force was excessive when used against “an individual who is suspected only of minor \n24  offenses, is not resisting arrest, and, most important, does not pose any apparent threat \n25  to officer or public safety.”  See Young at 1167.   \n26    Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, the court \n27  concludes that there remains a triable issue of fact as to the reasonableness of the force \n28  used against Allen by Yuen, and that qualified immunity does not shield Yuen from \n19 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 20 of 34\n \n1  liability.  Accordingly, defendants’ motion for summary judgment is DENIED as to Allen’s \n2  Fourth Amendment claim against Yuen.   \n3    Allen also asserts a Fourth Amendment claim against supervisory defendants and \n4  the City of San Jose, and those claims will be discussed later in the order, along with \n5  other claims brought by Allen under the First Amendment and under state law.   \n6    8.  Riles \n7    The complaint asserts Riles’s excessive force claim against Simonini (and the \n8  supervisory defendants and City).   \n9    Plaintiffs’ opposition alleges that either Simonini or officer Zachary Preuss shot \n10  Riles.  See Dkt. 128 at 34.  Preuss was not properly added as a defendant on this claim \n11  (or to the complaint at all), so there is no need to analyze the claims against him. \n a  12    As to Simonini, Riles alleges that Simonini’s body camera shows him shooting \nurtni\noor 13  towards her and Vasquez. \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14    Defendants raise a causation issue here, arguing that there is no video evidence \nDict  15  showing Simonini shooting Riles.  While the lack of video evidence does not necessarily \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  doom Riles’s claim, defendants have identified a related problem with Riles’s current \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  allegations.  Riles initially testified at her deposition that she was shot before she was \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  standing next to her sister (Vasquez), but she now argues in the opposition brief that she \nN\n19  was shot while standing next to her sister.  See Dkt. 128 at 34.  The court also notes that \n20  the Whent report describes the general circumstances under which Riles was shot, but \n21  does not identify Simonini as the shooter.   \n22    Given the lack of evidence tying Simonini to the shooting of Riles, and given \n23  plaintiff’s inconsistent testimony about when she was shot, and given the expert’s silence \n24  on the identity of the shooter – the court concludes that all of these factors cast too much \n25  doubt on the identity of the officer who fired the rounds that struck Riles to allow this \n26  claim to go to trial.  Instead, this claim is more analogous to the claims of plaintiffs who \n27  cannot identify the shooter, and whose claims against SJPD thus fail because of the \n28  other agencies present at the relevant protests.  Accordingly, the court concludes that \n20 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 21 of 34\n \n1  summary judgment must be GRANTED as to all claims asserted by plaintiff Riles.   \n2    As discussed above in the context of plaintiffs Maldonado, Naemeh, and Cañas, \n3  the lack of a viable Fourth Amendment claim against any non-supervisory defendant also \n4  precludes a viable Fourth Amendment claim against a supervisory defendant or against \n5  the City of San Jose.  The lack of a viable excessive force claim against any defendant, \n6  in turn, renders unviable plaintiff Riles’s First Amendment and ‘failure to intervene’ claims.  \n7  And for the reasons discussed above, plaintiff Riles also cannot assert any viable \n8  Fourteenth Amendment claim or state law claims.  Thus, the court concludes that \n9  defendants’ motion for summary judgment must be GRANTED as to all claims asserted \n10  by plaintiff Riles.   \n11    9.  Flores \n a  12    The complaint asserts Flores’s Fourth Amendment claim against Gaona and \nurtni\noor 13  Grodin, as well as supervisory defendants and the City of San Jose.  \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14    Plaintiffs’ opposition narrows the claim to defendant Gaona (and the supervisory \nDict  15  defendants and City).  See Dkt. 128 at 34.  Thus, summary judgment is GRANTED as to \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  the claims asserted by Flores against Grodin.   \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17    Plaintiffs allege that Gaona’s force was unreasonable because he shot Flores with \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  40mm PIW in his testicle, and on his shoulder as he was walking away.  Id. at 35.   \nN\n19    Defendants argue that the force was reasonable due to the actions of other people \n20  at the demonstration, and it was reasonable for Gaona to conclude that Flores was \n21  throwing objects at police because he “paced in front of the police line with something in \n22  his hands.”  Dkt. 121 at 29.   \n23    The court concludes that, after considering the facts around Gaona’s use of force, \n24  and the doctrine of qualified immunity, that summary judgment must be denied.  “Pacing” \n25  in front of the police with “something” in one’s hands does not justify the use of PIW, for \n26  the reasons expressed in Nelson and followed in Sanderlin.  Many of the people at the \n27  protests were holding cell phones, including to take photos or videos, and it cannot be \n28  reasonable for officers to conclude that everyone holding “something” in their hands is \n21 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 22 of 34\n \n1  subject to PIW or an equivalent level of force just because that unidentified object might \n2  conceivably be used as a weapon.  Accordingly, defendants’ motion for summary \n3  judgment is DENIED as to the Fourth Amendment claim asserted by plaintiff Flores \n4  against defendant Gaona.   \n5    Flores also asserts a Fourth Amendment claim against supervisory defendants \n6  and the City of San Jose, and those claims will be discussed later in the order, along with \n7  other claims brought by Flores under the First Amendment and under state law.   \n8    10.  Cuellar \n9    The complaint asserts Cuellar’s excessive force claim against Simonini, Adgar, \n10  Nguyen, Grodin, and Moran (and the supervisory defendants and City).   \n11    Plaintiffs’ opposition appears to narrow the claim to defendant Simonini (and the \n a  12  supervisors and City).  See Dkt. 128 at 35-36.  Thus, summary judgment is GRANTED as \nurtni\noor 13  to the claims asserted by Cuellar against Adgar, Nguyen, Grodin, and Moran.   \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14    Plaintiffs allege that Simonini’s force was unreasonable because he shot 37mm \nDict  15  PIW at least four times near demonstrators’ legs, striking her in the calf.  Id. at 36.    \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16    Defendants raise a causation issue here, arguing that plaintiffs have established \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  only that Simonini was shooting 37mm PIW in the general area that Cuellar was in.  They \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  point to the Whent report, noting that it does not identify Simonini as the shooter.  Dkt. \nN\n19  140 at 22 (citing Dkt. 130 at 28-31). \n20    The court agrees with defendants on the causation issue.  Unlike with Acosta, \n21  where plaintiffs pinned down the relative locations of plaintiff and defendant, all that is \n22  established here is that they were around the same general area, without more.   \n23    Accordingly, because the court concludes that Cuellar has not adequately \n24  identified the officer who fired the shots that struck her, summary judgment is GRANTED \n25  as to her Fourth Amendment claim against Simonini. \n26    As discussed above in the context of plaintiffs Maldonado, Naemeh, Cañas, and \n27  Riles, the lack of a viable Fourth Amendment claim against any non-supervisory \n28  defendant also precludes a viable Fourth Amendment claim against a supervisory \n22 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 23 of 34\n \n1  defendant or against the City of San Jose.  The lack of a viable excessive force claim \n2  against any defendant, in turn, renders unviable plaintiff Cuellar’s First Amendment and \n3  ‘failure to intervene’ claims.  And for the reasons discussed above, plaintiff Cuellar also \n4  cannot assert any viable Fourteenth Amendment claim or state law claims.  Thus, the \n5  court concludes that defendants’ motion for summary judgment must be GRANTED as to \n6  all claims asserted by plaintiff Cuellar.   \n7    11.  Cartwright \n8    The complaint does not assert Cartwright’s excessive force claim against any \n9  individual officers, only against supervisory defendants. \n10    However, as discussed above in the context of plaintiff Maldonado, because the \n11  relevant events in this case involved not only the San Jose Police Department, but also \n a  12  other law enforcement agencies, a plaintiff cannot maintain claims against the SJPD or \nurtni\noor 13  its employees without identifying the officers who used the alleged force.  Accordingly, \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  because plaintiff Cartwright cannot identify the officers who allegedly used force against \nDict  15  her, defendants’ motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to her Fourth \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  Amendment claim.  The lack of a viable excessive force claim against any defendant, in \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  turn, renders unviable plaintiff Cartwright’s First Amendment and ‘failure to intervene’ \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  claims.  And for the reasons discussed above, plaintiff Cartwright also cannot assert any \nN\n19  viable Fourteenth Amendment claim or state law claims.   \n20    Plaintiff Cartwright also asserts two claims that are unasserted by the other \n21  plaintiffs: one under the Americans with Disabilities Act, and one under the Rehabilitation \n22  Act.  For the same reasons discussed above, namely that plaintiff Cartwright cannot \n23  identify the officers who caused her alleged injury, and thus cannot establish that they \n24  were SJPD officers due to the presence of multiple law enforcement agencies at the \n25  protest, the court concludes that plaintiff Cartwright’s ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims \n26  are also subject to summary judgment. \n27    Additionally, in order to prevail on a claim under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act, a \n28  plaintiff must show, among other things, that her treatment was “by reason of her \n23 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 24 of 34\n \n1  disability.”  Sheehan v. City and County of San Francisco, 743 F.3d 1211, 1232 (9th Cir. \n2  2014).  Plaintiffs have provided no evidence showing that plaintiff Cartwright’s treatment \n3  by police was “by reason of” her disability.   \n4    Accordingly, defendants’ motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to the \n5  ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims asserted by Cartwright.  Because the court already \n6  granted summary judgment as to plaintiff Cartwright’s other claims, that results in a grant \n7  of summary judgment as to all of Cartwright’s asserted claims.   \n8    12.  Organizational plaintiffs \n9    In addition to the individual plaintiffs, the complaint also purports to assert claims \n10  on behalf of two organizational plaintiffs:  the NAACP of San Jose/Silicon Valley and the \n11  San Jose Peace and Justice Center.  The organizational plaintiffs do not assert any \n a  12  claims against non-supervisory officers, only against supervisory defendants and the \nurtni\noor 13  City.   \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14    As an initial matter, the court must evaluate whether the organizational plaintiffs \nDict  15  have standing to assert their claims.  See, e.g., Bernhardt v. County of Los Angeles, 279 \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  F.3d 862, 868 (9th Cir. 2002) (“Federal courts are required sua sponte to examine \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  jurisdictional issues such as standing.”).  Defendants raise the issue of standing in their \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  motion, but only in a footnote, citing space limitations.  See Dkt. 121 at 42, n. 4.  Plaintiffs’ \nN\n19  opposition brief contains no response on the issue of organizational standing.  The Ninth \n20  Circuit has held that, “[o]rdinarily, a plaintiff opposing a motion for summary judgment on \n21  a standing issue would have to support, with affidavits or other evidence, the factual \n22  allegations underlying the assertion of standing because such allegations must ultimately \n23  be proven for a plaintiff to prevail.”  La Asociacion de Trabajadores de Lake Forest v. City \n24  of Lake Forest, 624 F.3d 1083, 1088 (9th Cir. 2010) (internal citations omitted).  In this \n25  case, plaintiffs’ lack of response to defendants’ argument leaves the court with no basis \n26  upon which to find standing, and thus, defendants’ motion for summary judgment is \n27  GRANTED as to all claims asserted by the organizational plaintiffs.   \n28   \n24 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 25 of 34\n \n1    13.  Supervisory liability and Monell \n2    As set forth above, plaintiffs Acosta, Swift, Vasquez, Allen, and Flores have viable \n3  Fourth Amendment claims against non-supervisory defendants, so the court will now \n4  analyze the viability of their Fourth Amendment claims against supervisory defendants \n5  and the City of San Jose. \n6    As to supervisory liability, plaintiffs Acosta, Swift, Vasquez, Allen, and Flores each \n7  assert a Fourth Amendment claim against defendants Garcia, Knopf, Dwyer, Matchett, \n8  and Tassio.  Plaintiff Acosta additionally asserts a Fourth Amendment claim against \n9  defendants Lopez and Lynch, and plaintiffs Vasquez and Allen each assert a Fourth \n10  Amendment claim against Lopez. \n11    To be held liable on a supervisory liability theory, a supervisor need not be \n a  12  “directly and personally involved in the same way as are the individual officers who are \nurtni\noor 13  on the scene inflicting constitutional injury.”  Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1205 (9th Cir. \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  2011).  Rather, the supervisor's participation could include his “own culpable action or \nDict  15  inaction in the training, supervision, or control of his subordinates,” “his acquiescence in \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  the constitutional deprivations of which the complaint is made,” or “conduct that showed a \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  reckless or callous indifference to the rights of others.”  Id. at 1205-06.  The requisite \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  involvement can also consist of “setting in motion a series of acts by others.”  Id. at 1207.   \nN\n19      a.  Garcia and Knopf \n20    Defendants argue that defendant Garcia was not involved in the planning, \n21  implementation, or tactics at the protest, and that he merely “received updates from his \n22  chain of command remotely.”  Dkt. 121 at 42-43.  The court concludes that plaintiffs have \n23  not rebutted that showing, and thus, summary judgment is warranted as to plaintiffs’ \n24  Fourth Amendment claim against defendant Garcia.   \n25    As to defendant Knopf, defendants argue that he largely “had no substantive \n26  involvement in the tactics or response of SJPD at the protest,” other than being involved \n27  with the decisions to declare an unlawful assembly and to use tear gas.  Dkt. 121 at 43-\n28  44.  Because the Fourth Amendment claims of plaintiffs Acosta, Swift, Vasquez, Allen, \n25 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 26 of 34\n \n1  and Flores do not allege injury due to tear gas, Knopf’s involvement in the decision to use \n2  tear gas is not properly considered as part of these claims.  And because plaintiffs have \n3  not provided evidence that defendant Knopf was adequately involved in the decision to \n4  use PIW, summary judgment is warranted as to plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claim \n5  against defendant Knopf.   \n6    And because plaintiffs have no viable excessive force claim against defendants \n7  Garcia and Knopf, their other claims under the First Amendment and under state law are \n8  also not viable.  And for the reasons discussed above, plaintiffs’ ‘failure to intervene’ \n9  claim and Fourteenth Amendment claim are also subject to summary judgment.  Thus, as \n10  to all claims asserted against defendants Garcia and Knopf, defendants’ motion for \n11  summary judgment is GRANTED.   \n a  12      b.  Dwyer \nurtni\noor 13    As to defendant Dwyer, defendants concede that “he authorized the use of the \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  37m (or 40mm OC rounds),” but argue that summary judgment is still warranted because \nDict  15  the decision was justified due to the actions of the crowd.  See Dkt. 121 at 45-46.  \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  However, as discussed above, the Ninth Circuit in Nelson made clear that “a reasonable \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  officer would have been on notice that both the firing of a projectile that risked causing \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  serious harm, in the direction of non-threatening individuals who had committed at most \nN\n19  minor misdemeanors, and the release of pepper spray in the area occupied by those \n20  individuals, would constitute unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth Amendment.”  \n21  685 F.3d at 886; see also Sanderlin, 2023 WL 2562400 at *18 (“the question is whether it \n22  was clearly established that an officer could not shoot a projectile at an individual who \n23  was peacefully protesting the police.  And the Court finds that it was clearly \n24  established.”).  Accordingly, because the court concludes that defendant Dwyer was \n25  personally involved in the decision to use PIW against non-threatening protestors such as \n26  Acosta, Vasquez, and Flores, and because the court concludes that qualified immunity is \n27  not warranted under Nelson, defendants’ motion for summary judgment is DENIED as to \n28  the Fourth Amendment claim brought by plaintiffs Acosta, Vasquez, and Flores against \n26 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 27 of 34\n \n1  defendant Dwyer.  However, because plaintiffs Swift and Allen do not have viable \n2  allegations of being struck with PIW, summary judgment is GRANTED as to the Fourth \n3  Amendment claim brought by plaintiffs Swift and Allen against defendant Dwyer.   \n4      c.  Matchett \n5    Plaintiffs’ opposition brief includes only one paragraph on defendant Matchett, \n6  arguing that he gave the order to push the crowd at a certain intersection.  See Dkt. 128 \n7  at 51.  Plaintiffs do not provide any evidence that Matchett was personally involved with \n8  the specific violations alleged by plaintiffs Acosta, Vasquez, and Flores – namely, the use \n9  of PIW.  Nor do plaintiffs adequately tie Matchett’s conduct to the alleged excessive force \n10  used against Swift and Allen at Cesar Chavez Park.  Thus, the court concludes that \n11  defendants’ motion for summary judgment must be GRANTED as to the Fourth \n a  12  Amendment claim asserted against defendant Matchett.  And, for the same reasons \nurtni\noor 13  discussed in the context of defendants Garcia and Knopf, without a viable excessive \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  force claim against this defendant, plaintiffs’ other claims also fail, and thus, defendants’ \nDict  15  motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to all claims asserted against defendant \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  Matchett.   \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17      d.  Tassio \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18    Defendants concede that Tassio directed defendant Simonini to use his 37mm \nN\n19  PIW while responding to a crowd around the area of Santa Clara Street and Eighth \n20  Street.  See Dkt. 121 at 47.  As discussed above, Vasquez has asserted a viable Fourth \n21  Amendment claim against defendant Simonini, based on her allegation that she was shot \n22  with PIW while in a crowd around the area of Santa Clara Street and Seventh Street.  \n23  See, e.g., Dkt. 121 at 24-25.  Accordingly, the court concludes that plaintiff Vasquez has \n24  made an adequate showing that defendant Tassio was personally involved in her alleged \n25  constitutional injury.  And for the same reasons expressed above with respect to \n26  defendant Dwyer, the court concludes that qualified immunity is not warranted under \n27  Nelson.  Thus, defendants’ motion for summary judgment is DENIED as to plaintiff \n28  Vasquez’s Fourth Amendment claim against defendant Tassio.  However, because \n27 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 28 of 34\n \n1  plaintiffs have made no similar showing with respect to plaintiffs Acosta, Swift, Allen, and \n2  Flores, defendants’ motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to the Fourth \n3  Amendment claim asserted by Acosta, Swift, Allen, and Flores, against Tassio, and as to \n4  all other claims asserted by Acosta, Swift, Allen, and Flores against Tassio.   \n5      e.  Lopez \n6    Plaintiffs’ theory of liability as to defendant Lopez is that he was the direct \n7  supervisor of defendants Yuen and Situ at the scene of the protests.  Because plaintiff \n8  Vasquez has no viable claim against either defendants Yuen or Situ, she also has no \n9  viable claim against defendant Lopez, and thus, summary judgment is GRANTED as to \n10  all claims asserted by plaintiff Vasquez against defendant Lopez. \n11    Plaintiffs Acosta and Allen do have a viable Fourth Amendment claim against \n a  12  defendant Yuen, and because defendants have conceded that Lopez directly supervised \nurtni\noor 13  Yuen’s conduct at the relevant protests, the court concludes that plaintiffs have raised a \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  triable issue of fact as to whether Lopez was sufficiently involved in any constitutional \nDict  15  injuries suffered by Acosta or Allen, including through acquiescence.  Accordingly, \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  defendants’ motion for summary judgment is DENIED as to the Fourth Amendment claim \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  asserted by plaintiffs Acosta and Allen against defendant Lopez. \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18      f.  Lynch \nN\n19    Defendant Lynch is alleged to be involved only with the actions of defendant \n20  Nguyen, one of the defendants alleged to have fired the PIW that struck plaintiff Acosta.  \n21  However, as discussed above, the court has already concluded that Acosta’s claims will \n22  not go forward against Nguyen.  Accordingly, summary judgment is also GRANTED as to \n23  all claims asserted by plaintiff Acosta against defendant Lynch.  \n24      g.  Monell claim against the City \n25    To the extent that plaintiffs Acosta, Swift, Vasquez, Allen, and Flores have viable \n26  Fourth Amendment claims against individual defendants, the court will also evaluate \n27  whether those plaintiffs can also assert a viable Fourth Amendment claim against the City \n28  of San Jose under a Monell theory.   \n28 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 29 of 34\n \n1    “The Supreme Court in Monell held that municipalities may only be held liable \n2  under section 1983 for constitutional violations resulting from official . . . policy or \n3  custom.”  Benavidez v. County of San Diego, 993 F.3d 1134, 1153 (9th Cir. 2021) (citing \n4  Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs. of City of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978)).  The policy \n5  or custom must be a “deliberate choice to follow a course of action . . . made from among \n6  various alternatives by the official or officials responsible for establishing final policy with \n7  respect to the subject matter in question.”  Id. at 1153 (citing Castro v. County of Los \n8  Angeles, 833 F.3d 1060, 1075 (9th Cir. 2016)).  \n9    Plaintiffs argue that the City’s choice to allow use of 37mm and 40mm PIW against \n10  protestors, which had not been used at any protest before, was an unconstitutional \n11  policy.  Defendants argue that plaintiffs cannot establish an unconstitutional policy or \n a  12  custom based only on a single instance of conduct.  See Dkt. 121 at 56.  However, the \nurtni\noor 13  Supreme Court has held that “it is plain that municipal liability may be imposed for a \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  single decision by municipal policymakers under appropriate circumstances.”  Pembaur \nDict  15  v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 480 (1986); see also McRorie v. Shimoda, 795 F.2d \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  780, 784 (9th Cir. 1986), Menotti v, City of Seattle, 409 F.3d 1113, 1147 (9th Cir. 2005).   \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17    As an initial matter, because the challenged policy or custom relates only to the \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  use of PIW, and because plaintiffs Swift and Allen do not have viable claims arising out of \nN\n19  the use of PIW, summary judgment is GRANTED as to all claims asserted by Swift and \n20  Allen against the City. \n21    As to plaintiffs Acosta, Vasquez, and Flores, the court concludes that plaintiffs \n22  have raised a triable issue as to whether the City of San Jose’s policy or custom of using \n23  PIW against non-threatening protestors was unconstitutional under the law established \n24  by the Ninth Circuit in Nelson and related cases.  Thus, the motion for summary judgment \n25  is DENIED as to the Fourth Amendment claim brought under Monell against the City of \n26  San Jose by plaintiffs Acosta, Vasquez, and Flores.    \n27    14.  First Amendment \n28    As discussed above, for those plaintiffs whose excessive force claims were \n29 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 30 of 34\n \n1  deemed unviable, their First Amendment claims are also unviable.  However, because \n2  plaintiffs Acosta, Swift, Vasquez, Allen, and Flores do have viable excessive force claims, \n3  the court will now also consider whether they have viable First Amendment claims. \n4    To prevail on a First Amendment claim, a plaintiff must show that (1) he was \n5  engaged in constitutionally protected activity, (2) defendants’ conduct would chill a \n6  person of ordinary firmness from continuing to participate in the protected activity, and (3) \n7  the protected activity was a “substantial or motivating factor” in the defendants’ conduct.  \n8  See, e.g., Index Newspapers v. U.S. Marshals, 977 F.3d 817, 827 (9th Cir. 2020).  The \n9  “substantial or motivating factor” element “may be met with either direct or circumstantial \n10  evidence, and we have said that it involves questions of fact that normally should be left \n11  for trial.”  Id. at 827 (citing Ulrich v. City & County of San Francisco, 308 F.3d 968, 979 \n a  12  (9th Cir. 2002)). \nurtni\noor 13    Plaintiffs’ argument relies largely on circumstantial evidence.  While they cite \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  individual examples of police officers expressing negative views of protestors, the court \nDict  15  will not impute each of those statements to every officer in the San Jose Police \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  Department.  That said, the court also recognizes, as did the Sanderlin court, that “it \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  would be difficult for plaintiffs to produce direct evidence that the officers’ subjective \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  motives for the shooting were related to the protests and their subject matters.”  \nN\n19  Sanderlin, 2023 WL 2562400 at *16.  The court further recognizes the unique factual \n20  circumstances presented by this case, where the parties alleged to have used excessive \n21  force are themselves the subject of the plaintiffs’ viewpoint expression.  Thus, there is an \n22  inherently oppositional nature between the viewpoint and the police, in contrast with \n23  cases where the viewpoint being expressed is unrelated to the police.  \n24    Overall, when considering the specific officers for whom a triable issue has been \n25  raised as to the reasonableness of their use of force, the court concludes that a \n26  reasonable jury could find that the plaintiffs’ viewpoint expression was a “substantial or \n27  motivating factor” in the uses of force.  However, the court’s conclusion is limited to the \n28  specific officers alleged to have actually applied the force to the remaining plaintiffs, \n30 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 31 of 34\n \n1  Acosta, Swift, Vasquez, Allen, and Flores.  As to the supervisory defendants and the City, \n2  plaintiffs have not provided the court with a basis for concluding that the plaintiffs’ \n3  viewpoint was a “substantial or motivating factor” in any of the supervisors’ conduct, or in \n4  any policy or custom adopted by the City, including the use of PIW.   \n5    Accordingly, defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to the First Amendment \n6  claim is DENIED to the extent it is asserted by Acosta against Yuen, by Swift against \n7  Curry and Ayala, by Vasquez against Simonini, by Allen against Yuen, and by Flores \n8  against Gaona.  As to all other First Amendment claims asserted against all other \n9  defendants, the motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.   \n10    15.  Failure to intervene – fifth cause of action \n11    As mentioned above, plaintiffs’ complaint purports to assert a fifth cause of action \n a  12  for ‘failure to intervene’ under section 1983.  Plaintiffs’ opposition devotes only a single \nurtni\noor 13  paragraph to this cause of action, arguing that defendants Yuen, Grodin, Nguyen, \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  Simonini, and Preuss failed to intervene in the First Amendment violations of plaintiffs \nDict  15  Acosta and Riles.  See Dkt. 128 at 29.  The court has already concluded that Riles has \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16  no viable claim for a First Amendment violation, and as to Acosta, plaintiffs’ do not \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  present the court with any basis for concluding that any defendants had a realistic \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  opportunity to intervene to prevent the single shot that struck him, which plaintiffs admit \nN\n19  occurred “within seconds of commands to move the line forward.”  See Dkt. 128 at 28; \n20  see also Cunningham v. Gates, 229 F.3d 1271, 1289 (9th Cir. 2000) (“officers can be \n21  held liable for failing to intercede only if they had an opportunity to intercede”); Cortesluna \n22  v. Leon, 979 F.3d 645, 656 (9th Cir. 2020) (“there is no evidence that [the officer] knew \n23  what the other defendants would do, and the events unfolded very rapidly – in a matter of \n24  seconds”).  Accordingly, defendants’ motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to \n25  plaintiffs’ fifth cause of action for failure to intervene.    \n26    16.  State law claims \n27    The parties agree that plaintiffs’ state law claims are premised on the same \n28  theories and evidence as their federal § 1983 claims, and thus largely rise and fall \n31 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 32 of 34\n \n1  together.   \n2    A Bane Act claim has the same elements as an excessive force claim under the \n3  Fourth Amendment, with an additional requirement that the defendant intended to \n4  interfere with a plaintiff’s constitutional rights.  See Reese v. County of Sacramento, 888 \n5  F.3d 1030, 1045 (9th Cir. 2018).  The Reese court also made clear that the “intent” \n6  requirement can be met by “a reckless disregard for a person’s constitutional rights.”  Id.  \n7  Defendants argue that the intent requirement cannot be met here, but the court \n8  concludes that, as to the defendants against whom plaintiffs Acosta, Swift, Vasquez, \n9  Allen, and Flores have a viable Fourth Amendment claim, plaintiffs can show “reckless \n10  disregard” for their constitutional rights for the same reasons that the court denied \n11  qualified immunity – namely, that plaintiffs had a clearly established right to be free from \n a  12  the force that was used against them in the circumstances they were in.  Thus, to the \nurtni\noor 13  extent that summary judgment was denied as to the Fourth Amendment claim brought by \nCf\nt ali\nstricof C 14  plaintiffs Acosta, Swift, Vasquez, Allen, and Flores, summary judgment is also DENIED \nDict  15  as to the Bane Act claim brought by those plaintiffs.   \ns ri\net\ns\natDi 16    Plaintiffs also assert a claim under California’s Ralph Act, which is alleged in the \nt\nS \nn\nd er 17  complaint as brought under a viewpoint-discrimination theory.  See Dkt. 108 at 56.  Thus, \ne\nh\nt\nnirt\nUo 18  to the extent that summary judgment was denied as to the First Amendment claim \nN\n19  brought by plaintiffs Acosta, Swift, Vasquez, Allen, and Flores, summary judgment is also \n20  DENIED as to the Ralph Act claim brought by those plaintiffs.   \n21    Finally, plaintiffs assert state law claims for assault and battery, and for \n22  negligence.  Both are coextensive with a Fourth Amendment excessive force claim, and \n23  to the extent that the court denied summary judgment as to the Fourth Amendment claim \n24  brought by plaintiffs Acosta, Swift, Vasquez, Allen, and Flores, summary judgment is also \n25  DENIED as to the assault and battery claim and negligence claim brought by those \n26  plaintiffs.   \n27  CONCLUSION \n28  For the foregoing reasons, defendants’ motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 121) is \n32 \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 147   Filed 08/03/23   Page 33 of 34\n \n1  GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.

INTRODUCTION \n \n1  1.  Black people have been hunted, brutalized and killed by the police since the inception \n2  of law enforcement in the United States, including a demonstrable history of violence in San \nJosé. This action arises out of protests across the nation in response to the May 25, 2020, \n3 \nmurder of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police Department officers. Floyd’s death, so soon \n4 \nafter law enforcement killed Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, mobilized millions of \n5 \npeople around the country to condemn the deaths of Black and Brown people by law \n6 \nenforcement in one of the largest social justice movements in U.S. history.1  \n7 \n2.  In San José, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets on May 29, 2020, and for \n8  several days thereafter, to express their view that police brutality and institutionalized racism \n9  must end. But the demonstrators were met with brutal and racially targeted repression by \n10  defendant CITY OF SAN JOSÉ.  \n11  3.  This is a civil rights action for damages, injunctive and declaratory relief arising from \nunconstitutional CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police’s violence on May 29-31, 2020. Named plaintiffs \n12 \nM. MICHAEL ACOSTA, JOSEPH MALDONADO, MAHMOUDREZA NAEMEH and \n13 \n \nMEGAN SWIFT (suing as individuals), and JOSEPH CAÑAS, LESLIE VASQUEZ, PETER \n14 \nALLEN, SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT, YESSICA RILES, JOSÉ GUSTAVO FLORES \n15 \nRODRIGUEZ, and CINDY CUELLAR, (suing as individuals and class representatives) seek \n16 \nredress for the violation of their constitutional rights to assemble, protest, and be free from \n17  racial discrimination, disability discrimination, excessive force, and wrongful arrest. \n18  Organization plaintiffs NAACP OF SAN JOSÉ / SILICON VALLEY and SAN JOSÉ PEACE \n19  AND JUSTICE CENTER, along with all of the individual plaintiffs, seek prospective and \n20  declaratory relief to ensure the right to express viewpoints critical of the police or government \nin San José without fear of violent repression or wrongful arrest. \n21 \n4.  Starting on May 29, 2020, and continuing during the demonstrations on May 30, 31, \n22 \nand thereafter, the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police fired impact munitions into the bodies of \n23 \nunarmed, predominately peaceful demonstrators, observers and journalists without \n24 \njustification; threw explosive flash-bang and “stinger” grenades at them; attacked them with \n25 \nchemical weapons; and beat them with hands and batons.  \n26 \n \n27  1Larry Buchanan, Quoctrung Bui, and Jugal K. Patel, Black Lives Matter May Be the Largest Movement in U.S. \nHistory, N.Y. Times (Jul. 3, 2020), https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-\n28  crowd-size.html. \n \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 3 of 59\n \n \n \n5.  Impact munitions are widely known to cause serious harm. These munitions, also \nknown as Projectile Impact Weapons (PIW), Specialty Impact Munitions (SIM), or Kinetic \n1 \nImpact Projectiles (KIP), can cause fractures, serious organ injuries, and death, especially \n2 \nwhen the point of impact is the head, neck, or torso.2 Two of the plaintiffs in this case were \n3 \nstruck in the eye: plaintiff M. MICHAEL ACOSTA lost his eye entirely, and plaintiff JOSEPH \n4 \nCAÑAS sustained permanent vision impairment. Police also shot several plaintiffs with impact \n5  munitions in the groin area. The groin is another area where impact munitions can cause \n6  serious injuries or death if shot into.3  \n7  6.  The CITY and its Police Department failed to establish policies to mitigate the risk of \n8  harm from impact munitions, were intentionally indifferent to the risk of these harms, and \ncaused Plaintiffs’ injuries. Indeed, the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ has admitted that “[c]rowd control \n9 \ntraining has been minimal and infrequent” and that most of the commanders and officers \n10 \nassigned to the events at issue in this case were not trained adequately.4 \n11 \n7.  The CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police have a long history of targeting Black, Brown, and \n12 \nMuslim communities, or people who they perceive as such, for racially discriminatory \n13 \np olicing, and unreasonable force. The pattern and practice of racially discriminatory policing \n14  persisted on the abovementioned dates, constituting discrimination based on race, religion and \n15  national origin. Racial justice protesters including Plaintiffs and others similarly situated were \n16  targeted by CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers to be shot and/or beaten. \n17  8.  Defendants CITY OF SAN JOSE; EDGARDO GARCIA; DAVID SYKES; and \nCHRISTOPHER DAVID KNOPF violated the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights by maintaining \n18 \ncustoms, policies and/or practices which would foreseeably result in constitutional violations \n19 \nsuch as those suffered by the plaintiffs, and/or by their deliberate indifference in the hiring, \n20 \ntraining, supervision and discipline of CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers involved in the \n21 \nMay 29 – June 7, 2020 operations. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that \n22 \nDefendants encouraged, tacitly authorized, and/or condoned unlawful customs, policies and/or \n23  practices: the use of excessive force; the failure to report the use of excessive force; the failure \n24 \n \n25 \n2Rohini J. Haar, et al., Death, injury and disability from kinetic impact projectiles in crowd-control settings: a \n26  systematic review. British Med. J.

The CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Department’s mass use of excessive force engulfed \ndowntown San José in toxic chemical agents and caused chaos and panic as police discharged \n9 \nexplosive Flashbang and Stinger grenades into the crowd, shot people with impact munitions, \n10 \nand used clubs and hands to beat demonstrators and push them to the ground. The burden of \n11 \nthese brutal tactics fell disproportionately on demonstrators and observers with disabilities, \n12 \nwho receive little or no notice or opportunity to comply with any police orders before the \n13 \np olice subjected them to excessive force.  \n14  II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n15  10.  This action seeks damages and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  This Court has \n16  jurisdiction over the action under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. It has supplemental jurisdiction \n17  over the state law claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1367.  \n11.  Venue properly lies within this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). The named \n18 \ndefendants perform their official duties in this District, and the events and omissions giving rise \n19 \nto plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this District.  \n20 \n12.  Plaintiffs M. MICHAEL ACOSTA; JOSEPH CAÑAS; LESLIE VASQUEZ; PETER \n21 \nALLEN; SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT; YESSICA RILES; JOSÉ GUSTAVO FLORES \n22 \nRODRIGUEZ; JOSÉPH MALDONADO; CINDY CUELLAR; MAHMOUDREZA NAEMEH; \n23  and MEGAN SWIFT have each filed administrative claims with the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ, in \n24  compliance with California Government Code § 910 et seq. All of the claims have been denied \n25  or have been deemed denied because they have been pending for more than 45 days. \n26  III. INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n13.  Pursuant to Local Rule 3-2(e), this action is properly assigned to the San José division of \n27 \nthis Court. \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         4 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 5 of 59\n \n \n \nIV. PARTIES \nA. PLAINTIFFS \n1 \nOrganization Plaintiffs \n2 \n14.  Plaintiff NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED \n3 \nPEOPLE OF SAN JOSÉ/ SILICON VALLEY (hereafter, NAACP) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit \n4 \norganization that works on issues related to equal access to education, voter empowerment, \n5  criminal justice, police misconduct, health equity, and economic growth for People of Color. The \n6  NAACP’s mission is to secure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of rights \n7  in order to eliminate race-based discrimination and ensure the health and well-being of all \n8  persons. NAACP’s constituents engage in public protest in San José on the issues NAACP is \nconcerned about, including institutional racism and police brutality, and wish to continue to do \n9 \nso in the future, but they are not able to participate in public protests in San José without fear of \n10 \nunlawful, racially discriminatory policing, excessive force, and arrest without probable cause. \n11 \nDefendants’ actions interfered with the NAACP’s constituents’ rights to assembly and speech. \n12 \nNAACP plans to assist in and participate in similar events to the late May – early June, 2020, \n13 \np rotests in the future, on its own or in conjunction with others, and is fearful that the same \n14  unlawful police actions in response to these and similar protests of institutional racism and police \n15  brutality will be repeated absent injunctive relief to prohibit the San José Police Department’s \n16  (hereafter, SJPD) practices, policies, and customs that caused the unlawful action in response to \n17  the recent protests.  \n15.  Plaintiff SAN JOSÉ PEACE AND JUSTICE CENTER (hereafter, SJPJC), is an \n18 \nunincorporated association and a project of the Collins Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. SJPJC \n19 \nwas established in 1957 as a resource and action center for progressive activism, seeking to \n20 \ndevelop and nurture the growing community of people who work to create and participate in a \n21 \njust, peaceful, and non-violent society, one that ensures human rights for all people and ensures \n22 \nthe continuation of, and respect for, all life on earth.  SJPJC serves more than 50 affiliated \n23  organizations, many of whom plan and/or participate in demonstrations in San José. SJPJC \n24  supported its constituent organizations in mobilizing for the late May – early June, 2020, \n25  demonstrations. SJPJC’s staff, volunteers and constituent organizations’ rights to speech and \n26  assembly were violated by the SJPD’s unlawful response to the demonstrations. SJPJC and its \nconstituent organizations plan to assist, plan, participate in, and hold similar events in the future, \n27 \nand are fearful that the same unlawful police actions in response to these and similar protests of \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         5 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 6 of 59\n \n \n \ninstitutional racism and police brutality will be repeated absent injunctive relief to prohibit the \nSJPD’s practices, policies, and customs that caused the unlawful action in response to the recent \n1 \nprotests. \n2 \nIndividual Plaintiffs \n3 \n16.  Plaintiff M. MICHAEL ACOSTA is a 49-year-old San José resident of mixed ethnicity \n4 \nwho works as an engineering manager. Mr. Acosta came across the May 29, 2020, demonstration \n5  while running an errand near his home in downtown San José, and decided to observe in support \n6  of the Black Lives Matter movement. He never expected that his left eye would be permanently \n7  destroyed that night, which it was when City of San Jose Police Officers JARED YUEN, \n8  CLIFFORD GRODIN and BILL NGUYEN shot him with an impact munition.  \n17.  Plaintiff JOSEPH MALDONADO is a 33-year-old, Latinx, San José resident who works \n9 \nas a Technology Administrator. Mr. MALDONADO was impacted by a chemical agent used by \n10 \nCITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers under the direction of Defendant LAGORIO when he \n11 \nparticipated in the May 29, 2020, demonstration. \n12 \n18.  Plaintiff MAHMOUDREZA NAEMEH is a 30-year-old, Iranian resident of Santa Cruz \n13 \nC  ounty who works as a chemical analyst. Mr. Naemeh attended the May 30, 2020, San José \n14  demonstration.

Plaintiff LESLIE VASQUEZ is a 32-year-old, Latinx, San José resident who works as a \n25  Service Line Coordinator in the maternity and children's health division at a local hospital.

Plaintiff PETER ALLEN is a 43-year-old white San José resident who works as a \n1 \nCommunications Specialist and is a former San José Planning Commissioner. Mr. Allen was \n2 \npushed to the ground by San Jose Police Officer S. Chua and Defendant JARED YUEN, and \n3 \nrepeatedly shot with impact munitions by CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers at the May 29, \n4 \n2020 demonstration. \n5  23.  Plaintiff SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT is a disabled, 51-year-old, white Santa Clara County \n6  resident, who attended the San José demonstrations on May 29 and 30, 2020 as a legal observer. \n7  Ms. Cartwright suffers from trigeminal neuralgia and has a brain implant to treat this that runs on \n8  a battery implanted in her chest. Her right knee was surgically replaced in October 2019, and her \nleft knee also needed replacement at the time of these incidents, so she was limping and \n9 \nfollowing the marches in her van at various times. Her van displayed a disabled placard, and on \n10 \nMay 29, she informed officers that she was disabled. On May 30, City of San Jose Police \n11 \nOfficers shot Ms. Cartwright in the right knee, left calf and finger with PIW. \n12 \n24.  Plaintiff YESSICA RILES is a 41-year-old Latinx San José resident who works as a \n13 \nL  abor and Delivery Nurse at a local hospital.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA. The CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers responded violently to protestors \n18 \nparticipating in demonstrations against racist police violence. \n19 \n52.  On May 25, 2020, Minneapolis police officers killed George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black \n20 \nresident. One white police officer knelt on Mr. Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes while three \n21 \nother officers observed. Mr. Floyd died calling out for his mother and begging for his life as \n22 \npassersby recorded. The recordings were shared on multiple media platforms for all of America \n23  to witness. \n24  53.  In the weeks and months following Mr. Floyd’s death, people across the country flooded \n25  into streets demanding an end to police brutality against Black people; protesting the deaths of \n26  Mr. Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and countless others by the hands of police through \nvigils, demonstrations, and public gatherings.  \n27 \n54.  In San José, demonstrators began to gather outside San José City Hall around 2 p.m. on \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         12 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 13 of 59\n \n \n \nMay 29, 2020, and then marched through the streets. Some participants carried signs denouncing \nthe policing system that kills Black people and other people of color. Other participants came \n1 \nwith medical supplies, water, and aid for the demonstrators. Finally, some, including journalists, \n2 \nlegal observers, and passersby, simply observed the demonstration. Most of the demonstrators \n3 \nand observers wore masks and observed social distancing. \n4 \n55.  The defendants would ultimately inflict the same sort of ruthless violence on the \n5  demonstrators that the demonstrators were protesting, indiscriminately dispersing tear gas into \n6  the crowd, shooting impact munitions without justification, beating demonstrators, and \n7  detonating explosive grenades to cause panic and disorientation.  \n8   \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19   \n \n20 \nB.  Defendants attacked and injured Plaintiffs at the Black Lives Matter \n21 \nprotests. \n22 \n56.  Plaintiffs JOSEPH CAÑAS and CINDY CUELLAR arrived separately at City Hall at \n23 \napproximately 2:00 p.m., intending to protest the Minneapolis Police murder of George Floyd, \n24 \nsystemic racism and police violence. Each watched as the crowd grew from a few scattered \n25  people to around one-hundred demonstrators, chanting their support for the Black Lives Matter \n26  movement and denouncing police brutality. The crowd marched from City Hall toward Highway \n27  101, where some demonstrators continued protesting and repeated their chants. Demonstrators \n28  safely exited the highway area and made their way back downtown, where organizers had \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         13 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 14 of 59\n \n \n \npublicized a rally with speakers in front of City Hall.  \n57.  Reverend Jethroe Moore II, President of NAACP, attended the demonstration to meet \n1 \nwith CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Chief of Police EDGARDO GARCIA with the intent to help \n2 \ncoordinate dialogue between protesters and the police. EDGARDO GARCIA and Rev. Moore \n3 \narranged for the meeting over the phone. However, when Rev. Moore arrived, he could not find \n4 \nEDGARDO GARCIA anywhere and neither did the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers \n5  answer his request to notify EDGARDO GARCIA of Rev. Moore’s arrival.  \n6  58.  Instead, as the \n7  demonstrators peacefully marched \n8  toward City Hall, CITY OF SAN \nJOSÉ Police Officers, on orders \n9 \nfrom defendant JASON DWYER \n10 \nand other supervisory defendants, \n11 \nformed a line behind the \n12 \ndemonstrators, at E. Santa Clara \n13 \na nd 8th Streets, and another line of \n14  police, including officers on foot, \n15  on motorcycles and in vehicles, \n \n16  blocked the marchers’ way at E.  Image 1. Demonstrator Khennedi Meeks, crying, \nfeeling disappointed and helpless to stop the violence.  \n17  Santa Clara and S. 7th Streets. \n \n59.  Blocked by the police line, \n18 \nthe plaintiffs and other demonstrators stopped marching. Plaintiffs did not see, hear, or perceive \n19 \nany unlawful or dangerous activity that would warrant this police action or the police use of \n20 \nforce that ensued. There was no justification for defendant DWYER’s decision that the \n21 \ndemonstration constituted an unlawful assembly. \n22 \n60.  Rev. Moore watched as CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers aggressively assembled and \n23  became concerned for the safety of the young people in the crowd. He instructed the people at \n24  the front of crowd—those closest to the police formation—to kneel before the law enforcement \n25  officers and pray. Several people did as Rev. Moore suggested. This was ineffective in \n26  deescalating the police response.  \n61.  The CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers aimed their weapons at the demonstrators and \n27 \nbegan to strike and jab protesters with batons in their faces, chest, and abdomen. The police \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         14 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 15 of 59\n \n \n \nshow of force quickly escalated to using chemical weapons, impact munitions and explosive \nflash-bang grenades and stinger grenades.  \n1 \n62.  Rev. Moore witnessed a CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer grab a young woman by her \n2 \nlegs from her kneeling position, exposing her undergarments and body to the crowd. Rev. Moore \n3 \nwitnessed multiple officers beat the head of a young demonstrator into the pavement. He saw \n4 \nanother young woman fall as she attempted to stand and move away from the aggressive forward \n5  movements of the police. But as Rev. Moore attempted to help her, CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \n6  Officers shoved them both. Defendant Ayala and other CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers \n7  then jabbed Rev. Moore in the ribs repeatedly and continued to shove him.  \n8  63.  Rev. Moore sat outside of the police lines to gather his breath and strength enough to \nleave downtown. However, before Rev. Moore could stand to leave, the police launched \n9 \nchemical weapons into the crowd. Rev. Moore could not see or breathe for several minutes, and \n10 \nsuffered from wheezing for months afterward.  \n11 \n64.  Plaintiff JOSEPH CAÑAS had been playing his guitar while marching, and continued to \n12 \nplay while blocked by the police. As he was standing, peacefully playing the guitar about 5 p.m., \n13 \nh e heard an announcement from the police, but could not make out the words. Suddenly, \n14  defendant JARED YUEN or another CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer shot Mr. Cañas in the \n15  eye with an impact munition, causing searing pain and permanently damaging his vision. YUEN \n16  and other officers were integral participants in the virtually simultaneous indiscriminate mass \n17  shooting by multiple officers; and observed and had the opportunity to intervene but failed to \nintervene to stop \n18 \nuse of excessive \n19 \nforce against \n20 \nPlaintiff Cañas \n21 \nby fellow \n22 \nofficers. \n23  65.  The \n24  impact caused \n25  Mr. Cañas to \n26  collapse to the \nground in the \n27   \nImage 2. Mr. Cañas on the ground after impact being tended by other  middle of the \n28  civilians. \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         15 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 16 of 59\n \n \n \nstreet. No CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \nOfficers came to Mr. Cañas’ aid or \n1 \nsummoned aid for him. Other demonstrators \n2 \npicked him up, gave him first aid, and \n3 \nhelped him get home.  \n4 \n66.  Plaintiff CINDY CUELLAR \n5  watched the defendants shoot impact \n6  munitions into the crowd while she was \n7  standing in front of City Hall. She saw the \n8  munitions hit demonstrators and cause them \nto fall to the ground. Some demonstrators \n9 \nscrambled in horror and attempted to run \n10 \naway from Defendants. \n11 \n67.  Ms. Cuellar saw a CITY OF SAN \n12 \nJOSÉ Police Officer shoot a journalist she \n \n13  Image 3. Ms. Cuellar’s bleeding left calf  \n  knew with a munition. Ms. Cuellar started to \n14  go to her friend’s aid, but defendants ADGAR, MORAN, NGUYEN, GRODIN,  SIMONINI, \n15  and/or another CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer shot her, too, causing a white hot, \n16  excruciating pain in her left calf. The impact and pain sent her tumbling toward the ground. \n17  ADGAR, MORAN, NGUYEN, GRODIN and SIMONINI were integral participants in the \nvirtually simultaneous indiscriminate mass shooting by multiple officers; and observed and had \n18 \nthe opportunity to intervene but failed to intervene to stop use of excessive force against Plaintiff \n19 \nCuellar by fellow officers. \n20 \n68.  Other demonstrators caught Ms. Cuellar before she hit the ground. A demonstrator \n21 \napplied disinfectant to Ms. Cuellar’s wound, which had immediately bruised and swelled.  No \n22 \nCITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer came to Ms. Cuellar’s aid or summoned aid for her. \n23  69.  As Ms. Cuellar sat to tend to her wound, she witnessed CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \n24  Officers cover their faces with gas masks, and then shoot rounds of tear gas and explosive \n25  Stinger grenades and/or flash-bang grenades into the crowd. It became so frightening that Ms. \n26  Cuellar decided she needed to go home, as she would not be able to run from the munitions the \npolice were shooting into the crowd. Walking on her injured leg made the wound bleed heavily.  \n27 \n70.  Plaintiffs LESLIE VASQUEZ and YESSICA RILES, sisters, also went to the May 29, \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         16 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 17 of 59\n \n \n \n2020, San José demonstration to protest the Minneapolis Police murder of George Floyd, \nsystemic racism and police violence, arriving around 4 p.m. When the police arrived in the civic \n1 \ncenter area, the sisters became separated in the crowd. \n2 \n71.  As Ms. Vasquez walked toward E. \n3 \nSanta Clara and S. 7th Streets, she saw police \n4 \nwere shooting a young woman with impact \n5  munitions. When Ms. Vasquez tried to help \n6  the woman, defendant JARED YUEN, \n7  defendant MICHAEL SIMONINI, and/or \n8  another CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer \nshot her in the groin at close range with an \n9 \nimpact munition. YUEN, SIMONINI and \n10 \nother officers were integral participants in the \n11 \nvirtually simultaneous indiscriminate mass \n12 \nshooting by multiple officers; and observed \n13 \na nd had the opportunity to intervene but \n14  failed to intervene to stop use of excessive \n15  force against Plaintiff by fellow officers. \n16  72.  Another CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \n17  Officer hit Ms. Vasquez in the stomach with  Image 4 - Leslie Vasquez \nhis baton multiple times and pushed her, even \n18 \nthough she put her hands up.   \n19 \n73.   Ms. Riles walked toward S. 7th Street looking for her sister, Ms. Vasquez, when she \n20 \nheard shooting. At the intersection of E. Santa Clara and S. 7th Streets, she saw Ms. Vasquez \n21 \nstanding in front of the police line with her hands up.  \n22 \n74.  Ms. Riles put her hands up too in a gesture of “Don’t shoot”, and crossed the street, \n23  intending to get her sister and leave. But then, without warning, officer MICHAEL SIMONINI \n24  and/or another CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer took aim at and shot her, too, in the abdomen \n25  with an impact munition. Ms. Riles heard multiple shots and felt searing pain as the CITY OF \n26  SAN JOSÉ Police Officer shot her in the groin, pelvic region and abdomen, repeatedly, and other \nofficers shot people around her.

No CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers came to Ms. Vasquez’ or Ms. Riles’ aid or \n18 \nsummoned aid for them. \n19  76.  Defendants failed to give clear warnings before using force against the plaintiffs. Ms. \n20  Riles first heard the police give an amplified dispersal order after they had already shot her and \n21  multiple others. Other plaintiffs did not hear or could not make out an order, or understood that \nthey were complying with the orders by walking west on E. Santa Clara St., the only direction \n22 \nthe police gave as to where to go. \n23 \n77.  Plaintiff GUSTAVO FLORES participated in the May 29, 2020, demonstration to protest \n24 \nthe Minneapolis Police murder of George Floyd, systemic racism and police violence. Shortly \n25 \nafter 5:00 p.m., Mr. Flores walked in the direction of Mexican Heritage Plaza with other \n26 \ndemonstrators, when their path was blocked by CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers who had \n27 \nformed a line across E. Santa Clara St. between 8th and 9th Streets.  \n28  78.  Mr. Flores was near the front of the crowd when he heard a CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         18 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 19 of 59\n \n \n \nOfficer tell the other CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers, softly, “Get ready to shoot!” \nDefendants did not make any announcement or warning to the crowd. Mr. Flores tried to warn \n1 \nthe other demonstrators, walking down the front line of demonstrators suggesting they put their \n2 \nhands up in a gesture of “Don’t shoot!”, to show they were unarmed did not pose a threat.  But \n3 \nbefore Mr. Flores reached the end of the line, defendant officer GAONA, SIMONINI, and/or \n4 \nanother CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer shot him in the groin and testicle with an impact \n5  munition.  \n6  79.  Mr. Flores fell to the ground as a result of being shot. As he stood up, he saw that \n7  GAONA, SIMONINI, and/or another CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer was reloading his \n8  gun. Mr. Flores tried to walk away, limping from his injury. Someone in the crowd warned Mr. \nFlores that the officer was aiming at him again. When Mr. Flores turned to look, defendant \n9 \nofficer GAONA, SIMONINI, and/or another CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer shot him in the \n10 \nleft collarbone with another impact munition.  \n11 \n80.  GAONA, SIMONINI and other officers were integral participants in the virtually \n12 \nsimultaneous indiscriminate mass shooting by multiple officers; and observed and had the \n13 \no pportunity to intervene but failed to intervene to stop use of excessive force against Plaintiff by \n14  fellow officers. \n15  81.  Mr. Flores saw CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers shoot other people who, like him, \n16  were doing no wrong and presenting no threat.  \n17  82.  No CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers provided or summoned aid for Mr. Flores.  \n83.  Plaintiff JOSÉPH MALDONADO went to the May 29, 2020, San José demonstration to \n18 \nprotest the Minneapolis Police murder of George Floyd, systemic racism and police violence, \n19 \narriving after the police had blocked Santa Clara at 7th Street. Mr. Maldonado observed only \n20 \npeaceful demonstrating - nothing that would justify the use of chemical weapons - but noticed \n21 \nthat the police put on gas masks.  \n22 \n84.  Mr. Maldonado heard no warning before CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers launched \n23  a chemical agent, most likely teargas, into the crowd. The gas felt like it slapped Mr. Maldonado \n24  in the face. He experienced an intense burning sensation like no pain he had ever experienced \n25  before: “like a thousand needles hitting your eyeballs at once.” \n26  85.  Mr. Maldonado ran, and a stranger gave him some water to rinse his eyes. The CITY OF \nSAN JOSÉ Police Officers did not offer decontamination or any other form of aid. \n27 \n86.  At 6:15 p.m., the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Department moved its line of officers to \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         19 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 20 of 59\n \n \n \n5th and Santa Clara. At 6:30 p.m., they began to use “flashbang grenades” and “OC Blast \ngrenades” or \"Stinger grenades”5 on the crowd, grenades that explode with a very loud bang and \n1 \nbright flash of light, and are designed to cause panic and chaos. These grenades can cause \n2 \ntemporary or permanent hearing loss, burns, and impact injuries.. The Stinger grenades also \n3 \ncontain pepper spray and release rubber pellets indiscriminately in all directions.6  \n4 \n87.    Plaintiff M. MICHAEL ACOSTA tried to go shopping on May 29, 2020, but discovered \n5  that both Walmart and Target were closed. As he was driving back to his residence in downtown \n6  San José, he became aware that a large demonstration was going on in response to the \n7  ///  \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n \n21  5The San Jose Police Department’s “Special Operations division is equipped with DEFTECH 1095 / CTS 9594 OC \nBlast Stinger Grenades. These are hand-thrown less lethal grenades that utilize OC powder and/or stinger balls and a \n22  ‘flashbang’ (startling light & concussive sound effect) to disperse a crowd. The blast is sufficient to project the \nrubber balls and chemical agents in a 50-foot radius, all around the point of impact such that anyone in the vicinity \n23  could be struck or affected.

Mr. Acosta realized that this was a historic event \nand wanted to show \n1 \nsolidarity with the Black \n2 \nLives Matter movement, \n3 \nand to document the \n4 \ndemonstration. He \n5  parked at his building \n6  and walked around \n7  taking photos and video \n8    with his cell phone over \nImage 7. Impact munition circled in red heading towards Mr. \nAcosta.   an approximately five \n9 \n \nblock area. He observed \n10 \nthat the demonstration \n11 \nwas peaceful. \n12 \n88. But unbeknownst to \n13 \n  Mr. Acosta, around 7 \n14  p.m., a reported white \n15  supremacist deliberately \n16  drove a grey SUV into \n17  the crowd, hitting two \npeople near 3rd and E. \n18 \nSanta Clara and sending \n19 \ndemonstrators running \n20 \nand screaming. CITY OF \n21 \nSAN JOSÉ Police \n22 \nOfficers shot impact \n \n23  Image 8. Impact munition circled in red right before hitting Mr.  munitions at the vehicle, \nAcosta. \n24  which broke the \n25  windshield, and arrested the driver.  \n26  89.  As Mr. Acosta walked home on E. Santa Clara between 3rd and 4th Streets, he saw the \ngrey SUV abandoned on the corner of 3rd Street. This was the SUV that had struck people a \n27 \nshort time earlier and one or more people pushing a burning dumpster into it. \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         21 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 22 of 59\n \n \n \n90.   Mr. Acosta was not \nsure how to get onto 3rd \n1 \nStreet safely, and the police \n2 \nline was blocking the way \n3 \nto 4th Street. Suddenly, \n4 \nDOE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ \n5  Police Officers threw \n6  exploding “flash-bang” \n7  and/or Stinger grenades \n8  nearby, and the crowd \nbegan to run.  \n9 \n91.  At approximately \n10 \n7:09pm, without warning, \n11 \nDefendants JARED YUEN, \n12 \nBILL NGUYEN and/or \n13 \nC  LIFFORD GRODIN shot \n14  Mr. Acosta in the eye with \n15  an impact munition. \n16  YUEN, NGUYEN, and \n   \n17  GRODIN were integral  Image 9. Mr. Acosta’s eye after the initial eye surgery but \nparticipants in the virtually  before the enucleation surgery. \n18 \nsimultaneous indiscriminate mass shooting by multiple officers; and observed and had the \n19 \nopportunity to intervene but failed to intervene to stop use of excessive force against Plaintiff by \n20 \nfellow officers.  \n21 \n92.  Mr. Acosta instantly lost all vision and fell to one knee. The next few moments were the \n22 \nmost terrifying of his life; he remained on the ground, unable to see, while listening to explosions \n23  and people rushing by. No CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers came to Mr. Acosta’s aid or \n24  summoned medical aid for him.  \n25  93.  Fortunately, demonstrators dragged Mr. Acosta to safety. They bandaged a bleeding \n26  laceration above his eye and helped him into his nearby residence. Vision returned to his right \neye, but not his left eye which was the one that had been hit. \n27 \n94.  A friend took Mr. Acosta to the hospital later that night, where he learned that the \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         22 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 23 of 59\n \n \n \nmunition had caused a severe ruptured globe injury, as well as multiple fractures to the \nsurrounding orbital of his left eye. The laceration on his face also required stitches. \n1 \n95.  Mr. Acosta had to be transported to a different hospital for immediate eye surgery to try \n2 \nto repair the rupture. However, vision in his left eye could not be restored. Eventually, Mr. \n3 \nAcosta had to undergo further surgery to completely remove his eye globe as a result of being \n4 \nshot by Yuen, Nguyen and/or Grodin. \n5  96.  As local media covered the defendants’ violent reaction to the demonstration, additional \n6  San José residents began to arrive to aid the demonstrators, but they, too, were met with CITY \n7  OF SAN JOSÉ police violence.  \n8  97.  Plaintiff MEGAN SWIFT heard about the police violence and went to find the May 29, \n2020, demonstration at the Plaza de César Chávez in downtown San José in order to bring aid in \n9 \nsupport of the racial justice demonstrators. She brought a book bag filled with water and first aid \n10 \nmaterials, including gauze and gloves.  \n11 \n98.  When she arrived between 8:30 and 9 p.m., Ms. SWIFT observed a crowd of mostly \n12 \nyoung people, chanting and holding signs, while some passersby observed from a distance. \n13 \nS  uddenly, CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers charged the crowd with guns and/or launchers \n14  raised, while throwing explosive flashbang and/or OC Blast Stinger grenades into the crowd. The \n15  mood abruptly shifted to panic and the demonstrators began to scatter.  \n16  99.  At this point, Ms. Swift noticed CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers form a line with \n17  batons held crosswise from the bodies, and march toward her. On orders from Defendants \nTASSIO and DWYER, the police yelled “Move” at the demonstrators while simultaneously \n18 \npushing Ms. Swift and others back with their clubs. Ms. Swift tried to comply by stepping back, \n19 \nbut defendant STEPHEN MICHAEL CURRY #4700, VICTOR AYALA and other CITY OF \n20 \nSAN JOSÉ Police Officers stepped out of the police line multiple times to strike Ms. Swift hard \n21 \nin two-handed blows with their clubs.  \n22 \n100.  A nearby demonstrator yelled at the officer to stop hitting Ms. Swift. Defendant CURRY \n23  clubbed Ms. Swift one more time, and then grabbed her and dragged her through and behind the \n24  police line. He took her book bag with force and then proceeded to handcuff her with her hands \n25  behind her back.  \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         23 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 24 of 59\n \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n \n11 \nImage 9. Bruising on Ms. Swift's arm. \n12 \n101.  Plaintiff PETER ALLEN walked to the May 29, 2020, demonstration from his home, to \n13 \np rotest the Minneapolis Police murder of George Floyd, systemic racism and police violence. \n14 \nMr. Allen joined the demonstration at the Plaza de César Chávez around 8:30 p.m. and sat on the \n15  edge of the stage.  \n16  102.  Mr. Allen observed that the crowd was peaceful and posed no threat to the police. \n17  Suddenly, CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers acting on orders from Defendants TASSIO and \nDWYER charged the demonstrators while throwing explosive flashbangs and/or OC Blast \n18 \nStinger grenades into the crowd. Mr. Allen tried to back away but before he could do so, Officer \n19 \nShannon Chua shoved him forcefully to the ground with his baton. Mr. Allen again tried to stand \n20 \nand back away, but Defendant JARED YUEN shoved him to the ground again.  \n21 \n103.  Mr. Allen scrambled up and jogged away from the police line. When he was about 20 \n22 \nyards from them, he turned to face them with his hands up in a gesture of “Don’t shoot” while \n23 \nbacking away from them, but a CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer proceeded to shoot him in \n24  the left upper thigh with an impact munition.  \n25  104.  Moments later, a CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer shot him again, this time in the left \n26  upper chest with an impact munition.  \n27 \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         24 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 25 of 59\n \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n \n12 \nImage 10. Bruise on Mr. Allen's thigh. \n13 \n1 05.  Another anti-police violence/racial justice demonstration took place in downtown San \n14 \nJosé on Saturday, May 30, 2020. That evening, near City Hall, CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \n15  Officers again, without warning, fired munitions, grenades, and chemical agents into the crowd \n16  of demonstrators.  \n17  106.  Plaintiff SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT attended the May 30, 2020, San José demonstration, \nas a legal observer, when CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers used chemical agents against her \n18 \nand the demonstrators. Ms. Cartwright stayed in what she thought was a safe spot against a wall \n19 \non 4th Street by City Hall, because she was physically unable to run due to her knee condition: \n20 \nher right knee had been surgically replaced and her left knee needed replacement. Then, a CITY \n21 \nOF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer shot at her four times in quick succession with impact munitions. \n22 \nMunitions struck her right knee (the one that had recently been replaced), her left calf, and her \n23 \npinkie finger. The fourth shot whizzed by, barely missing her hip. \n24  107.  Plaintiff MAHMOUDREZA NAEMEH went to the May 30, 2020, demonstration in San \n25  José to protest the Minneapolis Police murder of George Floyd, systemic racism and police \n26  violence against Black people. Mr. Naemeh was wearing Muslim prayer beads, a gift from his \nmother. He arrived at about 2:30 p.m. near City Hall, and took photos as a small crowd gathered. \n27 \nAround 5:30 p.m., Mr. Naemeh marched to the library with the other demonstrators. Some of the \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         25 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 26 of 59\n \n \n \ndemonstrators engaged in a die-in, lying down on the ground for a couple of minutes. There were \nspeakers and chanting, conveying their message against police violence and racism.  \n1 \n108.  At about 6:30 p.m., CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers blocked the intersection of E. \n2 \nSanta Clara and 4th Streets with a line of officers, increasing tension so that police and \n3 \ndemonstrators began yelling at each other. Mr. Naemeh walked backward on the sidewalk away \n4 \nfrom the police with his hands up, but Defendant Officer C. WEBER pointed plaintiff NAEMEH \n5  out to defendant ORABUENA as someone to shoot, and ORABUENA shot him in the shin just \n6  below his knee with an impact munition.  \n7  109.  After he was shot, Mr. Naemeh tried to take cover and walked between the buildings \n8  back to 4th and San Fernando, but the line of police came down and blocked the street at that \nlocation and began shooting. Mr. Naemeh walked away and continued looking for the friend who \n9 \nwas giving him a ride home \n10 \n110.  At 2nd and San Fernando Streets, Mr. Naemeh came upon a small group of \n11 \ndemonstrators and walked with them to the Plaza de César Chávez. Suddenly, a large group of \n12 \nCITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers charged toward them on foot and motorcycles. Mr. \n13 \nN  aemeh and others ran, but defendant SITU, and other CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers \n14  came from all directions, surrounding the demonstrators so that they could not leave. Defendant \n15  officer SITU then tackled and arrested Mr. Naemeh along with about thirty to forty other people \n16  at around 8:30 - 9 p.m, knocking NAEMEH to the ground with excessive force even though he \n17  was trying to submit.  \n111.  The CITY OF SAN JOSÉ and its police neither provided nor summoned medical aid for \n18 \nany of the plaintiffs they had shot with impact munitions or subjected to chemical weapons on \n19 \nMay 29 and 30, 2020.  \n20 \n112.  None of the plaintiffs presented a threat or engaged in any conduct justifying any use of \n21 \nforce by the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers at any time.  \n22 \n113.  The force of the munitions knocked the plaintiffs and class members off their feet and/or \n23  otherwise restricted their freedom of movement by stopping them in their tracks and causing \n24  injuries. People who were trying to disperse or back up in compliance with police orders were as \n25  likely to be shot as people who stood still. Clouds of chemical agents prevented plaintiffs and \n26  other assembled persons from escaping. Others were temporarily stopped from getting to injured \npersons to aid them and helping them to safety. \n27 \n114.  Defendants egregiously restrained and intruded upon the liberty and privacy of plaintiffs \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         26 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 27 of 59\n \n \n \nby their show of force in striking plaintiffs about their bodies with munitions and explosives, and \nassaulting plaintiffs with chemical agents in their eyes, noses and mouths. \n1 \n115.  As a direct and proximate cause of the conduct described herein, the named individual \n2 \nplaintiffs and the class members have been denied their constitutional, statutory, and legal rights \n3 \nas stated herein, and have suffered general and special damages, including but not limited to, \n4 \nmental and emotional distress, physical injuries and bodily harm, loss of wages and damage to \n5  career, pain, fear, humiliation, embarrassment, discomfort, and anxiety and other damages in an \n6  amount according to proof.  \n7  C. Defendants’ excessive force impeded each of the plaintiffs’ ability to continue \n8  exercising their First Amendment rights and continues to chill their First \nAmendment rights.  \n9 \n116.  Each of the plaintiffs continues to desire, and possesses the intention, to peacefully and \n10 \nlawfully assemble and express their views in opposition to police racist violence and related \n11 \nissues in San José, but the defendants’ indiscriminate and excessive use of munitions, explosive \n12 \ngrenades and chemical agents is causing them to fear that when they participate in such \n13 \ne xpressive activities, the defendants will injure them again by such indiscriminate, unlawful \n14  and/or excessive use of force that harmed them and other persons engaged in lawful and peaceful \n15  activity on May 29 and 30, 2020. \n16  117.  Plaintiff MEGAN SWIFT suffered sizeable and painful bruising as a result of the actions \n17  of the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police, including defendant Officers CURRY and AYALA. Since \nbeing beaten on May 29, 2020, she has felt nervous and scared around officers. She is not only \n18 \nafraid for herself, but for friends who interact with the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police. Ms. Swift is \n19 \nupset and embarrassed that her daughters saw her injured by the police. While she still wants to \n20 \nhelp make social change, she feels helpless and is more hesitant to participate in demonstrations \n21 \nin San José as a result of Defendants’ misconduct. \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         27 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 28 of 59\n \n \n \n118.  After the protest on May 29, Plaintiff LESLIE VASQUEZ went to work, but tried not to \nwalk as she was in so much pain. Unfortunately, her job requires her to walk all over a large \n1 \nhospital. She usually does so easily, but the pain made walking so unbearable, that she did her \n2 \nbest to avoid walking for about two weeks. She felt this decision impacted how she functioned at \n3 \nwork and as a parent. Because of the location of the bruises, she was too embarrassed to tell \n4 \nanyone, or ask for help managing the pain. As a result, the only medication she took was \n5  Tylenol. The week after the May 29 protest, she had a gynecologist appointment, and seeing her \n6  enormous bruises, her doctor was concerned that Ms. Vasquez was being abused. This upset and \n7  embarrassed Ms. Vasquez. She avoided seeing her partner until the bruises healed, and is still \n8  uncomfortable wearing shorts or other clothing that exposes what is now permanent scarring. \nMs. Vasquez feels scared that this happened just because she was trying to help someone. As a \n9 \nresult of defendants’ misconduct, she is hesitant to attend San José demonstrations or be around \n10 \npolice.  \n11 \n119.  Plaintiff JOSÉPH MALDONADO has suffered from anxiety, tension, and difficulty \n12 \nsleeping as a result of the police violence on May 29, 2020, and his performance at work has \n13 \ns uffered. Mr. Maldonado lives in \n14  the downtown area where the police \n15  violence occurred, and going to his \n16  usual grocery store or even just \n17  leaving his house triggers his \nanxiety and memories of the \n18 \nexperience of being teargassed. He \n19 \nhas only attended one other \n20 \ndemonstration since then, and when \n21 \nthe group started marching, Mr. \n22 \nMaldonado became so anxious that \n23  he had to step out. He stood to the \n24  side because he didn’t feel safe. As \n25  a result of Defendants’ misconduct, \n26  Mr. Maldonado distrusts police and \nfeels they are dangerous to him.  \n27   \nImage 11.

The shooting deeply affected him and caused him continuing psychological \n1 \ntrauma.  \n2 \n121.  Plaintiff M. MICHAEL ACOSTA remained in severe pain over the month after \n3 \nDefendants shot him in the eye. Doctors advised him that he was at risk for sympathetic \n4 \nophthalmia of his right eye, which could result in complete blindness. Mr. Acosta ultimately had \n5  to have his left eye enucleated – surgically removed – as a result of the severe injury caused by \n6  being shot with an impact munition by Defendants Yuen, Nguyen and/or Grodin. \n7  122.  Mr. Acosta missed weeks of work after he was shot. After having the surgery to remove \n8  his eye on July 1, 2020, he is no longer in pain, but struggled to adjust to his new monocular, \nimpaired vision, and to the trauma of being shot by the police and losing a part of his body. In \n9 \nNovember, 2020, Mr. Acosta was fitted with a prosthetic eye for his eye socket. He experiences \n10 \ncontinuing numbness on the left side of his face, which is a constant reminder of the fact that his \n11 \neye is missing. In September, 2022, he had to undergo a third surgery to reconstruct his eye \n12 \nsocket, which was sinking due to the severe damage from the police munition. \n13 \n1 23.  The loss of his eye, emotional trauma, and reduced vision have impacted every aspect of \n14  Mr. Acosta’s personal and professional life. At first, he could not leave the house by himself. He \n15  is now more independent, but has particular difficulty at night. His impaired vision precluded \n16  him from driving until recently, which was extraordinarily inconvenient given his continuing \n17  need to see doctors for his injuries. For example, a follow-up medical appointment with the \nocularist involved more than six hours round trip on public transportation unless a friend was \n18 \navailable to drive him. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and Santa Clara County public \n19 \nhealth orders, each time Mr. Acosta was forced to take public transportation for such a long trip, \n20 \nhe had to then quarantine himself for two weeks from his small social “bubble”. In February, \n21 \n2021, Mr. Acosta began to try driving again but only in daylight and good weather. Driving is \n22 \nvery challenging and he feels very nervous, and still cannot drive at all at night. Mr. Acosta has a \n23  demanding position at Apple, and work, too, has been a struggle. \n24  124.  Before he was shot, if Mr. Acosta became aware of a protest nearby in his neighborhood \n25  of downtown San José, he would want to see what was going on and potentially observe and \n26  document as he did on May 29, 2020. Now, if he is out walking and hears the sound of a protest, \nhe feels uncomfortable and immediately heads to the safety of his home. \n27 \n125.  Plaintiff JOSEPH CAÑAS was struck in the eye with the impact munition as well, \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         29 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 30 of 59\n \n \n \nleaving him with a black eye and blurred vision. Over the following days he had continued pain, \nand although this gradually eased, his vision continued to be impaired. Mr. Cañas has trouble \n1 \nreading, viewing lighted screens, adjusting to brightness, and experiences flashes, floaters and \n2 \nissues with depth perception and peripheral vision with his left eye. This vision impairment is \n3 \npermanent and he must now wear glasses which he never needed before. The glasses are helpful, \n4 \nbut do not completely alleviate the problems caused by being shot in the eye. \n5  126.  Mr. Cañas still feels strongly about police racism and violence and would like to express \n6  his views through street demonstrations. But, since he was shot, he has not been as active in \n7  demonstrations because he experiences anxiety about the police injuring him again. He knows \n8  from experience that even if he is being peaceful, he can still pay a price for being in the crowd. \nIf he does attend a demonstration, he is always looking over his shoulder.  \n9 \n127.  Mr. Cañas moved out of San José after the May 29 incident in large part because he felt \n10 \nanxious about police retaliation. After he was shot, his name and photograph appeared in the San \n11 \nJosé Mercury News, and he found out that he was mentioned on a CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \n12 \nprivate Facebook page that has been exposed as a forum for racist and anti-Muslim hate speech \n13 \nb y current and former CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers.7 On the Facebook page, a recently \n14  retired CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer, Steve Wilson, seems to be referring to Mr. Cañas in \n15  a publicized post which called Mr. Cañas an “idiot” who deserved to have his eye injured, and \n16  referred to the demonstrators as “trash”.8  This caused Mr. Cañas considerable anxiety.  \n17  128.  Plaintiff GUSTAVO FLORES, too, had his life upended by Defendants’ act of \nintentionally shooting him in the groin, genitals and collarbone in retaliation for warning other \n18 \nprotestors that the police were preparing to shoot them. Mr. Flores was shocked when the police \n19 \nshot not only him, but others in his vicinity, including an elderly woman and a young boy.  \n20 \n129.  Mr. Flores suffered severe bruising, and continuing pain and disability that only gradually \n21 \nimproved over the following months. He struggled with everyday activities such as lifting things, \n22 \ndoing chores, or getting groceries.  \n23  130.  The injuries Defendants caused prevented Mr. Flores from working and earning his \n24  regular full-time income for months. Mr. Flores, a tow truck driver, was unable to work from \n25  May 30, 2020, until approximately June 22, 2020. He then returned to work part time even \n26 \n \n27  7Charlie Paulsen, Racism and Hate Behind the Blue Wall: Exposing Secret Law Enforcement Facebook Group, \nNoteworthy – The Journal Blog (Jun. 26, 2020), https://blog.usejournal.com/racism-and-hate-behind-the-blue-wall-\n28  exposing-secret-law-enforcement-facebook-groups-6cf23a596a98. \n8Id. \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         30 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 31 of 59\n \n \n \nthough he was not completely healed. He needed the \nincome to pay basic living expenses but could only \n1 \nwork part-time due to his continuing serious \n2 \nshoulder and groin pain. \n3 \n131.  There is still a hard, painful lump in Mr. \n4 \nFlores’ testicle. \n5  132.  Defendants’ violent actions shook Mr. \n6  Flores to the core and made him much more hesitant \n7  to express advocacy against white supremacy and \n8  for changes in policing. \n133.  Plaintiff PETER ALLEN suffered severe \n9 \nbruising to his leg, chest, and rib area as a result of \n10 \nDefendants’ violence. He had to stay off his feet for \n11 \na few days after May 29, 2020. The bruises lasted \n12   \nfor a month, and Mr. Allen still feels some pain \nImage 12. Ms. Cartwright’s knee.  \n13 \n  when walking. \n14  134.  Since being shot by Defendants on May 29, Mr. Allen feels apprehensive to participate in \n15  demonstrations in San José. When he pushed himself to attend another rally at City Hall in San \n16  José, he found that when he walked past the street where he was shot, his leg began to throb and \n17  he experienced anxiety. In fact, whenever he finds himself at the Plaza de César Chávez his heart \nrate goes up and he has flashbacks of the police charging and shooting him on May 29.  \n18 \n135.  Mr. Allen has beautiful memories of the Plaza de César Chávez, one of San José’s oldest \n19 \nparks, which he considers the heart of the city. It was the site of his first date with his wife. They \n20 \nwere married in the nearby Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph, and took wedding photographs in \n21 \nthe Plaza with the cathedral tower in the background. Mr. Allen remembers seeing this same \n22 \ntower when he was being shot. It really upsets Mr. Allen that his beautiful memories of this park \n23  are now tarnished by the police violence and that he will no longer be able to fully enjoy Plaza \n24  de César Chávez because of the negative emotions and memories associated with the May 29, \n25  2020, police violence.  \n26  136.  Mr. Allen continues to be a part of civic life and does not like letting defendants’ actions \nget in the way of expressing himself and his values, yet the trauma of having been brutalized on \n27 \nMay 29 gives him pause. \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         31 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 32 of 59\n \n \n \n137.  Plaintiff SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT incurred multiple physical injuries and Post \nTraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a result of Defendants’ violence. This has made her daily \n1 \nactivities such as driving, hearing sounds, and seeing police officers difficult. Ms. Cartwright \n2 \ndreads going to bed because she wakes up, startled, repeatedly throughout the night. Every time \n3 \nMs. Cartwright leaves her house, her leg shakes, she breathes heavily and starts hyperventilating. \n4 \nHer trigeminal neuralgia requires that she not express herself through her facial muscles, but the \n5  PTSD causes her to use these muscles, triggering excruciating pain. Ms. Cartwright must \n6  struggle to hold back her tears and emotions to avoid unbearable pain in her face. \n7  138.  Ms. Cartwright now has a permanent scar on her right knee where she was shot. Seeing \n8  this is extremely upsetting as it reminds her of the pain and Defendants’ wrongful actions \ntowards her. \n9 \n139.  Ms. Cartwright still wishes to attend demonstrations, but feels traumatized by the \n10 \nviolence Defendants inflicted on her on May 30, 2020, and must overcome this in order to \n11 \nexercise her First Amendment rights.  \n12 \n140.  For at least a month after she was shot, the bruises on Plaintiff YESSICA RILES’ \n13 \n  abdomen and pelvis were tender, and it was difficult \n14  and painful for her to breastfeed and care for her \n15  baby. As a result of the police violence, she had \n16  trouble sleeping, was restless, tearful, and often felt \n17  uneasy for an even longer time.  \n141.  Ms. Riles is afraid to express her views by \n18 \nattending demonstrations as a result of being shot on \n19 \nMay 29, although she has overcome this to attend \n20 \none demonstration that had little police presence. \n21 \nEver since May 29, 2020, when Ms. Riles sees \n22 \npolice officers, her heart rate goes up and she \n23  experiences anxiety. Just the thought of that day \n24  causes Ms. Riles to feel sick to her stomach. For \n25  example, the sound of loud fireworks on July 4th and \n26  New Year’s Eve brought back the memory of the \n \n27  Image 13. Ms. Cartwright’s knee.   police violence, causing Ms. Riles to experience \n \nanxiety and difficulty sleeping.  \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         32 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 33 of 59\n \n \n \n142.  Plaintiff CINDY CUELLAR’s calf injury continued to hurt for more than two weeks \nafter the incident. Walking was difficult, and she needed help doing ordinary life activities that \n1 \ninvolved standing, such as showering and cooking.  \n2 \n143.  The May 29, 2020, police misconduct was draining for Ms. Cuellar physically, \n3 \npsychologically and mentally, and being physically unable to participate in the subsequent \n4 \ndemonstrations over the following two weeks was frustrating. \n5  144.  Ms. Cuellar has a permanent scar now reminding her that the police shot her. \n6  D. Defendants targeted Black, Indigenous, and other people of color when \n7  using excessive force to break up the crowd.  \n8  145.  Defendants targeted the May 29-31 demonstrations for excessive force and imposition of \na curfew because the message of the demonstrations was focused on police racist killings of \n9 \nBlack people. Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police have \n10 \nnever used the amount or level of excessive force used against the May 29 and 30, and 31 \n11 \nprotests, against any San José demonstration that was not focused on police killings of Black \n12 \npeople and other people of color.  \n13 \n1 46.  YESSICA RILES saw a CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officer repeatedly strike her sister \n14  LESLIE VASQUEZ with a baton, and when a White woman asked why they were targeting \n15  people of color instead of her, the SAN JOSÉ Police Officer hit her sister, who is Latina, harder \n16  with the baton. At the same time, there was a Muslim woman wearing a hijab to the left of Ms. \n17  Vasquez. The White woman was still asking the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers why they \nwere targeting people of color when those officers then arrested the Muslim hijabi woman. \n18 \n147.  Moreover, the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Department has a well-documented history of \n19 \ndiscriminatory policing, failing to adequately address the behavior that precipitates \n20 \ndiscriminatory policing, and fostering a culture of white supremacy. \n21 \n148.  Defendants have long stopped, cited, and arrested people of color at considerably \n22 \ndisproportionate rates. In 1999, SJPD was found to stop Black and Latinx drivers at high rates \n23  relative to census population data for the city: Latinx drivers represented 31% of the population \n24  and 43% of people stopped, while Black people represent 4.5% of the population and 7% of the \n25  people stopped by SJPD.9 \n26 \n27 \n \n28  9American Civil Liberties Union, Police and Community React to San Jose Traffic Stop Data (Dec. 18, 1999), \nhttps://www.aclu.org/press-releases/police-and-community-react-san-jose-traffic-stop-data.   \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         33 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 34 of 59\n \n \n \n149.  From 2013-2016, in an analysis of the 80,000 traffic and pedestrian stops, Black drivers \nwere 9 times more likely, and Latinx drivers 3.4 times more likely, than white drivers to be \n1 \nstopped by SJPD, and 2 times and 1.7 times, respectively, more likely to be searched. In \n2 \npedestrian stops, the disparities persisted for Latinx people.10  \n3 \n150.  The most recent FBI data, from 2018, reveals that despite Black people making up only \n4 \nthree percent of the San José population, they are three times more likely to be arrested by SJPD \n5  compared to White people11.  \n6  151.  In 2020, Racial Identity Profiling Act (“RIPA”) data demonstrated the SJPD still has \n7  racially discriminatory ticketing practices for infractions—Latinx people are 2.2 times and Black \n8  people are 6.6 times more likely to receive a citation than their White counterparts, more than 20 \nyears after community advocates raised the alarm over SJPD’s original stop data study.12 This \n9 \ndata confirms that SJPD has not adequately addressed its harmful practice of targeting people of \n10 \ncolor and that SJPD’s discriminatory policing persists. \n11 \n152.  In 2013, the San José Independent Police Auditor (IPA) recommended that the “Field \n12 \nTraining Officer (FTO) Handbook to include better instruction and guidance about how recruits \n13 \ns hould interact with people of color13.” While the SJPD revised their FTO Handbook in response \n14  to this recommendation, the IPA determined that they have “continuing concerns and found the \n15  revisions to be woefully inadequate14.” In 2019, the IPA again recommended that the SJPD \n16  evaluate its FTO program, and specifically categorized “Improper Behavior” as an area of \n17  concern15. In its analysis, the IPA wrote:  \n“…the FTO and a recruit stated that two detained Hispanic males were \n18 \ndirected to sit on the curb for their comfort and not to exert control. In \n19  another encounter, an FTO and recruit pulled over a Black bicyclist for \nriding without a reflective light at night. At the end of this encounter, the \n20  bicyclist asked why he was ordered to throw his bicycle on the ground. The \nFTO’s response included self-initiated references to Black Lives Matter \n21 \n22   \n10Michael R.

In 2020, a private SJPD Facebook group called “10-7ODSJ” was exposed as a platform \n4 \nfor white supremacist racism within the department. William Rockmiller, a retired SJPD officer, \n5 \nposted publicly about Black Lives Matter, describing its supporters as “racist idiots,” “un-\n6 \nAmerican” and “enemies” that the police “swore an oath against.”17 He condemned any of his \n7 \nfriends who support BLM and stated, “Fuck BLM.”18 Current CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \n8  Officer, Mark Pimental posted, “Black lives don’t really matter.”19 Rockmiller also posted about \n9  a Los Angeles Muslim woman, whose hijab, a head covering, was pulled off by a male cop. His \n10  post drew comments from current SJPD officers, including Pimental who said, “Hell, I would \n11  have pulled it over her face.”20 Retired officer Michael Nagel posted, “I say re-purpose the \nhijabs into nooses”, with a smile emoji.21 Nagel also posted a chilling image of a “Sharia Barbie” \n12 \n-- a woman wearing a hijab with a black eye and bruises.22 \n13 \n \n154.  Defendant EDGARDO GARCIA, then SAN JOSÉ’s Chief of Police, purported to be \n14 \n“shocked” and condemned these latest revelations about racism and Islamophobia in the SJPD,23 \n15 \nbut organizations such as Plaintiff NAACP- San Jose/Silicon Valley, journalists, advocates, and \n16 \ncitizens have issued complaints and reports of racist behaviors and culture in the SJPD for years \n17  or decades. \n18  155.  GARCIA said he would move to terminate officers who made racist comments or posts,24 \n19  but so far, no terminations have been reported.  \n20   \n16Id.  \n21  17Charlie Paulsen, Racism and Hate Behind the Blue Wall: Exposing Secret Law Enforcement Facebook Group, \nNoteworthy – The Journal Blog (Jun. 26, 2020), https://blog.usejournal.com/racism-and-hate-behind-the-blue-wall-\n22 \nexposing-secret-law-enforcement-facebook-groups-6cf23a596a98. \n18Id.  \n23 \n19Id. \n24  20Id.  \n21Id.  \n25  22Jason Green, San Jose police officers’ racist Facebook posts exposed by blogger, S.J.

In 2018, a Muslim SJPD officer of Lebanese-American heritage sued the CITY OF SAN \nJOSÉ, alleging years of discriminatory harassment from other officers based on his race, national \n1 \norigin, and/or religion since September 11, 2001.25 This officer alleged, inter alia, that fellow \n2 \nofficers suggested on multiple occasions that he was a member of ISIS or a terrorist, and that \n3 \nwhen he complained, his superiors in SJPD retaliated against him, for example with a \n4 \ndisciplinary writeup.”26 \n5  157.  Further, it appears that CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers were unnecessarily panicked \n6  prior to the May 29, 2020 demonstration in part due to information their department passed on to \n7  them that GARCIA and other high-ranking officers should have known to be unreliable. In the \n8  days leading up to the May 29 protest, the SJPD received briefings from the Northern California \nRegional Intelligence Center (NCRIC) which parroted unsubstantiated secondhand reports.27 In \n9 \nits After Action Report, the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ admitted that this NCRIC information \n10 \n“contextualize[d] the mindset of the officers in the days leading up to and throughout the civil \n11 \nunrest.”28 A 2012 Senate investigation of fusion centers, like NCRIC, determined that they \n12 \nprovided intel of “uneven quality — oftentimes shoddy, rarely timely, sometimes endangering \n13 \nc ivilians’ liberties and Privacy Act protections, occasionally taken from already-published \n14  sources, and more often than not unrelated to counterterrorism.”29 \n15  E. Defendants discriminated against demonstrators with disabilities by subjecting \n16  them to excessive force when they are unable to move due to their disability, failing \n17  to provide clear and consistent directions with an opportunity to comply, and failing \nto ensure that demonstrators have a safe route of egress from protests.  \n18 \n158.  Defendants routinely fail to provide reasonable accommodations for people with \n19 \ndisabilities to equally participate in constitutionally protected free speech during demonstrations. \n20 \nFurther, they fail to provide reasonable modifications to their orders such that a person with a \n21 \ndisability will have the same opportunity to comply and/or escape brutal force.  \n22 \n23   \n25Jason Green, ‘Racism problem’: Muslim SJPD officer suing city, department, Bay Area News Group (Sep. 24, \n24  2018), https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/09/24/muslim-sjpd-officer-sues-city-department-over-racism-problem/. \n26Id. \n25 \n27Jennifer Wadsworth, BlueLeaks Hack Suggests Bad Intel Fueled SJPD’s Violent Response to Recent Protests, San \n26  Jose Inside (Sept. 15, 2020), https://www.sanjoseinside.com/news/blueleaks-hack-suggests-bad-intel-fueled-sjpds-\nviolent-response-to-recent-protests/. \n27  28Garcia, supra, at 34.  \n29Permanent Subcommittee of Investigations, United States Senate, Federal Support for and Involvement in State \n28  and Local Fusion Centers 1 (Oct. 3, 2012), https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/10-3-\n2012%20PSI%20STAFF%20REPORT%20re%20FUSION%20CENTERS.2.pdf. \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         36 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 37 of 59\n \n \n \n159.  In a recent report, the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ was found to be the only major city within \nthe United States to govern without an Office of Disability Affairs and the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ \n1 \nPolice Department wholly fails to track any data regarding disability status and \n2 \naccommodations.30  \n3 \n160.  During each day of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations, Defendants failed to \n4 \ncommunicate orders to disperse, including instructions for doing so, warnings about imminent \n5  use of force, and declarations of unlawful assemblies. When Defendants have communicated \n6  orders, they were inaudible to most people in and near the demonstrations and lacked adequate \n7  instructions on where to go to avoid being subject to force. The insufficient orders placed \n8  Plaintiff CARTWRIGHT and SJPJC Director Michele Mashburn at great risk of harm due to \ntheir disabilities. \n9 \n161.  SJPJC Director Michele Mashburn lives with multiple disabilities and chronic health \n10 \nconditions that limit her daily life activities, and uses an electronic wheelchair for mobility. On \n11 \nMay 29, 2020, Ms. Mashburn left her downtown apartment to join the demonstrations using her \n12 \nelectronic wheelchair. Ms. Mashburn intended to join her friends participating in the \n13 \nd emonstration, but when she approached the corner of 4th and Santa Clara Streets she saw the \n14  heavy police presence and decided not to continue forward. The sheer number of police \n15  surrounding the crowd was dangerous for her, because there were no clear paths for her to \n16  maneuver her chair in the event of an emergency. Ms. Mashburn could hear indiscernible \n17  announcements from Defendants from where she observed. Being unable to decipher what the \npolice were saying also made Ms. Mashburn weary of going into the crowd toward her friends. \n18 \nInstead, she sat out and watched the demonstration from the sidelines rather than being able and \n19 \nfree to participate in the anti-brutality demonstrations.  \n20 \n162.  When Defendants began to deploy impact munitions, Ms. Mashburn saw impact \n21 \nmunitions fly into multiple directions around her, even on the sidelines. Ms. Mashburn could see \n22 \nthat Defendants were not exercising any restraint with who they were shooting and how, which \n23  made things especially dangerous for Ms. Mashburn in a wheelchair. She retreated home and \n24  seldom left her apartment in the days following to even go to work, because the police \n25  presence—given their extreme violence—was too dangerous with her disability. \n26  163.  SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT attended the May 29, 2020, demonstration as a legal observer \nto support the participants’ right to protest for racial justice.  \n27 \n28   \n30Tifanny Maciel, Juvenile Justice Involved Youth with Disabilities: An Epidemic of Misunderstanding, 1,8 (2020). \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         37 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 38 of 59\n \n \n \n164.  At E. Santa Clara and 7th Streets, Ms. Cartwright observed CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \nOfficers shooting impact munitions into the crowd of demonstrators, and officers throw two \n1 \npeople, including a young teen girl, to the ground and beat them with batons. Ms. Cartwright \n2 \nattempted to record to document and discourage this police use of force, but a CITY OF SAN \n3 \nJOSÉ Police Officer shoved her very forcefully with their hands. Ms. Cartwright told the officer \n4 \nwho shoved her that she was disabled with a brain injury and pled with them to stop using force \n5  against her, but they ignored her pleas and shoved her twice more, almost knocking her off her \n6  feet.  \n7  165.  Ms. Cartwright suffers from trigeminal neuralgia, a chronic pain condition that was being \n8  treated with neurostimulator devices implanted in her head which are powered by a battery \nimplanted in her chest. The area where the Officer struck Ms. Cartwright is where the battery is \n9 \nlocated, and she had to later have her medical team check to make sure the wire leading to the \n10 \nneurostimulators was intact. \n11 \n166.  Similarly, on May 30, 2020, Plaintiff SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT tried to stay back \n12 \nagainst a wall near City Hall on 4th Street while Defendants indiscriminately deployed chemical \n13 \nw  eapons into the crowd. She could not outrun the chemicals due to her disability. Defendants \n14  aimed at Ms. Cartwright as she attempted to make herself smaller and hide, and shot her four \n15  times in quick succession with impact munitions as if she were a sitting duck. The munitions \n16  struck her knee replacement and other parts of her body. \n17  167.  Ms. Cartwright endured significant trauma to her body. Her leg turned purple from thigh \nto ankle and swelled. As a result, Ms. Cartwright had to use crutches and undergo physical \n18 \ntherapy.  \n19 \nF. Defendants participate in a culture that glorifies and encourages violence and \n20 \ndiscrimination.  \n21 \n168.  During her detention, Plaintiff SWIFT saw a group of CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police \n22 \nOfficers take a picture to send to their boss in order to show how much fun they were having. \n23  She also overheard the officers making jokes about George Floyd’s death. CITY OF SAN JOSÉ \n24  Police Officers around the area she was detained did not wear masks, despite the fact that they \n25  were engaging with the public during a pandemic.  \n26  169.  Defendant JARED YUEN was captured on video shouting “Let’s get this motherfucker” \nand “Shut up, bitch” to a young woman who asked him a question. Yuen appeared visibly \n27 \nexcited and eager to shoot demonstrators. When a protestor said “Fuck you”, Yuen could be seen \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         38 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 39 of 59\n \n \n \non the video to rush forward and shoot impact munitions out of anger, and not because the use of \nforce was necessary or reasonable. However, in response to widespread outcry over YUEN’s \n1 \nbehavior, defendant Chief GARCIA stated publicly, inter alia, “He’s a good kid and a good \n2 \ncop.”31 \n3 \nG. CITY OF SAN JOSÉ officials made a number of false and misleading \n4 \nstatements to the public and media about the May 29 – June 7, 2020, \n5  demonstrations and the actions of CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers.  \n6  170.  For example, the After Action Report the CITY released emphasizes that SJPD had \n7  received reports of violence at other demonstrations around the country in a tone that is clearly \n8  exaggerated. One demonstrably false statement in the Report is the claim that SJPD received \nbulletins “in the days leading up to May 29th, 2020”, which stated that a Federal Security Officer \n9 \nat the Federal Building in Oakland was murdered during a protest and implies that this was \n10 \nrelated to the George Floyd protests.32 (The federal security officer was killed on the evening of \n11 \nMay 29, not prior to May 29, so SJPD could not have received such reports; moreover, federal \n12 \nauthorities have acknowledged that the crime was committed by an individual linked to the \n13 \n“ Boogaloo Boys” far-right white supremacist movement, and was not related to the George \n14  Floyd protests.)33 \n15  171.  The CITY released only three selected, edited excerpts from the SJPD body camera \n16  footage to the public, rather than releasing all of the body camera footage. In particular, the \n17  CITY withheld the body camera footage of the most serious excessive force incidents.  \n172.  The After Action Report also contains a highly misleading summary of the injuries \n18 \nsustained by protesters.34  This summary is based only on the few protester injuries that the \n19 \npolice documented in their reports, plus one additional high-profile injury that was reported in \n20 \nthe media. Since CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers failed to summon medical aid for any of \n21 \nthe plaintiffs herein, for example, none of their injuries are included in these numbers. In fact, the \n22 \nreport lists the number of injuries to protesters on May 29 as only nine, but the report also states \n23  that Special Operations officers, alone, expended approximately 246 40mm foam baton rounds, \n24   \n31Robert Salonga, Let’s get this motherf—ker’: San Jose officer benched after viral protest comments, The Mercury \n25 \nNews, May 31, 2020, https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/05/31/lets-get-this-motherf-ker-san-jose-officers-viral-\nprotest-comments-draw-wide-condemnation/. \n26 \n32Garcia, supra, at 34. \n27  33Maria Dinzeo, Two Charged in Murder of Oakland Federal Officer During Protests, Courthouse News Service \n(Jun. 16, 2020), https://www.courthousenews.com/two-charged-in-murder-of-oakland-federal-officer-during-\n28  protests/. \n34Garcia, supra, at 119-121. \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         39 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 40 of 59\n \n \n \n200 OC/pepper spray rounds, 100 37mm foam baton rounds, 2 beanbag rounds, 30 stinger \ngrenades, 13 flashbangs, and 45 baton strikes on May 29 alone.35 These facts show that far more \n1 \nthan nine people, and far more than the thirteen named individual plaintiffs herein, were injured.  \n2 \n173.  While GARCIA accused rioters of causing “millions of dollars” in property damage, \n3 \nprivate business reported about $160,000 in vandalism and theft, and the CITY estimated only \n4 \n$120,000 in damages.36 The largest cost, according to the CITY’s damage estimates from May \n5  29 to June 13, was the amount the CITY paid to deploy 816 police, seven firefighters, and four \n6  non-sworn employees.37 \n7  174.  Defendants’ acts were willful, wanton, malicious, and oppressive, and done with \n8  conscious disregard and deliberate indifference for plaintiff’s rights and safety, justifying an \naward of punitive damages.  \n9 \n175.  As a direct and proximate result of the conduct of defendants described herein, plaintiffs \n10 \nhave been denied their constitutional, statutory and legal rights as stated below, and have \n11 \nsuffered general and special damages, including but not limited to, pain, suffering, humiliation, \n12 \nemotional distress, fear, anxiety, disabilities, medical and related expenses, lost wages, damage \n13 \nt o career, and other damages in amounts according to proof.  \n14  176.   Plaintiffs have incurred, and will continue to incur, attorneys’ fees and costs in amounts \n15  to be determined according to proof. \n16  VI. MONELL AND SUPERVISORY LIABILITY ALLEGATIONS \n17  177.  The constitutional violations alleged herein were the proximate result of decisions, \norders, acts, and omissions of the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ’s authorized policymakers including but \n18 \nnot limited to defendants LICCARDO, GARCIA, KNOPF and SYKES.  \n19 \n178.  GARCIA, SYKES, and KNOPF caused the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers’ \n20 \nconstitutional violations complained of herein by failing to provide adequate policies, training, \n21 \nsupervision, and command of their officers assigned to the May 29- June 7, 2020, \n22 \ndemonstrations to stop the officers from engaging in racial and religious profiling and \n23  harassment, use of excessive force, and deprivation of First Amendment rights. This included, \n24  but is not limited to, sending inadequately trained commanders and officers to the May 29 - June \n25  7, 2020, demonstrations. The CITY has admitted in its After Action Report approved by \n26 \n \n27 \n35 Id. at 102-108 \n28  36Wadsworth, supra. \n37 Id.  \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         40 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 41 of 59\n \n \n \ndefendant Police Chief GARCIA and defendant City Manager SYKES that the CITY OF SAN \nJOSÉ Police Officers who responded to the demonstrations were inadequately trained and \n1 \nsupervised, and that the SJPD failed to call in more experienced agencies through mutual aid. \n2 \nMuch of the Department’s personnel lack experience and tenure in their rank. . . . \n3  In recent years, the Department has engaged in rapid hiring which dilutes the \nexperience pool. Most of the Department’s officers have never experienced civil \n4 \nunrest of this type. Crowd control training has been minimal and infrequent as \n5  mass training requires time away from already depleted patrol staffing. In some \ninstances, commanders lacked the sufficient training and experience in the \n6  implementation of the [Incident Command System] as it related to crowd control. \n38 \n7 \n. . . .  \n8  There were no patrol commanders in the field for the first two days, resulting in a \nlack of continuity in communicating mission objectives and tactical plans.39  \n9  . . . . \n \n10 \nSpecial Operations commanders expressed concern that without patrol \n11  commanders in the field, their span of control was unmanageable…. \n…[A]t times, [Mobile Field Force] sergeants began making independent \n12  decisions about where to move the crowd without unity in command and full \nunderstanding of the mission. 40  \n13 \n  . . . .  \n14   \nWhile some command staff have received training in crowd control, few of those \n15  trained were involved on the ground during the [May-June 2020 \ndemonstrations].41 \n16 \n \n17  179.  Defendant GARCIA and the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Department changed its \npolicies days before the May 29, 2020, demonstration to allow use of additional chemical agent \n18 \ndevices and allow use of impact munitions that it had previously prohibited in crowd control \n19 \nsituations and which it acknowledges can cause serious injury or death.42 These and other \n20 \nimpact munitions are highly likely to cause unjustified injuries when used in crowds, but \n21 \nGARCIA and other CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police supervisors failed to adequately train and \n22 \nsupervise the officers supplied with the dangerous munitions.  \n23  180.  GARCIA, SYKES, and KNOPF caused the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers’ \n24  constitutional violations complained of herein by equipping inadequately trained officers with \n25 \n \n26  38Garcia, supra, at 4. \n39Id. at 5. \n27 \n40Id. at 47. \n28  41Id. at 32. \n42Id. at 167-168, 170-172. \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         41 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 42 of 59\n \n \n \nhighly dangerous impact munitions, explosive grenades and chemical weapons; approving the \nuse of impact munitions, explosive grenades and chemical weapons at the demonstrations, which \n1 \nresulted in such weapons being used in an unconstitutional, indiscriminate, racially \n2 \ndiscriminatory, unnecessary, and excessive manner; failing to have adequate policies and \n3 \npractices for oversight of the use of such dangerous weapons; and by failing to train or have an \n4 \nexplicit policy requiring CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers to intervene in and report \n5  excessive force by other officers when they are present and observe it.  \n6  181.   Plaintiffs further allege that the constitutional violations alleged herein were the \n7  proximate result of a repeated course of conduct by members of the SJPD tantamount to a \n8  custom, policy, pattern or repeated practice of condoning, ratifying and/or tacitly encouraging \nthe abuse of police authority, and disregard for the constitutional rights of citizens, including the \n9 \nrights of the plaintiffs and class members. \n10 \n182.   Plaintiffs are further informed and believe and thereon allege that the constitutional \n11 \nviolations alleged herein were the proximate result of a custom, policy, pattern or practice of \n12 \ndeliberate indifference by defendant CITY OF SAN JOSÉ to the repeated violations of the \n13 \nc onstitutional rights of citizens by defendant CITY OF SAN JOSÉ’s Police Officers, which have \n14  included, but are not limited to, the repeated use of excessive force, racial and religious bias and \n15  profiling, and the repeated failure to properly and/or adequately train, supervise and/or discipline \n16  officers with respect to the use of excessive force, constitutional limitations on the use of force, \n17  and racial and religious bias and profiling; the repeated failure by CITY OF SAN JOSÉ’s high \nranking officials, police department managers and/or supervisors to hold officers accountable for \n18 \nviolating the rights of citizens; and/or other customs, policies and/or practices subject to \n19 \ncontinuing discovery. \n20 \n183.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that defendants GARCIA, DWYER, SYKES, \n21 \nKNOPF, LAGORIO, MATCHETT, LYNCH, LOPEZ, and TASSIO, and/or each of them, \n22 \ncaused the violation of the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights as a result of their supervisory \n23  malfeasance and/or deliberate indifference to the need for more or different training, supervision \n24  and/or discipline of the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police personnel assigned to the subject incident, \n25  including, but not limited to, defendants YUEN, CURRY, ADGAR, SIMONINI, ORABUENA, \n26  NGUYEN, MORAN, GAONA, SITU, GRODIN, AND AYALA, WEBER, and other officers, and \neach of them, to prevent the foreseeable violation of plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, as further \n27 \ndiscussed above. \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         42 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 43 of 59\n \n \n \nVII. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n184.  Class representative plaintiffs JOSEPH CAÑAS, LESLIE VASQUEZ, PETER ALLEN, \n1 \nSHAUNN CARTWRIGHT, YESSICA RILES, JOSÉ GUSTAVO FLORES RODRIGUEZ, and \n2 \nCINDY CUELLAR seek class certification pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a), Fed.R.Civ.P. \n3 \n23(b)(2), and Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3) to pursue claims for damages, injunctive, and declaratory \n4 \nrelief on behalf of themselves and all persons similarly situated.   \n5  A. CLASS DEFINITION – 23(B)(2) (INJUNCTIVE RELIEF CLASS)  \n6  185.  The injunctive relief class is defined as all persons who have in the past participated, \n7  presently are participating, or may in the future participate in, or be present at, demonstrations \n8  within the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ in the exercise of their rights of free speech, assembly, \nassociation, petition, and of the press, in general, and particularly as it relates to protesting police \n9 \nviolence and discrimination against people of color.  \n10 \nB.  CLASS DEFINITION – 23(B)(3) (DAMAGES CLASS)  \n11 \n186.  One or more of the named plaintiffs (who are indicated for each class) bring this action \n12 \nindividually and on behalf of a proposed class of all other persons similarly situated pursuant to \n13 \nF  ed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3). The damages class is defined as: all persons \n14  present at protests regarding the killing of George Floyd in the City of San Jose on May 29, \n15  2020, or May 30, 2020, who were struck by either Projectile Impact Weapons (including 37mm \n16  and 40mm projectiles and bean-bag shotguns), batons, or otherwise physically struck by a San \n17  Jose Police Department officer.  The Class Representatives for this class are JOSEPH CAÑAS; \nLESLIE VASQUEZ; PETER ALLEN; SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT; YESSICA RILES; JOSÉ \n18 \nGUSTAVO FLORES RODRIGUEZ; and CINDY CUELLAR. \n19 \nC. RULE 23 PREREQUISITES \n20 \ni.  Numerosity \n21 \n187.  This case satisfies the prerequisites of a Rule 23 class action. The class is so numerous \n22 \nthat joinder of all members is impracticable. The injunctive relief class consists of hundreds or \n23  even thousands of people. The damages class consists of 100 or more people. Plaintiffs do not \n24  know the identities of all of the class members.  \n25  ii.   Questions of Law or Fact Prevail \n26  188.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class, in that the named plaintiffs \nclaim that defendants’ unlawful indiscriminate use of force and threats of force at the San José \n27 \ndemonstrations described herein, were based on San José Police Department policies and orders \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         43 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 44 of 59\n \n \n \nthat were unlawful and chilled their First Amendment rights, including but not limited to the \nindiscriminate and unwarranted use of riot weapons including impact munitions, batons, and \n1 \nphysical violence by officers with their strikes, blows or kicks against protestors who did not \n2 \npose a threat to officers.  \n3 \n189.  The questions of law and/or fact which predominate over any question affecting only \n4 \nindividual members include, but are not limited to: \n5  -  Whether defendants improperly declared an unlawful assembly or assemblies, \n6  without justification and without adequate sound amplification and without providing \n7  directions, means, and opportunity to disperse before taking violent, injurious and \n8  potentially deadly police action; \n-  Whether defendants used excessive force against the crowd, without regard to \n9 \nwhether the individuals against whom force was used were engaged in conduct \n10 \njustifying such force;  \n11 \n-  Whether defendants routinely used impact munitions and other force against \n12 \ndemonstrators and observers even though those people were not engaging in conduct \n13 \n  justifying such force; \n14  -  Whether the officers who used force at the events in question were properly trained in \n15  use of force standards and the proper use of the weapons they were given;  \n16  -  Whether defendants' motivation for the unlawful assembly declarations, curfew, use \n17  of force and arrests was to deprive participants of their First Amendment rights;  \n-  Whether defendants engaged in racial, content and viewpoint-discrimination;  \n18 \n-  Whether the defendants failed to accommodate disabled demonstrators by not \n19 \nproviding them adequate opportunity and ability to avoid being subjected to use of \n20 \nforce and arrest;  \n21 \n-  Whether these actions violated the class members’ First, Fourth, and Fourteenth \n22 \namendment rights and their California analogues; \n23  -  Whether these actions violated the Americans with Disabilities Act; \n24  -  Did some or all of the conduct described above constitute a policy or custom of \n25  defendant CITY OF SAN JOSÉ; \n26  -  Whether any individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on the federal \nclaims; \n27 \n-  Whether any of the conduct alleged herein violated Cal. Civil Code, § 52.1; \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         44 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 45 of 59\n \n \n \n-  Whether general class wide damages are available to the Damages Class; and \n-  Whether statutory damages under § 52.1 are available to the Damages Class.  \n1 \n190.  By declaring unlawful assemblies, ordering officers to use highly dangerous weapons on \n2 \nthe crowd at the demonstrations, failing to adequate adequately train the officers given impact \n3 \nmunitions and other dangerous weapons at the demonstrations in the use of those weapons, \n4 \nfailing to adequately respond to accusations of racism and Islamophobia within the SJPD and \n5  failing to adequately discipline and train officers accused of excessive force, racist and \n6  Islamophobic misconduct, allowing a culture of violence, racism and Islamophobia to exist \n7  within the SJPD, and failing to adopt policies prohibiting race, religion, national origin, and \n8  viewpoint discrimination and use of excessive force. As further described above, defendants \nhave acted on grounds generally applicable to the class, so that injunctive and declaratory relief \n9 \nis appropriate respecting the class as a whole.  \n10 \n191.  The questions of law and fact common to the classes, which are outlined above, \n11 \npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members.  \n12 \niii.  Typicality \n13 \n1 92.  The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class in that the named \n14  plaintiffs and class members claim that their First Amendment rights have been chilled by the \n15  same misconduct of defendants’ aggressive and unwarranted use of force, including batons, \n16  impact munitions, chemical agents, and grenades. Plaintiffs seek redress for the past violations of \n17  their rights and protection to bar the repeat of those violations in the future.  \n193.  Thus, the named plaintiffs have the same interests and have suffered the same type of \n18 \ndamages as the class members. The class representative plaintiffs’ claims are based upon the \n19 \nsame or similar legal theories as the claims of the class members of each class. Each class \n20 \nmember suffered actual damages as a result of being subjected to one or more of the violations \n21 \nenumerated above. The actual injuries suffered by the named plaintiffs are similar in type to the \n22 \nactual damages suffered by each class member although the severity of those injuries may vary \n23  among class members. \n24  194.  The class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class \n25  because they were subject to the unlawful law enforcement conduct complained of herein, and \n26  have no interests antagonistic to the class.  \niv.  Adequate Representation \n27 \n195.  The class representatives will fairly and adequately represent the common class interest. \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         45 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 46 of 59\n \n \n \nThe class representatives have a strong interest in achieving the relief requested in this \nComplaint, they have no conflicts with members of the plaintiff class, and they will fairly and \n1 \nadequately protect the interests of the class.  \n2 \n196.  The class representatives are represented by counsel who are well-experienced in federal \n3 \ncivil rights class action litigation and are familiar with the issues in this case. \n4 \n197.  Counsel for the class representatives know of no conflicts among or between members of \n5  the class, the named plaintiffs, or the attorneys in this action.  \n6  v. Maintenance and Superiority \n7  198.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(1)(A), the prosecution of separate actions by \n8  individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent or incompatible standards of \nconduct for the defendants, thereby making a class action the superior method of adjudicating the \n9 \ncontroversy.  \n10 \n199.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of separate actions by \n11 \nindividual members of the classes would create a risk of adjudications with respect to individual \n12 \nmembers of the class which would, as a practical matter, substantially impair or impede the \n13 \ni nterests of the other members of the class to protect their interests.  \n14  200.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(2), defendants have acted on grounds \n15  generally applicable to the class.  \n16  201.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(3), the questions of law or fact common to \n17  the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and \nthis class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of \n18 \nthe controversy between the parties. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that \n19 \nthe interests of class members in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is \n20 \nlow in that most class members would be unable to individually prosecute any action at all. \n21 \nPlaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that the amounts at stake for individuals \n22 \nare such that separate suits would be impracticable in that most members of the class will not be \n23  able to find counsel to represent them. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, \n24  that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims arise in the \n25  same location, i.e., the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ. It will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the \n26  common questions of law and fact in one forum rather than in multiple courts.  \n202.  Plaintiffs do not know the identities of most class members. Plaintiffs are informed and \n27 \nbelieve, and thereon allege, that the identities of the arrest class members are ascertainable from \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         46 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 47 of 59\n \n \n \nSJPD records. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that a significant number \nof direct force class members may be reached by the use of outreach efforts by organizations that \n1 \nparticipated in organizing the affected protests.  \n2 \n203.  Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that will be encountered in the management of this \n3 \nlitigation that would preclude its maintenance as a class action. Liability can be determined on a \n4 \nclass-wide basis. Defendants have little or no records or evidence of any kind justifying any use \n5  of force against individual demonstrators, and defendants' only justifications for any use of force \n6  against peaceful participants is based on facts which apply to all the peaceful participants \n7  equally.  \n8  204.  General damages can also be determined through use of subclasses. \n205.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(3), class members must be furnished with \n9 \nthe best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all members \n10 \nwho can be identified through reasonable effort. Plaintiffs contemplate that individual notice be \n11 \ngiven to class members at last known address by first class mail, email, cell phone outreach, \n12 \nsocial media, and efforts of organizations that organized the protests. Plaintiffs contemplate that \n13 \nt he notice inform class members of the following regarding their damages claims: \n14  a.  The pendency of the class action, and the issues common to the class; \n15  b.  The nature of the action; \n16  c.  Their right to ‘opt out’ of the action within a given time, in which event they will \n17  not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action; \nd.  Their right, if they do not ‘opt out,’ to be represented by their own counsel and \n18 \nenter an appearance in the case; otherwise, they will be represented by the named \n19 \nplaintiffs and their counsel; and \n20 \ne.  Their right, if they do not ‘opt out,’ to share in any recovery in favor of the class, \n21 \nand conversely to be bound by any judgment on the common issues, adverse to \n22 \nthe class. \n23       \n24  VIII.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate herein by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \nComplaint. \n3 \n207.  The Defendants engaged in repeated, widespread violations of law, as outlined above, \n4 \nover the course of at least several nights, using excessive force against hundreds if not thousands \n5 \nof protestors in retaliation for their First Amendment activity; declaring unlawful assemblies \n6 \nwithout adequate sound amplification and without providing adequate notice, means and \n7 \nopportunity to disperse before taking aggressive police action including the use of highly \n8  dangerous PIW, chemical weapons and explosive grenades; hitting large numbers of protestors \n9  with batons, hands, grenades and/or PIW and using chemical weapons on them all with \n10  unreasonable and excessive force; failing to provide medical aid or decontamination to persons \n11  defendants shot and/or teargassed; and targeting perceived people of color for these civil rights \nviolations. \n12 \n208.  The CITY, through SYKES, GARCIA, KNOPF and the SJPD, has failed to train its \n13 \n \nofficers in the constitutional responses to demonstrations as revealed by the above allegations. \n14 \n209.   Without intervention by this Court, the plaintiffs, including the NAACP and SJPJC and \n15 \nthe Injunctive Relief class members, who have participated, observed or documented protest \n16 \nactivities and wish to do so in the future, particularly related to police violence and racial justice, \n17  are at risk of having their rights violated in the future due to the defendants’ demonstrated pattern \n18  of constitutional violations. The plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to protect the future \n19  lawful exercise of their constitutional rights, and, without action by this court, will suffer \n20  irreparable injury, thereby entitling them to injunctive and declaratory relief. \n210.  The Defendants have acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the \n21 \nputative Injunctive Relief Class. Injunctive and declaratory relief for the class as a whole is \n22 \nappropriate. \n23 \n211.  Defendants’ policies, practices, customs, conduct and acts alleged herein have resulted \n24 \nand will continue to result in irreparable injury to the plaintiffs, including but not limited to \n25 \nviolations of their constitutional and statutory rights. Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate or \n26  complete remedy at law to address the wrongs described herein. Plaintiffs intend in the future to \n27  exercise their constitutional rights of freedom of speech and association by engaging in \n28  demonstrations, observation and documentation of demonstrations and police actions, and other \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         48 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 49 of 59\n \n \n \nexpressive activities in the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ. Defendants’ conduct described herein has \ncreated fear, anxiety and uncertainty among plaintiffs with respect to their exercise now and in \n1 \nthe future of these constitutional rights. \n2 \n212.  Specifically, plaintiffs are concerned that if they participate in, observe or document \n3 \nprotest activities in the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ they will again be subjected to unreasonable and \n4 \nexcessive force by CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers. \n5  213.  Plaintiffs are concerned that, when engaged in protest activities, Defendants will not \n6  provide adequate means and opportunity to disperse; and will again employ indiscriminate, \n7  racially discriminatory, unreasonable or excessive force, injuring and terrifying protestors. \n8  214.  Plaintiffs therefore seek injunctive relief from this court to ensure that plaintiffs and \npersons similarly situated will not suffer violations of their rights from defendants’ illegal and \n9 \nunconstitutional policies, customs, and practices described herein. \n10 \nCOUNT TWO – DECLARATORY RELIEF \n11 \nAll Plaintiffs (NAACP, SJPJC, Acosta, Naemeh, Swift, Maldonado, Canas, Vasquez, Flores \n12  Rodriguez, Allen, Riles, Cartwright and Cuellar) against Defendants City of San Jose, \nSykes, Garcia & Knopf \n13 \n  \n14  215.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \n15  Complaint. \n16  216.  An actual controversy exists between plaintiffs and defendants in that plaintiffs contend \n17  that the policies, practices and conduct of defendants alleged herein are unlawful and \nunconstitutional, whereas plaintiffs are informed and believe that defendants contend that said \n18 \npolicies, practices and conduct are lawful and constitutional. Plaintiffs therefore seek a \n19 \ndeclaration of rights with respect to this controversy pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202. \n20 \n \n21  COUNT THREE – 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nVIOLATION OF FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS \n22 \n \n23  All Plaintiffs (NAACP, SJPJC, Acosta, Naemeh, Swift, Maldonado, Canas, Vasquez, Flores \nRodriguez, Allen, Riles, Cartwright and Cuellar) against All Defendants (City of San Jose, \n24  Sykes, Garcia, Knopf, Dwyer; Matchett; Lagorio; Lopez; Tassio; Yuen; Curry; Adgar; \nLynch; Simonini; Orabuena; Nguyen; Moran; Gaona; Situ; Grodin; Ayala, and Weber) \n25 \n \n26  217.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \nComplaint. \n27 \n218.

The acts and/or omissions of the \n1 \ndefendants, and each of them, individually and/or while acting in concert with one another, \n2 \nchilled the plaintiffs’ rights to freedom of speech, expression and association, under the First \n3 \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. \n4 \n219.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, the individual plaintiffs, and Damages \n5  Class members suffered damages as alleged above. \n6  220.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, and the potential that such conduct will \n7  recur, all of the plaintiffs including Plaintiffs NAACP, SJPJC, and the Injunctive Relief Class are \n8  entitled to relief from the potential that such violations will recur.  \n221.  Wherefore, the plaintiffs pray for relief as hereinafter set forth. \n9 \nCOUNT FOUR - 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n10 \nEXCESSIVE FORCE – U.S. Const., 4th and 14th Amds. \n11   \nAll Plaintiffs against The City, Garcia, Knopf, Dwyer, Matchett and Tassio \n12  Acosta also against Yuen, Nguyen, Grodin, Lopez, Lynch \nNaemeh also against Orabuena, Weber, Situ, and Lopez \n13 \nS  wift also against Curry, Silva, Ayala \n14  Cañas also against Yuen and Lopez \nVasquez also against Yuen, Simonini, And Lopez \n15  Allen also against Yuen and Lopez \nRiles also against Simonini  \n16 \nFlores Rodriguez also against Gaona and Grodin \n17  Cuellar also against Simonini, Adgar, Nguyen, Grodin, Moran and Lynch \nMaldonado also against Lagorio \n18   \n \n19 \n222.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \n20  Complaint. \n21  223.  The acts and/or omissions of the defendants, and each of them, individually and/or while \n22  acting in concert with one another, violated plaintiffs’ rights to be free from excessive force, \n23  under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n224.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, all of the individual plaintiffs and the Direct \n24 \nForce Damages Class members suffered damages as alleged above. \n25 \n225.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, and the potential that such conduct will \n26 \nrecur, all of the plaintiffs including Plaintiffs NAACP, SJPJC, and the Injunctive Relief Class are \n27 \nentitled to relief from the potential that such violations will recur.   \n28 \n226.  Wherefore, the plaintiffs pray for relief as hereinafter set forth. \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         50 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 51 of 59\n \n \n \nCOUNT FIVE – 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nFAILURE TO INTERVENE \n1   \nAll Plaintiffs (NAACP, SJPJC, Acosta, Naemeh, Swift, Maldonado, Canas, Vasquez, Flores \n2  Rodriguez, Allen, Riles, Cartwright and Cuellar) against All Defendants (City of San Jose, \nSykes, Garcia, Knopf, Dwyer; Matchett; Lagorio; Lopez; Tassio; Yuen; Curry; Adgar; \n3 \nLynch; Simonini; Orabuena; Nguyen; Moran; Gaona; Situ; Grodin; Ayala, and Weber) \n4   \n227.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \n5 \nComplaint. \n6 \n228.  During the events described above, the Defendants stood by without intervening to \n7 \nprevent the violations of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights heretofore alleged, even though the \n8  violations occurred in plain view of numerous CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers and all of \n9  the Police Defendants had the opportunity and duty to do so. \n10  229.  Defendants’ failure to intervene was caused in part by the CITY OF SAN JOSÉ’s, \n11  SYKES, GARCIA and KNOPF’s failure to provide adequate policies and training requiring \nCITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers to intervene in and report excessive force by other officers \n12 \nwhen they are present and observe it. \n13 \n \n230.  The misconduct described in this Count was objectively unreasonable and was \n14 \nundertaken intentionally, with malice and knowing disregard for Plaintiffs’ clearly established \n15 \nconstitutional rights. \n16 \n231.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, all of the individual plaintiffs and damages \n17  class members suffered damages as alleged above. \n18  232.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful conduct, and the potential that such conduct will \n19  recur, all of the plaintiffs including Plaintiffs NAACP, SJPJC, and the Injunctive Relief Class are \n20  entitled to relief from the potential that such violations will recur.  \n233.  Wherefore, the plaintiffs pray for relief as hereinafter set forth.  \n21 \n \n22 \n \n23  COUNT SEVEN – 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq. \nVIOLATION OF TITLE II OF THE A.D.A. \n24   \nPlaintiff Cartwright Against Defendant City of San Jose \n25 \n \n26  234.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \nComplaint. \n27 \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         51 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 52 of 59\n \n \n \n235.  The Americans with Disabilities Act and its implementing regulations provide that “no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from \n1 \nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, \n2 \nor be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 28 C.F.R. § 35.149. \n3 \nTitle II’s requirements extend to “anything a public entity does,” including arrests and other law \n4 \nenforcement interactions. 8 C.F.R. § 35, app. B. Despite these requirements, Defendants violated \n5  the ADA and its implementing regulations in multiple ways. \n6  236.  Defendants have an affirmative obligation to make benefits, services, and programs \n7  accessible to people with disabilities. § 35.150. “The general regulatory obligation to modify \n8  policies, practices, or procedures requires law enforcement to make changes in policies that \nresult in discriminatory arrests or abuse of individuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, app. B. \n9 \nDefendants, however, have failed to make reasonable modifications that will make law \n10 \nenforcement’s actions equally accessible to people with disabilities; indeed, their responses to \n11 \nprotests actively deny people with disabilities their rights at protests. \n12 \n237.  Title II protects people with disabilities against facially neutral policies that burden \n13 \np eople with disabilities more than others, by requiring that the public entity provide reasonable \n14  modifications to avoid the discrimination unless the public entity can demonstrate that such \n15  modifications would result in a fundamental alteration of the program. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7); \n16  Crowder v. Kitagaw, 81 F. 3d 1480 (9th Cir. 1996). \n17  238.   Defendants’ use of teargas, pepper balls, and other chemical irritants poses a significant \nrisk of harm or death for people with respiratory and inflammatory conditions. \n18 \n239.  The lack of clear egress routes for dispersal, and barriers to egress erected by Defendants, \n19 \nviolate the rights of people with disabilities who are forced to risk stampedes and trampling from \n20 \nother protesters, law enforcement force, and other grievous harm. \n21 \n240.  The lack of clear and consistent directions likewise puts Plaintiffs, including those with \n22 \nmobility impairments, at significant risk of harm, arrest, and violence. \n23  241.  Defendants subjected Plaintiff SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT to use of force because they \n24  mistook Plaintiff’s inaction, delayed action, or slowed action in response to orders to disperse \n25  and other commands as a refusal to comply.  \n26  242.  Further, Defendants’ crowd management directives and other measures constitute \nprograms and/or activities under the ADA. By failing to establish crowd management measures \n27 \nthat permit protesters with disabilities an opportunity to avoid harm by police, Defendants have \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         52 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 53 of 59\n \n \n \ndenied those people with disabilities meaningful access to their crowd management \nprogram/activity. \n1 \n243.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C § 12133, Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief \n2 \nas well as damages and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. \n3 \n \n4 \nCOUNT EIGHT – 29 U.S.C. §§ 794 et seq. \n5  VIOLATION OF SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT \n \n6  Plaintiff Cartwright Against Defendant City of San Jose \n \n7 \n244.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \n8  Complaint. \n9  245.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”) and its implementing regulations \n10  provide that “[N]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of \n11  her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial \n12 \nassistance . . .” 29 U.S.C. § 794. Defendants violate Section 504 in multiple ways. A “program or \n13 \n \nactivity” means “all of the operations of a department, agency, special purpose district, or other \n14 \ninstrumentality of a State or of a local government, or the entity of such State or local \n15 \ngovernment that distributes such assistance and each such department or agency (and each other \n16 \nState or local government entity) to which the assistance is extended, in the case of assistance to \n17  a State or local government.” 29 U.S.C. 794(b)(1)(A), (B).  \n18  246.  Section 504 regulations prohibit discrimination by a recipient of federal funds by denying \n19  a qualified person with a disability the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, \n20  benefit, or service. 34 C.F.R. § 104.4(1)(i). \n247.  Section 504 regulations prohibit discrimination by a recipient of federal funds by \n21 \naffording a qualified person with a disability an opportunity to participate in and benefit from the \n22 \naid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others. 34 C.F.R. § 104.4.(1)(ii). \n23 \n248.  Section 504 regulations prohibit discrimination by a recipient of federal funds by \n24 \naffording a qualified person with a disability an opportunity to participate in and benefit from the \n25 \naid, benefit, or service that is not as effective as that provided others. 34 C.F.R. § 104.4.(1)(iii). \n26  249.  Section 504 regulations prohibit discrimination by a recipient of federal funds by \n27  “providing significant assistance to an agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         53 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 54 of 59\n \n \n \nbasis of [disability] in providing any aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the recipients’ \nprogram or activity.” 34 C.F.R. § 104.4(1)(v). \n1 \n250.  Section 504 regulations prohibit discrimination by a recipient of federal funds by utilizing \n2 \n“criteria or methods of administration that have the effect of subjecting qualified [persons with \n3 \ndisabilities] to discrimination on the basis of [disability].” 34 C.F.R. § 104.4(4). \n4 \n251.  Section 504 regulations require that recipients of federal financial assistance “shall take \n5  appropriate steps to ensure that communications with their . . . beneficiaries are available to \n6  persons with impaired vision and hearing.” 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(e). \n7  252.  Plaintiffs are otherwise qualified to participate in the services, programs, or activities that \n8  are provided to individuals by Defendants. 29 U.S.C. § 794(b).  \n253.  Defendant receives federal financial assistance. \n9 \n254.  Through the acts and omissions described above, Defendant and its agents and employees \n10 \nhave and continue to violate the Rehabilitation Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder \n11 \nby excluding Plaintiffs from participation in, denying Plaintiffs the benefits of, and subjecting \n12 \nPlaintiffs based solely by reason of their disability to, discrimination in Defendants’ services and \n13 \na ctivities in managing and regulating protests in San Jose. \n14  255.  Defendants’ use of teargas, pepper balls, and other chemical irritants poses a significant \n15  risk of harm or death for people with respiratory and inflammatory conditions. \n16  256.  The lack of clear egress routes for dispersal, and barriers to egress erected by Defendants, \n17  violate the rights of people with disabilities who are forced to risk stampedes and trampling from \nother protesters, law enforcement force, and other grievous harm. \n18 \n257.  The lack of clear and consistent directions likewise puts Plaintiffs, including those with \n19 \nmobility impairments, at significant risk of harm, arrest, and violence. \n20 \n258.  Defendants subjected Plaintiff SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT to use of force because they \n21 \nmistook Plaintiff’s inaction, delayed action, or slowed action in response to orders to disperse \n22 \nand other commands as a refusal to comply.  \n23  259.  Further, Defendants’ crowd management directives and other measures constitute \n24  programs and/or activities under the Rehabilitation Act. By failing to establish crowd \n25  management measures that permit protesters with disabilities an opportunity to avoid harm by \n26  police, Defendants have denied those people with disabilities meaningful access to their crowd \nmanagement program/activity. \n27 \n28 \n \nCASE NO. 4:21-CV-01705 PJH   FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT         54 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-01705-PJH   Document 108   Filed 02/27/23   Page 55 of 59\n \n \n \n260.  As set forth above, Defendants have failed to satisfy their affirmative obligation to \nprovide reasonable modifications and auxiliary aids and services that provide equal access, with \n1 \nor without a specific request from a person with a disability.  \n2 \n261.  Defendants' failure to provide reasonable modifications was with deliberate indifference \n3 \nand reckless disregard to the rights of Plaintiffs. \n4 \n262.  Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief \n5  as well as damages and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.  \n6   \n7  COUNT NINE – Cal. Civ.
