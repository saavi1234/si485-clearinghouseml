On April 5, 2021, a Black resident of the City of Rochester and community organizer who was subjected to excessive force during the protests in September 2020, filed this putative class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York. The plaintiff class consists of Black and White residents of the City of Rochester and the Town of Irondequoit subject to excessive force by RPD in September 2019 and 2020. The plaintiffs sued the City of Rochester under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, &sect; 1985, and &sect; 1986. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought permanent injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys' fees. The plaintiffs claimed that the RPD used disproportionate force&ndash;both frequency and severity&ndash;against people of color and that the City of Rochester and RPD were deliberately indifferent to the widespread and decades-long racially disparate use of force by RPD officers against people of color. The plaintiffs further alleged that the defendants retaliated against them for engaging in speech and/or conduct protected by the First Amendment during the September protests in the wake of George Floyd and Daniel Prude. This case was assigned to Judge Frank P. Geraci, Jr.</p>\r\n<p>As of May 23, 2022, the defendants have moved to dismiss the plaintiffs' amended complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>",

In September 2020, the world witnessed Rochester Police Officers callously kill \nDaniel Prude, an unarmed Black man in obvious need of help. Although Mr. Prude was killed in \nMarch 2020, the Rochester Police Department suppressed the video for nearly six months. The \nfootage is truly shocking to watch: Mr. Prudeโnaked, bound and covered with a โspit hoodโโis \nasphyxiated and left to die in the middle of the street as police officers stand about, chatting and \nmocking him.  \n2.  The people of Rochester were heartbroken, but manyโespecially those in \nRochesterโs Black and Latinx communities, which account for more than 60% of the Cityโwere \nnot surprised. As the Mayor later acknowledged: โinstitutional structural racism led to Daniel \nPrudeโs death.โ The Mayor also conceded that โwe have a pervasive problem in the Rochester \nPolice Department.โ \n3.  This problem is indeed pervasive. The same year Mr. Prude was killed, a Ph.D. \ndissertation was published that analyzed over 3,000 use-of-force reports by Rochester Police \nDepartment officers from 2011 to 2016. The study concluded: โThe frequency and severity of \nforce are higher in neighborhoods with larger percentages of Black and Hispanic \nresidents,โ even when controlling for other factors, like crime rates. In other words, the \nRochester Police Department uses more force and more extreme force in Black and Hispanic \nneighborhoods. \n4.  For decades, Rochester City officials have responded with deliberate indifference \nto this problem. By failing to meaningfully train, supervise, and discipline officers who use \nexcessive force and instead suppressing evidence of officer misconduct and attacking critics of \nthe department, the City has fostered a culture of violence and impunity in its ranks.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 5 of 156\n \n5.  The Cityโs stubborn refusal to confront the pervasive problem of racism in the \nPolice Department is perhaps best illustrated by this fact: in developing the Cityโs plan to reform \nthe Department pursuant to Governor Cuomoโs recent Executive Order to โreinventโ policing in \nNew York, the Mayorโs proposed plan refused the call from community members and the Police \nAccountability Board to terminate police officers with ties to white supremacist groups. \nAlthough the City Council eventually voted to include that provision, it is the Mayor who has \nfinal authority over the police department. It is little wonder why people of color in Rochester \nfear and distrust the police. \n6.  Last fall, protesters, a vast majority of whom are Black, came together to protest \nthe killing of Mr. Prude and to demand an end to the racist policing they have endured for \ndecades. The City, in keeping with its long history, responded with the use of extreme violence \nand militarized police tacticsโincluding deploying batons, tear gas, flash-bang grenades, \narmored vehicles, and police dogsโto intimidate the protesters. Over the course of just three \ndays Rochester Police Department officers severely injured hundreds of protesters. Despite being \nlegally obligated to preserve all video evidence of the protests and the RPDโs response, the City \nfailed to do so.  \n7.  Simply put, a stunning historical record spanning more than four decades \ndemonstrates that the Rochester Police Departmentโs use-of-force practices continue to be \ninhumane, racist, and antithetical to the functioning of a civilized society. These practices violate \nthe Fourth Amendmentโs proscription of excessive force by the police, the Fourteenth \nAmendmentโs guarantee that a personโs race will not condemn them to violence or death at the \nhands of law enforcement officers, and the First Amendmentโs protection of free speech.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 6 of 156\n \n8.  Yet, the City is either unwilling or unable to stop these practices. Time and time \nagain, going back decades, the City and RPD have made hollow promises of reform but the \nculture of violent, racialized policing has not changed.   \n9.  Detailed more fully herein are more than fifty incidents of RPD officers using \nexcessive force against people of color. The victims of these incidents suffered devastating \ninjuries, and the following people were killed as a result of their encounters with the RPD: \nRonald Frazier, Denise Hawkins, Alecia McCuller, Kenneth Jackson, Louis Davila, Calvin \nGreene, Vandre Davis, Willie Carter, Craig Heard, Lawrence Rogers, Patricia Thompson, Shawn \nDukes, Hayden Blackman, Israel Andino, Richard Davis, Daniel Prude, and Tyshon Jones. \n10.  This lawsuit calls on the Court to fulfill its most fundamental roleโto protect and \ndefend the Constitution. The need for meaningful change in the Rochester Police Department is \nreal and for people of color in Rochester, it could not be more urgent. Plaintiffs bring this suit to \nend the RPDโs decades-long use of violent, unconstitutional forceโbefore more lives, more \nBlack and brown lives, are lost.  \nTHE PARTIES \n \n11.

NLG Rochester also helps coordinate legal \nrepresentation for protesters who are arrested.

This Court has federal-question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and \n1343 over claims arising out of violations of the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. \nยงยง 1983 and 1985. \n41.  Equitable relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202; Rule 57 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure; and the Courtโs inherent equitable authority.  \n42.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b), venue is proper in the Western District of New \nYork, the judicial district where the claims arose and in which the Defendants conduct business.  \nJURY TRIAL DEMAND \n \n43.  Plaintiffs demand a trial by jury on each and every claim to which they are legally \nentitled to a jury.  \nBACKGROUND \n \n44.  Rochester Police Department officers are sworn to serve and protect the Cityโs \npeople. But for decades, when Black and brown people in Rochester have turned to the police, \nthey have been met not with aid or empathyโbut with excessive, unconstitutional force.  \n45.  One year ago, on March 23, 2020, Daniel Prudeโs family sought help from the \nRPD as Daniel was suffering an acute mental health crisis. Tragically, that call for help ended \nwith Daniel naked and handcuffed with his face covered by a โspit hood,โ as an RPD officer \npushed his head into the freezing asphalt for several minutes. RPD officers on the scene mocked \nDaniel and chatted with each other while he asphyxiated. Daniel was declared brain dead that \nnight; he was taken off life support and died on March 30. As Danielโs brother Joe Prude later \nexplained in the most heartbreaking way, he called the police to get help for Daniel, โnot for \n[his] brother to get lynched. \n14 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 15 of 156\n \n \n \n(Photograph included with permission of Joe Prude)  \n \n46.  Danielโs death was foreshadowed by the RPDโs decades-long practice of using \nexcessive force on Black and brown residents of Rochester. That history is checkered with the \nRPD using that same excessive force against individuals in Rochester protesting police violence \nand racismโjust as it did in the recent demonstrations following Mr. Prudeโs homicide. \n47.  In 1975, Denise Hawkins, an 18-year-old Black woman, was shot and killed by a \nyoung, white RPD officer, Michael Leach, who responded to the domestic dispute between Ms. \nHawkins and her husband. The RPD claimed the shooting was justified. Leach would retire \ndecades later as a police captain.  \n48.  Public outrage about Ms. Hawkinsโ killing and RPDโs investigation led to calls \nfor reforming the RPD. In response, the City created the Citizens Committee on Police Affairs \n(known as the โCrimi Committeeโ) to examine how policing in Rochester could be improved. \nThe Committee found that police brutality both exists and is widespread in the City and \nrecommended sweeping changes. While the City claimed to adopt many of those changes, the \nRPDโs brutal and racist policing practices did not change. \n49.  Only eight years later, in 1983, another Black womanโthe 21-year-old daughter \nof a Crimi Committee memberโwas fatally shot by an RPD officer. Alecia McCuller was a \n15 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 16 of 156\n \nyoung mother in the midst of a domestic dispute. As her 6-year-old son powerfully described \nwhat happened: โMy mom told me to go to Cousin Idaโs house and tell her to call the police. \nThen the police cameโฆand the police shot. Thatโs the end of the story.โ  \n50.  In the wake of Ms. McCullerโs death, Rochesterโs Black community again called \nfor reform and accountability, emphasizing the Crimi Committeeโs findings. Demands for a \ncivilian review board increased, but the RPD did not change. \n51.  By 1990, three more Black citizensโKenneth Jackson, Louis Davila, and Calvin \nGreeneโwere killed during encounters with the RPD. Mr. Greene was shot five times at close \nrange while cowering, unarmed, in a crawlspace in his own apartment. But the RPDโs practice of \nusing excessive force, particularly against Black people, continued unabated.  \n52.  The front page of the Times-Union in April 1991 declared: โPolice Use of Force \nSoars. 852 People Were Injured in Encounters with City Officers Last YearโUp 136%.โ The \npaperโs multi-part series detailed the disproportionate use of force against Black and Hispanic \npeople in the City. Rev. Raymond L. Graves, a prominent leader in the community, beseeched \nthe City and RPD Chief: โStop looking the other way.โ   \n53.  The following year, RPDโs former Police Chief, Gordon Urlacher, was convicted \nin federal court of embezzlement after being indictedโalong with five officers under his \ncommandโfor โwide-ranging brutality and corruptionโ committed by the departmentโs Highway \nInterdiction Team or โHITโ squad. This rotating squad was started in 1988 to combat drug \nactivity, but the HIT squad patrolled almost exclusively in the Cityโs communities of color. All \nof the indicted officers were white. \n54.  After his embezzlement conviction, RPD Police Chief Urlacher separately pled \nguilty to civil rights conspiracy for condoning the officersโ violence and shielding them from \n16 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 17 of 156\n \naccountability. During a 10-week trial of other RPD officers, dozens of police witnesses testified \nwith immunity that they had witnessed egregious violence but lied during internal affairs \ninvestigationsโacknowledging the โcode of silenceโ within the department. The indicted \nofficers were ultimately acquitted by a jury made up of 11 white people and one Black person. \nOne of the officers, Michael Mazzeo, is now an RPD Investigator and the President of the Locust \nClub, Rochesterโs Police Union. \n55.  RPD officials claimed race was โnot at all an issueโ in the HIT squadโs alleged \nabuses, even though the allegations included shouting racial slurs, keeping a wooden stick that \nsquad members referred to as their โn----- stick,โ writing โillegal alienโ in pen on the forehead of \na young man, cutting a dreadlock from the head of another man, and dumping a โflour-like, \npowdery substanceโ on yet another. Federal authorities ultimately found the HIT squad had \nterrorized more than 30 victimsโkicking, punching, throwing them against walls or down stairs \nwhile restrained, and beating them with unauthorized weapons including blackjacks, a cattle \nprod, and lead-filled leather gloves.  \n56.  Yet Police officials took no meaningful action to curb the RPDโs deeply \nembedded culture of racism and impunity despite abundant evidence of its existence. Then-\nPolice Chief Roy Irving instead defended the RPDโs internal review process even while the \nformer Chief and five officers were under federal indictment: โThe system is fine. Thereโs \nnothing wrong with the system.โ The City meanwhile paid over $200,000 in settlements for at \nleast ten civil rights suits brought by victims of the HIT squadโs brutality. The City also paid \n$625,000 to settle the wrongful conviction of Maurice James, who was framed by HIT squad \nmembers and served over two years in a maximum-security prison for crimes he didnโt commit.  \n17 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 18 of 156\n \n57.  In a transparent effort to pacify the community, in 1992, the City Council passed \nlegislation creating a Civilian Review Board (โCRBโ). But rather than give the CRB any actual \noversight power, the Council made it โadvisoryโ only and allowed the RPD to continue \nconducting its own investigations, with the Chief of Police still having final say over any \ndiscipline.  \n58.  The CRB remains, as community members described it at the time, a โtoothless \ntiger.โ A comprehensive review of CRBโs efforts in 2017 concluded: \nThe current Civilian Review Board has seemingly had no effect on \nreducing incidents of police misconduct and excessive forceโฆ. This \nlack of effectiveness is primarily due to the fact that the CRB is not \nindependent  of  the  RPD;  thus,  it  cannot  conduct  its  own \ninvestigations, it cannot issue subpoenas to compel testimony or \nevidence, it cannot discipline officers, and it relies solely upon the \ninvestigative  materials  and  recommendations  provided  by  the \n[RPD].1 \n \n59.  Without external oversight, RPDโs culture of impunity continued to festerโwith \nincidents of racist policing and excessive force becoming more widespread and brazen. In 2002, \nfor example, Lawrence Rogersโa mentally-ill Black manโwas running in a parking lot, \nunarmed, wearing only his briefs. RPD officers tackled him to the ground and beat Mr. Rogers \nwith nightsticks, punched him, and pepper sprayed him. A video of the arrest showed an RPD \nofficer with his knee on Mr. Rogerโs neck during the incident. RPD officers also threatened and \npepper sprayed the woman who was filming the arrest and her daughter, which interrupted the \nfilming of Mr. Rogersโ arrest. Mr. Rogers suffered 27 lacerations, contusions, respiratory trauma, \nasphyxiation, and ultimately died from his injuries.  \n \n1 The Case for an Independent Police Accountability System (2017), report available at: \nhttp://enoughisenough.rocus.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-Case-for-an-Independent-Police-\nAccountability-System-2.1.17-FINAL.pdf \n18 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 19 of 156\n \n60.  Protesters marched in the City demanding answers and accountability after the \nvideo and several witness statements contradicted the officersโ account of what happened. \nThough the NAACP called for an outside investigation, none came. The RPD cleared the officers \nof any wrongdoing; all four are still employed by the Department, one has been promoted to \nSergeant, another has been made an Investigator.  \n61.  Time and again, RPD officers who use excessive force are promoted within the \nDepartment. Officer Mark Simmons, for example, was eventually promoted to interim Police \nChief and most recently, Deputy Chief, long after a 2005 incident in which he shot an unarmed \n13-year-old girl, Lashedica Mason. Officer Simmons claimed Lashedica โrushedโ him with a \nknife. But family members reported that the girl, who had locked herself in the bathroom, \ndropped the knife out the window before she emerged, and police photographs showed a knife in \nthe driveway and the bathroom window screen askew. Nevertheless, the Department declared \nOfficer Simmons โacted in an appropriate mannerโฆthe way he was trained to act,โ and he was \nnamed the July 2005 โofficer of the monthโ for his actions. Lashedica suffered years of \nsurgeries, had her right fingertip amputated, and still has a bullet fragment in her right kidney.  \n62.  The following year, Officer Jeffrey LaFave shot a mentally distraught Black \nwoman, Patricia Thompson, in her home. Her husband, who called the police, explained: โI \ncalled them to take her to the hospital, I never called for them to kill her.โ Although \nMs. Thompson had a knife at one point, witnesses reported that she had retreated and tripped \nbefore Officer LaFave shot her. LaFave received the โExcellent Police Serviceโ award that year; \nhe is now a Lieutenant.  \n63.  Just a few months later, Russell Davis, a Black man, was outside of his own \napartment building when several RPD officers approached him with guns drawn. Sergeant \n19 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 20 of 156\n \nRonald Malley and another officer jumped Mr. Davis and violently wrestled him to the ground. \nEven though the building superintendent told the officers that Mr. Davis lived there, officers still \nhandcuffed him and placed him in the cruiser. When Mr. Davis filed a civilian complaint with \nRPD, it was Malley who conducted the internal investigation and he was cleared of wrongdoing. \nMalley has since been promoted to Lieutenant.  \n64.  In response to Ms. Thompsonโs death, people marched from City Hall to the \nPublic Safety Building (โPSBโ) demanding change and accountability. City and RPD officials \nresponded with lip service about the integrity of the Departmentโs internal investigations and \ntook no meaningful steps toward reform. \n65.  Predictably, the Cityโs persistent indifference led officers to continue engaging in \nunlawful, racialized violence, which resulted in the senseless deaths of many more Black and \nbrown menโ Shawn Dukes in 2008, Hayden Blackman in 2011, Israel โIzzyโ Andino in 2012, \nRichard Gregory Davis in 2015โand the routine abuse of countless other people of color.  \n66.  In 2011, City Councilmember Adam McFadden wrote a letter to the Mayor, \nPolice Chief, and Council President charging that the City had โlost control of its police force.โ \nHe detailed how, for eight years, the overwhelming majority of calls to his offices were \ncomplaints from citizens of color about their treatment by officersโwith the hundreds of \ncomplaints by Black and Latinx individuals about being racially profiled, arbitrarily stopped, and \nfalsely arrested without cause. His letter concludes: โOf the hundreds and hundreds of phone \ncalls I have received regarding police complaints, I have never been informed by the Rochester \n20 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 21 of 156\n \nPolice Department of any disciplinary procedure brought against a police officer for any of these \ncomplaints.โ2  \n67.  And yet, to this day, City and RPD officials have not taken any meaningful action \nto curb these abuses and continue to foster a culture of racism and brutality within the \nDepartment by failing to train, supervise, and discipline officers who use unlawful force against \nBlack and brown people. Instead, time and again, the Department grants these officers awards \nand promotes them. As a result, RPD officers know they can engage in unlawful force with \nimpunity. \n68.  Though the people of Rochester have continued to fight for accountability and \nchange, these efforts have been thwarted. In November 2019, residents voted overwhelmingly \nfor the creation of a Police Accountability Board (โPABโ). But the Locust Club filed a lawsuit to \nstrip the PAB of its disciplinary powers. (That case remains pending on appeal as of this \namended complaint.) \n69.  Indeed, not only are City and RPD officials complicit in failing to train, supervise, \nand discipline officers who openly and repeatedly use violence against people of color, but they \nare actively involved in covering up evidence of such violence to protect the officers and the \nDepartment.   \n70.  As the six-month investigation conducted by Special Counsel Investigator \nAndrew G. Celli Jr., recently concluded: Defendants WARREN, then-Police Chief \nSINGLETARY, and other Rochester officials knew about the circumstances of Mr. Prudeโs  \ndeath in March 2020, six months before the footage was made public, and yet, WARREN, \n \n2 Letter from City Councilmember Adam McFadden, Public Safety Chair, to Mayor, then-Council \nPresident WARREN, and Police Chief (June 29, 2011), \nhttp://rochester.indymedia.org/sites/default/files/McFadden%20Letter.pdf. \n21 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 22 of 156\n \nSINGLETARY, and other City officials suppressed the circumstances surrounding Mr. Prudeโs \ndeath and made untrue statements to the public concerning the timing of their knowledge.3 \n71.  Deputy Mayor James P. Smithโs preliminary investigation in September 2020 \nreached the same conclusion: โ[T]he lens of the badge and culture of acceptance appears to \nextend to City Hall and the highest reaches of the Administration.โ The handling of Mr. Prudeโs \nhomicide by both City Hall and the Department, he continued, โraises questions regarding the \nreporting of other such arrests,โ including the fatal TASER death of Richard Gregory in May \n2015 and the use-of-force in the arrest of Christopher Pate in May 2018.4   \nPROTESTS FOLLOWING THE HOMICIDES OF GEORGE FLOYD AND DANIEL \nPRUDE \n \n72.  On May 25, 2020, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George \nFloyd, who was handcuffed and lying face down on the ground, by suffocating him to death in \nbroad daylight on the street. \n73.  Floydโs murder and the police murder of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, \nin addition to recent police murders of other Black people in the United States sparked the largest \nmovement for social and racial justice in history and has included peaceful protests around the \nworld against anti-Black police violence, systemic racism, and inequality. \n74.  On May 30, 2020, Plaintiff DEGUZMAN and others attended a peaceful protest \nin front of the Public Safety Building (โPSBโ) in downtown Rochester.  \n \n3 Andrew G. Celli, Jr., Independent Investigation of the City of Rochesterโs Response to the Death of \nDaniel Prude Final Report (Mar. 12, 2011), https://ecbawm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Final-\nReport-of-the-Independent-Investigation-of-the-City-of-Rochesters-Response-to-the-Death-of-Daniel-\nPrude-issued-March-12-2021-00452102x9CCC2.pdf.  \n4 Deputy Mayor Justin Smith, Managerial Review of the Death of Daniel Prude (Sept. 16. 2020), \nhttps://www.cityofrochester.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=21474845191.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 23 of 156\n \n75.  At the time of the May 30, 2020 protest, Defendants had closed Exchange \nBoulevard in the vicinity of the PSB to vehicular traffic.  \n76.  In response to the peaceful protest, Defendants and their employees and agents \nsubjected Plaintiffs to grossly excessive and disproportionate force.  \n77.  As a peaceful demonstration took place, RPD officers and Sheriffโs Deputies \npepper sprayed protesters, indiscriminately shot pepper balls into the crowd, physically pushed \nprotesters and struck them with batons. \n78.  Officers also targeted and shot at journalists, legal observers, and people who \nwere recording officers. \n79.  For example, Plaintiff DEGUZMAN was present at the protest in his capacity as a \nprofessional photojournalist. While present on the sidewalk on Exchange Boulevard, in the \nvicinity of the steps in front of the Hall of Justice, gathered with other members of the press, Mr. \nDEGUZMAN was targeted by RPD officers and/or Sheriffโs deputies and shot several times \nwith pepper balls as he was filming the police interaction with protesters. Upon information and \nbelief, Mr. DEGUZMAN was targeted and shot in retaliation for exercising his right to film the \nDefendant law enforcement officers performing their duties in a public place.  \n80.  Mr. DEGUZMAN was not committing any crime or violation when he was shot, \nand the RPD officers and/or Sheriffโs Deputies who shot him lacked any cause or legal \njustification for using any force against him whatsoever.  \n81.  As a result of the violent response of the RPD officers and Sheriffโs Deputies on \nMay 30, 2020, the Mr. DEGUZMAN and many others were injured and harmed.  \n82.  Months before George Floydโs murder, on March 23, 2020, Daniel Prudeโs family \nsought help from the RPD as Daniel was suffering an acute mental health crisis. Tragically, that \n23 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 24 of 156\n \ncall for help ended with Daniel naked and handcuffed with his face covered by a โspit hood,โ as \nan RPD officer pushed his head into the freezing asphalt for several minutes. RPD officers on the \nscene mocked Daniel and chatted with each other while he asphyxiated. Daniel was declared \nbrain dead that night; he was taken off life support and died on March 30. \n83.  When the video of RPD Officers killing Daniel Prude was finally made public on \nSeptember 2, 2020, it sparked nationwide outrage. In Rochester, thousands of people gathered to \nmourn the loss of Black lives, demand the City finally end its racist and brutal policing practices, \nand call for new visions of public safety that value Black lives. These protests continue to the \npresent day. \n84.  Between the May 30, 2020 protest and the September protests, on July 13, 2020, \nthe RPD quietly updated its departmental policy on usage of the PepperBall Launching System \n(โPLSโ). Specifically, the Department amended the policy to allow officers on the patrol division \nto use the PLS. Prior to this amendment, only officers on the Special Weapons and Tactics \n(โSWATโ) team were eligible to use PLS. The RPD did not update the policy in any other way. \n85.  Under RPD General Order 630, an officer is ineligible to join the SWAT team if \nhe has โany instance of sustained excessive forceโ or โseriousโ misconduct in his disciplinary \nhistory. The Patrol Division (or Mobile Field Force team) does not have any such eligibility \nrequirement.  \n86.  On information and belief, the Department updated this policy to ensure more \nofficers could (and would) be able to use the PLS in anticipation of protests after the suppressed \nfootage was released. By removing any โdisciplinary history check,โ the Department knew or \nhad reason to know that RPD officers would use excessive force when engaging with \nprotestersโwhich they did. \n24 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 25 of 156\n \n87.  Protesters have gathered outside the PSB, chanted, and held signs. Some of the \nprotestersโ chants and signs were specific to Daniel Prude; others decried the pattern of \nracialized, violent policing in Rochester, of which Mr. Prudeโs killing was the latest, most \negregious example. Many protesters, including several named Plaintiffs, chose to protest because \nof their firsthand experiences or experiences of family members with the RPD, which left them \nhurt or afraid.  \n88.  The largest of these protests took place between September 2 and September 5, \n2020. As part of its common practice, the RPD responded to these protests with extreme and \nunnecessary forceโincluding the indiscriminate use of tear gas and pepper spray, 40 millimeter \nblunt-impact projectiles, thousands of pepper balls, flash-bang grenades and other supposedly \nโless-than-lethalโ munitions. The Cityโs use of violent, militarized police tactics against Black \nand brown protesters and their allies was in line with their decades-long practice of suppressing \npolice critics through unconstitutional means. \n89.  Although termed โnonlethalโ or โless-than-lethalโ force, military-grade crowd \ncontrol devices like those used by the RPD involve serious risks of injury, and even death. \nChemical irritants (โCIsโ), like tear gas, are banned in warfare because they are indiscriminate \nweapons by design, especially when deployed by firing a grenade or canister. CIs can cause \nsevere injury or death, and, even at low concentrations, exposure to tear gas presents a risk of \nserious, irreversible health effects.  \n90.  Over the course of three nights, RPD officers fired tear gas canisters 77 times into \ngroups of protesters expressly gathered to support Black lives, at journalists and legal observers \nattempting to report on and record the abuse, and at medics there to provide care and safety to \nthe protestersโoften when people had no escape route to get away from the chemical clouds. \n25 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 26 of 156\n \nThe tear gas canisters are themselves projectile weapons; direct impact can cause significant \nblunt trauma, including bone fractures, lacerations and internal bleeding, and death. One \nprotester struck in the face by a canister required stitches both inside and outside her mouth and \nhas permanent facial scarring. \n91.  Over those three nights, RPD officers also discharged 6,100 pepper balls at people \nwho had gathered to protest the Departmentsโ aggressive and racist practices. Other cities \nresponded to last summerโs racial justice protests without a fraction of this amount of force. In \nNew York City, for example, which saw thousands of demonstrators take to the streets, NYPD \nofficers fired not one pepper ball. By contrast, one RPD officer on the night of September 4, \n2020, fired 148 pepper balls in the span of just twenty minutes, at a group of people who were \npenned in or โkettledโ by police on the Court Street Bridge in downtown Rochester.   \n92.  RPD officers also shot protesters with 40mm direct-impact foam bulletsโknown \nas kinetic impact projectiles (โKIPSโ)โwhich can cause a range of injuries including death. \nKIPs are inherently inaccurate when fired from afar and so they often injure bystanders and \nstrike vulnerable body parts of intended targets and bystanders. RPD officers fired CTS 40 mm \nmunitions during the protest. The CTS website cautions that shots to the head, neck, thorax, \nheart, or spine can result in fatal or serious injury. Use of force reports by RPD officers detail \ndeploying 40mm munitions at individualsโ abdomens at the September 5 demonstration.     \n93.  Other indiscriminate, military-grade weapons employed by the RPD and law \nenforcement agencies working with the RPD included flash bang grenades and a Long Range \nAcoustic Device (โLRADโ), which is both a sound system and a sonic weapon that can cause \npermanent hearing damage. Beyond these militarized weapons, in keeping with the long-\nstanding practice, RPD officers also struck countless peaceful protesters with their batons. Per its \n26 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 27 of 156\n \nwebsite, the Locust ClubโRPDโs Police Unionโis named for โthe kind of wood that all \nRochester police nightsticks were once made from.โ Baton strikes can cause severe blunt injuries \nincluding bone fractures, internal bleeding, and death; a recent study by Physicians for Human \nRights concluded that the baton in particular has a greater risk of death than tear gas.  \nThe CITY and RPD Coordinated with the COUNTY, BAXTER, MCSO and State Police to \nSuppress Peaceful Demonstrations  \n94.  As part of the City and RPDโs coordinated strategy to deny members of the Black \nand brown communities of Rochester their right to grieve, express anger, and demand justice \nfrom the Department, Mayor WARREN and then-Chief SINGLETARY asked the New York \nState Police and Monroe County Sheriffโs Office to send law enforcement officers to Rochester.  \n95.  City Defendants invited State Troopers and Monroe County deputies to create an \nintimidating law enforcement response that was militarized; the State Police, for example, were \noutfitted in full riot gear and brought with them armored vehicles.  \n96.  The multi-agency response was managed under a unified command system \nbetween the CITY and the RPD; the COUNTY, MCSO and BAXTER; and the State Police.  \n97.  Upon information and belief, Defendant SINGLETARY oversaw the unified \ncommand system for the CITY and RPD.  \n98.  Upon information and belief, Defendant BAXTER oversaw the unified command \nsystem for the COUNTY and MCSO.  \n99.  As part of the multi-agency response, at the direction of Defendant \nSINGLETARY, the CITY deployed the RPDโs Special Weapons and Tactics (โSWATโ) team, \nMobile Field Force (โMFFโ), the Grenadier Team, and the the Tactical Unit (โTACTโ), along \nwith their militarized vehicles, weapons, equipment and uniforms. The SWAT team is part of the \nRPDโs Special Operations Divisoin (โSODโ), which was at all times commanded by Defendant \n27 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 28 of 156\n \nFAVOR. The MFF is also part of the SOD, and was at all times commanded by Defendant \nDEARCOP. The Grenadier Team is part of the MFF, and was at all times commanded by \nDefendant LUCYSHYN. TACT is part of the SOD, and was at all times commanded by \nDefendant MONTINARELLI. \n100.  Upon information and belief, Defendants SINGLETARY, FAVOR, DEARCOP, \nLUCYSHYN, and MONTINARELLI (hereinafter โRPD protest policymakersโ) developed the \nRPDโs policies and practices, and coordinated and oversaw the RPDโs response to the protests \ndescribed herein.  \n101.  Upon information and belief, on the nights of the protests detailed herein, \nDefendants SINGLETARY and FAVOR were present in the RPDโs Command Post and were \noverseeing and directing RPD officers and other law enforcement officersโ response to the \nprotesters, including the use of specific tactics and weapons.  \n102.  Upon information and belief, on the nights of the protests detailed herein, \nDefendants BAXTER and other commanding officers of the MCSO and County were present in \nthe MCSO Command Post and were overseeing and directing Defendant Richard Roe Sheriffโs \nDeputiesโ response to the protesters, and coordinating with the RPD protest policymakers about \nthe response to protesters, including the use of specific tactics and weapons.  \n103.  On the nights of the protest detailed herein, Defendants DEARCOP, \nMONTINARELLI, LUCYSHYN and POTUCK were the commanding officers on the scene; \nthey would communicate with SINGLETARY, FAVOR and other RPD commanding officers at \nthe Command Post via their radios and other mobile communications systems; and upon \ninformationa and belief, they were responsible for implementing and carrying out the on-the-\n28 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 29 of 156\n \nground multi-agency response to the protests, including ordering and directing the use of specific \ntactics and weapons against protesters. \n104.  Upon information and belief, the CITY, by and through the RPD protest \npolicymakers, conspired with the the highest-ranking COUNTY and MCSO supervisory and \npolicymaking officials, including but not limited to Defendant BAXTER and other COUNTY \npolicymakers, to respond to the peaceful protests with overwhelming violence based on the \nmessage they were expressing, which constituted a violation of the protestersโ equal protection \nrights and otherwise violated their civil rights.  \n105.  Upon information and belief, on or about September 2, 2020, the RPD protest \npolicymakers and BAXTER and other COUNTY policymakers created a joint law enforcement \nprotest response strategy that instructed RPD officers and Sheriffโs Deputties to respond to \nprotesters with unconstitutional and unnecessary force, including the use of chemical weapons \nand โless lethalโ munitions, including potentially deadly projectiles.  \n106.  Upon information and belief, on or about September 2, 2020, the RPD protest \npolicymakers and BAXTER and other COUNTY policymakers created a joint law enforcement \nprotest response strategy that instructed their law enforcement officers to use excessive and \nunconstitutional levels of force against the protesters in retaliation for the protestersโ messageโ\ncalling for greater police accountability, a reallocation of funding from away from police \ndepartments and into Black and Latinx communities, the end of police brutality, and a \nrecognition that Black Lives Matter. The purpose of this conspiracy was to deprive the protesters \nof the equal protection of the laws, based on their message.  \n107.  Upon information and belief, on or about September 2, 2020, the RPD protest \npolicymakers and BAXTER and other COUNTY policymakers created a joint law enforcement \n29 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 30 of 156\n \nprotest response strategy that instructed RPD officers and Sheriffโs Deputies to use \nindiscriminate force against โgroupsโ of protesters. \n108.  Upon information and belief, on or about September 2, 2020, the RPD protest \npolicymakers and BAXTER and other COUNTY policymakers created a joint law enforcement \nprotest response strategy that instructed RPD officers and Sheriffโs Deputies to use force against \nโgroupsโ of protesters, without first having made an individualized determination that there was \na lawful basis to use force against any individual in the group based on their own individual \nconduct, as opposed to the perceived โgroup conduct.โ \n109.  Upon information and belief, the RPD protest policymakers failed to train RPD \nofficers on how to lawfully police protests. For example, RPD protest policymakers failed to \ninstruct and/or train officers that they had to have individualized probable cause to arrest \nindivduals based on their own, individual conduct, as opposed to the perceived โgroup conduct.โ \nRPD protest policymakers also failed to instruct and/or train officers that they had to have an \nindividualized lawful basis to use force against protesters, and that it was unlawrful to \nindiscriminately use force against โgroupsโ of protesters based on perceived โgroup conduct.โ As \na result, hundreds of protesters were seriously injured by the Defendant RPD officers.  \n110.  Instead, upon information and belief, RPD protest policymakers unlawfully \ninstructed and/or trained officers to use indiscriminate force against โ including shooting \nprojectiles into groups of peopleโwithout making any individualized determination that they \nwere legally justified to use force against any individual in the perceived โgroup.โ As a result, \nhundreds of protesters were seriously injured by the Defendant RPD officers. \n111.  Upon information and belief, RPD protest policymakers instructed RPD officers \nthat they were permitted to aim and shoot pepper balls and other projectiles at the heads of \n30 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 31 of 156\n \nprotesters, despite knowing that protesters could be seriously injured in struck if they were struck \nthe face and/or head with projectiles. As a result, the Defendant RPD officers shot numerous \nprotesters in the face and head with projectiles, causing them to sustain serious injuries, some of \nwhich are detailed below. \n112.  Upon information and belief, BAXTER and other COUNTY policymakers failed \nto train MCSO Sheriffโs Deputies on how to lawfully police protests. For example, BAXTER \nand other COUNTY policymakers failed to instruct MCSO Sheriffโs Deputies that they had to \nhave individualized probable cause to arrest indivduals based on their own, individual conduct, \nas opposed to the perceived โgroup conduct.โ BAXTER and other COUNTY policymakers also \nfailed to instruct and/or train MCSO Sheriffโs Deputies that they had to have an individualized \nlawful basis to use force against protesters, and that it was unlawrful to indiscriminately use \nforce against โgroupsโ of protesters based on perceived โgroup conduct.โ As a result, hundreds \nof protesters were seriously injured by the Defendant โRichard Roeโ Sheriffโs Deputies. \n113.  Instead, upon information and belief, BAXTER and other COUNTY \npolicymakers unlawfully instructed and/or trained MCSO Sheriffโs Deputies to use \nindiscriminate force againstโincluding shooting projectiles into groups of peopleโwithout \nmaking any individualized determination that they were legally justified to use force against any \nindividual in the perceived โgroup.โ As a result, hundreds of protesters were seriously injured by \nDefendant โRichard Roeโ Sheriffโs Deputies. \n114.  Upon information and belief, BAXTER and other COUNTY policymakers \ninstructed MCSO Sheriffโs Deputies that they were permitted to aim and shoot pepper balls and \nother projectiles at the heads of protesters, despite knowing that protesters could be seriously \ninjured if they were struck in the face and/or head with projectiles. As a result, Defendant \n31 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 32 of 156\n \nโRichard Roeโ Sheriffโs Deputies shot numerous protesters in the face and head with projectiles, \ncausing them to sustain serious injuries, some of which are detailed below. \n115.  The constitutionally deficient protest response policy became immediately clear \non September 2, 2020 and September 3, 2020, as dozens of protesters were seriously injured as a \nresult of the unlawful policies and practices of the CITY, yet the CITY failed to take any steps to \ncure its unlawful policies, practices and training to ensure that RPD officers stopped using \ngrossing excessive and unconstitutional force against protesters. This failure led to a further \nviolation of the rights of the Plaintiffs and other protesters. This failure to remedy the \nunconstititonal protest response policies, practices and training led the Defendant RPD officers \nto further violate of the rights of the Plaintiffs and other protesters in the ensuing days and \nweeks.  \n116.  Similarly, after the constitutionally deficient protest response policy became \nimmediately clear on September 2, 2020 and September 3, 2020, as dozens of protesters were \nseriously injured as a result of the unlawful policies, practices and training of the COUNTY, \nMCSO and BAXTER and other County policymakers, the COUNTY, MCSO and BAXTER and \nother County policymakers failed to take any steps to cure their unlawful policies, practices and \ntraining to ensure that MCSO Sheriffโs Deputies stopped using grossing excessive and \nunconstitutional force against protesters. This failure to remedy the unconstititonal protest \nresponse policies, practices and training led the MCSO and the Defendant โRichard Roeโ \nSheriffโs Deputies to further violate of the rights of the Plaintiffs and other protesters in the \nensuing days and weeks.  \n117.  Upon information and belief, the RPD protest policymakers and BAXTER and \nother County policymakers conspired together and purposefully failed to remedy the \n32 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 33 of 156\n \nunconstititonal protest response policies, practices and training because they shared the joint goal \nof silencing the message of the protesters: calling for greater police accountability, a reallocation \nof funding from away from police departments and into Black and Latinx communities, the end \nof police brutality, and a recognition that Black Lives Matter. RPD protest policymakers and \nBAXTER and other County policymakers ratified the unconstitutional and brutally violent \nprotest response, and instructed their officers to respond to further protests with even greater \nviolence.  \n118.  Mayor WARREN and then-Chief SINGLETARY also asked the State Police to \ncome to Rochester with full knowledgeโas they later acknowledged in a briefing to City \nCouncilโthat the State Police would bring dogs as part of their formation. RPDโs own general \norders expressly prohibit the use of police dogs for crowd control.  \n119.  Along with the RPD, the MCSO and State Police contributed personnel and \nresources to create a massive police presence to confront those assembled in peaceful protest to \ncall the RPD to account for its widespread use of violence against people of color.  \n120.  PAB Chair Shani Wilson described the impact of the RPD and law enforcementโs \nstaggeringly violent response to the September racial justice protests: \nOver the past year, police response to protest have defined our City. \nโฆ What Rochesterians saw and experienced has left them with deep \nscars, both physical and mental. Citizens have said that they were \nconfronted by military-styled police formations and vehicles, they \nwere chased through neighborhoods, tackled on the pavement, some \nwere struck by police vehicles, whacked with batons, shot in the \nchest with pepper balls, hit in the head with flashbangs, fumigated \nby tear gas, and overwhelmed by sound cannonsโฆ. They [have] \nsuffered serious injuries that were sustained from the use of so-\ncalled โless-lethalโ weapons and many are still experiencing the \nhealth impacts of harm done to them during protests. \n \n33 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 34 of 156\n \n121.  Local lawmakers denounced RPDโs use of chemicals and projectiles against \ncitizens exercising their First Amendment right to protest police brutality. After attending the \ndemonstrations one night, City Council member Mary Lupien and Monroe County Legislator \nRachel Barnhart asked the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the RPDโs actionsโciting \nthe presence of tanks, dogs, pepper balls, pepper spray, tear gas and the RPDโs escalation and \ndisproportionate use of force. Both elected officials were hit with pepper balls and pepper \nsprayed while peacefully protesting.  \n122.  Zachary Robertsโan international photojournalist who has published in Al \nJazeera and produced pieces for the BBCโwas covering the protests in Rochester. He called the \nRPDโs use of force โone of the single most violent things Iโve seen in my years in journalism,โ \nafter a hundred officers charged protesters using pepper bullets on September 3. โAlmost every \nsingle person here is affected.โ  \n123.  Plaintiff REYNALDO DEGUZMANโalso a photojournalist who was at the \nprotests as a member of the pressโdescribed the RPDโs response in a statement to City Council \nas one โof unmitigated aggression, violent military grade tactics, and weaponry used on \nundergrads, nurses, construction workers, teachers, elderly clergy, men and women in \nwheelchairs holding umbrellas to shield themselves from chemical warfare.โ In filming the \nprotests, he โcaptured people with lost eyes, broken limbs, and many suffering from early stages \nof PTSDโincluding colleagues who work for local news that havenโt been able to go out in the \nfield because of what they witnessed.โ  \n124.  Pursuant to policy, to avoid accountability, the vast majory of RPD officers did \nnot activate their body worn cameras when they used force or made arrests during the protests.  \n34 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 35 of 156\n \n125.  Similarly, pursuant to policy and to avoid accountability, the vast majority of \nRPD officers did not complete a Subject Resistance Report or otherwise document the force they \nused against protesters.  \n126.  Upon information and belief, the RPD protest policymakers instructed the \nDefendant RPD officers that they were not required to activate their body worn cameras during \nthe protests and that they did not have to complete Subject Resistance Reports when they used \nforce against protesters.  \n127.  The CITY and RPD also destroyed video of the protests recorded on the Cityโs \nBlue Light cameras, despite a preservation letter having been served on Corporation Counselโs \noffice on September 14, 2020 and acknowledged the same dayโwell within the Cityโs allged \n30-day retention period. Upon information and belief, despite receiving a specific demand for \npreservation of relevant Blue Light camera footage from the protests, the CITY and the RPD \ndestroyed the footage because it clearly showed Defendants using excessive and unjustified force \nagainst protesters.  \n128.  While hundreds of peaceful protesters, many of them Black and brown, were \ninjured by RPDโs violent response to the demonstrations, the Department condoned its officersโ \nactions. Former-Chief SINGLETARY stated that RPD officers โshowed restraintโ on a day that \nmany peaceful demonstrators, including elected officials, were shot in the head with pepper \nballs, pepper sprayed, and worse. Deputy Chief Mark Mura declared that the tactics RPD used \nwere โtactful, per policy and training, and appropriate for the situation at hand.โ Mayor \nWARREN also praised RPD officers afterward: โ[Y]ou made us very, very proud.โ   \n129.  The policies and practices of the City of Rochester were the moving force of the \nevents and injuries described below and they continue to threaten and violate the constitutional \n35 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 36 of 156\n \nrights of the people who oppose these policies and practices and seek to petition the City to \nreform the RPD.  \n130.  Similarly, BAXTER apparently acknowledged the shortcomings of the law \nenforcement response to protests, including the unconstitutional response of the Defendant \nSheriffโs Deputies, in a public statement released on September 5, 2020, where he stated: โThe \neyes of the nation are on Rochester, now is the time to step up. We need to walk forward โ \ntogether โ one step at a time. The greater Rochester community is better than this.โ  \n131.  The policies and practices of the COUNTY, MCSO and BAXTER were the \nmoving force of the events and injuries described below and they continue to threaten and violate \nthe constitutional rights of the people who oppose these policies and practices and seek to \npetition the City and COUNTY to reform the MCSO and other local law enforcement agiencies.  \n132.  As a result of the brutally violent protest response by the CITY and the RPD, and \nthe COUNTY, MSCO and BAXTER, FTP has been prevented from organizing further protest \nactivity in the City of Rochester, as its members have been chilled and deterred from engaging in \nfurther protest activities for fear of facing further physical, emotional and psychological violence \nand trauma as that described below. For example, on February 23, 2021, when the New York \nState Attorney General failed to secure an indictment of the RPD officers who killed Daniel \nPrude, FTP was unable to organize successful protests because its members and other members \nof the community were traumatized from the unconstitutionally violent and brutal response to the \nprotests in September 2020 by the Defendants.  \nWednesday, September 2, 2020 \n133.  On September 2, 2020, Plaintiffs FREE THE PEOPLE ROC (โFTP ROCโ) and \nSTANLEY MARTIN held a press conference with the family of Daniel Prude, where they \nannounced the release of body worn camera video showing RPD officers Mark Vaughn, \n36 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 37 of 156\n \nFrancisco Santiago, and Troy Taladay using wholly unlawfulโand patently unnecessaryโ\nphysical force against Daniel Prude during a โmental healthโ arrest nearly six months prior on \nMarch 23, 2020. The footage showed several other RPD officers laughing with each other and \nridiculing Mr. Prude rather than intervening to stop the illegal use of force.  \n134.  At the press conference, MARTIN, FTP ROC, and Joe PrudeโDaniel Prudeโs \nbrotherโ revealed that the City and RPD had suppressed the body worn camera video to cover \nup the RPDโs responsibility for Mr. Prudeโs death. \n135.  In response, Defendants WARREN and SINGLETARY held a press conference \nat the PSB. RPD Officer Taladay, one of the officers directly responsible for Mr. Prudeโs death, \nwas on duty that day at the PSB. Although SINGLETARY reviewed the footage of Mr. Prudeโs \narrest in March 2020, six months earlier, he affirmatively decided not to reassign any of the \nofficers involved to administrative duty but rather to permit them to keep working in public-\nfacing roles.   \n136.  The RPD refused to allow Mr. Prudeโs family, MARTIN, or members of FTP \nROC to attend the press conference at the PSB. When members of FTP ROC attempted to gain \nentry, RPD officers arrested MARTIN and others inside of the PSB.  \n137.  MARTIN was violently arrested by Defendant Officer WILLIAM BAKER and \nfalsely charged with trespass. As a result of the excessive force used against them, MARTIN \nsustained a sprained ankle. The false criminal charges against MARTIN were later dismissed.  \n138.  As word spread about the press conference, people assembled outside of the PSB.  \nMeanwhile, the City and RPD developed and implemented a strategy to silence this peaceful and \nlawful exercise of rightsโthis included calling in the State Troopers and Sheriffโs Deputies to \n37 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 38 of 156\n \nassemble a massive police presence. This coordinated strategy validated and encouraged the use \nof intimidation, excessive force, and illegal arrests by RPD officers during the protests.  \n139.  First, the RPD along with troopers and deputies erected barriers in front of the \nPSB and closed portions of Exchange Boulevard to vehicular traffic. As a peaceful \ndemonstration took place, RPD officers pepper sprayed protesters and indiscriminately shot \npepper balls into the crowd: \n(RPD officer firing pepper balls at the crowd in front of PSB; State Troopers in the \nbackground) \n \n38 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 39 of 156\n \n \n(Plaintiff EMILY MCINTYRE holding an umbrella against pepper balls)  \n140.  Officers also targeted and shot at journalists, legal observers, and people who \nwere recording officers, including Plaintiff ANTHONY HALL. Around 12:30 a.m., HALL was \nstanding in front of the Public Safety Building recording the police actions with his cellphone \nwhen an officer shot him in the hand with a pepper ball, knocking his phone out of his hand.  \n141.  Other named plaintiffs were subjected to unconstitutional force by Defendant \nJohn Doe RPD Officers and Richard Roe Sheriffโs Deputies on September 2-3 as well: \na.  Reynaldo DeGuzman: throughout the day, Mr. DeGuzman was  acting in his \ncapacity as a professional photojournalist, and was targeted and shot with with \npepper balls twice at approximately 4:48 p.m. and 4:54 p.m. in retaliation for \ndocumenting law enforcement officersโ response to the peaceful protests.  \nb.  Emily McIntyre: Ms. McIntyre was on the sidewalk in front of the PSB, in front \nof the barricades, when she was repeatedly pepper sprayed from close range, as \ndepicted in the picture above.  \nc.  Lore McSpadden-Walker: at approximately 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., on Exchange \nStreet in the vicinity of the front of the Public Safety Building, Mx. McSpadden-\n39 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 40 of 156\n \nWalker was exposed to large amounts of chemical weapons, including chemicals \nfrom pepper balls. \nd.  Nicholas Robertson: between approximately 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m., Mr. \nRobertson was on the sidewalk in front of the PSB, peacefully protesting in front \nof the barricades, when he was sprayed with large amounts of pepper spray and \ntear gas. \n142.  Mr. HALL, Mr. DEGUZMAN, journalists, legal observers, and people who were \nrecording officers were targeted and attacked pursuant to the RPDโs policy of retaliating against \nindividuals who exercise their first amendment right to video record police officers performing \ntheir duties in public places.  \nThursday, September 3 to Friday, September 4, 2020 \n143.  The evening of September 3, 2020, a larger group of peaceful protesters, many of \nthem Black and brown, assembled in front of the PSB to call for justice for Mr. Prude and an end \nto the RPDโs brutal and racist policing.  \n40 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 41 of 156\n \n(Plaintiff Stanley Martin, left, at the protest)5 \n144.  Again, the law enforcement response was violent and chaotic. Within hours, \nRochester would resemble a war zone, with RPD officers, NYS Troopers, and MSCO officers \nunleashing flash grenades, tear gas, and thousands of pepper balls on the crowd. \n145.  On that night, BAXTER, the COUNTY and MCSO deployed two surveillance \ndrones to fly over the protesters, which transmitted video footage back to the MCSO and RPD \nCommand Posts.  \n146.  Using the video footage, upon information and belief, Defendants SINGLETARY \nand FAVOR coordinated with BAXTER and other commanding officers of the MCSO and \nCOUNTY to direct the John Doe RPD Officers and Richard Roe Sheriffโs Deputiesโ response to \nprotesters on the ground, including the use of specific tactics and weapons.  \n147.  Defendant LUCYSHYN was the commanding officer at the scene, and \nMONTINARELLI and DEARCOP were the commanders of the RPDโs Tactical Unit. Upon \ninformation and belief, they directed the Defendant John Doe RPD Officers and Richard Roe \n \n5 This photograph and others herein are included with permission of the photographer subject to her \ncopyright.   \n41 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 42 of 156\n \nSheriffs Deputiesโ response to protesters on the ground, including by ordering the use of specific \ntactics and deployment of various projectiles, chemical weapons and other โless lethalโ weapons. \n148.  At approximately 10:00 p.m., at the Direction of LUCYSHYN and other RPD \nprotest policymakers, RPD officers began indiscriminately firing pepper balls and pepper spray \nat the peaceful protesters. Shortly thereafter, Defendants POTUCK, CLINKHAMMER, and \nother officers assigned to the RPDโs Mobile Field Force indiscriminately assaulted protesters \nclosest to the barricades with pepper spray.  \n \n \n149.  At approximately 10:15 p.m., DEARCOP ordered Defendants and other John Doe \npolice officers to use force to clear protesters from the area where the barricades were erected in \nfront of the PSB near the flagpoles. RPD officers suddenly began violently using their batons \nagainst protestersโstriking and shoving them with unjustified, unnecessary force. \n150.  At approximately 11:15 p.m., MFF and other RPD officers were suddenly ordered \ninside the PSB. There, upon information and belief, they were given instructions by senior RPD \ncommand staff, including SINGLETARY, to forcibly โretake the loopโ and push protesters back \n42 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 43 of 156\n \nto the street. On these orders, RPD officers, including MFF Sergeant POTUCK, came out of the \nPSB, rushed toward the peaceful crowd, and began indiscriminately shooting pepper balls at \ndemonstrators. Many shots were fired at head level. RPD officers also launched multiple tear gas \ncannisters into the crowd indiscriminately.  \n151.   One of the pepper balls hit Democrat & Chronicle photographer Tina MacIntyre-\nYee in the head as she was video recording.  The video of that incident, incorporated herein, is \navailable at https://tinyurl.com/2hy52d5d. \n152.  RPD officers also once again used excessive force to arrest individuals who were \nnot committing any crime but rather lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights. RPD, \nDefendant โRichard Roeโ Sheriffโs Deputies and other law enforcement used their batons and \nphysical force to push the peaceful protesters across the street into a parking lot. Eventually, the \nlegion of RPD officers, MSCO deputies, and NYS Troopers separated the protesters into two \ngroups and used their batons to push the first group south on Exchange Street towards Corn Hill. \nRPD officers chased the second group towards the Court Street Bridge. \n153.  Eventually, Defendant John Doe RPD officers and Richard Roe Sheriffโs deputies \nbegan shooting the peaceful protesters in the face and body with pepper balls. Many protesters \nsustained serious injuries including being shot in the face, neck, and upper body from close range \nunder circumstances where officers were clearly aiming at those areas. One young man was shot \nin the eye with a pepper ball from close range; on information and belief, he is now permanently \nblind in that eye. RPD officers and sheriffโs deputies also shot intentionally at volunteer street \nmedicsโwearing helmets and jackets with large red crosses prominently identifying them as \nmedicsโwho rushed to aid the young man and others injured by the assault.  \n43 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 44 of 156\n \n154.  The second group of protesters that RPD officers chased away from the PSB were \npushed into a parking lot and towards the Court Street Bridge. There, Jamia McCuller, a Black \nwoman, was lawfully video recording RPD officer Amber Grosch assaulting another protester \nwhen, without warning, RPD Sergeant Michael Collins, RPD Officer Justin Whitmore, and \nseveral Defendant MSCO โRichard Roeโ Sheriffโs Deputies chased Ms. McCuller, tackled her to \nthe ground, placed a knee on her neck, and violently arrested her. A portion of that incident can \nbe viewed here: https://twitter.com/i/status/1302235538649427968. In the video, Ms. McCuller \ncan be heard exclaiming, โI canโt breatheโ as officers pin her to the ground.  \n155.  Plaintiff REYNALDO DEGUZMAN, a photojournalist, attempted to film the \npolice assaulting Ms. McCuller but a supervising officer ordered other RPD officers to \nphysically block DEGUZMAN from recording the event. After Ms. McCuller was taken into \ncustody, as DEGUZMAN walked away, an officer said: โA media badge isnโt a free pass.โ That \nofficer then shot DEGUZMAN in the neck with a pepper ball from approximately five feet away.  \n156.  Mr. DEGUZMAN was shot in the neck pursuant to the RPDโs policy of \nretaliating against individuals who exercise their first amendment right to video record police \nofficers performing their duties in public places.  \n44 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 45 of 156\n \n \n(Plaintiff Deguzmanโs injuries after being shot at close range) \n157.  Plaintiff DEVORAH CHATMAN also tried to record Ms. McCuller being held \non the ground by RPD officers. While doing so, CHATMAN was shot approximately six times \nwith pepper balls from close range by Defendant โJohn Doeโ RPD officers, Defendant โRichard \nRoeโ Sheriffโs Deputies, and NYS Troopers, including Defendant Trooper STEPHEN \nDELLASALA. Two of the shots hit CHATMAN in her left shoulder, causing her to lose feeling \nin her arm.  \n158.  While street medics attended to CHATMANโs injuries, she informed the officers \nthat she was an army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan to defend the First Amendment \nfreedoms that police were violently suppressing. As she was speaking, several officers, including \nDELLASALA, suddenly rushed at her, forcibly seized her, grabbed her phone and threw it to the \nground. They placed handcuffs upon her wrists and arrested her. CHATMAN was falsely \ncharged with disorderly conduct; the charges were dismissed on November 4, 2020. \n45 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 46 of 156\n \n159.  At no time did CHATMAN interfere with the arrest of Jamia McCuller, and \nDELLASALA and the John Doeโ RPD officers and the โRichard Roeโ Sheriffโs Deputies lacked \nreasonable or probable cause to arrest her and charge her with Disorderly Conduct or any other \ncrime.  \n160.  DELLASALA, the โJohn Doeโ RPD officers and the โRichard Roeโ Sheriffโs \nDeputies lacked a lawful basis to use any force against CHATMAN, as she did not pose a threat \nto the officers and they lacked reasonable or probable cause to arrest her.  \n161.  DELLASALA, the โJohn Doeโ RPD officers and the โRichard Roeโ Sheriffโs \nDeputies arrested and used force against CHATMAN in retaliation for her filming officers \nviolently arrest Ms. McCuller.  \n162.  Other named plaintiffs were subjected to unconstitutional force by Defendant \nJohn Doe RPD Officers and Richard Roe Sheriffโs Deputies on the night of September 3-4 as \nwell: \na.  Anthony Hall: at approximately 10:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., Mr. Hall was pepper \nsprayed from close range by officers in front of the PSB. Thereafter, law \nenforcement officers then pushed Mr. Hall with a baton in his chest and \nphysically forced him and others to the area of the Court Street Bridge to prevent \nthem from protesting.  \nb.  Stanley Martin: at approximately 10:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m., Mx. Martin was shot \nwith numerous pepper balls and subjected to other chemical weapons in the \nvicinity of the front of PSB, in front of the barricades. At approximately 12:30 \na.m. to 1:00 a.m., as Mx. Martin was attempting to leave the area, police assaulted \nand attempted batter Mx. Martin by chasing them and attempting to hit them as \n46 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 47 of 156\n \nthey were entering a car; and then after Mx. Martin and others entered the car, \nofficers hit the carโs windows with a baton in an attempt to break the windows. \nc.  Emily McIntyre: at approximately 10:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m., Ms. McIntyre was \nstruck with a baton by an officer in the vicinity of the parking lot across the street \nfrom PSB, and subjected to chemicals from pepper balls and pepper spray. \nThereafter, on Sept. 4 at approximately 12:30 a.m. to 1:00 a.m., Client was shot in \nthe legs with pepper balls in the vicinity of Exchange Blvd and Fitzhugh Street; \nand was struck with a baton by an officer in the chest / neck area, and pushed into \na yellow concrete pole underneath the Center City Bridge. \nNicholas Robertson: at approximately 10:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m., Professor \nRobertson was pepper sprayed and subjected to chemicals from pepper balls in \nthe vicinity of the front of the PSB. Thereafter, on Sept. 4 at approximately 12:30 \na.m. to 1:00 a.m., Professor Robertson was subjected to chemicals from pepper \nballs in the vicinity of the the Center City Bridge. \n163.  The Defendant John Doe RPD officers and Richard Roe Sheriffโs Deputies lacked \na lawful justification to force against any of the named plaintiffs or other protesters, as described \nabove. Pursuant to policy, Defendants used types of force, such as by deploying pepper spray \nand indiscriminately shooting pepper balls into the crowd, that they knew, or should have \nknown, would impact numerous people at one time, and/or cause lasting pain, suffering, and/or \ninjury, without making individualized or otherwise appropriate determinations about whether \nthose uses of force were necessary, justified, or reasonable under the circumstances. \n164.  Many Defendant John Doe RPD officers and Richard Roe Sheriffโs Deputies \nengaging in the use of force against Plaintiffs and other protesters covered both their nametags \n47 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 48 of 156\n \nand their badge IDsโmaking it difficult, if not impossible, for affected citizens to identify those \nofficers who violated their rights. On information and belief, RPD officers and Sheriffโs \nDeputies had no legitimate reason to cover both their name tags and their badge IDs in \nresponding to protesters. By encouraging or allowing officers to do so, the City and Department, \nin line with longstanding practice, insulated individual officers from accountability, criticism, or \nconsequence for their role in the unlawful response to the protests.  \nFriday, September 4, 2020 to Saturday 5, 2020 \n165.  On September 4, RPD officers used the Court Street bridge to โkettleโ protesters, \nspray them with tear gas, and attack them with pepper balls โ a scene tragically reminiscent of \nthe 1965 โBloody Sundayโ attack on civil rights demonstrators on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in \nSelma, Alabama. Videos from that night show heavily armored phalanxes of police using pepper \nballs, 40mm kinetic bullets, tear gas, and batons to assault diverse groups of protesters outfitted \nonly with umbrellas, cardboard boxes, and plastic childrenโs sleds against the RPDโs military-\ngrade arsenal but who nevertheless assembled to protest for racial justice and reformed policing.  \n \n48 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 49 of 156\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n166.  The CITY and the RPD, by and through the RPD protest policymakers, \ncoordinated with BAXTER, the COUNTY and MCSO to direct and supervise the multi-agency \nlaw enforcement response. \n167.  On that night, the CITY deployed at least one surveillance drone to fly over the \nprotesters, which transmitted video footage back to the RPD Command Post. Upon information \nand belief, SINGLETARY and FAVOR watched the video in real time from the RPD Command \nPost, from which they directed the multi-agency response to the protest, including the use of \nspecific tactics and weapons.  \n168.  On that night, upon information and belief, BAXTER, the COUNTY and MCSO \ndeployed one or more surveillance drones to fly over the protesters, which transmitted video \nfootage back to the COUNTY/MCSO and RPD Command Posts.  \n169.  Using the video footage, upon information and belief, Defendants SINGLETARY \nand FAVOR coordinated with BAXTER and other commanding officers of the MCSO and \n49 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 50 of 156\n \nCOUNTY to direct the John Doe and Richard Roe defendantsโ response to protesters on the \nground, including the use of specific tactics and weapons. \n170.  RPD officers first escorted peaceful protesters along Court Street from Martin \nLuther King Jr. Memorial Park towards the PSB, and directed them onto the Court Street Bridge. \nBut when protesters reached the other side, law enforcement stopped them with metal barricades. \n171.  After thousands of protesters had marched onto the bridge and had nowhere to go, \nthe police ordered the protesters to โdisperse.โ However, the dispersal orders were not clearly \ncommunicated, and the protesters towards the back of the bridge near South Avenue could not \nhear the dispersal orders. Moreover, there was nowhere for the protesters in the front near the \npolice barricades to go. \n \n \n \n50 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 51 of 156\n \n \n172.  Suddenly, without giving the protesters the time or opportunity to disperseโand \nknowing it was physically impossible for them to comply with the dispersal ordersโlaw \nenforcement officers began violently attacking protesters. In fact, the John Doe RPD Officers \nbegan indiscriminately firing pepper balls into the crowd less than 30 seconds after the first \nโdispersalโ order was issued at approximately 10:43 p.m. \n173.  At the direction of RPD Grenadier Team Leader SAMUEL LUCYSHYN, RPD \nofficers indiscriminately shot pepper balls and tear gas into the crowd. Video available at: \nhttps://twitter.com/i/status/1302075393428590592. On the video, officers can be heard giving \nthe order to disperse while pepper balls are being shot.  \n174.  The order to fire was given by RPD command staff at approximately 10:43 p.m. \nBy 11:00 p.m., RPD officers had fired hundreds of pepper balls at the penned-in crowd. One \nRPD officer fired at least 148 pepper balls in that time, another fired well over 120. At least 16 \nRPD officers shot peppers balls at protesters trapped on the Court Street Bridge.   \n175.  Plaintiff NICHOLAS ROBERTSON, a Black man and criminal justice professor \nat Rochester Institute of Technology, was one of many individuals struck in the head by pepper \n51 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 52 of 156\n \nballs shot at protesters trapped on the Bridge. He suffered a laceration and permanent scarring. \nROBERTSON was also shot with pepper balls numerous times in his body and legs.  \n176.  Edward Fitzgerald was shot in the forehead with a pepper ball. After officers \nrushed through the barricade, an officer ripped Mr. Fitzgeraldโs umbrella from his hand and shot \nhim directly in the face with a pepper ball, causing a large laceration and permanent scarring: \n177.  After spraying the crowd with tear gas and pepper balls, officers then rushed at \nprotesters, violently wielding batons and using physical force to push and shove them. RPD \nofficers also baselessly arrested peaceful protesters for allegedly failing to comply with the \ndispersal order and โunlawful assembly.โ \n52 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 53 of 156\n \n \n178.  For example, RPD officers arrested Christopher Hildebrandt, a paraplegic \nwheelchair user who is the Chief Operating Officer of the Center for Disability Rights. When the \npolice rushed towards the crowd, they crashed into Mr. Hildebrandt, knocked over his \nwheelchair and threw him onto the ground. An RPD officer grabbed Mr. Hildebrandt and \ndragged him a dozen or so feet before officers handcuffed him and placed him back into his \nwheelchair. Officers then wheeled Mr. Hildebrandt to the PSB and told him he had been arrested \nfor disorderly conduct and unlawful assembly; however, after being detained for hours, Mr. \nHildebrandt was released without charges.  \n179.  At a subsequent briefing to City Council, Defendants SINGLETARY and \nFAVOR stated that the decision to position officers at the end of the bridge was part of the \nDepartmentโs โoverall operational plan to not allow access points to the PSB,โ even though on \nboth earlier and subsequent nights the Department allowed such access.   \n180.  When questioned about the decision to use force on peaceful protesters trapped on \nthe bridge, the Chief said that was a decision ultimately made by the Command Post. \n53 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 54 of 156\n \nSINGLETARY and other RPD officials have stood by this decision despite RPD officersโ clearly \nexcessive use of force and the countless physical injuries sustained by peaceful protesters. \n181.  The police assault was not over: even after protesters were allowed off the bridge, \nRPD officers continued to shoot pepper balls at them and pushed them past Dinosaur BBQ, and \nacross South Avenue. Video available at: https://twitter.com/i/status/1302086982940717056. \nRetreating protesters can be seen using signs and umbrellas to shield themselves from the \npursuing officers who are firing pepper balls at them indiscriminately. RPD officers also attacked \nprotesters with tear gas and other chemical weapons throughout the night.  \n182.  RPD officers targeted NLG Rochester Legal Observers, who were wearing bright \ngreen โNLGโ hats that clearly indicated they were Legal Observers. One NLG Legal Observer, \nPlaintiff EMILY GOOD, was shot with pepper balls and exposed to tear gas. Shortly after \nmidnight, GOOD was standing alone near the entrance to the Court Street Parking Garage, \nstruggling to take notes in her notepad, when she was targeted and shot in the hand with a pepper \nball. Ms. Good was wearing a clearly identifiable neon NLG hat at the time she was shot. \nOfficers also targeted photographers and other members of the media.  \n183.  In addition to the RPDโs indiscriminate use of tear gas, pepper spray, and pepper \nballs that night, RPD officers also employed excessive force by shooting peaceful protesters with \n40mm direct-impact rounds and firing smoke and tear gas canisters from grenade launchers.  \n184.  Other named plaintiffs were subjected to unconstitutional force by Defendant \nJohn Doe RPD Officers and Richard Roe Sheriffโs Deputies on the night of September 4-5 as \nwell: \na.  Devorah Chatman: at approximately 10:30 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., Ms. Chatman was \npresent on the Court Street Bridge, peacefully protesting, when she was attacked \n54 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 55 of 156\n \nwith various chemical weapons, including being sprayed with tear gas and \nsubjected to large amounts of chemicals from pepper balls. \nb.  Reynaldo DeGuzman: throughout the night, Mr. DeGuzman was acting in his \ncapacity as a professional photojournalist, when he was targeted and attacked in \nretaliation for documenting the law enforcement response to peaceful protests. At \napproximately 10:15 p.m.: Mr. DeGuzman was present on the Court Street Bridge \nwhen law enforcement officers targeted him and shot his camera equipment \nnumerous times  with pepper, disabling his camera equipment for the night, and \npreventing him from documenting the law enforcement response to the peaceful \nprotests. At approx-imately 10:46 p.m., on the Court Street Bridge, Mr. \nDeGuzman was shot with a pepper ball in the right arm. At approximately 12:05 \na.m., Mr. DeGuzman was targeted and attacked with large amount of tear gas in \nthe vicinity of the intersection of Court Street and Chester, causing him collapse \nand vomit violently.  \nc.  Anthony Hall: at approximately 10:30 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., Mr. Hall was present \non the Court Street Bridge, when he was shot multiple times with pepper bells in \nthe back and hip. Thereafter, between approximately 11:30 p.m. and 1:00 a.m., \nMr. Hall was shot numerous times with pepper balls while present on Court Street \nbetween South Avenue and MLK Park.  \nd.  Stanley Martin: at approximately 10:30 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., Mx. Martin was \npresent on the Court Street Bridge, when they were shot in the legs and body \nmultiple times with pepper balls. Thereafter, at approximately 12:30 a.m. to 1:00 \na.m., in the vicinity of Chestnut Street on the side of the Court Street parking \n55 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 56 of 156\n \ngarage, Mx. Martin was targeted and shot over a dozen times with pepper balls, \ncausing Mx. Martin to collapse to the ground in pain. Thereafter, at approximately \n1:30 a.m., police chased Mx. Martin and others through MLK park and attacked \nthem with large amounts of tear gas. \ne.  Emily McIntyre: at approximately 10:30 โ 11:00 p.m. on the Court Street Bridge, \nin the front line of protesters, Ms. McIntyre was shot with numerous pepper balls \nin the legs and feet. Thereafter, on Court street in the vicinity of the Court Street \nParking Garage underneath the walking bridge, Ms. McIntyre was shot \napproximately 10 times in the body, arms, hips and legs with pepper balls, and \nwas subjected to large amounts of tear gas \nf.  Nicholas Robertson: at approximately 10:30 โ 11:00 p.m. on the Court Street \nBridge, Professor Robertson was shot in the forehead with a pepper ball, causing \na laceration and scarring; he was shot by a Defendant John Doe RPD Officer or a \nDefendant Richard Roe Sheriffโs Deputy. Professor Robertson was also shot with \npepper balls in the body and legs, and subjected to large amounts of chemical \nweapons. Thereafter, on Court street in the vicinity of the Court Street Parking \nGarage and the walking bridge, Professor Robertson was subjected to large \namounts of tear gas.  \n185.  The Defendant John Doe RPD officers and Richard Roe Sheriffโs Deputies lacked \na lawful justification to force against any of the named plaintiffs or other protesters, as described \nabove. Pursuant to policy, Defendants used types of force, such as by deploying pepper spray \nand indiscriminately shooting pepper balls into the crowd, that they knew, or should have \nknown, would impact numerous people at one time, and/or cause lasting pain, suffering, and/or \n56 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 57 of 156\n \ninjury, without making individualized or otherwise appropriate determinations about whether \nthose uses of force were necessary, justified, or reasonable under the circumstances. \nSaturday, September 5 to Sunday, September 6, 2020 \n186.  On Saturday night, police violence peaked against people who had gathered to \nprotest the RPDโs racialized violence and support the sanctity of Black lives.  \n187.  Similar to the previous night, peaceful protesters marched from MLK Park \ntowards the PSB. But during the march, protesters were met with an overwhelming presence of \nRPD officers, Sheriffโs deputies and State Police in full riot gear with military grade weaponsโ\nincluding a bearcat tankโand police dogs.   \n \n \n188.  Similar to the previous night, the CITY and the RPD, by and through the RPD \nprotest policymakers, coordinated with BAXTER and other COUNTY and MCSO policymakers \nto direct and supervise the multi-agency law enforcement response. \n57 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 58 of 156\n \n189.  On that night, the CITY deployed at least one surveillance drone to fly over the \nprotesters, which transmitted video footage back to the RPD Command Post. Upon information \nand belief, SINGLETARY and FAVOR watched the video in real time from the RPD Command \nPost, from which they directed the multi-agency response to the protest, including the use of \nspecific tactics and weapons.  \n190.  On that night, upon information and belief, BAXTER, the COUNTY and MCSO \ndeployed one or more surveillance drones to fly over the protesters, which transmitted video \nfootage back to the COUNTY/MCSO and RPD Command Posts.  \n191.  Using the video footage, upon information and belief, Defendants SINGLETARY \nand FAVOR coordinated with BAXTER and other commanding officers of the MCSO and \n \nCOUNTY to direct the John Doe and Richard Roe defendantsโ response to protesters on the \nground, including the use of specific tactics and weapons.  \n192.  As videos of the law enforcement response on that night demonstrate, the John \nDoe RPD offiers and Richard Roe Sheriffโs Deputies, along with other law enforcement officers, \nunleashed a torrent of violence on the peaceful protestersโcausing many protesters serious \ninjury. One such video, incorporated herein, can be seen here: https://tinyurl.com/vra3x4j7.  \n58 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 59 of 156\n \n \n \n \nFigure 1 (NY State Troopers with police dog) \n \n193.  One protester who was seriously injured was Monroe County Legislator Rachel \nBarnhart. Ms. Barnhart and several other elected officialsโincluding City Council Members \nMary Lupien and Mitch Gruberโhad joined the demonstrations and positioned themselves at the \nโfront lineโ where they were clearly visible to police, believing the RPD would not use the same \nlevel of indiscriminate excessive force against elected officials engaged in peaceful protest. \n194.  While on that front line, Lupien was also texting Mayor WARREN asking her to \nensure that law enforcement did not escalate or use violence against the people.     \n59 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 60 of 156\n \n \n \n195.  But several minutes after the march was stopped by police at the intersection of \nBroad Street and Exchange Boulevard, RPD officers began to launch flash bang grenades, \nrelease tear gas, and shoot pepper balls into the crowd indiscriminately.  \n \n \n196.  One of those pepper balls struck Ms. Barnhart in the head, causing her to sustain a \nconcussion, as well as irritation to her skin, eyes, mouth, nose, and lungs.   \n60 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 61 of 156\n \n \n \n197.  Rochester City Council Member Mitch Gruber was standing next to Ms. Barnhart \nand was shot in both the thigh and the shoulder with a projectile.  \n198.  Several pepper balls hit ANTHONY HALL in the body, and one hit him in the \nface causing a large welt.  \n199.  Defendant POTUCK and other RPD MFF officers and Grenadier Team then \nadvanced towards protesters while deploying chemical weapons. POTUCK indiscriminately \n61 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 62 of 156\n \ndeployed tear gas at the protesters using a โfoggerโ and launched multiple tear gas cannisters into \ngroups who were protecting themselves with makeshift shields and umbrellas.  \n \n \n200.  Former Irondequoit Councilwoman Nicole Hushla Re was standing apart from the \ncrowd, livestreaming the events when she was suddenly, and without warning, struck in the face \n62 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 63 of 156\n \nby a tear gas cannister. Once hit, she describes blood flying everywhere and being unable to see \nanything due to the cloud of smoke. \n \n201.  Ms. Hushla Re sustained facial fractures and her upper lip required numerous \nstitches, both inside and outside of her lip. Her face has permanent scarring: \n202.  While Ms. Hushla Re was being treated at Strong Memorial Hospital, another \nprotester was also getting stitched up after having been hit in the head with a pepper ball. \n203.  Members of RPDโs Grenadier Team also launched numerous Flash Bang \nGrenades at protesters that night. After several minutes of deploying chemical weapons, the \npolice suddenly and without warning ran full speed towards the crowd at the intersection of \nExchange Boulevard and Main Street, pushed them and struck them with batons: \n63 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 64 of 156\n \n \n \n204.  Another group of protesters, including Plaintiff LORE MCSPADDEN-WALKER \n(they/them), dispersed towards City Hall. On the sidewalk in the vicinity of Church and Fitzhugh \nStreets, MCSPADDEN-WALKER and other protesters encountered a group of police who \nstopped them. The police then rushed towards the protesters, as documented here: \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ydska5st.  \n205.  When a police officer charged MCSPADDEN-WALKER, they had their hands in \nthe air. An officer violently seized MCSPADDEN-WALKER and threw them to the ground, \ncausing them to fall onto their knees. The officer then slammed MCSPADDEN-WALKERโs \nshoulder into the ground, told them they were under arrest, and placed handcuffs on their wrists. \nThe officer then pulled MCSPADDEN-WALKER to their feet and began escorting them to a \npolice vehicle. When MCSPADDEN-WALKER informed the officer their driverโs license listed \ntheir gender as โfemale,โ the officer laughed and made fun of them for their gender identity. \n64 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 65 of 156\n \n206.  Another large group of injured protesters sought refuge from the police inside of \nSpiritus Christi church. Police surrounded the church and shot hundreds of rounds of pepper \nballs at the building, splattering its walls with chemical irritants. RPD Officer Dylan Minnick, \nfor example, fired pepper balls at individuals who had taken shelter in the churchโs alcove.    \n207.  One protester who sought refuge in the church was Jaeylon Johnson. Mr. Johnson \nwas riding his bicycle on State Street near the intersection with Church Street when police shot \nhim in the neck several times with pepper balls. The pepper balls exploded at the base of Mr. \nJohnsonโs gas mask, causing all the chemicals to go directly into his mask, which he inhaled. As \na result, Mr. Johnson passed out, fell to the ground, and had a seizure (for the first time in his \nlife). Other protesters then came to Mr. Johnsonโs aid and escorted him to Spiritus Christi. While \nhe was inside the church, Mr. Johnson had a second seizure.  \n208.  Inside the church, a young girl who was shot in the kneeโapparently by a direct-\nimpact projectileโcould barely walk. Another woman was having seizures from exposure, and \npeople were lined up outside the bathrooms to rinse off tear gas and pepper spray residue. Many \npeople had bruises, welts, and bleeding sores where they had been hit by police projectiles. \n209.  Other named plaintiffs were subjected to unconstitutional force by Defendant \nJohn Doe RPD Officers and Richard Roe Sheriffโs Deputies on the night of September 5-6 as \nwell: \na.

At approximately \n11:29 p.m., Mr. DeGuzman was shot in left rib cage with a 40mm KIPS \nprojectile, and again at approximately 11:51 p.m., Mr. DeGuzman was shot by a \n40mm KIPS projectile in the right thigh. \nc.  Emily Good: while volunteering as an NLG LO, and wearing a bright green \nโNLGโ hat that clearly indicated she was a legal observer, between approximately \n10:00 p.m. โ 12:30 a.m., Ms. Good was targeted and attacked with various \nchemical weapons at various locations in downtown Rochester. First, at \napproximately 10:40 p.m., in the vicinity of the intersection of Broad Street and \nExchange Blvd., Ms. Good was sprayed with a large amount of tear gas. Then at \napproximately 11:30 p.m., on Main Street, in the vicinity of the Rochester \nRiverside Hotel, Ms. Good was again attacked with a large amount of tear gas.  \nd.  Stanley Martin: at approximately 10:25 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., while in the vicinity of \nthe intersection of Broad Street and Exchange Blvd, Mx. Martin was shot \nnumerous times in the legs with pepper balls, and was attacked with tear gas and \nother chemical weapons. Thereafter, Mx. Martin was trapped by law enforcement  \ninside of Spiritus Christie church when officers surrounded the church and \nterrorized its occupants by shooting hundreds of  pepper balls at the church, \nmarching around the church in military formation, and destroying the water and \nmilk provisions outside the church. \n66 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 67 of 156\n \ne.  Emily McIntyre: at approximately 10:25 p.m. โ 11:00 p.m., Ms. McIntyre was \nsubjected to large amounts of tear gas, the LRAD, flash bangs, police dogs, and \nother chemical weapons in the vicinity of the intersection of Broad Street and \nExchange Blvd. Ms. McIntyre was also shot numerous times with pepper balls. \nThereafter, at approximately 12:00 a.m., an officer charged at Ms. McIntyre and \nripped her shield from her arm. Thereafter, while inside of Spiritus Christie \nChurch, Ms. McIntyre and others were terrorized by police who shot the church \nwith pepper balls, marched around the church in military formation, and \ndestroyed the water and milk provisions outside the church. \nf.  Professor Nicholas Robertson: in the vicinity of the intersection of Broad Street \nand Exchange Blvd., at approximately 10:25 p.m. โ 11:00 p.m., Professor \nRobertson was sprayed with a large amount of tear gas, and was subjected to the \nLRAD, flash bangs, and barking dogs.  \n210.  The Defendant John Doe RPD officers and Richard Roe Sheriffโs Deputies lacked \na lawful justification to force against any of the named plaintiffs or other protesters, as described \nabove. Pursuant to policy, Defendants used types of force, such as by deploying pepper spray \nand indiscriminately shooting pepper balls into the crowd, that they knew, or should have \nknown, would impact numerous people at one time, and/or cause lasting pain, suffering, and/or \ninjury, without making individualized or otherwise appropriate determinations about whether \nthose uses of force were necessary, justified, or reasonable under the circumstances. \n211.  RPD Officials, including then-Chief SINGLETARY, have defended the RPDโs \nresponse that night, stating that the RPD โshowed restraintโ and that the tactics used were \nappropriate for the situation. \n67 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 68 of 156\n \n212.   Based on statements by City Officials and RPD command staff to date, no RPD \nofficer has reported any fellow officer for their unlawful use of force and no RPD officers have \nbeen disciplined for their unlawful use of force on September 2, 3, 4 or 5, 2020.  \n213.  Instead, the City has taken steps to ensure that important evidence of officer \nmisconduct during these events was not preserved. Many RPD officers in their reports indicate \nthat their body cameras โfell offโ or โwould not recordโ but state that cameras mounted on the \nPSB and/or bluelight cameras around the city did or should have captured the timing and \ncircumstances of their use-of-force on protesters. On September 14, the City acknowledged \nreceipt of a preservation letter for all such video from the blue-light and PSB camerasโwell \nwithin the 30-day retention period for those recordings. To date, the City has produced less than \n3 minutes of footage from the night of September 4. The City has indicated the rest of the \nfootage was destroyedโdespite the preservation letter and their own retention policies.  \nSaturday, September 12 to Sunday September 13, 2020 \n214.  Protests in support of Black lives and calling for an end to RPDโs racialized \nviolence continued. The night of September 12, 2020, several hundred peaceful protesters \nmarched from the location where Daniel Prude was killed on Jefferson Avenue towards the RPD \nstation on Child Street. RPD officers, Sheriffโs deputies and State Police in riot gear blocked the \nroad at the intersection of Child Street and Wilder Street, where they stopped the protesters. \n \n68 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 69 of 156\n \n \n \n215.  Defendant POTUCK was commanding RPDโs MFF. After stopping the peaceful \nmarch, the police issued dispersal orders but without giving the protesters an opportunity to \ndisperse. Protesters were chanting and exercising their First Amendment rights to decry RPDโs \nracist policing and demand change. Thereafter, in retaliation for what the RPD claimed was \nโanti-police rhetoric,โ POTUCK issued an order for the officers to โmove forward,โ and the \npolice began violently attacking the protesters. First, the police unleashed chemical weapons: \n \n69 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 70 of 156\n \n \n \n216.  Then, the police rushed the protesters and pushed and struck them with batons. \n217.  Other named plaintiffs were subjected to unconstitutional force by Defendant \nJohn Doe RPD Officers and Richard Roe Sheriffโs Deputies on the night of September 12-13 as \nwell: \na.  Reynaldo DeGuzman: while working as a professional photojournalist and \nfilming the law enforcement response to peaceful protesters, Mr. DeGuzman was \ntargeted and shot with a pepper ball in the right shoulder at approximately 10:57 \np.m. \nb.  Anthony Hall: at approximately 11:00 p.m.to 11:30 p.m., in the vicinity of the \nintersection of Child Street and Wilder Street, Mr. Hall was pepper sprayed in the \nface and was hit with a baton multiple times in his back by RPD officers. \nc.  Lore McSpadden-Walker: At approximately 10:00 p.m. to 12:30 a.m., in the \nvicinity of Child Street and Wilder Street, Claimant was pepper sprayed and \nsubjected to other chemical weapons; and subjected to bright lights and the \nLRAD. \nd.  Winona Miller: at approximately 10:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m., while in the vicinity of \nChild Street and Wilder Street, peacefully protesting, Ms. Miller was exposed to \ntear gas, pepper spray and other chemical weapons.   \n218.  The Defendant John Doe RPD officers and Richard Roe Sheriffโs Deputies lacked \na lawful justification to force against any of the named plaintiffs or other protesters, as described \nabove. Pursuant to policy, Defendants used types of force, such as by deploying pepper spray \nand indiscriminately shooting pepper balls into the crowd, that they knew, or should have \n70 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 71 of 156\n \nknown, would impact numerous people at one time, and/or cause lasting pain, suffering, and/or \ninjury, without making individualized or otherwise appropriate determinations about whether \nthose uses of force were necessary, justified, or reasonable under the circumstances. \n219.  On information and belief, no RPD officers have been disciplined for their \nexcessive use of forceโincluding the indiscriminate spraying of chemical weapons into crowds \nof protestersโon September 12-13, 2020. \nWednesday, September 16, 2020 \n220.  The night of September 15, FTP ROC organized a peaceful โsleep-inโ protest in \nfront of City Hall. In the morning, protesters awoke to police issuing dispersal orders. Without \njustification or provocation, police immediately began arresting people. Several of the people \narrested, including Plaintiff MARTIN, were subjected to excessive force.  \n221.  The male police officer who handcuffed and arrested MARTIN was being \naggressive, so MARTIN asked that a female officer search them before they were placed in a \npolice vehicle. The officer refused, and when MARTIN again asked for a female officer to \nperform the search, the male officerโbelieved to be either officer ALEXANDER ELMORE, \nJOHN CLINKHAMMER, or DOMENIC BORELLIโforcefully slammed MARTINโs head into \nthe side of the police vehicle. MARTIN suffered a concussion as a result.  \n222.  Plaintiff WINONA MILLER, a 52-year-old disabled Black woman, was sitting on \na bench across the street from City Hall when several RPD officers, including Defendant \nETHAN PASZKO, surrounded her and ordered her to stand up. MILLER said in response that \nshe was just sitting on the bench. The officers abruptly grabbed MILLER, pulled her to her feet, \nforced her arms behind her back, and applied handcuffs to her wrists in an unreasonably tight \nmanner. When MILLER complained the handcuffs were too tight and requested they be \nloosened, instead of helping her, PASZKO kneed her in the stomach.  \n71 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 72 of 156\n \n223.  MILLER was detained on the street for approximately one hour, during which \ntime she repeatedly asked that her handcuffs be loosened but the RPD officers refused. \nEventually, MILLER was transported to the PSB, where she was detained for approximately four \nhours before she was charged with disorderly conduct, issued an appearance ticket, and released \nfrom custody. The false charges against her were dismissed on October 22, 2020. \n224.   PASZKO and his partner VANBREDERODE were named โOfficers of the \nMonthโ for September 2020. On information and belief, no RPD officers have been disciplined \nfor their excessive force and/or illegal arrests on September 16, 2020.  \nTuesday October 13, 2020 \n225.  On October 13, 2020, after attending a peaceful protest at the Webster Police \nDepartment organized by FTP ROC, Nicholas Wilt was arrested by a Monroe County Sheriffโs \nDeputy. The Deputy claimed there was a bench warrant for Mr. Wilt for missing a court date for \nhis September 12, 2020 arrest (during the protests described above). Mr. Wilt informed the \nDeputy that he had not missed a court appearance because his court date was October 22, 2020โ\nnot September 22, 2020, as the Deputy said. The Deputy still detained Mr. Wilt and transported \nhim to the PSB where the RPD confirmed that Mr. Wiltโs court date was October 22, 2020. \nNevertheless, RPD refused to release Mr. Wilt from custody. \n226.  About 20 protesters arrived at the PSB to ask why Mr. Wilt was detained.  \n227.  Although the protesters were peaceful, an RPD supervisor ordered officers to \nโjust push them.โ Officers suddenly, and without giving the protesters an opportunity to exit the \nbuilding, began pushing protesters with batons towards the front doors, where a bottleneck \noccurred.  \n72 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 73 of 156\n \n228.  Defendant MATTHEW DRAKE was one of the Defendant officers who struck \nprotesters with his baton, including Plaintiff EMILY MCINTYRE, who he repeatedly struck \nwith his baton in the neck, back and body without provocation or justification.  \n229.  Another protester who was caught in the bottleneck was India Maring \n(they/them). They were shoved by officers and thrown to the ground. As a result, Mx. Maringโs \nhead hit the ground with such force that they sustained a concussion.  \n230.  Plaintiff STANLEY MARTIN was also caught in the bottleneck and was shoved \nby one or more John Doe RPD Officers. As a result of being pushed and shoved, Mx. \nMARTINโs left ankleโwhich officers had injured on September 2โwas reinjured. \n231.  On information and belief, no RPD officers have been disciplined for their \nexcessive force and/or illegal arrests on October 13, 2020.  \nCity And RPD Officials, and the County, BAXTER and MCSO Officials Failure to Train \nOn The Proper Handling of First Amendment Assemblies. \n232.  The extensive deprivation of constitutional rights during the 2020 protests is \ndirectly attributable to the CITY and RPDโs disregard of many years of notice, criticism, and \nother relevant data points, both internal and external, related to its unconstitutional policing of \nsimilar protests.  \n233.  Similarly, the BAXTER, the COUNTY and MCSO have deliberately disregarded \nthe fact that peaceful protests and lawful demonstrations have occurred and will continue to \noccur in Monroe County, and instead have defined such lawful First Amendment activities as \nโcivil disturbancesโ that mut be policed in the same manner as โviolent mobsโ or โriots.โ \n234.  Since at least the 2009, the RPD and MCSO has failed to appropriately train its \nofficers on the proper handling of First Amendment assemblies. \n73 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 74 of 156\n \n235.  Upon information and belief, the RPD and MCSOโs core training related to \nprotest response to this day is based on crowd management and disorder control tactics for \npolicing large-scale civil disorder and riots. \n236.  According to the CITYโs website, the RPDโs Mobile Field Force (MFF) is a \nโspecially trained and equipped team providing a rapid, organized and disciplined response to \ncivil disorder [and] crowd control.โ  \n237.  The MFF was the RPDโs primary unit tasked with policing the peaceful protests \nin the wake of George Floyd and Daniel Prude in May and September 2020, respectively.  \n238.  Upon information and belief, the MFFโs training and guidelines treat โdisordersโ \nas military engagements and copies military tactics and focus on tactics designed to deter, \ndisperse, and demoralize groups, such as disorder control formations and mass use of chemical \nweapons.  \n239.  As seen elsewhere herein, such disperse and demoralize tactics have persisted \nthrough the present as exemplified by the experiences of the Named Plaintiffs and Second \nPlaintiffโs Class (defined below). \n240.  Upon information and belief, the MFFโs โcivil disorderโ training and guidelines \nwere never meant to be guidelines for the policing of lawful First Amendment assemblies such \nas demonstrationsโonly for large-scale civil disorder such as riots. \n241.  However, neither the MFFโs โcivil disorderโ training and guidelines, nor, upon \ninformation and belief, any related RPD training, contain meaningful direction on the core First, \nFourth, or Fourteenth Amendment principles that must guide constitutional policing of First \nAmendment assemblies. \n74 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 75 of 156\n \n242.  For example, upon information and belief, there is virtually no RPD trainingโ\nand certainly no meaningful RPD trainingโfocusing on how to utilize the tactics described in \nthe MFFโs โcivil disorderโ training and guidelines without infringing on the constitutional rights \nof protesters, such as how to make probable cause determinations or the requirements of \nproviding an alternative avenue of protest, meaningful time and a path of egress when issuing a \ndispersal order, and the like. \n243.  Many MFF members, including many of those deployed to the protests in 2020 \nthat are the subject of this lawsuit, have histories of engaging in the kinds of misconduct \ncomplained of herein, among other places, by CRB complaints, PSS investigations and in \nlawsuits. \n244.  Examples of the RPDโs unreasonable and discriminatory use of force at prior \nlawful protests include: \na.  In October 2009, an anti-war protest in Rochester resulted in several physical \nconfrontations, with two protesters receiving stitches at the hospital after RPD officers \npushed them face-first to the ground, and 12 protesters arrested for exercising their First \nAmendment rights. The peaceful march, held in the early evening, was interrupted by \napproximately forty RPD vehicles. Within three minutes of giving the order to disperse, \nRPD officers began to shove and hit protesters with clubs and deploy pepper spray. \nProtesters described RPD officers wading through the crowd to pick out Black students \nto arrest. A press videographer who was filming one such arrest was wrestled to the \nground by police and himself arrested.  \nb.  In May 2015, Katrina Perkins was protesting police brutality on a public street in a \nresidential neighborhood, where two of her daughters and six of her grandchildren \n75 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 76 of 156\n \nreside. Though Ms. Perkins was peacefully demonstrating, RPD officers violently seized \nand arrested her and then charged her with disorderly conduct and disruption. Those \ncharges were dismissed two months later. Police brutality is a deeply personal issue to \nMs. Perkins, as her daughter Lashedica was the 13-year-old shot three times by former-\nDeputy Chief Simmons in 2005.  \nc.  In July 2016, in Rochester as across the nation, people took to the streets to uphold the \nsanctity of Black lives and call for an end to racist policing. In response, the RPD \ndeployed, beat, shoved, and pepper sprayed protesters. As one described it: โI started to \nturn and they tackled me to the ground.โฆTheyโre beating citizens for no reason \nwhatsoever. I wasnโt doing anything. I was taking pictures.โ RPD officers, in keeping \nwith their pattern and practice, particularly targeted Black protesters with unlawful \nforce, including Black journalists: Carlet Cleare and Justin Carter of WHAM-TV were \nboth handcuffed and detained, even though Ms. Cleare was wearing a WHAM-TV shirt \nand they identified themselves as members of the press. Over the course of one \nweekend, Rochester had more arrests at its BLM protest (74) than the rest of the nation \ncombined. \n245.  Despite the wealth of evidence of RPD membersโ historical brutality against \nprotesters, Defendant City has ignored, and/or failed to utilize, relevant information, including \ninformation gleaned from reports and lawsuits, as well as other data points, to identify \ndeficiencies in RPD training as it relates to constitutionally compliant protest policing. \n246.  In fact, following the 2016 protest, the RPD and Mayor Lovely Warrenโs office \nstated the police handled themselves appropriately.  \n76 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 77 of 156\n \n247.  When questioned by public officials, SINGLETARY stated that he did not review \nthe RPDโs actions at the 2016 protest in developing the RPDโs strategy for responding to protests \nin 2020.  \n248.  In summary, upon information and belief, the RPDโs exclusive focus on deterring, \ndispersing, and demoralizing in trainings related to policing protests, coupled with the failure to \ntrain on specific, relevant aspects of constitutional policing of protests, let alone how to \nencourage or facilitate protestsโdespite having received clear notice that RPD policing of \nprotests has caused the systemic violations of protestersโ constitutional rights for yearsโ \ndemonstrates both a history, and a policy, of disregard for the First Amendment, Fourth \nAmendment, Fourteenth Amendment, and other, related rights of Plaintiffs and other similarly \ninjured protesters. \n249.  Similarly, prior to 2020, BAXTER, the COUNTY and the MCSO received clear \nnotice that peaceful demonstrations have occurred and will continue to occur in Monroe County, \nand that without proper training, Deputy Sheriffs would violate individualsโ constitutional rights \nand endanger the life and safety of protesters.  \n250.  Nevertheless, BAXTER, the COUNTY and the MCSO, upon information and \nbelief, took no steps to train its Sheriffโs Deputies on lawfully policing and encouraging protests \nand other First Amendment activities.  \n251.  Instead, COUNTY policy explicitly defines a โcivil disturbanceโ as โpeaceful \ndemonstrations or acts of violence.โ Thus, COUNTY policy explicitly conflates peaceful protests \nwith violent riots.  \n252.  Upon information and belief, BAXTER, the COUNTY and the MCSO do not \nprovide any training to Sheriffโs Deputies on drawing a meaningful distinction between \n77 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 78 of 156\n \nโpeaceful demonstrationsโ and โviolent mobsโ. For example, in its โHazard Mitigation Plan,โ the \nCounty states that, โMany civil unrest incidents are spontaneous and can occur at any time, \nrendering prediction of probability of future occurrences difficult. When these incidents occur, \nthey can become extremely disruptive and difficult to control. Assumedly, civil unrest incidents \nincluding marches, protests, demonstrations, and gatherings will continue to occur throughout \nMonroe County.โ \n253.  The Hazard Mitigation Plan was in full force and effect throughout 2020 and at all \ntimes relevant to this complaint.  \n254.  According to COUNTY policy, peaceful demonstrates are discouraged because of \nthe perceived negative impacts on property resources, real estate and the economy; again, this is \na result of the BAXTER, the COUNTY and the MCSO falsely conflating โpeaceful \ndemonstrationsโ with โacts of violence.โ \n255.  Upon information and belief, BAXTER, the COUNTY and the MCSO do not \nprovide any training to Sheriffโs Deputies on how to encourage and support individuals engaging \nin โpeaceful demonstrationsโ to ensure that their constitutional rights are not inhibited by law \nenforcement.   \n256.  Upon information and belief, BAXTER, the COUNTY and the MCSO do not \nprovide any training to Sheriffโs Deputies on making a meaningful distinction between how \nSheriffโs Deputies are trained and instructed on policing โpeaceful demonstrationsโ versus \nโviolent mobsโ.  \n257.  Instead, County policy states that, โ[m]any protests intended to be peaceful \ndemonstrations to the public and the government can escalate into general chaos.โ Thus, upon \n78 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 79 of 156\n \ninformation and belief, BAXTER, the COUNTY and the MCSO train their Sheriffโs Deputies to \npolice peaceful demonstrations in the same manner as they would a violent mob.  \n258.  Like the RPD, upon information and belief, BAXTER, the COUNTY and the \nMCSO train Sheriffโs Deputies exclusively on deterring, dispersing, and demoralizing protests \nand peaceful demonstrations.  \n259.  In June 2020, several Monroe County Legislators called on BAXTER to \nimplement new protest training to ensure the safety of protesers at Black Lives Matter \ndemonstrations. The legislators drafted a letter to County Executive Adam Bello and BAXTER \nin which they made a number of requests related to public safety and the safety of protesters, and \nclosed by stating, โOnce again, we believe the safety of both protesters, motorists, and law \nenforcement is of the utmost importance. Right here in Monroe County and across the Nation, \nwe have seen the negative results when leaders are reactionary rather than proactive. Please \nbe sure that a plan is in place to ensure the mutual safety of all involved.โ \n260.  BAXTER claimed the letter was a โpolitical stuntโ and refused to provide any \nspecific details regarding how Sheriffโs Deputies would ensure the safety of Black Lives Matter \nprotesters during peaceful demonstrations.  \nTHE CITY OF ROCHESTERโS UNCONSTITUTIONAL POLICIES AND PRACTICES \n \n261.  The RPDโs violent response to these demonstrations was simply the most \ndocumented and largest-scale example of the Departmentโs widespread pattern and practice of \nusing excessive force, particularly against people of color.     \n262.  For decades, despite countless lawsuits, news reports, protests, and public outcry, \nthe RPD and City of Rochester have remained deliberately indifferent to the need to train, \nsupervise, and discipline RPD officers who use excessive force in routine police encounters with \n79 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 80 of 156\n \nBlack and brown citizens. In particular, the RPD has for decades maintained an internal \ndisciplinary system that is a sham and which utterly fails to discipline officers who have engaged \nin abusesโfostering the culture of brutality and impunity that was on full display during the \nSeptember 2020 protests, even as the world watched.  \nThe RPD Has Engaged In A Pattern Of Policing Of Using Force, Conducting Stops, And \nEngaging In Other Law Enforcement Actions Disproportionately Against People Of Color.  \n \n263.  There is a pattern and practice within the RPD of engaging in law enforcement \nactions โ including using force and more substantial force, and conducting pretextual stops โ\ndisproportionately against people of color. \n264.  Data from five yearsโ of RPD โsubject resistance reportsโ (โSRRsโ), which \nofficers are required to prepare for any use of force beyond handcuffing, show that RPD officers \nuse force, and more serious force, disproportionately against people of color. The RPD provided \nevery SRR completed between October 9, 2011 and June 30, 2016 to a former RPD Investigator, \nCharles LoFaso, to analyze for his doctoral thesis.6 During that time period, RPD officers \ndocumented 3,368 use-of-force incidentsโwhich averages out to two per day.7   \n265.  This data revealed that RPD officersโ use of force was overwhelmingly \nagainst people of color: 66.8% against Black people and 11.5% against Hispanic people. \nThat is 2,243 Black people and 389 Hispanic people who had force used on them by RPD \nofficers during a 1726-day period.  \n \n6 Charles LoFaso, The Effect of Race, Place, and Time on Police Use of Force: How Social Context Influences \nLegal Decision-Making (2020), http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=osu1594479446661188. \n7 The actual rate is higher. The 3,368 number refers to use-of-force incidents against a single subject, \nrather than SRRs filed. Where multiple officers used force against a single subject and each submitted an \nSRR, LoFaso collapsed those reports into a single use-of-force โincidentโ for purposes of his analysis.   \n80 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 81 of 156\n \n266.  Of the 3,368 documented force incidents, nearly a quarter (23.9%) were classified \nas โhigh force,โ meaning the force involved the use of a TASER, baton, canine, bean bag gun, or \ngun. โLow forceโ incidents include officers using tactics such as nerve pressure points, punches \nand jabs, kicks and knee strikes, takedowns, and pepper spray.  \n267.  From the SRR data, LoFaso determined that โas the percentage of Black and \nHispanic residents [in a neighborhood] increases, uses of force significantly increaseโ even \nafter controlling for factors such as crime rates. He further discovered that, again after \ncontrolling for factors like crime rates, โthe odds of being subjected to high force, relative to low \nforce, increase by 17.1% on average, as neighborhood percentage of Black residents increases, \nand by 17.7% on average, as neighborhood percentage of Hispanic residents increases.โ In other \nwords, โofficers use force more often and at more severe levels only when interacting with \ncitizens in neighborhoods with higher percentages of Black and Hispanic residents.โ \n268.  Because SRRs rely on officers to self-report data, it is not possible to know how \nmany uses of force went unreported during that time period. This is true in part because, if a \ncitizen files a complaint with the Department and there are no independent witnesses or \ncorroborating evidence (like an SRR), the case will be closed and the officer will face no \ndisciplinary consequences. LoFaso thus concludes: โFrequency and severity of force may be \nhigher in minority neighborhoods than the results suggest.โ  \n269.  Similarly, Black people, especially Black people in predominantly Black \nneighborhoods, are disproportionately subject to pretextual stops by the RPD. The Monroe \nCounty Public Defender (โMCPDโ) has observed that RPD officers frequently stop young Black \nmen and boys for riding bicycles without bells or walking in the street when sidewalks are \n81 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 82 of 156\n \ncongested. Over 90% of people ticketed by the RPD last year for no lights or bells on bikes, \nfailure to use the sidewalk, and โinadequate turn signalsโ were Black.   \n270.  These stops are not precipitated by accidents or other dangerous conditions. \nRather, RPD officers initiate these stops as a tactic to interfere with the movement of Black \npeople and to leverage searching them. White men, women, and children ride bikes without bells \nand walk in the streets when sidewalks are available but are almost never ticketed for this.  \n271.  The RPD also arrests Black people in Rochester at a disproportionate rate. While \nthe RPD itself collects but does not publish data on arrest rates by race, a 2014 study of the \nDepartmentโs arrest records concluded that RPD officers arrest Black people at a rate 2.7 times \nhigher than non-Black people; that is, 66% of RPD arrests were of Black people, though Black \npeople made up only 42% of the Cityโs population at the time.   \n272.  The RPDโs pattern of racially discriminatory policing, including pretextual stops, \ndates back decades. In 1997, Black people were arrested 2.6 times as often as white people, and \nLatinx people were arrested 1.4 times as often. As the Democrat & Chronicle reported in 1999: \nโRacismโas evidenced by allegations of racial profilingโhas woven its way into [Rochester] \nlaw enforcement.โ A 1993 local task force showed that 70% of people stopped and questioned by \nRPD were Black or Hispanic. And in 2011, community groups called for a federal inquiry into \nthe RPDโs practice of racial profiling after a study concluded that Black people had a one-in-two \nchance of being stopped by the RPD for questioning, while white people had a one-in-11 chance.  \n273.  The RPDโs needless, aggressive, and intimidating tactic of pretextual stops often \nleads to escalation and unnecessary use of force against Black people for minor traffic \ninfractions. \n82 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 83 of 156\n \n274.  LoFasoโs observations in coding the SRRs echo this: โ[A] disturbing number of \nincidentsโฆmight have been resolved without the use of force if the officer had simply continued \ntalking.โ For example, an officer who became irritated at the use of profanity and quickly \ndecided to make a disorderly conduct arrest. โHad the officer ignored the profanity and \ncontinued trying to resolve the issue, a use of force could potentially have been avoided.โ  \n275.  In the last decade alone, the City was named as a defendant in at least 40 federal \nlawsuits alleging the use of violent excessive force by many of the same RPD officers. These \nlawsuits include shocking accounts of the RPDโs extreme and unprovoked violence against \nBlack and brown people.  \n276.  These civil rights lawsuits include shocking, documented accounts of the RPDโs \nextreme and unprovoked violence against Black and brown citizens.8 For example:   \nโข  Dudley Scott: Mr. Scott was a 33-year-old college student who was driving home \none night in August 2014, when RPD Officers Michael Stephens and Evan Henry \nstopped him without cause, handcuffed him, and repeatedly punched and kicked \nhim while restrained and not resisting. Other RPD officers, including Defendant \nRANDY POTUCK, were present and did not intervene. Mr. Scott had to undergo \nsurgery and was permanently blinded in his right eye, with permanently \n \n8 The City of Rochester has settled the majority of these excessive force lawsuits, including but not \nlimited to Blackman v. City of Rochester, No. 13-cv-6152 (W.D.N.Y.) (fatal shooting of Hayden \nBlackman); Maddox v. City of Rochester, No. E2018010768 (Sup. Ct. Monroe Co.) (unprovoked assault \non 16-year-old); Lucas v. City of Rochester, Index No. 499-16 (Sup. Ct., Monroe Co.) (RPD officer struck \nplaintiff with his car); Pagan v. City of Rochester, No. 17-cv-6073 (W.D.N.Y.) (assault on mother of \nyoung man just shot and killed); Santos v. Barber, No. 17-cv-6475 (W.D.N.Y.) (slammed plaintiff face \ndown into the concrete sidewalk requiring surgery to fix and fuse plaintiffโs vertebrate); Johnson v. City \nof Rochester, No. 17-cv-6229 & 17-cv-6490 (W.D.N.Y.) (use of excessive force on two separate \noccasions); Taylor v. City of Rochester, No. 16-cv-6606 (W.D.N.Y.) (same officer as Johnson, called \nplaintiff the n-word and assaulted him, causing tooth to break off and lodge in his lip); Rodriguez v. State \nof New York, No. 13-cv-6301 (W.D.N.Y.) (Officer POTUCK and another officer tased plaintiff causing \nhim to fall to the ground from the second story and then beat him); Dowdell v. City of Rochester, No. 11-\ncv-6493 (W.D.N.Y.) (unjustified assault, causing fractured nose, chipped teeth, bruising and swelling); \nLibbett v. City of Rochester, No. 12-cv-6697 (W.D.N.Y.) (assault by multiple RPD officers on restrained \nand prone plaintiff, batons, pepper spray and tasering); Lawhorn v. Algarin, No. 16-cv-6226 (W.D.N.Y.) \n(unlawful stop by 13 RPD officers, broke car window, pulled plaintiff from the car, and punched him โ \none officer criminally convicted three years later); Turner v. City of Rochester, No. 11-cv-6200 \n(W.D.N.Y.) (Officer Ferrigno slammed plaintiff onto the concrete and threatened to send her to jail \nbecause she was โon his last nerveโ). \n83 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 84 of 156\n \ndiminished vision in his left eye as a result of the brutal beating. The City paid \n$750,000 to settle the case in 2018. Stephens, Evans and POTUCK remain \nemployed by the RPD.  \nโข  Rickey Bryant: Rickey was 17 years old when multiple RPD officers knocked \nhim off his bike, pepper sprayed him, and violently beat himโfracturing his eye \nsocketโin a case of mistaken identity in 2016. An internal RPD investigation \nclaimed that Bryantโs allegations were โunprovable.โ Officers did not have their \nbody worn cameras on but a video captured one RPD officer choking Rickey after \nhe was handcuffed, and the teenager had multiple documented injuries. The City \nsettled the lawsuit for $360,000. The involved officers are all still employed by \nthe RPD.  \nโข  Miriam McKnight: Ms. McKnight called the police to report a stabbing next \ndoor to her house in July 2010. When Officer Gregory Vasile insisted on putting \ncrime scene tape in her yard, Ms. McKnight informed him that he had the wrong \nproperty. Audio recording captured on Ms. McKnightโs phone shows that Vasile \nthen ordered McKnight to turn around and โput [her] hands behind her back,โ \nstating โIโve had enough of this shit.โ He then violently pepper sprayed Ms. \nMcKnight. Her injuries included lacerations, scarring, and breathing difficulties \ndue to the pepper spray. She was awarded $216,875 after a bench trial in her civil \nrights lawsuit. Vasile is still an RPD officer.  \nโข  Tina Cabisca: In 2013, Officers Daryl Hogg and Jason Prinzi used force against \nMs. Cabisca after Investigator Nolan Wengert fatally shot Ms. Cabiscaโs dog. \nAfter a bench trial in February 2019, the judge concluded that after Ms. Cabiscaโs \ndog was shot, Hogg escalated the encounter by yelling at Ms. Cabisca to leave her \nfront yard and abandon her dog. When she objected, Hogg โlost his temperโ and \nused the โstraight arm bar techniqueโ to force her to the ground, then placed his \nfull bodyweight on her back. When Ms. Cabisca objected that she could not \nbreathe and had asthma, Hogg โlean[ed] on her even harder.โ The Court \nconcluded Prinzi also used excessive force when he used his full bodyweight to \npin down the lower half of Ms. Cabiscaโs body. She was awarded $50,000 in \ndamages and $75,000 in attorneyโs fees. Both officers are still employed by the \nRPD; Hogg was promoted to Sergeant in September 2020. \n84 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 85 of 156\n \n \nโข  September 2015, RPD Officers Steven Mitchell, Jeffrey Kester, and Defendant \nMATTHEW DRAKE beat a Black man for over two minutes after he was \nhandcuffed and arrested for purportedly trespassing at a convenience store. While \nthe man was handcuffed, RPD officers slammed him facedown into the ground, \nOfficer Mitchell then beat him with closed fists and punched him in the face. \nThough the man was restrained and lying face-down on the sidewalk, Officer \nMitchell also pepper sprayed him directly in the face. After a month in solitary \nconfinement at the Monroe County Jail, the man was ultimately transferred and \nadmitted to a medical facility for four months. The RPD officersโ brutal treatment \nof the restrained man was captured by four of the convenience storeโs security \ncameras. In 2017, the man was acquitted on all charges after jurors reviewed the \ncamera footage. That year, Kester was promoted to Investigator; the involved \nofficers are all still employed by RPD. The victimโs civil lawsuit is ongoing.   \n \nโข  Christopher Pate: In 2018, Christopher Pate was beaten and tased by RPD \nofficers Michael Sippel and Spenser McAvoy even after he provided them with \nidentification proving he was not the suspect they were looking for. The officers \naccused him of โobstructing trafficโ when he walked across the street to get away \n85 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 86 of 156\n \nfrom them. Sippel and McAvoy handcuffed Mr. Pate, tased him, and violently \nassaulted him. Mr. Pate suffered serious injuries including fractured occipital and \njaw bones. The City delayed release of the body worn camera footage for a year. \nOn video, after beating Mr. Pate, Officer Sippel says, โI blasted my hand off his \nhead,โ then laughs, โWrong guy.โ City Officials, including WARREN, did not \ntake action against the officers until after Mr. Pateโs attorney served notice on the \nCity that he would sue. Sippel was prosecuted and found guilty of third-degree \nmisdemeanor assault.  \n277.  Beyond bodily injury, the peopleโlike Plaintiffsโwho have been injured in \nthese encounters experience fear and anxiety, disruption to their everyday activities and \nemployment, and restrictions on their freedom to travel within their own neighborhoods and \ncities. They, and their families and friends, are impacted by these incidents. These encounters \nleave physical scars as well as deep dignitary harms including anguish and humiliation.  \nThere Is A Pattern And Practice In The RPD Of Falsely Arrersting And Using Excessive \nForce To Retaliate Against Individuals Who Attempt To Record Their Unlawful Conduct \nAnd To Suppress Demonstrations Against The RPDโs Racist Policing Practice. \n \n278.  The RPDโs violent response to Black and brown protesters and those standing in \nsolidarity with them last fall was foreshadowed not only by RPD officersโ widespread unlawful \nuse of force against people of color in routine police encounters, but also by the Departmentโs \nresponse to other protestsโin particular, its use of force against Black protesters and those allied \nin support of Black lives in the past.  \n279.  For example, in May 2015, Katrina Perkins was protesting police brutality on a \npublic street in a residential neighborhood, where two of her daughters and six of her \ngrandchildren resided. Though Ms. Perkins was peacefully demonstrating, RPD officers \nviolently seized and arrested her and then charged her with disorderly conduct and disruption. \nThose charges were dismissed two months later. Police violence is a personal issue for Ms. \nPerkins: her daughter Lashedica was shot three times by former-Deputy Chief Simmons in 2005. \n86 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 87 of 156\n \n280.  In July 2016, in Rochester as across the nation, people took to the streets to \nuphold the sanctity of Black lives and call for an end to racist policing. In response to the BLM \nprotests, the RPD beat, shoved, and pepper sprayed protesters. As one young man described it: โI \nstarted to turn and they tackled me to the ground.โฆTheyโre beating citizens for no reason \nwhatsoever. I wasnโt doing anything. I was taking pictures.โ  \n281.  RPD officers, in keeping with their pattern and practice, particularly targeted \nBlack protesters with unlawful force, including Black journalists. Carlet Cleare and Justin Carter \nof WHAM-TV were both handcuffed and detained by police, even though Ms. Cleare was \nwearing a WHAM-TV shirt and they identified themselves as members of the press. Press \ncolleagues who were there described RPD ignoring white reporters standing right next to Ms. \nCleare and Mr. Carter and instead targeting the two Black journalists. Over the course of one \nweekend, Rochester had more arrests at its BLM protest than the rest of the nation combined. \n282.  By contrast, the RPD has not used force in policing protests that are not about \nBlack Lives and are made up of predominately white protestersโincluding for example the \nseveral โBack the Blueโ protests that took place during the summer and fall 2020 as a show of \nsupport for the RPD in response to calls to โdefend the police.โ   \n283.  Following the 2016 BLM protests, the CITY and the RPD conducted and \ninvestigation and issued a report that critiziced certain tactics used by the RPD. Defendant \nSINGLETARY testified that he never looked at the report or any other reviews of the RPDโs \nresponse to the 2016 BLM protests.  \n284.  Despite widespread condemnation of the Departmentโs response to the September \n2020 protests, RPD officers continue to employ the same unlawful tactics. For example, on \nDecember 18, 2020, a group of approximately 20 protesters held a demonstration to object to the \n87 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 88 of 156\n \nunjust eviction of a single mother and her three children in the middle of the winter during the \npandemic. New York State Assemblyman Demond Meeks attended the protest in solidarity; soon \nafter he arrived, he began a Facebook Live recording of the events. Cell phone video shows that \nimmediately after he arrived, two dozen or more RPD officers in riot gear approached the scene. \nThough Assemblyman Meeks was neither standing on the property nor interfering with the \nofficersโ execution of the warrant, officers went directly toward Meeks, informed him he was \nunder arrest, and ordered him to put his hands behind his back. Immediately after Meeks \ncomplied, officers repeatedly told him to โstop resistingโ even though the video shows he was \nnot resisting in any way. \n285.  RPD officersโ unconstitutional response to citizens exercising their right to free \nspeech is indicative of the Departmentโs widespread practice of interfering with the same when \ncitizens exercise their right to record officers engaging in abuses. In carrying out this practice, \nRPD officers frequently make legally baseless arrests of individuals engaged in First \nAmendment activity who do not comply with an officerโs unlawful order to stop recording or to \nleave the area. These arrests are commonly referred to as โcontempt of copโ arrests. To conceal \nthe illegality of these arrests, RPD officers charge the victim of the unlawful arrest with a low-\nlevel crime that does not require a criminal court complaint. This is known as a โcover charge.โ \nThe most common cover charges are disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and obstruction of \ngovernmental administration. \n286.  Plaintiff EMILY GOOD was a victim of one such โcontempt of copโ arrest on \nMay 12, 2011, prior to joining NLG Rochester. GOOD was standing on the front lawn of her \nhome filmingโfrom 10 to 15 feet awayโRPD officers engaged in the traffic stop of a young \nBlack man. RPD Officer Mario Masic noticed GOOD filming and ordered her back into her \n88 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 89 of 156\n \nhome, stating she seemed โanti-policeโ and he did not feel safe with her there. GOOD remained \ncalm and stated she was only standing on her property and did not pose any threat. Masic \nresponded that heโd had enough: โYou know what? Youโre going to go to jail.โ He then came \nonto GOODโs lawn, handcuffed her, and forcibly led her to a squad car while she pleaded for \nhim to explain why she was being arrested. A video of the unlawful arrest can be found here: \nhttps://tinyurl.com/yff34jaw.  \n287.  GOOD was charged with โobstructing governmental administrationโ but the \ncharges were later dropped. Though RPDโs internal view concluded Masic should not have \narrested GOOD for recording the traffic stop, then-Police Chief James Sheppard praised Masic \nfor maintaining his โprofessional demeanorโ in effecting the illegal arrest.  \n288.  The RPD has continued to target GOOD since this incident. For example, when \ncommunity activists held a meeting to discuss GOODโs case and the need for police \naccountability in Rochester, RPD officers responded to the meeting, harassed and intimidated the \npeople present, and falsely ticketed all the cars parked outside of the meeting space. \n289.  In a strikingly similar incident last June, Tobias Massey was also falsely arrested \nfor recording RPD officers violently arresting a man in his front yard. Mr. Massey was woken up \nby screaming from his front yard, where three RPD officers were on top of a Black man, who \nwas crying that he could not breathe and did not want to die. Mr. Massey went outside to record \nthe event. When the RPD officers noticed he was recording, they chased him into his home, \nwrestled him down, handcuffed and arrested him. Mr. Massey was taken to the emergency room \nbecause of injuries he sustained from the encounter, where the officers gave him an appearance \nticket charging him with resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration for filming \nthe police. After reviewing the video, former Chief SINGLETARY dropped the charges against \n89 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 90 of 156\n \nMr. Massey. Mr. Masseyโs civil lawsuit against the three RPD officers is pending. All three \nofficers remain employed by the RPD.   \n290.  Similarly, Plaintiff EMILY MCINTYRE was falsely arrested by Defendant \nSTEPHEN BOILY and other John Doe RPD officers on August 2, 2020 at approximately 12:00 \na.m. in the vicinity of East Avenue and Alexander Street in retaliation for filming an RPD officer \nwho was arresting a Black man in front of a bar called Murphyโs Law. The officers falsely \ncharged her with a violation of the Mayorโs unlawful curfew9, even though she was not \ncongregated with with any other person, let alone five or more people as required to be arrested \nunder the โcurfew.โ All the false charges were eventually dismissed in their entirety on January \n19, 2021.  \n291.  In a report issued in April 2021, the Monroe County Public Defenderโs Office \nobserved that certain charges are regularly filed against a defendant where excessive use of force \nis alleged by the client or a defendant has injuries that appear to be more severe than the situation \nwarranted. These charges include Assault in the Second Degree, Resisting Arrest, and \nObstruction of Governmental Administration. \n \n9 Mayor Warrenโs Emergency Order, issued on June 15, 2020 pursuant to New York Executive \nLaw ยง 24, states:  \nโORDERED that, between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m., it \nshall be unlawful to gather in groups of five or more in a public place \nin the City of Rochester. For purposes of this clause, a public place \nincludes any outdoor premises or other area that is open to the \npublic, including but not limited to streets, sidewalks, parks, parking \nlots, vacant lots and any unused or unimproved land. Violation of \nthis clause shall be a class B misdemeanor in accordance with \nExecutive Law ยง24(5).โ \n  \n90 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 91 of 156\n \n292.  Examples of this practice, detailed above, include the false charges filedโand all \nlater dismissedโin the cases of Katrina Perkins, Miriam McKnight, Plaintiff GOOD, and Tobias \nMassey. \n293.  Plaintiff DYNASTY BUGGSโs experience with the RPD is emblematic of these \nillegal patterns: BUGGS was subjected to excessive force, prevented from recording her abuse \nby the police, and then charged with false cover charges. On December 18, 2019, Defendants \nVANBREDERODE and PASZKO unlawfully stopped BUGGS while she was driving. \nVANBREDERODE approached the driverโs side and ordered BUGGS to exit the car without \nlawful justification. When BUGGS objected and tried to record what was happening on her \nphone, VANBREDERODE grabbed her phone and threw it. He then pepper sprayed her in the \nface while she was still in the car. After, VANBREDERODE forcibly removed BUGGS from the \ncar, placed handcuffs on her wrists, and pepper sprayed her again after she was handcuffed. \n294.  VANBREDERODE falsely charged BUGGS with obstruction of governmental \nadministration, resisting arrest, and driving without a license. All the false charges were \ndismissed at her first court date. \n295.  After VANBREDERODE pepper sprayed BUGGS the first time, her cousin \nLonnie Buchananโwho was in the front passenger seatโexited the vehicle. PASZKO \nimmediately seized Mr. Buchanan, threw him against the side of the car, pepper sprayed him in \nthe face, handcuffed him in an unreasonably tight manner, then placed him in the back of the \npolice car. PASZKO falsely accused Mr. Buchanan of committing a crime; those charges were \nalso dismissed.   \n296.  Thereafter, BUGGS tried to file an internal complaint against VANBREDERODE \nfor his unlawful use of force, but she was repeatedly thwarted. She called the RPD several times \n91 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 92 of 156\n \nto make a complaint, but no one would speak to her or tell her how to file a formal complaint. \nEventually, BUGGS spoke with an RPD supervisor who told her she could not file a complaint \nand that she โshould have gotten out of the fucking car.โ  \n297.  The widespread practice of RPD officers using force against individuals for \nfilming them while they are performing their police duties in public places, and then filing \npatently false โcover chargesโ in an attempt to justify their unlawful conduct, is part and parcel \nof the RPDโs culture of impunity. Even when these false charges are dismissed by prosecutors, \nand the officersโ unlawful conduct is captured by video evidence, the RPD routinely fails to \ndiscipline the offending officers. This failure of supervision and oversight encourages officers to \nuse force without justification because they know there are no consequences.  \nThe City And RPD Have Utterly Failed To Train, Supervise, And Discipline Officers,  \nDespite The Widespread Unconstitutional Practices Described Above. \n \n298.  For years, the City has been deliberately indifferent to the obvious need to \nsupervise and discipline officers who use excessive force against citizens, particularly citizens of \ncolor. Instead, the RPD has maintained a sham internal disciplinary system that consistently and \ndeliberately fails to discipline substantial numbers of officers who are known to have engaged in \nracist policing and unlawful use of force.   \n299.  The RPD investigates civilian complaints internally through its Professional \nStandards Sections (โPSSโ). From 2008 to 2013, the PSS did not sustain a single civilian \ncomplaint for unnecessary use of force. During that time, countless people of color were injured \nand at least oneโHayden Blackmanโwas killed by RPD officers. Examples include: Benny \nWarr, a 52-year-old Black man and wheelchair-bound amputee who was beaten by RPD officers \nwhile waiting for the bus in 2013; Robinn Turner, a Black woman who had her rib broken by \nRPD Officer Joseph Ferrigno in 2010, after he body slammed and assaulted her; Darren \n92 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 93 of 156\n \nWilliams, a Black man who was punched in the face and thrown to the ground by Ferrigno in \n2012, while Ferrigno uttered racial slurs about โteaching [him] to respect authorityโ; and \nDwayne Ivery, a Black man who was punched in the head and tackled to the ground by Officer \nAlexander Baldauf, who continued to beat Mr. Ivery even after he was placed in handcuffs. The \nunprovoked beating of Mr. Ivery was captured on video but Baldauf was never disciplined, nor \nwere any of the other RPD officers in the above incidents.  \n300.  Based on the most recent data available, the PSS investigated 65 officers for 144 \ncomplaints of misconduct in 2019. Of the 61 use of force complaints, PSSโs overall โsustainedโ \nrate was approximately 1% (with a single sustained allegation). Of the 7 discourtesy complaints, \nthe overall PSS sustained rate was 0% (with none sustained).  \n301.  On paper, the Civilian Review Board also reviews complaints against officers. \nBut the CRB does not have any independent investigative power and almost always reaches the \nsame outcome as PSS. In 2019, for instance, the CRB exonerated officers in 48 use of force \ncomplaintsโtwo more than PSS (which exonerated 46 complaints).  \n302.  RPDโs disciplinary process ultimately ends with the Chief of Police. Any outcome \nincluding discipline is completely at his or her discretion. From 2001 to 2016, of 923 civilian-\ngenerated allegations of force, the Chief sustained only 16โor 1.7%. One former CRB member \nrecognized the futility of the process: โI remember one case when our panel and the investigating \nofficers separately concluded that unreasonable, abusive force had been used by the arresting \nofficers. The chief overruled all of usโwe had no authority or power. I quit after that.โ \n303.  In the rare case where RPD officer misconduct has been exposed through video \nrecordings or court proceedings, leading the Chief to sustain an allegation, the RPD has not \nimposed meaningful discipline against the offending officer. From 2001 to 2015, for example, \n93 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 94 of 156\n \nthe harshest penalty given out for the 16 sustained use of force complaints were 6 suspensions, \nmost ranging from 1 to 20 days.  \n304.  By comparison, Officer Justin Linton failed to report for duty in July 2015 and \nlied to his supervisor about the reasonโsaying his flight had been delayed when, in fact, he had \nnot booked a return flight until the following day. Linton received a 30-day suspension for \nโAbsence from Dutyโ and โTruthfulnessโ violations. In 2005, David Williams conducted a \nbackground check using the RPD system without authority. He received a 30-day suspension.   \n305.  The RPD sends a clear message to its officers based on the degree of discipline (if \nany) meted out for excessive force against people of color compared to other internal \ndepartmental violations. That message is that RPD will tolerate, if not condone, violence against \nBlack and brown people.    \n306.  For example, Sergeant Kevin Leckinger was found to have used unjustified force \nduring his June 2017 arrest of Joseph Gangemiโincluding grabbing Gangemi by his neck, \napplying clavicle notch pressure point while Mr. Gangemi was constrained, and repeatedly \ntelling Mr. Gangemi to โcalm downโ while applying โa pain compliance technique.โ Leckinger \nwas also found, based on body worn camera video, to have said: โBring your wrists behind your \nback or I will rip your arms out of your socketsโ and โStop being an idiot, honestly, how stupid \nare you?,โ while pulling upwards on Mr. Gangemiโs arms. Leckinger signed a settlement with \nthe RPD three years later, in 2020, agreeing to a penalty of 8 days suspension, with 4 to be taken \nas forfeited vacation time.  \n307.  On May 27, 2018, RPD Officer Michael Stephens falsely arrested and used \nexcessive force against Plaintiff Anthony Hall in retaliation for Mr. Hall video recording him \nassaulting Mr. Hallโs friendโanother black manโon a public sidewalk in downtown Rochester. \n94 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 95 of 156\n \nOfficer Stephens struck Mr. Hall in the head with a baton, pepper sprayed him from close range \nand falsely arrested him. Officer Stephens also attacked and pepper sprayed several of Mr. Hallโs \nfriends from close range and falsely arrested them The false cover charges lodged against Mr. \nHall and his friends were eventually dismissed, and the RPDโs Professional Standards Section \nfound that Officer Stephens had committed numerous constitutional violations during the \nencounter; however, the RPD failed to adequately discipline Stephens following this incident. \nThe City recently settled a lawsuit brought by Mr. Hall and two of his friends for $175,000.  \n308.  As detailed more fully above, Officer Stephens has a disturbing history of similar \nincidents. Before he assaulted Mr. Hall, Officer Stephens brutally beat a young man named \nDudley Scott, punching him in the face at least three times after Mr. Scott was handcuffed. The \nassault left Mr. Scott with a fractured right orbital and permanent blindness in his right eye. \nBetween that incident and when Officer Stephens pepper sprayed and assaulted Mr. Hall and his \nfriends, the RPD did not discipline Officer Stephens. As a result of the Cityโs failure to \nadequately supervise and discipline Officer Stephens, in the past four years the City has paid \n$925,000 to resolve just these two incidents where Stephens used excessive force against young \nBlack men. Stephens is still employed by the RPD. \n309.  RPD officer Jason Vaughn was investigated for unlawful use of force against \nBrian Norford after he hit Mr. Norford with a patrol car in February 2016. Although video \nfootage showed Vaughn intentionally striking Mr. Norfordโthe CRB review notes the โvehicle \nwas headed directly in a direct line toward subjectโ and that Vaughnโs alternative explanation \n(that he was aiming for a driveway that was not near Mr. Norford) did not make senseโhe was \ndisciplined only for failing to fill out a โFleet Accidentโ report and received a letter of \nreprimand.  \n95 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 96 of 156\n \n310.  In 2013, Defendant MATTHEW DRAKE was also found by the PSS to have \ndriven his marked police vehicle in โan unsafe mannerโ into a crowd of peopleโstriking an \nindividual who sustained injuries that necessitated medical attention. But DRAKE received only \na letter of reprimand. \n311.  Similarly, pursuant to policy, neither PASZKO nor VANBREDERODE were \ndisciplined following the incident where they falsely arrested and used excessive force against \nMs. Buggs, detailed supra at paragraphs 278-281.  \n312.  The failure to discipline PASZKO nor VANBREDERODE led them to go on and \nuse excessive force against numerous other citizens in Rochester. For example, as detailed \nabove, on September 16, 2020, PASZKO forcibly removed Plaintiff WINONA MILLER, a 52-\nyear-old disabled Black woman, from a bench and applied handcuffs to her wrists in an \nunreasonably tight manner. When Ms. MILLER complained that the handcuffs were too tight, \nPASZKO kneed her in the stomach.  \n313.  Neither PASZKO nor any other officers were disciplined for the incident with \nMs. MILLER on September 16, 2020. Instead, PASZKO and his partner VANBREDERODE \nwere named โOfficers of the Monthโ for September 2020. \n314.  Thereafter, as detailed above, on January 29, 2021, PASZKO and \nVANBREDERODE failed to intervene to prevent their fellow officers from throwing an \nemotionally distraught 9-year-old Black girl on the snow and ice, and from pepper spraying her \nat point-blank range directly in the face as she was handcuffed in the back seat of a police car, \ndespite having had the time and opportunity to do so.  \n315.  Put simply, the RPD has a sham disciplinary and internal investigation process. \nAfter an assault, officers routinely falsify documents or fabricate claims to cover up their \n96 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 97 of 156\n \nunlawful conduct. RPD officers also routinely fail to report any use of force or under report the \namount of force used in an attempt to justify their use of unnecessary and excessive forceโ\ngenerally by claiming the victim had resisted arrest or otherwise โobstructedโ officers. Use of \nforce reports frequently include implausible narratives of a single individual who is reported to \nhave assaulted or threatened the officers, even when unarmed and restrained, while that officer is \naccompanied by multiple other officers.  \n316.  Even when a complaint is made, the RPD systemically fails to conduct \nmeaningful investigations into its officersโ uses of force. When the PSS does conduct an \ninvestigation, the supervisors routinely credit officersโ accounts that are implausible on their \nface, inconsistent with citizensโ injuries, or obviously manufactured collaboratively after the fact. \nRelatedly, the Department has for years failed to credit citizen accounts of officer violence, even \nwhen those accounts are supported by video footage or other eyewitnesses and consistent with \ndocumented injuries.  \n317.  By intentionally failing to in any way meaningfully supervise or discipline \nofficers who are known to have used excessive force against Black and brown people, \nsupervisors signal to officers that they can engage in unnecessary and excessive force with \nimpunity because their lies and attempts to cover up wrongdoing will not be questioned.  \n318.  Rather, instead of disciplining officers known to engage in racist, violent policing, \nthe RPD has a practice of commending and promoting officers who have credible (or even \nsustained) allegations of excessive force against them. For example, the Department awarded \nOfficer Patrick Giancursio its โOfficer of the Yearโ Award in May 2017, even though he was \nsuspended at the time while the Department allegedly investigated his use of force against \n97 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 98 of 156\n \nAlexander Grassies in an April 2017 incident that was caught on surveillance tape. Giancursio \nwas made an Investigator three years later.  \n319.  In 2011, a PSS investigation determined that Officer Gary Wegman used \nโinappropriate forceโ on a Latino manโspecifically that Wegman struck him in the face with a \nstraight punch without justification. That same year, Wegman received a โChiefโs Letter of \nRecognition.โ The following year, in 2012, Wegman pled guilty to inappropriate use of force; he \nreceived a letter of reprimand in his file. He was nevertheless honored with both an โExcellent \nPolice Service Awardโ and a โChiefโs Letter of Recognitionโ that year. He has since been \npromoted to Sergeant.      \n320.  The rampant use of force by several notorious officersโknown throughout \nRochesterโs Black and brown communitiesโmake clear that RPDโs internal disciplinary \nmechanisms are entirely feckless. The Department knowingly has and continues to retain officers \nwith demonstrated history of using unnecessary and excessive force against people of color.  \nExamples of officers who have demonstrated such propensities include but are not limited to the \nfollowing:  \n321.  Thomas Rodriguez: Until he was permitted to voluntarily retire with his full \npension last spring, Officer Rodriguez was known for using excessive force and seriously \ninjuring citizens in Black neighborhoods during his thirty-year career in the RPD. For example, \nin August 2002, he participated in the brutal beating and TASERing of Lawrence Rogers, which \nled to his asphyxiation and death; in 2016, he participated in the beating of 17-year-old Ricky \nBryant, fracturing Mr. Bryantโs orbital socket. And in 2017, Rodriguez placed DKuan Webb in \nan illegal chokehold, which was recorded on his body camera. The video was not released \n98 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 99 of 156\n \npublicly. But the judge dismissed all criminal charges against Webb, and the City settled his \nlawsuit for $125,000 only days after it was filed.  \n322.  Mario โCowboyโ Masic: Despite an egregious history of excessive force, Masic \nalso voluntarily retired with his full pension last spring after fifteen years in the Department. \nRochester residents dubbed him โCowboyโ because of his well-known lawless tactics. Masic \nembraced the nicknameโhe even had a โcowboyโ themed weddingโand became notorious for \nreferring to himself as โthe Cowboyโ during interactions with citizens. It was Masic who \nillegally arrested Plaintiff GOOD in 2011 because she was lawfully recording him stopping a \nBlack man from her own property. And in 2014, Masic burst into a laundromat where Quintin \nKeene, a Black man, was talking to his grandmother on the phone, rushed him without warning, \nthreatened to shoot him if he did not comply, beat him, pepper sprayed him, and then falsely \ncharged him. The false charges were all ultimately dismissed, with the Judge stating: โThis case \nraises a lot of issues for our community.โ  The City later paid to settle Mr. Keeneโs civil suit. \nOnly a year later, in 2015, Masic and other RPD officers were harassing Rasheed Griner, a \nyoung Black man, and his family; when Mr. Griner asked for Masicโs badge number, Masic \nstated, โIโve had enough of your mouthโ and hit Mr. Griner in the face with his baton. Mr. Griner \nreceived stitches for his facial injuries; Masicโs false charges against him were dismissed after \nthe Judge determined the arrest was unlawful.  \n323.  Officer Joseph Ferrigno: Ferrigno, who is still employed by the City is well-\nknown for using unlawful force against Black and brown citizens. Ferrigno joined the force in \n2007. By April 2016, he had at least 23 citizen complaints against him. His egregious violence \nincludes slamming a Black woman to the ground, breaking her rib; punching a Black man in the \nface and repeatedly striking him in the head and body; and throwing a disabled Black man from \n99 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 100 of 156\n \nhis wheelchair, pepper spraying, and beating him with the help of his RPD partner, Anthony \nLiberatore. The man, Benny Warr, suffered three broken ribs and irreparable damage to his leg. \nWarr filed a complaint with the CRB but Ferrigno and Liberatore were exonerated despite a \ncitizen capturing the beating on film. In April 2016, Ferrigno mistakenly pursued a Black man, \nSilvon Simmons, and shot him three timesโin his back, buttock, and right thigh. Simmons had a \nfractured rib, collapsed lung, and bullets that were left in his chest and pelvis. He was charged \nwith attempting to kill a police officer but the gun allegedly found at the scene did not have \nSimmonsโ DNA or his fingerprints on it. The RPD also would not test Simmonsโ clothing for \ngunshot residue despite his repeated requests. And a woman who was directly across the street \ntestified she heard only the number of shots fired by Ferrigno that nightโno more. Simmons was \nultimately clearled of all criminal charges. Ferrigno was nevertheless cleared by PSS and the \nCRB; he was also honored with the โOfficer of the Monthโ award for his actions that April.  \n324.  The only discipline Ferrigno has received to date is a three-day suspension for \nโsecuringโ a 13-year-old juvenile without contacting his parent in 2013. One of the involved \nchildren said Ferrigno and Liberatore told them, if the kids were older, the officers would โbeat \nthe fuck out of [them].โ He remains an RPD officer.  \nThe City And RPD Have Created, Condoned, And Encouraged A Culture Of Impunity For \nRacist, Violent Policing Of Black And Brown People By RPD Officers. \n \n325.  The violence inflicted by RPD officers on Rochesterโs Black and brown \ncommunities is appalling and unlawful. But it is neither a surprise nor a coincidence; rather, it is \nthe tragically foreseeable result of a Department that has for decades turned a blind eye to racist \nactions by officers and still today employs officers who have used racial slurs and shown \naffiliation for white supremacist groups.  \n100 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 101 of 156\n \n326.  The Departmentโs culture of racismโboth implicit and overtโis deeply \nentrenched. In 1984, RPD officer Ron Evangelista, then-President of the Locust Club, stated in \nan interview with the Democrat and Chronicle: โMinorities, not just Blacks, are not popular with \npolice, who are mostly white, middle-class people.โ Evangelista repeatedly dismissed concerns \nabout racism within the department. When asked about how to improve trust between Black \nresidents and the RPD, he responded that Black leaders should stop promoting โpolice mistrustโ \nand rejected calls for civilian oversight as unnecessary โpublic appeasementโ for Black people \nwho felt the police cannot police themselves. RPD officers re-elected Evangelista as police union \npresident for nearly three decades; he served from 1981 until 2008.  \n327.  Current-Locust Club President Mazzeo echoed this view more recently when he \nacknowledged there is some level of systemic racism in the RPD.  \n328.  LoFaso, in analyzing the Departmentโs disproportionate use of force against \nBlack and brown people, also observed: โMost officers who join the RPD are white, male, from \nmiddle-class backgrounds, and have little life experience outside of schoolโฆ. [T]hey are now \ninteracting daily with racial and ethnic minorities whose lived experiences are vastly different \nfrom theirs.โ  \n329.  Indeed, in contrast to the population of Rochester, the RPD is overwhelmingly \nwhite, and nearly all live outside of Rochester. Though only 37% of Rochesterโs population is \nwhite, 75% of RPD officers are white. This is despite the fact that the City has been under a \nfederal consent decree for the past 46 years requiring at least 25% of the Department be officers \nof color. When that decree was entered in 1975, 25% of the Cityโs population was Black or \nbrown. But this overwhelmingly white police force now patrols a City that is predominantly \nBlack and Latinx (40% and 19% respectively). Moreover, only 6.6% of RPD officers live in \n101 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 102 of 156\n \nRochester. By long failing to hire a proportionate number of officers of color and Rochester \nresidents, the City has created a police force that is wholly separate from the community it is \nmeant to serve.  \n \n \n330.  The RPDโs culture of racist, violent policing was on full display in the 1992 \nfederal trial of RPDโs HIT squad officers. Dozens of white officers testified, on condition of \nimmunity, about witnessingโand participating inโphysical abuse of โsuspectsโ in Rochesterโs \nBlack and brown neighborhoods. There was also specific testimony of misconduct by the \ndefendant officers. For example, police witnesses testified that one defendant officer, Sergeant \nThomas Alessi, kicked a suspect in the mouth, knocking out his teeth, and had held a gun to \nanother suspectโs head while the man was bleeding.  \n102 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 103 of 156\n \n331.  After the acquittals, despite these damning accounts of widespread brutality and \ncover-ups, the RPD did not apologize to the community or display remorse. Instead, RPD \nofficers openly celebrated and officials did nothing to reign in the rampant misconduct that had \nbeen exposed. On hearing the verdict, Alessi declared: โI can get my pistol permit back.โ  \n332.  The RPDโs permissive attitude toward officers who openly espouse violent, \nunlawful inclinations towards the citizens they purport to serve persists. In 1997, for example, \nRPD officer John Fiorica started Crime Dawg Gear, a T-shirt company marketed toward RPD \nand other law enforcement. On the Crime Dawg website, he described companyโs T-shirt slogans \nas all coming โfrom ideas inspired by fellow officers.โ Some of those designs are shown below: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n103 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 104 of 156\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n333.  On the Crime Dawg website, Fiorica expressly thanked his partner, now-Captain \nFrank Umbrino and various โCrime Dawg Gear supermodelsโ including Officer Theresa Bell \n(now Dearcop), who has been made an Investigator, and John Koonmen who currently \ncommands the Departmentโs Special Operations Unit. Anthony Bongiovanni, โThe Friskโ \nmodel, recently retired as a Sergeant after over 30 years on the force. He is named as a defendant \nin at least two excessive force lawsuits pending against the City. \n334.  Though the companyโs website has since been taken down, Fiorica openly \nmaintained Crime Dawg Gear for at least 10 years, selling apparel, including infant clothing and \nthongs, and promotional products with these slogans to RPD and other law enforcement officers. \nFiorica was made an Investigator in 2001 (when the website was still active). He remains an \nRPD Investigator today. \n335.   The RPDโs longstanding and continued acceptance ofโand complete failure to \ndisciplineโofficers who overtly reference killing or beating citizens sets the tone for RPD \nofficers to act with impunity when they, unsurprisingly, use unjustified violence, particularly \nagainst Black and brown people \n336.  Racist policing, including racial epithets and derogatory language, by RPD \nofficers is widespread and consistently tolerated by fellow officers and the Department. The \nbelow examples are illustrative.  \n337.  In 2002, RPD Officer Brian Sexstone and several other RPD officer created a \nmemo entitled โGhetto Lingoโ that listed over 70 street slang terms and definitionsโ like \n104 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 105 of 156\n \nโsammichโ for โsandwichโ or โreap what you soapโ for โreap what you sowโโwhich Sexstone \nsaid he wrote as a โjoke.โ After the memo came to light, Sexstone was terminated by the RPDโ\nbut only for a few years.  \n338.  Sexstone was rehired in 2006, and within two years, he was accused of making \nracist remarks to two Black citizens, including calling a Black woman the โn-wordโ while \narresting her and asking when she would โlearn white people donโt care about Black people.โ \nThe woman was acquitted of all charges after the Judge heard her testimony. A spokesperson for \nthe RPD at the time said Sexstone was on active duty and no internal investigation was being \ndone. Sexstone has never been disciplined and remains an RPD officer.  \n339.  In 2005, an RPD officer verbally harassed 12-year-old Shakirrah Sinclair, calling \nher a bitch. When her 16-year-old brother Jamar tried to report the officerโs conduct, he was \nassaulted by the officer, who said he โcouldnโt stand n---- like youโ and called him an โasshole.โ \nMultiple RPD officers then pepper sprayed and arrested both Jamar and Shakirrah. The children \nwere both treated at the hospital, and the criminal charges against them dismissed. The City paid \nto settle a lawsuit brought on the childrenโs behalf, but, on information and belief, the officers \nwere never disciplined. The one who used racial slurs voluntarily retired in 2016.   \n340.  In 2013, three Black teenagersโ15-year-old Raliek Redd and two of his \nteammates on the Edison Tech High School basketball teamโwere on the sidewalk at the \ndesignated pick up on Main Street for a school bus to transport them to a game. They were \napproached by an RPD officer who ordered them to move and, when they explained they were \nwaiting for the school bus, the RPD officer handcuffed them, searched their belongings and \narrested them for purportedly โobstructing trafficโ on the sidewalk. While they were at the scene \nin the back of the police cars, their coach and teammates arrived to catch the bus also. When \n105 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 106 of 156\n \ntheir coach tried to explain that Raliek and his two teammates were waiting for the bus and had \ndone nothing wrong, the officer told him: โIf I had a big enough caravan, I would arrest all of \nyou.โ The young men were transported to the PSB where they were subjected to a humiliating \nstrip search. The criminal charges against them were all dismissed the next month when the \nDistrict Attorney refused to prosecute them. The City paid a total of $50,000 to settle the three \nlawsuits, but the officer was never disciplined.  \n \n \n341.  A year later, in 2016, Lentorya Parker went to pick up her 6-year-old daughter \nfrom daycare, when she encountered several RPD officers on the street. After she yelled at the \npolice, โWhat are you doing?,โ Officer Jonathan Marsh told her to stop yelling and get out of the \nstreet. As she turned to go into the yard, Marsh said, โOh, too late.โ As captured on bodyworn \ncamera video, Marsh then ran and tackled Parker to the ground from behind as other RPD \nofficers joined him. Ms. Parker was pepper sprayed three times, as her young daughter was \nscreaming nearby. She suffered injuries to her back and elbow. \n106 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 107 of 156\n \n342.  Officers can then be heard on the camera footage discussing what to charge \nParker withโone asks: โWere there five people around?,โ wondering if she can be charged with \nโinciting a riotโ on the nearly deserted street. Another officer, while watching Ms. Parkerโs \ndaughter says to the little girl: โSorry, your momโs an animal.โ Ms. Parker was charged with \ndisorderly conduct, resisting arrest, harassment, and obstructing government administration. The \ncriminal charges against Ms. Parker were all dismissed. All six of the RPD officers involved, \nincluding Marsh, are still employed by the Department. None was disciplined for the incident; at \nleast one has since been honored by the Department for his โDistinguished Service.โ \n343.  In March 2017, Rakim Yancey, a Black man, was accosted by RPD Sergeant \nTimothy Pancoe who used racist language when ordering Mr. Yancey to move his car. In \nresponse to Mr. Yanceyโs asking why he used that language, Pancoe pepper sprayed and \nassaulted Mr. Yancey. Two other RPD officers, Chris Kosch and Bradley Pike, were also \ninvolved in assaulting Mr. Yanceyโwho required hospital treatment for wrist fractures, a \nchipped tooth, and multiple contusions and abrasions. None of the involved officers have been \ndisciplined; Pancoe was promoted to Lieutenant in 2019. Mr. Yanceyโs civil lawsuit against the \nofficers remains pending.  \n344.  During a City Councilโs public forum in March 2021, several Rochester residents \ngave statements about the RPDโs racist policing practices, in particular the verbal and physical \nabuse of people of color. For example, one white person who runs the Rochester Teen \nEmpowerment Center spoke about comments made to him firsthand by RPD officers about the \nBlack children he works withโlike โI hate these effing kidsโโor officers describing their job as \nโkeeping crime contained in these areas so it doesnโt get close to where we live.โ He continued: \nโI have met with Chief after Chief giving officersโ names, quotes, actions I have seen, heard, and \n107 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 108 of 156\n \nheard aboutโwe still cannot get these officers off these streets.โ He further highlighted the \ndamage done to Rochesterโs young Black and brown people by officersโ โoffensive and racistโ \ncomments.  \n345.  On the rare occasion the Department investigates and sustains racist behavior by \nits officers, those officers receive little discipline, no increased supervision, and no remediation. \nFor example, in 2015, Officer Ryan Hartley was investigated for an off-duty argument at a bar \nduring which he yelled, among other things, โgo back to the hoodโ at a Black employee and \nโbitchโ and โc---โ at a woman bartender. Based on the testimony of multiple eyewitnesses, the \nPSS investigation determined Hartley had โdirected prejudicial comments toward an African \nAmerican employee.โ Four years later, in 2019, he was suspended for 12 days without pay, with \n6 of those days to be forfeited from his vacation. Hartley remains an RPD officer today.  \n108 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 109 of 156\n \n \n \n346.  In 2013, the RPD received multiple concerned calls regarding Officer Andrew \nKlein. seen in the photograph above with his tongue sticking out driving his marked Rochester \npolice vehicle with a black stuffed-toy monkey hanging from its spotlight. Klein received only \n10 days suspension, with 3 days taken from paid leave. During his interview with PSS, Klein \nalluded to being directed to stay out of a predominantly Black neighborhood, โfor about six \nmonths because of an incident that happened, you know, a while ago.โ But Klein denied having \nany โproblem with Black people,โ claiming his intention in hanging the monkey on his car was \nto attract kids. \n347.  The Departmentโs racial bias is evident in other ways. For example, the RPD \nroutinely deploys militarized-forcesโincluding a mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicle, State \n109 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 110 of 156\n \nPolice helicopters, pepper spray and pepper balls, and officers clad in riot gearโto police the \nannual Puerto Rican festival. Yet the Department sends recruitment officers to the Cityโs annual \nโLittle Italyโ Italian festival to look for future RPD officers:  \n \n \n348.    Members of Rochesterโs Puerto Rican community have for years pressed RPD \non the militarized police presence at their festival and raised officersโ problematic behavior at the \nfestival. Seventeen-year-old Rickey Bryant was stopped and beaten by several RPD officers after \nthe festival in 2017, for example. Yet again, the RPD has not changed its tactics. \n349.  A 2017 Report on the Department observed that โstructures of white \nsupremacyโฆmay exist in the RPDโs culture and practices.โ The examples above bear this \nout, as does the following: \n350.  In 2011, PSS investigated RPD Officer Braddon Elliott for conducting personal \nbusiness during his shifts. That business was related to his involvement in a motorcycle club of \nwhich he was a co-founder and club Treasurer. Though heavily redacted, the interview of Elliot \nreveals that his motorcycle club has only white members. When questioned about a graphic of \n110 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 111 of 156\n \nโtwo fists and an 88โ featured on T-shirts โfor people to buy and show their support for the \nclub,โ Elliott responded the number โ88โ represents the phrase โHeil Hitler,โ because H is the \neighth letter in the alphabet. The number โ88โ features prominently in white supremacist \nideology.  \n351.  Three RPD supervisorsโSergeants Kavanaugh, Hayes, and Gaglianoโconducted \nthe interview. Towards the interviewโs end, after having testified about the clubโs T-shirts \nfeaturing a symbol of white supremacy and other club media, Officer Elliott is cut off by Sgt. \nGagliano, who states: โIf thatโs your answer, thatโs your answer. Who gives a shit. Letโs end it.โ \nSgt. Gagliano further complains, โweโve been here for an hour discussing this shit.โ     \n352.  Despite Elliottโs admission that he was a founding member and third-in-command \nof a club that supported white supremacy and that he wore a white supremacist symbol, the \nDepartment did not discipline him. Instead, years later, Elliott was suspended for five days for \nโneglecting his duties as a sworn police officer by attending meetings [] of the motorcycle club \nwhile on duty.โ  \n353.  For decades, the RPD has been notorious for its racist, brutal policing. But City \nand RPD officials have ratified, permitted, and encouraged RPD officersโ physical and verbal \nabuse of Black and brown citizens by denying the prevalence of racist attitudes among white \nRPD officers, refusing to investigate or discipline such attitudesโeven in the face of overt \nevidenceโand covering up the prevalence of these racist attitudes among its officers.  \n354.  The Departmentโs longstanding permissive attitude and failure to train, supervise \nand discipline officers who have engaged in egregious displays of racism or force has fostered a \nculture of impunity that has led RPD officers to understand they can beat people of color without \nconsequence.   \n111 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 112 of 156\n \nCity And RPD Officials Are Deliberately Indifferent To, And Complicit In,  \nThe Widespread Unconstitutional Abuses By RPD Officers. \n355.  As Mayor WARREN has admitted: โInstitutional structural racism led to Daniel \nPrudeโs death. I wonโt deny it. I stand before it and I call for justice upon it.โ But those words \nring hollow to the countless Black and brown people in Rochester who have watched WARREN \nand other City officials for years take no action to curb violence by officers against communities \nof color.  \n356.  City Officials and the RPD have instead maintained a custom or practice of a \nโcode of silence,โ pursuant to which officer misconductโincluding excessive force, \nmanufacturing of false charges, racial discrimination, and the use of racial epithets or other \nderogatory languageโis routinely not reported by fellow officers or disciplined or held \naccountable by the Department. To the contrary, officers acting pursuant to the code customarily \nengage in misconduct themselves to cover up misconduct they witnessed by a fellow officer. \nPolice brutality in particular is indicative of a โcode of silenceโ because it often occurs in the \npresence of, or with the knowledge of, other officers. \n357.  By the time of Mr. Prudeโs death, it was clear to the RPD and City Officials that \nthis pervasive โcode of silenceโ was leading officers to engage in race-based, unlawful conduct. \nNevertheless, City and RPD Officials failed to take any necessary steps to remedy the \nDepartmentโs rampant culture of both engaging in abuses and affirmatively shielding fellow \nofficers from any accountability. That is because City Officials and RPD supervisors are \nthemselves complicit inโand a core part ofโthe Departmentโs โcode of silenceโ  \n358.  On March 12, 2021, the Final Report of the Independent Investigation into the \nCityโs Response to the Death of Daniel Prude was published. The Investigation entailed six \nmonthsโ worth of document review and the depositions of thirteen critical witnesses, including \n112 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 113 of 156\n \nDefendants WARREN and SINGLETARY. The Final Report concludes that City Officials \nsuppressed information about the arrest and death of Daniel Prude from Mr. Prudeโs family and \nfrom the public. And that City Officials, including WARREN, subsequently made statements \nthat were not truthful about the extent and timing of their knowledge of these circumstances. \n359.  Internally the RPD and City cited concerns that publicly releasing the videoโ\nwhich clearly shows RPD officers joking and laughing while Mr. Prude asphyxiatesโโmight \nspark civil unrestโ in Rochester. Senior Officials also expressed concern that they would lose \ntheir jobs if the video were to be released.  \n360.  In other words, consistent with past practice of intentional cover up and allowing \nofficers at all levels to act with almost complete impunity, City Officials and the RPD were \nconcerned not with public transparency or accountability but with conspiring to suppress the \nfootage and protect the officers and the Department. City Officials and RPD Defendants took \nseveral overt steps in furtherance of that conspiracy.  \n361.  For example, although Mr. Prudeโs family was legally entitled to the footage after \nsubmitting a FOIL request on April 3, 2020, RPD placed pressure on the Cityโs Law Department \nto withhold the footageโknowing it had no lawful basis to do so. \n362.  Further, though it was evident to City Officials that there was no lawful basis to \nwithhold the footage, they nonetheless engaged in other tactics to prevent its release including, \nfor instance, telling Mr. Prudeโs attorney he had to submit a HIPPA Authorization Form, which \nwas not legally required for disclosure, to unnecessarily delay the Cityโs response. \n363.  In the meantime, the Cityโwith WARRENโs knowledgeโattempted to settle Mr. \nPrudeโs case before releasing the footage to his family. But the footage was inadvertently sent to \nMr. Prudeโs lawyer.  \n113 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 114 of 156\n \n364.  A few weeks prior, on July 13, 2020, the RPD quietly updated its departmental \npolicy on usage of the PepperBall Launching System (โPLSโ). Specifically, the Department \namended the policy to allow officers on the patrol division to use the PLS. Prior to this \namendment, only officers on the Special Weapons and Tactics (โSWATโ) team were eligible to \nuse PLS. The RPD did not update the policy in any other way.  \n365.  Under RPD General Order 630, an officer is ineligible to join the SWAT team if \nhe has โany instance of sustained excessive forceโ or โseriousโ misconduct in his disciplinary \nhistory. The Patrol Division (or Mobile Field Force team) does not have any such eligibility \nrequirement.  \n366.  On information and belief, the Department updated this policy to ensure more \nofficers could (and would) be able to use the PLS in anticipation of protests after the suppressed \nfootage was released. By removing any โdisciplinary history check,โ the Department knew or \nhad reason to know that RPD officers would use excessive force when engaging with \nprotestersโwhich they did. \n367.  Defendant WILLIAM BAKER is one such officer. In 2016, BAKER was \nassigned to police the Rochester BLM protests. He was subsequently investigated by PSS after \nseveral news outlets provided video footage depicting him using force against two different \nprotesters. The PSS investigation determined that BAKER: (1) used excessive force on an \nindividual who was not resisting by โdirecting two or three jabs to [his] upper bodyโ; (2) failed \nto document his use of force as required by department policy; and (3) undertook โunnecessaryโ \nactions that โwere impetuous and committed with haste,โ specifically raising his baton to head-\nlevel and directing the crowd to โGet the fuck backโ and โBack the fuck up.โ BAKER was \nsuspended for just three days as a result.  \n114 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 115 of 156\n \n368.  Despite a sustained finding of excessive forceโin the context of a BLM protest \nno lessโBAKER was outfitted with a PLS on September 3, 2020. Had the Department not \nchanged its policy to expand officer access to the PLS in July 2020, BAKER would not have \nbeen eligible for the SWAT team and so would not have had access to the PepperBall Launching \nSystem which, upon information and belief, he used to inflict illegal force on protesters.  \n369.  The Cityโs practice of protecting RPD officers, like BAKER, rather than its \ncitizens has directly contributed to the culture of insularity, acceptance, and callousness that \npermeates the Rochester Police Department.  \nโBUSINESS AS USUALโ \n \n370.  Although Mayor WARREN and other City officials are again โtalking the talkโ of \npolice reform, while the eyes of the world are on them, the City and RPD have paid similar lip \nservice over the past 40 years, while meaningful, lasting reform has never come. If anything, \nthese last seven months have confirmed that the Cityโs promise of change is yet again hollow: \neven with a new interim Police Chief and command staff, the Department either cannot or will \nnot fix itself. \n371.  On January 29, 2021, seven RPD officers responded to a call about a family \ndispute. When they arrived, a nine-year-old Black girl was crying and emotionally distraught. \nRather than comfort her, RPD officers chased her, threw her on the snow-covered ground, and \nhandcuffed herโeven though she was not under arrest. Officers including Defendants PASZKO \nand VANBREDERODE then forced her into the back of a patrol car, where the child was \nsobbing and begging officers to let her see her parent. One officer told her, โStop acting like a \nchild,โ to which the nine-year-old responded: โI am a child.โ \n115 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 116 of 156\n \n372.  Even though she was not under arrest, clearly in emotional distress, and restrained \nin the back of a police car, RPD Officer Alexander Lombard decided to pepper spray her at \npoint-blank range. None of the other officers, including Defendants PASZKO and \nVANBREDERODE who were standing right there, intervened at any point to stop this excessive \nuse of force against a young girl. She was taken to Rochester General for treatment.  \n373.  The next day, RPD issued a press release stating the officer was โrequiredโฆto \ntake the minor to the groundโ and โrequiredโฆto use an irritant on the minorโ because she \nโrefusedโ to place her feet in the patrol car.  \n374.  While the interim Chief acknowledged in a public hearing that the Department \nshould not have used the word โrequiredโ about the officerโs actions, she refused to answer \nwritten questions about the incident from the PABโsuch as โWhat RPD policies, procedures, or \nwritten directives require an officer to use pepper sprayโฆon someone refusing to place her feet \nin a patrol car?โ and โDo you believe it can it ever be appropriate for an officer to pepper spray \nor mace a nine-year-old?โโspecifically citing concerns that putting those answers in writing \nโwould cause major risk for the city.โ  \n375.  Two months agoโ54 years after the NAACP first sought a court order in 1967 to \nban the RPD from using pepper spray because the organization feared officers would utilize it \nโdisproportionately in the Black community of Rochesterโโthe NAACP condemned RPD \nofficersโ use of pepper spray on the young Black girl and recognized that meaningful change has \nyet to occur: โAfter all the incidents, investigations and reforms in years past, the result is a nine-\nyear-old child being pepper sprayed. We need serious police reform now or these types of police \nincidents will continue to occur.โ  \n116 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 117 of 156\n \n376.  Notably, one year prior in May 2020, VANBREDERODE handcuffed a 10-year-\nold Black girl by the side of a highway while conducting a routine traffic stop with PASZKO. \nAfter the incident, the New York Civil Liberties Union issued a statement on the RPDโs pattern \nof using force on Black youth, again calling out โsystemic bias in the behavior of officers on the \nforceโฆ. [A] child was placed in handcuffs.โ And the need for reform: โWe need answers, \naccountability, and change now.โ But neither officer was disciplined.  \n \n \n \n377.  Sadly, but predictably, less than a month after RPD officers sprayed the 9-year-\nold girl, Defendants VANBREDERODE and PASZKO were involved in another horrifying \nencounter during which they illegally pepper sprayed a Black mother with her three-year-old \nchild present. The woman was stopped by Defendants, who suspected her of shoplifting. She \nwillingly displayed the contents of her bag and was not placed under arrest. But when she left the \nscene, Defendants pursued herโ PASZKO wrestled her to the ground, while \nVANBREDERODE dragged away her sobbing toddler. When the woman got up to reach for her \ndaughter, who was crying inconsolably, PASZKO pepper sprayed the mother and took her to the \nground a second time. Her three-year-old daughter was only feet away when PASZKO sprayed. \n117 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 118 of 156\n \n378.  At a news conference the following day, Chief HERRIOTT-SULLIVAN stated: \nโWe do have policies on the use of things such as pepper sprayโฆif a person is physically \nresisting then youโre safe on pepper spray usage.โ PASZKO was placed on administrative \nleaveโbut was not suspendedโdespite his involvement in both incidents. \n379.  Less than a month before this lawsuit was filed, RPD also answered the \nheartbreaking but inescapable question posed by Joe Prude after his brother Danielโs death: \nโHow many more brothers gotta die for society to understand that this needs to stop?โ As an all-\ntoo foreseeable result of the RPDโs entirely feckless system of supervision and discipline, the \nanswer is: at least one more.  \n380.  On March 10, 2021, Defendant MATTHEW DRAKE responded to the Open \nDoor Mission where he found Tyshon Jones, a 29-year-old Black man who was clearly in the \nmidst of a mental health crisis. DRAKE shot Mr. Jones five times. If the RPD had a functioning \nsystem of supervision and discipline, DRAKE would not have been employed that night, let \nalone on the streets interacting with civiliansโand Tyshon Jones may still be alive.  \n381.  In addition to his excessive use of force on protesters like Plaintiff MCINTYRE \nlast fall, DRAKE has a history of serious abuses: In 2013, he drove his police vehicle into a \ncrowd of 75 people and received a letter of reprimand. In 2015, he was involved in the brutal \nbeating of David Vann which was captured on film; he was neither investigated nor disciplined \nfor his involvement in the assault. Most recently, in 2019, he drove a 27-year-old woman home \nin his personal vehicle at 2:30 a.m., against her will and without notifying his supervisor or \nrecording the trip mileage. The PSS investigation concluded Drake โcreated unneeded stress and \nfear to the complainant.โ She testified in the investigation that she felt he intended on harming \n118 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 119 of 156\n \nher.  Yet Drake received only a โslap on the wristโ for this: a 7-day suspension with 3 days taken \nfrom forfeited vacationโsending a clear message that these illegal actions were acceptable. \n382.  In short, even with new leadership and increased scrutiny over the past year, the \nRPD is already back to โbusiness as usual.โ RPD officers continue to engage in flagrant, \nexcessive force against Black and brown citizens of Rochester because they know they can.  \n383.  Indeed, the 2017 report on the CRBโs impact since its inception in 1992 observed \nthe Board is nothing more than artifice designed to give the false impression that civilians have \nan avenue through which they can obtain justice when they have been mistreated by the RPD. \nThe report concludes: โThis system works for the bureaucratic institutions but not for the civilian \ncomplainants they purport to protect. Regardless of which chief or mayor was in power, the \nsystemโand the resultsโremained essentially unchanged.โ  \n384.  RPDโs Body Worn Camera Policy and training instructs that officers must \nactivate their camerasโno exceptionsโto record all mandatory events including arrests, mental \nhygiene arrests, detentions and stops of persons, and field interviews. Footage of such incidents \nmust be retained for 10 years. In other words, the City and RPD have access to video evidence of \nevery arrest and use-of-force incident by RPD officers since they were outfitted with body worn \ncameras. Last fall, in light of the serious questions raised by Daniel Prudeโs homicide and the \nmisleading account of events given by RPD officers and then-Chief SINGLETARY, Deputy \nMayor Smith called for a review of all past body worn camera and other video footage related to \nuse-of-force incidents by RPD officers. Although the City has had the means, both before and \nsince Mr. Prudeโs homicide, to audit this footage, they have not taken even this obvious and \navailable step toward identifying officers who are using unconstitutional force.  \n119 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 120 of 156\n \n385.  Absent external enforcement, the system will not change itself: to date, the \nDepartment has not fired or disciplined any of the officers known to have engaged in the use of \nexcessive force against Daniel Prude or any of the officers who engaged in blatant displays of \nforce during the September 2020 protests, including those captured on video. After the protests, \nin line with the Departmentโs institutionalized code of silence, then-Chief SINGLETARY told \nCity Council that no RPD officer had reported a colleague for misconduct in connection with the \nprotests. And when asked about the Departmentโs plan for addressing officers who directly \ntargeted demonstrators with pepper balls, Chief HERRIOTT-SULLIVAN punted that \nresponsibility to the citizens, responding that they may request body camera footage through \nFOIL and, if anyone believes that PLS was used in a manner that โdid not adhere to policies and \nprocedures,โ he or she may file a PSS complaint.  \n386.  Notably, the statements made to date by the Mayor and the Department about \nโchanging the cultureโ of the RPD do not include any discussion about implementing an internal \ndisciplinary mechanism that imposes meaningful disciplinary and remedial actions on officers \nwho engage in excessive force. The Cityโs proposed response to Governor Cuomoโs Executive \nOrder 203 on Police Reform also omits any commitment to such a mechanism. The Cityโs \nproposals instead include aspirational or already-required goals like โexploring a pilot program \nfor providing mindfulness-based de-escalation, anti-racism training,โ โadvocating for NYS to \ninstitute a statewide police officer licensing or decertification program,โ or โreleasing \ncomprehensive statistics on the RPDโs internal investigations, as required by law.โ  \n387.  In December 2020, the PAB submitted a comprehensive plan to Mayor \nWARREN and the City in response to Executive Order 203โs mandate that the City โreimagineโ \npolicing. That proposal included a requirement that officers known to support white supremacist \n120 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 121 of 156\n \norganizations be terminatedโa central demand by community members. Months later, in \nFebruary 2021, the City conducted two closed-door sessionsโin contravention of Governor \nCuomoโs instruction that meetings be accessible to the publicโ to formulate an official plan. \nWARRENโs proposed plan did not include any termination provision for officers known to \nsupport white supremacist organizations. The Democrat & Chronicle requested minutes from \nthese meetings, which were not livestreamed. The City denied that request. In March 2021, the \nCity Council edited the Mayorโs proposed plan to include the termination provision, but the \nMayor remains the top City officials in charge of the police department.  \n388.  As part of its purported โreformโ efforts, the RPD recently promulgated two new \npolicies. One bans its officers from using chokeholds except in โextreme circumstances where \ndeadly physical force is authorized.โ But as an RPD spokesperson explained, officers have never \nbeen trained to do chokeholds and the policy is โreally semantics.โ New York State also \ncriminalized the use of a chokehold resulting in serious injury or death in June 2020. \n389.  The RPDโs second policy instructs that officers have an obligation to intervene to \nprevent the โunreasonable use of force or other misconductโ by fellow officers. But RPD officers \nhave long been trained that โ[a]n officer that does nothing to intervene in an excessive use of \nforce event may be found just as culpable as the officer who loses control.โ Yet RPD officers \nhave and continue to stand by while other officers beat citizens of color and then, in keeping with \nthe Departmentโs institutionalized code of silence, failed to report their fellow officersโoften \naffirmatively covering for them instead.  \n390.  As recent events in Rochester have made clear, in keeping with the Cityโs \ndecades-long practice of paying lip service to change while continuing to abuse Black and brown \ncitizens, token policies without disciplinary consequences will not change RPDโs racist, violent \n121 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 122 of 156\n \npattern of policing. RPD officers have repeatedly and flagrantly flouted their constitutional \nobligations without consequence and continue to do so today.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n \n391.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Rule 23(a), and (b)(2), and (b)(3) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of Plaintiffs, and those similarly situated, all of whom \nhave been subjected to excessive force by law enforcement officials as a result of the policies, \npractices, customs, and deliberate indifference of the Defendants described above.  \n392.  Named Plaintiffs ANTHONY HALL, STANLEY MARTIN, NICHOLAS \nROBERTSON, DEVORAH CHATMAN, REYNALDO DEGUZMAN, WINONA MILLER, \nDYNASTY BUGGS, and FTP ROC bring this action pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated (the โFirst \nPlaintiff Classโ) from April 5, 2018 to present (the โFirst Class Periodโ) as a result of the \npolicies, practices, customs, and deliberate indifference that encouraged the use of more frequent \nand greater levels of force against people of color because of their race. \n393.  To be clear, the First Plaintiff Class is seeking only injunctive relief under \nRule 23(b)(2).  \n394.  The First Plaintiff Class should be certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure because, as explained in more detail below, the Defendants \nhave acted on grounds generally applicable to the First Plaintiff Class, in engaging in the \naforementioned practices and failing to correct the unconstitutional policies thereby making \nclass-wide declaratory and injunctive relief appropriate.   \n395.  As described, the First Plaintiff Class, throughout the First Class Period, were \nsubject to more frequent and greater levels of force than their white counterparts during police \n122 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 123 of 156\n \ninteractions throughout the City of Rochester.  This disproportionate treatment was the result of \nthe policies, practices, and customs of the RPD Defendants and others at the RPD, the CITY, and \nthe deliberate indifference to those policies by the City officials, specifically LOVELY ANN \nWARREN and LAโRON SINGLETARY, who were responsible for the creation, \nimplementation, supervision and/or deliberate indifference of those policies, practices, and \ncustoms during the First Class Period,  \n396.  Given that the above-described policies, practices, and customs are already \nlargely corroborated by statistical analysis, thousands of hours of video from police body-worn \ncamera data, thousands of use-of-force reports, and drone and other footage capturing police-\ncivilian use-of-force encounters in Rochester throughout the First Class Period, the exact number \nof members of the First Plaintiff Class is unknown to Plaintiffs at this time, but can be \nascertained through appropriate class discovery, and are reasonably believed to number in the \nthousands.  As a result, the First Plaintiff Class satisfies the standard for numerosity. \n397.  The First Plaintiff Class also satisfies the standard for commonality as it claims \nthat people of color suffered more frequent and greater levels of force than their white \ncounterparts at the hands of RPD officers during the First Class Period.  Statistical analysis, \namong other evidence like use of force reports, establishes this disparate treatment.  Whether that \nevidence establishes a statistically significant disparity in treatment is a question of law that can \nbe answered on a class wide basis.  There will be no need for mini trials.   \n398.  If the statistical and other evidence establishes an unconstitutional disparity, \npolice body worn camera footage, use-of-force reports, drone, and other surveillance footage \nfrom within the First Class Period will easily determine whether any purported class member \nindeed qualifies for the class.   \n123 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 124 of 156\n \n399.  Prospective class members known to named Plaintiffs ANTHONY HALL, \nSTANLEY MARTIN, NICHOLAS ROBERTSON, DEVORAH CHATMAN, REYNALDO \nDEGUZMAN, WINONA MILLER, DYNASTY BUGGS, and FTP ROC or subsequently \nidentified by the same through the above-mentioned means may be notified of the pendency of \nthis action by mail using contact information maintained by the Defendants or through \nreasonable and appropriate publication.  \n400.  But there are additional common questions of fact and law that meet the standard \nfor commonality.  Among the additional questions of law and fact common to the First Plaintiff \nClass are: \na.  Whether the CITY has maintained policies, practices, and/or customs of using \nthe more frequent and greater levels of force against people of color; \nb.  Whether those policies, practices, and/or customs of using such force are in \nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment; \nc.  Whether the CITY has trained, supervised, and meaningfully disciplined RPD \nofficers who engage in such force; \nd.  Whether the City has been deliberately indifferent to the use of such force by \nRPD officers; and \ne.  Whether the Cityโs deliberate indifference violates the Fourteenth Amendment \nand federal law. \n401.  The named Plaintiffs ANTHONY HALL, STANLEY MARTIN, NICHOLAS \nROBERTSON, DEVORAH CHATMAN, REYNALDO DEGUZMAN, WINONA MILLER, \nDYNASTY BUGGS, and FTP ROCโs claims also satisfy the standard for typicality as the their \nclaims and each class memberโs claims arise from the same policies, patterns, and practices (and \n124 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 125 of 156\n \nthe CITYโs deliberate indifference to the same) and each has suffered injuries of varying severity \nas a result of those policies, patterns, and practices and the CITYโs deliberate indifference to the \nsame.  While some injuries, for example broken noses and ribs or loss of sight, may be more \nsevere than pepper ball shots to the neck at close range, each prospective class member has \nsuffered physical injury resulting in bodily harm, physical pain, fear, humiliation, \nembarrassment, severe discomfort, mental and emotional distress, and psychological harm with \nphysical manifestations like physical anxiety, back and neck pain, tremors, and irregular \nmenstrual cycles.   \n402.  As a direct and proximate cause of the conduct described herein, the First Plaintiff \nClass has been denied their constitutional, statutory, and legal rights as stated herein.  \n403.  Named Plaintiffs ANTHONY HALL, STANLEY MARTIN, NICHOLAS \nROBERTSON, DEVORAH CHATMAN, REYNALDO DEGUZMAN, WINONA MILLER, \nDYNASTY BUGGS, and FTP ROC also meet the standard for adequacy to represent the class.  \nNeither has interests antagonistic to or in conflict with those of the First Plaintiff Class as each \nare members of the class themselves.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe members of the Class and have retained a team of counsel competent and experienced in civil \nrights and class action litigation, including Baker & Hostetler LLP, Neufeld Scheck & Brustin, \nLLP, Easton Thompson Kasperek Shiffrin LLP, Roth & Roth, LLP, and the Law Office of \nJoshua Moskovitz, P.C.  Together, the undersigned have more than 100 years of combined \nlitigation experience and have the resources to prosecute this action to its conclusion. \n404.  Since the First Plaintiff Class is only an injunctive class, predominance is not a \nfactor.  Nevertheless, the First Plaintiff Class satisfies the standard for predominance as the \ncommon questions of law and fact predominate over any questions affecting individual \n125 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 126 of 156\n \nmembers.  For example, the question of whether RPD has a policy, practice, or custom of using \nmore frequent and greater levels of force against people of color predominates over the extent of \nthe injuries suffered by any individual class member.  Likewise, the question of whether the \nCITY and the City Officials have been deliberately indifferent to such policies, practices and/or \ncustoms by failing to train, supervise and discipline its officers predominates over the extent of \ndamages those actions have caused some class members as opposed to others. \n405.  A class action is superior to all other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy since joinder of all members is impracticable.  Judicial economy \nwould not be served by thousands of plaintiffs separately filing cases to determine the same \nquestions of law and fact.  This would risk conflicting decisions and, in any event, would not be \ncost effective. The expense and burden of prosecuting a claim for the vindication of civil rights \nmake it impossible for certain potential class members to individually redress the wrongs done to \nthem.  Accordingly, in the absence of a class action, assuming the above common questions of \nlaw and fact are answered in the affirmative, a more fortunate plaintiff may be able to redress \nwrongs perpetrated against her given her ability to obtain the undersigned team of counsel, while \nless fortunate victims will have no access to redress.  \n406.  Separately, Plaintiffs also bring this action pursuant to Rule 23(a), (b)(2), and \n(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a second class, consisting of all \npersons who were subjected to excessive force by law enforcement officials in the City of \nRochester during the George Floyd and Daniel Prude protests that occurred between May 30, \n2020 and April 6, 2021 (the โSecond Class Periodโ) as a result of the same policies, practices, \ncustoms, and deliberate indifference of the Defendants described above (the โSecond Plaintiff \nClassโ).  \n126 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 127 of 156\n \n407.  The Second Plaintiff Class includes a damages class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) \n(โDamages Plaintiff Classโ) and an injunctive relief class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) (โInjunctive \nRelief Plaintiff Classโ) (collectively, the โSecond Plaintiff Classโ). \n408.  The Damages Plaintiff Class should be certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) \nbecause, as expressed in more detail below, questions of law or fact common to class members \npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and a class action is superior \nto other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.  \n409.  The Injunctive Relief Class should be certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) because, \nas explained above and in more detail below, the Defendants have acted on grounds generally \napplicable to the class, by engaging in the aforementioned practices and failing to correct the \nunconstitutional policies thereby making class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief appropriate.   \n410.  To be clear, the Second Plaintiff Class is seeking damages under Rule 23(b)(3) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and injunctive relief under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure. \n411.  The Second Plaintiff Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable. As described in detail above, as a result of the execution of the challenged \npolicies, practices, and customs by the RPD Defendants and others at the RPD, in cooperation \nwith Sheriffโs Deputies from the Monroe County Sheriffโs Office, during the April 2, 2020 to \nApril 6, 2020 protests, and the creation, implementation, supervision and/or deliberate \nindifference of those policies, practices, and customs by LOVELY ANN WARREN, LAโRON \nSINGLETARY, the other RPD protest policymakers and the CITY; and SHERIFF TODD \nBAXTER, the COUNTY OF MONROE, and the MONROE COUNTY SHERIFFโS OFFICE \nduring the Second Class Period, the exact number of members of the Second Plaintiff Class is \n127 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 128 of 156\n \nunknown to Plaintiffs at this time and can be ascertained only through appropriate class \ndiscovery. \n412.  As described above, thousands of protestors, from all walks of lifeโfrom elected \nofficials to civiliansโexercised their constitutional rights to protest the unlawful killing George \nFloyd and then the unlawful killing and subsequent cover up of the killing of Daniel Prude. The \npolice response to these peaceful protests was extremely violent and reflected an indignance \npublic officials and civilians, particularly civilians of color, would be bold enough to challenge \nRPDโs actions, no matter how civil or peaceful those challenges may have been.  \n413.  Given the above described policies, practices, and customs, already largely \ncorroborated by the hundreds of hours of video from the police body-worn camera data from the \nprotests, the hundreds of use-of-force reports filed by police that reported their use of force \nduring the protests, and drone and other footage capturing police-civilian use-of-force encounters \nin Rochester throughout the protests, Plaintiffs reasonably believe that the number of potential \nclass members are in the thousands. As a result, the Second Plaintiff Class satisfies the standard \nfor numerosity. \n414.  The Second Plaintiff Class also satisfies the standard for commonality. Each class \nmember, including Plaintiffs, was subject to excessive force in the form of (1) close range \nchemical weapons exposure; (2) close range shots with tear gas canisters (the canister itself, in \naddition to the subsequent spread of the tear gas); and/or (3) pepper balls fired indiscriminately \ninto crowds, at close range, and at vulnerable body parts, among other types of blatantly \nexcessive force.  Whether these actions constitute excessive force is a question of law that can be \nanswered on a class wide basis. \n128 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 129 of 156\n \n415.  If those acts are determined to constitute excessive force when used upon \ncivilians, unarmed and defenseless as they wereโhiding themselves behind umbrellas to the best \nof their abilitiesโpolice body worn camera footage, use-of-force reports, drone, and other \nsurveillance footage from the protests will easily determine whether any purported class member \nqualifies for the class.   \n416.  Prospective class members known to Plaintiffs or subsequently identified by \nPlaintiffs through the above-mentioned means may be notified of the pendency of this action by \nmail using contact information maintained by the Defendants or through reasonable and \nappropriate publication.  \n417.  But there are additional common questions of fact and law that meet the standard \nfor commonality.  Among the additional questions of law and fact common to the First Plaintiff \nClass are: \na.  Whether the above referenced force used by Defendants at the protests is \nexcessive; \nb.  Whether the CITY has maintained policies, practices, and/or customs of using \nsuch force during protests; \nc.  Whether the CITYโs policies, practices, and/or customs of using such force \nare in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments; \nd.  Whether the CITY has trained, supervised, and meaningfully disciplined RPD \nofficers who engage in such force; \ne.  Whether the CITY or City Officials directed or were deliberately indifferent \nto the use of such force by RPD officers during the protests; \n129 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 130 of 156\n \nf.  Whether the CITYโs direction of or deliberate indifference to the use of such \nforce violates the Fourteenth Amendment and federal law; \ng.  Whether MONROE COUNTY SHERIFFโS OFFICE, led by SHERIFF \nTODD BAXTER, engaged in the same policies, practices, and/or customs of \nusing the above described force during the protests, under its own direction, \nSHERIFF BAXTERโs direction, or the direction of RPD, the CITY, or City \nOfficials; \nh.  Whether COUNTY OF MONROE, MONROE COUNTY SHERIFFโS \nOFFICE, or SHERIFF BAXTER maintained policies, practices, and/or \ncustoms of using the above-mentioned force during protests;  \ni.  Whether the COUNTY OF MONROE, MONROE COUNTY SHERIFFโS \nOFFICE, or SHERIFF BAXTER trained, supervised, and meaningfully \ndisciplined Sheriffโs Deputies who engaged in such force during the protests; \nj.  Whether the COUNTY OF MONROE, MONROE COUNTY SHERIFFโS \nOFFICE, or SHERIFF BAXTER directed or was deliberately indifferent to \nthe use of such force by Sheriffโs Deputies who engaged in such force during \nthe protests. \n418.  Plaintiffsโ claims also satisfy the standard for typicality as Plaintiffs and each \nclass memberโs claims arise from the same policies, patterns and practices (and the CITYโs, City \nOfficialsโ, COUNTY OF MONROE, MONROE COUNTY SHERIFFโS OFFICE, or SHERIFF \nBAXTERโs deliberate indifference to the same) and each has suffered physical injuries of \nvarying severity as a result of those policies, patterns, and practices and the CITYโs, City \nOfficialsโ, COUNTY OF MONROEโs, MONROE COUNTY SHERIFFโS OFFICEโs, or \n130 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 131 of 156\n \nSHERIFF BAXTERโs deliberate indifference to the same. While some physical injuries, were \nmore severe than others each prospective class member has suffered physical injury resulting in \nbodily harm, pain, fear, humiliation, embarrassment, severe discomfort, mental and emotional \ndistress, and psychological harm with physical manifestations like physical anxiety, back and \nneck pain, tremors, and irregular menstrual cycles.   \n419.  As a direct and proximate cause of the conduct described herein by the RPD \nDefendants, CITY, City Officials, COUNTY OF MONROE, MONROE COUNTY SHERIFFโS \nOFFICE, and/or SHERIFF BAXTERโs deliberate indifference to the same, the Second Plaintiff \nClass has been denied their constitutional, statutory, and legal rights as stated herein, and have \nsuffered general and special damages including but not limited to the injuries described above \nand other damages in an amount according to proof.  \n420.  As to adequacy of Plaintiffs to represent the class, Plaintiffs have no interests \nantagonistic to or in conflict with those of the Second Plaintiff Class.  Plaintiffs will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the members of the Class and have retained a team of counsel \ncompetent and experienced in civil rights and class action litigation, including Baker & Hostetler \nLLP, Neufeld Scheck & Brustin, LLP, Easton Thompson Kasperek Shiffrin LLP, Roth & Roth, \nLLP, and the Law Office of Joshua Moskovitz, P.C.  Together, the undersigned have more than \n100 years of combined litigation experience and have the resources to prosecute this action to its \nconclusion. \n421.  The Second Plaintiff Class satisfies the standard for predominance as the common \nquestions of law and fact predominate over any questions affecting individual members.  As \nexpressed above, the question of whether dousing defenseless civilians with chemical weapons \nto saturation, shooting them close range in the face with tear gas canisters, and/or shooting them \n131 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 132 of 156\n \nindiscriminately with pepper balls at close range, and at vulnerable body parts constitutes \nexcessive force predominates over the extent of the injuries suffered by any individual class \nmember.  Likewise, the question of whether the CITY, City Officials, COUNTY OF MONROE, \nMONROE COUNTY SHERIFFโS OFFICE, or SHERIFF BAXTER maintained policies, \npractices, and/or customs of using such force and have been deliberately indifferent to such \npolicies, practices and/or customs by failing to train, supervise and discipline its officers and/or \nsheriffโs deputies predominates over the extent of damages those actions have caused some class \nmembers as opposed to others. \n422.  A class action is superior to all other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy since joinder of all members is impracticable.  Judicial economy \nwould not be served by thousands of protestors separately filing cases to determine the same \nquestions of law and fact.  This would risk conflicting decisions and, in any event, would not be \ncost effective for anyone.  The expense and burden of prosecuting a claim for the vindication of \ncivil rights make it impossible for certain potential class members to individually redress the \nwrongs done to them.  Accordingly, in the absence of a class action, assuming the above \ncommon questions of law and fact are answered in favor of the plaintiffs, a more fortunate \nplaintiff may be able to redress her wrongs given her ability to obtain the undersigned team of \ncounsel, while less fortunate victims will have no access to redress. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF: \nMunicipal Liability \n \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 Arising From the RPDโs Practice of Using Disproportionate \nForce Against People of Color in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution \n(Against the CITY) \n \n132 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 133 of 156\n \n423.  Plaintiffs re-allege each and every allegation contained in the above paragraphs \nwith the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein. \n424.  As detailed above, Charles LoFaso, PhDโa former RPD investigatorโanalyzed \nRPD Subject Resistance Reports for use-of-force incidents between 2011 and 2016 and found \nthat RPD officersโ use of force was overwhelmingly against people of color: of the 3,368 \nincidents reviewed, 2,632 incidents, or 78%, involved a person of color.  \n425.  LoFaso further concluded that RPD officers โuse force more often and at more \nsevere levels only when interacting with citizens in neighborhoods with higher percentages \nof Black and Hispanic residents.โ  Because the RPD Subject Resistance Reports that LoFaso \nanalyzed rely on officers to self-report data, LoFaso concluded the โfrequency and severity of \nforce may be higher in minority neighborhoods than the results suggest.โ \n426.  The City of Rochester has a widespread and longstanding practice of RPD \nofficers use disproportionate force against people of colorโthey use force more frequently and \nthey use more severe amounts of force against people of color โthan they do against white \npeople.  \n427.  Upon information and belief, the CITY and the RPD has been using Subject \nResistance Reports and keeping internal data on use-of-force incidents for decades. Thus, the \nCITY and RPD knew that RPD officers use force more frequently, and use more severe amounts \nof force, against people of color.  \n428.  The CITY and RPD was deliberately indifferent to the widespread and decades-\nlong racially disparate use of force by RPD officers, as they knew or should have known that \nRPD officers use force more frequently, and use more severe amounts of force, against people of \ncolor, but they did nothing to stop and/or remedy this unconstitutional practice. \n133 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 134 of 156\n \n429.  People of color are members of a constitutionally protected class with a clearly \nestablished right to be free from racially motivated actions by Defendants. \n430.  In committing the acts and omissions complained of herein, Defendants acted \nunder color of state lawโindividually, in concert, and through a conspiracyโto deprive people \nof color of the rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, \nincluding the right to equal protection of the laws, to be free from discrimination. \n431.  The force Defendants used against Black and brown individuals was motivated by \na discriminatory purpose to deprive them of the equal protection of the law, equal privileges and \nimmunities under the law, and due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution.  \n432.  All of the wrongful acts or omissions complained of herein against Plaintiffs and \nputative class members were carried out by the individually named and unnamed RPD officers \npursuant to: (a) formal policies, rules, and procedures of Defendant CITY; (b) actions and \ndecisions by Defendant CITYโS policymaking agents, including, but not limited to Defendants \nWARREN and SINGLETARY; (c) customs, practices, and usage of the RPD that are so \nwidespread and pervasive as to constitute de facto policies accepted, encouraged, condoned, \nratified, sanctioned, and/or enforced by Defendants CITY, WARREN, SINGLETARY, and other \npolicymaking officials; (d) Defendant CITYโs deliberate indifference to Plaintiffsโ rights secured \nby the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, as evidenced \nby they CITYโS failures, and the failures of the other policymaking agents, to train, supervise, \nand discipline RPD officers, despite full knowledge of the their wrongful acts against Plaintiffs \nand other putative class members, as described herein. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF: \nMunicipal Liability \n134 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 135 of 156\n \n \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 Arising From the Cityโs Deliberate Indifference and Failure to \nDiscipline RPD Officers Who Use Excessive Force \n(Against the CITY) \n \n433.  Plaintiffs re-allege each and every allegation contained in the above paragraphs \nwith the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein. \n434.  As detailed herein, for decades, Defendant CITY and the RPD have deliberately \nand systemically failed to discipline RPD Officers who use force without justification, even \nwhen said unlawful use of force is captured on video. Instead, they have created a culture that \nencourages officers to use excessive force by rewarding and promoting the most violent and \nabusive officers.  \n435.  The need for said discipline was patently obvious, as numerous RPD officers, \nincluding the individually named RPD officers, have repeatedly used force without justification.  \n436.  As part of its policy and practice of deliberately failing to hold bad officers \naccountable, the CITY and the RPD have admitted in other litigation that it destroyed relevant \ndisciplinary records and use of force reports after it was on notice that said reports were relevant \nto that litigation; in some instances, individual Professional Standards Section files were \ndestroyed after the plaintiff served specific demands for those files by PSS number.  \n437.  The CITY and RPD have destroyed disciplinary records and use of force reports \nthat are relevant to Plaintiffsโ claims in this case.  \n438.  The CITY and RPD have admittedly destroyed blue light camera footage from \none or more nights of the protests, after counsel served a preservation letter specifically \ndemanding that said footage must be preserved. Notably, numerous RPD officers referenced the \nblue light camera footage in their Subject Resistance Reports from the night of September 3, \n2020 and other nights to justify using force against protesters.  \n135 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 136 of 156\n \n439.  The CITY and RPDโs brazen refusal to preserve video evidence of RPD officersโ \nuse of force against protesters, despite service of a preservation letter demanding said footage be \npreserved within the 30-day retention period, is an example of the CITYโs explicit policy of \nrefusing to investigate or discipline officers who use excessive force, even when said use of force \nis captured on video.  \n440.  The failure of the Defendant CITY and the RPD to maintain standards governing \nthe imposition of discipline when RPD officers use force without justification, even when the \nforce is captured on video, constitutes an unconstitutional municipal policy, practice, and/or \ncustom. \n441.  By failing to discipline officers who use force without justificationโeven when \nthe unlawfulness of the force used is demonstrated by clear video evidenceโthe Defendant \nCITY and the RPD have demonstrated their deliberate indifference to the constitutional \ndeprivations caused by RPD Officersโ repeated use of force without justification and their failure \nto accurately document use-of-force incidents. \n442.  CITY and RPD policymakers, including but not limited to, Defendants \nWARRAN and SINGLETARY, have known about the widespread practice of RPD officers \nusing force without justification, but have failed to take any affirmative steps to end the \npracticeโlike disciplining officers who use excessive force. \n443.  As documented herein, the decades-long failure of the Defendant CITY and RPD \nto discipline RPD officers who use excessive force has created a culture within the RPD where \nofficers are encouraged to use excessive force during routine interactions with individuals in the \nCity of Rochester, in violation of the Fourth and Fourteeth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution. \n136 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 137 of 156\n \n444.  As detailed herein, the decades-long failure of the Defendant CITY and RPD to \ndiscipline RPD officers who use excessive force caused the RPD and its officers to respond to \npeaceful protests against abusive policing practices. \n445.  The Cityโs use of violent, militarized police tactics against Black and brown \nprotesters and their allies was in line with their decades-long practice of suppressing police \ncritics through unconstitutional means. \n446.  As detailed herein, for decades, the City of Rochester has maintained unlawful \npolicies, practices and customs of failing to discipline officers who use excessive force, and \ninstead promoting and encouraging them to use excessive force. That culture of violence led \nthem to brutalize the Plaintiffs herein and attack racial justice protesters with military-grade \nweapons.  \n447.  All of the wrongful acts or omissions complained of herein against Plaintiffs and \nother putative class members were carried out by the individually named and unnamed RPD \nofficers pursuant to: (a) formal policies, rules, and procedures of Defendant CITY; (b) actions \nand decisions by Defendant CITYโS policymaking agents, including, but not limited to \nDefendants WARREN, SINGLETARY, and other policymaking officials; (c) customs, practices, \nand usage of the RPD that are so widespread and pervasive as to constitute de facto policies \naccepted, encouraged, condoned, ratified, sanctioned, and/or enforced by Defendants CITY, \nWARREN, SINGLETARY, and other policymaking officials; (d) Defendant CITYโs deliberate \nindifference to Plaintiffsโ rights secured by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United \nStates Constitution, as evidenced by they CITYโs failures, and the failures of the other \npolicymaking agents, to train, supervise, and discipline RPD officers, despite full knowledge of \nthe their wrongful acts against Plaintiffs and other protesters, as described herein. \n137 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 138 of 156\n \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF: \nMunicipal Liability \n \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for Defendantsโ Violations of Plaintiffsโ First, Fourth and \nFourteeth Amendment Rights At the Summer and Fall 2020 Racial Justice Protests  \n(Against the CITY) \n \n448.

In committing the acts and omissions complained of herein, Defendants acted \nunder color of state lawโindividually, in concert, and through a conspiracyโto deprive \nPlaintiffs of the rights protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n454.  Defendants (a) retaliated against Plaintiffs for engaging in speech and/or conduct \nprotected by the First Amendment, and (b) imposed restrictions on such protected speech and/or \nconduct that violated Plaintiffsโ First Amendment rights, including, but not limited to, falsely \narresting Plaintiffs, subjecting Plaintiffs to excessive force, selectively enforcing laws and \nregulations against Plaintiffs, and otherwise violating Plaintiffsโ rights and engaging in the acts \nand omissions complained of herein. \n455.  Defendants engaged in those and other acts and omissions complained of herein \nin retaliation for Plaintiffsโ protected speech and/or conduct. \n456.  Defendants engaged in the acts and omissions complained of herein in order to \nprevent Plaintiffs from continuing to engage in such protected speech and/or conduct. \n457.  Defendants engaged in the acts and omissions complained of herein in order to \nprevent and/or discourage Plaintiffs from engaging in similar protected conduct in the future. \n458.  Additionally, upon information and belif, Defendants CITY, SINGLETARY, \nFAVOR, DEARCOP, MONTINARELLI, LUCYSHYN, COUNTY, MCSO and BAXTER, \ndesigned and/or implemented policies and practices pursuant to which those Defendants who \nimplemented them subjected Plaintiffs to violations of the First Amendment rights. \n459.

Upon information and belief, Defendants engaged in the acts and omissions \ncomplained of herein with respect to Plaintiffsโ First Amendment retaliation claimsโincluding \nthe related municipal liability claims involving the adoption of policies, practices, and/or \ncustoms and/or related failures to train, supervise, and/or disciplineโin response to the \nperceived viewpoint and/or message expressed by Plaintiffs. \n461.  Upon information and belief, Defendants did not subject other protesters \nexpressing โBlue Lives Matterโ or other, similar, pro-police messages who were similarly \nsituated to Plaintiffs in terms of their conduct and/or its potential public ramifications to the \nconduct, policies, practices, and/or customs complained of herein. \n462.  Plaintiffs suffered actual chill in that they were prevented and/or deterred from or \nimpeded in participating in protected conduct; and/or suffered adverse effects on their protected \nspeech and/or conduct; and/or otherwise suffered some concrete harm(s). \n463.  Additionally, in many cases, Defendants apparently permitted, acquiesced in, \nand/or facilitated the speech and/or other expressive conduct in which Plaintiffs were engaging, \nbefore suddenly using force and/or making arrests, without first having given reasonable notice \nthat such force and/or arrest activity would result if Plaintiffs did not conduct themselves \ndifferently and/or disperse, as well as a meaningful opportunity to comply. \n464.  In addition to being retaliatory, the restrictions Plaintiffs complain of herein, \nwhich Defendants imposed on Plaintiffsโ First Amendment rights to participate in, observe, \nand/or stand nearby speech, conduct, association, and/or other expressive activities protected by \nthe First Amendment on the streets, were themselves regulations on Plaintiffsโ protected conduct. \n465.

In committing the acts and omissions complained of herein, Defendants acted \nunder color of state lawโindividually, in concert, and through a conspiracyโto deprive \nPlaintiffs of the rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, \nincluding the right to equal protection of the laws. \n469.  Defendants engaged in viewpoint discrimination against the Plaintiffs and other \nprotesters by attacking them and using brutal levels of force.  \n470.  These attacks were directed by RPD supervising officers, including \nSINGLETARY, FAVOR, DEARCOP, MONTINARELLI, LUCYSHYN, POTUCK and other \nofficers at the highest ranks of police leadership; and MCSO supervisors, including BAXTER \nand other officers at the hisght ranks of MCSO leadership. They were unprovoked and legally \nunjustified. And, they were undertaken in retaliation for the protestersโ messageโcalling for \ngreater police accountability, a reallocation of funding from away from police departments and \ninto Black and Latinx communities, the end of police brutality, and a recognition that Black \nLives Matter. \n142 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 143 of 156\n \n471.  In contrast, the RPD and MCSO has responded to other protests (including, in \nparticular, โBlue Lives Matterโ and other pro-police protests), where protesters were similarly \nsituated to Plaintiffs, with virtually no use-of-force, let alone such brutality. \n472.  Plaintiffs and other Black Lives Matter protesters were treated differently by \nDefendants than other similarly situated protesters (such as โBlue Lives Matterโ protesters) \nbased on the content of their message.  \n473.  The brutal force that was used against Plaintiffs and other protesters had a \ndiscriminatory effect and was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.  \n474.  As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiffs suffered injuries and damages. \n475.  The unlawful conduct of the individual defendants was willful, malicious, \noppressive, and/or reckless, and was of such a nature that punitive damages should be imposed \nagainst them. \nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF: \nExcessive Force \n \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for Defendantsโ Violations of Plaintiffsโ Rights Under the \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \n(Against all Defendants Other Than Dellasala) \n \n476.  Plaintiffs re-allege each and every allegation contained in the above paragraphs \nwith the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein. \n477.  Defendants used force against Plaintiffs that was unjustified and objectively \nunreasonable, taking into consideration the facts and circumstances that confronted Defendants. \n478.  Defendants used excessive force against peaceful protestors. In particular, \nDefendants engaged in the indiscriminate use of โless lethalโ weapons and baton strikes contrary \nto law. Members of the Plaintiff class who were shot with โrubber bulletsโ and struck with \nbatons were injured in a manner that evinced that Defendants applied force unlawfully. Many \n143 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 144 of 156\n \nindividuals were struck with rubber bullets in the face, head, shoulder and neck areas. Video \nfootage of various incidents shows officers shooting straight at peaceful protestors who posed no \nthreat to the police or the public. Similarly, individuals suffered baton strikes meant not to \ncompel people to retreat, but to injure and punish them on site. \n479.  In many cases, Plaintiffs and other protesters were subject to physical force and \nless-lethal projectiles without a means of escape or egress.  \n480.  The types and levels of force Defendants used against Plaintiffs were unjustified \nand objectively unreasonable, taking into consideration the facts and circumstances that \nconfronted Defendants. \n481.  In many cases, Defendants used types and levels of force against Plaintiffs and \nother protesters that were in contravention of, or inconsistent with, their policies and/or training.  \n482.  In many cases, Defendants failed to document, and/or require that fellow \nDefendants and/or other fellow officers document, uses of force in accordance with their policies \nand/or training. \n483.  In many cases, Defendants failed to activate their Body Worn Cameras to video \nrecord their uses of force in accordance with their policies and/or training.  \n484.  In many cases, Defendants failed to investigate incidents of which they were \naware or should have been aware in which members of the RPD and/or MCSO used excessive \nforce against Plaintiffs and other protesters. \n485.  Defendant City failed to discipline RPD members who used excessive force \nagainst Plaintiffs and other protesters. \n486.  Defendants COUNTY, MCSO and Baxter failed to discipline MCSO members \nwho used excessive force against Plaitniffs and other protesters. \n144 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 47   Filed 08/31/21   Page 145 of 156\n \n487.  In many cases, Defendants used force against Plaintiffs based on their position in \nor proximity to a perceived group, without first having given the perceived group clearly \ncommunicated, prior notice as well as a meaningful opportunity to comply with police orders \nand/or dissociate with the perceived group. \n488.  In many cases, Defendants used types of force, such as by deploying pepper spray \nand indiscriminately shooting pepper balls, that they knew, or should have known, would impact \nnumerous people at one time, and/or cause lasting pain, suffering, and/or injury, without making \nindividualized or otherwise appropriate determinations about whether those uses of force were \nnecessary, justified, or reasonable under the circumstances. \n489.  Plaintiffs and other protesters were seized when Defendants deployed โless-\nlethalโ forceโincluding pepper spray, tear gas, pepper balls, and physical forceโto disperse \nthem and other protesters.  \n490.  As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiffs suffered injuries and damages. \n491.  The unlawful conduct of the individual defendants was willful, malicious, \noppressive, and/or reckless, and was of such a nature that punitive damages should be imposed \nagainst them. \nEIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF: \nCivil Rights Conspiracy \n \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1985  \n(Against CITY, WARREN, SINGLETARY, COUNTY, MCSO, BAXTER) \n \n492.

In furtherance of the conspiracy Defendants engaged in and facilitated numerous \novert acts as described above. \n495.  As a direct and proximate result of the deprivation of their constitutional rights, \nPlaintiffs suffered injuries and damages. \n496.

In September 2020, the world witnessed Rochester Police Officers callously kill \nDaniel Prude, an unarmed Black man in obvious need of help. Although Mr. Prude was killed in \nMarch 2020, the Rochester Police Department suppressed the video for nearly six months. The \nfootage is truly shocking to watch: Mr. Prudeโnaked, bound and covered with a โspit hoodโโis \n1 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 2 of 96\n \nasphyxiated and left to die in the middle of the street as police officers stand about, chatting and \nmocking him.  \n2.  The people of Rochester were heartbroken, but manyโespecially those in \nRochesterโs Black and Latinx communities, which account for more than 60% of the Cityโwere \nnot surprised. As the Mayor later acknowledged: โinstitutional structural racism led to Daniel \nPrudeโs death.โ The Mayor also conceded that โwe have a pervasive problem in the Rochester \nPolice Department.โ \n3.  This problem is indeed pervasive. The same year Mr. Prude was killed, a Ph.D. \ndissertation was published that analyzed over 3,000 use-of-force reports by Rochester Police \nDepartment officers from 2011 to 2016. The study concluded: โThe frequency and severity of \nforce are higher in neighborhoods with larger percentages of Black and Hispanic \nresidents,โ even when controlling for other factors, like crime rates. In other words, the \nRochester Police Department uses more force and more extreme force in Black and Hispanic \nneighborhoods. \n4.  For decades, Rochester City officials have responded with deliberate indifference \nto this problem. By failing to meaningfully train, supervise, and discipline officers who use \nexcessive force and instead suppressing evidence of officer misconduct and attacking critics of \nthe department, the City has fostered a culture of violence and impunity in its ranks.  \n5.  The Cityโs stubborn refusal to confront the pervasive problem of racism in the \nPolice Department is perhaps best illustrated by this fact: in developing the Cityโs plan to reform \nthe Department pursuant to Governor Cuomoโs recent Executive Order to โreinventโ policing in \nNew York, the Mayorโs proposed plan refused the call from community members and the Police \nAccountability Board to terminate police officers with ties to white supremacist groups. \n2 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 3 of 96\n \nAlthough the City Council eventually voted to include that provision, it is the Mayor who has \nfinal authority over the police department. It is little wonder why people of color in Rochester \nfear and distrust the police. \n6.  Last fall, protesters, a vast majority of whom are Black, came together to protest \nthe killing of Mr. Prude and to demand an end to the racist policing they have endured for \ndecades. The City, in keeping with its long history, responded with the use of extreme violence \nand militarized police tacticsโincluding deploying batons, tear gas, flash-bang grenades, \narmored vehicles, and police dogsโto intimidate the protesters. Over the course of just three \ndays Rochester Police Department officers severely injured hundreds of protesters. Despite being \nlegally obligated to preserve all video evidence of the protests and the RPDโs response, the City \nfailed to do so.  \n7.  Simply put, a stunning historical record spanning more than four decades \ndemonstrates that the Rochester Police Departmentโs use-of-force practices continue to be \ninhumane, racist, and antithetical to the functioning of a civilized society. These practices violate \nthe Fourth Amendmentโs proscription of excessive force by the police, the Fourteenth \nAmendmentโs guarantee that a personโs race will not condemn them to violence or death at the \nhands of law enforcement officers, and the First Amendmentโs protection of free speech.  \n8.  Yet, the City is either unwilling or unable to stop these practices. Time and time \nagain, going back decades, the City and RPD have made hollow promises of reform but the \nculture of violent, racialized policing has not changed.   \n9.  Detailed more fully herein are more than fifty incidents of RPD officers using \nexcessive force against people of color. The victims of these incidents suffered devastating \ninjuries, and the following people were killed as a result of their encounters with the RPD: \n3 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 4 of 96\n \nRonald Frazier, Denise Hawkins, Alecia McCuller, Kenneth Jackson, Louis Davila, Calvin \nGreene, Vandre Davis, Willie Carter, Craig Heard, Lawrence Rogers, Patricia Thompson, Shawn \nDukes, Hayden Blackman, Israel Andino, Richard Davis, Daniel Prude, and Tyshon Jones. \n10.  This lawsuit calls on the Court to fulfill its most fundamental roleโto protect and \ndefend the Constitution. The need for meaningful change in the Rochester Police Department is \nreal and for people of color in Rochester, it could not be more urgent. Plaintiffs bring this suit to \nend the RPDโs decades-long use of violent, unconstitutional forceโbefore more lives, more \nBlack and brown lives, are lost.  \nTHE PARTIES \n \n11.

Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b), venue is proper in the Western District of New \nYork, the judicial district where the claims arose and in which the Defendants conduct business.  \nJURY TRIAL DEMAND \n \n44.  Plaintiffs demand a trial by jury on each and every claim to which they are legally \nentitled to a jury.  \nBACKGROUND \n \n45.  Rochester Police Department officers are sworn to serve and protect the Cityโs \npeople. But for decades, when Black and brown people in Rochester have turned to the police, \nthey have been met not with aid or empathyโbut with excessive, unconstitutional force.  \n46.  One year ago, on March 23, 2020, Daniel Prudeโs family sought help from the \nRPD as Daniel was suffering an acute mental health crisis. Tragically, that call for help ended \nwith Daniel naked and handcuffed with his face covered by a โspit hood,โ as an RPD officer \npushed his head into the freezing asphalt for several minutes. RPD officers on the scene mocked \nDaniel and chatted with each other while he asphyxiated. Daniel was declared brain dead that \nnight; he was taken off life support and died on March 30. As Danielโs brother Joe Prude later \nexplained in the most heartbreaking way, he called the police to get help for Daniel, โnot for \n[his] brother to get lynched. \n(Photograph included with permission of Joe Prude)  \n12 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 13 of 96\n \n \n47.  Danielโs death was foreshadowed by the RPDโs decades-long practice of using \nexcessive force on Black and brown residents of Rochester. That history is checkered with the \nRPD using that same excessive force against Rochester residents protesting police violence and \nracismโjust as it did in the recent demonstrations following Mr. Prudeโs murder. \n48.  In 1975, Denise Hawkins, an 18-year-old Black woman, was shot and killed by a \nyoung, white RPD officer, Michael Leach, who responded to the domestic dispute between Ms. \nHawkins and her husband. The RPD claimed the shooting was justified. Leach would retire \ndecades later as a police captain.  \n49.  Public outrage about Ms. Hawkinsโ killing and RPDโs investigation led to calls \nfor reforming the RPD. In response, the City created the Citizens Committee on Police Affairs \n(known as the โCrimi Committeeโ) to examine how policing in Rochester could be improved. \nThe Committee found that police brutality both exists and is widespread in the City and \nrecommended sweeping changes. While the City claimed to adopt many of those changes, the \nRPDโs brutal and racist policing practices did not change. \n50.  Only eight years later, in 1983, another Black womanโthe 21-year-old daughter \nof a Crimi Committee memberโwas fatally shot by an RPD officer. Alecia McCuller was a \nyoung mother in the midst of a domestic dispute. As her 6-year-old son powerfully described \nwhat happened: โMy mom told me to go to Cousin Idaโs house and tell her to call the police. \nThen the police cameโฆand the police shot. Thatโs the end of the story.โ  \n51.  In the wake of Ms. McCullerโs death, Rochesterโs Black community again called \nfor reform and accountability, emphasizing the Crimi Committeeโs findings. Demands for a \ncivilian review board increased, but the RPD did not change. \n13 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 14 of 96\n \n52.  By 1990, three more Black citizensโKenneth Jackson, Louis Davila, and Calvin \nGreeneโwere killed during encounters with the RPD. Mr. Greene was shot five times at close \nrange while cowering, unarmed, in a crawlspace in his own apartment. But the RPDโs practice of \nusing excessive force, particularly against Black people, continued unabated.  \n53.  The front page of the Times-Union in April 1991 declared: โPolice Use of Force \nSoars. 852 People Were Injured in Encounters with City Officers Last YearโUp 136%.โ The \npaperโs multi-part series detailed the disproportionate use of force against Black and Hispanic \npeople in the City. Rev. Raymond L. Graves, a prominent leader in the community, beseeched \nthe City and RPD Chief: โStop looking the other way.โ   \n54.  The following year, RPDโs former Police Chief, Gordon Urlacher, was convicted \nin federal court of embezzlement after being indictedโalong with five officers under his \ncommandโfor โwide-ranging brutality and corruptionโ committed by the departmentโs Highway \nInterdiction Team or โHITโ squad. This rotating squad was started in 1988 to combat drug \nactivity, but the HIT squad patrolled almost exclusively in the Cityโs communities of color. All \nof the indicted officers were white. \n55.  After his embezzlement conviction, RPD Police Chief Urlacher separately pled \nguilty to civil rights conspiracy for condoning the officersโ violence and shielding them from \naccountability. During a 10-week trial of other RPD officers, dozens of police witnesses testified \nwith immunity that they had witnessed egregious violence but lied during internal affairs \ninvestigationsโacknowledging the โcode of silenceโ within the department. The indicted \nofficers were ultimately acquitted by a jury made up of 11 white people and one Black person. \nOne of the officers, Michael Mazzeo, is now an RPD Investigator and the President of the Locust \nClub, Rochesterโs Police Union. \n14 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 15 of 96\n \n56.  RPD officials claimed race was โnot at all an issueโ in the HIT squadโs alleged \nabuses, even though the allegations included shouting racial slurs, keeping a wooden stick that \nsquad members referred to as their โn----- stick,โ writing โillegal alienโ in pen on the forehead of \na young man, cutting a dreadlock from the head of another man, and dumping a โflour-like, \npowdery substanceโ on yet another. Federal authorities ultimately found the HIT squad had \nterrorized more than 30 victimsโkicking, punching, throwing them against walls or down stairs \nwhile restrained, and beating them with unauthorized weapons including blackjacks, a cattle \nprod, and lead-filled leather gloves.  \n57.  Yet Police officials took no meaningful action to curb the RPDโs deeply \nembedded culture of racism and impunity despite abundant evidence of its existence. Then-\nPolice Chief Roy Irving instead defended the RPDโs internal review process even while the \nformer Chief and five officers were under federal indictment: โThe system is fine. Thereโs \nnothing wrong with the system.โ The City meanwhile paid over $200,000 in settlements for at \nleast ten civil rights suits brought by victims of the HIT squadโs brutality. The City also paid \n$625,000 to settle the wrongful conviction of Maurice James, who was framed by HIT squad \nmembers and served over two years in a maximum-security prison for crimes he didnโt commit.  \n58.  In a transparent effort to pacify the community, in 1992, the City Council passed \nlegislation creating a Civilian Review Board (โCRBโ). But rather than give the CRB any actual \noversight power, the Council made it โadvisoryโ only and allowed the RPD to continue \nconducting its own investigations, with the Chief of Police still having final say over any \ndiscipline.  \n59.  The CRB remains, as community members described it at the time, a โtoothless \ntiger.โ A comprehensive review of CRBโs efforts in 2017 concluded: \n15 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 16 of 96\n \nThe current Civilian Review Board has seemingly had no effect on reducing \nincidents of police misconduct and excessive forceโฆ. This lack of effectiveness \nis primarily due to the fact that the CRB is not independent of the RPD; thus, it \ncannot  conduct  its  own  investigations,  it  cannot  issue  subpoenas  to  compel \ntestimony or evidence, it cannot discipline officers, and it relies solely upon the \ninvestigative materials and recommendations provided by the [RPD].1 \n \n60.  Without external oversight, RPDโs culture of impunity continued to festerโwith \nincidents of racist policing and excessive force becoming more widespread and brazen. In 2002, \nfor example, Lawrence Rogersโa mentally-ill Black manโwas running in a parking lot, \nunarmed, wearing only his briefs. RPD officers tackled him to the ground and beat Mr. Rogers \nwith nightsticks, punched him, and pepper sprayed him. A video of the arrest showed an RPD \nofficer with his knee on Mr. Rogerโs neck during the incident. RPD officers also threatened and \npepper sprayed the woman who was filming the arrest and her daughter, which interrupted the \nfilming of Mr. Rogersโ arrest. Mr. Rogers suffered 27 lacerations, contusions, respiratory trauma, \nasphyxiation, and ultimately died from his injuries.  \n61.  Protesters marched in the City demanding answers and accountability after the \nvideo and several witness statements contradicted the officersโ account of what happened. \nThough the NAACP called for an outside investigation, none came. The RPD cleared the officers \nof any wrongdoing; all four are still employed by the Department, one has been promoted to \nSergeant, another has been made an Investigator.  \n62.  Time and again, RPD officers who use excessive force are promoted within the \nDepartment. Officer Mark Simmons, for example, was eventually promoted to interim Police \nChief and most recently, Deputy Chief, long after a 2005 incident in which he shot an unarmed \n13-year-old girl, Lashedica Mason. Officer Simmons claimed Lashedica โrushedโ him with a \n \n1 The Case for an Independent Police Accountability System (2017), report available at: \nhttp://enoughisenough.rocus.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-Case-for-an-Independent-Police-\nAccountability-System-2.1.17-FINAL.pdf \n16 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 17 of 96\n \nknife. But family members reported that the girl, who had locked herself in the bathroom, \ndropped the knife out the window before she emerged, and police photographs showed a knife in \nthe driveway and the bathroom window screen askew. Nevertheless, the Department declared \nOfficer Simmons โacted in an appropriate mannerโฆthe way he was trained to act,โ and he was \nnamed the July 2005 โofficer of the monthโ for his actions. Lashedica suffered years of \nsurgeries, had her right fingertip amputated, and still has a bullet fragment in her right kidney.  \n63.  The following year, Officer Jeffrey LaFave shot a mentally distraught Black \nwoman, Patricia Thompson, in her home. Her husband, who called the police, explained: โI \ncalled them to take her to the hospital, I never called for them to kill her.โ Although \nMs. Thompson had a knife at one point, witnesses reported that she had retreated and tripped \nbefore Officer LaFave shot her. LaFave received the โExcellent Police Serviceโ award that year; \nhe is now a Lieutenant.  \n64.  Just a few months later, Russell Davis, a Black man, was outside of his own \napartment building when several RPD officers approached him with guns drawn. Sergeant \nRonald Malley and another officer jumped Mr. Davis and violently wrestled him to the ground. \nEven though the building superintendent told the officers that Mr. Davis lived there, officers still \nhandcuffed him and placed him in the cruiser. When Mr. Davis filed a civilian complaint with \nRPD, it was Malley who conducted the internal investigation and he was cleared of wrongdoing. \nMalley has since been promoted to Lieutenant.  \n65.  In response to Ms. Thompsonโs death, people marched from City Hall to the \nPublic Safety Building (โPSBโ) demanding change and accountability. City and RPD officials \nresponded with lip service about the integrity of the Departmentโs internal investigations and \ntook no meaningful steps toward reform. \n17 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 18 of 96\n \n66.  Predictably, the Cityโs persistent indifference led officers to continue engaging in \nunlawful, racialized violence, which resulted in the senseless deaths of many more Black and \nbrown menโ Shawn Dukes in 2008, Hayden Blackman in 2011, Israel โIzzyโ Andino in 2012, \nRichard Gregory Davis in 2015โand the routine abuse of countless other people of color.  \n67.  In 2011, City Councilmember Adam McFadden wrote a letter to the Mayor, \nPolice Chief, and Council President charging that the City had โlost control of its police force.โ \nHe detailed how, for eight years, the overwhelming majority of calls to his offices were \ncomplaints from citizens of color about their treatment by officersโwith the hundreds of \ncomplaints by Black and Latinx residents about being racially profiled, arbitrarily stopped, and \nfalsely arrested without cause. His letter concludes: โOf the hundreds and hundreds of phone \ncalls I have received regarding police complaints, I have never been informed by the Rochester \nPolice Department of any disciplinary procedure brought against a police officer for any of these \ncomplaints.โ2  \n68.  And yet, to this day, City and RPD officials have not taken any meaningful action \nto curb these abuses and continue to foster a culture of racism and brutality within the \nDepartment by failing to train, supervise, and discipline officers who use unlawful force against \nBlack and brown people. Instead, time and again, the Department grants these officers awards \nand promotes them. As a result, RPD officers know they can engage in unlawful force with \nimpunity. \n69.  Though the people of Rochester have continued to fight for accountability and \nchange, these efforts have been thwarted. In November 2019, residents voted overwhelmingly \n \n2 Letter from City Councilmember Adam McFadden, Public Safety Chair, to Mayor, then-Council \nPresident WARREN, and Police Chief (June 29, 2011), \nhttp://rochester.indymedia.org/sites/default/files/McFadden%20Letter.pdf. \n18 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 19 of 96\n \nfor the creation of a Police Accountability Board (โPABโ). But the Locust Club filed a lawsuit to \nstrip the PAB of its disciplinary powers. (That case remains pending on appeal as of this \ncomplaint.) \n70.  Indeed, not only are City and RPD officials complicit in failing to train, supervise, \nand discipline officers who openly and repeatedly use violence against people of color, but they \nare actively involved in covering up evidence of such violence to protect the officers and the \nDepartment.   \n71.  As the six-month investigation conducted by Special Counsel Investigator \nAndrew G. Celli Jr., recently concluded: Defendants WARREN, then-Police Chief \nSINGLETARY, and other Rochester officials knew about the circumstances of Mr. Prudeโs  \ndeath in March 2020, six months before the footage was made public, and yet, WARREN, \nSINGLETARY, and other City officials suppressed the circumstances surrounding Mr. Prudeโs \ndeath and made untrue statements to the public concerning the timing of their knowledge.3 \n72.  Deputy Mayor James P. Smithโs preliminary investigation in September 2020 \nreached the same conclusion: โ[T]he lens of the badge and culture of acceptance appears to \nextend to City Hall and the highest reaches of the Administration.โ The handling of Mr. Prudeโs \nmurder by both City Hall and the Department, he continued, โraises questions regarding the \nreporting of other such arrests,โ including the fatal TASER death of Richard Gregory in May \n2015 and the use-of-force in the arrest of Christopher Pate in May 2018.4   \n \n \n3 Andrew G.

When the video of RPD Officers killing Daniel Prude was finally made public, it \nsparked nationwide outrage. In Rochester, thousands of people gathered to mourn the loss of \nBlack lives, demand the City finally end its racist and brutal policing practices, and call for new \nvisions of public safety that value Black lives. These protests continue to the present day. \n74.  Protesters have gathered outside the PSB, chanted, and held signs. Some of the \nprotestersโ chants and signs were specific to Daniel Prude; others decried the pattern of \nracialized, violent policing in Rochester, of which Mr. Prudeโs killing was the latest, most \negregious example. Many protesters, including several named Plaintiffs, chose to protest because \nof their firsthand experiences or experiences of family members with the RPD, which left them \nhurt or afraid.  \n75.  The largest of these protests took place between September 2 and September 5, \n2020. As part of its common practice, the RPD responded to these protests with extreme and \nunnecessary forceโincluding the indiscriminate use of tear gas and pepper spray, 40 millimeter \nblunt-impact projectiles, thousands of pepper balls, flash-bang grenades and other supposedly \nโless-than-lethalโ munitions. The Cityโs use of violent, militarized police tactics against Black \nand brown protesters and their allies was in line with their decades-long practice of suppressing \npolice critics through unconstitutional means. \n76.  Although termed โnonlethalโ or โless-than-lethalโ force, military-grade crowd \ncontrol devices like those used by the RPD involve serious risks of injury, and even death. \nChemical irritants (โCIsโ), like tear gas, are banned in warfare because they are indiscriminate \nweapons by design, especially when deployed by firing a grenade or canister. CIs can cause \n20 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 21 of 96\n \nsevere injury or death, and, even at low concentrations, exposure to tear gas presents a risk of \nserious, irreversible health effects.  \n77.  Over the course of three nights, RPD officers fired tear gas canisters 77 times into \ngroups of protesters expressly gathered to support Black lives, at journalists and legal observers \nattempting to report on and record the abuse, and at medics there to provide care and safety to \nthe protestersโoften when people had no escape route to get away from the chemical clouds. \nThe tear gas canisters are themselves projectile weapons; direct impact can cause significant \nblunt trauma, including bone fractures, lacerations and internal bleeding, and death. One \nprotester struck in the face by a canister required stitches both inside and outside her mouth and \nhas permanent facial scarring. \n78.  Over those three nights, RPD officers also discharged 6,100 pepper balls at people \nwho had gathered to protest the Departmentโs aggressive and racist practices. Other cities \nresponded to last summerโs racial justice protests without a fraction of this amount of force. In \nNew York City, for example, which saw thousands of demonstrators take to the streets, NYPD \nofficers fired not one pepper ball. By contrast, one RPD officer the night of September 4, 2020, \nfired 148 pepper balls in the span of just twenty minutes, at a group of people who were penned \nin or โkettledโ by police on the Court Street Bridge in downtown Rochester.   \n79.  RPD officers also shot protesters with 40mm direct-impact foam bulletsโknown \nas kinetic impact projectiles (โKIPSโ)โwhich can cause a range of injuries including death. \nKIPs are inherently inaccurate when fired from afar and so they often injure bystanders and \nstrike vulnerable body parts of intended targets and bystanders. RPD officers fired CTS 40 mm \nmunitions during the protest. The CTS website cautions that shots to the head, neck, thorax, \n21 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 22 of 96\n \nheart, or spine can result in fatal or serious injury. Use of force reports by RPD officers detail \ndeploying 40mm munitions at individualsโ abdomens at the September 5 demonstration.     \n80.  Other indiscriminate, military-grade weapons employed by the RPD and law \nenforcement agencies working with the RPD included flash bang grenades and a Long Range \nAcoustic Device (โLRADโ), which is both a sound system and a sonic weapon that can cause \npermanent hearing damage. Beyond these militarized weapons, in keeping with the long-\nstanding practice, RPD officers also struck countless peaceful protesters with their batons. Per its \nwebsite, the Locust ClubโRPDโs Police Unionโis named for โthe kind of wood that all \nRochester police nightsticks were once made from.โ Baton strikes can cause severe blunt injuries \nincluding bone fractures, internal bleeding, and death; a recent study by Physicians for Human \nRights concluded that the baton in particular has a greater risk of death than tear gas.  \n81.  As part of the City and RPDโs coordinated strategy to deny members of the Black \nand brown communities of Rochester their right to grieve, express anger, and demand justice \nfrom the Department, Mayor WARREN and then-Chief SINGLETARY asked the New York \nState Police and Monroe County Sheriffโs Department to send law enforcement officers to \nRochester.  \n82.  City Defendants invited State Troopers and Monroe County deputies to create an \nintimidating law enforcement response that was militarized; the State Police, for example, were \noutfitted in full riot gear and brought with them armored vehicles. Mayor WARREN and then-\nChief SINGLETARY also asked the State Police to come to Rochester with full knowledgeโas \nthey later acknowledged in a briefing to City Councilโthat the State Police would bring dogs as \npart of their formation. RPDโs own general orders expressly prohibit the use of police dogs for \ncrowd control.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 23 of 96\n \n83.  Along with the RPD, these law enforcement agencies contributed personnel and \nresources to create a massive police presence to confront those assembled in peaceful protest to \ncall the RPD to account for its widespread use of violence against people of color.  \n84.  PAB Chair Shani Wilson described the impact of the RPD and law enforcementโs \nstaggeringly violent response to the September racial justice protests: \nOver the past year, police response to protest have defined our City. โฆ What \nRochesterians saw and experienced has left them with deep scars, both physical and \nmental. Citizens have said that they were confronted by military-styled police \nformations and vehicles, they were chased through neighborhoods, tackled on the \npavement, some were struck by police vehicles, whacked with batons, shot in the \nchest with pepper balls, hit in the head with flashbangs, fumigated by tear gas, and \noverwhelmed by sound cannonsโฆ. They [have] suffered serious injuries that were \nsustained from the use  of so-called  โless-lethalโ weapons and many  are still \nexperiencing the health impacts of harm done to them during protests. \n \n85.  Local lawmakers denounced RPDโs use of chemicals and projectiles against \ncitizens exercising their First Amendment right to protest police brutality. After attending the \ndemonstrations one night, City Council member Mary Lupien and Monroe County Legislator \nRachel Barnhart asked the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the RPDโs actionsโciting \nthe presence of tanks, dogs, pepper balls, pepper spray, tear gas and the RPDโs escalation and \ndisproportionate use of force. Both elected officials were hit with pepper balls and pepper \nsprayed while peacefully protesting.  \n86.  Zachary Robertsโan international photojournalist who has published in Al \nJazeera and produced pieces for the BBCโwas covering the protests in Rochester. He called the \nRPDโs use of force โone of the single most violent things Iโve seen in my years in journalism,โ \nafter a hundred officers charged protesters using pepper bullets on September 3. โAlmost every \nsingle person here is affected.โ  \n23 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 24 of 96\n \n87.  Plaintiff REYNALDO DEGUZMANโalso a photojournalist who was at the \nprotests as a member of the pressโdescribed the RPDโs response in a statement to City Council \nas one โof unmitigated aggression, violent military grade tactics, and weaponry used on \nundergrads, nurses, construction workers, teachers, elderly clergy, men and women in \nwheelchairs holding umbrellas to shield themselves from chemical warfare.โ In filming the \nprotests, he โcaptured people with lost eyes, broken limbs, and many suffering from early stages \nof PTSDโincluding colleagues who work for local news that havenโt been able to go out in the \nfield because of what they witnessed.โ  \n88.  While hundreds of peaceful protesters, many of them Black and brown, were \ninjured by RPDโs violent response to the demonstrations, the Department condoned its officersโ \nactions. Former-Chief SINGLETARY stated that RPD officers โshowed restraintโ on a day that \nmany peaceful demonstrators, including elected officials, were shot with pepper balls, pepper \nsprayed, and worse. Deputy Chief Mark Mura declared that the tactics RPD used were โtactful, \nper policy and training, and appropriate for the situation at hand.โ Mayor WARREN also praised \nRPD officers afterward: โ[Y]ou made us very, very proud.โ   \n89.  The policies and practices of the City of Rochester were the moving force of the \nevents and injuries described below and they continue to threaten and violate the constitutional \nrights of the people who oppose these policies and practices and seek to petition the City to \nreform the RPD.  \nWednesday, September 2, 2020 \n90.  On September 2, 2020, Plaintiffs FREE THE PEOPLE ROC (โFTP ROCโ) and \nSTANLEY MARTIN held a press conference with the family of Daniel Prude, where they \nannounced the release of body worn camera video showing RPD officers Mark Vaughn, \nFrancisco Santiago, and Troy Taladay using wholly unlawfulโand patently unnecessaryโ\n24 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 25 of 96\n \nphysical force against Daniel Prude during a โmental healthโ arrest nearly six months prior on \nMarch 23, 2020. The footage showed several other RPD officers laughing with each other and \nridiculing Mr. Prude rather than intervening to stop the illegal use of force.  \n91.  At the press conference, MARTIN, FTP ROC, and Joe PrudeโDaniel Prudeโs \nbrotherโ revealed that the City and RPD had suppressed the body worn camera video to cover \nup the RPDโs responsibility for Mr. Prudeโs death. \n92.  In response, Defendants WARREN and SINGLETARY held a press conference \nat the PSB. RPD Officer Taladay, one of the officers directly responsible for Mr. Prudeโs death, \nwas on duty that day at the PSB. Although SINGLETARY reviewed the footage of Mr. Prudeโs \narrest in March 2020, six months earlier, he affirmatively decided not to reassign any of the \nofficers involved to administrative duty but rather to permit them to keep working in public-\nfacing roles.   \n93.  The RPD refused to allow Mr. Prudeโs family, MARTIN, or members of FTP \nROC to attend the press conference at the PSB. When members of FTP ROC attempted to gain \nentry, RPD officers arrested MARTIN and others inside of the PSB.  \n94.  MARTIN was violently arrested by Defendant Officer WILLIAM BAKER and \nfalsely charged with trespass. As a result of the excessive force used against them, MARTIN \nsustained a sprained ankle. The false criminal charges against MARTIN were later dismissed.  \n95.  As word spread about the press conference, people assembled outside of the PSB.  \nMeanwhile, the City and RPD developed and implemented a strategy to silence this peaceful and \nlawful exercise of rightsโthis included calling in the State Troopers and Sheriffโs Deputies to \nassemble a massive police presence. This coordinated strategy validated and encouraged the use \nof intimidation, excessive force, and illegal arrests by RPD officers during the protests.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 26 of 96\n \n96.  First, the RPD along with troopers and deputies erected barriers in front of the \nPSB, closing portions of Exchange Boulevard to vehicular traffic. As a peaceful demonstration \ntook place, RPD officers pepper sprayed protesters and indiscriminately shot pepper balls into \nthe crowd \n(RPD officer firing pepper balls at the crowd in front of PSB; State Troopers in the background) \n(Plaintiff EMILY MCINTYRE holding an umbrella against pepper balls)  \n \n97.  Officers also targeted and shot at journalists, legal observers, and people who \nwere recording officers, including Plaintiff ANTHONY HALL. Around 12:30 a.m., HALL was \n26 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 27 of 96\n \nstanding in front of the Public Safety Building recording the police actions with his cellphone \nwhen an officer shot him in the hand with a pepper ball, knocking his phone out of his hand.  \nThursday, September 3 to Friday, September 4, 2020 \n98.  The evening of September 3, 2020, a larger group of peaceful protesters, many of \nthem Black and brown, assembled in front of the PSB to call for justice for Mr. Prude and an end \nto the RPDโs brutal and racist policing.  \n(Plaintiff Stanley Martin, left, at the protest)5 \n \n5 This photograph and others herein are included with permission of the photographer subject to her \ncopyright.   \n27 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 28 of 96\n \n99.  Again, the law enforcement response was violent and chaotic. Within hours, \nRochester would resemble a war zone, with RPD officers, NYS Troopers, and MSCO officers \nunleashing flash grenades, tear gas, and thousands of pepper balls on the crowd. \n100.  At approximately 10:00 p.m., RPD officers began indiscriminately firing pepper \nballs and pepper spray at the peaceful protesters. Shortly thereafter, Defendants POTUCK, \nLUCYSHYN, CLINKHAMMER, and other officers assigned to the RPDโs Mobile Field Force \nindiscriminately assaulted protesters closest to the barricades with pepper spray.  \n \n28 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 29 of 96\n \n101.  Soon thereafter, RPD officers also began violently using their batons against \nprotestersโstriking and shoving them with unjustified, unnecessary force. \n102.  At approximately 11:15 p.m., MFF and other RPD officers were suddenly ordered \ninside the PSB. There, upon information and belief, they were given instructions by senior RPD \ncommand staff, including SINGLETARY, to forcibly โretake the loopโ and push protesters back \nto the street. On these orders, RPD officers, including MFF Sergeant POTUCK, came out of the \nPSB, rushed toward the peaceful crowd, and began indiscriminately shooting pepper balls at \ndemonstrators. Many shots were fired at head level. RPD officers also launched multiple tear gas \ncannisters into the crowd indiscriminately.  \n \n \n103.   One of the pepper balls hit Democrat & Chronicle photographer Tina MacIntyre-\nYee in the head as she was video recording.  The video of that incident, incorporated herein, is \navailable at https://tinyurl.com/2hy52d5d. \n29 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 30 of 96\n \n104.  RPD officers also once again used excessive force to arrest individuals who were \nnot committing any crime but rather lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights. RPD and \nother law enforcement used their batons and physical force to push the peaceful protesters across \nthe street into a parking lot. Eventually, the legion of RPD officers, MSCO deputies, and NYS \nTroopers separated the protesters into two groups and used their batons to push the first group \nsouth on Exchange Street towards Corn Hill. RPD officers chased the second group towards the \nCourt Street Bridge. \n105.  Eventually, RPD officers and Sheriffโs deputies began shooting the peaceful \nprotesters in the face and body with pepper balls. Many protesters sustained serious injuries \nincluding being shot in the face, neck, and upper body from close range under circumstances \nwhere officers were clearly aiming at those areas. One young man was shot in the eye with a \npepper ball from close range; on information and belief, he is now permanently blind in that eye. \nRPD officers and sheriffโs deputies also shot intentionally at volunteer street medicsโwearing \nhelmets and jackets with large red crosses prominently identifying them as medicsโwho rushed \nto aid the young man and others injured by the assault.  \n106.  The second group of protesters that RPD officers chased away from the PSB were \npushed into a parking lot and towards the Court Street Bridge. There, Jamia McCuller, a Black \nwoman, was lawfully video recording RPD officer Amber Grosch assaulting another protester \nwhen, without warning, RPD Sergeant Michael Collins, RPD Officer Justin Whitmore, and \nseveral MSCO deputies chased Ms. McCuller, tackled her to the ground, placed a knee on her \nneck, and violently arrested her. A portion of that incident can be viewed here: \nhttps://twitter.com/i/status/1302235538649427968. In the video, Ms. McCuller can be heard \nexclaiming, โI canโt breatheโ as officers pin her to the ground.  \n30 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 31 of 96\n \n107.  Plaintiff REYNALDO DEGUZMAN, a photojournalist, attempted to film the \npolice assaulting Ms. McCuller but a supervising officer ordered other RPD officers to \nphysically block DEGUZMAN from recording the event. After Ms. McCuller was taken into \ncustody, as DEGUZMAN walked away, an officer said: โA media badge isnโt a free pass.โ That \nofficer then shot DEGUZMAN in the neck with a pepper ball from approximately five feet away.  \n \n(Plaintiff Deguzmanโs injuries after being shot at close range) \n \n108.  Plaintiff DEVORAH CHATMAN also tried to record Ms. McCuller being held \non the ground by RPD officers. While doing so, CHATMAN was shot approximately six times \nwith pepper balls from close range by RPD officers, MSCO deputies, and NYS Troopers, \nincluding Defendant Trooper STEPHEN DELLASALA. Two of the shots hit CHATMAN in her \nleft shoulder, causing her to lose feeling in her arm.  \n31 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 32 of 96\n \n109.  While street medics attended to CHATMANโs injuries, she informed the officers \nthat she was an army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan to defend the First Amendment \nfreedoms that police were violently suppressing. As she was speaking, several officers, including \nDELLASALA, suddenly rushed at her, forcibly seized her, grabbed her phone and threw it to the \nground. They placed handcuffs upon her wrists and arrested her. CHATMAN was falsely \ncharged with disorderly conduct; the charges were dismissed on November 4, 2020. \n110.  Many RPD officers engaging in the use of force against protesters covered both \ntheir nametags and their badge IDsโmaking it difficult, if not impossible, for affected citizens to \nidentify those officers who violated their rights. On information and belief, RPD officers had no \nlegitimate reason to cover both their name tags and their badge IDs in responding to protesters. \nBy encouraging or allowing officers to do so, the City and Department, in line with longstanding \npractice, insulated individual officers from accountability, criticism, or consequence for their role \nin the unlawful response to the protests.  \nFriday, September 4, 2020 to Saturday 5, 2020 \n111.  On September 4, RPD officers used the Court Street bridge to โkettleโ protesters, \nspray them with tear gas, and attack them with pepper balls โ a scene tragically reminiscent of \nthe 1965 โBloody Sundayโ attack on civil rights demonstrators on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in \nSelma, Alabama. Videos from that night show heavily armored phalanxes of police using pepper \nballs, 40mm kinetic bullets, tear gas, and batons to assault diverse groups of protesters outfitted \nonly with umbrellas, cardboard boxes, and plastic childrenโs sleds against the RPDโs military-\ngrade arsenal but who nevertheless assembled to protest for racial justice and reformed policing.  \n32 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 33 of 96\n \n \n \n112.  RPD officers first escorted peaceful protesters along Court Street from Martin \nLuther King Jr. Memorial Park towards the PSB, and directed them onto the Court Street Bridge. \nBut when protesters reached the other side, law enforcement stopped them with metal barricades. \n33 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 34 of 96\n \n113.  After thousands of protesters had marched onto the bridge and had nowhere to go, \nthe police ordered the protesters to โdisperse.โ But the protesters towards the back of the bridge \nnear South Avenue could not hear the dispersal orders, and there was nowhere for the protesters \nin the front near the police barricades to go. \n \n114.  Suddenly, without giving the protesters the time or opportunity to disperseโand \nknowing it was physically impossible for them to comply with the dispersal ordersโlaw \n34 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 35 of 96\n \nenforcement officers began violently attacking protesters. At the direction of RPD Grenadier \nTeam Leader SAMUEL LUCYSHYN, RPD officers indiscriminately shot pepper balls and tear \ngas into the crowd. Video available at: https://twitter.com/i/status/1302075393428590592. On \nthe video, officers can be heard giving the order to disperse while pepper balls are being shot.  \n115.  The order to fire was given by RPD command staff at approximately 10:43 p.m. \nBy 11:00 p.m., RPD officers had fired hundreds of pepper balls at the penned-in crowd. One \nRPD officer fired at least 148 pepper balls in that time, another fired well over 120. At least 16 \nRPD officers shot peppers balls at protesters trapped on the Court Street Bridge.   \n116.  Plaintiff NICHOLAS ROBERTSON, a Black man and criminal justice professor \nat Rochester Institute of Technology, was one of many individuals struck in the head by pepper \nballs shot at protesters trapped on the Bridge. He suffered a laceration and permanent scarring. \nROBERTSON was also shot with pepper balls numerous times in his body and legs.  \n117.  Edward Fitzgerald was shot in the forehead with a pepper ball. After officers \nrushed through the barricade, an officer ripped Mr. Fitzgeraldโs umbrella from his hand and shot \nhim directly in the face with a pepper ball, causing a large laceration and permanent scarring: \n35 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 36 of 96\n \n118.  After spraying the crowd with tear gas and pepper balls, officers then rushed at \nprotesters, violently wielding batons and using physical force to push and shove them. RPD \nofficers also baselessly arrested peaceful protesters for allegedly failing to comply with the \ndispersal order and โunlawful assembly.โ \n \n119.  For example, RPD officers arrested Christopher Hildebrandt, a paraplegic \nwheelchair user who is the Chief Operating Officer of the Center for Disability Rights. When the \npolice rushed towards the crowd, they crashed into Mr. Hildebrandt, knocked over his \nwheelchair and threw him onto the ground. An RPD officer grabbed Mr. Hildebrandt and \ndragged him a dozen or so feet before officers handcuffed him and placed him back into his \nwheelchair. Officers then wheeled Mr. Hildebrandt to the PSB and told him he had been arrested \nfor disorderly conduct and unlawful assembly; however, after being detained for hours, Mr. \nHildebrandt was released without charges.  \n120.  At a subsequent briefing to City Council, Defendants SINGLETARY and \nFAVOR stated that the decision to position officers at the end of the bridge was part of the \n36 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 37 of 96\n \nDepartmentโs โoverall operational plan to not allow access points to the PSB,โ even though on \nboth earlier and subsequent nights the Department allowed such access.   \n121.  When questioned about the decision to use force on peaceful protesters trapped on \nthe bridge, the Chief said that was a decision ultimately made by the Command Post. \nSINGLETARY and other RPD officials have stood by this decision despite RPD officersโ clearly \nexcessive use of force and the countless physical injuries sustained by peaceful protesters. \n122.  The police assault was not over: even after protesters were allowed off the bridge, \nRPD officers continued to shoot pepper balls at them and pushed them past Dinosaur BBQ, and \nacross South Avenue. Video available at: https://twitter.com/i/status/1302086982940717056. \nRetreating protesters can be seen using signs and umbrellas to shield themselves from the \npursuing officers who are firing pepper balls at them indiscriminately. RPD officers also attacked \nprotesters with tear gas and other chemical weapons throughout the night.  \n123.  RPD officers targeted NLG Rochester Legal Observers, who were wearing bright \ngreen โNLGโ hats that clearly indicated they were Legal Observers. One NLG Legal Observer, \nPlaintiff EMILY GOOD, was shot with pepper balls and exposed to tear gas. Shortly after \nmidnight, GOOD was standing alone near the entrance to the Court Street Parking Garage, \nstruggling to take notes in her notepad, when she was targeted and shot in the hand with a pepper \nball. Ms. Good was wearing a clearly identifiable neon NLG hat at the time she was shot. \nOfficers also targeted photographers and other members of the media.  \n124.  In addition to the RPDโs indiscriminate use of tear gas, pepper spray, and pepper \nballs that night, RPD officers also employed excessive force by shooting peaceful protesters with \n40mm direct-impact rounds and firing smoke and tear gas canisters from grenade launchers.  \n \n37 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 38 of 96\n \nSaturday, September 5 to Sunday, September 6, 2020 \n125.  On Saturday night, police violence peaked against people who had gathered to \nprotest the RPDโs racialized violence and support the sanctity of Black lives.  \n126.  Similar to the previous night, peaceful protesters marched from MLK Park \ntowards the PSB. But during the march, protesters were met with an overwhelming presence of \nRPD officers, Sheriffโs deputies and State Police in full riot gear with military grade weaponsโ\nincluding a bearcat tankโand police dogs.   \n \n \n127.  As videos of the law enforcement response on that night demonstrate, the officers \nunleashed a torrent of violence on the peaceful protestersโcausing many protesters serious \ninjury. One such video, incorporated herein, can be seen here: https://tinyurl.com/vra3x4j7.  \n38 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 39 of 96\n \n        (NY State Troopers with police dog) \n  128.   One protester who was seriously injured was Monroe County Legislator Rachel \nBarnhart. Ms. Barnhart and several other elected officialsโincluding City Council Members \nMary Lupien and Mitch Gruberโhad joined the demonstrations and positioned themselves at the \nโfront lineโ where they were clearly visible to police, believing the RPD would not use the same \nlevel of indiscriminate excessive force against elected officials engaged in peaceful protest. \n129.  While on that front line, Lupien was also texting Mayor WARREN asking her to \nensure that law enforcement did not escalate or use violence against the people.     \n39 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 40 of 96\n \n130.  But several minutes after the march was stopped by police at the intersection of \nBroad Street and Exchange Boulevard, RPD officers began to launch flash bang grenades, \nrelease tear gas, and shoot pepper balls into the crowd indiscriminately.  \n \n \n131.  One of those pepper balls struck Ms. Barnhart in the head, causing her to sustain a \nconcussion, as well as irritation to her skin, eyes, mouth, nose, and lungs.   \n \n40 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 41 of 96\n \n \n132.  Rochester City Council Member Mitch Gruber was standing next to Ms. Barnhart \nand was shot in both the thigh and the shoulder with a projectile.  \n133.  Several pepper balls hit ANTHONY HALL in the body, and one hit him in the \nface causing a large welt.  \n \n \n134.  Defendant POTUCK and other RPD MFF officers and Grenadier Team then \nadvanced towards protesters while deploying chemical weapons. POTUCK indiscriminately \ndeployed tear gas at the protesters using a โfoggerโ and launched multiple tear gas cannisters into \ngroups who were protecting themselves with makeshift shields and umbrellas.  \n41 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 42 of 96\n \n \n \n \n135.  Former Irondequoit Councilwoman Nicole Hushla Re was standing apart from the \ncrowd, livestreaming the events when she was suddenly, and without warning, struck in the face \n42 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 43 of 96\n \nby a tear gas cannister. Once hit, she describes blood flying everywhere and being unable to see \nanything due to the cloud of smoke. \n \n136.  Ms. Hushla Re sustained facial fractures and her upper lip required numerous \nstitches, both inside and outside of her lip. Her face has permanent scarring: \n137.  While Ms. Hushla Re was being treated at Strong Memorial Hospital, another \nprotester was also getting stitched up after having been hit in the head with a pepper ball. \n138.  Members of RPDโs Grenadier Team also launched numerous Flash Bang \nGrenades at protesters that night. After several minutes of deploying chemical weapons, the \npolice suddenly and without warning ran full speed towards the crowd at the intersection of \nExchange Boulevard and Main Street, pushed them and struck them with batons: \n \n \n43 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 44 of 96\n \n \n139.  Another group of protesters, including Plaintiff LORE MCSPADDEN-WALKER \n(they/them), dispersed towards City Hall. On the sidewalk in the vicinity of Church and Fitzhugh \nStreets, MCSPADDEN-WALKER and other protesters encountered a group of police who \nstopped them. The police then rushed towards the protesters, as documented here: \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ydska5st.  \n140.  When a police officer charged MCSPADDEN-WALKER, they had their hands in \nthe air. An officer violently seized MCSPADDEN-WALKER and threw them to the ground, \ncausing them to fall onto their knees. The officer then slammed MCSPADDEN-WALKERโs \nshoulder into the ground, told them they were under arrest, and placed handcuffs on their wrists. \nThe officer then pulled MCSPADDEN-WALKER to their feet and began escorting them to a \npolice vehicle. When MCSPADDEN-WALKER informed the officer their driverโs license listed \ntheir gender as โfemale,โ the officer laughed and made fun of them for their gender identity. \n141.  Another large group of injured protesters sought refuge from the police inside of \nSpiritus Christi church. Police surrounded the church and shot hundreds of rounds of pepper \n44 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 45 of 96\n \nballs at the building, splattering its walls with chemical irritants. RPD Officer Dylan Minnick, \nfor example, fired pepper balls at individuals who had taken shelter in the churchโs alcove.    \n142.  One protester who sought refuge in the church was Jaeylon Johnson. Mr. Johnson \nwas riding his bicycle on State Street near the intersection with Church Street when police shot \nhim in the neck several times with pepper balls. The pepper balls exploded at the base of Mr. \nJohnsonโs gas mask, causing all the chemicals to go directly into his mask, which he inhaled. As \na result, Mr. Johnson passed out, fell to the ground, and had a seizure (for the first time in his \nlife). Other protesters then came to Mr. Johnsonโs aid and escorted him to Spiritus Christi. While \nhe was inside the church, Mr. Johnson had a second seizure.  \n143.  Inside the church, a young girl who was shot in the kneeโapparently by a direct-\nimpact projectileโcould barely walk. Another woman was having seizures from exposure, and \npeople were lined up outside the bathrooms to rinse off tear gas and pepper spray residue. Many \npeople had bruises, welts, and bleeding sores where they had been hit by police projectiles. \n144.  Eventually, police announced that protesters could leave the church without being \narrested or beaten if they dispersed from the area and went home. A young man named Andrew \nTrammell ran out of the church and past City Hall to try to make his way home. While walking \non the sidewalk in the vicinity of Platt Street and State Street, an RPD SUV drove quickly \ntowards Mr. Trammell, then suddenly drove up onto the sidewalk and ran into him, knocking \nhim on the ground. Mr. Trammell hit his head on the ground and lost consciousness. RPD \nOfficer Adam Johnston and other officers handcuffed him, arrested him, and charged with him \nwith unlawful assembly. Those false charges were all later dismissed. \n45 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 46 of 96\n \n145.  RPD Officials, including then-Chief SINGLETARY, have defended the RPDโs \nresponse that night, stating that the RPD โshowed restraintโ and that the tactics used were \nappropriate for the situation. \n146.   Based on statements by City Officials and RPD command staff to date, no RPD \nofficer has reported any fellow officer for their unlawful use of force and no RPD officers have \nbeen disciplined for their unlawful use of force on September 2, 3, 4 or 5, 2020.  \n147.  Instead, the City has taken steps to ensure that important evidence of officer \nmisconduct during these events was not preserved. Many RPD officers in their reports indicate \nthat their body cameras โfell offโ or โwould not recordโ but state that cameras mounted on the \nPSB and/or bluelight cameras around the city should have captured the timing and circumstances \nof their use-of-force on protesters. On September 14, the City acknowledged receipt of a \npreservation letter for all such video from the blue-light and PSB camerasโwell within the 30-\nday retention period for those recordings. To date, the City has produced less than 3 minutes of \nfootage from the night of September 4. The City has indicated the rest of the footage was \ndestroyedโdespite the preservation letter and their own retention policies.  \nSaturday, September 12 to Sunday September 13, 2020 \n148.  Protests in support of Black lives and calling for an end to RPDโs racialized \nviolence continued. The night of September 12, 2020, several hundred peaceful protesters \nmarched from the location where Daniel Prude was killed on Jefferson Avenue towards the RPD \nstation on Child Street. RPD officers, Sheriffโs deputies and State Police in riot gear blocked the \nroad at the intersection of Child Street and Wilder Street, where they stopped the protesters. \n46 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 47 of 96\n \n \n149.  Defendant POTUCK was commanding RPDโs MFF. After stopping the peaceful \nmarch, the police issued dispersal orders but without giving the protesters an opportunity to \ndisperse. Protesters were chanting and exercising their First Amendment rights to decry RPDโs \nracist policing and demand change. Thereafter, in retaliation for what the RPD claimed was \nโanti-police rhetoric,โ POTUCK issued an order for the officers to โmove forward,โ and the \npolice began violently attacking the protesters. First, the police unleashed chemical weapons: \n \n47 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 48 of 96\n \n \n \n150.  Then, the police rushed the protesters and pushed and struck them with batons. \n151.  On information and belief, no RPD officers have been disciplined for their \nexcessive use of forceโincluding the indiscriminate spraying of chemical weapons into crowds \nof protestersโon September 12, 2020. \nWednesday, September 16, 2020 \n152.  The night of September 15, FTP ROC organized a peaceful โsleep-inโ protest in \nfront of City Hall. In the morning, protesters awoke to police issuing dispersal orders. Without \njustification or provocation, police immediately began arresting people. Several of the people \narrested, including Plaintiff MARTIN, were subjected to excessive force.  \n153.  The male police officer who handcuffed and arrested MARTIN was being \naggressive, so MARTIN asked that a female officer search them before they were placed in a \npolice vehicle. The officer refused, and when MARTIN again asked for a female officer to \nperform the search, the male officerโbelieved to be either officer ALEXANDER ELMORE, \nJOHN CLINKHAMMER, or DOMENIC BORELLIโforcefully slammed MARTINโs head into \nthe side of the police vehicle. MARTIN suffered a concussion as a result.  \n154.  Plaintiff WINONA MILLER, a 52-year-old disabled Black woman, was sitting on \na bench across the street from City Hall when several RPD officers, including Defendant \nETHAN PASZKO, surrounded her and ordered her to stand up. MILLER said in response that \nshe was just sitting on the bench. The officers abruptly grabbed MILLER, pulled her to her feet, \nforced her arms behind her back, and applied handcuffs to her wrists in an unreasonably tight \nmanner. When MILLER complained the handcuffs were too tight and requested they be \nloosened, instead of helping her, PASZKO kneed her in the stomach.  \n48 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 49 of 96\n \n155.  MILLER was detained on the street for approximately one hour, during which \ntime she repeatedly asked that her handcuffs be loosened but the RPD officers refused. \nEventually, MILLER was transported to the PSB, where she was detained for approximately four \nhours before she was charged with disorderly conduct, issued an appearance ticket, and released \nfrom custody. The false charges against her were dismissed on October 22, 2020. \n156.   PASZKO and his partner VANBREDERODE were named โOfficers of the \nMonthโ for September 2020. On information and belief, no RPD officers have been disciplined \nfor their excessive force and/or illegal arrests on September 16, 2020.  \nTuesday October 13, 2020 \n157.  On October 13, 2020, after attending a peaceful protest at the Webster Police \nDepartment organized by FTP ROC, Nicholas Wilt was arrested by a Monroe County Sheriffโs \nDeputy. The Deputy claimed there was a bench warrant for Mr. Wilt for missing a court date for \nhis September 12, 2020 arrest (during the protests described above). Mr. Wilt informed the \nDeputy that he had not missed a court appearance because his court date was October 22, 2020โ\nnot September 22, 2020, as the Deputy said. The Deputy still detained Mr. Wilt and transported \nhim to the PSB where the RPD confirmed that Mr. Wiltโs court date was October 22, 2020. \nNevertheless, RPD refused to release Mr. Wilt from custody. \n158.  About 20 protesters arrived at the PSB to ask why Mr. Wilt was detained.  \n159.  Although the protesters were peaceful, an RPD supervisor ordered officers to \nโjust push them.โ Officers suddenly, and without giving the protesters an opportunity to exit the \nbuilding, began pushing protesters with batons towards the front doors, where a bottleneck \noccurred.  \n49 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 50 of 96\n \n160.  Defendant MATTHEW DRAKE was one of the Defendant officers who struck \nprotesters with his baton, including Plaintiff EMILY MCINTYRE, who he repeatedly struck \nwith his baton in the neck, back and body without provocation or justification.  \n161.  Another protester who was caught in the bottleneck was India Maring \n(they/them). They were shoved by officers and thrown to the ground. As a result, Mx. Maringโs \nhead hit the ground with such force that they sustained a concussion.  \n162.  On information and belief, no RPD officers have been disciplined for their \nexcessive force and/or illegal arrests on October 13, 2020.  \nTHE CITY OF ROCHESTERโS UNCONSTITUTIONAL POLICIES AND PRACTICES \n \n163.  The RPDโs violent response to these demonstrations was simply the most \ndocumented and largest-scale example of the Departmentโs widespread pattern and practice of \nusing excessive force, particularly against people of color.     \n164.  For decades, despite countless lawsuits, news reports, protests, and public outcry, \nthe RPD and City of Rochester have remained deliberately indifferent to the need to train, \nsupervise, and discipline RPD officers who use excessive force in routine police encounters with \nBlack and brown citizens. In particular, the RPD has for decades maintained an internal \ndisciplinary system that is a sham and which utterly fails to discipline officers who have engaged \nin abusesโfostering the culture of brutality and impunity that was on full display during the \nSeptember 2020 protests, even as the world watched.  \nThe RPD has engaged in a pattern of policing of using force, conducting stops, and \nengaging in other law enforcement actions disproportionately against people of color.  \n \n165.  There is a pattern and practice within the RPD of engaging in law enforcement \nactions โ including using force and more substantial force, and conducting pretextual stops โ\ndisproportionately against people of color. \n50 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 51 of 96\n \n166.  Data from five yearsโ of RPD โsubject resistance reportsโ (โSRRsโ), which \nofficers are required to prepare for any use of force beyond handcuffing, show that RPD officers \nuse force, and more serious force, disproportionately against people of color. The RPD provided \nevery SRR completed between October 9, 2011 and June 30, 2016 to a former RPD Investigator, \nCharles LoFaso, to analyze for his doctoral thesis.6 During that time period, RPD officers \ndocumented 3,368 use-of-force incidentsโwhich averages out to two per day.7   \n167.  This data revealed that RPD officersโ use of force was overwhelmingly \nagainst people of color: 66.8% against Black people and 11.5% against Hispanic people. \nThat is 2,243 Black people and 389 Hispanic people who had force used on them by RPD \nofficers during a 1726-day period.  \n168.  Of the 3,368 documented force incidents, nearly a quarter (23.9%) were classified \nas โhigh force,โ meaning the force involved the use of a TASER, baton, canine, bean bag gun, or \ngun. โLow forceโ incidents include officers using tactics such as nerve pressure points, punches \nand jabs, kicks and knee strikes, takedowns, and pepper spray.  \n169.  From the SRR data, LoFaso determined that โas the percentage of Black and \nHispanic residents [in a neighborhood] increases, uses of force significantly increaseโ even \nafter controlling for factors such as crime rates. He further discovered that, again after \ncontrolling for factors like crime rates, โthe odds of being subjected to high force, relative to low \nforce, increase by 17.1% on average, as neighborhood percentage of Black residents increases, \nand by 17.7% on average, as neighborhood percentage of Hispanic residents increases.โ In other \n \n6 Charles LoFaso, The Effect of Race, Place, and Time on Police Use of Force: How Social Context Influences \nLegal Decision-Making (2020), http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=osu1594479446661188. \n7 The actual rate is higher. The 3,368 number refers to use-of-force incidents against a single subject, \nrather than SRRs filed. Where multiple officers used force against a single subject and each submitted an \nSRR, LoFaso collapsed those reports into a single use-of-force โincidentโ for purposes of his analysis.   \n51 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 52 of 96\n \nwords, โofficers use force more often and at more severe levels only when interacting with \ncitizens in neighborhoods with higher percentages of Black and Hispanic residents.โ \n170.  Because SRRs rely on officers to self-report data, it is not possible to know how \nmany uses of force went unreported during that time period. This is true in part because, if a \ncitizen files a complaint with the Department and there are no independent witnesses or \ncorroborating evidence (like an SRR), the case will be closed and the officer will face no \ndisciplinary consequences. LoFaso thus concludes: โFrequency and severity of force may be \nhigher in minority neighborhoods than the results suggest.โ  \n171.  Similarly, Black people, especially Black people in predominantly Black \nneighborhoods, are disproportionately subject to pretextual stops by the RPD. The Monroe \nCounty Public Defender (โMCPDโ) has observed that RPD officers frequently stop young Black \nmen and boys for riding bicycles without bells or walking in the street when sidewalks are \ncongested. Over 90% of people ticketed by the RPD last year for no lights or bells on bikes, \nfailure to use the sidewalk, and โinadequate turn signalsโ were Black.   \n172.  These stops are not precipitated by accidents or other dangerous conditions. \nRather, RPD officers initiate these stops as a tactic to interfere with the movement of Black \nresidents and to leverage searching them. White men, women, and children ride bikes without \nbells and walk in the streets when sidewalks are available but are almost never ticketed for this.  \n173.  The RPD also arrests Black people in Rochester at a disproportionate rate. While \nthe RPD itself collects but does not publish data on arrest rates by race, a 2014 study of the \nDepartmentโs arrest records concluded that RPD officers arrest Black people at a rate 2.7 times \nhigher than non-Black residents; that is, 66% of RPD arrests were of Black residents, though \nBlack people made up only 42% of the Cityโs population at the time.   \n52 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 53 of 96\n \n174.  The RPDโs pattern of racially discriminatory policing, including pretextual stops, \ndates back decades. In 1997, Black residents were arrested 2.6 times as often as white residents, \nand Latinx residents were arrested 1.4 times as often. As the Democrat & Chronicle reported in \n1999: โRacismโas evidenced by allegations of racial profilingโhas woven its way into \n[Rochester] law enforcement.โ A 1993 local task force showed that 70% of people stopped and \nquestioned by RPD were Black or Hispanic. And in 2011, community groups called for a federal \ninquiry into the RPDโs practice of racial profiling after a study concluded that Black residents \nhad a one-in-two chance of being stopped by the RPD for questioning, while white residents had \na one-in-11 chance.  \n175.  The RPDโs needless, aggressive, and intimidating tactic of pretextual stops often \nleads to escalation and unnecessary use of force against Black people for minor traffic \ninfractions. \n176.  LoFasoโs observations in coding the SRRs echo this: โ[A] disturbing number of \nincidentsโฆmight have been resolved without the use of force if the officer had simply continued \ntalking.โ For example, an officer who became irritated at the use of profanity and quickly \ndecided to make a disorderly conduct arrest. โHad the officer ignored the profanity and \ncontinued trying to resolve the issue, a use of force could potentially have been avoided.โ  \n177.  In the last decade alone, the City was named as a defendant in at least 40 federal \nlawsuits alleging the use of violent excessive force by many of the same RPD officers. These \nlawsuits include shocking accounts of the RPDโs extreme and unprovoked violence against \nBlack and brown people.  \n53 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 54 of 96\n \n178.  These civil rights lawsuits include shocking, documented accounts of the RPDโs \nextreme and unprovoked violence against Black and brown citizens.8 For example:   \nโข  Dudley Scott: Mr. Scott was a 33-year-old college student who was driving home \none night in August 2014, when RPD Officers Michael Stephens and Evan Henry \nstopped him without cause, handcuffed him, and repeatedly punched and kicked \nhim while restrained and not resisting. Other RPD officers, including Defendant \nRANDY POTUCK, were present and did not intervene. Mr. Scott had to undergo \nsurgery and was permanently blinded in his right eye, with permanently \ndiminished vision in his left eye as a result of the brutal beating. The City paid \n$750,000 to settle the case in 2018. Stephens, Evans and POTUCK remain \nemployed by the RPD.  \nโข  Rickey Bryant: Rickey was 17 years old when multiple RPD officers knocked \nhim off his bike, pepper sprayed him, and violently beat himโfracturing his eye \nsocketโin a case of mistaken identity in 2016. An internal RPD investigation \nclaimed that Bryantโs allegations were โunprovable.โ Officers did not have their \nbody worn cameras on but a video captured one RPD officer choking Rickey after \nhe was handcuffed, and the teenager had multiple documented injuries. The City \nsettled the lawsuit for $360,000. The involved officers are all still employed by \nthe RPD.  \nโข  Miriam McKnight: Ms. McKnight called the police to report a stabbing next \ndoor to her house in July 2010. When Officer Gregory Vasile insisted on putting \ncrime scene tape in her yard, Ms. McKnight informed him that he had the wrong \nproperty. Audio recording captured on Ms. McKnightโs phone shows that Vasile \nthen ordered McKnight to turn around and โput [her] hands behind her back,โ \n \n8 The City of Rochester has settled the majority of these excessive force lawsuits, including but not \nlimited to Blackman v. City of Rochester, No. 13-cv-6152 (W.D.N.Y.) (fatal shooting of Hayden \nBlackman); Maddox v. City of Rochester, No. E2018010768 (Sup. Ct. Monroe Co.) (unprovoked assault \non 16-year-old); Lucas v. City of Rochester, Index No. 499-16 (Sup. Ct., Monroe Co.) (RPD officer struck \nplaintiff with his car); Pagan v. City of Rochester, No. 17-cv-6073 (W.D.N.Y.) (assault on mother of \nyoung man just shot and killed); Santos v. Barber, No. 17-cv-6475 (W.D.N.Y.) (slammed plaintiff face \ndown into the concrete sidewalk requiring surgery to fix and fuse plaintiffโs vertebrate); Johnson v. City \nof Rochester, No. 17-cv-6229 & 17-cv-6490 (W.D.N.Y.) (use of excessive force on two separate \noccasions); Taylor v. City of Rochester, No. 16-cv-6606 (W.D.N.Y.) (same officer as Johnson, called \nplaintiff the n-word and assaulted him, causing tooth to break off and lodge in his lip); Rodriguez v. State \nof New York, No. 13-cv-6301 (W.D.N.Y.) (Officer POTUCK and another officer tased plaintiff causing \nhim to fall to the ground from the second story and then beat him); Dowdell v. City of Rochester, No. 11-\ncv-6493 (W.D.N.Y.) (unjustified assault, causing fractured nose, chipped teeth, bruising and swelling); \nLibbett v. City of Rochester, No. 12-cv-6697 (W.D.N.Y.) (assault by multiple RPD officers on restrained \nand prone plaintiff, batons, pepper spray and tasering); Lawhorn v. Algarin, No. 16-cv-6226 (W.D.N.Y.) \n(unlawful stop by 13 RPD officers, broke car window, pulled plaintiff from the car, and punched him โ \none officer criminally convicted three years later); Turner v. City of Rochester, No. 11-cv-6200 \n(W.D.N.Y.) (Officer Ferrigno slammed plaintiff onto the concrete and threatened to send her to jail \nbecause she was โon his last nerveโ). \n54 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 55 of 96\n \nstating โIโve had enough of this shit.โ He then violently pepper sprayed Ms. \nMcKnight. Her injuries included lacerations, scarring, and breathing difficulties \ndue to the pepper spray. She was awarded $216,875 after a bench trial in her civil \nrights lawsuit. Vasile is still an RPD officer.  \nโข  Tina Cabisca: In 2013, Officers Daryl Hogg and Jason Prinzi used force against \nMs. Cabisca after Investigator Nolan Wengert fatally shot Ms. Cabiscaโs dog. \nAfter a bench trial in February 2019, the judge concluded that after Ms. Cabiscaโs \ndog was shot, Hogg escalated the encounter by yelling at Ms. Cabisca to leave her \nfront yard and abandon her dog. When she objected, Hogg โlost his temperโ and \nused the โstraight arm bar techniqueโ to force her to the ground, then placed his \nfull bodyweight on her back. When Ms. Cabisca objected that she could not \nbreathe and had asthma, Hogg โlean[ed] on her even harder.โ The Court \nconcluded Prinzi also used excessive force when he used his full bodyweight to \npin down the lower half of Ms. Cabiscaโs body. She was awarded $50,000 in \ndamages and $75,000 in attorneyโs fees. Both officers are still employed by the \nRPD; Hogg was promoted to Sergeant in September 2020. \n \nโข  September 2015, RPD Officers Steven Mitchell, Jeffrey Kester, and Defendant \nMATTHEW DRAKE beat a Black man for over two minutes after he was \nhandcuffed and arrested for purportedly trespassing at a convenience store. While \nthe man was handcuffed, RPD officers slammed him facedown into the ground, \nOfficer Mitchell then beat him with closed fists and punched him in the face. \nThough the man was restrained and lying face-down on the sidewalk, Officer \nMitchell also pepper sprayed him directly in the face. After a month in solitary \nconfinement at the Monroe County Jail, the man was ultimately transferred and \nadmitted to a medical facility for four months. The RPD officersโ brutal treatment \nof the restrained man was captured by four of the convenience storeโs security \ncameras. In 2017, the man was acquitted on all charges after jurors reviewed the \ncamera footage. That year, Kester was promoted to Investigator; the involved \nofficers are all still employed by RPD. The victimโs civil lawsuit is ongoing.   \n55 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 56 of 96\n \n \nโข  Christopher Pate: In 2018, Christopher Pate was beaten and tased by RPD \nofficers Michael Sippel and Spenser McAvoy even after he provided them with \nidentification proving he was not the suspect they were looking for. The officers \naccused him of โobstructing trafficโ when he walked across the street to get away \nfrom them. Sippel and McAvoy handcuffed Mr. Pate, tased him, and violently \nassaulted him. Mr. Pate suffered serious injuries including fractured occipital and \njaw bones. The City delayed release of the body worn camera footage for a year. \nOn video, after beating Mr. Pate, Officer Sippel says, โI blasted my hand off his \nhead,โ then laughs, โWrong guy.โ City Officials, including WARREN, did not \ntake action against the officers until after Mr. Pateโs attorney served notice on the \nCity that he would sue. Sippel was prosecuted and found guilty of third-degree \nmisdemeanor assault.  \n179.  Beyond bodily injury, the peopleโlike Plaintiffsโwho have been injured in \nthese encounters experience fear and anxiety, disruption to their everyday activities and \nemployment, and restrictions on their freedom to travel within their own neighborhoods and \ncities. They, and their families and friends, are impacted by these incidents. These encounters \nleave physical scars as well as deep dignitary harms including anguish and humiliation.  \nThere is a pattern and practice in the RPD of using excessive force  \nto suppress demonstrations against the RPDโs racist policing practice. \n \n180.  The RPDโs violent response to Black and brown protesters and those standing in \nsolidarity with them last fall was foreshadowed not only by RPD officersโ widespread unlawful \nuse of force against people of color in routine police encounters, but also by the Departmentโs \n56 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 57 of 96\n \nresponse to other protestsโin particular, its use of force against Black protesters and those allied \nin support of Black lives in the past.  \n181.  For example, in May 2015, Katrina Perkins was protesting police brutality on a \npublic street in a residential neighborhood, where two of her daughters and six of her \ngrandchildren resided. Though Ms. Perkins was peacefully demonstrating, RPD officers \nviolently seized and arrested her and then charged her with disorderly conduct and disruption. \nThose charges were dismissed two months later. Police violence is a personal issue for Ms. \nPerkins: her daughter Lashedica was shot three times by former-Deputy Chief Simmons in 2005. \n182.  In July 2016, in Rochester as across the nation, people took to the streets to \nuphold the sanctity of Black lives and call for an end to racist policing. In response to the BLM \nprotests, the RPD beat, shoved, and pepper sprayed protesters. As one young man described it: โI \nstarted to turn and they tackled me to the ground.โฆTheyโre beating citizens for no reason \nwhatsoever. I wasnโt doing anything. I was taking pictures.โ  \n183.  RPD officers, in keeping with their pattern and practice, particularly targeted \nBlack protesters with unlawful force, including Black journalists. Carlet Cleare and Justin Carter \nof WHAM-TV were both handcuffed and detained by police, even though Ms. Cleare was \nwearing a WHAM-TV shirt and they identified themselves as members of the press. Press \ncolleagues who were there described RPD ignoring white reporters standing right next to Ms. \nCleare and Mr. Carter and instead targeting the two Black journalists. Over the course of one \nweekend, Rochester had more arrests at its BLM protest than the rest of the nation combined. \n184.  By contrast, the RPD has not used force in policing protests that are not about \nBlack Lives and are made up of predominately white protestersโincluding for example the \n57 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 58 of 96\n \nseveral โBack the Blueโ protests that took place during the summer and fall 2020 as a show of \nsupport for the RPD in response to calls to โdefend the police.โ   \n185.  Despite widespread condemnation of the Departmentโs response to the September \n2020 protests, RPD officers continue to employ the same unlawful tactics. For example, on \nDecember 18, 2020, a group of approximately 20 protesters held a demonstration to object to the \nunjust eviction of a single mother and her three children in the middle of the winter during the \npandemic. New York State Assemblyman Demond Meeks attended the protest in solidarity; soon \nafter he arrived, he began a Facebook Live recording of the events. Cell phone video shows that \nimmediately after he arrived, two dozen or more RPD officers in riot gear approached the scene. \nThough Assemblyman Meeks was neither standing on the property nor interfering with the \nofficersโ execution of the warrant, officers went directly toward Meeks, informed him he was \nunder arrest, and ordered him to put his hands behind his back. Immediately after Meeks \ncomplied, officers repeatedly told him to โstop resistingโ even though the video shows he was \nnot resisting in any way. \n186.  RPD officersโ unconstitutional response to citizens exercising their right to free \nspeech is indicative of the Departmentโs widespread practice of interfering with the same when \ncitizens exercise their right to record officers engaging in abuses. In carrying out this practice, \nRPD officers frequently make legally baseless arrests of individuals engaged in First \nAmendment activity who do not comply with an officerโs unlawful order to stop recording or to \nleave the area. These arrests are commonly referred to as โcontempt of copโ arrests. To conceal \nthe illegality of these arrests, RPD officers charge the victim of the unlawful arrest with a low-\nlevel crime that does not require a criminal court complaint. This is known as a โcover charge.โ \n58 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 59 of 96\n \nThe most common cover charges are disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and obstruction of \ngovernmental administration. \n187.  Plaintiff EMILY GOOD was a victim of one such โcontempt of copโ arrest on \nMay 12, 2011, prior to joining NLG Rochester. GOOD was standing on the front lawn of her \nhome filmingโfrom 10 to 15 feet awayโRPD officers engaged in the traffic stop of a young \nBlack man. RPD Officer Mario Masic noticed GOOD filming and ordered her back into her \nhome, stating she seemed โanti-policeโ and he did not feel safe with her there. GOOD remained \ncalm and stated she was only standing on her property and did not pose any threat. Masic \nresponded that heโd had enough: โYou know what? Youโre going to go to jail.โ He then came \nonto GOODโs lawn, handcuffed her, and forcibly led her to a squad car while she pleaded for \nhim to explain why she was being arrested. A video of the unlawful arrest can be found here: \nhttps://tinyurl.com/yff34jaw.  \n188.  GOOD was charged with โobstructing governmental administrationโ but the \ncharges were later dropped. Though RPDโs internal view concluded Masic should not have \narrested GOOD for recording the traffic stop, then-Police Chief James Sheppard praised Masic \nfor maintaining his โprofessional demeanorโ in effecting the illegal arrest.  \n189.  The RPD has continued to target GOOD since this incident. For example, when \ncommunity activists held a meeting to discuss GOODโs case and the need for police \naccountability in Rochester, RPD officers responded to the meeting, harassed and intimidated the \npeople present, and falsely ticketed all the cars parked outside of the meeting space. \n190.  In a strikingly similar incident last June, Tobias Massey was also falsely arrested \nfor recording RPD officers violently arresting a man in his front yard. Mr. Massey was woken up \nby screaming from his front yard, where three RPD officers were on top of a Black man, who \n59 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 60 of 96\n \nwas crying that he could not breathe and did not want to die. Mr. Massey went outside to record \nthe event. When the RPD officers noticed he was recording, they chased him into his home, \nwrestled him down, handcuffed and arrested him. Mr. Massey was taken to the emergency room \nbecause of injuries he sustained from the encounter, where the officers gave him an appearance \nticket charging him with resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration for filming \nthe police. After reviewing the video, former Chief SINGLETARY dropped the charges against \nMr. Massey. Mr. Masseyโs civil lawsuit against the three RPD officers is pending. All three \nofficers remain employed by the RPD.   \n191.  In a report this month, the Monroe County Public Defenderโs Office observed that \ncertain charges are regularly filed against a defendant where excessive use of force is alleged by \nthe client or a defendant has injuries that appear to be more severe than the situation warranted. \nThese charges include Assault in the Second Degree, Resisting Arrest, and Obstruction of \nGovernmental Administration. \n192.  Examples of this practice, detailed above, include the false charges filedโand all \nlater dismissedโin the cases of Katrina Perkins, Miriam McKnight, Plaintiff GOOD, and Tobias \nMassey. \n193.  Plaintiff DYNASTY BUGGSโs experience with the RPD is emblematic of these \nillegal patterns: BUGGS was subjected to excessive force, prevented from recording her abuse \nby the police, and then charged with false cover charges. On December 18, 2019, Defendants \nVANBREDERODE and PASZKO unlawfully stopped BUGGS while she was driving. \nVANBREDERODE approached the driverโs side and ordered BUGGS to exit the car without \nlawful justification. When BUGGS objected and tried to record what was happening on her \nphone, VANBREDERODE grabbed her phone and threw it. He then pepper sprayed her in the \n60 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 61 of 96\n \nface while she was still in the car. After, VANBREDERODE forcibly removed BUGGS from the \ncar, placed handcuffs on her wrists, and pepper sprayed her again after she was handcuffed. \n194.  VANBREDERODE falsely charged BUGGS with obstruction of governmental \nadministration, resisting arrest, and driving without a license. All the false charges were \ndismissed at her first court date. \n195.  After VANBREDERODE pepper sprayed BUGGS the first time, her cousin \nLonnie Buchananโwho was in the front passenger seatโexited the vehicle. PASZKO \nimmediately seized Mr. Buchanan, threw him against the side of the car, pepper sprayed him in \nthe face, handcuffed him in an unreasonably tight manner, then placed him in the back of the \npolice car. PASZKO falsely accused Mr. Buchanan of committing a crime; those charges were \nalso dismissed.   \n196.  Thereafter, BUGGS tried to file an internal complaint against VANBREDERODE \nfor his unlawful use of force, but she was repeatedly thwarted. She called the RPD several times \nto make a complaint, but no one would speak to her or tell her how to file a formal complaint. \nEventually, BUGGS spoke with an RPD supervisor who told her she could not file a complaint \nand that she โshould have gotten out of the fucking car.โ  \n197.  The widespread practice of RPD officers using force against individuals for \nfilming them while they are performing their police duties in public places, and then filing \npatently false โcover chargesโ in an attempt to justify their unlawful conduct, is part and parcel \nof the RPDโs culture of impunity. Even when these false charges are dismissed by prosecutors, \nand the officersโ unlawful conduct is captured by video evidence, the RPD routinely fails to \ndiscipline the offending officers. This failure of supervision and oversight encourages officers to \nuse force without justification because they know there are no consequences.  \n61 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 62 of 96\n \nThe City and RPD have utterly failed to train, supervise, and discipline officers,  \ndespite the widespread unconstitutional practices described above. \n \n198.  For years, the City has been deliberately indifferent to the obvious need to \nsupervise and discipline officers who use excessive force against citizens, particularly citizens of \ncolor. Instead, the RPD has maintained a sham internal disciplinary system that consistently and \ndeliberately fails to discipline substantial numbers of officers who are known to have engaged in \nracist policing and unlawful use of force.   \n199.  The RPD investigates civilian complaints internally through its Professional \nStandards Sections (โPSSโ). From 2008 to 2013, the PSS did not sustain a single civilian \ncomplaint for unnecessary use of force. During that time, countless people of color were injured \nand at least oneโHayden Blackmanโwas killed by RPD officers. Examples include: Benny \nWarr, a 52-year-old Black man and wheelchair-bound amputee who was beaten by RPD officers \nwhile waiting for the bus in 2013; Robinn Turner, a Black woman who had her rib broken by \nRPD Officer Joseph Ferrigno in 2010, after he body slammed and assaulted her; Darren \nWilliams, a Black man who was punched in the face and thrown to the ground by Ferrigno in \n2012, while Ferrigno uttered racial slurs about โteaching [him] to respect authorityโ; and \nDwayne Ivery, a Black man who was punched in the head and tackled to the ground by Officer \nAlexander Baldauf, who continued to beat Mr. Ivery even after he was placed in handcuffs. The \nunprovoked beating of Mr. Ivery was captured on video but Baldauf was never disciplined, nor \nwere any of the other RPD officers in the above incidents.  \n200.  Based on the most recent data available, the PSS investigated 65 officers for 144 \ncomplaints of misconduct in 2019. Of the 61 use of force complaints, PSSโs overall โsustainedโ \nrate was approximately 1% (with a single sustained allegation). Of the 7 discourtesy complaints, \nthe overall PSS sustained rate was 0% (with none sustained).  \n62 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 63 of 96\n \n201.  On paper, the Civilian Review Board also reviews complaints against officers. \nBut the CRB does not have any independent investigative power and almost always reaches the \nsame outcome as PSS. In 2019, for instance, the CRB exonerated officers in 48 use of force \ncomplaintsโtwo more than PSS (which exonerated 46 complaints).  \n202.  RPDโs disciplinary process ultimately ends with the Chief of Police. Any outcome \nincluding discipline is completely at his or her discretion. From 2001 to 2016, of 923 civilian-\ngenerated allegations of force, the Chief sustained only 16โor 1.7%. One former CRB member \nrecognized the futility of the process: โI remember one case when our panel and the investigating \nofficers separately concluded that unreasonable, abusive force had been used by the arresting \nofficers. The chief overruled all of usโwe had no authority or power. I quit after that.โ \n203.  In the rare case where RPD officer misconduct has been exposed through video \nrecordings or court proceedings, leading the Chief to sustain an allegation, the RPD has not \nimposed meaningful discipline against the offending officer. From 2001 to 2015, for example, \nthe harshest penalty given out for the 16 sustained use of force complaints were 6 suspensions, \nmost ranging from 1 to 20 days.  \n204.  By comparison, Officer Justin Linton failed to report for duty in July 2015 and \nlied to his supervisor about the reasonโsaying his flight had been delayed when, in fact, he had \nnot booked a return flight until the following day. Linton received a 30-day suspension for \nโAbsence from Dutyโ and โTruthfulnessโ violations. In 2005, David Williams conducted a \nbackground check using the RPD system without authority. He received a 30-day suspension.   \n205.  The RPD sends a clear message to its officers based on the degree of discipline (if \nany) meted out for excessive force against people of color compared to other internal \n63 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 64 of 96\n \ndepartmental violations. That message is that RPD will tolerate, if not condone, violence against \nBlack and brown people.    \n206.  For example, Sergeant Kevin Leckinger was found to have used unjustified force \nduring his June 2017 arrest of Joseph Gangemiโincluding grabbing Gangemi by his neck, \napplying clavicle notch pressure point while Mr. Gangemi was constrained, and repeatedly \ntelling Mr. Gangemi to โcalm downโ while applying โa pain compliance technique.โ Leckinger \nwas also found, based on body worn camera video, to have said: โBring your wrists behind your \nback or I will rip your arms out of your socketsโ and โStop being an idiot, honestly, how stupid \nare you?,โ while pulling upwards on Mr. Gangemiโs arms. Leckinger signed a settlement with \nthe RPD three years later, in 2020, agreeing to a penalty of 8 days suspension, with 4 to be taken \nas forfeited vacation time.  \n207.  RPD officer Jason Vaughn was investigated for unlawful use of force against \nBrian Norford after he hit Mr. Norford with a patrol car in February 2016. Although video \nfootage showed Vaughn intentionally striking Mr. Norfordโthe CRB review notes the โvehicle \nwas headed directly in a direct line toward subjectโ and that Vaughnโs alternative explanation \n(that he was aiming for a driveway that was not near Mr. Norford) did not make senseโhe was \ndisciplined only for failing to fill out a โFleet Accidentโ report and received a letter of \nreprimand.  \n208.  In 2013, Defendant MATTHEW DRAKE was also found by the PSS to have \ndriven his marked police vehicle in โan unsafe mannerโ into a crowd of peopleโstriking an \nindividual who sustained injuries that necessitated medical attention. But DRAKE received only \na letter of reprimand. \n64 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 65 of 96\n \n209.  Put simply, the RPD has a sham disciplinary and internal investigation process. \nAfter an assault, officers routinely falsify documents or fabricate claims to cover up their \nunlawful conduct. RPD officers also routinely fail to report any use of force or under report the \namount of force used in an attempt to justify their use of unnecessary and excessive forceโ\ngenerally by claiming the victim had resisted arrest or otherwise โobstructedโ officers. Use of \nforce reports frequently include implausible narratives of a single individual who is reported to \nhave assaulted or threatened the officers, even when unarmed and restrained, while that officer is \naccompanied by multiple other officers.  \n210.  Even when a complaint is made, the RPD systemically fails to conduct \nmeaningful investigations into its officersโ uses of force. When the PSS does conduct an \ninvestigation, the supervisors routinely credit officersโ accounts that are implausible on their \nface, inconsistent with citizensโ injuries, or obviously manufactured collaboratively after the fact. \nRelatedly, the Department has for years failed to credit citizen accounts of officer violence, even \nwhen those accounts are supported by video footage or other eyewitnesses and consistent with \ndocumented injuries.  \n211.  By intentionally failing to in any way meaningfully supervise or discipline \nofficers who are known to have used excessive force against Black and brown people, \nsupervisors signal to officers that they can engage in unnecessary and excessive force with \nimpunity because their lies and attempts to cover up wrongdoing will not be questioned.  \n212.  Rather, instead of disciplining officers known to engage in racist, violent policing, \nthe RPD has a practice of commending and promoting officers who have credible (or even \nsustained) allegations of excessive force against them. For example, the Department awarded \nOfficer Patrick Giancursio its โOfficer of the Yearโ Award in May 2017, even though he was \n65 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 66 of 96\n \nsuspended at the time while the Department allegedly investigated his use of force against \nAlexander Grassies in an April 2017 incident that was caught on surveillance tape. Giancursio \nwas made an Investigator three years later.  \n213.  In 2011, a PSS investigation determined that Officer Gary Wegman used \nโinappropriate forceโ on a Latino manโspecifically that Wegman struck him in the face with a \nstraight punch without justification. That same year, Wegman received a โChiefโs Letter of \nRecognition.โ The following year, in 2012, Wegman pled guilty to inappropriate use of force; he \nreceived a letter of reprimand in his file. He was nevertheless honored with both an โExcellent \nPolice Service Awardโ and a โChiefโs Letter of Recognitionโ that year. He has since been \npromoted to Sergeant.      \n214.  The rampant use of force by several notorious officersโknown throughout \nRochesterโs Black and brown communitiesโmake clear that RPDโs internal disciplinary \nmechanisms are entirely feckless. The Department knowingly has and continues to retain officers \nwith demonstrated history of using unnecessary and excessive force against people of color.  \nExamples of officers who have demonstrated such propensities include but are not limited to the \nfollowing:  \n215.  Thomas Rodriguez: Until he was permitted to voluntarily retire with his full \npension last spring, Officer Rodriguez was known for using excessive force and seriously \ninjuring citizens in Black neighborhoods during his thirty-year career in the RPD. For example, \nin August 2002, he participated in the brutal beating and TASERing of Lawrence Rogers, which \nled to his asphyxiation and death; in 2016, he participated in the beating of 17-year-old Ricky \nBryant, fracturing Mr. Bryantโs orbital socket. And in 2017, Rodriguez placed DKuan Webb in \nan illegal chokehold, which was recorded on his body camera. The video was not released \n66 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 67 of 96\n \npublicly. But the judge dismissed all criminal charges against Webb, and the City settled his \nlawsuit for $125,000 only days after it was filed.  \n216.  Mario โCowboyโ Masic: Despite an egregious history of excessive force, Masic \nalso voluntarily retired with his full pension last spring after fifteen years in the Department. \nRochester residents dubbed him โCowboyโ because of his well-known lawless tactics. Masic \nembraced the nicknameโhe even had a โcowboyโ themed weddingโand became notorious for \nreferring to himself as โthe Cowboyโ during interactions with citizens. It was Masic who \nillegally arrested Plaintiff GOOD in 2011 because she was lawfully recording him stopping a \nBlack man from her own property. And in 2014, Masic burst into a laundromat where Quintin \nKeene, a Black man, was talking to his grandmother on the phone, rushed him without warning, \nthreatened to shoot him if he did not comply, beat him, pepper sprayed him, and then falsely \ncharged him. The false charges were all ultimately dismissed, with the Judge stating: โThis case \nraises a lot of issues for our community.โ  The City later paid to settle Mr. Keeneโs civil suit. \nOnly a year later, in 2015, Masic and other RPD officers were harassing Rasheed Griner, a \nyoung Black man, and his family; when Mr. Griner asked for Masicโs badge number, Masic \nstated, โIโve had enough of your mouthโ and hit Mr. Griner in the face with his baton. Mr. Griner \nreceived stitches for his facial injuries; Masicโs false charges against him were dismissed after \nthe Judge determined the arrest was unlawful.  \n217.  Officer Joseph Ferrigno: Ferrigno, who is still employed by the City is well-\nknown for using unlawful force against Black and brown citizens. Ferrigno joined the force in \n2007. By April 2016, he had at least 23 citizen complaints against him. His egregious violence \nincludes slamming a Black woman to the ground, breaking her rib; punching a Black man in the \nface and repeatedly striking him in the head and body; and throwing a disabled Black man from \n67 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 68 of 96\n \nhis wheelchair, pepper spraying, and beating him with the help of his RPD partner, Anthony \nLiberatore. The man, Benny Warr, suffered three broken ribs and irreparable damage to his leg. \nWarr filed a complaint with the CRB but Ferrigno and Liberatore were exonerated despite a \ncitizen capturing the beating on film. In April 2016, Ferrigno mistakenly pursued a Black man, \nSilvon Simmons, and shot him three timesโin his back, buttock, and right thigh. Simmons had a \nfractured rib, collapsed lung, and bullets that were left in his chest and pelvis. He was charged \nwith attempting to kill a police officer but the gun allegedly found at the scene did not have \nSimmonsโ DNA or his fingerprints on it. The RPD also would not test Simmonsโ clothing for \ngunshot residue despite his repeated requests. And a woman who was directly across the street \ntestified she heard only the number of shots fired by Ferrigno that nightโno more. Simmons was \nultimately clearled of all criminal charges. Ferrigno was nevertheless cleared by PSS and the \nCRB; he was also honored with the โOfficer of the Monthโ award for his actions that April.  \n218.  The only discipline Ferrigno has received to date is a three-day suspension for \nโsecuringโ a 13-year-old juvenile without contacting his parent in 2013. One of the involved \nchildren said Ferrigno and Liberatore told them, if the kids were older, the officers would โbeat \nthe fuck out of [them].โ He remains an RPD officer.  \nThe City and RPD have created, condoned, and encouraged a culture of impunity for \nracist, violent policing of Black and brown people by RPD officers. \n \n219.  The violence inflicted by RPD officers on Rochesterโs Black and brown \ncommunities is appalling and unlawful. But it is neither a surprise nor a coincidence; rather, it is \nthe tragically foreseeable result of a Department that has for decades turned a blind eye to racist \nactions by officers and still today employs officers who have used racial slurs and shown \naffiliation for white supremacist groups.  \n68 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 69 of 96\n \n220.  The Departmentโs culture of racismโboth implicit and overtโis deeply \nentrenched. In 1984, RPD officer Ron Evangelista, then-President of the Locust Club, stated in \nan interview with the Democrat and Chronicle: โMinorities, not just Blacks, are not popular with \npolice, who are mostly white, middle-class people.โ Evangelista repeatedly dismissed concerns \nabout racism within the department. When asked about how to improve trust between Black \nresidents and the RPD, he responded that Black leaders should stop promoting โpolice mistrustโ \nand rejected calls for civilian oversight as unnecessary โpublic appeasementโ for Black people \nwho felt the police cannot police themselves. RPD officers re-elected Evangelista as police union \npresident for nearly three decades; he served from 1981 until 2008.  \n221.  Current-Locust Club President Mazzeo echoed this view more recently when he \nacknowledged there is some level of systemic racism in the RPD.  \n222.  LoFaso, in analyzing the Departmentโs disproportionate use of force against \nBlack and brown people, also observed: โMost officers who join the RPD are white, male, from \nmiddle-class backgrounds, and have little life experience outside of schoolโฆ. [T]hey are now \ninteracting daily with racial and ethnic minorities whose lived experiences are vastly different \nfrom theirs.โ  \n223.  Indeed, in contrast to the population of Rochester, the RPD is overwhelmingly \nwhite, and nearly all live outside of Rochester. Though only 37% of Rochesterโs population is \nwhite, 75% of RPD officers are white. This is despite the fact that the City has been under a \nfederal consent decree for the past 46 years requiring at least 25% of the Department be officers \nof color. When that decree was entered in 1975, 25% of the Cityโs population was Black or \nbrown. But this overwhelmingly white police force now patrols a City that is predominantly \nBlack and Latinx (40% and 19% respectively). Moreover, only 6.6% of RPD officers live in \n69 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 70 of 96\n \nRochester. By long failing to hire a proportionate number of officers of color and Rochester \nresidents, the City has created a police force that is wholly separate from the community it is \nmeant to serve.  \n \n \n224.  The RPDโs culture of racist, violent policing was on full display in the 1992 \nfederal trial of RPDโs HIT squad officers. Dozens of white officers testified, on condition of \nimmunity, about witnessingโand participating inโphysical abuse of โsuspectsโ in Rochesterโs \nBlack and brown neighborhoods. There was also specific testimony of misconduct by the \ndefendant officers. For example, police witnesses testified that one defendant officer, Sergeant \nThomas Alessi, kicked a suspect in the mouth, knocking out his teeth, and had held a gun to \nanother suspectโs head while the man was bleeding.  \n225.  After the acquittals, despite these damning accounts of widespread brutality and \ncover-ups, the RPD did not apologize to the community or display remorse. Instead, RPD \nofficers openly celebrated and officials did nothing to reign in the rampant misconduct that had \nbeen exposed. On hearing the verdict, Alessi declared: โI can get my pistol permit back.โ  \n70 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 71 of 96\n \n226.  The RPDโs permissive attitude toward officers who openly espouse violent, \nunlawful inclinations towards the citizens they purport to serve persists. In 1997, for example, \nRPD officer John Fiorica started Crime Dawg Gear, a T-shirt company marketed toward RPD \nand other law enforcement. On the Crime Dawg website, he described companyโs T-shirt slogans \nas all coming โfrom ideas inspired by fellow officers.โ Some of those designs are shown below: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n71 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 72 of 96\n \n227.  On the Crime Dawg website, Fiorica expressly thanked his partner, now-Captain \nFrank Umbrino and various โCrime Dawg Gear supermodelsโ including Officer Theresa Bell \n(now Dearcop), who has been made an Investigator, and John Koonmen who currently \ncommands the Departmentโs Special Operations Unit. Anthony Bongiovanni, โThe Friskโ \nmodel, recently retired as a Sergeant after over 30 years on the force. He is named as a defendant \nin at least two excessive force lawsuits pending against the City. \n228.  Though the companyโs website has since been taken down, Fiorica openly \nmaintained Crime Dawg Gear for at least 10 years, selling apparel, including infant clothing and \nthongs, and promotional products with these slogans to RPD and other law enforcement officers. \nFiorica was made an Investigator in 2001 (when the website was still active). He remains an \nRPD Investigator today. \n229.   The RPDโs longstanding and continued acceptance ofโand complete failure to \ndisciplineโofficers who overtly reference killing or beating citizens sets the tone for RPD \nofficers to act with impunity when they, unsurprisingly, use unjustified violence against \nresidents, particularly Black and brown people \n230.  Racist policing, including racial epithets and derogatory language, by RPD \nofficers is widespread and consistently tolerated by fellow officers and the Department. The \nbelow examples are illustrative.  \n231.  In 2002, RPD Officer Brian Sexstone and several other RPD officer created a \nmemo entitled โGhetto Lingoโ that listed over 70 street slang terms and definitionsโ like \nโsammichโ for โsandwichโ or โreap what you soapโ for โreap what you sowโโwhich Sexstone \nsaid he wrote as a โjoke.โ After the memo came to light, Sexstone was terminated by the RPDโ\nbut only for a few years.  \n72 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 73 of 96\n \n232.  Sexstone was rehired in 2006, and within two years, he was accused of making \nracist remarks to two Black citizens, including calling a Black woman the โn-wordโ while \narresting her and asking when she would โlearn white people donโt care about Black people.โ \nThe woman was acquitted of all charges after the Judge heard her testimony. A spokesperson for \nthe RPD at the time said Sexstone was on active duty and no internal investigation was being \ndone. Sexstone has never been disciplined and remains an RPD officer.  \n233.  In 2005, an RPD officer verbally harassed 12-year-old Shakirrah Sinclair, calling \nher a bitch. When her 16-year-old brother Jamar tried to report the officerโs conduct, he was \nassaulted by the officer, who said he โcouldnโt stand n---- like youโ and called him an โasshole.โ \nMultiple RPD officers then pepper sprayed and arrested both Jamar and Shakirrah. The children \nwere both treated at the hospital, and the criminal charges against them dismissed. The City paid \nto settle a lawsuit brought on the childrenโs behalf, but, on information and belief, the officers \nwere never disciplined. The one who used racial slurs voluntarily retired in 2016.   \n234.  In 2013, three Black teenagersโ15-year-old Raliek Redd and two of his \nteammates on the Edison Tech High School basketball teamโwere on the sidewalk at the \ndesignated pick up on Main Street for a school bus to transport them to a game. They were \napproached by an RPD officer who ordered them to move and, when they explained they were \nwaiting for the school bus, the RPD officer handcuffed them, searched their belongings and \narrested them for purportedly โobstructing trafficโ on the sidewalk. While they were at the scene \nin the back of the police cars, their coach and teammates arrived to catch the bus also. When \ntheir coach tried to explain that Raliek and his two teammates were waiting for the bus and had \ndone nothing wrong, the officer told him: โIf I had a big enough caravan, I would arrest all of \nyou.โ The young men were transported to the PSB where they were subjected to a humiliating \n73 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 74 of 96\n \nstrip search. The criminal charges against them were all dismissed the next month when the \nDistrict Attorney refused to prosecute them. The City paid a total of $50,000 to settle the three \nlawsuits, but the officer was never disciplined.  \n \n \n235.  A year later, in 2016, Lentorya Parker went to pick up her 6-year-old daughter \nfrom daycare, when she encountered several RPD officers on the street. After she yelled at the \npolice, โWhat are you doing?,โ Officer Jonathan Marsh told her to stop yelling and get out of the \nstreet. As she turned to go into the yard, Marsh said, โOh, too late.โ As captured on bodyworn \ncamera video, Marsh then ran and tackled Parker to the ground from behind as other RPD \nofficers joined him. Ms. Parker was pepper sprayed three times, as her young daughter was \nscreaming nearby. She suffered injuries to her back and elbow. \n236.  Officers can then be heard on the camera footage discussing what to charge \nParker withโone asks: โWere there five people around?,โ wondering if she can be charged with \n74 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 75 of 96\n \nโinciting a riotโ on the nearly deserted street. Another officer, while watching Ms. Parkerโs \ndaughter says to the little girl: โSorry, your momโs an animal.โ Ms. Parker was charged with \ndisorderly conduct, resisting arrest, harassment, and obstructing government administration. The \ncriminal charges against Ms. Parker were all dismissed. All six of the RPD officers involved, \nincluding Marsh, are still employed by the Department. None was disciplined for the incident; at \nleast one has since been honored by the Department for his โDistinguished Service.โ \n237.  In March 2017, Rakim Yancey, a Black man, was accosted by RPD Sergeant \nTimothy Pancoe who used racist language when ordering Mr. Yancey to move his car. In \nresponse to Mr. Yanceyโs asking why he used that language, Pancoe pepper sprayed and \nassaulted Mr. Yancey. Two other RPD officers, Chris Kosch and Bradley Pike, were also \ninvolved in assaulting Mr. Yanceyโwho required hospital treatment for wrist fractures, a \nchipped tooth, and multiple contusions and abrasions. None of the involved officers have been \ndisciplined; Pancoe was promoted to Lieutenant in 2019. Mr. Yanceyโs civil lawsuit against the \nofficers remains pending.  \n238.  During a City Councilโs public forum in March 2021, several Rochester residents \ngave statements about the RPDโs racist policing practices, in particular the verbal and physical \nabuse of people of color. For example, one white resident who runs the Rochester Teen \nEmpowerment Center spoke about comments made to him firsthand by RPD officers about the \nBlack children he works withโlike โI hate these effing kidsโโor officers describing their job as \nโkeeping crime contained in these areas so it doesnโt get close to where we live.โ He continued: \nโI have met with Chief after Chief giving officersโ names, quotes, actions I have seen, heard, and \nheard aboutโwe still cannot get these officers off these streets.โ He further highlighted the \n75 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 76 of 96\n \ndamage done to Rochesterโs young Black and brown people by officersโ โoffensive and racistโ \ncomments.  \n239.  On the rare occasion the Department investigates and sustains racist behavior by \nits officers, those officers receive little discipline, no increased supervision, and no remediation. \nFor example, in 2015, Officer Ryan Hartley was investigated for an off-duty argument at a bar \nduring which he yelled, among other things, โgo back to the hoodโ at a Black employee and \nโbitchโ and โc---โ at a woman bartender. Based on the testimony of multiple eyewitnesses, the \nPSS investigation determined Hartley had โdirected prejudicial comments toward an African \nAmerican employee.โ Four years later, in 2019, he was suspended for 12 days without pay, with \n6 of those days to be forfeited from his vacation. Hartley remains an RPD officer today.  \n \n \n240.  In 2013, the RPD received multiple concerned calls regarding Officer Andrew \nKlein. seen in the photograph above with his tongue sticking out driving his marked Rochester \npolice vehicle with a black stuffed-toy monkey hanging from its spotlight. Klein received only \n10 days suspension, with 3 days taken from paid leave. During his interview with PSS, Klein \n76 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 77 of 96\n \nalluded to being directed to stay out of a predominantly Black neighborhood, โfor about six \nmonths because of an incident that happened, you know, a while ago.โ But Klein denied having \nany โproblem with Black people,โ claiming his intention in hanging the monkey on his car was \nto attract kids. \n241.  The Departmentโs racial bias is evident in other ways. For example, the RPD \nroutinely deploys militarized-forcesโincluding a mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicle, State \nPolice helicopters, pepper spray and pepper balls, and officers clad in riot gearโto police the \nannual Puerto Rican festival. Yet the Department sends recruitment officers to the Cityโs annual \nโLittle Italyโ Italian festival to look for future RPD officers:  \n \n \n242.    Members of Rochesterโs Puerto Rican community have for years pressed RPD \non the militarized police presence at their festival and raised officersโ problematic behavior at the \nfestival. Seventeen-year-old Rickey Bryant was stopped and beaten by several RPD officers after \nthe festival in 2017, for example. Yet again, the RPD has not changed its tactics. \n77 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 78 of 96\n \n243.  A 2017 Report on the Department observed that โstructures of white \nsupremacyโฆmay exist in the RPDโs culture and practices.โ The examples above bear this \nout, as does the following: \n244.  In 2011, PSS investigated RPD Officer Braddon Elliott for conducting personal \nbusiness during his shifts. That business was related to his involvement in a motorcycle club of \nwhich he was a co-founder and club Treasurer. Though heavily redacted, the interview of Elliot \nreveals that his motorcycle club has only white members. When questioned about a graphic of \nโtwo fists and an 88โ featured on T-shirts โfor people to buy and show their support for the \nclub,โ Elliott responded the number โ88โ represents the phrase โHeil Hitler,โ because H is the \neighth letter in the alphabet. The number โ88โ features prominently in white supremacist \nideology.  \n245.  Three RPD supervisorsโSergeants Kavanaugh, Hayes, and Gaglianoโconducted \nthe interview. Towards the interviewโs end, after having testified about the clubโs T-shirts \nfeaturing a symbol of white supremacy and other club media, Officer Elliott is cut off by Sgt. \nGagliano, who states: โIf thatโs your answer, thatโs your answer. Who gives a shit. Letโs end it.โ \nSgt. Gagliano further complains, โweโve been here for an hour discussing this shit.โ     \n246.  Despite Elliottโs admission that he was a founding member and third-in-command \nof a club that supported white supremacy and that he wore a white supremacist symbol, the \nDepartment did not discipline him. Instead, years later, Elliott was suspended for five days for \nโneglecting his duties as a sworn police officer by attending meetings [] of the motorcycle club \nwhile on duty.โ  \n247.  For decades, the RPD has been notorious for its racist, brutal policing. But City \nand RPD officials have ratified, permitted, and encouraged RPD officersโ physical and verbal \n78 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 79 of 96\n \nabuse of Black and brown citizens by denying the prevalence of racist attitudes among white \nRPD officers, refusing to investigate or discipline such attitudesโeven in the face of overt \nevidenceโand covering up the prevalence of these racist attitudes among its officers.  \n248.  The Departmentโs longstanding permissive attitude and failure to train, supervise \nand discipline officers who have engaged in egregious displays of racism or force has fostered a \nculture of impunity that has led RPD officers to understand they can beat people of color without \nconsequence.   \nCity and RPD officials are deliberately indifferent to, and complicit in,  \nthe widespread unconstitutional abuses by RPD officers. \n \n249.  As Mayor WARREN has admitted: โInstitutional structural racism led to Daniel \nPrudeโs death. I wonโt deny it. I stand before it and I call for justice upon it.โ But those words \nring hollow to the countless Black and brown residents of Rochester who have watched \nWARREN and other City officials for years take no action to curb violence by officers against \ncommunities of color.  \n250.  City Officials and the RPD have instead maintained a custom or practice of a \nโcode of silence,โ pursuant to which officer misconductโincluding excessive force, \nmanufacturing of false charges, racial discrimination, and the use of racial epithets or other \nderogatory languageโis routinely not reported by fellow officers or disciplined or held \naccountable by the Department. To the contrary, officers acting pursuant to the code customarily \nengage in misconduct themselves to cover up misconduct they witnessed by a fellow officer. \nPolice brutality in particular is indicative of a โcode of silenceโ because it often occurs in the \npresence of, or with the knowledge of, other officers. \n251.  By the time of Mr. Prudeโs death, it was clear to the RPD and City Officials that \nthis pervasive โcode of silenceโ was leading officers to engage in race-based, unlawful conduct. \n79 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 80 of 96\n \nNevertheless, City and RPD Officials failed to take any necessary steps to remedy the \nDepartmentโs rampant culture of both engaging in abuses and affirmatively shielding fellow \nofficers from any accountability. That is because City Officials and RPD supervisors are \nthemselves complicit inโand a core part ofโthe Departmentโs โcode of silenceโ  \n252.  On March 12, 2021, the Final Report of the Independent Investigation into the \nCityโs Response to the Death of Daniel Prude was published. The Investigation entailed six \nmonthsโ worth of document review and the depositions of thirteen critical witnesses, including \nDefendants WARREN and SINGLETARY. The Final Report concludes that City Officials \nsuppressed information about the arrest and death of Daniel Prude from Mr. Prudeโs family and \nfrom the public. And that City Officials, including WARREN, subsequently made statements \nthat were not truthful about the extent and timing of their knowledge of these circumstances. \n253.  Internally the RPD and City cited concerns that publicly releasing the videoโ\nwhich clearly shows RPD officers joking and laughing while Mr. Prude asphyxiatesโโmight \nspark civil unrestโ in Rochester. Senior Officials also expressed concern that they would lose \ntheir jobs if the video were to be released.  \n254.  In other words, consistent with past practice of intentional cover up and allowing \nofficers at all levels to act with almost complete impunity, City Officials and the RPD were \nconcerned not with public transparency or accountability but with conspiring to suppress the \nfootage and protect the officers and the Department. City Officials and RPD Defendants took \nseveral overt steps in furtherance of that conspiracy.  \n255.  For example, although Mr. Prudeโs family was legally entitled to the footage after \nsubmitting a FOIL request on April 3, 2020, RPD placed pressure on the Cityโs Law Department \nto withhold the footageโknowing it had no lawful basis to do so. \n80 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 81 of 96\n \n256.  Further, though it was evident to City Officials that there was no lawful basis to \nwithhold the footage, they nonetheless engaged in other tactics to prevent its release including, \nfor instance, telling Mr. Prudeโs attorney he had to submit a HIPPA Authorization Form, which \nwas not legally required for disclosure, to unnecessarily delay the Cityโs response. \n257.  In the meantime, the Cityโwith WARRENโs knowledgeโattempted to settle Mr. \nPrudeโs case before releasing the footage to his family. But the footage was inadvertently sent to \nMr. Prudeโs lawyer.  \n258.  A few weeks prior, on July 13, 2020, the RPD quietly updated its departmental \npolicy on usage of the PepperBall Launching System (โPLSโ). Specifically, the Department \namended the policy to allow officers on the patrol division to use the PLS. Prior to this \namendment, only officers on the Special Weapons and Tactics (โSWATโ) team were eligible to \nuse PLS. The RPD did not update the policy in any other way.  \n259.  Under RPD General Order 630, an officer is ineligible to join the SWAT team if \nhe has โany instance of sustained excessive forceโ or โseriousโ misconduct in his disciplinary \nhistory. The Patrol Division (or Mobile Field Force team) does not have any such eligibility \nrequirement.  \n260.  On information and belief, the Department updated this policy to ensure more \nofficers could (and would) be able to use the PLS in anticipation of protests after the suppressed \nfootage was released. By removing any โdisciplinary history check,โ the Department knew or \nhad reason to know that RPD officers would use excessive force when engaging with \nprotestersโwhich they did. \n261.  Defendant WILLIAM BAKER is one such officer. In 2016, BAKER was \nassigned to police the Rochester BLM protests. He was subsequently investigated by PSS after \n81 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 82 of 96\n \nseveral news outlets provided video footage depicting him using force against two different \nprotesters. The PSS investigation determined that BAKER: (1) used excessive force on an \nindividual who was not resisting by โdirecting two or three jabs to [his] upper bodyโ; (2) failed \nto document his use of force as required by department policy; and (3) undertook โunnecessaryโ \nactions that โwere impetuous and committed with haste,โ specifically raising his baton to head-\nlevel and directing the crowd to โGet the fuck backโ and โBack the fuck up.โ BAKER was \nsuspended for just three days as a result.  \n262.  Despite a sustained finding of excessive forceโin the context of a BLM protest \nno lessโBAKER was outfitted with a PLS on September 3, 2020. Had the Department not \nchanged its policy to expand officer access to the PLS in July 2020, BAKER would not have \nbeen eligible for the SWAT team and so would not have had access to the PepperBall System \nwhich, upon information and belief, he used to inflict illegal force on protesters.  \n263.  The Cityโs practice of protecting RPD officers, like BAKER, rather than its \ncitizens has directly contributed to the culture of insularity, acceptance, and callousness that \npermeates the Rochester Police Department.  \nโBUSINESS AS USUALโ \n264.  Although Mayor WARREN, Chief HERRIOTT-SULLIVAN, and other City \nofficials are again โtalking the talkโ of police reform, while the eyes of the world are on them, \nthe City and RPD have paid similar lip service over the past 40 years, while meaningful, lasting \nreform has never come. If anything, these last seven months have confirmed that the Cityโs \npromise of change is yet again hollow: even with a new interim Chief and command staff, the \nDepartment either cannot or will not fix itself. \n265.  On January 29, 2021, seven RPD officers responded to a call about a family \ndispute. When they arrived, a nine-year-old Black girl was crying and emotionally distraught. \n82 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 83 of 96\n \nRather than comfort her, RPD officers chased her, threw her on the snow-covered ground, and \nhandcuffed herโeven though she was not under arrest. Officers including Defendants PASZKO \nand VANBREDERODE then forced her into the back of a patrol car, where the child was \nsobbing and begging officers to let her see her parent. One officer told her, โStop acting like a \nchild,โ to which the nine-year-old responded: โI am a child.โ \n266.  Even though she was not under arrest, clearly in emotional distress, and restrained \nin the back of a police car, RPD Officer Alexander Lombard decided to pepper spray her at \npoint-blank range. None of the other officers, including Defendants PASZKO and \nVANBREDERODE who were standing right there, intervened at any point to stop this excessive \nuse of force against a young girl. She was taken to Rochester General for treatment.  \n267.  The next day, RPD issued a press release stating the officer was โrequiredโฆto \ntake the minor to the groundโ and โrequiredโฆto use an irritant on the minorโ because she \nโrefusedโ to place her feet in the patrol car.  \n268.  While Chief HERRIOTT-SULLIVAN acknowledged in a public hearing that the \nDepartment should not have used the word โrequiredโ about the officerโs actions, she refused to \nanswer written questions about the incident from the PABโsuch as โWhat RPD policies, \nprocedures, or written directives require an officer to use pepper sprayโฆon someone refusing to \nplace her feet in a patrol car?โ and โDo you believe it can it ever be appropriate for an officer to \npepper spray or mace a nine-year-old?โโspecifically citing concerns that putting those answers \nin writing โwould cause major risk for the city.โ  \n269.  Two months agoโ54 years after the NAACP first sought a court order in 1967 to \nban the RPD from using pepper spray because the organization feared officers would utilize it \nโdisproportionately in the Black community of Rochesterโโthe NAACP condemned RPD \n83 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 84 of 96\n \nofficersโ use of pepper spray on the young Black girl and recognized that meaningful change has \nyet to occur: โAfter all the incidents, investigations and reforms in years past, the result is a nine-\nyear-old child being pepper sprayed. We need serious police reform now or these types of police \nincidents will continue to occur.โ  \n270.  Notably, one year prior in May 2020, VANBREDERODE handcuffed a 10-year-\nold Black girl by the side of a highway while conducting a routine traffic stop with PASZKO. \nAfter the incident, the New York Civil Liberties Union issued a statement on the RPDโs pattern \nof using force on Black youth, again calling out โsystemic bias in the behavior of officers on the \nforceโฆ. [A] child was placed in handcuffs.โ And the need for reform: โWe need answers, \naccountability, and change now.โ But neither officer was disciplined.  \n \n \n \n271.  Sadly, but predictably, less than a month after RPD officers sprayed the 9-year-\nold girl, Defendants VANBREDERODE and PASZKO were involved in another horrifying \nencounter during which they illegally pepper sprayed a Black mother with her three-year-old \nchild present. The woman was stopped by Defendants, who suspected her of shoplifting. She \nwillingly displayed the contents of her bag and was not placed under arrest. But when she left the \n84 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 85 of 96\n \nscene, Defendants pursued herโ PASZKO wrestled her to the ground, while \nVANBREDERODE dragged away her sobbing toddler. When the woman got up to reach for her \ndaughter, who was crying inconsolably, PASZKO pepper sprayed the mother and took her to the \nground a second time. Her three-year-old daughter was only feet away when PASZKO sprayed. \n272.  At a news conference the following day, Chief HERRIOTT-SULLIVAN stated: \nโWe do have policies on the use of things such as pepper sprayโฆif a person is physically \nresisting then youโre safe on pepper spray usage.โ PASZKO was placed on administrative \nleaveโbut was not suspendedโdespite his involvement in both incidents. \n273.  Less than a month before this lawsuit was filed, RPD also answered the \nheartbreaking but inescapable question posed by Joe Prude after his brother Danielโs death: \nโHow many more brothers gotta die for society to understand that this needs to stop?โ As an all-\ntoo foreseeable result of the RPDโs entirely feckless system of supervision and discipline, the \nanswer is: at least one more.  \n274.  On March 10, 2021, Defendant MATTHEW DRAKE responded to the Open \nDoor Mission where he found Tyshon Jones, a 29-year-old Black man who was clearly in the \nmidst of a mental health crisis. DRAKE shot Mr. Jones five times. If the RPD had a functioning \nsystem of supervision and discipline, DRAKE would not have been employed that night, let \nalone on the streets interacting with civiliansโand Tyshon Jones may still be alive.  \n275.  In addition to his excessive use of force on protesters like Plaintiff MCINTYRE \nlast fall, DRAKE has a history of serious abuses: In 2013, he drove his police vehicle into a \ncrowd of 75 people and received a letter of reprimand. In 2015, he was involved in the brutal \nbeating of David Vann which was captured on film; he was neither investigated nor disciplined \nfor his involvement in the assault. Most recently, in 2019, he drove a 27-year-old woman home \n85 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 86 of 96\n \nin his personal vehicle at 2:30 a.m., against her will and without notifying his supervisor or \nrecording the trip mileage. The PSS investigation concluded Drake โcreated unneeded stress and \nfear to the complainant.โ She testified in the investigation that she felt he intended on harming \nher.  Yet Drake received only a โslap on the wristโ for this: a 7-day suspension with 3 days taken \nfrom forfeited vacationโsending a clear message that these illegal actions were acceptable. \n276.  In short, even with new leadership and increased scrutiny over the past year, the \nRPD is already back to โbusiness as usual.โ RPD officers continue to engage in flagrant, \nexcessive force against Black and brown citizens of Rochester because they know they can.  \n277.  Indeed, the 2017 report on the CRBโs impact since its inception in 1992 observed \nthe Board is nothing more than artifice designed to give the false impression that civilians have \nan avenue through which they can obtain justice when they have been mistreated by the RPD. \nThe report concludes: โThis system works for the bureaucratic institutions but not for the civilian \ncomplainants they purport to protect. Regardless of which chief or mayor was in power, the \nsystemโand the resultsโremained essentially unchanged.โ  \n278.  RPDโs Body Worn Camera Policy and training instructs that officers must \nactivate their camerasโno exceptionsโto record all mandatory events including arrests, mental \nhygiene arrests, detentions and stops of persons, and field interviews. Footage of such incidents \nmust be retained for 10 years. In other words, the City and RPD have access to video evidence of \nevery arrest and use-of-force incident by RPD officers since they were outfitted with body worn \ncameras. Last fall, in light of the serious questions raised by Daniel Prudeโs murder and the \nmisleading account of events given by RPD officers and then-Chief SINGLETARY, Deputy \nMayor Smith called for a review of all past body worn camera and other video footage related to \nuse-of-force incidents by RPD officers. Although the City has had the means, both before and \n86 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 87 of 96\n \nsince Mr. Prudeโs murder, to audit this footage, they have not taken even this obvious and \navailable step toward identifying officers who are using unconstitutional force.  \n279.  Absent external enforcement, the system will not change itself: to date, the \nDepartment has not fired or disciplined any of the officers known to have engaged in the use of \nexcessive force against Daniel Prude or any of the officers who engaged in blatant displays of \nforce during the September 2020 protests, including those captured on video. After the protests, \nin line with the Departmentโs institutionalized code of silence, then-Chief SINGLETARY told \nCity Council that no RPD officer had reported a colleague for misconduct in connection with the \nprotests. And when asked about the Departmentโs plan for addressing officers who directly \ntargeted demonstrators with pepper balls, Chief HERRIOTT-SULLIVAN punted that \nresponsibility to the citizens, responding that they may request body camera footage through \nFOIL and, if anyone believes that PLS was used in a manner that โdid not adhere to policies and \nprocedures,โ he or she may file a PSS complaint.  \n280.  Notably, the statements made to date by the Mayor and the Department about \nโchanging the cultureโ of the RPD do not include any discussion about implementing an internal \ndisciplinary mechanism that imposes meaningful disciplinary and remedial actions on officers \nwho engage in excessive force. The Cityโs proposed response to Governor Cuomoโs Executive \nOrder 203 on Police Reform also omits any commitment to such a mechanism. The Cityโs \nproposals instead include aspirational or already-required goals like โexploring a pilot program \nfor providing mindfulness-based de-escalation, anti-racism training,โ โadvocating for NYS to \ninstitute a statewide police officer licensing or decertification program,โ or โreleasing \ncomprehensive statistics on the RPDโs internal investigations, as required by law.โ  \n87 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 88 of 96\n \n281.  In December 2020, the PAB submitted a comprehensive plan to Mayor \nWARREN and the City in response to Executive Order 203โs mandate that the City โreimagineโ \npolicing. That proposal included a requirement that officers known to support white supremacist \norganizations be terminatedโa central demand by community members. Months later, in \nFebruary 2021, the City conducted two closed-door sessionsโin contravention of Governor \nCuomoโs instruction that meetings be accessible to the publicโ to formulate an official plan. \nWARRENโs proposed plan did not include any termination provision for officers known to \nsupport white supremacist organizations. The Democrat & Chronicle requested minutes from \nthese meetings, which were not livestreamed. The City denied that request. In March 2021, the \nCity Council edited the Mayorโs proposed plan to include the termination provision, but the \nMayor remains the top City officials in charge of the police department.  \n282.  As part of its purported โreformโ efforts, the RPD recently promulgated two new \npolicies. One bans its officers from using chokeholds except in โextreme circumstances where \ndeadly physical force is authorized.โ But as an RPD spokesperson explained, officers have never \nbeen trained to do chokeholds and the policy is โreally semantics.โ New York State also \ncriminalized the use of a chokehold resulting in serious injury or death in June 2020. \n283.  The RPDโs second policy instructs that officers have an obligation to intervene to \nprevent the โunreasonable use of force or other misconductโ by fellow officers. But RPD officers \nhave long been trained that โ[a]n officer that does nothing to intervene in an excessive use of \nforce event may be found just as culpable as the officer who loses control.โ Yet RPD officers \nhave and continue to stand by while other officers beat citizens of color and then, in keeping with \nthe Departmentโs institutionalized code of silence, failed to report their fellow officersโoften \naffirmatively covering for them instead.  \n88 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 89 of 96\n \n284.  As recent events in Rochester have made clear, in keeping with the Cityโs \ndecades-long practice of paying lip service to change while continuing to abuse Black and brown \ncitizens, token policies without disciplinary consequences will not change RPDโs racist, violent \npattern of policing. RPD officers have repeatedly and flagrantly flouted their constitutional \nobligations without consequence and continue to do so today.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n285.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Rule 23(a), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a class, consisting of all persons who have been subjected \nto excessive force by law enforcement officials in the City of Rochester between April 5, 2018 \nand April 5, 2021 (the โClass Periodโ) as a result of the same policies, practices, customs, and \ndeliberate indifference of the Defendants described above (the โPlaintiff Classโ).  \n286.  The Plaintiff Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \nWhile the exact number of Plaintiff Class members is unknown to Plaintiffs at this time and can \nbe ascertained only through appropriate discovery, Plaintiffs believe hundreds, if not thousands, \nof people are in the proposed Class.  \n287.  Class members may be identified by video from body-worn camera (โBWCโ) \ndata maintained by Defendants and may be notified of the pendency of this action by mail using \ncontact information maintained by the Defendants or through reasonable and appropriate \npublication.   \n288.  Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Plaintiff Class as \nall members of the Class are similarly affected by Defendantsโ unlawful conduct and resulted \nfrom the same policies, practices, customs, and deliberate indifference complained of herein.  \n289.  As a direct and proximate cause of the conduct described herein, the named \nindividual Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class have been denied their constitutional, statutory, and \n89 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 90 of 96\n \nlegal rights as stated herein, and have suffered general and special damages including but not \nlimited to physical injuries and bodily harm, pain, fear, humiliation, embarrassment, discomfort, \nanxiety, mental and emotional distress, and other damages in an amount according to proof.  \n290.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the members of the \nClass and has retained counsel competent and experienced in civil rights and class action \nlitigation, including Baker & Hostetler LLP, Neufeld Scheck & Brustin, LLP, Easton Thompson \nKasperek Shiffrin LLP, Roth & Roth, LLP, and the Law Office of Joshua Moskovitz, P.C.  \nTogether, the undersigned have more than 100 years of combined litigation experience and have \nthe resources to prosecute this action to its conclusion. \n291.  Plaintiffs have no interests antagonistic to or in conflict with those of the Class. \n292.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class and \npredominate over any questions solely affecting individual members of the Class.  Among the \nquestions of law and fact common to the Class are: \na.  Whether the CITY has maintained policies, practices, and/or customs of using \nexcessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment; \nb.  Whether the CITY has been deliberately indifferent to the violations of \nFourteenth Amendment by its officers; \nc.  Whether the CITY has maintained policies, practices, and/or customs of \nviolating the First Amendment rights of protesters;  \nd.  Whether the CITY has been deliberately indifferent to the violations of First \nAmendment rights of protesters by its officers. \ne.  Whether the Defendants violated the Fourth Amendment rights of Plaintiffs \nand other individuals as described above; \nf.  Whether the Defendants violated the Fourteenth Amendment rights of \nPlaintiffs and other individuals as described above; \ng.  Whether the Defendants violated the First Amendment rights of Plaintiffs and \nother individuals as described above; \n90 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06296-FPG   Document 1   Filed 04/05/21   Page 91 of 96\n \n293.  These common issues of law and fact predominate any individual issues that any \nindividual class member might raise.  \n294.  A class action is superior to all other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy since joinder of all members is impracticable.  Furthermore, the \nexpense and burden of prosecuting a claim for vindication of civil rights make it impossible for \nmembers of the Class to individually redress the wrongs done to them.  \n295.  The entire Plaintiff Class will benefit from the injunctive relief sought herein. \n296.  A damages class should be certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure because questions of law or fact common to class members \npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is \nsuperior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.  \n297.  An injunctive class should be certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure because the Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to \nthe class, in engaging in the aforementioned practices and failing to correct the aforementioned \nunconstitutional policies thereby making class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief appropriate. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 (Fourth Amendment) Against All Defendants \n \n298.
