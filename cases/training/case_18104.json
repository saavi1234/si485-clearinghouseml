    "summary": "<p>This is a case about the constitutionality of Indiana&rsquo;s Noon Election Day receipt deadline for mail-in ballots during the November 2020 election. On July 30, 2020, Common Cause Indiana and Indiana State Conference of the NAACP filed this lawsuit in the Southern District of Indiana. They sued the Indiana Secretary of State and members of the Indiana Election Commission for injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, requesting an injunction to require defendants to accept mail-in ballots that were postmarked on or before Election Day but arrived at the clerk&rsquo;s office before November 13, 2020. The plaintiffs alleged the Noon Election Day receipt deadline could disenfranchise thousands of voters during the COVID-19 pandemic because many voters would not receive mail-in ballots in time, and due to delays in postal service, the ballots may not be received in time, and therefore the law unduly burdened the right to vote under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The case was assigned to Judge Sarah Evans Barker.</p>\r\n<p>On August 17, 2020 plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. On September 29, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Noon Election Day receipt deadline. 490 F. Supp. 3d 1311. The Court applied the <em>Anderson-Burdick</em> balancing framework and found the deadline imposed a substantial burden on the right to vote because thousands of voters would likely be disenfranchised and the alternative of appearing in person with their ballot was potentially dangerous during the pandemic and did not alleviate the burden. <em>Id.</em> at 1329, 1331. The Court then found the state&rsquo;s interests did not justify the burden: it was unnecessary to stop voter fraud or establish voter confidence. <em>Id.</em> at 1333. The Court ordered election officials to count all absentee ballots postmarked by November 3, 2020 and received by November 13, 2020.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 2, 2020, defendants appealed the decision to the Seventh Circuit and filed a motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. On October 6, 2020, the district court issued an order staying the preliminary injunction one week to allow the Seventh Circuit to consider the appeal. 2020 WL 8093320.</p>\r\n<p>On October 13, 2020, the Seventh Circuit reversed and denied the preliminary injunction. 977 F.3d 663. Judge Easterbrook authored the decision. The Court found &ldquo;as long as the state allows voting in person, there is no constitutional right to vote by mail.&rdquo; <em>Id.</em> at 664. The Court noted that rules regarding absentee ballots receive rational basis review, and it was rational for the state to require receipt of absentee ballots by election day. <em>Id.</em> In addition, the Court noted that &ldquo;federal judges [should] not change electoral rules close to an election.&rdquo; <em>Id.</em> at 665.</p>\r\n<p>On December 28, 2020, plaintiffs moved to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice because the election had passed and their claims were moot. On January 26, 2021, the Court dismissed the case. &nbsp;</p>",

Under Indiana law, a ballot cast by mail must be received by the local county \nelection board by noon on Election Day (“Noon Election Day Receipt Deadline”). Ballots \nreceived after the noon deadline are not counted. This law disenfranchises thousands of Hoosiers \nwho timely request and promptly fill out and mail back their ballots, only for them to arrive after \nthe Noon Election Day Receipt Deadline—through no fault of their own. \n2.  While even in the best of times the Noon Election Day Receipt Deadline \ndisenfranchises voters, this is not the best of times. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 1   Filed 07/30/20   Page 2 of 16 PageID #: 2\ncreated a number of new and significant challenges for voters and election officials, including \nserious health risks to in-person voting and significant delays in mail-in ballot delivery. \nThe availability of voting by mail is essential to conducting a safe and accessible election during \nthe pandemic. However, the pandemic has also created conditions that make it more difficult—or \neven impossible—for Indiana voters to successfully comply with the Noon Election Day Receipt \nDeadline for mail-in ballots.  \n3.  In Indiana alone, 64,299 people have tested positive for the disease and 2,733 \npeople have died from it.1 One of the primary methods encouraged by public officials to combat \nthe disease is “social distancing,” which requires people to avoid congregating and stay at least \nsix feet apart. The highly contagious nature of the virus makes all voters and poll workers \nvulnerable to infection while voting in person. Voters of color, who already face \ndisproportionately longer in-person voting times that would increase the risk of exposure,2 are \nalso disproportionately likely to contract and to die from the virus.3 \n4.  On March 25, 2020, the State of Indiana postponed its previously scheduled \nMay 5, 2020 statewide primary election to June 2, 2020 because of the risk of spreading \nCOVID-19 through in-person voting.4 Indiana also expanded access to voting by mail for the \nJune primary election, and an unprecedented number of voters opted to use this safer method. \n                                                 \n1 This data is current as of 11:59 PM on July 28, 2020.

The increase in mail-in voting was even higher in Marion County, which received \ntwenty times the number of requests for mail-in ballots as compared to the 2016 presidential \nprimary.7 Approximately forty-six percent of residents in Marion County are people of color, and \nMarion County is home to significant populations of Black and Latino citizens.8 In Lake County, \nalso made up of approximately forty-six percent people of color9 and with significant \npopulations of Black and Latino citizens, county officials similarly received a substantially \nhigher number of mail-in ballots than previous presidential primary elections.10  \n6.  The expected increase in the number of Indiana voters using a mail-in option for \nthe November 3, 2020 election due to the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with continuing \ndelays in mail delivery, mean that even more voters face likely disenfranchisement because of \n                                                 \n5 Indiana has four types of absentee voting: 1) absentee voting by mail; 2) absentee voting in-person (before \nelection day); 3) absentee voting by traveling board; and 4) absentee voting by military overseas citizens.

The novel coronavirus, and the disease it causes, known as COVID-19, is an acute \nrespiratory illness that, to date, has killed approximately 150,000 persons nationwide.13 There is \ncurrently no known cure, no effective treatment, and no vaccine. People who are infected but \nasymptomatic may inadvertently and unknowingly infect others. As a result of this pandemic, \nfederal, state, county, and city officials have put in place various guidelines and limitations in \nIndiana, the central feature of which is to limit human contact either through in-home isolation or \navoiding large gatherings, commonly known as “social distancing.”\t\n17.  Public health officials warn that the pandemic is likely to worsen14 and that \ninfection rates may surge in advance of the November 3, 2020 election.15 There is no guarantee \nthat an effective vaccine, once approved, will give more than short-term protection; nor is a \nvaccine expected to be proven, let alone widely available, in advance of the November 3, 2020 \nelection.16 \t\n                                                 \n13 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Cases and Deaths in the U.S., Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/us-cases-deaths.html (last updated July 29, \n2020). \n14 John Lauerman, Covid-19 Pandemic Likely to Last Two Years, Report Says, Bloomberg News (May 1, \n2020), available at https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-01/covid-19-pandemic-likely-to-last-two-\nyears-report-says  (citing report from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of \nMinnesota); Transcript: Dr. Michael Osterholm speaks with Michael Morell on “Intelligence Matters”, CBS News \n(May 13, 2020), available at https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-dr-michael-osterholm-speaks-with-michael-\nmorell-on-intelligence-matters/ (estimating COVID-19 will infect 60-70% of Americans resulting in between \n800,000 and 1.6 million deaths over 18 months without a successful vaccine). \n15 Alexa Lardieri, New Projections Suggest Coronavirus Deaths will Surge Ahead of 2020 Election, U.S. \nNews and World Report (June 16, 2020), https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2020-06-16/new-\nprojections-suggest-coronavirus-deaths-will-surge-ahead-of-2020-election (citing a new projection from the Institute \nfor Health Metrics and Evaluation that the United States could see 3,200 deaths per day from COVID-19 in \nSeptember 2020 and daily infections “as high as half a million.”). \n16 Dr. Anthony Fauci & CDC Director Senate Testimony Transcript at 32, Rev (May 12, 2020), available \nat https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/dr-anthony-fauci-cdc-director-senate-testimony-transcript-may-12; Carolyn \nY.

Despite the state’s efforts to contain the virus, public health officials have recently \nwarned that rapidly-increasing infection rates put Indiana at risk of an even more serious \noutbreak.17 \n19.  \tGiven these extraordinary circumstances, it is not surprising that Hoosiers relied \non mail voting at an unprecedented level for the June 2, 2020 election, and they will likely do so \nagain in record numbers for the November 3, 2020 election. \t\n20.  In separate orders issued March 25 and April 17, 2020, Defendant members of the \nIndiana Election Commission (“IEC”), using the emergency powers vested in them under\t\nIndiana law, postponed Indiana’s primary election from May 5 to June 2, 2020.18 These orders \nalso suspended and modified numerous statutory deadlines to accommodate this postponement—\nthough not the Noon Election Day Receipt Deadline. \t\n21.  The IEC also expanded eligibility to vote by mail, ruling that the words “voter \nwith disabilities” in Ind. Code § 3-11-10-24(a)(4) be construed for purposes of the rescheduled \nprimary election to include any “voter who is unable to complete their ballot because they are \ntemporarily unable to physically touch or be in safe proximity to another person.”19\t\n                                                 \n17 Noah Higgins-Dunn, Fauci Says There are Early Signs Coronavirus Outbreaks are Brewing in Ohio, \nIndiana, Kentucky and Tenessee, CNBC (July 28, 2020), available at https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/28/fauci-says-\nthere-are-early-signs-coronavirus-outbreaks-are-brewing-in-ohio-indiana-kentucky-and-tennessee.html. \n18 Ind.

Under Indiana law, a county election board “must receive an absentee ballot \n[including a mail-in ballot] before noon on election day” for it to be counted, irrespective of \nwhen it was actually mailed by the voter. Ind. Code § 3-11.5-4-3. Mail-in ballots received after \nnoon on Election Day “are considered as arriving too late and may not be counted.” Ind. Code \n§ 3-11.5-4-10 (together with Ind. Code § 3-11.5-4-3, the “Noon Election Day Receipt \nDeadline”). \t\n23.  Indiana voters must submit their application for a mail-in ballot twelve or more \ndays prior to Election Day. Ind. Code § 3-11-4-3(a)(4)(A).20 Even with this early application \ndeadline, many Indiana voters in the June 2, 2020 election did not receive their mail ballot until \nclose to Election Day, making it impossible for them to return it in time to comply with the \nNoon Election Day Receipt Deadline. This delay in mail delivery was entirely out of their \ncontrol.\t\n24.  The pandemic has placed significant strain on election administrators and postal \nworkers alike. The need to maintain social distancing limits the number of election officials who \ncan be assigned to process mail-in ballot applications at any one time. Thousands of postal \nworkers have contracted COVID-19, dozens have died, and tens of thousands have had to \nquarantine for two weeks after being exposed to the virus.21 These challenges combined with the \n                                                 \n20 Federal law requires that, in elections for electors for President and Vice-President, voters “who may be \nabsent from their election district or unit in such State on the day such election is held” must be able to vote by \nabsentee ballot if they “have applied therefor not later than seven days immediately prior to such election,” 52 \nU.S.C. § 10502(d). Given the evidence of delays in mail delivery, voters who apply for a mail-in ballot under this \nprovision will be even more likely to be unable to receive and return their mail ballots in time to satisfy the Noon \nElection Day Receipt Deadline in the November 3, 2020 election. \n21 Nicole Goodkind, Trump-Backed Postmaster General Plans to Slow Mail Delivery, Fortune (July 24, \n2020), https://fortune.com/2020/07/24/usps-mail-delivery-postmaster-general-louis-dejoy-us-postal-service/. \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 1   Filed 07/30/20   Page 10 of 16 PageID #: 10\nsurge in mail-in voting to create a perfect storm in the June 2, 2020 election, resulting in \nsignificant delays in the transmission of ballots to voters and then back to election officials.22 \n25.  As a result, thousands of otherwise-valid ballots were rejected and not counted in \nthe June 2, 2020 primary election solely because they were received after the Noon Election Day \nReceipt Deadline, even though voters had timely requested and promptly returned their ballots \nafter receiving them. In Marion County alone, a total of 1,514 otherwise-valid ballots were \nrejected despite having been postmarked on or before June 2. In Hamilton County, 435 such \nballots were rejected. Similar numbers in other counties are likely, pushing the total number of \naffected voters into the thousands.\t\n26.  Despite repeated warnings of the widespread disenfranchisement that would result \nfrom their failure to act,23 Defendants failed and refused to use their emergency powers to \nmodify the Noon Election Day Receipt Deadline for the June 2, 2020 primary election, and have \nthus far refused to do so for the November 3, 2020 general election. In a May 29, 2020 letter to \nMyla Eldridge, Marion County Clerk, Defendant Lawson offered only the vague assertion that \nthis and other election deadlines serve unspecified “security and accountability purposes” as \njustification for this refusal.24\t\n                                                 \n22 See, e.g., Amelia Pak-Harvey, Nearly 1,800 absentee ballots left uncounted in Marion County primary \nelection, The Indianapolis Star (June 15, 2020), https://www.indystar.com/story/news/local/marion-\ncounty/2020/06/15/indiana-primary-marion-county-absentee-ballots-left-uncounted/5334101002/.

The Noon Election Day Receipt Deadline caused the disenfranchisement of \nthousands of voters in the June 2, 2020 Indiana primary election. Unless Defendants are enjoined \nby this Court to require the counting of mail-in ballots postmarked on or before Election Day and \nreceived within a reasonable time afterwards, the Noon Election Day Receipt Deadline will \ncause an even more significant wave of disenfranchisement in the November 3, 2020 general \nelection, when voter participation is expected to be significantly greater and delays in mail \ndelivery are likely to be even longer and more widespread.25 \t\n28.  Indiana law provides no practical or realistic notice or opportunity to cure for \nvoters who do not receive their mail-in ballot, receive it too late to mail it back in time to be \nreceived by the deadline, or whose returned ballot is ultimately not delivered to the county \nelection board by the Noon Election Day Receipt Deadline. As a result, voters who otherwise \nmight be able to avoid disenfranchisement by requesting another mail-in ballot, by dropping off \ntheir mail-in ballot themselves, or by voting in person are deprived of these opportunities. \nThis lack of procedural safeguards is particularly glaring because Indiana law contemplates—but \ndoes not require—mail-in ballots to be assigned a unique tracking number that would enable \nvoters to track their ballots in real time, a service already offered and facilitated by the United \nStates Postal Service. See Ind. Code § 3-11-4-18(a).\t\n29.  Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction from this Court, enjoining enforcement of \nthe Noon Election Day Receipt Deadline in the November 3, 2020 election and ordering all \nballots to be counted which are postmarked on or before Election Day and received up to ten \n(10) days thereafter—the period already provided for under Indiana law for the counting of \n                                                 \n25 See, e.g., Nicole Goodkind, Trump-Backed Postmaster General Plans to Slow Mail Delivery, Fortune \n(July 24, 2020), https://fortune.com/2020/07/24/usps-mail-delivery-postmaster-general-louis-dejoy-us-postal-\nservice/ (noting the decision to eliminate postal worker overtime and data showing that “nearly 20% of all work by \nmail handlers, city carriers, and postal drivers is done in overtime”). \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 1   Filed 07/30/20   Page 12 of 16 PageID #: 12\nprovisional ballots, see Ind.

Plaintiffs realleges and incorporates by reference all prior paragraphs of this \nComplaint and the paragraphs in the counts below as though fully set forth herein.\t\n31.  The Noon Election Day Receipt Deadline, particularly in the context of the \nongoing COVID-19 pandemic, imposes an undue burden on voters’ fundamental right to vote in \nviolation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\t\n32.  Under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, a \ncourt considering a challenge to a state election law must carefully balance the character and \nmagnitude of injury to the plaintiff’s right to vote against “the precise interests put forward by \nthe State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule, taking into consideration the extent \nto which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff’s rights.” Burdick v. Takushi, \n504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted); Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. \n780, 789 (1983). “However slight th[e] burden may appear, . . . it must be justified by relevant \nand legitimate state interests sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation.” Crawford v. \nMarion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 191 (2008) (Stevens, J., controlling opinion) (internal \nquotation marks omitted); accord Tripp v. Scholz, 872 F.3d 857, 864 (7th Cir. 2017).\t\n33.  Unless Plaintiffs are granted the relief requested herein, the right to vote, and to \nhave that vote count, of the thousands of members of Plaintiffs CCIN and NAACP, and tens of \nthousands of Indiana voters, will be significantly burdened if not wholly extinguished by \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 1   Filed 07/30/20   Page 13 of 16 PageID #: 13\napplication of the Noon Election Day Receipt Deadline for the November 3, 2020 general \nelection.\t\n34.  Because of the high risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus during the \npandemic, casting a mail-in ballot has become the safest way to vote. However, CCIN's and \nNAACP’s members who are qualified Indiana voters are at a high risk of not receiving their \nballot in sufficient time to mail them to their respective county election board so that they are \nreceived prior to the Noon Election Day Receipt Deadline. \n35.  Even if CCIN’s and NAACP’s members who request mail-in ballots receive and \nsend back their ballots in a timely fashion, these voters are still at risk of having their ballot be \ndelivered to the county election board after the Noon Election Day Receipt Deadline, through no \nfault of the voter. \n36.  Particularly against the backdrop of this unprecedented public health crisis, \nDefendants cannot provide any sufficiently weighty justification for enforcing the Noon Election \nDay Receipt Deadline in the November 3, 2020 election, nor for why ballots postmarked on or \nbefore Election Day and received within ten days after that Deadline should not be counted.  \n37.  Any purported state interest in receiving mail-in ballots by noon on Election Day \nrelated to the time needed to transport ballots to each individual precinct for counting on Election \nDay was rendered an anachronism by the state’s recent decision to require county election \nofficials to count mail-in ballots at a central location. Before 2019, mail-in ballots in some \ncounties were transported to each polling place to be counted on election night. Beginning \nJuly 1, 2019, mail-in ballot counting procedures changed to instead require that all mail-in \nballots be counted in one or more central locations. See Ind. Code § 3-11.5-1-1.1. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 1   Filed 07/30/20   Page 14 of 16 PageID #: 14\n38.  Moreover, requiring receipt of mail-in ballots by any time on Election Day—\nlet alone the Noon Election Day Receipt Deadline—cannot be necessary to ensure that all ballots \nare counted in a reasonable time, because the Indiana Code already provides for a ten-day period \nfollowing Election Day during which provisional ballots and mail-in ballots from overseas voters \nare counted. \n39.  The state has thus far failed to articulate any relevant and legitimate state interest \nfor continuing to enforce the Noon Election Day Receipt Deadline even when presented with \nclear evidence of delays in the processing and delivery of mail-in ballots prior to the June 2, \n2020 election.  \n40.  The Noon Election Day Receipt Deadline, particularly as applied during the \npandemic, does not advance any state interest sufficiently weighty to justify the resulting burdens \non the right to vote, and it therefore violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments and must be \nenjoined.     \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter judgment:  \nA. Declaring that Indiana’s Noon Election Day Receipt Deadline, I.C. §§ 3-11.5-4-3 and -10, \nviolates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution on its face \nand as-applied to the November 3, 2020 election;  \nB.  Preliminarily enjoining Defendants and their respective agents, officers, employees, and \nsuccessors, and all persons acting in concert with each or any of them or under their direction \nor control, from rejecting mail-in ballots that are postmarked on or before November 3, 2020, \nand which arrive at the county clerk’s office on or before November 13, 2020;  \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 1   Filed 07/30/20   Page 15 of 16 PageID #: 15\nC.

Ordering Defendants to instruct all county election boards not to reject mail-in ballots \ndropped off in person at any polling location on Election Day and to ensure that such ballots \nare counted if otherwise valid; \nE.  Ordering Defendants to adopt and implement the mail-in ballot tracking capability provided \nby the United States Postal Service and instruct all county election boards to do the same; \nF.  Ordering Defendants to provide notice to voters of all forms of relief ordered by the court \nthrough public media, including through relevant internet websites maintained by Defendants \nand to instruct county election officials to do the same and to provide printed notice of the \nsame included with all mail-in voting materials; \nG. Permanently enjoining Defendants and their respective agents, officers, employees, and \nsuccessors, and all persons acting in concert with each or any of them or under their direction \nor control, from enforcing Indiana’s Noon Election Day Receipt Deadline, I.C. §§ 3-11.5-4-3 \nand -10; \nH. Awarding Plaintiffs their costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1988; and  \nI.  Granting such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \n   \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 1   Filed 07/30/20   Page 16 of 16 PageID #: 16\nDated: July 30, 2020  s/ William R.

This issue, plaintiffs argue, \ntakes on a heightened significance in the context of the ongoing devastations of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic and the risks it presents to all citizens, constituting an undue burden \non the fundamental right to vote, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe United States Constitution.   \nNow before the Court is Plaintiffs' request for preliminary injunctive relief [Dkt. \nNo. 9], filed on August 17, 2020, but not fully briefed until September 23, 2020.  \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs seek an order from the Court enjoining Defendants, and all those \nacting in concert with them or at their direction, from enforcing or giving any effect to \nIndiana Code §§ 3-11.5-4-3 and 3-11.5-4-10 in the November 3, 2020 election, thereby \nobviating the noon deadline for receipt and processing of the mail-in absentee ballots.  \nPlaintiffs also request that Defendants Okeson, Long, Wilson Overholt, and Klutz, in \ntheir official capacities as members of the Indiana Election Commission and pursuant to \nthe powers and duties of the Indiana Election Commission, as defined in Indiana Code \n§ 3-6-4.1-14, be directed to adopt rules, or emergency rules, requiring all county election \nboards and all those acting in concert with them or under their direction and control, not \nto reject mail-in ballots postmarked on or before November 3, 2020, and received on or \nbefore November 13, 2020, and to ensure that such ballots are counted, if otherwise valid.  \nFor the reasons detailed below, we GRANT Plaintiff's motion.  \nFactual Background \nI.  Indiana Mail-In Absentee Voting Procedures \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 3 of 49 PageID #: 609\n  This case involves the requirement under Indiana law that mail-in absentee ballots \nbe received by noon on Election Day to be counted.  Indiana does not generally provide \nno-excuse mail-in absentee voting; rather, under Indiana law, eligibility to vote by mail is \nextended only to those voters who qualify under a list of specific circumstances.2  \nSpecifically, a registered voter has a statutory right to vote by mail-in absentee ballot if \nthe voter meets one of thirteen statutory qualifications, including, inter alia, if the voter \nhas \"a specific, reasonable expectation of being absent from the county\" while the polls \nare open on Election Day; is confined to a residence or health care facility \"because of an \nillness or injury\" while the polls are open; is scheduled to work during the entire time the \npolls are open; is prevented from voting due to the unavailability of transportation to the \npolls; is disabled, or is an \"elderly\" voter, defined as a voter who is at least 65 years of \nage on Election Day.  IND. CODE § 3-11-10-24(a); see also id. §§ 3-11-10-25, 3-5-2-16.5.  \nIn addition to these specified circumstances, Indiana has a separate set of rules \nauthorizing mail-in absentee voting by voters who live overseas and voters who are \nabsent from their places of residence by reason of active military duty.  See id. §§ 3-5-2-\n1.5, 3-5-2-34.5, 3-11-4-5.7, 3-11-4-6. \n \n2 Defendants highlight that Indiana's election systems are principally \"equipped for in-person \nvoting.\"  Tully, 2020 WL 4926439, at *6.  All registered voters in Indiana may vote in-person at \ntheir precinct polling places on Election Day, or at various early-voting locations for the 28 days \nprior to Election Day.  See IND. CODE §§ 3-11-8-2, 3-11-4-1, 3-11-10-26.  Alternatively, \nregistered voters suffering from an illness or injury, or caring at home for someone who is ill or \ninjured, may vote via a travelling voter board, which will bring a ballot to the voter's house and \nthen return it to election officials to be counted.  See id. § 3-11-10-25. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 4 of 49 PageID #: 610\n  Due to the serious health risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, members \nof the Indiana Election Commission expanded eligibility to vote by mail in the \nrescheduled June 2, 2020 primary to include any \"voter who is unable to complete their \nballot because they are temporarily unable to physically touch or be in safe proximity to \nanother person,\"3 effectively allowing all Indiana voters to qualify to vote absentee.  As a \nresult, an unprecedented number of Indiana voters cast mail-in absentee ballots.  \nAlthough state election officials recently voted to withhold a similar privilege for the \n2020 general election,4 it is expected that a record number of Indiana voters eligible \nunder the current statutory regime will cast mail-in absentee ballots in the November 3, \n2020 general election in order to avoid the risks of contracting COVID-19 from engaging \nin in-person voting. \n  Indiana voters satisfying the eligibility requirements to vote by absentee ballot can \napply online to vote by mail, by mailing or hand delivering a physical application form to \ntheir county election board, or by emailing an image of their completed application to \ncounty officials or the state.

CODE § 3-11-4-3(a)(4); Indiana Secretary of State, \nAbsentee Voting: Absentee Voting by Mail, https://www.in.gov/sos/elections/2402.htm.  \nVoters may apply as early as the conclusion of the previous election; in fact, Indiana has \n \n3 Ind.

Hanlon, \nin which the plaintiffs allege that the State's failure to permit no-excuse mail-in absentee voting, \nparticularly given the COVID-19 pandemic, violates voters' constitutional rights.  Judge Hanlon's \nrecent decision denying the plaintiffs' request for preliminary injunctive relief in that case is \ncurrently on appeal to the Seventh Circuit. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 5 of 49 PageID #: 611\nbeen accepting applications to vote by mail in the November 3, 2020 general election \nsince the June 2, 2020 primary concluded.  Under Indiana law, an application to vote via \nmail-in absentee ballot must be received by the proper county election board or other \nappropriate official by 11:59 p.m. on the twelfth day before election day, which is \nOctober 22, 2020 for the November 3, 2020 election.  Id. § 3-11-4-3(a)(4)(A).  For \npresidential elections, federal law requires states to allow voters \"who may be absent \nfrom their election district or unit in such State on the day such election is held\" to apply \n\"not later than seven days immediately prior to such election,\" 52 U.S.C. § 10502(d), \nwhich is October 27, 2020 for the November 3, 2020 election. \n  No later than forty-five days prior to Election Day, county election officials must \nbegin mailing ballots to voters whose applications have been approved as of that date.  \nSee IND. CODE § 3-11-4-15 (requiring ballots to be delivered to each county at least fifty \ndays prior to election day); id. § 3-11-4-18(c)(2) (requiring ballots to be sent within five \ndays of delivery of the ballots to the county).5  For voters applying within forty-five days \n \n5 Following the primary election, election officials in Indiana began a detailed process to prepare \nthe general election ballots so they could be printed and distributed within the statutory deadline.  \nBy noon of the second Monday following the primary election (this year, June 15, 2020), after \ncounting the primary votes and finalizing the results, county election officials were required to \nsend the Indiana Election Division a complete list of all candidates nominated and party \nconvention delegates elected.  IND. CODE § 3-8-7-5.  The Election Division then tabulated the \nresults across Indiana's 92 counties and provided the State's political parties with a list of the \ncandidates nominated because the parties must certify nominees for President and Vice-President \n(which depends on national party nominating conventions) and attorney general (which depends \non state party nominating conventions) as well as, in some cases, nominate candidates for certain \nballot vacancies by caucus, convention, or other legal process.  See id. § 3-8-7-6.  Once the \nvacancy filling process is complete, Indiana law provides for a period of time in which observers \nmay challenge the qualifications of candidates for statewide or state legislative offices.  Any \nsuch challenge must be filed with the Indiana Election Commission by noon, 74 days before \nElection Day (this year, August 21, 2020), and the Commission must conclude any hearings on \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 6 of 49 PageID #: 612\nof election day, Indiana law requires that county officials mail the ballot \"on the day of \nthe receipt of the voter's application.\"  Id. § 3-11-4-18(c)(1).  Thus, this year, on \nSeptember 19, 2020, Indiana counties were required by law to send a mail-in ballot to \nevery eligible voter whose application they had already received, and, going forward, are \nrequired to send eligible voters their mail-in ballots on the same day each application is \nreceived.  The ballot must be mailed to the voter \"postage fully prepaid.\"  Id. § 3-11-4-\n18(a).  If a voter has not received their ballot \"after a reasonable time has elapsed for \ndelivery of the ballot by mail,\" the ballot is \"destroyed, spoiled, [or] lost,\" or the voter \nmakes an error on their ballot, they may request that a replacement ballot be sent to them \nby filing a statement with their county election board.  Id. § 3-11-4-17.7.  \nAfter a voter receives and completes their ballot, it can be returned by mail using \nthe prepaid return envelope.6  Once the United States Postal Service (\"USPS\") takes \ncustody of the completed ballot, the ballot is transported to a mail facility for processing, \nwhere it is marked with an official postmark or other marking indicating the date on \n \nsuch challenges within three business days and announce its determination the following \nbusiness day.  Id. §§ 3-8-8-3, -4, -5.  The Commission's determinations can be appealed to the \nIndiana Court of Appeals, but any such appeal that is not resolved by noon, 60 days before \nElection Day (this year, September 4, 2020) was to be terminated regardless of status.  Id. § 3-8-\n8-6, -7.  The state party chairs are required to certify to the Election Division by noon on the \nsecond Tuesday in September (this year, September 8, 2020), the names of their respective \nparty's candidates for President and Vice-President of the United States.  The Election Division \nhas until noon on the following Thursday (this year, September 10, 2020) to certify those \ncandidates' names to each county election board, which is the last step in finalizing the content of \nthe General Election ballots.  Id. § 3-10-4-5(c). \n6 Voters voting by absentee ballot also have the option to return their ballot in-person to the \nappropriate county clerk or to bring the ballot to the appropriate polling location by noon on \nElection Day.  If, for some reason, the voter is personally unable, a member of the voter's \nhousehold or the voter's attorney may return the voter's ballot using either of these two methods.  \nIND. CODE §§ 3-11-10-1(a)(6), 3-11-10-24(c)–(d). \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 7 of 49 PageID #: 613\nwhich the USPS took custody of the ballot.  In Indiana, for a mail-in absentee ballot to be \ncounted, it must be received by the county election board \"before noon on election day,\" \nregardless of the date on which it was cast and mailed by the voter.7  IND. CODE §§ 3-\n11.5-4-3; 3-11.5-4-10.  Accordingly, the postmarked date of the ballot has no bearing on \nwhether it will be deemed timely.  If a voter misses the ballot-receipt deadline, the voter \ncan vote in-person at the appropriate polling place on Election Day.  Id. §§ 3-11.5-4-18, \n3-11-10-31.  But voters typically are not informed of whether their ballots arrived on or \nbefore the deadline. \nIndiana law does provide that \"[e]ach ballot may be assigned a unique tracking \nnumber as prescribed by the election division using IMb [Intelligent Mail Barcode] \nTracing or a similar automated tracking method to provide real-time tracking information \nfor the envelope containing the ballot.  As used in this subsection, 'IMb Tracing refers to \na real-time mail tracking service offered through the United States Postal Service.\"  IND. \nCODE § 3-11-4-18(a) (emphasis added).  Counties are not required, however, to make \ntheir ballot envelopes trackable, and, so far as we have been informed, no Indiana \ncounties currently do so.  Absentee voters are able to track the date the county clerk's \noffice received their application for an absentee ballot, the date the ballot was mailed to \nthe voter, and, once it is returned, the date the clerk's office received it at \n \n7 This contrasts with some other states' laws governing mail-in voting deadlines which use the \npostmark or other USPS marking for the purpose of adjudicating the timeliness of a ballot.  See, \ne.g., Ohio, R.C. § 3509.05 (counts ballots received within ten days if postmarked at least one day \nprior to election day); Kansas, K.S.A. 25-1132 (counts ballots received within three days if \npostmarked on or before election day); Illinois, 10 ILCS 5/19-8, 10 ILCS 5/18A-15 (counts \nballots received within fourteen days if postmarked on or before election day). \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 8 of 49 PageID #: 614\nhttps://indianavoters.in.gov, but unless a county chooses to utilize IMb Tracing or similar \ntechnology, absentee voters cannot track the progress of their absentee ballot in real-time \nand consequently are in the dark about whether their ballots were received by the noon \ndeadline and thus were counted. \nIndiana applies a slightly different set of rules to voters who live overseas and to \nvoters who are absent from their places of residence by reason of active military duty.  \nIND. CODE §§ 3-5-2-1.5, 3-5-2-34.5, 3-11-4-5.7, 3-11-4-6.  Overseas voters and military \nvoters can submit an application for a mail-in absentee ballot by mail, fax, or email.  See \nid. § 3-11-4-6; Indiana Secretary of State, 2020 Military & Overseas Voters' Guide, at 4, \nhttps://www.in.gov/sos/elections/files/2020%20Military%20and%20Overseas%20Voters\n%20Guideupdate.pdf.  If such applications are submitted by mail, they are subject to the \nsame October 22, 2020 deadline that applies to other absentee-by-mail applications, but if \nthe applications are submitted by fax or email, they are valid if received by noon on the \nday before Election Day (this year, November 2, 2020).  Id.; IND. CODE § 3-11-4-\n3(a)(2)(B).   \nUnder Indiana law, overseas and military voters can submit their mail-in absentee \nballots by mail, fax, or email.8  Id. § 3-11-4-6(h).  If the voter is a domestic military \nvoter, regardless of the method by which they return their ballot, the ballot must arrive by \nnoon on Election Day to be counted, just like other mail-in absentee ballots.  This same \ndeadline applies to overseas voters, whether military or civilian, who chose to return their \n \n8 If such voter chose to submit their ballots via fax or email, they are required to sign a statement \nindicating that they voluntarily waive their right to a secret ballot.

However, the deadline is extended for overseas voters who return \ntheir ballots by mail.  Mail-in ballots from overseas voters may be received any time \nbefore noon, ten (10) days after Election Day (this year, November 13, 2020), so long as \nthe ballot is postmarked on or before Election Day.  Id. §§ 3-11.5-4-10, 3-12-1-17. \nAs county election officials receive absentee ballots, whether by mail or delivered \nin-person, they are required to store the ballots in a secure location.  King Decl. ¶ 4(b).  \nBeginning as early as 6:00 a.m. on Election Day, absentee ballot counters commence the \nprocess of opening, authenticating, and counting absentee ballots.  Id. ¶ 4(c).  This \nprocess requires ballot counters to evaluate each absentee ballot to determine whether it \nmeets all state-law requirements to be counted.  See IND. CODE §§ 3-11.5-4-13, 3-11.5-6-\n6, 3-11.5-8-1.  If ballot counters cannot agree whether a ballot should be counted, the \ncounty election board makes the final determination.  Id. § 3-11.5-6-7.  After any such \nissues are resolved, the ballot counters and county election boards tabulate the valid \nabsentee ballots and certify the results.  Id. §§ 3-11.5-6-18, 3-11.5-6-19, 3-11.5-6-20, 3-\n11.5-8-2, 3-11.5-8-3.  Indiana law requires an uninterrupted count of absentee ballots, so \nonce the process begins, it continues until all absentee ballots are opened, authenticated, \nand tabulated.  Id. §§ 3-11.5-5-5, 3-11.5-6-4. \nMeanwhile, precinct boards count in-person votes at the precinct polling place \nafter the polls close.  King Decl. ¶ 4(f).  They submit certified results of their counts to \nthe county election board, which aggregates them with the totals from the absentee ballot \ncount.  Id. ¶ 4(g).  Most counties make the unofficial results, including absentee votes, \navailable to the public on the evening of Election Day by uploading the results to the \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 10 of 49 PageID #: 616\nStatewide Voter Registration System.  Id. ¶¶ 5–6.  These unofficial results are shared \nwith the public and generally allow the \"news media and other observers to identify \nelection winners on the eve of Election Day\" for most races.  Id. ¶ 7. \nIndiana law provides for an approximately two-week period following election \nday to finalize election results, during which time county election boards confirm initial \nvote counts, resolve disputed questions, and process and count provisional ballots as well \nas mail-in ballots from overseas voters.  See IND. CODE §§ 3-11-13-40, 3-11.7-5-1, 3-12-\n3.5-8, 3-12-4-16, 3-12-4-18, 3-12-1-17.  Mail-in ballots from overseas voters are \nprocessed and counted in the same manner as other mail-in ballots, meaning they are \nopened, grouped together by precinct, checked for compliance with state law, and then \ncounted and certified.  See id. §§ 3-11.5-6-3, 3-11.5-6-5, 3-11.5-6-6, 3-11.5-6-18, 3-11.5-\n6-19. \nAfter the counties have finalized their election results, the circuit court clerk in \neach county must prepare, no later than noon on the second Monday following Election \nDay (this year, November 16, 2020), a certified, final statement of the number of votes \nreceived for each candidate and must then transmit that statement to the Indiana Election \nDivision.  IND. CODE § 3-12-5-6.  This deadline invariably falls one business day after the \nten-day post-Election Day deadline for receipt of overseas ballots, which always falls on \na Friday. \nUpon receipt of the certified statements from the counties, the Indiana Election \nDivision tabulates the number of votes for each candidate in each race, and the Secretary \nof State then certifies the candidates receiving the highest number of votes for each office \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 11 of 49 PageID #: 617\nto the Governor.

The COVID-19 Pandemic \n  As all have come to know, COVID-19 is an infectious viral disease caused by a \nnovel coronavirus that has rapidly and widely spread throughout the world.  The virus \nthat causes COVID-19 is highly contagious and spreads through a variety of means, \nincluding especially via respiratory droplets and physical contacts between individuals.9  \nIndividuals contracting the virus can experience a range of symptoms, from none at all, to \nincluding flu-like issues, suffering a severe immune system response that can cause fluid \nto build in the lungs and ultimately lead to death.10  Containing the virus is made even \nmore difficult by the fact that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, who are \nlikely unaware that they themselves are infected, can infect others with whom they come \ninto contact just as those who do show symptoms.11  While COVID-19 poses a \n \n9 Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, What You Should Know About COVID-19 to Protect \nYourselves and Others (Apr. 15, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/downloads/2019-ncov-factsheet.pdf. \n10 See, e.g., Stokes EK, Zambrano LD, Anderson KN, et al., Coronavirus Disease 2019 Case \nSurveillance – United States, January 22–May 30, 2020, Morb.

In separate orders issued on \nMarch 25 and April 17, 2020, Defendant members of the Indiana Election Commission \n(\"the Commission\") postponed the Primary Election from May 5 to June 2, 2020.16  \nThose orders also suspended and modified numerous statutory deadlines to accommodate \nthe postponement, including extending the time within which county election officials \nwere required to complete the counting of mail-in ballots from Election Day to ten days \n \n15 We note that the Secretary of State's office is \"in the process of procuring and distributing over \n1 million face masks, over 2 million disposable gloves, 15,000 half-gallon bottles of hand \nsanitizer, 2,500 gallons of surface and equipment disinfectant, tabletop sneeze guards, face \nshields and other PPE supplies for voters and poll workers,\" which the State expects will be \nsufficient to protect all poll workers and up to 2 million in-person voters.

Statewide, nearly 550,000 voters requested mail-in ballots, which was \nmore than ten times the number requested in the 2016 presidential primary, despite the \n \n17 See Ind.

This surge \nin mail-in voting led to documented delays in the transmission of ballots to voters as well \nas from voters back to election officials.  Because of these delays, thousands of otherwise \nvalid ballots were rejected in the 2020 Primary Election because they arrived at county \nelection offices after noon on Election Day.  For example, in Marion County, Indiana, a \ntotal of 1,514 otherwise valid ballots were rejected despite having been postmarked on or \nbefore June 2, 2020; in Hamilton County, 435 such ballots were rejected.  Prein Decl. ¶¶ \n4, 7.  These two counties together represent 20% of the population of Indiana.  \n  Marilyn Tawney, Crystal Hammon, and Diana Smith were all among the voters \nwho had their ballots rejected for missing the noon deadline on Primary Election Day.  \nMs. Tawney, who has used the absentee mail-in ballot process ever since turning 65 years \nold, requested a mail-in ballot for the June 2020 Primary Election in order to reduce \ncongestion at the polls and avoid potential exposure to the COVID-19 virus.

Smith Decl. ¶¶ 2, 6–10.   \nIV.  The Impact of COVID-19 and Operational Changes on the USPS \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also significantly affected the USPS.  Thousands of \npostal workers have contracted the virus, dozens have died, and tens of thousands have \nhad to quarantine for two weeks after being exposed.  The combination of this staffing \nstrain on the USPS and the surge in mail-in voting during the pandemic has led to \ndisruptions to mail delivery, including delays and lost or undelivered mail-in ballots in \nstates nationwide, including in Indiana.     \n  Since the June 2, 2020 election, the USPS has also made several significant \nchanges to its operating procedures that have further impacted delivery reliability and \nspeed, thereby increasing the time for a mail-in ballot to travel through the mail system in \nadvance of the November 3, 2020 general election.  For example, citing an effort to \nreduce costs and improve efficiency, Louis DeJoy, on June 16, 2020, less than a month \nafter taking over as Postmaster General, circulated an internal USPS memorandum \nalerting postal workers to prepare for \"difficult\" policy changes.  Changes that took effect \non July 13, 2020 included the elimination of overtime for postal workers and the \nimposition of limits on other measures local postmasters use to ameliorate staffing \nshortages, as well as limits on the number of stops individual mail trucks are permitted to \nmake along a route.  Postal employees were also instructed to leave mail behind at the \nend of a workday to be delivered the following day, instead of making multiple trips, if \nnecessary, to ensure timely delivery, as had previously been the USPS's longstanding \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 17 of 49 PageID #: 623\npolicy.21  Within weeks of the institution of these changes, postal workers nationwide \nwere reporting noticeable delays and election officials began instructing voters to return \ntheir ballots in person rather than by mail to ensure they were timely. \n  On August 4, 2020, the USPS contacted the Indiana Secretary of State by letter, \nadvising her that certain deadlines under Indiana law for requesting and casting mail-in \nballots \"may be incongruous with the Postal Service's delivery standards\" under current \nconditions.  Dkt. 9-1.  The letter goes on to state that \"to the extent that the mail is used to \ntransmit ballots to and from voters, there is a significant risk that, at least in certain \ncircumstances, ballots may be requested in a manner that is consistent with [Indiana's] \nelection rules and returned promptly, and yet not be returned in time to be counted.\"  Id. \nat 2.  In particular, the letter highlighted \"a risk that ballots requested near the deadline \nunder state law will not be returned by mail in time to be counted under [Indiana's] laws \nas we understand them.\"  Id. at 1. \n  Three days later, on August 7, 2020, Postmaster DeJoy announced a hiring freeze \nand a request for voluntary early retirements of postal workers, effectively preventing the \nalleviation of existing staffing shortages resulting from the pandemic.22  During the week \nfollowing this announcement, it was reported that the USPS had begun removing mail \nsorting machines from postal distribution centers across the country, ultimately \n \n21 Jacob Bogage, Postal Service Memos Detail ‘Difficult’ Changes, Including Slower Mail \nDelivery, Washington Post (July 14, 2020), https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/ \n14/postal-service-trump-dejoy-delay-mail/. \n22 Press Release, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy Modifies Organizational Structure to Support \nUSPS Mission, USPS Postal News (Aug. 7, 2020), https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-\nreleases/. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 18 of 49 PageID #: 624\ndecommissioning 671 high-volume sorting machines, together capable of sorting 2.4 \nmillion pieces of mail per hour, which accounted for one-eighth of USPS nationwide \ncapacity.

Id. ¶ 20.  \nAs part of CCI's core mission, it works on a nonpartisan basis to expand and \nprotect equal access to voting for all Indiana citizens in a variety of ways, including \nlobbying for nonpartisan election reforms, such as the expansion of early voting, the \nimplementation of no-excuse absentee voting, increasing the number of voting locations, \nand ensuring a fair, nonpartisan redistricting process, among other reforms; working with \nstate and local election officials in advance of the November 2020 general election to \naddress and remedy certain election administration issues experienced in the June 2020 \nprimary election; partnering with other community organizations to provide education \nand training to on-the-ground voting rights activists around the state; and working with \nother community organizations to track problems at voting sites on Election Day, fielding \ncalls from voters who experience burdens in their efforts to exercise their right to vote, \nand providing assistance to such voters by lobbying local election officials and/or \nfacilitating their access to counsel.  Id. ¶ 5.   \nOn Election Day, CCI and its volunteers work with the nonpartisan Election \nProtection Project, which manages an Election Day hotline for voters to call if they face \nbarriers at their polling locations.  CCI spends time and resources training its volunteers \nto assist such voters on Election Day, including providing written materials for volunteers \nto use as well as training its volunteers in advance of Election Day, either in person, by \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 20 of 49 PageID #: 626\nphone, or virtually.  Id. ¶ 10.  Because of the vast increase in numbers of voters choosing \nto vote by absentee ballot in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, CCI devoted additional \ntime and resources toward educating volunteers about the effects of the noon Election \nDay receipt deadline in advance of its efforts to protect eligible Indiana residents' right to \nvote in the June 2, 2020 primary election (and expects to do the same for the November \n3, 2020 general election), thereby diverting such time and resources from other activities \nCCI would have otherwise undertaken to advance its mission.  Id. ¶ 11. \n  Before the primary election, Ms. Vaughn received a number of telephone calls \nfrom voters seeking advice because they were concerned their ballots would not be \nreceived by noon on Election Day and thus would not be counted.  Beginning a week \nbefore the primary election, CCI posted on social media, including Twitter and Facebook, \nmessages intended to warn voters not to mail their ballots but instead to hand deliver \nthem to the election office or county courthouse.  Following the primary election, she \nreceived additional calls from voters wondering if their votes had been counted.  In \nresponse, Ms. Vaughn was required to revamp the Election Protection Project training, \ndevoting an inordinate amount of time to educating volunteers on how to assist voters \nfacing problems with mail-in ballots, including those ballots arriving too late to return by \nmail for fear of missing the noon Election Day deadline.  Ms. Vaughn and CCI \nvolunteers spend considerable time developing the curriculum and presentation materials \nfor these educational sessions, and the time and resources devoted to updating such \ntraining to address the effects of the noon Election Day receipt deadline has diverted from \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 21 of 49 PageID #: 627\nCCI's other advocacy efforts.  Ms. Vaughn anticipates being required to engage in similar \nefforts in advance of the November 3, 2020 general election.  Id. ¶ 12, ¶ 15. \n  CCI has also worked with others to persuade the Governor, Secretary of State, and \nIndiana Election Commission to relax the noon deadline to avoid similar levels of \ndisenfranchisement that occurred by virtue of its enforcement in the primary election.  \nThis advocacy has included attending coalition meetings, sending letters to these elected \nofficials, sharing information on social media, and sending messages to its members to \nencourage them to contact the Governor and Secretary of State.  CCI will continue its \nefforts to educate its members and the public about the noon Election Day receipt \ndeadline for mail-in absentee ballots in the runup to the general election.  Id. ¶ 13, ¶ 19. \nCCI has a limited budget to engage in its advocacy efforts and promote its \nmission; thus, it is required to make difficult choices regarding the uses of its limited \nresources.  Id. ¶ 9.  By increasing the risk that some voters will have their mailed \nabsentee ballots rejected because they arrived belatedly, the noon Election Day receipt \ndeadline harms CCI's mission of reducing barriers to voting and imposes additional \nburdens on CCI that divert time and resources from lobbying and advocacy efforts on \nother issues, including, but not limited to, no-excuse absentee voting, nonpartisan \nredistricting reform, and expanding access to early voting.  Id. ¶ 14. \nB.  Indiana State Conference of the NAACP \nThe Indiana State Conference of the NAACP is a nonpartisan, nonprofit \norganization chartered in 1940 by the NAACP Board of Directors and currently based in \nGary, Indiana.  The NAACP was founded by a racially and religiously diverse group of \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 22 of 49 PageID #: 628\npeople with the purpose of assisting African-American citizens to ensure political, \neducational, social, and economic equality of rights for all persons and to fight against \nracial discrimination.  The Indiana State Conference of the NAACP currently has \napproximately 5,000 members, the majority of whom are residents of Indiana, registered \nto vote in Indiana, and participate in many aspects of the political process.  National \nNAACP members affiliate with a local unit, and all local units in Indiana are members of \nthe Indiana State Conference.  Bolling-Williams Aff. ¶¶ 5–6. \nBarbara Bolling-Williams is the President of the Indiana State Conference of the \nNAACP, a position she has occupied since 2003, and serves on the 64-member board of \nthe NAACP National Board of Directors.  Her responsibilities as President include \ncoordinating the statewide activities of Indiana's local units, including the local branches, \ncollege chapters, and youth council; supporting the civic engagement work of local units, \nincluding their voter education and outreach, and communicating regularly with local \nunits about their voter registration and education activities.  Id. ¶¶ 2–4. \nThe Indiana State Conference of the NAACP is run entirely by volunteers.  \nMembers promote the NAACP's mission in a variety of ways, including by lobbying \nelected officials to support or oppose relevant pending legislation; staffing committees \nthat support the NAACP's work on specific issue areas, such as health, economic \nempowerment, environmental climate justice, criminal justice, political action, education, \nand youth services; providing NAACP-led trainings in these areas, including trainings \nrelated to civil empowerment; and providing financial support.

Local units of the NAACP have supported this mission through a \nmyriad of activities, including, inter alia, training and coordinating volunteers to identify \nproblems at polling places and Election Day and following up with local election boards \nor national vote watch groups to address such issues; hosting nonpartisan candidate \nforums and providing information regarding how well various candidates are responding \nto issues important to the NAACP; offering rides to the polls on Election Day; providing \nvoter education trainings to churches and community groups; assisting elderly voters with \napplying for absentee ballots; conducting voter registration drives at high schools; \nassisting voters with verifying their registration status to ensure they have not been \npurged from voter rolls; conducting door-to-door voter outreach efforts; and litigating to \nprotect voters' rights.  Id. ¶ 8.  With no paid staff and a limited budget, the NAACP \nalways faces challenging decisions regarding the manner in which to expend its limited \nfinancial resources, decisions made even more difficult in the midst of the COVID-19 \npandemic.  Id. ¶ 15. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in conditions that have made it potentially \nunsafe for many voters to vote in person, including many members of the NAACP who \nare African-American and are disproportionately impacted by the disease, resulting in a \nheavier reliance on the absentee ballot process to provide a safe, alternative means to \nexercise the right to vote.  Before the June 2020 primary election, the NAACP expended \ntime and resources beyond what it had planned and what it had expended in the past to \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 24 of 49 PageID #: 630\neducate voters about the mail-in option and encourage its use.  Id. ¶ 10.  According to \nMs. Bolling-Williams, as a result of the noon Election Day deadline and uncertainties \nrelated to USPS mail delivery speeds, the NAACP must now reeducate its members and \nother voters about the risks associated with voting by mail in advance of the November 3, \n2020 general election, diverting its resources away from its other voter education and \nprotection activities.  Id. ¶ 14. \nTraditionally, the NAACP's voter education and volunteer training programs have \nfocused on topics such as voter intimidation, stemming voter misinformation, the use of \nprovisional ballots, and resources for addressing problems or issues faced on Election \nDay.  Now, however, the NAACP must reduce time spent on these topics to instead \nexplain how best to ensure a mail-in absentee ballot gets counted.  Because of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, the NAACP has had to alter its traditional methods of conducting \noutreach and educating voters because schools and churches, where the NAACP \ngenerally engages in such activities, are not in session.  The NAACP has pivoted to other \nmethods of sharing its information that are often time-restricted, including the use of \nrobocalling and radio spots, and have had to disproportionately focus their messaging on \nthe noon Election Day deadline with the aim to decrease the disenfranchisement caused \nby the deadline in the June 2020 primary.  Id. ¶¶ 14, 16–18.   \nThe NAACP plans to conduct virtual trainings for volunteer pollwatchers before \nthe November 3, 2020 general election.  Although it has never before included such \ninformation in these trainings, this year it will be required to include information \nregarding absentee ballots and the noon Election Day deadline, which will divert time \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 25 of 49 PageID #: 631\nfrom other important training topics.  Id. ¶ 21.  In addition, the NAACP will be asking its \nmembers to contact the Governor, Secretary of State, and the Indiana Election \nCommission, asking that the noon deadline be relaxed in the general election, which will \nrequire the engagement of additional volunteers.  Id. ¶ 22. \nThe NAACP also anticipates engaging in additional work on November 3, 2020 in \nresponse to the noon Election Day deadline that will decrease its ability to engage in \nother voter protection activities.  For example, the NAACP anticipates needing to use its \nvolunteers to drive out to voters' residences to pick up absentee ballots that would \notherwise not be timely received by the county election board and deliver those ballots to \nthe county board before noon.  Volunteers may need to be diverted from watching the \npolls to provide such carrier services, incurring gas costs, along with their lost time.  Id. \n¶ 19. \nAccording to Ms. Bolling-Williams, given the pandemic conditions and the \nresulting increase in the filing of absentee ballot applications in Indiana, the Indiana \nConference of the NAACP expects that some of its 5,000 members will receive their \nmail-in ballots too late to successfully complete and return them before noon on Election \nDay, as a result of delays in processing the applications and in delivery by the USPS.  Id. \n¶ 24. \nVI.  The Instant Litigation \n  Plaintiffs filed their complaint in this action on July 30, 2020, alleging that \nIndiana's requirement that mail-in ballots be received by noon on Election Day in order to \nbe counted results in the disenfranchisement of thousands of voters, who, through no \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 26 of 49 PageID #: 632\nfault of their own, have their ballots disallowed.  As such, the \"in by noon to count\" \ndeadline constitutes an undue burden on the fundamental right to vote in violation of the \nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  On August 17, \n2020, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction enjoining Defendants from enforcing \nthe noon deadline for mail-in ballots and requiring that all mail-in ballots postmarked on \nor before November 3, 2020, and received on or before November 13, 2020, be counted, \nif otherwise valid.  That motion is now before the Court. \nLegal Analysis \nI.  Preliminary Injunction Standard \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party must demonstrate: (1) a \nreasonable likelihood of success on the merits; (2) no adequate remedy at law; and (3) \nirreparable harm absent the injunction.  Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc. v. Comm’r of \nInd. State Dep’t of Health, 699 F.3d 962, 972 (7th Cir. 2012).  If the moving party fails to \ndemonstrate any one of these three threshold requirements, the injunctive relief must be \ndenied.  Girl Scouts of Manitou Council, Inc. v. Girl Scouts of the United States, Inc., 549 \nF.3d 1079, 1086 (7th Cir. 2008) (citing Abbott Labs. v. Mead Johnson & Co., 971 F.2d 6, \n11 (7th Cir. 1992)).  At this stage of the analysis, “the court decides only whether the \nplaintiff has any likelihood of success—in other words, a greater than negligible chance \nof winning ….”  AM Gen. Corp. v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 311 F.3d 796, 804 (7th Cir. \n2002).   \nIf these threshold conditions are met, the Court must then assess the balance of the \nharm—the harm to Plaintiffs if the injunction is not issued against the harm to \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 27 of 49 PageID #: 633\nDefendants if it is issued—and determine the effect of an injunction on the public \ninterest.  Girl Scouts, 549 F.3d at 1086.  “The more likely it is that [the moving party] \nwill win [their] case on the merits, the less the balance of harms need weigh in [their] \nfavor.”  Id. at 1100.  The public interest consideration is particularly significant in this \ncase as the Supreme Court has cautioned that, \"[c]ourt orders affecting elections, \nespecially conflicting orders, can themselves result in voter confusion ….  As an election \ndraws closer, that risk will increase.\"  Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 4–5 (2006).  We \nhave moved with haste to hand down a decision in this case in an effort to reduce such a \nrisk of voter confusion. \nII.  Discussion \nA.  The Anderson-Burdick Test \n  Our assessment of Plaintiffs' claim is governed by the two-step analysis set forth \nin Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983), which the Supreme Court has stated \napplies to all First and Fourteenth Amendment challenges to state election laws.  Burdick \nv. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 432–34 (1992); see also Acevedo v. Cook Cty. Officers \nElectoral Bd., 925 F.3d 944, 948 (7th Cir. 2019) (recognizing that the Supreme Court in \nBurdick emphasized that the standard set forth in Anderson \"applies to all First and \nFourteenth Amendment challenges to state election laws\") (emphasis in original).

Likelihood of Success on the Merits   \n  Here, Plaintiffs challenge Indiana's requirement that mail-in absentee ballots, in \norder to be counted, be received by noon on Election Day.  They claim that requiring \nreceipt of mail-in ballots specifically by noon on Election Day, while rejecting those \nreceived later in the day, is an arbitrary and anachronistic practice, originally instituted \nwhen Indiana law required mail-in ballots to be validated and counted at each individual \nprecinct on Election Day, which requirement arguably supported an interest in the early \nreceipt of such ballots so as to facilitate their transport to numerous locations throughout \neach county.  However, effective July 1, 2019, Indiana now requires that each county \ncount mail-in absentee ballots at a central location, thereby eradicating the need for \ntransportation of the ballots and the noon-receipt deadline.   \nThis requirement, Plaintiffs argue, takes on a heightened significance in the \ncontext of the ongoing challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the \nwell-publicized delays in USPS mail delivery, as thousands of Indiana voters are at risk \nof being disenfranchised through no fault of their own because, even if they comply with \nIndiana's absentee ballot application deadline and diligently complete and return their \nballot upon receipt, there is still a significant likelihood that the ballot will not reach their \ncounty election board by noon on Election Day.  Thus, Plaintiffs claim that, in this \ncontext, the noon Election Day receipt deadline constitutes an undue burden on the \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 30 of 49 PageID #: 636\nfundamental right to vote, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution. \nDefendants rejoin that deadlines are necessary in the election context to ensure the \norderly and effective administrative of elections in the State, and, here, the burden \nimposed by the noon Election Day receipt deadline is mitigated by other voter-friendly \nprovisions in Indiana's election code, particularly the numerous alternatives apart from \nmailing that absentee voters may use to return their ballots so as to ensure their timely \nreceipt.  Defendants further claim that, whatever the severity of the burden, the State \ncannot be held responsible for disallowed ballots arriving after the noon deadline because \nit is the COVID-19 pandemic and the USPS that are its cause, not the absentee ballot \nreceipt deadline.  Moreover, Defendants argue, the insubstantial burden placed on voters \nis outweighed by the State's interests in promoting the public's confidence in the electoral \nsystem by ensuring prompt election results and not overburdening local election officials \nand county election boards. \nWe address the parties' respective arguments in turn below. \n    1.  Severity of the Burden \n  We turn first in our analysis to address the severity of the burden at issue.  \nPlaintiffs argue that the burden imposed by the noon Election Day deadline is substantial, \nand, on the preliminary record before us, we agree with that assessment.  There is no \ndispute that a record number of absentee ballots were requested and cast in Indiana's June \n2, 2020 primary election, and, although the State has not extended the privilege of no-\nexcuse absentee voting for the November 3, 2020 general election, the parties agree that \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 31 of 49 PageID #: 637\nan unprecedented number of those statutorily eligible to do so are expected to cast their \nballots again by mail in the general election as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nPlaintiffs have presented evidence, which Defendants have not materially challenged, that \nthis surge in mail-in absentee voting, coupled with delays and disruptions in USPS mail \ndelivery, resulted in well-documented delays in the primary election, both in the delivery \nof blank absentee mail-in ballots to voters and the return of completed ballots to election \nofficials, and it is likely to result in similar delays in the November 3, 2020 general \nelection.   \nPlaintiffs have further shown, at least on this preliminary record, that, as a result of \nthese delays, Indiana voters can be—and in fact have been—disenfranchised by the noon \nElection Day receipt deadline, despite complying with the deadline imposed by Indiana \nlaw for requesting absentee ballots and promptly completing and returning their ballots \nupon receipt.  In the 2020 primary election, in Marion County and Hamilton County \nalone (two out of Indiana's 92 counties which together represent 20% of Indiana's \npopulation), 1,949 otherwise valid mail-in absentee ballots postmarked on or before the \ndate of the election were rejected for not having arrived by noon on Election Day.  \nReasonably extrapolated, this evidence suggests that the burden on thousands of Indiana \nvoters who are at risk of being disenfranchised in the November 3, 2020 general election \nbased on factors largely outside their control is very substantial.  The USPS itself has \nwarned the State that it cannot guarantee delivery of mail within a specific time frame \nand that \"certain [of Indiana's] deadlines for requesting and casting mail-in ballots may be \nincongruous with the Postal Service's delivery standards.  This mismatch creates a risk \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 32 of 49 PageID #: 638\nthat ballots requested near the deadline under state law will not be returned by mail in \ntime to be counted under your laws as we understand them.\"  Dkt. 9-1 at 1. \nDefendants' rejoinder regarding the severity of the burden at issue is threefold.  \nSpecifically, Defendants first argue that Plaintiffs' claim fails at the outset because they \nhave not shown that Indiana's election code as a whole is overly burdensome, as required \nby the Seventh Circuit in Luft v. Evers; second, that, even if considered in isolation, the \nburden imposed by the noon Election Day receipt deadline is reasonable because it is \nmitigated by the fact that Indiana law permits alternative methods for returning absentee \nballots that allow voters to ensure their ballots are timely received, regardless of mail \ndelivery delays; and third, that it is only those burdens on the right to vote imposed by the \nState that are actionable, and here, whatever burden has been imposed is attributable to \nthe COVID-19 pandemic and/or the USPS, not the State.  We address these arguments in \nturn below. \nWith regard to Defendants' first argument, to the extent that Defendants claim that \nthe Seventh Circuit held in Luft that successfully challenging any specific provision of a \nstate's election code requires a plaintiff to show that the state's entire electoral system is \ntoo burdensome, we do not understand that to be an accurate interpretation of the court's \nholding or the relevant legal standard.24  Rather, Luft instructs that, in assessing the \n \n24 In Luft, where various provisions of Wisconsin's electoral system were at issue, the Seventh \nCircuit affirmed certain parts of the lower court's ruling invalidating specific portions of \nWisconsin's election code, despite recognizing that the electoral system as a whole \"has lots of \nrules that make voting easier,\" including several provisions more lenient than Indiana's which \nentitle employees to three hours off from work to vote, provide for longer poll hours, and permit \nvoters to register at the polling place immediately before casting a ballot.  963 F.3d at 672.   \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 33 of 49 PageID #: 639\nburden imposed by a specific election rule, the challenged provision must be considered \nin \"interaction … with the election system as a whole\" to assess whether other, more \nlenient, provisions in the code help to ameliorate that burden.  963 F.3d at 671.   \nApplying this standard to the facts before us leads us to Defendants' second \nargument in defense of the constitutionality of the noon Election Day receipt deadline, to \nwit, that the burden imposed by the deadline is mitigated by other provisions in Indiana's \nelection code, particularly those sections affording absentee voters alternative means of \nreturning their ballots apart from the mail, and is thus a reasonable requirement.  \nDefendants highlight various general provisions of Indiana law that facilitate voting, \nincluding those that permit all voters to cast an \"in-person absentee ballot\" within 28 days \nbefore Election Day and requiring county election offices to be open for such early \nvoting, Ind. Code §§ 3-11-4-1, 3-11-10-26, 3-11-10-26.3; that empower counties to create \n\"vote centers\" to provide voters additional locations to cast an in-person ballot regardless \nof precinct, id. § 3-11-18.1-13; and that offer online voter registration and assistance to \nvoters with disabilities and those unable to understand English, id. §§ 3-11-9-2, 3-7-26.7-\n5. \n  More importantly, Defendants argue, Indiana's election rules allow voters who are \neligible and choose to vote by mail-in absentee ballot to ensure that their ballots are \nreceived by the current noon Election Day deadline, even accounting for USPS delivery \ndelays, as long as such voters promptly complete and return their ballots upon receipt and \ndo not wait until the end of the statutory window provided under Indiana law for \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 34 of 49 PageID #: 640\nrequesting absentee ballots.25  If absentee voters are still concerned that their mail-in \nabsentee ballot will not reach the county election board by noon on Election Day, Indiana \nlaw permits such voters to return their absentee ballot in person to the county clerk or the \nappropriate polling location on Election Day and either cast it or surrender it and vote in \nperson.  IND. CODE §§ 3-11-10-1(a)(6), 3-11-10-31, 3-11.5-4-18.  Alternatively, a \nmember of the voter's household or the voter's attorney may return the voter's sealed \nballot, along with a supporting affidavit, on the voter's behalf.  Id. § 3-11-10-24(c)–(d).  \nFinally, Defendants point to the fact that, at noon on Election Day, absentee voters can \neither call their county election board or check https://indianavoters.in.gov to determine \nwhether their ballot has been received, and if it has not arrived, the voter may obtain a \ncertificate to that effect from the county election board and then vote in-person at the \nappropriate polling place to prevent being disenfranchised.  IND. CODE §§ 3-11.5-4-13, 3-\n11.5-4-21. \nAlthough it is true, as Defendants highlight, that Indiana's electoral system \nprovides a number of alternatives to voting by mail-in absentee ballot, the problem is that \n \n25 As discussed above, the statutory period to apply for mail-in absentee ballots has already \nbegun and Indiana law requires county election boards, beginning on September 19, 2020 and \ncontinuing through October 22, 2020, the last date on which a voter may request an absentee \nballot under Indiana law, to send out mail-in absentee ballots to eligible voters on the same day \nsuch voters' applications are received.  Accordingly, Defendant argues, even presuming a one-\nweek mailing delay, if a voter eligible to vote by mail submitted their application on September \n18, for example, it would have been received by the county election board on September 25 and \nsent back out that same day, with the ballot arriving to the voter by October 2.  Assuming the \nvoter were to take a few days to complete the ballot, sending it back to the county election board \non October 5, it would be received by the board on October 12, in plenty of time to be counted.  \nThis hypothetical of course assumes that the voter applied for their absentee ballot more than one \nmonth before the State's deadline. \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 35 of 49 PageID #: 641\nall the alternative methods of voting or returning an absentee ballot cited by Defendants \nrequire the voter (or another member of the household, assuming there is one, or the \nvoter's attorney, assuming the voter has one) to go in person to a polling place or to the \ncounty clerk's office.  Appearing in person is an option not available to many absentee \nvoters, who may be disabled, seriously ill, homebound, out of the state, or remaining \nsequestered at home to avoid COVID-19's devastation.  Indeed, as Plaintiffs point out, \nthese are often the very circumstances that render such voters eligible to and desirous of \nvoting by mail in the first place.   \nEven for those absentee voters who are physically able to travel to a county office \nor polling place, the earliest point at which such a voter could learn that their mail-in \nballot had not been received by the statutory deadline, at least without the aid of a real-\ntime ballot tracking system, would be noon on Election Day, and that assumes there is no \nlag time in updating that information on the State's website.  We find it highly unlikely \nthat a voter in that position, who was eligible to vote by absentee ballot and thus \npresumably unavailable to vote in person for one of the enumerated statutory reasons, \ncould, immediately upon learning that their mail-in ballot had not been received, travel in \nperson to their local election office to obtain the necessary certification that their ballot \nwas not received on time, and then travel to their precinct polling location to vote in \nperson by 6:00 p.m.  Even if technically possible, this clearly is not a workable solution \nfor the vast majority of the potentially thousands of voters at risk of being \ndisenfranchised by the noon on Election Day receipt deadline. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 36 of 49 PageID #: 642\nIt is obviously possible, as Defendants argue, for mail-in absentee voters to ensure \nthat their ballots are received in time, even accounting for USPS delivery delays, by \nrequesting their absentee ballots weeks in advance of the State's deadlines and then \npromptly completing and returning their ballots.  Indeed, voters nationwide are being \nencouraged to do just that26 and, hopefully Hoosier voters eligible to and desirous of \nvoting by mail-in absentee ballot will follow that advice.  However, given the \nunprecedented number of mail-in ballots expected to be cast in the November 3, 2020 \nelection, there can be little doubt that a significant number of \"seemingly prudent, if \nunwary, would-be voters will not request an absentee ballot far enough in advance to \nallow them to receive it, vote, and return it for receipt by mail before the election day \ndeadline despite acting well in advance of the deadline for requiring a ballot.\"  \nBostelmann, 2020 WL 5627186, at *21.  Defendants do not materially dispute this.   \nStill others may intentionally wait until closer to Indiana's October 22, 2020 \nstatutory deadline for requesting their absentee ballot, not as a result of dilatoriness, but \nbecause they are undecided and therefore not ready to vote well in advance of the end of \nthe presidential campaign or because Indiana's deadline \"is giving them a false sense of \nconfidence in timely receipt.\"  Id.  Defendants' attempt to minimize the burden imposed \nby the noon Election Day receipt deadline on such voters by arguing that they could have \nprevented the problem by requesting their absentee ballot weeks in advance of the \n \n26 The USPS, for example, has taken steps to address concerns regarding slow mail service, \nincluding sending postcards to voters across the country recommending they \"plan ahead\" and \nsubmit their absentee ballot application at least fifteen days before Election Day and mail their \nabsentee ballots at least seven days before Election Day.  King Decl., Exh. D. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 37 of 49 PageID #: 643\nstatutory deadline or by choosing instead to vote or return their ballot in person is \nunavailing.  As Plaintiffs argue, the State cannot offer absentee voting by mail and then \ntell voters who choose it and abide by the statutory rules that they should have chosen \ndifferently because of delays over which they have no control.  For these reasons, we are \nnot persuaded that the burden on voters imposed by the noon Election Day receipt \ndeadline is mitigated by other provisions in Indiana's election code. \nNor are we persuaded by Defendants' third and final argument, to wit, that \nPlaintiffs' claim fails because, regardless of the severity of the burden imposed by the \nnoon Election Day receipt deadline, it is the COVID-19 pandemic and the vagaries of the \nUSPS mail delivery schedule, not the State, that have caused the burden.  As discussed \nabove, the undisputed record demonstrates in this case that voters eligible to vote by \nmail-in absentee ballot who wait even up to several days before Indiana's October 22, \n2020 deadline to request an absentee ballot, whether because they are unaware of the \npotential risk of doing so, were undecided earlier in the presidential campaign, or for \nsome other reason, face a significant likelihood that their ballots, even if timely returned \nupon receipt, will not be received by election officials on or before the current deadline.  \nThus, Indiana's \"election system sets [such voters] up for failure in light of the near \ncertain impacts of this ongoing pandemic.\"  Id.  Under these circumstances, we cannot \nsay that the State bears no responsibility for the burden caused by the current absentee \nballot receipt deadline or the voter's disenfranchisement.  \nIn sum, the undisputed evidence, at least at this preliminary stage of these \nproceedings, establishes that the burden imposed by Indiana's noon Election Day receipt \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 38 of 49 PageID #: 644\ndeadline, which threatens to disenfranchise thousands of eligible absentee voters for \nreasons that, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, are outside their control, is very \nsubstantial.  That burden is not sufficiently mitigated even when considered against \nIndiana's election code as a whole because voters who either must or choose to use a \nmail-in ballot in the November 3, 2020 general election have no practical alternative to \nvote if their ballot has not been received by noon on Election Day. \n    2.  State Interests \nAgainst this burden, we must balance the interests of the State in enforcing the \nchallenged deadline.  Regarding the State's interests, Defendants argue that some deadline \nfor receiving ballots must exist and that the noon Election Day receipt deadline Indiana \nimposes is both in line with other of its deadlines in the election context, many of which \nare set at noon on the relevant day, and one which also permits the vast majority of \nballots cast to be counted on Election Day.  Defendants maintain that the challenged \ndeadline is therefore not arbitrary and promotes public confidence in elections by \nallowing most races to be called on Election Day, rather than days or weeks later.  Given \nthe unprecedented number of absentee ballots expected to be cast in the general election \nthis year, Defendants claim that if Plaintiffs' requested relief is granted, and a significant \nportion of those ballots are not received by noon on Election Day, it could make many \nraces impossible to call by the end of the night, potentially undermining the public's faith \nin the electoral process.   \nAdditionally, Defendants cite their concern that counting all eligible mail-in \nballots if they are postmarked by Election Day and arrive by November 13 runs a \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 39 of 49 PageID #: 645\nsubstantial risk of overburdening absentee ballot counters and county election boards, \nwho are responsible for authenticating and counting the absentee ballots by noon on \nNovember 16.  The burden imposed by the noon Election Day receipt deadline is thus \nreasonable and justified under the Anderson/Burdick test, Defendants argue, because it \nbalances \"an array of competing interests in promoting participation, deterring and \ndetecting fraud, and achieving finality at the earliest reasonable opportunity in the vast \nmajority of races.\"  Defs.' Resp. at 24. \nFor the following reasons, we find these interests as identified by Defendants to be \ninsufficient in outweighing or justifying the burden the challenged deadline places on \nmail-in absentee voters' fundamental right to vote.  Initially, while the State's interests in \npromoting voter participation and detecting and deterring fraud are no doubt significant, \nit is neither self-evident nor have Defendants presented any evidence to establish how the \nnoon Election Day receipt deadline either promotes such participation or assists in \npreventing voter fraud.  Nor is there any evidence before us to support the conclusion that \nextending the current deadline as Plaintiffs request would result in decreased voter \nparticipation or an increased risk of voter fraud.  Such a claim is further belied by the fact \nthat the State has long-counted provisional ballots and overseas voters' absentee ballots \nduring the ten-day period following Election Day, apparently without incident.  \nDefendants \"may not simply invoke the phrase 'election integrity' without further \nexplanation\" and expect those incantations to carry the day.  Common Cause Ind. v. \nLawson, ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, 2020 WL 5671506, at *6 (S.D. Ind. Sept. 22, 2020); see \nalso Fish v. Schwab, 957 F.3d 1105, 1133 (10th Cir. 2020), petition for cert. filed, (U.S. \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 40 of 49 PageID #: 646\nAug. 3, 2020) (No. 20-109) (holding that, while the State clearly has an interest in \npreventing voter fraud, there must be evidence \"that such an interest made it necessary to \nburden voters' rights\"). \nWe turn next to address Defendants' stated interest in prompt election results, \nwhich Defendants contend promotes the public's confidence in the electoral system.  \nInitially, we note that Defendants' concern that granting Plaintiffs' requested relief will \nprevent races from being called on the night of the election, even considering the \nexpected increase in the number of mail-in absentee voters, will arise only in close races.  \nMore importantly, Defendants have not shown how ensuring that all otherwise valid \nabsentee ballots cast by Election Day are counted threatens to undermine public \nconfidence in the legitimacy of the final results; rather, it should in fact help assuage such \nconcerns. Granting Plaintiffs' requested relief will not require an extension of the State's \ncurrent deadlines for finalizing and certifying election results, within which time Indiana \nlaw already permits provisional ballots and overseas absentee ballots postmarked by \nElection Day and arriving within ten days following the election to be counted.  Defs.' \nResp. at 11 (\"Indiana law provides for an approximately two-week period to finalize the \nelection results.\").  Moreover, in the 2020 primary election, while the noon Election Day \nreceipt deadline was not extended, the time period for counting mail-in absentee ballots \nreceived by the deadline was extended past Election Day by the Commission, apparently \nwithout the concern that undecided races would lower the public's confidence in the \nelectoral process.   \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 41 of 49 PageID #: 647\nNor will Indiana be \"an anomaly\" if Plaintiffs' requested relief is granted as \nseveral states count absentee ballots that arrive within a specified period of time \nfollowing the election, if timely postmarked.  See Bostelmann, 2020 WL 5627186, at *21 \n(\"[S]ome fourteen states, other than Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, follow a \npostmark-by-election-day rule (or a close variant) and count ballots that arrive in the days \nfollowing the election, so long as they are timely postmarked.\").  In any event, in light of \nthe high volume of absentee ballots expected nationwide because of the COVID-19 \npandemic, it is likely that election results will not be final on Election Day in many states, \nand the fact that Indiana could be among them is not a sufficient concern to justify the \nlevel of disenfranchisement likely to be caused by the noon Election Day receipt \ndeadline. \nFinally, while we acknowledge and appreciate Defendants' concern that election \nofficials and county election boards will be overwhelmed and greatly burdened by the \nrequirement that otherwise valid mail-in absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day \nand received by November 13 be counted before the November 16 certification deadline, \nthis burden is lessened by the fact that Indiana county election boards will not need to \ncreate a process for doing so out of whole cloth; rather they need only expand procedures \nalready employed to process and count provisional ballots and mail-in ballots cast by \noverseas voters during the ten days following an election.  We acknowledge, as \nDefendants argue, that there are comparatively few overseas absentee ballots; thus, \ncounting such ballots within ten days after the election is a fairly modest undertaking.  \nHowever, even assuming that some county election boards will be required to retain \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 42 of 49 PageID #: 648\nadditional staff to assist in counting the additional mail-in absentee ballots postmarked by \nElection Day and arriving by November 13, we find that this additional administrative \nstrain is not so compelling as to outweigh the burden faced by voters who, even if they \ncomply with Indiana's statutory deadline for requesting absentee ballots and promptly \nreturn those ballots, may still be disenfranchised by the enforcement of the challenged \nlaw.   \nElection Day is set by law as November 3—all day on November 3 until the polls \nofficially close.  Any voter casting a ballot has the right to do so within that time frame.  \nThe noon Election Day receipt deadline disadvantages—indeed, disenfranchises—voters \nwho vote by mail-in ballot by cutting short the time period within which they are \npermitted to exercise this right even though, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring \nthe timely delivery of their ballots is outside their control.  To do so without a sufficiently \nweighty state interest constitutes an undue burden on the fundamental right to vote in \nviolation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The State's asserted interests here are \ninsufficient to justify such disenfranchisement, given that the system already has a built-\nin safety valve timeframe within which to receive and process all otherwise valid mail-in \nballots cast on Election Day and arriving by November 13.  Accordingly, we hold that \nPlaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success in demonstrating the risk of \ndisenfranchisement of thousands of Indiana votes due to the noon Election Day receipt \ndeadline outweighs any interest of the State during the COVID-19 pandemic and is \ntherefore unconstitutional as applied in this context.   \nB.

Barry, 328 F.3d 300, 304 (7th Cir. \n2003). \nPlaintiffs argue they will be irreparably harmed absent preliminary injunctive \nrelief on two fronts: first, through the likely disenfranchisement of Indiana voters who are \nmembers of each organization, and second, through the diversion of their limited \nresources away from their usual voter-protection activities to focus instead on voter \neducation and other efforts to mitigate the disenfranchising effect of the noon Election \nDay deadline.  Both organizations represent that they have already had to divert valuable \ntime and resources from other efforts so as to focus on educating their volunteers and \nmembers regarding the risk of mail-in absentee ballots being rejected for failure to meet \nthe absentee ballot receipt deadline.  \nIt is well-established that \"[t]he existence of a continuing constitutional violation \nconstitutes proof of an irreparable harm….\"  Preston v. Thompson, 589 F.2d 300, 303 n.3 \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 44 of 49 PageID #: 650\n(7th Cir. 1978).  Moreover, the Seventh Circuit has long held that First Amendment \nviolations presumptively cause irreparable harm, Christian Legal Soc'y v. Walker, 453 \nF.3d 853, 867 (7th Cir. 2006), and \"[c]ourts routinely deem restrictions on fundamental \nvoting rights irreparable injury.\"  League of Women Voters of N.C. v. North Carolina, \n769 F.3d 224, 247 (4th Cir. 2014) (collecting cases).  Plaintiffs also have no adequate \nremedy at law because neither the diversion of resources nor the infringement on the \nfundamental right to vote can be redressed by money damages or other traditional legal \nremedies.  Christian Legal Soc'y, 453 F.3d at 859 (\"The loss of First Amendment \nfreedoms is presumed to constitute irreparable injury for which money damages are not \nadequate….\"); League of Women Voters of N.C., 769 F.3d at 247 (\"[O]nce the election \noccurs, there can be no do-over and no redress.\").  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have satisfied \ntheir burden to show that, absent injunctive relief, they will suffer irreparable harm for \nwhich no adequate legal remedy exists. \nC.  Balancing of Harms and the Public Interest \nFinally, \"the court must compare the potential irreparable harms faced by both \nparties to the suit—the irreparable harm risked by the moving part in the absence of a \npreliminary injunction against the irreparable harm risked by the nonmoving party if the \npreliminary injunction is granted,\" Girl Scouts of Manitou Council, Inc, 549 F.3d at 1100.  \nThis balancing also requires consideration of whether an injunction would be in the \npublic interest.  Id. \nHere, the irreparable harms that Plaintiffs will suffer absent an injunction, namely, \nlikely member disenfranchisement and diversion of resources away from critical voter-\n44 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 45 of 49 PageID #: 651\nprotection activities, are, as discussed more fully above, very significant.  On the other \nhand, Defendants claim that issuance of an injunction requiring the counting of all mail-\nin absentee ballots, if they are postmarked by Election Day and received by November \n13, 2020, would both undermine the public's confidence in election results on the eve of \nElection Day and overburden absentee ballot counters and county election boards, who \nare responsible for authenticating and counting the absentee ballots by noon on \nNovember 16, 2020.   \nRegarding Defendants' first contention, as discussed above, rather than \nundermining the public's confidence in the election results, ensuring that all otherwise \nvalid absentee ballots cast by Election Day are counted should instead strengthen the \npublic's confidence in the legitimacy of the final results.  As to Defendants' second \nargument, while we appreciate that there will be an increased burden placed on election \nofficials by the requirement that otherwise valid mail-in absentee ballots postmarked by \nElection Day and received by November 13 be counted, as we previously explained, this \nburden is lessened by the fact that Indiana county election boards will need only to \nexpand procedures already used to process and count provisional ballots and mail-in \nballots cast by overseas voters during the ten days following an election.  Accordingly, \nthis additional administrative strain does not outweigh the irreparable harm faced by \nPlaintiffs.   \nFinally, we find that an injunction is in the public interest.  It is well-established \nthat, as a general matter, \"[e]nforcing a constitutional right is in the public interest,\" \nWhole Women's Health All. v. Hill, 937 F.3d 864, 875 (7th Cir. 2019), and \"[t]he public \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 46 of 49 PageID #: 652\ninterest … favors permitting as many qualified voters to vote as possible.\"  Obama v. Am. \nv. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 436 (6th Cir. 2012).  Defendants argue, however, that an \ninjunction altering Indiana's longstanding absentee ballot receipt deadline would not be in \nthe public interest here given the proximity of the November 3, 2020 general election, \nwhich, as of the date of this entry, is 35 days away.  Defendants claim that, in light of the \nlarge number of mail-in ballots that will undoubtedly be cast this year, if the Court were \nto grant Plaintiffs' requested relief, voters may not know the result of the election until \nten days later, \"a significant departure from the norm that will confuse voters and \npossibly lead to disillusionment and decreased confidence in the election system.\"  Defs.' \nResp. at 26. \nWe are mindful, as Defendants emphasize, that the Supreme Court has cautioned \nthat courts considering whether to issue injunctive relief altering election rules are \n\"required to weigh, in addition to the harms attendant upon issuance or nonissuance of an \ninjunction, considerations specific to election cases and its own institutional procedures.\"  \nPurcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 4 (2006) (per curiam).  This is because \"[c]ourt orders \naffecting elections, especially conflicting orders, can themselves result in voter confusion \nand consequent incentive to remain away from the polls.  As an election draws closer, \nthat risk will increase.\"  Id. at 4–5.  Accordingly, the Supreme Court \"has repeatedly \nemphasized that lower federal courts should ordinarily not alter the election rules on the \neve of an election.\"  Republican Nat'l Comm. v. Democratic Nat'l Comm., 140 S. Ct. \n1205, 1207 (2020) (citations omitted); accord Libertarian Party of Ill. v. Cadigan, No. \n20-1961, 2020 WL 5104251, at *4 (7th Cir. Aug. 20, 2020) (\"[F]ederal courts should \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 47 of 49 PageID #: 653\nrefrain from changing state election rules as an election approaches.\"); Veasey v. Perry, \n769 F.3d 890, 895 (5th Cir. 2014), mot. to vacate stay den'd, 135 S.Ct. 9 (2014) (holding \nthat courts \"should carefully guard against judicially altering the status quo on the eve of \nan election\"). \nHowever, the primary concern addressed in Purcell, namely, that altering election \nrules or issuing conflicting court orders, particularly close to an election, can create voter \nconfusion and lead to decreased turnout at the polls (or, in this case, a disincentive to vote \nby absentee ballot), is not implicated by the injunction requested here by Plaintiffs.  An \norder extending the noon Election Day receipt deadline for mail-in absentee ballots is \nstraightforward and does not affect the procedure a voter must follow to properly submit \nan absentee mail-in ballot.  Rather, the change in the receipt deadline affects only what \noccurs after a voter has submitted their absentee ballot by mail.  Accordingly, there is no \nimpact on the voting process itself, nor any real risk of voter confusion or dissuasion \nfrom casting a ballot.  See Self-Advocacy Sols. N.D. v. Jaeger, No. 3:20-cv-00071, 2020 \nWL 2951012, at *11 (D.N.D. June 3, 2020) (\"[T]here is no potential for voter confusion \nor dissuasion from voting because the process for submitting an absentee ballot will \nremain unchanged.\").  To the contrary, as other district courts addressing this issue have \nobserved, Purcell's concern about \"safeguarding public confidence in election integrity\" \nis in fact advanced by procedures that ensure valid mail-in ballots are not rejected for \nreasons beyond voters' control.  See, e.g., Richardson v. Tex. Sec'y of State, No. 5A-19-\ncv-00963-OLG, 2020 WL 5367216, at *29 (W.D. Tex. Sept. 8, 2020), appeal docketed, \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 48 of 49 PageID #: 654\nNo. 20-50774 (5th Cir. Sept. 10, 2020) (citing Self-Advocacy Sol., 2020 WL 2951012, at \n*10). \nAccordingly, we hold that the balance of harms weighs in Plaintiffs' favor and the \npublic interest supports the issuance of the injunction they seek. \nIII.  Conclusion \n  For the reasons detailed above, Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction [Dkt. \n9] is GRANTED and Defendants are preliminarily enjoined from enforcing the noon \nElection Day receipt deadline for mail-in absentee ballots, codified at Indiana Code §§ 3-\n11.5-4-3 and 3-11.5-4-10, in the November 3, 2020 election.  The specific language of \nthe injunction will be set forth in a separate order as required by the Seventh Circuit. \n  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n \nDate:  ________9_/2_9_/_2_0_2_0________          _______________________________ \n        SARAH EVANS BARKER, JUDGE \n          United States District Court \n        Southern District of Indiana \n     \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02007-SEB-TAB   Document 29   Filed 09/29/20   Page 49 of 49 PageID #: 655\nDistribution: \n \nCourtney Lyn Abshire \nINDIANA ATTORNEY GENERAL \ncourtney.abshire@atg.in.gov \n \nAneel L.
