She  demanded \nher  rights,  privileges  and  immunities  under  the  due  process  and \nequal  protection  clauses  of  the  Fourteenth Amendment  of  the  united \nStates  Constitution.  Alleging  the  existence of  a  compulsory bi-\nracial  school  system  in  School  District Number  3,  Clarendon  County, \nshe  asked  for  injunctive  relief against  defendants,  for  herself \nand  others  of  her  class  similarly situated.  She  specified the \nadministrative  practices  offensive  to  her  right  of  equal  educational \nopportunity  and her  rights  against  discrimination  on  account  of her \nrace.  She  asked  that  the  court  direct  the  production  of  a  desegrega-\ntion  plan  of  school  administration,  for  other  appropriate  relief, \nfor  costs  and  counsel  fees. \nThe  defendants  answered,  pleading  the  virtues  of  a \n\"freedom-of-choice\"  plan  or  process.  The  entire  effort of  the \nschool  district,  as  impotent  as  it is,  may  be  classified as  \"freedom-\nof-choice  foot-dragging.\" \n\nBy  Order  of March  28,  1967,  this  court  directed the \ndefendants  to  comply with  the provisions  of  the Order  of Chief \nJudge  J.  Robert Martin,  Jr.,  in Whittenberg  v.  Greenville  County \n.C.  S.c.  No.  4396,  March  10,  1967,  unreported). \nThe  Order  further  provided: \nThe  hearing  today  involved plans  for  1967-68. \nIt  is  the  direction  of  s  court  that  plans  for \nfuture  years  include  the minimums  here  emphasized \nplus  any  further  refinements  which  may  be \nnecessary  to  update  the  school  desegregation  plans \nand  efforts  in order  to  comply with  the  decrees  of \nthe United States  Supreme  Court,  the United States \nFourth Circuit Court  of Appeals  and this  court. \nIn  the  course  of  time,  defendants  failed  to  carry out  the mandates \nof Whittenber~ or  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  united States  or  of \nthe United States Fourth  Circuit Court  of Appeals.  Voluntarily, \nand  not  at  the  insistence of  plaintiff,  nor  upon  request  of  the \nunited States Department  of  Justice,  the United  States Department \nof Health,  Education  and Vvelfare,  or  any  of  the various  \"sob-sister\" \norganizations  that  feed  on  racial  differences,  was  the  case  pressed \nbefore  this  court.  At  the  direction  of  the  Chief  Judge  of  this \ncourt,  the  court,  sitting en  banc  held  a  combined  hearing  in  all of \nthe  pending  school  cases  and  directed,  by Order,  that all defendant \nschool  districts  should  update  their methods  of  operation  so  as  to \nconform with  the  rulings  and  direction  of  the  united States  Supreme \nCourt  in  Green  v.  Kent  County  School  Board  (1968),  391  u.S.  430.  It \nis apparent  that  the updating has  not been  accomplished.  The \nDepartment  of Health,  Education  and Welfare makes  some  explanation \nin  its  recommendations  which  will hereinafter be more  fully  discussed. \nThere has  not been  that  elimination of  a  dual  school  system,  based on \n1 \nrace,  which  appellate  court  decisions  direct.\n1  Brown  v.

Anson  Cc \nBoard  of  Education,  387  F.2d  349  (4th  Cir.  1967). \n- 2  -\n\nBy  Order  filed March  31,  1969,  the District Court  of \nSouth  Carolina,  sitting ~ banc  directed that all of  22  named \nschool  districts  submit  to  the Office of  Education,  united States \nDepartment  of Health,  Education  and Welfare  certain  proposals. \nThese  included  existing methods  of  operation,  along with  proposed \nchanges.  They were  each  and  all directed to  develop,  in  conjunction \nwith  the  experts  of  the Office of  Education,  an  acceptable  plan  of \noperation.  Provisions  were made  for  placing  the  plans  into \nimmediate  effect.  If no  plan was  agreed upon  within  30  days,  the \nDepartment  of Health,  Education  and Welfare was  to  submit  a  plan \nwhich,  absent  some  special  showing  by  the  school  district,  the \ncourt would  adopt. \nIn  this  case  there  is  no  agreement  on  a  plan.  The \nDepartment  of Health,  Education  and Welfare  offered a  plan  for \nschool  year  1969-70  which  would  accomplish  total  integration,  and \nan  alternate plan  which  would  allow an  orientation and  preparation \nperiod  for  the  year  1969-70  and  a  complete  desegregation  plan  for \n1970-71.  The  School  District disagreed,  and  private  counsel  for \nplaintiffs  disagreed,  and,  after  a  conference  at Columbia,  were \nasked  to  consult  again  with  the Department  of Health,  Education \nand Welfare  and  to  advise  the  court  as  to  the  possibility of \nagreement.  On  July  lSi  1959,  counsel  met  in  open  court  at Columbia \nand  again  the  School  District and  the  plaintiffs voiced disagreement. \nThe  District has  not,  as  yet  offered a  plan,  disagrees  with  that \noffered by  the Department  of Health,  Education  and Welfare. \nPlaintiffs made  the  following  response  to  the  proposed \nplan  of  the Department  of Health,  Education  and Welfare: \nH.E.W.'s  report  shows  that  freedom  of  choice \nis not  an  acceptable  plan  of  desegregation  in \nClarendon  County  School  District No.3.  During \n- 3  -\n\n1968-69  school  year,  875  Negro  and  769  white \nstudents  were  enrolled in  the  school  district. \nStudents  were  assigned  pursuant  to  a  freedom  of \nchoice  plan.  Only  5  Negro  students,  or  approxi-\nmately  .6  per  cent  of  all Negro  students  in \nClarendon  County  No.3  attended white  schools. \nNo  white  students  attended Negro  schools.  *  *  *  * \nThese  results were  far  worse  than  those  condemned \nin  Green  v.  County  School  Board,  391  U.S.  430 \n(1968),  where  15  per  cent  of New  Kent  County's \nNegro  students  attended white  schools. \nH.E.W.'s  report  *  *  *  *  recommends  either \nof  two  plans whereby  a  unitary  system would be \nachieved  in  the  1969-70  school  year.  But  *  *  * \nAddendum  A  proposes  an  alternate plan,  the \neffect of which  is  to  provide  an  \"interim step\" \nto  desegregation  for  1969  0  and  to  delay  im-\nplementation  of  the  effective  plans  until  the  1970-\n71  school  year. \nThe  alternate  plan  described  in Addendum A \napparently  contemplates  the  continued use  of \nfreedom  of  choice.  The  only  provisions  for \ndesegregation beyond  freedom  of  choice  are  the \nassignment  of  Negro  students  to white  schools \n\"to  fill  these  schools  to  capacity\"  and  the  \"use \nof  teachers  crossing  racial  lines  •  .  •  as  a \ncatalyst.  *  *  *  *  The  thrust  of  this  alternate \nII \nplan  appears  to be  a  human  relations  program  to \nprepare  the  Clarendon  community  to  accept  desegrega-\ntion.  The  alternate  plan  is  supposed  to  \"enhance \nsuccessful  implementation  of  the  terminal  plan.\" \n*  *  *  *  No  explanation  is  proffered  for  the  delay \nin  implementing  the  terminal  plan.  This  alternate \nplan  should be  rejected.  Green  v.  County  School \nBoard 391  U.S.  430  (1968),  requires  that  school \nl \ndesegregation  plans  \"promise  realistically to \nwork ~p\" not  a  year  from  now.  The  Clarendon \ncommunity has  had  15  years  to  learn  to  accept \ndesegregation.  If the  inevitability of  desegrega-\ntion has  not  yet been  accepted,  an  additional  year \nwill be  of  no  help.  Furthermore,  no  showing  has \nbeen  made  that  the  administrative  problems  in  re-\norganizing  the  school  system  are  so  great  as  to \nagain  defer  the  fulfillment  of  long  delayed \nconstitutional  rights.  We  grant  that  the  imple-\nmentation  of  a  full  desegregation  plan  for  the \n1969-70  school  year  may  require  a  hard  summer's \nwork  for  school  officials.  It is much  to be \npreferred,  however,  that  school  officials bear \nthis burden  than  that Negro  school  children  again \nattend  segregated  schools. \n- 4  -\n\nIn  considering  the  issue  of  desegregation  of  this  School \nDistrict the  court  had  before  it the  following  facts  (developed  by \nH.E.W.,  included  in  that  agency's  report,  and  not  disputed): \nFACILITIES \nThe  Clarendon  School  District #3  is  located  in  the  northern \npart of Clarendon  County.  This  is  one  of  three  school  dis-\ntricts within  the  County. \nThe  school  district is  administered by  the  District Superin-\ntendent.  The  students  are  served by  three  (3)  schools:  (1) \nEast  Clarendon  High  School  (grades  7-12)  located  in Turbeville, \npredominantly whitej  (2)  East  Clarendon  Elementary  (grades  1-6), \nlocated  in  Turbeville,  predominantly whitei  (3)  Walker-Gamble \n(grades  1-12),  located  in the  New  Zion  community,  Negro  school. \nThe  total  student population was  1661  at  the  date  of  this  survey. \nThe  student population was  listed as  769  white  and  892  Negro. \nAll  schools  are  state accredited.  The  present  conditions, \nhowever,  have  failed  to  provide  for  comprehensive  vocational \nand  academic  offerings.  The  course  offerings  are  typical  for \nsmall  rural  school  districts. \nThe  buildings  and  school  sites were  generally well  maintained \nand  clean.  A  general  description  of  each  attendance  center  follows: \nEast  Clarendon  High  - Located  on  a  seven  acre  site in Turbeville, \nadjoining  the  East  Clarendon  Elementary  ten  acre  site,  the  thir-\nteen  year  old brick  structure provides  space  for  grades  7-12. \nAdministrative,  library,  and  health  facilities  are provided  in \nthis building.  The  cafeteria provides  adequate  space  for \napproximately  180  students.  There  are  approximately  650  students, \ngrades  1-12,  served  daily  in  the  cafeteria.  The  gymnasium  com-\npares  favorably with  the Walker-Gamble  facility  in  size and \nseating  capacity.  Space  is provided  for  vocational-agricultural \nand  band  on  this  site. \nWalker-Gamble  - This  facility houses  grades  1-12  and  is  located \non  a  twelve  acre  site,  approximately  eight miles  southwest  of \nTurbeville.  The  one-story,  modern,  brick building provides \n45,255  square  feet  of  space.  The  sixteen year  old  structure \nwas  improved  by  the  addition  of  recent  classrooms,  shop,  and \ngymatorium.  The  elementary  students  are  served by  a  portable \nlibrary and  one  portable,  housing  a  special  education  class. \nThe  gymnatorium,  shop  area,  and  band  facilities  are  housed  in \na  separate  complex.  The  high  school  library has  office  and \nprocessing  space.  The  home  economics  department  provides  a \nsmall  'home  living'  area. \nEast  Clarendon  Elementary  - This  thirty two  year  old brick \nstructure,  two  stories high,  is  located  on  a  ten  acre  site in \nTurbeville.  Space  is provided  for  remedial  reading  and  regular \nsubjects  for  grades  1-6  in  this  plant.  A  small  area  is provided \nfor  administrative  functions. \nThe  composite  building  information  form  shows  the present \nfaculty  composition.  The  classroom  teaching  staff was  67,  with \nthe majority being white.  One  white  teacher was  fulltime  in \n- 5  -\n\nthe Walker-Gamble  School.  The  survey  did  not  show \nany  Negro  teachers  in  the  predominantly white  schools \nin Turbeville. \nCOMPOSITE  BUILDING  INFORMATION \n1968  - 69  ASSIGNMENTS \nCapacity  Students  Staff \nName  of School  Grades  Perm.

In  1960  the  population of  the  county was \n29,490.  This  represents  a  net  decrease  of  -8.5% \nfrom  the  1950  population  (32,215).  The  natural \npopulation  increase  during  this  10-year period \nwas  27.9%,  which  did  not  stabilize the  population \ndue  to  a  net migration  of  -36.4%. \nAdding  to  the  decline  in population was  a \ndecrease  in births  from  1,005  in  1954  to  702 \nin  1964,  an  increase  in deaths  from  261  in  1954 \nto  306  in  1964,  and  a  decrease  in the  proportion \nof Negroes  in  the  county  from  70.9%  in  1950  to \n68.2%  in  1960. \nCensus  statistics also  show  that while  the \npopulation  remains  predominantly  rural,  the \npercentage  is declining.  Between  1950  and \n1960  the  urban  population  increased  from \n8.6%  to  13.3% of the  total population.  Most \nof  this  non-rural  population  is clustered  in \nManning.  This  population  trend  from  rural  to \nurban  coincides with  a  decline  in  the  number \nof  farms  from  2,584  in  1959  to  1,906  in  1964, \nand  a  decline  in  the  proportion of  all  land \nin  farms  from  60.8% to  55%. \n- 6  -\n\nOf  the  8,673  employed  on  an  average monthly \nbasis  for  1960,  10.7% were  in manufacturing \nand  20% were  in white  collar positions. \nIn  1960  the  median  income  was  $1,945,  com-\npared with  $998  in  1950.  Sixty-six and \nseven  tenths  percent of  families  had \nincomes  under  $3,000  in  1960,  while  2.5% \nhad  incomes  of  $10,000  or more.  For  the \nyear  1960,  state and  nationwide  percentages \nfor  incomes  from  under  $3,000  were  32.1  and \n21.5  respectively. \nIn  1960,  28.9% of the housing  units  were \nsound  with  all plumbing  facilities.  Of \nthe  6,193  occupied  housing  units,  44.3% \nwere  owner  occupied. \nBetween  1950  and  1960  the median  school  years \ncompleted  for  persons  25  years  or  older  in-\ncreased  from  5.9  to  7.1.  The  latter  figure \ncompares  with  the  national  median  of  10.6 years \nfor  the  same  age  span  level.  At  the  state \nlevel  it compares  with  the  state median  of \n8.7  years  for  the  total population,  10.3  years \nfor  the white  population  and  5.9  years  for  the \nNegro  population.  In  1960,  33.5% of the  popu-\nlation had  completed  less  than  5  years  of  school, \ncompared  with  42.8% in  1950,  while  18% completed \nhigh  school  or more  in  1960  compared  to  9%  in \n1950.  The  total  school  enrollment  in  1960 \nfor  persons  5  to  34  years  old was  9.029. \nLocal  government  expenditures  for  1962  show \nthat  $1,337,000  was  spent  for  education, \n$99,000  for  highways,  $14,000  for  public \nwelfare,  $468,000  for  health  and  hospitals \nand  $78,000  for  police protection.

Revenue  from  local  sources  is \n- 8  -\n\n$87,697.011  from  state  sources,  $300,207.59; \nfrom  federal  sources,  $101,836.41.  The  present \ntotal  indebtedness  of  the  school  system  is \n$15,000.00. \ncapital outlay  from  local  sources  amounted  to \n$2,047.07.  The  system  received  $28,724.49  in \ncapital  outlay  funds  from  federal  sources.  No \ncapital outlay money  was  received  from  the  state. \nThe  total  property evaluation  is $1,299,580.00. \nThere  is no  bonded  indebtedness  at  this  time.  The \nrate of  assessment  on  property  is  76  mills. \nThere  are  35  Negro  and  34  white  teachers  employed \nby  the  school  system.  Thirty-nine percent hold A \ncertificates,  forty-eight  percent hold B  certificates, \nand  thirteen  percent hold C+  permits.  The  supplement \ngiven  by  the district to  teachers  varied  for  $270  to \n$450  per  year.  The  supplement  is paid according  to \nthe  following  scale: \nA  certificate  scoring over  600  on  teacher  exam  $450 \nA  certificate  scoring  under  600  on  teacher  exam  360 \nB  certifica\"te  270 \nC  certificate and  under  None \nThe  East  Clarendon  High  School  and  the Walker  Gamble \nHigh  School  are  accredited by the  South  carolina \nAccrediting Agency.  The  remaining  schools  are not \naccredited. \nPresent  School  organization: \nThe  present  school  organization  consists  of  the \nDistrict School  Superintendent,  his  office  staff, \nand  three  (3)  separate  school building organizations. \nStudent  enrollment  for  the  district  is  shown  in \nChapter  I,  Composite  Building  Information. \nThe  ProE2sed  Program: \nThere  has  been  very  little meaningful  school  desegrega-\ntion  in  the  Clarendon  School  strict #3.  With  a  54% \nmajority Negro  school  population,  the white  community \nhas  the  attitude that  complete  desegregation would \nupsurp  the  educational  and  social  standards  of  the \ndistrict.  School  leaders  are  experiencing  frustration \nin  attempting  to  develop  a  suitable  plan  of  desegregation. \nOne  of  the major  problems  faced  is  the  desegregation  of \nall black  schools. \nThere  has  been  an  absence  of  substantial  progress  toward \ndesegregation  of  the District1s  schools.  It is apparent  that  the \nwhite  community  strongly  resists,  while  the Negro  community  makes \nlittle effort.  When  this  court  reviewed  the  poor  effort and  poorer \n- 9  -\n\nresponse  to  the  directives  of  the united States  Supreme  Court \nand  the  united States  Fourth  Circuit Court  of Appeals, \nfirst  impulse  was  to order  a  zoning  to accomplish  complete \n2 \nmixing  of  grades  1-6. The  court was  persuaded to allow an \ninterim plan  for  the  school  year  1969-70  and  direct  a  terminal \nplan  for  1970-71. \nFor  the  school  year  1969-70,  the  following  interim plan \n(recommended  for  most  part by  H.E.W.)  is adopted  and  directed: \n1.  Staff  - The  assignment  of  additional  pro-\nfessional  staff members  across  racial  lines, \ne.g.,  both  races,  should be  accomplished  during \nthe  1969-70  school  term. \nThe  system1s  policies  governing  desegregation \nof  the  professional  staff  should be  formulated \nearly  during  the  1969-70  school  term. \na.  These  policies  should be  distributed  to \nall employees  immediately  after  publication. \nb.  Staff members  charged with  the  responsibility \nfor  implementation  of  these  pOlicies  should \nmake  periodic  reports  to  the  governing board \nas  to  the  effectiveness  of  personnel  policies \nand  the  achievements  toward  the  ultimate  goal \nin  staff desegregation. \nIn-serve  activities  shall be  scheduled  prior \nto  the  opening  of  the  1969-70  school  term  for \nall teachers  for  at  least 4  days.  The  in-\nservice  program  should  deal with  the  positive \neffects  of  desegregation  understanding  students \nwith  different  socio-cultural backgrounds, \nproblems  in  c~ossing racial  lines,  etc. \nThis  envisions  the  use  of  teachers  crossing \nracial  lines  in  1969-70  as  a  catalyst.  Hope-\nfully  this would  encourage  other  professional \nstaff members  to  form  bi-racial  teams  as  the \nschool  year  progresses.  Bi-racial  professional \nteams  may: \n(1)  assist  in  implementing  the  student  inter-\naction  exchange  proposed  in  this  Order. \nThe  general  conditions  would be  controlled by  drawing  a  line,  with  a \nnorthwest-southeast  axis,  midway between  East  Clarendon  Elementary  and \nWalker  Gamble.  All  children,  grades  1-6,  north  and  east would  attend \nEast  Clarendon,  all others  in  grades  1-6  would  attend Walker  Gamble. \n- 10-\n\n(2)  explore mutual  professional  interests. \n(3)  aid in  implementing  the  local  personnel \npolicies. \n(2) \nThe  formulation  and  implementation  of  equitable \npersonnel  policies  are  a  vital  part of  any  desegrega-\ntion  plan.  The  visibility of both Negro  and white \npersonnel  at  each  of  the many  levels  of  employment \nis essential to  the  full  accomplishment  of  desegrega-\ntion.  In  the  absence  of  clear  policy and  diligent \nadherence  to  the  principle of  equality  in  procurement, \nassignment,  and  promotion  of all  personnel,  the  positive \neffects  of  school  desegregation  on  both white  and  Negro \nstudents may  be  reduced. \nIt is  directed  that  the  following  policy  statements \nbe  adopted  and  implemented: \n1.  Professional  staff will be hired,  promoted, \npaid,  demoted  and  dismissed without  regard \nto  race,  color,  or  national  origin. \n2.  Full  use  will be  made  of  properly  certified \nwhite  and Negro  teachers,  assigning  members \nof both  races  to  regular  professional  positions \nin  each  school. \n3.  In  any  instance  in which  a  qualified adminis-\ntrator,  supervisor  or  teacher  is displaced as \na  result  of desegregation,  no  such  vacancy  should \nbe  filled until all qualified dismissed  personnel \nhave  been  assigned.  Professional  staff  should not \nbe  assigned  to  positions  for  which  they are  not \nproperly certified or  be  required  to  take  a  leave \nabsence  to  undergo  retraining at the±r  personal \nas  a  condition  of  employment. \n4.  The  salary of  no  employee  should be  reduced as \na  result of  the  implementation  of  any  desegrega-\ntion  plan. \n5.  In  the  event  that  it becomes  necessary  to  reduce \nthe  total number  of  staff because  of  desegregation, \nthe  qualifications  of all  professionals  should be \nevaluated  in  selecting those  to  be  released  and  the \nfinal  choice  will be made  without  regard  to  race, \ncolor,  or  national  origin. \n6.  In  the  event  that  teachers  are dismissed  after \nan  objective  evaluation because  of desegregation, \nthe  district  should be  prepared  to  demonstrate \nthrough  the  use  of  objective  criteria  that  such \ndismissals  did not  occur  because  of  race,  color, \nor  national  origin. \n- 11  -\n\n7.  All  teachers  should be  integrated  into  the \nregular  school  program  and  encouraged  to \nparticipate  in  all activities  of  the  school. \n8.  Personnel  policies  to  facilitate  staff de-\nsegregation  should be  formulated  and  dis-\ntributed to  all employees. \n9.  The  staff of  each  school  should  approximate \nthe  overall  ratio between  white  and  Negro \nteachers  in  the  district. \n(3)  TRANSPORTATION \nAll  vestiges  of  a  dual  transportation  system  should \nbe  eliminated and  a  unitary  system  effected which \nmakes  no  dual  distinction  among  transported  pupils. \nBus  routes  should,  in most  cases,  pick up  all students \nliving on  the  route  regardless  of  school  attended. \n(4 )  TRANSFER  POLICY \nWhere  a  plan  calls  for  the  establishment  of  school \nattendance  areas,  a  student  should be  permitted  to \ntransfer  from  a  school  in which  his  race  is  in  a \nmajority  to a  school  in  another  area  in which  his  race \nis  in  a  minority. \n(5)  SCHOOL  CONSTRUCTION  AND  SITE  SELECTION \nThe  location  of  school  sites  and the  construction \nof new  facilities  are  significant  factors  in  imple-\nmenting  any  approach  to  desegregation.  It is \ndirected that: \nSchool  officials,  to  the  extent  consistent with \nproper  operation  of  the  school  system as  a  whole, \nshall  locate  any  new  school  and  substantially \nexpand  any  existing  school  with  the  objective  of \neradicating the  vestiges  of  the  dual  system. \n(6) \nAny  approach  to  school  desegregation  should contain \nseveral basic  elements  as  well  as  the physical  plan  to \ndesegregate.  These  elements  include: \n1.  A  clear  statement  of board  policy--written \nand widely  disseminated--designed to  clarify \nthe board's  position  and  to  establish general \nguidelines  covering  school  desegregation. \n2.  An  active  program  of  community  information \nand  involvement  including  the  establishment \nof  a  bi-racial advisory committee  of  lay \npeople  and  educators  to help the board  evalu-\nate and,  if necessary,  redesign  the  district's \napproach  to desegregation. \n- 12  -\n\n3.  An  extended  in-service program  for  adminis-\ntrators and  staff to  continually analyze \ntheir progress  and  up-grade  teacher \ncompetencies  in  light of  desegregation  and \nconcomitant  educational  problems. \n4.  Provision  for  administrators  to visit and \ninteract with  their  peers  in  other  districts \nthrough  area  institutes  and  seminars. \n5.  Preparation  of  all the  students  within  the \ndistrict to be  well  aware  of the  situation, \nto  participate in  solving problems  peculiar \nto  students  and  provided  the  opportunity to \ninteract with members  of  the opposite  race \nthrough organizations  such  as  human  relations \ncouncils  prior  to  and  following  implementation \nof  the  plan. \n(7)  School District will  arrange,  in  all \ngrades,  for  transfer  of  teachers  of  same  subjects \nto  other  schools  of  opposite  racial balance,  so \nthat,  at the  end  of  the  school  year,  each  teacher \nwill have  an  accumulation  of  four  (4)  weeks  teaching \nin  another  school  of  opposite  racial balance. \nFor  the  school  year  1970-71,  either  Plan A  or \nPlan  BI  as  proposed by  the Department  of Health,  Education  and \nWelfare  shall be  put  into  effect: \nPLAN  A \nThe  following  proposal  is directed  for  Clarendon \nDistrict #3.  This  plan  calls  for  a  terminal  date \nof  1969-70  (originally). \nEast  Clarendon  High  School,  with  a  present \ncapacity of  390,  will house  grades  9-12. \nEast  Clarendon  Elementary,  with  a  capacity \nof  570,  will house  grades  6-8.
