Second, and related, it is not clear that Defendants need a protective order in advance of responding to Plaintiffs' discovery requests; if Defendants believe that a particular request is objectionable, they should include their objections in their discovery responses (and/or provide a privilege log). Accordingly, Defendants' letter motion is denied without prejudice to renewal. In light of that, Plaintiffs' letter motion is denied as moot. (HEREBY ORDERED by Judge Jesse M.

          "description": "OPINION of USCA (Certified) as to 57 Notice of Interlocutory Appeal, filed by Mike Poletto, John Maguire. USCA Case Number 17-2065. Plaintiffs, six individuals who participated in and observed protests in Manhattan on the night of December 4.5, 2014, sued Lieutenant John Maguire and Officer Mike Poletto (\"defendants\") of the New York Police Department under 42 U.S.C. 1983. The complaint alleges, among other things, that defendants violated plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment right against excessive force when they used a long-range acoustic device (\"LRAD\"), also known as a \"sound gun,\" to disperse non-violent protesters, resulting in significant injuries, including hearing loss. Defendants moved to dismiss, arguing, in part, that they were entitled to qualified immunity because the complaint neither stated a Fourteenth Amendment claim nor alleged a violation of clearly established law. The district court rejected both arguments, reasoning that LRADs, which can cause injuries comparable to those caused by other tools that are capable of excessive force, fit within the scope of existing precedents. For the reasons stated in this opinion, we AFFIRM the district court's order insofar as it denied defendants qualified immunity for the Fourteenth Amendment claim. This case is REMANDED for further proceedings Catherine O'Hagan Wolfe, Clerk USCA for the Second Circuit. Certified: 06/13/2018. (nd) (Entered: 06/13/2018)"

    "summary": "<p>This is a case about the use of long range acoustic devices (LRADs) by New York City Police Officers against civilians in connection with racial justice, anti-police brutality protests. The case took place against the backdrop of recent racial justice protests against the killing of people of color by police officers.</p><p>On December 4, 2014, the plaintiffs were each protesters, observers, journalists, or filmmakers who were observing, participating in, or documenting a demonstration in response to a Staten Island grand jury’s decision the previous day not to indict a New York City Police Department (NYPD) officer in the controversial death of Eric Garner. The protest, which  began in the afternoon and lasted long into the night, began peacefully; police officers on the scene escorted and facilitated the protests. Police began making arrests sometime in the early morning to some protesters' verbal opposition. After some objects were thrown at police by some of the protesters (none by the Plaintiffs), police deployed pepper spray and the crowd began dispersing. At this time, two officers stood in the street and fired the LRAD at dispersing protesters, identified themselves as officers, and ordered people to stay on the sidewalk and off the street or be placed in custody. The officers walked the length of the street and within three minutes had fired the LRAD between fifteen and twenty times. At certain times when the LRAD was fired, the officers were within ten feet from the Plaintiffs. The plaintiffs reported sustained physical injuries as a result of the acoustics from the LRAD, including migraines, sinus pain, dizziness, facial pressure, ear ringing, and noise sensitivity. </p><p>The plaintiffs filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in March 2016, against New York City, the specific officers who fired the LRAD, and the NYPD Commissioner. The plaintiffs claimed that firing the LRAD: (1) caused an unlawful seizure of Plaintiffs’ persons and was excessive force, in violation of the Fourth Amendment; (2) violated Plaintiffs’ right to assemble and express protected speech and that use of the LRAD was in retaliation to the Plaintiffs’ speech; (3) violated the Plaintiffs’ rights to Equal Protection and Due Process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment; (4) that the City of New York had failed to enact proper training, policies, and supervision for the use of LRADs prior to their usage on the night in question, resulting in the constitutional rights violations; (5) constituted either an Assault or Battery under New York state law; (6) constituted false imprisonment under New York state law; (7) was negligent under New York state law; (8) violated rights specified under the New York State Constitution; and (9) that the NYPD Police Commissioner was liable for the conduct of the officers who fired the LRAD.</p><p>The government filed a motion to dismiss all charges. On May 31, 2017, Judge Robert W. Sweet of the Southern District of New York partially granted the motion to dismiss. Counts two, three, six, seven, eight, and nine were dismissed but the remaining claims were allowed to proceed. 254 F.Supp.3d 565. The government filed an interlocutory appeal the following June seeking to dismiss the remaining claims using the defense of Qualified Immunity. In August, Judge Sweet granted the government’s motion to stay the remaining proceedings pending the outcome of officers’ qualified immunity defense.</p><p>In June 2018, Chief Judge Robert Katzmann of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled against the Defendants and affirmed the District Court denial of the qualified immunity defense for the Fourteenth Amendment claims (254 F.Supp.3d 565). The case was remanded to the District Court and discovery proceedings commenced. One of the Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed all of his claims in September of 2019. The government appealed to the Supreme Court but the court denied certiorari. </p><p>The parties to the case were referred to a Magistrate Judge in March of 2020 and a settlement conference was scheduled later that year. Following multiple settlement conferences over the remainder of 2020, the parties reached an agreement and the case was ordered dismissed by Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York in January 2021. </p><p>The settlement stipulated as follows: In exchange for no admission of guilt by the defendants and the voluntary dismissal of all of the plaintiffs’ claims, the NYPD agreed to implement new guidelines and training materials for the use of LRADs, including banning use of the LRAD deterrent tone altogether, requiring better recordkeeping of LRAD usage, and listing specific operators allowed to use LRADs. The City of New York also paid damages to specific plaintiffs in addition to paying their attorney’s fees. More on the settlement can be read here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/skh6m5ryhy1ixvd/Edrei%20LRAD%20Press%20Release.pdf?dl=0%20%20(cut%20and%20pasted%20below)</p><p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/8qxh6aqw8jefzcv/%20Edrei%20LRAD%20FAQ.pdf?dl=0</p><p>The settlement agreement provides for no ongoing court supervision; thus, the case is effectively over.</p>",

    "summary_short": "The plaintiffs were persons engaged in or documenting an anti-police brutality protest in response to the killing of Eric Garner in 2014 and a decision by a grand jury not to charge the officers responsible. New York City Police Department (NYPD) officials used Long-Range Acoustic Devices (LRADs) to disperse protestors, sometimes firing off the LRAD when within 10 feet of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed suit in the Southern District of New York and Defendants moved to dismiss. Most of the complaint was dismissed for failure to state a claim, but the claims alleging excessive force, assault and battery, and improper training were allowed to proceed. After a denial of the Qualified Immunity defense was upheld on appeal and the Supreme Court denied review, the parties to the case eventually settled. In exchange for dismissing the remaining claims, the NYPD agreed to change its policies on the use and appropriateness of LRADs; the city also covered the attorney's fees for the Plaintiffs. The case is terminated as of May, 2021.",

As  set  forth  below,  the  motion  is  granted  in \npart  and  denied  in  part. \nPrior  Proceedings \nPlaintiffs  commenced  this  action  on  March  3,  2016. \n(Dkt .  1.)  Plaintiffs  filed  their  FAC  on  August  1,  2016,  which \n1 \n\nexpanded  certain  allegations  from  the  initial  compl aint,  added \nPlainti ff  Appel,  inserted  Defendants  Maguire  and  Poletto  for \nprevious  \"John  Doe\"  defendants,  and  added  a  claim  for  municipal \nliability against  NYC.

Long  Range  Acoustic  Devices  (\"LRADs\")  And  The  XlOO \nLRAD  devices  were  first  developed  around  2000,  initially \nfor  the  military  as  a  tool  for  ships  to  ampl ify  and  project \nnoi se  to  ward  off  other  shi ps.  ( FAC  'll'll  3,  11. )  The  device  has \nalso  been  marketed  for  non-military,  loudspeaker- like  purposes: \nto  produce  \"highly  intelligible  voice  messages  .  .  and \npowerful  alarm  tones  over  large  distances .\"  (FAC  5.)  LRADs  are \n'JI \nmarketed  as  louder  than  traditional  megaphones  by  around  20-35 \ndecibels  (\"dBs\") ,  and  have  the  capacity  to  disseminate  messages \n2 \n\nto  large  crowds  over  ten  bl ocks  away.  ( FAC  <JI<JI  9,  13.)  In \naddition  to  amplifying  sound,  LRAD  devices  can  possess  a  high \npitched,  volume  adjustable  \"deterrent  tone\"  that  is  marketed  to \nlaw  enforcement  as  useful  for  crowd  control  by  creating  audible \ndiscomfort  when  used  at  close  range .  (FAC  <JI<JI  11- 12.) \nThe  lOOX  Model  LRAD  (\"lOOX\")  is  a  type  of  LRAD  device \nmanufactured  by  the  LRAD  Corporati on.  (FAC  <JI<JI  1,  80 . )  The  lOOX \ncan  project  messages  up  to  600  meters  away,  produce  a  maximum \ncontinuous  output  of  136  dB  at  one  meter  away,  and  has  the \ncapacity  to  overcome  88  dBs  of  background  noise  at  250  meters. \n(FAC  <JI  80.) \nii .

(FAC  <JI  57 . )  At  the  time  of  purchases, \nthe  NYPD  stated  it intended  to  use  the  LRAD  devices  to \ndisseminate  information  to  large  crowds,  such  as  during \ndemonstrations  or  following  terrorist  attacks .  ( FAC  <JI  5 9.) \nBetween  2004  and  2011,  the  NYPD  used  LRADs  i nfrequently, \nprincipally  as  loudspeakers .  ( FAC  <JI<JI  64-65,  67.) \n3 \n\nIn  2010,  the  NYPD  conducted  tests  using  the  Model  3300 . \n(FAC  73.)  These  tests  concluded  that  when  LRAD  device  volume \n~ \nwas  at  around  maximum,  it resulted  in  a  sound  volume  of  around \n100  to  110  dB  at  a  distance  of  320  feet  away.

(Opp.  Mem.  at  7; \nFAC  121 . )  This  claim  fails  for  several  reasons . \n~ \nAn  officer' s  request  to  leave  an  area,  even  with  use  of \nforce,  is  not  a  seizure  unless  \"accompanied  by  the  use  of \nsufficient  force  intentionally  to  restrain  a  person  and  gain \ncontrol  of  his  movements .\"  Salmon,  802  F. 3d  at  255  (reversing \ndi smissal  of  seizure  cl aim  when  officer  ejected  pl aint iff from \ncourthouse  by  grabbing  plaintiff' s  collar  and  \"vi olently\" \ntwisting  plainti ff' s  arm) .  While  exposed  to  the  XlOO,  none  of \nthe  Plaintiffs  have  plausibl y  al leged  that  their movements  were \nrestrained.  Rather,  Plaintiffs  state  that  while  the  XlOO  was \nused  by  Defendants  Magui re  and  Poletto,  each  Plaintiff moved \naround  the  Protest  area  or  left  the  vicinity of  the  XlOO  as  each \ndesi red,  generally  to  escape  the  noise .

Other  than  being \nrequested  to  leave  the  street  and  inclined  to  leave  the  Protest \nintersection  by  the  noise,  the  Plaintiffs  have  not  all eged  they \n12 \n\nwere  not  \"free  to  go  anywhere  else  that  [they]  desired.\" \nSheppard,  18  F.3d  at  153  (rejecting  Fourth  Amendment  seizure \nclaim when  plaintiff was  required  to  leave  a  courthouse  at \nofficer' s  command) .

Therefore, \nPlaintiffs'  unreasonable  seizure  claim  is  dismissed. \nWith  regard  to  their  excessive  force  claim  under  the \nFourteenth  Amendment,  however,  Plaintiffs  have  put  forward  a \ncognizable  claim.  As  a  preliminary matter,  Defendants  contest \nwhether  the  use  of  the  X100  and  amplified  sound  can  constitute \nforce.  (Supp.  Mem.  at  12  & n.7.)  The  parties  have  not  provided, \nand  the  Court  has  been  unable  to  locate,  case  law  addressing \nLRAD-type  devices  and  the  use  of  high- volume  sound  alone  by  the \npolice .  In  support  of  their  position,  however,  Defendants  point \nto  two  New  York  Supreme  Court  cases  which  stand  for  the \nproposition  that  \"sound  is  not  a  substance  but  a  physical \nphenomenon.\"  Martzloff  v.  City  of  New  York,  238  A. D. 3d  115,  117 \n(N.Y .  App.  Div.  1st  Dep' t  1997);  see  also  Casson  v .  City  of  New \nYork,  269  A.D.2d  185,  286  (N .Y.  App.  Div.  1st  Dep't 2000) \n(applying  Martzloff) .  These  cases  neither  bind  this  Court  nor \nare  persuasive.  They  discuss  sound  in  application  to  New  York \nCivil  Law  Section  214- c ,  New  York  State' s  statute  of  limitations \n13 \n\nrules  for  personal  injury  claims  arising  from  exposure  to \nharmful  substances .  See  N.Y.  C. P.L.R.  §  214- c.  In  rejecting  sound \nin  this  context,  the  Martzloff  court  reasoned  that,  \"All  cases \nwithin  the  ambit  of  CPLR  214- c  involve  the  ingestion  of  a \nsubstance, \"  and  therefore  sound  would  not  apply.  Martzloff,  238 \nA. D.3d  at  117 .  Whether  sound  can  be  ingested  i s  a  narrower, \nsubstantively  different  question  than  whether  sound  can  be  used \nas  a  force . \nThe  use  of  the  XlOO  as  a  projector  of  powerfully  amplified \nsound  is  no  different  than  other  tools  in  law  enforcement' s \narsenal  that  have  the  potential  to  be  used  either  safely  or \nharmfully,  one  exampl e  being  di straction  devices-items  like  stun \ngrenade,  flash  bang,  or  concussion  grenades-which  \"detonate  with \na  bl inding  f l ash  of  l ight  and  a  deafening  explosion\"  and  whose \npurpose  is  to  be  \"extremely  loud\"  and  distracting .

June  21, \n2001)  (plaintiff  alleged  that  police' s  use  of  a  distraction \ndevice  \"caused  him  to  suffer  a  broken  eardrum  and  emotional \ntrauma\") ,  with  (FAC  <JI  30  (noting  that  loud  sounds  \"have  the \npotential  to  cause  significant  harm  to  the  eardrums  and  delicate \norgans  of  the  ears\" )) .  This  is  force,  and  the  kind  which  could \nbe  used  excessively. \nConstrued  most  favorably  to  the  Plaintiffs,  their  alleged \ninjuries  go  beyond  the  de  minimis  threshold.  As  a  result  of \nexposure  to  the  XlOO' s  sound,  Plaintiffs  allege  acute  head  pain \nand  hearing  loss  for  differing  periods  of  time  following  the \nProtest .  (FAC  ']['][  168,  175,  194,  232,  273- 75,  313- 15,  345,  367-\n70 . )  Plaintiff Appel  states  that  doctors  found  that  the  noise \nfrom  the  XlOO  caused  bones  to  move  in  his  ear,  damaging  a  nerve. \n(FAC  <JI  372 . )  Defendants  point  to  Plaintiffs'  video  evidence  to \nshow  that  whi le  the  XlOO  was  in  use,  protestors  are  visible  not \nexhibiting  signs  of  pain  from  the  noise .  (Supp.  Mem.  at  9.) \nWhile  suggestive  evidence  to  the  contrary,  the  angles  and  nature \nof  the  video  make  details  difficult  to  discern  absol utely.  It  is \nreasonably  plausible  that  the  vi deo,  which  is  frenetic  in  style \nand  does  not  stay  on  any  one  protester  for  an  extended  period  of \ntime,  does  not  rebut  the  claim  that  Plaintiffs,  if situated \n15 \n\nwhere  and  when  they  claimed  to  have  been  in  relation  to  the \nXlOO,  sustained  their  alleged  injuries.  (See  Garman  Deel.  Ex. \nc . ) \nFurthermore,  based  on  the  written  allegations  and  video \nevidence,  it can  be  plausibly  inferred  that  the  use  of  a  high \npowered  sound  magnifier  in  \"close  proximity\" to  Plaintiffs  was \nnot  appropriate.  United  States  v .  Morris,  349  F.3d  1009,  1012 \n(7th  Cir.  2003)  (discussing  the  dangers  and  limited  reasonable \ncontexts  for  using  flash-bang  devices).  The  Protest  involved \nlarge  numbers  of  people,  and  so  it is  understandable  that  the \nofficers  would  want  t o  increase  the  volume  of  their  message  to \nreach  the  largest  number  of  people.  (See  Garman  Deel.  Ex.  C  at \n00 :14- 01: 24;  FAC  261,  300.)  However,  the  allegations  and  video \n~ \nmake  the  Protest  appear  broadly  in  control,  even  when  glass \nbottles  were  thrown  from  the  crowd  toward  the  police.  (See \nGerman  Deel .  Ex.  C  at  1:24-1:35;  FAC  115,  149,  212,  262, \n~~ \n358.)  Under  these  circumstances,  it is  reasonably  plausible  that \nthere  was  disconnect  between  Defendants  Maguire  and  Poletto's \nneed  to  use  a  powerfully  loud  device  like  the  XlOO \n\"indiscriminately,\"  (FAC  225) ,  \"almost  continuously,\"  (FAC \n~ \n338) ,  and  within  ten  feet  of  Plaintiffs,  (FAC  131),  and  the \n~  ~ \nharm  alleged  to  be  resultant  from  its  use  to  those  in  close \nproximity. \n16 \n\nDefendants  respond  that  even  if the  XlOO  was  unnecessary \nand  injurious,  Plaintiffs'  allegations  do  not  demonstrate  that \nDefendants  Maguire  and  Poletto's  actions  rose  to  the  level  of \nmalice  or  sadism  to  amount  to  excessive  force  claim because  the \nofficers  are  alleged  to  be  requesting  that  those  attending  the \nProtest  leave  the  street.  (Supp.  Mem.  at  10-11. )  Based  on  the \nallegations,  crowd  control  was  part  of  officers'  objectives . \nHowever,  Plaintiffs  have  also  alleged  that  the  XlOO  was  used  by \nDefendants  Maguire  and  Poletto  by  deliberately pointing  and \nangling  it at  Plaintiffs  and  others  during  the  protest  (FAC \n131,  229.)  Viewed  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  Plaintiffs, \n~~ \nPlaintiffs'  allegations  about  the  manner  in  which  the  XlOO  was \nused,  that  Defendants  Maguire  and  Poletto  knew,  or  should  have \nknown,  that  Plai nti ffs  would  be  harmed,  \"plausibly  suggesting  a \nclaim  for  excessive  force.\"  Coleman  v.

Mem.  at  6  n .7;  see  FAC  ~~ 139,  202,  288 . )  The  Court  need \nnot  parse  which  Plaintiffs  may  or  may  not  have  been  be  entitled \nto  speech  protection  while  at  the  Prot est  because  even  if they \nwere  all  present  to  protest,  Plaintiffs  have  still failed  to \nstate  First  Amendment  violati ons  claims . \n21 \n\nWith  regard  to  the  retaliation  claim,  Plaintiffs  have  not \nplausibly pled  that  Defendants'  actions  were  motivated  by  the \ncontent  of  Plaintiffs'  speech.  Rather,  Plaintiffs  state  that \nDefendants  used  the  XlOO  to  instruct  Plaintiffs  and  others  at \nthe  Protest  to  \"get  or  stay  on  the  sidewalk  and  out  of  the \nstreet\"  in  the  midst  of  an  increasingly  confrontational,  though \nnot  yet  uncontrollable,  period.  (FAC  '1I  122;  see  supra  at  16-17.) \nThis  is  a  reasonable  motivation:  States  have  \"a  strong  interest \nin  ensuring  the  public  safety  and  order\"  and  \"in  promoting  the \nfree  flow  of  traffic  on  publi c  streets  and  sidewalks .\"  Madsen  v. \nWomen' s  Health  Ctr. ,  Inc.,  512  U.S.  753,  768  (1994).  In \naddition,  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  alleged  plausible  facts  to \nshow  that  Defendants  Maguire  and  Poletto's  use  of  the  XlOO  was \nbased  on  Plaintiffs'  exercise  of  free  speech.3 \nPlainti ffs '  claim  as  to  the  dispel  order  similarly  fails . \nFirst,  \"the  clear  and  present  danger  standard\"  is  inappropriate \nhere,  as  Plaintiffs'  FAC  pleads  only  that  the  officers  were \n3  The  one  excepti on  is  Plaintiff Horse's  claim  that  Defendants \nMaguire  and  Poletto  targeted  him  due  to  a  \"critical  comment\" \nHorse  made  towards  them.  (FAC  '1I  228 . )  Given  the  context  of  the \nofficer's  actions  and  their  use  of  the  XlOO  directed  at  all \nsurrounding  protestors  and  demonstration  attendees,  even \nPlaintiff Horse's  claim does  not  \"plausibly  establish\"  that \nDefendants'  actions  were  inspired  by  his  shout .

Thus,  to  the  extent  that  Defendants'  use \nof  the  XlOO  constitutes  a  dispel  order,  the  actions  are  properly \nanalyzed  as  a  time,  place,  manner  restriction.  Under  that \nmetric,  the  claim  first  fails  because  the  officers  left  open  an \nadequate  alternative  location  within  \"close  proximity\"  to  the \noriginal  l ocation  in  the  street:  the  sidewalk.  Wil es,  2016  WL \n6238609,  at  *5  (accepting  a  park  a  few  blocks  away  from  the \ncurrent  protest  area  as  sufficiently proximate).  The  State  has  a \nstrong  interest  in  permitting  free  flowing  traffic  on  public \nstreets  and  sidewalks,  \"which  is  sufficient  to  justify a \nnarrowly  tailored  injunction.\"  Id.  And  as  already  discussed, \nthere  are  no  plausible  allegations  that  Defendants  Maguire  and \nPoletto  used  the  XlOO  because  of  the  content  of  any  speech  by \nPlaintiffs. \nAccordingly,  Defendants'  motion  to  dismiss  Count  Two  of  the \nFAC  is  granted. \niii .  Equal  Protection  And  Substantive  Due  Process  Violation \nClaims  Under  The  Fourteenth  Amendment  (Count  Three) \nPl aintiffs  allege  that  Defendants  violated  their  rights  to \nequal  protection  and  substantive  due  process  under  the \nFourteenth  Amendment .  (FAC  409-411 . )  With  regard  to  their \n~~ \n23 \n\nsubstantive  due  process  claim,  Plaintiffs  specifically contend \nthat  Defendants'  actions  violated  their  constitutionally \nprotected  \"right  to  remain\"  and  \"right  to  travel\"  and  that \nDefendants'  actions  \"shocked  the  conscious .\"  (Opp.  Mem.  at  12-\n13. )  None  of  these  claims  can  survive. \nThe  Plaintiffs'  additional  substantive  due  process  claim \nfails.  A  police  officer  requesting  that  protestors  move  from  the \nstreet  to  the  sidewalk  is  in  furtherance  of  a  reasonable  State \ninterest  and  is  the  kind  of  \"minor  restri ction[]  on  travel \n[that]  simply  do[es]  not  amount  to  the  denial  of  a  fundamental \nr i ght .\"  Selevan  v .

Plaintiffs'  FAC  fails  to  plausibly  allege \nthat  Plaintiffs  were  treated  any  differently  than  any  other \npersons  present  at  the  protest.  Instead,  as  Defendants  note,  the \nFAC  repeatedly  alleges  the  opposite:  that  the  Defendants  Maguire \nand  Polet to  used  the  lOOX  \"indiscriminately,\"  (FAC  !  225) ,  and \nagainst  \"all  people  in  the  area,\"  (FAC  !  396;  see  also  FAC \n' '  120,  406). \nAccordingly,  Defendants'  motion  to  dismiss  Count  Three  of \nthe  FAC  is  granted. \niv.

For  the  third  theory,  Plaintiffs  have  alleged  that \n~ \nthe  NYPD  only  started using  LRADs  at  protests  with  any \nregularity  shortly before  the  Protest,  making  it implausible  to \nsustain  a  claim based  on  a  \"persistent  and  widespread\"  practice \nof  LRAD  abuse .

(See  Supp.  Mem.  at  23-24 . )  Assuming  the \nallegations  to  be  true  and  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  the \nPlaintiffs,  the  FAC  puts  forward  plausible  claims  that,  by  the \nnight  of  the  Protest,  Defendant  NYC  knew  that  police  officers \nwere  using  LRAD  devi ces  as  part  of  protest,  (FAC  70- 71) ,  had \n~~ \nconsidered  the  LRAD  devices'  noise-magnifying  capacities \nimportant  enough  to  study,  (FAC  73- 77) ,  was  aware  of  the \n~ \n30 \n\ndevices'  noise-magnifying  hazards5,  (see  FAC  ~  75) ,  and  did  not \nchange  NYPD  policies  or  practices  to  discuss  the  proper  usage  of \nLRAD  devices  in  the  field,  (see  FAC  ~~  97 ,  99- 103) . 6  The \nChamberlain  court's  reasoning  in  allowing  a  Monell  liability \nclaim  against  the  City  of  White  Plain  for  failing  to  train \npolice  officers  on  how  t o  deal  with  emotionally  disturbed \npersons  (\"EDPs\")  to  survive  a  motion  to  dismiss  is  instructive \nhere: \nThe  Amended  Complaint  essentially asserts  that  WPPD \nofficials  knew  to  a  \"moral  certainty,\" Walker,  974 \nF.2d  at  297 ,  that  [White  Plains  police]  officers  would \nencounter  EDPs  in  the  course  of  their  duties  . \nFurthermore,  given  the  extreme  volatility  of  such \nindividuals  and  the  need  for  caution  when  dealing  with \nthem  to  prevent  unnecessary  escalation,  it is \nplausible  that  interactions  with  EDPs  present  officers \nwith  \"difficult  choice[s]  of  the  sort  that  training \n.  will  make  less  difficult,\" Walker,  974  F.2d  at \n297,  and  that  a  \"highly  predictable  consequence\"  of \nofficers  making  the  wrong  choices,  Connick,  131  S.Ct. \nat  1361  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted) ,  would  be \n5 Defendants  argue  that  the  t ests  performed  by  the  NYPD  were  for \nthe  Model  3300,  not  the  XlOO,  and  are  therefore  \"completely \nirrelevant.\"  (Supp.  Mem.  at  25 . )  While  the  precise  readings  from \nthe  tests  to  not  speak  to  the  exact  impact  of  the  XlOO  on  a \nlistener,  the  tests  demonstrate  the  range  of  power  of  the  new \nLRAD  tools  and  the  plausibly  pled  need  for  training  on  LRAD \nequipment  generally. \n6  Defendants  point  to  the  NYPD' s  Patrol  Guide  at  proof  of \ntraining,  which  Plaintiffs  allege  included  instructi ons  to \npolice  officers  to  use  \"the  minimal  necessary  force\"  while  on \npatrol .  (Reply  Mem.  at  11;  FAC  393 . )  That  is  not  substantively \n~ \nsufficient  guidance  to  ensure  that  officers  know  how  to  safely \nand  effectively  use  potentially hazard  equipment  like  LRAD \ndevices . \n31 \n\n\"the  deprivation  of  a  citizen' s  constitutional \nrights,\"  Walker,  974  F.2d  at  298 . \nChamberlain,  986  F.

Plaintiff' s  allegations  paint  a  reasonably \nplausible  picture  of  Defendant  NYC  arming  officers  with \npowerful,  potenti ally  harmful  LRAD  devices  and  placing  those \nofficers  in  expectantly  volatile  protests,  where  officers  would \nbe  presented  with  opportunities  to  use  the  LRAD  device .  Even  in \nthe  absence  of  prior  similar  vi olati ons,  the  NYC  knew  that \nofficers  with  LRADs  in  the  field  were  likely  to  face  diffi cult \nscenarios,  such  as  increasingly  agitated  protests,  where  the \nrisk  and  harm  of  improperly  using  LRAD  devices  are  great-\nproblems  that  could  have  been  avoided  with  proper  training . \nThus,  \" [t]he  complaint  states  a  claim  under  the  single-incident \ntheory  of  liability contemplated  in  City  of  Canton,  and \nrecognized  by  the  cited  authority  post-Connick.\"  Walker,  89  F. \nSupp.  3d  at  286- 87 . \nAccordingly,  to  the  extent  that  Plaintiffs'  municipal \nliability claim  is  premised  on  Defendant  NYC' s  failure  to \nproperly  train  under  Monell,  Defendants'  motion  to  dismi ss  Count \nFour  of  the  FAC  is  denied. \n32 \n\nv .

BROCKER \nCorporation Counsel  100 CHURCH STREET  Assistant Corporation Counsel \nNEW YORK, NY 10007 Phone: (212) 356-2332 \nFax: (212) 356-3509 \npbrocker@law.nyc.gov \nApril 15, 2019 \nVIA ECF \nHonorable Jesse M. Furman, U.S.D.J. \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \n40 Foley Square  \nNew York, NY 10007 \nRe:  Anika Edrei, et al. v. City of New York, et al., \n16 Civ. 1652 (JMF) (BCM)   \nYour Honor: \nI am an Assistant Corporation Counsel in the office of Zachary W. Carter, Corporation \nCounsel of the City of New York, attorney for defendants in the above referenced matter.  \nDefendants write to respectfully request that the Court stay this action pending the resolution of \ndefendants’ pending interlocutory appeal. Although Plaintiffs’ counsel disagree with, dispute, \nand do not join in Defendants’ legal arguments regarding their application for a stay, primarily \nfor the reasons set forth in Plaintiffs’ July 12, 2017 letter (Dkt. No. 64), Plaintiffs’ counsel \nrecognize that the Court can grant a discretionary stay, and consent to Defendants’ application \nfor a stay at this time. \nBy way of brief background, plaintiffs brought this action claiming that defendants used a \nlong-range acoustic device (“LRAD”) while they were engaged in protests on December 4-5, \n2014 in the vicinity of 57th Street, between Madison Avenue and Park Avenue, in New York \nCounty.  Plaintiffs  claim  that  the  use  of  the  LRAD  violated,  inter  alia,  their  Fourteenth \nAmendment rights.  \nIn response to plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint, defendants moved to dismiss the \ncomplaint in its entirety. See, Dkt. No. 35. That motion to dismiss was granted in part and denied \nin part. See, Dkt. No. 53. Defendants then filed an interlocutory appeal to the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, in response to which Judge Sweet stayed the present action. See, Dkt. Nos. 57 \n(notice of interlocutory appeal) & 66 (staying the present action pending resolution of defendants \nappeal). The Second Circuit affirmed the District Court’s denial of their motion to dismiss, and \nrejected defendants’ arguments for qualified immunity. See, Edrei v. Maguire, 892 F.3d 525, 529 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-JMF   Document 78   Filed 04/16/19   Page 2 of 2\n(2d Cir. 2018). As a result, the stay in this matter was lifted. See, Dkt. No. 69. Upon information \nand belief, in conference before Judge Sweet on September 25, 2018, it was anticipated that if \ndefendants sought a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court, any party could apply to re-\nimpose the stay pending the resolution of that request and/or appeal to the extent that a writ of \ncertiorari was granted. Defendants, subsequently, petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of \ncertiori on December 19, 2018. \nDefendants now seek to re-impose a stay of this matter pending their appeal to the \nSupreme Court, as “[t]he filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance—it \nconfers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those \naspects of the case involved in the appeal.”  Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 \nU.S. 56, 58 (1982).  The principle extends to interlocutory qualified immunity appeals. The \ndenial of qualified immunity is appealable on an interlocutory basis under the collateral order \ndoctrine, because qualified immunity is “an immunity from suit . . . and is effectively lost if the \ncase is erroneously permitted to go to trial.”  Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 376 (2007) (quoting \nMitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985)); see also Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 200 \n(2001) (noting the doctrine is “an entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of \nlitigation”).  \nWhether there should be a trial at all is the precise question at issue in a qualified \nimmunity  appeal. To proceed through discovery  or to  trial despite an unresolved qualified \nimmunity appeal is to deny the appellate court its ability to render the very relief sought. “‘It \nfollows that a proper [qualified immunity] appeal divests the district court of jurisdiction (that is, \nauthority) to require the appealing defendants to appear for trial.’” McCue v. City of New York, \n503 F.3d 167, 169 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Apostol v. Gallion, 870 F.2d 1335, 1338 (7th Cir. \n1989)).  District courts within the Second Circuit have recognized the point.  See, e.g., In re \nSouth African Apartheid Litig., Nos. 02 MDL 1499 (SAS), 02 Civ. 4712 (SAS), 02 Civ. 6218 \n(SAS),  03  Civ.  1024  (SAS),  03  Civ.  4524  (SAS),  2009  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  123437,  at  *2 \n(S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2009); Bradley v. Jusino, No. 04 Civ. 8411. 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42776 \n(S.D.N.Y. May 18, 2009).  \nAccordingly, defendants respectfully submit that this Court should stay the present action \nuntil such time as the Supreme Court has completed its review and issued a mandate returning \njurisdiction to this Court. \nThank you for your consideration in this regard. \nRespectfully, \n/s// \nPeter W. Brocker \nAssistant Corporation Counsel \ncc:  All Counsel of Record (Via ECF) \nThe parties' joint motion to stay the proceedings pending Defendants' forthcoming appeal is hereby GRANTED.  \nThe parties shall promptly advise the Court if or when the stay can be lifted. In light of that, the conference \nscheduled for May 14, 2019, is hereby CANCELLED. The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate Docket No. \n77. SO ORDERED this 16th day of April, 2019.\n2 \n____________________________________\n ",

USCA Case Number \n17-2065. Plaintiffs, six individuals who participated in and observed \nprotests in Manhattan on the night of December 4.5, 2014, sued \nLieutenant John Maguire and Officer Mike Poletto (\"defendants\") of \nthe New York Police Department under 42 U.S.C. 1983. The \ncomplaint alleges, among other things, that defendants violated \nplaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment right against excessive force \nwhen they used a long-range acoustic device (\"LRAD\"), also known \nas a \"sound gun,\" to disperse non-violent protesters, resulting in \nsignificant injuries, including hearing loss. Defendants moved to \ndismiss, arguing, in part, that they were entitled to qualified \nimmunity because the complaint neither stated a Fourteenth \nAmendment claim nor alleged a violation of clearly established law. \nThe district court rejected both arguments, reasoning that LRADs, \nwhich can cause injuries comparable to those caused by other tools \nthat are capable of excessive force, fit within the scope of existing \nprecedents.

On December 4 and 5, 2014, Plaintiffs were each participating in, observing, or \notherwise documenting protests and police responses in the wake of the Staten Island grand \njury’s decision not to indict New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) Officer Daniel \nPantaleo in connection with the death of Eric Garner when Defendants NYPD LIEUTENANT \n“JOHN DOE #1” MAGUIRE and “JOHN DOE #2”  - officers from the NYPD’s Disorder \nControl Unit (“DCU”) – injured them by firing an LRAD Corporation-manufactured 100X \nModel Long Range Acoustic Device (“LRAD”) in the vicinity of 57th Street around Madison \nAvenue and in nearby New York City streets.  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 2 of 50\n2.  This is a combined civil rights and New York State law action brought to \nvindicate Plaintiffs’ rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the \nConstitution of the United States, through the Civil Rights Act of 1871, as amended, codified as \n42 U.S.C. § 1983, the attendant provisions of the New York State Constitution, including, but \nnot limited to, Article I, §§ 8, 9, 11 and 12 thereof, and New York State common laws. Plaintiffs \nseek an award of compensatory and punitive damages as well as attorneys’ fees. \n3.  The LRAD was developed as a sound weapon designed for military applications \nin the wake of the 2000 attack on the USS Cole in Yemen.  \n4.  The LRAD is more a sound weapon than a traditional loudspeaker or megaphone.  \n5.  A traditional loudspeaker or megaphone, including the familiar police megaphone \ntypically used by the NYPD in connection with crowd control, amplifies sound by use of a \ndiaphragm. In contrast, the LRAD technology uses piezoelectric transducers to concentrate - and \ndirect - acoustic energy. \n6.  According to a Product Guide provided by the self-described “global leader in \nlong range acoustic hailing devices,” LRAD Corporation, “the Long Range Acoustic Device® \n(LRAD) produces a concentrated 30 [degree] beam of sound to broadcast highly intelligible \nvoice messages (live or pre-recorded) and powerful alarm tones over large distances.”  \n7.  According to an Amnesty International report issued in 2014: \nLRADs emit high volume sounds at various frequencies, with some ability to \ntarget the sound to particular areas. Used at close range, loud volume and/or \nexcessive lengths of time, LRADs can pose serious health risks which range from \ntemporary pain, loss of balance and eardrum rupture, to permanent hearing \ndamage. LRADs also target people relatively indiscriminately, and can have \nmarkedly different effects on different individuals and in different environments.1 \n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n1   “On the Streets of America: Human Rights Abuses in Ferguson,” AMNESTY \nINTERNATIONAL REPORT, October 24, 2014), available at \n  2 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 3 of 50\n8.  According to the NYPD’s own DCU in January of 2010: \nSound travels in waves, and generally spreads in all directions from a source, in \nthe form of a wave front…. The LRAD…focuses the sound waves in a specific \ndirection. While the sound being emitted from in front of the LRAD may be very \nloud, it is substantially quieter outside the “cone” of sound produced by the \ndevice. In fact, someone could stand next to the device or just behind it and hear \nthe noise being emitted at much lower levels than someone standing several \nhundred feet away, but within the “cone” of sound being emitted. 2 \n \n9.  According to the manufacturer, in ideal conditions, sound amplified by the LRAD \nis directed in a 30-to-45-degree, cone-shaped beam emitting from the front of the LRAD.3  \n10.  LRADs are immensely loud: As an “emergency mass notification” solution, the \nmanufacturer’s materials boast that “LRAD systems blow away bullhorns by being 20-35 dB \nlouder and allowing law enforcement personnel to quickly communicate instructions and \ndirections to large groups. LRAD can be heard clearly through buildings or moving vehicles…”4  \n11.  Also according to the manufacturer, “LRAD broadcasts have been optimized to \nthe 1 – 5 kHz range where human hearing is most sensitive.”5   \n12.  According to the DCU: \nAlthough it can be thought of as a ‘loudspeaker’, [the LRAD] actually works \ndifferently and may also be used as an ‘area denial’ device for crowd control \nmanagement purposes. . . . In addition to having “loudspeaker” capabilities, the \ndevice can also be used, in a special mode, to propel piercing sound at higher \nlevels (as measured in decibels) than are considered safe to human ears. In this \ndangerous range (above 120 decibels), the device can cause damage to someone’s \n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nhttp://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/on-the-streets-of-america-human-rights-abuses-in-\nferguson?page=show (“Amnesty International Ferguson Report”) (last accessed March 2, 2016).  \n2   See January 2010 NYPD Special Operations Division Disorder Control Unit “Briefing on \nthe LRAD (Long Range Acoustical Device)” (“DCU LRAD Briefing”) at p. 3. A true copy of \nthe DCU LRAD Briefing is annexed hereto as Exhibit A. \n3   See, e.g., LRAD 100X Datasheet; description of LRAD 100X on LRAD Corporations \nwebsite, available at http://www.lradx.com/site/content/view/207/110/ (last accessed December \n2014).  \n4   Id.  \n5   Roger Cook, “LRAD Bridges the Communication Gap in Civil Emergency Situations,” \nLRAD CORPORATION WHITE PAPER  (May 2011), at p. 3.  \n  3 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 4 of 50\nhearing and may be painful, It is this technology that device was designed for a \nUSS Cole attack-type scenario. If mounted aboard a Navy ship, the device’s \nloudspeaker could be used to “warn off” boats that come too close. If those \nwarnings are ignored, the device could be used to send out sound at a dangerously \nhigh level causing attackers to turn away, or at least, to cause pain/hearing \ndamage to try to repel the attack.6  \n \n13.  According to one of the manufacturer’s statements in marketing the LRAD as a \ncrowd control device to law enforcement:  \nWhen LRAD’s deterrent tone is used at close range, protesters sense audible \ndiscomfort, cover their ears and move away. Just the act of covering ears with \nhands reduces the sound pressure level (SPL) by approximately 25dB and could \nprevent protestors from throwing protesters. LRAD can be quickly modulated in \nresponse to protesters actions by controlling the audio output through a \nprominently positioned volume control knob. Law enforcement agencies with \nconcerns about the deterrent tone and [sic] can easily disable this option.”7 \n \n14.  The same marketing document employs the below diagram to illustrate an LRAD \nblasting waves of “intense communication” over a 2-3 block area of Times Square, and “clear \ncommunication” from around 41st Street to beyond 54th Street: \n \n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n6   See DCU LRAD Briefing at p. 2.  \n7   “Law Enforcement Solutions: Saving Lives Through Clear Communication,” LRAD \nCORPORATION (Jan. 8, 2014).  \n  4 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 5 of 50\n15.  As seen below, on December 5, 2014, Defendants Maguire and JD#2 utilized the \nLRAD as a weapon against Plaintiffs and others by operating it as if it were a megaphone at \nunsafe distances and volumes, and by repeatedly firing its so-called “deterrent” tone at unsafe \ndistances and volumes from distances as close as a car width away.  \n16.  Those gratuitous and unlawful uses of force and authority against Plaintiffs \nphysically controlled Plaintiffs’ movements and also caused Plaintiffs to endure physical and \nother injuries, including deprivations of their rights to free speech, assembly, expression, and to \ngather and disseminate information freely, as well as their free press rights. \n17.  Additionally, Defendants City and Bratton failed properly to train and/or \nsupervise Defendants Maguire and JD#2 in connection with deploying and using the LRAD. \n18.  For example, although Defendants City and Bratton knew specifically that \nPlaintiffs had been injured by Defendants as early as December of 2014, they ratified and \nendorsed Defendants’ conduct. \n19.  Also, since learning of Plaintiffs’ injuries, Defendants City and Bratton have \nfailed to develop policies and practices governing the safe use of LRADs and failed to train and \nsupervise NYPD officers in the use of LRADs.  \n20.  On December 12, 2014, within days of the December 5, 2014 LRAD firings that \ninjured Plaintiffs, counsel wrote Defendant Bratton a nine-page letter along with a request under \nthe Freedom of Information Law, a true copy of which is annexed hereto as Exhibit B, including \ndetailed complaints about the December 5, 2014 LRAD uses, and calling on Defendant Bratton \nto direct officers under his command  \nto refrain from using the LRAD for crowd control purposes until thorough, \nindependent testing and review has been conducted; appropriate, written \nguidelines regarding the use of LRADs, including their use as force tools and their \nuse for crowd control purposes, are promulgated and made public; members of \n  5 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 6 of 50\nthe service authorized to operate LRADs are adequately trained in them; and there \nare adequate use of force reporting requirements in place to document the \ncircumstances under which the Department’s LRADs are utilized.  \n \n21.   Defendant Bratton did not respond to the letter directly.  \n \n22.   However, as reported by Colin Moynihan in the New York Times on December 12, 2014,  \nA spokesman for the Police Department said that officer training in the use of the \ndevices addresses intensity of sound, duration and distance. ‘On December 4th all of \nthese factors were controlled at levels that are not considered dangerous or harmful,’ \nthe spokesman said, adding that the device has only been used to advise people of \nillegal conduct.8 \n \n23.  To the contrary, as seen below, the LRAD was used for pain compliance and \nother purposes against Plaintiffs on December 5, 2014.  \n24.  Additionally, Defendants Maguire and JD#2 used the LRAD to seize Plaintiffs \nand assault them with unreasonably loud sound waves from unreasonably close distances and/or \nfor unreasonably long periods of time. \n25.  Defendants Maguire and JD#2 fired the LRAD almost continuously while \ndirecting its area of effect cone at Plaintiffs within ten feet, even turning to angle the cone toward \nPlaintiffs and others who were only a car width away.  \n26.  By way of further example, the image below shows the “LRAD 100X Operation \nZones” as depicted on the back of an LRAD 100X, including a red “beam” graphic extending in \na 30’ cone from the front of the LRAD labeled “DO NOT ENTER WITHIN 10 METERS \nDURING CONTINUOUS OPERATION” and a yellow graphic indicating an approximately \nthree-foot area around the LRAD in which persons are cautioned not to enter “without hearing \nprotection.”  \n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n8   Colin Moynihan, Concerns Raised Over Shrill Device New York Police Used During \nGarner Protests, NEW YORK TIMES, December 12, 2014, available at \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/13/nyregion/lawyers-raise-concerns-over-shrill-device-used-\nby-police-during-garner-protests.html (last visited March 3, 2016). \n  6 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 7 of 50\n \n \n27.  Thus, as seen below, Defendants Maguire and JD#2 not only violated Plaintiffs’ \nrights and injured them – Defendants Bratton and City are also liable for those violations and \ninjuries, including because Defendant Bratton ratified Defendants’ Maguire’s and JD#2’s \nmisconduct. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n28.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over federal claims pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a)(3) and (4).  \n29.  The federal claims in this action are brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for \nviolations of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United \nStates. \n30.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) in that the Plaintiffs’ claims \narose in the County of New York in the State of New York, within the confines of this judicial \ndistrict. \n  7 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 8 of 50\n31.  Pursuant to New York State General Obligations Law § 50-e, Plaintiffs EDREI, \nSTEPHAN, CRAVEN, and HORSE filed timely Notices of Claim with the New York City \nComptroller on or about March 4, 2015, within 90 days of the events herein complained of.  \n32.  Plaintiff NUSBAUM filed a Notice of Claim on March 6, 2015.  \n33.  By letter dated March 19, 2015, the Comptroller disallowed the claim on the basis \nthat the Notice of Claim had been submitted one day past the 90-day deadline. \n34.  On March 3, 2016, Plaintiff Nusbaum initiated a proceeding seeking leave to file \na Notice of Claim out of time, including on the basis that the Comptroller had actual notice of his \nclaim by virtue of the other five Notices of Claim that were timely filed on March 4, 2015 and \nthe letter sent to the New York Police Department on December 12, 2014, Index number \n151826/2016.  That proceeding is pending. \n35.  Plaintiffs’ claims were not adjusted by the New York City Comptroller’s Office \nwithin the period of time provided by statute. \n36.  Thus, this Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims under the \nConstitution and laws of the State of New York because they are so related to the within federal \nclaims that they form part of the same case or controversy pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).  \n37.  An award of costs and attorneys’ fees is authorized pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988. \nPARTIES \n38.  Plaintiff ANIKA EDREI was at all times relevant to this action a resident of the \nCounty of Kings in the State of New York.  \n39.  Plaintiff SHAY HORSE was at all times relevant to this action a resident of the \nCounty of Kings in the State of New York.  \n  8 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 9 of 50\n40.  Plaintiff JAMES CRAVEN was at all times relevant to this action a resident of \nthe County of Queens in the State of New York. \n41.  Plaintiff KEEGAN STEPHAN was at all times relevant to this action a resident of \nthe County of Queens in the State of New York. \n42.  Plaintiff MICHAEL NUSBAUM was at all times relevant to this action a resident \nof Easthampton, Massachusetts.  \n43.  Defendant THE CITY OF NEW YORK (“CITY”) is a municipal entity created \nand authorized under the laws of the State of New York. It is authorized by law to maintain a \npolice department, which acts as its agent in the area of law enforcement and for which it is \nultimately responsible. The CITY assumes the risks incidental to the maintenance of a police \nforce and the employment of police officers as said risks attach to the public consumers of the \nservices provided by the NYPD. \n44.  Defendant WILLIAM BRATTON was the NYPD’s Police Commissioner at all \ntimes relevant herein, and as such was personally involved in developing and/or implementing \nand/or ratifying the unconstitutional policies, practices, customs and/or conduct complained of \nherein. Defendant Bratton was at all time relevant herein the highest ranking duly appointed and \nacting supervisory officer within the NYPD, ultimately responsible as a policymaker and \nsupervisor for the training, retention, supervision, discipline, and control of subordinate members \nof the NYPD. \n45.  At all times relevant herein, Defendants NYPD LIEUTENANT “JOHN DOE #1” \nMAGUIRE and “JOHN DOE #2” (referred to collectively as the “officer-defendants”) were \nofficers, employees, and agents of the NYPD and who were personally involved in depriving \n  9 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 10 of 50\nPlaintiffs of their rights and in implementing the unconstitutional policies, practices, customs \nand/or conduct complained of herein, as set forth more fully below. \n46.  Defendant MAGUIRE is the NYPD officer to the left, with his hand on the \nLRAD, in the below photographs. Defendant JD#2 is the officer to the right in the second \nphotograph. \n \n \n47.  Copies of the second photograph were included along with each of Plaintiffs’ \nNotices of Claim filed in March 2014 in order to put Defendants on notice to identify Defendant \nMaguire and JD#2 and to provide them with information to assist them in doing so. \n  10 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 11 of 50\n48.  At all times hereinafter mentioned, Defendants, either personally or through their \nemployees, were acting under color of state law and/or in compliance with the official rules, \nregulations, laws, statutes, customs, usages and/or practices of the State or City of New York. \n49.  Each and all of the acts and omissions of the Defendants alleged herein occurred \nwhile said Defendants acting within the scope of their employment by the Defendant City. \n50.  Each and all of the acts and omissions of the Defendants alleged herein occurred \nwhile said Defendants were acting in furtherance of their employment by the Defendant City. \n51.  Defendants were duly appointed and acting officers, servants, employees, and \nagents of Defendant City who were acting for, and on behalf of, and with the power and \nauthority vested in them by Defendant City, and were otherwise performing and engaging in \nconduct incidental to the performance of their lawful functions in the course of their duties. \n52.  Defendants were each and all responsible, in whole and/or in part, for the \nplanning for and/or creation, promulgation, implementation, and/or enforcement of the \nunconstitutional policies, practices and/or customs complained of herein, and/or condoned, \nacquiesced in, adopted, and/or approved of the same, through their acts and/or failures to act, as \nset forth more fully below. \n53.  At all times relevant herein, as set forth more fully below, Defendants’ actions \nand/or failures to act were malicious, intentional, knowing, and/or with a deliberate indifference \nto or a reckless regard for the natural and probable consequences of their acts and/or omissions. \n54.  Each individual Defendant is sued in her or his individual and official capacities. \n55.  At all relevant times, the officer-defendants were engaged in a joint venture, \nassisting each other in performing the various actions described herein and lending their physical \npresence and support and the authority of their offices to one another. \n  11 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 12 of 50\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nTHE NYPD AND LRADS – 2004 THROUGH 2014 \n56.  Upon information and belief, the NYPD purchased two LRAD Model 3300 \ndevices in 2004, in advance of the Republican National Convention (“RNC”) in New York City \nin August of 2004.  \n57.  Upon information and belief, those LRADs were “among the first devices sold to \nlaw enforcement.”9 \n58.  The DCU conducted tests utilizing those LRADs in 2004 but as of 2010 the \nresults of those tests were “unavailable.” 10 \n59.  Then-NYPD spokesman Paul Browne cited two possible uses for them to the \nAssociated Press (“AP”) in 2004: “directing crowds to safety following a terrorist attack or other \ncalamity, and reminding protesters where they're allowed to march and rally.”11 \n60.  According to the AP, the Department “insist[ed that] the [warning tone] feature \n[would not] be used at the convention” and then-DCU Commander Thomas Graham guaranteed \nthe public that the LRAD was “only to communicate in large crowds.12  \n61.  According to the NYPD itself, the NYPD only used the LRAD in connection with \nthe 2004 RNC “sporadically…as loudspeakers.” Also according to the NYPD, “[b]oth devices \nwere used sporadically in Manhattan at protests outside of the convention site (Madison Square \nGarden), including those in the Union Square area . . . as a loudspeaker to make announcements \n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n9   DCU LRAD Briefing at p. 8. \n10   DCU LRAD Briefing at p. 4. \n11   Tom Hays, “Authorities to Turn up the Volume for GOP Convention: A 150-decibel \nMegaphone,” ASSOCIATED PRESS (Aug. 19, 2004). \n12   Id. \n  12 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 13 of 50\nto the crowd of protesters, with mixed results.”13 \n62.  Neither Plaintiffs nor counsel are aware of uses of the LRAD by the NYPD \nbetween 2004 and around 2011. Nevertheless, during that time period, the NYPD policed \nthousands of First Amendment assemblies involving street and sidewalk marches. \n63.  Plaintiffs and counsel are only aware of a few incidents in which the NYPD \ndeployed  LRADs between 2011 and November of 2014. \n64.  All were in connection with protests, and most were in connection with protests \nagainst police brutality. \n65.  For example, upon information and belief, the NYPD did not deploy LRADs to \nuse in communicating with New Yorkers in the wake of or in connection with recovery efforts \nrelated to Hurricane Sandy. \n66.  LRADs deployed by the NYPD have frequently been observed beginning since \naround late 2014 - but only in connection with policing protests, and especially in connection \nwith protests against policy brutality. \n67.  LRADs were first observed regularly deployed by the NYPD in connection with \nthe protests against police brutality that had begun just days before in the aftermath of the \nNovember 24, 2014 announcement that the Ferguson, Missouri grand jury considering charges \nagainst Darren Wilson, the law enforcement officer who shot and killed Mike Brown, had voted \nno true bill, and which resurged in the wake of the Staten Island grand jury’s failure to indict \nNYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo on December 3, 2014.  \n68.  Upon information and belief, although the NYPD had been using LRADs in \nconnection with policing demonstrations since 2004, at no time prior to September of 2012 did \n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n13   DCU LRAD Briefing at p. 2. \n  13 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 14 of 50\nthe NYPD develop or train its officers who were charged with using LRADs in policies, \ndirectives, manuals, or memoranda related to the proper use or operation of LRADs, how LRAD \nuses related to established NYPD use of force protocols, when the use of the LRAD’s “deterrent” \ntone was appropriate, and at what volumes, distances, and frequencies, or anything else at all \nrelated to LRADs.  \n69.  The basis for that information and belief is that, in 2011, Plaintiff Keegan Stephan \nand another person filed a Freedom of Information Law (“FOIL”) request with the NYPD \nseeking, inter alia, records related to any policies whatsoever related to LRAD operation and \nuse, and the NYPD eventually averred that its diligent searches had uncovered no such policies. \n70.  The only documents the NYPD located related to LRADs or NYPD use of \nLRADs in its possession at all as of 2012 were seventeen pages of news clippings and marketing \nmaterials from the manufacturer and the eight-page DCU “Briefing on the LRAD” dated January \nof 2010. \n71.  Therefore, as of at least 2012, the NYPD had no written policies or training \nmaterials related to LRAD use. \n72.  As reflected in the DCU LRAD Briefing, the DCU tested its two LRAD Model \n3300 devices again in 2010 “in an empty parking lot at Orchard Beach, in the Bronx.” 14  \n73.  The DCU conducted two tests: The first with the power/audio “turned to level just \nbelow Maximum, using spoken voice commands” and the second with the power/audio “turned \nto maximum, using noise bursts.”15 \n74.  The tests revealed as follows: \nTest #1 – Just below maximum, spoken voice commands \n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n14   Id. at pp. 4-6. \n15   Id. at pp. 5-6. \n  14 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 15 of 50\n102 dB at 320 feet \n78 dB at 640 feet \n64 dB at 800 feet \n \nTest #2 – Maximum, noise bursts \n110 dB at 320 feet \n90 dB at 640 feet \n68 dB at 800 feet \n \n75.  A DCU chart of “examples of sound levels in comparison” notes that 110 dB is \naround as loud as a power saw.16  \n76.  The DCU did not take any readings within 320 feet of the front of the LRAD \ndevice for either test, calling that zone a “potential danger area” and labeling it “not tested.”17 \n \n77.  At some point after 2010 and before November of 2011, the NYPD purchased at \nleast one LRAD 100x – the type of device used to injure Plaintiffs. \n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n16   Id. at p. 3. \n17   Id.  \n  15 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 16 of 50\n78.  The LRAD 100x manufacturer’s product sheet specifically boasts that it can \nprovide “powerful, intelligible communication up to 600 meters” with a maximum continuous \noutput of 136 dB at 1 meter, A-weighted, and the capacity to overcome 88dB of background \nnoise at 250 meters, which is “10-20 decibels . . . louder than the most competitive megaphones \n[and] four to six times louder [than] . . . [s]ystems of comparable size and power.”18  \n79.  “The level of sound produced by these devices exceeds both the threshold for \nhuman discomfort (between 85 and 95 dB) and the normal human pain threshold (between 120 \nand 140 dB).”19  \n80.  According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, \n“exposures [greater than] 85 dB may cause hearing loss.”20  \n81.  According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication \nDisorders, “any sound over 90 dB can damage a person’s hearing. So the LRAD can threaten the \nhearing of anyone in its path, regardless of whether there is any wrongdoing, even when used \nonly for communication.”21   \n82.  Against that backdrop, \nThe possible health risks are magnified due to the fact that the LRAD is a large-\nscale device, targeting a large population rather than specific individuals. Pain \ntolerance varies among the population, and certain groups – including children – \nare more vulnerable to hearing loss. Moreover, individuals within large crowds \nmay be unable to move out of the LRAD’s range due to physical disability or the \nsheer volume of people in a given area. The indiscriminate nature of this device \n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n18   LRAD 100X Product Sheet (downloaded from LRAD website in December of 2014). \n19   Letter of Canadian Civil Liberties Association to Chief of Police William Blair, dated \nJune 1, 2010 (“CCLA Letter”), at p. 3.  \n20   See http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/noisemeter.html (last visited March 2, 2016). \n21   Tracy V.

In 2009, the Pittsburgh Police Department deployed LRAD’s in connection with \npolicing protests in response to the 2009 G20 Summit. \n84.  The DCU LRAD Briefing says that LRADs were used “successfully” by the \nPittsburgh Police Department in connection with policing the 2009 G20. 23  \n85.  So do the LRAD’s manufacturing materials, which include the following \nquotation from a Pittsburgh law enforcement official: “‘Every police officer I talked to thought it \nworked famously, the bottom line is we could maintain order with the protesters without hurting \nthem.’”24 \n86.  However, immediately after the G20, the American Tinnitus Association, the \nNational Institute of Health, and the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication \nDisorders, reportedly disagreed. \n87.  For example, The Washington Times reported that the American Tinnitus \nAssociation said that protesters had been “‘acoustically assaulted’ with sound” at volumes that \ncould cause ‘tinnitus and hearing damage immediately.’” The Washington Times also reported: \n“The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has said permanent hearing loss can result from sounds \nat about 110 to 120 decibels in short bursts or at 75 decibels with long periods of exposure. The \n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n22   CCLA Letter at p. 3.  \n23   See DCU LRAD Briefing at p. 2. \n24   “Law Enforcement Solutions: Saving Lives Through Clear Communication,” LRAD \nCorporation (Jan. 8, 2014).  \n  17 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 18 of 50\nNational Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders said regular exposure of \nmore than one minute of 110 decibels can result in permanent hearing loss.”25  \n88.  Additionally, in September of 2011, the American Civil Liberties Union of \nPittsburgh sued on behalf of Plaintiff Karen L. Piper, a visiting professor at Carnegie Mellon \nUniversity who suffered permanent hearing loss, nausea, pain and disorientation on September \n24, 2009 when the LRAD was fired at protesters by the City of Pittsburgh and its agents. See \nKaren Piper v. City of Pittsburgh, et al., 11-cv-01215 (JFC)(MPK) (USDC, Western District of \nPennsylvania). \n89.  According to the ACLU and the Piper Complaint: \n \nAfter the protest began, Piper walked on the sidewalk a short distance from the \nmarching protesters, in the company of other curiosity seekers and journalists. When \nPiper became concerned about rapidly increasing police activity, she tried to leave the \narea. As she was walking away, police officers activated, suddenly and without \nwarning, an LRAD a short distance away from her. It emitted a continuous piercing \nsound lasting several minutes. \nPiper immediately suffered intense pain as mucus discharged from her ears. She \nbecame nauseous and dizzy and developed a severe headache. Since then, Piper has \nsuffered from tinnitus (ringing of the ears), barotrauma, left ear pain and fluid \ndrainage, dizziness, and nausea.26  \n90.  Ms. Piper won a $72,000 monetary settlement in that lawsuit in 2012 as well as an \nagreement from the City to develop “a policy governing LRAD deployment to ensure its careful \nand controlled use.”27 \n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n25   “DHS helps local police buy military-style sonic devices,” THE WASHINGTON TIMES, \nOctober 1, 2009.

As articulated by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (“CCLA”) in a letter \nwritten to Canadian government officials in advance of potential Canadian LRAD use to police \nanticipated mass protests in connection with the G8 and G20 in 2010: \nThe introduction of any new weapon into police arsenals requires a process of \nobjective scientific research into the short-term and long-term physical effects of \nthe weapon’s use, consultation with the public who are the potential targets of \nsuch weapons, and policy debates. Reliance on research by the manufacturer is \ninsufficient. . . .  \n \nSimply put, new weapons such as the LRAD should not be employed without \nprior independent assessment and study. Protocols regarding deployment and use \nshould be developed with reference to independent science, not on the basis of \nmanufacturer’s claims and should incorporate public consultation and \nparticipation. Finally, comprehensive reporting, monitoring and oversight \nmechanisms must be established to account for how any approved weapons are \nactually used in the field.28 \n \n92.  In this case, although Defendants Bratton and City knew or should have known as \nearly as 2004 that the LRADs they purchased in 2004 were dangerous weapons, they have not \nconducted adequate studies in connection with LRAD uses, have not developed and trained \nofficers in appropriate, written protocols regarding LRAD deployment and use, and have not \nestablished appropriate reporting, monitoring, and oversight mechanisms, since then.  \n93.  Since some time after December of 2014, Defendants Bratton and City has been \ndeploying LRADs routinely at demonstrations. For example, NYPD officers assigned to the \nDepartment’s “Strategic Response Group” – a unit founded by Defendants Bratton and City in \n2015 that has been a constant presence at protests since 2015 – frequently brandish and/or have \nused LRADs at protests. \n94.  The increased frequency of these LRAD deployments and threatened uses - at \nleast with respect to protests against police brutality - coupled with Plaintiffs’ experiences, and \n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n28   CCLA Letter at p. 3. \n  19 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 20 of 50\nthe proof that the Department had no written policies or practices regarding LRAD use as of \nSeptember 2012, though LRADS were deployed by the Department in connection with crowd \ncontrol between 2004 and September of 2012, show that Defendants’ policies, practices, and \ncustoms with respect to LRAD deployment and use and related lack of training, monitoring, and \noversight were the motivating forces behind the Department’s LRAD uses against Plaintiffs on \nDecember 5, 2014, and the resulting injuries. \nTHE DECEMBER 4-5, 2014 ERIC GARNER GRAND JURY PROTESTS \n95.  On December 3, 2014, news broke that a Staten Island grand jury had declined to \nindict the NYPD officer involved in the death of Eric Garner. \n96.  On December 4, 2014, hundreds protested in New York City, on the streets of \nManhattan, in other boroughs, elsewhere in the country, and internationally. \n97.  On December 4-5, 2014, as described more fully below, Plaintiffs were each \nprotesters, observers, photojournalists, or filmmakers who were participating in, observing, or \ndocumenting the protests and police responses when they were assaulted by Defendants Maguire \nand JD#2 utilizing an LRAD. \n98.  For the first few hours of the evening protests in which Plaintiffs participated or \nwhich Plaintiffs observed or documented, NYPD officers escorted and facilitated the protests. \n99.  At some time after 1:00 am, NYPD officers made arrests in the intersection of \n57th Street and Madison Avenue in Manhattan. \n100.  For example, three to four officers cooperated to pin a person to the ground, \nincluding with a knee in the back, who was not apparently resisting them. \n101.  Some Plaintiffs, and others, gathered to observe, document, and otherwise \nrespond to those police actions, for example by protesting verbally. \n  20 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 21 of 50\n102.  They did not interfere with or threaten the ongoing arrest activity. \n103.  Some unidentified person or persons – not Plaintiffs – then apparently threw some \nobjects, possibly glass bottles, toward the scene. \n104.  The objects did not strike or injure anyone. \n105.  At around the same time, without warning, an NYPD officer or NYPD officers at \nthe scene deployed pepper spray. \n106.  In response, Plaintiffs and many other non-NYPD officers present began to run \naway and otherwise flee from the police, including by moving on 57th Street between Madison \nand Park Avenues. \n107.  Defendant Maguire and JD#2 were holding and jointly operating a LRAD at the \nscene. \n108.  Within moments, Defendants Maguire and JD#2 began to fire the “deterrent” tone \nof the LRAD in the direction of the people who were already fleeing on 57th Street. \n109.  As they operated the LRAD on 57th Street, Defendants Maguire and JD#2 were \nthemselves in the roadway on 57th Street, obstructing the flow of vehicular traffic along with \nmany other NYPD officers who were also present and in the roadways in the intersection of 57th \nStreet and Madison Avenue and nearby. \n110.  At the same time as they repeatedly fired the “deterrent” tone, Defendants \nMaguire and JD#2 also used the LRAD to broadcast messages identifying themselves as NYPD \nand directing people to get or stay on the sidewalk and out of the street or they would be placed \nin custody. \n111.  The use of the “deterrent” tone at the same time as the broadcast feature made it \ndifficult or impossible to hear and/or comply with the police directions. \n  21 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 22 of 50\n112.  The messages were at times conflicting and/or difficult to understand, including \nbecause at least many of the people they were directed at were already fleeing on the sidewalks \nand/or because the police themselves were blocking traffic in the streets. \n113.  In the just under three minutes it took Defendants Maguire and JD#2 to walk the \nlength of 57th Street between Madison and Park Avenues, they fired the LRAD “deterrent” tone \nbetween fifteen or twenty times – almost continuously – as they walked in the roadway, blocking \ntraffic. \n114.  As described more fully below, Plaintiffs were each seized and injured by \nDefendants Maguire and JD#2 on 57th Street between Madison and Park Avenues when \nDefendants fired the LRAD at them. \n115.  When Defendants Maguire and JD#2 fired the LRAD at Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs were \nlawfully and properly exercising their rights and privileges to be on or around the streets and \nsidewalks of the City of New York, to associate, to assemble, to express themselves, and to \ngather and disseminate information freely, as well as their free press rights. \n116.  When Defendants Maguire and JD#2 fired the LRAD at Plaintiffs and others, that \nuse of force terminated or severely limited Plaintiffs’ freedom of movement through pain \ncompliance and threat of permanent injury. \n117.  When Defendants Maguire and JD#2 fired the LRAD at Plaintiffs and others, they \nknew or should have known that the use of the LRAD could cause permanent hearing damage \nand other injury. \n118.  At certain points during the just under three minutes that Defendants Maguire and \nJD#2 were firing the LRAD on 57th Street, they were fewer than ten feet away from Plaintiffs, \nprotesters, and innocent bystanders, angling the LRAD directly at them. \n  22 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 23 of 50\n119.  When Defendants Maguire and JD#2 fired the LRAD at Plaintiffs and others, they \nknew or should have known that the use of the LRAD at such close ranges would be likely to \ncause permanent hearing damage and other injury. \n120.  As seen above, Defendants Bratton and City have ratified Defendants’ Maguire’s \nand JD#2’s uses of force against Plaintiffs. \nANIKA EDREI \n121.  On December 5, 2014, Plaintiff ANIKA EDREI was a twenty-year-old \nphotojournalist and photographer enrolled in a one-year intensive certificate program in \nDocumentary Photography and Photojournalism at the International Center of Photography in \nNew York City.  \n122.  Plaintiff Edrei is known professionally in Plaintiff Edrei’s photojournalism work \nas “Moth Dust”. See http://www.mothdust.net/.  \n123.  Plaintiff Edrei’s work has been published in VICE Motherboard & Galore \nMagazine, among others. Plaintiff Edrei’s images have also been featured in festivals and \ngalleries such as Tipping Point, Guatephoto and several other private shows in New York City. \n124.  On the evening of December 4, 2014, Plaintiff Edrei was informed by co-plaintiff \nand fellow photojournalist Shay Horse that there would be protests in Manhattan related to a \nStaten Island grand jury’s failure to indict the police officer involved in the death of Eric Garner.  \n125.   Plaintiff Edrei attended the protests in order to document them, as part of \nPlaintiff Edrei’s photojournalism coursework, and in order to pitch photographs she might take \nto magazines, newspapers, and other outlets with a view toward publishing them, in the name of \ngathering and publishing newsworthy information, and in furtherance of Plaintiff Edrei’s career \ngoals. \n  23 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 24 of 50\n126.  Plaintiff Edrei followed protests around the streets of Manhattan for several hours.  \n127.  The protesters were escorted and accompanied by NYPD officers for those \nseveral hours.  \n128.  Around or after 1 a.m. on December 5, 2014, at or around the area of 57th Street \nand Madison Avenue, Plaintiff Edrei saw NYPD officers arresting people.   \n129.  Those arrests appeared violent to Plaintiff Edrei.   \n130.  Plaintiff Edrei took photographs of people being placed under arrest with their \nfaces pressed into the ground and police knees in their backs. \n131.  Plaintiff Edrei was careful to position Plaintiff Edrei so that she could get what \nPlaintiff Edrei believed could be newsworthy shots without interfering with the officers. \n132.  Plaintiff Edrei tried to continue taking photographs, but was pushed out of view \nby officers.  \n133.  Plaintiff Edrei heard and saw several protesters verbally protest and beg police to \nstop violently arresting people.  \n134.  Plaintiff Edrei saw people gather to observe the ongoing arrests and police uses of \nforce. \n135.  Plaintiff Edrei heard a sound like glass breaking. \n136.  Plainitff Edrei heard yelling and shouting. \n137.  Plaintiff Edrei started running away. \n138.  Plaintiff Edrei then saw other people who had been gathered near the arrests run \naway. \n139.  From behind Plaintiff Edrei, Plaintiff Edrei then heard a sort of high-pitched, \nwhirring siren what Plaintiff Edrei now believes to be the “deterrent tone” of a LRAD.  \n  24 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 25 of 50\n140.  There was no warning that the deterrent tone of the LRAD would be used. \n141.   At first, Plaintiff Edrei thought Plaintiff Edrei was hearing a very loud car alarm.  \n142.  Plaintiff Edrei then remembered that co-plaintiff Horse had previously told \nPlaintiff Edrei about an LRAD he had seen and heard deployed in Ferguson, Missouri, and \nPlaintiff Edrei formed the belief that Plaintiff Edrei was likely hearing the LRAD.  \n143.   After hearing the LRAD’s deterrent tone, Plaintiff Edrei turned around and \nobserved two NYPD officers holding the LRAD, following behind Plaintiff Edrei and others \nwho were running or otherwise moving quickly away from the police or otherwise fleeing.  \n144.  Almost immediately, Plaintiff Edrei felt a surge of adrenaline and began to \nexperience a migraine and to feel woozy. \n145.  Plaintiff Edrei heard the “deterrent” tone used repeatedly, interrupted by brief \npauses. \n146.  Plaintiff Edrei heard some portions of an unclear and wordy directive to the effect \nof “Get off the street” also coming through the LRAD’s speaker, at the same time the deterrent \ntone was firing.  \n147.  Plaintiff Edrei was in between parked cars on the side of the street, outside the \npart of the roadway reserved for cars to travel on. \n148.  People were running away from the Defendants using the LRAD. \n149.  Plaintiff Edrei tried to put her fingers in her ears to plug them, and to run as fast \nas she could from the sound. \n150.  Plaintiff Edrei was able to leave the immediate area where the police had been \nusing LRAD. \n151.  After being exposed to the LRAD, Plaintiff Edrei was very confused.  \n  25 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 26 of 50\n152.  Plaintiff Edrei tried to meet back up with the marches to continue documenting \nthe night, but her physical condition deteriorated and prevented her from doing that.  \n153.  Specifically, Plaintiff Edrei got a migraine, which then spread to Plaintiff Edrei’s \nentire face.   \n154.  Plaintiff Edrei felt acute pain in her sinuses and overall pain across Plaintiff \nEdrei’s face.  \n155.  Plaintiff Edrei felt very dizzy and had to sit down.  \n156.  People asked if Plaintiff Edrei was alright.  \n157.  Plaintiff Edrei was physically and emotionally jarred. \n158.  Plaintiff Edrei felt very disoriented and wanted to go home.  \n159.  Plaintiff Edrei attempted to call Plaintiff Edrei’s boyfriend to figure out how \nPlaintiff Edrei could get home, but was unable to concentrate.  \n160.  Eventually, someone helped Plaintiff Edrei into a taxi cab that took Plaintiff Edrei \nhome. \n161.  Plaintiff Edrei had a migraine headache for around the next week.  \n162.  For at least the following five days, Plaintiff Edrei noticed that Plaintiff Edrei was \nvery sensitive to sounds and even very soft sounds hurt her ears.   \n163.  Plaintiff Edrei continued to feel woozy and to have a headache. \n164.  Plaintiff Edrei felt a lot of facial pressure for around the next week. \n165.  Ever since the incident, Plaintiff Edrei has been more sensitive to noise than \nPlaintiff Edrei was before the incident. \n166.   Plaintiff Edrei feels very traumatized after having the LRAD’s deterrent sound \nfired at Plaintiff Edrei, particularly as Plaintiff Edrei was at the scene as a member of the press.  \n  26 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 27 of 50\n167.  For Plaintiff Edrei, this was an act of violence committed without warning, while \nPlaintiff Edrei was trying to leave the scene of glass breaking as fast as Plaintiff Edrei could.  \n168.  Plaintiff Edrei experiences ringing in her ears to this day, about half of the time. \n169.  The ringing in Plaintiff Edrei’s ears gets worse after listening to live music. \n170.  After December 5, 2014, Plaintiff Edrei pitched some of the photographs Plaintiff \nEdrei had taken the night of this incident to various publications, including The Villager and The \nShadow.  \n171.  Multiple photographs taken by Plaintiff Edrei were published in VICE \nMotherboard. See Alex Pasternack, The New Sound of Crowd Control, MOTHERBOARD, \nDecember 17, 2014, available at http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-new-sound-of-crowd-\ncontrol (last visited March 2, 2016). \n172.  As part of her photojournalism coursework, Plaintiff Edrei uploaded photographs \nPlaintiff Edrei had taken that night to her professional photography blog. \n173.  Plaintiff Edrei still works as a professional photojournalist and photographer. \n174.  Plaintiff Edrei’s career has been adversely affected by the injuries Plaintiff Edrei \nsustained on December 5, 2014. \n175.  Plaintiff Edrei dream job has always been to be a photojournalist, covering \nprotests and other heated current events.  \n176.  For work, among other things, Plaintiff Edrei’s shoots live concerts. \n177.  Plaintiff Edrei’s must now bring additional ear protection when covering live \nconcerts. \n178.  Even with additional ear protection, Plaintiff Edrei experiences pain and \nsensitivity while carrying out these job duties.  \n  27 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 28 of 50\n179.  The season before December 5, 2014, Plaintiff Edrei had been photographing \nprotests regularly, including two BlackLivesMatter protests and a few climate-related protests. \n180.  After being exposed to the LRAD and the ensuing pain, ringing, and sensitivity, \nPlaintiff Edrei has not felt able to cover protests.   \n181.  Plaintiff Edrei attempted to take photographs at one protest after December 5, \n2014, and had to leave early due to the emotional and physical effects of this incident. \n182.  Plaintiff Edrei is afraid to go to protests, and has not been able to cover a protest \nsince December 5, 2014, out of fear that Plaintiff Edrei will be exposed to an LRAD and will \nsuffer further confusion, headaches, ear pain, and hearing damage.  \nSHAY HORSE \n183.  On December 5, 2014, Plaintiff SHAY HORSE was a twenty-one-year-old \nworking as a freelance photojournalist. \n184.  Plaintiff Horse still works as a freelance photojournalist.   \n185.  Plaintiff Horse’s photographs have appeared in Al Jazeera and Russia Today, in \naddition to other media outlets.   \n186.  Plaintiff Horse has travelled around the United States and to other countries to \ndocument protests and other newsworthy events. \n187.  On the evening of December 4, 2015, Plaintiff Horse went to where he believed \nthere would be protests in response to a Staten Island grand jury’s failure to indict the police \nofficer involved in the death of Eric Garner.  \n188.  Plaintiff Horse attended the protests in order to document aspects of the protests \nand police response to them, as part of his photojournalism work, and in order to pitch \nphotographs to magazines, newspapers, and other outlets, in the name of gathering and \n  28 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 29 of 50\npublishing newsworthy information and so that the photographs could be published and in \nfurtherance of his career goals. \n189.  Plaintiff Horse followed protests around the streets of Manhattan for several \nhours.  \n190.  The protesters were escorted and accompanied by NYPD officers for those \nseveral hours.  \n191.  At around or after 1 a.m., Plaintiff Horse was attempting to walk near protesters \nwest on 58th Street when Plaintiff Horse observed NYPD officers blocking protesters from \ncontinuing westward by forming a police line stretching across the street and sidewalks. \n192.  Unable to proceed westward on 58th Street, some protesters proceeded south on \n7th Avenue, and turned east on 57th Street. \n193.  At some time between around 1:10 and 1:15 a.m. or after, Plaintiff Horse \nobserved protesters proceed on 57th Street and attempt to cross the intersection of 57th Street and \nMadison Avenue.  \n194.  Plaintiff Horse then observed police officers violently arrest several people. \n195.  Plaintiff Horse saw the officers with their batons out and swinging. \n196.  Plaintiff Horse saw some people move toward the officers who were arresting \npeople, and then saw the officers make additional arrests.   \n197.  Plaintiff Horse saw police officers discharge pepper spray towards the crowd.  \n198.  Plaintiff Horse saw what he believed to be glass bottles thrown toward where the \npolice were arresting people.  \n199.  At that point, Plaintiff Horse was about four feet away from the people being \narrested, and was trying to take photographs.  \n  29 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 30 of 50\n200.  Plaintiff Horse was careful to position himself so that he would not be interfering \nwith the officers. \n201.  Plaintiff Horse then heard the police yell in sum and substance for everyone to get \non the sidewalk.  \n202.  Plaintiff Horse then heard the sound of an LRAD being activated. \n203.  Plaintiff Horse did not hear a dispersal order from the police. \n204.  Plaintiff Horse did not hear any warning that the LRAD would be used.   \n205.  Plaintiff Horse then heard the LRAD repeatedly fire its “deterrent” tone.  \n206.  Plaintiff Horse tried to get away from the LRAD quickly, by moving away from \nthe police.  \n207.  Plaintiff Horse heard police officers use the LRAD to broadcast messages, \nincluding to get on the sidewalk, as he was moving away from them.  \n208.  At the same time as the officers used the LRAD to broadcast many of those \nmessages, they were also firing its “deterrent” tone.  \n209.  Plaintiff Horse got on the sidewalk and continued to move away from the officers. \n210.  Plaintiff Horse turned around and saw Defendants Maguire and JD#2 walking \nbehind him and others who were fleeing from the police firing the LRAD. \n211.   Plaintiff Horse saw Defendants Maguire and JD#2 holding the LRAD between \nthe two of them, firing it, apparently indiscriminately, as people were fleeing from the police \nfiring the LRAD.  \n212.  At that point, Plaintiff Horse was on the sidewalk near Plaintiff Edrei and others. \n213.  Plaintiff Horse was upset that the police were using the LRAD against people \nwho were trying to get away, and from such a close distance.  \n  30 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 31 of 50\n214.  Plaintiff Horse yelled a critical comment at the officers holding the LRAD, and \nstepped briefly off the curb to take a picture of them, and then returned to the sidewalk. \n215.  After yelling at Defendants Maguire and JD#2, Plaintiff Horse then saw these two \nofficers turn toward him, and fire the LRAD while pointing it at him, although he had all \ncomplied with orders and were on the sidewalk.  \n216.  Plaintiff Horse ran down the sidewalk away from the officers, and saw \nDefendants Maguire and JD#2 continue to direct the LRAD at him and Plaintiff Edrei and others \nwhile firing its “deterrent” tone.   \n217.  Plaintiff Horse was eventually able to leave the area where the officers were firing \nthe LRAD. \n218.  While the LRAD was directed at him, Plaintiff Horse’s eardrums were beating \nhard and it was incredibly painful.   \n219.  Plaintiff Horse felt as though he were bleeding out of his nose, ears, and mouth.  \n220.  Plaintiff Horse repeatedly asked others around him if he was actually bleeding.  \n221.  Plaintiff Horse got a migraine headache, and his sinuses, nose, throat, and ears all \nfelt as though they were on fire.   \n222.  The side of Plaintiff Horse’s body that was hit by the LRAD felt numb.    \n223.  The next day and for at least the following five days, Plaintiff Horse’s migraine \nheadache and the sensation that he was bleeding out of his ears and nose continued.  \n224.  Plaintiff Horse heard ringing in his ears and white noise, even when he was in \nsilent places.  \n225.  On December 9, 2014, Plaintiff Horse went to an Urgent Care facility to seek \nmedical assistance because he was still experiencing ringing and extreme pain in his ears.   \n  31 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 32 of 50\n226.  Plaintiff Horse complained of nausea, pain and ringing in his ears, and dizziness.  \n227.  Plaintiff Horse was diagnosed with “Tinnitus, bilateral” and “vertigo” and \nprescribed Meclizine. \n228.  Plaintiff Horse was referred to an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist, but did not \npursue the referral, including because he was uninsured and thought he could not afford \nspecialist care. \n229.  Plaintiff Horse still experiences ringing in his ears sometimes to this date. \n230.  Plaintiff Horse still experiences dizzy spells as often as once or twice a week. \n231.  Plaintiff Horse is very worried about the long-term effects of his December 5, \n2014 exposure to the LRAD on his hearing, and about his ability to continue to work as a \nphotojournalist who covers protests and conflict situations.   \n232.  Plaintiff Horse is very worried that as he continues to cover protests in New York \nCity as a photojournalist, the police will use the LRAD against him again and it will result in a \npermanent and significant impact on his hearing.  \n233.  Plaintiff Horse has covered protests since December 5, 2014 as a photojournalist.  \n234.  Plaintiff Horse intends to continue documenting protests and conflicts because it \nis his career and his life passion.  \n235.  However, his experiences on December 5, 2014 continue to harm his work as a \nphotojournalist in those contexts because he is now more nervous and cautious and less able to \nget the newsworthy shots he seeks. \nJAMES CRAVEN \n236.  On December 4, 2014, Plaintiff Craven was a twenty-seven year-old full-time \nstudent pursuing his Master of Science in Information Systems from Baruch College. \n  32 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 33 of 50\n237.  Plaintiff Craven works as an Information Technology consultant. \n238.  On December 4, 2014, Plaintiff Craven learned that there would be a large protest \nin Manhattan related to a Staten Island grand jury’s failure to indict the police officer involved in \nthe death of Eric Garner.   \n239.  Plaintiff Craven wanted to join others who were also outraged. \n240.  Plaintiff Craven also intended to document the protests and police responses \nthereto with a view toward potentially publishing newsworthy information. \n241.  At around 10:30 pm, Plaintiff Craven joined the march by riding nearby on his \nbicycle in the street, filming some of the events with a GoPro camera that was attached to his \nbicycle helmet. \n242.  Footage of the incident Plaintiff posted on YouTube has garnered almost 80,000 \nhits. \n243.  Mr. Craven spent most of the next few hours after 10:30 p.m. riding his bicycle in \nthe street. \n244.  The protesters were escorted and accompanied by NYPD officers for those \nseveral hours. \n245.  During that time period, Plaintiff Craven did not observe any noteworthy arrests.  \n246.  On or around 1 a.m. on December 5, 2014, Plaintiff Craven was near the back of \nthe march as it proceeded east on 57th Street towards Madison Avenue.  \n247.  At around 57th Street and Madison Avenue, Plaintiff Craven saw people gathering \naround the police making arrests to observe them.  \n248.  Near the scene of the arrests, Plaintiff Craven saw what he thought were bottles in \nthe air near the arrest scene.   \n  33 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 34 of 50\n249.  Plaintiff Craven did not see anyone hit or injured.  \n250.  Less than ten seconds later, Plaintiff Craven heard the LRAD “deterrent” tone.   \n251.  There was no warning that the LRAD would be used. \n252.  The LRAD produced one of the loudest noises he had ever heard. \n253.  Plaintiff Craven felt like he was inches from a car alarm going off. \n254.  Plaintiff Craven continued bicycling east towards Park Avenue.  \n255.  Plaintiff Craven heard what seemed to be orders from the police officers over the \nLRAD as well, but could not hear what they were, as they were given at the same time as the \n“deterrent” tone was being fired.  \n256.  Plaintiff Craven saw other people fleeing east on 57th Street to get away from the \npolice using the LRAD. \n257.  Defendants Maguire and JD#2 fired the LRAD’s “deterrent” tone repeatedly over \nthe course of almost three minutes on 57th Street between Madison and Park Avenues. \n258.  Plaintiff Craven continued bicycling near marchers for about 40 minutes, and then \nreturned to his home for the night.  \n259.  The next day, Plaintiff Craven suffered severe pain and ringing in both ears.   \n260.  This pain intensified when Plaintiff Craven encountered any loud sounds.  \n261.  This pain, sensitivity, and ringing continued for at least six days.  \n262.  The pain made bicycling around New York City, Plaintiff Craven’s usual mode of \ntransportation, difficult. \n263.  Within a week, because of the pain, ringing, and sensitivity in his ears, Plaintiff \nCraven sought medical treatment from the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. \n  34 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 35 of 50\n264.  Plaintiff Craven later sought treatment from his General Practitioner, who in turn \nreferred him to an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist.  \n265.  Plaintiff Craven saw an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist in early 2015 because he \nwas experiencing ringing in his ears. \n266.  Plaintiff Craven was deterred from attending protests for several months after \nDecember 5, 2014. \n267.  Plaintiff Craven remains nervous about attending future protests.   \n268.  Plaintiff Craven has only been to one protest since December 5, 2014.  \n269.  After the incident, Plaintiff Craven put earplugs on his keychain so that he could \nhave them ready to hand in case police use the LRAD again at or near him. \n270.  Plaintiff Craven worries that he will not have time to put earplugs in before \nanother LRAD is fired at or near him.  \nKEEGAN STEPHAN \n271.  Plaintiff KEEGAN STEPHAN is a long-time activist, and has been involved with \npolitical protests his entire adult life.  \n272.  Prior to December 4, 2014, Plaintiff Stephan had been to nearly every protest \nrelated to the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown in New York City. \n273.  Plaintiff Stephan joined the December 4, 2014 protests at around 4-5 p.m. in \nUnion Square. \n274.  Plaintiff Stephan attended the protest intending to observe and document the \nprotests and police response thereto with a view toward publishing newsworthy images, video, \nand/or commentary.  \n  35 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 36 of 50\n275.  At the time, Plaintiff Stephan regularly attended protests, taking and posting \nphotos and videos to his social media accounts. \n276.  On many occasions prior to December 4, 2014, mainstream media outlets had re-\nbroadcasted images and videos posted by Plaintiff Stephan. \n277.  For example, Plaintiff Stephan’s posts had been used in coverage of protests by \nThe New York Times, Newsweek, Newsday, Telesur, New York Magazine, and PBS. \n278.  On December 4, 2014, Plaintiff Stephan intended to take and broadcast photos \nand/or videos of the protests and police responses to his substantial social media following, with \na view toward republishing some of the images and videos, and/or commentary, including to \nmainstream media outlets. \n279.  Indeed, Plaintiff Stephan’s images, videos, and commentary from December 4 \nand 5, 2014, were used in stories on Buzzfeed, The Village Voice, and The Epoch Times. See \nSeveral Arrested During Second Night of Protests After Eric Garner Decision, BUZZFEED NEWS, \nDecember 4, 2014, available at http://www.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeednews/protesters-take-to-new-\nyork-city-again#.psLoDJvPK (last accessed March 3, 2016); Katie Toth, The NYPD’s Moment of \nRestraint is Over: 200+ Arrested, THE VILLAGE VOICE, December 5, 2014, available at \nhttp://www.villagevoice.com/news/the-nypds-moment-of-restraint-is-over-200-arrested-6674835 \n(last accessed March 3, 2016); Reid Schram, Eric Garner Decision Fuels Protests Across New \nYork, THE EPOCH TIMES, December 4, 2014, available at \nhttp://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1123416-eric-garner-decision-fuels-protests-across-new-\nyork-liveblog/ (last accessed March 3, 2016). \n  36 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 37 of 50\n280.  Since December 5, 2014, photos, videos, and/or commentary from Plaintiff \nStephan’s posts have been republished and/or used by Pix 11, WNYC, MTV, CBS, International \nBusiness Times, The Washington Post, AMNY, Telesure, Mic News, and The Huffington Post.  \n281.  Several articles specifically acknowledge how Plaintiff Stephan’s work as a \n“livetweeter” has influenced mainstream media. See, e.g., Mark Chiusano, Video is shaping \n#BlackLivesMatter Protests in New York City, AMNEWYORK, December 17, 2015, available at \nhttp://www.amny.com/opinion/columnists/mark-chiusano/video-is-shaping-blacklivesmatter-\nprotests-in-new-york-city-1.11237109 (last accessed March 3, 2016); Amber van Moessner, \nWhat Everyone Should Know About Filming (and Sharing) Injustice on Social Media, MIC \nNEWS, available at http://mic.com/articles/136154/what-everyone-should-know-about-filming-\nand-sharing-injustice-on-social-media#.7u0TRqIno (last accessed March 3, 2016) \n282.  Plaintiff Stephan has also  been quoted as an expert on protest and police in \nseveral sources, and has written pieces for Gothamist, US Uncut, Alternet, and PINAC News \nregularly since December 4, 2014. \n283.  On the night of December 4, 2014, Plaintiff Stephan proceeded near protesters for \nseveral hours. \n284.  Around or after 1 a.m., as a group of protesters neared 57th Street and Madison \nAvenue, Plaintiff Stephan saw a person with his face down, and at least three police officers on \ntop of him, as at least one officer pressed his knee into the arrestees’ back while apparently \ncuffing him.  \n285.  Plaintiff Stephan saw others gather at the scene to observe the police. \n286.  Plaintiff Stephan did not see people gathered in a way that appeared to interfere \nwith or threaten to interfere with their arrest. \n  37 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 38 of 50\n287.  Plaintiff Stephan then saw a police officer walk over and discharge what he \nbelieved to be pepper spray toward the people who were watching the arrest.  \n288.  Plaintiff Stephan smelled pepper spray and his eyes began burning.  \n289.  Plaintiff Stephan felt sinus pain, itching and burning.    \n290.  Plaintiff Stephan heard no warning before the pepper spray was deployed.   \n291.  Plaintiff Stephan then ran from the scene of the arrests and onto the sidewalk.   \n292.  As Plaintiff Stephan reached the sidewalk, he heard what he believed to be the \n“deterrent” tone of a LRAD.  \n293.  Plaintiff Stephan had no warning before the police began firing the LRAD. \n294.  Plaintiff Stephan moved on 57th Street between Madison and Park as the NYPD \nfired the “deterrent” tone of a LRAD for nearly three minutes. \n295.  Plaintiff Stephan was shocked that the police were using the LRAD, and that they \nwere using its “deterrent” tone rather than its announcement feature.  \n296.  Plaintiff Stephan was particularly surprised because when it was used most people \nhad already responded to the pepper spray by fleeing. \n297.  Plaintiff Stephan felt reverberation and pain while the LRAD was being used.  \n298.  The reverberation went beyond Plaintiff Stephan’s eardrums, going down his ear \ncanal.  \n299.  This was the most traumatic ear pain Plaintiff Stephan has ever experienced.  \n300.  Plaintiff Stephan could not sleep that night, due to the intense ringing and pain in \nhis ears. \n301.  Video that Mr. Stephan took of the LRAD being used on December 5, 2014 was \nsubsequently published by Vice Motherboard. See Alex Pasternack, The New Sound of Crowd \n  38 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 39 of 50\nControl, MOTHERBOARD, December 17, 2014, available at http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-\nnew-sound-of-crowd-control (last visited March 2, 2016). \n302.   After the events of December 5, 2014, when Plaintiff Stephan considers going to \na protest, the pain and fear that the use of the LRAD caused him resurfaces. \n303.  Plaintiff Stephan has considered not going to protests because of this acute pain \nand fear. \n304.  However, Plaintiff Stefan has chosen to fight through his fears and continue to \nattend and report on protests, in part because he believes both activities are so important. \n305.  Plaintiff Stephan was and remains afraid of being exposed to the LRAD again and \nof experiencing permanent hearing damage.   \nPLAINTIFF NUSBAUM \n306.  On December 5, 2014, Plaintiff MICHAEL NUSBUM was a twenty-five-year-old \nworking as a freelance photographer. \n307.  Plaintiff Nusbaum is now a freelance filmmaker and photographer, with a \nBachelor of Science Degree in Film and Television from Boston University. \n308.  On December 5, 2014, Plaintiff Nusbaum was working as a filmmaker to create a \nhistorical documentation of an emerging protest movement, including through film, one aspect of \nwhich was ultimately published as “This Ain’t a Parade” on Vimeo, available at \nhttps://vimeo.com/113821448 (last accessed March 2, 2016) - with the description: “The protest \nmovement in this video is in response to what many see as a failure of the justice system in the \nUnited States: the grand jury decisions not to indict police officers who killed Eric Garner, \nMichael Brown, and others.” \n  39 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 40 of 50\n309.  Plaintiff Nusbaum had a history of tinnitus and hearing loss, and had seen \nmultiple doctors about his hearing conditions prior to December 5, 2014.   \n310.  Plaintiff Nusbaum is particularly vulnerable to loud sounds and to further hearing \ndamage. \n311.  On the night of December 4, 2014, Plaintiff Nusbaum joined with the protests of \nthe non-indictment of the officer involved in Eric Garner’s death.   \n312.  Plaintiff Nusbaum was at the protest both as a filmmaker and as a protester.  \n313.  Plaintiff Nusbaum marched with others for several hours.  \n314.  At some time after 1 a.m. on December 5, 2014, Plaintiff Nusbaum saw people \ngather around the scene of some arrests near 57th Street and Madison Avenue. \n315.  Plaintiff Nusbaum heard something that sounded like a glass bottle breaking. \n316.  Plaintiff Nusbaum then heard someone say that they had been pepper sprayed.  \n317.  At this point, Plaintiff Nusbaum heard what he now believes was the “deterrent” \ntone of a LRAD. \n318.  After Plaintiff Nusbaum heard the LRAD fire, he saw people fleeing from it.  \n319.  Plaintiff Nusbaum heard the LRAD broadcast a message saying in substance that \n“This is the New York City Police Department, you must remain on the sidewalk.” \n320.  Plaintiff Nusbaum heard parts of this message broadcast repeatedly, apparently \ndirected at him and other people who were already on the sidewalk. \n321.  The LRAD was approximately 15 feet away from the closest protesters and from \nPlaintiff Nusbaum. \n  40 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 41 of 50\n322.  Plaintiff Nusbaum had earplugs in his backpack, which he carries with him \nbecause his hearing issues mean that it is very dangerous and painful for him to be exposed to \nloud sounds.  \n323.  Plaintiff Nusbaum put in his earplugs and began filming to document the LRAD \nuse.  \n324.  Plaintiff Nusbaum began filming approximately 30 seconds after he first heard the \nLRAD being used, and continued filming for approximately two and a half minutes, during \nwhich time the LRAD and its deterrent function were used almost continuously.  \n325.  However, because there was no warning or indication that the LRAD would be \nused, his ears were exposed to sounds at volume levels and proximities that are very dangerous \nand deleterious because of his pre-existing hearing condition.  \n326.  “This Ain’t a Parade” (https://vimeo.com/113821448 (last accessed March 2, \n2016)) is the published product of the filmmaking project Plaintiff Nusbaum was working on \nwhen he was assaulted with the LRAD. \n327.  When the LRAD’s “deterrent” tone was first used near plaintiff Nusbaum, he \nexperienced what he would describe as a 10 out of 10 pain in his ears.  \n328.  Plaintiff Nusbaum has had to get an MRI test for his hearing before, and this was \nlouder than being in an MRI machine.  \n329.  Because of his fear that he will be hit by an LRAD and injured again, Mr. \nNusbaum has attended many fewer protests since December 5, 2014. \n330.  Plaintiff Nusbaum works as a photographer at music concerts, and the sound of \nthe LRAD was much louder and more painful than anything he had ever heard before. \n  41 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 42 of 50\n331.  Since December 5, 2014, the ringing in Plaintiff Nusbaum’s right ear that he had \nexperienced has been much more noticeable, and he hears a slight ringing at all times. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUNREASONABLE SEIZURE – EXCESSIVE FORCE \nFOURTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS THROUGH 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n332.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding and \nfollowing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n333.  Defendants Maguire and JD#2 terminated or severely limited Plaintiffs’ freedom \nof movement utilizing the LRAD. \n334.  Defendants seized Plaintiffs without privilege or lawful justification.  \n335.  Defendants had no judicial warrant authorizing Plaintiffs’ seizure. \n336.  Plaintiffs were conscious of the confinements and did not consent to them. \n337.  Defendants used force against Plaintiffs by deploying the LRAD against them. \n338.  Defendants did not have lawful cause to detain or arrest Plaintiffs, nor was it \nobjectively reasonable for Defendants to believe that they did have such cause to detain or arrest \nPlaintiffs.  \n339.  The levels of force employed by Defendants Maguire and JD#2 in using the \nLRAD, and in particular in using its “deterrent” tone without prior warning, unreasonably close \nto people, for unreasonably long periods of time, were objectively unreasonable. \n340.  As seizures of and uses of force against Plaintiffs, the NYPD’s uses of the LRAD \nwere unjustified and unreasonable under the circumstances.  \n341.  The LRAD was used as a weapon without reasonable notice and without \nproviding a meaningful opportunity to disperse beyond the range of the LRAD and therefore \navoid injury.  \n  42 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 43 of 50\n342.  The LRAD was used in circumstances where there was no imminent threat to \npublic safety or property and/or where its use was not necessary to protect public safety or \nproperty.  \n343.  Defendants’ uses of the LRAD were not only in contravention of best practices \nregarding crowd control and use of force, but also in violation of the NYPD’s use of force \nrequirements that “All members of the service at the scene of a police incident must:…(b) use \nminimal necessary force,” as reflected in the relevant provisions of the NYPD’s Patrol Guide, \nSection 203-11, that was in effect at all times relevant herein (emphasis in original). \n344.  Because the LRAD is designed to target large areas, it necessarily targets more \nthan one person, if more than one person is within that area.  \n345.  When the LRAD is implemented to force behavior modification or compliance \n(for example, to compel people to stop moving in a direction or to move in a particular \ndirection), it impacts their ability to move freely. \n346.  Put more simply, use of the LRAD as a weapon seizes not just one individual, but \nall people in an area, and in so doing does away with the requirements of individualized probable \ncause and individualized justifications for appropriate and proportionate use of force. \n347.  As a result of the acts and omissions complained of herein, Plaintiffs suffered the \ninjuries and deprivations of their constitutional and common law rights discussed herein. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nVIOLATIONS OF PLAINTIFFS’ FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS \nFIRST AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS THROUGH 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n348.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding and \nfollowing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n  43 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 44 of 50\n349.  Defendants engaged in the acts and omissions complained of herein in retaliation \nfor Plaintiffs’ protected conduct and/or speech, including their protected conduct and/or speech \nin being near, participating in, or observing and/or documenting protests and police responses to \nthem. \n350.  Defendants engaged in the acts and omissions complained of herein in order to \nprevent Plaintiffs from continuing to engage in such protected conduct. \n351.  Defendants engaged in the acts and omissions complained of herein in order to \nprevent and/or discourage Plaintiffs from engaging in similar protected conduct in the future. \n352.  Each Plaintiff suffered actual chill in that each Plaintiff was prevented and /or \ndeterred from or impeded in participating in protected conduct on the date of and after the \nincident. \n353.  In addition to being retaliatory, the restrictions imposed by Defendants Maguire \nand JD#2 on Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights complained of herein were: \na.  Not content-neutral and lacked narrowly tailored to promote a compelling \ngovernment interest; and/or \nb.  Content-neutral, but lacked narrow tailoring to serve a significant \ngovernmental interest and/or failed to provide ample alternatives for \nexpression; and/or \nc.  Afforded Defendants unbridled discretion to limit or deny Plaintiffs’ abilities \nto engage in protected conduct (also raising constitutionally significant \nvagueness and overbreadth concerns). \n354.  The uses of force and other regulations imposed on Plaintiffs by Defendants \nMaguire and JD#2 interfered with Plaintiffs’ rights to speech, expression, assembly, and/or to \n  44 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 45 of 50\nengage in observing and/or documenting newsworthy events including, but not limited to, \nprotests against police brutality and police responses to them. \n355.  With respect to those Plaintiffs who intended to observe and document with a \nview toward disseminating documentation of protests and/or police responses thereto and/or \notherwise newsworthy images, video, sounds, and/or commentary, those uses of force and other \nregulations prevented such Plaintiffs from engaging in the “gathering” of such images, video, \nsounds, and/or commentary, which is a necessary and protected prerequisite to the protected \ndissemination those Plaintiffs ultimately intended to engage in. \n356.  Even assuming, arguendo, that the physical regulations on freedom of movement \nimposed on Plaintiffs when they were fired on by the LRAD were content neutral, absent a very \nsmall subset of extremely exigent circumstances, the use of an LRAD for crowd control purposes \nwill almost always result in overbroad or over-inclusive regulation of protected conduct, because \nthe restrictions imposed by the haphazard applications of the LRAD’s force are almost always \nnot narrowly tailored to serve significant governmental interests, and almost always fail to \nprovide ample alternatives for expression.  \n357.  Additionally, the NYPD’s practices with respect to LRAD uses  - including the \nlack of (1) written guidelines and policies, (2) appropriate training regarding LRAD use, and (3) \nbasic use of LRAD force reporting requirements - fail to provide adequate safeguards to prevent \nNYPD officers on the streets from enjoying and exercising unbridled, unreviewable discretion to \nsuppress protected speech and conduct, thus violating constitutional prohibitions against \nviewpoint discrimination and other, related guarantees.  \n358.  As a result of the acts and omissions complained of herein, Plaintiffs suffered the \ninjuries and deprivations of their constitutional and common law rights discussed herein. \n  45 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 1   Filed 03/03/16   Page 46 of 50\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nVIOLATIONS OF PLAINTIFFS’ RIGHTS TO EQUAL PROTECTION AND \nSUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS \nFOURTEENTH AMENDMENT THROUGH 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n359.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding and \nfollowing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n360.

COHEN, as and for their First Amended Complaint in this matter, do \nhereby state and allege: \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  On December 4 and 5, 2014, Plaintiffs were each participating in, observing, or \notherwise documenting protests and police responses in the wake of the Staten Island grand \njury’s decision not to indict New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) Officer Daniel \nPantaleo in connection with the death of Eric Garner when Defendants NYPD LIEUTENANT \nJOHN MAGUIRE and NYPD OFFICER MIKE POLETTO, Shield No. 3762 - officers from \nwhat was then called the NYPD’s Disorder Control Unit (“DCU”) – injured them by firing an \nLRAD Corporation-manufactured 100X Model Long Range Acoustic Device (“LRAD”) in the \nvicinity of 57th Street around Madison Avenue and in nearby New York City streets.  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 2 of 66\n2.  This is a combined civil rights and New York State law action brought to \nvindicate Plaintiffs’ rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the \nConstitution of the United States, through the Civil Rights Act of 1871, as amended, codified as \n42 U.S.C. § 1983, the attendant provisions of the New York State Constitution, including, but \nnot limited to, Article I, §§ 8, 9, 11 and 12 thereof, and New York State common laws. Plaintiffs \nseek also seek declaratory and injunctive relief related to NYPD LRAD uses. Plaintiffs also seek \nan award of compensatory and punitive damages as well as attorneys’ fees. \n3.  LRADs of the sort at issue in this lawsuit were first developed as a sound weapon \ndesigned for military applications in the wake of the 2000 attack on the USS Cole in Yemen.  \n4.  An LRAD is more a sound weapon than a traditional loudspeaker or megaphone. \nA traditional loudspeaker or megaphone, including the familiar police megaphone typically used \nby the NYPD in connection with crowd control, amplifies sound by use of a diaphragm. In \ncontrast, the LRAD technology uses piezoelectric transducers to concentrate - and direct - \nacoustic energy. \n5.  According to a Product Guide provided by the self-described “global leader in \nlong range acoustic hailing devices,” LRAD Corporation, “the Long Range Acoustic Device® \n(LRAD) produces a concentrated 30 [degree] beam of sound to broadcast highly intelligible \nvoice messages (live or pre-recorded) and powerful alarm tones over large distances.”  \n6.  According to an Amnesty International report issued in 2014: \nLRADs emit high volume sounds at various frequencies, with some ability to \ntarget the sound to particular areas. Used at close range, loud volume and/or \nexcessive lengths of time, LRADs can pose serious health risks which range from \ntemporary pain, loss of balance and eardrum rupture, to permanent hearing \n  2 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 3 of 66\ndamage. LRADs also target people relatively indiscriminately, and can have \nmarkedly different effects on different individuals and in different environments.1 \n \n7.  According to the NYPD’s own DCU in January of 2010: \nSound travels in waves, and generally spreads in all directions from a source, in \nthe form of a wave front…. The LRAD…focuses the sound waves in a specific \ndirection. While the sound being emitted from in front of the LRAD may be very \nloud, it is substantially quieter outside the “cone” of sound produced by the \ndevice. In fact, someone could stand next to the device or just behind it and hear \nthe noise being emitted at much lower levels than someone standing several \nhundred feet away, but within the “cone” of sound being emitted. 2 \n \n8.  According to the manufacturer, in ideal conditions, sound amplified by the LRAD \nis directed in a 30-to-45-degree, cone-shaped beam emitting from the front of the LRAD.3  \n9.  LRADs are immensely loud: As an “emergency mass notification” solution, the \nmanufacturer’s materials boast that “LRAD systems blow away bullhorns by being 20-35 dB \nlouder and allowing law enforcement personnel to quickly communicate instructions and \ndirections to large groups. LRAD can be heard clearly through buildings or moving vehicles…”4  \n10.  Also according to the manufacturer, “LRAD broadcasts have been optimized to \nthe 1 – 5 kHz range where human hearing is most sensitive.”5   \n11.  According to the DCU: \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n1   “On the Streets of America: Human Rights Abuses in Ferguson,” AMNESTY \nINTERNATIONAL REPORT, October 24, 2014, available at \nhttp://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/on-the-streets-of-america-human-rights-abuses-in-\nferguson?page=show (“Amnesty International Ferguson Report”) (last accessed March 2, 2016).  \n2   See January 2010 NYPD Special Operations Division Disorder Control Unit “Briefing on \nthe LRAD (Long Range Acoustical Device)” (“DCU LRAD Briefing”) at p. 3. A true copy of \nthe DCU LRAD Briefing is annexed hereto as Exhibit A. \n3   See, e.g., LRAD 100X Datasheet; description of LRAD 100X on LRAD Corporations \nwebsite, available at http://www.lradx.com/site/content/view/207/110/ (last accessed December \n2014).  \n4   Id.  \n5   Roger Cook, “LRAD Bridges the Communication Gap in Civil Emergency Situations,” \nLRAD CORPORATION WHITE PAPER  (May 2011), at p. 3.  \n  3 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 4 of 66\nAlthough it can be thought of as a ‘loudspeaker’, [the LRAD] actually works \ndifferently and may also be used as an ‘area denial’ device for crowd control \nmanagement purposes. . . . In addition to having “loudspeaker” capabilities, the \ndevice can also be used, in a special mode, to propel piercing sound at higher \nlevels (as measured in decibels) than are considered safe to human ears. In this \ndangerous range (above 120 decibels), the device can cause damage to someone’s \nhearing and may be painful. It is this technology that device was designed for a \nUSS Cole attack-type scenario. If mounted aboard a Navy ship, the device’s \nloudspeaker could be used to “warn off” boats that come too close. If those \nwarnings are ignored, the device could be used to send out sound at a dangerously \nhigh level causing attackers to turn away, or at least, to cause pain/hearing \ndamage to try to repel the attack.6  \n \n12.  According to one of the manufacturer’s statements in marketing the LRAD as a \ncrowd control device to law enforcement:  \nWhen LRAD’s deterrent tone is used at close range, protesters sense audible \ndiscomfort, cover their ears and move away. Just the act of covering ears with \nhands reduces the sound pressure level (SPL) by approximately 25dB and could \nprevent protestors from throwing projectiles. LRAD can be quickly modulated in \nresponse to protesters actions by controlling the audio output through a \nprominently positioned volume control knob. Law enforcement agencies with \nconcerns about the deterrent tone and [sic] can easily disable this option.”7 \n \n13.  The same marketing document employs the below diagram to illustrate an LRAD \nblasting waves of “intense communication” over a 2-3 block area of Times Square, and “clear \ncommunication” from around 41st Street to beyond 54th Street: \n \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n6   See DCU LRAD Briefing at p. 2.  \n7   “Law Enforcement Solutions: Saving Lives Through Clear Communication,” LRAD \nCORPORATION (Jan. 8, 2014).  \n  4 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 5 of 66\n14.  As seen below, on December 5, 2014, Defendants Maguire and Poletto utilized \nthe LRAD as a weapon against Plaintiffs and others by operating it as if it were a megaphone at \nunsafe distances and volumes, and by repeatedly firing its so-called “deterrent” tone at unsafe \ndistances and volumes from distances as close as, or closer than, a car width away from Plaintiffs \nand others targeted or caught in its beam.  \n15.  Those gratuitous and unlawful uses of force and authority against Plaintiffs \nphysically controlled Plaintiffs’ movements and also caused Plaintiffs to endure physical and \nother injuries, including deprivations of their rights to free speech, assembly, expression, and to \ngather and disseminate information freely, as well as their free press rights. \n16.  Additionally, Defendants City and Bratton failed properly to train and/or \nsupervise Defendants Maguire and Poletto in connection with deploying and using the LRAD. \n17.  Beyond that, although Defendants City and Bratton knew specifically that \nPlaintiffs had been injured by Defendants as early as December of 2014, they ratified and \nendorsed Defendants’ conduct. \n18.  Further, since learning of Plaintiffs’ injuries, Defendants City and Bratton have \nfailed to develop policies and practices governing the safe use of LRADs and failed to train and \nsupervise NYPD officers in the use of LRADs.  \n19.  On December 12, 2014, within days of the December 5, 2014 LRAD firings that \ninjured Plaintiffs, counsel wrote Defendant Bratton a nine-page letter along with a request under \nthe Freedom of Information Law, a true copy of which is annexed hereto as Exhibit B, including \ndetailed complaints about the December 5, 2014 LRAD uses, and calling on Defendant Bratton \nto direct officers under his command  \nto refrain from using the LRAD for crowd control purposes until thorough, \nindependent testing and review has been conducted; appropriate, written \n  5 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 6 of 66\nguidelines regarding the use of LRADs, including their use as force tools and their \nuse for crowd control purposes, are promulgated and made public; members of \nthe service authorized to operate LRADs are adequately trained in them; and there \nare adequate use of force reporting requirements in place to document the \ncircumstances under which the Department’s LRADs are utilized.  \n \n20.  Defendant Bratton did not respond to the letter directly.  \n \n21.  However, as reported by Colin Moynihan in The New York Times on December \n12, 2014,  \nA spokesman for the Police Department said that officer training in the use of the \ndevices addresses intensity of sound, duration and distance. ‘On December 4th all \nof these factors were controlled at levels that are not considered dangerous or \nharmful,’ the spokesman said, adding that the device has only been used to advise \npeople of illegal conduct.8 \n \n22.  To the contrary, as seen below, the LRAD was used for pain compliance and \nother purposes against Plaintiffs on December 5, 2014.  \n23.  Additionally, Defendants Maguire and Poletto used the LRAD to seize Plaintiffs \nand assault them with unreasonably loud sound waves from unreasonably close distances and/or \nfor unreasonably long periods of time. \n24.  Defendants Maguire and Poletto fired the LRAD almost continuously while \ndirecting its area of effect cone at Plaintiffs within ten feet, even turning to angle the cone toward \nPlaintiffs and others who were only a car width away.  \n25.  By way of further example, the image below shows the “LRAD 100X Operation \nZones” as depicted on the back of an LRAD 100X, including a red “beam” graphic extending in \na 30’ cone from the front of the LRAD labeled “DO NOT ENTER WITHIN 10 METERS \nDURING CONTINUOUS OPERATION” and a yellow graphic indicating an approximately \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n8   Colin Moynihan, Concerns Raised Over Shrill Device New York Police Used During \nGarner Protests, NEW YORK TIMES, December 12, 2014, available at \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/13/nyregion/lawyers-raise-concerns-over-shrill-device-used-\nby-police-during-garner-protests.html (last visited March 3, 2016). \n  6 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 7 of 66\nthree-foot area around the LRAD in which persons are cautioned not to enter “without hearing \nprotection.”  \n \n \n26.  Thus, as seen below, Defendants Maguire and Poletto not only violated Plaintiffs’ \nrights and injured them – Defendants Bratton and City are also liable for those violations and \ninjuries, including because Defendant Bratton ratified Defendants’ Maguire’s and Poletto’s \nmisconduct. \n27.  In March of 2016, Physicians for Human Rights (“PHR”) and the International \nNetwork of Civil Liberties Organizations (“INCLO”) – a group of “11 independent, national \nhuman right organisations working to promote fundamental rights and freedoms by supporting \nand mutually reinforcing the work of the member organisations working in their respective \ncountries” including “the American Civil Liberties Union” and organizations from Canada, \nArgentina, Egypt, India, Ireland, and other countries – published “Lethal in Disguise: The Health \nConsequences of Crowd-Control Weapons”9, including a chapter on “acoustic weapons” \nfocusing on LRADs, at pp. 71-77.  \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n9\t\r  \t\r   “Lethal in Disguise: The Health Consequences of Crowd-Control Weapons,” PHYSICIANS \nFOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE INTERNATIONAL NETWORK OF CIVIL LIBERTIES ORGANIZATIONS \nREPORT , March 2016, available at https://www.aclu.org/report/lethal-disguise-health-\nconsequences-crowd-control-weapons (“PHR/INCL Report”) (last accessed July 29, 2016).  \n  7 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 8 of 66\n28.  Two of the four documented uses of LRADs discussed in the PHR/INCLO Report \nwere by the NYPD, and the last uses of LRAD force discussed are the December 5, 2014 LRAD \nuses at issue in this lawsuit. See PHR/INCLO Report at p. 74.  \n29.  The PHR/INCLO Report notes: \nSales of LRADs to U.S. police departments have grown since the wave of Black \nLives Matter protests around the United States protesting police killing s of \nAfrican-Americans, raising concerns that the inappropriate deployment of LRADs \nagainst protesters will only increase. \n \nId. \n30.  As to the Health Effects, the PHR/INCLO Report finds: \nSound cannons are used to emit painful, loud sounds that have the potential to \ncause significant harm to the eardrums and delicate organs of the ears and/or \ncause hearing loss. Use of earplugs or firmly blocking the ears with hands can \ndecrease the sound by 20 – 30 dB, but this may not be enough to avoid significant \ninjury. Manufacturer guidelines indicate that sound cannons should only be used \n \nfrom at least a 10 – 20 metre distance. Significantly, there is a risk of injury to law \nenforcement officers, particularly those operating the device, who are advised to \nwear ear protection. In addition to auditory effects, acoustic weapons may also \ninjure internal membranes (infrasonic devices).  \nThere is little medical literature on the effects of acoustic weapons on people. \nSome literature notes that acoustic weapons were first developed by the military \nand any early evaluations of their health effects are biased and, in some cases, \nhave unclear findings. The weapons can be indiscriminate, causing harm or pain \nto protesters, bystanders, and law enforcement, despite the narrow beam in which \nsound is concentrated. The sound is designed to be controlled by police officers, \nwho can alter the frequency, level, quality, and length of the alarm. Abuse or lack \nof operator knowledge about the health effects can easily lead to incorrect use of \nthe weapon and exacerbate injuries. Serious questions remain about the safety and \nefficacy of acoustic weapons in crowd-control contexts.  \nId. at p. 76. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n31.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over federal claims pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a)(3) and (4).  \n  8 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 9 of 66\n32.  The federal civil rights claims in this action are brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § \n1983 for violations of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the \nUnited States. \n33.  The Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 USC §§ 2201 and 2202, authorizes \nthis Court to grant Plaintiffs the declaratory relief they pray for herein. \n34.  Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes this Court to grant \nPlaintiffs the injunctive relief they pray for herein. \n35.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) in that the Plaintiffs’ claims \narose in the County of New York in the State of New York, within the confines of this judicial \ndistrict. \n36.  Pursuant to New York State General Municipal Law (“GML”) § 50-e, Plaintiffs \nEDREI, STEPHAN, CRAVEN, HORSE, and NUSBAUM10 filed timely Notices of Claim with \nthe New York City Comptroller on or about March 4, 2015, within 90 days of the events herein \ncomplained of.  \n37.

Upon information and belief, the NYPD purchased two LRAD Model 3300 \ndevices in 2004, in advance of the Republican National Convention (“RNC”) in New York City \nin August of 2004.  \n  12 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 13 of 66\n58.  Upon information and belief, those LRADs were “among the first devices sold to \nlaw enforcement.”12 \n59.  Then-NYPD spokesman Paul Browne cited two possible uses for LRADs to the \nAssociated Press (“AP”) in 2004: “directing crowds to safety following a terrorist attack or other \ncalamity, and reminding protesters where they’re allowed to march and rally.”13 \n60.  Upon information and belief, prior to purchasing those LRADs, the NYPD did not \nengage in appropriate research into whether the LRADs could be used safely, for crowd control \npurposes or otherwise. \n61.  For example, upon information and belief, the NYPD did not engage in research \nbeyond obtaining materials from the manufacturer designed to sell LRADs. \n62.  The DCU conducted tests utilizing those LRADs in 2004 but as of 2010 the \nresults of those tests were “unavailable.”14 \n63.  According to the AP, the Department “insist[ed that] the [warning tone] feature \n[would not] be used at the convention” and then-DCU Commander Thomas Graham guaranteed \nthe public that the LRAD was “only to communicate in large crowds.15  \n64.  According to the NYPD itself, the NYPD only used the LRAD in connection with \nthe 2004 RNC “sporadically…as loudspeakers.” Also according to the NYPD, “[b]oth devices \nwere used sporadically in Manhattan at protests outside of the convention site (Madison Square \nGarden), including those in the Union Square area . . . as a loudspeaker to make announcements \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n12   DCU LRAD Briefing at p. 8. \n13   Tom Hays, “Authorities to Turn up the Volume for GOP Convention: A 150-decibel \nMegaphone,” ASSOCIATED PRESS (Aug. 19, 2004). \n14   DCU LRAD Briefing at p. 4. \n15   Id. \n  13 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 14 of 66\nto the crowd of protesters, with mixed results.”16 \n65.  Neither Plaintiffs nor counsel are aware of uses of the LRAD by the NYPD \nbetween 2004 and around September or later in 2011.  \n66.  Nevertheless, during that time period between 2014 and before around September \nor later in 2011, the NYPD policed thousands of First Amendment assemblies involving street \nand sidewalk marches. \n67.  Plaintiffs and counsel are only aware of a few incidents in which the NYPD \ndeployed LRADs between 2011 and November of 2014. \n68.  All were in connection with protests, and most were in connection with protests \nagainst police brutality. \n69.  For example, upon information and belief, the NYPD did not deploy LRADs to \nuse in communicating with New Yorkers in the wake of or in connection with recovery efforts \nrelated to Hurricane Sandy. \n70.  LRADs have frequently been deployed by the NYPD beginning since around late \n2014, for example in connection with police responses to protests over the NYPD killing of Akai \nGurley. \n71.  Upon information and belief, LRADs were first deployed regularly by the NYPD \nin connection with the protests against police brutality that had begun just days before in the \naftermath of the November 24, 2014 announcement that the Ferguson, Missouri grand jury \nconsidering charges against Darren Wilson, the law enforcement officer who shot and killed \nMike Brown, had voted no true bill, and which resurged in the wake of the Staten Island grand \njury’s failure to indict NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo on December 3, 2014.  \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n16   DCU LRAD Briefing at p. 2. \n  14 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 15 of 66\n72.  Since December of 2014, the NYPD routinely deploys and uses LRADs in \nconnection with perceived protests, demonstrations, and other assemblies. \n73.  As reflected in the DCU LRAD Briefing, the DCU tested its two LRAD Model \n3300 devices – the ones it had bought in advance of the 2004 RNC - in 2010 “in an empty \nparking lot at Orchard Beach, in the Bronx.” 17  \n74.  The DCU conducted two tests: The first with the power/audio “turned to level just \nbelow Maximum, using spoken voice commands” and the second with the power/audio “turned \nto maximum, using noise bursts.”18 \n75.  The tests revealed as follows: \nTest #1 – Just below maximum, spoken voice commands \n \n102 dB at 320 feet \n78 dB at 640 feet \n64 dB at 800 feet \n \nTest #2 – Maximum, noise bursts \n \n110 dB at 320 feet \n90 dB at 640 feet \n68 dB at 800 feet \n \n76.  A DCU chart of “examples of sound levels in comparison” notes that 110 dB is \naround as loud as a power saw.19  \n77.  The DCU did not take any readings within 320 feet of the front of the LRAD \ndevice for either test, calling that zone a “potential danger area” and labeling it “not tested.”20 \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n17   Id. at pp. 4-6. \n18   Id. at pp. 5-6. \n19   Id. at p. 3. \n20   Id.  \n  15 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 16 of 66\n \n78.  At some point after 2010 and before November of 2011, the NYPD purchased at \nleast one LRAD 100x – the type of device used to injure Plaintiffs. \n79.  Upon information and belief, the NYPD did not conduct testing of LRAD 100x’s \nprior to December 5, 2014.  \n80.  The LRAD 100x manufacturer’s product sheet specifically boasts that it can \nprovide “powerful, intelligible communication up to 600 meters” with a maximum continuous \noutput of 136 dB at 1 meter, A-weighted, and the capacity to overcome 88dB of background \nnoise at 250 meters, which is “10-20 decibels . . . louder than the most competitive megaphones \n[and] four to six times louder [than] . . . [s]ystems of comparable size and power.”21  \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n21   LRAD 100X Product Sheet (downloaded from LRAD website in December of 2014). \n  16 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 17 of 66\n81.  “The level of sound produced by these devices exceeds both the threshold for \nhuman discomfort (between 85 and 95 dB) and the normal human pain threshold (between 120 \nand 140 dB).”22  \n82.  According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, \n“exposures [greater than] 85 dB may cause hearing loss.”23  \n83.  According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication \nDisorders, “any sound over 90 dB can damage a person’s hearing. So the LRAD can threaten the \nhearing of anyone in its path, regardless of whether there is any wrongdoing, even when used \nonly for communication.”24   \n84.  Against that backdrop, \nThe possible health risks are magnified due to the fact that the LRAD is a large-\nscale device, targeting a large population rather than specific individuals. Pain \ntolerance varies among the population, and certain groups – including children – \nare more vulnerable to hearing loss. Moreover, individuals within large crowds \nmay be unable to move out of the LRAD’s range due to physical disability or the \nsheer volume of people in a given area. The indiscriminate nature of this device \ndoes not allow the police to accommodate and respond to individuals’ differing \nreactions, increasing the possibility that at-risk populations will be hurt.25 \n \n85.  In 2009, the Pittsburgh Police Department deployed LRAD’s in connection with \npolicing protests in response to the 2009 G20 Summit. \n86.  The DCU LRAD Briefing says that LRADs were used “successfully” by the \nPittsburgh Police Department in connection with policing the 2009 G20. 26  \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n22   Letter of Canadian Civil Liberties Association to Chief of Police William Blair, dated \nJune 1, 2010 (“CCLA Letter”), at p. 3.  \n23   See http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/noisemeter.html (last visited March 2, 2016). \n24   Tracy V.

So do the LRAD’s manufacturing materials, which include the following \nquotation from a Pittsburgh law enforcement official: “‘Every police officer I talked to thought it \nworked famously, the bottom line is we could maintain order with the protesters without hurting \nthem.’”27 \n88.  However, immediately after the G20, the American Tinnitus Association, the \nNational Institute of Health, and the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication \nDisorders, reportedly disagreed. \n89.  For example, The Washington Times reported that the American Tinnitus \nAssociation said that protesters had been “‘acoustically assaulted’ with sound” at volumes that \ncould cause ‘tinnitus and hearing damage immediately.’” The Washington Times also reported: \n“The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has said permanent hearing loss can result from sounds \nat about 110 to 120 decibels in short bursts or at 75 decibels with long periods of exposure. The \nNational Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders said regular exposure of \nmore than one minute of 110 decibels can result in permanent hearing loss.”28  \n90.  Additionally, in September of 2011, the American Civil Liberties Union of \nPittsburgh sued on behalf of Plaintiff Karen L. Piper, a visiting professor at Carnegie Mellon \nUniversity who suffered permanent hearing loss, nausea, pain and disorientation on September \n24, 2009 when the LRAD was fired at protesters by the City of Pittsburgh and its agents.

According to the ACLU and the Piper Complaint: \n \nAfter the protest began, Piper walked on the sidewalk a short distance from the \nmarching protesters, in the company of other curiosity seekers and journalists. When \nPiper became concerned about rapidly increasing police activity, she tried to leave the \narea. As she was walking away, police officers activated, suddenly and without \nwarning, an LRAD a short distance away from her. It emitted a continuous piercing \nsound lasting several minutes. \nPiper immediately suffered intense pain as mucus discharged from her ears. She \nbecame nauseous and dizzy and developed a severe headache. Since then, Piper has \nsuffered from tinnitus (ringing of the ears), barotrauma, left ear pain and fluid \ndrainage, dizziness, and nausea.29  \n92.  Ms. Piper won a $72,000 monetary settlement in that lawsuit in 2012 as well as an \nagreement from the City to develop “a policy governing LRAD deployment to ensure its careful \nand controlled use.”30 \n93.  As articulated by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (“CCLA”) in a letter \nwritten to Canadian government officials in advance of potential Canadian LRAD use to police \nanticipated mass protests in connection with the G8 and G20 in 2010: \nThe introduction of any new weapon into police arsenals requires a process of \nobjective scientific research into the short-term and long-term physical effects of \nthe weapon’s use, consultation with the public who are the potential targets of \nsuch weapons, and policy debates. Reliance on research by the manufacturer is \ninsufficient. . . .  \n \nSimply put, new weapons such as the LRAD should not be employed without \nprior independent assessment and study. Protocols regarding deployment and use \nshould be developed with reference to independent science, not on the basis of \nmanufacturer’s claims and should incorporate public consultation and \nparticipation. Finally, comprehensive reporting, monitoring and oversight \nmechanisms must be established to account for how any approved weapons are \nactually used in the field.31 \n \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n29   See Piper Complaint; ACLU of Pennsylvania website - http://www.aclupa.org/our-\nwork/legal/legaldocket/piper-v-city-pittsburgh-et-al/ (last visited March 3, 2016). \n30   See ACLU of Pennsylvania website - http://www.aclupa.org/news/2012/11/14/city-\npittsburgh-settles-g-20-lawsuits (last visited March 3, 2016). \n31   CCLA Letter at p. 3. \n  19 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 20 of 66\n94.  Upon information and belief, although the NYPD had been using LRADs in \nconnection with policing demonstrations since 2004, at no time prior to September of 2012 did \nthe NYPD develop or train its officers who were charged with using LRADs in policies, \ndirectives, manuals, or memoranda related to the proper use or operation of LRADs, how LRAD \nuses related to established NYPD use of force protocols, when the use of the LRAD’s “deterrent” \ntone was appropriate, and at what volumes, distances, and frequencies, or anything else at all \nrelated to LRADs.  \n95.  One basis for that information and belief is that, in 2011, Plaintiff Keegan \nStephan and another person filed a Freedom of Information Law (“FOIL”) request with the \nNYPD seeking, inter alia, records related to any policies whatsoever related to LRAD operation \nand use, and the NYPD eventually averred that its diligent searches had uncovered no such \npolicies. \n96.  The only documents the NYPD located related to LRADs or NYPD use of \nLRADs in its possession at all as of 2012 were seventeen pages of news clippings and marketing \nmaterials from the manufacturer and the eight-page DCU “Briefing on the LRAD” dated January \nof 2010. \n97.  Therefore, as of at least 2012, the NYPD had no written policies or training \nmaterials related to LRAD use. \n98.  Additionally, since this litigation was initially commenced, there has been a final \ndetermination and response from the NYPD on the FOIL submitted in December of 2014 related \nto NYPD LRAD uses between 2012 and 2014, in connection with which the NYPD disclosed \nonly the same materials, which it had previously disclosed in 2012, along with copies of then-\n  20 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 21 of 66\nactive version of the NYPD’s Patrol Guide provision regarding Use of Force, PG 203-11, which \ndoes not account for LRAD use. \n99.  Moreover, in “Police Use of Force in New York City: Findings and \nRecommendations on NYPD’s Policies and Practices,” an October 1, 2015 report published by \nthe New York City Department of Investigation Office of the Inspector General for the NYPD \n(“OIG-NYPD”)32, the OIG-NYPD made several conclusions critical of the NYPD’s then-extant \nuse of force policies, including, inter alia, that: \na.  NYPD’s current use of force policy is vague and imprecise, providing little \nguidance to individual officers on what actions constitute force; \n \nb.  NYPD’s current procedures for documenting and reporting force incidents are \nfragmented across numerous forms, and officers frequently use generic \nlanguage that fails to capture the specifics of an encounter; \n \nc.  NYPD’s patrol guide does not properly instruct officers to de-escalate \nencounters with the public; \n \nd.  NYPD training does not adequately focus on de-escalation; and \n \ne.  In the period reviewed, NYPD frequently failed to impose discipline even \nwhen provided with evidence of excessive force. \n \nOIG-NYPD Report at pp. 3-5. \n100.  After October 1, 2015, the NYPD revised its Patrol Guide provisions, and \ndesigned, created, and implemented training, to include “updated definitions concerning force, \nnew policies regarding de-escalation, responsibilities of witness officers in use of force incidents, \nreporting obligations concerning force incidents, and data analysis on use of force incidents”.

Significantly, none of those changes to the NYPD’s use of force written \nguidelines address LRAD uses as uses of force.  \n102.  For example, according to a June 2016 “Use of Force: Revised NYPD Policy” \nNYPD training document35, the “New Levels of Force” enshrined in NYPD Patrol Guide \nprovision 221-03 (“New Levels of Force”) describe the following levels of force: \nLEVEL 1: Physical Force/Less Lethal Device \n \na.  Hand strikes \nb.  Foot strikes \nc.  Forcible take-downs \nd.  Wrestling subject to the ground \ne.  Use of OC spray (PG 221-07) \nf.

Firearms discharge (PG 221-04) \nb.  Physical force readily capable of causing death or serious physical injury \n \n103.  Therefore, upon information and belief, the NYPD recently changed its use of \nforce written guidelines, practices, and training, to cover everything from “use of a mesh \nrestraining blanket” to “wrestling subject to the ground” – but not LRAD uses. \n104.  Although Defendants Bratton and City knew or should have known as early as \n2004 that the LRADs they purchased in 2004 were dangerous weapons, they have not conducted \nadequate studies in connection with LRAD uses, have not developed and trained officers in \nappropriate, written protocols regarding LRAD deployment and use, and have not established \nappropriate reporting, monitoring, and oversight mechanisms, since then.  \n105.  Since some time after December of 2014, Defendants Bratton and City have been \ndeploying LRADs routinely at demonstrations. For example, NYPD officers assigned to the \nDepartment’s “Strategic Response Group” – a division of the NYPD created by Defendants \nBratton and City in 2015 that has replaced the DCU and been a constant presence at protests \nsince 2015 – frequently brandish and/or have used LRADs at protests. \n106.  The increased frequency of these LRAD deployments and threatened uses - at \nleast with respect to protests against police brutality - coupled with Plaintiffs’ experiences, and \nthe proof that the Department had no written policies or practices regarding LRAD use as of \nSeptember 2012, though LRADs were deployed by the Department in connection with crowd \ncontrol between 2004 and September of 2012, show that Defendants’ policies, practices, and \ncustoms with respect to LRAD deployment and use and related lack of training, monitoring, and \noversight were the motivating forces behind the Department’s LRAD uses against Plaintiffs on \nDecember 5, 2014, and the resulting injuries. \nTHE DECEMBER 4-5, 2014 ERIC GARNER GRAND JURY PROTESTS \n  23 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 24 of 66\n107.  On December 3, 2014, news broke that a Staten Island grand jury had declined to \nindict the NYPD officer involved in the death of Eric Garner. \n108.  On December 4, 2014, hundreds protested in New York City, on the streets of \nManhattan, in other boroughs, elsewhere in the country, and internationally. \n109.  On December 4-5, 2014, as described more fully below, Plaintiffs were each \nprotesters, observers, photojournalists, or filmmakers who were participating in, observing, or \ndocumenting the protests and police responses when they were assaulted by Defendants Maguire \nand Poletto utilizing an LRAD. \n110.  For the first few hours of the evening protests in which Plaintiffs participated or \nwhich Plaintiffs observed or documented, NYPD officers escorted and facilitated the protests. \n111.  At some time after 1:00 am, NYPD officers made arrests in the intersection of \n57th Street and Madison Avenue in Manhattan. \n112.  For example, three to four officers cooperated to pin a person to the ground, \nincluding with a knee in the back, who was not apparently resisting them. \n113.  Some Plaintiffs, and others, gathered to observe, document, and otherwise \nrespond to those police actions, for example by protesting verbally. \n114.  They did not interfere with or threaten the ongoing arrest activity. \n115.  Some unidentified person or persons – not Plaintiffs – then apparently threw some \nobjects, possibly glass bottles, toward the scene. \n116.  The objects did not strike or injure anyone. \n117.  At around the same time, without warning, an NYPD officer or NYPD officers at \nthe scene deployed pepper spray. \n  24 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 25 of 66\n118.  In response, Plaintiffs and many other non-NYPD officers present began to run \naway and otherwise flee from the police, including by moving on 57th Street between Madison \nand Park Avenues. \n119.  Defendant Maguire and Poletto were holding and jointly operating a LRAD at the \nscene. \n120.  Within moments, Defendants Maguire and Poletto began to fire the “deterrent” \ntone of the LRAD in the direction of the people who were already fleeing on 57th Street. \n121.  As they operated the LRAD on 57th Street, Defendants Maguire and Poletto were \nthemselves in the roadway on 57th Street, obstructing the flow of vehicular traffic along with \nmany other NYPD officers who were also present and in the roadways in the intersection of 57th \nStreet and Madison Avenue and nearby. \n122.  At the same time as they repeatedly fired the “deterrent” tone, Defendants \nMaguire and Poletto also used the LRAD to broadcast messages identifying themselves as \nNYPD and directing people to get or stay on the sidewalk and out of the street or they would be \nplaced in custody. \n123.  The use of the “deterrent” tone at the same time as the broadcast feature made it \ndifficult or impossible to hear and/or comply with the police directions. \n124.  The messages were at times conflicting and/or difficult to understand, including \nbecause at least many of the people they were directed at were already fleeing on the sidewalks \nand/or because the police themselves were blocking traffic in the streets. \n125.  In the just under three minutes it took Defendants Maguire and Poletto to walk the \nlength of 57th Street between Madison and Park Avenues, they fired the LRAD “deterrent” tone \n  25 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 26 of 66\nbetween fifteen or twenty times – almost continuously – as they walked in the roadway, blocking \ntraffic. \n126.  As described more fully below, Plaintiffs were each seized and injured by \nDefendants Maguire and Poletto on 57th Street between Madison and Park Avenues when \nDefendants fired the LRAD at them. \n127.  When Defendants Maguire and Poletto fired the LRAD at Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs \nwere lawfully and properly exercising their rights and privileges to be on or around the streets \nand sidewalks of the City of New York, to associate, to assemble, to express themselves, and to \ngather and disseminate information freely, as well as their free press rights. \n128.  When Defendants Maguire and Poletto fired the LRAD at Plaintiffs and others, \nthose uses of force terminated or severely limited Plaintiffs’ freedom of movement through pain \ncompliance and threat of permanent injury. \n129.  When Defendants Maguire and Poletto fired the LRAD at Plaintiffs and others, \nthose uses of the LRAD terminated or severely limited Plaintiffs’ freedoms to move, assemble, \nassociate, receive and communicate ideas, and otherwise express themselves. \n130.  When Defendants Maguire and Poletto fired the LRAD at Plaintiffs and others, \nthey knew or should have known that the use of the LRAD could cause permanent hearing \ndamage and other injury. \n131.  At certain points during the just under three minutes that Defendants Maguire and \nPoletto were firing the LRAD on 57th Street, they were fewer than ten feet away from Plaintiffs, \nprotesters, and innocent bystanders, angling the LRAD directly at them. \n  26 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 27 of 66\n132.  When Defendants Maguire and Poletto fired the LRAD at Plaintiffs and others, \nthey knew or should have known that the use of the LRAD at such close ranges would be likely \nto cause permanent hearing damage and other injury. \n133.  As seen above, Defendants Bratton and City have ratified Defendant Maguire’s \nand Poletto’s uses of force in deploying the LRAD against Plaintiffs. \n134.  Each Plaintiff is reluctant to participate in and/or engage in documenting future \nprotests, demonstrations, and other, similar events for fear of further injuries inflicted by NYPD \nLRAD uses.  \nPLAINTIFF ANIKA EDREI \n135.  On December 5, 2014, Plaintiff ANIKA EDREI was a twenty-year-old \nphotojournalist and photographer enrolled in a one-year intensive certificate program in \nDocumentary Photography and Photojournalism at the International Center of Photography in \nNew York City.  \n136.  Plaintiff Edrei is known professionally in Plaintiff Edrei’s photojournalism work \nas “Moth Dust”. See http://www.mothdust.net/.  \n137.  Plaintiff Edrei’s work has been published in VICE Motherboard & Galore \nMagazine, among others. Plaintiff Edrei’s images have also been featured in festivals and \ngalleries such as Tipping Point, Guatephoto and several other private shows in New York City. \n138.  On the evening of December 4, 2014, Plaintiff Edrei was informed by co-plaintiff \nand fellow photojournalist Shay Horse that there would be protests in Manhattan related to a \nStaten Island grand jury’s failure to indict the police officer involved in the death of Eric Garner.  \n139.   Plaintiff Edrei attended the protests in order to document them, as part of \nPlaintiff Edrei’s photojournalism coursework, and in order to pitch photographs Plaintiff Edrei \n  27 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 28 of 66\nmight take to magazines, newspapers, and other outlets with a view toward publishing them, in \nthe name of gathering and publishing newsworthy information, and in furtherance of Plaintiff \nEdrei’s career goals. \n140.  Plaintiff Edrei followed protests around the streets of Manhattan for several hours.  \n141.  The protesters were escorted and accompanied by NYPD officers for those \nseveral hours.  \n142.  Around or after 1 a.m. on December 5, 2014, at or around the area of 57th Street \nand Madison Avenue, Plaintiff Edrei saw NYPD officers arresting people.   \n143.  Those arrests appeared violent to Plaintiff Edrei.   \n144.  Plaintiff Edrei took photographs of people being placed under arrest with their \nfaces pressed into the ground and police knees in their backs. \n145.  Plaintiff Edrei was careful to position Plaintiff Edrei so that Plaintiff Edrei could \nget what Plaintiff Edrei believed could be newsworthy shots without interfering with the officers. \n146.  Plaintiff Edrei tried to continue taking photographs, but was pushed out of view \nby officers.  \n147.  Plaintiff Edrei heard and saw several protesters verbally protest and beg police to \nstop violently arresting people.  \n148.  Plaintiff Edrei saw people gather to observe the ongoing arrests and police uses of \nforce. \n149.  Plaintiff Edrei heard a sound like glass breaking. \n150.  Plainitff Edrei heard yelling and shouting. \n151.  Plaintiff Edrei started running away. \n  28 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 29 of 66\n152.  Plaintiff Edrei then saw other people who had been gathered near the arrests run \naway. \n153.  From behind Plaintiff Edrei, Plaintiff Edrei then heard a sort of high-pitched, \nwhirring siren, what Plaintiff Edrei now believes to be the “deterrent tone” of a LRAD.  \n154.  There was no warning that the deterrent tone of the LRAD would be used. \n155.   At first, Plaintiff Edrei thought Plaintiff Edrei was hearing a very loud car alarm.  \n156.  Plaintiff Edrei then remembered that co-plaintiff Horse had previously told \nPlaintiff Edrei about an LRAD he had seen and heard deployed in Ferguson, Missouri, and \nPlaintiff Edrei formed the belief that Plaintiff Edrei was likely hearing the LRAD.  \n157.   After hearing the LRAD’s deterrent tone, Plaintiff Edrei turned around and \nobserved two NYPD officers holding the LRAD, following behind Plaintiff Edrei and others \nwho were running or otherwise moving quickly away from the police or otherwise fleeing.  \n158.  Almost immediately, Plaintiff Edrei felt a surge of adrenaline and began to \nexperience a migraine and to feel woozy. \n159.  Plaintiff Edrei heard the “deterrent” tone used repeatedly, interrupted by brief \npauses. \n160.  Plaintiff Edrei heard some portions of an unclear and wordy directive to the effect \nof “Get off the street” also coming through the LRAD’s speaker, at the same time the deterrent \ntone was firing.  \n161.  Plaintiff Edrei was in between parked cars on the side of the street, outside the \npart of the roadway reserved for cars to travel on. \n162.  People were running away from the Defendants using the LRAD. \n  29 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 30 of 66\n163.  Plaintiff Edrei tried to put her fingers in her ears to plug them, and to run as fast \nas Plaintiff Edrei could from the sound. \n164.  Plaintiff Edrei was able to leave the immediate area where the police had been \nusing LRAD. \n165.  After being exposed to the LRAD, Plaintiff Edrei was very confused.  \n166.  Plaintiff Edrei tried to meet back up with the marches to continue documenting \nthe night, but Plaintiff Edrei’s physical condition deteriorated and prevented Plaintiff Edrei from \ndoing that.  \n167.  Specifically, Plaintiff Edrei got a migraine, which then spread to Plaintiff Edrei’s \nentire face.   \n168.  Plaintiff Edrei felt acute pain in Plaintiff Edrei’s sinuses and overall pain across \nPlaintiff Edrei’s face.  \n169.  Plaintiff Edrei felt very dizzy and had to sit down.  \n170.  People asked if Plaintiff Edrei was alright.  \n171.  Plaintiff Edrei was physically and emotionally jarred. \n172.  Plaintiff Edrei felt very disoriented and wanted to go home.  \n173.  Plaintiff Edrei attempted to call Plaintiff Edrei’s boyfriend to figure out how \nPlaintiff Edrei could get home, but was unable to concentrate.  \n174.  Eventually, someone helped Plaintiff Edrei into a taxi cab that took Plaintiff Edrei \nhome. \n175.  Plaintiff Edrei had a migraine headache for around the next week.  \n176.  For at least the following five days, Plaintiff Edrei noticed that Plaintiff Edrei was \nvery sensitive to sounds and even very soft sounds hurt Plaintiff Edrei’s ears.   \n  30 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 31 of 66\n177.  Plaintiff Edrei continued to feel woozy and to have a headache. \n178.  Plaintiff Edrei felt a lot of facial pressure for around the next week. \n179.  Ever since the incident, Plaintiff Edrei has been more sensitive to noise than \nPlaintiff Edrei was before the incident. \n180.   Plaintiff Edrei feels very traumatized after having the LRAD’s deterrent sound \nfired at Plaintiff Edrei, particularly as Plaintiff Edrei was at the scene as a member of the press.  \n181.  For Plaintiff Edrei, this was an act of violence committed without warning, while \nPlaintiff Edrei was trying to leave the scene of glass breaking as fast as Plaintiff Edrei could.  \n182.  Plaintiff Edrei experiences ringing in Plaintiff Edrei’s ears to this day, about half \nof the time. \n183.  The ringing in Plaintiff Edrei’s ears gets worse after listening to live music. \n184.  After December 5, 2014, Plaintiff Edrei pitched some of the photographs Plaintiff \nEdrei had taken the night of this incident to various publications, including The Villager and The \nShadow.  \n185.  Multiple photographs taken by Plaintiff Edrei on the night of this incident were \npublished in VICE Motherboard. See Alex Pasternack, The New Sound of Crowd Control, \nMOTHERBOARD, December 17, 2014, available at http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-new-\nsound-of-crowd-control (last visited March 2, 2016). \n186.  As part of Plaintiff Edrei’s photojournalism coursework, Plaintiff Edrei uploaded \nphotographs Plaintiff Edrei had taken that night to Plaintiff Edrei’s professional photography \nblog. \n187.  Plaintiff Edrei still works as a professional photojournalist and photographer. \n  31 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 32 of 66\n188.  Plaintiff Edrei’s career has been adversely affected by the injuries Plaintiff Edrei \nsustained on December 5, 2014. \n189.  Plaintiff Edrei dream job has always been to be a photojournalist, covering \nprotests and other heated current events.  \n190.  For work, among other things, Plaintiff Edrei’s shoots live concerts. \n191.  Plaintiff Edrei’s must now bring additional ear protection when covering live \nconcerts. \n192.  Even with additional ear protection, Plaintiff Edrei experiences pain and \nsensitivity while carrying out these job duties.  \n193.  The season before December 5, 2014, Plaintiff Edrei had been photographing \nprotests regularly, including two BlackLivesMatter protests and a few climate-related protests. \n194.  After being exposed to the LRAD and the ensuing pain, ringing, and sensitivity, \nPlaintiff Edrei has not felt able to cover protests.   \n195.  Plaintiff Edrei attempted to take photographs at one protest after December 5, \n2014, and had to leave early due to the emotional and physical effects of this incident. \n196.  Plaintiff Edrei is afraid to go to protests, and has not been able to cover a protest \nsince December 5, 2014, out of fear that Plaintiff Edrei will be exposed to an LRAD and will \nsuffer further confusion, headaches, ear pain, and hearing damage.  \nPLAINTIFF SHAY HORSE \n197.  On December 5, 2014, Plaintiff SHAY HORSE was a twenty-one-year-old \nworking as a freelance photojournalist. \n198.  Plaintiff Horse still works as a freelance photojournalist.   \n  32 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 33 of 66\n199.  Plaintiff Horse’s photographs have appeared in Al Jazeera and Russia Today, in \naddition to other media outlets.   \n200.  Plaintiff Horse has travelled around the United States and to other countries to \ndocument protests and other newsworthy events. \n201.  On the evening of December 4, 2015, Plaintiff Horse went to where he believed \nthere would be protests in response to a Staten Island grand jury’s failure to indict the police \nofficer involved in the death of Eric Garner.  \n202.  Plaintiff Horse attended the protests in order to document aspects of the protests \nand police response to them, as part of his photojournalism work, and in order to pitch \nphotographs to magazines, newspapers, and other outlets, in the name of gathering and \npublishing newsworthy information and so that the photographs could be published and in \nfurtherance of his career goals. \n203.  Plaintiff Horse followed protests around the streets of Manhattan for several \nhours.  \n204.  The protesters were escorted and accompanied by NYPD officers for those \nseveral hours.  \n205.  At around or after 1 a.m., Plaintiff Horse was attempting to walk near protesters \nwest on 58th Street when Plaintiff Horse observed NYPD officers blocking protesters from \ncontinuing westward by forming a police line stretching across the street and sidewalks. \n206.  Unable to proceed westward on 58th Street, some protesters proceeded south on \n7th Avenue, and turned east on 57th Street. \n  33 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 34 of 66\n207.  At some time between around 1:10 and 1:15 a.m. or after, Plaintiff Horse \nobserved protesters proceed on 57th Street and attempt to cross the intersection of 57th Street and \nMadison Avenue.  \n208.  Plaintiff Horse then observed police officers violently arrest several people. \n209.  Plaintiff Horse saw the officers with their batons out and swinging. \n210.  Plaintiff Horse saw some people move toward the officers who were arresting \npeople, and then saw the officers make additional arrests.   \n211.  Plaintiff Horse saw police officers discharge pepper spray toward the crowd.  \n212.  Plaintiff Horse saw what he believed to be glass bottles thrown toward where the \npolice were arresting people.  \n213.  At that point, Plaintiff Horse was about four feet away from the people being \narrested, and was trying to take photographs.  \n214.  Plaintiff Horse was careful to position himself so that he would not be interfering \nwith the officers. \n215.  Plaintiff Horse then heard the police yell in sum and substance for everyone to get \non the sidewalk.  \n216.  Plaintiff Horse then heard the sound of an LRAD being activated. \n217.  Plaintiff Horse did not hear a dispersal order from the police. \n218.  Plaintiff Horse did not hear any warning that the LRAD would be used.   \n219.  Plaintiff Horse then heard the LRAD repeatedly fire its “deterrent” tone.  \n220.  Plaintiff Horse tried to get away from the LRAD quickly, by moving away from \nthe police.  \n  34 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 35 of 66\n221.  Plaintiff Horse heard police officers use the LRAD to broadcast messages, \nincluding to get on the sidewalk, as he was moving away from them.  \n222.  At the same time as the officers used the LRAD to broadcast many of those \nmessages, they were also firing its “deterrent” tone.  \n223.  Plaintiff Horse got on the sidewalk and continued to move away from the officers. \n224.  Plaintiff Horse turned around and saw Defendants Maguire and Poletto walking \nbehind him and others who were fleeing from the police firing the LRAD. \n225.   Plaintiff Horse saw Defendants Maguire and Poletto holding the LRAD between \nthe two of them, firing it, apparently indiscriminately, as people were fleeing from the police \nfiring the LRAD.  \n226.  At that point, Plaintiff Horse was on the sidewalk near Plaintiff Edrei and others. \n227.  Plaintiff Horse was upset that the police were using the LRAD against people \nwho were trying to get away, and from such a close distance.  \n228.  Plaintiff Horse yelled a critical comment at the officers holding the LRAD, and \nstepped briefly off the curb to take a picture of them, and then returned to the sidewalk. \n229.  After yelling at Defendants Maguire and Poletto, Plaintiff Horse then saw these \ntwo officers turn toward him, and fire the LRAD while pointing it at him, although he had all \ncomplied with orders and was on the sidewalk.  \n230.  Plaintiff Horse ran down the sidewalk away from the officers, and saw \nDefendants Maguire and Poletto continue to direct the LRAD at him and Plaintiff Edrei and \nothers while firing its “deterrent” tone.   \n231.  Plaintiff Horse was eventually able to leave the area where the officers were firing \nthe LRAD. \n  35 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 36 of 66\n232.  While the LRAD was directed at him, Plaintiff Horse’s eardrums were beating \nhard and it was incredibly painful.   \n233.  Plaintiff Horse felt as though he were bleeding out of his nose, ears, and mouth.  \n234.  Plaintiff Horse repeatedly asked others around him if he was actually bleeding.  \n235.  Plaintiff Horse got a migraine headache, and his sinuses, nose, throat, and ears all \nfelt as though they were on fire.   \n236.  The side of Plaintiff Horse’s body that was hit by the LRAD felt numb.    \n237.  The next day and for at least the following five days, Plaintiff Horse’s migraine \nheadache and the sensation that he was bleeding out of his ears and nose continued.  \n238.  Plaintiff Horse heard ringing in his ears and white noise, even when he was in \nsilent places.  \n239.  On December 9, 2014, Plaintiff Horse went to an Urgent Care facility to seek \nmedical assistance because he was still experiencing ringing and extreme pain in his ears.   \n240.  Plaintiff Horse complained of nausea, pain and ringing in his ears, and dizziness.  \n241.  Plaintiff Horse was diagnosed with “Tinnitus, bilateral” and “vertigo” and \nprescribed Meclizine. \n242.  Plaintiff Horse was referred to an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist, but did not \npursue the referral, including because he was uninsured and thought he could not afford \nspecialist care. \n243.  Plaintiff Horse still experiences ringing in his ears sometimes to this date. \n244.  Plaintiff Horse still experiences dizzy spells as often as once or twice a week. \n  36 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 37 of 66\n245.  Plaintiff Horse is very worried about the long-term effects of his December 5, \n2014 exposure to the LRAD on his hearing, and about his ability to continue to work as a \nphotojournalist who covers protests and conflict situations.   \n246.  Plaintiff Horse is very worried that as he continues to cover protests in New York \nCity as a photojournalist, the police will use the LRAD against him again and it will result in a \npermanent and significant impact on his hearing.  \n247.  Plaintiff Horse has covered protests since December 5, 2014 as a photojournalist.  \n248.  Plaintiff Horse intends to continue documenting protests and conflicts because it \nis his career and his life passion.  \n249.  However, his experiences on December 5, 2014 continue to harm his work as a \nphotojournalist in those contexts because he is now more nervous and cautious and less able to \nget the newsworthy shots he seeks. \nPLAINTIFF JAMES CRAVEN \n250.  On December 4, 2014, Plaintiff Craven was a twenty-seven year-old full-time \nstudent pursuing his Master of Science in Information Systems from Baruch College. \n251.  Plaintiff Craven works as an Information Technology consultant. \n252.  On December 4, 2014, Plaintiff Craven learned that there would be a large protest \nin Manhattan related to a Staten Island grand jury’s failure to indict the police officer involved in \nthe death of Eric Garner.   \n253.  Plaintiff Craven wanted to join others who were also outraged. \n254.  Plaintiff Craven also intended to document the protests and police responses \nthereto with a view toward potentially publishing newsworthy information. \n  37 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 38 of 66\n255.  At around 10:30 pm, Plaintiff Craven joined the march by riding nearby on his \nbicycle in the street, filming some of the events with a GoPro camera that was attached to his \nbicycle helmet. \n256.  Footage of the incident Plaintiff posted on YouTube has garnered almost 80,000 \nhits. \n257.  Mr. Craven spent most of the next few hours after 10:30 p.m. riding his bicycle in \nthe street. \n258.  The protesters were escorted and accompanied by NYPD officers for those \nseveral hours. \n259.  During that time period, Plaintiff Craven did not observe any noteworthy arrests.  \n260.  On or around 1 a.m. on December 5, 2014, Plaintiff Craven was near the back of \nthe march as it proceeded east on 57th Street toward Madison Avenue.  \n261.  At around 57th Street and Madison Avenue, Plaintiff Craven saw people gathering \naround the police making arrests to observe them.  \n262.  Near the scene of the arrests, Plaintiff Craven saw what he thought were bottles in \nthe air near the arrest scene.   \n263.  Plaintiff Craven did not see anyone hit or injured.  \n264.  Less than ten seconds later, Plaintiff Craven heard the LRAD “deterrent” tone.   \n265.  There was no warning that the LRAD would be used. \n266.  The LRAD produced one of the loudest noises he had ever heard. \n267.  Plaintiff Craven felt like he was inches from a car alarm going off. \n268.  Plaintiff Craven continued bicycling east toward Park Avenue.  \n  38 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 39 of 66\n269.  Plaintiff Craven heard what seemed to be orders from the police officers over the \nLRAD as well, but could not hear what they were, as they were given at the same time as the \n“deterrent” tone was being fired.  \n270.  Plaintiff Craven saw other people fleeing east on 57th Street to get away from the \npolice using the LRAD. \n271.  Defendants Maguire and Poletto fired the LRAD’s “deterrent” tone repeatedly \nover the course of almost three minutes on 57th Street between Madison and Park Avenues. \n272.  Plaintiff Craven continued bicycling near marchers for about 40 minutes, and then \nreturned to his home for the night.  \n273.  The next day, Plaintiff Craven suffered severe pain and ringing in both ears.   \n274.  This pain intensified when Plaintiff Craven encountered any loud sounds.  \n275.  This pain, sensitivity, and ringing continued for at least six days.  \n276.  The pain made bicycling around New York City, Plaintiff Craven’s usual mode of \ntransportation, difficult. \n277.  Within a week, because of the pain, ringing, and sensitivity in his ears, Plaintiff \nCraven sought medical treatment from the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. \n278.  Plaintiff Craven later sought treatment from his General Practitioner, who in turn \nreferred him to an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist.  \n279.  Plaintiff Craven saw an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist in early 2015 because he \nwas experiencing ringing in his ears. \n280.  Plaintiff Craven was deterred from attending protests for several months after \nDecember 5, 2014. \n281.  Plaintiff Craven remains nervous about attending future protests.   \n  39 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 40 of 66\n282.  Plaintiff Craven has only been to one protest since December 5, 2014.  \n283.  After the incident, Plaintiff Craven put earplugs on his keychain so that he could \nhave them ready to hand in case police use the LRAD again at or near him. \n284.  Plaintiff Craven worries that he will not have time to put earplugs in before \nanother LRAD is fired at or near him.  \nPLAINTIFF KEEGAN STEPHAN \n285.  Plaintiff KEEGAN STEPHAN is a long-time activist, and has been involved with \npolitical protests his entire adult life.  \n286.  Prior to December 4, 2014, Plaintiff Stephan had been to nearly every protest \nrelated to the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown in New York City. \n287.  Plaintiff Stephan joined the December 4, 2014 protests at around 4-5 p.m. in \nUnion Square. \n288.  Plaintiff Stephan attended the protest intending to observe and document the \nprotests and police response thereto with a view toward publishing newsworthy images, video, \nand/or commentary.  \n289.  At the time, Plaintiff Stephan regularly attended protests, taking and posting \nphotos and videos to his social media accounts. \n290.  On many occasions prior to December 4, 2014, mainstream media outlets had re-\nbroadcasted images and videos posted by Plaintiff Stephan. \n291.  For example, Plaintiff Stephan’s posts had been used in coverage of protests by \nThe New York Times, Newsweek, Newsday, Telesur, New York Magazine, and PBS. \n292.  On December 4, 2014, Plaintiff Stephan intended to take and broadcast photos \nand/or videos of the protests and police responses to his substantial social media following, with \n  40 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 41 of 66\na view toward republishing some of the images and videos, and/or commentary, including to \nmainstream media outlets. \n293.  Indeed, Plaintiff Stephan’s images, videos, and commentary from December 4 \nand 5, 2014, were used in stories on Buzzfeed, The Village Voice, and The Epoch Times. See \nSeveral Arrested During Second Night of Protests After Eric Garner Decision, BUZZFEED NEWS, \nDecember 4, 2014, available at http://www.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeednews/protesters-take-to-new-\nyork-city-again#.psLoDJvPK (last accessed March 3, 2016); Katie Toth, The NYPD’s Moment of \nRestraint is Over: 200+ Arrested, THE VILLAGE VOICE, December 5, 2014, available at \nhttp://www.villagevoice.com/news/the-nypds-moment-of-restraint-is-over-200-arrested-6674835 \n(last accessed March 3, 2016); Reid Schram, Eric Garner Decision Fuels Protests Across New \nYork, THE EPOCH TIMES, December 4, 2014, available at \nhttp://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1123416-eric-garner-decision-fuels-protests-across-new-\nyork-liveblog/ (last accessed March 3, 2016). \n294.  Since December 5, 2014, photos, videos, and/or commentary from Plaintiff \nStephan’s posts have been republished and/or used by Pix 11, WNYC, MTV, CBS, International \nBusiness Times, The Washington Post, AMNY, Telesure, Mic News, and The Huffington Post.  \n295.  Several articles specifically acknowledge how Plaintiff Stephan’s work as a \n“livetweeter” has influenced mainstream media. See, e.g., Mark Chiusano, Video is Shaping \n#BlackLivesMatter Protests in New York City, AMNEWYORK, December 17, 2015, available at \nhttp://www.amny.com/opinion/columnists/mark-chiusano/video-is-shaping-blacklivesmatter-\nprotests-in-new-york-city-1.11237109 (last accessed March 3, 2016); Amber van Moessner, \nWhat Everyone Should Know About Filming (and Sharing) Injustice on Social Media, MIC \n  41 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 42 of 66\nNEWS, available at http://mic.com/articles/136154/what-everyone-should-know-about-filming-\nand-sharing-injustice-on-social-media#.7u0TRqIno (last accessed March 3, 2016) \n296.  Plaintiff Stephan has also been quoted as an expert on protest and police in \nseveral sources, and has written pieces for Gothamist, US Uncut, Alternet, and PINAC News \nregularly since December 4, 2014. \n297.  On the night of December 4, 2014, Plaintiff Stephan proceeded near protesters for \nseveral hours. \n298.  Around or after 1 a.m., as a group of protesters neared 57th Street and Madison \nAvenue, Plaintiff Stephan saw a person with his face down, and at least three police officers on \ntop of him, as at least one officer pressed his knee into the arrestee’s back while apparently \ncuffing him.  \n299.  Plaintiff Stephan saw others gather at the scene to observe the police. \n300.  Plaintiff Stephan did not see people gathered in a way that appeared to interfere \nwith or threaten to interfere with their arrest. \n301.  Plaintiff Stephan then saw a police officer walk over and discharge what he \nbelieved to be pepper spray toward the people who were watching the arrest.  \n302.  Plaintiff Stephan smelled pepper spray and his eyes began burning.  \n303.  Plaintiff Stephan felt sinus pain, itching and burning.    \n304.  Plaintiff Stephan heard no warning before the pepper spray was deployed.   \n305.  Plaintiff Stephan then ran from the scene of the arrests and onto the sidewalk.   \n306.  As Plaintiff Stephan reached the sidewalk, he heard what he believed to be the \n“deterrent” tone of a LRAD.  \n307.  Plaintiff Stephan had no warning before the police began firing the LRAD. \n  42 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 43 of 66\n308.  Plaintiff Stephan moved on 57th Street between Madison and Park as the NYPD \nfired the “deterrent” tone of a LRAD for nearly three minutes. \n309.  Plaintiff Stephan was shocked that the police were using the LRAD, and that they \nwere using its “deterrent” tone rather than its announcement feature.  \n310.  Plaintiff Stephan was particularly surprised because when it was used most people \nhad already responded to the pepper spray by fleeing. \n311.  Plaintiff Stephan felt reverberation and pain while the LRAD was being used.  \n312.  The reverberation went beyond Plaintiff Stephan’s eardrums, going down his ear \ncanal.  \n313.  This was the most traumatic ear pain Plaintiff Stephan has ever experienced.  \n314.  Plaintiff Stephan could not sleep that night, due to the intense ringing and pain in \nhis ears. \n315.  Video that Mr. Stephan took of the LRAD being used on December 5, 2014 was \nsubsequently published by Vice Motherboard. See Alex Pasternack, The New Sound of Crowd \nControl, MOTHERBOARD, December 17, 2014, available at http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-\nnew-sound-of-crowd-control (last visited March 2, 2016). \n316.   After the events of December 5, 2014, when Plaintiff Stephan considers going to \na protest, the pain and fear that the use of the LRAD caused him resurfaces. \n317.  Plaintiff Stephan has considered not going to protests because of this acute pain \nand fear. \n318.  However, Plaintiff Stefan has chosen to fight through his fears and continue to \nattend and report on protests, in part because he believes both activities are so important. \n  43 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 44 of 66\n319.  Plaintiff Stephan was and remains afraid of being exposed to the LRAD again and \nof experiencing permanent hearing damage.   \nPLAINTIFF PLAINTIFF NUSBAUM \n320.  On December 5, 2014, Plaintiff MICHAEL NUSBAUM was a twenty-five-year-\nold, working as a freelance filmmaker and photographer. \n321.  Plaintiff Nusbaum is now a freelance filmmaker and photographer, with a \nBachelor of Science Degree in Film and Television from Boston University. \n322.  On December 5, 2014, Plaintiff Nusbaum was working as a filmmaker to create a \nhistorical documentation of an emerging protest movement, including through film, one aspect of \nwhich was ultimately published as “This Ain’t a Parade” on Vimeo, available at \nhttps://vimeo.com/113821448 (last accessed March 2, 2016) - with the description: “The protest \nmovement in this video is in response to what many see as a failure of the justice system in the \nUnited States: the grand jury decisions not to indict police officers who killed Eric Garner, \nMichael Brown, and others.” \n323.  Plaintiff Nusbaum had a history of tinnitus and hearing loss, and had seen \nmultiple doctors about his hearing conditions prior to December 5, 2014.   \n324.  Plaintiff Nusbaum is particularly vulnerable to loud sounds and to further hearing \ndamage. \n325.  On the night of December 4, 2014, Plaintiff Nusbaum joined with the protests of \nthe non-indictment of the officer involved in Eric Garner’s death.   \n326.  Plaintiff Nusbaum was at the protest both as a filmmaker and as a protester.  \n327.  Plaintiff Nusbaum marched with others for several hours.  \n  44 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 45 of 66\n328.  At some time after 1 a.m. on December 5, 2014, Plaintiff Nusbaum saw people \ngather around the scene of some arrests near 57th Street and Madison Avenue. \n329.  Plaintiff Nusbaum heard something that sounded like a glass bottle breaking. \n330.  Plaintiff Nusbaum then heard someone say that they had been pepper sprayed.  \n331.  At this point, Plaintiff Nusbaum heard what he now believes was the “deterrent” \ntone of a LRAD. \n332.  After Plaintiff Nusbaum heard the LRAD fire, he saw people fleeing from it.  \n333.  Plaintiff Nusbaum heard the LRAD broadcast a message saying in substance that \n“This is the New York City Police Department, you must remain on the sidewalk.” \n334.  Plaintiff Nusbaum heard parts of this message broadcast repeatedly, apparently \ndirected at him and other people who were already on the sidewalk. \n335.  The LRAD was approximately 15 feet away from the closest protesters and from \nPlaintiff Nusbaum. \n336.  Plaintiff Nusbaum had earplugs in his backpack, which he carries with him \nbecause his hearing issues mean that it is very dangerous and painful for him to be exposed to \nloud sounds.  \n337.  Plaintiff Nusbaum put in his earplugs and began filming to document the LRAD \nuse.  \n338.  Plaintiff Nusbaum began filming approximately 30 seconds after he first heard the \nLRAD being used, and continued filming for approximately two and a half minutes, during \nwhich time the LRAD and its deterrent function were used almost continuously.  \n  45 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 46 of 66\n339.  However, because there was no warning or indication that the LRAD would be \nused, his ears were exposed to sounds at volume levels and proximities that are very dangerous \nand deleterious because of his pre-existing hearing condition.  \n340.  “This Ain’t a Parade” (https://vimeo.com/113821448 (last accessed March 2, \n2016)) is the published product of the filmmaking project Plaintiff Nusbaum was working on \nwhen he was assaulted with the LRAD. \n341.  When the LRAD’s “deterrent” tone was first used near plaintiff Nusbaum, he \nexperienced what he would describe as a 10 out of 10 pain in his ears.  \n342.  Plaintiff Nusbaum has had to get an MRI test for his hearing before, and this was \nlouder than being in an MRI machine.  \n343.  Because of his fear that he will be hit by an LRAD and injured again, Mr. \nNusbaum has attended many fewer protests since December 5, 2014. \n344.  Plaintiff Nusbaum works as a photographer at music concerts, and the sound of \nthe LRAD was much louder and more painful than anything he had ever heard before. \n345.  Since December 5, 2014, the ringing in Plaintiff Nusbaum’s right ear that he had \nexperienced has been much more noticeable, and he hears a slight ringing at all times. \nPLAINTIFF ALEXANDER APPEL \n346.  Plaintiff ALEXANDER APPEL is a long-time activist with a history of \nexpressing his political views, among other ways, by participating in street marches and other \ndemonstrations.    \n347.  In November and early December of 2014, Plaintiff Appel had been frequently \nattending demonstrations and marches against police brutality.  \n  46 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 47 of 66\n348.  On December 4, 2014, he joined a protest in response to the Staten Island grand \njury’s failure to indict the police officer involved in the death of Eric Garner. \n349.  Plaintiff Appel began marching with the protest around nine p.m., starting at \naround 8th Avenue and 14th Street in Manhattan. \n350.  Plaintiff Appel marched in Manhattan with others for several hours.  \n351.  The protesters were escorted by police. \n352.  At around 1 a.m., Plaintiff Appel reached the corner of Madison Avenue and 57th \nStreet.  \n353.  Plaintiff Appel saw police vehicles in the middle of the intersection and continued \naround the police vehicles, heading toward Park Avenue.  \n354.  Plaintiff Appel heard people yelling and turned around.  \n355.  Plaintiff Appel saw police had grabbed two or three people who had been \ncrossing through intersection like everyone else had been.  \n356.  Plaintiff Appel returned to the corner of Madison Avenue and 57th Street to \nobserve the arrests. \n357.  Plaintiff Appel smelled in the air what he believed was pepper spray and saw \npolice brandishing batons and swinging their batons.  \n358.  After Plaintiff Appel smelled the pepper spray, he saw those who were observing \nthe police move away from them and disperse, with people going in different directions.   \n359.  Plaintiff Appel moved east on 57th Street toward Park Avenue.  \n360.  Plaintiff Appel paused to care for someone who had been pepper sprayed, whom \nhe heard ask for help.   \n  47 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 48 of 66\n361.  As Plaintiff Appel stopped to try to assist the pepper spray victim next to him, he \nheard what he believed to be the “deterrent” tone of a LRAD.  \n362.  Plaintiff Appel remembers police saying words into the LRAD, but it was very \nhard for him to make out what the police were saying, in part because they were speaking at the \nsame time as the deterrent tone was deployed.  \n363.  Plaintiff Appel believed that the officers wanted people to move onto the \nsidewalk. \n364.  Plaintiff Appel moved onto the sidewalk. \n365.  Plaintiff Appel tried to cover his ears with both of his hands, but it was very hard \nas he was simultaneously trying to care for the person who had been pepper sprayed and to \nphysically move away from the LRAD and onto a sidewalk.  \n366.  It was also hard for Plaintiff Appel to move away from the sound of the LRAD, as \nthere was construction on the side of the street where he was, and it was hard to get from the \nstreet onto the sidewalk, especially with a person who had been temporarily blinded.  \n367.  After being impacted by the LRAD, Plaintiff Appel immediately developed a very \nsevere headache.   \n368.  This headache lasted for 3 days, until December 7, 2014. \n369.  After hearing the LRAD, Plaintiff Appel’s ears began ringing.  \n370.  Plaintiff Appel had extreme difficulty with his hearing for 3 days, until December \n7, 2014. \n371.  Because of his difficulty hearing and ringing in his ears, Plaintiff Appel sought \nmedical treatment the next day at Mt. Sinai Eye and Ear Infirmary.   \n  48 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 49 of 66\n372.  At Mt. Sinai Eye and Ear Infirmary, Dr. Christopher Linstrom diagnosed Plaintiff \nAppel with hearing loss, explaining that the pressure of the extreme level of the noise from the \nLRAD had pushed a bone in his ear inwards, impacting and damaging a nerve in his ear.   \n373.  Dr. Christopher Linstrom prescribed steroidal medication, Prednisone, to try to \nhelp heal the damaged nerves in Plaintiff Appel’s ear before the nerve damage became \npermanent.   \n374.  A test that date indicated that Plaintiff Appel’s hearing was not balanced, and was \nsofter in his right ear than his left ear. \n375.  A few days later, Plaintiff Appel returned to see Dr. Melissa Magnolia at the Eye \nand Ear Infirmary for a follow up visit.   \n376.  The prognosis was improved, and Plaintiff Appel was told that the nerve damage \nwas healing and his ears were recovering.  \n377.  Because of his experience with the LRAD, Plaintiff Appel became very \nconcerned about hearing loss and nerve damage and no longer feels comfortable going to \nprotests.   \n378.  Plaintiff Appel is very worried that an LRAD will be directed at him again, and \nthat the condition in his ears will worsen.   \n379.  Because of his fears of further pain and hearing damage from the NYPD’s use of \nan LRAD, Plaintiff Appel has avoided marches which he would have otherwise attended and \nparticipated in. \n380.  Plaintiff Appel still experiences ringing in his ears. \nFIRST GROUND FOR RELIEF \nUNREASONABLE SEIZURE – EXCESSIVE FORCE \nFOURTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS THROUGH 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n  49 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 50 of 66\n381.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding and \nfollowing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n382.  Defendants Maguire and Poletto terminated or severely limited Plaintiffs’ \nfreedom of movement utilizing the LRAD. \n383.  Defendants seized Plaintiffs without privilege or lawful justification.  \n384.  Defendants had no judicial warrant authorizing Plaintiffs’ seizures. \n385.  Plaintiffs were conscious of the confinements and did not consent to them. \n386.  Defendants used force against Plaintiffs by deploying the LRAD against them. \n387.  Defendants did not have lawful cause to detain or arrest Plaintiffs. \n388.  Nor was it objectively reasonable for Defendants to believe that they did have \nsuch cause to detain or arrest Plaintiffs.  \n389.  The levels of force employed by Defendants Maguire and Poletto in using the \nLRAD, and in particular in using its “deterrent” tone without prior warning, unreasonably close \nto people, for unreasonably long periods of time, were objectively unreasonable. \n390.  As seizures of and uses of force against Plaintiffs, the NYPD’s uses of the LRAD \nwere unjustified and unreasonable under the circumstances.  \n391.  The LRAD was used as a weapon without reasonable notice and without \nproviding a meaningful opportunity to disperse beyond the range of the LRAD and therefore \navoid injury.  \n392.  The LRAD was used in circumstances where there was no imminent threat to \npublic safety or property and/or where its use was not necessary to protect public safety or \nproperty.  \n  50 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 51 of 66\n393.  Defendants’ uses of the LRAD were not only in contravention of best practices \nregarding crowd control and use of force, but also in violation of the NYPD’s use of force \nrequirements that “All members of the service at the scene of a police incident must:…(b) use \nminimal necessary force,” as reflected in the relevant provisions of the NYPD’s Patrol Guide, \nSection 203-11, that was in effect at all times relevant herein (emphasis in original). \n394.  Because the LRAD is designed to target large areas, it necessarily targets more \nthan one person, if more than one person is within that area.  \n395.  When the LRAD is implemented to force behavior modification or compliance \n(for example, to compel people to stop moving in a direction or to move in a particular \ndirection), it impacts their ability to move freely. \n396.  Put more simply, use of the LRAD as a weapon seizes not just one individual, but \nall people in an area, and in so doing does away with the requirements of individualized probable \ncause and individualized justifications for appropriate and proportionate use of force. \n397.  As a result of the acts and omissions complained of herein, Plaintiffs suffered the \ninjuries and deprivations of their constitutional and common law rights discussed herein. \nSECOND GROUND FOR RELIEF \nVIOLATIONS OF PLAINTIFFS’ FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS \nFIRST AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS THROUGH 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n398.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding and \nfollowing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n399.  Defendants engaged in the acts and omissions complained of herein in retaliation \nfor Plaintiffs’ protected conduct and/or speech, including their protected conduct and/or speech \nin being near, participating in, or observing and/or documenting protests and police responses to \nthem. \n  51 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 52 of 66\n400.  Defendants engaged in the acts and omissions complained of herein in order to \nprevent Plaintiffs from continuing to engage in such protected conduct. \n401.  Defendants engaged in the acts and omissions complained of herein in order to \nprevent and/or discourage Plaintiffs from engaging in similar protected conduct in the future. \n402.  Each Plaintiff suffered actual chill in that each Plaintiff was prevented and /or \ndeterred from or impeded in participating in protected conduct on the date of and after the \nincident. \n403.  In addition to being retaliatory, the restrictions imposed by Defendants Maguire \nand Poletto on Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights complained of herein were: \na.  Not content-neutral and lacked narrowly tailoring to promote a \ncompelling government interest; and/or \n \nb.  Content-neutral, but lacked narrow tailoring to serve a significant \ngovernmental interest and/or failed to provide ample alternatives for \nexpression; and/or \n \nc.  Afforded Defendants unbridled discretion to limit or deny Plaintiffs’ \nabilities to engage in protected conduct (also raising constitutionally \nsignificant vagueness and overbreadth concerns). \n \n404.  The uses of force and other regulations imposed on Plaintiffs by Defendants \nMaguire and Poletto interfered with Plaintiffs’ rights to speech, expression, assembly, and/or to \nengage in observing and/or documenting newsworthy events including, but not limited to, \nprotests against police brutality and police responses to them. \n405.  With respect to those Plaintiffs who intended to observe and document with a \nview toward disseminating documentation of protests and/or police responses thereto and/or \notherwise newsworthy images, video, sounds, and/or commentary, those uses of force and other \nregulations prevented such Plaintiffs from engaging in the “gathering” of such images, video, \n  52 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 53 of 66\nsounds, and/or commentary, which is a necessary and protected prerequisite to the protected \ndissemination those Plaintiffs ultimately intended to engage in. \n406.  Even assuming, arguendo, that the physical regulations on freedom of movement \nimposed on Plaintiffs when they were fired on by the LRAD were content neutral, absent a very \nsmall subset of extremely exigent circumstances, the use of an LRAD for crowd control purposes \nwill almost always result in overbroad or over-inclusive regulation of protected conduct, because \nthe restrictions imposed by the haphazard applications of the LRAD’s force are almost always \nnot narrowly tailored to serve significant governmental interests, and almost always fail to \nprovide ample alternatives for expression.  \n407.  Additionally, the NYPD’s practices with respect to LRAD uses  - including the \nlack of written guidelines and policies and appropriate training and supervision regarding LRAD \nuse - fail to provide adequate safeguards to prevent NYPD officers on the streets from enjoying \nand exercising unbridled, unreviewable discretion to suppress protected speech and conduct, thus \nviolating constitutional prohibitions against viewpoint discrimination and other, related \nguarantees.  \n408.  As a result of the acts and omissions complained of herein, Plaintiffs suffered the \ninjuries and deprivations of their constitutional and common law rights discussed herein. \nTHIRD GROUND FOR RELIEF \nVIOLATIONS OF PLAINTIFFS’ RIGHTS TO EQUAL PROTECTION AND \nSUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS \nFOURTEENTH AMENDMENT THROUGH 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n409.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding and \nfollowing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n  53 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 54 of 66\n410.  Defendants’ acts and omissions described elsewhere herein violated Plaintiffs’ \nrights to enjoy equal protection of the laws as well as their substantive due process rights, \nincluding their liberty interests. \n411.  As a result of the acts and omissions complained of herein, Plaintiffs suffered the \ninjuries and deprivations of their constitutional and common law rights discussed herein. \nFOURTH GROUND FOR RELIEF \nMUNICIPAL LIABILITY \n \n412.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding and \nfollowing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n413.  At all times relevant herein, the NYPD has lacked written crowd control, disorder \ncontrol, and crowd management policies, documentation requirements, or supervision \nmechanisms, and has not properly trained its officers and agents, related to LRAD use.   \n414.  At all times relevant herein, the NYPD has lacked written policies, and has not \nproperly trained its officers and agents, defining “breach of the peace” or describing when there \nis imminent or clear and present danger of such a breach of the peace.  \n415.  Upon information and belief, NYPD policies, training, and practice in December \nof 2014 permitted, authorized, and/or encouraged NYPD officers to use LRADs for: \na.  Seizures and arrests, including of perceived “groups,” in connection with \npeaceful, expressive assemblies, where no breach of the peace has occurred \nand where there was no imminent, clear and present danger of such a breach \nof the peace \n \nb.  Treatment of perceived “groups” as a “unit” for crowd control purposes \nwithout first having given them fair warning \n \nc.  Treatment of perceived “groups” as a “unit” for crowd control purposes \nwithout first having given them lawful and  \n \ni.  Clearly audible dispersal orders, meaning  \n \n  54 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 55 of 66\nii.  Clearly identified as such \n \niii.  Providing specific time periods that are reasonable under the \ncircumstances within which compliance can be accomplished without \nfear of use of force or arrest; and \n \niv.  Providing specific, clear means of safe egress  \n \nd.  Seizures, including seizures of perceived “groups”, without such forewarning, \nand without individualized determinations of probable cause, meaning \nindividualized suspicion of wrongdoing as opposed to mere perceived \npresence associated with the perceived “group” \n \ne.  Arrests, including mass arrests, of perceived “groups”, without such \nforewarning, and without individualized determinations of probable cause \n \nf.  Uses of force against perceived “groups”, without such forewarning, and \nwithout individualized determinations of reasonableness \n \ng.  Other restrictions on First Amendment rights that are not content-neutral or \nthat are content- neutral but lack narrow tailoring and fail to provide alternate \nchannels for the protected expression or conduct, such as to enforce evincing a \n“zero tolerance” approach to perceived traffic infractions in connection with \ndemonstrations, or orders to “move on” or to disperse that shut down \nprotected communication and expression \n \nh.  Other restrictions on the rights to move freely, liberty rights, privacy rights, \nrights to be left alone, other related Substantive Due Process guarantees, \nand/or rights to Equal Protection of perceived participants in, or bystanders \nnear, persons perceived to be engaged in peaceful protest, demonstration, or \nassembly activities \n \n416.  At all times relevant herein, the NYPD has lacked written policies, training, \ndocumentation requirements, and supervision mechanisms related to LRAD uses qua restrictions \non First Amendment rights of participants in protected expression and association, as well as \nbystanders and observers, including bystanders and observers who wish to observe, record, or \notherwise document the police activities of uniformed NYPD officers performed in public \nplaces. \n  55 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 56 of 66\n417.  United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) submissions in federal litigation36 \nrelating to the rights to observe and document the activities, including the arrest activities, of \nuniformed police performing police duties in public places, reflect that the rights to observe \nand/or document those activities are so fundamental that the United States felt compelled to \ninform the courts in those cases of its “position on the basic elements of a constitutionally \nadequate policy on individuals’ right to record police activity,” insisting that any resolution of \nthe injunctive relief claims at issue in the Sharp case, for example,  \ninclude policy and training requirements that are consistent with the important \nFirst, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights at stake when individuals record \npolice officers in the public discharge of their duties. These rights, subject to \nnarrowly-defined restrictions, engender public confidence in our police \ndepartments, promote public access to information necessary to hold our \ngovernmental officers accountable, and ensure public and officer safety.  \n \nSharp Letter at p. 1; see also id. at p. 2 (recommending that appropriate policies “should \naffirmatively set forth the contours of individuals’ First Amendment right to observe and record \npolice officers”); pp. 5-7 (recognizing that “[t]he right to record police activity is limited only by \n‘reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions’” (internal citations omitted)). \n389.  And in the Garcia SOI, the DOJ urged the Court to “find that both the First and \nFourth Amendments protect an individual who peacefully photographs police activity on a public \nstreet” and, in recognition of its “strong interest in ensuring that individuals’ constitutional rights \nare protected when they observe and document police carrying out their duties in a public \nsetting”, expressed its \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n36   See, e.g., Statement of Interest of the United States dated January 10, 2012, ECF No. 24 \nin Sharp v. Baltimore City Police Dept., Civil No. 1:11-cv-02888-BEL (D.Md.), and May 12, \n2012 letter filed by United States Department of Justice – Civil Rights Division – Special \nLitigation Section in Sharp, (the “Sharp Letter”); Statement of Interest of the United States dated \nMarch 4, 2013, ECF No. 15 in Garcia v.

The United States believes that courts should view such \ncharges skeptically to ensure that individuals’ First Amendment rights are \nprotected. Core First Amendment conduct, such as recording a police officer \nperforming duties on a public street, cannot be the sole basis for such charges. \nThird, the First Amendment rights to record police officers performing public \nduties extends to both the public and members of the media, and the Court should \nnot make a distinction between the public’s and the media’s rights to record here. \n \nGarcia SOI at pp. 1-2. \n418.  At all times relevant herein, Defendant Bratton has been the Commissioner of the \nNYPD and as such he has final policymaking authority over all aspects of the NYPD, including \nrelated to LRAD uses. \n419.  In connection with plans to police Black Lives Matter and other anti-police \nbrutality protests in late 2014, Defendant Bratton and/or other policymakers for Defendant City \ndeveloped, adopted, and/or endorsed formal policies – which continue to the present - of \ndeploying LRADs for use in crowd control and other police responses to perceived protests, \nwithout first having conducted appropriate testing, created and implemented written guidelines \nand training, including reporting requirements, regarding their use, and creating and \nimplementing appropriate supervision structures for NYPD agents who use LRADs, although \nDefendants Bratton and City knew or should have known that outfitting police with a dangerous \nsound weapon such as an LRAD, without taking such steps, would lead to injuries, including \nPlaintiffs’. \n420.  For example, Defendants Bratton and City knew or should have known that \npurchasing LRADs, and directing and allowing NYPD officers to use LRADs without doing \nsome or all of the following things, would lead to injuries, including Plaintiffs’: \n  57 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 58 of 66\na.  Conducting appropriate research into prior documented LRAD uses for crowd \ncontrol purposes, including, but not limited to, the LRAD uses at the 2009 G20 in \nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania that led to injuries and the proposed  2010 G20 in Toronto, \nCanada  \n \nb.  Conducting appropriate testing regarding safe use of LRADs as “megaphones” as \nwell as LRADs’ “deterrent” tone \n \nc.  Promulgating written guidelines regarding LRAD use covering at least: \n \ni.  Safe operation of an LRAD \n \nii.  That, how, and when LRAD use counts as a use of force, as well as how the \nLRAD, qua use of force, fits into the use of force continuum, including the \nNYPD’s use of force guidelines and their reporting requirements \n \niii.  That, how, and when using the LRAD can amount to a “group” seizure \n \niv.  When, how (including at what volumes, distances, frequencies), and under \nwhich specific and limited circumstances, the LRAD may be used as a crowd \ncontrol tool, taking into account specific objective factors bearing on the First, \nFourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights of participants in expressive \nassemblies as well as observers and bystanders, including the rights and \nprivileges enjoyed by Plaintiffs and others similarly situated to be on or \naround streets and sidewalks in the City of New York, to associate, to \nassemble, to express themselves, and to gather and disseminate information \nfreely, without interference from police \n \nd.  Designing and implementing training consistent with those written guidelines in safe \nand appropriate use of the LRAD, and guaranteeing that the training is given to \nofficers who are to be charged with LRAD uses; \n \ne.  Ensuring that there are appropriate requirements and structures in place for \ndocumenting LRAD uses and guaranteeing that documentation is created; and  \n \nf.  Ensuring that there are appropriate requirements and structures in place for \nsupervising agents who use LRADs, and actually supervising them. \n \n421.  Defendant Bratton and/or other policymakers directed that the policies and/or \npractices that caused Plaintiffs’ injuries be adopted and employed, approved in adopting and \nemploying the policies, and/or acquiesced in their adoption and employment. \n  58 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 59 of 66\n422.  To the extent Defendants may not consider the deployment of officers with \nLRADs at liberty to use them without appropriate restrictions, without having taken due care by \ntaking some or all of those steps, or other reasonable measures, as “official policies”, between \nlate 2014 and the present, as practices complained of, the deployment and use LRADs is now so \nconsistent and widespread, that Defendant Bratton and other NYPD policymakers had actual or \nconstructive knowledge that LRADs are routinely deployed and used in policing perceived \ndemonstrations and other First Amendment assemblies, without appropriate research, testing, \nguidelines, training, documentation, and/or supervision. \n423.  In fact, as seen above, although Defendant Bratton and other policymakers knew \nof the LRAD uses that injured Plaintiffs in December of 2014, and despite the extensive \nDecember 12, 2014 written complaint describing those injuries, providing video of the LRAD \nuses, and linking Plaintiffs’ injuries to Defendants’ failures to ensure proper research, testing, \nguidelines, training, documentation, and/or supervision related to LRADs and LRAD uses, \nDefendant Bratton and other policymakers not only failed to take steps to cure those problems, \nbut also defended them in a public statement to The New York Times and then actually increased \nthe frequency of LRAD deployments – and uses - at perceived demonstrations, protests, and \nother, similar assemblies that the NYPD considers “special events”. \n424.  Defendant Bratton and other policymakers, including NYPD Deputy \nCommissioner of Legal Matters Lawrence Byrne, acquiesced in, approved of, ratified, and/or \ncondoned the LRAD uses that injured Plaintiffs on December 5, 2014, and the lack of proper \nresearch, testing, guidelines, training, documentation, and/or supervision that led to Plaintiffs’ \ninjuries. \n  59 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 60 of 66\n425.  On December 4-5, 2014, as a DCU supervisor who was assigned to use the LRAD \nin connection with policing the protests that night, Defendant Maguire was responsible for \ndeveloping and implementing final policy for the NYPD in the areas of when and how to use the \nLRAD. \n426.  On December 4-5, 2014, as a DCU agent who was assigned to use the LRAD in \nconnection with policing the protests that night, Defendant Poletto was responsible for \ndeveloping and implementing final policy for the NYPD in the areas of when and how to use the \nLRAD. \n427.  Upon information and belief, on December 4-5, 2014, Defendants Maguire and \nPoletto did not consult any supervisors to obtain permission or direction before using the LRAD. \n428.  On December 4-5, 2014, the decisions made by Defendants Maguire and Poletto \nto use the LRAD, and regarding how to use the LRAD, were effectively final policy with respect \nto those LRAD uses. \n429.  As a result of those NYPD policies and practices regarding LRAD uses adopted \nin late 2014, since late 2014, NYPD agents have consistently deployed and used LRADs at \nperceived protests and demonstrations, without sufficient research, testing, guidelines, training, \ndocumentation, and/or supervision, threatening further injuries such as those suffered by \nPlaintiffs to Plaintiffs and others who may wish to attend perceived demonstrations, protests, and \nother events at which the NYPD deploys LRADs . \n430.  Defendants City, Bratton, and Maguire failed properly to train and/or supervise \nDefendants Maguire and Poletto regarding LRAD uses, including the December 2014 LRAD \nuses that injured Plaintiffs, and Defendants City and Bratton have failed properly to train and/or \nsupervise NYPD officers charged with using LRADs since 2014. \n  60 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 61 of 66\n431.  Defendants’ failure to train and/or supervise NYPD agents related to LRAD uses \nevince a hostility and/or deliberate indifference to the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment \nrights of perceived protesters, bystanders, and other members of the public who come into \ncontact with NYPD officers brandishing and using LRADs and who are thus exposed to being \ninjured by the LRAD, including Plaintiffs. \n432.  As a result of the acts and omissions complained of herein, Plaintiffs suffered the \ninjuries and deprivations of their constitutional and common law rights discussed herein. \nFIFTH GROUND FOR RELIEF \nASSAULT AND BATTERY \nUNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK \n \n433.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding and \nfollowing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n434.  Defendants Maguire and Poletto committed assaulted within the meaning of New \nYork common law against Plaintiffs by intentionally placing Plaintiffs in fear of imminent \nharmful or offensive contact. \n435.  Defendants Maguire and Poletto committed battery within the meaning of New \nYork common law against Plaintiffs by intentionally physically contacting Plaintiffs without \nPlaintiffs’ consent. \n436.  Defendants Maguire and Poletto did thereby inflict assault and battery upon the \nPlaintiffs.  \n437.  Defendants’ acts and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of injury and \ndamage to the Plaintiffs and violated their rights as guaranteed by the laws and Constitution of \nthe State of New York. \n  61 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 62 of 66\n438.

The conduct of the police officials alleged herein occurred while they were on \nduty and/or in and during the course and scope of their duties and functions as police officials, \nand/or while they were acting as agents and employees of Defendant City, clothed with and/or \ninvoking state power and/or authority, and, as a result, Defendant City is liable to Plaintiffs \npursuant to the state common law doctrine of respondeat superior. \n  64 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-RWS   Document 21   Filed 08/03/16   Page 65 of 66\n459.

As  set  forth  below,  the \nmotion  is  granted. \nPrior  Proceedings \nThe  factual  background  and  prior  proceedings  of  this  matter \nhave  been  set  forth  in  the  Court's  previous  decision  granting  in \npart  and  denying  in  part  Defendants'  motion  to  dismiss \nPlaintiff's  First Amended  Complaint  (\"FAC\").

The  following \nsummary  retells  portions  of  prior proceedings  as  are  relevant  to \nthe  instant  motion. \n1 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-JMF   Document 66   Filed 08/31/17   Page 3 of 10\nOn  March  3,  2016,  Plaintiffs  commenced  this  action. \n(Dkt.  No.  1.)  On  August  1,  2016,  Plaintiffs  filed  their  FAC. \n(Dkt.  No.  21.)  On  October  24,  2016,  Defendants  moved  to  dismiss \nPlaintiffs'  FAC,  (Dkt.  No.  35),  which  on  May  31,  2017,  the  Court \ngranted  in  part  and  denied  in  part,  (Dkt.  No.  53).  Specifically, \nthe  Court  denied  Defendants'  motion  as  to  Plaintiffs'  claims  of \nexcessive  force  as  to  the  Officers,  municipal  liability as  to \nNYC  for  failure  to  properly  train,  and  state  law  claims  for \nassault  and  battery  as  to  the  Officers.  (See  id.,  at  40.) \nOn  June  30,  2017,  Defendants'  filed  notice  of  an \ninterlocutory  appeal  on  the  issue  of  the  Officers'  qualified \nimmunity  defense.  (Dkt.  No.  57.) \nOn  July  5,  2017,  Defendants  moved  to  stay  all  proceedings \nbefore  this  Court  pending  resolution  of  its  interlocutory \nappeal.  (Dkt.  No.  58.)  On  August  2,  2017,  Defendants'  instant \nmotion  was  heard  and  marked  fully  submitted. \nDefendants'  Motion  to  Stay  is Granted \nIn  light  of  their  interlocutory  appeal,  Defendants'  have \nmoved  to  stay  all  proceedings  before  this  Court  as  to \n2 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-JMF   Document 66   Filed 08/31/17   Page 4 of 10\nPlaintiffs'  claims  because  of  the  claims'  factual  and  legal \ninterconnectedness.  Defendants  argue  a  stay  is  warranted  either \nbecause  the  issue  of  the  Officers'  qualified  immunity \nautomatically divested  the  Court  of  jurisdiction pending  that \nappeal's  resolution  or,  in  the  alternative,  that  Defendants' \ninterlocutory  appeal  merits  a  discretionary  stay.  Plaintiffs \nappear  not  to  argue  that  while  the  law  supports  Defendants' \nclaim to  a  point-namely,  that  this  Court  has  been  divested  of \njurisdiction as  to  the  Officers'  excessive  force  claim due  to \ntheir appeal  regarding  federal  qualified  immunity-such  authority \ncannot  be  stretched  to  the  length  that  Defendants  seek. \nThe  collateral  order  doctrine  is an  exception  to  the \ngeneral  rule  that  interlocutory  orders  are  not  appealable  as  a \nmatter  of  right;  as  a  general  rule,  the  doctrine  is  limited  to \ncourt  orders  affecting  rights  that  will  be  irretrievably \n~trial \nlost  in  the  absence  of  an  immediate  appeal.\"  Richardson-Merrell \nInc.  v.  Koller,  472  U.S.  424,  430-31  (1985). \n~[O]rder[s] \nrejecting  the  defense  of  qualified  immunity  at  either  the \ndismissal  stage  or  the  summary  judgment  stage\"  are  examples  of \nthe  limited  sort  ~subject to  [interlocutory]  appeal.\"  Betances \nv.

As \nappeals  under  the  collateral  order  doctrine  are  to  be,  by \ndefinition,  \"completely  separate  from  the  merits  of  the  action,\" \nsuch  appeals  do  \"not  generally divest  the  district  court  of \njurisdiction over  issues  not  under  consideration  in  the  appeal.\" \nCity  of  N.Y.  v.  Beretta  U.S.A.  Corp.,  234  F.R.D.  46,  50 \n(E.D.N.Y.  2006);  see  also  N.Y.S.  Nat.  Org.  for  Women  v.  Terry, \n886  F.2d  1339,  1350  (2d  Cir.  1989)  (noting  that  \"the  filing  of  a \nnotice  of  appeal  only  divests  the  district  court  of  jurisdiction \nrespecting  the  questions  raised  and  decided  in  the  order  that  is \non  appeal\") . \nAs  a  starting point,  this  authority  establishes  that  a  stay \nas  to  Plaintiff's  excessive  force  claims  against  the  Officers \npending  Defendants'  federal  qualified  immunity  claim  is merited. \nSee  In  reS.  Afr.  Apartheid  Litig.,  No.  02  Civ.  4712  (SAS),  2009 \nWL  5183832,  at  *1  (S.D.N.Y.  July  7,  2009)  (citing  Beretta,  234 \nF.R.D.  at  50)  (noting  that  qualified  immunity  interlocutory \nappeals  automatically  divest  district  court  jurisdiction  over \nthat  issue).  On  this  point,  Plaintiffs  do  not  argue  otherwise. \n4 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-JMF   Document 66   Filed 08/31/17   Page 6 of 10\nThe  surviving  state  law  claims  against  the  Officers  should \nsimilarly be  stayed.  Although  Plaintiffs  have  noted  that  the \nlegal  requirements  as  to  federal  and  state  qualified  immunity \ndefenses  are  not  identical,  at  their  root,  both  can  turn  on  the \n\"reasonableness\"  of  the  actions  and,  as  here,  Plaintiffs'  state \nclaims  could  be  heavily  connected  with  \"the  same  facts  that  form \nthe  heart  of  the  federal  claims.\"  Jones  v.  Parmley,  465  F.3d  46, \n64  (2d  Cir.  2006)  (citing  Simpkin  v.  City  of  Troy,  224  A.D.2d \n897,  898,  638  N.Y.S.2d  231,  232  (3d  Dep't  1996))  (noting  the \nrelationship  between  federal  and  state  qualified  immunity  and \nthat  reasonableness  was  \"at  the  center  of  the  district  court's \nFourth  Amendment  excessive  force  analysis\").  As  there  will \nlikely be  overlap  between  each  of  Plaintiffs'  claims,  a  stay  as \nto  the  state  law  claims  against  the  Officers  is  therefore  also \nmerited  pending  resolution  of  Defendants'  appeal. \nThe  relationship  between  Plaintiffs'  excessive  force \nagainst  the  Officers  and  their Monell  claims  against  NYC \nwarrants  a  different  analysis  but  reaches  the  same  result. 1 \nPlaintiffs principally argue  that,  even  if claims  against  the \nOfficers  are  automatically  divested,  the  Second  Circuit's  ruling \n1  See  Monell  v.  N.Y.C.  Dep't  of  Soc.

Doe  No.  1,  727  F.3d  248  (2d  Cir.  2013),  severs  the \nlegal  connection  the  appeal's  outcome  might  have  on  their  Monell \nclaim.  In  Askins,  the  Second  Circuit  found  that  even  if \ndefendant  officers  are  entitled to  the  protection  of  qualified \nimmunity,  such  a  finding  can  be  \"irrelevant  to  the  liability of \nthe  municipality\"  because  a  municipality  could  still be  liable \nif it \"adopt(ed]  customs  or  policies  that  violate[d]  federal  law \nand  result(ed]  in  tortious  violation  of  a  plaintiff's  rights, \nregardless  of  whether  it was  clear  at  the  time  of  the  adoption \nof  the  policy or  at  the  time  of  the  tortious  conduct  that  such \nconduct  would  violate  the  plaintiff's  rights.\"  Id.  at  254 \n(quoting  Owen  v.  City  of  Indep.,  Mo.,  445  U.S.  622,  657  (1980)). \nPlaintiffs  likewise  cite  Barrett  v.  Orange  Cty.  Human  Rights \nComm'n,  194  F.3d  341  (2d  Cir.  1999),  in  further  support  of  the \nseverability of  their  individual  and  municipal  claims.  Id.  at \n350  (holding  that  \"Monell  municipal  liability for  constitutional \ninjuries  may  be  found  to  exist  even  in  the  absence  of  individual \nliability,  at  least  so  long  as  the  injuries  complained  of  are \nnot  solely  attributable  to  the  actions  of  named  individual \ndefendants\") . \nWhile  such  authority may  be  of  use  to  Plaintiff  in  this \naction  at  some  later point,  it is  inapposite  at  present.  Most \nimportantly,  the  facts  undergirding  Plaintiffs'  authority  are \n6 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-JMF   Document 66   Filed 08/31/17   Page 8 of 10\nsubstantively different  than  those  present  here.  In  Askins,  the \ncircuit  court  specifically noted  that  the  district  court  had \nfound  that  there  had  been  no  constitutional  violation  by  the \nindividual  officer  defendant,  but  only  that  he  was  entitled to \nqualified  immunity  because  the  actions  were  reasonable.  Askins, \n727  F.3d  at  252,  255.  In  Barrett,  the  circuit  court  held  that \n\"Monell  municipal  liability for  constitutional  injuries  may  be \nfound  to  exist  even  in  the  absence  of  individual  liability,  at \nleast  so  long  as  the  injuries  complained  of  are  not  solely \nattributable  to  the  actions  of  named  individual  defendants,\" \nBarrett,  194  F.3d  at  349. \nSuch  are  not  the  facts  here.  Plaintiffs  have  only  alleged \nthe  named  Officers  to  have  caused  Plaintiffs'  injuries,  unlike \nBarrett,  and  it remains  to  be  determined  whether  a \nconstitutional  violation  occurred  due  to  the  Officers'  actions, \nunlike  Askins.  These  are  meaningful  differences.  Whether  or  not \na  constitutional  violation  occurred  is  one  of  the  very  questions \n\"under  consideration\"  and  before  the  Second  Circuit  on  appeal. \nBeretta,  234  F.R.D.  at  50.  Moreover,  the  answer  to  that  question \nhas  the  potential  to  form  the  basis  of  the  court's  appellate \ndecision.  Were  the  Second  Circuit  to  find  qualified  immunity  on \nthe  grounds  that  the  Officers  did  not  commit  a  constitutional \nviolation,  there  could  be  no  Monell  claim.  See  Curley  v.  Vill. \n7 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01652-JMF   Document 66   Filed 08/31/17   Page 9 of 10\nof  Suffern,  268  F.3d  65,  71  (2d  Cir.  2001)  (\"[W]e  have \nrecognized  that  a  municipality  cannot  be  liable  for  inadequate \ntraining  or  supervision  when  the  officers  involved  in  making  an \narrest  did  not  violate  the  plaintiff's  constitutional  rights\"). \nAs  a  district  court  can  retain  jurisdiction only  over \n\"'collateral'  matters  not  involved  in  the  appeal,\"  this  Court \nalso  cannot  maintain  jurisdiction  over  proceedings  as  to \nPlaintiffs'  Monell  claim  until  Defendants'  appeal  has  concluded. \nGarcia  v.

Factual History \nOn an interlocutory appeal from the denial of qualified immunity, our \njurisdiction is limited to deciding whether, based on facts alleged by the plaintiffs \nor stipulated to by the parties, “the immunity defense is established as a matter \nof law.” Salim v. Proulx, 93 F.3d 86, 90 (2d Cir. 1996). For purposes of this appeal, \nthe defendants accept as true the allegations set forth in this factual history.  \nA.  LRAD Technology and the NYPD \nLRADs are acoustic weapons developed for the U.S. military in the wake \nof the deadly terrorist attack on the USS Cole in 2000. “If mounted aboard a Navy \nship, the device’s loudspeaker could be used to ‘warn off’ boats that came too \nclose. If those warnings are ignored, the device could be used to send out sound \nat a dangerously high level . . . to cause pain/hearing damage to try to repel the \nattack.” First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) ¶ 11. This technique, known as “area \ndenial,” has been used in both military and crowd control settings. Id. \nAn LRAD can produce louder sound than a traditional amplification \ndevice, such as a megaphone, and can project over much greater distances. To \nachieve this effect, LRADs concentrate sound into a 30‐ to 45‐degree cone‐shaped \n \n4 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page5 of 46\n \nbeam. They also reshape acoustic energy to produce flatter sound waves that (1) \nreduce dampening as the wave travels and (2) interact with the air to create \nadditional frequencies within the wave. Alex Pasternack, The New Sound of Crowd \nControl, Motherboard (Dec. 17, 2014), https://motherboard. \nvice.com/en_us/article/qkve7q/the‐new‐sound‐of‐crowd‐control (last accessed \nMar. 11, 2018). This can produce volumes of up to 146 decibels. For context, the \nthreshold for human discomfort begins between 120 and 140 decibels and the \nNational Institute of Health cautions that hearing loss can result from short \nexposure to sounds at or above 110 to 120 decibels.  \nThe New York Police Department purchased two Model 3300 LRADs \nbefore the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City. Like other \nLRADs, the Model 3300 has two functions. One, it can serve as a “loudspeaker” \nto broadcast police commands over vast distances. And, two, the “area denial” \nfunction can “propel piercing sound at higher levels . . . than are considered safe \nto human ears.” App. at 85. According to a Department representative speaking \nat the time of the Convention, the LRADs were purchased to direct crowds to \nsafety in the event of a calamity. \n \n5 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page6 of 46\n \nFollowing the convention, the NYPD used its LRADs sporadically and, \nthen, mainly as loudspeakers. In 2010, the NYPD’s Disorder Control Unit tested \nthe Model 3300 at an empty parking lot in the Bronx. Measured from 320 feet \naway, the spoken voice commands registered at 102 decibels and the area denial \nmode at 110 decibels. The Department did not take readings within the 320‐foot \nrange, which it described as a “potential danger area.” A report analyzing the \ntest results observed that, in the “dangerous range (above 120 decibels), this \ndevice can cause damage to someone’s hearing and may be painful.” FAC ¶ 11.  \nShortly thereafter, the NYPD purchased the more portable Model 100X, \nwhich also has loudspeaker and area denial functions. The 100X’s product sheet \nboasts that it has a maximum volume of 136 decibels at one meter and the \nmanufacturer guidelines caution not to use it within 10 to 20 meters of people. A \ndiagram on the 100X’s control panel shows a red beam emanating from the front \nof the device and instructs: “DO NOT ENTER WITHIN 10 METERS DURING \nCONTINUOUS OPERATION.” Id. ¶ 25. \nB.  The Protest \nOn December 3, 2014, a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict the \nNYPD officer who placed Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, in a fatal \n \n6 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page7 of 46\n \nchokehold. The next day, protests arose across the nation. In Manhattan, \nhundreds took to the streets to denounce police brutality. The plaintiffs, many of \nwhom are activists and journalists, participated in and documented the protest. \nOver the course of the evening and into the pre‐dawn hours, the demonstrators \nmarched across the city, escorted by NYPD officers.  \nSometime after 1:00 a.m., as the protest crossed through the intersection of \n57th Street and Madison Avenue, officers made several arrests. Videos of the \nscene (which are incorporated into the complaint) show a crowd—cordoned off \nfrom the arrests by a chain of officers—gathered in a semicircle to observe. \nUnable to proceed through the intersection, cars idled in the street as protesters \nstreamed past. Meanwhile, many onlookers inched closer to take photographs \nonly to be waved off by officers or told to “get back.” Although some \ndemonstrators demanded that the officers “let [the arrestees] go,” none \ninterfered with the arrests. Several plaintiffs reported hearing what sounded like \na glass bottle breaking, but it did not appear to strike or injure anyone.  \nThen, with no warning, NYPD officers discharged pepper spray. Several \nplaintiffs who had been watching the arrests began to flee. Seconds later the wail \nof a high‐pitched alarm began pulsing though the streets. The defendants had \n \n7 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page8 of 46\n \nactivated the LRAD’s area denial function. According to plaintiffs, they had not \nbeen ordered to disperse and no such order is audible on the video. \nAfter several bursts from the alarm tone, Lieutenant Maguire and Officer \nPoletto, both members of the Disorder Control Unit, began broadcasting \ncommands. One officer held the briefcase‐sized device in front of him while the \nother trailed behind and spoke into a corded microphone. “[T]his is the New \nYork City Police Department. You must not interfere with vehicular traffic. You \nmust remain on the sidewalk. If you do interfere with vehicular traffic, you will \nbe placed into custody.” Video 1 at 3:23‐3:41. Variants of this refrain, punctuated \nby alarm tones, were repeated for about three minutes as the officers walked the \nlength of 57th Street between Madison and Park Avenues. Although many people \nin the LRAD’s path “were already fleeing on the sidewalks,” the officers \nfollowed close on their heels, sometimes from fewer than ten feet. FAC ¶ \n124.Plaintiffs maintain that the defendants “knew or should have known that the \nuse of the LRAD could cause permanent hearing damage and other injury.” Id. ¶ \n130. \nIn the days and weeks following the protest, each plaintiff reported \nphysical injuries. Many claimed that they experienced significant ear pain, \n \n8 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page9 of 46\n \nprolonged migraines, vertigo, and ringing in the ears. Most sought medical \ntreatment. One plaintiff “had extreme difficulty with his hearing.” Id. ¶ 370. His \ndoctor explained that “the pressure of the extreme level of the noise from the \nLRAD had pushed a bone in his ear inwards, impacting and damaging a nerve in \nhis ear.” Id. ¶ 372. His hearing improved after a course of steroidal medication. \nSeveral plaintiffs allege that they are now afraid to attend protests, which, for \nsome, has harmed their professional opportunities as journalists. \nII.  Procedural History \nIn March 2016, the six plaintiffs sued Lieutenant Maguire and Officer \nPoletto, as well as then‐NYPD Commissioner William Bratton and the City of \nNew York. They asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 premised on violations of \nthe First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as related municipal \nliability and New York state law claims. Defendants moved to dismiss the \namended complaint, arguing that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim and that \nthe officers were entitled to qualified immunity.  \nThe motion was granted in part and denied in part. The district court \nfound that plaintiffs had adequately pleaded excessive force in violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment (as well as the related municipal liability claim) and \n \n9 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page10 of 46\n \ndenied defendants qualified immunity. It also permitted the state‐law assault \nand battery claims to proceed, including the claims against the City under a \ntheory of respondeat superior. The district court dismissed the other claims, \nincluding all claims against Commissioner Bratton.  \nOn the Fourteenth Amendment claim, the district court reasoned that \n“[t]he use of the [Model 100X] as a projector of powerfully amplified sound is no \ndifferent than other tools in law enforcement’s arsenal that have the potential to \nbe used either safely or harmfully,” such as stun grenades. Special App. at 16. As \nto qualified immunity, the district court rejected defendants’ argument that \namplified noise did not constitute unconstitutional force under existing \nprecedent. “[T]here is much case law discussing the need for careful, vicinity‐\nspecific considerations when using tools like distraction devices,” the court \nexplained, and, if the circumstances were as plaintiffs allege, these analogous \ncases would have informed the officers of the illegality of their actions. Id. at 21. \nLieutenant Maguire and Officer Poletto timely filed this interlocutory \nappeal.  \n \n10 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page11 of 46\n \n DISCUSSION \nI.  Appellate Jurisdiction and Standard of Review \nThe sole issue on appeal is whether defendants are entitled to qualified \nimmunity on the Fourteenth Amendment claim. Ordinarily a district court order \ndenying a motion to dismiss is not appealable. See 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Yet the \nSupreme Court has “repeatedly . . . stressed the importance of resolving \nimmunity questions at the earliest possible stage in litigation.” Hunter v. Bryant, \n502 U.S. 224, 227 (1991) (per curiam). This is because qualified immunity \nrepresents not simply a bar on liability but also an “entitlement not to stand trial \nor face the burdens of litigation.” Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985). \nAccordingly, denying qualified immunity “conclusively determines that the \ndefendant[s] must bear the burdens of discovery; is conceptually distinct from \nthe merits of the plaintiff[s’] claim; and would prove effectively unreviewable on \nan appeal from a final judgment.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 672 (2009) \n(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). It follows that, “[p]rovided it \nturns on an issue of law,” the district court’s denial of qualified immunity is a \nfinal reviewable order. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \n \n11 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page12 of 46\n \n“Of course, [by] presenting [their] immunity defense on a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion instead of a motion for summary judgment[, the defendants] must accept \nthe more stringent standard applicable to this procedural route.” McKenna v. \nWright, 386 F.3d 432, 436 (2d Cir. 2004). Briefly summarized, we accept the \ncomplaint’s factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the \nplaintiffs’ favor, including both those that support the claim and “those that \ndefeat the immunity defense.” Id. This standard represents a “formidable \nhurdle.” Id. at 434. Because the facts are undisputed, our review is de novo. \nJohnson v. Newburgh Enlarged Sch. Dist., 239 F.3d 246, 250 (2d Cir. 2001). \nII.  Qualified Immunity \nAssured of our jurisdiction, we turn to the merits. Section 1983 establishes \na private right of action for money damages against state officials, acting “under \ncolor” of law, who violate a constitutional or statutory right. 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nThis “deter[s] governmental abuse and remed[ies] unlawful governmental \ntransgressions.” Newburgh, 239 F.3d at 250. At the same time, “permitting \ndamages suits against government officials can entail substantial social costs, \nincluding the risk that fear of personal monetary liability and harassing litigation \nwill unduly inhibit officials in the discharge of their duties.” Anderson v. \n \n12 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page13 of 46\n \nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 638 (1987). To balance the need for accountability and the \npotential chilling effect, “the Supreme Court established qualified immunity as \nan affirmative defense to § 1983 claims.” Newburgh, 239 F.3d at 250. This defense \nis designed to “reduce[] the general costs of subjecting officials to the risks of \ntrial” by immunizing them from monetary liability “based on unsettled rights.” \nConnell v. Signoracci, 153 F.3d 74, 79 (2d Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  \nOfficers are entitled to qualified immunity “unless a plaintiff pleads facts \nshowing (1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right, and (2) \nthat the right was ‘clearly established’ at the time of the challenged conduct.” \nAshcroft v. al‐Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 735 (2011) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. \n800, 818 (1982)). Failure to establish either prong would resolve this case and we \nmay “exercise [our] sound discretion in deciding which . . . should be addressed \nfirst.” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009). Like the district court, we \nbegin with the first prong. \nA.  Fourteenth Amendment Violation \nThe right not to be subject to excessive force, perhaps most commonly \nassociated with the Fourth and Eighth Amendments, can also arise under the \n \n13 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page14 of 46\n \nFourteenth. See Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 394 (1989); Hemphill v. Schott, 141 \nF.3d 412, 418 (2d Cir. 1998). This is because “[t]he touchstone of due process,” \nwhich “is protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government,” \nWolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 558 (1974), bars “the exercise of power without \nany reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate governmental \nobjective,” Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 846 (1998). When the \ngovernment action is executive, rather than legislative, the Supreme Court has \ncautioned that “only the most egregious official conduct can be said to be \narbitrary in the constitutional sense.” Lewis, 523 U.S. at 846 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). This standard is most readily satisfied when conduct is \n“intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest.” Id. at \n849. \nWhile the parties agree that the Fourteenth Amendment establishes a right \nagainst excessive force, they disagree about the relevant test. Defendants \nmaintain that the proper inquiry is whether the conduct shocks the conscience. \nAppellants’ Reply Br. at 11. They argue that this standard includes a subjective \nelement—whether the officers behaved “maliciously and sadistically for the very \npurpose of causing harm.” Appellants’ Br. at 33 (quoting Tierney v. Davidson, 133 \n \n14 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page15 of 46\n \nF.3d 189, 196 (2d Cir. 1998)). According to defendants, this standard is “distinct \nfrom, and more stringent than, objective reasonableness.” Appellants’ Reply Br. \nat 11. Plaintiffs counter that conduct shocks the conscience when the use of force \nwas both “objectively unreasonable” and “intentional, as opposed to negligent.” \nAppellees’ Br. at 33. In addressing this disagreement, we apply the law as it \nexists at the time of decision. See Whitney v. Empire Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 106 \nF.3d 475, 477 (2d Cir. 1997) (per curiam). \nDefendants are correct that many cases describe the test for excessive force \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment with the shorthand “shocks the conscience.” \nSee, e.g., Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 172 (1952). For many years, courts have \nunderstood this standard to be distinct from the Fourth Amendment’s \nprohibition against “unreasonable” government action. See Lewis, 523 U.S. at 842–\n43. As recognized in Graham, this distinction reflects the varied sources of \nexcessive force claims. 490 U.S. at 393–94. Arrestees may invoke the Fourth \nAmendment’s prohibition against “unreasonable” seizures. U.S. Const. amend. \nIV. Those incarcerated for a criminal conviction draw on the Eighth \nAmendment’s ban on “cruel and unusual punishments.” U.S. Const. amend. \n \n15 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page16 of 46\n \nVIII. Meanwhile, pretrial detainees and non‐incarcerated persons rely on the \nconstitutional guarantee of “due process.” U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV.  \nIn Johnson v. Glick, this Court identified four illustrative factors for \nassessing whether conduct, in the words of Rochin, “shocks the conscience.” 481 \nF.2d 1028, 1033 (2d Cir. 1973) (Friendly, J.) (quoting Rochin, 342 U.S. at 172). The \nfactors are: “the need for the application of force, the relationship between the \nneed and the amount of force that was used, the extent of the injury inflicted, and \nwhether the force was . . . [inflicted] maliciously or sadistically.” Id. In the \ndecades since Glick was decided, these factors have continued to guide our \nFourteenth Amendment excessive force analysis. See, e.g., Tierney, 133 F.3d at 199. \nBut they have never been exhaustive, nor is each factor necessary. See Glick, 481 \nF.2d at 1033 (stating only that “a court must look to such factors as . . . “). In \nparticular, we have never treated malice or sadism as a requirement for stating \n(or proving) an excessive force claim under a due process theory. Where officials \nlacked “any legitimate government objective and [caused] substantial injury,” we \nhave treated malicious or sadistic conduct as presumptively unconstitutional. \nNewburgh, 239 F.3d at 252. But we have also found excessive force under the \nFourteenth Amendment without ever examining an officer’s subjective intent. \n \n16 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page17 of 46\n \nSee, e.g., Robison v. Via, 821 F.2d 913, 924 (2d Cir. 1987); Bellows v. Dainack, 555 \nF.2d 1105, 1106 & n.1 (2d Cir. 1977). \nIn 2015 (after the events at issue in this case) the Supreme Court revisited \nthe Fourteenth Amendment standard in Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466 \n(2015). The question there was whether a pretrial detainee alleging a Fourteenth \nAmendment violation must prove that the officers were subjectively aware that \nthe force was excessive, as in the Eighth Amendment context, or merely that the \nforce was objectively excessive. 135 S. Ct. at 2470. In resolving this question, the \nCourt began by clarifying that excessive force claims involve “two separate state‐\nof‐mind questions.” Id. at 2472. The first concerns the official’s “state of mind \nwith respect to his physical acts.” Id. Drawing on its decision in Lewis, the Court \nexplained that accidental or negligent acts are not subject to Fourteenth \nAmendment liability while those committed purposefully, knowingly, or \n(perhaps) recklessly are. Id.  \nThe second mental state, and the one at issue in Kingsley, “concerns the \ndefendant’s state of mind with respect to whether his use of force was \n‘excessive.’” Id. On this score, the Supreme Court held that, unlike in the Eighth \nAmendment context, the standard for a pretrial detainee suing under the \n \n17 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page18 of 46\n \nFourteenth Amendment is “objective” and merely requires showing that “the \nforce purposely or knowingly used against him was objectively unreasonable.” \nId. at 2472–73. This objective showing can be established through contextual \nfactors and the Court identified six non‐exhaustive “considerations.” Id. at 2473. \nThese factors included proportionality or, as the Court described it, “the \nrelationship between the need for the use of force and the amount of force used.” \nId. They also included related indicia such as “the extent of the plaintiff’s injury; \nany effort made by the officer to temper or to limit the amount of force; the \nseverity of the security problem at issue; the threat reasonably perceived by the \nofficer; and whether the plaintiff was actively resisting.” Id.  \nViewed against the backdrop of this circuit’s Fourteenth Amendment \njurisprudence, Kingsley offers two important insights. First, the objective \nstandard it announced confirms that the subjective mental state referenced in \nGlick and some of this Court’s other precedents is not a necessary showing. \nSecond, and more significantly, Kingsley used modified terminology to describe \nthe Fourteenth Amendment standard. Although prior excessive force cases spoke \nof whether the official’s conduct “shocks the conscience,” Lewis, 523 U.S. at 846–\n \n18 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page19 of 46\n \n47 (collecting cases), Kingsley asked whether the force was “objectively \nunreasonable,” 135 S. Ct. at 2473. More on this later. \n  Returning to the case at hand, defendants protest that, contrary to \nplaintiffs’ assertion, Kingsley is not the appropriate touchstone for assessing the \nalleged Fourteenth Amendment violation. On defendants’ reading, Kingsley’s \nholding is doubly inapposite because it is limited to pretrial detainees and did \nnot abdicate the traditional “shocks the conscience” standard. Both arguments \nare unpersuasive.  \n  Defendants’ first—and principal—argument is based on a \nmisinterpretation of this Court’s earlier statement that Kingsley “addressed only \nthe legally requisite state of mind required for a pretrial detainee’s excessive \nforce claims.” Dancy v. McGinley, 843 F.3d 93, 117 (2d Cir. 2016). Defendants \nunderstand this language as limiting Kingsley to pretrial detainees only. But this \nignores the context. Dancy involved a Fourth Amendment excessive force claim \nand this Court was distinguishing between principles that applied under the \nFourteenth Amendment and those that governed under the Fourth. See id. It \nfollows that Dancy had no reason to address Kingsleyʹs applicability to non‐\ndetainees bringing claims under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n \n19 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page20 of 46\n \nMoreover, we have not treated the precise factual context at issue in \nKingsley—a pretrial detainee claiming excessive force—as a limitation on the \nFourteenth Amendment standard announced therein. In our one case to engage \nclosely with Kingsley, we held that its standard applied not just to excessive force \nclaims, but also to those alleging deliberate indifference toward pretrial \ndetainees. Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 33–34 (2d Cir. 2017). In reaching this \nconclusion, the Darnell Court did not apply Kingsley’s language mechanically. \nInstead it looked to the sweep and substance of the Supreme Court’s reasoning. \nWe do the same. \n  To begin where Kingsley did, “a pretrial detainee can prevail” by alleging \n“that the challenged governmental action is not rationally related to a legitimate \ngovernmental objective or that it is excessive in relation to that purpose.” 135 S. \nCt. at 2473–74. As discussed above, this standard is the essence of all Fourteenth \nAmendment claims, not merely those brought by pretrial detainees. In Lewis, a \ncase that involved a non‐detainee, the Supreme Court grounded its analysis in \nthe same principle: “the touchstone of due process” is protection from “the \nexercise of power without any reasonable justification in the service of a \nlegitimate governmental objective.” 523 U.S. at 845–46 (brackets omitted). What’s \n \n20 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page21 of 46\n \nmore, Kingsley’s reliance on Lewis as the source of the Fourteenth Amendment \nstandard belies defendants’ suggestion that claims by non‐detainees are subject \nto a distinct test. See Kingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2472–73.1  \nThe distinction Kingsley drew was not between pretrial detainees and non‐\ndetainees. Instead, it was between claims brought under the Eighth \nAmendment’s Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause and those brought under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. 135 S. Ct. at 2475. As the \nCourt observed, not only do the two clauses use distinct language, but, “most \nimportantly, pretrial detainees (unlike convicted prisoners) cannot be punished \nat all.” Id. (emphasis added). The same is true of non‐detainees, except more so. \nAfter all, with a non‐detainee the government has not even shown probable \ncause of criminal activity, much less a public safety (or flight) risk warranting \ndetention. For this reason, it would be extraordinary to conclude that “pretrial \ndetainees . . . cannot be punished at all, much less ‘maliciously and sadistically,’” \nid., while requiring non‐detainees to prove malice and sadism.  \n                                              \n1 Additionally, when the Kingsley defendants argued that Lewis supported a \nsubjective intent standard, the Court had an opportunity to distinguish its earlier \ndecision as a case limited to non‐detainees. But the Court did no such thing. Instead, it \nexplained why that argument misread Lewis’s holding. 135 S. Ct. at 2475. \n \n21 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page22 of 46\n \nDefendants offer no principled justifications to buttress such an \nimplausible standard, nor could they. Their argument is contrary to this Court’s \nentire body of non‐detainee cases, which have long applied the standard \nannounced in Glick, a pretrial detainee case. See, e.g., Newburgh, 239 F.3d at 251–\n52; Tierney, 133 F.3d at 199. And yet, although defendants acknowledge that \nKingsley represents a new gloss on the pretrial detainee standard, they would \nhold the non‐detained plaintiffs to this Court’s prior articulation of the pretrial \ndetainee standard. To state the argument is to reveal its untenability.2 \nShifting gears, defendants contend that Kingsley did not formally overrule \nthe “shocks the conscience” standard. That may be true, but we think it is beside \nthe point. This is because defendants’ focus on phrasing reflects an overly \nformalistic view of Fourteenth Amendment law. To repeat, the central inquiry \nhas always been whether the government action was rationally related to a \n                                              \n2 Defendants, moreover, point to no case in our Circuit dealing with non‐\ndetainees—before or after Kingsley—that treated proof of subjective intent as a \nnecessary precondition for a successful Fourteenth Amendment excessive force claim. \nThus, even if they could convince us that Kingsley should be cabined to pretrial \ndetainees (which they cannot), this would not require us to dismiss an excessive force \nclaim absent an allegation of malice or sadism. Kingsley made explicit what we have \nlong taken for granted: a government actor’s use of force violates due process when it is \nobjectively excessive.  \n \n22 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page23 of 46\n \nlegitimate government objective. Lewis, 523 U.S. at 846. Although the Supreme \nCourt has “spoken of the cognizable level of executive abuse of power as that \nwhich shocks the conscience,” this merely showed that the “due process \nguarantee does not . . . impos[e] liability whenever someone cloaked with state \nauthority causes harm.” Id. at 846, 848. Instead, “the Due Process Clause is \nviolated by executive action only when it can properly be characterized as \narbitrary, or conscience shocking, in a constitutional sense.” Id. at 847 (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  \nAs the Supreme Court has observed, “the measure of what is conscience \nshocking is no calibrated yard stick”; it merely “point[s] the way.” Id. (internal \nquotation marks omitted). Mindful of this indefiniteness, Kingsley is best read as \nelaborating on this standard, not abandoning it. Kingsley held that excessiveness \nis measured objectively and then identified various considerations that inform \nthe ultimate Fourteenth Amendment inquiry: whether the governmental action \nwas rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective. 135 S. Ct. at 2473 \n(considering such things as the “relationship between the need for the use of \n \n23 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page24 of 46\n \nforce and the amount of force used”).3 To put a finer point on it, Kingsley teaches \nthat purposeful, knowing or (perhaps) reckless action that uses an objectively \nunreasonable degree of force is conscience shocking.4  \nAlthough we now hold that Kingsley provides the appropriate standard for \nall excessive force claims brought under the Fourteenth Amendment, it bears \nemphasizing that this new formulation is but a modest refinement of Glick’s four‐\nfactor test, on which this Court has long relied. The first three factors identified \nin Glick—the need for force, the relationship between the need and the degree of \nforce used, and the extent of the injury, 481 F.2d at 1033—parallel the six non‐\nexhaustive factors identified in Kingsley. Consider Glick’s first factor, the need to \nuse force. Kingsley effectively disaggregates this into three considerations that all \nbear on whether force was necessary. 135 S. Ct. at 2473 (encouraging courts to \nconsider “the severity of the security problem,” the threat perceived, and \n                                              \n3 Framed in these terms, defendants cannot seriously dispute Kingsley’s logic. \nAfter all, their own brief acknowledges that, “[i]t is where officials take injurious action \nwith no apparent government interest that this Court has found their conduct conscience‐\nshocking.” Appellant’s Br. at 39 (emphasis added). \n4 One might argue that this conclusion is in tension with Dancy’s observation that \n“Fourth Amendment claims are tied to reasonableness, which is considerably less \ndemanding” than the Due Process Clause. 843 F.3d at 117. But, once again, because \nDancy focused on the intent standard under the Fourth Amendment, it did not purport \n \n24 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page25 of 46\n \n“whether the plaintiff was actively resisting”). As for Glick’s next two factors—\n“the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used” and \n“the extent of injury inflicted,”481 F.2d at 1033—these are explicitly incorporated \ninto Kingsley. See 135 S. Ct. at 2473 (highlighting “the relationship between the \nneed for the use of force and the amount of force used” and “the extent of the \nplaintiff’s injury”). \nTurning to the fourth Glick factor, whether the force was applied \n“maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm,” 481 F.2d at \n1033, Kingsley explained that this is not a “necessary condition for liability,” 135 \nS. Ct. at 2476 (emphasis omitted). Instead it is simply one consideration “that \nmight help show that the use of force was excessive.” Id. (emphasis added). This \ninterpretation is consistent with our own precedents, which have repeatedly \nassessed excessive force claims without looking to subjective intent. See, e.g., \nRobison, 821 F.2d at 924 (holding that the assertion that officers “yanked [a \nwoman] out [of her car], threw her up against the fender, and twisted her arm \nbehind her back” was enough to prevent summary dismissal of an excessive \nforce claim (internal quotation marks omitted)); Bellows, 555 F.2d at 1106 & n.1 \n                                                                                                                                                  \nto addr ess how Kingsley affected cases brought under the Due Process Clause.  \n25 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page26 of 46\n \n(concluding that plaintiff stated an excessive force claim based solely on the \ninjuries and absence of a legitimate government interest). \nApplying Kingsley’s analysis to the allegations at hand, we conclude that \nthe plaintiffs’ complaint states a Fourteenth Amendment violation. First, \nconsider the need for force. Under plaintiffs’ account, which we must accept as \ntrue, the security threat posed by the protest was low. The video footage \nconfirms that the demonstrators were non‐violent and there was a robust police \npresence monitoring the crowd. Although someone may have thrown a glass \nbottle, this appears to have been an isolated and victimless incident. None of the \nonlookers filming and photographing the arrests interfered and additional \nofficers were on scene to keep protesters at bay. The most significant problem \nconfronting law enforcement appears to have been traffic disruption caused by \nprotesters walking in the street. However, while mixing cars and pedestrians \nmight have presented a hazard, this is the sort of public safety risk common to \nlarge public demonstrations, not necessarily an imminent threat warranting a \nsignificant use of force. In short, on the facts alleged, the “severity of the security \nproblem” was minimal and the “threat reasonably perceived by the officers” was \nnegligible. Kingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2473.  \n \n26 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page27 of 46\n \nIn addition, there is no indication that plaintiffs were “actively resisting.” \nId. Quite the opposite: the complaint alleges that once the police began ordering \npeople to move to the sidewalks the plaintiffs promptly complied. (One plaintiff \nadmits that he briefly stepped off the curb while yelling a critical comment at the \npolice. But this was, as most, de minimis resistance.) \nTurning to proportionality, the disparity between the threat posed by the \nprotest and the degree of force is stark.  The Department’s 2010 report describes \nthe purpose of an earlier LRAD model’s area denial function as “send[ing] out \nsound at a dangerously high level [to cause] attackers to turn away, or at least, to \ncause pain/hearing damage to try to repel [an] attack.” App. at 85 (emphases \nadded). The control panel on the Model 100X that was used here warned \noperators in capital letters that entering within 10 meters of the device during \noperation was dangerous. See FAC ¶ 25. The device’s product sheet likewise \nlisted the LRAD’s maximum volume as 136 decibels at one meter, well above the \n120 decibels threshold where pain begins and just short of the 140 decibels at \nwhich the report advised that “[s]hort term exposure can cause permanent \ndamage.” App. at 86. Exposure to this dangerous volume (which we must \nassume from the pleadings) is a severe consequence for blocking traffic. \n \n27 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page28 of 46\n \nThe injuries alleged by the plaintiffs (another Kingsley consideration, see \n135 S. Ct. at 2473) are consistent with the report’s projections. They endured \nauditory pain, migraines, tinnitus, and hearing loss, of varying degrees and \nduration. Several plaintiffs claimed that they still had periodic tinnitus as of the \ncomplaint’s filing (a year and a half after the protest) and at least one plaintiff \nsaid that he experienced constant ringing. Another suffered nerve damage and \nhearing loss that required medical treatment. These impairments fit comfortably \non the spectrum of injuries that this Court has found sufficient to state a \nFourteenth Amendment violation. See, e.g., Newburgh, 239 F.3d at 252 (holding \nthat “head trauma, lacerations, and bruising” constitute a “substantial physical \ninjury”); Robison, 821 F.2d at 924 (denying qualified immunity for a Fourteenth \nAmendment violation when officers caused bruises that lasted “a couple \nweeks”). \nKingsley also asks whether the officers tried to “temper or to limit the \namount of force.” 135 S. Ct. at 2473. Nothing in the complaint suggests that they \ndid. There was no audible dispersal warning before the defendants activated the \narea denial function, nor any other visible attempt to move protesters out of the \nstreet. Looking at the force itself, the plaintiffs allege that the officers used the \n \n28 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page29 of 46\n \nLRAD at close range while “pointing it” at the demonstrators. FAC ¶ 229. In \naddition, the alleged injuries support an inference that the LRAD was set to an \nextremely high decibel‐level. \nPulling these threads together, plaintiffs’ allegations indicate that the \nofficers’ use of the LRAD’s area denial function was disproportionate to the \nlimited security risk posed by the non‐violent protest and caused substantial \nphysical injuries. Or, stated somewhat differently, the defendants’ use of a device \ncapable of causing pain and hearing loss was an “exercise of power without any \nreasonable justification in the service of a legitimate government objective.” \nLewis, 523 U.S. at 846. Because defendants have chosen to appeal the denial of a \nmotion to dismiss, we are compelled to accept the allegations as true and must \ntherefore conclude that the complaint adequately states a Fourteenth \nAmendment claim. \nB.  Clearly Established Law \nThe remaining question is whether the constitutional right at issue was \n“clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.” al‐Kidd, 563 U.S. at \n735 (internal quotation marks omitted). This inquiry “ensure[s] that the official \nbeing sued had fair warning that his or her actions were unlawful.” Terebesi v. \n \n29 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page30 of 46\n \nTorreso, 764 F.3d 217, 230 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). And, \nbecause officers cannot have fair warning of rights that are not yet established, \nwe look to precedent in existence at the time of the events. See Anderson, 483 U.S. \nat 639. Here, this means that, for purposes of “clearly established law,” we apply \nthe Fourteenth Amendment analysis from Glick, not the Supreme Court’s 2015 \ndecision in Kingsley. \nWe begin with the delicate task of defining the right at issue. In doing so, \nwe must be mindful that, on the one hand, “[c]haracterizing the right too \nnarrowly to the facts of the case might permit government actors to escape \npersonal liability.” Newburgh, 239 F.3d at 251. On the other hand, defining clearly \nestablished law at too high a level of generality “avoids the crucial question \nwhether the official acted reasonably in the particular circumstances that he or \nshe faced.” Plumhoff v. Rickard, 134 S. Ct. 2012, 2023 (2014).  \nHere, defendants’ frame the question as “whether the officers violated the \nFourteenth Amendment by using the LRAD 100X to aid in moving protesters to \nthe sidewalks after the protest became obstructive and potentially violent.” \nAppellants’ Br. at 28. This framing puts not one but two thumbs on the scale in \nfavor of defendants. First, it focuses on the officers’ professed objective—moving \n \n30 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page31 of 46\n \nprotesters onto the sidewalk—while ignoring the degree of force that the officers \nallegedly used. Second, it recasts the protest as “violent,” a characterization that, \nbased on plaintiffs’ allegations and the scene captured in the videos, is at best \narguable. See, e.g., id. at 34 (describing a “large crowd of hostile demonstrators—\nwho greatly outnumbered and had surrounded the officers, were becoming \nviolent, and were obstructing traffic”). Perhaps this is an inference that a \nfactfinder might ultimately make, but at this stage we must draw all inferences in \nfavor of the plaintiffs, not the defendants.  \nDefining the Fourteenth Amendment right according to the “particular \ncircumstances” requires attention to the precipitating events, the government \ninterest at issue, the degree of force used, and the reasonably anticipated \nconsequences of the government action. To illustrate, consider the Supreme \nCourt’s analysis in Plumhoff. The Court began with the context, a “lengthy, high‐\nspeed pursuit” that “posed a danger both to the officers involved and to any \ncivilians who happened to be nearby.” 134 S. Ct. at 2023. The officers’ objective \nwas to “protect those whom [the suspect’s] flight might endanger.” Id. After the \nsuspect crashed and then tried to speed away, several officers fired a collective 15 \nshots. Id. at 2024. It was undisputed that this was “deadly force.” Id. at 2021, \n \n31 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page32 of 46\n \n2022, 2024. Weaving all these circumstances together, the Court addressed \nwhether it was clearly established in 2004 that a suspect who leads a long and \ndangerous car chase has a right not to be subjected to deadly force used to \nprotect public safety. Id. at 2023–24. The Court held that he did not. Id. Following \nthis template, and accepting the facts alleged by the plaintiffs, the question here \nis whether, in 2014, non‐violent protesters and onlookers, who officers had not \nordered to disperse, had a right not to be subjected to pain and serious injury \nthat was inflicted to move them onto the sidewalks.  \nPreliminarily, we address whether this conduct alleges a Fourteenth \nAmendment violation under the legal standard applicable in 2014. Although our \nearlier discussion drew on Kingsley, the result is the same under Glick’s parallel \nfactors. To repeat, this Court’s longstanding test for excessive force claims \nteaches that force must be necessary and proportionate to the circumstances. See \nGlick, 481 F.2d at 1033; see also Newburgh, 239 F.3d at 253 (“[W]hether force is \nexcessive depends as much upon the need for force as the amount of force \nused.”). Here, on the allegations that we must accept as true, the problem posed \nby protesters in the street did not justify the use of force, much less force capable \nof causing serious injury, such as hearing loss.  \n \n32 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page33 of 46\n \nThe most significant difference between the Kingsley factors applied above \nand Glick is, of course, the latter’s inquiry into “whether force was applied in a \ngood faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically \nfor the very purpose of causing harm.” Glick, 481 F.2d at 1033. But, as our prior \ncases show, this evidence has never been necessary for a Fourteenth Amendment \nexcessive force claim. See, e.g., Robison, 821 F.2d at 924; Bellows, 555 F.2d at 1106 & \nn.1. And, when parties choose to present evidence on this point, they can \nestablish subjective intent through circumstantial evidence. See Blue v. Koren, 72 \nF.3d 1075, 1084 (2d Cir. 1995). Although the plaintiffs need not allege facts \nshowing that defendants subjectively intended to use excessive force, we \nconclude that, given the gross disparity between the need for force and the level \nof pain and injury inflicted, the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the \nofficers behaved “maliciously and sadistically.” See Newburgh, 239 F.3d at 252 \n(concluding that the fourth Glick factor was satisfied where the force used “far \nsurpassed anything that could reasonably be characterized as serving legitimate \ngovernment ends”). \nThe remaining question is whether the right was clearly established. \nWould reasonable officers have known that subjecting non‐violent protesters to \n \n33 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page34 of 46\n \npain and serious injury simply to move them onto the sidewalks violated the \nFourteenth Amendment? Defendants insist that the circumstances before them \nwere too dissimilar from then‐existing precedents to provide this notice.  They \nraise two principal arguments. Neither withstands scrutiny. \nFirst, the defendants deny that it was clearly established in December 2014 \nthat using force in a crowd control context violates due process. In their view, \nbecause this Court has not applied “substantive due process principles to crowd \ncontrol,” the officers lacked notice that the right against excessive force applies to \nnon‐violent protesters. Appellants’ Br. at 37. But that is like saying police officers \nwho run over people crossing the street illegally can claim immunity simply \nbecause we have never addressed a Fourteenth Amendment claim involving \njaywalkers. This would convert the fair notice requirement into a presumption \nagainst the existence of basic constitutional rights. Qualified immunity doctrine \nis not so stingy. In fact, we rebuffed a nearly identical argument in Newburgh. \nThere, a teacher who brutally assaulted a student insisted that he was entitled to \nqualified immunity because the right to be free from excessive force had not been \n“applied to the educational setting.” 239 F.3d at 253. Unpersuaded, we declined \n \n34 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page35 of 46\n \nto adopt such a piecemeal view of Fourteenth Amendment protections. Id. We \nsee no reason to take a different tack here.  \nWere this not enough, a wealth of cases inform government officials that \nprotesters enjoy robust constitutional protections. “[O]ur constitutional \ncommand of free speech and assembly is basic and fundamental and \nencompasses peaceful social protest, so important to the preservation of the \nfreedoms treasured in a democratic society.” Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 559, 574 \n(1965); see also Jones v. Parmley, 465 F.3d 46, 56 (2d Cir. 2006) (“[T]he First \nAmendment protects political demonstrations and protests . . . .”); Belknap v. \nLeary, 427 F.2d 496, 499 (2d Cir. 1970) (Friendly, J.) (recognizing a \n“First Amendment right[] to protest peaceably against the war— or anything \nelse”). Against this backdrop, it would be passing strange to presume that \nprotesters exercising a foundational constitutional right have weaker substantive \ndue process rights than citizens in other contexts.  \nTo be sure, government officials may stop or disperse a protest when faced \nwith an “immediate threat to public safety, peace, or order,” including \n“interference with traffic upon the public streets.” Parmley, 465 F.3d at 57 \n(quoting Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 308 (1940)). But this authority is not \n \n35 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page36 of 46\n \nwithout limits. Among other things, officials have an obligation, “absent \nimminent harm,” to inform demonstrators that they must disperse, id. at 60, and \nmay not use unreasonable force, id. at 63. In short, our cases amply establish that \nprotesters enjoy robust constitutional protection, protection of which reasonable \nlaw enforcement officers are well aware. \nIn spite of this precedent, defendants, drawing on distinguishable out‐of‐\ncircuit authority, would have us believe that courts generally conclude that “use \nof force in a crowd control context [does] not violate substantive due process.” \nAppellants’ Br. at 37 n.12. Hardly. Our sister circuits and district courts in this \nCircuit have routinely applied excessive force principles to crowd control \nsituations.  See, e.g., Nelson v. City of Davis, 685 F.3d 867, 882–83 (9th Cir. 2012); \nBuck v. City of Albuquerque, 549 F.3d 1269, 1289–90 (10th Cir. 2008); Asociacion de \nPeriodistas de Puerto Rico v. Mueller, 529 F.3d 52, 59–62 (1st Cir. 2008); Darrah v. \nCity of Oak Park, 255 F.3d 301, 306–08 (6th Cir. 2001); Duran v. Sirgedas, 240 F. \nApp’x 104, 112–13 (7th Cir. 2007) (summary order); Piper v. City of Elmira, 12 F. \nSupp. 3d 577, 589–96 (W.D.N.Y. 2014). Training our focus on controlling \nauthority, we see that this Court has repeatedly emphasized that officers \nengaging with protesters must comply with the same principles of \n \n36 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page37 of 46\n \nproportionality attendant to any other use of force. See Parmley, 465 F.3d at 53, 63; \nAmnesty Am. v. Town of W. Hartford, 361 F.3d 113, 119, 123‐24 (2d Cir. 2004). A \nbrief summary of these cases is instructive. \nIn Parmley we refused to condone officers’ assault on protesters who \ndistributed flyers on a public highway. See 465 F.3d at 52. The record showed \nthat several dozen protesters had gathered on private property for a lawful \ndemonstration. Id. At some point, a contingent walked to a nearby highway to \ndistribute fliers to passing cars. Id. After the protesters left the highway, a large \ngroup of officers stormed onto the private property without “order[ing] the \nprotesters to disperse or provid[ing] them with any warning or justification for \ntheir actions.” Id. at 53. They went on to assault non‐violent, compliant \nprotesters, “beating them with . . . riot batons, dragging them by their hair and \nkicking them.” Id. Failing to discern a legitimate justification for this violent \nresponse, we readily concluded that that the officers’ motion for summary \njudgment based on qualified immunity was properly denied. Id. at 63.  \nWe have also warned officers against gratuitously employing “pain \ncompliance techniques,” such as bending protesters’ wrists, thumbs, and fingers \nbackwards. Amnesty Am., 361 F.3d at 119, 123–24. Reasoning that the pain \n \n37 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page38 of 46\n \nassociated with these techniques was “comparable [to] amounts of force” that we \nconsidered unreasonable when “used during the arrest of a nonviolent suspect,” \nwe concluded that a reasonable factfinder could decide that the force was \nexcessive. Id. at 124. We elaborated that liability would turn on whether a jury \nfound either that such techniques were a proportionate response to protesters \npurposefully making themselves difficult to arrest or that “the officers \ngratuitously inflicted pain in a manner that was not a reasonable response to the \ncircumstances.” Id. Gratuitous infliction of a pain compliance technique—the \nstrategy behind the LRAD’s area denial function—is exactly what the current \nplaintiffs allege. \nBoth Parmley and Amnesty America gave the defendants fair warning that \nthe prohibition on excessive force applies to protesters. This is true even though \nboth those cases arose under the Fourth Amendment. See Poe v. Leonard, 282 F.3d \n123, 137 (2d Cir. 2002) (“Although the Fourth Amendment cases are not on all \nfours with [plaintiff’s] claim under the Fourteenth Amendment, they are \ninstructive . . . .”).5 After all, there is no intuitive reason to think a recalcitrant \n                                              \n5 Defendants’ reply brief argues that Fourth Amendment cases “cannot establish \nthe law for Fourteenth Amendment purposes.” Appellants’ Reply Br. at 22. This \n \n38 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page39 of 46\n \nprotester who is being arrested has more robust rights than a compliant protester \nwho is not. Thus, we see no merit in defendants’ argument that they lacked \nnotice of the substantive due process rights of protesters.  \nShifting attention from the protesters to the technology at issue, \ndefendants’ second argument is that, at the time of the events, the Fourteenth \nAmendment did not apply to LRADs. This argument has two parts: First, \ndefendants contend that the officers cannot be liable because no decision from \nthis Court or the Supreme Court “held or clearly foreshadowed that it would be \nunconstitutional to use an acoustic device under any circumstances,” much less \n“under circumstances like those faced by the officers.” Appellants’ Br. at 19, 36–\n37 (emphasis omitted). Second, defendants insist that, because LRADs \n“function[] solely by sound,” which is not an “instrument[] of force,” a \nreasonable officer would not think that the Fourteenth Amendment applied. Id. \nat 23; see also id. at 35. We disagree on both fronts.  \n                                                                                                                                                  \nargument is inconsistent with the practice of the Supreme Court and this Circuit, both \nof which cross‐pollinate between Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment contexts. \nSee, e.g., Graham, 490 U.S. at 396 (relying on language from Glick, a Fourteenth \nAmendment case, to explain Fourth Amendment constraints); Hudson v. McMillian, 503 \nU.S. 1, 9 (1992) (drawing on Glick in the Eighth Amendment context); Medeiros v. \nO’Connell, 150 F.3d 164, 170 (2d Cir. 1998) (analyzing Eighth Amendment case law to \n \n39 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page40 of 46\n \nDefendants’ first argument echoes a common refrain in qualified \nimmunity cases—“pointing to the absence of prior case law concerning the \nprecise weapon, method, or technology employed by the police.” Terebesi, 764 \nF.3d at 237 n.20. But novel technology, without more, does not entitle an officer \nto qualified immunity. See Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 731 (2002) (“[O]fficials can \nbe on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual \nsituations.”). In our first encounter with stun grenades, we concluded that, \nalthough neither this Court nor the Supreme Court had addressed that particular \ntechnology, “the Fourth Amendment principles governing police use of force \napply with obvious clarity[] to the unreasonable deployment of an explosive \ndevice in the home.” Terebesi, 764 F.3d. at 237 (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted). Drawing on a decision from the Ninth Circuit, we declared, \n“[a]n officer is not entitled to qualified immunity” for lack of notice “every time a \nnovel method is used to inflict injury.” Id. (quoting Mendoza v. Block, 27 F.3d \n1357, 1362 (9th Cir. 1994)). Instead, we instructed that “[s]ome measure of \nabstraction and common sense is required with respect to police methods and \nweapons.” Id. at 237 n.20. To drive the point home, we listed a series of \n                                                                                                                                                  \ndefine  a Fourteenth Amendment right).  \n40 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page41 of 46\n \ninnovative non‐lethal weapons to which officers should apply common sense, \nincluding “sound guns” or “acoustical weaponry.” Id. Given our call for common \nsense in the face of new technology, defendants cannot credibly complain they \nlacked notice that the proscription on excessive force applied to acoustic devices.  \nAs to whether LRADs are instruments of force, defendants go astray by \nfocusing on the mode of delivery rather than the physical effect. Under this \nCourt’s precedent, a device that has “incapacitating and painful effects” when \nused on a person is considered an instrument of force. Tracy v. Freshwater, 623 \nF.3d 90, 98 (2d Cir. 2010). Applying this standard, we have held that pepper \nspray, which employs chemical reactions rather than kinetic energy, “constitutes \na significant degree of force.” Id.6 Drawing on well‐established principles, we \nadded that because “gratuitous force is unreasonable and therefore excessive[,] \n. . . we presume that no reasonable officer could have believed that he was \n                                              \n6 Defendants claim that an LRAD differs from pepper spray because “it includes \na highly effective loudspeaker mode that can help avoid the need for measures \nhistorically regarded as force.” Appellants’ Br. at 23. This is effectively an argument that \nLRAD’s are dual‐use devices capable of both exerting dangerous force and serving \nvaluable, non‐forceful functions. But the same is true of a riot stick, which can both \nbludgeon and direct traffic. Rather than absolving the riot stick from scrutiny, this dual \nfunctionality is all the more reason to focus on the particular action and ensuing effect, \nnot the device itself. \n \n41 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page42 of 46\n \nentitled to use pepper spray gratuitously against a restrained and unresisting \narrestee.” Id. at 99 n.5. In support, we relied on a First Circuit case concluding \nthat unprovoked use of pepper spray against members of a nonthreatening \ncrowd was excessive, an indication that this sort of gratuitous force against \ncrowds is verboten. Id. (citing Asociacion de Periodistas, 529 F.3d at 60–62).  \nIn Terebesi, to add just one more example, we followed the same approach. \nThere, the officers urged that they were immune because no precedent \nestablished that the right against excessive force applied to stun grenades. 764 \nF.3d at 236. But we rejected that argument. Emphasizing the dangerous effects of \nthese devices, which “cause[] fires, burns, and other injuries,” we held that “a \nreasonable officer would [not] think it was constitutional to use these devices in \nroutine searches.” Id. at 236, 238. \nWe reach the same conclusion here. Even though sound waves are a novel \nmethod for deploying force, the effect of an LRAD’s area denial function is \nfamiliar: pain and incapacitation. See Tracy, 623 F.3d at 98. In fact, this is what the \nLRAD was designed for. As explained in the NYPD’s own report, the purpose of \nthe area denial function is to “cause pain/hearing damage” that repels those in its \npath. App. at 85. Using common sense, any reasonable officer with knowledge of \n \n42 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page43 of 46\n \nthe LRAD’s operations would understand that the area denial function \nrepresents a “significant degree of force.” See Tracy, 623 F.3d at 98. \nTo recap, assuming the truthfulness of the allegations in the complaint, \nand drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs’ favor, the defendants knew or \nshould have known that the area denial function could cause serious injury. \nWhen engaging with non‐violent protesters who had not been ordered to \ndisperse, no reasonable officer would have believed that the use of such \ndangerous force was a permissible means of moving protesters to the sidewalks. \nWhatever legitimate interest the officers had in clearing the street, the use of \nsound capable of causing pain and hearing loss in the manner alleged in the \ncomplaint was not rationally related to this end. We therefore conclude that the \ndistrict court properly denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss based on \nqualified immunity. \n* * *  \nOur decision regarding the defendants’ use of the LRAD is a narrow one. \nWe do not hold that the Fourteenth Amendment bars law enforcement from \nusing LRADs. To the contrary, we are confident that, in appropriate \ncircumstances, following careful study and proper training, LRADs can be a \n \n43 \n\nCase

46\n \nvaluable tool for law enforcement. Their usefulness as a long‐range \ncommunications device is plain. We also think that, under certain conditions, an \nLRAD that is properly calibrated might be a lawful means of ordering (or \nperhaps even compelling) protesters to disperse. We merely hold (1) that, on the \nallegations before us, which we must accept as true, the plaintiffs have stated a \nFourteenth Amendment excessive force claim and (2) that purposefully using the \nLRAD in a manner capable of causing serious injury to move non‐violent \nprotesters to the sidewalks violated law that was clearly established as of 2014.  \nWe are also mindful that the complaint before us is just one side of the \nstory, told from the perspective of the plaintiffs. But courts and juries must assess \nexcessive force claims from “the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, \nincluding what the officer knew at the time, not with the 20/20 vision of \nhindsight.” Kingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2473. It follows that, once the allegations are \ntested by evidence, particularly evidence about what the officers saw and knew, \nthe defendants may yet be entitled to qualified immunity.  \nWe can envision various factual showings that would change the calculus. \nOne key variable is the state of unrest at the protest. The evidence may show that \nthe defendants observed a more violent scene than is portrayed in the complaint \n \n44 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page45 of 46\n \nand incorporated videos. Another key consideration is how the LRAD was used, \nmost notably the volume of the device and its proximity to protesters and \npassersby. And, third, as Kingsley acknowledges, much hinges on what the \ndefendants knew. Perhaps the defendants had not seen the report on the Model \n3300 and lacked knowledge of the LRAD’s harmful effects. The complaint alleges \nthat the NYPD “has not properly trained its officers” on LRAD use and \nacknowledges that Department’s use of force protocols “do not account for \nLRAD use.” FAC ¶¶ 98, 412. So perhaps the defendants had received training \nbut reasonably believed that they were not using the device in an unsafe or \ngratuitous manner. Any one of these non‐exhaustive factors could warrant a \nreappraisal of qualified immunity.   \nFinally, we emphasize that when viewing the evidence from the \nperspective of a reasonable officer a factfinder must afford “ample room for \nmistaken judgments.” Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 343 (1986). This is \nparticularly true where officers “have obligations that tend to tug against each \nother.” Lewis, 523 U.S. at 853.  \nTheir  duty  is  to  restore  and  maintain  lawful  order, \nwhile not exacerbating disorder more than necessary to \ndo their jobs. They are supposed to act decisively and to \n \n45 \n\nCase 17-2065, Document 72-1, 06/13/2018, 2323807, Page46 of 46\n \nshow restraint at the same moment, and their decisions \nhave  to  be  made  in  haste,  under  pressure,  and \nfrequently without the luxury of a second chance. \n \nId. (internal quotation marks omitted). It follows that a jury or a court viewing \nevents from the defendants’ perspective must consider not just what the officers \nsaw and knew, but also the rapidly evolving, uncertain, and tense circumstances \nin which they acted. We trust that discovery will provide fuller insight into this \nperspective.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s order insofar as \nit denied defendants qualified immunity for the Fourteenth Amendment claim. \nThis case is REMANDED for further proceedings. \n \n46 \n\nCase
