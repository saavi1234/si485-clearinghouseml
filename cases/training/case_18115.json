Introduction \nThis  case  concerns  a  policy  adopted  and  implemented  by \nresi:Jondent  American  Cyanamid  Company  (\"Cyanamid\"  or  \"the \nCompany\")  at  its Willow  Island,  West  Virginia  plant,  which \nrequired,  as  a  condition  of  employment  in certain areas  of  the \nplant,  that women  under  the  age  of  50  undergo  surgical \nsterilization  in  order  to  retain  their  jobs,  and  which  resulted \nin  five  female  employees  undergoing  surgical  sterilization. \nThe  Secretary  of  Labor  (\"Secretary\")  issued  a  citation \ncharging  that Cyanamid's  adoption  and  implementation  of  this \npolicy  violated  the  \"general duty  clause\"  of  the  Occupational \nSafety  and  Health  Act  (\"the  Act\"),  29  u.s.c.  S  654 (a) (1).  The \n\n- 2  -\nCompany  moved  for  summary  judgment,  and  the  Occupational  Safety \nand  Health  Review  Commission  (\"the  Review  Commission\")  granted \nthe  motion,  holding  that  the  sterilization policy at  issue  \"is \nnot  a  hazard  cognizable  under  [the  Act].\"  This  petition for \nreview was  thereupon  filed  by  the  Oil,  Chemical  and  Atomic \nWorkers  International  Union  and  its Local  3-499  (\"OCAW\"),  the \nauthorized  collective  bargaining  representative  for  affected \nemployees  at  the  Willow  Island  plant and  a  party  to  the \nproceedings  before  the  Review  Commission. \nB.  Statement  of  Factsl \n1.  The  Nature  of  Cyanamid's  Sterilization \nPolicy,  and  the  Announcement  of  the \nPol~cy \nIn  early  1978,  management  at Cyanamid's  Willow  Island \nplant  issued  a  new  policy  providing  that female  employees  under \n1  The  Commission  decided  this case  on  a  motion  for  summary \njudgment.  Under  the  Commission's  rules,  the  provisions  of  Rule \n56  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  are  applicable  to \nthe  resolution  of  such  a  motion.  See  29  C.F.R.  §  2200.2(b); \nOrder  Granting  Motion  For  Summary  Judgment,  pp.  1-2  and  nn.  2, \n3  (JA  453-454).  Accordingly,  in determining  whether  summary \njudgment  was  properly granted  to  Cyanamid,  the  Court  \"must \naccept  [OCAW's]  version  of  the  facts\"  (Bishop  v.  Wood,  426  u.s. \n341,  347  (1976)),  and  the  evidentiary material  submitted  by  the \nparties must  be  viewed  in  the  light most  favorable  to  OCAW. \nUnited  States  v.

The  Implementation  of  the  Policy,  the  Sterilizations \nthat  Resulted,  and  the  Company's  Failure  to  Consider \nAlternatives \nAlthough  Cyanamid  originally  announced  that  the  sterili \nzation policy  would  apply  to  \"hundreds\"  of  chemic~ls and  to \nmost  departments  at  the  plant,  the  Company  soon  began  to  have \ndoubts  as  to  whether  the  policy would  be  implemented  in  areas \nother  than  the  Pigments  department,  where  employees  were \n17 \nexposed  to  lead. Thus,  in  late February,  Mercer  told  a \ngroup  of  female  employees  that  the  Company  was  unsure  whether \nthe  sterilization rule would  apply  to  chemicals  other  than  lead \nand  departments  other  than  Pigments.  However,  \"Mr.  Mercer  went \non  to  say  that  •••  [even]  those  women  not  subject  to  lead \nexposure  should  consider  surgical  sterilization  to  preclude  the \npossibility of  adverse  personnel  actions  in  the  future  should \nthe  company  expand  upon  the  list of  dangerous  chemicals.\"l8 ' \nAnd  in  subsequent meetings,  \"Mr.  Mercer  advised  [female \nem~loyees]  that  [personnel]  actions  based  on  female  repro-\nductive  hazards  would  most  likely  affect  all  the  women  at  the \nplant  in  the  near  future,  and  that  [the  female  employees] \nshould  all  strongly consider  surgical  sterilization  •••• \"19 \n16  Martin  Statement,  p.  3  (JA  416). \n17  Morgan  letter  (note  7  supra),  pp.  5,  7-8  (JA  444,  446-447). \n18  Murphy  Statement,  p.  2  (JA  435). \n19  !d.,  p.  3  (JA  436). \n\n- 8  -\nThe  deadline  for  female  employees  to  submit  proof  of \nsurgical  sterilization  in  order  to  retain  their  jobs  was \nextended  by  the  Company  from  April  to  October;  and  as  finally \neffectuated,  the  sterilization requirement  applied  only  to  the \nPigments  department.  (The  Company  indicated,  however,  that  the \nrequirement  might  be  extended  to  other  areas  in  the  future.20) \nCyanamid's  policy  achieved  its predictable  result. \nBetween  February  and  June  of  1978,  five  women  employed  in  the \nPigments  department21  -- Betty Moler,  Lola  Rymer,  Donna  Lee \nMartin,  Iris  Braden  and  Barbara  Cantwell  -- underwent  surgical \nsterilization.  Each  did  so  solely  because  under  the  Company's \nrule  surgical  sterilization was  the  only  way  to  retain  her \njob.  As  Lola  Rymer  put  it,  \"Mr.  Mercer  made  it perfectly clear · \nthat  my  choice  was  between  sterilization and  termination  •••• \nI  would  never  have  considered  such  sterilization procedure  had \n22 \nmy  job  not  been  on  the  line.\" In  at  least one  case--\n20  Morgan  letter,  note  7  supra,  pp.  8-11  (JA  477-450). \n21  See  Respondent's  Brief  to  the  Review  Commission,  p.  6. \n22  Rymer  Statement,  p.  3  (JA  412).

In  particular,  both  of \nthose  parties  expressed  their  belief  that  Cyanamid  could  have \nimplemented  a  number  of  alternatives  for  dealing  with  the \nperceived  threat  to  fetal  health  posed  by  exposure  to  lead, \nshort  of  requiring  surgical  sterilization;  OCAW  and  the \nSecretary  explained  that  the  Company's  failure  to  explore  such \nother  methods  would  be  an  important  aspect  of  the  proposed \n42 \ndiscovery. OCAW  and  the  Secretary  also  explained  that \ndiscovery  would  confirm  the  manner  in which  the  formulation \n38  Rule  53(a),  29  C.F.R.  §  2200.53(a),  provides  that  discovery \nby  means  of  depositions  and  interrogatories  may  only  be  taken \nupon  order  of  the  Commission  or  the  ALJ. \n39  The  policy  had  never  been  made  available  in  writing  to \nOCAW,  the  employees  or  the  Secretary. \n40  Secretary's  Interrogatories  (JA  25-35). \n41  See,  e.g.,  JA  192,  194,  211-216,  255-256,  264-265. \n42  See,  e.g,  JA  192,  194-195,  202-207,  221,  226-229. \n\n- 14  -\nand  implementation  of  the  Company's  policy  led  inexorably  t o \nthe  sterilizations  that  took  place.43 \nCyanamid's  attorney,  who  had  sent  to  the  parties  and  to  the \nALJ  a  letter  dated  March  20,  1980,  setting  forth  the  Company's \nversion  of  the  facts,  opposed  the  requested  discovery  and \nannounced  his  intention  to  file  a  motion  for \nsumm~ry \njudgment.44  The  ALJ  suggested  to  OCAW  and  the  Secretary  that \nthey  should  rely  on  Cyanamid's  letter and  forego  discovery;45 \nbut  OCAW  and  the  Secretary  declined  to  do  so,  noting  that  the \nCompany  had  refused  even  to  provide  the  documents  that  were \nidentified  in  Cyanamid's  letter  as  pertaining  to  the  adoption \nand  implementation  of  the  sterilization rule.46 \nThe  ALJ  ruled  that discovery  would  not  be  allowed,  at  least \nat  that  stage  in  the  proceeding.  Instead,  the  parties were \ndirected  to  submit  stipulations,  statements  of  disputed  facts \nand,  if  possible,  a  motion  for  summary  judgment.  The  ALJ  stated \nthat  after  he  had  reviewed  those  submissions  he  would  determine \nwhether  any  discovery  should  be  permitted.47 \n43  See  JA  215-216,  265,  273-274. \n44  JA  220,  277.

The  Secretary  sought  interlocu-\ntory  review  by  the  Commission  of  the  ALJ's  refusal  to  permit \ndiscovery  to  proceed,  but  the  Commission  denied  review.

The  motion  was  accompanied  only  by  a  Memorandum  Of \nPoints  and  Authorities.  Nonetheless,  the  memorandum  contained  a \nnumber  of  factual  assertions  concerning  the  adoption  and \nimplementation  of  the  sterilization policy,  without  citing  any \nevidentiary  support  by  way  of  affidavits or  otherwise.  In \ngeneral,  the  assertions  in  the  memorandum  tracked  Cyanamid's \nAnswer  and  the  letter prepared  by  its attorneys. \nOn  May  15  the  Secretary  submitted  a  proposed  Stipulation of \n49 \nFacts, to  which  Cyanamid  never  responded.  On  June  30  the \nSecretary  submitted  a  Memorandum  In  Opposition  To  Respondent's \nMotion  For  Summary  Judgment,  supported  by  extensive  evidentiary \nmaterial  including  the  sworn  statements  of  numerous  female \nemployees  affected  by  the  sterilization policy.  SO \nOn  July  15,  1980,  the  ALJ  issued  a  decision  granting \nCyanamid's  motion  for  summary  judgment  on  two  grounds,  neither \nof  which  is  the  subject  of  this  review.  First,  the  ALJ  con-\neluded  that  the  citation was  barred  by  the  six-month  statute \nu.s.c. \nof  limitations  set forth  in§  9(c)  of  the  Act,  29 \n5\n§  658(c} • 1  Second,  the  ALJ  held  that  the  citation  should  be \ndismissed  on  the  ground  that  \"two  other  laws  speak  to  such  an \n49  JA  339-354. \n50  JA  355-438. \n51  Order  Granting  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment,  pp.  4-8  (JA \n456-460). \n\n- 16  -\nissue  [as  the  Willow  Island  sterilization policy],  the  National \nLabor  Relations  Act  (NLRA)  as  an  alleged  unfair  labor  practice \nu.s.c. \nand/or  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  42 \n§  2000e  et  seq.,  as  an  alleged  impermissible  'sex  based' \ndiscrimination  issue.\"52 \nOn  review  pursuant  to  §  12(j)  of  the  Act,  29  u.s.c~ \n§  66l(i),  the  Commission  affirmed  the  ALJ's  decision,  but  on  a \ndifferent  ground.  Expressly  declining  to  address  the  two  issues \non  which  the  ALJ  had  ruled,53  the  Commission  held,  by  a  2-1 \nvote,  that  the  citation should  be  vacated  because  \"the  [steri-\nlization]  policy  is  not  a  hazard  cognizable  under  section \n5 (a) (1) • n54 \nAt  the  outset  of  its  analysis  the  Commission  rejected  the \nargument  that  the  Company  had  advanced  on  that  point.  The \nCompany  had  contended  that  the  sterilization  rule  should  be \ndeemed  exempt  from§  5(a) (1)  simply  because  the  act  of  surgical \nsterilization  itself  is  not  performed  \"in  the  workplace.\"55 \n52  Id.,  p.  9  (JA  461).  In  granting  summary  judgment  on  this \nu.s.c. \nbasis,  the  ALJ  relied  on  §  4 (b) (1)  of  the  Act,  29  § \n653 (b)  (1) ,  which  provides: \nNothing  in  this  chapter  shall  apply  to \nworking  conditions  of  employees  with \nrespect  to  which  other  Federal  agencies \nexercise  statutory  authority  to  prescribe \nor  enforce  standards  or  regulations \naffecting  occupational  safety or  health. \n53  See  the  Commission's  Decision,  9  OSHC  1596,  1601  n.  27 \n(JA  509). \n54  Id.  at  1597  (JA  505). \n55  Id.  at  1598  (JA  506). \n\n- 17  -\nThe  Commission  rejected  that  proposition,  stating: \n. In  our  view,  the  critical point  is  not  that \nthe  physical  impact  of  the  policy  on \nemployees,  reduced  functional  capacity due \nto  surgical  sterilization,  was  ultimately \nachieved  outside  the  workplace.  We  agree \n•••  that  it is employer  implementation  of \nthe  policy  that  is  at  issue  here  and  to \nthat  extent  the  policy  is  a  condition  of \nemployment  within  the  meaning  of  the \nAct. 56 \nNonetheless,  the  Commission  concluded  that  \"due  to  its unique \ncharacteristics  this condition  of  employment  is  not  a  hazard \nwithin  the  meaning  of  the  general  duty  clause.\"57  The \nCommission  reached  that conclusion  in  two  steps. \nFirst,  turning  to  the  legislative  history  of  the  Act,  the \nCommission  stated  that  the  hazards  that were  mentioned  in  the \ncongressional  debates  all  involved  \"processes  and  materials \nwhich  cause  injury  or  disease  by  operating  directly  upon \nemployees  as  they  engage  in  work  or  work-related  activi \nties.\"58  The  Commission  contrasted  this case: \nThe  fetus  protection policy  is  of  a \ndifferent character  altogether.  It  is \nneither  a  work  process  nor  a  work  material, \nand  it manifestly  cannot  alter  the  physical \nintegrity  of  employees  while  they  are \nengaged  in  work  or  work-related  activities. \nAn  employee's  decision  to  undergo  steriliza \ntion  in  order  to  gain  or  retain employment \ngrows  out  of  economic  and  social  factors \nwhich  operate  primarily  outside  the  work \nplace.  The  employer  neither  controls  nor \ncreates  these  factors  as  he  creates  or \n56  Id.  at  1599  (JA  507). \n57  Ibid. \n58  Id.  at  1600  (JA  508). \n\n- 18  -\ncontrols  work  processes  and  materials.  For \nthese  reasons  we  conclude  that  the  policy \nis  not  a  hazard  within  the  meaning  of  the \ngeneral  duty  clause. \nIt  is  true,  as  the  Secretary  points \nout,  that  the  Act  is  broad  in  scope  and  may \nbe  fairly described  as  intended  to  protect \nemployees  from  reduced  functional  capacity \nas  a  result  of  the  work  experience. \nHowever,  it does  not  follow  that  the \ngeneral  duty  clause  applies  to  an  employ \nment  policy  whose  physical  impact  on \nemployees  is  indirect  and  derives  not  from \nwork  processes  and  materials  but  from \nsocial  and  economic  factors  outside  the \nworkplace.S9 \nSecond,  recognizing  that  a  sterilization  rule  of  the  sort \nat  issue  here  was  simply  \"unknown  at  the  time  of  enactment\"  of \nthe  statute,  and  that  the  absence  of  any  legislative  history \nwith  respect  to  such  a  hazard  can  therefore  hardly  be  construed \nas  an  affirmative  determination  to  exempt  this  hazard  from  the \nreach  of  the  Act,  the  Commission  staied  its understanding  of  the \nrules  of  statutory  construction  that  apply  in  such  a  situation. \nThe  Commission  acknowledged  that  in  some  instances  \"a  statute \ncan  operate  prospectively  so  as  to  include  circumstances  unknown \nat  the  time  of  enactment  ••• ,\"but declared  that  the  test  to  be \napplied  is  whether  the  \"unforeseen  circumstance  •••  is \n'substantially comparable'  to  those  actually  contemplated  by \n60 \nCongress.\" And,  the  Commission  parsed  that  test  to  mean \nthat  the  circumstances  must  be  \"comparable  •••  in  substantially \n59  Ibid.  (footnote  omitted). \n60  Ibid. \n\n- 19  -\nall  respects.\"61  In  this  case,  the  Commission  concluded  that \nits  test  was  not  met:  \"[t]he definition  of  hazard  proposed  by \nthe  Secretary  is  not,  under  any  fair  reading  of  the  legislative \nhistory,  substantially comparable  to  the  concept  of  hazard \n62 \nentertained  by  Co  ngress  1' n  pass1·n  g  th e  •••  Ac  t  •••• \" On \nthat  basis  the  Commission  held,  over  the  dissent .of  Commissioner \nCottine,  that  the  citation  \"fails  to  allege  a  violation  cogni-\nzable  under  the  general  duty  clause;\"  and  the  Commission  vacated \nthe  citation.63 \nThis  petition for  review  was  thereupon  timely  filed  by \nOCAW.  The  Commission  was  named  as  the  respondent.  Cyanamid \nmoved  to  intervene,  and  moved  to  dismiss  the  petition for \nreview,  arguing  that  OCAW  was  not  a  proper  petitioner  and  that \nthe  Commission  was  not  a  proper  respondent.  This  Court  denied \nthe  motion  to  dismiss,  and  granted  OCAW's  motion  to  amend  the \ncaption  to  dismiss  the  Commission  and  to  add  Cyanamid  as  a  party \nrespondent.

In  the  proceeding \nunder  review  the  Commission  held,  by  a  2-1  vote,  that  Cyanamid's \nsterilization policy  did  not  fall within  the  purview  of  the  Act. \nIn  this  submission  we  show  that  the  Commission's  decision \nshould  be  reversed.  Our  presentation proceeds  in  four  parts. \nIn  part A,  we  first  establish  that  the  Company's \nsterilization policy  falls  within  the  plain  meaning  of  the \nstatutory  language.  Pp.  24-26,  infra.  It  is clear  that  the \npolicy  bears  directly  upon  \"employment.\"  And,  just  as  a \nchemical  which  induces  sterilization would  be  termed  a \n\"hazard,\"  so  too  this policy,  which  has  the  same  effect,  is  a \n\"hazard.\"  Cyanamid  failed  to  provid~ employment  \"free  from\" \nthe  hazard  of  the  sterilization policy;  and  that  hazard  was \n\"recognized,\"  as  that  term  is  used  in§  S(a) (1),  since  the \nevidence  strongly  suggests  Cyanamid's  own  awareness  that  its \nnew  rule  would  likely  -- indeed  almost  certainly  -- cause \n\n- 21  -\nemployees  to  undergo  surgical  sterilization.  It  is manifest \nthat  the  Company's  policy  was  \"causing  or  likely  to  cause  ••• \nserious  harm  to  •  employees.\"  Thus,  each  of  the  elements \nof  a  violation  of  the  general  duty  clause,  as  set out  in  the \nplain  language  of  the  clause,  is  present  in  this  case. \nWe  next  turn  in  part  B  to  consider  the  basis  on  which  the \nCommission  concluded  that  the  policy  is  nevertheless  outside \nthe  scope  of  the  Act.  Pp.  26-31,  infra.  In  reaching  that \nconclusion  the  Commission  did  not  rely  on  the  language  of  the \nstatute;  instead,  the  Commission  relied on  its perception  that \nthe  sterilization policy  is  not  \"substantially comparable\"  to \nthe  particular  hazards  that were  mentioned  in  the  congressional \ndebates,  which  involved  \"work  processes  and  materials.\"  As  we \nshow,  the  Commission's  attempt  to  \"confine[  [the  general duty \nclause]  to  the  'particular  application[s]  ••• contemplated  by \nthe  legislators\"  violates  established  tenets  of  statutory \nconstruction.  Diamond  v.  Chakrabarty,  447  u.s.  303,  315 \n(1980).  Both  the  language  of  §  5(a) (1)  and  its  legislative \nhistory  -- which  shows  that  the  general  duty  clause  was \nintended  to  require  employers  \"to  bring  no  adverse  effects  to \nthe  life  and  health  of  their  employees  throughout  the  course  of \ntheir  employment\"64  -- \"fairly  bring[  [the  sterilization \nu.s. \npolicy]  within  [the]  statute.\"  Barr  v.  United  States,  324 \n83,  90  (1945).  The  fact  that  the  legislative  history  contains \nreferences  to  hazards  involving  work  processes  and  materials, \nbut  not  to  sterilization  policies,  does  not  reflect  a  decision \n64  s.  Rep.  No.  91-1282,  9lst  Cong~,  2d  Sess.  9  (1970);  H. \nRep.  No.  91-1291,  9lst  Cong.,  2d  Sess.  21  (1970). \n\n- 22  -\nto  exclude  the  latter  from  the  scope  of  the  Act,  particularly \ngiven  the  fact  that  sterilization policies were  \"unknown  at  the \ntime  of  enactment\"  of  the  statute.65  There  is  no  basis  for \nconcluding  that  \"had  [such  a  practice]  been  foreseen,  Congress \nwould  have  so  varied  its comprehensive  language  as  to  exclude \nit from  the  operation  of  the  act.\"  People  of  Puerto  Rico  v. \nu.s. \nShell  Co.,  302  253,  257  (1937).  To  the  contrary,  the \nCongress  that  enacted  the  general  duty  to  ensure  that employers \nwould  \"bring  no  adverse  effects  to  the  life and  health  of  their \nemployees  throughout  the  course  of  their  employment\"  would \nsurely  have  condemned  Cyanamid's  policy.  Thus,  the \nCommission's  attempt  to  confine  the  general  duty  clause  to \n\"work  processes  and  materials\"  is  unfounded. \nWe  next  demonstrate  in  part  C  that  the  distinction drawn \nby  the  Commission  between  the  hazard  at  issue  here  and  hazards \ninvolving  \"work  processes  and  materials\"  cannot  withstand \nanalysis  even  on  its own  terms.  Pp.  31-38,  infra.  The \nCommission's  assertion  that  the  injury  caused  by  the \nsterilization policy  \"grows  out  of  economic  and  social  factors\" \nwhich  \"the  employer  neither  controls  nor  creates\"66  simply \nignores  the  nature  of  Cyanamid's  role  in  the  promulgation  and \nimplementation  of  the  policy.  Moreover,  even  if  the \nCommission's  assertion  were  well-founded,  it would  not  provide \n65  9  OSHC  at  1600  (JA  508). \n66  9  OSHC  at  1600  (JA  508). \n\n- 23  -\na  principled  distinction  between  this  case  and  a  case  involving \nexposure  to  a  sterilizing  chemical  (i.e.,  a  \"work  material\"). \nIn  both  cases  employees  are  confronted  with  a  \"choice\"  between \ntheir  livelihood  and  their  health.  To  the  extent  that  the \nchoice  is  affected  by  \"economic  and  social  factors,\"  it is  so \naffected  in  both  cases.  The  critical point common  to  both \ncases  is  that  the  \"choice\"  is  inimical  to  the  policies  of  the \nAct.  Pp.  31-33,  infra.  What  is more,  the  Commission's  attempt \nto  confine  the  general  duty  clause  to  \"work  processes  and \nmaterials\"  is contrary  to  the  Commission's  own  recent  caselaw \n(pp.  34-35,  infra),  and  would,  if accepted,  unjustifiably \nexempt  a  number  of  serious  occupational  hazards  from  the  reach \nof  the  Act.  Pp.  35-38,  infra. \nThese  considerations  amply  demonstrate  that  the  Commis \nsion  erred  in  granting  summary  judgment  to  Cyanamid,  and  that \nits order  should  be  set  aside.  As  a  final  matter  (in  Part  D  at \npp.  38-42},  we  recognize  that  Cyanamid  has  maintained  that  its \nsterilization policy  was  adopted  for  the  purpose  of  protecting \npotential  fetuses,  and  that  an  issue  may  therefore  arise  on \nremand  as  to  whether  such  a  purpose  can  immunize  a  policy  that \nwould  otherwise  violate  the  Act.  However,  while  it  is  extremely \nunlikely  that Cyanamid  could  ever  prevail  on  such  a  contention \nin  this  case,  this  issue  was  not  addressed  by  the  Commission, \nand  the  facts  on  which  it depends  are  in  dispute.  Conse \nquently,  the  issues  as  to  any  possible  justification for \nCyanamid's  policy  are  not  before  the  Court.  The  order  of  the \nCommission  should  therefore  be  reversed  and  the  case  remanded \nfor  further  proceedings. \n\n------------------------------------------------~------- - -- -\n- 24  -\nA.  The  Sterilization  Policy  Falls  Within  the \nPlain  Meaning  of  the  General  Duty  Clause. \nThe  general  duty  clause  of  the  Act  provides  that  \"each \nemployer  shall  furnish  to  each  of  his  employees  employment  and \na  place  of  employment  which  are  free  from  recognized  hazards \nthat  are  causing  or  likely  to  cause  death  or  serious  physical \nharm  to  his  employees.\"  29  u.s.c.  §  654(a) (1) .67 \nThe  sterilization  rule  at  issue  in  this  case  falls  within \nthe  plain meaning  of  that  statutory  language.  First,  it is \nclear  that  the  rule  bears  directly  upon  \"employment.\"  Indeed, \nthe  Company  promulgated  and  implemented  the  sterilization \npolicy  as  a  \"condition  of employment\"  -- a  fact  which  the \n68 \nCommission  expressly  acknowledged.\"\nSecond,  just as  a  chemical  which  induces  sterilization \nwould  be  termed  a  \"hazard,\"  so  too  this policy,  which  had  the \nsame  effect  of  harming  the  functional  capacity  of  female  Willow \nIsland  employees,  was  a  \"hazard\"  to  those  employees. \nThird,  Cyanamid  obviously  failed  to  furnish  employment \n6\n\"free  from\"  the  hazard  of  the  sterilization policy; 9  and \n67  The  clause  thus  \"plac[es]  on  employers  a  mandatory  obliga \ntion  independent  of  the  specific  health  and  safety  standards  to \nbe  promulgated  by  the  Secretary.\"  Whirlpool  Corp.  v.  Marshall, \n445  u.s.  1,  13  (1980). \n68  9  OSHC  at  1599  (JA  507). \n69  Construing  the  word  \"free\"  as  it appears  in  §  5(a) (1), \nthis  Court  has  held  that  the  general  duty  clause  is  not  vio \nlated  by  \"unpreventable\"  hazards,  because  an  employer  cannot \npossibly  provide  employment  that  is  \"free\"  of  such  hazards. \nNational  Realty  and  Constr.  Co.  v.  OSHRC,  489  F.2d  1257, \n1265-1267  (D.C.  Cir.  1973);  Whirlpool  Corp.  v.  OSHRC,  645  F.2d \n1096,  1098  {D.C.  Cir.  1981).  Here,  the  Company  deliberately \nadopted  the  challenged  sterilization  rule.  It cannot  be \nclaimed  that  the  adoption  of  the  rule  was  somehow  \"unpre \nventable.\" \n\n- 25  -\nthe  hazard  was  \"recognized,\"  as  that  term  is  used  in  §  5 (a) (1) •. \n\"A  hazard  is  deemed  'recognized'  when  the  potential  danger  of  a \ncondition  or  activity  is  either  actually  known  to  the  particu-\nlar  employer  or  generally  known  in  the  industry.\"  St.  Joe \nMinerals  v.  OSHRC,  647  F.2d  840,  845  (8th  Cir.  1981).  See  also \nNational  Realty  & Constr.  Co.  v.  OSHRC,  489  F.2d  1257,  1265  and \nn.  32  (D.C.  Cir.  1973).  That  test  has  been  met  here.  The \nevidence  strongly  suggests  Cyanamid's  own  awareness  that  its \nnew  rule  would  cause  employees  to  undergo  surgical \nsterilization;  at  the  very  least,  the  record  does  not  permit  a \ncontrary conclusion  at  the  summary  judgment  stage. \nFinally,  it appears  to  be  conceded,  as  it must  be,  that \nsurgical  sterilization constitutes  \"serious physical  harm.\"70 \nAnd,  on  this  record,  it is evident  that  Cyanamid's  policy was \n\"causing  or  likely  to  cause\"  that  harm.  The  circumstances \nsurrounding  the  promulgation  and  implementation  of  the  policy \nmake  clear  that  the  policy  was  \"likely\"  -- indeed,  almost \ncertain  to  cause  employees  to  undergo  surgical  steriliza-\n1 \ntion;7 and  the  sworn  statements  of  female  employees  establish \n70  Cf.  Skinner  v.  Oklahoma,  316  U.S.  535,  541  (1942) \n(recognizing  that  sterilization constitutes  \"irreparable \ninjury\").  In  addition  to  the  loss  of  a  vital  function  that  is \ninherent  in  sterilization  itself,  the  surgery  can  involve \nserious  complications,  as  was  true  in  the  case  of  employee \nBarbara  Cantwell.  See  pp.  8-9,  supra. \n71  See  pp.  3-9,  supra. \n\n- 26  -\nthat  the  policy  did  in  fact  produce  that  result  in  five \ninstances~72 \nThus,  each  of  the  elements  of  a  violation  of  the  general \nduty  clause,  as  set out  in  the  plain  language  of  the  clause,  is \npresent  in  this case. \nB.  Nothing  in  the  Legislative  History  Exempts \nthe  Sterilization  Policy  from  the  Reach \nof  the  General  Duty  Clause. \nThe  Commission  did  not  directly confront  the  foregoing \nanalysis.  It concluded  nonetheless  that Cyanamid's  steriliza-\ntion  policy  was  not  a  \"hazard\"  within  the  meaning  of  the  Act, \nbecause,  in  its view,  the  Act  was  intended  to  apply  only  to \n\"processes  and  materials  which  cause  injury  or  disease  by \noperating  directly  upon  employees  as  they  engage  in  work  or \n7\nwork-related  activities.\" 3  In  the  Commission's  shorthand \nphrase,  only  \"work  processes  and  materials\"  are  within  the \n74 \npurview  of  the  Act. As  we  now  show,  the  limitation which \nthe  Commission  engrafted  upon  the  Act  cannot  be  sustained. \nThe  Commission  did  not  purport  to  find  that  limitation  in \nthe  language  of§  S(a} (l},  or  in  any  explicit  legislative \nhistory.  Instead,  the  Commission  fashioned  a  rule  of  statutory \n72  Even  if Cyanamid  had  disputed  these  points,  which  it did \nnot,  they  would  have  to  be  taken  as  true  in  ruling  on \nCyanamid's  motion  for  summary  judgment.  See  note  1,  supra. \n73  9  OSHC  at  1600  (JA  508}. \n74  Ibid. \n\n----------------------------------------~-----------\n- 27  -\nconstruction  under  which§  5(a) (l)  would  be  confined  to  the \nparticular  types  of  hazards  that were  mentioned  in  the  debates \npreceding  the  enactment  of  the  statute,  and  other  hazards \n7\n\"substantially comparable\"  to  them. 5  Applying  that \napproach,  the  Commission  prepared  a  catalogue  of  the  various \nhazards  that  were  mentioned  in  the  debates,  and  noted  that \nthose  hazards  involved  \"work  processes  and  materials.\"76 \nSince  Cyanamid'  sterilization policy  is  not  a  work  process  or \nmaterial,  the  Commission  concluded  that  the  policy  is  not \n\"substantially comparable\"  to  the  hazards  mentioned  in  the \ndebates,  and  is  thus,  under  the  Commission's  rule  of  con \nstruction,  outside  the  reach  of  §  5 (a) (l). \nThe  approach  followed  by  the  Commission  is contrary  to \nestablished  tenets  of  statutory construction.  \"[The  Supreme] \nCourt  frequently  has  observed  that  a  statute  is  not  to  be \nconfined  to  the  'particular  application[s]  •••  contemplated  by \nu.s. \nthe  legislators.'\"  Diamond  v.

Rather, \n\"if  Congress  has  made  a  choice  of  language  which  fairly  brings \na  given  situation  within  a  statute,  it is  unimportant  that  the \nparticular  application  may  not  have  been  contemplated  by  the \nu.s. \nlegislators.\"  Barr,  supra,  324  at  90.  Thus,  where  the \n75  Id.  at  1600-1601  (JA  508-509). \n76  Id.  at  1599-1600  (JA  507-508). \n\n- 28  -\nlanguage  of  a  statute  is  broad  enough  to  embrace  a  situation \nthat  Congress  did  not  foresee,  the  statute  will  be  applied  to \nthat  situation  unless  it can  be  concluded  that  \"had  [the \nsituation]  been  foreseen,  Congress  would  have  so  varied  its \ncomprehensive  language  as  to  exclude  it from  the  operation  of \nthe  act.\"  People  of  Puerto  Rico,  supra,  302  U.S.  at  257. \nAs  we  have  already  shown,  the  language  of  §  5(a} (1} \n\"fairly  brings  [the  sterilization policy]  within  [the]  statute\" \n(Barr,  supra}.  See  pp.  24-26,  supra.

Far  from  limiting  the  reach  of \n§  5(a) (1),  the  committee  reports  confirm  that  the  general  duty \nclause  was  meant  to  apply  as  broadly  as  its language  suggests: \n77  Similarly,  the  Act  defines  an  occupational  safety  and \nhealth  standard  as  \"a  standard  which  requires  conditions,  or \nthe  adoption  or  use  of  one  or  more  practices,  means,  methods, \noperations,  or  processes,  reasonably  necessary  or  appropriate \nto  provide  safe  or  healthful  employment  and  places  of  employ \nment.\"  §  3(8),  29  u.s.c.  §  652(8)  (emphasis  added}.  Other \nprovisions  of  the  Act  likewise  speak  broadly  of  harms  \"arising \nout  of  employment\"  (§  2 (b) (13),  29  u.s.c.  §  651 (b) (13}}  or  \"as \na  result  of  [an  employee's]  work  experience\"  (§  2(b} (7},  29 \nu.s.c.  §  651 (b)  (7}},  or  \"out  of  work  situations\"  (§  2 (a),  29 \nu.s.c.  §  65l(a)),  or  \"working  conditions\"  (§  2(b} (1},  (2},  (4}, \n29  u.s.c.  §  651 (b) (1),  (2),  (4)).  The  purpose  of  the  Act  is \nstated  in  equally  broad  terms:  \"to  assure  so  far  as  possible \nevery  working  man  and  woman  in  the  Nation  safe  and  healthful \nworking  conditions  and  to  preserve  our  human  resources.\" \n(§  2(b),  29  u.s.c.  §  65l(b).) \n(Continued) \n\nl \n- 29  -\nUnder  principles  of  common  law,  individuals \n. are  obliged  to  refrain  from  actions  which \ncause  harm  to  others.  Courts  often  refer  to \nthis  as  a  general  duty  to  others.  Statutes \n~sually increase  but  sometimes  modify  this \nduty.  The  Committee  believes  that employers \n~ equally  bound  by  this general  and  common \nduty  to  bring  no  adverse  effects  to  the  life \nand  health  of  their  employees  throughout  the \ncourse  of  their  employment.

See  9 \nOSHC  at  1599  (JA  507).  But  the  fact  that  Congress  did  not \nprovide  a  definition  of  \"hazard\"  simply  indicates  that Congress \nintended  that  the  term  be  given  its ordinary meaning;  it in  no \nway  suggests  a  need  to  search  the  legislative  history  for  some \nmore  limited  meaning.  \"The  subject-matter  provisions  of  the  ••• \nlaw  have  been  cast  in  broad  terms  to  fulfill  the  •••  statutory \ngoal  ••••  Broad  general  language  is  not  necessarily ambiguous \nwhen  congressional  objectives  require  broad  terms.\"  Diamond  v. \nChakrabarty,  supra,  447  u.s.  at  315.

To  the \ncontrary,  as  the  Supreme  Court  has  noted  of  this  very  statute, \n\"safety  legislation  is  to  be  liberally construed  to  effectuate \nthe  congressional  purpose.\"  Whirlpool  Corp.  v.

The  fact  that \nthe  legislators mentioned  such  hazards  but  not  others  such  as \nthat  at  issue  here  is hardly surprising,  particularly given  the \nfact,  acknowledged  by  the  Commission,  that  the  kind  of  practice \n78  A  review  of  the  snippets  of  legislative  history cited  by \nthe  Commission  (9  OSHC  at  1599-1600,  nn.  17-21  (JA  507-508)  will \nreveal  that none  of  the  cited  statements purports  to  define  the \nprecise  contours  of  the  general  duty clause,  and  none  can  fairly \nbe  read  to  suggest  that  the  clause  is  limited  to  work  processes \nand  materials.  In  virtually every  case  the  context  of  the \nstatements  is  such  that  the  speaker  was,  at most,  simply \nmentioning  one  or  two  obvious  kinds  of  hazards  that would  be \ncovered  by  the  Act.  Indeed,  in  many  of  the  cited passages  the \nspeaker  was  not  even  addressing  the  coverage  of§  5(a) (1)  or  any \nother  substantive provision  of  the  Act.  To  take  a  typical \nexample,  at footnote  18  of  its opinion  the  Commission  cites  the \nfollowing  statement  of  Senator  Saxbe,  presumably  because  it uses \nthe  word  \"accident\": \nIn  this  bill there  is,  for  the  first  time,  an \neffort  to  study  the  various  and  differing \nworkmen's  compensation  laws  of  the  several \nstates,  to  see  if  they  provide  adequate \nbenefits,  because  at  the  present  time  many \nStates  have  very  good  benefits,  and  others \nhave  deplorable  benefits,  where  an  accident \nat work  literally puts  the  family  on  relief \nor  at  least makes  it a  public charge  at  some \ntime  in  the  future.

To \nthe  contrary,  the  Congress  that enacted  the  general duty clause \nfor  the  purpose  of  ensuring  that employers  would  \"bring  no \nadverse  effects  to  the  life and  health  of  their employees \nthroughout  the  course  of  their  employment\"  (p.  29,  supra)  would \nsurely  have  condemned  a  practice  that causes  employees  as  a \ncondition  of  retaining  their  jobs  to  surrender  their  functional \ncapacity  to  bear  children  by  submitting  to  surgical \nsterilization. \nC.  The  Commission's  Attempt  to  Confine  the \nGeneral  Duty  Clause  to  \"Work  Processes \nand  Materials\"  is  Unsound  Even  on  Its Own \nTerms,  is  Inconsistent With  the  Commission's \nPrior  Cases,  and,  if Accepted,  Would  Frustrate \nthe  Objectives  of  the  Statute. \nThe  distinction drawn  by  the  Commission  between  Cyanamid's \nsterilization policy  and  \"work  processes  and  materials\"  cannot \nwithstand  analysis  even  on  its own  terms.  The  Commission \n79  9  OSHC  at  1600  (JA  508). \n\n- 32  -\nasserts  that  \"an  employee's  decision  to  undergo  sterilization \nin  order  to  gain  or  retain employment  grows  out  of  economic  and \nsocial factors  which  operate  primarily outside  the  workplace. \nThe  employer  neither  controls  nor  creates  these  factors  as  he \n° \n8\ncreates  or  controls work  processes  and  materials.\" Conse \nquently,  in  the  Commission's  view,  the  \"physical  impact  [of  the \nsterilization policy]  on  employees  is  indirect  and  derives  not \nfrom  work  processes  and  materials  but  from  social and  economic \n81 \nfactors  outside  the  workplace.\" It was  \"[f]or  these \nreasons\"  that  the  Commission  viewed  the  sterilization policy \nas  \"of  [such]  a  different character\"  from  \"work  processes  and \nmaterials\"  as  to  be  outside  the  scope  of  the  general duty \n2 \nclause.8 But  the  Commission's  reasons  are  unsound. \n1.  In  the  first place,  to  suggest,  as  the  Commission \ndoes,  that  the  Company  had  no  \"control\"  over  the  factors  that \ncaused  its five  employees  to  undergo  sterilization  is  to  ignore \nthe  fact  that Cyanamid  designed  and  implemented  its policy so \nas  to  maximize  the  likelihood  that  the  employees  would  undergo \nsterilization.  See  pp.  3-9,  supra.  In  particular,  it was \nCyanamid  that determined  precisely what  the  economic  conse \nquences  would  be  if an  employee  did  not  undergo  sterilization. \nThus,  to  assert  that  this case  concerns  \"economic  ••• factors \n[which]  [t]he  employer  neither  controls  nor  creates\"  is \n80  9  OSHC  at  1600  (JA  508). \n81  Ibid. \n82  Ibid. \n\n- 33  -\nsimply  wrong.  What  is more,  even  if  the  impact  of  the \nsterilization rule  could  properly  be  said  to  depend  on  \"social \nand  economic  factors  outside  the  workplace,\"  that point would \nbe  of  no  significance.  In  this case,  employees  had  in  effect \ntwo  choices:  to  undergo  sterilizaton,  or  to  quit.83  That \nsuch  a  \"choice\"  offends  the  Act  can  be  seen  from  the  fact  that \nif,  instead  of  a  sterilization policy,  the  hazard  at  issue  in \nthis case  had  consisted  of  exposure  to  a  sterilizing chemical, \nemployees  would  have  had  the  same  choices:  to  undergo \nsterilization,  or  to  quit.  To  whatever  extent  \"social  and \neconomic  factors  outside  the  workplace\"  would  influence  the \nchoice  in  the  one  case,  they  would  do  so  equally  in  the  other. \n84 \nAs  Commissioner  Cottine  noted  in  dissent, the  Commission \nwould  not  suggest  that  the  presence  of  such  factors  would \nremove  the  sterilizing  chemical  from  the  ambit  of  the  Act,  and \nthere  is  no  logical  basis  for  suggesting  that  the  presence  of \nsuch  factors  should  remove  the  sterilization policy  from  the \nambit  of  the  Act.  In  either case,  the  \"choice.\"  between  one's \nlivelihood  and  one's  physical  integrity  is  inimical  to  the \npolicies  of  the  statute.  Cf.  Whirlpool  Corp.  v.  Marshall, \n85 \nsupra.\n83  In  this  regard  see  especially p.  8  and  note  22,  supra. \n84  9  OSHC  at  1603  (JA  511). \n85  That  the  Act  does  not  permit  an  employer  to  justify a \nhealth  hazard  by  contending  that  employees  have  made  an \neconomic  choice  to  endure  the  hazard  was  also  recognized  by \nthis  Court  in  United  Steelworkers  of  America  v.  Marshall, \nsupra,  647  F.2d  at 1237-1238.  The  Court  there  approved  a \nprovision  of  OSHA's  Lead  Standard  which  requires  employers  to \n(Continued} \n\n- 34  -\n2.  What  is more,  the  Commission's  attempt  to  confine  the \ngeneral  duty  clause  to  \"work  processes  and  procedures\"  is \ninconsistent  with  its own  recent  case  law.  See  C.R.  Burnett \nand  Sons,  Inc.,  9  OSHC  1009  (1980).  There,  the  question was \nwhether  conditions  at  temporary  labor  camps  where  employers \nprovided  housing  to migrant  farm  workers  were  within  the  scope \nof  the  Act.  The  workers  were  not  required  by  their  employers \nto  reside  in  the  camps;  nor  did  they  perform  work  in  the \ncamps.  And  the  violations  for  which  the  employers  were  cited \ndid  not  involve  work  processes  or  materials;  they  involved  the \nadequacy  of  the  shelters  that were  provided  in  the  camps,  and \n8\nthe  conditions  of  the  open  areas  surrounding  the  shelters. 6 \nIn  determining  whether  the  Act  applied  to  the  conditions \nat  issue  in  C.R.  Burnett,  the  Commission  did  not  confine  the \nambit  of  the  Act  to work  processes  or  materials.  Instead,  the \nCommission  stated  that  the  question  to  be  decided  was  \"whether \na  particular condition  bears  a  sufficient nexus  to  employment \n87 \nto  permit  enforcement  of  the  Act.•• The  Commission  held \nthat  such  a  nexus  can  be  found  whenever  a  hazard  constitutes  a \n85  (cont'd) \nprotect  the  wages  and  seniority  rights  of  employees  who  are \nrequired  to  be  removed  from  their  jobs  as  a  result  of  high \nblood-lead  levels.  The  Court  held  that  the  provision was \nneeded  in  order  to  assure  that employees  who  might  \"h[o]ld  job \nsecurity more  dear  than  their  health\"  would  not  be  dissuaded  by \na  potential  loss  of  earnings  from  undergoing  examinations  that \nmight  result  in  a  medically  necessary  transfer.  · \n86  9  OSHC  at  1010,  n.  1. \n87  Id.  at  1018. \n\n- 35  -\n88 \n\"condition  of  employment.\" And,  going  further,  the \nCommission  held  that  even  where,  as  in  C.R.  Burnett,  the  cited \nhazard  was  not  strictly a  condition  of  employment,  the  Act \napplies  if  the  hazard  \"bears  a  'direct  relationship  to \n88\nemployment.•\" a \nThus,  the  Commission's  express  holding  in  C.R.  Burnett \ncannot  be  reconciled  with  its conclusion  in  this case  that  the \nAct  applies  only  to  \"work  processes  and  materials.\"  What  is \nmore,  under  the  test adopted  in  C.R.  Burnett  (\"direct \nrelationship  to  employment\"),  it is clear  that  the  hazard  at \nissue  in  this  case  is cognizable  under  the  Act.  Indeed,  the \nsame  result would  follow  even  under  the  test  that  the \nCommission  rejected  as  unduly  stringent  (\"condition  of \n89 \nemployment\").\n3.  As  this discussion  indicates,  the  Commission's  attempt \nto  narrow  the  reach  of  the  Act  to  \"work  processes  and  materials\" \n88  Ibid.  In  the  case  of  a  temporary  labor  camp,  the  Commis \nsion  stated  that  the  \"condition  of  employment\"  test would  be \nmet  \"if  employees  are  expressly  or,  by  circumstance,  construc \ntively  required  to  live  in  the  camp.\"  Ibid. \n88a  Ibid. \n89  C.R.  Burnett  involved  a  specific  standard,  29  C.F.R. \n§  1910.142,  rather  than  the  general  duty  clause.  But \nstandards,  like  hazards  that  are  cited  under  the  general  duty \nclause,  must  be  directed  to  \"employment  and  places  of \nemployment.\"  Compare§  3(8),  29  u.s.c.  §  652(8),  with§ \n5 (a) (1),  29  u.s.c.  §  654 (a) (1).  Thus  the  holding  in  C.R. \nBurnett  is  fully  applicable  here.  And,  as  the  Commission  noted \nin  C.R.  Burnett,  the  construction  of  the  Act  articulated  in \nthat  case  had  previously  been  adopted  in  Sugar  Cane  Growers \nCooperative  of  Florida,  4  OSHC  1320  (1976),  in  which  the \nCommission  held  that  the  general  duty  clause  required  an \nemployer  to  protect  the  safety  of  farm  workers  while  they  were \ndriven  to  and  from  the  fields  in  employer-provided  trucks.  See \nC.R.  burnett,  9  OSHC  at  1014-1015,  1018. \n\n- 36  -\nwould,  if accepted,  seriously  undermine  the  ability  of  the \nstatute  to  achieve  the  purpose  set  by  Congress.  To  be  sure, \nthe  vast  majority  of  employment  hazards  do  involve  work \nprocesses  and  materials.  But  there  are  significant employment \nhazards  that  do  not  fit  into  that mold.  To  take  only  one \nexample,  serious  hazards  have  frequently  been  found  to  be \npresent  in worksite  facilities  such  as  lavatories,  lunchrooms \nand  shower  rooms.  These  do  not  involve  \"work  ptocesses  and \nmaterials,\"  yet  we  expect  even  Cyanamid  would  concede  that  such \nhazards  are  within  the  scope  of  the  Act.  Indeed,  they  are  the \nsubject  of  a  specific  standard  that  has  been  adopted  by  the \n90 \nSecretary.  See  29  C.F.R.  §  1910.141. \nThis  case  presents  another  type  of  hazard  which,  albeit \nfortunately  less common,  is  as  insidious  as  any  \"work  process \nor  material\"  -- an  attempt  by  an  employer  to  \"control\"  expo-\nsure  to  a  chemical  by  tampering  with  employees'  bodies.  In \naddition  to  the  sterilization policy  at  issue  in  this case, \nsuch  \"control\"  techniques  have  been  implemented  by  certain \nemployers  in  at  least one  other  related context,  which  provides \nan  apt  illustration of  the  kinds  of  practices  that might  be \nexempt  from  the  reach  of  the  Act  if  the  Commission's  new \ndoctrine  of  \"work  processes  and  materials\"  were  to  be  upheld. \n90  Similarly,  even  outside  the  workplace,  certain facilities \nor  services  provided  by  the  employer,  which  employees  are \nexpected  to  use,  can  present  serious  hazards  that  the  Commis \nsion  has  acknow1edged  to  be  within  the  scope  of  the  Act,  such \nas  the  housing  provided  in  C.R.  Burnett  and  the  transportation \nprovided  in  Sugar  Cane  Growers,  supra  note  89. \n\n- 37  -\nIn  promulgating  the  standard  regulating  occupational \nexposure  to  lead,  the  Secretary  learned  that numerous  employers \nwere  engaging  in  the  practice  of  \"prophylactic  chelation,\" \nwhereby  chemical  agents  were  routinely administered  to  employ-\nees  in  order  to  keep  their  blood  lead  levels  from  rising, \ndespite  the  fact  that  the  chelating  agents produced  severe \nside  effects  such  as  nervousness,  nausea  and  increased  blood \npressure,  and  despite  the  consensus  of  medical  experts  that \nprophylactic  chelation  is  an  unacceptable  procedure.  See  43 \nFed.  Reg.  53001-53004  (Nov.  14,  1978).  Confronted  with  this \ngrave  problem,  the  Secretary determined  that employers  should \nbe  prohibited  from  having  prophylactic chelation performed, \n\"whatever  the  setting,\"  be  it at  the  workplace  or  in  a \nhospital.  Id.  at  53002.91  The  Secretary  therefore  promul-\ngated  in  the  lead  standard  a  provision which  requires  that \n\"(t]he  employer  shall  assure  that  any  person  whom  he  retains, \nemploys,  supervises  or  controls  does  not  engage  in  prophylactic \nchelation  of  any  employee  at  any  time.\"  29  C.F.R.  §  1910.1025 \n(j) {4) {i). \nLike  the  sterilization policy  at  issue  here,  the  chelation \npractices  prohibited  by  the  lead  standard  (i)  do  not  involve \n\"work  processes  and  materials,\"  (ii)  generally  take  place \noutside  the  workplace,  and  {iii)  generally  involve  employee \n\"consent\"  given  in  order  to  retain one's  job.  Not  even  the \n91  Although  chelation  was  performed  in  some  workplaces,  it \nwas  often performed  at a  physician's  office  or  in  a  hospital. \nSee  id.  at  53002,  53004. \n\n- 38  -\nlead  industry,  in  its broad-scale  assault on  the  lead  standard \nin  this  Court,  suggested  that  the  Act  could  not  apply  to  such \npractices.  See  United  Steelworkers  v.  Marshall,  supra.  Yet  if \nthe  Commission's  attempt  to  narrow  the  scope  of  the  Act  to \n\"work  processes  and  materials\"  were  to  prevail,  OSHA's  ability \nto  regulate  practices  such  as  prophylactic chelation would  be \nseverely  impeded. \nThus,  the  construction  of  the  Act  announced  by  the  Commis-\nsion  in  this case  is  not  only  without  foundation  in  the  statute \n(pp.  24-31,  supra),  but  is  based  on  an  unsound  analysis,  is \ninconsistent with  prior  Commission  decisions,  and  is pernicious \nin  its  ramifications.  It should  be  rejected. \nD.  Cyanamid's  Attempt  to  Justify  the \nSterilization Policy  As  a  Means  of \nProtecting  Potential  Fetuses  Is  Not \nBefore  the  Court  for  Consideration \nAt  This  Time. \nWe  have  shown  that  the  Commission  erred  in  granting \nsummary  judgment  to  Cyanamid  and  in  vacating  the  citation at \nissue  here.  One  further  point  warrants  discussion. \nWe  recognize  that  Cyanamid  seeks  to defend  its sterili-\nzation  requirement  as  a  \"Fetus  Protection Policy.\"  The \nCommission  and  the  courts  have  held  that  in  some  cases  an \nemployer  can  defend  against  a  citation by  showing  that abate-\nment  of  the  cited hazard  would  result  in  a  greater  hazard. \nSee,  e.g.,  Russ  Kaller,  Inc.  (Surfa-Shield),  4  OSHC  1758  (R.C. \n1976);  Greyhound  Lines-West  v.  Marshall,  575  F.2d  759,  762 \n\n- 39  -\n(9th  Cir.  1978);  PBR,  Inc.  v.  Secretary  of  Labor,  643  F.2d  890, \n895  (1st  Cir.  1981).  It  is  unsettled whether  the  burden  of \nproof  on  that  issue  in  a  general  duty clause case  rests  with \n92 \nthe  Secretary  or  the  employer. Nor  do  we  know  of  any  case \nthat addresses  the  question whether  an  employer-created  hazard \nto  employees  can  ever  be  justified under  the  Act  by  a  showing \nthat  the  challenged  practice  reduces  a  potential hazard  to \nfetuses.  The  critical point  to  be  made,  however,  is  that  it  is \nnot  necessary  to  address  those  thorny  issues  here,  because  they \nare  not  presented  at  this  stage  in  the  litigation. \n92  In  Royal  Logging  Co.,  7  OSHC  1744,  1751  (1979),  the \nCommission  stated: \n[E]vidence  concerning  hazards  created  by  a \nproposed  abatement method  in  a  case  arising \nunder  [the  general  duty clause]  ••• is \nrelevant  in determining  feasibility  [of \nabatement]  but  is properly  part of  [the \nemployer's]  case  in  rebuttal.  That  is,  [the \nSecretary]  need  only  prove  that an  abatement \nmethod  exists  that would  provide  protection \nagainst  the  cited  hazard.  The  burden  then \nshifts  to  the  employer  to  produce  evidence \nshowing  or  tending  to  show  that use  of  the \nmethod  or  methods  established  by  [the \nSecretary]  will cause  consequences  so  adverse \nas  to  render  their  use  infeasible. \nOn  appeal  the  Ninth  Circuit,  while  stating  that  it agreed  with \nthe  Commission's  approach,  described  the  burden  of  proof  in \ndifferent  terms:  \"the  Secretary  bears  the  burden  of  showing \nthat  the  proposed  safety measure  will  not  result  in  a  greater \nhazard  as  part of  his  obligation  to  demonstrate  feasibility.\" \nDonovan  v.  Royal  Logging  Co.,  645  F.2d  822,  830  (9th  Cir. \n1981).  Although  we  believe  that  the  burden  of  proof  with \nrespect  to  such  issues  should  lie with  the  employer,  we  do  not \naddress  that  issue  here,  nor  do  we  address  the  question  whether \nthe  Commission  and/or  the  Ninth  Circuit  properly  conceptualized \nthe  role  that proof  of  a  \"greater  hazard\"  should  play  in  a  case \nunder  the  general  duty  clause;  for,  as  we  explain  in  the  text, \nsuch  issues  are  not  presented  for  review  in  this case. \n\n- 40  -\nAlthough  the  Company  argued  to  the  ALJ  that  its policy \nshould  be  upheld  on  the  merits  as  \"an  appropriate  method  of \npreventing  exposure  to  a  recognized  hazard  [to  fetuses]  in  the \nworkplace,\"93  neither  the  ALJ  nor  the  Commission  ruled  on  the \nquestion  whether  the  policy's  alleged  protection  of  fetuses \nwould  render  the  policy  lawful  if  it otherwise  fell  within  the \nsanctions  of  the  Act.  Instead,  the  ALJ  and  the  Commission  held \nas  a  threshold  proposition  that  the  policy was  not  cognizable \nas  a  violation  of  the  Act  irrespective  of  its purpose  or  its \neffect on  the  protection of  fetuses. \nWhat  is more,  the  issues  relating  to  the  \"appropriateness\" \nof  Cyanamid's  policy  are  not  ripe  for  resolution  in  any  event, \nbecause  the  pertinent  facts  are  in dispute.  For  example,  OCAW \nand  the  Secretary  have  strongly  maintained  that  in  adopting  the \nsterilization policy  \"Cyanamid  chose  the  easy  way  out\"  of \ndealing  with  any  potential  harm  to  fetuses  that might  result \n94 \nfrom  exposure  to  lead. Specifically,  OCAW  and  the  Secre-\ntary  have  maintained  that  in  no  circumstances  should  the \nCompany  have  required  employees  to  undergo  surgical  steriliza-\ntion,  because  any  risk  to  potential  fetuses  could  have  been  ade-\nquately  reduced  by  a  number  of  other  control  techniques,  such \n93  Respondent's  Motion  For  Summary  Judgment,  p.  13. \n94  See  Tr.  81  (JA  229)  (statement  of  OCAW  representative \nSteven Wodka).  With  respect  to  the  Company's  failure  to \nexplore  alternatives  other  than  its sterilization  requirement, \nsee  also  pp.  9-10,  supra. \n\n- 41  -\n9\nas  reducing  the  concentrations  of  lead  in  the  workplace 5  and \nimplementing  medical  surveillance  and  training  programs96. \nIf  the  Company  wishes  to  dispute  these  contentions,  it will \nhave  to  do  so  at  an  evidentiary  hearing;  the  present  state of \nthe  record  certainly does  not  provide  a  basis  for  resolving \n97 \nsuch  matters  in  the  Company's  favor.\n95  In  the  preamble  to  the  1978  Lead  Standard,  OSHA  had  this  to \nsay  with  respect  to  industry  arguments  that  exclusion  of  fertile \nwomen  is  the  only way  to  protect fetal  health where  lead  is \npresent  in  the  workplace: \nThe  lead  industry  •  •  •  did  not  believe  a \nstandard  could  or  should  be  promulgated  which \nwould  protect  the  fetus.  The  [industry] \ndisregards,  however,  the  role  that  the \nstandard's  special protective measures  can  play \nin  protecting  reproductive  capacity consistent \nwith  continued  employment  of  all people.  The \nimpact  of  the  typical  industry  approach  would \nultimately  lead  to  the  exclusion of  women  of \nage  from  the  workplace. \nchi~dbearing \nOSHA  disagrees  with  the  [industry]  con \nclusions  and  believes  that  the  final  standard \ncan  protect  reproductive  capacity of  the \nparent,  which  in  turn  will protect  the  fetus. \nThe  agency  has  endeavored  to  set a  compre \nhensive  standard  which  will maximize  protection \nto  the  male  and  female  worker,  to  the  fetus  and \nto  the  offspring  of  workers.  OSHA  recognizes \nthat  not  all  risk  can  be  entirely eliminated \ngiven  the  constraints  of  feasibility,  but  the \nfinal  standard  does  effectively minimize \nreproductive  risks.  With  this  in  mind,  OSHA \nasserts  that  an  employer  who  fully  complies \nwith  this  standard  has  no  rational  basis  for \nthe  exclusion  of  women  of  childbearing  age  from \nthe  workplace.  [43  Fed.  Reg.  54424  (Nov.  21, \n1978);  see  also  id.  at  52966.] \n96  See,  e.g.,  JA  192,  194-195,  202-207,  221,  226-229. \n97  The  justification asserted  by  Cyanamid  for  its policy  is \nfurther  clouded  by  the  fact  that  OSHA  has  found  that  exposure  of \nmales  to  certain  levels  of  lead  can  affect  the  sperm  in  such  a \nway  as  to  cause  harm  to  the  fetus.  See  43  Fed.  Reg. \n52959-529~0 \n(Nov.  14,  1978).  Yet  Cyanamid's  sterilization policy  only \napplies  to  women. \n\n- 42  -\nWe  are bard-pressed  to  comprehend  bow  the  facts  in  this \ncase  could  ever  support  a  conclusion  that Cyanamid's  st~rili-\nzation policy  is  statutorily protected because  of  its alleged \nbenefits  to potential  fetuses.  At  the  very'least,  however,  the \nrecord  does  not  permit  the  factual  findings  upon  which  any  such \nconclusion  could  possibly  be  based. \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  reasons  set  forth  above,  the petition  for  review \nshould  be  granted,  the  Commissioh'~ order  should be  set aside, \nand  the  case  should  be  remanded  for  further  proceedings. \nRespectfully  submitted, \ng. r;L \n~ \n(-p,. ) \nGEORGE  H.

Introduction \nThis  case  involves  a  petition  for  review  of  a  decision \nby  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Review  Commission  (\"OSHRC\" \nor  the  \"Review  Commission\")  dismissing  a  citation  issued  by  the \nSecretary of Labor  (the  \"Secretary\")  to  respondent American \nCyanamid  Company  (\"American  Cyanamid\"  or  the  \"Company\").  The \npetition  for  review  is  not  brought  by  the  Secretary,  who  has  not \nchallenged  the  Review  Commission's  decision,  but  rather  by  an \nintervenor  in  the  proceedings  before  the  Review  Commission,  peti-\ntioners  Oil,  Chemical  and  Atomic  Workers  International  Union  and \n\n.!/ \nits Local  3-499,  Oil,  Chemical  and  Atomic  Worker s  ( \"OCAW\") . \nThe  citation  is  facially  ambiguous.  The  Secr etary' s \nstatements  in  the  proceedings  below,  however,  clarified  that  the \ncitation should  be  construed  to  charge  that American  Cyanamid  vio-\nlated  the  general  duty  clause  of  the  Occupational  Safety  and \nHealth Act  of  1970  (the  \"OSH  Act\"  or  the  \"Act\")  by  maintaining  a \npolicy  of  excluding  women  employees  of  childbearing  capacity  from \njobs  where  they would  be  exposed  to  lead  at  levels  harmful  to  the \nfetus,  which  policy  allegedly might  have  led  potential women \nemployees  to  decide  to  have  themselves  medically  sterilized  so  as \nto  become  eligible  for  these  jobs.  The  Administrative  Law  Judge \n( \"ALJ\")  vacated  the  citation upon  the  Company ' s  motion  for  summary \njudgment  and  the  Review  Commission  affirmed,  on  the  ground  that \nthe  citation  failed  to  allege  a  violation  cognizable  under  the \nAct.  OCAW,  but  not  the  Secretary,  chose  to  petition  for  review  of \nthe  Review  Commission's  decision. \nB.  The  Citation \nOn  October  9,  1979  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health \nAdministration  (\"OSHA\")  issued  to American  Cyanamid  the  citation \nwhich  is  the  subject  of  this  case.  JA  1.  It alleged  that  the \nCompany  had  violated  section  S(a}(l)  of  the  Act  (i .e. ,  the  general \nduty  clause,  29  u.s.c.  §  654(a)(l))  during  an  OSHA  inspection  of \n~/  This  Court  dismissed  American  Cyanamid ' s  objection  that OCAW \nis  not  a  proper  party  to  petition  for  review  of  the  Review \nCommission's  order.

Specifically,  the \ncitation provided: \nThe  violations  described  in  this  citation are \nalleged  to have  occurred  on  or  about  the  day \nthe  inspection was  made  unless  otherwise  indi \ncated within  the  description  given  below. \nSection  5(a) (1)  of  the  Occupational  Safety and \nHealth  Act  of  1970:  The  employer  did  not  fur \nnish  employment  and  a  place  of  employment \nwhich  were  free  from  recognized  hazards  that \nwere  causing  or were  likely to  cause  death  or \nserious  physical  harm  to  employees,  in  that: \nThe  employer  adopted  and  implemented  a  policy \nwhich  required  women  employees  to be  steri \nlized  in order  to be  eligible  to work  in  those \nareas  of  the  plant where  they  would  be  exposed \nto  certain  toxic  substances: \n(a)  Inorganic  Pigment  Department  -- Buildings \nNo.  85  and  No.  86 \nThe  alleged  violation was  to be  corrected  \"immediately\".  It was \nclassified  as  \"willful''  and  a  penalty  of  $10,000  was  proposed. \nThe  citation also  indicated  that  the  inspection  date  was  \"1/4  -\n4/13/79\",  and  that  the  date  of  issuance  of  the  citation was \n\"10/9/79\". \nSection  9(c)  of  the  Act  establishes  a  six-month  statute \nof  limitations  for  violation  of  the  Act.~/  Thus,  the  period \n~/  Section  9(c),  29  u.s.c.  §  658(c),  provides:  \"No  citation may \nbe  issued  under  this  section  after  the  expiration of  six \nmonths  following  the  occurrence  of  any  violation.\"  OSHA's \nregulations  contain  a  parallel  provision.  See  29  C.F.R.  § \n1903.14(a).  The  legislative history of  section  9(c)  demon \nstrates  that  the  provision  is  a  statute  of  limitations  and \nthat  citations  for  alleged  violations  that  occurred  more  than \nsix  months  before  issuance  of  the  citation  are  barred.  See \nConf.  Rep.  No.  91-1765,  9lst Cong.,  2d  Sess.  38  (1970), \nreprinted  in  1970  U.S.  Code  Cong.  & Ad.  News  5228,  5234.  The \ncourts  of  appeals  have  regarded  section  9(c)  as  an  absolute \nbar with  respect  to  violations  occurring  more  than  six  months \nprior  to  issuance  of  the  citation.  See,  e.g.,  Bloomfield \nMechanical  Contracting,  Inc.  v.  OSHR~51~2d 1257,  1261-62 \n(Footnote  continued) \n- 3  -\n\ncovered  by  the  citation  includes  only  the  five-day  period  from \nApril  9,  1979  (the  first  day  of  the  six-month  period  prior to  the \ndate  the  citation  issued)  through  April  13,  1979  (the  last day  of \nthe  OSHA  inspection during which  the  alleged  violation  is  said  to \nhave  occurred).  This  circumstance  is  important  for  an  under-\nstanding  that all material  facts  pertaining  to  the  citation con-\ncern  this  five-day  period  and  not  any  period  prior  thereto.  In \ntheir briefs OCAW  and  amicus  curiae  the  Coalition  for  the \nReproductive  Rights  of Workers  (\"CRROW\")  allege  various  unsubstan-\ntiated  facts  concerning  actions  that  occurred  in  late 1977  and \nearly  1978,  more  than  a  year  before  the  period  covered  by  the \ncitation.  While  American  Cyanamid  vigorously  disputes  the  facts \nalleged by  OCAW  and  CRROW,  those  disputes  need  not  be  resolved \nbecause  those  issues  of  fact  are  not  material  to  this  case,  which \nnecessarily  concerns  only  the  allegations  of  the  citation. \nThe  citation  refers  to but mischaracterizes  American \nCyanamid's  Fetus  Protection  Policy.  This  employment  policy was \nadopted  in  1977  and  implemented  in  1978.l/  It precluded women \n(Footnote  continued  from  previous  page) \n(3d  Cir.  1975)~  Brennan  v.

Statement  of  Facts  and  Circumstances8/ \n1.  The  Fetus  Protection  Policy \nThe  Court  may  take  judicial  notice  that  during  the \n1970's,  American  women  entered  the  industrial workforce  in  large \nnumbers  for  the  first  time,  other  than  temporarily  during  World \nWar  II.  This  influx  of women  presented  a  novel  occupational \nhealth  issue:  the  potential  presence  of  a  fetus  in  a  workplace \nwhere  it may  be  seriously harmed  by  the  mother's  exposure  to  toxic \nmaterials.  The  risk  of harm  to  the  fetus  was  substantial,  since \nit is well-established  that  a  fetus  is  far  more  sensitive  to many \ntoxic  materials  than  is an  adult. \nAmerican  Cyanamid  adopted  and  implemented  an  exclusion \nary  employment  policy  to  address  this  risk of harm  to  the  fetus,~/ \n~/  American  Cyanamid  offers  this  statement  of  facts  and  circum \nstances  not  because  it believes  that  each  fact  is material; \non  the  contrary,  the  material  facts  are  few  and  undisputed. \nRather,  the  Company  offers  this  statement  to  provide  the \nCourt  with  background  so  that  it may  understand  how  this \nhighly  unusual  citation  came  to  be  issued,  what  this  case \nreally  concerns,  and  why  the  only material  facts  are \nundisputed.  Because  of  the  procedural  history of  this  case, \nnot  all  of  the  facts  were  developed  in  detail  in  the  pro \nceedings  before  the  Review  Commission. \n~/  Employers  are morally  obligated  to protect  unborn  children \npotentially  in  their workplaces.  In  addition,  employers  are \narguably  required  to  protect  the  fetus  under  the  general  duty \nclause  of  the  Act,  section  S(a)(l),  29  U.S.C.  §  654(a)(l), \nwhich  provides  that  each  employer  shall \nfurnish  to  each  of his  employees  employment  and  a  place \nof  employment  which  are  free  from  recognized  hazards \nthat  are  causing  or  are  likely to  cause  death  or  serious \nphysical harm  to  his  employees. \nThis  Court has  indicated  that  the  protections  of  the  Act \nextend  to  a  fetus  carried  by  an  employee: \nWe  find  OSHA's  contention  that  it has  statutory author-\n(Footnote  continued) \n- 6  -\n\n.. - ·--··-··-------~---\nas  did  a  number  of other  employers.1-0-/  As  indicated  above,  during \nthe  period  covered  by  the  citation,  at the Willow  Island  plant  the \nCompany's  Fetus  Protection  Policy  applied  only  to  lead.!!/ \nAmerican  Cyanamid's  concern  with  the  fetal  effects  of \nlead was  well-founded,  as  the  record  in  this  proceeding  shows.~/ \nAmong  other  things,  the  preamble  to  the  lead  standard,  43  Fed. \n(Footnote  continued  from  previous  page) \nity to  protect  the  fetuses  of  lead  exposed  working \nmothers  to be  unassailable.

Reg.  at  54389.  OSHA  conceded  that \nthe  Lancranjan  study  ''engendered  much  criticism during  the  lead \nhearings.\"  Id.  at 54392.  At  most  the  study  suggests  that  at \nblood  lead  levels  significantly above  those  at which  fetal  effects \ncan  occur,  male  fertility may  be  temporarily  reduced.  (Dr. \nLancranjan  speculated  in her  testimony  at the  lead  standard hear-\nings  that birth defects  could  occur  from  malformed  sperm,  but pro-\nvided  no  support  for  this hypothesis.)  This  suspected  temporary \nreduced  fertility  in men  is  clearly  far  less  serious  than,  and \ndifferent  from,  the  severe  permanent  effects  low  levels  of  expo-\nsure  to  lead  can  cause  in  the  fetus. \n4The  Secretary has  also  stipulated~/ to  the  accuracy  of \nthe  statements  on  the  fetal  effects  of  lead  made  by  his  own  expert \n14/  See  43  Fed.

OSHA  estimated  that  a  long \nterm  lead  worker  would  on  average  excrete  lead  at  a  rate  of  3 \nug/lOOg  per month,  assuming  that  the  employee  received  abso \nlutely  no  additional  occupational  exposure  to  lead. \nIndividual  rates  of  excretion  could  be  much  slower,  and  OSHA \nrecognized  that  some  employees  would  require  18  months  or \nmore  to  reduce  their blood  lead  levels  to  40  ug/lOOg,  which \nis  still 10  ug/lOOg  greater  than  the  maximum  level  acceptable \nfor  a  fetus.  This  means  that  a  woman  employee  occupationally \nexposed  to  lead  might  have  a  blood  lead  level  substantially \nabove  30  ug/lOOg  during  her  entire pregnancy,  even  if she \nreceived  no  additional  lead  exposure  after  she  realized  she \nwas  pregnant. \nSee  Tr.  97,  JA  245;  Request  for  Admissions  at 4-8  and \n~I \nAttachments  3-5,  JA  43-47,  57-77. \n- 9  -\n\nwitness,  Dr.  Edward  L.

For  example,  reducing \nambient  air  lead  levels  to  the  point where  employee  blood  lead \nlevels  would  not  exceed  30  ug/lOOg  was  infeasible.~/  Respirator \n16/  OSHRC  Docket  No.  78-2438,  which  arose  out  of  the  same  inspec \ntion as  did  this  proceeding,  was  concerned  with  the  Company's \ncompliance  at the  Inorganic  Pigments  Department  with  the \n\"old\"  lead  standard  and  certain  other OSHA  requirements.

American  Cyanamid  Co.,  supra.  The  lea~ standard \npreamble  predicted  that  air  lead  levels  of  200  ug/m  would \nresult  in  83.8  percent  of blood  lead  levels  above  40  ug/lOOg \nat  any  one  time.  43  Fed.

Even  an  ambient  air  lead  level  of  50  ug/m3 \nwould  lead  to  an  expected  29.3  percent  of blood  lead  levels \nabove  40  ug/lOOg  at  any  one  time,  i.e.,  at  least  10  ug/lOOg \nabove  the  30  ug/lOOg  maximum  level-considered  acceptable  by \n(Footnote  continued) \n- 10  -\n\nusage  to  reduce  employee  blood  lead  levels  to  30  ug/lOOg  would \nhave  been,  in  OSHA's  words,  \"ineffective,  unreliable  and \nunsafe.\"19/  A  sophisticated  medical  surveillance  program  would \n(Footnote  continued  from  previous  page) \nOSHA  for  the  fetus.  Id.  In  Steelworkers  this  Court  found \nthat OSHA  had  failed  to  es3ablish  that  reduction  of  ambient \nair  lead  levels  to  50  ug/m  was  technologically  feasible  for \nthe  lead  pigment  manufacturing  industry~  the  Court  did  not \neven  reach  the  question  of  economic  feasibility. \nAfter  reopening  the  rulemaking  record  for  additional \ncomment,  OSHA  initially  concluded  in January  1981  that  it \nthen  had  evidence  that  it was  feasible  for  3he  lead  pigment \nmanufacturing  industry  to  achieve  a  50  ug/m  ambient  air  lead \nlevel  through  the  use  of  engineering  and  work  practice  con \ntrols.  46  Fed.  Reg.  6134,  6176-82  (January  21,  1981).  OSHA \nreached  this  initial  conclusion  despite  its  recognition  that \n[m]ost  plants  [in  the  industry]  are  old  and  retrofitting \nmay  not  be  effective  in  many  cases.  The  industry,  as  a \nwhole,  is  not  close  to  compliance  with  either  the  PEL  or \nthe  interim  level  in  most  operations  and  will  require \nmajor  renovation  in  p~ant and  equipment  to  achieve \neither  100  or  50  ug/m  • \nId.  at  6179  (emphasis  in  original).  OSHA's  primary  recom \nmendation  was  that  the  industry  demolish  existing  plants  and \nrebuild  from  scratch.  Id.  at  6182. \nUpon  further  reflection,  however,  OSHA  chose  to  retract \nits  finding  of  feasibility  for  the  lead  pigment  manufacturing \nindustry  and  certain  other  industries.  46  Fed.  Reg.  60758, \n60768  (December  11,  1981).  OSHA  took  this  action  because  it \nwas \nnot  satisfied  at  this  time  that  application  of  conven \ntional  control  technology  is  capable  of  reducing  lead \nexposures  in  these  industries  .  •  •  because  exposure \nlevels  are  particularly high,  ~, pigment \nmanufacture  •  •  [E]ach  industry may  face  signifi-\ncant  technological  or  economic  problems  in  achieving \ncompliance,  and  hence  most  of  these  industries  must \nexpend_far  larger  capital  sums  to  install  equipment \nwhich  may  not  reduce  exposures  to below  the  PEL. \nId.  at  60761. \n19/  In  the  lead  standard  preamble  OSHA  referred  to  respiratory \nprotection  as  \"an  ineffective,  unreliable,  and  unsafe  method \n(Footnote  continued) \n- 11  -\n\n20\nhave  protected  the  fetus. /  Regulating  exposure  to  lead  accord-\ning  to  the  family  planning  practices  of  individual  employees  would \nhave  been  an  unwarranted  invasion  of  the  legitimate privacy \n21/ \ninterests  of workers.--\nAnother  hypothetical  alternative,  allowing  each  employee \nof  childbearing  capacity  to  determine  whether  the  risk  to  the \n(Footnote  continued  from  previous  page) \nof  reducing  employee  exposure  .  •  •  which  depend[s]  upon  the \nvagaries  of human  behavior\",  and  noted  that  respirators  \"are \ngenerally  not  capable  of providing  the  protection  required, \nand  create  additional hazards  by  interfering with  vision, \nhearing,  and  mobility.\"  43  Fed.

(The  parties  have  stipulated  to what  the  blood  lead \nlevels  were  for  employees  in  the  Inorganic  Pigments \nDepartment.

It is  undisputed  that  these \nlevels  generally  exceeded  30  ug/lOOg.) \n20/  In  the  lead  standard  preamble  OSHA  criticized medical  sur \nveillance  as  a  basis  for  regulating  exposure  to  lead.  43 \nFed.

OSHRC,  501  F.2d  504,  515  (8th  Cir.  1974). \n~/  As  OSHA  stated  in  its  attachment  to  the  lead  standard  pream \nble: \nHealth  in  general  is  an  intensely personal  matter,  and \nthis  is particularly  true with  respect  to  lead  medical \nsurveillance  due  to  the  adverse  effects  of  lead  on  male \nand/ female  reproduction.  Absent  some  compelling  justi \nfication,  OSHA  is  extremely hesitant to mandate  detailed \ninquiries  into  the  most  private  aspects  of  the  lives  of \nAmerican  workers. \n43  Fed.  Reg.  at  54450-51.  In  addition,  the  Court  may  take \njudicial  notice  that  family  planning  practices  are  not  always \neffective  and  do  sometimes  fail  to  prevent  unplanned \npregnancies. \n- 12  -\n\nfetus  she  potentially carried  required  her  voluntary  exclusion \nfrom  the  Inorganic  Pigments  Department,  would  have  been  inef \nfective  a~d unreliable. 22/  It could  also  arguably have  been  con-\ntrary  to  the  Act.  The  key  point  of  the  Act,  and  the  general  duty \nclause  in  particular,  is  that  it places  responsibility  for  ensur-\ning  employee  safety and  health  on  the  employer,  not  the \nemployee. 23/  This  responsibility  cannot  be  discharged  through \noperation  of  the  assumption  of  risk  doctrine.  American  Cyanamid \ncould  still arguably have  been  legally as  well  as  morally  respon-\nsible  for  permitting  exposure  of  a  fetus  to  the  recognized  hazard \nof  lead  at  levels  likely to  cause  serious  physical  harm  even  if \nthe  potential  mother  had  chosen  to work  in  the  Inorganic  Pigments \n24\nDepartment. / \n22/  As  shown  in  note  14,  supra,  a  woman  employee  who  chose  to \nremain  in  the  Inorganic  Pigments  Department  until  she  real \nized  she  was  pregnant  and  then  chose  removal  could  well  have \nblood  lead  levels  substantially  above  the  maximum  30  ug/lOOg \nlevel  considered  acceptable  for  the  fetus  during  her  entire \npregnancy. \n23/  OSHA  asserted  in  the  lead  the  lead  preamble  that  \"[t]he  OSH \nAct  places  the  primary  burden  of  compliance  on  the  employer, \nand  to  shift  it to  the  employee  •.• is  ••• inappropriate \nand  is  contrary  to  established  OSHA  policy.\"  43  Fed.

After  acknowledging  that  even  a \nPEL  of  50  ug/m  would  not  protect  the  fetus,  OSHA  suggested \nthat  there may  be  a  need  to  \"remove  workers  who  may  wish  to \nplan  pregnancies  or who  are  pregnant\"  under  the  medical \nremoval  protection  (\"MRP\")  provision,  29  C.F.R. \n§  1910.1025(k).  43  Fed.  Reg.  at  52966,  JA  335.  With  respect \nto  a  pregnant  employee  OSHA  stated: \n[I]n many  cases  it would  be  unacceptable  for  a \npregnant  employee  having  an  elevated blood \nlead  level  to  continue  to  experience  substan \ntial  lead  exposure  during  the  pregnancy \n[P]hysical  removal  of  the  [pregnant] \nemployee  from  all  significant  lead  exposure \nmight  be  imperative  . \n43  Fed.

The  MRP  provision  differs most  sig \nnificantly  from  the  Fetus  Protection  Policy  in  the  economic \nconsiderations  involved with  a  removal. \n- 14  -\n\nIn  November  1977,  prior  to  implementing  the  Fetus \nProtection  Policy  at  the  Willow  Island  plant,  Company  IDfficials \ndiscussed  the  policy with  officials  of OSHA  and  the  National \nInstitute  for  Occupational  Safety and  Health  (\"NIOSH\"),  who  made \nno  statement  to  the  effect  that  the  Company  should  not  implement \n.  .  27 I \n.1ts  po 1:Ley.-\nIn  January  and  February  1978  management  at  the  Willow \nIsland  plant met  with  representatives  of OCAW  and  with  all  female \nproduction workers  of  presumed  childbearing  capacity  to  discuss \nimplementation  of  the  Fetus  Protection  Policy.  Management  encour-\naged  female  production  employees  of  childbearing  potential working \nin  certain  Departments  to  request  transfers  to  other  Departments \nby  April  24,  1978.  These  women  were  told  that  if they  remained  in \nthe  prohibited  Departments  after May  1,  1978  they  would  be  removed \nfrom  those  Departments.  The  Company  extended  the  May  1,  1978  date \nseveral  times,  each  time  informing  an  OCAW  representative  and  the \naffected  female  production  employees  in  advance.  In  September \n1978  they were  informed  that  the  date  had  been  extended  to October \n2,  1978,  that  the  only  Department  affected was  the  Inorganic \nPigments  Department,  Buildings  85  and  86,  and  that  the  only mate \n28\nrial  covered  by  the  policy was  lead. / \nBetween  February  and  July  1978,  five  female  production \nworkers  then  employed  in  the  Inorganic  Pigments  Department  chose \n27/  See  Tr.  118,  JA  266:  Morgan  Letter  at  3-4,  JA  442-43:  Request \nfor  Admissions  at  22-23,  JA  50-51. \n28/  See  Morgan  Letter  at  5-10,  JA  444-49:  Request  for  Admissions \nat  23,  JA  51. \n- 15  -\n\nto  seek  voluntary medical  sterilization at a  hospital  not \nconnected  with  the  Company,  for  which  surgery  they  signed  consent \nforms,  allegedly  in  order  to  rebut  the  presumption  that  each  of \n29\nthem was  of  childbearing  capacity. / \nOn  October  2,  1978,  the  only  two  women  employees  then  of \nchildbearing  capacity  in  the  Inorganic  Pigments  Department  were \nreassigned  to  the  utility pool.  This  action  completed  the  imple-\nmentation  of  the  Fetus  Protection  Policy.  The  rates  of  pay  of  the \ntransferred women  were  continued  at their  former  levels  for  90 \ndays,  after which  time  the  pay  rates  became  those  of  the  jobs  they \nheld  or  transferred  into.

On  October  5,  1978  OCAW  filed  a \ngrievance  with  the  Company  under  the  collective bargaining  agree-\nment  asking  only  that  these  two  employees  be  restored  to  their \nformer  job  classifications  and  rates  of  pay,  and  otherwise  be  made \nwhole.

On  December  27,  1978,  OCAW  filed with  OSHA  a  discrimina \ntion complaint  under  section  ll(c)  of  the Act,  29  u.s.c.  §  660(c), \nalleging  that women  employees  were  forced  to  undergo  sterilization \nto work  in  the  Inorganic  Pigments  Department,  and  a  separate  com \nplaint alleging  that the  presence  of  toxic  materials  at the  Willow \nIsland plant presented  an  imminent  danger  to  the health  of \nemployees.  OSHA  later dismissed  OCAW's  ll(c)  complaint. \nThe  foregoing  strongly  suggests  that OCAW's  motivation \nin  requesting  an  OSHA  inspection was  to  strengthen  its  collective \nbargaining  position with  respect  to  the  labor-management  issues  of \nmandatory  transfers,  possible wage  rate  reductions,  and  possible \nlayoffs.  Thus,  this  case  involves  essentially labor-management \nissues,  not  occupational  safety  and  health  issues. \nOSHA  conducted  a  full  inspection  of  the  Willow  Island \nplant  from  January  4  through April  13,  1979.  JA  1.  As  a  result \nof  this  inspection,  OSHA  issued  a  series  of  citations  to  the \nCompany  alleging  various  violations  of  specific  standards,  includ \ning  the  \"old\"  lead  standard,  and  of  the  general  duty  clause. \nThese  citations were  the  subject  of OSHRC  Docket  Nos.  79-1936, \n79-2438,  and  79-4876.  None  of  these  citations  addressed  the \nCompany's  Fetus  Protection  Policy.  Not  until  October  9,  1979,  did \nOSHA  issue  the  vaguely-worded  citation  in  this  case,  OSHRC  Docket \nNo.  79-5762. \nAs  noted  earlier,  the  issues  in OSHRC  Docket  No. \n79-2438  concerned  exposure  of  employees  to  lead  in  the  Inorganic \n- 17  -\n\nPigments  Department.  Every  aspect  of  the  Company's  compliance \nwith  OSHA's  standards  relating  to  lead  was  thoroughly  explored  in \n.  31/ \nt h e  proceed  1ng.-- The  Company  has  substantially prevailed  before \nthe ALJ  in  that  case.  See  American  Cyanamid  Co.,  supra,  1980 \nO.S.H.  Dec.  (CCH)  ~  24,828  (1980);. \nIn  January  1980,  three  months  after OSHA  issued  the \ncitation which  is  the  subject  of  this  proceeding,  the  Company  per-\nmanently  closed  its  lead  pigment  manufacturing  operation  at  the \nWillow  Island  plant.  See  note  25  supra. \nIn  summary,  during  the  period  covered  by  the  citation, \nAmerican  Cyanamid  maintained  its Fetus  Protection  Policy  at  the \nWillow  Island  plant  in  order  to preclude  fetal  exposure  to  the \nrecognized  hazard  of  lead.  Alternative means  of protecting  the \nfetus,  such  as  those  suggested  by  OCAW,  would  have  been  infeasi-\nble,  ineffective,  or  achievable  only by  shutting  down  the \nInorganic  Pigments  Department  at  the  cost  of  jobs.  The  Company \nchose  the  responsible  course,  excluding women  of  childbearing \ncapacity. \n2.  Material  facts  here \nWhile  the  foregoing  recitation was  provided  to  assist \nthe  Court  in  understanding  the  background  of  the  citation  in  this \ncase,  the  material  facts  are  few.  Before  examining  them,  however, \nthe  Court may  find  it helpful  to  review what  is not  material. \n~/  The  prehearing  discovery  involved  thousands  of pages  of \ninterrogatory answers  and  documents.  The  evidentiary hearing \ntook  eight days  in December  1979  and  March  1980.  Twenty-two \nwitnesses  appeared,  and  129  exhibits were  admitted  into  evi \ndence.  The  transcript  totalled  1,587  pages. \n- 18  -\n\nBy  virtue  of  its  terms  and  the  operation  of  section 9(c) \nof  the  Act,  the  citation  concerns  only  a  five-day  period  in April \n1979,  six  months  before  the  citation was  issued.  By  that  time \nmore  than  a  year  had  passed  since  the  Company  had  adopted  the \nFetus  Protection  Policy.  More  than  a  year  had  also passed  since \nthe  meetings  in  January  and  February  1978  of  Company  representa \ntives  with  the  women  employees  about  which  OCAW  and  CRROW  assert \nthe  need  for  discovery.  The  sterilizations  occurred between \nFebruary  and  July,  1978,  some  nine  to  fourteen  months  prior  to  the \nperiod  covered  by  the  citation,  and  fourteen  to  twenty  months \nbefore  the  citation was  issued.  The  transfer  of  two  women \nemployees  out  of  the  Inorganic  Pigments  Department  occurred  in \nOctober  1978,  six  months  prior  to  the  period  covered  by  the  cita \ntion,  and  twelve  months  before  the  citation was  issued.  It is \nundisputed  that during  the  period  covered  by  the  citation the \nFetus  Protection  Policy  applied  at the Willow  Island  plant only  to \nlead,  and  no  woman  of  childbearing  capacity held  a  production  job \nin  the  only  area  of  the  plant  then  affected  by  the  policy,  the \nInorganic  Pigments  Department.  Thus,  all  occurrences  before  April \n1979  and  all  substances  other  than  lead  are  immaterial  to  this \nproceeding,  as  the ALJ  found.  Tr.  107,  119-21,  142-43  (JA  255, \n267-69,  290-91). \nAlso  immaterial  is whether  American  Cyanamid  could have \nadequately  protected  the  fetus  through  alternatives  to  excluding \nwomen  production workers  of  childbearing  capacity,  such  as  by \nreducing  ambient  air  lead  levels  through  engineering  and  adminis \ntrative  controls  and  a  more  effective  respiratory  protection \n- 19  -\n\nprogram.  Those  allegations  were  the  subject of OSHRC  Docket  No. \n79-2438.  Tr.  18-19,  46-47,  51-53,  79  (JA  166-67,  194-95,  199-201, \n227).  Similarly,  allegations  that  lead  adversely  affects  the \nreproductive  capacity of men  are  also  immaterial  to  this  pro-\nceeding  as  the  ALJ  found,  Tr.  139-40,  JA  287-88.  OSHRC  Docket  No. \n79-2438  was  concerned,  inter alia,  with  the harmful  effects  of \nlead  on  adult  employees. \nThus,  most  broadly  construed,  the  citation alleges  no \nmore  than  that  in April  1979  the  Company  maintained  a  policy at \nthe  Willow  Island  plant  of  excluding women  employees  of  childbear-\ning  capacity  from  production  jobs  involving  exposure  to  lead  at \nlevels harmful  to  a  fetus,  and  that women  might  choose  to  ask  phy-\nsicians  to  sterilize  them  so  that  they would .be  eligible  to bid \ninto or be  assigned  to  the  Inorganic  Pigments  Department.~/  As \nto  these  facts  there  is  no  dispute. \nIdentification of  the  material  facts  in  this  case  makes \nclear  that  this  case  presents  legal  issues  only,  and  was  therefore \nproperly  disposed  of by  the  ALJ  and  the  Review  Commission  on \n~/  While  the  sterilizations  that  occurred  in  1978  are  immaterial \nhere,  they  do  show  that  the  so-called  sterilization require \nment  alleged  by  the  citation did  not  involve  the  presence  of \nsterilizing  chemical  agents  in  the workplace,  but  rather  the \nchance  that women  affected  by  the  Fetus  Protection  Policy \nmight  choose  to have  themselves  medically  sterilized  in  a \nhospital  for  social  and  economic  reasons  (including \neligibility for  a  production  job  in  the  Inorganic  Pigments \nDepartment).  The  Secretary has  conceded  that  the  steriliza \ntions  that occurred  in  1978  were  not  physically  coerced  by \nthe  Company,  Tr.  16,  67-68  (JA  164,  215-16),  that  they  were \nperformed  in  a  hospital,  id.,  and  that  they were  performed \nwith  the  consent  of  the  employees  involved.

The  key  legal  issue before  the  Court  is whether \nthe  citation alleges  a  \"hazard\"  as  Congress  used  that  term  in \npassing  the Act. \nD.  Proceedings  Below \nIn  proceedings  before  the  ALJ,  the  Secretary  sought  mas-\nsive  discovery  concerning  details  of  the  development  and  imple-\nmentation  of  the  Fetus  Protection  Policy  in  1977  and  1978.  At  no \ntime  did  the  Secretary  seek  discovery  of  any  facts  alleged  to have \noccurred  after October  1978,  when  the  two  employees  were  trans-\nferred. \nIn  part  to  resolve  OSHA's  request  for  burdensome  dis-\ncovery  and  to  determine  what,  if any,  genuine  issues  of material \nfact  were  in  dispute,  the  ALJ  held  a  lengthy pre-hearing  confer-\nence  on  April  1,  1980.  This  conference  sufficiently clarified  the \nissues  so  that American  Cyanamid  was  able  to  file  a  motion  for \nsummary  judgment. \nThe  ALJ  granted  the  Company's  motion  on  two  grounds . \nFirst,  recognizing  that  the  citation's  terms  and  the  Secretary's \nallegations  and  discovery  requests  all  concerned  the  1977-78 \nperiod  during  which  the  Fetus  Protection  Policy was  developed  and \nimplemented,  the  ALJ  held  that  the  citation was  barred  by  the \nsix-month  statute of  limitations  set  forth  in  section 9(c)  of  the \nAct.  ALJ  decision  at 8,  JA  460.  Second,  the  ALJ  found  that  the \ncitation does  not  allege  a  violation  cognizable  under  the  Act: \nIf Respondent's  Fetus  Protection  Policy \ncan  legally be  held  accountable  for  \"requir \ning\"  female  sterilization as  a  \"condition  of \nemployment\"  in  its  Pigment  Department,  two \nother  laws  speak  to  such  an  issue,  the \n- 21  -\n\nNational  Labor  Relations  Act  (NLRA)  as  an \nalleged  unfair  labor-practice  and/or  Title VII \nof  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  42  U.S.C. \n2000e  et seq.,  as  an  alleged  impermissible \n\"sex  base~discrimination issue. \nALJ  decision  at 9,  JA  461  (emphasis  in  original,  footnotes \nomitted).  This  conclusion  is  consistent with  the  ALJ's  statements \nduring  the  pre-hearing  conference: \n\"The  thing[  ]  that ' s  hit my  eye  about  this whole \ncase,  I  think  we're  under  the wrong  law here.  I \nreally do.  I  don't  see  where  Congress  had  any \nthought  whatever  in  passing  the  OSHA  Act  in  treat \ning  the  female  as  opposed  to  the  male  segment  of \nthe working  force. \n\"They  were  talking  about  employees  across  the \nboard.  Now,  if the  Secretary  can  make  out  a  dis \ncrimination  case,  he's  not  going  to make  it out \nunder  the  OSHA  Act.  There's  a  law  that  covers \nthis,  and  it's not  the  Occupational  Safety and \nHealth Act.\"  Tr.  47-48,  JA  195-96. \n\"Now  again,  it would  seem  to me  that we  are  oper \nating  under  the  wrong  law  here.  There  is  the \nNational  Labor  Relations  Act  and  other  labor  laws \nto prevent  employers  from  engaging  in  unfair  labor \npractices.  This  is perhaps  a  matter  of  collective \nbargaining.\"  Tr.  61,  JA  209. \n\"And  your  view  is  that  the  recognized  hazard  is  a \nsterilization.  And  you  have  got  a  really dif \nficult burden,  Mr.  Berger  [counsel  for  the \nSecretary].  Because  I  have  seen  nothing  in  the \nlaw,  in  the  legislative history or  of  any  case \ndecided  under  section  SAl,  that  could  be  convo \nluted  to  include  sterilization under  the  situation \nthat we  face  here  as  a  recognized  hazard.  No \nway.\"  Tr.  76,  JA  224. \nSee  also Tr.  2,  14-15,  49,  87-89,  119-120,  123,  130,  132-33, \n143-44,  149-50  (JA  150,  162-63,  197,  235-37,  267-68,  271,  278, \n280-81).  The  ALJ  ultimately  relied  on  section  4(b) (1)  of  the  Act, \n29  u.s.c.  §  653(b) (1),  finding  that  either  the  EEOC  or  the \nNational  Labor  Relations  Board  (\"NLRB\"),  or both,  have  exercised \nstatutory authority governing  the hazard  alleged  in  the  citation. \n22 \n\nALJ  decision  at  11,  JA  463.  His  remarks  during  the  pre-hearing \nconference  show,  however,  that he  believed  that  the  citation \nfailed  to  allege  a  violation  arising  under  the  Act,  although  the \ncitations may  allege  a  violation  cognizable  under  either  the \nNational  Labor  Relations  Act  (\"NLRA\")  or Title VII  of  the  Civil \nRights  Act  of  1964  (\"Title  VII\"). \nThe  Review  Commission  directed  the ALJ's  decision  for \nreview  and  affirmed  per  curiam.  In  doing  so  the  Review  Commission \nfollowed  the  reasoning  of  the ALJ's  second  ground  for  decision, \nwithout  reaching  the  issue  of whether  either  section  4(b)(l)  or \nsection  9(c)  also  required  dismissal  of  the  citation.  Commission \ndecision  at  1601  n.27,  JA  509.  The  Review  Commission  considered \nsufficient  for  dismissal  the  failure  of the  citation to  allege  a \nviolation  cognizable  under  the  Act.  In  particular,  the  Review \nCommission  found  as  a  matter  of  law  that  the  hazard  alleged  by  the \nSecretary--the  circumstance  that  because  of  the  stated  policy an \nemployee  might  decide  \"to  undergo  sterilization  in order  to  gain \nor  retain  employment\"--was  in  no  way  comparable  to  the  kind  of \nhazard  to which  Congress  referred  in  the  Act.  Commission  decision \nat  1600,  JA  508.  The  Review  Commission  concluded: \n[I]t is  clear  that  Congress  conceived  of occu \npational  hazards  in  terms  of  processes  and \nmaterials  which  cause  injury or  disease  by \noperating  directly  upon  employees  as  they \nengage  in work  or  work-related  activities. \nThe  fetus  protection  policy  is  of  a  dif \nferent  character  altogether.  It is  neither  a \nwork  process  nor  a  work  material,  and  it mani \nfestly  cannot  alter  the  physical  integrity of \nemployees  while  they  are  engaged  in work  or \nwork-related  activities.  An  employee's  deci \nsion  to  undergo  sterilization  in  order  to  gain \nor  retain  employment  grows  out  of  economic  and \n- 23  -\n\nsocial  factors  which  operate  primarily outside \nthe workplace.  The  employer  neither  controls \nnor  creates  these  factors  as  he  creates  or \ncontrols  work  processes  and  materials.  For \nthese  reasons  we  conclude  that  the  policy  is \nnot  a  hazard within  the  meaning  of  the  general \nduty  clause. \nId.

OCAW  filed  the  petition  for \nreview  now  before  the  Court. \n~/  American  Cyanamid  had  previously  asked  Commissioner  Cottine \nto  recuse himself,  on  the  ground  that his  impartiality might \nreasonably be  questioned.  See  Respondent's  Application  for \nRecusal  by Commissioner  Cottine,  JA  15-17;  Respondent's \nConditional  Motion  for  Voir  Dire  of  Commissioner  Cottine,  JA \n18-20.  Commissioner  Cottine  had  formerly  acted  as  counsel \nfor  OCAW  in proceedings  before  the  Review  Commission, \nsometimes  along  with  Steven Wodka,  OCAW's  representative  in \nthe  Review  Commission  proceedings  in  this  case.  See,  ~' \nKoppers  Co.,  2  O.S.H.  Cas.  (BNA)  1354  (Rev.

Commission  decision  at 1606,  JA \n514. \n- 24  -\n\nSUMMARY  OF  ARGUMENT \nThe  ALJ  and  the  Review  Commission  correctly held  that \nthe  citation  fails  to  allege  a  violation  cognizable  under  the  OSH \nAct.  Congress  intended  the  Act  to provide  for  the  protection of \nemployees  from  physical  hazards,  whether  in  the  workplace  or  aris \ning  from  materials,  equipment,  services,  or  facilities  supplied  by \nan  employer.  The  Act  cannot  be  contorted  to  apply  to  the  circum \nstance  that  an  employee  excluded  from  a  particular  job might \ndecide  to  seek  a  medical  sterilization  in  order  to become  eligible \nfor  that  job. \nInstead  of  raising  issues  cognizable  under  the  OSH  Act, \nthe  citation  alleges  a  case  of  sex  discrimination  in  employment  or \nof  unfair  labor  practices.  The  citation  improperly  attempts  to \naddress  under  the  OSH  Act  issues  cognizable  only  other  statutes, \nsuch  as  Title VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964  or  the  National \nLabor  Relations  Act. \nThe  only hazard  involved  in  this  case  which  is  covered \nby  the  Act  is  the  risk  that  lead  poses  to  the  fetus.  The  OSH  Act \nmay  not  properly be  construed  to prohibit  employer  actions  to pro \ntect  the  fetus  potentially  in  the workplace  from  excess  exposure \nto  lead.  Questions  of whether  alternative means  of protecting  the \nfetus  could  have  been  used  are  irrelevant  to  this  case. \n- 25  -\n\nARGUMENT \nI.  THE  EXCLUSION  OF  WOMEN  OF  CHILDBEARING \nCAPACITY  FROM  CERTAIN  JOBS  IS  NOT \nADDRESSED  BY  THE  OSH  ACT \nThis  case  was  brought  under  the  wrong  statute.  If \nAmerican  Cyanamid  acted  contrary  to  law  in  adopting  and  imple-\nmenting  its Fetus  Protection  Policy,  which  the  Company  vigorously \ndenies,  then  the  offense  arises  under  Title VII,  the  NLRA,  or  tort \nlaw.  The  ALJ  and  the  Review  Commission  correctly  found  that \nCongress  never  intended  the  OSH  Act  to  apply  to  the  circumstance \nthat an  employee  excluded  from  a  particular  job might  decide  to \nseek  a  medical  sterilization in  order  to  become  eligible  for  that \njob.  Nor  may  Congress'  silence  in  the  OSH  Act  with  respect  to \nthis  circumstance be  contorted  to  a  reason  for  now  interpreting \nthe  Act  to  embrace  it. \nCongress  intended  the  Act  to  apply  only  to  those  kinds \nof  physical  hazards,  such  as  toxic  materials  and  harmful  physical \nagents,  which  are  present  in  the  workplace  itself or which  arise \nfrom  materials,  equipment,  services,  or  facilities  supplied  to \nemployees  by  their  employer.  This  intent  is apparent  from  the \nAct's  provisions,  its  legislative history,  cases  interpreting  and \napplying  the  Act,  and  OSHA's  own  interpretation of  the  Act. \nA.  The  Act  Is  Not  Infinite  in  Its Scope \nThe  Act  does  not  apply  to  every  conceivable  aspect  of \nemployer-employee  relations.  As  the  Supreme  Court has  held: \nCongress  gave  OSHA  the  responsibility to pro \ntect worker  health  and  safety  •  .  [T]he \nAct  in  no  way  authorizes  OSHA  to  repair  gen \neral unfairness  to  employees  that  is  unrelated \n- 26  -\n\nto  achievement  of health  and  safety \ngoals  .  Whatever  methods  [the Act] \nauthorize[s]  OSHA  to  apply,  it is  clear  that \nsuch  methods  must  be  justified on  the  basis  of \ntheir  relation  to  safety or health. \nAmerican  Textile Manufacturers  Institute,  Inc.  v.  Donovan,  452 \nu.s.  4. 90,  538,  540  (1981) .3--4/  Although  within  its proper  scope \nthe Act  may  properly be  read  broadly,  the  citation here  improperly \nattempts  to  stretch  the  Act  beyond  the  bounds  established by \nCongress  to  address  social  and  economic  concerns  independent  of \nhealth  and  safety goals. \n\"It  is  a  well-known  canon  of  construction  that  the  lan-\nguage  of  a  statute  is  the  best  indication of  legislative  intent.\" \nAFL-CIO  v.  Marshall,  570  F.2d  1030,  1036  (D.C.  Cir.  1978).  Here \nthe  language  of  the  statute  establishes  Congress'  intent  to  limit \nthe  Act  to physical hazards,  either  in  the  workplace  or  arising \nfrom  materials,  equipment,  services,  or  facilities  supplied  by  the \nemployer,  not  to  the  circumstances  alleged  by  the  citation. \nThe  proper  scope  of  the  Act  is  apparent  from  the \nCongressional  statement  of  findings  and  declaration  of purpose  and \npolicy  in  section  2  of  the  Act,  29  U.S.C.  §  651.  Section  2(a) \nprovides: \n34/  There  the  Supreme  Court  partially  reversed  this  Court's  deci \nsion  in AFL-CIO  v.  Marshall,  617  F.2d  636,  674-75  (D.C.  Cir. \n1979),  and  struck  down  a  provision  of  OSHA's  cotton  dust \nstandard  which  guaranteed  the  wages  and  other  employment \nbenefits  of  employees  transferred  out  of  the  workplace \nbecause  of  inability to wear  a  respirator.  OSHA  had  stated \nthat the  goal  of  the  provision was  to minimize  the  economic \nimpact  on  employees  of  inability to wear  a  respirator. \nSimilarly,  this  case  involves  only  social  and  economic  moti \nvations  for  voluntary  sterilizations. \n- 27  -\n\nThe  Congress  finds  that personal  injuries  and \nillnesses  arising  out  of work  situations  im \npose  a  substantial  burden  upon,  and  are  a \nhindrance  to,  interstate  commerce  • \n(Emphasis  added.)  Section  2(b)  reads  in  part: \nThe  Congress  declares  it to be  its purpose  and \npolicy  .  .  •  to  assure  so  far  as  possible \nevery  working  man  and  woman  in  the  Nation  safe \nand  healthful  working  conditions  and  to pre=- \nserve  our  human  resources  .  .  •  . \n(Emphasis  added.)  References  to  \"safe  and  healthful  working  con-\ndi tions\"  also  appear  in  sections  2 (b) ( 1) ,  2 (b) ( 2) ,  and  2 (b) ( 4) . \nSection  2(b) (6)  refers  to  \"connections  between  diseases  and  work \nin  environmental  conditions\",  and  section  2(b) (13)  refers  to \n\"injuries  and  diseases  arising  out  of  employment\".  Similar \nre f erenc. es  appear  throughout  the  Act3.-5/  These  prov1.s.1 ons  estab-\nlish that  Congress  intended  the  Act  to  apply  to  physical  hazards \npresent  in  the  workplace  or  arising  from  materials,  equipment, \nservices,  or  facilities  supplied  by  the  employer.  Nowhere  does \nthe  Act  purport  to  apply  to  exclusionary  employment  policies which \n~/  For  example,  section  6(b)(5),  29  u.s.c.  §  655(b) (5),  refers \nto  \"toxic  materials  or  harmful  physical  agents\".  Section \n17(k),  29  u.s.c.  §  666(j),  speaks  of \na  substantial  probability  that  death  or  serious  physical \nharm  could  result  from  a  condition which  exists,  or  from \none  or  more  practices,  means,  methods,  operations,  or \nprocesses  which  have  been  adopted  or  are  in  use,  in  such \nplace  of  employment. \n(Emphasis  added.)  This  provision  is  similar  to  the  Review \nCommission's  limitation  of  occupational  hazards  to \nprocesses  and  materials  which  cause  injury or  disease  by \noperating  directly  upon  employees  as  they  engage  in work \nor work-related  activities. \nCommission  decision  at  1600,  JA  508  (footnote  omitted). \n- 28  -\n\nallegedly  could  lead  women  to  seek  medical  sterilizations  in order \n36\nto become  eligible  for  certain  jobs. / \nThe  legislative history  provides  a  fuller  enumeration  of \nthe  kinds  of hazards  which  Congress  intended  to  include  within  the \nscope  of  the  Act.  For  example,  the  \"background\"  section of  the \nSenate  Report,  which  describes  the  circumstances  prompting  the \nintroduction  of  this  occupational  safety  and  health  legislation, \nrefers  to  \"industrial  accidents\"~ persons  \"disabled  on  the  job\"~ \n\"occupational  diseases\"~  \"industrial  poisons  such  as  lead  and \n36/  This  \"legislative  silence\"  reflects  \"considered  abstention \nfrom  regulation  ••. [which  must]  temper  judicial  creativity \n.  [in]  embellishing  upon  the  regulatory  scheme.\"  Ford \nMotor  Credit  Co.  v.  Milhollin,  444  u.s.  555,  565  (1980~See \nUnited  States  Lines,  Inc.  v.  Baldridge,  677  F.2d  940,  944  -- \n(D.C.  Cir.  1982).  Congress  had  no  need  to  address  the  cir \ncumstances  alleged  by  the  citation,  because  only  six  years \nearlier  it had  enacted  Title VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of \n1964,  42  u.s.c.  §  ~OOOe et  seq.  (\"Title VII\").  As  the  legis \nlative history  of  the  Pregnancy  Discrimination Act,  Pub.  L. \nNo.  95-555,  shows,  Congress  meant  Title VII  to  \"apply  to  all \naspects  of  employment--hiring,  reinstatement,  termination \n•  and  other  conditions  of  employment  ••• concerning  the \nchildbearing  process.\"  H.R.

That  not  all of  these \nhazards  are  discussed  in  the  context  of  the  general  duty \nclause  is  irrelevant,  contrary  to OCAW's  assertion.  OCAW  Br. \nat  30  n.78.  The  general  duty  clause  cannot  be  broader  in \n(Footnote  continued) \n- 30  -\n\n----- -------------------------------------------------------------~-------\nlitany nevertheless  shows  memorably  the  kinds  of hazards  that \nCongress  had  in mind  in  drafting  this  legislation.  Of  the  items \nincluded  in  this  list,  perhaps  most  illuminating  is  the  last,  the \nreference  to  \"the  chemical  and  physical  hazards  which  characterize \nmodern  industry\".  This  phrase  aptly  distills  a  distinguishing \naspect  of hazards  within  the  scope  of  the Act,  such  as  lead,  in \ncontrast  to  the  circumstance  alleged  here--neither  a  chemical  nor \na  physical  agent,  nor  a  safety hazard,  but  a  voluntary  decision by \nan  employee  to  seek  medical  sterilization  in order  to be  eligible \nfor  a  particular  job. \nWhile  Congress  did  not  explicitly define  the  terms \n\"hazard\"  or  \"safe  and  healthful  working  conditions\",  the  courts \nhave  defined  them.  Their  opinions  further  establish  that  the  Act \ndoes  not  apply  to  the hazard  alleged here. \nThe  Supreme  Court  has  authoritatively  construed  the \nmeaning  of  the  terms  \"hazard\"  and  \"working  conditions\"  as  used  by \nCongress  in  the  industrial  context  to  refer  to  elements  such  as \ntoxic  chemicals  or  fumes  and  other  physical  hazards.  In  Corning \nGlass  Works  v.  Brennan,  417  U.S.  188  (1974),  a  case  under  the \nEqual  Pay  Act  of  1963,  the  Court  rejected  a  contention  that  the \nterm  \"working  conditions\"  includes  a  wide  variety of aspects  of \nemployment,  including  the  time  of  day  during  which  employees  work \na  shift.  First  the  Court  recognized  that Congress  had  used \n(Footnote  continued  from  previous  page) \nscope  than  the Act  itself,  and  these  examples  illustrate  the \nintended  scope  of  the  Act. \n- 31  -\n\ntechnical  words  or  terms  of  art  in  the  statute,  and  ruled  that  the \nwords  must  be  interpreted  in  light of  their  technical  meanings. \nIt then ·stated: \nWhile  a  layman  might  well  assume  that \ntime  of  day  worked  reflects  one  aspect  of  a \njob's  \"working  conditions,\"  the  term  has  a \ndifferent  and  much  more  specific meaning  in \nthe  language  of  industrial  relations  . \n[T]he  element  of working  conditions  encom \npasses  two  subfactors:  \"surroundings\"  and \n\"hazards.\"  \"Surroundings\"  measures  the. \nelements,  such  as  toxic  chemicals  or  fumes, \nregularly  encountered  by  a  worker,  their \nintensity,  and  their  frequency.  \"Hazards\" \ntakes  into  account  the  physical  hazards \nregularly  encountered,  their  frequency,  and \nthe  severity of  injury  they  can  cause.  This \ndefinition of  \"working  conditions\"  is  . \nwell  accepted  across  a  wide  range  of American \nindustry. \nNowhere  in  any  of  these  definitions  is \ntime  of day  worked  mentioned  as  a  relevant \ncriterion.  The  fact  of  the  matter  is  that  the \nconcept  of  \"working  conditions,\"  as  used  in \nthe  specialized  language  of  job  evaluation \nsystems,  simply  does  not  encompass  shift dif \nferentials. \n417  u.s.  at  202  (emphasis  added,  footnotes  omitted).  Similarly, \nwhile  Congress  clearly  intended  the  OSH  Act  to  apply  to  \"elements \nsuch  as  toxic  chemicals  or  fumes\"  and  \"physical  hazards\",  nowhere \ndoes  the Act  or  its  legislative history mention  exclusionary \nemployment  policies which  allegedly may  encourage  women  employees \nto  choose  voluntary medical  sterilizations.  The  concepts  of \n\"hazard\"  and  \"working  conditions\"  as  used  in  the  specialized  lan-\nguage  of  the  Act  simply  do  not  encompass  the  circumstances  alleged \nby  the  citation. \nCorning  Glass  has  been  explicitly applied  to  the  OSHA \ncontext.  In  Southern  Pacific  Transportation  Co.  v.  Usery,  539 \n- 32  -\n\nF.2d  386,  390  (5th  Cir.  1976),  cert.  denied,  434  u.s.  874  (1977), \nthe  Fifth Circuit  stated: \nWe  think  the  term  \"working  conditions\"  [as \nused  in  section  4(b)(l)  of  the Act]  plainly \nrefers  to  something  more  limited  than  every \naspect  of  an  entire  industry.  The  term  has  a \ntechnical  meaning  in  the  language  of \nindustrial  relations;  it encompasses  both  a \nworker's  \"surroundings\"  and  the  \"hazards\" \nincident  to his work.  Corning  Glass  Works  v. \nBrennan,  417  u.s.  188,  202,  94  s.  Ct.  2223,  41 \nL.  Ed .  2 d  1  ( 19 7 4 ) • \nThe  Fourth  Circuit  also  relied  on  Corning  Glass  in  another  case \narising  under  section 4(b)(l)  of  the  Act.  Southern  Railway  Co.  v. \nOSHRC,  539  F.2d  335,  339  (4th  Cir.),  cert.  denied,  429  U.S.  999 \n(1976).  There  the  court  rejected  on  the  basis  of  Corning  Glass  a \nclaim  that  \"working  conditions\"  \"means  'the  aggregate  of  circum-\nstances  of  the  employment  relationship--that  is,  the  employment \nitself.'\"  Id.  (footnote  omitted).  These  two  cases  have  in  turn \nbeen  relied  on  by  this  Court  and  by  the  Third  Circuit  explicitly \nbecause  of  their  analysis  of  the  term  \"working  conditions\". \nBaltimore  & Ohio  Railroad  Co.  v.  OSHRC,  548  F.2d  1052,  1053-54 \n(D.C.  Cir.  1976);  Columbia  Gas  of  Pennsylvania,  Inc.  v.  Marshall, \n636  F.2d  913,  916-17  n.8  (3d.  Cir.  1980).  See  also U.S.  Air,  Inc. \nv.  OSHRC,  689  F.2d  1191,  1192-93  (4th  Cir.  1982);  PBR,  Inc.  v. \nSecretary of Labor,  643  F.2d  890,  896  (1st  Cir.  1981). \nAccordingly,  this  Circuit  and  several  others  have \nacknowledged  that  the  Supreme  Court's  definitions  in  Corning \nGlass  of  \"working  conditions\"  and  \"hazard\"  apply  to  the  OSH  Act, \nand  that  these  phrases  refer  to physical  hazards  rather  than  to \nall aspects  of  the  employment  relationship.  These  definitions, \n- 33  -\n\nalbeit broad,  necessarily  exclude  the  circumstances  alleged  in  the \ncitation  from  coverage  by  the  Act. \nEven  the  Review  Commission  cases  cited by  OCAW  to  the \ncontrary,  OCAW  Br.  at  34-36,  support  this  position.  C.R.  Burnett \n& Sons,  Inc.,  9  o.s.H.  Cas.  (BNA)  1009  (Rev.  Comm.  1980),  and \nSugar  Cane  Growers  Cooperative  of  Florida,  4  O.S.H.  Cas.  (BNA) \n1320  (Rev.  Comm.  1976),  both  involved  physical  hazards  of  the  kind \nincluded within  the  scope  of  the  term  \"working  conditions\"  as \ndefined  in  Corning  Glass.  Those  cases  stand  for  the  proposition \nthat \nan  employer  must  fulfill  its  job  safety and \nhealth  responsibilities with  respect  to  a \nservice,  be  it housing,  transportation,  or  the \nlike,  when  the  provision  of  that  service  is \ndirectly beneficial,  convenient,  or  advanta \ngeous  to  the  employer. \n40\n9  O.S.H.  Cas.  (BNA)  at  1018  (footnote  omitted) . /  As  illustrated \nby  those  cases,  an  employer ' s  \"job  safety and  health  responsi-\nbilities\"  extend  to  protecting  employees  from  physical  hazards, \nwhether  in  the  workplace  or  arising  from  materials,  equipment, \nservices,  or  facilities  supplied  by  the  employer.  Unlike  those \ncases,  however,  this  case  involves  no  allegation  that American \nCyanamid  provided  its women  employees  of  childbearing  capacity  a \n40/  OCAW  has  misrepresented  the  holdings  in  those  cases  to  sug \ngest  that  they  stand  for  the  proposition  that  any  condition \nof  employment  is  subject  to  the  Act:  yet  the  Review \nCommission  rejected  a  \"condition  of  employment\"  test  as  a \ntouchstone  for  determining  the  coverage  of  the  Act.  9  O.S .H. \nCas.  (BNA)  at  1018  n.25:  4  o.s.H.  Cas.  (BNA)  at  1321.  In  its \nopinion  in  this  case  the  Review  Commission  expressly  noted \nthat C.R.  Burnett  and  Sugar  Cane  could  not  be  strained  to \nsupport  a  finding  that  the  Act  applied  to  the  circumstances \nalleged here.

As  the  Review  Commission  noted  in  its opinion: \nIn  the  ten  years  of  the  Act's  existence, \nthe  Secretary has  not,  to our  knowledge,  cited \nan  employer  for  a  condition  or practice  that \ndid  not  operate  directly upon  employees  en \ngaged  in work  or work-related  activities. \n41\nCommission  decision  at 1600  n.22,  JA  508. /  OSHA's  statements  of \nenforcement  policy  are  similarly  limited  to  such  conditions  or \npractices.  For  example,  OSHA's  Industrial  Hygiene  Manual  limits \nits discussion  to  \"environmental  conditions  present  in  the \nworkplace  which  may  cause  illness  or  death.\"  OSHA  Industrial \nHygiene  Manual,  Chap.  I.,  §  A.l,  O.S.H.  Rep.  (BNA)  Reference  File \n77:8001.

Rep.  (BNA) \nReference  File  21 :8279.  And  in  the  lead  standard  preamble,  OSHA \nstated  its position  that  exclusionary  policies were  not  required, \nbut  nowhere  asserted  that  such  exclusionary policies  were \nprohibited by  the  Act.  See,  ~· 43  Fed.  Reg .  at  52966,  JA  335 . \nIn  summary,  the  Act  itself,  its  legislative history, \ncases  interpreting  the  Act  decided  by  the  courts  and  the  Review \nCommission,  and  OSHA' s  own  policy  statements  establish  that  the \nAct  applies  to  physical  hazards,  whether  in  the  workplace  or  aris-\ning  from  materials,  equipment,  services,  or  facilities  provided  by \nthe  employer.  The  citation here  deals  with  an  entirely different \nconcern,  that  an  employee  of  childbearing  capacity might  volun-\ntarily seek  a  medical  sterilization  in  order  to  become  eligible \nfor  a  particular  job.  This  alleged  concern  involves  not  physical \neffects,  but  social  and  economic  influences  on  the  decisionmaking \nof  an  employee  with  respect  to her  own  body.  Such  a  concern  is \nnot  substantially  comparable  to  the  physical  hazards  covered  by \nthe  Act.  Accordingly,  the  ALJ  and  Review  Commission  correctly \nfound  that  the  citation  fails  to  allege  a  violation  cognizable \nunder  the  Act. \nB.  The  Allegations  of  the  Citation Would  Be \nSignificant Only  Under  a  Different Statute \nThis  case  involves  allegations  of  unfair  labor  practices \nor  sex  discrimination  in  employment  in  the  guise  of an  OSHA  cita-\ntion.  While  American  Cyanamid  strongly  denies  that  its Fetus \nProtection  Policy  violated  either Title VII  or  the  NLRA,  the  Court \n- 36  -\n\nshould  recognize  that  these  statutes provided  the  inspiration  for \n42\nthe  citation here,  not  the  OSH  Act. / \nThe  ALJ  recognized  that  the  allegations  of  the  citation \nmay  raise  issues  cognizable  under  the  NLRA,  but  certainly not  the \n43\nAct. /  This  conclusion  finds  support  in  the  undisputed  fact  that \nOCAW  invoked  OSHA's  jurisdiction only  after having  failed  to \nresolve  a  grievance with  the  Company  after  two  months  of  negotia-\ntions.  It is  noteworthy  that  other  employment  policies  similar  to \nthe  Fetus  Protection  Policy have  in  a  number  of  instances  been \n42/  That  the  allegations  of  the  citation may  raise  issues  cogni \nzable  under  Title VII  or  the  NLRA  in  no  way  means  that  the \nCompany  violated  those  statutes.  As  the  Fourth  Circuit \nrecently declared  in  a  Title VII  case  based  on  similar  alle \ngations: \n[W]e  hold  that  under  appropriate  circumstances \nan  employer  may,  as  a  matter  of business \nnecessity,  impose  otherwise  impermissible  re \nstrictions on  employment  opportunity  that  are \nreasonably  required  to protect the health  of \nunborn  children  of women  workers  against \nhazards  of  the  workplace. \nv. \nWright  Olin  Corp.,  supra,  30  Fair Empl.  Prac.  Cas.  (BNA) \nat 904  (footnote  omitted).  That  case  involved  a  \"female \nemployment  and  fetal  vulnerability\"  policy which  restricted \nemployment  opportunities  for  women  in work  areas  involving \nexposure  to  lead  and  certain other  substances.  See  also \nDoerr  v.  B.F.  Goodrich  Co.,  484  F.  Supp.  320  (N.n:-Ohio \n1979)  (denying  a  preliminary  injunction  under  Title VII  where \nthe  plaintiff alleged  that  she  was  contemplating having \nherself  sterilized as  a  response  to  an  employer  policy \nexcluding women  employees  of childbearing  capacity  from  jobs \nin which  they  would  be  exposed  to  vinyl  chloride,  another \nfeto-toxin).

IT  IS  UNREASONABLE  TO  CONCLUDE  THAT  THE  ACT  BARRED \nTHE  COMPANY  FROM  PROTECTING  THE  FETUS  FROM  EXCESS \nEXPOSURE  TO  LEAD \nThe  preceding  sections  established  that  the  circum-\nstances  alleged by  the  citation are  not  addressed  by  the  OSH  Act. \nThe  only hazard  cognizable  under  the  Act  which  is  conceivably \ninvolved  in  this  case  is  lead.  It is  undisputed  that  that hazard \nwas  likely to  cause  serious  harm  to  any  fetus  carried by  an \nemployee  in  the  Inorganic  Pigments  Department.  Yet  the  citation \nin  effect alleges  that American  Cyanamid  violated  the  Act  by  pro-\ntecting  the  fetus  from  this  recognized  hazard.  But  to  construe \nthe Act  to mean  that protection  of  the  fetus  of  an  employee  is  a \nviolation  is  to  turn  the Act  on  its head,  since  its  sole purpose \nis  to  protect  employees  (and  their  unborn  children)  from  occupa \ntional  hazards.~/  Accordingly,  the  citation  fails  to  allege  a \nviolation of the  Act,  as  the ALJ  and  the  Review  Commission  found. \nThis  Court has  upheld  OSHA's  determination  that  the  pro-\ntections  of  the  Act  extend  to  the  fetus  of  an  employee,  and  that \nlead  poses  a  grave  danger  to  the  fetus.

For American  Cyanamid \nto have  allowed  an  employee  of  childbearing  capacity  (who  may  have \nbeen  pregnant without  knowing  it)  to work  in  the  Inorganic \nPigments  Department would  arguably have  violated  the  general  duty \nclause,  because  a  potential  fetus  would  have  been  exposed  to  a \nrecognized  hazard,  lead,  at  levels  likely to  cause  serious  harm  to \n56/ \nthe  fetus.-\nOther  federal  agencies,  in  fulfilling  their  statutory \nresponsibilities  for  protecting  occupational  safety and  health \nwithin  their  special  jurisdictions,  have  similarly  required  or \nadvised  the  exclusion  of pregnant workers  or workers  of childbear-\ning  capacity  from  places  of  employment  posing  hazards  to  the \nfetus.  Their  exclusionary policies,  designed  to  fulfill  occupa-\ntional  safety  and  health  goals,  further  establish  that  the  cita-\ntion here  fails  to  allege  a  violation  cognizable  under  the  Act. \nThis  Court  has  determined  that  the  Environmental \nProtection Agency  (\"EPA\")  has  statutory authority  to protect  the \nhealth  and  safety of  employees  occupationally  exposed  to  pes-\nticides.

In  1974  OSHA's  scientific advisor,  NIOSH,  recommended \nthat OSHA  adopt  a  standard  for  vinyl  chloride,  a  feto-toxin,  which \nwould  have  excluded  pregnant  women  from  jobs  involving  exposure  to \n61\nvinyl  chloride. / \nThese  federal  agency  recommendations,  similar  to  the \nFetus  Protection  Policy,  recognize  equal  employment  opportunity \n(Footnote  continued  from  previous  page) \nIt is  difficut  to  provide  for  protection  of  the \nunborn  without  affecting  the  rights  of women  to  equal \njob  opportunities.  This  difficulty  is  compounded \nbecause  the  critical  period  for  most  harm  to  the  unborn \noccurs  soon  after  conception--during  the  second  and \nthird month  after  conception,  when  a  women  may  not know \nthat  she  is  pregnant.  Based  on  our  assessments  of  the \nrisks  and  the  other  factors  noted  above,  we  believe  that \nthe  maximum  dose  to  the  unborn  should  be  a  factor  of  ten \nbelow  the  maximum  permitted  adult workers  in  any  year. \nThis  is  also  the  current  recommendation  of  the  National \nCouncil  on  Radiation  Protection  and  Measurements.  In \nRecommendation  8  we  propose  four  alternatives  which \nwould,  with  varying  degrees  of  certainty,  achieve  this \nobjective. \nThe  third  alternative  insures  protection  of \nall  unborn  throughout  gestation by  making  the  voluntary \nrequirements  of  the  second  mandatory.  It would  bar \nwomen  of  child-bearing  capacity  from  those  few  jobs \nwhich  involve  high  dose  rates. \nNIOSH,  Recommended  Occupational  Health  Standard  for  the \nManufacture  of Synthetic  Polymer  from  Vinyl  Chloride  (1974). \nIn  section  3.h.(vii)  NIOSH  stated: \nIn  view  of the  preliminary  results  of  animal  toxicology \nstudies,  it is  recommended  that  no  woman  who  is pregnant \nshould  be  employed  in  vinyl  chloride  monomer  operations. \nIn  issuing  this  recommendation  NIOSH  was  fulfilling  its \nresponsibilities  under  sections  20(a)(2)  and  22(c)(l)  of  the \nAct,  29  u.s.c.  §§  669(a)(2)  and  67l(c)(l).  NIOSH  later pur \nported  to withdraw  this  aspect  of  its  recommended  standard. \n- 47  -\n\nconcerns  of  exclusionary policies,  but  nevertheless  conclude  that \noccupational  safety and  health  concerns  for  the  fetus  potentially \nin  the  workplace  require  exclusion  of women  workers  from \nworkplaces  where  they would  be  exposed  to hazards  harmful  to  the \nfetus.  These  recommendations  further  establish  that  the  OSH  Act, \nwhose  only  purpose  is  to protect  the  occupational  safety  and \nhealth of  employees,  cannot  be  construed  to  prohibit,  on  the  basis \nof  equal  employment  opportunity  concerns,  an  exclusionary  policy \ndesigned  to  protect  the  fetus. \nOCAW  argues,  however,  that American  Cyanamid  violated \nthe  general  duty  clause  because  it could  have  protected  the  fetus \npotentially  in  the  Inorganic  Pigments  Department  by  other means. \nAside  from  the  infeasibility or  ineffectiveness  of OCAW's  proposed \n62\nalternatives, /  this  argument  fails  for  several  reasons. \nFirst,  it is  clear  from  the  face  of  the  citation  that \nAmerican  Cyanamid  is  not  charged  with  failure  to  implement  feasi-\nble  alternatives  to  the  Fetus  Protection  Policy.  The  description \nof  the  alleged  violation makes  no  reference  to  alternatives,  and \nthe  citation requires  that  the  alleged  violation be  corrected \n\"immediately\".  \"Immediate\"  abatement  could  only  consist  of \nrescinding  the  Fetus  Protection  Policy  and  allowing  women  of \nchildbearing  capacity  to work  in  the  Inorganic  Pigments  Deparment, \nregardless  of whether  or  not  feasible  alternatives  had  been  imple-\nmented  to  protect  the  fetus.  It is  clear  that OCAW  misconstrues \nOSHA's  citation by  reading  it to  require  implementation  of \nalternatives. \n62/  See  pages  10-14,  supra. \n- 48  -\n\nSecond,  it is  clear  that  the  general  duty  clause  does \nnot  mandate  particular means  of  abating  a  hazard,  here  the  risk of \nharm  that  lead  poses  to  the  fetus.  Any  feasible  means  of abate-\n63/ \nment  will  satisfy the  general  duty  clause.--\nThird,  the  thrust of OCAW's  proposed  alternatives  is \nthat American  Cyanamid  did  not  comply  with  specific  applicable \nstandards  governing  control  of  ambient  air  lead  levels  and  use  of \nrespirators.  These  allegations  are  the  subject  of a  separate  pro \n64\nceeding,  OSHRC  Docket  No.  79-2438. /  It is well  established  that \nthe  general  duty  clause  is preempted  where,  as  here,  specific \nstandards  apply.~/ \nAnd  fourth,  to  the  extent  that OCAW's  arguments  are \nbased  on  its belief that  the  then-existing  standards  were \nSee,  ~· Baroid  Div.  of NL  Industries,  Inc.  v.

Such  a  result  is manifestly  contrary  to  the  Act, \nwhose  purpose  is  \"to  assure  so  far  as  possible  every working  man \nand  woman  [and  fetus  of  such  a  woman]  in  the  Nation  safe  and  heal-\nthful  working  conditions  and  to  preserve  our  human  resources.\" \nSection  2(b),  29  u.s.c.  §  65l(b).  Since  the  citation  requires  a \nconstruction of  the  Act  which  is  clearly at odds  with  the  Act's \npurpose,  the  citation  fails  to  allege  a  violation  cognizable  under \n67\nthe  Act. / \n66/  See,~, Cornell  & Co.,  10  O.S.H.

The  circumstances  raise  legal  issues,  if at  all, \nunder  one  or more  other  statutes.  The  ALJ  and  Review  Commission \ntherefore  properly  granted  summary  judgment  for  American  Cyanamid \non  the  ground  that  the  citation  failed  to  allege  a  violation  cog-\nnizable  under  the  Act. \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  OCAW's  petition  for  review \nshould  be  DENIED  and  the  Review  Commission's  order  dismissing  the \ncitation  should  be  AFFIRMED. \nRespectfully  submitted, \n~L~ \nDonald  L.

The  only  question  presented  is  whether  the \nOccupational  Safety  and  Health  Review  Commission  committed \nlegal  error  in  holding,  on  a  motion  for  summary  judgment,  that \nsuch  a  policy  is  not  a  hazard  cognizable  under§  S(a) (1)  of  the \nOccupational  Safety  and  Health  Act,  29  u.s.c.  §  654 (a) (1)  (the \n\"general  duty  clause\"). \nOne  would  therefore  have  expected  that  the  brief  for \nrespondent,  American  Cyanamid  Company  (\"Cyanamid\")  would \n\n- 2  -\nad6ress  the  question  whether  the  policy  at  issue  comes  within \nthe  language  of  the  general  duty  clause,  and  within  the  purpose \nof  the  clause  as  articulated  in  its  legislative  history~  But \nCyanamid's  brief  is  silent on  those  points.  Indeed,  Cyanamid \nleaves  completely  unanswered  our  demonstration  that  the  policy \nat  issue  here  falls  within  the  plain meaning  of  the  general \nduty  clause,l  and  that  the  legislative  history  of  the \nprovision  supports  its application  to  this  case.2 \nRather  than  focus  on  the  issue  actually  presented, \nCyanamid  prefers  to  knock  down  a  straw man  by  laboring  to \nestablish  that  \"the  Act  is  not  infinite  in  its  scope\"  (Brief \nfor  Respondent,  American  Cyanamid  Company  (\"Resp.  Br.\")  at \n26).  As  we  show  in  Part  I  infra,  none  of  the  arguments \nadvanced  by  Cyanamid  in  support  of  that  undisputed  proposition \nundercuts  our  showing  that  the  sterilization  rule  at  issue  here \nis within  the  scope  of  the  general  duty  clause. \nAfter  devoting  only  a  few  pages  to  its discussion  of  the \nfinite  scope  of  the  Act,  Cyanamid  spends  the  rest of  its brief \non  two  irrelevant  subjects.  First,  Cyanamid  argues  that  \"the \nallegations  of  the  citation would  be  significant  only  under  a \ndifferent  statute,\"  namely  the  National  Labor  Relations  Act \nand/or  Title VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964.  Id.  at \n36-42.  But  Cyanamid  never  explains  how  its contentions  in  this \nregard  are  of  any  pertinence,  and  we  show  in  Part  II  infra  that \nthey  are  not. \n1  See  Brief  for  Petitioners  (\"Pet.

Resp.  Br.  at  43-51.  But  as  we  show  in \nPart  III  infra,  the  defense  Cyanamid  seeks  to  advance  was  not \naddressed  by  the  Commission,  because  it turns  on  a  host  of \ndisputed  issues  of  fact  which  can  only  be  resolved  in  an \nevidentiary  hearing  on  the  merits  of  the  citation.  As  we \nfurther  show,  there  is  virtually  no  chance  that  Cyanamid  could \nprevail  on  this  defense  after  a  hearing;  but  at  the  very  least, \nthe  issue  cannot  be  resolved  in  favor  of  the  Company  at  this \npreliminary  stage  in  the  proceedings. \nI.  ALTHOUGH  \"THE  ACT  IS  NOT  INFINITE  ~N \nITS  SCOPE,\"  IT  REACHES  THE  VIOLATION \nAT  ISSUE  HERE. \nA.  The  Facts  Concerning  Cyanamid's  Adoption \nand  Implementation  of  the  Sterilization \nPolicy  Must  Be  Considered  in  Determining \nthe  Nature  of  That  Policy. \nBefore  addressing  the  question  whether  its  sterilization \npolicy  is  cognizable  under  the  Act,  Cyanamid  attempts  to \nestablish  that  the  only  events  that  may  be  considered  in  this \nregard  are  those  that  took  place  within  the  six-month  period \npreceding  the  issuance  of  the  citation.  See  Resp.  Br.  3-4, \n19.  Cyanamid's  effort  is  understandable,  because  if  its \nposition  were  accepted,  virtually  all  the  evidence  concerning \nthe  adoption  and  implementation  of  the  policy  at  issue, \nincluding  the  five  sterilizations  that  it caused,  would  be \nforeclosed  from  consideration.  Cyanamid  is  certainly  correct \nin  implicitly  acknowledging  that  this  evidence  is  extremely \n\n- 4  -\nharmful  to  its  cause;  but  the  company's  contention  that  the \nevidence  cannot  be  considered  is wrong. \nCyanamid's  contention  is  based  on  §  9(c)  of  the  Act,  29 \nu.s.c. \n§  658(c),  which  provides  that  \"[n]o  citation may  be \nissued  under  this  section  after  the  expiration  of  six  months \nfollowing  the  occurrence  of  any  violation.\"  Cyanamid  does  not \nmaintain,  however,  that  the  instant  citation  was  untimely  under \n§9(c);  nor  could  such  an  argument  succeed,  because  it is \nundisputed  that  the  challenged  sterilization  rule  was  in  effect \nduring  the  six  months  preceding  the  citation.3  Rather, \nCyanamid's  contention  is  that  in  assessing  the  nature  of  the \nsterilization  rule,  \"all  occurrences  before  April  1979  (i.e., \nthe  date  six  months  prior  to  the  issuance  of  the  citation] \nare  immaterial  to  this  proceeding  •••• \"  Resp.  Br.  19. \nThis  contention  is  contrary  to  settled  law.  The  fact  that \nan  event  occurred  outside  the  period  that  is  actionable  under  a \n3  Cyanamid  notes  that  during  this  period  no  women  of  child \nbearing  capacity  were  working  in  the  Inorganic  Pigments \nDepartment,  where  the  sterilization  rule  was  applicable. \n(Resp.  Br.  5).  But  Cyanamid  cannot  and  does  not  contend  that \nthis  renders  the  sterilization  rule  immune  from  citation. \nDuring  the  period  in  question  any  female  employee  who  desired \nto  transfer  into  the  Inorganic  Pigments  Departmen~, or  to \nreturn  to  that  Department,  or  otherwise  to  obtain  a  job  there, \ncontinued  to  be  subject  to  the  rule  requiring  that  she  undergo \nsurgical  sterilization as  a  prerequisite  to  such  employment. \nThe  fact  that  during  the  six  months  preceding  the  citation  no \nemployee  underwent  sterilization as  a  result  of  the  rule  -- and \nthat  as  a  consequence  no  woman  worked  in  the  Inorganic  Pigments \nDepartment  -- does  not  put  the  rule  beyond  the  reach  of  the \nAct.  \"The  Act  does  not  wait  for  an  employee  to  die  or  become \ninjured.  It authorizes  •.•  the  issuance  of  citations  in  the \nhope  that  these  will  act  to  prevent  deaths  or  injuries  from \never  occurring.\"  Whirlpool  Corp.  v.  Marshall,  445  U.S.  l,  12 \n(1980).  See,  e.g.,  National  Realty  & Constr.  Co.  v.  OSHRC,  489 \nF.2d  1257,  1267  (D.C.  Cir.  1973);  Empire-Detroit  Steel  Div.  v. \n(yy \nOSHRC,  579  F.2d  378,  384  (6th  Cir.  1978);  Brennan  v.  OSHRC \nLactos  Laboratories),  494  F.2d  460,  463  (8th  Cir.  1974). \n\n- 5  -\nstatute  of  limitations  does  not  mean  that  the  event  is \nimmaterial;  for,  \"earlier  events  may  be  utilized  to  shed  light \non  the  true  character  of  matters  occurring  within  the  limita-\nu.s. \ntions  period  •••. \"  Machinists  Local  v.  Labor  Board,  362 \n411,  416  (1960).  See  also  United  Airlines,  Inc.  v.  Evans,  431 \nu.s. \n553,  558  (1977)  (events  outside  the  limitations  period \n\"may  constitute  relevant  background  evidence  in  a  proceeding  in \nwhich  the  status  of  a  current  practice  is at  issue  •••• \") .4 \nAccordingly,  Cyanamid  cannot  be  heard  to  argue  that  the \nCourt  should  disregard  the  evidence  which  shows  the  \"true \ncharacter\"  of  the  sterilization  rule  (Machinists,  supra,  362 \nu.s. \nat  416). \nB.  Cyanamid's  Arguments  that  the  Sterilization \nPolicy  is  Not  Cognizable  Under  the  Act  Lack \nMerit. \nCyanamid's  argument  begins  with  a  dissertation  on  the \ntheme  that  \"the  Act  is  not  infinite  in  its  scope.\"  Resp.  Br. \n26.  We  readily  concede  that  proposition;  but  as  we  now  show, \nthe  arguments  Cyanamid  advances  in  support  of  it do  not \novercome  our  demonstration  that  the  sterilization policy  is \ncognizable  under  §  5 (a) (1). \n4  Indeed,  Cyanamid  itself,  while  asserting  that  the  events \nof  1978  are  \"immaterial,\"  states  in  the  same  breath  that  \"the \nsterilizations  that  occurred  in  1978  ••.  do  show  that  the  ••• \nsterili~ation policy  alleged  by  the  citation did  not  involve \n[the  presence  of  sterilizing  chemicals  or  the  use  of  physical \nforce].\"  Resp.  Br.  20,  n.  32.  By  that  statement  Cyanamid \nappears  to  recognize  that  the  promulgation  and  implementation \nof  the  sterilization policy,  and  the  five  sterilizations  that \noccurred,  may  properly  be  considered  in  assessing  whether  the \npolicy  for  which  the  Company  was  cited  constitutes  a  \"recog \nnized  hazard[]  that  [was]  causing  or  likely  to  cause \nserious  physical  harm  to  • • •  employees\"  ( §  5 (a) ( 1) ) • \n\n- 6  -\n1.  Cyanamid  first cites  a  number  of  provisions  of  the \nstatute which,  according  to  the  Company,  \"establish  that \nCongress  intended  the  Act  to  apply  [only]  to  physical  hazards \npresent  in  the  workplace  or  arising  from  materials,  equipment, \nservices,  or  facilities  supplied  by  the  employer.\"  Resp.  Br. \n28.  But  the  provisions  Cyanamid  cites  refer  to  such  matters  as \n6 \n\"work  situations,\"5  \"working  conditions,\" \"injuries \n7 \narising  out  of  employment,\" and  \"practices  •••  which  have \n8 \nbeen  adopted  •••  in  [a]  place  of  employment.\" Simply  to \nquote  those  provisions,  which  are  fully  broad  enough  to \nencompass  the  challenged  sterilization  rule,  is  to  refute \n9 \nCyanamid's  narrow  construction  of  them. That  construction  is \nsupported  by  nothing  but  Cyanamid's  wishful  thinking. \n2.  Cyanamid  emphasizes  that  the  hazards  mentioned  in  the \nlegislative  history  of  the  statute  involved  \"chemical[s]  ••• [,] \nphysicalagent[s]  •••  [and]  safetyhazard[s].\"  Resp.  Br.  31. \nBut  as  we  explained  in  our  opening  brief,  that  point  proves \nnothing,  because  the  kinds  of  hazards  to  which  Cyanamid  refers \nare  far  and  away  the  most  common  forms  of  occupational  hazards, \nand  it  is  therefore  hardly  surprising  that  they  were  the  focus \nof  the  legislators'  attention.  See  Pet.  Br.  29-31.  Of \n5  Section  2(a),  29  u.s.c.  §  65l(a),  quoted  in  Resp.  Br.  at  28. \n6  Section  2(b),  29  u.s.c.  §  65l(b),  quoted  in  Resp.

Br.  28,  n.  77. \n\n- -\n---------~o---~--\n- 7  -\nparticular  significance,  the  absence  of  any  legislative \nmaterials -concerning  the  type  of  hazard  involved  here  is \nperfectly  understandable,  given  Cyanamid's  acknowledgement  that \nthe  kind  of  practice  at  issue  only  carne  into  being  \"during  the \n1970's\"  (Resp.  Br.  6),  subsequent  to  the  passage  of  the  Act. \nIn  these  circumstances,  the  issue  is  not  whether  Congress \nhad  practices  of  this  nature  in  mind  when  it legislated,  but \nwhether  Congress  \"has  made  a  choice  of  language  which  fairly \nbrings  [the]  given  situation  within  [the]  statute.\"10  If \nthat  is  the  case,  the  practice  is covered  by  the  statute  unless \nit can  fairly  be  concluded  that  \"had  [the  situation]  been \nforeseen,  Congress  would  have  so  varied  its comprehensive \nlanguage  as  to  exclude  it from  the  operation  of  the  act.\"ll \nAs  we  have  previously  shown,  under  this  governing  test  the \nchallenged  sterilization  rule  is  cognizable  under  §  5 (a) (1). \nPet.  Br.  24-31.  Nothing  in  Cyanamid's  brief  undercuts  that \ndispositive  point. \n3.  Lacking  support  in  this  statute,  Cyanamid  seeks \nsolace  in  a  decision  under  the  Equal  Pay  Act:  Corning  Glass \nu.s. \nWorks  v.  Brennan,  417  188  (1974).  The  Company's  unlikely \nendeavor  fails. \nThe  issue  in  Corning  was  whether  night  inspection  work  was \n\"equal\",  for  purposes  of  compensation  under  the  Equal  Pay  Act, \nu.s. \n10  Barr  v.  United  States,  324  83,  90  (1945).  See  also \nDiamond  v.  Chakrabarty,  447  U.S.  303,  315  (1980). \nu.s. \n11  People  of  Puerto  Rico  v.  Shell  Co.,  302  253,  257 \n(1937). \n\n-----c-- - - -- -\n- 8  -\nto  the  same  work  performed  during  the  day,  or  whether  the  work \nwas  different  because  it involved  different  \"working  condi \n12 \ntions\"  within  the  meaning  of  that  statute. In  addressing \nthat  question  the  Court  began  by  noting  that  in  drafting  the \nEqual  Pay  Act,  Congress  made  a  deliberate  decision  to  adopt  the \nterminology  that  was  generally  used  in  the  industrial  job \nevaluation  plans  that  would  be  subject  to  that  Act.  Id.  at \n198-201.  For  that  reason,  the  Court  looked  to  the  language  of \njob  evaluation  plans  in  order  to  answer  the  question  whether \ntime  of  day  was  regarded  as  a  \"working  condition\"  for  purposes \nof  determining  compensation: \nWhile  a  layman  might  well  assume  that \ntime  of  day  worked  reflects  one  aspect  of  a \njob's  \"working  conditions,\"  the  term  has  a \ndifferent  and  much  more  specific  meaning  in \nthe  language  of  industrial  relations.  As \nCorning's  own  representative  testified  at \nthe  hearings,  the  element  of  working \nconditions  encompasses  two  subfactors: \n\"surroundings\"  and  \"hazards.\"  \"Surround \nings\"  measures  the  elements,  such  as  toxic \nchemicals  or  fumes,  regularly  encountered \nby  a  worker,  their  intensity,  and  their \nfrequency.  \"Hazards\"  takes  into  account \nthe  physical  hazards  regularly  encountered, \ntheir  frequency,  and  the  severity  of  injury \nthey  can  cause.  This  definition  of  \"work \ning  conditions\"  is  not  only  manifested  in \nCorning's  own  job  evaluation  plans  but  is \nalso  well  accepted  across  a  wide  range  of \nAmerican  industry. \n12  The  Equal  Pay  Act  prohibits  paying  different  wages  to  men \nand  women  \"for  equal  work  on  jobs  the  performance  of  which \nrequires  equal  skill,  effort,  and  responsibility,  and  which  are \nu.s.c. \nperformed  under  similar  working  conditions  .••• \"  29  § \n206 (d) (l). \n\n- -- - ----\n- 9  -\nNowhere  in  any  of  these  definitions  is \n.time  of  day  worked  mentioned  as  a  relevant \ncriterion.  The  fact  of  the  matter  is  that \nthe  concept  of  \"working  conditions,\"  as \nused  in  the  specialized  language  of  job \nevaluation  systems,  simply  does  not \nencompass  shift differentials.  Indeed, \nwhile  Corning  now  argues  that  night \ninspection  work  is  not  equal  to  day \ninspection  work,  all  of  its own  job \nevaluation  plans,  including  the  one  now  in \neffect,  have  consistently  treated  them  as \nequal  in  all  respects,  including  working \nconditions.  [Id.  at  202-203  (emphasis \nadded).]  --\nCyanamid's  argument  that  Corning  sheds  light  on  the  meaning \nof  the  term  \"hazard\"  in  §  5 (a) (l)  of  the  OSH  Act  is  untenable. \nCorning  did  not  involve  any  issue  as  to  whether  or  not  a \n\"hazard\"  was  present  at  a  workplace;  it involved  the  totally \nunrelated  question  whether  time  of  day  is  a  \"working  condition\" \nfor  purposes  of  determining  compensation.  And  in  any  event, \nwhat  was  at  issue  in  Corning  was  \"the  specialized  language  of \njob  evaluation  systems,\"  id.  at  203,  because  the  Equal  Pay  Act \nwas  adopted  to  govern  such  systems  and  was  deliberately drafted \nso  as  to  employ  their  terminology.  The  OSH  Act,  of  course,  has \nnothing  to  do  with  job  evaluation  or  compensation,  and \nconsequently  there  is  no  basis  for  importing  \"the  specialized \nlanguage  of  job  evaluation  systems\"  into  this  statute.l3 \n13  Cyanamid  notes  that  some  courts  have  cited  Corning  in \nconstruing  the  meaning  of  the  term  \"working  conditions\"  in  § \n4 (b)  (l)  of  the  OSH  Act,  29  u.s.c.  §  653 (b) (l),  which  provides \nthat  the  statute  \"shall  [not]  apply  to  working  conditions  of \nemployees  with  respect  to  which  other  •••  agencies  •••  exercise \nstatutory  authority  to  prescribe  or  enforce  standards  or \nregulations  affecting  occupational  safety  or  health.\"  See  Resp. \nBr.  32-33.  But  in  those  cases,  as  in  Corning,  no  question  was \n(Continued) \n\n- 10  -\n4.  Cyanamid's  final  contention  is  that  prior  decisions  of \nthe  Commission,  and  prior  practice  of  the  Secretary  under  the \nAct,  support  the  Company's  position.  Resp.  Br.  34-36.  Again, \nCyanamid  is mistaken. \nIn  our  opening  brief  we  showed  that  the  theory  adopted  by \nthe  commission  in  this  case-- i.e.,  that  the  Act  applies  only \n14 \nto  \"work  processes  and  materials\" -- is  inconsistent  with \nthe  Commission's  own  decisions  in  C.R.  Burnett  & Sons,  Inc., \n9  OSHC  1009  (1980);  and  Sugar  Cane  Growers  Cooperative  of \nFlorida,  4  OSHC  1320  (1976).  Pet.  Br.  34-35.  Cyanamid  makes  no \nattempt  to  support  the  Commission's  theory,  but  puts  forward  its \n13  (Continued) \npresented  as  to  whether  or  not  a  \"hazard\"  was  present  at  a \nworkplace,  and  the  cases  are  therefore  not  relevant.  The \nquestion  discussed  in  the  cases  upon  which  Cyanamid  relies  was \nwhether  §  4 (b)  (l)  exempts  entire  industries  from  the  Act,  or \nwhether  only  particular  situations  are  exempted.  In  answering \nthat  question,  three  courts  have  cited  Corning  for  the  obvious \nproposition  that  \"the  term  'working  conditions'  plainly  refers \nto  something  more  limited  than  every  aspect  of  an  entire \nindustry.\"  Southern  Pacific  Transp.  Co.  v.  Usery,  539  F.2d  386, \n390  (5th  Cir.  1976),  cert.  denied,  434  U.S.  874  (1977);  Southern \nRailway  Co.  v.

Marshall,  636  F.2d  913,  916-917,  n.  8  (3d  Cir.  1980). \nWhether  or  not  it was  appropriate  for  those  decisions  to  cite \nCorning  in  that  limited  respect,  the  decisions  plainly  do  not \n--~~~~~~the question  presented  here.  We  note  further  that \nCyanamid  err  ·  ·  ·  l.r \nacknowledged  that  the  Supreme  Court's  definitions  in  Corning \nGlass  of  'working  conditions'  and  'hazard'  apply  to  the  OSH  Act \n•••. \"  (Resp.  Br.  33).  In  the  decision  cited  by  Cyanamid,  this \nCourt  agreed  with  the  holdings  in  Southern  Pacific  and  Southern \nRailway,  supra;  but  significantly,  the  Court  did  not  refer  to \nCorning,  but  referred  instead  to  other  aspects  of  the  reasoning \nin  Southern  Pacific  and  Southern  Railway.  See  Baltimore  & Ohio \nRR  Co.  v.  OSHRC,  548  F.2d  1052,  1053-54  (D.C.  Cir.  1976). \n9  OSHC  at  1600  (JA  508). \n\n--\n.  ······ --- - ··--- --- --,----- -\n- 11  -\nown  theory  -- that  the  Act  reaches  only  \"physical  hazards\" \nand  then  contends  that  C.R.  Burnett  and  Sugar  Cane  Growers  are \nconsistent  with  such  a  theory.  Resp.  Br.  34. \nIt  is  not  clear  precisely  what  Cyanamid  means  by  \"physical \nhazards;\"  but  whatever  the  Company  may  mean,  C.R.  Burnett  and \nSugar  Cane  Growers  do  not  purport  to  confine  the  application  of \nthe  Act  to  \"physical  hazards;\"  rather,  the  approach  adopted  by \nthe  Commission  in  those  cases  is  that  \"a  particular  condition\" \nis  covered  by  the  Act  if  it  \"bears  a  sufficient  nexus  to \nemployment  \"  C.R.  Burnett,  9  OSHC  at  1018.  The  signifi-\ncance  of  the  Commission•s  decision  in  c.  R.  Burnett  is  its \nrecognition  that  any  hazard  which  is  created  by  an  employer  and \n\"bears  a  1direct  relationship  to  employment•\"  is  within  the \nscope  of  the  Act,  whether  or  not  the  employer  requires  employees \n15 \nto  subject  themselves  to  the  ha~~ involved.  Ibid.\n15  As  the  Commission  emphasized  in  C.R.  Burnett,  in  that  case \nemployees  were  not  required  by  their  employer  to  reside  in  the \ntemporary  labor  camps  where  the  cited  hazards  existed;  and  in \nSugar  Cane  Growers  employees  were  not  required  by  their  employer \nto  accept  the  hazardous  transportation  to  the  worksite  which  was \nat  issue  in  that  case.  See  9  OSHC  at  1011,  1018. \nCyanamid  asserts  that  \"OCAW  has  misrepresented  the  holdings \nin  [C.R.  Burnett  and  Sugar  Cane  Growers]  to  suggest  that  they \nstand  for  the  proposition  that  any  condition  of  employment  is \nsubject  to  the  Act;  yet  the  Review  Commission  rejected  a  •condi \ntion  of  employment•  test  as  a  touchstone  for  determining  the \ncoverage  of  the  Act.\"  Resp.  Br.  34,  n.  40  (emphasis  in \noriginal).  The  Company•s  charge  of  \"misrepresent[ation]\"  is \nunwarranted.  In  our  brief  we  stated  that  the  Comission \n\"rejected  as  unduly  stringent  [the]  •condition  of  employment• . \n[test].\"  Pet.  Br.  35.  That  statement  is  precisely  correct. \nSee  C.R.  Burnett,  9  OSHC  at  1018,  n.  25  (\"we  reject  the  more \nrestrictive  •condition  of  employment•  test\").  As  we  explained, \nthe  test  adopted  in  C.  R.  Burnett  is  whether  a  practice  has  a \n\"ditect  relationship  to  employment.\" \n\n- 12  -\nThus,  C.R.  Burnett  and  Sugar  Cane  Growers  lend  no  more \nsupport  to  Cyanamid's  construction  of  the  Act  than  they  do  to \nthe  construction  the  Commission  adopted  in  this  case. \nNor  is  Cyanamid  correct  in  asserting,  with  the  Commission, \nthat  the  Secretary  has  not  previously  construed  the  Act  to  apply \nto  anything  other  than  \"a  condition  or  practice  that  ••• \noperate[s)  directly  upon  employees  engaged  in  work  or  work-\nrelated  activities.\"  Resp.  Br.  35,  quoting  9  OSHC  at  1600, \nn.  22  (JA  508).  As  we  discussed  in  our  opening  brief,  the \nstandard  promulgated  by  the  Secretary  with  respect  to  occupa-\ntional  exposure  to  lead  prohibits  the  practice  of  \"prophylactic \nchelation,\"  irrespective  of  whether  that  proscribed  medical \nprocedure  is performed  at  the  workplace  or  in  a  hospital.  Pet. \nBr.  36-38.  Like  the  hazard  at  issue  here,  prophylactic  chela-\ntion  involves  subjecting  employees  to  a  medical  procedure  for \nthe  purported  purpose  of  controlling  the  effects  of  their \nexposure  to  lead.  And,  like  the  hazard  at  issue  here,  chelation \ndoes  not  \"operate  directly  upon  employees  engaged  in  work  or \nwork-related  activities.\"  Thus,  Cyanamid  and  the  Commission  err \nin  suggesting  that  the  citation  issued  in  this  case  represents \na  departure\"from  the  Secretary's  past  construction  of  the \n16 \nAct. What  is  more,  Cyanamid  has  no  answer  to  our  argument \n16  Cyanamid  also  notes  that  the  Secretary's  informal \nguidelines  on  the  general  duty  clause  provide  that  \"[i]n \ngeneral,  a  'hazard'  within  the  meaning  of  Section  5(a) (l)  is  a \ndangerous  condition  or  a  harmful  situation.\"  Resp.  Br.  35-36. \nAs  in  the  case  of  the  various  statutory  provisions  previously \ndiscussed  which  employ  similar  language  (see  p.  6  supra),  the \nbreadth  of  the  Secretary's  formulation  supports  OCAW's  position, \nnot  Cyanamid's. \n\n-------------------------------------------------~------ ----\n- 13  -\nthat  if  the  theories  espoused  by  the  Commission  and  the  Company \nin  this  case  were  to  prevail,  OSHA's  ability  to  regulate \npractices  such  as  prophylactic  chelation  would  be  severely \n17 \nimpeded.\nIn  sum,  Cyanamid's  arguments  in  support  of  its contention \nthat  the  sterilization policy  is  outside  the  scope  of  the  Act \ncannot  withstand  analysis.  It may  well  be  that  the  Congress \nthat  enacted  this  statute  did  not  envision  the  day  when \nemployers  would  seek  to  \"control\"  exposures  to  lead  and  other \ntoxic  substances  by  inducing  employees  to  undergo  such \n\"prophylactic\"  procedures  as  surgical  sterilization or \nchelation.  But  where  an  employer's  policy  with  respect  to  such \na  procedure  \"caus[es]  or  [is]  likely  to  cause  death  or  serious \nharm  to  his  employees\"  (§  S(a) (1)),  the  policy  falls  not  only \nwithin  the  literal  terms  of  the  general  duty  clause,  but  within \nthe  purpose  of  the  clause  as  well:  to  ensure  that  employers \n\"bring  no  adverse  effects  to  the  life  and  health  of  their \nemployees  throughout  the  course  of  their  employment.\"l8 \n17  Significantly,  in  its  brief  Cyanamid  neither  denies  that \nits  theories  would  lead  to  such  a  result,  nor  contends  that  such \na  result  would  be  acceptable.  Rather,  notwithstanding  the \nemphasis  placed  on  this  point  in  our  opening  brief,  Cyanamid  has \nstudiously  avoided  the  subject  of  prophylactic  chelation  and \nother  harmful  medical  procedures  performed  on  employees. \n18  s.

THE  POTENTIAL  APPLICATION  OF  THE  NATIONAL \nLABOR  RELATIONS  ACT  OR  TITLE  VII  OF  THE  CIVIL \nRIGHTS  ACT  OF  1964  TO  CERTAIN  ASPECTS  OF \nCYANAMID'S  CONDUCT  IS  OF  NO  RELEVANCE  HERE. \nCyanamid  argues  at  length  that  \"the  allegations  of  the \ncitation  would  be  significant  only  under  a  different  statute,\" \nquixotically  attempting  to  make  much  of  the  fact  that  its \nconduct ·in  promulgating  and  implementing  the  so-called  Fetal \nProtection  Policy  may  have  violated  the  National  Labor  Relations \nAct  (\"NLRA\"),  Cyanamid's  collective  bargaining  agreement  with \nOCAW,  and/or  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964.  Resp. \nBr.  36-42.  Although  we  do  believe  that  the  OSH  Act  is  not  the \nonly  statute  Cyanamid  has  violated,  that  point  is  wholly \nirrelevant  to  this  case. \na)  The  fact  that  employment  policies  such  as  the \n\"Fetal  Protection  Policy\"  are  matters  which  are  subject  to \ncollective  bargaining  within  the  framework  of  the  NLRA  (Resp. \nBr.  37-38)  in  no  way  suggests  that  they  are  immune  from \nregulation  under  the  OSH  Act.  This  Court  rejected  that  very \ncontention  in  United  Steelworkers  of  America  v.  Marshall,  647 \nF.2d  1189,  1237  (1980),  cert.  denied,  453  u.s.  913  (1981): \n[The  policy  in  question]  is  no  doubt  a \nmandatory  subject  of  bargaining,  but  so  is \nany  issue  directly  related  to  worker  safety. \nNLRB  v.  Gulf  Power  Co.,  384  F.2d  822,  824-825 \n(5th  Cir.  1967).  In  passing  a  massive  worker \nhealth  and  safety  statute,  Congress  certainly \nknew  it was  laying  a  basis  for  agency \nregulations  that  would  replace  or  obviate \nworker  safety  provisions  of  many  collective \nbargaining  agreements.  Congress  may  well \nhave  viewed  collective  bargaining  agreements \nalong  with  state  worker's  compensation  laws \nas  part  of  the  status  quo  that  had  failed  to \nprovide  workers  sufficient  protection. \n\n- 15  -\n*  *  *  * \n[W]e  find  nothing  in  the  OSH  Act  or  other \nlabor  legislation  to  suggest  that  Congress \ncould  remove  from  OSHA  the  power  to  create \na  program  instrumental  to  achieving  worker \nsafety  simply  because  such  a  program  could \notherwise  be  created  through  collective \nbargaining.l9 \n19  Cyanamid  asserts  that  OCAW,  \"[a]lthough  fully  informed  of \nevery  development  in  the  implementation  of  the  Fetus  Protection \nPolicy  from  January  1978  onward  ••• ,  raised  no  objection  to  the  ' \npolicy  until  after  the  October  2  transfer  of  •••  two  employees \n[who  had  not  undergone  the  required  sterilization],\"  at  which \npoint  OCAW  filed  a  grievance  asking,  inter  alia,  that  the  two \nemployees  be  restored  to  their  former  job  classifications. \nResp.  Br.  16.  From  this,  Cyanamid  draws  the  conclusion  \"that \nOCAW's  motivation  in  requesting  an  OSHA  inspection  was  to \nstrengthen  its  collective  bargaining  position  with  respect  to \nthe  labor-management  issues  of  mandatory  transfers,  possible \nwage  rate  reductions,  and  possible  layoffs.\"  Id.  at  17.  Such \nunfounded  speculation,  which  is  completely  false,  has  no  place \nin  this  proceeding.  Because  the  record  is  silent  with  respect  to \nOCAW's  response  to  the  Fetus  Protection  Policy  {apart  from \nOCAW's  participation  in  this  case)  we  will  not  follow  Cyanamid's \nlead  by  detailing  our  view  of  those  extra-record  events. \nSuffice  it to  say,  however,  that  beginning  in  March  1978  OCAW \nmade  repeated  requests  for  information  pertinent  to  the  Fetus \nProtection  Policy,  which  was  not  provided  by  Cyanamid  until \n1979,  after  an  NLRB  charge  had  been  filed.  There  is  no  truth  to \nthe  Company's  suggestion  that  the  union  acquiesced  in  the \nsterilization  rule.  And,  the  fact  that  OCAW  filed  a  grievance \ncontending  that  Cyanamid's  transfer  of  the  two  employees \nviolated  certain provisions  of  the  collective  bargaining \nagreement  that  govern  such  transfers  in  no  way  suggests  that \nOCAW's  concerns  were  limited  to  that  situation;  the  Court  can \nsee  for  itself  the  sincerity  of  OCAW's  position  in  this  case  by \nreviewing  the  record,  particularly  the  transcript  of  the \npre-hearing  conference  (JA  148-300). \nCyanamid  also  overreaches  by  asserting  that  the  Company  had \ndiscussed  the  Fetus  Protection  Policy  with  government  officials, \n\"who  made  no  statement  to  the  effect  that  the  Company  should  not \nimplement  its policy.\"  Resp.  Br.  15.  Despite  the  irrelevance \nof  that  assertion,  we  are  constrained  to  point  out  that  it has \nno  support  in  the  record.  Cyanamid  relies  exclusively  upon  a \nself-serving  letter  composed  by  its  attorneys  (see  Pet.  Br.  5, \nn.  7),  its  attorney's  assertions  at  the  pre-hearing  conference \n(JA  266),  and  one  of  its  requests  for  admissions  (JA  50-51) \n(request  #33).  What  Cyanamid  fails  to  disclose  is  that  the \nSecretary  objected  to  this  request  for  admissions  \"on  the \ngrounds  that  he  cannot  fairly  admit  the  request  without  material \nqualification  or  explanation\"  (JA  320). \n\n- 16  -\nb)  Nor  is  it relevant  that  the  Fetal  Protection \nPolicy  almost  certainly  violates  Title  VII.20  The  sex-\ndiscrimination  aspect  of  the  policy  is  not  what  this  proceeding \nseeks  to  redress;  rather,  this  proceeding  seeks  to  eliminate  a \npolicy  which  endangers  the  reproductive  capacity  of  employees  by \ncausing  them  to  undergo  surgical  sterilization.  In  all  respects \npertinent  here,  this  case  would  have  been  the  same  if  Cyanamid \n1 \nhad  required  men  as  well  as  women  to  undergo  sterilization.2\nIndeed,  the  case  would  have  been  the  same  if Cyanamid  had \nrequired  employees  to  undergo  chelation,  or  to  impair  the \nfunctional  capacity  of  some  part  of  their  bodies  other  than  the \nreproductive  system.  While  Cyanamid  repeatedly  describes  this \nas  a  sex  discrimination  case,  that  characterization  is merely  a \nsmokescreen  to  obscure  a  critical  flaw  in  its position;  for  what \nis  at  issue  in  this  proceeding  is  not  a  loss  of  employment,  but \na  loss  of  reproductive  capacity  on  the  part  of  five  employees, \nand  a  likelihood  that  other  employees  might  suffer  the  same  loss \nbecause  of  Cyanamid's  sterilization  rule. \nIn  any  event,  Cyanamid  never  explains  why  the  fact  that \nthe  Fetal  Protection  Policy  may  violate  Title  VII  is of  any \n20  See  Wright  v.  Olin  Corp.  30  FEP  Cases  889  (4th  Cir.  1982); \nZuniga  v.  Kleberg  County  Hospital,  30  FEP  Cases  650  (5th  Cir. \n1982). \n21  In  one  limited  respect,  however,  the  fact  that  Cyanamid \napplied  the  policy  only  to  women  might  prove  to  be  of \nevidentiary  significance  in  assessing  the  Company's  attempt  to \ndefend  the  policy  as  a  reasonable  and  necessary  means  of \nprotecting  fetuses.  See  note  30  infra. \n\n------\n----------------------------------------------~------\n- 17  -\n22 \npertinence  here , and  it plainly  is  not. \nSection  4 (b) (1)  of  the  OSH  Act  expressly defines  the \nlimited  circumstances  in  which  the  authority  exercised  by  other \nagencies  under  other  statutes may  limit  the  application  of  the \nOSH  Act  to  an  occupational  hazard;  it provides  that  the  Act  does \nnot  apply  to  \"working  conditions  of  employees  with  respect  to \nwhich  other  Federal  agencies  •••  exercise  statutory  authority  to \nprescribe  or  enforce  standards  or  regulations  affecting \noccupational  safety  or  health.\"  29  u.s.c.  §  653 (b)  (1).  Under \nthat  provision,  application  of  the  OSH  Act  is  foreclosed  only \nwhere  an  agency  has  actually  exercised  its authority  to \n23 \npromulgate  regulations, and  the  regulations  are  issued \n\"pursuant  to  enabling  legislation  the  purpose  of  which  was  to \n24 \naffect  occupational  safety  and  health.\"\n22  As  before  (note  19  supra),  Cyanamid  attempts,  without  any \nbasis,  to  suggest  that  OCAW  has  pursued  this  case  for  an \nulterior  purpose,  i.e.,  to  remedy  sex  discrimination.  See  Resp. \nBr.  36,  42.  Yet,  as  Cyanamid  is  forced  to  acknowledge,  OCAW \nmade  clear  in  the  administrative  proceedings  that  it would  not \nhave  invoked  OSHA's  jurisdiction  to  challenge  the  \"Fetus \nProtection  Policy\"  if  this  case  had  merely  involved  an \nexclusionary  policy,  rather  than  one  which  has  a  severe  impact \non  the  physical  integrity  of  employees.

The  Equal \nEmployment  Opportunity  Commission,  which  administers  Title  VII, \nhas  not  issued  any  regulations  concerning  reproductive \nhazards;25  and  in  any  event,  Title VII  does  not  authorize \nEEOC  to  issue  regulations  for  the  purpose  of  protecting \noccupational  safety  and  health.  Consequently,  as  EEOC  itself \nhas  recognized,  \"[t]he  task  of  assuring  a  workplace  free  of \nconditions  that  threaten  the  health  or  safety  of  employees \nremains  with  the  federal  agencies  specifically  granted  that \n26 \nresponsibility.\"\n25  As  Cyanamid  notes,  EEOC  at  one  point  issued  proposed \nguidelines  on  \"employment  discrimination  and  reproductive \nhazards,\"  but  the  agency  subsequently  withdrew  the  guidelines. \nResp.  Br.  41,  n.  53.  In  any  event,  the  proposed  guidelines \ndealt  only  with  the  question  whether  a  practice  of  excluding \nwomen  from  employment  can  be  justified  under  Title  VII  as \nnondiscriminatory  if  the  purpose  of  the  exclusion  is  to  protect \nhealth.  The  guidelines  did  not  speak  to  the  issue  whether  an \nemployer  may  lawfully cause  employees  to  undergo  surgical \nsterilization.  See  JA  495-498.  Indeed,  the  introduction  to \nthe  proposed  guidelines  stated: \nIt  is  recognized  that  the  concerns  of  the \nenforcement  agencies  with  respect  to  non \ndiscrimination  in  employment  are  .•• \ndistinct from  the  concerns  of  agencies \nresponsible  for  health  and  safety  regulation; \nthese  guidelines  preserve  those  distinc \ntions. \n*  *  *  * \n[T]he  proposed  guidelines  do  not  attempt  to \nimplement  or  enforce  federal  policies  related \nto  health  and  safety  ••••  The  task  of \nassuring  a  workplace  free  of  conditions  that \nthreaten  the  health  or  safety  of  employees \nremains  with  the  federal  agencies \nspecifically  granted  that  responsibility.

See  note  25 \nsupra. \n\n-----\n------------------~------ -\n- 19  -\nTitle  VII  therefore  does  not  limit  the  application  of  the \nOSH  Act  in  this  case,  and  the  fact  that  Cyanamid  may  well  have \nviolated  both  statutes  simply  means  that  the  Company  should  be \nbrought  to  account  for  both  aspects  of  its  unlawful  conduct, \nnot  that  it should  somehow  be  immune  from  citation  under  the \nOSH  Act. \nIII.  THERE  IS  NO  MERIT  TO  CYANAMID'S  ALTERNATIVE \nCLAIM  THAT  IT  IS  ENTITLED  TO  SUMMARY  JUDGMENT \nBECAUSE  THE  STERILIZATION  POLICY \nWAS  A  NECESSARY  MEANS  OF  PROTECTING  FETUSES. \nCyanamid  also  argues  at  length  that  its  sterilization  rule \ncannot  be  cited  as  a  violation  of  the  Act  because  the  rule  is \npart  of  a  \"Fetal  Protection  Policy\"  which  the  Company  states \nwas  adopted  for  the  purpose  of  protecting  fetuses  from  exposure \nto  lead.  Resp.  Br.  43-50. \nAs  we  explained  in  our  opening  brief,  the  Commission  did \nnot  reach  -- let  alone  accept  -- Cyanamid's  claim  that  the \nsterilization  rule  was  a  necessary  means  of  protecting \nfetuses.  Accordingly,  this  Court  should  not  entertain  that \nclaim.  But  even  if  the  claim  were  properly  before  the  court, \nthe  present  posture  of  this  case  is  such  that  summary  judgment \ncould  not  be  granted  in  favor  of  Cyanamid  on  this  basis. \nAlthough  the  Act  recognizes  a  \"greater  hazard\"  defense  in \n2\ncertain  limited  circumstances, 7  the  record  in  this  case \ncertainly  does  not  contain  undisputed  evidence  establishing \nthat  defense.  To  the  contrary,  as  we  show  at  21-26  infra,  the \nmaterial  in  the  record  on  which  Cyanamid  relies  lends  no \n27  See  cases  cited  in  Pet.  Br.  38-39. \n\n-----\n--------------------------------------------------------~-------\n- 20  -\nsupport  to  its position.  What  is  more,  OCAW  and  the  Secretary \noffered  in  the  Commission  proceedings  to  present  evidence  to \nestablish  that  Cyanamid  could  have  provided  protection  to \nfetuses  without  requiring  the  surgical  sterilization of \nemployees,  and  they  sought  discovery  to  refute  Cyanamid's \nopposing  contentions  (see  Pet.  Br.  13,  40-41).  But  because  the \nALJ,  at  Cyanamid's  urging,  disposed  of  the  case  by  adopting  the \nthreshold  position  that  the  sterilization  rule  was  not  a  hazard  ' \ncognizable  under  the  Act,  a  factual  record  was  not  made  on  this \nseriously  disputed  point. \nNevertheless,  Cyanamid  persists  in  trying  to  establish \nthat  no  feasible  alternatives  to  the  sterilization  rule  were \navailable.  Resp.  Br.  10-14,  48.  But  the  Company's  effort  only \nsucceeds  in  demonstrating  that  summary  judgment  could  not \nconceivably  be  granted  in  its  favor  on  this  matter,  and  indeed, \nthat  Cyanamid  is  almost  certain  not  to  prevail  on  this  defense \nwhen  the  relevant  evidence  is  adduced.28  For,  not  only  does \n28  To  deflect  attention  from  the  obvious  weakness  of  its \nposition,  Cyanamid  resorts  to  a  sleight  of  hand.  Arguing  from \nthe  premise  that  the  hazard  alleged  in  the  citation was  \"the \nrisk  of  harm  that  lead  poses  to  the  fetus,\"  Cyanamid  advances  a \nnumber  of  arguments  why  it would  be  impermissible  for  OSHA  to \nseek  to  specify  what  steps  the  Company  should  take  to  abate  that \nha~ard.  Resp.  Br.  48-50.  But  this  effort  to  avoid  the  issue \ncannot  succeed.  In  this  proceeding  Cyanamid  was  cited  for \nsubjecting  female  employees  to  surgical  sterilization,  not  for \nsubjecting  fetuses  to  lead.  Cyanamid  seeks  to  introduce  the \nissue  of  possible  risks  to  fetuses,  to  justify  its policy  of \ncausing  employees  to  undergo  impairment  of  their  reproductive \ncapacity.  If  Cyanamid  could  have  protected  fetuses  without \ncausing  employees  to  be  surgically  sterilized,  the  Company's \nasserted  justification fails.  Cyanamid  therefore  cannot \nforeclose  consideration  of  the  issue  whether  alternatives  to  the \nsterilization  rule  could  have  been  devised,  unless  the  Company \nis  willing  to  abandon  its  \"greater  hazard\"  defense. \n\n-- ------- ---------~----\n- 21  -\nCyanamid  rely  almost  exclusively  on  material  from  other \nproceedings,  which  cannot  properly  be  considered  here,  but  in \naddition,  that  material  actually  shows  the  Company's  position  to \nbe  untenable. \nThe  clearest  illustration of  this  point  is  that  although \nCyanamid  cites  extensively  to  snippets  of  testimony  from  the \ninformal  rulemaking  hearing  on  the  OSHA  Lead  Standard  and \nselected  statements  from  the  preamble  to  that  standard,  in \nreviewing  that  rulemaking  record  both  OSHA  and  this  Court \nsquarely  rejected  the  position  Cyanamid  now  advances.  As  this \nCourt  stated: \nLIA  (Lead  Industries  Association] \ncontended  .  •  •  that  precisely  because \nfertile  women  require  such  low  blood-lead \nlevels  [to  protect  the  fetus],  no  feasible \nlead  standard  could  possibly  protect \nthem •••• \n*  *  *  * \n(But]  ••• OSHA  decided  that  a  level  of  40 \nug/lOOg  would  be  sufficiently  protective, \nconcluding  that  other  protective  measures  in \nthe  lead  standard  would  compensate  for  any \nharm.  •  •  •  These  include  the  30  ugjlOOg \naction  level,  education  and  training  of \nworkers  planning  families,  careful  use  of \nmedical  surveillance,  and  the  possibility  of \nspecial  precautions  -- even  respirators  - \nunder  the  medical  examination  provisions  of \nthe  medical  removal  program.  •  •  • \nLIA  had  essentially  argued  that  ••• \nthe  only  feasible  means  of  protecting  fertile \nwomen  was  to  exclude  them  from  the  workplace \nor  to  counsel  them  out  on  a  case-by-case \nbasis.  •  •  •  OSHA  has  advanced  substantial \nevidence  to  show  that  its  goal  of  40  ugjlOOg \n-- the  same  level  which  it presents  as  a \nfeasible  and  necessary  one  to  prevent  the \nother  health  effects  of  lead  -- can  in  fact \nprotect  women  from  reproductive  harm •••• \n\n- 22  -\nUnited  Steelworkers  of  American  v.  Marshall ,  supra,  647  F.2d  at \n1256-57.29 \n29  Citing  the  preamble  to  the  Lead  Standard,  Cyanamid \nnevertheless  asserts  that  OSHA  actually  \"concluded  that \nexclusion  [of  fertile  women]  may  be  necessary.\"  Resp.  Br.  14, \nn.  26.  But  a  reading  of  the  complete  passage  in  question, \nwhich  we  quote  below,  will  dispel  any  notion  that  OSHA  was \nadopting  Cyanamid's  view  that  there  is  no  way  to  protect  the \nfetus  from  excessive  exposure  to  lead  other  than  broad-scale \nexclusion  or  sterilization of  fertile  female  employees: \nIn addition,  temporary  medical  removal \nmay  in  particular  cases  be  needed  for  some \nworkers  desiring  to  parent  a  child  in  the \nnear  future. \n*  *  *  * \nInstead  of  providing  an  automatic  transfer \nopportunity,  OSHA  has  determined  that  ques \ntions  concerning  reproduction  can  best  be \naddressed  first  by  primary  control  measures \nprotective  of  reproductive  capability  ••• , \nand  second,  by  the  flexibility  and  informed \nmedical  judgment  which  will  result  from  the \nmedical  surveillance  and  MRP  provisions  of \nthe  standard.  Where  medically  indicated, \ntemporary  removal  of  workers  intending  to \nparent  can  be  provided  pursuant  to  a  medical \ndetermination.  Temporary  removal  is  only  one \nof  several  alternatives,  however.  For \nexample,  a  physician  might  first  recommend \nthat  a  particular  employee  be  provided  with  a \npowered  air  purifying  respirator  to  use \nseveral  hours  each  day,  even  though  the \nworker  would  otherwise  have  no  opportunity \nunder  the  standard  to  obtain  this  form  of \nrespirator.  If  this  respirator  usage  proved \ninadequate,  the  physician  could  later  recom \nmend  complete  removal  of  the  worker  from  lead \nexposure. \n(Continued) \n\n.----. \n-------------~------ ----;---- -- -~ \n- 23  -\nThus,  what  Cyanamid  asks  this  Court  now  to  accept  as  an \nincontestable  fact  was  squarely  rejected  by  this  Court  in  the \nvery  proceeding  upon  which  Cyanamid  relies.30  As  this  point \ndemonstrates,  Cyanamid's  claim  that  its  sterilization \n29  (continued) \nThe  preceding  use  of  special  protective \nmeasures  or  temporary  medical  removals  for \nthose  intending  to  parent  equally  applies  to \npregnant  employees.  The  preamble's  discus \nsion  of  lead's  effects  on  the  reproductive \nsystem  indicates  that  in  many  cases  it would \nbe  unacceptable  for  a  pregnant  employee \nhaving  an  elevated  blood  lead  level  to  con \ntinue  to  experience  substantial  lead  exposure \nduring  the  pregnancy.  If  the  employee's \nblood  lead  level  were  only  slightly  elevated, \nand  the  employee's  normal  lead  exposure  were \nlow  or  moderate,  then  removal  of  the  employee \nmight  not  be  essential  -- perhaps  the  provi \nsion  of  a  powered  air  purifying  respirator \nwould  afford  adequate  protection  to  both  the \nmother  and  the  fetus.  In  other  cases, \nphysical  removal  of  the  employee  from  all \nsignificant  lead  exposure  might  be  imperative \ndue  to  such  factors  as  (1)  the  employee's \nblood  lead  level,  ( 2)  the  extent  of  the \nemployee's  prior  exposure  to  lead,  ( 3)  the \nnature  of  the  employee's  present  exposure  to \nlead,  or  (4)  the  lack  of  other  protective \nalternatives.  As  with  other  medical  condi \ntions,  the  nature  of  special  protective \nmeasures  which  should  be  provided  to  pregnant \nemployees  will  depend  on  the  circumstances  of \neach  case.  [43  Fed.  Reg.  54462  (Nov.  21, \n1978) 0] \n30  Although  it is  sufficient  to  note  that  this  Court  has \nrejected  Cyanamid's  ultimate  conclusion-- i.e.,  that  fetuses \ncan  be  protected  from  excessive  exposure  to  lead  only  by \nexcluding  fertile  women  or  by  rendering  them  infertile  -- we \nnote  in  passing  that  each  of  the  underlying  points  advanced  by \nthe  Company  in  support  of  that  conclusion  is  at  best  disputed, \nand  at  worst  plainly  wrong. \n(Continued) \n\n- 24  -\npolicy  was  the  only  possible  means  of  protecting  fetuses  from \nexposure  to  lead  may  well  be  disingenuous.  The  reality,  as \nOCAW  offered  to  prove,  is  that  Cyanamid  simply  \"chose  the  easy \nway  out\"  of  dealing  with  this  situation  (JA  229  (statement  of \nOCAW  representative  Steven  Wodka) ).  The  Company's  decision  is \n30  (Continued) \nThus,  Cyanamid  first  states  that  adequate  reductions  in \nambient  air  lead  levels  at  the  Willow  Island  plant  were  not \nfeasible.  Resp.  Br.  10.  To  support  that  assertion,  the \nCompany  cites  a  finding  by  an  administrative  law  judge  in \nanother  proceeding  which  is  presently  under  review  by  the \nCommission,  and  as  to  which  no  final  Commission  order  has \nissued.  Id.  at  10,  n.  18.  Obviously,  Cyanamid  cannot  put \nforward  the  ALJ's  finding  -- which  has  been  strongly  challenged \non  review  -- as  an  undisputed  fact.  Cyanamid  also  emphasizes \nthat  OSHA  has  not  yet  determined  whether  an  ambient  air  lead \nlevel  of  50  ugjm3  is  feasible  for  the  pigment  manufacturing \nindustry  as  a  whole.  Id.  at  11,  n.  18.  But  that  says  nothing \nas  to  what  level  could~ave been  achieved  at  Willow  Island. \nThe  simple  fact  is  that  the  record  in  this  case  conta1ns  no \nevidence  concerning  the  feasibility  of  reducing  lead  levels  at \nWillow  Island.  To  suggest  that  the  point  is  beyond  dispute  is \nabsurd. \n· Cyanamid  next  states  that  respirators  could  not  have \nplayed  any  part  in  protecting  fetuses  from  excessive  exposure \nto  lead,  because  OSHA  stated  in  the  preamble  to  the  Lead \nStandard  that  respirators  are  unacceptable.  Id.  at  11.  But \nOSHA  merely  stated  that  respirators  are  unacceptable  as  a \nsubstitute  for  engineering  controls.  As  this  Court  has- \nrecognized,  OSHA  properly  concluded  that  respirators  could  play \na  valuable  role  in  a  program  designed  to  protect  the  fetus  from \nexcessive  exposure  to  lead.  Steelworkers,  supra,  647  F.2d  at \n1257.  Cyanamid  further  asserts,  however,  that  it \"already  had \na  respiratory  protection  program  in  effect  in  the  Inorganic \nPigments  Department  that  adequately  protected  adults,  but  the \nprogram  had  proven  unable  to  protect  the  fetus  by  reducing \nblood  lead  levels  to  30  ugjlOOg.\"  Resp.  Br.  12,  n.  19.  Once \nagain,  there  is  nothing  in  the  record  with  respect  to  any \n\"respiratory  protection  program\"  at Willow  Island.  A  proper \nrespiratory  protection program  requires  \"strict rules  on \nselecting,  fitting,  and  testing\"  (Steelworkers,  supra  at  1205 \n(describing  OSHA  Lead  Standard));  the  record  is  silent  as  to \nwhether  Cyanamid  had  such  a  program. \n(Continued) \n\n- 25  -\ndesigned  to  protect  fetuses  at  all costs  -- even  at  the  cost  of \nthe  reproductive  capacity  of  its employees  -- perhaps  because \nof  the  Company's  fear  of  potential  liability to  fetuses \n30  (Continued) \nCyanamid  next  asserts  that medical  surveillance  could  not \nassist  in  protecting  fetuses,  citing  a  statement  by  OSHA  in  the \npreamble  to  the  Lead  Standard.  Resp.  Br.  12  and  n.  20.  Just \nas  in  the  case  of  respirators,  the  statement  cited  by  Cyanamid \nmerely  indicates  that medical  surveillance  is  not  an  adequate \nsubstitute  for  engineering  controls;  and  once  again,  this  Court \nexpressly  upheld  OSHA's  determination  that  \"careful  use  of \nmedical  surveillance\"  could  play  a  part  in  protecting  fetuses \nfrom  excessive  exposure  to  lead.  Steelworkers,  supra,  647  F.2d \nat  1257. \nFinally,  Cyanamid  rejects  any  approach  under  which  \"the \nfamily  planning  practices  of  individual  employees\"  would  be \ntaken  into  account  in  a  fetal  protection program,  on  the  ground \nthat  this  \"would  have  been  an  unwarranted  invasion  of  the \nlegitimate  privacy  interests  of  workers.\"  Resp.  Br.  12.  But \nthat  principle  simply  renders  the  Company's  sterilization \npolicy  all  the  more  indefensible.  For  the  sterilization policy \ninvolves  an  extreme  intrusion  into  the  privacy  of  employees. \nAs  the  Company's  Director  of  Industrial  Relations  so  delicately \nput  it,  in  announcing  the  sterilization  rule  to  female \nemployees: \nThe  Company  realizes  that  it is  a  very \npersonal  and  private matter  whether  or  not  a \nwoman  cannot  become  pregnant  because  of \nsurgical  procedures.  It must  be  pointed  out, \nhowever,  that  this  very  personal  matter  will \nno  longer  be  private  if you  are  permitted, \nand  choose,  to  remain  in  one  of  the \nDepartments  [where  the  sterilization  rule \nwould  apply]\"  (JA  446). \nOne  further  factual  matter  warrants  mention.  As  noted  in \nour  opening  brief,  the  justification asserted  by  Cyanamid  for \nits sterilization policy  is  further  clouded  because  OSHA  has \nfound  that  exposure  of  males  to  lead  can  affect  the  sperm  in \nsuch  a  way  as  to  cause  harm  to  offspring,  yet  Cyanamid's  policy \napplies  only  to  women.  (Pet.  Br.  41,  n.  97.)  Cyanamid  attacks \nthis  contention,  asserting  that  in  the  hearing  on  the  Lead \nStandard,  no  evidence  was  adduced  to  support  the  proposition \nthat  lead  can  cause  birth  defects  by  harming  the  sperm • . \n(Continued) \n\n- 26  -\nwhich  \"cannot  be  discharged  through  operation  of  the  assumption \nof  risk  doctrine.\"  Resp.  Br.  13.  Cyanamid  apparently  hoped \nthat  by  the  expedient  of  the  sterilization  rule  it could  avoid \nany  potential  liability  to  fetuses,  without  being  made  to \nanswer  for  the  physical  harm  caused  to  employees.  From  all \n30  (Continued) \nOnce  again,  Cyanamid  has  failed  to  review  this  Court's  decision \nin  Steelworkers,  supra,  647  F.2d  at  1257: \nOSHA  found  evidence  that  lead-exposed  males \nsuffer  serious  harm  to  their  spermatogenesis, \nincluding  malformed  sperm.  •  •  •  The  chief \nstudy  was  that  of  the  European  neuro \nendocrinologist  Dr.  Lancranjan,  whose  work \nrevealed  adverse  effects  of  spermatogenesis \namong  lead-exposed  workers  with  blood-lead \nlevels  as  low  as  41  ug/lOOg. \n*  *  *  * \nDr.  Lancranjan's  work  found  some  confirmation \nin  a  Mt.  Sinai  survey  of  153  lead  smelter \nworkers,  which  revealed  unusually  high  rates \nof  fetal  and  newborn  mortality  in  the \nchildren  of  these  men.  .  •  •  ,Older  studies \nfound  alarmingly  high  rates  of  spontaneous \nabortion,  miscarriage,  stillbirth,  and  birth \ndefects  in  the  pregnancies  of  women  married \nto  lead-exposed  workers.  •  •  •  Other  studies \nfound  serious  chromosomal  abnormalities  among \nlead-exposed  workers •••• \nOSHA  thus  found  abundant  support  for  the \nview  expressed  by  experts  from  NIOSH  and  the \nAmerican  Health  Foundation  that  a  lead \nstandard  must  protect  the  reproductive \ncapacities  of  males  as  well  as  females. \n*  *  *  * \nLIA  had  essentially  argued  that  only  the \nreproductive  functions  of  women  were \nthreatened  at  low  blood-lead  levels .• \nOSHA  has  advanced  substantial  evidence  to \nshow  •  •  •  that men  require  similar \nprotection. \n\n------------------~------ -- --\n- 27  -\nthat  appears,  this consideration  -- rather  than  the  purported \nunavoidability  of  the  sterilization  rule  -- may  explain  the \nadoption  of  the  rule. \nWe  are  thus  hard-pressed  to  comprehend  how  the  facts  in \nthis  case  could  ever  support  Cyanamid's  contention  that  the \nsterilization policy  is  statutorily protected  because  of  its \nalleged  benefits  to  potential  fetuses.  But  at  the  very  least, \nthe  record  in  this  case  could  not  possibly  support  a  grant  of \nsummary  judgment  in  favor  of  Cyanamid  on  the  issue. \nThe  Commission  did  not  purport  to  resolve  this disputed \nissue  in  Cyanamid's  favor.  Neither  should  the  Court. \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  reasons  stated  above  and  in  OCAW's  opening  brief, \nthe  petition  for  review  should  be  granted,  the  Commission's \norder  should  be  set  aside,  and  the  case  should  be  remanded  for \nfurther  proceedings. \nRespectfully  submitted, \n/ \n) \nGEORGE  H.

acknowledge Kathi Kaltenbach, IT Project Manager for \nthe St. Louis County Family Court, and Rick McElfresh, Research Supervisor for the Office of \nState Courts Administrator. Kathi generously shared her time and expertise in the development \nof numerous Cognos reports used to extract most of the required data elements for this report. \nRick has provided invaluable insights into the juvenile justice process in Missouri over the years, \nand his ability to field what must seem like endless questions is monumental. \n   \n7 \n \n\n \nExecutive Summary \n \n  This first bi-annual report provides a preliminary examination of data to address \nconcerns about potential Disproportionate Minority Contact (DMC) experienced by black youth \nat the decision points of: informal adjustment, pre-adjudication secure detention, petition, \nadjudication, formal disposition (for those cases that result in commitment to the Department \nof Youth Services), and certification. The report also includes data about attorney \nrepresentation of youth. \n \nInformally Resolved Referrals \n  The first section concerns referrals that were handled informally through various means \nwithout the formal filing of charges. The main findings include: \n \n  The majority of informally resolved referrals were referrals of male youth and black \nyouth. \n  While the majority of youth only received one referral during the reporting period, black \nyouth and male youth were more likely to have received more than one referral during \nthe reporting period, and they were also more likely to have received one or more \nreferrals prior to the reporting period. \n  Black youth and male youth were also more likely to be younger at the time of informal \ndisposition of their referrals. \n  A statistically significant relationship was found between race and certain types of \ndisposition. Black youth were more likely to have been “counseled and warned”, while \nwhite youth were more likely to have received a “warning letter” and to have entered \ninto an informal adjustment contract. Among those white and black youth who were \nplaced on informal adjustment, black youth were more likely to have been placed on \nsupervision. \n  Most of the informally handled referrals were referrals for allegations of misdemeanors. \nThere was a statistically significant relationship between race and certain charge \ncategories. Black youth were more likely to have been charged for “Misdemeanor \nAssault”, “Felony Theft”, and “Burglary”, while white youth were more likely to have \nbeen charged with “Misdemeanor Drug Offense” and “Liquor & Tobacco Offense”. \n \nDetention Screening \n  The second section concerns data about the use of the Missouri Juvenile Detention \nAssessment (JDTA) to screen referrals. The main findings include: \n \n  A majority of the JDTAs were for referrals of male youth and black youth. \n  Most of the total decisions to detain were made on the basis of the indicated decision \non the Missouri Juvenile Detention Assessment (JDTA), but 4.3% of the total decisions to \ndetain were made on the basis of overrides up to detention. \n8 \n \n\n  All of the total decisions to assign youth to alternative programs were made on the \nbasis of accepting the indicated decision on the JDTA. \n  Most of the total decisions to release youth were made on the basis of the JDTA, but \n13.0% of the total decisions to release youth were made on the basis of overrides down \nto release. \n  Youth were sometimes screened more than once for detention. One hundred eighty six \nyouth accounted for 214 referrals that were screened using the JDTA. The vast majority \nof the duplication was in referrals that scored detention on the JDTA. \n  The most common reporting reason for detention indicated on the JDTA for which the \ndecision to detain was made was “Felony – Person”, followed closely by “Felony – \nProperty” and “Supervision/Technical Violation, JO Authorization, or Court Order”. \n  The most common reporting reason for detention indicated on the JDTA for referrals for \nwhich the decision to assign youth to an alternative was made were “Misdemeanor – \nPerson” and “Misdemeanor – Property”, in that order. “Drug Offense” and “Felony – \nProperty” were tied for third among referrals assigned to alternative. \n  The most common reporting reason for detention indicated on the JDTA for referrals for \nwhich the decision to release youth was made were “Misdemeanor – Property” and \n“Misdemeanor – Person”. \n \nPre-Adjudication Detention Admissions \n  The third section concerns data about pre-adjudication, secure detention admissions. \nThe main findings include: \n \n  Most of the pre-adjudication, secure detention admissions were for referrals of male \nyouth and black youth. \n  A statistically significant relationship was found between race and detention admission. \nBlack youth were more likely to be admitted for detention. \n  Ninety nine youth accounted for 110 secure detention admissions. One white youth was \nadmitted twice during the reporting period, so black youth accounted for most of the \nmultiple detention stays. \n  The majority of detention admissions during the reporting period were for referrals of \nyouth aged 15 or 16. White youth as young as 13 were admitted, while black youth as \nyoung as 12 were admitted. There was no statistically significant relationship between \nage and admission, indicating that other factors influenced admission. \n  Consistent with the reason reporting codes indicated on the JDTA, a majority of the \nsecure, pre-adjudication detention admissions were for referrals with a felony \nallegation, followed by “Violation of Valid Court Order”.  statistical test actually showed \nno relationship between charge level (defined as “Felony” versus “No Felony”) and \nadmission. \n \n9 \n \n\nAlternatives to Detention \n  The fourth section concerned referrals assigned to alternatives, both those that were \nplaced on an alternative in lieu of being detained and those that were admitted for detention \nbefore being moved to an alternative program. The main findings include: \n \n  Fifty eight delinquency referrals were assigned to alternative programs. Twenty three \nreferrals were assigned to an alternative in lieu of being detained, while 58 referrals \nwere admitted to detention before being moved to an alternative program. Most in \nboth groups were male and black. \n  All but one of the referrals assigned to an alternative in lieu of detention were given \n“Conditional Release”. Most of these referrals were referrals of black youth. \n  The most common alternative utilized after detention admission was “Global Positioning \nProgram”, followed by “Drug/Alcohol Treatment”, and “In Home Detention”. The \nreferrals assigned to “Drug/Alcohol Treatment” were split across white and black youth, \nwhile most of the referrals assigned to the other two programs (“GPS” and “In Home \nDetention”) were referrals of black youth. \n \nPetition of Delinquency Referrals \n  The fifth section concerns data on petitions of delinquency referrals. The main findings \ninclude: \n \n  A majority of referrals petitioned were referrals of male youth and referrals of black \nyouth. \n  A statistically significant relationship was found between race and petition. Black youth \nwere more likely to be petitioned. \n  One hundred eighty six youth accounted for 276 referrals petitioned during the \nreporting period. While the majority of youth had only one referral within this time, \nblack youth and male youth whose referrals were petitioned were more likely to have \nreceived more than one referral during the reporting period. \n  A majority of youth who received referrals that were petitioned had received five or \nmore prior referrals. \n  The majority of petitions were for referrals of youth aged 15 or 16. Black youth were \nsomewhat more likely to be younger at the time of petition than white youth. \n  Referrals petitioned included more serious allegations than those informally resolved. \nThe most common charge types on referrals petitioned had allegations in the “All Other \nJuvenile” category (with the charges “Failure to Appear – Misdemeanor” and “Violation \nof Valid Court Order”). Next most common were those in the category of “Felony Theft”. \nDue to the small frequencies of referrals petitioned in each charge category, no \nstatistical relationship between race and petition could be identified when considering \ncharge category. \n \n10 \n \n\nDelinquency Referrals Dismissed for Informal Adjustment \n  The sixth section concerns data on delinquency referrals dismissed for informal \nadjustment. The main findings include: \n \n  The majority of referrals dismissed for informal adjustment were referrals of male youth \nand referrals of black youth. \n  Consistent with other referral patterns, most of the referrals resolved informally after \ndismissal were referrals of youth aged 15-16. \n  The range of charge categories for referrals resolved informally after dismissal is similar \nto that of other informally resolved referrals: mostly person and property offenses. The \ntwenty-four referrals were evenly split between felonies and misdemeanors. \n \nFindings of Delinquency \n  The seventh section concerns data on cases in which youth were found delinquent. The \nmain findings include: \n \n  A majority of cases in which the Court found charges of delinquency to be true were \ncases involving black youth. \n  A statistically significant relationship was found between race and adjudicating a youth \ndelinquent. White youth were more likely to be adjudicated delinquent. \n  The majority of findings of delinquency involved youth aged 15 or 16. Black youth were \nsomewhat more likely to be younger at the time of adjudication than white youth. \n  Most of the charges for which finding of delinquency was made were property offenses, \nwith “Robbery”, “Misdemeanor Theft”, and “Felony Theft” being the most common \ncharge categories. “The next most common charge category after those was \n“Misdemeanor Assault”. \n \nInitial Disposition is Commitment to DYS \n  The eighth section concerns data on delinquency cases for which the initial disposition \nwas commitment to the Department of Youth Services. The main findings include: \n \n  There were only five delinquency cases for which the initial disposition was commitment \nto DYS. All involved male youth. One involved a white youth, while the other four were \nblack youth. \n  All but one of the cases involved youth aged 15 or 16. The other youth was 13 years old \nat the time of commitment. \n  One of the ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) in which the mailing addresses of youth \ncommitted to DYS were located was an area with a very high concentration (greater \nthan 70%) of black, non-Hispanic residents. \n  The mailing addresses of youth committed to DYS during the reporting period were \nconcentrated in north St. Louis County. \n  Two of the ZCTAs in which the mailing addresses of youth committed to DYS were \nlocated were areas that would be considered “poverty areas” by the U.S. Census \n11 \n \n\nBureau, with 20% or more of the total population below the poverty threshold in those \nareas. \n  All allegations were felonies, ranging from felony A to felony B. All youth committed to \nDYS were charged within the category of “Robbery”: “Robbery 1st Degree” or “Robbery \n2nd Degree”. \n \nDYS Commitment Due to Violation of Valid Court Order \n  The ninth section concerns data about cases committed to DYS due to an allegation of \nViolation of Valid Court Order (VVCO). The main findings include: \n \n  There were three cases for which the initial disposition was to make the youth a ward of \nthe state but in which the youth was later committed to DYS for VVCO. One of those \ncommitments was for a case involving a black female youth, while the other two were \nfor cases involving black male youth. \n  All of the cases disposed with DYS commitment for VVCO involved youth aged 16. \n  One of the ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) in which the mailing addresses of youth \ncommitted to DYS were located was an area with a very high concentration (greater \nthan 70%) of black, non-Hispanic residents. By contrast, one ZCTA had a very low \nconcentration of black, non-Hispanic residents. \n  The mailing addresses of youth committed to DYS for VVCO during the reporting period \nwere spread across St. Louis County. \n  One of the ZCTAs in which the mailing addresses of youth committed to DYS were \nlocated were areas that would be considered a “poverty area” by the U.S. Census \nBureau, with 20% or more of the total population below the poverty threshold in those \nareas. One of the ZCTAs had much less poverty than the other two. \n \nInitial Disposition of DYS Commitment is Suspended but Later Youth are Committed \n  The tenth section concerns data about cases for which the initial disposition to commit \nto DYS was suspended but in which the youth was later committed. The main findings include: \n \n  There were two cases committed to DYS after a conditional suspension of the order to \ncommit. One of those commitments was for a case involving a black female youth, while \nthe other was for a case involving a black male youth. \n  One involved a youth aged 16, while the other youth was 17 at the time of commitment. \n  In one case, the major allegation was for “Felony Theft”, while the other was for \n“Misdemeanor Theft”. \n  One of the ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) in which the mailing addresses of youth \ncommitted to DYS after conditional suspension were located was an area with a very \nhigh concentration (greater than 70%) of black, non-Hispanic residents. \n  One of the ZCTAs in which the mailing addresses of youth committed to DYS after \nconditional suspension were located were areas that would be considered a “poverty \narea” by the U.S. Census Bureau, with 20% or more of the total population below the \npoverty threshold in that area. \n12 \n \n\n \nCertifications \n  The eleventh section concerns data on cases that were certified to adult court. The main \nfindings include: \n \n  The Court certified eleven cases. All of the youth were male, and all but one of the \nyouth certified were black youth. \n  All youth were ages 16 or older at the time of certification. \n  Based on motions filed in the eleven cases, eight were considered mandatory under \nstatute, while three were considered to be discretionary. Six of the mandatory \ncertifications were due to an allegation that the youth committed one of the mandatory \nfelonies, while two were due to the allegation that the youth committed a third \nunrelated felony. \n  All allegations were felonies, ranging from felony A to unclassified felony. The single \nwhite youth certified was charged with “Felony Assault”. The remaining youth certified \nwere all black youth. They were charged within the following charge categories: \n“Murder”, “Forcible Rape”, “Robbery”, and “Burglary”. \n  Five of the ZCTAs in which the mailing addresses of youth certified were located were \nareas with very high concentrations (greater than 70%) of Black, non-Hispanic residents, \nwhile two were areas with very high concentrations of White, non-Hispanic residents. \n  The mailing addresses of youth certified during the reporting period were mostly \nconcentrated in north St. Louis County. \n  Six of the ZCTAs in which the mailing addresses of youth certified were located were \nareas that would be considered “poverty areas” by the U.S. Census Bureau, with 20% or \nmore of the total population below the poverty threshold in those areas. One ZCTA, \n63120, would be considered an area of highly concentrated poverty, with more than \n40% of the total population in poverty in 2015. \n \nAttorney Representation for Youth \n  The twelfth, and last, section concerns data on attorney representation for youth at \nhearings. The main finding was that: \n \n  Based on data extracted, attorneys represented youth at 96.9% of hearings. However, \nas indicated in endnote 75, court staff reviewed the legal files and determined that all \nyouth were represented, so a process is being implemented to address this data \ndiscrepancy for future reports. \n   \n13 \n \n\nIntroduction \n  The St. Louis Family Court entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (Agreement) with \nthe United States Department of Justice (DOJ) on Wednesday, December 14, 2016 to address \ndue process and equal protection concerns raised by the DOJ Civil Rights Division. In that \nAgreement (United States Department of Justice, 2016), the Court agreed to use the Justice \nInformation System (JIS) to collect data on sex, race, age, and offense information to inform a \nstatistical analysis of a number of juvenile justice decision points1 that would be produced by \nthe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention funded Disproportionate Minority \nContact (DMC) research analyst at the Office of State Courts Administrator. This document \nreports on this data for the period of 1/1/2017 to 6/30/2017. \n \n  The intention of this first bi-annual report is to provide a preliminary examination of \ndata to address concerns about potential Disproportionate Minority Contact (DMC) \nexperienced by black youth at the decision points of: informal adjustment, pre-adjudication \nsecure detention, petition, adjudication, formal disposition (for those cases that result in \ncommitment to the Department of Youth Services), and certification. All of the data concerns \nreferrals or cases in which at least one of the allegations was a delinquency charge. \n \n  Since the reporting period is short, the data available mostly lends itself to descriptive \nanalysis. Where possible, inferential statistics are used to examine patterns in the data. While \nthe report does present descriptive and inferential statistical findings that are suggestive of the \nexistence of Disproportionate Minority Contact at most of the decision points examined, it is \nimportant to understand that the preliminary nature of this data calls for caution in making \nassertions that findings that indicate that black youth are more likely to experience certain \noutcomes at these decision points are actually indicative of racial disparity, or unequal \ntreatment by the St. Louis Family Court, in addition to evidence of disproportionality, which \nrefers to a difference in the proportions of minority youth and white youth experiencing \ncontact at various stages of juvenile justice processing. Future reports will be better able to \nleverage advanced statistical analysis as additional data is added. This will include the use of \nlogistic regression, where appropriate, to identify if race remains as a factor in outcomes after \nappropriately controlling for other legal and extra-legal variables. \n   \n14 \n \n\nInformally Resolved Delinquency Referrals \n  The Memorandum of Agreement requires that the St. Louis Family Court “collect and \nmake available data showing whether a juvenile delinquency matter referred to the Court was \nresolved informally prior to the filing of a delinquency petition” (United States Department of \nJustice, 2016). This section focuses on data about referrals that were handled informally, \nwhether through informal adjustment or another fashion. To be clear, resolving a juvenile \ndelinquency matter informally may mean a number of things as long as a referral is prevented \nfrom proceeding to petition, or the filing of charges in a formal case. One of the primary means \nby which this happens is through the creation of an informal adjustment contract, which can \ninclude: \nthe giving of guidance and advice to a juvenile and the parents, guardian or \ncustodian of the juvenile by the juvenile officer and other persons, as \nappropriate [and may include], with the consent of the juvenile and of the \njuvenile's parent, guardian or custodian, supervision by the juvenile officer and \ntemporary placement of the juvenile with persons other than the juvenile's \nparent, guardian or custodian, as provided by law. Referrals may be made by the \njuvenile officer to public and private agencies that may provide beneficial \nguidance or services to the juvenile and the juvenile's parents, guardian or \ncustodian (McCarver, 2011). \nReferrals may also be resolved informally through the dismissal of referrals for insufficient \nevidence or for some other reason2. Last, it is also possible to transfer jurisdiction over a \nreferral to another juvenile court or agency3 4. \n \nSex and Race \n  Between 1/1/2017 and 6/30/2017, the St. Louis County Family Court informally \ndisposed 1,362 delinquency referrals5. As indicated by    \n15 \n \n\nTable 1, the majority, 66.9%, of referrals informally resolved were referrals of male youth, while \nthe remaining 33.0% were referrals of female youth. Black youth accounted for a majority, \n66.4%, of referrals informally resolved, while 30.7% were referrals of white youth, 1.7% were \nreferrals of Hispanic youth, 1.0% were referrals of Asian/Pacific Islander youth, and 0.1% were \nreferrals of Native American youth. Two referrals were missing “race”. These unknown race \nreferrals accounted for 0.1% of all referrals. These two informally resolved referrals without \nrace data are not reported in this section hereafter. \n   \n16 \n \n\nTable 1 Informal Disposition of Delinquency Referrals by Sex and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAsian / Pacific  Native  Grand \nSex  Unknown  White  Black  Hispanic \nIslander  American  Total \nFemale   \n           \nReferrals    127  317  3  1  1  449 \nPercentage of Total   \nReferrals  9.3 %  23.3 %  0.2 %  0.1 %  0.1 %  33.0 % \nMale   \n           \nReferrals  2  291  588  20  12  911 \n \nPercentage of Total \nReferrals  0.1 %  21.4 %  43.2 %  1.5 %  0.9 %  66.9 % \n \nTotal Referrals  2  418  905  23  13  1  1,362 \nTotal Percentage  0.1 %  30.7 %  66.4 %  1.7 %  1.0 %  0.1 %  100.0 % \n \nDistinct Count of Youth with Informally Resolved Referrals During the Reporting Period \n  A distinct count of youth with referrals disposed informally during the reporting period \nshows that 1,168 youth accounted for 1,360 referrals. This indicates that a portion of youth \nreferred actually received multiple referrals during the reporting period, though it does not \ndirectly indicate how many youth are actually duplicated in the 1,360 count, because, while \nmost youth would have received only one referral during that period, some youth may have \nreceived two referrals, while some may have received three referrals, and so on. To determine \nthe actual number of duplicated youth, it is necessary to count the number of youth by the \nnumber of referrals they received. This is reported in    \n17 \n \n\nTable 2. As shown in that table, the majority of youth (1,045, or 89.5% of the total youth) had \nonly one referral within that time period. Of the 1,045 youth with one referral, 372 were female \nyouth, and 673 were male youth. As might be expected, the next largest group was the 83 \nyouth who had two referrals during the reporting period. The number of youth with \nsuccessively more referrals declines as the number of subsequent referrals increases. \n \n   \n18 \n \n\nTable 2 Count of Youth by the Number of Informally Resolved \nDelinquency Referrals, Sex, and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAsian / Pacific  Native  Grand \nSex  White  Black  Hispanic \nIslander  American  Total \nFemale             \n1 Referral  118  249  3  1  1  372 \n2 Referrals  3  14  17 \n     \n3 Referrals  1  5  6 \n     \n4 Referrals  5  5 \n       \n5 Referrals  1  1 \n       \nMore Than 5 Referrals             \nSubtotal  122  274  3  1  1  401 \nMale \n           \n1 Referral  230  426  12  5  673 \n \n2 Referrals  17  47  2  66 \n   \n3 Referrals  4  10  1  15 \n   \n4 Referrals  2  5  1  1    9 \n5 Referrals  2  2 \n       \nMore Than 5 Referrals  1  1  2 \n     \nSubtotal  254  491  15  7  767 \n \nGrand Total  376  765  18  8  1  1,168 \n \n  Black youth and male youth were more likely to have received more than one referral \nduring the reporting period. While 11.8% of black youth (90 youth out of 765 black youth total) \nhad two or more referrals during the reporting period, only 7.4% of white youth (28 youth out \nof 376 white youth total) had two or more. Further, while 12.3% of male youth (94 youth out of \n767 male youth total) had two or more referrals during the reporting period, only 7.2% of \nfemale youth (29 youth out of 401 female youth total) had two or more. \n \nPrior Referrals \n  While the previous sub-section reported on the number of referrals youth received \nduring the reporting period, revealing that 10.5% of all youth had received more than one \nreferral during that time, this next sub-section reports on data about the number of referrals \nthat youth have ever received. As indicated by    \n19 \n \n\nTable 3, a plurality of the youth (656 youth or 48.2%) who received referrals that were \ninformally resolved had not received prior referrals6. Notably, black youth and male youth were \nmore likely to have received prior referrals. \n \n   \n20 \n \n\nTable 3 Count of Youth with Prior Referrals by the Number of Prior Referrals, Sex, and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAsian / Pacific  Native  Grand \nSex  White  Black  Hispanic \nIslander  American  Total \nFemale \n           \n1st Referral  90  157  3  1  1  252 \n2nd Referral  22  57  79 \n     \n3rd Referral  7  41  48 \n     \n4th Referral  4  13  17 \n     \n5th Referral  2  9  11 \n     \nMore Than 5 Prior Referrals  2  40  42 \n     \nSubtotal  127  317  3  1  1  449 \nMale \n           \n1st Referral  152  238  10  4  404 \n \n2nd Referral  46  103  3  2  154 \n \n3rd Referral  23  53  76 \n     \n4th Referral  12  45  1  2  60 \n \n5th Referral  15  34  2  1  52 \n \nMore Than 5 Prior Referrals  43  115  4  3  165 \n \nSubtotal  291  588  20  12  911 \n \nGrand Total  418  905  23  13  1  1,360 \n \n  This becomes clear when we consider    \n21 \n \n\nTable 4, which shows that 57.9% of white youth had no prior referrals, while only 43.6% of \nblack youth had not previously been referred7. The percentages of black youth on their 2nd, 3rd, \n4th, 5th, and subsequent referrals were higher than the percentages of white youth with prior \nreferrals. When examining court data for disproportionate minority contact, it is common to \nfind that black youth have more extensive court contact than white youth overall. The research \nliterature has long been divided over whether to attribute this to: differential involvement in \noffending on the part of youth; differential treatment of groups of youth as a consequence of \nstereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination; processual issues in juvenile justice decision-\nmaking resulting from the social organization of the juvenile justice system; and \nmacrostructural explanations that focus on characteristics of communities and the juvenile \ncourts that serve them (Engen, Steen, & Bridges, 2002; Huizinga, Thornberry, Knight, & Lovegrove, \n2007; Piquero & Brame, 2008; Sampson & Lauritsen, 1997). It is not possible to assess these \nexplanations using the current data in this report, but this should be a central concern for \ncontinued data collection and analysis. \n \n   \n22 \n \n\nTable 4 Within Race Percentage of Youth with Prior Referrals by the Number of Prior \nReferrals \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAsian / Pacific  Native  Grand \nPrior Referrals  White  Black  Hispanic \nIslander  American  Total \n1st Referral  57.9 %  43.6 %  56.5 %  38.5 %  100.0 %  48.2 % \n2nd Referral  16.3 %  17.7 %  13.0 %  15.4 %  17.1 % \n \n3rd Referral  7.2 %  10.4 %  9.1 % \n     \n4th Referral  3.8 %  6.4 %  4.3 %  15.4 %  5.7 % \n \n5th Referral  4.1 %  4.8 %  8.7 %  7.7 %  4.6 % \n \nMore Than 5 Prior Referrals  10.8 %  17.1 %  17.4 %  23.1 %  15.2 % \n \n \n  As indicated by Table 5, 56.1% of female youth had no prior referrals, while only 44.4% \nof black youth had not previously been referred.

It is important to also consider how referrals are \nhandled. The following dispositions were included in the extract for this first section: “Informal \nAdjustment Counseled and Warned”, “Juvenile Warning Letter Sent”, “Terminate Informal \n25 \n \n\nAdjustment”, “Juvenile Referral Rejected Insufficient Evidence”, “Transfer to Other Agency”, \nand “Transfer to Other Juvenile Court”. As shown in Table 7, a plurality of referrals (42.4%) that \nwere resolved informally were rejected due to insufficient evidence. Most of the referrals that \nwere rejected for insufficient evidence were referrals of black youth (66.6%). However, there \nwas no relationship between race and rejection of referrals of black youth. Determining this \nrequires more than examining proportions. \n \n  Chi-square tests for independence9 were performed on each of the dispositions \nsummarized in Table 7. The emphasis (bold font and shading) in the cells below indicates the \ngroup that had higher than expected counts of referrals with each of the relevant informal \ndispositions, as explained below. \n \nTable 7 Informally Resolved Delinquency Referrals by Type of Disposition and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAsian / Pacific  Native  Grand \nType of Disposition  White  Black  Hispanic \nIslander  American  Total \nInf Adj Counseled and Warned \n           \nReferrals  33  128  161 \n     \nPercentage Within Race  7.9 %  14.1 %  11.8 % \n     \nPercentage Across Race  20.5 %  79.5 %  100.0 % \n     \nJuv Referral Rejected Insuf Evid \n           \nReferrals  168  384  15  10  577 \n \nPercentage Within Race  40.2 %  42.4 %  65.2 %  76.9 %  42.4 % \n \nPercentage Across Race  29.1 %  66.6 %  2.6 %  1.7 %  100.0 % \n \nJuv Warning Letter Sent \n           \nReferrals  22  11  33 \n     \nPercentage Within Race  5.3 %  1.2 %  2.4 % \n     \nPercentage Across Race  66.7 %  33.3 %  100.0 % \n     \nTerminate Informal Adjustment \n           \nReferrals  135  240  4  2  1  382 \nPercentage Within Race  32.3 %  26.5 %  17.4 %  15.4 %  100.0 %  28.1 % \nPercentage Across Race  35.3 %  62.8 %  1.0 %  0.5 %  0.3 %  100.0 % \nTransfer to Other Agency \n           \nReferrals  4  4 \n       \nPercentage Within Race  0.4 %  0.3 % \n       \nPercentage Across Race  100.0 %  100.0 % \n       \nTransfer to Other Juvenile Ct \n           \nReferrals  60  138  4  1  203 \n \nPercentage Within Race  14.4 %  15.2 %  17.4 %  7.7 %  14.9 % \n \nPercentage Across Race  29.6 %  68.0 %  2.0 %  0.5 %  100.0 % \n \nTotal Referrals  418  905  23  13  1  1,360 \n26 \n \n\nTotal Percentage Within Race  100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 % \nTotal Percentage Across Race  30.7 %  66.5 %  1.7 %  1.0 %  0.1 %  100.0 % \n \n  A chi-square test on the disposition “Juvenile Referral Rejected Insufficient Evidence” \nwas performed, and a statistically significant relationship was found between race and rejected \nreferral, 2 (3, N = 1,359) = 12.08, p = .007. As indicated by the percentage within race, more \nHispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander referrals were rejected than not, more than expected in the \ntest. If referrals are rejected on the basis of legal sufficiency alone, we would expect race to \nhave no bearing on the decision, but this test indicates that there is a race effect for Hispanic \nand Asian referrals, though the relationship is very weak, V = 0.09, p = 0.007. A chi-square test \nof the relationship between race and rejected referral when only referrals of white and black \nyouth were included showed no relationship between race and rejected referral, 2 (1, N = \n1,323) = 0.59, p = 0.44. \n \n  A chi-square test of the disposition “Informal Adjustment Counseled and Warned”, for \nwhich an informal adjustment conference is not held and for which a risk assessment is not \nrequired, indicates that there is a significant relationship between race and taking no action in \nthe form of an informal adjustment contract, 2 (1 N = 1,323) = 10.45, p = 0.001. The \nrelationship is very weak, V = 0.09, p = 0.001. Only referrals of black youth and white youth \nwere included in the test. More referrals of black youth were handled with the disposition of \ncounsel and warn than expected in the test. \n \n  A chi-square test of the disposition “Juvenile Warning Letter Sent”, for which an \ninformal adjustment conference is not held and for which a risk assessment is not required, \nindicates that there is also a significant relationship between race and sending a warning letter, \n2 (1 N = 1,323) = 19.26, p < 0.001. The relationship is weak, V = 0.12, p < 0.001. More referrals \nof white youth were handled with a warning letter than expected in the test. \n \n  A chi-square test of the disposition “Transfer to Other Juvenile Court”, which indicates \nthat the jurisdiction of the youth is transferred to another juvenile court prior to adjudication or \nproceeding, shows no significant relationship between race and transfer of jurisdiction, 2 (1 N \n= 1,323) = 1.85, p = 0.17. \n \n  A chi-square test of the disposition of “Transfer to Other Agency”, which indicates that \nthe jurisdiction of the youth was transferred to a different agency, including DYS, was not \nperformed due to an insufficient number of referrals to run the test. \n \n  A chi-square test was also performed on the disposition “Terminate Informal \nAdjustment”, which indicates that an informal adjustment contract was signed by the youth \nand parents at some point and that the informal adjustment was ended during the reporting \nperiod. A statistically significant relationship was found between race and informal adjustment, \n2 (1 N = 1,323) = 4.69, p = 0.03. The relationship is very weak, V = 0.06, p =0.03. Only referrals \nof black and white youth were included in this test10. More referrals of white youth were \n27 \n \n\ninformally adjusted than expected, and fewer referrals of black youth were informally adjusted \nthan expected in the test. \n \n  While learning that white youth were more likely than black youth to be on informal \nadjustment is informative, knowing only that the disposition was “Terminate Informal \nAdjustment” does not actually tell us anything about whether or not the youth on informal \nadjustment were on supervision. Therefore, another extract was performed to pull the docket \n“V” codes for informal adjustment: “VIANS”, which means “Informal Adjustment no \nSupervision”, and “VIAWS”, which means “Informal Adjustment With Supervision”. As indicated \nby Table 8, a majority of referrals of youth on informal adjustment (52.6%) were not placed on \nsupervision. Referrals of black youth accounted for a majority of the referrals of youth not \nplaced on supervision (55.7%), and referrals of black youth also accounted for a majority of the \nreferrals of youth placed on supervision (70.2%). \n \nChi-square tests for independence were performed on the two types of informal adjustment \nsummarized in Table 8. The emphasis (bold font and shading) in the cells below indicates the \ngroup that had a higher than expected count of referrals without supervision and the group \nthat had a higher than expected count of referrals with supervision, as explained below. \n \nTable 8 Referrals on Informal Adjustment by Type of Informal Adjustment and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAsian / Pacific  Native  Grand \nType of Informal Adjustment  White  Black  Hispanic \nIslander  American  Total \nInformal Adjustment no Sup \n           \nReferrals  85  112  2  2  0  201 \nPercentage Within Race  62.5 %  46.9 %  50.0 %  100.0 %  0.0 %  52.6 % \nPercentage Across Race  42.3 %  55.7 %  1.0 %  1.0 %  0.0 %  100.0% \nInformal Adjustment With Sup \n           \nReferrals  51  127  2  0  1  181 \nPercentage Within Race  37.5 %  53.1 %  50.0 %  0.0 %  100.0 %  47.4 % \nPercentage Across Race  28.2 %  70.2 %  1.1 %  0.0 %  0.6 %  100.0 % \nTotal Referrals  136  239  4  2  1  382 \nTotal Percentage Within Race  100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 % \nTotal Percentage Across Race  35.6 %  62.6 %  1.0 %  0.5 %  0.3 %  100.0 % \n \nA chi-square was performed on this data, and a statistically significant relationship was found \nbetween race and type of informal adjustment, 2 (1 N = 375) = 8.50, p = 0.004. The \nrelationship is weak, though it is stronger than any others reported in this section, V = 0.15, p = \n0.004. Only referrals of black and white youth were included in this test. More referrals of black \nyouth on informal adjustment were placed on supervision than expected, and fewer referrals of \nwhite youth on informal adjustment were placed on supervision than expected in the test. \nConversely, fewer referrals of white youth on informal adjustment were placed on supervision \n28 \n \n\nthan expected, and more referrals of black youth on informal adjustment were placed on \nsupervision than expected in the test. \n \nCharges and Severity of Offense \n  As indicated in Table 9, few (2.9%) of the informally resolved referrals included as the \nmost serious allegation one of the very serious felony person charge categories: “Forcible \nRape”, “Felony Assault”, and “Felony Sex Offense”. When the most serious felony property \ncharge category, “Robbery”, and miscellaneous felony charge category, “Felony Weapons \nOffense”, are added to this list, referrals with the most serious felony allegations account for \n4.6% of all referrals informally resolved. Also, few (1.0%) of the informally resolved referrals \nincluded allegations from the least serious charge categories: “All Other Juvenile”11, “Driving \nWithout a License”, and “All Other Traffic”. See below for a discussion of the most common \ncharge categories. \n \nTable 9 Informally Resolved Delinquency Referrals by Charge Category and Race \n(Ordered by Severity of Offense12) \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAsian / Pacific  Native  Grand \nCharge Category  White  Black  Hispanic \nIslander  American  Total \nForcible Rape  2  1  3 \n     \nRobbery  1  2        3 \nFelony Assault  3  10  1  14 \n   \nFelony Weapons Offense  6  14  20 \n     \nFelony Sex Offense  9  12  1  22 \n   \nAll Other Adult Felonies13  2  2 \n       \nMisdemeanor Weapons Offenses  3  12  15 \n     \nMisdemeanor Assault  61  212  7  1    281 \nBurglary  4  25  29 \n     \nFelony Theft  6  46  1  53 \n   \nMisdemeanor Sex Offense  4  17  21 \n     \nMisdemeanor Theft  107  238  3  3  351 \n \nFelony Property Offense  5  12  2  1  20 \n \nFelony Drug Offense  4  2      1  7 \nMisdemeanor Property Offense  68  154  5  4  231 \n \nMisdemeanor Drug Offense  71  37  1  1  110 \n \nDisorderly Conduct  19  56  75 \n     \nAll Other Adult14  16  39  3  58 \n   \nLiquor & Tobacco Offense  28  4  32 \n     \nAll Other Juvenile    9        9 \nDriving Without a License  1  1  1  3 \n   \nAll Other Traffic  1  1 \n       \n29 \n \n\nGrand Total  418  905  23  13  1  1,360 \n \n  Table 10 presents the top ten delinquency charge categories that were informally \nresolved within the reporting period. This accounts for 91.3% of all referrals that were \ninformally resolved. Most informal dispositions were for misdemeanor offenses, particularly \n“Misdemeanor Theft” and “Misdemeanor Assault”. Within referrals that were informally \ndisposed, black youth were more likely than white youth to have been handled informally for \nthree out of the top ten charge categories. These categories were “Misdemeanor Assault”, \n“Felony Theft”, and “Burglary”. The exceptions were “Misdemeanor Drug Offense” and “Liquor \nand Tobacco Offense”, for which white youth were more likely than black youth to have been \nhandled informally. The categories where chi-square tests indicate a relationship between the \ncharge category and race are bolded below, and shading indicates the group that had higher \nthan expected informal dispositions for each of the relevant charge categories. \n \nTable 10 Top Ten Informally Resolved Delinquency Referrals by Charge Category and Race \n(Ordered by Count of Referrals of Black Youth) \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAsian / Pacific  Grand \nCharge Category  White  Black  Hispanic \nIslander  Total \nMisdemeanor Theft  107  238  3  3  351 \nMisdemeanor Assault  61  212  7  1  281 \nMisdemeanor Property Offense  68  154  5  4  231 \nDisorderly Conduct  19  56  75 \n   \nFelony Theft  6  46  1  53 \n \nAll Other Adult  16  39  3    58 \nMisdemeanor Drug Offense  71  37  1  1  110 \nBurglary  4  25  29 \n   \nFelony Sex Offense  9  12  1  22 \n \nLiquor & Tobacco Offense  28  4  32 \n   \nGrand Total  389  823  20  10  1,242 \n \n  A chi-square test was performed on the charge category “Misdemeanor Assault”, and a \nstatistically significant relationship was found between race and informal disposition, 2 (1 N = \n1,323) = 13.62, p < 0.001.

The decision to detain \nor release a juvenile must comply with Court Operating Rule 28, which mandates the use of the \nJDTA to assess whether or not a juvenile presents a risk to public safety or may fail to appear in \ncourt for an adjudication hearing. The JDTA provides a score that is to be used to inform “the \ninitial decision whether to detain in secure detention, utilize an alternative to secure detention, \nor release with or without conditions pending hearing” (Missouri Supreme Court, 2012). The \nJDTA provides scores for six factors: 1. Capias, Court Order, or Warrant; 2. Most Serious \nPresented Offense; 3. Unrelated Presented Offenses; 4. Prior Juvenile Referrals; 5. Current Legal \nStatus; and 6. Flight Risk. After scoring a youth presented for possible detention on these six \nfactors, the total score is used to determine the “indicated decision” of the instrument: secure \ndetention, detention alternative, or release. The person utilizing the JDTA has the ability to \noverride the indicated decision either up or down. Last, in addition to recording the sex and \nrace of the youth, a user of the JDTA selects the “reporting reason code for detention”15. \n \nDetained by Sex and Race \n  Between 1/1/2017 and 6/30/2017, the St. Louis County Family Court utilized the JDTA to \nmake the decision to detain youth on the basis of 137 referrals. Referrals of female youth \nrepresented 10.2% of the decision to detain, so the majority, 89.8%, of detention decisions \n(indicated by the instrument or overridden up) were made about male referrals. In addition, \nnote that most, 83.9%, of the decisions to detain (indicated by the instrument or overridden \nup) were made about black referrals. Referrals of white youth account for 13.9% of detention \n31 \n \n\ndecisions, referrals of Hispanic youth account for 1.5% of detention decisions, and referrals of \nAsian/Pacific Islander youth account for the remaining 0.7% of detention decisions. Most, \n95.6%, of the total decisions to detain were made on the basis of the indicated decision on the \nJDTA. The remaining 4.3% of the total decisions to detain were made on the basis of overrides \nup to detention. Please refer to Table 11 for specific frequencies. \n \nTable 11 JDTA Detention Indicated Decision Retained and Overrides up to Detention by Sex \nand Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAsian / Pacific  Grand \nSex  White  Black  Hispanic \nIslander  Total \nFemale \n         \nDetention Decision Retained  1  11  12 \n   \nOverride Up to Detention  1  1  2 \n   \nMale \n         \nDetention Decision Retained  17  99  2  1  119 \nOverride Up to Detention  4  4 \n     \nTotal Detention Decision Retained  18  110  2  1  131 \nTotal Override Up to Detention  1  5  6 \n   \n \nAlternative by Sex and Race \n  During the reporting period, the St. Louis County Family Court utilized the JDTA to make \nthe decision to assign youth to an alternative program on the basis of 23 referrals. Referrals of \nfemale youth represented 13.0% of the decision to assign an alternative, so the majority, \n87.0%, of decisions about alternatives were made about male referrals. In addition, note that \nmost, 78.3%, of the decisions to assign an alternative program were made about black referrals. \nReferrals of white youth account for the remaining 21.7% of the decisions about alternatives. \nAll of the total decisions to assign youth to alternative programs were made on the basis of \naccepting the indicated decision on the JDTA.

Most \n(88.2%) of those secure detention admissions were admissions of male youth, while the \nremaining 11.8% were admissions of female youth. In addition, most (86.4%) of those detention \nadmissions were admissions of black youth, while 11.8% were admissions of white youth, and \nthe remaining 1.8% were admissions of Hispanic youth.

A statistically significant relationship was found between race and \nadmission, 2 (1, N = 2,456) = 30.03, p < 0.001. More black referrals than expected in the test \nwere admitted for secure detention, and fewer white referrals than expected were admitted. \nThis test indicates that there is a race effect for black referrals, though the relationship is very \nweak, V = 0.11, p < 0.001. \n \n40 \n \n\n  Prior research has shown that youth of color are more likely to be detained before \nadjudication and also that pre-adjudication detention is a significant predictor in decision-\nmaking at subsequent juvenile justice stages, particularly in petitions, which refers to the \nformal filing of charges (Rodriguez, The cumulative effect of race and ethnicity in juvenile court \noutcomes and why preadjudication detention matters, 2010). More data analysis is required to \nsubstantiate that race has an effect on pre-adjudication detention in St. Louis County, especially \nwhen other variables, such as legal factors and risk/needs data, are included. Multiple \nregression will be required to more adequately address this, but more data than was available \nduring the reporting period will be required for this. \n \nDistinct Counts of Youth and Duplicated Count of Referrals Detained \n  As indicated by Table 20, a distinct count of youth securely detained pre-adjudication \nbetween 1/1/2017 and 6/30/2017 shows that 99 youth accounted for 110 secure, pre-\nadjudication detention admissions. Twelve white youth accounted for 13 secure, pre-\nadjudication detention admissions, 86 black youth accounted for 95 secure, pre-adjudication \ndetention admissions, and one Hispanic youth accounted for two secure, pre-adjudication \ndetention admissions. \n \nTable 20 Distinct Count of Youth and Duplicated Count of Referrals Detained by Sex and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nSex  White  Black  Hispanic  Grand Total \nFemale \n       \nDistinct Count of Parties  1  10  11 \n \nDuplicated Count of Referrals  1  12  13 \n \nMale \n       \nDistinct Count of Parties  11  76  1  88 \nDuplicated Count of Referrals  12  83  2  97 \nTotal Distinct Count of Parties  12  86  1  99 \nTotal Duplicated Count of Referrals  13  95  2  110 \n \nAge and Race \n  The majority of secure, pre-adjudication detentions during the reporting period were for \nreferrals of youth aged 15 or 1618, accounting for 31.8% and 37.3%, respectively, of total secure \ndetention admissions.

The fact that a majority of admissions were for either a felony or “Violation of Valid \nCourt Order” is not surprising. However, a chi-square test for independence was performed on \ncharge level25 and secure, pre-adjudication detention admission26, and this test showed no \nrelationship between charge level (“Felony”/ ”No Felony”) and admission, 2 (1, N = 108) = \n0.42, p = 0.52. \n \n   \n46 \n \n\nTable 23 Pre-Adjudication Detention Admissions by Charge Level and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nCharge Level  White  Black  Hispanic  Grand Total \nFELONY  7  60  67 \n \nJUVENILE27  3  15  2  20 \nMISDEMEANOR  3  20  23 \n \nGrand Total  13  95  2  110 \n \nLength of Stay \n  When examining the use of secure, pre-adjudication detention, it is important to \nexamine the length of detention stays, because doing so makes it possible to ensure that youth \nare held in detention only for as long as needed. In the process, it is important to consider \nwhether and how the length of detention stays may vary across groups based on factors, such \nas sex, age, race, and offense severity. This subsection uses data on mean (or average) length of \nstay (mean LOS) and median length of stay (median LOS) for this purpose. \n \n  In Missouri, the mean length of stay is the most frequently used measure of detention \nstays, but it is actually useful to consider both the mean and the median LOS. Both are \nmeasures of central tendency, which means that they are measures that report one score that \ndefines the center of a distribution of values – the one that is the most typical or representative \nvalue. While the mean LOS is conventional for this, also reporting the median LOS allows one to \nsee the impact of outliers on the calculation of the mean LOS. Since one, or a few, stays that are \nmuch longer (or shorter) than most of the others will either positively skew or negatively skew \nthe mean LOS, the median LOS gives a better indication of the actual center of the distribution \nof lengths of stay, potentially indicating the more typical experience of youth in detention. At \nthe same time, it is important to know if some detention stays are longer (or shorter) than the \ntypical detention stay, so a mean LOS that is greater (or lesser) than the median will allow us to \nsee that. \n \n  Between 1/1/2017 and 6/30/2017, the overall (or total) median length of stay (LOS) for \nyouth in pre-adjudication detention was 17.0 days, while the overall (or total) mean LOS for \nyouth was 23.8 days. The lengths of stay for female and male youth were very different, as \nindicated by both the median and mean length of stay reported in  \n \nTable 24. The lengths of stay for white youth and black youth are similar, the difference in the \nmedian LOS is 4.0 days, while the difference in the mean LOS is only 0.1 days. The mean LOS for \nblack youth is 4.1 days longer than the median LOS for the same group, which indicates that \nsome stays of black youth were long enough to skew their mean LOS slightly higher. The mean \nLOS and median LOS for white youth were more similar. \n \nTable 24 Pre-Adjudication Detention Median and Mean Length of Stay (LOS) by Sex and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n47 \n \n\n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nSex  White  Black  Hispanic  Grand Total \nFemale         \nMedian LOS  6.0  5.0  6.0 \n \nMean LOS  6.0  9.9  9.6 \n \nMale \n       \nMedian LOS  25.5  22.0  5.5  22.0 \nMean LOS  25.8  26.1  5.5  25.7 \nTotal Median LOS  23.0  19.0  5.5  17.0 \nTotal Mean LOS  24.2  24.1  5.5  23.8 \n \n  Detention lengths of stay vary across offenses/violations, so adding charge category can \nbe helpful for drilling into length of stay. In    \n48 \n \n\nTable 25, median (LOS) and mean LOS for female youth are reported by charge category and \nrace. The overall (or total) median length of stay (LOS) for female youth in pre-adjudication \ndetention was 6.0 days, while the overall (or total) mean LOS for female youth was 9.6 days. \nThe frequencies of referrals with pre-adjudication detention stays are quite small when slicing \nthe data to look only at the detention of female youth, particularly when disaggregating by \ncharge category and race, so the median LOS and mean LOS are the same for all charge \ncategories other than for black youth with referrals categorized as “All Other Juvenile”, which \nhad the longest length of stay overall. The detention admissions for female youth within the \n“All Other Juvenile” charge category were as follows: one white referral detention admission \nwas for “Violation of Valid Court Order”, one black referral detention admission was for “Failure \nto Appear – Misdemeanor”, and two black youth detention admissions were for “Violation of \nValid Court Order”. The median LOS and mean LOS for the two black youth with detention stays \nfor “Violation of Valid Court Order” were considerably higher than those for the one white \nyouth admitted for the same violation28. The second longest length of stay was for referrals of \nfemale, black youth for the charge category of “Felony Assault”. Two referrals of black youth, \nboth with the charge “Assault – 2nd Degree”, accounted for the median LOS of 15 days, which \nwas the same as the mean LOS. \n \n   \n49 \n \n\nTable 25 Female Pre-Adjudication Detention Median and Mean Length of Stay (LOS) by \nCharge Level and Race \n(Ordered by Severity of Offense) \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nCharge Category  White  Black  Grand Total \nFelony Assault \n     \nMedian LOS  15.0  15.0 \n \nMean LOS  15.0  15.0 \n \nFelony Theft \n     \nMedian LOS  3.0  3.0 \n \nMean LOS  3.0  3.0 \n \nMisdemeanor Theft \n     \nMedian LOS  4.5  4.5 \n \nMean LOS  4.5  4.5 \n \nFelony Property Offense \n     \nMedian LOS  3.0  3.0 \n \nMean LOS  3.0  3.0 \n \nAll Other Juvenile \n     \nMedian LOS  6.0  27.0  16.5 \nMean LOS  6.0  20.7  17.0 \nTotal Median LOS  6.0  5.0  6.0 \nTotal Mean LOS  6.0  9.9  9.6 \n \n  In    \n50 \n \n\nTable 26, median (LOS) and mean LOS for male youth are reported by charge category and race. \nThe overall (or total) median length of stay (LOS) for male youth in pre-adjudication detention \nwas 22.0 days, while the overall (or total) mean LOS for male youth was 25.7 days. The \nfrequencies of referrals with pre-adjudication detention stays are also quite small for certain \ncharge categories when slicing the data to look only at the detention of male youth by charge \ncategory and race, though, as might be expected from the frequencies in Table 22, the \ncategories of “All Other Juvenile”, “Felony Theft”, “Burglary” all had more than ten referrals \neach. The longest median LOS for referrals of white youth was for referrals in the charge \ncategory of “All Other Adult”, which accounts for one referral with the charge of “Terrorist \nThreat – 2nd Degree”. The longest median LOS for referrals of black youth was for referrals in \nthe charge category of “Felony Assault”, which accounts for four referrals with the charges of \n“Assault – 1st Degree or Attempt” and “Assault – 1st Degree or Attempt – Serious Physical Injury \nor Special Victim”. \n \n   \n51 \n \n\nTable 26 Male Pre-Adjudication Detention Median and Mean Length of Stay (LOS) by Charge \nLevel and Race \n(Ordered by Severity of Offense) \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nCharge Category  White  Black  Hispanic  Grand Total \nMurder \n       \nMedian LOS  5.5  5.5 \n   \nMean LOS  14.5  14.5 \n   \nRobbery \n       \nMedian LOS  56.0  56.0 \n   \nMean LOS  57.2  57.2 \n   \nFelony Assault \n       \nMedian LOS  3.5  61.0  38.0 \n \nMean LOS  3.5  59.5  40.8 \n \nFelony Weapons Offense \n       \nMedian LOS  16.0  16.0 \n   \nMean LOS  16.0  16.0 \n   \nFelony Sex Offense \n       \nMedian LOS  29.0  31.0  30.5 \n \nMean LOS  20.7  25.6  24.1 \n \nAll Other Adult Felonies \n       \nMedian LOS  50.0  50.0 \n   \nMean LOS  58.3  58.3 \n   \nMisdemeanor Weapons Offenses \n       \nMedian LOS  23.5  23.5 \n   \nMean LOS  23.5  23.5 \n   \nMisdemeanor Assault \n       \nMedian LOS  2.0  2.0 \n   \nMean LOS  2.0  2.0 \n   \nBurglary \n       \nMedian LOS  5.0  5.0 \n   \nMean LOS  16.5  16.5 \n   \nFelony Theft \n       \nMedian LOS  23.0  10.0  12.0 \n \nMean LOS  23.0  17.3  17.7 \n \nMisdemeanor Theft \n       \nMedian LOS  2.0  2.0 \n   \nMean LOS  2.0  2.0 \n   \nFelony Property Offense \n       \nMedian LOS  6.0  6.0 \n   \nMean LOS  6.0  6.0 \n   \n52 \n \n\nMisdemeanor Property Offense \n       \nMedian LOS  5.0  25.0  15.0 \n \nMean LOS  5.0  25.0  15.0 \n \nMisdemeanor Drug Offense \n       \nMedian LOS  43.0  43.0 \n   \nMean LOS  43.0  43.0 \n   \nAll Other Adult \n       \nMedian LOS  86.0  29.5  30.0 \n \nMean LOS  86.0  29.5  48.3 \n \nStatus Offense \n       \nMedian LOS  4.0  4.0 \n   \nMean LOS  4.0  4.0 \n   \nAll Other Juvenile \n       \nMedian LOS  28.0  17.0  5.5  15.0 \nMean LOS  27.7  21.7  5.5  21.1 \nTotal Median LOS  25.5  22.0  5.5  22.0 \nTotal Mean LOS  25.8  26.1  5.5  25.7 \n \nAlternatives to Detention \n  This section reports on data about detention alternative programs that were utilized \nwith youth in lieu of securely detaining them and detention alternative programs that were \nutilized by moving youth from detention into the alternative programs. Youth may be assigned \nto an alternative to detention program at the time of detention screening using the JDTA, or \nyouth may be moved to an alternative program after a detention stay has begun, a practice \nthat is explicitly encouraged by the Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (Orlando, 1999). \nSensibly, youth moved to programs after having been detained will not be counted in reports \non the use of alternative to detention programs for the Juvenile Detention Alternatives \nInitiative (JDAI), so it is necessary to track them separately. \n \nSex and Race \n  Between 1/1/2017 and 6/30/2017, the St. Louis County Family Court utilized alternative \nprograms for 58 delinquency referrals. As indicated in    \n53 \n \n\nTable 27, 23 referrals were assigned to an alternative in lieu of detention, while 58 referrals \nwere assigned to detention before being moved to an alternative program. Most in both groups \nwere male. In addition, most of the alternative programs were for black youth. \n \n   \n54 \n \n\nTable 27 Detention Alternatives by Sex and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAsian / Pacific  Grand \nSex  White  Black  Hispanic \nIslander  Total \nFemale \n         \nAlternative in lieu of Detention  3  3 \n     \nMoved From Detention to Alternative  3  5  8 \n   \nMale \n         \nAlternative in lieu of Detention  5  15  20 \n   \nMoved From Detention to Alternative  9  39  1  1  50 \nTotal Alternative in lieu of Detention  5  18  23 \n   \nTotal Moved From Detention to Alternative  12  44  1  1  58 \n \nAge and Race \n  As shown in Table 28, the majority of alternative programs were for referrals of youth \naged 15 or 1629, accounting for 21.0% and 43.2%, respectively, of total alternative programs. \n \nTable 28 Alternative Programs by Age and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAsian / Pacific  Grand \nAge  White  Black  Hispanic \nIslander  Total \n12 \n         \nAlternative in lieu of Detention  1  1  2 \n   \nMoved From Detention to Alternative  2  2 \n     \n13 \n         \nAlternative in lieu of Detention  2  2 \n     \nMoved From Detention to Alternative  6  6 \n     \n14 \n         \nAlternative in lieu of Detention  1  6  7 \n   \nMoved From Detention to Alternative  2  5  7 \n   \n15 \n         \nAlternative in lieu of Detention  1  3  4 \n   \nMoved From Detention to Alternative  4  9  13 \n   \n16 \n         \nAlternative in lieu of Detention  1  6  7 \n   \nMoved From Detention to Alternative  6  20  1  1  28 \n17 \n         \nAlternative in lieu of Detention  1  1 \n     \nMoved From Detention to Alternative  2  2 \n     \nTotal Alternative in lieu of Detention  5  18  23 \n   \n55 \n \n\nTotal Moved From Detention to Alternative  12  44  1  1  58 \n \nAlternative Programs \n  All but one (22 of 23 total) all of the referrals assigned to an alternative in lieu of \ndetention were given “Conditional Release”.

The remaining \nalternatives listed in Table 29, those that involved moving from detention to an alternative \nprogram, were distributed across a variety of programs. Most, with 18 programs, were assigned \nto “Global Positioning Program”. The next largest group, with 15 programs, was assigned to \n“Drug/Alcohol Treatment”, followed by the 14 assigned to “In Home Detention”. Ten were \nassigned to “Shelter Care”, and one was assigned to “Electronic Monitoring”. \n \nTable 29 Alternative Programs by Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAsian / Pacific  Grand \nAlternative Program  White  Black  Hispanic \nIslander  Total \nConditional Release \n         \nAlternative in lieu of Detention  4  18      22 \nMoved From Detention to Alternative \n         \nDrug/Alcohol Treatment \n         \nAlternative in lieu of Detention  1  1 \n     \nMoved From Detention to Alternative  7  6  1  1  15 \nElectronic Monitoring \n         \nAlternative in lieu of Detention           \nMoved From Detention to Alternative  1  1 \n     \nGlobal Positioning System \n         \nAlternative in lieu of Detention \n         \nMoved From Detention to Alternative  2  16  18 \n   \nIn Home Detention \n         \nAlternative in lieu of Detention           \nMoved From Detention to Alternative  2  12  14 \n   \nShelter Care \n         \nAlternative in lieu of Detention \n         \nMoved From Detention to Alternative  1  9  10 \n   \nTotal Alternative in lieu of Detention  5  18  23 \n   \nTotal Moved From Detention to Alternative  12  44  1  1  58 \n \n56 \n \n\nPetition of Delinquency Referrals \n  A petition involves formally filing charges alleging acts of delinquency or status offenses \nin a case before a juvenile court judge. This section will consider only data about petitions of \nreferrals with at least one charge that was not a status offense. \n \nSex and Race \n  Between 1/1/2017 and 6/30/2017, the St. Louis County Family Court resolved 276 \ndelinquency referrals through petition. As indicated by Table 30, a majority, 84.8%, of referrals \nthat were petitioned were referrals of male youth, while the remaining 15.2% were for female \nyouth. Black youth accounted for the majority, 83.7%, of the referrals that were petitioned, \nwhile 14.1% of petitions were referrals of white youth, 0.7% were referrals of Hispanic youth, \nand 1.4% were referrals of Asian/Pacific Islander youth. \n \nTable 30 Petition of Delinquency Referrals by Sex and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAsian / Pacific  Grand \nSex  White  Black  Hispanic \nIslander  Total \nFemale \n         \nReferrals  3  39  42 \n   \nPercentage of Total Referrals  1.1 %  14.1 %  15.2 % \n   \nMale \n         \nReferrals  36  192  2  4  234 \nPercentage of Total Referrals  13.0 %  69.6 %  0.7 %  1.4 %  84.8 % \nTotal Referrals  39  231  2  4  276 \nTotal Percentage  14.1 %  83.7 %  0.7 %  1.4 %  100.0 % \n \n  A chi-square test for independence was performed on race and petition30. A statistically \nsignificant relationship was found between race and petition, 2 (1, N = 2,524) = 11.07, p < \n0.001. More black referrals than expected in the test were petitioned, and fewer white referrals \nthan expected were petitioned. This test indicates that there is a race effect for black referrals, \nthough the relationship is very weak, V = 0.07, p < 0.001. \n \n  This finding is not unexpected based on prior research (Bishop, Leiber, & Johnson, \n2010), however, this does require subsequent investigation with more advanced statistical \nmethods that will allow for one to control for more than two variables. Also, the fact that the \ndirection of race effects was not consistent across all decision-making stages, meaning that \nblack youth were more likely to be affected by negative outcomes at certain stages but not \nothers (such as at adjudication), requires careful consideration of the role of various factors \nthat might be influencing decision-making. This is beyond the scope of this initial report, but \nthis does suggest questions for future analysis that will be elaborated later in this report. \n \n57 \n \n\nDistinct Count of Youth by the Number of Referrals Petitioned During the Reporting \nPeriod \n  One hundred sixty eight youth accounted for 276 referrals that were petitioned during \nthe reporting period. Twenty-six white youth accounted for 39 petitioned referrals, 140 black \nyouth accounted for 231 petitioned referrals, one Hispanic youth accounted for two petitioned \nreferrals, and one Asian/Pacific Islander youth accounted for four petitioned referrals. \n \n  As shown in Table 31, the majority of the youth (113, or 67.3% of the total youth) had \nonly one referral within that time period. Black youth and male youth were more likely to have \nreceived more than one referral. \n \nTable 31 Count of Youth by the Number of Delinquency Referrals Petitioned by Sex, and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAsian / Pacific  Grand \nSex  White  Black  Hispanic \nIslander  Total \nFemale           \n1 Referral  3  16  19 \n   \n2 Referrals  7  7 \n     \n3 Referrals  1  1 \n     \n4 Referrals \n         \n5 Referrals \n         \nMore Than 5 Referrals    1      1 \nSubtotal  3  25  28 \n   \nMale \n         \n1 Referral  16  78  94 \n   \n2 Referrals  4  21  1  26 \n \n3 Referrals  2  5  7 \n   \n4 Referrals    4    1  5 \n5 Referrals  4  4 \n     \nMore Than 5 Referrals  1  3  4 \n   \nSubtotal  23  115  1  1  140 \nGrand Total  26  140  1  1  168 \n \nPrior Referrals \n  While it was common for youth who received referrals that were resolved informally to \nhave received no prior referrals before the current referral, a majority of youth who received \nreferrals that were petitioned had received five or more prior referrals31, as indicated by    \n58 \n \n\nTable 32. \n \n   \n59 \n \n\nTable 32 Count of Youth with Prior Referrals by the Number of Prior Referrals, Sex, and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAsian / Pacific  Grand \nSex  White  Black  Hispanic \nIslander  Total \nFemale \n         \n1st Referral  2  2 \n     \n2nd Referral  3  3 \n     \n3rd Referral  6  6 \n     \n4th Referral  1  6  7 \n   \n5th Referral  3  3 \n     \nMore Than 5 Prior Referrals  2  19  21 \n   \nSubtotal  3  39  42 \n   \nMale \n         \n1st Referral  5  22  27 \n   \n2nd Referral  2  20  1  23 \n \n3rd Referral  3  21  1  25 \n \n4th Referral  1  16  17 \n   \n5th Referral  2  16  1  19 \n \nMore Than 5 Prior Referrals  23  97  2  1  123 \nSubtotal  36  192  2  4  234 \nGrand Total  39  231  2  4  276 \n \nAge and Race \n  The majority of petitions were for referrals of youth aged 15 or 1632, accounting for \n37.1% and 33.5%, respectively, of total petitioned referrals of youth aged 10-16.

As shown in Table 34, while still not the most frequent, the more \nserious charge categories of “Murder”, “Felony Assault”, and “Felony Sex Offense” account for \n10.1% of all petitions. When “Robbery” and “Felony Weapons Offense” are included, this \npercentage increases to 17.4% of all petitions. In fact, unlike with informally resolved referrals, \n“Felony Assault” and “Felony Sex Offense” do represent two of the top ten charge categories \npetitioned during the reporting period.

As indicated by Table 36, a \nmajority, 91.7%, of these referrals were referrals of male youth, while the remaining 8.3% were \nreferrals of female youth. All referrals were referrals of youth of color. Black youth accounted \nfor the majority, 66.7%, of the referrals, while the remaining 33.3% were referrals of Hispanic \nyouth. \n \nTable 36 Referrals Dismissed for Informal Adjustment by Sex and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nGrand \nSex  Black  Hispanic \nTotal \nFemale \n     \nReferrals  2  2 \n \nPercentage of Total Referrals  8.3 %  8.3 % \n \nMale \n     \nReferrals  14  8  22 \nPercentage of Total Referrals  58.3 %  33.3 %  91.7 % \nTotal Referrals  16  8  24 \nTotal Percentage  66.7 %  33.3 %  100.0 % \n \nDistinct Count of Youth and Duplicated Count of Referrals \n  As indicated by    \n65 \n \n\nTable 37, a distinct count of youth with referrals disposed by informal handling after dismissal \nbetween 1/1/2017 and 6/30/2017 shows that 15 youth accounted for 24 informally resolved \nreferrals. 13 black youth accounted for 16 informally resolved referrals, and two Hispanic youth \naccounted for eight informally resolved referrals. \n \n   \n66 \n \n\nTable 37 Distinct Count of Youth and Duplicated Count of Referrals Dismissed for Informal \nAdjustment by Sex and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nSex  Black  Hispanic  Grand Total \nFemale \n     \nDistinct Count of Parties  2  2 \n \nDuplicated Count of Referrals  2  2 \n \nMale \n     \nDistinct Count of Parties  11  2  13 \nDuplicated Count of Referrals  14  8  22 \nTotal Distinct Count of Parties  13  2  15 \nTotal Duplicated Count of Referrals  16  8  24 \n \nAge and Race \n  Consistent with other referral patterns, most of the referrals resolved informally after \ndismissal were referrals of youth aged 15-1636 as indicated by percentage within race in Table \n38. \n \nTable 38 Referrals Dismissed for Informal Adjustment by Age at Disposition and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nGrand \nAge  Black  Hispanic \nTotal \n11 \n     \nReferrals  1  1 \n \nPercentage Within Race  7.7 %  4.8 % \n \nPercentage Across Race  100.0 %  100.0 % \n \n13 \n     \nReferrals  1  1 \n \nPercentage Within Race  7.7 %  4.8 % \n \nPercentage Across Race  100.0 %  100.0 % \n \n14 \n     \nReferrals  1  1 \n \nPercentage Within Race  7.7 %  4.8 % \n \nPercentage Across Race  100.0 %  100.0 % \n \n15 \n     \nReferrals  6  7  13 \nPercentage Within Race  46.2 %  87.5 %  61.9 % \nPercentage Across Race  46.2 %  53.8 %  100.0 % \n16 \n     \nReferrals  4  1  5 \n67 \n \n\nPercentage Within Race  30.8 %  12.5 %  23.8 % \nPercentage Across Race  80.0 %  20.0 %  100.0 % \nTotal Referrals  13  8  21 \nTotal Percentage Within Race  100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 % \nTotal Percentage Across Race  61.9 %  38.1 %  100.0 % \n \nCharges and Severity of Offense \n  As indicated in Table 39, the range of charge categories for referrals resolved informally \nafter dismissal is similar to that of other informally resolved referrals: mostly person and \nproperty offenses.

This formal finding of responsibility for alleged offenses “sustains the petition”. After the \nadjudication hearing, if a delinquency ruling is made, a disposition hearing is held to determine \nwhich court orders would be in the best interests of the youth. This section reports only on the \ndata for cases adjudicated in which the most serious allegation was disposed as “Allegation \nTrue – Juv”. \n \nSex and Race \n  Between 1/1/2017 and 6/30/2017, the St. Louis County Family Court found delinquency \ncharges true in 100 cases. As indicated by Table 40, a majority, 93.0%, were cases involving \nmale youth, while the remaining 7.0% were cases involving female youth. A majority, 83.0%, \n68 \n \n\nwere for cases involving black youth, while the remaining 15.0% of those findings were for \ncases involving white youth, 1.0% were for cases involving Hispanic youth, and 1.0% were for \ncases involving Asian/Pacific Islander youth. \n \nTable 40 Findings of Delinquency by Sex and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAsian / Pacific  Grand \nSex  White  Black  Hispanic \nIslander  Total \nFemale \n         \nCases  1  6  7 \n   \nPercentage of Total  1.0 %  6.0 %  7.0 % \n   \nMale \n         \nCases  14  77  1  1  93 \nPercentage of Total  14.0 %  77.0 %  1.0 %  1.0 %  93.0 % \nTotal Cases  15  83  1  1  100 \nTotal Percentage  15.0 %  83.0 %  1.0 %  1.0 %  100.0 % \n \n  A chi-square test for independence was performed on race and adjudicated \ndelinquent39. A statistically significant relationship was found between race and adjudicated \ndelinquent, 2 (1, N = 226) = 8.47, p = 0.004. More white referrals than expected in the test \nwere petitioned and adjudicated delinquent, and fewer black referrals than expected were \npetitioned and adjudicated delinquent. This test indicates that there is a race effect for white \nreferrals that were petitioned, though the relationship is weak, V = 0.19, p = 0.004. \n \n  The fact that the findings for petitions and findings of delinquency are reversed, with \nmore referrals of black youth than expected being petitioned but more referrals of white youth \nadjudicated delinquent than expected, is not uncommon, since other research has found mixed \nresults for the effect of race (and other extra-legal factors) on decision-making at different \nstages of the juvenile justice process (Bishop, Leiber, & Johnson, 2010; Leiber & Peck, Race, \ngender, crime severity, and decision making in the juvenile justice system, 2012). While further \nanalysis using multiple regression is required to investigate this, this other research suggests \nthat questions that should be considered include: what role, if any, might stereotypes about \ndifferent groups of youth play in decision-making at different stages, how does the fact of \ngreater or lesser discretion at various stages matter for different outcomes, and what role does \ncrime severity play in influencing decisions? \n \nAge and Race \n  The majority of findings of delinquency involved youth aged 15 or 1640, accounting for \n33.0% and 39.0%, respectively, of total findings of delinquency. Black youth were somewhat \nmore likely to be younger at the time of adjudication than white youth as indicated by \npercentage within race in  \n69 \n \n\nTable 41. \nTable 41 Findings of Delinquency by Age at Finding and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAsian / Pacific  Grand \nAge  White  Black  Hispanic \nIslander  Total \n13 \n         \nCases  1  7  8 \n   \nPercentage Within Race  6.7 %  8.5 %  8.1 % \n   \nPercentage Across Race  12.5 %  87.5 %  100.0 % \n   \n14           \nCases  2  13  15 \n   \nPercentage Within Race  13.3 %  15.9 %  15.2 % \n   \nPercentage Across Race  13.3 %  86.7 %  100.0 % \n   \n15 \n         \nCases  7  26  33 \n   \nPercentage Within Race  46.7 %  31.7 %      33.3 % \nPercentage Across Race  21.2 %  78.8 %  100.0 % \n   \n16 \n         \nCases  5  32  1  1  39 \nPercentage Within Race  33.3 %  39.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 %  39.4 % \nPercentage Across Race  12.8 %  82.1 %  2.6 %  2.6 %  100.0 % \n17           \nCases  4  4 \n     \nPercentage Within Race  4.9 %  4.0 % \n     \nPercentage Across Race  100.0 %  100.0 % \n     \nTotal Cases  15  82  1  1  99 \nTotal Percentage Within Race  100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 %  100.0 % \nTotal Percentage Across Race  15.2 %  82.8 %  1.0 %  1.0 %  100.0 % \n \nCharges and Severity of Offense \n  As indicated in    \n70 \n \n\nTable 42, most of the charges for which the St. Louis Family Court made a finding of guilty were \nproperty offenses, with 17.0% of the findings being for charges of “Robbery”, 16.0% of the \nfindings being for charges of “Misdemeanor Theft”, and 12.0% of the findings being for charges \nof “Felony Theft”. The next most common charge category was “Misdemeanor Assault”, \naccounting for 13.0% of the findings of delinquency. “All Other Juvenile”, which represents \n“Violation of Valid Court Order”, account for 12.0% of the findings of delinquency.

This section focuses on data for \ncases for which an order has been issued to transfer custody to DYS at a disposition hearing and \nfor which no other dispositions have previously been entered, meaning that the disposition to \ncommit to DYS is the initial one. \n \nSex and Race \n  Between 1/1/2017 and 6/30/2017, there were five delinquency cases for which the \ninitial disposition was commitment to DYS42. As indicated by    \n72 \n \n\nTable 43, all of these cases involved male youth. One of those commitments was for a case \ninvolving a white youth, while the other four were for cases involving black youth. \n \n   \n73 \n \n\nTable 43 Initial Disposition is DYS Commitment by Sex and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nSex  White  Black  Grand Total \nMale  1  4  5 \nGrand Total  1  4  5 \n \nAge and Race \n  All but one of the cases disposed with DYS commitment involved youth aged 15-1643 as \nindicated by Table 44. \n \nTable 44 Initial Disposition is DYS Commitment by Age at Commitment and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAge  White  Black  Grand Total \n13  1  1 \n \n15  1  1 \n \n16  3  3 \n \nGrand Total  1  4  5 \n \nGeography \n  One way to examine patterns within juvenile justice decision-making is to map the \ngeographical areas that contribute the highest proportion of youth experiencing contact with \nthe juvenile justice system at key points or stages. Doing so may help to better inform an \nunderstanding of how and why youth experiencing contact with the juvenile justice system may \nbe concentrated in certain areas and also to inform strategies for addressing any racial and \nethnic disproportionality44 in youth court contact that may exist within the system. \n \n  Table 45 lists the four mailing address ZIP codes45 for delinquency cases in which the \ninitial disposition is commitment to DYS. \n \nTable 45 Initial Disposition is DYS Commitment by ZIP Code and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nZIP Code  White  Black  Grand Total \n63033  2  2 \n \n63074  1  1 \n \n63134  1  1 \n \n63136  1  1 \n \nGrand Total  1  4  5 \n \n74 \n \n\n  ZIP codes are used by the U.S. Postal Service to determine service areas for the delivery \nof mail. As such, ZIP codes do not correspond to other geographical units (Census tracts and \nblocks) and administrative units (such as cities and counties), and they may even cut across \nthem. However, the U.S. Census Bureau developed ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)46 to \nidentify ZIP codes within geographical areas that can be related to other Census geographical \nunits for which demographic data is available. Therefore, ZCTAs will be used in this report to \nprovide some demographic context for the geographic distribution of court cases. \n \n  According to the 2011-2015 American Community Survey, one of the ZIP Code \nTabulation Areas (ZCTAs) in which the mailing addresses of youth committed to DYS were \nlocated was an area with a very high concentration (greater than 70%) of black, non-Hispanic \nresidents (United States Census Bureau, 2015). Please refer to Table 46. \n \nTable 46 Racial and Ethnic Composition of ZCTAs with Cases Committed to DYS47 \n(ZCTAs Ordered by Percent Black NH) \n2011-2015 American Community Survey 5 Year Estimates \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nNative \nAsian / Pacific \nZCTA  City  State  White NH  Black NH  Hispanic  American \nIslander NH \nNH \n      % ± MoE48  % ± MoE  % ± MoE  % ± MoE  % ± MoE \n63136  St. Louis  Missouri  7.6% ± 1.0  89% ± 1.7  0.9% ± 0.7  0.1% ± 0.3  0.2% ± 0.1 \n63033  St. Louis  Missouri  31.8% ± 2.5  60.9% ± 2.6  0.5% ± 0.3  1.8% ± 1.5  0.0% ± 0.1 \n63134  St. Louis  Missouri  32.5% ± 4.2  56.5% ± 5.1  4.9% ± 2.1  1.0% ± 1.2  0.0% ± 0.2 \n63074  St. Louis  Missouri  59.9% ± 4.8  29.5% ± 4.1  4.1% ± 2.2  3.2% ± 1.8  0.1% ± 0.1 \n \n  As illustrated by    \n75 \n \n\nFigure 1, the mailing addresses of youth committed to DYS during the reporting period were \nconcentrated in north St. Louis County. Note that one of the ZCTAs overlaps with the City of St. \nLouis. \n \n   \n76 \n \n\nFigure 1 ZCTAs with Cases Committed to DYS \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \n \n \n  As indicated by Table 47, two of the ZCTAs in which the mailing addresses of youth \ncommitted to DYS were located were areas that would be considered “poverty areas” by the \nU.S. Census Bureau (Bishaw, 2014), with 20% or more of the total population below the poverty \nthreshold in those areas. \n \nTable 47 Percentage of Total Population Below Poverty in ZCTAs with Commitments to DYS49 \n(ZCTAs Ordered by Percent in Poverty) \n2011-2015 American Community Survey 5 Year Estimates \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nZCTA  City  State  Percent of Total Pop in Poverty \n      % ± MoE 50 \n63136  St. Louis  Missouri  29.3% ± 3.2 \n63134  St. Louis  Missouri  21.3% ± 4.6 \n63074  St. Louis  Missouri  17.7% ± 4.0 \n63033  St. Louis  Missouri  10.0% ± 2.4 \n \n  Taken together, the data on the racial/ethnic and economic composition of the ZCTAs in \nwhich youth committed to DYS resided raises the possibility that there could be a relationship \nbetween DYS commitment (as the initial disposition) and neighborhood disadvantage resulting \nfrom residential and economic segregation. However, since there were only four cases, we \nshould be cautious about interpreting the significance of this distribution. More data is required \nto substantiate that there is a structural pattern to the commitment of cases to DYS (as the \ninitial disposition), let alone the reasons for this possible relationship (such as differential \noffending or differential treatment by the court for example), so this will be something to \ncarefully consider as reporting continues. \n77 \n \n\n \nCharges and Severity of Offense \n  Table 48 lists all cases committed to DYS by charge category. As indicated, all allegations \nwere felonies, ranging from felony A to felony B. All youth committed to DYS were charged \nwithin the category of “Robbery”: “Robbery 1st Degree” or “Robbery 2nd Degree.” \n \nTable 48 Initial Disposition is DYS Commitment by Charge Category and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nCharge Category / Charge  Level  White  Black  Grand Total \nRobbery    1  4  4 \nRobbery 1st Degree  Felony A  1  2  3 \nRobbery 2nd Degree  Felony B  2  2 \n \nGrand Total    1  4  5 \n \nDYS Commitment Due to Violation of Valid Court Order \n  A valid court order is “an order issue[d] by a court of competent jurisdiction regarding a \njuvenile who has been brought before said court, which sets forth specific conditions of \nbehavior for the juvenile and the consequences of violations of the conditions” (Juvenile \nStandards Work Group, 2017, p. II-14). This section considers data on the commitment to DYS \nof cases with the most serious allegation of “Violation of Valid Court Order”. \n \nSex and Race \n  Between 1/1/2017 and 6/30/2017, there were three cases for which the initial \ndisposition was to make the youth a ward of the state but in which the youth was later \ncommitted to DYS for Violation of Valid Court Order (VVCO)51. As indicated by Table 49, one of \nthose commitments was for a case involving a black female youth, while the other two were for \ncases involving black male youth. \n \nTable 49 DYS Commitments for VVCO by Sex and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nSex  Black  Grand Total \nFemale  1  1 \nMale  2  2 \nGrand Total  3  3 \n \nAge and Race \n  All of the cases disposed with DYS commitment for Violation of Valid Court Order \ninvolved youth aged 1652 as indicated by Table 50. \n \n78 \n \n\nTable 50 DYS Commitment for VVCO by Age at Commitment and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAge  Black  Grand Total \n16  3  3 \nGrand Total  3  3 \n \nGeography \n  Table 51 lists the three mailing address ZIP codes53 for cases disposed with DYS \ncommitment for Violation of Valid Court Order. \n \nTable 51 DYS Commitment for VVCO by ZIP Code and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nZIP Code  Black  Grand Total \n63005  1  1 \n63130  1  1 \n63138  1  1 \nGrand Total  3  3 \n \n  According to the 2011-2015 American Community Survey, one of the ZIP Code \nTabulation Areas (ZCTAs) in which the mailing addresses of youth committed to DYS were \nlocated was an area with a very high concentration (greater than 70%) of black, non-Hispanic \nresidents (United States Census Bureau, 2015). By contrast, one ZCTA had a very low \nconcentration of black, non-Hispanic residents.

As with cases for which commitment to DYS is the initial \ndisposition, more data is required. \n \n81 \n \n\nInitial Disposition of DYS Commitment is Suspended but Later Youth are \nCommitted \n  It is possible for an order to be issued to commit to transfer custody to DYS for \ncommitment that is then suspended only to later be reinstated, resulting in commitment to \nDYS. This section focuses on data for such cases. \n \nSex and Race \n  Between 1/1/2017 and 6/30/2017, there were two cases committed to DYS after a \nconditional suspension of the order. As indicated by Table 54, one of those commitments was \nfor a case involving a black female youth, while the other one was for a case involving a black \nmale youth. \n \nTable 54 Cases Committed to DYS after Stay by Sex and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nSex  Black  Grand Total \nFemale  1  1 \nMale  1  1 \nGrand Total  2  2 \n \nAge and Race \n  Of the two cases disposed with DYS commitment after conditional suspension, one \ninvolved a youth aged 1658 as indicated by Table 55. \n \nTable 55 Cases Committed to DYS after Stay by Age at Commitment and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAge  Black  Grand Total \n16  1  1 \n17  1  1 \nGrand Total  2  2 \n \nCharge and Severity of Offense \n     \n82 \n \n\nTable 56 lists cases committed to DYS after conditional suspension by charge category.

More data is required to allow for anything more than descriptive analysis. \nCertifications \n  According to Missouri Statute § 211.071, a youth may be certified during a certification \ncourt hearing for any felony allegation based on a review of ten criteria64 established in statute. \nCertification involves dismissing the petition in juvenile court and transferring the youth to the \ncourt of general jurisdiction to be prosecuted under the general law as an adult. This is \ndiscretionary, except when a youth has been alleged to have committed felony offenses that \nare defined as mandatory65 or when a youth has been alleged to have committed a third \nunrelated felony66. This section focuses on data about cases that have been certified. \n85 \n \n\n \nSex and Race \n  Between 1/1/2017 and 6/30/2017, the St. Louis County Family Court certified eleven \ncases. As shown in Table 60, all of the youth were male, and all but one of the youth certified \nwere black youth. Counts of certifications are always distinct counts, so one certified case \nrepresents one youth. \n \nTable 60 Cases Certified to Criminal Court by Sex and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nSex  White  Black  Grand Total \nMale  1  10  11 \nGrand Total  1  10  11 \n \nAge and Race \n  Table 61 summarizes the ages of youth certified by St. Louis Family Court during the \nreporting period.

Also note that three of the ZCTAs \noverlap with the City of St. Louis. Two of the ZCTAs were not located within St. Louis County. \n \nFigure 4 ZCTAs with Cases Certified \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \n \n \n  As indicated by Table 66, six of the ZCTAs in which the mailing addresses of youth \ncertified were located were areas that would be considered “poverty areas” by the U.S. Census \nBureau (Bishaw, 2014), with 20% or more of the total population below the poverty threshold \nin those areas. One ZCTA, 63120, would be considered an area of highly concentrated poverty, \nwith more than 40% of the total population in poverty in 2015 (Jargowsky, 2014). \n \nTable 66 Percentage of Total Population Below Poverty in ZCTAs with Cases Certified72 \n(ZCTAs Ordered by Percent in Poverty) \n2011-2015 American Community Survey 5 Year Estimates \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nZCTA  City  State  Percent of Total Pop in Poverty \n      % ± MoE73 \n63120  St. Louis  Missouri  41.6% ± 6.2 \n63136  St. Louis  Missouri  29.3% ± 3.2 \n63137  St. Louis  Missouri  28.3% ± 5.0 \n63121  St. Louis  Missouri  24.4% ± 3.5 \n63138  St. Louis  Missouri  22.7% ± 4.5 \n63134  St. Louis  Missouri  21.3% ± 4.6 \n65202  Columbia  Missouri  15.7% ± 2.1 \n63042  Hazelwood  Missouri  14.3% ± 3.7 \n90 \n \n\n62208  Fairview Heights  Illinois  9.6% ± 2.6 \n63129  St. Louis  Missouri  5.4% ± 0.9 \n \n  The data presented in this section suggest that youth certified to adult court are more \nlikely to have resided in areas characterized by residential segregation and concentration of \npoverty74. As with the previous data on geography considered in this report, more data is \nrequired. \nAttorney Representation for Youth \n  The Memorandum of Agreement requires that the St. Louis Family Court “collect and \nmake available data recording whether counsel was made available to the juvenile for \ndispositional proceedings” (United States Department of Justice, 2016). This section focuses on \ndata about cases for which a juvenile attorney was recorded as an active party to the case at \ndispositional hearings. \n \nSex and Race \n  Between 1/1/2017 and 6/30/2017, the St. Louis County Family Court held 286 \nadjudication hearings. As indicated by Table 67, attorneys represented youth at most, 96.9%, of \nthese hearings75. Hearings involving male, black youth were the most common, and attorneys \nrepresented these youth at the vast majority, 97.0%, of these hearings. Hearings involving \nmale, white youth were the second most common, and attorneys also represented these youth \nat the majority, 95.2%, of hearings. There was no attorney representation at only eleven \nhearings. Most of those hearings were hearings involving male, black youth. Among female \nyouth, most, 91.7%, had attorney representation. Hearings involving black, female youth were \nthe most common. No white, female youth were involved with hearings with no attorney \nrepresentation, but two black, female youth had no representation at hearings. \n \nTable 67 Count of Cases With and Without an Attorney Recorded as an Active Party to the \nCase at Dispositional Hearings by Sex and Race \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data \n1/1/2017-6/30/2017 \nAsian / Pacific  Grand \nSex  White  Black  Hispanic \nIslander  Total \nFemale \n         \nAttorney Representation  4  18  22 \n   \nNo Attorney Representation    2      2 \nMale \n         \nAttorney Representation  36  212  4  3  255 \nNo Attorney Representation  2  5  7 \n   \nTotal of Representation  40  230  4  3  277 \nTotal of No Representation  2  7  9 \n   \n \n91 \n \n\nDiscussion \n  This first bi-annual report has presented considerable descriptive data about the \ndecision points of: informal adjustment, pre-adjudication secure detention, petition, \nadjudication, formal disposition (for those cases that result in commitment to the Department \nof Youth Services), and certification. As required by the Agreement between the United States \nDepartment of Justice and the St. Louis Family Court, the data included cover sex, race, age, \noffense information, and geography. Overall, the data is not sufficient to substantiate claims \nabout disparity, or unequal treatment, by the St. Louis Family Court, but it does indicate that \nrace is likely to be a factor in decision making at various points in the juvenile decision making \nprocess. This calls for explanation, so future reports will build on this preliminary examination. \nFor now, the following observations are notable. \n \n  Black youth accounted for the majority referrals and formal cases at all of the decision \npoints examined. This may be expected, since referrals of black youth accounted for 63.7% of \nall referrals in the first half of CY 2017, which is remarkable given that black youth aged 10-17 \nonly account for 31.2% of all youth aged 10-17. While not required by the Agreement with the \nDOJ, the St. Louis Family Court may wish to consider that any attempt to examine and address \npotential DMC in subsequent decision points will be impacted by disproportionality at the \nreferral point. In particular, it could be worth considering how to engage with referral sources, \nsuch as law enforcement, school resource officers, and school personnel, to better understand \nhow and why black youth were 3.6 times more likely to be referred when compared to white \nyouth and whether it would be appropriate to find ways to reduce that risk of referral (please \nrefer to Appendix 1 for Relative Rate Index results). \n \n  Among those whose referrals were handled informally in place of the formal filing of \ncharges, referrals of black youth were more likely to be counseled and warned, while white \nyouth were more likely to receive warning letters and were also more likely to be placed on \ninformal adjustment. Black youth whose referrals were informally adjusted were more likely to \nbe placed on informal supervision. This data does not inform us as to whether or not these \noutcomes were appropriate. They merely indicate that a statistically significant relationship \nexisted between race and the outcomes in question, which is a meaningful finding in and of \nitself, since this suggests that legal factors alone do not account for decision making in the \njuvenile justice process. \n \n  Black youth were more likely to be detained during the reporting period. In fact, the \nRelative Rate Index (RRI) for detention indicates that, during the reporting period, black youth \nwere 2.7 times more likely to be detained than white youth (please refer to Appendix 1). While \nthis risk did decline since the CY 2016 RRI results were calculated, this remains a point for \nconcern, because research evidence demonstrates that pre-adjudication detention has a \nsignificant impact on subsequent court outcomes, particularly by increasing the likelihood that \nyouth will receive more severe sanctions (Rodriguez, 2010). In fact, in a study of Missouri data, \nPatterson (2013) found that detention in JDAI sites impacted subsequent court decisions even \nmore than it did in non-JDAI sites. At the same time, it is important to remember that this \n92 \n \n\nevidence does not indicate that the use of detention was inappropriate. Future research that is \nable to incorporate other variables, such as risk and needs data, will need to address that \nquestion. \n \n  Black youth were more likely to be petitioned. In fact, the Relative Rate Index (RRI) for \npetition indicates that, during the reporting period, black youth were 1.5 times more likely to \nbe petitioned than white youth (please refer to Appendix 1). While this risk did decline since the \nCY 2016 RRI results were calculated, this remains a point for concern, since the formal filing of \ncharges increases the likelihood that these youth will be moved deeper into the juvenile justice \nsystem, potentially resulting in secure confinement. Again, the evidence presented only \nindicates that there is a relationship between race and petition and that black youth are over-\nrepresented at petition when taking into account the relative numbers of referrals of white \nyouth and black youth. Additional data is required to address the question of whether or not \nthere is disparity in petitions. \n \n  Data about commitment to the Department of Youth Services and certification were \ninsufficient to allow even for the modest use of chi square tests. Nonetheless, the information \npresented on the geographical distribution of cases suggests that examining the neighborhood \ncontexts experienced by youth involved with the court could be important for making sense of \ntheir influence on juvenile justice outcomes. A voluminous research literature has shown that \nyouth from disadvantaged neighborhoods are at greater risk for experiencing court contact and \nfor penetrating deeper into the juvenile and criminal justice systems (Freiburger & Jordan, \n2011; Leiber & Stairs, 1999; Rodriguez, 2013; Sampson & Laub, 1993). It is not possible to \ndirectly assess the potential effect of social class on court outcomes, because no class data is \ncollected in the Judicial Information System, so using U.S. Census data associated with ZIP Code \nTabulation Areas (ZCTAs) is likely to be the best that can be currently accomplished. Poverty \nand racial composition were presented here to provide context for examining the distribution \nof cases. In the future, it could be desirable to create an index of concentrated disadvantage \nthat combines multiple socio-economic measures together to assess whether exposure to \ndisadvantaged neighborhood contexts can help to account for juvenile justice decision making \noutcomes. \n \n  While black youth were more likely to experience negative outcomes at most of the \ndecision points considered, there was an exception at adjudication, since white youth were \nmore likely to be found delinquent. As stated previously, more statistical analysis is required to \nsubstantiate that a race effect would remain after other variables are appropriately controlled. \nLooking forward toward the possibility that regression analysis would confirm what the chi-\nsquare tests of independence indicate – that there is a statistically significant relationship \nbetween race and outcomes at informal disposition, detention, petition, and adjudication, it is \nimportant to consider how best to approach an interpretation of the meaning of these findings. \nAs suggested throughout the report, continuing to collect the data reported here is necessary, \nbut it may not be completely sufficient to fully inform an understanding of any disparity that \nmight be found. In particular, it may not be enough to make sense of mixed results in which \nnegative outcomes are not consistently experienced by black youth. To address this, the Court \n93 \n \n\nmay wish to consider collecting additional qualitative data in the form of surveys, interviews, \nobservations, and/or case-level document analysis to allow for additional questions to be posed \nabout the juvenile justice process. \n \n  Various researchers have focused on how “focal concerns” influence justice system \ndecision-making in combination with “causal attributions” about those who are processed \nthrough the system (Harris, 2008; Harris, 2009; Steffensmeier, Ulmer, & Kramer, 1998). \nRecognizing that juvenile justice decision makers, such as family court judges, have limited time \nand information to make fully informed decisions about the youth with whom they work, these \nresearchers have highlighted the importance of heuristics, or decision making shortcuts, these \ndecision makers use to narrow the field of information available to facilitate decisions, pointing \nout that three focal concerns stand out in shaping them: 1. Individuals’ perceived \nblameworthiness and degree of harm done to victims, 2. The importance of protecting the \ncommunity and maintaining public safety, and 3. The practical implications of decisions, \nparticularly the desire to reduce negative social consequences of decisions. These may or may \nnot be the only or main focal concerns of juvenile justice decision makers, since it is possible to \nidentify very different orientations when one contrasts a parens patriae focus on youth needs \nand treatment with a law enforcement focus on criminal harms and public safety (Leiber & \nPeck, 2012). In any case, the claim is that it is important to consider how causal attributions \nthat decision makers apply to interpreting youth behavior are shaped by these focal concerns, \nsince these heuristics may lead, on the basis of implicit bias, to drawing on stereotypes about \ngroups of youth, whether those be stereotypes about black youth or stereotypes about youth \nwho engage in certain types of crime (Bridges & Steen, 1998; Thomas, Moak, & Walker, 2012), \nto disproportionately impose formal social control on already disadvantaged groups who are \nlikely to be perceived as more threatening and less amenable to rehabilitation. \n \n  More recently, researchers have joined this focus on focal concerns with an examination \nof the social organization of the juvenile justice system, searching for instances in which the \nrelative “looseness” of “organizational coupling” impacts decision-making (Bishop, Leiber, & \nJohnson, 2010; Ericson & Eckberg, 2016; Leiber & Peck, 2012). The concept of “loose coupling” \ncomes from organizational theory of the 1970s, particularly from the work of Karl Weick (1976) \non educational organizations, in which he uses the imagery of coupling within a system to \naccount for how and why intentions and goals do not always adequately explain decisions and \nother actions that are actually carried out within organizations, pretty much exactly the kind of \nconcern for an attempt to address racial inequality in juvenile justice. In the juvenile justice \ncontext, this concept has been used to assist in making sense of the fact that the research \nliterature consistently reports mixed results about the effect of race in juvenile justice \noutcomes. These researchers have observed that the amount of discretion available to decision \nmakers varies throughout the juvenile justice process and is dependent upon the extent to \nwhich decisions are the sole prerogative of a single organizational unit, such as a law \nenforcement officer making a referral, or is informed by the joint consideration of personnel \nfrom multiple agencies, such as may happen at a disposition hearing. These researchers have \nargued that, at loosely coupled stages, “an array of sociodemographic, legal, and contextual \nfactors will shape processing outcomes,” whereas, at more tightly coupled stages, decisions \n94 \n \n\nshould be “influenced by legal but not contextual considerations” (Bishop, Leiber, & Johnson, \n2010, p. 219). To the extent that this may be true, any attempt to make sense of the outcomes \nof juvenile justice decision making that does not adequately account for the context of \ndecisions (“organizational coupling” and the role of attributions and stereotypes) is likely to fail \nto fully account for those decisions, hampering the ability to propose appropriate reforms and \npolicies. \n   \n95 \n \n\nReferences \nBishaw, A.

DMC occurs whenever the overall volume of activity for minority \nyouth at various juvenile justice contact points is disproportionately larger than the volume of activity \nfor White youth at those points (Feyerherm, 2011; Feyerherm, Snyder, & Villarruel, 2009). The Relative \nRate Index (RRI) is the standard diagnostic measure used to start the process of investigating DMC. The \nRRI measures over- or under-representation of minorities at various contact points in the juvenile justice \nsystem by dividing the rate of activity for minority youth by the rate of activity for majority youth at \neach contact point (Feyerherm, Snyder, & Villarruel, 2009). The ratio that is produced by dividing these \ntwo rates provides a measure of “relative risk”. When a Relative Rate Index indicates disproportionality, \nit can be interpreted as indicating the extent of risk for the minority group of experiencing over-\nrepresentation at a particular contact point, as will be demonstrated shortly. \n \n  Because an RRI is calculated by measuring the volume of contact at particular points and not by \ntracking the experiences of individual youth, it is important to understand that the relative volume of \ncontact between two groups may be a result of the churning of a few youth multiple times (multiple \nreferrals for the same youth within a year for instance), or it may be the result of a lower level of \ninvolvement of a large number of youth (Feyerherm, Snyder, & Villarruel, 2009). Also, it is very \nimportant to understand that the RRI is an indicator of the existence of disproportionality and its extent, \nbut it does not tell us why disproportionality occurs (Coleman, 2011). \n \n  The Relative Rate Indices at each of the contact points tracked for DMC are calculated based on \nactivity at the preceding contact point, except for the RRI for referrals, which is based on youth \npopulation. Table 68 lists the numerical bases for the rates in the RRIs reported here. \n \nTable 68 Identifying the Numerical Bases for Rate Calculations \nContact Point  Base for Rates \nReferral  Rate per 1,000 youth population \nDiversion  Rate per 100 referrals \nSecure Detention  Rate per 100 referrals \nPetition  Rate per 100 referrals \nAdjudication  Rate per 100 petitions filed \nSupervision  Rate per 100 delinquency findings \nSecure Confinement  Rate per 100 delinquency findings \nCertification  Rate per 100 petitions filed \n \nUsing Missouri statewide data, the following will illustrate how to calculate the Relative Rate Index for \nthe referral contact point. First, one calculates the rate of referral for black youth by dividing the \nnumber of referrals of black youth by the black youth population in the community. \n \nBlack Youth Referrals  =  9,459    = 0.12 x 100   =  11.6% RATE \nBlack Youth Population   81,397 \n \n99 \n \n\nThen, one calculates the rate of referral of white youth by dividing the number of referrals of white \nyouth by the white youth population in the community. \n \nWhite Youth Referrals  =  23,280   = 0.055 x 100  =  5.6% RATE \nWhite Youth Population  419,074 \n \nThe rate of referral of black youth is then divided by the rate of referral of white youth to produce the \nrelative rate, or Relative Rate Index. \n \nBlack Youth Rate  =  0.12    = 2.18  RRI for referral of black youth \nWhite Youth Rate    0.055 \n \n  Each RRI is tested to determine if it is statistically significant. Those that are not found to be \nstatistically significant are not reported, even if a value greater or less than 1.0 could be calculated using \nthe process described above. Calculating the RRIs also depends on a sufficient volume of contact for \nboth groups being compared. \n \n  We can interpret the result of the RRI calculation with reference to the value of 1.0, which \nindicates parity, or equal contact, for the two groups being compared. An RRI of 1.0 indicates no \ndisproportionality. For most of the contact points, values greater than 1.0 indicate over-representation \nfor the minority group at the contact point, while values less than 1.0 indicate under-representation at \nthe contact point. The contact points of diversion and supervision represent the exception to this, \nbecause these contact points measure outcomes that represent positive outcomes for the youth \n(diversion from formal processing and being placed on supervision rather than being placed in secure \nconfinement). At these two contact points, RRIs less than 1.0 still indicate under-representation, but \nunder-representation is not desired for the outcomes of diversion and supervision. Table 69 presents a \nguide to interpreting the various RRIs. \n \nTable 69 Interpreting the Relative Rate Indices at Each Contact Point \nDMC is Indicated When the \nContact Point \nRRI is: \nReferral  > 1.0 \nDiversion  < 1.0 \nSecure Detention  > 1.0 \nPetition  > 1.0 \nAdjudication  > 1.0 \nSupervision  < 1.0 \nSecure Confinement  > 1.0 \nCertification  > 1.0 \n \n  The Relative Rate Indices for youth contact with the St. Louis Family Court were \ncalculated for the reporting period of 1/1/2017-6/30/2017. They are presented below. To \nprovide context for these values, the RRIs for CY 2016 are presented first. \n \n100 \n \n\n  As indicated by Table 70, disproportionality for black youth existed at the referral, diversion, \nsecure detention, cases petitioned, and secure confinement court contact points in CY 2016. The St. \nLouis County RRI for referrals of black youth was 3.4. This means that Black youth were almost three and \na half times more likely to be referred in that year. The St. Louis County RRI for diversion of black youth \nwas 0.9, which means that black youth were a little less likely than white youth to be diverted from \nformal processing. Black youth were 3.4 times more likely to have been securely detained, 2.5 times \nmore likely to have been petitioned, and 1.5 times more likely to have been securely confined at DYS. \nAdjudication did not indicate disproportionality for black youth, so that result can be ignored. Likewise, \nthere was no disproportionality for Hispanic or Asian / Pacific Islander youth in that year. \n \nTable 70 CY16 Relative Rate Index Compared With White Youth \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data for CY 2016 \nAsian / Pacific \nContact Point  Black  Hispanic \nIslander \nReferral  3.4  0.5  0.2 \nDiversion  0.9 \n   \nSecure Detention  3.4 \n   \nPetition  2.5 \n   \nAdjudication  0.9 \n   \nSupervision \n     \nSecure Confinement  1.5     \nCertification \n     \n \n  As indicated by    \n101 \n \n\nTable 71, there was both improvement and worsening of disproportionality, as measured by the \nRelative Rate Indices, for black youth in the first half of CY 2017. The RRI for referral of black youth \nincreased slightly to 3.6, meaning that black youth were just over three and a half times more likely to \nbe referred during that period. The RRI for diversion of black youth remained the same, with black youth \nslightly less likely to be diverted from formal processing. The RRI for secure detention of black youth \ndecreased to 2.7 from 3.4, and the RRI for petition of black youth decreased to 1.5 from 2.5. As before, \nthe measure for adjudication of black youth does not indicate disproportionality, so it can be ignored. \nWhereas the RRI for secure confinement of black youth had previously indicated disproportionality, in \nthe first half of CY 2017, there was no indication of this. Last, there was no disproportionality for \nHispanic or Asian / Pacific Islander youth in the first half of CY 2017, which is consistent with the earlier \nRRIs for those groups. \n \n   \n102 \n \n\nTable 71 CY17 Relative Rate Index Compared With White Youth \nOSCA Extract of JIS Data for 1st Half of CY 2017 \nAsian / Pacific \nContact Point  Black  Hispanic \nIslander \nReferral  3.6  0.6  0.3 \nDiversion  0.9 \n   \nSecure Detention  2.7     \nPetition  1.5 \n   \nAdjudication  0.7 \n   \nSupervision \n     \nSecure Confinement \n     \nCertification \n     \n \n   \n103 \n \n\n \n                                                      \n1 To facilitate an understanding for the reader of how youth experience contact with the juvenile justice system, \nthis report considers the contact points in the order that they occur in the juvenile justice decision-making process, \nwhich departs somewhat from the order of the list of data elements laid out in the Department of Justice \nMemorandum of Agreement. \n2 As mentioned, referrals may be dismissed due to insufficient evidence for allegations, but allegations may also be \nrejected due to the lack of a lab report, no Miranda warning issued, no police report sent, and a number of \nadditional possible reasons. \n3 Jurisdiction over formal cases may also be transferred to another juvenile court after adjudication so that the \nother court can handle disposition and, if relevant, supervision, but any transfers in the data presented in this first \nsection concern only the handling of referrals. \n4 This section does not include data on referrals that were petitioned but then dismissed for informal adjustment, \nbecause that data is discussed elsewhere in this report. \n5 Unless otherwise noted, counts of referrals in this report will represent duplicated counts, which means that an \nindividual youth may be counted more than once if that youth was referred to the juvenile office multiple times \nduring the reporting period. \n6 Prior referrals may have been disposed in any year, not just the current calendar year. \n7 56.5% of Hispanic youth, 38.5% of Asian/Pacific Islander youth, and 100.0% of Native American youth had no \nprior referrals. The small referral counts for these three groups makes using percentages less useful for making this \ntype of comparison. \n8 Age is calculated at the time referrals were disposed through informal handling. \n9 The chi-square test for independence uses frequency data to evaluate whether or not a significant relationship \nexists between two nominal variables, which are categorical variables that do not have any numeric value. Race is \na prime example of a nominal variable examined in this report. \n10 When referrals of Hispanic youth are included, the test still shows a weak significant relationship, though it is \nonly just statistically significant: 2 (2 N = 1,346) = 6.06, p = 0.048. V = 0.07, p =0.048. \n11 The “All Other Juvenile” category summarized in this table includes the following charges: “Failure to Appear – \nMisdemeanor”, and “Violation of Valid Court Order”. \n12 This ranking was proposed by St. Louis Family Court staff. The intention is to produce a list of charge categories \nin which the distinctions between immediately adjacent categories are less important than the distinctions \nbetween categories that are farther apart on the list. For instance, depending on a given reader’s interpretation of \n“severity”, the rankings of “Felony Assault” and “Felony Weapons Offense” could conceivably be swapped, but \nmost people could probably agree that both of these offenses are more severe than “All Other Traffic” offenses, \nwhich rank last in the list. \n13 The “All Other Adult Felonies” category summarized in this table includes the following charge: \n“Resisting/Interfering with Arrest for Felony”. \n14 The “All Other Adult” category summarized in this table includes the following charge: “Animal Abuse-1st \nOffense”, “Assault - 3rd Degree”, “Carry Concealed in Restricted Areas - 1st Offense”, “Child Molestation - 3rd \nDegree - Child Less Than 14 YOA”, “Discharging Fireworks in City Limits”, “Distribution of Prescription Medication \non School Property”, “Harassment-Phone Calls”, “Interference with Legal Process”, “Interfere with Custody”, \n“Making False Declaration”, “Misusing ‘911’”, “Muni - Other Violation”, “Obstructing Traffic”, “Peace Dist-1st \nOffense”, “Possess Marijuana/Synthetic Cannabinoid of 10 Grams or Less - Prior Drug Offense”, “Possession of an \nImitation Controlled Substance”, “Possession of Marijuana/Synthetic Cannabinoid of 10 Grams or Less”, \n“Resist/Interfere Arrest”, “Seatbelt Violation - Other”, “Terrorist Threat - 3rd Degree”, “Unlawful Delivery of \nControlled Substance by Manufacture or Distributor”, “Unlawful Use of Weapon Motivated by Discrimination”, and \n“Violation of Child Protection Order - 1st Offense”. \n15 There are 16 reporting reason codes for detention: JDACO (Court Ordered Detention at Hearing); JDAWF \n(Warrant – FTA); JDBTC (Supervision/Technical Violation, JO Authorization, or Court Order); JDCPA (Pre-\nAdjudication Placement or Program Failure); JDCSX (Sex Offense); JDDFP (Felony – Person); JDDMP (Misdemeanor \n– Person); JDDWE (Weapons Offense); JDEDR (Drug Offense); JDEFP (Felony – Property); JDEMP (Misdemeanor – \nProperty); JDFFO (Felony – Other); JDFMO (Misdemeanor – Other); JDFOR (Municipal Ordinance); JDFST (Status \n104 \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                           \nOffense); and JDRAR (Pre-Adjudication – New Offense Referral). The reporting reason code cannot be selected by \nitself. \n16 The alleged status offense was coded as “Status Offense – Other”. \n17 This test was performed on the official “DYS Extract” that is used for DMC reporting and also for the Missouri \nJuvenile and Family Division Annual Report. The reporting period for this extract was 1/1/2017 to 6/30/2017. It \nwas necessary to use a different extract than the one used for the rest of the data on secure, pre-adjudication \ndetention admissions in this report, because data on referrals not securely detained before adjudication hearings \nwas needed. The Cognos report used for secure detention only provides data on admissions, not on referrals not \nadmitted for detention. In the “DYS Extract,” age is calculated as age at the time referrals were initiated. This \ndiffers from the criterion used to calculate age for the Cognos report, but this parameter could not be changed in \nthe script for the “DYS extract”, which is not a Cognos report. The ages should be almost entirely the same \nhowever. Only ages 12-16 were included in the test. \n18 Age is calculated at the time of detention admission. \n19 This test was also performed on the “DYS Extract” for the same reporting period. In the “DYS Extract”, age is \ncalculated as age at the time referrals were initiated. Only ages 12-16 were included in the test. \n20 The “All Other Juvenile” category summarized in this table includes the following charges: “Failure to Appear – \nMisdemeanor”, and “Violation of Valid Court Order”. \n21 The “All Other Adult Felonies” category summarized in this table includes the following charge: \n“Resisting/Interfering with Arrest for a Felony”, and “Resisting Arrest/Detention/Stop by Fleeing – Creating a \nSubstantial Risk of Serious Injury/Death to Any Person”. \n22 The “All Other Adult” category summarized in this table includes the following charges: “Robbery – 2nd Degree”, \nand “Terrorist Threat – 2nd Degree”. \n23 The “Status Offense” category summarized in this table includes the following charge: “Status Offense – Other”. \n24 The youth with a detention stay for the referral with “Status Offense – Other” charge was admitted on the basis \nof a JDTA score of 23 due to a “Supervision/Technical Violation” in the City of St. Louis. In the absence of a “Capias \nfor Secure Detention”, the youth would not have scored “detention” on the JDTA for that status offense referral. \n25 The variable for charge level was coded 1 if “Felony” and 0 if “Not Felony”. \n26 This test was performed on the extract used for secure, pre-adjudication detention admissions, not the “DYS \nExtract”. Only admissions of white youth and black youth were included in the test. \n27 One of the “Juvenile” secure, pre-adjudication detention admissions was for an allegation of “Status Offense – \nOther”. The remaining 19 were for “Violation of Valid Court Order”. \n28 The actual mean LOS and median LOS by charge (not charge category) were calculated but not shown here. \n29 Age is calculated at the start of the alternative program. \n30 This test was performed on the official “DYS Extract” that is used for DMC reporting and also for the Missouri \nJuvenile and Family Division Annual Report. The reporting period for this extract was 1/1/2017 to 6/30/2017. It \nwas necessary to use a different extract than the one used for the rest of the data on petitions in this report, \nbecause data on referrals not petitioned was needed. The Cognos report used for petition only provides data on \nreferrals petitioned, not on referrals not petitioned. In the “DYS Extract,” age is calculated as age at the time \nreferrals were initiated. This differs from the criterion used to calculate age for the Cognos report, but this \nparameter could not be changed in the script for the “DYS extract”, which is not a Cognos report. The ages would \nnot be the same as those in the Cognos extract, but this could not be helped. Only ages 11-16 were included in the \ntest. \n31 Prior referrals may have been disposed in any year, not just the current calendar year. \n32 Age is calculated at the time referrals were disposed through petition. \n33 The “All Other Adult Felonies” category summarized in this table includes the following charge: \n“Resisting/Interfering with Arrest for a Felony”, and “Resisting Arrest/Detention/Stop by Fleeing – Creating a \nSubstantial Risk of Serious Injury/Death to Any Person”. \n34 The “All Other Adult” category summarized in this table includes the following charges: “Assault – 3rd Degree”, \n“Assault – 3rd Degree – Special Victim”, “Escape From Custody”, “Littering – 1st Offense”, “Possession of \nMarijuana/Synthetic Cannabinoid of 10 Grams or Less”, “ Resist/Interfere Arrest”, “Robbery – 2nd Degree”, and \n“Terrorist Threat – 2nd Degree”. \n35 The “All Other Juvenile” category summarized in this table includes the following charges: “Failure to Appear – \nMisdemeanor”, and “Violation of Valid Court Order”. \n105 \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n36 Age is calculated at the time referrals were disposed through informal adjustment. \n37 This ranking was proposed by St. Louis Family Court staff. \n38 The “All Other Adult Felonies” category summarized in this table includes the following charges: “Making a \nTerrorist Threat” and “Resisting Arrest/Detention/Stop by Fleeing – Creating a Substantial Risk of Serious \nInjury/Death to Any Person”. \n39 This test was performed on the official “DYS Extract” that is used for DMC reporting and also for the Missouri \nJuvenile and Family Division Annual Report. The reporting period for this extract was 1/1/2017 to 6/30/2017. It \nwas necessary to use a different extract than the one used for the rest of the data on findings of delinquency in \nthis report, because data on petitioned referrals not adjudicated delinquent was needed. The Cognos report used \nfor findings of delinquency only provides data on cases found delinquent, not on cases not found delinquent. In \nthe “DYS Extract,” age is calculated as age at the time referrals were initiated. This differs from the criterion used \nto calculate age for the Cognos report, but this parameter could not be changed in the script for the “DYS extract”, \nwhich is not a Cognos report. The ages would not be the same as those in the Cognos extract, but this could not be \nhelped. Only ages 13-16 were included in the test. \n40 Age is calculated at the time of the “Allegation True” finding. \n41 This ranking was proposed by St. Louis Family Court staff. \n42 A distinct count of youth with cases for which the initial disposition was commitment to DYS between 1/1/2017 \nand 6/30/2017 is identical to the count of cases. \n43 Age is calculated at the time of the “Order to Commit to DYS”. \n44 By itself, noting a geographical pattern in within-circuit court processing does not indicate disparity, though such \ndisparity may exist. \n45 ZIP code is from the active mailing address of the youth’s party ID, which may or may not have changed since the \ndate of commitment. \n46 ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are “are approximate areal representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) five-\ndigit ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates using whole blocks to present statistical data from \ncensuses and surveys. The Census Bureau defines ZCTAs by allocating each block that contains addresses to a \nsingle ZCTA that reflects the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses within that tabulation block” \n(United States Census Bureau, 2017). In most cases, a five-digit ZCTA is nearly identical to a five-digit ZIP code. \n47 Hispanic may be of any race. The other racial and ethnic categories are non-Hispanic. “NH” refers to “non-\nHispanic”. \n48 90% Margin of Error (MoE). \n49 The measure is for “percentage of all persons whose income in the past 12 months is below the poverty level”. \n50 90% Margin of Error (MoE). \n51 A distinct count of youth with cases committed to DYS for Violation of Valid Court Order between 1/1/2017 and \n6/30/2017 is identical to the count of cases. \n52 Age is calculated at the time of the “Order to Commit to DYS”. \n53 ZIP code is from the active mailing address of the youth’s party ID, which may or may not have changed since the \ndate of commitment. \n54 Hispanic may be of any race.

The other racial and ethnic categories are non-Hispanic. “NH” refers to “non-\nHispanic”. \n70 90% Margin of Error (MoE). \n71 Not pictured is 65202 in Boone County, Missouri. \n72 The measure is for “percentage of all persons whose income in the past 12 months is below the poverty level”. \n73 90% Margin of Error (MoE). \n74 Note that the 63129 ZCTA is also an area that is characterized by racial residential segregation, since 93.3% of \nthat ZCTA’s residents were classified as white, non-Hispanic persons. Many think of residential segregation in \nterms of the concentration of persons of color within bounded geographical areas, but the U.S. is also \ncharacterized by many areas with highly segregated white persons, areas that are often characterized by \nconcentrated affluence as well (Sharp & Iceland, 2013). Unlike the other ZCTAs in which the mailing addresses of \nyouth certified were located, 63129 was a relatively low poverty area. \n75 Upon a review of the legal files, court staff discovered that youth were, in fact, represented by counsel in all \ncases. The inconsistency in the data will be examined and appropriate action will be taken by staff to address the \nissue in future reports. \n107 \n ",

The Commission \nheld that respondent American Cyanamid Company's fetus protection policy \"is not a hazard cognizable under the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act.\" That policy, adopted at the company's Willow Island, West Virginia plant, provided that \nwomen employees of childbearing age could not hold jobs that exposed them to toxic substances at levels considered \nunsafe for fetuses. An exception was made for women who could show that they had been surgically sterilized.

Am. Cyanamid Co., 741 F. 2d 444 - Court of Appeals, Dist. of Columbia Circuit 1984 - Google Scholar \nIt is important to understand the context in which this case arose and the task that is set for this court. American Cyanamid \nfound, and the administrative law judge agreed, that it could not reduce ambient lead levels in one of its departments \nsufficiently to eliminate the risk of serious harm to fetuses carried by women employees. The company was thus confronted \nwith unattractive alternatives: It could remove all women of childbearing age from that department, a decision that would \nhave entailed discharging some of them and giving others reduced pay at other jobs, or the company could attempt to \nmitigate the severity of this outcome by offering continued employment in the department to women who were surgically \nsterilized. The company chose the latter alternative, and the women involved were thus faced with a distressing choice. \nSome chose sterilization, some did not. \nAs we understand the law, we are not free to make a legislative judgment. We may not, on the one hand, decide that the \ncompany is innocent because it chose to let the women decide for themselves which course was less harmful to them. Nor \nmay we decide that the company is guilty because it offered an option of sterilization that the women might ultimately regret \nchoosing. These are moral issues of no small complexity, but they are not for us. Congress has enacted a statute and our \nonly task is the mundane one of interpreting its language and applying its policy. \nIn January and February of 1978, Glen Mercer, the plant Director of Industrial Relations, conducted a series of meetings for \n446  small groups of the Willow Island plant's female employees. At these meetings *446 Mercer informed the women that \nhundreds of chemicals used at the plant were harmful to fetuses and that, consequently, the company had decided to \nexclude women of \"childbearing capacity\" from all departments of the plant where such chemicals were used. Mercer further \ndeclared that the company would deem any woman between the ages of 16 and 50 to be of childbearing capacity unless \nshe presented proof that she had been surgically sterilized. \nA company doctor and nurse accompanied Mercer to these meetings and addressed the women. They explained to the \nwomen that such \"buttonhole surgery\" was simple and that it could be obtained locally in several places. Rymer Statement, \np. 2 (J.A. at 411); Moler Statement, p. 2 (J.A. at 407); Martin Statement, p. 2 (J.A. at 415). The women were also told that \nthe company's medical insurance would pay for the procedure, and that sick leave would be provided to those undergoing \nthe surgery. Cantwell Statement, p. 1 (J.A. at 421). \nMercer told the women that once the fetus protection policy was fully implemented the plant would have only about seven \njobs for fertile women in the entire facility. Approximately thirty women were then employed at the Willow Island plant. Apart \nfrom the women who obtained those seven positions, Mercer said that female employees who failed to undergo surgical \nsterilization by May 1, 1978, would be terminated. The company extended the May 1, 1978, deadline several times. In \nSeptember, 1978, the company informed the women of changes in its policy. The deadline had been extended to October 2, \n1978, the Inorganic Pigments Department was the only department affected, and the only material covered by the policy \nwas lead. It is undisputed that lead poses a severe danger to fetuses. OSHA's lead standard states the agency's belief that \n\"the fetus is at risk from exposure to lead throughout the gestation period ...\" and is \"susceptible to neurological damage.\" 43 \nFed.Reg. 54,422 (1978). OSHA concluded that \"blood lead levels should be kept below 30 µg/100 g.\" Id. That level is 30 \nmicrograms of lead per 100 grams of whole blood. American Cyanamid was unable to reduce the lead hazard in its \nInorganic Pigments Department to the level required to protect fetuses. The Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") determined \nthat it was economically infeasible to reduce ambient air lead levels to 200 micrograms (µg) of lead per cubic meter (m3) of \nair at the Inorganic Pigments Department of the Willow Island plant. See American Cyanamid Co., 1980 O.S.H. Dec. (CCH) \n¶ 24,828 (Sept. 30, 1980). The preamble to the lead standard predicts that air lead levels of 200 µg/m3 would lead to 83.8% \nof blood lead levels above 40 µg/100 grams (g) at any given time. An ambient air lead level of even 50 µg/m3 would result in \na predicted 20.3% of blood lead levels above 40 µg/100g at any one time. See 43 Fed.Reg. 52,963 (1978). In United \nSteelworkers of America v. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189 (D.C.Cir.1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 913, 101 S.Ct. 3148, 69 L.Ed.2d \n \n997 (1981), without reaching the question of economic feasibility, this court found that OSHA had failed to establish the \n \ntechnological feasibility of reducing ambient air lead levels to 50 µg/m3 in the lead pigment manufacturing industry. 647 F.2d \nat 1295. \nAmerican Cyanamid apparently concluded, after considering these facts, that the only realistic and clearly lawful possibility \nleft open to it was to remove women capable of bearing children from the Inorganic Pigments Department. \nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3105512345006470960&q=741+F.2d+444&hl=en&as_sdt=80000006&inst=9017564595980421810  2/6 \n\n5/25/2021  Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 741 F. 2d 444 - Court of Appeals, Dist. of Columbia Circuit 1984 - Google Scholar \nBetween February and July, 1978, five women employed in the Inorganic Pigments Department underwent surgical \nsterilization at a hospital not connected with the company. Two female employees in that department did not choose \nsterilization. The company transferred them into other departments and, after ninety days, lowered their rate of pay to \ncorrespond to the rates characteristic of their new jobs. \n447  From January 4 through April 13, 1979, OSHA conducted an inspection of the Willow Island plant. On October 9, 1979, *447 \nOSHA issued the citation that is the subject of this case. The citation alleged that American Cyanamid had violated section \n5(a)(1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. § 654(a)(1) (1982), the \"general duty clause,\" as follows: \nThe employer did not furnish employment and a place of employment which were free from recognized \nhazards that were causing or were likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees, in that: The \nemployer adopted and implemented a policy which required women employees to be sterilized in order to be \neligible to work in the areas of the plant where they would be exposed to certain toxic substances: \n(a) Inorganic Pigment Department—Buildings No. 85 and No. 86. \nJ.A. at 1. Classifying the violation as willful, the citation declared that it should be abated immediately and proposed a \npenalty of $10,000. Id. \nAmerican Cyanamid notified the Secretary of its \"intention to contest the citation[], abatement dates and/or proposed \nassessments or penalties ....\" J.A. at 2. An ALJ was then assigned to the case for adjudication. OCAW participated as a \nparty to the proceedings. On July 15, 1980, the ALJ granted the company's motion for summary judgment on two grounds, \nneither of which is the subject of this appeal. Reviewing the ALJ's decision pursuant to section 12(j) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. § \n661(i) (1982), the Commission affirmed that decision on the ground that the citation failed to allege a violation cognizable \nunder the Act. The Commission found as a matter of law that the hazard alleged by the Secretary was not the kind of hazard \nCongress contemplated in the Act. Thus, the Commission stated: \n[I]t is clear that Congress conceived of occupational hazards in terms of processes and materials which \ncause injury or disease by operating directly upon employees as they engage in work or work-related \nactivities. \nThe fetus protection policy is of a different character altogether. It is neither a work process nor a work \nmaterial, and it manifestly cannot alter the physical integrity of employees while they are engaged in work or \nwork-related activities. An employee's decision to undergo sterilization in order to gain or retain employment \ngrows out of economic and social factors which operate primarily outside the workplace. The employer \nneither controls nor creates these factors as he creates or controls work processes and materials. For these \nreasons we conclude that the policy is not a hazard within the meaning of the general duty clause. \nAmerican Cyanamid Co., 9 O.S.H. Cas.(BNA) 1596, 1600 (1981); J.A. at 508 (footnote omitted). \nII.\n \nThe Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 provides, in relevant part: \nThe Congress declares it to be its purpose and policy ... to assure so far as possible every working man and \nwoman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions .... \nSection 2(b), 29 U.S.C. § 651(b) (1982). This statement of purpose and policy must be considered in construing other \nprovisions of the Act. The general duty clause of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 provides: \n(a) Each employer — \n(1) shall furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from \nrecognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees. \n29 U.S.C. § 654(a)(1). \nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3105512345006470960&q=741+F.2d+444&hl=en&as_sdt=80000006&inst=9017564595980421810  3/6 \n\n5/25/2021  Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 741 F. 2d 444 - Court of Appeals, Dist. of Columbia Circuit 1984 - Google Scholar \nThere is no doubt that the words of the general duty clause can be read, albeit with some semantic distortion, to cover the \nsterilization exception contained in American Cyanamid's fetus protection policy. As OCAW points out, the rule bears upon \n\"employment,\" and may be described as a \"condition of employment.\" The policy may be characterized as a \"hazard\" to \n448  female employees who opted for sterilization in order *448 to remain in the Inorganic Pigments Department, though it \nrequires some stretching to call the offering of a choice a \"hazard\" to the person who is given the choice. Sterilization can, of \ncourse, be a \"serious physical harm.\" For these reasons, OCAW contends that the sterilization exception falls within the \nplain meaning of the statutory language. That conclusion is necessary, however, only if the words of the statute inescapably \nhave the meaning petitioners find in them and are unaffected by precedent, usage, and congressional intent. The words of \nthe statute—in particular, the terms \"working conditions\" and \"hazards\"—are not so plain that they foreclose all \ninterpretation. \nIndeed, these words have been interpreted by courts, and in a way that strongly suggests affirmance of the Commission. \nCorning Glass Workers v. Brennan, 417 U.S. 188, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 41 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974), though it involved the Equal Pay Act \nof 1963, spoke to the meaning of the phrase, \"working conditions\" and decided it should be given content by \"the language \nof industrial relations.\" Id. at 202, 94 S.Ct. at 2232. The language of industrial relations, of course, is as relevant to the OSH \nAct as to the Equal Pay Act. In Corning Glass Workers, the Supreme Court stated: \n[T]he element of working conditions encompasses two subfactors: \"surroundings\" and \"hazards.\" \n\"Surroundings\" measures the elements, such as toxic chemicals or fumes, regularly encountered by a \nworker, their intensity, and their frequency. \"Hazard\" takes into account the physical hazards regularly \nencountered, their frequency, and the severity of injury they can cause. This definition of \"working \nconditions\" is ... well accepted across a wide range of American industry. \nId. (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted). The narrowness of this definition is emphasized by the fact that, using it, the Court \ndetermined that the difference between a night shift and a day shift was not a \"working condition.\" \nThis definition was applied by the Fourth Circuit to the OSH Act in Southern Ry. v. OSHRC, 539 F.2d 335, cert. denied, 429 \n \nU.S. 999, 97 S.Ct. 525, 50 L.Ed.2d 609 (1976): \n \nWe think this aggregate of \"surroundings\" and \"hazards\" contemplates an area broader in its contours than ... \n\"particular, discrete hazards\" ... but something less than the employment relationship in its entirety .... [W]e \nare of the opinion that the term \"working conditions\" as used in Section 4(b)(1) means the environmental \narea in which an employee customarily goes about his daily tasks. \n539 F.2d at 339 (emphasis added). Although a different section of the Act was involved in Southern Ry., we can think of no \nreason why the definition given of \"working conditions\" should not apply to section 2(b) and hence influence the concept of \n\"hazards\" in the general duty clause. Congress may be presumed to have legislated about industrial relations with the \n\"language of industrial relations\" in mind. It follows, therefore, that the general duty clause does not apply to a policy as \ncontrasted with a physical condition of the workplace. \nWe might rest the outcome of this case upon this case law, but petitioners advance an argument by analogy that should be \ndiscussed: \"In this case, employees had in effect two choices: to undergo sterilization, or to quit. That such a `choice' \noffends the Act can be seen from the fact that if, instead of a sterilization policy, the hazard at issue in this case had \nconsisted of exposure to a sterilizing chemical, employees would have had the same choices: to undergo sterilization, or to \nquit.... [T]he Commission would not suggest that the presence of such factors would remove the sterilizing chemical from the \nambit of the Act, and there is no logical basis for suggesting that the presence of such factors should remove the sterilization \npolicy from the ambit of the Act.\" Brief for Petitioners at 33 (footnote omitted) (emphasis in original). To make the analogy \n449  complete, we should also suppose that in the hypothetical *449 case, the employer could not possibly remove enough of the \nchemical to eliminate its sterilizing effect. We have no desire to decide this hypothetical case, so we will assume for the sake \nof the argument that an employer could not, under the OSH Act, permit workers to choose continued employment and \nsterilization by the chemical. It remains true, nonetheless, that the \"hazards\" in the two cases are not identical unless it can \nbe said that anything, no matter what its nature or how it operates, is a \"hazard\" within the meaning of the general duty \nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3105512345006470960&q=741+F.2d+444&hl=en&as_sdt=80000006&inst=9017564595980421810  4/6 \n\n5/25/2021  Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 741 F. 2d 444 - Court of Appeals, Dist. of Columbia Circuit 1984 - Google Scholar \nclause if it has a harmful effect. A chemical is not the same thing as a policy and a congressional decision to deal with one \ndoes not necessarily constitute a decision to deal with the other. \nThis, essentially, was the reasoning of the Review Commission. The Commission pointed out that the Act does not define \nthe term \"hazard\" and turned to the legislative history for guidance. \"Congressional floor debates, committee reports, and \nindividual and minority views ... are replete with discussions of air pollutants, industrial poisons, combustibles and \nexplosives, noise, unsafe work practices and inadequate training and the like.\" J.A. at 507 (footnote omitted). From this, and \nother evidence of a similar nature, the Commission concluded that \"Congress conceived of occupational hazards in terms of \nprocesses and materials which cause injury or disease by operating directly upon employees as they engage in work or \nwork-related activities.\" Id. at 508 (footnote omitted). The fetus protection policy, by contrast, does not affect employees \nwhile they are engaged in work or work-related activities. The decision to be sterilized \"grows out of economic and social \nfactors which operate primarily outside the workplace,\" and hence the fetus protection policy \"is not a hazard within the \nmeaning of the general duty clause.\" Id. We agree with this conclusion. Were we to decide otherwise, we would have to \nadopt a broad principle of unforeseeable scope: any employer policy which, because of employee economic incentives, left \nopen an option exercised outside the workplace that might be harmful would constitute a \"hazard\" that made the employer \nliable under the general duty clause. It might be possible to legislate limitations upon such a principle but that is a task for \nCongress rather than courts. As it now stands, the Act should not be read to make an employer liable for every employee \nreaction to the employer's policies. There must be some limit to the statute's reach and we think that limit surpassed by \npetitioners' contentions. The kind of \"hazard\" complained of here is not, as the Commission said, sufficiently comparable to \nthe hazards Congress had in mind in passing this law. \nWe are not prepared to speculate that, although Congress was thinking only about tangible hazards such as chemicals, it \nwould, had it considered the subject, have decided that any employer-offered choice which leads to injury rather than \ndischarge is a violation of the Act. That conclusion would have required a great deal of thought about unforeseen liabilities \nfor employers and how far to let employees decide what is in their own best interest. It is not possible to say that, in all \ncircumstances imaginable, Congress would have made employers liable for giving employees an option where the only \nfeasible alternative was discharge. It seems to us safer, therefore, to confine the term \"hazards\" under the general duty \nclause to the types of hazards we know Congress had in mind. \nPetitioners' argument may reveal a degree of uneasiness about the implications of their position. It is clear that American \nCyanamid had to prevent exposure to lead of women of childbearing age, and, furthermore, that the company could not \nhave been charged under the Act if it had accomplished that by discharging the women or by simply closing the Department, \nthus putting all employees who worked there, including women of childbearing age, out of work. The company was charged \nonly because it offered the women a choice. Perhaps uncomfortable with the position that it was the offering of a choice that \n450  made the company liable, counsel for OCAW stated at oral argument that there *450 would have been no violation if the \ncompany had simply stated that \"only sterile women\" would be employed in the Department because there would then have \nbeen no \"requirement\" of sterilization. We agree that such an announcement would not have involved a violation of the \ngeneral duty clause, but we fail to see how that policy differs under the statute from the policy American Cyanamid adopted. \nAn \"only sterile women\" announcement would also have given women of childbearing age the option of surgical sterilization. \nThe only difference between this case and the hypothetical is that here the company pointed out the option and provided \ninformation about it. As petitioners frame the issue, therefore, violation of the general duty clause depends on the \nexplicitness with which an employer phrases an option made available by its policy. It cannot be that the employer is better \nshielded from liability the less information it provides. It would, in any event, be difficult to find that distinction in the words of \nthe general duty clause. \nThe case might be different if American Cyanamid had offered the choice of sterilization in an attempt to pass on to its \nemployees the cost of maintaining a circumambient lead concentration higher than that permitted by law. But that is not this \ncase. The company could not reduce lead concentrations to a level that posed an acceptable risk to fetuses. The \nsterilization exception to the requirement of removal from the Inorganic Pigments Department was an attempt not to pass on \ncosts of unlawful conduct but to permit the employees to mitigate costs to them imposed by unavoidable physiological facts. \nThe women involved in this matter were put to a most unhappy choice. But no statute redresses all grievances, and we must \ndecide cases according to law.

      "text": "PROPOSED PLAN OF THE FAMILY COURT OF ST. LOUIS COUNTY IN RESPONSE \nTO THE FIRST BI-ANNUAL DISPROPORTIONATE MINORITY CONTACT (DMC) \nREPORT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE \nST. LOUIS COUNTY FAMILY COURT \n \n     Under the terms of the Memorandum of Agreement between the U.S. Department of \nJustice and the Family Court of St. Louis County, the “Court, in collaboration with the \nFamily Court Administrator, shall develop a proposed plan…to address concerns found \nin the Disproportionate Minority Contact (DMC) report.”  (Section II.G.42).  The Court \nhas consulted with Dr. Brad Wing, the author of the DMC report, and Mark Greenwald, \nthe DMC expert, regarding the analysis of the data and any possible suggestions and \nrecommendations arising out of that process.  Their advice and suggestions were \nextremely insightful for which the Court is very grateful.  Based on the data, the Court \nproposes the following courses of action: \n \n1.  TREND ANALYSIS:  The DMC Report contains data for the first six (6) months of \ncalendar year, 2017.  We will continue to collect data at the same contact points \nin order to enable the Court to conduct a more detailed trend analysis.  We will \nalso develop performance measures in order to monitor a strategy to minimize \nracial and ethnic disparities at select decision points in the system from time of \nreferral to the commitment of youth to the Division of Youth Services. \n \n2.  AGE OF YOUTH AT TIME OF REFERRAL:  According to the data in Table 6 of \nthe Report (p.25), approximately 36% (429) of the total youth (1,195) of the \ninformally resolved delinquency referrals were 14 years of age or younger.  \nResearch has revealed that a youth’s early contact with the juvenile justice \nsystem is a good predictor that the youth is more likely to return to the system \nwith more serious and violent crime. The Court will explore how it can provide \nmore and better diversionary measures to the younger youth in order to avoid \nfuture contact with the juvenile justice system. \n \n3.  SECURE DETENTION:  As reflected in Table 70 of the Report (p.101), the \nrelative rate index (RRI) for black youth in detention is high (3.4) and warrants \nfurther attention.  While the rate is high, the data does not tell us why the figure is \nso high.  The Court will engage experts to conduct further analysis to start looking \nat potential determinant(s) of the high rate including the analysis of admission to \nsecure detention data while controlling for a number of factors that might predict \ndetention.  The Court anticipates that the data will ultimately be examined by the \nDMC subcommittee of the JDAI collaborative with oversight by the JDAI \nexecutive team led by Commissioner Heather Cunningham. \n \n4.  YOUTH, FAMILY AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT:  The Court realizes that \nthe “clients” of the juvenile justice system are in the best position to provide the \nCourt with input and feedback about their needs and how we can improve the \nsystem generally.  The Court has authorized Rick Gaines, the Chief Juvenile \nOfficer, and Tymesha Buckner-Dobynes, Director of Court Programs, to develop \n1 \n \n\na plan to actively engage youth, families and the community through regular \nmeetings of selected individuals and the utilization of surveys to measure the \n“client” experience in the court.  The Court will also consider expanding our \nengagement to all community based organizations including but not limited to \nyouth advocates and faith leaders.   \n \n5.  IDENTIFICATION OF THE ORIGINATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT \nREFERRALS:  Law enforcement is a major source of referrals to the court \nsystem.  However, the Court is unable to glean from the current data where the \ndata originated within the law enforcement community.  For example, if the Court \nknew that a referral came from a school resource officer, it would allow the Court \nto work with the school district to generate alternatives to court referrals in an \neffort to hold the juvenile accountable.  At the same time, if the Court knew that a \nreferral came from the “street,” the court would be in a better position to work with \nthat specific law enforcement agency to minimize referrals.  The Court will \ncollaborate with law enforcement and schools to capture the relevant data and \ndevelop overall strategies to reduce referrals from law enforcement.   \n2 \n ",

Secretary of Labor v. American Cyanamid Company, OSHRC \nDocket No. 79-5762 (April 27, 1981), reported at 9 BNA OSHC 1596. American Cyanamid has moved to intervene and has \nmoved to dismiss OCAW's petition for review, arguing that OCAW is not a proper petitioner for review under the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (\"Act\"), and that OSHRC is not a proper respondent. 29 U.S.C. § 660(a). \nAmerican Cyanamid's motion raises several threshold issues that must be answered before we reach the merits of the \npetition.

BACKGROUND \nThe facts giving rise to this litigation are not in dispute. In 1977, American Cyanamid adopted a Fetus Protection Policy and \nimplemented it at its Willow Island, West Virginia plant. This policy precluded female employees of presumed childbearing \ncapacity from being assigned to, bidding into, or holding any production job at that plant which involved occupational \nexposure to toxic substances identified as harmful to the fetus. Any female production worker who failed to provide evidence \nof permanent infertility by April, 1978, would have to request a transfer to one of three departments where toxic substances \nwere not used. Only seven job openings were available to the thirty women affected by this policy. To rebut the policy's \npresumption of the potential childbearing capacity of menstruating women, five female production workers underwent \nvoluntary sterilizations. These women retained their production positions. All five stated that they would not have undergone \nthe procedure but for the company's policy which threatened their livelihood. Late in 1978, two women presumed \nchildbearing capacity who refused to be sterilized were transferred to the utility pool with subsequent loss of pay and \nbenefits. \nOCAW filed a complaint about the policy with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\"), pursuant to 29 \nU.S.C. § 657(f)(1), in December, 1978. Thereafter, OSHA inspectors conducted an inspection of the Willow Island plant. As \na result of this inspection, OSHA issued a citation on October 9, 1979, alleging that Cyanamid had committed a willful \nviolation of the general duty clause, 29 U.S.C. § 654(a)(1), by implementing a policy which required women employees to be \nsterilized in order to be eligible to work in certain areas of the plant. Cyanamid filed a timely notice of contest, and the \n646  Secretary issued a formal complaint. On November 16, 1979, OCAW elected party status pursuant to *646 Commission \nRule 20(a), 29 C.F.R. § 2200.20, in order to participate in hearings concerning this citation before the OSHRC. Cyanamid \nfiled its answer to the Secretary's complaint and moved for summary judgment. The Administrative Law Judge granted the \ncompany's motion and dismissed the citation on two independent grounds: (1) that the citation was barred by the Act's \nsixmonth statute of limitations; and (2) that the action of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission precluded the \nSecretary's jurisdiction over the alleged hazard. \nBoth the union and the Secretary petitioned the full OSHRC for discretionary review of the judge's decision pursuant to \nsection 12(j) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. § 661(i). After review was directed, the OSHRC affirmed the ruling on a third ground, \nfinding that the citation did not allege the existence of a \"hazard\" within the meaning of the Act's general duty clause. \nAccordingly, the citation was vacated. \nPursuant to section 11 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. § 660(a), OCAW filed a timely petition for review. It named the OSHRC as a \nrespondent. The Secretary elected not to file a petition. \nII. THE RIGHT OF OCAW TO APPEAL \nAs an initial matter, American Cyanamid challenges the jurisdiction of this court, arguing that OCAW's petition for review fails \nto present a case or controversy because the statute precludes the union from being heard on matters other than the \nreasonableness of the abatement period. Our jurisdictional basis for reviewing any OSHRC proceeding is 29 U.S.C. § 660, \nwhich provides for appellate review of commission decisions. It states: \nAny person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order of the Commission issued under subsection (c) of \nsection 10 [29 U.S.C. § 659(c)] may obtain a review of such order in ... the court of appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit .... \nCyanamid argues in its motion that the broad language of § 660(a) must be limited by Section 10(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. § \n659(c). Section 10(c) is the cornerstone of the right of employees, or their authorized representatives, to participate in \nhearings before the OSHRC. It provides, in its entirety: \nIf an employer notifies the Secretary that he intends to contest a citation issued under section 658(a) of this \ntitle or notification issued under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, or if, within fifteen working days of the \nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11594577190267440233&q=671+F.2d+643&hl=en&as_sdt=80000006&inst=9017564595980421810  2/8 \n\n5/25/2021  Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers v. OSHRC, 671 F. 2d 643 - Court of Appeals, Dist. of Columbia Circuit 1982 - Google Scholar \nissuance of a citation under section 658(a) of this title, any employee or representative of employees files a \nnotice with the Secretary alleging that the period of time fixed in the citation for the abatement of the violation \nis unreasonable, the Secretary shall immediately advise the Commission of such notification, and the \nCommission shall afford an opportunity for a hearing (in accordance with Section 554 of Title 5 but without \nregard to subsection (a)(3) of such section). The Commission shall thereafter issue an order, based on \nfindings of fact, affirming, modifying, or vacating the Secretary's citation or proposed penalty, or directing \nother appropriate relief, and such order shall become final thirty days after its issuance. Upon a showing by \nan employer of a good faith effort to comply with the abatement requirements of a citation, and that \nabatement has not been completed because of factors beyond his reasonable control, the Secretary, after an \nopportunity for a hearing as provided in this subsection, shall issue an order affirming or modifying the \nabatement requirements in such citation. The rules of procedure prescribed by the Commission shall provide \naffected employees or representatives of affected employees an opportunity to participate as parties to \nhearings under this subsection. \n29 U.S.C. § 659(c). \nThe company contends that section 10(c) limits employee participation in enforcement proceedings to contesting the \nreasonableness of the abatement period. It reasons that this limit on the initiation of and participation in commission \n647  adjudications should be carried over to the instigation of *647 judicial review because Congress intended that the provisions \nbe read together as part of a \"detailed statutory scheme.\" Whirlpool Corp. v. Marshall, 445 U.S. 1, 10, 100 S.Ct. 883, 889, \n63 L.Ed.2d 154 (1980). That scheme — says the company — may most consistently be interpreted to limit the rights of \nemployees to initiate and participate in proceedings before the commission and to appeal commission decisions to issues \nchallenging the reasonableness of the abatement period.[1] \nWe reject the company's initial contention that employees have no right to be heard on matters other than the \nreasonableness of the abatement period. The starting point for our analysis is section 10(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. § 659(c). It \nis apparent that the first sentence of section 10(c) contemplates two types of hearings. The first is triggered by an employer \nwho notifies the Secretary of an intention to contest a citation. In that hearing, employees are authorized to \"participate as \nparties\" by virtue of the last sentence of section 10(c). The second type of hearing is triggered by employees who notify the \nSecretary of their contention \"that the period of time fixed in the abatement citation is unreasonable.\" \nThis second type of hearing — that initiated by employees — is tied to the agenda set by statute: contesting the \nreasonableness of the abatement period. Marshall v. OSHRC and OCAW, 635 F.2d 544, 552 (6th Cir. 1980). Employees \nare prohibited from instituting a commission action on any matter other than the reasonableness of the abatement period. \nUAW \n \nv. OSHRC, 557 F.2d 607, 610 (7th Cir. 1977). Nothing in the text of the statute, however, so confines employee/union \n \nparticipation as \"parties\" in the first type of hearing — that initiated by the employer to contest a citation. \nIndeed, the section 10(c) limitation suggested by the company would be an anomaly when viewed in the total context of the \nAct. Typically, as demonstrated by the instant case, an employee who believes a violation exists that threatens physical \nharm may request an inspection by giving the Secretary written notice. 29 U.S.C. § 657(f)(1). If, upon receipt of such \nnotification, the Secretary determines there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation exists, he must conduct a special \ninspection as soon as possible.[2] Id. A representative authorized by the employees shall be given the opportunity to \naccompany the Secretary or his representative during the physical inspection of the workplace. Id. § 657(e). If the Secretary \nbelieves that the employer has violated any portion of the Act, \"he shall with reasonable promptness issue a citation to the \nemployer.\" Id. § 658.[3] The employer may then contest the citation if he disputes the Secretary's finding of a violation \nflowing from an investigation initiated by employees. At the hearing initiated by the employer, the employee may elect party \nstatus. Id. § 659(c). It is at this juncture that the company insists that the election of party status limits the employees to \ncontesting the length of the abatement period. We find no support for this position in the statute. Moreover, we find the \nadoption of the company's premise inconsistent with the remainder of the statutory scheme. The company would have us \nhold that the employee's interest in and contribution to the enforcement process, protected by the statute throughout the \nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11594577190267440233&q=671+F.2d+643&hl=en&as_sdt=80000006&inst=9017564595980421810  3/8 \n\n5/25/2021  Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers v. OSHRC, 671 F. 2d 643 - Court of Appeals, Dist. of Columbia Circuit 1982 - Google Scholar \n648  enforcement process, abruptly ceases once the adjudicative process is initiated by the *648 employer filing a notice of \ncontest. By permitting employees to elect party status, and not qualifying this status with the same limits imposed on the \nemployees' initiation of commission proceedings, it is apparent that Congress intended to continue the broad scope of \nemployee participation in the enforcement of the Act through the adjudicative stages. \nThe anomalous limitation on employee participation argued by the company is not to be found in the text of section 10(c). \nThe company, however, contends that it is supplied in the report of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, \nwhich discusses the right of an employee to challenge the reasonableness of the abatement period. Subcom. on Labor of \nthe Senate Comm. on Labor and Public Welfare, 92d Cong., 1st Sess., Legislative History of the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Act of 1970 at 154-55 (Comm. Print 1971) [hereinafter cited as Legislative History]. The company points to the \nfollowing quotation in the second paragraph in that report to argue that the abatement period is the sole issue that can be \nraised by employees. We find, however, that when that paragraph is read along with the preceding one, it demonstrates that \nemployee initiation of commission proceedings is but one of two means of employee participation in OSHRC proceedings. \nIf the employer decides to contest a citation or notification, or proposed assessment of penalty, the Secretary \nmust afford an opportunity for a formal hearing under the Administrative Procedure Act. Based upon the \nhearing record the Secretary shall issue an order confirming, denying, or modifying the citation, notification, \nor proposed penalty assessment. The procedural rules prescribed by the Secretary for the conduct of such \nhearings must make provision for affected employees or other representatives to participate as parties. \nSection 10(c) also gives an employee or representative of employees a right, whenever he believes that the \nperiod of time provided in a citation for abatement of a violation is unreasonably long, to challenge the \ncitation on that ground. Such challenges must be filed within 15 days of the issuance of the citation and an \nopportunity for a hearing must be provided in similar fashion to hearings when an employer contests. The \nemployer is to be given an opportunity to participate as a party. \nId. (Emphasis added). \nIn sum, the legislative history shows that Congress intended to allow employees to participate as parties in enforcement \nproceedings in two separate contexts — to initiate contests over the reasonableness of the abatement period and to \nparticipate as parties in an employer-initiated contest. We find that Congress did not intend to limit the interest assertable by \nthe union in an employer-initiated proceeding to the length of the abatement period. The scheme of the Act enables \nemployees to translate their concern for workplace safety into a demand for an inspection of the workplace, and, if a \nviolation exists, into a citation. If the employer disputes the inspector's findings and files a notice of contest, the Act entitles \nemployees to \"participate as parties\" in hearings before the OSHRC. The employees' request for party status confers \njurisdiction on the commission to entertain the employees' objections on all matters relating to the citation in question.[4] \nWe therefore hold that where a union or employee has elected party status in proceedings before the OSHRC, the union or \n649  employee has a right to appeal the decision *649 of the OSHRC. As a party in an employer-initiated hearing before the \nOSHRC, the union will be \"adversely affected or aggrieved\" by an unfavorable OSHRC decision. Accordingly, the union can \nseek judicial review in a federal court of appeals under section 11(a) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. § 660(a). \nThe legislative history of section 11(a) provides further support for our decision. The House version of the Act, H.R. 19200, \nclearly limited the right to seek judicial review to employers and the Secretary. Legislative History, 1192. The Senate \nversion, S. 2193, contained the identical language as Section 11(a) of the Act, and provided for judicial review of any \ncommission order by any person \"adversely affected or aggrieved.\" Id. at 1192. Faced with the conflict between the two \nprovisions for judicial review of commission decisions, the Conference Committee adopted the broader language of \"any \nperson adversely affected or aggrieved.\"[5] Id. We therefore conclude that an employee can seek judicial review of OSHRC \naction in two situations: when the employee seeks to challenge a decision from an OSHRC proceeding which he initiated to \ncontest the reasonableness of the abatement period, and when the employee seeks to challenge a decision from an \nOSHRC proceeding in which he elected party status pursuant to Commission Rule § 2200.20.[6] \nOur view does not impinge on the Secretary's unique role in administering the Act. As the Supreme Court has noted, the Act \ncreates public rights that are to be vindicated by the Secretary through government management and enforcement of a \ncomplex administrative scheme. Atlas Roofing Co. v. OSHRC, 430 U.S. 442, 444-47, 97 S.Ct. 1261, 1264-65, 51 L.Ed.2d \nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11594577190267440233&q=671+F.2d+643&hl=en&as_sdt=80000006&inst=9017564595980421810  4/8 \n\n5/25/2021  Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers v. OSHRC, 671 F. 2d 643 - Court of Appeals, Dist. of Columbia Circuit 1982 - Google Scholar \n464 (1977). We recognize that the Secretary has been vested with considerable discretion in the promulgation of standards. \nThus, employees may not compel the Secretary to adopt a standard. National Congress of Hispanic American Citizens v. \nUsery, 554 F.2d 1196 (D.C.Cir.1977). Similarly, we are persuaded that enforcement of the Act is the sole responsibility of \nthe \nSecretary. He is the exclusive prosecutor of OSHA violations. Atlas Roofing Co., 430 U.S. at 445-47, 97 S.Ct. at 1264-65; \n650  Dale M. Madden Construction, Inc. v. Hodgson, 502 F.2d 278, *650 280 (9th Cir. 1974). Necessarily included within the \nprosecutorial power is the discretion to withdraw or settle a citation issued to an employer, and to compromise, mitigate or \nsettle any penalty assessed under the Act, 29 U.S.C. § 655(e).[7] Thus, employees may not contest the representation of a \nsettlement agreement that abatement has occurred. Marshall v. OCAW and OSHRC, 647 F.2d 383, 388 (3d Cir. 1981). \nThey may not prosecute a citation before the commission after the Secretary has moved to withdraw it. Marshall v. OSHRC \nand OCAW, supra, 635 F.2d at 552. They may not argue that a particular method of abatement would be inefficacious. \nMarshall \nv. Sun Petroleum Co., 622 F.2d 1176, 1184-86 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1061, 101 S.Ct. 784, 66 L.Ed.2d 604 (1980). \nThey may not challenge the substantive provision of an abatement plan. UAW v. OSHRC, supra, 557 F.2d at 610-11. \nWe endorse so broad a reading of prosecutorial discretion under the statute because we believe that such discretion \ncomports with the Congressional intent that the Secretary be charged with the basic responsibilities for administering the \nAct. We agree with other courts that have considered the issue that the union has no right to challenge the refusal of the \nSecretary to proceed with a citation or to file a complaint. See, e.g., Marshall v. OSHRC and OCAW, supra, 635 F.2d at 550. \nThe company, however, contends that these decisions prohibit employees from challenging the Secretary's prosecutorial \ndecisions before the commission proceedings, except where the length of an abatement period is concerned. It reasons that \nthe decision to seek review of a commission decision is a similar exercise of prosecutorial discretion and concludes that \nallowing employees to petition for judicial review of a commission decision impermissibly usurps the Secretary's \nprosecutorial discretion as enforcer of the Act. \nWe reject this position. We agree with the company that a decision of the Secretary not to appeal the OSHRC ruling is an \nexercise of prosecutorial discretion. Accordingly, we find that the union has no right to challenge the determination of the \nSecretary not to appeal. In this instance, however, the OCAW is not seeking review of the Secretary's decision; instead, it is \nseeking judicial review of an order of the OSHRC, an independent adjudicatory body.[8] Under the Act, we hold that a union \nhas the right to appeal the ruling of the OSHRC, whether or not the Secretary simultaneously seeks review, as a person \n\"adversely affected or aggrieved\" within the meaning of section 11(a) of the Act. \nThe union's right to appeal OSHRC decisions where it has participated as a party in the commission proceedings is, \nhowever, subject to two conditions, derived from the general statutory scheme and purpose of the Act. First, the union must \ngive the Secretary notice of its intention to appeal and must serve him with copies of all of the pleadings. This notice \nrequirement is ordered so that the Secretary is made aware of the litigation and so that he may act to intervene if he deems \nit appropriate. Second, the case may become moot in those instances when the Secretary, participating in the appeal as an \n651  amicus curiae or as an intervenor, provides this court with a clear *651 and unconditional statement that he will not \nprosecute the claim regardless of the disposition of the appeal by this court. The prosecutorial discretion with which the \nSecretary is vested empowers him not to renew his prosecution effort even if this court were to find that the citation \ndismissed by the OSHRC asserted a violation under the Act. Marshall v. OSHRC and OCAW, supra, 635 F.2d at 549-52. \nWhile we will not require the Secretary to furnish us with a statement of his intent, we may dismiss the appeal as moot in \ninstances where the Secretary has voluntarily proffered such a statement after the union has filed a petition for review.[9] \nIII. THE PROPER RESPONDENT IN THE APPEAL \nWe must next decide if the OSHRC, the named respondent in this petition for review, has the authority to participate as a \nparty in this court in a proceeding to review one of its decisions. American Cyanamid, in its motion to dismiss, contends that \nno case or controversy exists because the OSHRC cannot participate as a party. While we agree with the company that the \nAct limits the role of the OSHRC to that of an adjudicatory agency and precludes the OSHRC from independent \nrepresentation in judicial proceedings before this court, we decline to dismiss these proceedings. We grant the motion to \nremove the OSHRC from these proceedings; concurrently, we grant the OCAW's motion to amend and reform the caption \nand to name the company as the proper party respondent in this petition for review. \nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11594577190267440233&q=671+F.2d+643&hl=en&as_sdt=80000006&inst=9017564595980421810  5/8 \n\n5/25/2021  Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers v. OSHRC, 671 F. 2d 643 - Court of Appeals, Dist. of Columbia Circuit 1982 - Google Scholar \nThe circuits are sharply divided on the question of whether the commission is a proper party to an OSHA appeal. Three \ncircuits have held that the commission is not a proper party.[10] Two circuits have stated this position in dictum. The Second \nCircuit has noted that the commission is assigned the \"relatively limited role of administrative adjudication.\" General Electric \nCompany v. OSHRC, 583 F.2d 61, 63 n.3 (2d Cir. 1978). In Brennan v. OSHRC, 505 F.2d 869, 871 (10th Cir. 1974), the \nTenth Circuit found that the commission is \"an adjudicatory body with no regulatory powers.\" \nThe opposite position has been taken by the Fourth and Fifth Circuits. In Brennan v. Gilles & Cotting, Inc., 504 F.2d 1255, \n1267 (4th Cir. 1974), the Fourth Circuit held that \"it is appropriate for the commission to appear in the courts of appeals to \ndefend the policies Congress empowered it to adopt in adjudication.\" In Diamond Roofing Co. v. OSHRC, 528 F.2d 645, 648 \nn.8 (5th Cir. 1976), the court noted that the commission is \"properly a party similar to other administrative agencies in suits \nby the Secretary or private parties to review its orders.\" \nAn examination of the legislative history[11] and the statute persuades us to endorse the position adopted by five other \ncircuits that the commission does not have the authority to participate as a party in proceedings to review one of its \ndecisions. \nWhen read together, the legislative history and the statutory scheme of the Act compel the conclusion that Congress \n652  designed the commission as an independent adjudicator. Other statutes which provide *652 for judicial review of \ncommission action, and which have been construed to allow the commission to be named as respondent, are simply not \nanalogous to this Act. Under these statutes, true adversity exists between the claimant of a government benefit and the \ncommission which seeks to withhold it. Thus, when review of commission action is sought by an unsuccessful applicant for a \nlicense before the FCC, see 47 U.S.C. § 402, or an unsuccessful applicant for a rate increase before the FERC, see 16 \nU.S.C. § 825l(b), it is clear that the commission must be named a respondent since it is the party against whom relief is \nsought: the court could not grant an effective remedy without its presence. Similarly, the NLRB may be called upon as a \nparty to defend its decisions in court, see 29 U.S.C. § 160(f), because adjudication is being sought of its right to grant and \nenforce relief on behalf of the prevailing party before it. \nIn this instance, the OSHRC has no enforcement power comparable to the FCC, FERC or the NLRB. We believe the \nOSHRC should never be considered a proper statutory respondent under 29 U.S.C. § 660(a). The commission was \nenvisioned by its creators to be similar to a district court. It was established to settle disputes between employers and the \nSecretary of Labor over citations issued by the Secretary's inspectors. The commission, like a district court, has no duty or \ninterest in defending its decision on appeal. As a purely adjudicative entity, it has no stake in the outcome of the litigation. \nAccordingly, the OSHRC may not participate in this court to review the commission decision as a party respondent in \nproceedings initiated by any party to the commission hearing.[12] \nSufficient adversity exists between the parties at the commission proceeding to ensure a proper case or controversy at the \nappellate level. When an employer initiates a hearing before the commission to contest the issuance of a citation, the \nSecretary automatically is a party respondent in the action. 29 U.S.C. § 659(c). He is charged with defending the action of \nhis inspectors in issuing the citation. Employees may intervene as parties in these hearings. Id. If the commission rules in \nfavor of the Secretary and affirms the citation, the employer, a party adversely aggrieved by the commission's order, may file \na petition for review of that order within sixty days of the issuance of the order. 29 U.S.C. § 660(a). In this instance, the \nSecretary is the proper party respondent. His interest was adverse to the employer in the commission proceeding below and \ncontinues to be so on appeal. He has an interest in sustaining a commission action with which he agrees. \nIn those instances where the commission rules in favor of the employer and dismisses the citation, two parties may appeal \nthe commission's order. The Secretary may file a petition for review of the commission's action. 29 U.S.C. § 660(b). He may \nhave an interest in seeking review of a decision of which he disapproves. In this instance, the employer would be the proper \nrespondent. Like an appellee in the appeal of a district court decision, the employer has a concrete stake in having the \ncommission's order affirmed. \nIn a case such as the instant one, where the union is appealing an adverse decision by the commission, the proper party \nrespondent is the employer.[13] The deletion of the OSHRC does not trigger any jurisdictional problem potentially foreclosing the \neffective adjudication of the merits of the appeal. The rationale of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 15(a) which 653\n  mandates that each petition for review of *653 an agency order shall name the agency as respondent is inapplicable. \nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11594577190267440233&q=671+F.2d+643&hl=en&as_sdt=80000006&inst=9017564595980421810  6/8 \n\n5/25/2021  Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers v. OSHRC, 671 F. 2d 643 - Court of Appeals, Dist. of Columbia Circuit 1982 - Google Scholar \nIn most cases, a single private party is contesting the action of an agency, and the agency must appear and defend to \nassure the adversarial stance requisite to a case or controversy. In this case, however, sufficient adversity exists between \nthe union and the company to insure proper litigation without the participation of the OSHRC. The company's interest is \nadverse to the interests of the petitioner union. It can be expected to litigate vigorously to sustain the ruling of the OSHRC. \nThe union plainly has an interest in having the OSHRC decision reversed and the citation upheld, resulting in an invalidation \nof the company's Fetus Protection Policy and a fine assessed against the company. To require the OSHRC to appear as a \nparty would parallel requiring a district court to appear and defend its decision upon direct appeal. Just as a district court \nmay not defend its decision in the court of appeals, the OSHRC has no authority to defend its order before this court. \nIn this case, the motion to amend and reform the caption to delete the OSHRC and add the company as a respondent was \nfiled thirty-three days after the sixty-day statutory period to file a proper petition for review of the OSHRC decision had \nexpired. We are in agreement with other circuits that courts of appeals have no jurisdiction to grant relief from a final \nOSHRC order unless a petition for review is filed within the sixty-day period following the date the order becomes final. \nConsolidated Andy, Inc. v. Donovan, 642 F.2d 778, 779 (5th Cir. 1981); Midway Industrial Contractors, Inc. v. OSHRC, 616 \nF.2d 346, 347 (7th Cir. 1980); Hoerner Waldorf Pan American Bag Co., Inc. v. OSHRC, 614 F.2d 795, 796 (1st Cir. 1980). \n \nWe are not confronted, however, with this problem. In this case, the petition for review was timely filed but the petitioners \nmistakenly named the OSHRC as the respondent. Discovering its mistake, the union moved to amend its petition to name \nthe company as the proper respondent; by this time, the statutory sixty-day period had expired. We recognize that, in similar \ncircumstances, some courts[14] have held that the petition must be dismissed for failure to file timely. They have construed \nthe motion to amend as one which initiates a new proceeding outside of the sixty-day statutory period. We are unwilling to \nadopt so draconian an attitude, particularly in this instance. The jurisdictional issue raised by the company's motion to \ndismiss is one of first impression in this circuit. Because of the ambiguity in the statutory language and the split in the circuits \nover the proper respondent in actions brought to review an OSHRC decision, we decline to penalize the union for its mistake \nin naming the OSHRC as respondent. To do so would defeat unjustly the union's opportunity to prove its case. \nWe will consider this motion to amend the caption as one which relates back to the date on which the petition for review was \nfiled.[15] The company was put on notice of the petition for review within the sixty-day period by means of delivery of \nprocess. In addition, the company knew that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper respondent, the action \nwould have been brought against it. We accordingly deny the company's motion to dismiss for failure to name a proper \nrespondent and grant the union's motion to amend the caption to dismiss the OSHRC and add the company as a party \nrespondent. \n[1] The position derives the bulk of its support from a recent decision of the Third Circuit, Marshall v. Sun Petroleum Products Co., 622 F.2d \n1176, 1186 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1061, 101 S.Ct. 784, 66 L.Ed.2d 604 (1980). In that decision, the court sharply limited the \nscope of the employees or their union's party status in a proceeding initiated by the employer to the challenge of the length of the \nabatement period. It found that \"any challenge advanced by an employee is limited to an attack on the reasonableness of the abatement \nperiod.\" [2] If the Secretary finds no reasonable grounds for an inspection, he must notify the employees in writing. 29 U.S.C. § 657(f)(1). \n[3]  If, upon inspection, the Secretary determines no violation exists, he must provide for the informal review of his decision and he must \nfurnish to the employees who requested review a written statement of his reason for the disposition of the case. Id. § 657(f)(2). \n[4]  At least one other court has endorsed this interpretation. In Marshall v. OSHRC and OCAW, 635 F.2d 544, 552 (6th Cir. 1980), the \nSixth Circuit agreed with the position taken by Secretary of Labor and construed the Act \"as permitting employees having elected party \nstatus to participate in prehearing discovery and present their own witnesses.\" \nPursuant to the statutory mandate of 29 U.S.C. § 659(c), the commission has consistently held that \"[an] employee representative electing \nparty status has the right to litigate all the issues raised by the citation and complaint.\" Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 5 BNA OSHC \n1851, 1852 (1977). See also Gurney Industries, Inc., 1 BNA OSHC 1218 (1973). \n[5]  The House bill made no provision for employee participation before the commission, even with respect to abatement dates. This void \nexplains the House limit of judicial review to employers and the Secretary. Legislative History at 1191-92. In conference, the House \nconferees acceded to the Senate version which granted employees the right to initiate contest with respect to abatement dates and to \nparticipate as parties in employer-initiated contests. Id. \n[6]  Our holding, which concerns the rights of employees under the OSHA scheme, comports with procedures adopted by Congress for the \nsettlement of cases in other agencies. An example is the process implemented by the National Labor Relations Board. The General \nCounsel of the Labor Board decides whether or not to prosecute an unfair labor practice complaint. In most instances, the party that \nfiled the complaint — the charging party — cannot compel the General Counsel to prosecute the complaint nor can the private party \nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11594577190267440233&q=671+F.2d+643&hl=en&as_sdt=80000006&inst=9017564595980421810  7/8 \n\n5/25/2021  Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers v. OSHRC, 671 F. 2d 643 - Court of Appeals, Dist. of Columbia Circuit 1982 - Google Scholar \nprosecute before the Board. In Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 182, 87 S.Ct. 903, 912, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967), the Supreme Court held \nthat \"the Board's General Counsel has unreviewable discretion to refuse to institute an unfair labor practice complaint\" and that private \nparties cannot institute such proceedings. Under Labor Board rules, once the General Counsel has issued a complaint, the charging \nparty in the case is \"accorded formal recognition: he participates in the hearings as a `party'; he may call witnesses and cross-examine \nothers, may file exceptions to any order of the trial examiner....\" International Auto Workers Union v. Scofield, 382 U.S. 205, 219, 86 \nS.Ct. 373, 382, 15 L.Ed.2d 272 (1965). See also ILGWU v. NLRB, 501 F.2d 823 (D.C.Cir.1974); NLRB v. OCAW, 476 F.2d 1031 (1st \nCir. 1973); Concrete \nMaterials of Georgia v. NLRB, 440 F.2d 61 (5th Cir. 1971); NLRB v. Electrical Workers Local 357, 445 F.2d 1015 (9th Cir. 1971); Marine \nEngineers Beneficial Assn. v. NLRB, 202 F.2d 546 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 346 U.S. 819, 74 S.Ct. 32, 98 L.Ed. 345 (1953). The charging \nparty's inability to initiate a complaint before the Board does not bar the party from obtaining judicial review of an adverse Board ruling. In \nInternational Auto Workers, 382 U.S. at 219, 86 S.Ct. at 382, the Supreme Court held that if the Board determines that a complaint should \nbe dismissed, the charging party has a statutory right to judicial review \"as a person aggrieved.\" \n[7]  The Secretary's prosecutorial discretion to settle cases over employee objections flows from section 10(a) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. § \n659(a). If an employer does not timely contest a citation, it becomes an enforceable order \"not subject to review by any court or \nagency\" including the commission. Id. As a part of settlement of a contested citation, an employer withdraws its notice of contest thus \nousting the commission of jurisdiction. In either case, employees are only empowered to invoke commission jurisdiction to object to the \nreasonableness of the abatement period. \n[8]  The employee's right to appeal an adverse decision of an adjudicatory agency has never been interpreted as a review of the \nprosecutor's decision not to appeal. In many instances, appeals by private parties from the dismissal of an administrative action have \ngone forward without the filing of an appeal by the prosecutorial agency. See, e.g., Newspaper Drivers v. Detroit Newspaper Publishers \nAssn., 382 U.S. 374, 86 S.Ct. 543, 15 L.Ed.2d 423 (1966). The power to seek judicial review of a decision of an adjudicatory agency \nhas never been vested solely in the prosecutorial arm of that agency. \n[9]  In instances where the Secretary has not furnished the court with a statement of his intent, we will review the decision of the \ncommission. The fact that there is uncertainty as to whether the government will continue to prosecute the case upon remand does not \nmean that no justiciable controversy exists. See Dunlop v. Bachowski, 421 U.S. 560, 575, 95 S.Ct. 1851, 1861, 44 L.Ed.2d 377 (1975). \n[10] Marshall v. OSHRC and OCAW, supra (6th Cir. 1980); Marshall v. Sun Petroleum, supra (3d Cir. 1980); Dale Madden Construction, \nInc. v. Hodgson, 502 F.2d 278 (9th Cir. 1974). For example, in Dunlop v. Don L. Cooney, Inc., 3 BNA OSHC 1109 (9th Cir. 1975), the \nNinth Circuit expressly held that the OSHRC is \"not a proper party in response\" and ordered the commission's brief to be marked \n\"amicus\".

Sun Petroleum, supra 622 \nF.2d at 1179-1184. \n[12] The role of the commission closely parallels the functions of the Benefits Review Board. This court has treated the Board as an \nindependent adjudicator, similar to a district court, and has dismissed it as a respondent. McCord v. Benefits Review Board, 514 F.2d \n198 (D.C.Cir.1975). \n[13] We do not decide whether the employer is the only proper respondent in cases such as this one.
