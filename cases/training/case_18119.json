    "summary": "<p>This case concerns the placement of Muslims on federal terrorist watchlists.</p>\r\n<p>The United States government employs various terrorist watchlists to track terror suspects. These watchlists include the FBI's Terrorism Screening Database (TSDB) and the Transportation Security Agency's Quiet Skies program.</p>\r\n<p>Twenty Muslims filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on August 8, 2018. Defendants included a wide variety of federal agency officials, including the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. National Security Council, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Defense. Plaintiffs were represented by state branches of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and private counsel.</p>\r\n<p>All plaintiffs, most of whom were American citizens, had been placed on a federal terrorist watchlist. They alleged that inclusion on these watchlists greatly hampered many aspects of their lives, including volunteering at prisons and conduct pilgrimages to Mecca. They claimed violations of the First Amendment (freedom of expression and association), Second Amendment, Fourth Amendment (unreasonable search and seizures), Fifth Amendment (equal protection and due process), as well as the Constitution&rsquo;s non-delegation doctrine (Congress had not explicitly authorized the executive branch to operate these watchlists). Plaintiffs also alleged violations of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and the Administrative Procedure Act. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief and damages. The desired injunctive relief included removal of plaintiffs from watchlists as well as creating a legal mechanism for listees to receive notice and object to their placement. Judge Paula Xinis was assigned to the case.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim on December 14, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March 22, 2019, adding twenty additional plaintiffs, all of whom had also been placed on a terrorist watchlist. Additional claims further alleged an additional violation of the Fifth Amendment (self-incrimination). Plaintiffs also expanded their claims under RFRA, including allegations of pressure to become FBI informants and overall intrusions into religious practices. In response, defendants filed a new motion to dismiss on April 29, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>The court granted defendants' motion to dismiss in part on July 20, 2020, dismissing: claims relating to the TSA&rsquo;s Quiet Skies and Silent Partner programs, for lack of jurisdiction; the First Amendment claim related to right to association, for failure to aver direct and substantial interference; and the non-delegation doctrine claim, as undeveloped. 473 F.Supp.3d 479.</p>\r\n<p>The parties conducted discovery over the following months. Defendants renewed their motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on July 9, 2021.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

Relatedly, Plaintiffs allege that their list status has burdened \ntheir families and businesses, and inflicted other wide-ranging harms.   \nPlaintiffs have filed this mass action, averring that their inclusion in the TSDB and \nWatchlists violates (1) Procedural Due Process (Count I), (2) Substantive Due Process (Count \nII), (3) the Administrative Procedure Act (Counts III and IV), (4) the Equal Protection Clause \n(Count V), (5) the Fourth Amendment (Count VI), (6) the First Amendment (Count VII), (7) the \nFifth Amendment Right against self-incrimination (Count VIII),2 (8) The Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act (Counts X, XI, XII, and XIII), and (9) the non-delegation doctrine (Count XIV).    \n \n1 Plaintiff Khaled El Ali, a foreign national residing outside of the United States, voluntarily withdrew his \nclaims against Defendants.  ECF No. 68.  He is dismissed from this action. \n \n2 Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed Count IX (violation of the Second Amendment).  ECF No. 52 at 70.  \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 2 of 65\nPending before the Court is a Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 49-1), filed jointly by 26 \nDefendants3 who, with the exception of the Watchlisting Advisory Council (WLAC), each head \na federal agency and have been sued in their official capacities.  Defendants contend that this \nCourt lacks jurisdiction over the claims and, alternatively, that the claims fail as a matter of law.  \nOn June 18 and 26, 2020, the Court held a virtual hearing on the motion.  ECF Nos. 70, 72.  For \nthe reasons below, Defendants’ motion will be granted in part and denied in part.  \nI.  Background4 \nA.  The TSDB and Watchlist Infrastructure \nPlaintiffs have been the objects of an interagency watchlisting system, led by the WLAC.  \nThe WLAC is comprised of member agencies who are the defendants in this case.  According to \nPlaintiffs, the WLAC is: \n \n3 Defendants are William Barr, Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”); Christopher Wray, \nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; Charles H Kable, IV, Executive Assistant Director of the Terrorism \nScreening Center; Joseph Maguire, Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Office of the Director of \nNational Intelligence; John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, National Security \nDivision, DOJ; Beth A. Williams, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Policy, DOJ; Peter A. Winn, Acting \nChief Privacy and Civil Liberties Officer, Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties, DOJ; Daniel R. Coats, Director of \nNational Intelligence, Office of the Director of National Intelligence; Kirstjen Nielson, Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”); Kevin K. McAleenan, Acting Commissioner, U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection; David P. Pekoske, Administrator, Transportation Security Administration, DHS; L. \nFrancis Cissna, Director, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, DHS; Tracy Renaud, Deputy Director, U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement; Cameron Quinn, Officer, Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, DHS; \nDavid J. Glawe, Under Secretary, Office of Intelligence and Analysis, DHS; John Mitnick, General Counsel, DHS; \nJames W. McCament, Deputy Under Secretary, Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans, DHS; Jonathan R. Cantor, \nChief Privacy Officer, Privacy Office, DHS; Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State; Patrick M. \nShanahan, Acting Secretary of Defense, U.S. Department of Defense; General Paul M. Nakasone, Commander, U.S. \nCyber Command and Director, National Security Agency/Chief, Central Security Service, U.S. Department of \nDefense; Lieutenant General Robert P. Ashley, Jr., Director, Defense Intelligence Agency; Steven Mnuchin, \nSecretary of the Treasury, U.S. Department of Treasury; Ken Blanco, Director, Financial Crimes Enforcement \nNetwork, U.S. Department of the Treasury; Gina Haspel, Director, Central Intelligence Agency; and the \nWatchlisting Advisory Council. \n \nPlaintiffs also name several unidentified “John Doe” defendants, against whom they purport to state individual \ncapacity and/or Bivens claims.   None of these defendants have been identified or served, and the time period to do \nso has long passed.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m).  As such, all claims against the “John Doe” defendants are dismissed.  \n \n4 In reviewing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court accepts “the well-pled allegations of \nthe complaint as true,” and construes all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiffs.  Ibarra v. United States, 120 F.3d 472, 474 (4th Cir. 1997).   \n2 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 3 of 65\n[A] government entity that promulgates decisions regarding all policies, \nprocedures, practices and instructions pertaining to the federal terrorist watchlist, \nincluding, but not limited to: (1) watchlist nomination and removal procedures; \n(2) specific criteria used to nominate persons to the TSDB; (3) redress procedures; \n(4) vetting of information used to nominate persons to the TSDB; and, (5) \ndissemination of a person’s designation in the TSDB to state and local authorities, \ncourts, foreign governments, private corporations, private contractors, airlines, \ngun sellers, financial institutions, the captains of sea-faring vessels, and others. \n \nECF No. 48 ¶ 82.  It is through the WLAC’s interagency watchlisting system that Defendants \nhave identified Plaintiffs as worthy of scrutiny and placement in the TSDB and Watchlists, to \ninclude the No Fly List, the Selectee List, and the Expanded Selectee List.  Id. ¶ 3.  \nThe WLAC operates by consensus and each member agency retains decision-making \nauthority and veto power over all WLAC decisions.  See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 57, 64, 69.  The member \nagencies play a variety of roles.  Some nominate individuals to Watchlists, see, e.g., id. ¶¶ 60, \n61, 63, 68, 74, some accept nominations, see id. ¶¶ 59, 54, and some disseminate Watchlist \ninformation to “state and local authorities, courts, foreign governments, private corporations, \nprivate contractors, airlines, gun sellers, financial institutions, the captains of sea-faring vessels, \nand others.”  See e.g., id. ¶¶ 57, 79, 80.  Some conduct frontline screening of Watchlist listees, \nsee, e.g., id. ¶¶ 65, 66, 67,68, 75, while others develop policies for the frontline screening \nagencies.  Id. ¶ 73, 74.  The WLAC also reviews and approves by consensus written Watchlisting \nGuidance (WLG).  ECF No. 67-1 at 5–6.  The WLG governs the Watchlisting process and is \nconsidered government policy once adopted.  Id. \nThe TSDB functions as a “master repository for suspected international and domestic \nterrorist records.”  Id. ¶ 93.  The TSDB is developed and maintained by the Terrorist Screening \nCenter (“TSC”), which was established in 2003 by Attorney General John Ashcroft to \nconsolidate the government’s approach to terrorism screening.  Id.  The TSC itself is a multi-\nagency center, administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and consisting of the \n3 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 4 of 65\nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”), the National Counterterrorism Center (“NCTC”), \nthe Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection \n(“CBP”).  Id. ¶ 59; ECF No. 48-6 at 3 (“Overview of the U.S. Government’s Watchlisting \nProcess and Procedures as of January 2018”).   \nThe WLAC and the TSDB work as follows: agency members of WLAC “nominate” \nindividuals to the TSDB.  ECF No. 48-6 at 4; ECF No. 48 ¶¶ 60, 61, 63, 68, 74.  The TSC \nreviews the individual nominee and, if he or she is “reasonably suspected of being a known or \nsuspected terrorist,” adds the individual to the TSDB.  ECF No. 48-6 at 4, 6; ECF No. 48 ¶ 94.  \nIn particular, an individual is placed in the TSDB based on: \narticulable intelligence or information which, based on the totality of the circumstances \n  and, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, creates a reasonable \n  suspicion that the individual is engaged, has been engaged, or intends to engage, in \n  conduct constituting in preparation for, in aid or in furtherance of, or related to, terrorism \n  and/or terrorist activities. \n \nECF No. 48-6 at 5.  This inclusion standard, according to the Second Amended Complaint \n(“Amended Complaint”), is so broad and amorphous as to render it useless in identifying known \nor suspected terrorists.  ECF No. 48 ¶ 220.  In practice, TSDB inclusion is driven not by \nsuspected terrorism but by an individual’s race, ethnicity, country of origin, religion, religious \npractices, languages spoken, family, mere associations,5 travel history, and social media \nhistory—criteria determined by WLAC.  Id. ¶¶ 82, 95, 199.  Approximately 99% of all proposed \nadditions to the TSDB are accepted each year, and between 2009 and 2016, the number of \nindividuals added to the TSDB has tripled.  Id. ¶ 14.   \nThe TSDB has grown to over one million people whose inclusion, say Plaintiffs, has \n \n5 The close association with someone already in the TSDB may itself be the catalyst for placement on the \nTSDB and Watchlists.  See, e.g., id. ¶ 896 (Faatimah Knight placed on TSDB and Watchlists due to association with \nher husband Hicham Hall). \n4 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 5 of 65\ndone nothing to improve national security.  Id.  A DHS-funded study performed by the \nUniversity of Maryland assessed the efficacy of the TSDB and concluded that of the \napproximately 250 terrorist acts committed inside the United States over the last decade, none of \nthe offenders were included in the database.  Id. ¶¶ 179–80.  The study demonstrates that the \nWatchlisting system would perform similarly if persons were included in TSDB by random \nselection rather than using the existing inclusion criteria.  Id. ¶ 188.  \nThe TSDB acts as a feeder for placement on the Expanded Selectee List, Selectee List, \nand No Fly List—Watchlists related to air travel.  Id. ¶ 97.  Everyone in the TSDB is \nautomatically also on the Expanded Selectee List if minimum identifiers for the person are \navailable.  Id. ¶ 98.  The Selectee List includes individuals for whom undefined “derogatory \ninformation” exists and for whom the government suspects association or affiliation with a \nforeign or domestic terrorist organization, or other association with terrorist activities.  Id. ¶ 99.  \nBoarding passes for Expanded Selectee List or Selectee List individuals have “SSSS” printed on \nthem for ease of identification among airline and airport employees, agents, and screeners.  \nConsequently, those listees are routinely subjected to extra screening at airports.  Id. ¶ 100.   \n A person makes the No Fly List if, in addition to non-specific “derogatory information,” \nthe government suspects the individual presents a threat of committing an act of terrorism in the \nUnited States, against an international United States government facility, or with respect to an \naircraft, or if the individual is capable of carrying out a violent act of terrorism.  Id. ¶ 101.  \nPersons on the No Fly List are prevented altogether from boarding an aircraft that flies through \nUnited States airspace.  Id. ¶ 102.   \nStill other lists exist that are not dependent on inclusion in the TSDB.  The “Quiet Skies” \nand “Silent Partner” lists are developed and maintained by the TSA and operate in parallel to the \n5 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 6 of 65\nTSDB.  Id. ¶ 112.  Quiet Skies and Silent Partner lists may cross-reference with the TSDB and \nmay be used to help identify individuals whose backgrounds result in nomination to the TSDB.  \nId. ¶¶ 95 n. 2, 113, 114.  Those identified through the Quiet Skies and Silent Partners programs \nare surveilled at the airport and in the air, and their information is shared with foreign carriers \nand governments.  Id. ¶ 112, 115.  \nAny TSDB listee may be blocked from crossing U.S. land borders or from boarding \ninternational flights headed to the United States.  Id. ¶ 103.  CPB refers to those in the TSDB as \n“Armed and Dangerous,” subjecting them to secondary inspection or flagging them as potential \nterrorists in automatic alerts sent to officers.  Id. ¶ 104.  The secondary inspection often includes \nadvanced electronic searches.  Id. ¶ 105. \nMore generally, state and local authorities, courts, foreign governments, private \ncorporations, private contractors, airlines, gun sellers, financial institutions, and captains of sea-\nfaring vessels have access to the TSDB.  Id. ¶¶ 82, 154.  In addition, a subset of the TSDB is \nplaced in a “Known or Suspected Terrorist” (“KST”) file that is distributed to the National Crime \nInformation Center (NCIC) for access by more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies and \n100,000 law enforcement officers.  Id. ¶ 106.   \nB.  Plaintiffs in the TSDB and on Watchlists \nMost Plaintiffs, of whom all are Muslim, allege placement in the TSDB and related \nWatchlists.  Id. ¶¶ 119, 232.6  Plaintiffs often surmise on which lists they are included, but rarely \nreceive confirmation.  Nor do they know why they are in the TSDB or on Watchlists.  None have \nbeen arrested, charged, or convicted of any type of terrorism-related offense.  Id. ¶ 234.  A few \n \n6 Defendants object to Doe Plaintiffs proceeding anonymously without leave of Court.  ECF No. 49-1 at 41 \nn.9.  The Court grants Plaintiffs 14 days to move for the Doe Plaintiffs to proceed pseudonymously.  If no motion is \nfiled, the Doe Plaintiffs shall be dismissed without further consideration.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 7 of 65\nother Plaintiffs are family members of TSDB Plaintiffs, and primarily allege harms flowing from \nmembership in the Quiet Skies and Silent Partner programs.  Id. ¶ 119. \nPlaintiffs allege, collectively, a host of injuries resulting from the above-described \nsurveillance programs.  The Court summarizes those related to air and land travel, as well as \nbroadly applicable consequential harms. \n1.  Air Travel  \n Watchlisted Plaintiffs are routinely selected for screening, searches, and questioning at \nairports beyond that of the normal traveler.  Plaintiffs first must be cleared by airline \nadministrators and TSA at check-in.  Next, they are screened and searched at the security \ncheckpoint, and then again at the gate prior to boarding.  Such screenings include full-body \npatdowns, chemical residue testing, extensive searches of personal belongings, and \ninterrogations.  See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 325–34 (Jardaneh); ¶¶ 424–43 (Abdurrashid); ¶¶ 459–78 (M. \nParyavi); ¶¶ 498–502 (H. Wehelie); ¶¶ 655–59 (El-Shahat); ¶¶ 1212–18 (Riad).   \nAlmost all searches are conducted in front of travel companions and other passengers.  \nPlaintiffs Hicham Hall and Faatimah Knight, after undergoing extensive public screening at the \nsecurity checkpoint, were subjected to additional chemical testing and protracted pat downs at \nthe gate and were publicly photographed by agents as they boarded their flight.  Id. ¶¶ 922–25.  \nA TSA agent made Mustafa El-Shahat “stand with his hands against the wall” in front of fellow \ntravelers, and “then kicked [him] to force his legs apart, causing him pain.”  Id. ¶ 661.  \nPlaintiffs’ travel companions typically receive similar treatment simply because they \naccompany Plaintiffs.  See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 444, 479, 552–585, 686, 1083.  Imam Farid Sulayman’s \ndisabled, seventy-eight-year-old mother was subjected to patdowns, chemical testing, and \ninterrogations because she was traveling with her son.  Id. ¶¶ 686–90, 697–98.  Faraz Siddiqui’s \n7 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 8 of 65\ntwo-months-old baby was screened, id. ¶ 1004, and the children who are old enough to talk, such \nas Anisa Mujanovic’s son and daughter, had to answer questions about their mother.  Id. ¶ 1154–\n55.   Fourteen-year-old Mia El Ali was patted down and questioned, and her body subjected to \nchemical testing, both at the security checkpoint and in front of other passengers at the gate, \nwhile en route to visit her father.  Id. ¶ 256–57.     \nEven after Plaintiffs are cleared at security checkpoints and the gate, they continue to \nendure adverse treatment due to their status.  Alaa Abunijem, his wife, and their two young \nchildren, were forcibly removed from their flight because, according to airport officials, \n“Americans did not want them to travel on the flight.”  Id. ¶¶ 1315–17.  On other occasions, \nundercover agents surveilled Plaintiffs en route to their final destinations.  See, e.g., id. ¶ 334 \n(Jardeneh); ¶¶ 1116–19 (Muminov).  Upon arrival, agents sometimes removed certain Plaintiffs \nfrom the plane in front of fellow passengers.  See e.g., id. ¶ 999 (Siddiqui); ¶ 1513 (Al-Sahlani).  \nOn Hicham Hall’s flight, the pilot instructed all passengers to present their passports to the CBP \nofficers.  Id. ¶ 909.  Once CPB officers identified Hall, they announced publicly “[w]e got him” \nand then proceeded to take Hall off the plane and to a private room.  Id. ¶ 910.  There, CBP \nofficers questioned him about the purposes of his trip, copied his Arab language books, and \nseized and searched his laptop and phone.  Id. ¶¶ 910–14.  \nFBI agents or CPB officers often detain and interrogate Plaintiffs during their travel.  \nPlaintiffs are pressed about work and travel history, Islamic practices and culture, associations \nwith persons in Muslim-majority countries, social media usage, personal religious beliefs and \npractices, topics of study, political opinions, and mosque attendance.  See, e.g., id. ¶ 485 (M. \nParyavi); ¶¶ 635–41 (Mohallim); ¶¶ 646, 650 (El-Shahat); ¶ 941 (Knight); ¶ 1279 (Kamel); ¶ \n1519–20 (Al-Sahlani).  Further, agents often search Plaintiffs’ phones and laptops, confiscate the \n8 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 9 of 65\ndevices, and download their contents.  See, e.g., id. ¶ 648 (El-Shahat); ¶ 1312 (Abunijem); ¶ \n1348 (Hijaz); ¶ 1491 (Kadoumi).  The devices are sometimes not returned for weeks, months, or \nat all.  See, e.g., id. ¶ 761 (Suliman).  \nBecause these procedures are lengthy, Plaintiffs often miss their flights.  Many Plaintiffs \nhaving experienced such delays in the past, and so they make sure to arrive at the airport several \nhours in advance of their scheduled departure.  Nonetheless, the extensive delays result in missed \nflights.  See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 663, 908.  In one instance, Mohamed Albadawi missed four flights on the \nsame trip.  Id. ¶ 868. See also id.  ¶¶ 501–13 (Hawa Wehelie and sister Fatima Wehelie subjected \nto four-hour interrogation and, after missing a connecting flight, re-interrogated the following \nday before boarding their new flight).   \n To avoid such invasive searches and interrogations, Plaintiffs have chosen to travel by \nmeans other than air or not at all.  As a result, Plaintiffs have lost business opportunities and have \nmissed important family gatherings and other celebrations.  See, e.g., id. ¶ 337 (Jardeneh); ¶ \n446–48 (Abdurrashid).  \nNo Fly List Plaintiffs have been denied air travel altogether.  See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 600, 607, \n617 (Mohallim); ¶¶ 814, 818 (Sehwail); ¶¶ 1023, 1041 (Bosnic); ¶1432 (Shirwa).  Mahad \nMohallim was twice denied from boarding a flight from Doha, Qatar back to the United States.  \nId. ¶¶ 587–643.  It would be over a year until he and his mother were able to return home.  Id. ¶ \n616.  Nader Sehwail, too, could not return to the United States for a month, despite the aid of \ncounsel and multiple exchanges with the U.S. embassy.  Id. ¶¶ 812–37.  Even when he was \nfinally allowed to fly into the United States, he was immediately denied boarding for a domestic \nflight and had to rent a car and drive the last leg of his journey.  Id. ¶ 840.  As of the filing of this \nlawsuit, seventy-one-year-old Hassan Shirwa was stranded in Kenya, unable to return home.  Id. \n9 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 10 of 65\n¶ 1433.  \n2.  Land Travel \nCertain Plaintiffs are also subjected to similar searches, screening, and interrogations \nwhen they enter the United States at a land border.  CBP officers have ordered Plaintiffs and \ntheir companions out of their car, sometimes at gunpoint, where they are then patted down and \nquestioned at length while held in confinement.  See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 309–13 (Jardaneh undergoing \nfour-hour interrogation and invasive pat down); ¶¶ 493–94 (H. Wehelie); ¶¶ 664–67 (El-Shahat).  \nMirrakhmat Muminov, returning from a business trip in Canada, was ordered out of his car by \ngunpoint by several CBP officers, handcuffed, and detained in a cold cell for several hours.  Id. \n¶¶ 1096–99.  He was then interrogated—for four hours—about his religious views and mosque \nattendance, as well as subjected to a pat down, finger printing, hair analysis, iris scan, mouth \nswab, and search of his belongings.  Id. ¶¶ 1100–105.  He has, as a result, stopped traveling to \nCanada for business.  Id. ¶ 1106.  \nAs for searches and seizures, agents take Plaintiffs’ portable electronic devices (phones \nand laptops) and in some instances download electronic data, all without a warrant or consent.  \nSee, e.g., id. ¶¶ 316 (Jardaneh); ¶ 495 (Wehelie); ¶ 673, 680 (Sulayman).  Agents sometimes \nreturn devices after a couple of days, id. ¶ 319 (Jardaneh), or a couple of months.  Id. ¶ 577 \n(Wehelies).  \nCertain Plaintiffs also have been approached to act as informants in exchange for being \npulled off Watchlists.  During Hall’s detention at the border, the FBI offered to streamline his \ntravel and remove him from all Watchlists if he assisted them.  Id. ¶¶ 934–35.  Hall understood \nthat acting in such capacity would require that he associate under false pretenses with religious \nleaders to gather information for the FBI.  Id. ¶ 936.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 11 of 65\n3.  Other Harms from TSDB and Watchlist Placement \nCollectively, Plaintiffs correlate placement in the TSDB and Watchlists with a wide \nvariety of deprivations.  Plaintiffs aver that because their placement in the TSDB and watchlists \nis shared liberally, their bank accounts have been closed, see, e.g., id. ¶ 1007–09 (Siddiqui); ¶ \n1161 (Mujanovic); ¶ 1205 (Hachem).  Other Plaintiffs have been denied government \naccommodations such as membership in TSA PreCheck and Global Entry, both of which allow \nfor expedited screenings at ports of entry.  See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 483–84 (M. Paryavi), ¶ 764 (Suliman); \n¶¶ 972–79 (E. Paryavi).  Several Plaintiffs have experienced delays in immigration proceedings \nfor their loved ones.  See e.g., id. ¶ 669 (immigration application for El-Shahat’s wife delayed \nover three years); ¶ 1124 (Muminov’s mother’s visitor visa revoked).   \nPlaintiffs also contend that placement results in receiving the undeserved moniker of \n“known or suspected terrorist.”  They are identified by the “SSSS” printed on their boarding \npasses and are searched openly in front of family and friends.  As a result, no one will travel with \nthem.  See, e.g., id. ¶ 891 (Albadawi); ¶ 1005 (Siddiqui); ¶¶ 1177–94 (Hachem); ¶ 1421 \n(Elamin); ¶ 1156 (after experiencing interrogations due to their mother’s list status, Mujanovic’s \nson and daughter told her they “never wanted to travel with her again”).   \nFor some Plaintiffs, this shunning has resulted in clear loss of business opportunity.  Fadi \nSuliman had been repeatedly screened and searched in front of his employees, a customer, and a \nvendor.  Id. ¶¶ 718–26.  His Muslim travel companions withstood similar treatment.  Id.  As a \nresult, Suliman missed his flight and was forced to travel separately from his companions.  Id. ¶ \n731.  At his next stop, he was delayed again because of additional screening, and therefore \nmissed several meetings.  Id. ¶ 737.  The same thing happened on the return trip.  Consequently, \nhis travel companions—his employees, customer, and vendor—vowed to never again travel with \n11 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 12 of 65\nhim.  Id. ¶ 740.   \nPlaintiffs have also lost jobs, accounts, and contracts after repeatedly missing flights \nbecause they were subjected to protracted searches and interrogations.  See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 340–41 \n(Jardaneh); ¶ 1382 (Soueidan); ¶ 1537 (Al-Sahlani); ¶ 1192 (Hachem).  Farid Sulyaman, an uber \ndriver, could not pick up his passenger at a military base; he was instead handcuffed and \ndetained for an hour.  Id. ¶¶ 702–13.  Khalil Thadi, similarly, could not access a military base to \nprovide a work estimate.  Id. ¶ 950–53.  When he arrived for his job, he was detained at the \nentrance gate, questioned, photographed, and ultimately denied access.  Id.  Not surprisingly, \nThadi lost the government subcontract.  Id.  Zijad Bosnic, a truck driver, had his Transportation \nWorker Identification Credential (TWIC) suspended such that he can no longer complete many \nof his work routes.  Id. ¶ 1046.  Some have simply forgone jobs that require travel.  See, e.g., id. \n¶ 1011 (Siddiqui). \nC.  Limited Recourse for TSBD-Watchlisted Plaintiffs  \n \nPlaintiffs have found limited avenues to redress erroneous placement on the TSDB or \nWatchlists.  The only extra-judicial redress procedure lies with the Department of Homeland \nSecurity’s Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (“DHS TRIP”).  DHS TRIP was established to \nassist in resolving travel complaints, including those related to Watchlist status.  Id. ¶ 15.    \nWhen an individual in the TSDB files a DHS TRIP inquiry, the inquiry is forwarded to \nTSC for review.  Id. ¶ 212; ECF No. 48-6 at 9.  TSC may then contact the NCTC and the agency \nthat nominated the individual to the TSDB to assist in its review.  ECF No. 48-6 at 9.  TSC next \ndecides whether to keep or remove the individual from the TSDB and sends the results to DHS \nTRIP.  Id.; ECF No. 48 ¶ 217.  DHS TRIP, in turn, sends a standard form letter that neither \nconfirms nor denies the individual’s Watchlist status.  Id. ¶ 217.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 13 of 65\nHowever, in 2015, and in response to litigation, DHS TRIP procedures were revised as to \npersons on the No Fly List. 7   Under the revised procedures, TSC after review may remove the \nindividual from the No Fly List.  ECF No. 48-6 at 10.  If the TSC decides not to remove the \nindividual, the TSC provides such a recommendation to the TSA administrator who, in turn, \ndecides either to remove or maintain the individual on the No Fly List, or to seek additional \ninformation from the TSC.  Id.  In the end, the TSA Administrator provides the individual with a \nfinal determination.  Id.  If the person remains on the No Fly List, TSA states the reasons for \ncontinued placement unless doing so would compromise national security or law enforcement \ninterests.  ECF No. 48 ¶ 218; ECF No. 48-6 at 10.8  According to Plaintiffs, since 2015, TSA has \nnot processed a single No Fly List determination under its new DHS TRIP procedure.  ECF No. \n48 ¶ 222.  \nIn practice, DHS TRIP “refuses to discuss specific facts and refuses to even process \nmany redress complaints[,]” including for those on the No Fly List.  ECF No. 48 ¶ 15.  For those \nPlaintiffs who have filed DHS TRIP inquiries, some have simply received a letter which includes \nonly a “redress control number.”  Plaintiffs have often waited months or years for additional \ninformation, but none has been provided.  See, e.g., id. ¶ 339 (Jardeneh receiving letter in \nSeptember 2017); ¶ 964 (Thadi receiving letter on March 13, 2018); ¶ 455 (Aburrashid); ¶ 487 \n(M. Paryavi); ¶ 586 (Noor); ¶ 879 (Albadawi).  The only two Plaintiffs who received \nconfirmation that they are on the No Fly List, Bosnic and Shirwa, have since been removed from \n \n  7 The 2015 revisions do not affect all other inquiries related to TSDB and Selectee Lists or Quiet \nSkies/Silent Partner lists.  ECF No. 48 ¶ 220; see also ECF No. 48-6; ECF No. 49-6 at 9–10.   \n \n8 Although the Amended Complaint alleges that the 2015 revisions require that No Fly List complaints \nreceive confirmation from DHS TRIP of their status, ECF No. 48 ¶ 218, the government overview document states \notherwise.  See ECF No. 48-6 (“In certain instances, however, a U.S. person denied boarding because of their \npresence on the No Fly list may be apprised of their status through the DHS TRIP process.  When a U.S. citizen or \nLawful Permanent Resident applying for redress is, in fact, on the No Fly List, DHS TRIP may inform the applicant \nof his or her status on the list.) (emphases added). \n13 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 14 of 65\nthe list during the pendency of this case.  ECF Nos. 49-2, 49-3.  Still others have received no \nresponse at all.  See, e.g., id. ¶ 1495 (Kadoumi).  \nII.  Standards of Review \nDefendants lodge an array of challenges, some of which implicate the Court’s subject \nmatter jurisdiction, while others attack the merits of the claims.  The applicable review standard \nis set forth for each.  \nA.  Subject Matter Jurisdictional Challenges, Federal Rule 12(b)(1) \nRule 12(b)(1) motions challenge a court’s authority to hear the matter.  See Jones v. \nCalvert Group, Ltd., 551 F.3d 297, 300–01 (4th Cir. 2009).  The plaintiff bears the burden of \nestablishing subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.  Lovern v. Edwards, \n190 F.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir. 1999).  In determining whether jurisdiction exists, “the court may \nlook beyond the pleadings and the jurisdictional allegations of the complaint and view whatever \nevidence has been submitted on the issue.”  Khoury v. Meserve, 268 F. Supp. 2d 600, 606 (D. \nMd. 2003) (internal marks and citation omitted).  Where a defendant contends that the complaint \n“simply fails to allege facts upon which subject matter jurisdiction can be based,” the Court \nconstrues the factual allegations as true and most favorably to the plaintiff.  Adams v. Bain, 697 \nF.2d 1213, 1219 (4th Cir. 1982).  Whether the Court retains subject matter jurisdiction must be \ndecided before reaching the merits of the case.  Jones v. Am. Postal Workers Union, 192 F.3d \n417, 422 (4th Cir. 1999). \nMotions to dismiss brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) may proceed either as a facial \nchallenge, asserting that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to establish subject \nmatter jurisdiction, or a factual challenge, asserting “that the jurisdictional allegations of the \ncomplaint [are] not true.”  Kerns v. United States, 585 F.3d 187, 192 (4th Cir. 2009) (citation \n14 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 15 of 65\nomitted); see also Richardson v. Mayor & City Council of Baltimore, No. A. RDB-13-1924, \n2014 WL 60211, at *2 (D. Md. Jan. 7, 2014).  Where Defendants mount a facial challenge, \nPlaintiffs are “afforded the same procedural protection as [they] would receive under a \nRule 12(b)(6) consideration” and the court must “assume the truthfulness of the facts alleged.”  \nKerns, 585 F.3d at 192–93 (citations omitted).  A factual challenge, in comparison, allows the \nCourt to “go beyond the complaint, conduct evidentiary proceedings, and resolve the disputed \njurisdictional facts.”  Id. at 193.  In this case, Defendants attack Plaintiffs’ allegations on both \nfronts and the Court therefore uses both standards. \nB.  Merits Challenges, Federal Rule 12(b)(6) \nA motion brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) tests the sufficiency of the complaint.  \nPresley v. City of Charlottesville, 464 F.3d 480, 483 (4th Cir. 2006).  The Court accepts “the \nwell-pled allegations of the complaint as true,” and construes all facts and reasonable inferences \nmost favorably to the plaintiff.  See Ibarra v. United States, 120 F.3d 472, 474 (4th Cir. 1997).  \nTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint’s factual allegations “must be enough to raise a right \nto relief above the speculative level on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are \ntrue (even if doubtful in fact).”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (citations \nomitted).   \nIn ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court generally may not consider extrinsic \nevidence.  Zak v. Chelsea Therapeutics, Int’l, Ltd., 780 F.3d 597, 606 (4th Cir. 2015) \n(“Consideration of extrinsic documents by a court during the pleading stage of litigation \nimproperly converts the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.”).  However, \nthe Court may consider documents attached to a motion if “integral to and explicitly relied on in \nthe complaint.”  Id. at 606–07 (quoting Phillips v. LCI Int’l, Inc., 190 F.3d 609, 618 (4th Cir. \n15 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 16 of 65\n1999)); see also Marshall v. Anne Arundel Cty., Md, No. ELH-18-74, 2019 WL 568676, *5 (D. \nMd. Feb. 12, 2019).  Moreover, the Court may take judicial notice of “matters of public \nrecord” without converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.  See \nGoldfarb v. Mayor & City Council of Baltimore, 791 F.3d 500, 508 (4th Cir. 2015). \nIII.  Subject Matter Jurisdiction  \nA.  Standing  \nDefendants argue that all Plaintiffs lack standing as to certain defendants, and that certain \nPlaintiffs lack standing as to all defendants.  A court retains jurisdiction only where the plaintiff \nhas standing to bring the claim.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  \nPursuant to Article III of the United States Constitution, federal courts are of limited jurisdiction, \nhearing only live “cases” and “controversies.”  Id. at 559; U.S. Const. art. III, § 2.  A legal action \nmeets the case-or-controversy requirement where the “questions [are] presented in an adversary \ncontext.”  Massachusetts v. E.P.A., 549 U.S. 497, 516 (2007) (quoting Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. \n83, 95 (1968)) (internal quotation marks omitted).   \nFor a case to satisfy the case-or-controversy requirement, the plaintiff must have “such a \npersonal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which \nsharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination.”  \nMassachusetts, 549 U.S. at 517.  Each Plaintiff must demonstrate “(1) . . . an ‘injury in fact’ that \nis (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) \nthe injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as \nopposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”  \nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180–81 (2000). \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 17 of 65\n1.  Standing as to WLAC Agency Defendants  \nThe WLAC Agency Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to bring any claim \nagainst them because Plaintiffs have failed to allege both traceable and redressable injuries.  ECF \nNo. 49-1 at 41–45.  Although these Defendants do not dispute membership in the WLAC, they \ncontend that the majority of them play no role in the creation or management of the Watchlisting \nsystem sufficient to confer standing.  Accordingly, the Court focuses its standing analysis on \nwhether the claimed injuries are both traceable and redressable as to all WLAC Agency \nDefendants. \nTraceability and redressability are best addressed jointly as “they rise or fall together.”  \nFriends for Ferrell Parkway, LLC v. Stasko, 282 F.3d 315, 323 n. 1 (4th Cir. 2002).  Traceability \nrequires plaintiffs to aver plausibly that their injury “was caused by the challenged conduct of the \ndefendant, and not by the independent actions of third parties not before the court.”  Stasko, 282 \nF.3d at 320 (citing Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., 204 F.3d 149, \n154 (4th Cir.2000) and Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560).  Redressability requires that the requested relief \nas to the challenged defendants is “likely, and not merely speculative . . . [to] remedy the \nplaintiff’s injury.”  Id.  (citations omitted).  However, “no explicit guarantee of redress to a \nplaintiff is required to demonstrate a plaintiff’s standing.”  Equity in Athletics, Inc. v. Dep’t of \nEduc., 639 F.3d 91, 100 (4th Cir.2011).   \nWhere, as here, standing turns on involvement with policymaking, a plaintiff must show \nthat the defendant is involved in the promulgation or enforcement of such policies, or otherwise \nexerts control over the disputed provision.  See, e.g., Kitchen v. Herbert, 755 F.3d 1193, 1201 \n(10th Cir. 2014); Nat’l Ass’n for Advancement of Multijurisdiction Practice, (NAAMJP) v. \nHowell, 851 F.3d 12, 17 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (standing absent where plaintiff “failed to identify any \n17 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 18 of 65\nrole whatsoever of the Attorney General” in enforcement of challenged rule); Calzone v. Hawley, \n866 F.3d 866, 870 (8th Cir. 2017) (plaintiff lacked standing to sue entities without enforcement \nauthority as to challenged provision). \nPlaintiffs assert that the WLAC as a whole “promulgates decisions regarding all policies, \nprocedures, practices and instructions pertaining to the federal terrorist watchlist,” ECF No. 48 ¶ \n82, and that each WLAC member has “decision-making authority” and “veto power” over those \ndecisions.  See id. ¶¶ 57–81.  Defendants respond that the WLAC retains no such authority.  \nRather, the member agencies operate by consensus to review and adopt the WLG, which in turn \nbecomes the policy governing the TSDB and Watchlisting system.   ECF No. 49-1 at 43; ECF \nNo. 67-1 ¶ 3.  According to Defendants, WLAC and its members “address (a) questions from \nparticipant agencies about how specific provisions of the [WLG] should be interpreted or \nimplemented, (b) technical issues arising from the exchange of TSDB information between and \namong participant agencies, and (c) whether portions of the WLG should be changed or \nupdated.”  ECF No. 67-1 ¶ 6.  Absent objections from the National Security Council, the WLG \nthen becomes government policy.  Id. ¶ 9. \nThe facts in this respect are hotly contested and invoke matters of first impression.9  At \nthis stage, the Court must allow further factual development to resolve the scope of the WLAC \nAgency Defendants’ participation in the TSDB and Watchlists.  See Kerns, 585 F.3d at 193 \n(recognizing standing may require factual development to resolve jurisdictional question).  The \nCourt is centrally concerned that WLAC Agency Defendants’ role in approving WLG changes as \n“policy” is sufficient to confer standing.  This is because, as averred, the WLG governs the \n \n9 Although individuals subjected to Watchlist restrictions have pursued similar litigation in other districts, \nsee, e.g., Elhady v. Piehota, 303 F. Supp. 3d 453, 457 (E.D. Va. 2017), none have named as defendants the WLAC \nand all its member agencies. \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 19 of 65\nTSDB and Watchlist inclusion criteria, as well as dissemination of the same.  Thus, the Court \nwill not dismiss the WLAC Agency Defendants at this time.  The Court, however, will entertain \na streamlined discovery plan, tightly focused on the WLAC’s role in management of the TSDB \nand Watchlists, to include promulgating WLG.  The motion to dismiss on this basis is denied.  \n2.  Standing for Rami Khaled El Ali \nDefendants urge the Court to dismiss Plaintiff Rami Khaled El Ali from the suit because \nhe has not alleged inclusion on the TSDB or any inhibition of travel whatsoever.  ECF No. 49-1 \nat 49.  Rami is the son of former Plaintiff Khaled El Ali who has voluntarily withdrawn from this \nsuit after the State Department granted his tourist visa.  ECF No. 68.  Rami has pleaded \nconstitutional injuries arising from Defendants’ initial refusal to admit his father into the United \nStates.  ECF No. 48 ¶ 276.  See Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2416 (2018) (“a person’s \ninterest in being united with his relatives is sufficiently concrete and particularized to form the \nbasis of an Article III injury”).  Because Khaled El Ali may now return to the United States, and \nRami only sought to redress the injury flowing from his inability to see his father in the United \nStates, Rami no longer maintains any cognizable injury.  ECF No. 68.  Defendants’ motion is \ngranted as to him.  \nB.  Other Jurisdictional Challenges  \n \n1.  Lack of Jurisdiction Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 46110 \n  Defendants next contend that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the \nstatutory jurisdictional channeling provision, 49 U.S.C. § 46110 (“Section 46110”) for certain of \nPlaintiffs’ claims implicating DHS TRIP redress procedures.  Section 46110 provides that any \nperson who seeks to challenge “an order” issued by “the Administrator of the [TSA] with respect \nto security duties and powers designated to be carried out by the Administrator of the [TSA]” \n19 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 20 of 65\nmust first petition for review in the Circuit Court in which the person lives or works.  49 U.S.C. \n§ 46110(a).  Section 46110 expressly mandates that federal courts of appeals retain exclusive \njurisdiction to review “orders” issued by the TSA.  See Long v. Barr, No. 1:15-CV-1642, 2020 \nWL 1644570, at *9 (E.D. Va. Apr. 2, 2020).  What constitutes a TSA order, however, is less than \nstraightforward.    \n  On this question, Long v. Barr provides important guidance.  Id.  Long recognized that an \n“order” under Section 46110 is any “final disposition of the matter” issued by TSA.  2020 WL \n1644570, at *9 (citing Blitz v. Napolitano, 700 F.3d 733, 740 (4th Cir. 2012) and Alexandria v. \nHelms, 728 F.2d 643, 646 (4th Cir. 1984)).  Long also recognized such an order may encompass \nbroader constitutional challenges to TSA’s actions, id. at *8 (citing Blitz, 700 F.3d at 741), as \nwell as TSA procedures and protocols that represent the TSA’s final disposition.  Id at *9 (citing \nBlitz, 700 F.3d at 740).  See also Amerijet Intn’l, Inc. v. U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, et al., \n43 F. Supp. 3d 4, 13–14 (D.D.C. 2014) (finding a TSA Security Directive to be an “order” as it \nwas the consummation of the agency’s decision-making process.).  However, for an order to be \nsubject to Section 46110’s jurisdictional channeling, it must be the “consummation of TSA’s \nindependent action,” and not action undertaken by any other agencies such as the TSC.  Long, \n2020 WL 1644570, at *12 (emphasis added) (detailing intersection between Section 46110 and \nArticle III’s causation and redressability requirements).  See also Mohamed v. Holder, No. 11–\n1924 (4th Cir. May 28, 2013) (Circuit court unable under Section 46110 to “directly review the \nTSC’s actions, direct the agency to develop necessary facts or evidence, or compel its \ncompliance with any remedy [it] might fashion.”) (citing Elgin v. Dept. of Treasury, 132 S. Ct. at \n2126, 2138 (2012)).   \n  Defendants maintain that two broad categories of claims are subject to Section 46110 \n20 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 21 of 65\nchanneling; namely, Plaintiffs’ challenges to the adequacy of the DHS TRIP procedures and \nPlaintiffs’ placement in the TSDB.  The Court discusses each separately. \na.  Adequacy of DHS TRIP \nThe parties’ arguments concerning the adequacy of DHS TRIP are circumscribed by \nwhether the Plaintiffs are on the No Fly List, the Selectee Lists, or the Quiet Skies/Silent Partner \nLists.  For the reasons stated below, the Court rejects Defendants’ contentions as to the No Fly \nand Selectee List Plaintiffs but agrees that challenges related to the Quiet Skies/Silent Partner \nprograms and attendant screenings must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. \ni.  No Fly List Plaintiffs \nThe Amended Complaint includes a handful of No Fly List Plaintiffs, only two of whom \nreceived confirmation of their placement on the list after availing themselves of DHS TRIP \nprocedures.  ECF No. 48 ¶¶ 1041, 1455.10  The remaining No Fly List Plaintiffs have either \ninquired through DHS TRIP about their status and not received a response or have never sought \nredress through DHS TRIP.  All squarely challenge that the revised 2015 DHS TRIP procedures \nfail to provide a constitutionally sufficient procedure concerning their absolute ban on air travel.  \nDefendants principally contend that the 2015 revisions to DHS TRIP compel this Court \nto transfer all claims for the No Fly List Plaintiffs to the Fourth Circuit because the 2015 DHS \nTRIP revised process renders TSA the final arbiter of DHS TRIP complaints.  ECF No. 49-1 at \n52.  Although the Court agrees that the 2015 revisions nominally identify the TSA as the final \ndecisionmaker, this change alone does not invoke Section 46110 channeling here.  Unlike the \nplaintiff in Long, no Plaintiff is currently challenging TSA’s final determination arising out of \nDHS TRIP.  Either the No Fly list Plaintiffs have availed themselves of DHS TRIP and not \n \n10 These two Plaintiffs, Bosnic and Shirwa, were then “removed” from the No Fly List during the pendency \nof this litigation.  ECF Nos. 49-2, 49-3.   \n21 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 22 of 65\nreceived a final determination, or had not engaged the process at all.   \nMoreover, the No Fly List Plaintiffs squarely challenge the adequacy of DHS TRIP \nprocedure itself which does not solely implicate the “independent action” of TSA.  Under the \n2015 revisions, TSC still remains a “key actor” in deciding who is included on, and removed \nfrom, the No-Fly List.  See Long at *12; see also ECF No. 48-6 at 10.  In this respect, the 2015 \nrevisions have not altered the analysis much at all.  See Long, 2020 WL 1644570, at *12 (finding \nthat “[a]side from the removal of a name from the No Fly List,” the 2015 revisions did not alter \neither TSA’s or TSC’s roles).  ECF No. 49-1 at 52; ECF No. 48-6 at 10 (TSC initially decides \nafter review whether to remove or retain a complainant on the No Fly List; if the TSC retains the \nindividual on the No Fly List, TSA then issues the ultimate determination on removal or \nretention for that individual).  Where, as here, TSC remains the driving force behind DHS TRIP, \nchallenges to adequacy of the procedure are not subject to Section 46110 channeling.  See Latif \nv. Holder, 686 F.3d 1122, 1128 (9th Cir. 2012) (“TSC—not TSA—actually reviews the \nclassified intelligence information about travelers and decides whether to remove them from the \nList. And it is TSC—not TSA—that established the policies governing that stage of the redress \nprocess.”); Ege v. United States Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 784 F.3d 791, 796 (D.C. Cir. 2015) \n(TSC, not TSA, is responsible for putting a name on the No Fly List and for maintaining \nclassified information; thus, the Court of Appeals cannot “provide relief to an individual . . . by \nsimply amending, modifying, or setting aside TSA’s orders”) (citations omitted); Mohamed v. \nHolder, No. 11–1924 (Order) (Section 46110 only extends to the TSA’s orders, and not those \nactions where a remedy would involve both the TSA and the TSC.).11  The claims brought by No \n \n11 Defendants rely heavily on Mokdad v. Lynch, 804 F.3d 807 (6th Cir. 2015), for the proposition that the \nadequacy of the DHS TRIP redress procedures amounts to a TSA “order” that cannot be reviewed by the district \ncourt.  ECF No. 49-1 at 50–51.  However, Mokdad never reached this question.  See Mokdad, 804 F.3d at 812 (“We \ndecline to opine at this time whether § 46110 would deprive the district court of subject-matter jurisdiction over \n22 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 23 of 65\nFly List Plaintiffs are properly before this Court.  \nii.  Selectee List Plaintiffs \n \nThe same analysis applies to Selectee List Plaintiffs.  The 2015 DHS TRIP revisions did \nnot affect Selectee Listee inquiries.  TSC remains integral to any DHS TRIP procedures relevant \nto Selectee Listees and therefore DHS TRIP procedures do not constitute a TSA “order.”  \nMoreover, Selectee List Plaintiffs either did not avail themselves of the DHS TRIP process, or if \nthey sought redress, never heard anything from DHS TRIP.  Accordingly, none have received \nany determination from which they could seek review in the Fourth Circuit.   \niii.  Quiet Skies/Silent Partner Plaintiffs \nDefendants finally argue that Section 46110 bars any claims brought by Plaintiffs \nchallenging “particular security measures authorized by Congress and chosen by TSA to ensure \naviation security,” namely inclusion on the Quiet Skies and Silent Partner programs and the \nenhanced screenings that result.  ECF No. 53 at 8.  The Court agrees with Defendants. \nCongress has directed that TSA, “in consultation with other appropriate Federal agencies \nand air carriers, establish policies and procedures requiring air carriers— use information from \ngovernment agencies to identify [travelers] who may be a threat to civil aviation or national \nsecurity,” and “prevent [that] individual from boarding an aircraft or take other appropriate \naction with respect to that individual[.]”  49 U.S.C. § 114(h)(3).  TSA implements Quiet Skies \nand Select Partners as part of this mandate.  TSA exclusively chooses how to implement these \nprograms, including how to search, screen, and question travelers in the programs.  ECF No. 48 ¶ \n67.  Implementation of these programs constitute “orders” within the meaning of Section 46110.  \n \nMokdad’s claims challenging the adequacy of the redress process, including any broad constitutional claims, if he \nwere to file a new suit naming TSA as a defendant.”) \n \n23 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 24 of 65\nSee Blitz, 700 F.3d at 740 (standard operating procedure including advanced imaging technology \nand invasive patdowns is an “order” subject to Section 46110 channeling); Corbett v. United \nStates, 458 F. App’x 866, 870 (11th Cir. 2012) (same); Gilmore v. Gonzales, 435 F.3d at 1133 \n(TSA security directive governing presentation of passenger identification constitutes an “order” \nunder Section 46110).  Challenges to these programs, therefore, must proceed before the Fourth \nCircuit, not this Court.  The claims arising from placement in these programs are dismissed for \nlack of jurisdiction.12 \nb.  Challenges to Placement in TSDB \nWatchlisted Plaintiffs also lodge several procedural due process challenges to their initial \nplacement on the TSDB.  Defendants urge that these challenges too fall within the scope of \nSection 46110 under the doctrine of “inescapable intertwinement.”  ECF No. 49-1 at 53.  Under \nthis doctrine, “statutes…that vest judicial review of administrative orders exclusively in the \ncourts of appeals also preclude district courts from hearing claims that are ‘inescapably \nintertwined’ with review of such orders.”  Merritt v. Shuttle, Inc. (Merritt II), 245 F.3d 182, 187 \n(2d Cir. 2001) (citation omitted).  The purpose of the doctrine is to prevent a plaintiff from \n“circumvent[ing] the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of appeals by collaterally attacking an \nadministrative order in a federal district court.”  Ligon v. LaHood, 614 F.3d 150, 155 (5th Cir. \n2010) (citation omitted).  The appropriate inquiry is “whether the claim that the plaintiff seeks to \nraise . . . is inescapably intertwined with an order of a covered agency.”  Mokdad, 804 F.3d at \n813.   \n \n12 The Court cannot discern which Plaintiffs clearly challenge placement or processes related to Quiet \nSkies/Silent Partners.  The Court surmises that those Plaintiffs who allege placement in the TSDB or Watchlists \nwould not also be members of Quiet Skies or Silent Partners.  However, the Amended Complaint does not \ndifferentiate claims on this basis.  Accordingly, the Court can conclude only that claims challenging the placement \nor process related to Quiet Skies or Silent Partners are dismissed.   \n24 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 25 of 65\n  Because the Court has already determined that Plaintiffs’ challenges to DHS TRIP are \nnot subject to Section 46110’s channeling provision, their related challenges to initial placement \non the TSDB necessarily are also not subject to the provision.  Moreover, even if the DHS TRIP \nchallenges were subjected to Section 46110 channeling, the claims are not inescapably \nintertwined with challenges to initial placement on the TSDB.  The doctrine “cannot do such \nheavy lifting as to bring all of plaintiff’s constitutional claims to the Courts of Appeals,” Long, \n2020 WL 1644570, at *14 (citing Amerijet Intn’l, 43 F. Supp. 3d at 14–15).  This is particularly \ntrue where, as here, the subject of the broader claims is TSDB inclusion and the challenged TSA \n“order” is “entirely derivative” of those broader claims.  Id.   \nIn sum, Section 46110 does not divest this Court of jurisdiction for the lion’s share of the \nchallenged claims.  Rather, the Court lacks jurisdiction only as to those claims related to the \nQuiet Skies and Silent Partner programs.  Those claims only shall be dismissed.  \n2.  Failure to Exhaust DHS TRIP Procedures \nDefendants next contend that this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear claims for which \nPlaintiffs did not exhaust DHS TRIP procedures.  Defendants seem to suggest that unexhausted \nclaims are not “ripe” for adjudication and thus deprive this Court of the power to hear the claim.  \nECF No. 49-1 at 54.  Defendants do not cite any statute or regulation requiring exhaustion, but \ninstead argue that exhaustion “would serve the ‘twin purposes of protecting administrative \nagency authority and promoting judicial efficiency’ that the ripeness doctrine is meant to \nsupport.”  ECF No. 53 at 10 (quoting McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 144–45 (1992)).  \nExhaustion does not implicate this Court’s jurisdiction unless Congress expressly says so.  \nSee Fort Bend Cty., Texas v. Davis, 139 S. Ct. 1843, 1850 (2019).  Otherwise, whether to require \nexhaustion is left to the Court’s “sound judicial discretion.”  McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 144.  For \n25 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 26 of 65\nclaims challenging a final agency action under the APA, a court cannot require exhaustion where \nneither the relevant statute nor an agency rule imposes such a requirement.  Darby v. \nCisneros, 509 U.S. 137, 144–45 (1993).  For all other claims, the court must balance the “interest \nof the individual in retaining prompt access to a federal judicial forum against countervailing \ninstitutional interests favoring exhaustion.”  McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 146.  Institutional interests \ninclude allowing the agency to “correct its own mistakes with respect to programs it administers \nbefore it is haled into federal court.”  Id. at 145.  \nDefendants urge this Court to follow Shearson v. Holder in requiring Plaintiffs to exhaust \nremedies in advance of pressing their claims here.  725 F.3d 588, 594 (6th Cir. 2013).  Shearson \ninvolved a single plaintiff’s challenge to her placement on the TSDB and Watchlists.  The Sixth \nCircuit affirmed the district court’s determination that the Shearson plaintiff must first raise her \nbroad constitutional challenges to her placement through DHS TRIP.  Id.  Notably, while the \nShearson plaintiff raised many of the same arguments that Plaintiffs lodge against the sufficiency \nof the redress procedure, the Shearson Court held out hope that the “Redress Program’s inquiry \nprocess” would develop an administrative record and “may help remove her from the terrorist list \nand help end her continuing injury.”  Id. \nBy contrast, Plaintiffs have pleaded robustly that the DHS TRIP procedure has \nhistorically offered little redress with no prospects of improvement.  ECF No. 48 ¶¶ 211–17.  \nPlaintiffs expressly contend that as to the Selectee Lists, most responses are wholly lacking in \npertinent information, including whether the complainant is on or has been removed from a \nWatchlist.  As to the No Fly List Plaintiffs, many complaints fall into a DHS TRIP black hole.  \nId.  ¶¶ 218, 222.  This Court simply does not share the Shearson Court’s optimism that \nexhaustion will aid the decision-making process.  See Mohamed v. Holder, 995 F. Supp. 2d 520 \n26 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 27 of 65\n(E.D. Va. 2014).  Defendants’ exhaustion argument is rejected.  \n3.  Statute of Limitations  \nDefendants’ last jurisdictional contention is quickly disposed.  Defendants maintain that \nmany Plaintiffs have filed suit well beyond the applicable limitations period set for challenging \nplacement on the TSDB and watchlists.  ECF No. 49-1 at 54.  But each Plaintiff has alleged \ncontinuous and current inclusion on the TSDB and Watchlists.  ECF No. 48 ¶ 247.  Because \nlimitations do not begin to run until the violation ends, and the violations continue for as long as \nPlaintiffs remain on the TSDB and Watchlists, the claims are not time barred.  Virginia Hosp. \nAss’n v. Baliles, 868 F.2d 653 (4th Cir. 1989), aff’d sub nom. Wilder v. Virginia Hosp. Ass’n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990); see also Rehab. Ass’n of Virginia, Inc. v. Kozlowski, 838 F. Supp. 243, 249 \n(E.D. Va. 1993), aff’d, 42 F.3d 1444 (4th Cir. 1994) (denying defendants’ motions on the statute \nof limitation bar “due to the continuing nature of the alleged harm” resulting from the continued \napplication of an allegedly unlawful policy).  \nIV.  Merits \nHaving concluded that Defendants’ jurisdictional challenges do not significantly alter the \nlandscape of this case, the Court turns to the legal sufficiency of each claim.   \nA.  Violation of the Fifth Amendment – Procedural Due Process (Count I) \nCount I, broadly stated, challenges the TSDB and Watchlisting system as lacking in \nadequate procedural safeguards when governmental action visits substantial deprivation of a \nconstitutional right.  The Fifth Amendment provides that a person shall not “be deprived of life, \nliberty or property, without due process of law.”  U.S. Const. amend. V.  “The procedural \ncomponent of due process imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive \nindividuals of ‘liberty’ or ‘property’ interests within the meaning of the Due Process \n27 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 28 of 65\nClause.”  D.B. v. Cardall, 826 F.3d 721, 741 (4th Cir. 2016) (citation and quotation marks \nomitted).  To state a procedural due process claim, Plaintiffs must allege “(1) a cognizable liberty \nor property interest; (2) the deprivation of that interest by some form of state action; and (3) that \nthe procedures employed were constitutionally inadequate.”  Shirvinksi v. U.S. Coast Guard, 673 \nF.3d 308, 314 (4th Cir. 2012) (quoting Kendall v. Balcerzak, 650 F.3d 515, 528) (4th Cir. 2011)).   \nIf Plaintiffs plausibly aver government deprivation of a cognizable interest, the trier of \nfact must then weigh three factors, commonly referred to as the Mathews factors, to determine if \na due process violation has occurred: (1) “the private interest that will be affected by the official \naction”; (2) “the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, \nand the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards”; and (3) “the \nGovernment’s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens \nthat the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.”  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 \nU.S. 319, 335 (1976).  \nWith this framework in mind, the Court turns to whether Plaintiffs have plausibly averred \ndeprivation of an interest protected under the Due Process Clause.   \n1.  Travel-Related Liberty Interests \nBoth Selectee and No Fly List Plaintiffs aver erroneous deprivation of a protected interest \nin travel.  It is undisputed that “the right to travel is a part of the ‘liberty’ of which the citizen \ncannot be deprived without the due process of law under the Fifth Amendment.”  See Kent v. \nDulles, 357 U.S. 116, 125 (1958); see also Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489, 498 (1999) (noting that \nthe right to travel is “firmly embedded” within the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court).  \nPlaintiffs maintain a clear liberty interest in domestic travel, see id.; Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 \nU.S. 618, 630 (1969), as well as international travel.  “Travel abroad, like travel within the \n28 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 29 of 65\ncountry, may be necessary for a livelihood.  It may be as close to the heart of the individual as \nthe choice of what he eats, or wears, or reads.”  Kent, 357 U.S. at 126; see also Kashem v. Barr, \n941 F.3d 358, 378 (9th Cir. 2009) (“Plaintiffs undoubtedly have a strong liberty interest in \ndomestic and international travel.”); Mohamed v. Holder, No. 1:11-CV-50 AJT/MSN, 2015 WL \n4394958, at *6 (E.D. Va. July 16, 2015); (“It must be recognized that a meaningful right of travel \nin today’s world cannot be understood as cleanly divided between interstate and international \ntravel . . .”).   \nDefendants do not meaningfully challenge that No Fly List Plaintiffs have adequately \naverred that placement on this list results in a total ban on air travel.  The Court easily concludes \nsuch Plaintiffs have averred deprivation of a protected liberty interest. \nDefendants instead vigorously contend that Selectee List Plaintiffs have not averred \nsufficient impediments to travel to constitute a deprivation of a constitutional right to travel.  In \nthis respect, the Court recognizes that routine travel-related delays are not actionable.  See \ngenerally Cramer v. Skinner, 931 F.2d 1020, 1030 (5th Cir. 1991); U.S. v. Shenandoah, 595 F.3d \n151, 162–63 (3d Cir. 2010); League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Bredesen, 500 F.3d 523, 535 \n(6th Cir. 2007).  Even several hour delays do not amount to a constitutional deprivation in the \neyes of some courts.  Cf. Beydoun v. Sessions, 871 F.3d 459, 467–68 (6th Cir. 2017) (delays \nfrom airport screenings, even if resulting in missed flights, do not implicate the fundamental \nright to travel under substantive due process); Abdi v. Wray, No. 2:17-CV-622-DB, 2018 WL \n1940411, at *3 (D. Utah Apr. 23, 2018), aff’d, 942 F.3d 1019 (10th Cir. 2019) (dismissing \nprocedural due process claim because challenges such as obtaining a boarding pass from a \nticketing agent rather than a kiosk and undergoing a lengthy screening process, even if resulting \nin the occasional missed flight, were minor “inconveniences”).   \n29 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 30 of 65\nThat said, when Watchlist status results in repeated, prolonged delays that “actually \ndeters travel, when impeding travel is its primary objective, or when it uses a classification that \nserves to penalize the exercise of the right,” an individual suffers a deprivation of constitutional \ndimension.  See generally Attorney Gen. of N.Y. v. Soto-Lopez, 476 U.S. 898, 903 (1986); see \nalso Elhady v. Piehota, 303 F. Supp. 3d 453, 464 (E.D. Va. 2017) (deprivation of right where \nplaintiffs avoided travel because of “invasive additional screening and other liberty-constraining \nactivities” such as hours-long detentions and interrogations).  Such deprivation occurs even if a \nplaintiff could avail himself of a less convenient form of transportation.  Compare Town of \nSouthold v. Town of E. Hampton, 477 F.3d 38, 54 (2d Cir. 2007) (holding, in the equal protection \ncontext, that “travelers do not have a constitutional right to the most convenient form of \ntravel…”) (quotation marks and alterations omitted) with Kashem, 941 F.3d at 378 (finding, in \nthe procedural due process context, that “plaintiffs may not possess a fundamental right to \ntravel by airplane, but in many instances air travel constitutes the only practical means of \ntraveling across great distances”) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in \noriginal). \nUsing the collective wisdom of the decisions defining the contours of this right, the Court \nturns to Plaintiffs’ claims.  Regrettably, the structure of the Amended Complaint frustrates \nstraightforward application.  Although all Watchlisted Plaintiffs assert the claim, clearly all do \nnot plead significant impediment to travel.  Some Plaintiffs have suffered only a one-time \nlengthy delay, or screening processes that engender nonspecific “humiliation” or \n“inconvenience.”  Cf. Abdi, 2018 WL 1940411, at *3 (rejecting claim where plaintiff alleging \nminor delays on four occasions, only one resulting in a missed flight); Beydoun, 871 F.3d at 467 \n(rejecting claim where plaintiff had “not attempted to provide any information about when those \n30 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 31 of 65\ndelays occurred, how long the delays were, what type of enhanced screening he was subjected to, \nor indeed any information beyond general allegations that he has been prevented from \ntraveling.”).   \nOthers, however, allege experiencing a pattern of multi-hour delays nearly every time \nthey travel, arising from hours-long searches, detentions, and interrogations, often conducted in \nfront of fellow passengers and travel companions.  See, e.g., ECF No. 48 ¶¶ 324–34, 424–43, \n459–78, 498–513, 656–59, 1212–18 (by air); id. ¶¶ 309–13, 493–94, 664–67, 1096–105 (by \nland).  Some have endured displays of force, see, e.g., id. ¶ 1098 (detention by gunpoint), ¶ 661 \n(kicking plaintiff’s legs open for a search); threats, see, e.g., id. ¶¶ 392, 614; property \nconfiscation, see, e.g., id. ¶¶ 534, 495; and verbal humiliation, see, e.g., id. ¶ 1269 (airline \nrepresentative informing Kamel “America doesn’t want you”).  These experiences, as pleaded, \namount to a significant impediment to travel—a far cry from the “delays that many individuals \nare likely to experience at the airport.”  Beydoun, 871 F.3d at 468 (concluding that a fundamental \nright cannot be implicated if Plaintiffs allegations are similar to those typically experienced by \nregular travelers).   \nFor example, Plaintiff Sulayman is “afraid to travel again” after he was detained twice \nand interrogated with his wife and four children for hours upon arriving at the U.S.–Canadian \nborder.  ECF No. 48 ¶¶ 674–680, 715.  There, he was forced to undergo multiple extensive \nsearches and lengthy interrogations in front of his fellow Muslim community members and \nfamily.  Id. ¶¶ 681–701.  Plaintiff Jardaneh went so far as to move to Canada, restrict his travel, \nand seek asylum from the U.S. government after being subjected to humiliating searches and \ninterrogations at the U.S.–Canadian border.  Id. ¶¶ 308–41.  On one occasion, he was handcuffed \nto a stretcher on the way to the hospital.  Id. ¶ 318.  On another, he was searched at the airport \n31 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 32 of 65\nand surveilled by air marshals while on flight.  Id. ¶ 334.  Plaintiff Muminov, when arriving \nhome from a business trip, was detained at the U.S.-Canadian border, ordered out of his car at \ngunpoint, handcuffed, held in a cold cell, interrogated for four hours, and subjected to a pat \ndown, finger printing, hair analysis, iris scan, mouth swab, and search of his personal property.  \nId. ¶¶ 1096–105.  He has consequently ceased all travel to Canada.  Id. ¶ 1106.   \nViewing the Amended Complaint facts as true and most favorably to Plaintiffs, the court \nconcludes that several have adequately alleged deprivation of a liberty interest triggering due \nprocess protection.13       \n2.  Reputational Liberty Interests  \nCertain Plaintiffs also allege an infringement of their constitutionally protected interest in \ntheir “good name, reputation, honor, or integrity.”  Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433, \n437 (1971).  But, “injury to reputation by itself [is] not a ‘liberty’ interest protected under the \n[Due Process Clause].”  Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 233 (1991).  To show that reputational \nharm infringes a liberty interest, Plaintiffs must satisfy the “stigma-plus” test.  See Paul v. \nDavis, 424 U.S. 693, 710–12 (1976).  In particular, Plaintiffs must aver plausibly that they \nsuffered (1) a “stigma” from governmental action; “plus” (2) an alteration or extinguishment of \n“a right or status previously recognized by state law.”  Id.; see also Evans v. Chalmers, 703 F.3d \n636, 654 (4th Cir. 2012); Shirvinski, 673 F.3d at 315; Piehota, 303 F. Supp. 3d at 464–65.  \nWith respect to the “stigma” prong, plaintiffs must plausibly aver that the government \npublicly disseminated defamatory information.  See Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 573 \n(1972); Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341, 348 (1976); Palka v. Shelton, 623 F.3d 447, 454 (7th Cir. \n \n13 Plaintiffs who have adequately pled deprivation of their travel-related liberty interest are: Jardaneh, Doe, \nH. Wehelie, A. Wehelie, Mohallim, El-Shahat, Sulayman, Suliman, Doe 2, Sehwail, Albadawi, Hall, Bosnic, \nMuminov, Mujanovic, Hachem, Riad, Abunijem, Elamin, Shirwa, and Al-Sahlani.  \n32 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 33 of 65\n2010).  As to state action, or the “plus” prong, each plaintiff must allege suffering “a change in a \nright or status previously recognized by law.”  Piehota, 303 F. Supp. 3d at 464–65 (quoting Paul, \n424 U.S. at 711) (quotation marks omitted).  Simple reputational damage alone is not sufficient.  \nId. (citing Siegert, 500 U.S. at 234). \nPlaintiffs aver that Defendants have publicly disseminated defamatory content by \nallowing “state and local authorities, foreign governments, corporations, private contractors, \nairlines, gun sellers, financial institutions, and captains of sea-faring vessels” access to the TSDB \nwhich falsely touts that members are “known and suspected terrorists.”  ECF No. 48 ¶ 154.  \nDefendants have also shared the database with “553 private entities including airlines, \nuniversities, hospitals, private correctional facilities, private security services and private city \nattorneys.”  Id. ¶ 160.  Such widespread dissemination is “tantamount to public disclosure, even \nif only distributed to other government and private entities that need the information for official \nobjectives.”  Piehota, 303 F. Supp. 3d at 465. \nAdding to the “stigma,” the Court notes that Plaintiffs are effectively outed as supposed \n“known or suspected terrorists” in front of family, friends, travel companions, fellow passengers, \nand even business acquaintances who witness Plaintiffs’ detentions, interrogations, and searches \nduring travel.  Cf. Mohamed, 2015 WL 4394958, at *6.  This, aver Plaintiffs, has undoubtedly \ndiminished their standing in the community.  See Roth, 408 U.S. at 573 (plaintiff can show state \nimposition of stigma where government’s action “seriously damage[d] [the plaintiff’s] standing \nand associations in his community[.]”).  Members of the public have ceased to travel with \nPlaintiffs, see, e.g., id. ¶¶ 740, 891, 1005, 1156, 1177–94, 1421, refused to do business with \nthem, see, e.g., id. ¶ 1192 (business leader cancelling all meetings with Hall after learning he had \nbeen subjected to enhanced screenings), or avoided them altogether.  See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 715 (“Imam \n33 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 34 of 65\nSulayman . . . is also discouraged from organizing and leading Muslim community members”).   \nCf. Mohamed, 995 F. Supp. 2d at 532 (“Inclusion on the No Fly List [] labels an American \ncitizen a disloyal American who is capable of, and disposed toward committing war crimes, and \none can easily imagine the broad range of consequences that might be visited upon such a person \nif that stigmatizing designation were known by the general public”).  When viewing the facts \nmost favorably to Plaintiffs, they have averred sufficient government dissemination of \ndefamatory information. \nOnly certain Plaintiffs, however, have even arguably alleged that the defamatory \ndissemination has altered their legal status to establish the “plus” in the stigma-plus deprivation.  \nEsmaeel Paryavi has alleged that he lost access to the Global Entry travel program implemented \nby CBP.  ECF No. 48 ¶¶ 972–79.  Likewise, Bosnic has averred that he lost his TWIC \ncredentials, which he needs to perform his job, due to his Watchlist status.  Id. ¶ 1045– 46.  \nSulayman and Thadi too aver that they are no longer permitted to access military bases.  Id. ¶¶ \n702–13, 950.  And Abdurrashid has been denied a state license to purchase a firearm.  Id. ¶¶ \n450–54.   All other Plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficiently a constitutional deprivation on this \nliability theory. \nDefendants pressed at oral argument that as to these specific Plaintiffs, none of the \nalleged denials amount to an alteration of legal status sufficient to constitute a “plus.”  However, \nDefendants provide no reasoned basis at this stage for the Court to so conclude.14  Plaintiffs \npressed in the opposite direction, urging that this Court find any of the other alleged \n \n14 Defendants’ reliance on stigma-plus cases treating loss of government employment are inapposite. See \nDoe v. Dep’t of Pub. Safety ex rel. Lee, 271 F.3d 38, 51 (2d Cir. 2001), rev’d sub nom. Connecticut Dep’t of Pub. \nSafety v. Doe, 538 U.S. 1 (2003) (finding that cases addressing “stigma plus” claims in the context of termination of \ngovernment employment “yield principles that are sometimes difficult to apply in delineating ‘plus’ factors in other \ncontexts.”). \n \n34 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 35 of 65\nconstitutional injuries, such as the unconstitutional searches and interrogations discussed infra, to \nconstitute a “plus.”  They too provide no support for expanding the doctrine to include any and \nevery possible infringement as a loss of legal status.   \nThe Court notes the relative dearth of applicable precedent addressing the nature of the \nstate “right” sufficient to support the “plus” prong.  To the extent courts have held that \ndeprivation of state-authorized “privileges” as opposed to “rights” are insufficient to constitute a \n“plus,” clearly more factual development in this case is warranted.  See, e.g., Al Turki v. Tomsic, \n926 F3d 610 (10th Cir 2019) (prisoner transfer is a “privilege” not a “right,” the loss of which \nwould be sufficient to constitute a “plus”); Behrens v. Regier, 422 F.3d 1255 (11th Cir. 2005) \n(state discretionary decision to allow adoption not a “right or interest guaranteed” sufficient to \nestablish “plus” prong); cf. University Gardens Apts. Joint Venture v. Jack B. Johnson, 419 \nF.Supp 2d 733, 739 (D. Md. 2006) (recognizing “loss of a government-issued license” as a \n“plus”); Doe v. Rector & Visitors of George Mason Univ., 132 F. Supp 3d 712, 722 (ED. Va. \n2015) (expulsion from public university sufficient as a “plus”.)  Accordingly, those Plaintiffs \nwho have pleaded some loss of a specific state authorized status will proceed.  The Court awaits \nfurther factual development as to the question of loss of “legal status” before concluding whether \nthe deprivation satisfies the “plus” as a matter of law.15 \n3.  The Mathews Factors  \nHaving found that certain Plaintiffs have pleaded a deprivation of a constitutional liberty \ninterest, the Court turns to weighing the Mathews factors to determine whether the Plaintiffs \n \n15 Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge denials of Military Base Access, TWIC, \nand TSA Precheck and Global Entry.  ECF No. 49-1 at 45–46.  Plaintiffs, however, do not ask the Defendants to \nrestore their rights of access and placement in these programs directly.  Rather, these are identified as the alleged \nharms that flow from placement in the TSDB.  These deprivations are particularly relevant to the stigma-plus claim, \nwhich highlights that this standing argument is misplaced.  \n35 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 36 of 65\nhave pleaded constitutionally inadequate redress procedures.   \nAs to the first two Mathews factors, Defendants contend that the redress procedures \nafforded are sufficient to address the constitutional deprivations when balanced against the \nGovernment’s keen interest in protecting the country’s borders.  Defendants maintain the internal \nprocedures applicable to the TSDB protect against erroneous constitutional deprivations.  ECF \n49-1 at 69.  They highlight that potential TSDB listees must be nominated and approved before \nbeing placed in the database and that the TSDB is then subject to ongoing internal audits.  The \nDHS TRIP procedure, say Defendants, provides further protection in that it draws attention to \npossible erroneous placement in the database.  Id.  Although TSDB Plaintiffs not on the No Fly \nList have no way to confirm their watchlist list status, No Fly List individuals do receive such \nconfirmation after submitting a DHS TRIP inquiry.  Id.  Thus, according to Defendants, the \nAmended Complaint fails to demonstrate that procedures were inadequate to protect against \nerroneous deprivation of a protected liberty interest. \nViewing the Amended Complaint most favorably to Plaintiffs, the TSDB nomination and \napproval process is, in short, a black box.  The process is governed by “amorphous criteria,” \ndevoid of any notice, and utterly lacking in safeguards, such that over 98% of those nominated \nare approved.  ECF No. 48 ¶¶ 135, 185, 220.  As a result, the risk of erroneous deprivation is \nhigh, according to Plaintiffs: given that none of the million-plus individuals in the database have \never perpetrated an act of domestic terrorism, the government would be better off randomly \nchoosing individuals to include in the TSDB.  Id. ¶¶ 179–80, 188.  Once in the TSDB, no redress \nmechanism exists for individuals who suffer overly broad and seemingly irrational restrictions \nwith air and land travel, government credentialing, or financial institutions.  Id. ¶ 211.   \nPlaintiffs further aver the DHS TRIP process is unavailing.  DHS TRIP provides no \n36 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 37 of 65\ninformation on how the TSA and TSC evaluates complaints, id. ¶ 212; inquiries generate merely \na “standard form letter that neither confirms nor denies the existence of any terrorist watchlist \nrecords relating to the individual.”  Id. ¶ 217.  Allegedly, “as of December 2017, the TSA \nAdministrator had taken no action regarding the removal of TSDB Listees in two years.”  Id. ¶ \n213.  Indeed, each affected Plaintiff alleges having received only a “redress control number” in \nresponse to their DHS TRIP inquiries, nothing else.  See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 765, 879.  \nAs for the DHS TRIP inquiries filed by those on the No Fly List, the 2015 revisions \nrequire DHS TRIP response letters to “affirmatively state” whether an individual appears on the \nlist.  Id. ¶ 218; ECF No. 49-1 at 36.  DHS TRIP also is supposed to provide No Fly list \nindividuals “criteria on which his placement was based and, to the extent possible consistent with \nnational security and law enforcement interests, a summary of the factual basis for the No Fly \nList determination.”  ECF No. 49-1 at 36.  Further, the individual should be able to submit \ninformation to DHS TRIP relevant to his No Fly List status, which DHS TRIP will then review.  \nId.  But the Amended Complaint allegations do not square with these revisions: DHS TRIP \n“continue[s] to provide no information on historical watchlist status, no information as to \nwhether a person is included in the TSDB generally, no meaningful factual basis for the \nindividuals inclusion on the watchlist, and no information as to whether the government has \nresolved the specific complaint at issue.”  ECF No. 48 ¶ 218.  And not a single No Fly List \ndetermination arising out of DHS TRIP has been processed, say Plaintiffs, since 2015.  Id ¶ 222.  \nAccordingly, the existing procedural protections are inscrutable, opaque, and as to DHS \nTRIP No Fly List inquires, not followed.  The process affords little to no opportunity to be heard, \nbefore, during, or after being placed in the TSDB and deprived of protected liberty interests.  Cf. \nFuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 80, 92 (1972) (due process requires “[p]arties whose rights are to \n37 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 38 of 65\nbe affected are entitled to be heard; and in order that they may enjoy that right they must first be \nnotified.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Mathews, 424 U.S. at 333 (“The \nfundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard ‘at a meaningful time and \nin a meaningful manner.’”) (quoting Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545 (1965)).  As pleaded, \ntherefore, the claims survive. \nAs to the third Mathews factor, whether the Watchlist system furthers national security \ninterests, is best addressed after discovery.  To be sure, the Government maintains a strong \ninterest in national security.  See Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 307 (1981); Wayte v. United States, \n470 U.S. 598, 612 (1985); Mohamed v. Holder, 266 F. Supp. 3d 868, 880 (E.D. Va. 2017) \n(“There is obviously a compelling government interest in preventing terrorist attacks against \ncommercial aviation.”).  The central question, however, is whether government has implemented \n“reasonable measures to ensure basic fairness” to include implementing reasonably designed \nprocedures.  See Al Haramain Islamic Found., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, 686 F.3d 965, 980 \n(9th Cir. 2012).  Discovery as to whether and how TSDB and the Watchlisting system furthers \nnational security interests, as well as the administrative burdens that additional procedural \nprotections will place on the Government, remain critical to the final analysis. \nThe Court recognizes that, in the end, the Government’s internal processes may provide \nsufficient protection to withstand scrutiny.  But the Court cannot make that determination as a \nmatter of law when considering all complaint facts most favorably to Plaintiffs.  Indeed, the \nMathews balancing test depends upon “fact-intensive considerations” not capable of resolution \nnow.  Piehota, 303 F. Supp. 3d at 465; see also Kovac, 363 F. Supp. 3d at 758.  Striking the \nbalance between the parties’ competing interests, as well as the value of additional or substitute \nprocedural safeguards, cannot be done in the abstract.  The procedural due process claims \n38 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 39 of 65\nsurvive challenge as to those plaintiffs who plausibly aver deprivation of travel and reputational \nliberty interests.16   \nB.  Violation of the Fifth Amendment – Substantive Due Process (Count II) \nThe substantive due process claim is confined to the No Fly List Plaintiffs17 who allege \ndeprivation of their fundamental right to travel, or as they say “movement,” as recognized by the \nSupreme Court in Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116 (1958) and Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618 \n(1969).  Substantive due process “protects individual liberty against certain government actions \nregardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.”  Collins v. City of Harker \nHeights, 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  However, such \nheightened protections against government interference extend to a narrower set of “rights and \nliberties which are, objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition, and implicit \nin the concept of ordered liberty, such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were \nsacrificed.”  Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720–21 (1997) (internal quotations and \ncitations omitted).  To assert a substantive due process claim, Plaintiffs must allege that \nDefendants’ action burdens a fundamental right and cannot withstand strict scrutiny.  Hawkins v. \nFreeman, 195 F.3d 732, 739 (4th Cir. 1999).  Surviving strict scrutiny requires the government \nto demonstrate that its interference is necessary to further a compelling governmental interest \nand has been narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  Id.  \n \n16 Plaintiffs who have sufficiently pled deprivation of their protected travel or reputational liberty interests \nare: Jardaneh, Doe, H. Wehelie, A. Wehelie, Mohallim, El-Shahat, Sulayman, Suliman, Doe 2, Sehwail, Albadawi, \nHall, Bosnic, Mujanovic, Muminov, Hachem, Riad, Abunijem, Elamin, Shirwa, Al-Sahlani, Thadi, E. Paryavi, and \nAbdurrashid. \n \n17 Plaintiffs conceded in the June 18, 2020 hearing that the substantive due process claims were only \nbrought by Plaintiffs on the No Fly List: Doe, Mohallim, Sehwail, Bosnic, and Shirwa.  \n \n39 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 40 of 65\nThe No Fly List burdens a plaintiff’s fundamental right to interstate travel.  See Shapiro, \n394 U.S. at 630; Kent, 357 U.S. at 125; Saenz, 526 U.S. at 498; Kashem, 941 F.3d at 378.  That \nthe No Fly List Plaintiffs may use a less convenient means of transportation does not change the \nanalysis when considering, in many instances, the tremendous effort and time required to take \nsuch an alternative option.  See Kashem, 941 F.3d at 378.  Further, although protecting U.S. \nborders and combatting terrorism is clearly a compelling government interest, whether \nDefendants’ actions are narrowly tailored to achieve that purpose cannot be decided now.  The \nAmended Complaint makes plausible that the No Fly List, as an outgrowth of the TSDB, is both \nunder and overinclusive and so has been wholly ineffectual in furthering the government’s \nlegitimate security interests.  See ECF No. 48 ¶¶ 177–90.  This question is fact-dependent and \ninappropriate for complete resolution at this stage.  The Count therefore survives, but only as to \nthe No Fly List Plaintiffs. \nC.  Violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706 – DHS TRIP (Count III) \n \nThe Court next turns to the legal sufficiency of Count III.  Under the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”), the reviewing court must affirm an agency decision unless it is \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A); see also Marsh v. Oregon Natural Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, 375 (1989); Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).   \nPlaintiffs allege the decisions to place Plaintiffs in the TSDB constitute agency actions \nthat fall under the ambit of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706.  ECF No. 48 ¶ 1592.  Plaintiffs further aver \nthat such placement was driven solely, or primarily, because of race, ethnicity, national origin, \nreligious affiliation, or other First Amendment protected activities, that they do not “present a \nsecurity threat to commercial aviation.” id. ¶¶ 1595–96, 1598, and that they have not been \n40 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 41 of 65\nafforded an adequate redress process.  Id. ¶ 1597.  Defendants’ decision as to Plaintiffs’ TSDB \nand Watchlist status, according to Plaintiffs, is arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise not in \naccordance with law, and thus in violation of the APA.  Id. ¶¶ 1594, 1597–98.   \nThe parties agree that Plaintiffs’ APA claim is coextensive with their procedural due \nprocess claims.  ECF No. 70.  Accordingly, to the extent the procedural due process claims \nsurvive for certain Plaintiffs, so too do their APA claims.   \nD.  Violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706 – National Crime Information Center \n(Count IV) \n \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants lack authority to share Plaintiffs’ identities and personal \ninformation through the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), and as such, Defendants’ \nactions violate the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706.  ECF No. 48 ¶¶ 1600–07.  Defendants challenge both \nthe sufficiency of the claim and Plaintiffs’ standing for failure to allege any injury-in-fact that \nstems from the dissemination.  ECF No. 49-1 at 77–80.  Because the Court concludes that \nPlaintiffs have pleaded absolutely no injury arising from the NCIC, it grants Defendants’ motion \non this basis alone. \nIn the 268 page Amended Complaint, two factual allegations relate to NCIC.  First, that \nNCIC includes some nonspecific cohort of TSDB identified as “Known or Suspected Terrorists” \n(“KSTs”), which can be accessed by more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies and 100,000 \nlaw enforcement officers.  ECF No. 48 ¶ 106.  And second, that law enforcement may query \nNCIC during routine police encounters such as traffic stops.  Id. ¶ 158.  \nThe Amended Complaint, however, is silent as to how NCIC actually affected any named \nPlaintiff.  No Plaintiff adequately pleads any police encounters arising from an NCIC query or \nany factual basis to support that law enforcement access to NCIC caused any injury.  Although \nthe disclosure mechanism through NCIC may provide helpful context regarding the wide-\n41 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 42 of 65\nranging uses of the TSDB, the allegations do not give rise to a legally cognizable claim for any \nPlaintiff.  Count IV, therefore, must be dismissed.   \nE.  Violation of the Fifth Amendment – Equal Protection (Count V) \nWatchlist and TSDB Plaintiffs allege their inclusion amounts to intentional \ndiscrimination based on race, alienage, religion, and national origin, without a compelling, \nlegitimate, or rational justification and in violation of Equal Protection under the Fifth \nAmendment.  ECF No. 48 ¶¶ 1608–20.  See U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1 (the government may \nnot “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”); Bolling v. \nSharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 638, n. 2 (1975).  The \nEqual Protection Clause prohibits “governmental decisionmakers from treating differently \npersons who are in all relevant respects alike.”  Morrison v. Garraghty, 239 F.3d 648, 654 (4th \nCir. 2001) (citing Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10, (1992)).  “To survive a motion to dismiss \nan equal protection claim, a plaintiff must plead sufficient facts to demonstrate plausibly that he \nwas treated differently from others who were similarly situated and that the unequal treatment \nwas the result of discriminatory animus.”  Equity In Athletics, Inc. v. Dep’t of Educ., 639 F.3d \n91, 108 (4th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted).  The court must then assess, as a matter of law, \nwhether the disparate treatment is justified, employing the requisite level of scrutiny.  Garraghty, \n239 F.3d at 654.   \nPlaintiffs maintain that they are subjected to ongoing adverse differential treatment based \nupon membership in a suspect class.  Accordingly, the Court must apply “strict scrutiny” to the \ngovernmental action, which dictates that only such action “suitably tailored to serve a compelling \nstate interest” will survive challenge.  City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. \n432, 440 (1985).  \n42 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 43 of 65\nWhere, as here, the claimed unconstitutional discrimination is based on a facially neutral \nlaw or policy, Plaintiffs must allege facts that allow the plausible inference that such law or \npolicy has been applied in an intentionally discriminatory manner, see Sylvia Dev. Corp. v. \nCalvert Cty., Md., 48 F.3d 810, 819 (4th Cir. 1995), or that its adoption was motivated by \ndiscriminatory animus.  See Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, \n265 (1977).  Evidence of discriminatory intent is key.  Thus, even when a facially neutral statute \nhas a “racially disproportionate impact,” discriminatory animus must nevertheless be proved to \nestablish an equal protection violation.  See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976). \nBoth direct and circumstantial evidence of discrimination may be considered.  Arlington \nHeights, 429 U.S. at 266.  Among such circumstantial evidence most relevant to this claim, the \nCourt may look to consistent patterns of governmental conduct that adversely affect a protected \nclass, as well as statements of the policy makers (or lack thereof).  Sylvia Dev. Corp., 48 F.3d at \n819 (citing Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266–68).   While “purposeful discrimination is the \ncondition that offends the Constitution[,]” “impact provides an important starting point.”  Pers. \nAdm’r of Massachusetts v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 274 (1979) (citation and quotation marks \nomitted).  \nThe criteria for TSDB inclusion amounts to a facially neutral policy.  See ECF No. 48-6 \nat 5.  It states expressly that nominations “must not be solely based on race, ethnicity, national \norigin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment protected activities.”  Id.  Although Plaintiffs \nwould invite the Court to take this policy statement as evidence of discrimination, ECF No. 52 at \n55–56, the policy points in the opposite direction.  The policy does not demand consideration of \nthose factors, and in fact prohibits consideration of such factors alone.  Accordingly, the Court \nbegins with the presumption that the TSDB criteria are facially neutral.  \n43 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 44 of 65\nAs for evidence of discriminatory animus, the Court notes, as do Defendants, that the \nAmended Complaint is peppered with bald allegations that alone would not survive challenge.  \nSee, e.g., ECF No. 48 ¶ 1611 (“Defendants selectively apply and enforce watchlist and screening \npolicies to individuals who appear to be or who are known or suspected to be Muslim or Middle \nEastern”); ¶ 1612 (“The disparate treatment between Muslims and non-Muslims is the result of \nDefendants’ intentional and purposeful discrimination.”); ¶ 194 (“Defendants, knowingly, \nintentionally, and purposefully use impermissible and inaccurate religious profiles to nominate, \naccept, disseminate, and deploy the federal terrorist watchlist against American Muslims in a \nmanner that is different from other faith backgrounds.”).  \nHowever, the Amended Complaint also avers sufficient detail to “nudg[e] the claim of \npurposeful discrimination across the line from conceivable to plausible.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. 662 (2009).  Some Plaintiffs contend, for instance, that their answers regarding religious \nand cultural practices is what landed them in the TSDB and on the respective Watchlists.  See, \ne.g., ECF No. 48 ¶¶ 485–86 (FBI interrogation of M. Paryavi as to his Islamic religious beliefs \nand practices and political opinions, including the mosque he attends and details about its imam, \ncontributed to his TSDB designation); ¶¶ 649–51 (Interrogation of El-Shahat regarding “what he \nthinks of jihad, what mosque he attends, how religious he is, whether he teaches at a mosque, \nwhether he is an imam” contributed to his TSDB designation).  Probing interrogations about \ntravel to Muslim-majority countries, religious pilgrimages, learning Arabic, attending mosques, \naffiliations with Muslim organizations, religious donations, and associations with other Muslims, \nprovide further factual basis to infer plausibly that placement on the list was tied directly, and \nperhaps solely, to Plaintiffs’ race, alienage, religion, and national origin.  Compare id. ¶¶ 485, \n635–41, 646–50, 941–42, 1279, 1147–48, 1519–20 with Cherri v. Mueller, 951 F. Supp. 2d 918, \n44 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 45 of 65\n937 (E.D. Mich. 2013) (upholding equal protection claim because “[p]laintiffs have adequately \npled that Defendants have a policy, custom and practice of questioning only Muslim–\nAmerican[s] at the border about their religious practices and beliefs.”).  \nIn further support of the equal protection claim, the Amended Complaint also provides \nsufficient facts from which to infer that similarly situated white or Christian individuals do not \nreceive the same treatment as their Muslim counterparts.  Plaintiffs allege that \n[W]hen Defendants review lists of social networks and known associates of a \ncurrently watchlisted individual, they routinely chose to nominate Arab or \nMuslim names that cross their desk on the stereotyped basis of race, religion, or \nnational origin alone. Meanwhile, Defendants gloss over any stereotypically \nwhite, Christian, English, or Western-European names that may appear in the \nsame network lists, such as classmates or colleagues. This is true even when the \nonly distinction between a nominated person and a non-nominated person are \nimproper race, religion, or national origin criteria. \n \nECF No. 48 ¶ 198.  See also id. ¶ 201 (“[T]hough they facially satisfy the same known associate \nwatchlist criteria, close families and friends of convicted white-nationalist domestic terrorists are \nnot routinely added to the federal terrorist watchlist, while distant families and friends of \ninnocent Muslims often discover that their mere association with other watchlisted individuals \nhas caused them to be labeled potential terrorists.”).   \n  The Amended Complaint next provides specific instances of white Christians not in the \nTSDB whose conduct would likely have led to TSDB inclusion if they were Muslim.  Lieutenant \nChristopher Hasson was indicted on February 20, 2019 for plotting a large-scale domestic \nterrorist attack.  Id. ¶ 202.  Yet, “[d]espite significant evidence of Hasson’s extremism and \npotential for terrorism, not only does it appear that [] Hasson not on the terrorism watchlist, he \nheld a Secret level security clearance.”  Id.  “Nor is there any reason to believe any of Hasson’s \nfriends or relatives have been added to the watchlist,” even though the same would not have been \ntrue of the Muslim friends and relatives of a known or suspected Muslim terrorist.  Id.  \n45 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 46 of 65\n   With regard to Plaintiffs’ own experiences, Plaintiff Suliman and his Muslim travel \ncompanions were subjected to extensive additional screening and searches at the airport arising \nfrom Suliman’s inclusion in the TSDB.  However, a similarly situated non-Muslim travel \ncompanion was inexplicably not searched, detained, or subjected to any additional screening.  Id. \n¶¶ 739.  Such allegations, construed broadly, underscore how Muslim individuals may be \nnominated to Watchlists while similarly situated non-Muslims may not.    \nIn addition to concrete examples of disparate treatment, Plaintiffs also aver direct \nevidence of discriminatory animus.  To be sure, a stray remark by a non-decisionmaker does not \nalone support an equal protection violation.  See Orgain v. City of Salisbury, 521 F. Supp. 2d \n465, 492–93 (D. Md. 2007), aff’d in part sub nom. Orgain v. City of Salisbury, Md., 305 F. \nApp’x 90 (4th Cir. 2008).  When viewed cumulatively, however, such remarks can support an \nequal protection claim.  See ECF No. 48 ¶ 1148 (CBP officer telling Mujanovic to remove her \nhijab to avoid travel delays); ¶ 759 (CBP officer telling Suliman that “lately, most of the people \nthat come into [a secondary screening] room are from your background”); ¶ 659 (TSA agent \ninterrogating El-Shahat and informing him that “he is subjected to enhanced screening because \nhe frequently travels to countries in the Middle East, because he travels alone, and because he is \na Muslim male”).  Viewing the entirety of these facts as true and most favorably to Plaintiffs, \nDefendants’ discriminatory intent is plausibly established.  \nThe Court determines next whether Defendants’ discriminatory actions are “suitably \ntailored to serve a compelling state interest” such that they survive strict scrutiny.  City of \nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 440.  If the government’s stated interests “could be achieved by narrower \nordinances that burden [the right] to a far lesser degree,” then the actions are not narrowly \ntailored.  Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993).  \n46 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 47 of 65\nNational security undoubtedly constitutes a compelling government interest.  See Holder v. \nHumanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 28 (2010) (“[T]he Government’s interest in combating \nterrorism is an urgent objective of the highest order.”); Mohamed v. Holder, 266 F. Supp. 3d at \n880.  Whether Defendants’ actions are narrowly tailored, however, is a fact-dependent question \ninappropriate for complete resolution at this stage.   \nPlaintiffs thus far have alleged enough to show that the government’s interests could be \nachieved in a more effective and targeted, and less burdensome, alternative.  Specifically, \nPlaintiffs argue that the TSDB and Watchlist system is ineffective, having “never prevented an \nact of terrorism inside the United States.”  ECF No. 48 ¶ 8.  It is also imprecise and overbroad, as \nit fails to include those committing attacks.  Indeed, Plaintiffs allege that none of the 250 acts of \nterrorism committed within the U.S. were perpetrated by anyone from within the database.  Id. ¶ \n179–80.  Further, the government’s internal audits reveal “serious flaws” and “significant \nproblems with the nomination and removal process.”  Id. ¶ 228.  Defendants may later show that \nthe policy is effective and suitably tailored to achieving its national security interests, but for \nnow, Plaintiffs’ allegations are sufficient.  Count V survives as to Plaintiffs who have alleged \ninclusion in the TSDB. \nF.  Violation of the Fourth Amendment (Count VI) and Fifth Amendment Self-\nIncrimination (Count VIII) \n   \nThe Court next turns to claims asserting violations of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments \narising from discrete searches and seizures, as well as interrogations, of certain Plaintiffs (Counts \nVI, VIII).  ECF No. 49-1 at 81–82.  Defendants again correctly note that these claims must go \nforward, if at all, only as to those Plaintiffs who allege an unconstitutional search or \ninterrogation.  Defendants further press that even those Plaintiffs who allege a historic Fourth or \n47 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 48 of 65\nFifth Amendment violation lack standing because none have alleged any specific plans for future \ninternational travel and so have not averred risk of future injury.  ECF No. 49-1 at 81.   \nDefendants are correct that because Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, “they \nmust establish an ongoing or future injury in fact.”  Kenny v. Wilson, 885 F.3d 280, 287 (4th Cir. \n2018) (citing O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495–96 (1974)).  “Past exposure to illegal \nconduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief . . . if \nunaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects.”  O’Shea, 414 U.S. at 495–96. \nSpeculative claims of future injury will not suffice.  Id. at 497.   \nHowever, where as here, Plaintiffs aver a historic pattern of such violations during \nsimilar travel, the Court may plausibly infer that such infringements will continue in the future.  \nSee Elhady v. Kable, 391 F. Supp. 3d 562, 575 (E.D. Va. 2019); Mohamed, 266 F.Supp.3d at 875 \n(“Plaintiff’s decision not to engage in international travel because of the difficulties he \nreasonably expects to encounter upon return to the United States is sufficient to demonstrate \nstanding.”); Wilwal v. Nielsen, 346 F. Supp. 3d 1290, 1302 (D. Minn. 2018) (same); Alasaad v. \nNielsen, No. 17-CV-11730-DJC, 2018 WL 2170323, at *11 (D. Mass. May 9, 2018) (similar);  \nCherri, 951 F. Supp. 2d at 929 (similar); but see Jibril v. Wolf, No. 1:19-CV-2457-RCL, 2020 \nWL 2331870, at *4 (D.D.C. May 9, 2020) (no standing for plaintiffs who alleged a series of \nminimal disruptions during the course of one international trip because they could not show \nconcrete and immediate future travel plans).  Simply put, Plaintiffs may demonstrate that what is \npast is also prologue, and this is sufficient to confer standing. \nThe Plaintiffs averring Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations have alleged not only \nhistoric and repeated illegal searches and seizures but particular needs or desires to travel in the \nfuture.  See, e.g., ECF No. 48 ¶ 1164 (Mujanovic) ¶ 448 (Abdurrashid), ¶ 715 (Sulayman).  The \n48 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 49 of 65\nCourt may thus reasonably infer that Plaintiffs not only will travel in the future, see Alasaad, \n2018 WL 2170323, at *11, but be subjected to similar unconstitutional searches and seizures \nwhen they do.  See Suhre v. Haywood Cty., 131 F.3d 1083, 1088 (4th Cir. 1997) (“[P]ast injury \n[i]s probative of likely future injury.”).  The Court rejects Defendants’ standing challenge. \n The Court next turns to the Amended Complaint to determine whether Plaintiffs \nsufficiently aver Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations. \n1.  Violation of the Fourth Amendment (Count VI) \n \nCertain Plaintiffs allege that government agents seized and forensically searched their \nelectronic devices in violation of their Fourth Amendment right to be free from warrantless \nsearches and seizures.  ECF No. 48 ¶¶ 1621–31.  The Fourth Amendment establishes that “[t]he \nright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable \nsearches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable \ncause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and \nthe persons or things to be seized.”  U.S. Const. amend. IV.  Generally, “searches conducted \noutside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se \nunreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.”  Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 357 (1967).   \nOne well established exception to the warrant requirement covers searches conducted at \nthe border.  Recognizing that national security remains at its “zenith” at ports of entry, including \ninternational airports, law enforcement may conduct routine searches of persons and property \neven in the absence of a warrant, probable cause, or even any individualized suspicion.  United \nStates v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531, 538 (1985); United States v. Kolsuz, 890 F.3d \n133, 137 (4th Cir. 2018), as amended (May 18, 2018).  The “border exception” is grounded in \nthe recognition that individual liberties must sometimes yield to the “longstanding right of the \n49 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 50 of 65\nsovereign to protect itself by stopping and examining persons and property crossing into this \ncountry,” United States v. Flores-Montano, 541 U.S. 149, 152–53 (2004) (quoting United States \nv. Ramsey, 431 U.S. 606, 616 (1977).  Thus, to protect and secure U.S. borders, “the Fourth \nAmendment’s balance of reasonableness is qualitatively different . . . than in the interior. . . .”  \nMontoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. at 537–40.   \nBut the exception is not limitless.  After all, “[t]he suspicionless search is the very evil \nthe Fourth Amendment was intended to stamp out.”  Samson v. California, 547 U.S. 843, 858 \n(2006) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Not every search at the border is “routine” and thus immune \nfrom the individualized suspicion requirement.  Although the Supreme Court has not clarified the \nprecise standard used for non-routine searches, where law enforcement conducts “highly \nintrusive searches of the personal-dignity and privacy interests of the person” some “support a \nrequirement of some level of suspicion” is necessary.  Flores-Montano, 541 U.S. at 152. See also \nMontoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. at 541 (requiring reasonable suspicion of alimentary drug \nsmuggling in order to extensively detain individual). \n  In the Fourth Circuit, a “forensic border search of a phone must be treated as nonroutine,” \nand permitted only with individualized reasonable suspicion.  Kolsuz, 890 F.3d at 144–45 (a \nforensic search of devices “dwarfs the amount of personal information that can be carried over a \nborder . . .[t]he average 400–gigabyte laptop hard drive can store over 200 million pages. . . \n[e]ven a car full of packed suitcases with sensitive documents cannot hold a candle to the sheer, \nand ever-increasing, capacity of digital storage.”) (quotation marks and citation omitted).  See \nalso US v. Aigbekaen, 943 F.3d 714, 723 (4th Cir 2019) (“We simply apply the teaching of \nKolsuz: where a search at the border is so intrusive as to require some level of individualized \nsuspicion, the object of that suspicion must bear some nexus to the purposes of the border search \n50 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 51 of 65\nexception in order for the exception to apply.”).  Reasonable suspicion exists when “specific and \narticulable facts” known to the searching officers, along with “rational inferences from those \nfacts,” demonstrate that criminal activity is afoot.  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21 (1967).  A \n“mere hunch” is not enough.  United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 274 (2002).  Whether \nreasonable suspicion exists depends on the totality of the circumstances observed by a reasonable \nlaw enforcement officer in the agent’s position.  Id. at 274–75; see also United States v. Cortez, \n449 U.S. 411, 418 (1981).  \n  For certain Plaintiffs, agents confiscated their electronic devices and downloaded their \ncontents with a level of intrusiveness sufficient to deem the search nonroutine and thus requiring \nindividualized reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.  See, e.g., ECF No. 48 ¶¶ 495, 563, 636, \n1151, 1492, 1516, 1625.  Further, these searches, as pleaded, were without reasonable suspicion \nthat each Plaintiff was engaged in terrorist activity.   Thus, as to those Plaintiffs subjected to this \nkind of warrantless search, the claims survive challenge. \nDefendants respond that the searching agents possessed such reasonable articulable \nsuspicion by virtue of Plaintiffs’ inclusion in the TSDB.  ECF No. 53 at 32–33.  TSDB \nmembership, argue Defendants, provides the very individualized evidence that every Plaintiff “is \nengaged, has been engaged, or intends to engage, in conduct . . . in preparation for, in aid or \nfurtherance of, or related to, terrorism and/or terrorist activities.”  ECF No. 48-6 at 5.   \nAlthough Defendants may be correct in the end, the Court must at this stage confine its \nanalysis to the Amended Complaint.  Plaintiffs aver lifetime inclusion in the TSDB based on \nassociational status, religious belief, race, or travel preference.  See ECF No. 48 ¶¶ 10, 194–95.  \nThey claim that the TSDB includes over one million people precisely because the inclusion \n51 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 52 of 65\ncriteria is grossly nonspecific.  Mere membership in the database, therefore, cannot supply \nindividualized reasonable articulable suspicion.  As the Court in Mohamed v. Holder aptly noted: \nWhat constitutes conduct sufficiently “related to” or “in aid of terrorism” is not \nexplained, but it is not difficult to imagine completely innocent conduct serving as \nthe starting point for a string of subjective, speculative inferences that result in a \nperson’s inclusion on the No Fly List. For example, is the academic study of \nterrorism or the investigative reporting of terrorist activities “related to terrorism \nand terrorist activities”? Is providing financial support to a charitable organization \nenough, even without knowledge that some of the organization’s activities are “in \naid of ... terrorist activities”? Is it enough to be a member of a lawfully operating \nsocial or religious organization whose membership may include other persons \nsuspected of terrorism? Is studying Arabic abroad, as Mohamed concedes he did, \nconduct “in preparation for ... terrorist activities”?  \n \n995 F. Supp. 2d at 532.  \nThe TSDB cannot serve as a proxy for individualized reasonable suspicion that an \nindividual plaintiff is engaging in—or intends to engage in—terrorist activity at all, let alone at \nthe time of the search.  Id.  Accordingly, for those Plaintiffs who have averred facts to make \nplausible that they had been subjected to a non-routine search of their devices, Defendants’ \nmotion is denied.18  As to all other Plaintiffs, the motion is granted. \n2.  Violation of the Fifth Amendment – Self-Incrimination (Count VIII) \n \nPlaintiffs whose electronic devices were searched during border interrogations bring a \ncompanion Fifth Amendment challenge for being “forced” to provide cellphone and laptop \npasswords and “biometric means such as facial recognition or fingerprints” to facilitate searches \nof the devices.  ECF No. 48 ¶ 1644.  They argue specifically that such information amounts to \ncompelled testimony sufficient to support a Fifth Amendment self-incrimination claim.  Id. ¶ \n1646.   \n \n18 Plaintiffs are: Jardaneh, Doe, Abdurrashid, H. Wehelie, A. Wehelie, Noor, F. Wehelie, Mohallim, El-\nShahat, Sulayman, Suliman, Doe 2, Sehwail, Albadawi, Hall, Knight, Thadi, E. Paryavi, Siddiqui, Muminov, \nMujanovic, Hachem, Riad, Kamel, Abunijem, Hijaz, Soueidan, Elamin, Kadoumi, and Al-Sahlani. \n \n52 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 53 of 65\nThe Fifth Amendment provides that no person “shall be compelled in any criminal case \nto be a witness against himself.”  U.S. Const. amend. V.  This constitutional protection is \ntriggered only when the individual is (1) compelled to make a (2) testimonial communication (3) \nthat is incriminating.  Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 408; United States v. Sweets, 526 \nF.3d 122, 127 (4th Cir. 2007).  Determining whether the right applies is decidedly a fact-\nintensive inquiry.  See Fisher, 425 U.S. at 410.   \nThe parties focus on whether Plaintiffs’ “forced” use of “biometric” information to \nunlock devices is testimonial.  Plaintiffs urge the Court to narrow the focus solely to whether \n“forcing” Plaintiffs to give over electronic pass codes, to or use their thumbs or faces to unlock \ntheir devices, can make out a Fifth Amendment violation.  Perhaps in the hope that yet another \nCourt will weigh in on an unsettled question of law, see, e.g., Matter of Residence in Oakland, \nCalifornia, 345 F. Supp. 3d 1010, 1015–16 (N.D. Ca. 2019), dismissing review, No. 19-MJ-\n70053-KAW-1 (JD), 2019 WL 6716356 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 10, 2019), Plaintiffs artificially attempt \nto parse the claim in a manner which does violence to the settled jurisprudence in this area.  This \nthe Court is not willing to do.   \nRather, the Court must consider the more fundamental question of whether any Plaintiff \nhas alleged sufficiently coercive circumstances that plausibly give rise to an inference that any \nincriminating testimony was involuntarily obtained.  The Fifth Amendment “speaks of \ncompulsion.”  Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 427 (1984) (citation omitted).  A statement is \ncompelled when “considering the totality of the circumstances, the free will of the [person \nmaking the statement] was overborne.”  United States v. Washington, 431 U.S. 181, 188 (1977) \n(citing Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U.S. 534, 544 (1961)).  “To determine whether a defendant’s \nwill has been overborne or his capacity for self-determination critically impaired, courts must \n53 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 54 of 65\nconsider the ‘totality of the circumstances,’ including the characteristics of the defendant, the \nsetting of the interview, and the details of the interrogation.”  United States v. Braxton, 112 F.3d \n777, 781 (4th Cir. 1997) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  \n Certain Plaintiffs have averred sufficient facts to make plausible the claim that their will \nhad been overborne during their interrogations.  These are the Plaintiffs whose interviews arose \nunder coercive circumstances such as being held at gunpoint, see, e.g., ECF No. 48 ¶ 1098, in \nhandcuffs, see, e.g., id. ¶¶ 318, 382, 390, 1099, or in separate interrogation rooms.  See, e.g., id. \n¶¶ 530, 613, 1279.  These same plaintiffs were often subjected to lengthy detentions during \nwhich access to family or counsel was denied.  See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 313–15, 506, 614–15, 640, 1197–\n201.  Additionally, Defendants do not dispute that the purpose of the interrogations was to gather \ninformation regarding terrorist activities, so any such interview may be plausibly inferred as \ndesigned to elicit incriminatory statements.  Thus, certain Plaintiffs allege sufficient facts to \nmake plausible that their Fifth Amendment rights against compelled self-incrimination had been \nviolated.19 \nAccordingly, the more nuanced and perhaps legally titillating question of whether \nprovision of cell phone passcodes or biometric information amounts to testimonial statements \nsimply cannot be ascertained at the motion to dismiss stage.  Once discovery is obtained on each \nalleged incident in which Plaintiffs’ right against self-incrimination was allegedly abridged, the \nCourt will be in a better position to determine whether this narrower question matters at all as to \n \n19 The Plaintiffs that plead sufficient facts to make plausible a Fifth Amendment Self-Incrimination \nviolation are: Jardaneh, Doe, Abdurrashid, M. Paryavi, H. Wehelie, A. Wehelie, F. Wehelie, Mohallim, El-Shahat, \nSulayman, Suliman, Doe 2, Sehwail, Albadawi, Hall, Knight, E. Paryavi, Siddiqui, Cyeef Din, Muminov, \nMujanovic, Hachem, Riad, Kamel, Hijaz, Souiedan, Elamin, Kadoumi, and Al-Sahlani.  \n \n54 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 55 of 65\nthose Plaintiffs who have pleaded facts sufficient to make plausible a Fifth Amendment self-\nincrimination violation. \nG.  Violation of the First Amendment (Count VII) \nPlaintiffs separately allege that the searches of their electronic devices violate their \nfreedom of expressive association as protected under the First Amendment.  ECF No. 48 ¶¶ \n1634, 1638; ECF No. 52 at 63.  Because the “[g]overnment takes the data they obtain from \nprivate searches and uses it to nominate the friends and relatives of Plaintiffs to the watchlist as \nwell,” avers Plaintiffs, the government “directly interferes with Plaintiffs’ ability to freely \nassociate with those individuals.”  ECF No. 52 at 63. \nThe First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides that “Congress shall make no \nlaw. . .  abridging the freedom of speech . . . or the right of the people peaceably to assemble.”  \nU.S. CONST. amend. I.  The Supreme Court has “long understood as implicit in the right to \nengage in activities protected by the First Amendment a corresponding right to associate with \nothers in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious, and \ncultural ends.”  Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 622 (1984).   \n  This right, however, is not absolute.  The law recognizes that some difficulty imposed on \nsuch freedoms do not “without more, result in violation of the First Amendment.”  Fighting \nFinest, Inc. v. Bratton, 95 F.3d 224, 228 (2d Cir. 1996).  “To be cognizable, the interference with \nassociational rights must be ‘direct and substantial’ or ‘significant.’”  Id. (quoting Lyng v. Int’l \nUnion, 485 U.S. 360, 366, 367 & n. 5 (1988)) (further citation omitted)).  Interferences that \nqualify as “direct and substantial” could include “impos[ing] penalties or withhold[ing] benefits \nfrom individuals because of their membership in a disfavored group . . . , attempt[ing] to require \ndisclosure of the fact of membership in a group seeking anonymity, and . . . interfere[ing] with \n55 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 56 of 65\nthe internal organization or affairs of the group.”  U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. at 622–23 (internal \ncitations omitted).  Plaintiffs, therefore, must allege government action that imposed a direct and \nsubstantial interference with association in pursuit of political, social, economic, educational, \nreligious, or cultural ends.  See id.  \nDefendants level a host of arguments to defeat this claim. The Court need not tick \nthrough all of them because the bare bones allegations simply do not make the claim plausible. \nThe Amended Complaint alleges loosely that Plaintiffs have the protected right to associate, but \nwholly fails to identify the association—religious, social, religious, or otherwise—that \ngovernment action has inhibited.  U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. at 622.  Desired association with the \ncontacts in one’s phone is simply not enough.  This alone defeats the claim. \nAlternatively, no averred facts make plausible that any interference was “direct and \nsubstantial.”  Plaintiffs aver only that government agents obtained their “contacts” and included \nthat information on the TSDB after cursory investigation.  But they give not one example of how \nsuch government conduct has hampered, hindered, impacted, or affected in any way their \nassociation with said “contacts.”  Cf. NAACP v. State of Ala. ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, \n462–63 (1958) (disclosure of membership in organization sufficient to “induce members to \nwithdraw from the Association and dissuade others from joining it because of fear of exposure of \ntheir beliefs shown through their associations and of the consequences of this exposure.”); AFL-\nCIO v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 333 F.3d 168 (D.C. Cir. 2003).  Without any allegations \nregarding the limitations on Plaintiffs’ ability to associate, the Court cannot even begin to \ndetermine whether Defendants’ actions infringe on Plaintiffs’ associational rights protected \nunder the First Amendment.  The claim must be dismissed.  \n56 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 57 of 65\nH.  Plaintiffs’ RFRA Claims (Counts X, XI, XII, XIII)20  \nPlaintiffs bring four discrete claims pursuant to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \n(“RFRA”), 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000bb et seq. Plaintiffs allege that: (1) agents’ interrogations related \nto religious beliefs substantially burden Plaintiffs’ exercise of religion (Count X); (2) Watchlist \nplacement as to Sulayman and Siddiqui substantially burdens Sulayman’s and Siddiqui’s \nperformance of Umrah21 and Hajj,22 respectively, id. ¶¶ 1667–80 (Count XI); (3) agents’ offers \nto remove Hall and John Doe from Watchlists if they agreed to act as informants burdened their \nreligious freedom, id. ¶¶ 1681–93 (Count XII); and (4) disclosure of Plaintiff Elamin’s Watchlist \nstatus burdened his religion by leading to his termination as a prison chaplain, id. ¶¶ 1694–706 \n(Count XIII).  \nThe RFRA provides that the “Government shall not substantially burden a person’s \nexercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, except . . . if it \ndemonstrates that application of the burden to the person-(1) is in furtherance of a compelling \ngovernmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling \ngovernmental interest.”  42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb–1(a)-(b).  Thus, in analyzing a claim under the \nRFRA, the Court must ask whether the government’s action imposes a substantial burden on \nreligious exercise, and if so, whether those actions are the least restrictive means of serving a \ncompelling government interest.  Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 691 (2014). \nThe RFRA defines “religious exercise” to include “any exercise of religion, whether or \nnot compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.”  42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb–2(4), \n \n20 Plaintiffs reaffirm they are not seeking money damages under RFRA against any of the Defendants in \ntheir official capacities.  ECF No. 52 at 77.  The Court limits the claims and defenses accordingly.   \n \n21 Umrah is a pilgrimage made by Muslims to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, that may be performed at any time \nduring the year.  ECF No. 48 ¶ 671.  \n \n22 Hajj is a pilgrimage made by Muslims to Mecca during a specific time of the year.  Id.  \n57 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 58 of 65\n2000cc–5(7).  A litigant’s claimed beliefs “must be sincere and the practices at issue must be of a \nreligious nature.”  Levitan v. Ashcroft, 281 F.3d 1313, 1320 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  A substantial \nburden is one that “put[s] substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to \nviolate his beliefs . . . or one that forces a person to choose between following the precepts of her \nreligion and forfeiting [governmental] benefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of the \nprecepts of her religion . . . on the other hand.”  Lovelace v. Lee, 472 F.3d 174, 187 (4th Cir. \n2006) (quoting Thomas v. Review Bd., 450 U.S. 707, 718 (1981) and Sherbert v. Verner, 374 \nU.S. 398, 404 (1963)).   \nIn assessing whether a plaintiff’s exercise of her religious beliefs has been substantially \nburdened, a court must not judge whether the plaintiff’s beliefs “are mistaken or insubstantial,” \nbut rather “whether the line drawn reflects an honest conviction.”  Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at \n724–25 (2014) (citation and quotation marks omitted); see also Employment Div., Dep’t of \nHuman Res. of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 887 (1990) (“Repeatedly and in many different \ncontexts, we have warned that courts must not presume to determine the place of a particular \nbelief in a religion or the plausibility of a religious claim.”). \nDefendants broadly argue that all the RFRA claims must be dismissed because, as a \nmatter of law, the challenged actions are the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling \ngovernment interest.  ECF No. 49-1 at 108.  It is undisputed that the government maintains a \ncompelling interest in national security, which includes protection of our borders and prevention \nof terrorist attacks.  See Haig, 453 U.S. at 307 (“It is obvious and inarguable that no \ngovernmental interest is more compelling than the security of the Nation.”); Humanitarian Law \nProject, 561 U.S. at 28.  The Court will not belabor that point here.  But whether the \ngovernment’s implementation of such policies aimed at protection are in fact the least restrictive \n58 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 59 of 65\nmeans is inextricably intertwined with whether the same acts impose a substantial burden on the \nindividual Plaintiffs forming the subject of the RFRA counts.  The inquiry, therefore, is best left \nfor exploration at discovery to the extent the claim survives challenge on more specific grounds \naddressed below.   \nThe Court next turns to each RFRA claim separately. \n1.  General Intrusion of Religious Practice (Count X) \n \nPlaintiffs confine this claim to the substantial burden exacted “when the government \nconducts an intrusive inquiry into a person’s religious beliefs as a component of official \ngovernment action.”  ECF No. 48 ¶ 1660.  This is because “[s]uch inquiries place pressure on the \nperson to modify or violate their beliefs and singles them out for disfavored treatment.”  Id. ¶ \n1660.  The Court finds certain Plaintiffs allege plausible violations.   \nIn conjunction with invasive screening at airports and land borders, Plaintiffs have been \ndetained and questioned for hours specifically about their religious beliefs.  Although Defendants \nmaintain the questioning is “wholly secular,” the Amended Complaint facts say otherwise.  See \ne.g., id. ¶ 485 (mosque details, religious beliefs and practices); ¶ 504 (church attendance, \nenrollment in religious courses); ¶ 650 (mosque attendance, views on  jihad, religious leadership, \ndegree of religiousness); ¶ 1147 (differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims); ¶ 1238 (Hajj \nattendance, discussions with others about religion).  The “very process of inquiry” may itself \nimpose a substantial burden on the individuals’ religious beliefs, such that it amounts to a RFRA \nviolation.  See generally N.L.R.B. v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U.S. 490, 502 (1979); Cf. \nMitchell v. Helms, 530 U.S. 793, 828 (2000) (“[I]nquiry into the recipient’s religious views \nrequired by a focus on whether a school is pervasively sectarian is not only unnecessary but also \noffensive. It is well established, in numerous other contexts, that courts should refrain from \n59 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 60 of 65\ntrolling through a person’s or constitution’s religious beliefs”).  As pleaded, Defendants’ singling \nout of Plaintiffs and their persistent inquiry into Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs and practices places \npressure on Plaintiffs to modify or violate those beliefs or risk being subjected to the pattern of \ndetentions and interrogations in connection with their travel.  See United States v. Ramon, 86 F. \nSupp. 2d 665, 676 (W.D. Tex. 2000) (finding that governmental policy of detaining and \nquestioning individuals who display religious decals on their vehicles “threatens to burden the \nsincerely held beliefs of those who do so for the purpose of emphasizing their faith.”); ECF No. \n48 ¶ 488; ¶ 507; ¶ 1152.  \nPlaintiffs further aver that the questioning has punitive consequences because the “details \nof Plaintiffs’ adherence to the Muslim faith” is the reason they end up on the Watchlists, id. ¶ \n1662, and so all of the attendant harms that flow from Watchlist placement imposes a substantial \nburden on their free exercise of religion.  Cf. Brown v. Woodland Joint Unified School Dist., 27 \nF.3d 1373, 1378 (9th Cir. 1994) (“A government practice has the effect of impermissibly . . . \ndisapproving of religion if it is ‘sufficiently likely to be perceived by. . . nonadherents [of the \ncontrolling denomination] as a disapproval[] of their individual religious choices.”) (quoting \nSchool Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 390 (1985)); Cherri, 951 F. Supp. 2d at 935 \n(dismissing RFRA claim where plaintiffs did not plead that questioning “require[d] them to \naffirm or deny a belief that is contrary to their faith” nor that the Government “sought to impose \ncivil or criminal sanctions on religiously motivated conduct.”).  The Court agrees and finds that \nthe Amended Complaint sufficiently states a RFRA claim as to Count X.  Once again, the Court \ndenies dismissal only as to those Plaintiffs who have averred interrogations about their Muslim \nbeliefs or practices.23  The claim is dismissed as to all other Plaintiffs.  \n \n23 Those Plaintiffs are: Doe, M. Paryavi, H. Wehelie, El-Shahat, Sulayman, Doe 2, Knight, Mujanovic, \nMuminov, Hachem, Riad, Kamel, Hijaz, Elamin, Kadoumi, and Al-Sahlani.  \n60 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 61 of 65\n2.  Violation of the RFRA – Umrah/Hajj (Count XI) \nCount XI is brought solely by Plaintiffs Sulayman and Siddiqui, who allege that inclusion \nin the Watchlist interferes with their ability to perform Umrah and Hajj respectively.  ECF No. \n48 ¶ 1667–80.  Defendants do not contest that Plaintiffs maintain sincerely held religious beliefs \nin performing Umrah and Hajj.  Rather, they argue that “nothing alleged . . . has prevented or \nwill prevent Sulayman or Siddiqui from travelling abroad to perform religious pilgrimages or \nfrom participating in any religious exercise.”  ECF No. 49-1 at 106.  \nThe Court cannot agree with Defendants.  Sulayman, as an Imam, “routinely” leads \ngroups on an annual Umrah pilgrimage to Mecca.  ECF No. 48 ¶ 671.  However, due to \nDefendants’ stigmatizing and burdensome searches, interrogations, and detentions, he is afraid to \ntravel abroad again, id. ¶ 715, and so is “discouraged” from engaging in Umrah.  Id.  Sulayman \nhas also lost his standing in his religious community, which has jeopardized his effectiveness as \ntheir leader going forward, and more particularly in guiding his congregation in Umrah.  Id. ¶¶ \n715, 1671.  Similarly, Siddiqui alleges that repeated invasive detentions and searches has caused \nhim to abandon performing Hajj “out of fear of the terrorist scrutiny and treatment he would \nreceive by Defendants.”  Id. ¶¶ 1672; 1012.  The Court concludes that both Plaintiffs adequately \nallege that they had to modify their behavior in a manner that violates their religious beliefs.  Cf. \nLiberty Univ., Inc. v. Lew, 733 F.3d 72, 99–100 (4th Cir. 2013).   \nDefendants alternatively argue that the claim fails because Plaintiffs have been only \ndeprived, in part, of certain aspects of religious exercise.  ECF No. 49-1 at 107 (“That Plaintiffs \ndo not cross the border anymore so that they can avoid religious questioning is not the equivalent \nof ceasing their participation in the tenets of their religion.”).  But a RFRA violation does not \nturn on government’s total prohibition of religious exercise; rather where, as here, allegations \n61 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 62 of 65\nreflect a substantial burden on such exercise in the absence of a compelling government interest \neffected by the least restrictive means, the claim must survive.  See Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at \n724; Smith, 494 U.S. at 887.  Defendants’ motion to dismiss Count XI is denied. \n3.  Violation of the RFRA – Informant Pressure (Count XII) \nCount XII focuses on Plaintiffs Hall and John Doe 2 who specifically aver that offers to \nact as informants for the FBI in exchange for resolution of their travel woes substantially burden \ntheir free exercise of religion.  ECF No. 48 ¶¶ 795, 935.  In particular, Hall and Doe 2 contend \nthat because their religious beliefs restrict bearing false witness and betraying the trust of their \nreligious community, they are prohibited from accepting this offer.  Id. ¶¶ 797, 937, 1686–87.  \nDefendants do not contest that acting as an informant is in fact at odds with Hall and Doe \n2’s sincerely held religious beliefs.  However, Defendants rightfully point out that a mere “ask” \nfor assistance in exchange for favorable treatment does not constitute a substantial burden on free \nexercise.  ECF No. 49-1 at 107.  The Court agrees with Defendants. \nAs with all potential law enforcement informants, the relationship begins with an “ask,” \nand possible favorable treatment in exchange for helpful information.  Also, as with many \n“asks,” they too begin with the potential informant having something to gain, and often \nsomething to lose, from saying yes.  Suspects are sometimes paid for their testimony or “work \noff charges” in exchange for turning on their friends, coworkers, family, and community leaders.  \nThis Hobson’s choice is the same faced by scores of suspects who enter into cooperation \nagreements with the government on a daily basis.  Plaintiffs’ choice is a variation on this theme.  \nAs pleaded, the Court can discern no principled reason to find the mere offer of a chance to \ncooperate as placing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion sufficient to support a RFRA \nviolation.  Count XI is dismissed. \n62 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 63 of 65\n4.  Inability to Volunteer at Prisons or Jails (Count XIII) \n \nIn the fourth RFRA Count (Count XIII), Plaintiff Elamin alleges that Defendants’ \ndisclosure of his Watchlist status caused Jessup Correctional Institute (“Jessup”) to end his stint \nas a volunteer prison chaplain.  ECF No. 48 ¶¶ 1423–27; 1694–706.  Defendants, in response, \nargue that Elamin does not have standing to bring a RFRA claim as Jessup is not a party to this \nsuit.  ECF No. 49-1 at 101–03.  Defendants do not contest that Jessup knew of Elamin’s \nWatchlist status, but instead argue that it was the state correctional facility’s independent \ndecision to deny Elamin’s volunteer services that imposed, even in theory, the substantial burden \non the exercise of his religion.  ECF No 49-1 at 101.  When viewing the Amended Complaint \nfacts as true and most favorably to Elamin, the Court must agree with Defendants. \n In Frank Krasner Enterprises, Ltd. v. Montgomery County. Md., the Fourth Circuit had \nthe opportunity to address under what circumstances a non-party’s intervening decisions break \nthe “causal chain” between the claimed government action and the plaintiff’s potentially \nredressable injury.  401 F.3d 230 (4th Cir. 2005).  There, the government regulation at issue was \na law prohibiting the appropriation of county funds to any entity permitting the display of guns at \nany of its facilities.  Id. at 232.  The non-party convention center, in response to the County \nregulation, refused to provide display space to the plaintiff gun-show promoter.  Id. at 232–33.  \nPlaintiff sued the County, not the convention center, for violating, among other things, his First \nAmendment free speech rights.  Id. at 233.   \nThe Fourth Circuit held that the plaintiff lacked standing because the injuries stemmed \nfrom the non-party convention center’s independent decision to not lease the space.  Id. at 236.  \nImportantly, the Court reasoned that when standing “depends on the unfettered choices made by \nindependent actors not before the courts and whose exercise of broad and legitimate discretion \n63 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 64 of 65\nthe courts cannot presume either to control or to predict,” the causal chain necessary to confer \nstanding has been severed.  Frank Krasner, 401 F.3d at 235 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. 562) \n(emphasis in original).  The Court went on to find that the plaintiff could not obtain redress \nbecause even if it were to succeed in its claim, invalidating the County regulation would not \nnecessarily result in plaintiff’s ability to lease space from the convention center.  Id.  \n  As pleaded, Elamin’s claims suffer the same fate.  The Amended Complaint avers that \nnon-party Jessup, having received information regarding Elamin’s Watchlist status, terminated \nElamin.  ECF No. 48 at ¶ 1426.  No facts support that Jessup’s decision was other than \nindependent, voluntary, and intervening, even if prompted by Elamin’s presence on the various \nWatchlists.  Id. at ¶¶ 1423–27.  Further, to the extent such information is corrected and he is \nremoved from the Watchlist, this does not redress Elamin’s injury as it pertains to his removal as \nJessup’s chaplain.  Only Jessup may redress the substantial burden that it placed on Elamin’s \nexercise of his position as prison chaplain.  Jessup, however, is not a party to this case.  \nAccordingly, Count XIII is dismissed for lack of standing.  \nI.  Violation of the Non-Delegation Doctrine (Count XIV) \n \nPlaintiffs’ last claim is mired in confusion.  Plaintiffs initially alleged that Congress \nviolated the non-delegation doctrine by failing to provide the Executive Branch with intelligible \nprinciples from which the Executive could implement its watchlist schemes regarding civil \naviation and national security.  ECF No. 48 ¶¶ 1708–12.  Plaintiffs later withdrew such \nallegations entirely.  ECF No. 52 at 77 (“To be fair, this is not a typical nondelegation claim, in \nwhich there is a statute authorizing the creation of a massive, far-reaching, and highly-\nconsequential terrorist watchlist, but did not provide an intelligible principle.”).  \n64 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 73   Filed 07/20/20   Page 65 of 65\nPlaintiffs also allege that Defendants acted outside of their statutory authority.  ECF No. \n48 ¶¶ 1713–18.  The Court notes that such allegations do not amount to a violation of the non-\ndelegation doctrine, which provides that “Congress may not constitutionally delegate its \nlegislative power to another branch of Government.”  Touby v. United States, 500 U.S. 160, 165 \n(1991).  Plaintiffs have done little to assist the Court or Defendants in understanding this claim—\nnot in their 268 page Amended Complaint or in the robust pleadings submitted over the course of \nseveral months.  As the Court views it, Plaintiffs have jettisoned the claim; the Court will not \nshore it up for them now. The claim is dismissed.24   \nV.  Conclusion  \n  For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in \npart.25  Following the issuance of the opinion, the Court will hold a discovery conference to \naddress the most efficient and streamlined procedure for exchange of evidence critical to \naddressing threshold issues while balancing important questions of privacy and national security \nclearly raised in this matter. \n  A separate Order follows.   \n \n \n \n  7/20/2020              /S/         \nDate                Paula Xinis \n                United States District Judge \n \n24 Plaintiffs also summarily argue that this “lack of delegation separately constitutes a violation of the \nAdministrative Procedures Act, in that the TSDB—as well as many of its components, including the CBP’s usage \nand participation—are wholly without any statutory authorization.”  ECF No. 52 at 79.  In attempting to shoehorn \ntheir theory—which is, again, not even about the nondelegation doctrine—now into Count III (Violation of the \nAPA–DHS TRIP), they add confusion in place of any clarity.  Nowhere in Count III do Plaintiffs plausibly aver \nsuch a claim, and the Court cannot discern any facts which support the bare legal assertion.  ECF No. 48 ¶¶ 1591–\n99.    \n \n25 After comprehensively reviewing the Amended Complaint and the parties’ arguments, the Court finds \nthat Plaintiffs Mia Khaled El Ali, Baby Doe, Child Doe, and Child Doe 2 have failed to sufficiently allege any \nplausible claims against any Defendants.  They are dismissed from this case.  \n \n65 \n ",

The federal government has imposed a kind of second-class citizenship on the \nPlaintiffs.  Without charges, without arrests, without even an investigation sometimes—the \nagency Defendants act in concert to deprive thousands of innocent Americans, mostly \nMuslim, of their right to be free from a government that extrajudicially designates them as \nworthy of permanent suspicion. \n2.  That permanent suspicion, embodied in the federal government’s watchlisting \nenterprise, has sweeping consequences for the Plaintiffs as well as the more than one million \nothers  who  bear  it.    They  are  separated  from  their  children,  denied  employment \nopportunities, prevented from traveling by air to attend weddings and funerals, and denied \nor delayed immigration benefits.  The rights of Plaintiffs to purchase firearms, to wire money \nand keep a bank account, to receive their passports and be granted visas are all constrained.  \nFor several Plaintiffs, the Defendants’ actions have diminished his standing and ability to \nprovide religious leadership to his community.  For others, Defendants have leveraged their \npresence on the No Fly List to coerce them into becoming informants against the Muslim \ncommunity.  \n3.  Through an interagency watchlisting system, led by Defendants’ Watchlisting \nAdvisory Council, the Defendants have identified the Plaintiffs as worthy of permanent \nsuspicion, imposing burdens and disabilities on them in all aspects of their lives.   \n4.  In deciding to target the Plaintiffs, the watchlisting system behaves lawlessly, \nacting  absent  Congressional  approval  and  oversight,  and  even  in  direct  opposition  to \nCongressional directives.    \n6 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 7 of 268\n5.  To identify its targets, some parts of the watchlisting system, such as the \nTerrorism Screening Database (“TSDB”), utilize a nonsense-on-stilts inclusion standard that \nis always satisfied.  Other parts, such as the TSA’s Quiet Skies initiative—a program that also \nbehaves lawlessly and without Congressional approval and oversight—and other “rules-\nbased” lists, do not use any standard and instead rely upon the inarticulate hunches of \nfederal officials, rank profiling, and vulgar guilt-by-association practices. \n6.  Through their watchlisting system, the federal government makes it known—\nto every law enforcement agency in the country, every part of the federal government, more \nthan 60 foreign countries, an unknown number of private companies, international bodies, \nand other third parties—that the Plaintiffs should be treated as dangerous threats.  The \nPlaintiffs’ friends, family, and others with whom the Plaintiffs associate are punished for \ntheir relationship with a watchlisting system’s target.   \n7.  Plaintiffs and almost all others targeted by the watchlisting system have never \nbeen arrested, charged, or convicted of any type of terrorism-related offense.  Nonetheless, \nthe federal government has designated them as “known or suspected terrorists,” wreaking \nhavoc on Plaintiffs’ personal, religious and professional lives.   \n8.  The Defendants know that their watchlisting system has never prevented an \nact of terrorism inside the United States and is completely ineffective, but they continue to \nexpand it anyways.  In the last 10 years alone, Defendant CBP reports that its encounters \nwith individuals suspected of having terrorism-related or national security concerns has \nskyrocketed from 365 per year (in 2008) to more than 550,000 per year (in 2017). \n9.  The federal government’s watchlisting system uses secret and automated \n“rules” to monitor Americans’ travel patterns and their associations.  Americans who travel \n7 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 8 of 268\nto the Middle East, speak or study Arabic, donate to Muslim charities, are family members of \nalready-watchlisted  individuals,  travel  with  already-watchlisted  individuals,  or \ncommunicate with already-watchlisted individuals are routinely flagged for heightened \nscrutiny.  The government designates these individuals as “unknown or partially known \nterrorists,” monitors and investigates them, and then uses any information learned to \nnominate them as “known or suspected terrorists.”   The Boston Globe unearthed one such \n“risk-based passenger targeting rules” program on July 28, 2018; it is called “Quiet Skies.” \n10.  The  federal  government  uses  guilt-by-association  presumptions  to  place \nfamily members, friends, traveling companions, and associates of listed persons under \nintense surveillance and on the watchlist.  Many Americans, including children, end up \ntargeted by the watchlisting system based on who their mother or father is, what mosque \ntheir family attends, how they exercise their constitutional rights, where they travel, with \nwhom they associate, or their perceived religious beliefs. \n11.  Speaking  Arabic,  traveling  to  Muslim-majority  countries,  and  even \nundertaking religious pilgrimages—activities that American Muslims are likely to engage \nin—qualify as bases and factors for rules-based monitoring, Quiet Skies listing, watchlist \nnominations, and watchlist placements. \n12.  The federal government adds many Americans to the watchlist or subjects \nthem to terrorist-level scrutiny due to typos, coincidentally similar names and outright \nmistakes.  This happens because the government employs few checks or quality assurance \nstandards before permitting names to be added.   \n13.  Leaked government documents as well as public governmental reports, reveal \nthat the federal government’s terrorist watchlisting system is discriminatory, standardless, \n8 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 9 of 268\nand devoid of adequate procedures.  These documents include the March 2013 Watchlisting \nGuidance  (Exhibit  1),  the  Directorate  of  Terrorist  Identities  (DTI):  Strategic \nAccomplishments 2013 (Exhibit 2), the Department of Justice's March 2014 Audit of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation's Management of Terrorist Watchlist (Exhibit 3), and a 2018 \ninformational bulletin on the “Quiet Skies” program (Exhibit 4).   \n14.  The federal government’s additions to the TSDB have dramatically increased \nover the last decade.  The number of individuals Defendants added to the TSDB in 2016 is \nmore than triple the number added in 2009.  Approximately 99% of all proposed additions \nare accepted each year.  There are now more than one million people in the TSDB.   \n15.  Although the Department of Homeland Security operates the DHS Traveler \nRedress Inquiry Program (“DHS TRIP”), ostensibly to assist Americans in resolving travel \ncomplaints  including  those  related  to  their  watchlist  status,  the  DHS  TRIP  is  largely \nineffective.  DHS TRIP refuses to discuss specific facts and refuses to even process many \nredress complaints related to watchlisted individuals or those subjected to rules-based \n“terrorist” monitoring.   Moreover, the DHS TRIP redress process often only affects air travel, \nnot land border crossings or other watchlist consequences. Meanwhile, innocent Americans \nsuffer paralyzing consequences. \n16.  Each  of  the  Plaintiffs’  injuries  are  directly  attributable  to  Defendants’ \ncompilation, implementation and dissemination of the federal terrorist watchlisting system, \nincluding rules-based monitoring, Quiet Skies, and the TSDB.   \nPlaintiffs \n17.

In September 2003, Attorney General John Ashcroft established the Terrorist \nScreening Center (“TSC”) to consolidate the government’s approach to terrorism screening.  \nThe TSC, which is administered by the FBI, develops and maintains the federal government’s \nconsolidated Terrorism Screening Database (“TSDB” or “federal terrorist watchlist”).  TSC’s \nconsolidated  watchlist  is  the  federal  government’s  master  repository  for  suspected \ninternational and domestic terrorist records and is used for watchlist related screening.   \n94.  The Government publicly states that to be included in the TSDB, an individual \nmust be reasonably suspected of being a known or suspected terrorist.  More specifically,  a \ngovernment nominator “must rely upon articulable intelligence or information which, based \non the totality of the circumstances and, taken together with rational inferences from those \n33 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 34 of 268\nfacts, creates a reasonable suspicion that the individual is engaged, has been engaged, or \nintends to engage, in conduct constituting in preparation for, in aid or in furtherance of, or \nrelated to, terrorism and/or terrorist activities.”  See January 2018 Overview of the U.S. \nGovernment’s Watchlisting Process and Procedures (Exhibit 5).   \n95.  The “totality of the circumstances” analysis for TSDB inclusion may include \nassessment of an individual’s race, ethnicity, country of origin, religion, religious practices, \nlanguages  spoken,  family,  associations,  travel  history,  social  media  history,  and  other \nactivities protected by the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, and \nU.S. Constitution.2   \n96.  Anyone listed in the TSDB is a “TSDB Listee” subjected to varying forms of \nheightened scrutiny and adverse repercussions.  In addition, TSDB Listees may have their \nrecords annotated or categorized with additional sub-classifications subjecting them to \ndifferential treatment. \n97.  One set of TSDB sub-classifications is utilized primarily by the TSA, DHS, and \nTSC as relates to air travel.  It includes the No Fly List, the Selectee List, and the Expanded \nSelectee List.   \n98.  Since April 2011, persons nominated and added to the TSDB are placed on the \nExpanded Selectee List by default, provided their records contain a minimum amount of \nname and birth date identifying information. \n                                                        \n2   The TSA conducts a similar assessment of the family relationships, associations and \ntravel  patterns  of  individuals  in  order  to  flag  them  as  “unknown  or  partially  known \nterrorists” and place them on the “Quiet Skies (or Silent Partner) Selectee List” which \noperates in parallel to the TSDB.  Quiet Skies and Silent Partner may, however, cross-\nreference TSDB information and serve as a stepping stone in the process of identifying and \ninvestigating individuals which leads to TSDB nomination. \n34 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 35 of 268\n99.  TSDB Listees may also be categorized under the heightened Selectee List if \ntheir  records  contain  additional  “derogatory  information.”    According  to  the  2013 \nWatchlisting Guidance promulgated by the Watchlisting Advisory Council, TSDB Listees may \nbe designated as Selectees if the government suspects them of association or affiliation with \na foreign or domestic terrorist organization, or other association with terrorist activities.   \n100.  TSDB Listees sub-classified on either the Expanded Selectee List or Selectee \nList are systematically subjected to extra screening at airports, and often find “SSSS” printed \non  their  boarding  passes.    “SSSS”  indicates  a  passenger’s  watchlist  status  to  airline \nemployees, airport employees, and screeners.   \n101.  TSDB Listees may also be categorized under the heightened No Fly List if their \nrecords contain additional “derogatory information.”  According to information released by \nthe Government (following 2015 No Fly List litigation), TSDB Listees may be placed on the \nNo Fly List if the government believes they pose a threat of committing an act of terrorism \nin the United States, against an international U.S. government facility, with respect to an \naircraft, or if they are otherwise operationally capable of carrying out a violent act of \nterrorism.  See January 2018 Overview of the U.S. Government’s Watchlisting Process and \nProcedures at 4 (Ex. 5.)   \n102.  Persons on the No Fly List, including some of the Watchlisted Plaintiffs, are \nprevented from boarding flights that fly into, out of, or even through United States airspace.     \n103.  TSDB Listees who are not on the No Fly List may also be blocked from crossing \nU.S. land borders or from boarding international flights headed to the United States.  \n104.  Other screening agencies, including CBP, screen TSDB Listees but do not \nregularly use the No Fly List, Selectee List, and Expanded Selectee classifications.  Instead, \n35 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 36 of 268\nthe CBP designates TSDB Listees as “Armed and Dangerous,” refers them to secondary \ninspection, or otherwise automatically flags them as potential terrorists in automatic alerts \nsent to officers.  \n105.  Pursuant to official CBP policy adopted in January 2018 (CBP Directive No. \n3340-049A)  (Exhibit  6),  the  CBP  conducts  secondary  inspection  including  advanced \nelectronics searches of any electronics carried by TSDB Listees.   “An advanced search is any \nsearch  in  which  an  officer  connects  external  equipment  through  a  wired  or  wireless \nconnection to an electronic device not merely to gain access to the device, but to review, \ncopy, and analyze its contents.”  “The presence of an individual on a government operated \nand government vetted terrorist watch list,” alone constitutes grounds for the CBP to search, \ncopy, and store the contents of laptops, tablets, and smartphones, etc. without requesting or \nobtaining consent.  \n106.  Another set of TSDB sub-classifications is utilized by DHS, NCIC, and other \nfederal, state, and local law enforcement officers to determine operational responses to \nTSDB Listees.  The TSC distributes the “Known or Suspected Terrorist” or “KST” file to the \nNCIC for further dissemination to more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies and 100,000 \nlaw enforcement officers.  This KST file is then marked with “Handling Codes,” which are set \nby the TSC and, upon information and belief, overseen by the Watchlisting Advisory Council \nand its participating agencies.  Four TSC handling codes have been published by Baltimore \nPolice  Department  Policy  802,  Handling  Codes:  Terrorist  Response  (Sept.  8,  2016) \n(Exhibit 7), as well as other federal, state, and local law enforcement guidebooks:   \n“Handling Code 1: The subject is confirmed to associate with terrorism, and \nthere is a valid, outstanding arrest warrant. \n \n36 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 37 of 268\nHandling Code 2: The subject is of an “investigative interest” regarding their \nassociation with terrorism. \n \nHandling Code 3: This individual may have possible ties with terrorism. \n \nHandling Code 4: The identity provided by this individual may have possible \nties with terrorism.” \n \n107.  In 2005, according to an analysis done by the DOJ’s Office of the Inspector \nGeneral, less than 1% of all TSDB Listees were designated under either Handling Code 1 or \n2.  In other words, less than 1% of all TSDB Listees either had an outstanding arrest warrant \nor were under active investigation for terrorism.  The overwhelming majority of records, \nmore than 96%, were designated under Handling Codes 3 or 4, as maybe having possible ties \nto terrorism.  A follow-up audit in 2007 confirmed the same general percentages: 1.5% of \nTSDB Listees were classified under Handling Code 1 or 2, with the remainder classified under \na consolidated Handling Code 3 or 4, or “other.”  Upon information and belief, these ratios \ncontinue to approximate the Handling Code subdivisions of TSDB Listees in 2018. \n108.  In addition to the various “terrorist” sub-classifications of TSDB Listees, the \nTSDB also lists foreign individuals under an exception to the TSDB’s ordinary ‘reasonable \nsuspicion of being a known or suspected terrorist’ standard.  Pursuant to this exception, the \nTSDB  includes  identifying  information  of  foreign  individuals  who  may  have  espoused \nsupport for terrorist activities, or who are related to TSDB Listees.  The Department of \nHomeland Security and the Department of State use this TSDB exception to screen foreign \nindividuals for admissibility, visas and immigration.  TSDB “Exceptions” are separately \ncategorized by the TSC and disseminated to DHS and the State Department. \n109.  Even though they are not TSDB Listees, airplane passengers occasionally \nreceive boarding passes stamped with “SSSS”.  These designations are commonly the product \n37 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 38 of 268\nof the TSA’s and CBP’s secretive and automated “risk-based targeting rules.”  These targeting \nrules examine passengers’ itineraries, travel histories, travelling companions, associations \nwith TSDB Listees, and numerous other undisclosed factors to flag passengers as “unknown \nor partially known terrorists.”    Upon information and belief, the secretive and undisclosed \nfactors include “totality of the circumstances” analysis related to passengers’ race, ethnic \norigin, national origin, sex, and religion. \n110.  The designation of known or suspected terrorists with the marking “SSSS “has \nbecome commonplace in the Muslim community.  Coupled with witnessing the treatment \nthey receive when traveling, many of the Watchlisted Plaintiffs' family members, friends, and \nassociates recognize and understand “SSSS” to mean that the government has designated \nthem as terrorists. \n111.  Likewise, airline representatives and other airline personnel recognize the \n“SSSS” designation and marking as meaning that the individual so designated is a known or \nsuspected terrorist. \n112.  The TSA’s Quiet Skies program assembles the results of these “risk-based \ntargeting rules” onto a separate TSA watchlist known as the “Quiet Skies Selectee List,” and \nthen subjects the passengers to intense investigation and scrutiny.  Within the Quiet Skies \nprogram, Federal Air Marshalls and plainclothes TSA officers collect detailed behavioral and \nsurveillance information on Quiet Skies Selectees, including passengers’ bathroom usage, \nwardrobe changes, meals, conversations, whether they sleep on their flights, and reactions \nwhen they realize they are being stalked.  Based on their observations and investigations, \nthe TSA may nominate Quiet Skies Selectees to the TSDB. \n38 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 39 of 268\n113.  The TSA’s Silent Partner program is similar in form and function to Quiet Skies.  \nThe only significant difference is that Silent Partner applies to flights originating from \noutside the United States, while Quiet Skies applies only to flights originating in the United \nStates (regardless of whether it is a domestic or international flight). \n114.  The TSA’s Quiet Skies and Silent Partner programs and/or the TSA’s other \nrules-based programs target family members and traveling companions of TSDB Listees, \nincluding Plaintiffs, because of their relationships.  These family members and traveling \ncompanions are themselves then treated as known or suspected terrorists.  \n115.  TSA shares its Quiet Skies and Silent Partner list information with foreign \ncarriers and governments to assist those carriers and governments identify targets for \nenhanced screening and interrogation. \n116.  TSA has stated it has since “curtailed” the Quiet Skies program, but TSA has \nnot claimed to end it and has not provided full details as to how much the program has been \ncurtailed.   It is also unclear whether or to what degree Silent Partner has been curtailed. \n117.  CBP employs comparable risk-based targeting rules to the TSA to single out \nindividuals  at  ports  of  entry  for  secondary  inspection,  detention,  investigation  and \ndeportation.    Upon  information  and  belief,  CBP  also  maintains  separate  “unknown  or \npartially known terrorist” watchlists in parallel to the TSDB to label and treat individuals \npresenting themselves at land borders as terrorists.  Upon information and belief, CBP \nutilizes the results of high-risk targeting rules and resulting inspections and investigation as \na factual predicate for nominating individuals to the TSDB. \n118.  Watchlist  policies,  including  all  the  watchlist  policies  described  in  this \nComplaint,  and  all  guidance  and  rules  as  to  how  all  individual  watchlist-based \n39 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 40 of 268\ndeterminations are made, are managed and controlled by Defendant WLAC, whose actions \nare in turn decided by the Defendants who, as described above, advise the WLAC. \n119.  Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs are all TSDB Listees or family members \nof TSDB Listees.  Upon information and belief and in addition, Plaintiffs and similarly-\nsituated Americans have also been designated by the TSA and/or CBP as potential terrorists \nbecause  of  the  TSA  and/or  CBP’s  automated  high-risk  targeting  rules  and  creation  of \nseparate “unknown or partially known terrorist” watchlists. \nNominations to the Federal Terrorist Watchlist \n120.  Although TSA, CBP, and other agencies may use the records provided by the \nTSC, it is the TSC that maintains and controls the TSDB database of suspected terrorists. \n121.  Two  government  entities  are  primarily  responsible  for  “nominating” \nindividuals for inclusion in the terrorist watchlist—NCTC and FBI.  The NCTC, which is \nmanaged by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, relies on information from \nother  federal  departments  and  agencies  when  including  alleged  known  or  suspected \ninternational terrorists in its Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (“TIDE”) database.  \nThe NCTC reviews TIDE entries and recommends specific entries to the TSC for inclusion in \nthe watchlist.  TIDE is the main source of all international terrorist information included in \nthe  watchlist.    The  FBI,  in  turn,  nominates  to  the  watchlist  individuals  with  what  it \ncharacterizes as suspected ties to domestic terrorism.   \n122.  Other government agencies, including DHS, TSA and CBP, are also able to \nnominate individuals for inclusion in the terrorist watchlist. \n123.  For  instance,  FinCEN  uses  the  TSDB  to  monitor  watchlisted  individuals’ \nfinancial  transactions,  and  then  nominates  associated  parties  with  those  financial \n40 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 41 of 268\ntransactions to the watchlist.  See Press Release, FinCEN Awards Recognize Partnership \nBetween Law Enforcement Financial Institutions to Flight Financial Crime (May 10, 2016) \n(Exhibit 8).3 \n124.  All nominations to the TSDB must be approved and implemented by the TSC.  \nThe TSC makes the final decision on whether a nominated individual meets the minimum \nrequirements for inclusion into the watchlist as a known or suspected terrorist.  TSC also \ndecides which screening systems will receive information about that individual. \n125.  Former Director of the Terrorism Screening Center Timothy Healy testified \nthat in evaluating whether an individual meets the criteria for inclusion on the consolidated \nwatchlist, the TSC determines whether the nominated individual is “reasonably suspected” \nof having possible links to terrorism.  According to the TSC, “reasonable suspicion requires \narticulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences, reasonably warrant the \ndetermination that an individual is known or suspected to be or has been engaged in conduct \nconstituting, in preparation for, in and of or related to terrorism and terrorist activities.”   \n126.  Defendants have provided only limited information about and otherwise not \nstated publicly what standards or criteria are applied to determine whether an American \ncitizen will be placed on the TSDB, No Fly List, Selectee List, Expanded Selectee List, Quiet \nSkies/Silent Partner Selectee List(s), or any other terrorist watchlist that is distributed to the \nTSA, CBP or other screening agencies.   \n127.  The  standards  for  watchlist  inclusion  do  not  evince  even  internal  logic.  \nDefendants define a “suspected terrorist” as an “individual who is reasonably suspected to \n                                                        \n3 Available at https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-awards-recognize-\npartnership-between-law-enforcement-and-financial.   \n41 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 42 of 268\nbe, or have been, engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to \nterrorism and terrorist activities based on articulable and reasonable suspicion.”  In other \nwords, Defendants place American citizens and other individuals on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist based upon a “reasonable suspicion” that they are “reasonably suspected” of \nnefarious activities.  These standards fall far below the typical “reasonable suspicion” and \n“probable cause” standards required for criminal investigation. \n128.  The federal government utilizes guilt-by-association as a basis for watchlist \ninclusion.  For example, immediate relatives of listed persons can become TSDB Listees \nwithout any derogatory information—other than the bonds of family.  Likewise, they can be \nsubjected to TSA and CBP rules-based ‘terrorist’ monitoring on the basis of family alone.  \nSuch designation signals to screening agencies, officers, employers, and others that the \nimmediate relative is a violent threat engaged in nefarious activities.   \n129.  Being a known associate—a friend, colleague, fellow community member, \netc.—of a listed individual can also provide a basis for watchlist inclusion.   \n130.  Even if an American citizen is acquitted of terrorism charges or those charges \nare otherwise dismissed, the federal government retains for itself the authority to continue \nto include them in the watchlist.   \n131.  For reasons unknown, Defendants also place what they call “non-investigatory \nsubjects” on the federal terrorist watchlist, i.e., American citizens and other individuals they \nhave chosen not to investigate. \n132.  Defendants place individuals on the federal terrorist watchlist without any \ninformation regarding an individual’s intended target.   \n42 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 43 of 268\n133.  Defendants place individuals on the Selectee List without any information that \nthey pose a threat to aviation. \n134.  Defendants place individuals on the No Fly List without any information that \nthey pose a threat to aviation. \n135.  Under  these  practices  and  standards,  the  number  of  records  in  the \nconsolidated watchlist has swelled.  Over 1.1 million new names have been added to the \nwatchlist since 2009.  More than 98% of the names nominated to the TSDB are accepted.  In \n2013, TSC accepted 98.96 percent of all nominations made.  A 2007 GAO report found that \nTSC rejects only approximately one percent of all nominations to the watchlist.4   \n136.  Because  of  these  loose  standards  and  practices,  the  federal  terrorist \nwatchlist’s rate of growth has dramatically increased.  In fiscal 2009, there were 58,999 new \nadditions to the watchlist.  In fiscal 2016, there were 176,014 new additions.   \n137.  Upon information and belief, in 2001, there were 16 people who the federal \ngovernment  systematically  prevented  from  flying.    By  2009,  the  number  grew  to \napproximately 3,400.  By 2016, that number increased to approximately 81,000. \n138.  Once an American citizen has been placed on the watchlist, the individual \nremains on the list until the agency that supplied the initial information in support of the \nnomination determines the individual should be removed. \n139.  At a March 10, 2010 Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing, Russel E. \nTravers, Deputy Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, stated that “[t]he entire \n                                                        \n4 See United States Government Accountability Office Report to Congressional Requesters \nentitled Terrorist Watchlist Screening:  Opportunities Exist to Enhance Management Oversight, \nReduce Vulnerabilities in Agency Screening Processes, and Expand Use of the List, GAO-08-110, \nOctober 2007, at 22. \n43 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 44 of 268\nfederal government is leaning very far forward on putting people on list,” and that the \nwatchlist is “getting bigger, and it will get even bigger.” \n140.  The  federal  terrorist  watchlist’s  and  rules-based  terror  lists’  inclusion \nstandards are so permissive, pliable, and laden with discriminatory assessments of race, \nethnicity, national origin, and religion, that they bear at best a fleetingly marginal connection \nto actual terrorist activities.  The inclusion standards themselves violate the Plaintiffs’ \nprocedural and substantive due process rights. \nDissemination and Consequences of the Terrorist Watchlist \n141.  Subsets of TSDB watchlist information are disseminated from the TSC across \nthe federal government, to state and local governments, and to more than 60 foreign \ncountries, including all Visa Waiver Program countries. \n142.  TSC disseminates records from its terrorist watchlist to other government \nagencies that in turn use those records to identify suspected terrorists.  For example, \napplicable TSC records are provided to TSA for use by airlines in pre-screening passengers \nand to CBP for use in screening travelers entering the United States at land borders, seaports, \nairports, and other ports of entry.   \n143.  Upon information and belief, Defendants disseminated the records of the \nWatchlisted Plaintiffs from the TSDB to other government agencies, including TSA for use by \nairlines  in  pre-screening  the  Watchlisted  Plaintiffs,  and  CBP  for  use  in  screening  the \nWatchlisted Plaintiffs upon entering the United States. \n144.  Upon information and belief, Defendants disseminated the records pertaining \nto the Watchlisted Plaintiffs from their terrorist watchlist to foreign governments with the \n44 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 45 of 268\npurpose and hope that those foreign governments will constrain the movement of the \nWatchlisted Plaintiffs in some manner.   \n145.  Upon information and belief, Defendants’ intention in disseminating watchlist \nrecords,  including  those  of  the  Watchlisted  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American \ncitizens, as widely as possible is to constrain and monitor their movements and activities, \nboth in the United States and abroad.  For example, some countries detain individuals listed \non the federal terrorist watchlist who enter their borders, question those individuals at the \nbehest of United States officials, or altogether prevent those individuals from entering those \ncountries.   \n146.  Thus,  while  the  TSC  maintains  and  controls  the  database  of  suspected \nterrorists, it is the front-line agencies like the TSA, CBP, and law enforcement that carry out \nthe screening function.  These agencies and law enforcement entities cross-reference the \nnames and identities of individuals they encounter against the TSDB to determine whether \nthey are on the TSDB or are a potential match to the TSDB. \n147.  Agencies  throughout  the  federal  government  utilize  the  federal  terrorist \nwatchlist to conduct and promote screening, subjecting listed persons to a comprehensive \nportfolio of consequences that cover large aspects of their lives.   \n148.  Government agencies routinely cross-reference the TSDB in connection with \napplications for or audits of a wide range of government benefits.  The TSDB is referenced in \nconnection with and used as a basis to deny federal government employment, security \nclearances (regardless of whether the individual needs that clearance for either government \nor private contractor employment), travel benefit programs like TSA PreCheck and Global \nEntry, and a wide variety of government licenses and credentials used in both public and \n45 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 46 of 268\nprivate  employment,  including  FAA  licenses,  Hazmat  licenses,  Transportation  Worker \nIdentity Credentials, and security credentials needed for critical infrastructure projects like \npower plants. \n149.  Indeed,  Defendants  disseminated  the  federal  terrorist  watchlist  to \ngovernment authorities, private corporations and individuals with the purpose and hope \nthat  these  entities  and/or  individuals  will  impose  consequences  on  those  individuals \nDefendants have listed, including the Watchlisted Plaintiffs. \n150.  Upon information and belief, the status of the  Watchlisted Plaintiffs and \nsimilarly situated individuals as known or suspected terrorists on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist diminishes and even imperils their ability to access and utilize the financial system.   \n151.  Defendants  have  provided  information  regarding  TSDB  Listees  to  banks, \nprompting banks to close the bank accounts of individuals listed on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist.  Financial institutions have also declined to allow some watchlisted individuals to \nmake wire transfers. \n152.  Moreover,  upon  information  and  belief,  family-based  immigration \napplications  filed  by  individuals  listed  on  the  federal  terrorist  watchlist  are  delayed \nindefinitely due to an “FBI name check” and not adjudicated, thereby denying and hindering \nthe Watchlisted Plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals of the rights that flow from \ncitizenship, including the ability to sponsor lawful permanent residency for immediate \nrelatives living abroad. \n153.  Among  the  entities  and  individuals  to  which  the  federal  government \ndisseminates  its  federal  terrorist  watchlist  are  state  and  local  authorities,  foreign \n46 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 47 of 268\ngovernments, corporations, private contractors, airlines, gun sellers, financial institutions, \nand captains of sea-faring vessels, among others. \n154.  Upon information and belief, because the names of the Watchlisted Plaintiffs \nand similarly situated individuals are included on the federal terrorist watchlist, their names \nwere disseminated to state and local authorities, foreign governments, corporations, private \ncontractors, airlines, gun sellers, financial institutions, the captains of sea-faring vessels, \namong other official and private entities and individuals. \n155.  In fact, in 2015, former Director of the Terrorist Screening Center Christopher \nPiehota gave an exclusive interview to CNN and stated the following, in relevant part: \nIt's concerning that our partners don't use all of our data. We \nprovide them with tools. We provide them with support, and I \nwould find it concerning that they don't use these tools to help \nscreen for their own aviation security, maritime security, border \nscreening, visas, things like that for travel.5 \n156.  Former TSC Director Piehota went on to state that the United States shares its \nfederal terrorist watchlist with the European Union, but that European Union countries don't \nsystematically utilize it to identify suspected terrorists or screen migrants coming. \n157.  Because the federal government disseminates its federal terrorist watchlist to \nforeign  governments,  listed  persons,  including  the  Watchlisted  Plaintiffs  and  similarly \nsituated American citizens, are often not allowed to enter other nations.  This is because the \nUnited States is telling other nations, without any modicum of due process, that thousands \nof its own citizens and residents are “known or suspected terrorists.”   \n                                                        \n5 First on CNN: Top U.S. intel official: Europe not taking advantage of terror tracking tools, \nCNN,  available  at:  http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/07/politics/christopher-piehota-us-\nintel-europe-terror-tracking/ \n47 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 48 of 268\n158.  The  federal  government,  through  Defendants,  disseminates  its  federal \nterrorist watchlist to state and local police officers which allows those officers to query the \nnames of persons, including the Watchlisted Plaintiffs, against the TSDB as disseminated \nthrough the NCIC.  Watchlisted Plaintiffs and similarly situated watchlisted individuals are \noften identified and treated as terrorists during routine police encounters including traffic \nstops.  \n159.  Disseminating the federal terrorist watchlist to state and local police officers \ncreates a dangerous situation insofar as the federal terrorist watchlist effectively directs \nstate and local officers to treat thousands of Americans, including the Watchlisted Plaintiffs, \ncharged with or convicted of no crime yet who are listed as a “known or suspected terrorist” \nas extremely dangerous.   \n160.  The watchlist is also disseminated to approximately 553 private entities, \nincluding airlines, universities, hospitals, private correctional facilities, private security \nservices, and private city attorneys.  This does not include additional private entities that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security shares watchlist data to, including aircraft and airport \ncompanies for employment and other non-traveling purposes.  \n161.  With the advent and deployment of automatic license plate readers by police \ndepartments across the country, federal, local and state authorities have relied heavily upon \na driver’s (or a car associated with a driver’s) watchlist status as the basis of a border or \ntraffic stop.  Watchlisted Plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals have been subjected to \nthis treatment. \n162.  Being on the federal terrorist watchlist can prevent listed persons, including \nthe Watchlisted Plaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens and lawful permanent \n48 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 49 of 268\nresidents, from purchasing a gun.  For example, New Jersey passed a law in 2013 that banned \npersons on the federal terrorist watchlist from owning guns.  Additionally, Connecticut is in \nthe process of setting up an institutional mechanism to prevent individuals whose names are \nincluded on the federal terrorist watchlist, such as the Watchlisted Plaintiffs, from being able \nto buy a gun in the state of Connecticut.  Accordingly, the Watchlisted Plaintiffs and similarly \nsituated individuals are unable to purchase guns in states that ban persons on the federal \nterrorist watchlist from owning guns. \n163.  There are perennial federal proposals to ban all TSDB Listees from purchasing \nguns, although none has yet been formally adopted.  Nonetheless, upon information and \nbelief, Defendants disseminate the TSDB (through the NCIC or otherwise) throughout the \ngun market.  The gun permit and gun sale process involves name cross-checks against the \nTSDB.   Gun permits and sales have been denied based on Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated \nAmerican citizens’ status as TSDB Listees.  The GAO reported on March 7, 2016 that TSDB \nListees are, as a matter of course, subjected to gun-purchase delays, and 212 TSDB Listees \nhave been barred from purchasing guns altogether.    \n164.  Because the federal government conducts a security risk assessment that \nincludes querying the federal terrorist watchlist prior to issuing a license to commercial \ndrivers to transport hazardous materials, being on the federal terrorist watchlist can prevent \nlisted persons, including the Watchlisted Plaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens, \nfrom obtaining or renewing their Hazmat license.   \n165.  The federal government conducts a security risk assessment for private and \npublic transportation workers, including those who enter airports and maritime ports.  \nApproved individuals are issued Transportation Worker Identity Credentials (“TWIC”).  The \n49 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 50 of 268\nTWIC credential process includes querying the federal terrorist watchlist.  On May 9, 2012, \nAssistant Administrator David Nicholson testified to Congress that the TSA vets more than \n13 million transportation workers against the terrorist watchlist each week.  Defendants \nhave prevented TSDB Listees from obtaining or renewing their TWICs, thus depriving them \nof a requirement for their employment.   \n166.  Being  on  the  federal  terrorist  watchlist  can  also  result  in  the  denial  or \nrevocation of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) license of individuals listed on the \nfederal  terrorist  watchlist,  including  the  Watchlisted  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated \nAmerican citizens. \n167.  Being  on  the  federal  terrorist  watchlist  can  also  prevent  listed  persons, \nincluding  the  Watchlisted  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  from \naccompanying minors or passengers with disabilities to their gate, from working at an \nairport, or working for an airline insofar as listed persons are not allowed to enter so-called \n“sterile areas” of airports. \n168.  Being on the federal terrorist watchlist can also result in the listing of the false \nstigmatizing  label  of  “known  or  suspected”  terrorist  on  the  criminal  records  of  the \nWatchlisted Plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals.  Criminal record information is \naccessible to the general public. \n169.  Defendants make the federal terrorist watchlist available to municipal courts, \nwhich may make bail determinations based on an individual’s status on the watchlist. \n170.  The federal terrorist watchlist diminishes, rather than enhances, our national \nsecurity because the number of innocent Americans on the list is becoming so voluminous \nthat the purpose of having a list is significantly undermined. \n50 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 51 of 268\n171.  The consequences of being on the federal terrorist watchlist are meted out \npublicly.  Members of the public can witness the extra and intrusive screening to which \nindividuals on the federal terrorist watchlist are subject.  This screening oftentimes occurs \nin front of family and colleagues, including TSDB Listees being pulled out of their cars at \ngunpoint, being ordered to leave their vehicles with their hands held above their head, being \nhandcuffed, being singled out and escorted first off a plane by law enforcement officers, being \nsubjected to lengthy detentions, and having their electronics confiscated and searched,  \namong other stigmatizing measures. \n172.  Because  travel  is  regularly  done  with  family,  friends,  community \nacquaintances, and professional contacts, a person’s watchlist status is revealed to travel \ncompanions.  Travel companions come to learn of a person’s watchlist status based on how \nscreeners treat TSDB Listees.  Moreover, TSA and CBP screening and rules-based practices \noften flag travel companions as themselves being potential terrorists, causing them to be \ntreated the same as TSDB Listees. \n173.  In practice, frontline screeners disclose the status of individuals on the federal \nterrorist  watchlist  to  federal,  state,  local,  and  foreign  authorities,  as  well  as  private \nemployees of airports, airlines, and other transportation employees.  The operation of the \nfederal terrorist watchlist enlists air carriers to assist the federal government in tracking \npassengers on the federal terrorist watchlist. \n174.  Defendants who contributed to the placement of the Watchlisted Plaintiffs and \nsimilarly situated individuals on the federal terrorist watchlist knew that their actions \nviolated clearly established federal and constitutional law. \n51 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 52 of 268\n175.  Defendants  knew  at  the  time  they  acted  unlawfully  that  Supreme  Court \nprecedent required that, whenever a citizen is deprived of a liberty interest, the federal \ngovernment must at least provide the deprived with some form of notice that a deprivation \noccurred, and an opportunity to contest or correct it. \n176.  Separately, TSA disseminates the Quiet Skies and/or Silent Partner watchlist \nto foreign governments and foreign airline carriers. \nThe Federal Government’s Terrorist Watchlist \nIs no More Effective than a List of Randomly Selected Individuals \n \n177.  Defendants’  ability  to  watchlist  persons  who  actually  pose  a  threat  of \nterrorism can be measured and described using a quantitative analysis based on factual \nallegations made in this Complaint as well as publicly available information describing the \ncurrent operation of the federal terrorist watchlist.   \n178.  The federal government has added approximately 1.1 million persons to the \nfederal terrorist watchlist over the last ten years.  These additions include thousands of U.S. \ncitizens and lawful permanent residents. \n179.  Moreover, based on the University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database, \na project funded in part by the Department of Homeland Security, there have been less than \n250 terrorist acts inside the United States over the last decade.  These terrorist acts were \nperpetrated by less than 250 persons.  \n180.  Only  one  of  these  perpetrators  was  designated  on  the  federal  terrorist \nwatchlist by the federal government prior to their criminal conduct.  This single person \ndesignated on the federal terrorist watchlist,  however, was removed from the federal \nterrorist watchlist prior to perpetrating the terrorist attack. \n52 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 53 of 268\n181.  Upon information and belief, in order to designate a person on the federal \nterrorist watchlist, the federal government must first have information about that person.  \nBecause the federal government does not possess information on every person in the world, \nexisting law enforcement and intelligence practices produce a subset of persons who the \nfederal  government  can  then  screen  against  the  federal  terrorist  watchlist’s  inclusion \nstandards.   \n182.  The  precise  size  of  this  subset  is  unknown;  however,  a  survey  of  law \nenforcement and intelligence practices indicates that the size of this subset is greater than \n50 million people.   \n183.  Upon information and belief, the practices that produce this subset exclude \nsome persons who do pose a threat of terrorism and include some persons who do not pose \na threat of terrorism.   \n184.  Upon further information and belief, the federal government does not screen \nthe entire subset of people known to it.   Moreover, Defendants do not make individual \ndeterminations as to whether each person about whom they have information should be \nplaced on the federal terrorist watchlist.  Defendants utilized automated algorithms and risk-\nbased targeting rules to select individuals for scrutiny, investigation, and nomination to one \nor more terrorist watchlists. \n185.  In order to designate a person on the federal terrorist watchlist, a federal \ngovernment official must make a nomination and a TSC official must accept the nomination.   \nTSC officials accept nominations at a rate above 98 percent.    \n53 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 54 of 268\n186.  Based on the facts alleged in this Complaint and the publicly known processes \nof the federal terrorist watchlist, a quantitative analysis can be constructed to measure and \ndescribe the performance and efficacy of the federal terrorist watchlist. \n187.  A  quantitative  analysis  requires  that,  in  order  to  accomplish  the  federal \nterrorist watchlist’s stated objectives, Defendants must have at least some greater-than-\nrandom ability to identify future terrorists.  This is due to the nature of the processes \nDefendants utilize to place persons on the federal terrorist watchlist and the size of the \npopulation  Defendants  can—if  they  so  choose—screen  against  the  federal  terrorist \nwatchlist’s inclusion standards. \n188.  A quantitative analysis demonstrates that Defendants’ watchlisting system \nwould perform similarly if inclusion on the watchlist was done via random selection instead \nof the existing inclusion standards Defendants utilize.   \n189.  A quantitative analysis therefore indicates that Defendants have no ability to \nwatchlist persons whose placement on the watchlist would further Defendants’ stated \nobjectives. \n190.  The TSA has conceded that it cannot identify any terrorist plots which were \nfoiled or deterred based on either the Quiet Skies or the Silent Partner programs. \nWatchlist Practices Target and Disproportionately Harm American Muslims \n191.  As of January 2018, the Pew Research Center estimates that there are 3.45 \nmillion Muslims living in the United States, accounting for 1.1% of the total U.S. population.  \nParticularly robust Muslim populations live, inter alia, in Michigan, Illinois, Washington, D.C., \nNew Jersey, New York, and California. \n54 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 55 of 268\n192.  Dearborn,  Michigan  is  a  suburb  of  Detroit  with  a  large  Arab-Muslim \ncommunity, comprising 40% of its approximately 100,000-person population.   Due to \nDearborn’s significant Muslim population, it has earned a reputation as the “Muslim Capital \nof America.”  As of 2013, Dearborn was second only to New York City (population: 8.5 \nmillion) for the total number of residents listed on the federal terrorist watchlist.  As of that \nsame date, no Muslims from Dearborn had ever committed acts of terrorism against the \nUnited States. \n193.  Defendants’  over-eager  practice  of  approving  watchlist  nominations  of \nrelatives or associates of already-listed individuals imposes overwhelming network effects \nin Muslim communities such as Dearborn.  One watchlist nomination, even if grounded in \nprobable cause or a preexisting criminal conviction, can rapidly spiral into the government \nclassifying nearly every member of an extended family or community mosque as a potential \nor suspected terrorist. \n194.  The federal terrorist watchlist and its inclusion standards disproportionately \ntarget and affect American Muslims.  Defendants, knowingly, intentionally, and purposefully \nuse impermissible and inaccurate religious profiles to nominate, accept, disseminate, and \ndeploy the federal terrorist watchlist against American Muslims in a manner that is different \nfrom other faith backgrounds.    \n195.  Defendants consider origin from Muslim-majority countries, travel to Muslim-\nmajority countries, travel on religious pilgrimages, learning Arabic, attending mosques, \nzakat donations to Muslim charities, the wearing of typical Muslim dress, the frequency of \nMuslim  prayer,  adherence  to  Islamic  religious  practices,  affiliations  with  Muslim \norganizations,  and  associations  with  other  Muslims  as  suspicious  factors  supporting \n55 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 56 of 268\ninclusion in the TSDB, on the Quiet Skies/Silent Partner Selectee List(s), and on other high-\nrisk-potential-terrorist watchlists. \n196.  But while travel to Muslim-majority countries is more likely to land a Muslim \non the watchlist, the same is not true of a non-Muslim.  Thus, Defendants treat otherwise \nsimilarly-situated individuals differently depending on their religion.   \n197.  In fact, almost all – if not, all – legal challenges regarding designations on the \nfederal terrorist watchlist have been filed by Muslims nationwide.6 \n198.  Upon information and belief, when Defendants review lists of social networks \nand known associates of a currently watchlisted individual, they routinely chose to nominate \nArab or Muslim names that cross their desk on the stereotyped basis of race, religion, or \nnational origin alone.  Meanwhile, Defendants gloss over any stereotypically white, Christian, \nEnglish, or Western-European names that may appear in the same network lists, such as \nclassmates or colleagues.  This is true even when the only distinction between a nominated \nperson and a non-nominated person are improper race, religion, or national origin criteria.   \n                                                        \n6 See Rahman v. Chertoff, No. 05-cv-3761 (N.D. Ill.); Ibrahim v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., No. \n06-cv-00545 (N.D. Cal.); Scherfen v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, No. 3:08-cv-1554 (M.D. \nPa.); Latif v.

Wray, No. 2:17-cv-622 (D. \nUtah); Kovac v. Wray, 3:18-cv-110 (N.D. Tx.).  Many of these legal challenges were filed by \ngroups of multiple Muslim plaintiffs. \n56 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 57 of 268\n199.  Although most terrorist acts in the United States are committed by non-\nMuslims,  and  indeed  in  many  cases  are  committed  by  anti-Muslim  extremists,  the \noverwhelming majority of U.S. citizens on the watchlist are Muslim.  This is a result of the \nGovernment’s knowing, intentional, and purposeful use of religious, racial, and national \norigin criteria, including as described above. \n200.  Upon information and belief, Defendants dismiss mass violence perpetrated \nby white Christians as “lone wolf” events unconnected to “organized” terrorism, while \noverreacting to comparable or even less serious events perpetrated by Muslims.   \n201.  Upon information and belief, even though they facially satisfy the same known \nassociate  watchlist  criteria,  close  families  and  friends  of  convicted  white-nationalist \ndomestic terrorists are not routinely added to the federal terrorist watchlist, while distant \nfamilies and friends of innocent Muslims often discover that their mere association with \nother watchlisted individuals has caused them to be labeled potential terrorists.   Thus, the \nGovernment does not treat similarly-situated groups the same, singling out Muslims for \nharsher treatment. \n202.  By  way  of  singular  example,  on  February  20,  2019,  federal  prosecutors \nindicted Lieutenant Christopher Hasson for plotting a large-scale terrorist attack.  Despite \nsignificant evidence of Hasson’s extremism and potential for terrorism, not only does it \nappear that was Hasson not on the terrorism watchlist, he held a Secret level security \nclearance.  Nor is there any reason to believe any of Hasson’s friends or relatives have been \nadded to the watchlist. \n203.  Defendants’ 2013 Watchlisting Guidance indicates that “[t]ravel for no known \nlawful or legitimate purpose to a locus of terrorist activity” can be a basis for being listed.  \n57 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 58 of 268\nWhile a “locus of Terrorist Activity” is not defined by the document, upon information and \nbelief, it likely includes any place where many Muslims reside. \n204.  By intentionally and purposefully emphasizing Arab origins or Islamic faith \nabove all else, Defendants have utilized the watchlist far beyond its intended purpose.  \nInstead of serving as a targeted tool to enhance aviation and border security, the watchlist \nhas become a bludgeon to coerce everyday American Muslims into spying on their neighbors \nand  becoming  government  informants.    Presence  on  the  watchlist  is  deployed  as  an \nintimidation tactic and used to coercively justify the denial of American-Muslims’ civil rights, \nsuch as the right to have an attorney present during law enforcement questioning. \n205.  Along  with  the  experiences  of  Plaintiffs  John  Doe  2  and  Hicham  Hall  as \ndescribed in more detail below, public examples of this phenomenon abound.  See Latif v. \nHolder, 28 F. Supp. 3d 1134, 1145 (D. Or. 2014) (an FBI agent told Steven Washburn that he \n“would help remove Washburn's name from the No-Fly List if he agreed to speak to the \nFBI”)7; Id. at 1146 (FBI agents told Ibraheim Mashal that “his name would be removed from \nthe No-Fly List and he would receive compensation if he helped the FBI by serving as an \ninformant”): Id. (FBI agents offered Amir Meshal “the opportunity to serve as a government \ninformant in exchange for assistance in removing his name from the No-Fly List”).  See also \nFikre v. FBI, 23 F. Supp. 3d 1268, 1278-79 (D. Or. May 29, 2014) (Emirati officials told Yonas \nFikre that he “could not travel to the United States by air because he is on the No-Fly List” \nand an FBI agent told Fikre that “the FBI could take steps to remove [him] from the No-Fly \nList if he agreed to be an informant”); Tanvir v Tanzin, 894 F.3d 449 (2d Cir. 2018) (multiple \nMuslim Plaintiffs “asked to gather information on members of Muslim communities and \n                                                        \n7 Washburn, like every other individual described in this Paragraph, is Muslim.  \n58 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 59 of 268\nreport  that  information  to  the  FBI”  and  “[i]n  some  instances,  the  FBI’s  request  was \naccompanied with severe pressure, including threats of deportation or arrest; in others, the \nrequest was accompanied by promises of financial and other assistance”). \n206.  The FBI has sought to recruit some of the Plaintiffs, and similarly situated \nwatchlisted Americans, as informants. \n207.  To American Muslims, the watchlist is an ever-present threat of increased \nscrutiny and adverse consequences which descends without notice, cannot be effectively \nredressed, and chills their constitutionally-protected exercise of speech and religion. \nInadequacy of the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program Process \n208.  Defendants have not provided travelers, including the Watchlisted Plaintiffs \nand similarly situated American citizens and foreign nationals, with a clear, fair, timely, or \neffective mechanism through which they can challenge the TSC’s decision to designate them \nas a potential terrorist and place them on the watchlist.  Nor can Watchlisted Plaintiffs and \nsimilarly situated American citizens and foreign nationals challenge DHS’s inclusion of \nPlaintiffs on separate but related high-risk potential-terrorist lists such as Quiet Skies and \nSilent Partner. \n209.  No single government entity is responsible for removing an individual from \nthe TSDB.  The FBI administers the TSC and the watchlist but does not accept redress \ninquiries from the public.  The NCTC which manages the TIDE list (which in turn supplies \nnames to the TSC watchlist) also does not accept redress inquiries from the public.  Neither \nentity directly provides final disposition letters to individuals who have submitted redress \ninquiries.   \n59 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 60 of 268\n210.  The only redress “process” available to individuals included on the terrorist \nwatchlist is the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program.   Individuals who have been denied \nentry or boarding, subjected to additional screening, or who otherwise suspect that they may \nbe on the watchlist, may seek redress by submitting an inquiry to DHS TRIP.  At that time, \nDHS TRIP provides individuals with a “Redress Control Number.”     \n211.  The DHS TRIP Redress process primarily affects the TSA’s screening of airport \ntravelers and TSDB Listees; it has limited (if any) impact on TSDB Listees’ overall TSDB \nstatus, including their screening at land borders by CBP, or their screening for immigration, \nvisas, employment, security clearances, or credentialing by other federal agencies. \n212.  DHS TRIP submits the traveler complaints of TSDB Listees to the TSC, which \ndetermines whether any action should be taken.  The TSC has not provided any publicly \navailable information about how it evaluates complaints or makes that decision.  The TSC is \nthe final arbiter of whether an individual’s name is retained on or removed from the \nwatchlist, including those of the Watchlisted Plaintiffs and similarly situated American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals.  In 2009, the TSC testified to \nCongress that of the watchlist DHS TRIP cases “approximately 51 percent are appropriately \nwatchlisted, 22 percent have been modified or reviewed prior to redress, 10 percent were \nsimilar names, and 15 percent were removed or downgraded due to the redress process.” \n213.  The TSA Administrator may provide input regarding whether a DHS TRIP \nRedress applicant listed on the TSDB should be removed, but as of December 2017, the TSA \nAdministrator had taken no action regarding the removal of TSDB Listees in two years. \n214.  Being removed from the No Fly List or the Selectee List does not mean that an \nindividual is also removed from the TSDB. \n60 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 61 of 268\n215.  Being removed from the TSDB does not mean that an individual will cease to \nbe treated as a terrorist, as they may continue to be subjected to terrorist-level scrutiny \nthrough the operation of the TSA and CBP’s rules-based targeted terrorist monitoring lists.  \n216.  The Government does not provide an American citizen with a meaningful \nopportunity to confront, or to rebut, the grounds for his or her possible inclusion on the \nwatchlist.  No information is available to the Watchlisted Plaintiffs and similarly situated \nAmerican citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals about what specific \nfacts the TSC considers during the redress process, and no opportunity is provided for the \nWatchlisted Plaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent residents, \nand foreign nationals to contest or correct those facts. \n217.  Once the TSC makes a determination about a particular individual’s status on \nthe watchlist, it sends the result to DHS TRIP.  DHS TRIP in turn responds to the individual \nwith a standard form letter that neither confirms nor denies the existence of any terrorist \nwatchlist records relating to the individual.   \n218.  In  response  to  prior  litigation,  DHS  TRIP  letters  are  now  required  to \naffirmatively state whether a U.S. complainant is presently on the No Fly List.  However, DHS \nTRIP does not disclose Selectee, Expanded Selectee, or Quiet Skies/Silent Partner Selectee \nlist status.   The DHS TRIP letters continue to provide no information on historical watchlist \nstatus,  no  information  as  to  whether  a  person  is  included  in  the  TSDB  generally,  no \nmeaningful factual basis for the individual’s inclusion on the watchlist, and no information \nas to whether the government has resolved the specific complaint at issue. \n61 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 62 of 268\n219.  The DHS TRIP process as modified does nothing to resolve the fact that the \nstandard for inclusion itself violates due process, a problem for which providing additional \nprocess related to that standard could cure.  \n220.  The  DHS  TRIP  process,  does  not  provide  any  pre-deprivation  process \n(whether on an ex parte basis or not), even though individuals on the Selectee, Expanded \nSelectee, or Quiet Skies/Silent Partner Selectee list face amorphous criteria for being placed \non the list and the decision not to an individual on the No Fly List establishes that the \nGovernment does not have any reason to believe the individual is an imminent security \nthreat.   \n221.  The DHS TRIP process does not provide a meaningful hearing in front of a \nneutral arbiter. \n222.  The TSA Administrator has not processed a single No Fly List determination \narising out of DHS Trip since 2015. \n223.  The  DHS  TRIP  process  does  not  require  the  Government  to  consider \nexculpatory information in its possession.   \n224.  The  DHS  TRIP  process  does  not  consider  lesser  ways  to  ameliorate  the \ndeprivation of liberty caused by (wrongfully) being on the list such as the potential for an \nindividual to submit to advance screening prior to a scheduled trip. \n225.  As such, DHS TRIP offers no meaningful or substantive review of the watchlist \ndesignation and in effect shields the TSC’s actions with respect to the individual nominations \nor classes of nominations from meaningful review by any independent authority, including \nthe judiciary.   \n62 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 63 of 268\n226.  Instead, DHS TRIP operates as a mere middleman, forwarding complaints to \nthe TSC while shielding the TSC’s substantive determinations from individual, independent, \nor judicial review.  Thus, the only “process” available to individuals caught up in the federal \nterrorist watchlisting system is to submit their names and other identifying information to \nDHS TRIP, a government entity that itself has no authority to provide redress, and then hope \nthat some other unspecified government agency self-identifies an error or changes its mind. \n227.  Individuals are justifiably skeptical of Defendants’ willingness to engage in \nmeaningful  introspection  or  self-correction.    Famously,  in  Ibrahim  v.  Department  of \nHomeland  Security,  06-CV-00545,  Dkt.  No.  701-1  (N.D.  Cal.  Feb.  6,  2014),  Defendants \nvigorously contested a Muslim graduate student’s challenge to her No Fly List designation \nand subsequent revocation of her student visa.  Defendants’ actions had stranded her in \nMalaysia for nine years.  Following trial, it was ultimately revealed that her placement on the \nNo Fly List was the result of an FBI agent’s error in November 2004.  He had accidentally \nchecked the wrong box.  Slip op. at 9. \n228.  The government’s own internal audits of the watchlist system point to serious \nflaws.  For example, a March 2008 DOJ Office of the Inspector General report entitled Audit \nof the U.S. Department of Justice Terrorism Watchlist Nomination Processes found significant \nproblems with the nomination and removal process.  Rather than address those problems, \nDefendants’ approach since 2008 has been to double-down on questionable nomination and \nredress practices, exponentially increasing the watchlist’s size and adverse consequences. \n229.  A federal judge observed in Mohamed v. Holder, 995 F. Supp. 2d 520, 532 (E.D. \nVa. 2014), that “[a] showing of past or ongoing unlawful conduct does not seem to be \nrequired,… But the Court has little, if any, ability to articulate what information is viewed by \n63 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 64 of 268\nTSC as sufficiently ‘derogatory’ beyond the labels it has provided the Court.  In sum, the No \nFly List assumes that there are some American citizens who are simply too dangerous to be \npermitted to fly, no matter the level of pre-flight screening or on-flight surveillance and \nrestraint, even though those citizens cannot be legally arrested, detained, or otherwise \nrestricted in their movements or conduct.”   \n230.  The Mohamed court went on to find that “[i]nclusion on the No Fly List also \nlabels an American citizen a disloyal American who is capable of, and disposed toward \ncommitting war crimes, and one can easily imagine the broad range of consequences that \nmight be visited upon such a person if that stigmatizing designation were known by the \ngeneral public” and that  “[t]he process of nomination to the No Fly List is based on a \nsuspected level of future dangerousness that is not necessarily related to any unlawful \nconduct.”  See id. at 529 and 531. \n231.  Another federal case permitted a broad challenge to the federal terrorist \nwatchlist to proceed.  In Elhady v. Piehota, 303 F. Supp. 3d 453, 465 (E.D. Va. 2016) the court \nheld that the “central meaning of procedural due process” is that parties whose rights are to \nbe affected are entitled to be heard; and in order that they may enjoy that right they must \nfirst be notified.” (Cleaned up).  The Court went on to state that the “Government’s ‘trust us’ \napproach is inconsistent with the fundamental procedural protections applicable to the \ndeprivation of a protected liberty interest, including the right to be heard.”  Id.  \nThe Experiences of the Plaintiffs on the Federal Terrorist Watchlist  \nBeing Treated as “Known or Suspected Terrorists” \n232.  All of the  Plaintiffs  that  are  challenging  their  designation  on  the  federal \nterrorist watchlist are practicing Muslims (together the “Watchlisted Plaintiffs”). \n64 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 65 of 268\n233.  All  of  the  Watchlisted  Plaintiffs  other  than  Plaintiffs  Khaled  El  Ali  and \nAbdaljalil Hijaz are United States citizens.  El Ali is a Belgium national.  Hijaz is a Palestine \nnational and permanent U.S. resident. \n234.  None  of  the  Watchlisted  Plaintiffs  have  ever  been  arrested,  charged  or \nconvicted of any type of terrorism-related offense. \n235.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the  nomination  and  designation  of  the \nWatchlisted Plaintiffs to the federal terrorist watchlist was made based solely upon a hunch \nand/or  based  upon  their  race,  ethnicity,  national  origin,  religious  affiliation,  guilt-by-\nassociation, or First Amendment protected activities. \n236.  Upon information and belief, because the Watchlisted Plaintiffs are included \non  the  federal  terrorist  watchlist,  Defendants  disseminated  and  are  continuing  to \ndisseminate their designation as “known or suspected terrorists” to governmental and \nprivate partners. \n237.  At no time were any of the Watchlisted Plaintiffs given notice of the factual \nbasis for their placement on the federal terrorist watchlist, and at no time were they offered \na meaningful opportunity to contest their designation. \n238.  Moreover, at no time were any of the Watchlisted Plaintiffs given notice of the \ndeprivation of their liberty interests or violation of their constitutional rights. \n239.  The experience of the Watchlisted Plaintiffs on the federal terrorist watchlist \nis indicative of government practice, policy, and the experiences of thousands of other \nAmericans, particularly American Muslims, who have been deemed suspected terrorists \nwithout notice and without redress. \n65 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 66 of 268\n240.  Each of the Watchlisted Plaintiffs experience anxiety, shame and humiliation \nbecause  of  being  designated  and  treated  by  the  government  as  “known  or  suspected \nterrorists” in public, and in some cases, in front of family members, friends and colleagues. \n241.  Many of the Watchlisted Plaintiffs have suffered monetary losses because of \nbeing designated and treated by the government as “known or suspected terrorists” in the \nform of lost business opportunities, missed flights, among other things. \n242.  Several of the Watchlisted Plaintiffs experienced additional anxiety, shame \nand humiliation, and in some cases the loss of important associations, because of family \nmembers, friends and/or colleagues also being treated as “known or suspected terrorists” \nsimply because they travelled together, described more fully below. \n243.  All of the Watchlisted Plaintiffs have been discouraged from traveling because \nof being treated as “known or suspected terrorists,” and because of the anxiety, shame and \nhumiliation they are subjected to each time they travel. \n244.  Many of the Watchlisted Plaintiffs have avoided and have continued to avoid \ntraveling by air or crossing land ports of entry because of being treated as “known or \nsuspected terrorists,” and because of the anxiety, shame and humiliation they are subjected \nto each time they travel. \n245.  Many of the Watchlisted Plaintiffs have been subjected to interrogations about \ntheir religious practices and beliefs, the answers of which, upon information and belief, are \nfactors that were considered in their inclusion to the federal terrorist watchlist. \n246.  The  practice  of  Islam  of  the  Watchlisted  Plaintiffs,  in  addition  to  family \nmembers that have been subjected to similar interrogations due to their relationships with \nthe Watchlisted Plaintiffs, have been substantially burdened by Defendants. \n66 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 67 of 268\n247.  Upon information and belief, as of the date of this filing, the Watchlisted \nPlaintiffs all remain on the federal terrorist watchlist. \nThe El Ali Family  \n \nPlaintiffs Rami Khaled El Ali and Mia Khaled El Ali \n(Family Members of a Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n248.  Rami is 11-years-old and the son of Mr. Khaled El Ali (discussed below).  \n249.  Mia is 14-years-old and the daughter of Mr. El Ali.  \n250.  In 2010, Mia and Rami relocated to Michigan and now live with their mother.  \nPrior to that, they lived with their entire family, including father, Mr. El Ali, in Belgium.  \n251.  Mia is an active eighth grader with a passion for basketball and volleyball.  She \nhas been a part of her school’s basketball team for six years.  She’s played volleyball on and \noff for six years too.   \n252.  Rami is an active sixth grader with a love for basketball, baseball, soccer, and \nchess.     \n253.  Mia and Rami have a close relationship with their father.  Until Mr. El Ali was \nbarred from the United States, Mia and Rami had never celebrated a birthday without him.  \nEven though their father lives in Belgium, he would travel every single year to celebrate their \nbirthdays in Michigan.  \n254.  Mia’s and Rami’s father would visit them for approximately two weeks at a \ntime in March (to celebrate Mia’s birthday), in May (before school ends for summer), and in \nNovember (to celebrate Rami’s birthday). Mr. El Ali would rent a condo and Mia and Rami \nwould stay with him during those visits.  \n67 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 68 of 268\n255.  Since March 2017, Mia’s and Rami’s father has not been able to visit them in \nthe United States.  Instead, last year, they had to travel to and from Amsterdam, Netherlands \nalone on two occasions, so they could see and spend time with him.   \n256.  During one of Mia’s travels from Belgium to Michigan, Mia’s boarding pass was \nstamped  with  the  “SSSS”  designation  indicating  that  she  was  a  “known  or  suspected \nterrorist.”  She was patted down at the security checkpoint.  Upon information and belief, \nMia received the “SSSS” designation and enhanced screening because of her relationship to \nher father, Mr. El Ali.   \n257.  At the gate and before being allowed to board, in public view and in front of \nher little brother, Rami, Mia was once again subjected to another round of screening.  Mia \nwas forced to remove her shoes and her laptop from her bag. Mia was subjected to chemical \nresidue testing on her laptop.  Additionally, Mia was questioned.   \n258.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Mia  was  subjected  to  enhanced  screening, \nchemical testing, and questioning by Belgium authorities due to her relationship to her \nfather,  Mr.  El  Ali  and  his  status  on  the  federal  terrorist  watchlist  being  shared  with \nNetherlandic authorities by Defendants.  \n259.  Because of Mr. El Ali’s status on Defendants’ watchlist and inability to enter \nthe United States, for the first time ever, Mia had to celebrate her birthday without her father \nin March 2018.  Her birthday had always been a happy and festive occasion for the family.  \nHowever, this year, Mia did not want to even have a birthday party.  She was angry, sad, and \nconfused as to why her father could not come spend time with her. Instead of celebrating her \nbirthday with her father in person, she was only able to see him via a video phone call on \n68 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 69 of 268\nFaceTime at which point she became extremely emotional and began to cry as he started to \ntalk.  \n260.  Mia is routinely asking her mother when she’s “going to see baba8?” Recently, \nshe expressed that she wants to move back to Belgium.  \n261.  Mia is a rising ninth grader.  She is excited for another year of volleyball and \nbasketball.  However, Mia wants to spend as much time with her father as possible this \nsummer.  Unfortunately, this upcoming year, volleyball season starts weeks before the \nacademic school year.  Due to her father’s inability to travel to Michigan, Mia is forced to \nchoose between spending more time with her father in Belgium this summer or shortening \nher summer trip so she can return to Michigan and join her friends on the volleyball team. \nThis is a choice no 14-year-old should ever have to make.   \n262.  In May 2018, during a phone call with her father, Mia could not bring herself \nto discuss whether she would forgo part of her summer trip in Belgium to join the volleyball \nteam.  Feeling overwhelmed, she broke down and began to sob during the call.   \n263.  Because his father has not been able to visit, Rami’s education has been \nadversely affected.  Rami’s grades have drastically taken a turn for the worse.   \n264.  Rami’s health is also being severely affected.  Rami is continuously depressed. \nEvery activity he participates in, Rami wishes his father was with him.  Whenever his father \nwould visit, they were inseparable; they would do everything together.   \n265.  To help with his education and depression, Rami’s mother has been forced to \nhire a tutor so that Rami can get more personal time to work on his emotions and grades.   \n                                                        \n8 Baba is an Arabic word of endearment meaning “father,” similar to “daddy.”  \n69 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 70 of 268\n266.  Whenever Rami sees other children with their fathers, he routinely asks “when \nis baba gonna be able to come back?” It breaks his mother’s heart that she cannot provide \nhim with a concrete answer or reason for why his father cannot visit.   \n267.  Approximately every two weeks, Rami gets overwhelmed with the fact that his \nfather cannot visit him. When his mother asks him what’s wrong, Rami says that he misses \nhis father and begins to choke up and uncontrollably sob.   \n268.  While Rami excels in active sports, he is particularly fond of playing chess \nbecause his father taught him how to play.  Each time his father would visit, they would play \nchess together.  Nowadays, they are relegated to playing chess online.   \n269.   Rami’s father would visit and celebrate his birthday in November every year.  \nRami’s entire family—Rami, his father, mother, and sister—would have a family dinner \ntogether.  They would also have an extended family party at the house and a party for all his \nfriends at a kid-friendly place in Michigan.   \n270.  Because of his father’s inability to enter the United States, Rami’s father could \nnot attend his eleventh birthday.  As a result, Rami was depressed on his birthday.  He did \nnot want to have a birthday party without his father.  Instead, Rami’s mom organized a small \nfamily gathering.  \n271.  Rami is a rising seventh grader. He is excited for another year of baseball and \nsoccer. Because Rami’s father cannot visit him in the United States, Rami is being forced to \nmiss the end of baseball season and the beginning of soccer so that he can go to Belgium and \nspend as much time with his father as possible.  This is a sacrifice no 11-year-old should ever \nhave to make.   \n70 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 71 of 268\n272.  Since her father has been barred from entering the United States, Mia has \nmissed out on many father-daughter moments that are instrumental in a young woman’s life.   \n273.  Since his father has been barred from entering the United States, Rami has \nmissed out on many father-son moments that are instrumental in a teenager’s life.   \n274.  Mia and Rami video chat on FaceTime with their father every day.   \n275.  Mia and Rami need their father; Defendants are the main cause that they are \nleft without a father in the United States.   \n276.  Because Defendants have improperly placed their father, Mr. El Ali, on the \nSelectee and/or No Fly List, which subsequently caused the revocation of his ESTA waiver \nand  placement  on  administrative  status  of  his  non-immigrant  visa,  Defendants  are \ninterfering with Mia’s and Rami’s liberty interest in their familial relations.  Defendants have \ndone so without providing Mia and Rami any due process.   \nPlaintiff Khaled El Ali \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n277.  Khaled El Ali is the father of Plaintiffs Mia Khaled El Ali and Rami Khaled El Ali.  \n278.  Pursuant to a custody agreement, Mia and Rami reside with their mother in \nthe United States year-round except for the summers and Christmas holidays which are \nspent in Belgium with their father, Mr. El Ali.   \n279.  In February 2017, Mr. El Ali traveled from Belgium to Michigan to celebrate \nMia’s 13th birthday.   \n280.  Mr. El Ali’s flight into the U.S. originated from Amsterdam, Netherlands to \nDetroit Metropolitan Airport on Delta Airlines.   \n71 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 72 of 268\n281.  While in Amsterdam, Mr. El Ali was not able to check-in online or at the airport \nkiosk.  Instead, he was directed to an airline representative for further assistance.   \n282.  At the ticket counter, after a delay, Mr. El Ali received his boarding pass.  Mr. \nEl Ali’s boarding passes was stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he is \ndesignated as a “known or suspected” terrorist.   \n283.  At the gate, Mr. El Ali was selected for enhanced screening.  He was instructed \nto remove his shoes. Thereafter, chemical residue testing was conducted on his person and \ncarry-on in public view.  This was done even though Mr. El Ali had been cleared with no \nissues at the security checkpoint.   \n284.  Mr. El Ali felt ashamed and humiliated, especially because he was treated as a \n“known or suspected terrorist” in public view.   \n285.  Once Mr. El Ali landed in Detroit, Michigan, he went through customs and \ninserted his passport at the kiosk.  The kiosk displayed a red “X” and he was instructed to \nproceed to a CBP officer for further processing.   \n286.  The CBP officer took Mr. El Ali’s fingerprints and interrogated him.  Thereafter, \nhe was taken to secondary inspection and waited until plainclothes officers arrived to \ninterrogate him in a private room.  \n287.  The officers interrogated him about his past, work and travel history, and his \nfamily.  They interrogated him about where he grew up; what he does in Lebanon when he \nvisits; where he stays where he goes to Lebanon; and if he knows anyone that has any legal \nproblems.  \n72 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 73 of 268\n288.  Mr. El Ali was forced to unlock his phone.  The officers searched his cell phone \nand interrogated him about his contacts.  The officers also searched through his photographs \nfor approximately 40 minutes.   \n289.  Mr. El Ali was interrogated for almost 2 hours. Thereafter, he was allowed \nentry into the United States.  Prior trips to the United States have resulted in similar \ntreatment.   \n290.  Mr. El Ali entered the U.S. on an Electronic System for Travel Authorization \n(“ESTA”)  waiver.    The  ESTA program  is  an  automated  system  used  to  determine  the \neligibility of visitors to travel to the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program.  Approved ESTA \napplications are valid for a period of two years, or until the passport expires, whichever \ncomes first, and multiple trips to the United States may be made without the traveler having \nto re-apply for another ESTA waiver.    \n291.  On March 2, 2017, within days of entering the United States, Mr. El Ali received \nan email informing him that his ESTA Travel Authorization Status had changed.   \n292.  After celebrating Mia’s birthday, Mr. El Ali returned to Belgium on or about \nMarch 11, 2017.   \n293.  From 2002 to 2017, Mr. El Ali was subjected to substantially similar treatment \nas described above.  \n294.  His boarding passes for his flights are routinely stamped with the “SSSS” \ndesignation, indicating that he has been designated by Defendants as a “known or suspected \nterrorist.”  \n295.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass.  \n73 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 74 of 268\n296.  Rather, Mr. El Ali is directed to an airline representative, who then contacts \nDefendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that can take a very \nlong time.  \n297.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it.  \n298.  Mr. El Ali is routinely subjected to enhanced screening. Mr. El Ali feels ashamed \nand humiliated, especially because he is routinely treated as a “known or suspected terrorist” \nin public view and in front of his children and former wife when they travel with him and \nbecause his family is delayed and humiliated because they are traveling with Mr. El Ali.  \n299.  On or about March 23, 2017, Mr. El Ali went to the U.S. Embassy in Brussels, \nBelgium to interview for a non-immigrant visa.  During the interview, Mr. El Ali was asked if \nhe had ever been to flight school, what he does for a living, and what he’ll be doing in the \nUnited States.   \n300.  At the U.S. Embassy, Mr. El Ali was informed that he was not approved for the \nvisa,  that  additional  security  checks  were  needed,  and  that  his  application  is  under \nadministrative processing.   \n301.  Mr. El Ali is a dedicated and committed father.  Since his children relocated to \nthe United States in 2010 after his divorce and up until February 2017, Mr. El Ali had visited \nhis children, Mia and Rami, every year during the following times:  \na.  March – for approximately two weeks to visit and celebrate Mia’s birthday;  \nb.  May – before Mia’s and Rami’s school year ends for summer vacation. Mia and \nRami would accompany Mr. El Ali to Belgium once the school year ended; and \n74 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 75 of 268\nc.  November – to celebrate Rami’s birthday.  \n302.  Until February 2017 when Defendants revoked Mr. El Ali’s ESTA waiver and \nbarred him from the United States, Mr. El Ali had never missed his children’s birthdays.  \n303.  Upon information and belief, Mr. El Ali’s ESTA waiver was revoked because of \nhis status on the federal terrorist watchlist.  \n304.  Upon information and belief, Mr. El Ali’s non-immigrant visa was not approved \nand instead has been placed on administrative processing since March 2017 because of his \nstatus on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.    \n305.  Recently, Mia visited Mr. El Ali in Amsterdam, Netherlands.  Her boarding pass \ncontained an “SSSS” designation indicating she is a “known or suspected terrorist.”  Upon \ninformation and belief, Mia was subjected to this designation because she is Mr. El Ali’s \ndaughter.  \n306.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Mr.  El  Ali  remains  on  the  federal  terrorist \nwatchlist.   \nPlaintiff Mutasem Jardaneh \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n307.  On August 9, 2017, Mutasem Jardaneh was returning from a brief trip to \nCanada through the Ambassador Bridge land port of entry in Michigan with his sister, \nbrother-in-law, and four-year-old nephew.   \n308.  Upon presenting the primary CBP officer with his passport card, the CBP \nofficer pressed a button to alert other CBP officers and instructed him to place his hands on \nthe steering wheel and look forward. \n75 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 76 of 268\n309.  Several armed CBP officers immediately surrounded Mr. Jardaneh and his \nfamily on all sides with their hands on their hips near their guns. \n310.  The CBP officers ordered Mr. Jardaneh to exit the car, hands first, and to walk \nbackwards until instructed to stop.  Thereafter, he was detained.  \n311.  The CBP officers then ordered his brother-in-law out of the car, hands first, \nand to walk backwards until instructed to stop.   \n312.  Mr. Jardaneh’s sister and nephew were also forced to exit the vehicle and walk \nto the CBP officers.  \n313.  Then, Mr. Jardaneh was escorted by the CBP officers to a holding cell and \ndetained, where he was subjected to an invasive pat down, fingerprinted, searched and \ninterrogated for over four hours.  His belongings were also seized and searched. \n314.  Mr.  Jardaneh’s  brother-in-law  was  detained  in  a  separate  room  and \nthoroughly searched.   \n315.  While Mr. Jardaneh was being interrogated, Mr. Jardaneh requested to contact \nan attorney; however, the CBP officers denied his request, prevented him from contacting an \nattorney, and continued to interrogate him. \n316.  The CBP officers confiscated his cell phone, and upon information and belief, \ndownloaded the information and data from his cell phone without his consent. The CBP \nofficers temporarily confiscated Mr. Jardaneh’s brother-in-law’s cell phone also.  Upon \ninformation  and  belief,  Defendants  downloaded  the  information  from  Mr.  Jardaneh’s \nbrother-in-law’s cell phone.  \n76 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 77 of 268\n317.  Mr. Jardaneh had an anxiety attack because of the treatment he was being \nsubjected to.  An ambulance was called and paramedics arrived to take Mr. Jardaneh to an \nemergency room at a nearby hospital.   \n318.  The CBP officers handcuffed Mr. Jardaneh to the stretcher in the ambulance \nand accompanied him to the hospital where he received medical treatment.  The CBP officers \ntold the hospital that Mr. Jardaneh was a “prisoner.” \n319.  Defendants did not return Mr. Jardaneh’s cell phone until four or five days later \nvia mail.  \n320.  Mr. Jardaneh felt ashamed and humiliated that his family and the hospital staff \nwitnessed him being treated by the government as a criminal and a “known or suspected \nterrorist.” \n321.  Moreover, Mr. Jardaneh also felt ashamed and humiliated that his family \nmembers that were traveling with him were also treated as criminals and “known or \nsuspected terrorists” just because they were traveling with him.  \n322.  Ever since this encounter, Mr. Jardaneh has suffered from anxiety and trauma \nand has been taking prescription medications to help him cope. \n323.  A few days later, Mr. Jardaneh arrived at Detroit Metropolitan Airport to board \nhis flight to Florida. \n324.  He was unable to check-in online or at the airport kiosk.  Rather, he was \ndirected to an airline representative for further assistance. \n325.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, Mr. \nJardaneh had to wait approximately an hour before the airline representative obtained \nclearance for Mr. Jardaneh to board his flight. \n77 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 78 of 268\n326.  His boarding pass was stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he \nwas designated as a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n327.  Once Mr. Jardaneh arrived at the TSA security checkpoint, he provided his \nboarding pass and identification documents to the TSA agent stationed at the entrance to the \nTSA security checkpoint.   \n328.  The boarding pass scanner indicated a red light when Mr. Jardaneh’s boarding \npass was scanned.   \n329.  Mr. Jardaneh was escorted to a different line than the other travelers passing \nthrough the TSA security checkpoint and subjected to enhanced screening.   \n330.  Mr. Jardaneh was subjected to an extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of all his personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings in public view at \nthe TSA checkpoint.  Mr. Jardaneh felt the intense glares of other travelers staring at him \nwhile  he  was  being  screened.    A  TSA  agent  confiscated  Mr.  Jardaneh’s  prescription \neyeglasses.  The TSA screening lasted forty-five minutes.  \n331.  Once Mr. Jardaneh finally arrived at the gate, several TSA agents were waiting \nfor him to arrive.  The TSA agents had with them a cart with chemical testing machines.   \n332.  While Mr. Jardaneh waited to board his flight, he noticed two air marshals \nfollowing him throughout the airport.   \n333.  At the gate and before being allowed to board, in public view, Mr. Jardaneh was \nonce again subjected to an invasive and lengthy pat down, all his personal belongings were \nsearched again, and he and his belongings were subjected to another round of chemical \n78 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 79 of 268\nresidue testing even though he had just cleared security with no issues at the TSA security \ncheckpoint. \n334.  Once on the airplane, the two air marshals that were tailing him inside the \nairport sat near him, one of each side, and surveilled him during the flight.   \n335.  Mr. Jardaneh’s roommate and her ex-husband were both interrogated about \nMr. Jardaneh. \n336.  Mr. Jardaneh became terrified for his life and safety; and because of the above-\ndescribed experiences, he left the United States and applied for asylum in Canada seeking \nprotection from the United States government. \n337.  Mr.  Jardaneh  has  lost  business  opportunities  as  a  direct  result  of  being \ndesignated on the federal terrorist watchlist. \n338.  Moreover, upon information and belief, Mr. Jardaneh’s movements and online \nactivities are being surveilled by Defendants without a warrant. \n339.  Mr. Jardaneh has filed a DHS TRIP inquiry.  On September 29, 2017, Mr. \nJardaneh received a letter as described in Paragraph 217 and was assigned a redress control \nnumber.   \n340.  Because of being placed on the federal terrorist watchlist, Mr. Jardaneh will be \nclosing two businesses that he has operated at or near the beginning of 2017.   \n341.  Mr. Jardaneh operates a real estate company and a consultant business.  Both \nbusiness ventures require significant travel.  Due to the difficult and hassle associated with \nhis  travel,  Mr.  Jardaneh  has  not  been  able  to  freely  travel  and  explore  his  business \nopportunities.  \n79 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 80 of 268\n342.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Jardaneh remains on Defendants’ federal \nterrorist watchlist.  \nPlaintiff John Doe  \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n343.  John Doe is frequently prevented from flying because of his designation on the \nfederal terrorist watchlist.  \n344.  In May 2017, John Doe arrived at Los Angeles International Airport for an \ninternational trip to Honduras.  John Doe was planning to meet his family members at a \nhealth spa because his cousin was diagnosed with cancer.  \n345.  He was unable to check-in online or at the airport kiosk. Rather, he was \ndirected to an airline representative for further assistance.  \n346.  Upon presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, \nJohn Doe was met by five agents who told him that he would not be able to board his flight.  \nThe agents refused to explain why they were preventing John Doe from boarding his flight.  \nJohn Doe was unable to obtain a full refund his flight or the trip costs for which he had already \npaid.  Additionally, John Doe was prevented from being with his family and providing \ncomfort and assistance to his cousin who was recently diagnosed with cancer.  John Doe was \ndevasted that he could not be with his family during that time.    \n347.  The agents, who upon information and belief were FBI agents, escorted him \noff the airport premises.  \n348.  A few months later, in October 2017, John Doe arrived once again at Los \nAngeles International Airport for an international trip to Indonesia.  \n80 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 81 of 268\n349.  Upon presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, the \nairline representative made a call to the Defendants in order to obtain clearance for him to \nboard his flight.  \n350.  After ending the call, the airline representative asked John Doe if he was \ncarrying any weapons and then told him he would not be able to board his flight.  \n351.  John Doe was not provided with a refund for his ticket. \n352.  He was ashamed, humiliated and frightened by these experiences. \n353.  After leaving the airport, John Doe received a call from FBI agents who said \nthey wanted to speak with him about what he needed to do in exchange for being permitted \nto fly. John Doe declined to speak with them without an attorney present.  \n354.  Around July 2017, John Doe was again prevented from checking in online for \na domestic flight from San Diego to Florida. \n355.  Because of his previous experiences, John Doe was discouraged from flying \nand cancelled his flight.   \n356.  John  Doe’s  watchlist  designation  has  prevented  him  from  visiting  family \nmembers and close friends. \n357.  On June 3, 2018, John Doe arrived at San Diego International Airport for an \ninternational trip to Indonesia to visit his fiancée and meet her family for the first time.  \n358.  Upon presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, the \nairline representative made a call to Defendants to obtain clearance for him to board his \nflight.  \n81 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 82 of 268\n359.  After ending the call, the airline representative told John Doe that she could \nnot provide him with a boarding pass and explained that TSA could not provide him with \nassistance. \n360.  The airline representative instructed John Doe to file a police report with the \npolice department.  \n361.  John Doe felt humiliated, especially since his fiancée and her family were \nexpecting him to arrive to meet her in Indonesia. \n362.  John Doe’s fiancée and her family learned of his status on Defendants’ federal \nterrorist watchlist because of John Doe’s experience being denied boarding.  \n363.  Because John Doe’s watchlist designation has prevented him from flying every \ntime he attempts to board a flight, John Doe has been forced to resort to other means of travel \nthat are costly and burdensome. \n364.  For example, in January 2018, John Doe took a train from San Diego to New \nYork  City  to  avoid  the  shame  and  humiliation  he  experiences  at  airports  because  of \nDefendants’ treatment and because he knew that he would be prevented from flying anyway. \n365.  The train ride lasted between four and five days and cost between 500 and \n600 dollars for a one-way trip.  \n366.  While the train was stopped at a connection in New Orleans, Louisiana, five or \nsix FBI agents attempted to conduct a canine search of John Doe’s personal belongings and \ndetained him for approximately one hour. \n367.  On February 28, 2018, John Doe arrived at Chicago O’Hare International \nAirport to try to board another flight, this time to San Diego.  \n82 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 83 of 268\n368.  Upon presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, the \nairline representative was unable to print John Doe’s boarding pass.  \n369.  The airline representative made a phone call to Defendants to obtain clearance \nfor John Doe to board his flight. \n370.  The airline representative then directed John Doe to the TSA office, where he \nwaited approximately two to three hours until the TSA office opened at 7 am.  \n371.  When the TSA office finally opened, he was told by a TSA agent that nothing \ncould be done for him. \n372.  Approximately one hour later, FBI agents Jake and Samir escorted John Doe to \na secluded area for interrogation where he was interrogated for approximately eight hours. \n373.  John Doe was interrogated about where he was going, how he traveled to the \nairport, what he had been doing, what he was trying to do, why he was attempting to fly, \npeople he knew, and whether he had plans to travel for military training.  \n374.  Because of his designation on the federal terrorist watchlist, John Doe has been \nsubjected to several more FBI interrogations. \n375.  For example, around approximately April or May of 2017, John Doe was \nsubjected to a secondary inspection after arriving at the San Ysidro Port of Entry to cross \nback into the United States by land. \n376.  FBI agents interrogated John Doe and pressured him to work for them as an \nFBI informant. They also offered John Doe money and told him they would resolve his travel \nissues in exchange for him agreeing to become an informant. \n377.  In July 2017, John Doe arrived in Mexico City and attempted to board a flight \nfrom Mexico to Honduras when Mexican intelligence agents detained and interrogated him.  \n83 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 84 of 268\n378.  The Mexican authorities informed John Doe that he had an FBI warrant out for \nhis arrest.  After his detention and interrogation, Mexican authorities deported John Doe to \nthe Rosarito Land Port of Entry.  \n379.  Upon information and belief, the Mexican authorities detained, interrogated, \nand deported John Doe due to his status of the federal terrorist watchlist being shared with \nMexican authorities by Defendants.   \n380.  Upon arrival at Rosarito Land Port of Entry, FBI agents interrogated John Doe \nabout his religious beliefs and asked him where he prays, how long he has been attending \nhis mosque, who he knows at his mosque, how he finds the strength to practice Islam, and \nthe struggles he deals with to practice his faith. \n381.  Because of his designation on the federal terrorist watchlist, John Doe is also \nroutinely detained at land border crossings up to ten hours at a time.  \n382.  In January 2017, John Doe was handcuffed and detained at San Ysidro Port of \nEntry, in front of his step-daughter. He was interrogated for approximately six hours. This \nwas the second time John Doe step-daughter witnessed CBP officers handcuff her step-\nfather.  John Doe was ashamed and humiliation that his step-daughter witnessed him being \ntreated as a criminal and “known or suspected terrorist.”  \n383.  In February 2017 alone, John Doe was detained at the San Ysidro Port of Entry \nbetween approximately six and eight hours on four different occasions.  \n384.  On February 22, 2017, John Doe was detained at the San Ysidro Port of Entry \nfor approximately ten hours.  \n385.  Sometime  between  March  and  July  2017,  John  Doe  was  detained  for \napproximately four to six hours.  \n84 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 85 of 268\n386.  Because of the above described treatment, John Doe is routinely humiliated in \npublic and in front of family members and has been discouraged from flying and has been \nstigmatized and treated as a criminal because of his status on Defendants’ federal terrorist \nwatchlist.  \n387.  Further, because of the above described treatment, John Doe was forced to \ndrop out from an online educational course because CBP agents confiscated John Doe’s \nlaptop and cell phone for two months. John Doe lost all the money he invested in course \nsupplies, software, and other material.  \n388.  Over two years of stored data on John Doe’s cell phone was lost when CBP \ndownloaded his cell phone’s data.  \n389.  Moreover, due to his watchlist designation, John Doe was forcibly separated \nfrom his wife.   \n390.  In October 2016, CBP officers detained John Doe and his wife at the time, \nhandcuffed him and interrogated him for approximately eight hours at Otay Mesa Port of \nEntry. \n391.  CBP officers handcuffed John Doe to a bench while they took John Doe’s wife \nto a separate room. They interrogated her about her religious affiliation, whether she \nplanned to go to Hajj, whether she was Sunni-Muslim or Shiite-Muslim, and which Imams \n(Islamic religious leaders) she was familiar with.   \n392.  CBP officers threatened to deport John Doe’s wife to Somalia, even though she \nwas a Canadian citizen and United States lawful permanent resident.  \n393.  John Doe’s wife was terrified of being deported to Somalia, where she would \nlikely be tortured. \n85 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 86 of 268\n394.  John Doe was shocked and frightened that Defendants would threaten his wife, \npotentially with her life, just because she was married to him. \n395.  Ever since this incident, their marriage became strained.  \n396.  Moreover, shortly after this incident, ICE agents searched John Doe’s home in \nsearch of his wife.  \n397.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants’  above-mentioned  treatment \ntargeting John Doe’s wife were designed to pressure and target John Doe.   \n398.  Because  of  Defendants’  above-mentioned  treatment,  John  Doe  moved  to \nMexico. \n399.  His wife at the time chose to remain in the United States because she feared \ntraveling with her husband would result in Defendants arresting and deporting her. \n400.  The stress and physical separation caused by John Doe’s watchlist designation \nstrained John Doe’s marriage, which led to his eventual divorce.   \n401.  John Doe was denied employment opportunities because of his watchlist \ndesignation.  \n402.  In August 2018, John Doe was offered a position as a commercial driver at \nPuget Transport LLC.  \n403.  On August 27, 2018, John Doe began training and the company asked about his \nability to travel for business reasons. \n404.  When  John  Doe  disclosed  his  watchlist  and  no-fly  list  designations,  the \ncompany revoked John Doe’s offer of employment.  \n405.  In addition to revoking his offer of employment, the company owner refused \nto service John Doe at a restaurant he owned.  \n86 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 87 of 268\n406.  John Doe also sought employment with LGR Consulting.   \n407.  When  John  Doe  disclosed  his  watchlist  and  no-fly  list  designations,  LGR \nConsulting denied John Doe employment because of concerns he would not be able to obtain \nnecessary government clearances due to his designations.  \n408.  On March 4, 2019, John Doe received an e-mail notice from Apple indicating \nthat the FBI requested information regarding his apple account, which Apple provided. \n409.  Upon information and belief, the FBI requested John Doe’s information due to \nhis watchlist or no-fly list designations.  \n410.  John Doe has filed a DHS TRIP inquiry.  He has received a letter as described in \nParagraph 217 and was assigned a redress control number. \n411.  Upon  information  and  belief,  John  Doe  remains  on  Defendants’  federal \nterrorist watchlist.  \nPlaintiff Bilal Abdurrashid \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n412.  Bilal Abdurrashid is a former executive of Lockheed Martin.  In his decades \nlong service in the Aerospace and Defense industry, Mr. Abdurrashid has held a Secret \nSecurity  Clearance.    Additionally,  Mr.  Abdurrashid  holds  a  Transportation  Worker \nIdentification Credential (“TWIC”).   \n413.  Mr. Abdurrashid is an avid outdoor sportsman.  He loves to camp and fish; and \nhe is routinely seen enjoying the outdoors on his boats.  In accordance with the Seafarers’ \nIdentity Documents Convention (Revised), 2003, of the International Labor Organization, \nMr. Abdurrashid operates his offshore boat pursuant to his Merchant Mariner Credential \nissued by the United States Coast Guard National Maritime Center.   \n87 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 88 of 268\n414.  Mr. Abdurrashid is also a staunch believer in the Second Amendment and \nowns several guns.  He has a Florida Concealed Carry Permit.   \n415.  To obtain the above licenses, credentials, and clearances, Mr. Abdurrashid was \nrequired to submit fingerprints that were checked against the Florida Information Center \ndatabase, the National Crime Information Center database and National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System for disqualifying offenses. \n416.  In June 2017, Mr. Abdurrashid arrived at an Orlando, Florida area airport for \na trip to Morocco.  His itinerary was Orlando to New York to Marrakech, Morocco.     \n417.  Mr. Abdurrashid was traveling to visit family with his wife and child.  Mr. \nAbdurrashid’s family witnessed the entire treatment that he was subjected to that day, \ndescribed below.   \n418.  At first, Mr. Abdurrashid was prevented from checking in online and at the \nairport kiosk.  Instead, he was directed to an airline representative for further assistance.   \n419.  Mr. Abdurrashid’s and his family’s boarding passes were stamped with the \n“SSSS” designation indicating that they each have been labeled as “known or suspected \nterrorists.”  \n420.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, the \nairline representative informed Mr. Abdurrashid that she could not issue boarding passes \nfor him or his family.  Mr. Abdurrashid was told that he and his family were barred from \nchecking in.  After several phone calls and a long delay, the airline representative was able \nto obtain clearance from Defendants so that Mr. Abdurrashid and his family could board his \nflight.   \n88 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 89 of 268\n421.  Once Mr. Abdurrashid and his family arrived at the TSA security checkpoint, \nthey provided their boarding passes and identification documents to the TSA agent stationed \nat the entrance of the TSA security checkpoint.    \n422.  Mr. Abdurrashid and his family were escorted to a different line than the other \ntravelers passing through the TSA security checkpoint and subjected to enhanced screening.   \n423.  Mr. Abdurrashid was subjected to an extensive and lengthy screening, an \ninvasive pat down including a search of his groin area, in addition to a TSA male agent placing \nhis fingers inside and around Mr. Abdurrashid’s waist, an extensive search of all his personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings in public view and \nin front of his family.  Mr. Abdurrashid’s wife and thirteen-year-old son received the same \ntreatment.    \n424.  When Mr. Abdurrashid and his family arrived in New York’s JFK airport to \nboard their connecting flight to Morocco, they were forced to go through the entire TSA \nenhanced screening process, described above, all over again.   \n425.  On July 31, 2017, Mr. Abdurrashid and his family arrived at the airport in \nMarrakech, Morocco for their flights to New York with a stop at the Casablanca, Morocco \nairport.    \n426.  In Marrakech, Mr. Abdurrashid’s wife and son were able to obtain  their \nboarding passes.  However, the airline representative could not issue Mr. Abdurrashid a \nboarding  pass.    After  several  unanswered  calls,  the  airline  representative  gave  Mr. \nAbdurrashid a boarding pass but only to Casablanca.   \n89 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 90 of 268\n427.  At the Casablanca airport, the airline representative made several calls to the \nUnited States before the airline representative could obtain clearance for Mr. Abdurrashid \nto board his flight to New York.   \n428.  Mr. Abdurrashid’s and his family’s boarding passes were stamped with the \n“SSSS”  designation  indicating  that  they  were  each  labeled  as  a  “known  or  suspected \nterrorist.”  \n429.  Mr. Abdurrashid and his family underwent enhanced screening, as described \nabove, before being allowed to board their flight.   \n430.  When they landed in New York, the airplane’s loudspeakers instructed the \npassengers to have their passports out.  Two armed plainclothes CBP officers checked the \npassengers’ passports as they stepped out of the airplane.  When Mr. Abdurrashid gave his \npassport to the CBP officers, they told him that he was the person they were looking for.    \nThey escorted Mr. Abdurrashid and his family in public view to get their luggage.   \n431.  Mr. Abdurrashid was escorted to secondary inspection where he was detained \nand interrogated.  He was detained in a separate room from his wife and child.   \n432.  The CBP officers confiscated Mr. Abdurrashid’s cell phone.  They proceeded to \nsearch his cell phone and social media.  Mr. Abdurrashid also had his luggage searched.   \n433.  While he was detained, the CBP officers also interrogated Mr. Abdurrashid.  He \nwas questioned about his trip to Morocco and his social media usage. At the same time, Mr. \nAbdurrashid’s wife was interrogated about her background.  But for a weather delay, Mr. \nAbdurrashid and his family would have missed their flight from New York to Orlando.   \n434.  After being allowed to leave by CBP, Mr. Abdurrashid and his family rushed to \nget their boarding passes for their flight to Orlando.  At first, his family received their \n90 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 91 of 268\nboarding passes without an “SSSS” designation.  However, once the airline representative \nrealized that his family was traveling with Mr. Abdurrashid, his wife and son had their \nboarding passes stamped with the “SSSS” designation indicating that they each have been \nlabeled as a “known or suspected terrorist.”  Mr. Abdurrashid’s boarding pass was stamped \nwith the “SSSS” designation too.   \n435.  Mr.  Abdurrashid  and  his  family  were  again  subjected  to  the  enhanced \nscreening at the TSA security checkpoint in public view as described above.   \n436.  At the gate, Mr. Abdurrashid was allowed to board his flight.  However, as Mr. \nAbdurrashid was taking his seat inside the plane, he was informed that his wife and son were \nbeing prevented from boarding.  Mr. Abdurrashid returned to the gate area to speak with the \nairline representatives.   \n437.  After a lengthy delay, Mr. Abdurrashid’s family obtained clearance to board \nthe flight with him.   \n438.  Mr. Abdurrashid has experienced similar enhanced screening and humiliation \nwhen traveling by air ever since 2014.  \n439.  His boarding passes for his flights are routinely stamped with the “SSSS” \ndesignation, indicating that he has been designated by Defendants as a “known or suspected \nterrorist.” \n440.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass. \n441.  Rather, Mr. Abdurrashid is directed each time to an airline representative, who \nthen contacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that \ncan take a very long time. \n91 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 92 of 268\n442.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it. \n443.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Mr. Abdurrashid to substantially similar routine, extensive and lengthy \nscreening, an invasive pat down including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of \nall his personal belongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings at \nthe TSA security checkpoint, in public view and in front of his family. \n444.  Moreover, when Mr. Abdurrashid’s family is traveling with him, they are also \ntreated as “known or suspected terrorists” just because they are traveling with him. \n445.  Mr. Abdurrashid minimizes his travel in order to avoid the humiliation and \nhassle associated with being labeled as a “known or suspected terrorist” by Defendants \nbecause of his status on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.  As a result, Mr. Abdurrashid \nand his family have missed several trips they would have gone on but for Mr. Abdurrashid’s \nstatus on Defendants’’ federal terrorist watchlist.  \n446.  For instance, in April 2018, Mr. Abdurrashid and his family were invited to his \nwife’s niece’s wedding in Washington, D.C.  However, they did not want to go through the \nhumiliation and hassle of travel.  Because the drive to Washington, D.C. from Orlando is \nthirteen hours, Mr. Abdurrashid and his family could not attend the wedding.   \n447.  On other occasions, Mr. Abdurrashid and his family have forgone skiing trips \nwith family friends and trips to see his adult children and grandchildren.   \n448.  Because  of  his  status  on  Defendants’  federal  terrorist  watchlist,  Mr. \nAbdurrashid is only able to see his grandchildren if they travel to Orlando to visit him.  If he \n92 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 93 of 268\nwas not on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist and subjected to humiliating and invasive \nenhanced screenings, he and his family would visit his adult children and grandchildren.  \n449.  Since he and his family are unable to travel unless they undergo humiliating \nand invasive public enhanced screenings, Mr. Abdurrashid’s thirteen-year-old son is not able \nto form a stronger bond with his adult brothers and sister and nieces and nephews.   \n450.  In February 2018, Mr. Abdurrashid purchased a Smith and Wesson 9mm \nfirearm.  When Mr. Abdurrashid went to pick up the firearm from the dealer in Florida, he \ncompleted  the  Florida  Department  of  Law  Enforcement  Firearm  Purchase  application \n(“FDLE Application”).   \n451.  After a three-day delay, the local gun dealer contacted Mr. Abdurrashid and \ninformed him that his FDLE Application was denied.  As a result, Mr. Abdurrashid was not \nable to complete his purchase of the Smith and Wesson firearm.  \n452.  Mr. Abdurrashid contacted FDLE and requested the reasons why FDLE denied \nhis application.  The FDLE representative informed Mr. Abdurrashid that he could not inform \nhim why his application was denied but that he would inform Mr. Abdurrashid if Mr. \nAbdurrashid was able to guess the reason for his application’s denial.  \n453.  Mr. Abdurrashid was not able to guess the reason of his application’s denial.  \nThe FDLE representative refused to divulge any information to Mr. Abdurrashid as to why \nhis application was denied.   \n454.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Abdurrashid’s FDLE Application was denied \nbecause of his status on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.  Specifically, Florida denied \nAbdurrashid his firearms purchase application because of instructions developed by the \n93 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 94 of 268\nGovernment watchlist instructing Florida to deny FDLE Applications by otherwise-eligible \ngun purchaser applicants such as Mr. Abdurrashid. \n455.  Mr. Abdurrashid has filed a DHS TRIP inquiry.  He has received a letter as \ndescribed in Paragraph 217 and was assigned a redress control number. \n456.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Abdurrashid remains on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist. \nPlaintiff Mohammad Paryavi \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n457.  On June 4, 2017, Mohammad Paryavi arrived at a Washington, D.C. area airport \nfor a flight to Houston, Texas.   \n458.  Mr. Paryavi was traveling with a co-worker for a business trip who witnessed \nthe entire treatment that Mr. Paryavi was subjected to that day, described below.   \n459.  At first, Mr. Paryavi was unable to check-in online or at the airport kiosk.  \nRather, he was directed to an airline representative for further assistance. \n460.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, Mr. \nParyavi and his coworker had to wait almost forty minutes before the airline representative \nobtained clearance from Defendants for Mr. Paryavi to board his flight. \n461.  The boarding passes of both Mr. Paryavi and his coworker were stamped with \nthe “SSSS” designation, indicating that they were both designated as “known or suspected \nterrorists.” \n462.  Once Mr. Paryavi and his coworker arrived at the TSA security checkpoint, \nthey provided their boarding passes and identification documents to the officer stationed at \nthe entrance to the TSA security checkpoint.   \n94 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 95 of 268\n463.  The boarding pass scanner indicated a red light when Mr. Paryavi’s boarding \npass was scanned.   \n464.  Mr. Paryavi and his co-worker were both escorted to a different line than the \nother travelers passing through the TSA security checkpoint and subjected to enhanced \nscreening.   \n465.  Mr. Paryavi was subjected to an extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of all his personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings in public view and \nin front of his coworker.   \n466.  Once Mr. Paryavi and his coworker finally arrived at the gate, approximately \nsix to ten TSA agents were waiting for Mr. Paryavi to arrive. \n467.  The TSA agents had a cart with chemical testing machines.   \n468.  At the gate and before being allowed to board, in public view and in front of \nhis coworker, Mr. Paryavi was once again subjected to an invasive and lengthy pat down, all \nhis personal belongings were searched again, and he and his belongings were subjected to \nanother round of chemical residue testing even though he had just cleared security with no \nissues at the TSA security checkpoint. \n469.  Then, when Mr. Paryavi scanned his boarding pass at the gate to board their \nflight, the scanner once again indicated a red light. \n470.  Mr.  Paryavi  and  his  coworker  were  once  again  delayed  until  the  airline \nrepresentative at the gate finally obtained clearance from Defendants to allow Mr. Paryavi to \nboard his flight. \n95 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 96 of 268\n471.  Mr. Paryavi felt ashamed and humiliated, especially because he was treated as \na “known or suspected terrorist” in public view and in front of his coworker and because his \ncoworker was also delayed, humiliated and subjected to extensive screening just because he \nwas traveling with Mr. Paryavi. \n472.  Ever since that trip, every time Mr. Paryavi travels by air, he is subjected to \nsubstantially similar treatment.  \n473.  His boarding passes for his flights are routinely stamped with the “SSSS” \ndesignation, indicating that he has been designated by Defendants as a “known or suspected \nterrorist.” \n474.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass. \n475.  Rather Mr. Paryavi is directed each time to an airline representative, who then \ncontacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that can \ntake a very long time. \n476.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it. \n477.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Mr. Paryavi to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive pat \ndown  including  a  search  of  his  groin  area,  an  extensive  search  of  all  of his  personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings – twice – at the TSA \nsecurity  checkpoint  and  again  at  the  gate,  in  public  view  and  in  front  of  his  travel \ncompanions. \n96 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 97 of 268\n478.  He then must wait again at the gate for an airline representative to obtain \nclearance from Defendants a second time to board his flight, even though Defendants already \nprovided clearance for him to board his flight prior to his boarding pass being printed in the \nfirst place. \n479.  Moreover, oftentimes the people that Mr. Paryavi travels with are also treated \nas “known or suspected terrorists” just because they are traveling with him. \n480.  On or about January 2018, Mr. Paryavi was re-entering the United States with \na business client, his wife and his daughter, all of whom witnessed the treatment he was \nsubjected to that day, described below. \n481.  Once his flight landed in Dulles International Airport in Virginia, there were \ntwo CBP officers waiting for him before he arrived at passport control.   \n482.  Mr. Paryavi was escorted from the gate to an interrogation room where he was \ndetained and interrogated by FBI agents about his travel and his work.  All his personal \nbelongings were also searched. \n483.  Mr.  Paryavi  applied  to  both  TSA  Pre✓ ® and  Global  Entry,  TSA  and  CBP \nprograms respectively that allow for expedited screening at ports of entry.  Both applications \nwere denied without providing any explanation. \n484.  Upon information and belief, his applications to participate in the TSA Pre✓ ® \nand Global Entry programs were denied because of, upon information and belief, his status \non the federal terrorist watchlist. \n485.  Mr. Paryavi has been interrogated by FBI agents about his Islamic religious \nbeliefs and practices and political opinions, including but not limited to, questions about \n97 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 98 of 268\nwhat mosque he belongs to, how far his mosque is, who the imam (Islamic religious leader) \nis at his mosque, and detailed questions about his political opinions about Iran. \n486.  Upon information and belief, his answers to the questions asked by the FBI \nagents were factors that contributed to his designation on the federal terrorist watchlist. \n487.  Mr. Paryavi has filed a DHS TRIP inquiry.  He has received a letter as described \nin Paragraph 217 and was assigned a redress control number. \n488.  Because of the travel issues resulting from his status on Defendants’ federal \nterrorist watchlist, Mr. Paryavi now experiences anxiety when traveling because he knows \nthat he will be subjected to the invasive and humiliating screenings described above.   \n489.  To ensure that his travel plans are not interrupted, Mr. Paryavi arrives at the \nairport four hours prior to takeoff.  \n490.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Paryavi remains on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist. \nThe Wehelie Family \nPlaintiff Hawa Wehelie \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n491.  Hawa Wehelie is part of the Wehelie Family.  She is the daughter of Mr. \nAbdirizak Wehelie and Mrs. Shamsa Hashi Noor’s and the sister of Ms. Fatima Wehelie.    \n492.  On October 22, 2017, Ms. Hawa Wehelie and her family members were re-\nentering the United States through the Peace Bridge land port of entry in New York after a \ntrip to Canada.  \n493.  After Ms. Hawa Wehelie handed her identification information to the primary \ninspection officer, her vehicle was immediately surrounded by several armed CBP officers.  \n98 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 99 of 268\nShe, along with her family members, were ordered to exit the vehicle and detained.  They \nwere instructed to leave their personal belongings in the vehicle.   \n494.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie and her family were escorted by the armed CBP officers to \nsecondary inspection.  They were also interrogated.   \n495.  CBP  confiscated  Ms.  Hawa  Wehelie’s  cell  phone  and  laptop  without  her \nconsent.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s electronics were not returned to her until approximately two \nmonths later.  Upon information and belief, Defendants downloaded and made a copy of Ms. \nHawa Wehelie’s cell phone and laptop data and information without her consent.   \n496.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie was scared for her and her family’s safety.  Ms. Hawa \nWehelie was ashamed and humiliated because of the treatment she received.  Additionally, \nshe was ashamed and humiliated that her family was treated as “known or suspected \nterrorists” because of their relation to her.  \n497.  On  January  7,  2018,  Ms.  Wehelie  and  her  sister,  Fatima  Wehelie,  were \nreturning to the United States through Pearson International Airport.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s \nboarding pass was stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that she had been \ndesignated by Defendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n498.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on her boarding pass, as protocol, the \nagents then subjected Ms. Hawa Wehelie to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an \ninvasive pat down, and an extensive search of all her personal belongings and chemical \nresidue testing of her person and his belongings in public view and in front of her sister.    \n499.  Upon information and belief, Ms. Hawa Wehelie was subjected to the above \ndescribed treatment by the Canadian authorities due to her status on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist being shared with Canadian authorities by Defendants.  \n99 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 100 of 268\n500.  After going through the security checkpoint, and before boarding the plane, \nMs. Hawa Wehelie and her sister scanned their passports at the Automated Passport Control \nkiosk.  The printed declaration form contained an “X” over Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s and Ms. F. \nWehelie’s photos.  They were instructed to go to a Customs officer.   \n501.  When Ms. Hawa Wehelie and her sister presented their declaration forms to a \nCustoms officer, they were detained and interrogated.     \n502.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie and her sister were detained in separate rooms so that CBP \nofficers could interrogate them separately.   \n503.  The interrogation rooms were situated across the hallway from small holding \ncells that look like jail cells; and, upon seeing them, Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s sister felt faint and \nlight-headed.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie feared for her sister’s safety because she was afraid that \nthey would both be arrested and detained in the holding cells.  \n504.  CBP Officer Bustamante interrogated Ms. Hawa Wehelie for approximately \none hour about whether she attended church, whether she is enrolled in religious courses, \nwhat organizations she belongs to, whether she financially supports her family members, \nwhether she has family in Somalia, where she traveled during the past 10 years, and why she \ndoes not practice as an attorney. \n505.  After the interrogation, Officer Bustamante confiscated Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s \ncell phone, and upon information and belief, downloaded the information from her cell \nphone without her consent. \n506.  The entire process lasted nearly four hours. As a result, Ms. Hawa Wehelie and \nher sister missed their flight and were forced to reschedule their flight for the next morning.  \n100 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 101 of 268\n507.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie felt ashamed and humiliated, especially because she was \ntreated as a “known or suspected terrorist” in public view and in front of her sister, and \nbecause her sister was delayed, humiliated, subjected to detention and interrogation, and \nmissed her flight because of traveling with Ms. Hawa Wehelie and because of her relation to \nMs. Hawa Wehelie.   \n508.  The next morning, Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s boarding pass, again, contained the \n“SSSS” designation, indicating that she had been designated as a “known or suspected \nterrorist.”  \n509.  As the previous day, upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on her boarding pass, \nas protocol, the agents then subjected Ms. Hawa Wehelie to routine, extensive and lengthy \nscreening, an invasive pat down, and an extensive search of all her personal belongings and \nchemical residue testing of her person and his belongings in public view and in front of her \nsister.    \n510.  Upon information and belief, Ms. Hawa Wehelie was subjected to the above \ndescribed treatment by the Canadian authorities due to her status on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist being shared with Canadian authorities by Defendants.  \n511.

Since approximately 2015, because of Mr. Mohallim’s watchlist designation, \nMr.  Mohallim  is  regularly  subjected  to  enhanced  screening,  unreasonable  delays  and \ninterrogations.    \n589.  On  or  about  2015,  Mr.  Mohallim  arrived  at  Minneapolis-Saint  Paul \nInternational Airport for an international trip to Kenya.  \n590.  He was prevented from checking in online or at the kiosk in the airport.  \nRather, he was directed to an airline representative for further assistance.   \n591.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, the \nairline representative was unable to print Mr. Mohallim’s boarding pass. \n592.  Mr. Mohallim had to wait while the airline representative called Defendants to \nobtain clearance to print his boarding pass and allow him to board his flight. \n593.  Mr. Mohallim was subjected to an extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of all his personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings in public view at \nthe TSA checkpoint.   \n111 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 112 of 268\n594.  This intensive screening caused Mr. Mohallim to experience humiliation and \nshame and otherwise stigmatize him in the eyes of his family, friends, and fellow travelers. \n595.  When he arrived at the gate, Mr. Mohallim was interrogated about his trip and \nabout how much money he was carrying before he was allowed to board his flight increasing \nthe amount of humiliation and shame he experienced and further stigmatizing him in the \neyes of his family, friends, and fellow travelers.   \n596.  On July 17, 2018, Mr. Mohallim went to Doha International Airport with his \nmother, to board a flight back to the United States.    \n597.  Upon presenting airport security with their passports, the security officer \nplaced red stickers in both Mr. Mohallim and his mother’s passports.  \n598.  When Mr. Mohallim approached the ticket agent for his boarding pass, the \nairline representative falsely told him that the plane had already finished boarding. \n599.  The airline representative took both passports and left for ten minutes. \n600.  When the airline representative returned, he told Mr. Mohallim that he and his \nmother would not be able to fly that day and directed them to ticket sales to rebook their \nflight.  \n601.  Mr. Mohallim felt humiliated and ashamed that his mother witnessed him \nbeing treated by the government as a criminal and a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n602.  Mr. Mohallim felt ashamed and humiliated that his mother felt compelled to \nremain in Kenya with him because he was unable to board his flight. \n603.  However, when Mr. Mohallim attempted to rebook his flight at the ticket sales \noffice, he was unable to do so, and he had to purchase a new plane ticket for $1,600.  \n112 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 113 of 268\n604.  On July 21, 2018, Mr. Mohallim and his mother returned to the airport for their \nflight.  \n605.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, the \nairline representative was unable to print Mr. Mohallim’s boarding pass. \n606.  The airline representative called Defendants to obtain clearance to print his \nboarding pass and allow him to board his flight. \n607.  The airline representative then informed Mr. Mohallim that he would be \nunable to board his flight to the United States and directed him to contact the embassy or \nimmigration.  \n608.  Mr. Mohallim felt humiliated and ashamed that his mother witnessed him \nbeing treated by the government as a criminal and a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n609.  Mr. Mohallim felt ashamed and humiliated that his mother felt compelled to \nremain in Doha with him because he was unable to board his flight. \n610.  On July 22, 2018, Mr. Mohallim arrived at the United States Embassy in Doha \nfor his appointment. \n611.  When the receptionist called Mr. Mohallim’s name, she stated, “They already \nknow you,” and rescheduled Mr. Mohallim’s appointment for July 24, 2018.  \n612.  On July 24, 2018, Mr. Mohallim and his mother returned to the embassy and \nwere met by two FBI agents.  \n613.  The FBI agents separated Mr. Mohallim’s mother from Mr. Mohallim and \ninterrogated them separately. \n614.  When Mr. Mohallim’s mother objected to an interrogation of her son and \nrequested to have an attorney present, the agents told her that their situation would be more \n113 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 114 of 268\ndifficult and result in an indefinite delay of their return by plane to the United States if she \ninsists on having an attorney present.  \n615.  The FBI agents told Mr. Mohallim’s mother that they would immediately \nensure her son’s successful return to the United States if she consented to an interrogation \nof her son without the presence of an attorney.  \n616.  Since  this  ordeal,  because  of  Mr.  Mohallim’s  watchlist  designation,  Mr. \nMohallim and his mother are unable to return to the United States and remain stranded \nabroad. \n617.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Mohallim was added to the No Fly List after \nhe left the United States, and accordingly he was unable to board a flight to return to his \nhome in the United States. \n618.  Because  of  his  designation  on  the  federal  watchlist,  Mr.  Mohallim  was \nsubjected to additional FBI interrogations.  \n619.  Around 2016, one of the John Doe FBI Defendants, who gave his name as “Dan,” \nattempted to interrogate Mr. Mohallim, who was 15 at the time, about who he speaks with \nand his social media accounts.  \n620.  The  John  Doe  FBI  Defendant  also  requested  permission  to  search  Mr. \nMohallim’s phone.  \n621.  Around 2015, an employee at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Kenya \ntold Mr. Mohallim that an FBI agent interrogated airport employees about Mr. Mohallim. \n622.  The agent showed airport employees a photo of Mr. Mohallim and falsely said \nthat Mr. Mohallim was attempting to join ISIS, asked for his location, and asked why he hadn’t \nleft Kenya.  \n114 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 115 of 268\n623.  On  August  3,  2018,  Mr.  Mohallim’s  counsel  contacted  and  provided \nDefendants’  counsel  with  Mr.  Mohallim’s  itinerary  and  requested  assurance  that  Mr. \nMohallim and his mother would be allowed to board their flights to the United States.  The \nU.S. Embassy in Doha, Qatar was also contacted and provided this information.   \n624.  Despite being denied boarding twice, as described above, on August 19, 2018, \nthe U.S. Embassy in Doha, Qatar sent an email to Mr. Mohallim stating, “we have no reason to \nthink you cannot fly on this itinerary….”  \n625.  Defendants’ counsel notified Mr. Mohallim’s counsel that the earliest flight he \nwould be allowed to board was for August 29, 2018.  Mr. Mohallim rebooked his and his \nmother’s flights for August 28, 2018.  A copy of Mr. Mohallim itinerary for August 29, 2018, \nwas provided to Defendants’ counsel and U.S. Embassy in Qatar via electronic mail.   \n626.  On August 29, 2018, Mr. Mohallim and his mother finally boarded their flight \nto the United States.  \n627.  When they arrived at their first connecting flight at Doha International Airport, \na Qatari airport official escorted Mr. Mohallim into a backroom where his belongings and \nperson were searched before he and his mother were allowed to board their flight.  \n628.  When Mr. Mohallim and his mother arrived at London Heathrow International \nAirport, they approached the ticketing counter to obtain their boarding passes. Despite \nreassurances from Defendants’ counsel that Mr. Mohallim would be permitted to fly back \nhome to the United States, he airline representative was still unable to print the boarding \npasses and sent Mr. Mohallim and his mother to another ticketing counter.  \n115 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 116 of 268\n629.  The second ticketing counter was closed, so Mr. Mohallim and his mother were \nrequired to wait for assistance. When an airline representative finally approached the \ncounter, the airline representative was also unable to print the boarding passes.  \n630.  Finally, an FBI agent approached the airline representative and provided \nclearance for Mr. Mohallim and his mother to board their flight. \n631.  This  entire  ordeal  lasted  approximately  3-4  hours,  nearly  causing  Mr. \nMohallim and his mother to miss their return flight to the United States.  \n632.  Upon  arrival  at  Chicago  O’Hare  International  Airport,  the  pilot  made  an \nannouncement on the loudspeaker asking all passengers to present their passports to CBP \nofficers waiting at the gate upon deplaning.  \n633.  Upon identifying Mr. Mohallim, the CBP officers announced they no longer \nneeded to see passports for the rest of the passengers.  \n634.  The CBP officers escorted Mr. Mohallim and his mother to passport control \nand into a private room where they were detained and interrogated, despite knowing that \nMr. Mohallim was represented by counsel. \n635.  Mr. Mohallim was interrogated about his time in Kenya, the names of his family \nmembers in Kenya, his mother’s business in Kenya, and where he attended school, among \nother questions.  \n636.  CBP officers also confiscated Mr. Mohallim’s mother’s cell phone, demanding \nthat his mother provide the password, which she did because she felt compelled to do so. \nCBP officers took her cell phone into a private room for approximately 30 minutes. Upon \ninformation and belief, CBP officers downloaded the information from her, without her \nconsent.  \n116 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 117 of 268\n637.  CBP officers thoroughly searched Mr. Mohallim and his mother’s belongings.  \n638.  After  they  completed  their  search,  Mr.  Mohallim  and  his  mother  were \napproached by two FBI agents who attempted to coerce Mr. Mohallim into sitting for an \ninterrogation with them. \n639.  The  FBI  agents  wanted  to  interrogate  Mr.  Mohallim  regarding  specific \nindividuals.  \n640.  Although  Mr.  Mohallim  repeatedly  told  the  FBI  agents  to  speak  to  his \nattorneys, the FBI agents continued to coerce Mr. Mohallim, stating that his current attorneys \nwere only retained to resolve his travel issues, and that his attorney’s representation did not \nextend to interrogations by the FBI.  \n641.  Mr. Mohallim and his mother were finally allowed to leave the area after he \nrepeatedly refused to answer the FBI agents’ questions.  \n642.  FBI  agents  followed  Mr.  Mohallim  and  his  mother  to  the  gate  for  Mr. \nMohallim’s connecting flight and remained seated near Mr. Mohallim and his mother until \nthey boarded.  \n643.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Mohallim remains on Defendants’ federal \nterrorist watchlist and the No Fly List.  \nPlaintiff Moustafa El-Shahat \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n644.  Sometime in 2013 or 2014, Moustafa El-Shahat arrived at John F. Kennedy \nInternational Airport (“JFK”) in Queens, New York, from an international trip to Egypt.   \n645.  Once his flight landed in JFK, there were two CBP officers waiting for him \nbefore he arrived at passport control. \n117 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 118 of 268\n646.  Mr. El-Shahat was escorted to an interrogation room where he was detained \nand interrogated by FBI agents. \n647.  All his personal belongings were searched, and his laptop, cellphone, and \ndocuments were confiscated by CBP officers. \n648.  Upon  information  and  belief,  his  documents  were  photocopied  and  the \ninformation on his electronic devices were downloaded without his consent. \n649.  Mr. El-Shahat was interrogated by the FBI agents for approximately three and \na half hours.   \n650.  He was interrogated about what he thinks of jihad9, what mosque he attends, \nhow religious he is, whether he teaches at a mosque, whether he is an imam (an Islamic \nreligious leader), among other invasive questions about his Islamic religious beliefs and \npractices. \n651.  Upon information and belief, his answers to the questions asked by the FBI \nagents were factors that contributed to his designation on the federal terrorist watchlist.  \n652.  When he was finally released, a CBP officer escorted Mr. El-Shahat out of the \nairport to ensure he left the premises.   \n653.  Ever since that trip and subsequent FBI interrogation, every time Mr. El-\nShahat travels by air, his boarding pass is routinely stamped with the “SSSS” designation, \nindicating that he has been designated by Defendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n654.  He is routinely unable to check in online or print his boarding pass. \n                                                        \n9 Jihad is an Arabic Islamic term that means “spiritual struggle.”   \n118 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 119 of 268\n655.  Rather Mr. El-Shahat is directed each time to an airline representative, who \nthen contacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that \ncan take a very long time. \n656.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it. \n657.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Mr. El-Shahat to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of all of his personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings – twice – at the TSA \nsecurity  checkpoint  and  again  at  the  gate,  in  public  view  and  in  front  of  his  travel \ncompanions. \n658.  He is also often interrogated at the gate in public view. \n659.  On one occasion, the TSA agent interrogating Mr. El-Shahat informed him that \nhe is subjected to enhanced screening because he frequently travels to countries in the \nMiddle East, because he travels alone, and because he is a Muslim male.   \n660.  On another occasion, an officer confirmed that he is designated on the federal \nterrorist watchlist. \n661.  On another occasion, while at an airport in Abu Dhabi, a TSA agent made Mr. \nEl-Shahat stand with his hands against the wall, and then kicked Mr. Al-Shahat to force his \nlegs apart, causing him pain. \n662.  The TSA agent treated Mr. El-Shahat like a criminal, likely because of his status \non the federal terrorist watchlist. \n119 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 120 of 268\n663.  Due to the above-described treatment, Mr. El-Shahat has missed at least three \nflights.   \n664.  Mr. El-Shahat avoids flying whenever possible and drives instead to avoid the \nabove-described treatment. \n665.  On or about five years ago, Mr. El-Shahat was stopped at a US-Canada port of \nentry on his way into Canada and escorted to secondary screening by two Canadian Border \nServices Officers. \n666.  He was detained and interrogated for a long time while his car and personal \nbelongings were searched. \n667.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Mr.  El-Shahat  was  subjected  to  a  lengthy \ndetention, search, and interrogation by the Canadian Border Services Officers due to his \nstatus  on  the  federal  terrorist  watchlist  being  shared  with  Canadian  authorities  by \nDefendants. \n668.  Mr. El-Shahat has filed multiple DHS TRIP inquiries.  He has received multiple \nletters as described in Paragraph 217 and was assigned multiple redress control numbers. \n669.  Further, because of his status on the federal terrorist watchlist, his wife’s \nimmigration application was significantly delayed for over three years, and as a result has \nsuffered a painful prolonged separation from his wife and loss of consortium.  Mr. El-Shahat \nalso suffered from shame and humiliation that his wife knew the reason that the processing \nof her immigration application was delayed significantly was because Defendants believe Mr. \nEl-Shahat is a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n670.  Upon information and belief, Mr. El-Shahat remains on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist.  \n120 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 121 of 268\nPlaintiff Farid Sulayman \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n671.  Imam Farid Sulayman is a local imam (Islamic religious leader)  in the Seattle, \nWashington area.  As a well-known religious leader in his area and as part of his sincerely-\nheld religious beliefs, Imam Sulayman routinely leads large groups of American Muslim \nworshippers on an annual umrah10 pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia.  \n672.  On February 24, 2018, Imam Sulayman was returning to the United States at \nthe U.S.-Canada land bordering crossing near Blaine, Washington, with his wife and four \nchildren.   \n673.  Upon presenting the primary CBP officer with his and his family’s passports, \nthe CBP officer escorted them to secondary inspection.  At this time, the CBP officer seized \nImam Sulayman’s cell phone.  Upon information and belief, Defendants made copies of the \ninformation on his cell phone without his consent.  \n674.  Imam Sulayman and his family waited in a waiting room for approximately \nthree hours before another CBP officer came to interrogate Imam Sulayman.  While waiting, \nImam Sulayman’s children began to cry, were scared, and kept asking why they could not go \nhome.   \n675.  Thereafter, Imam Sulayman was questioned by a CBP officer about his studies, \nwork, and an upcoming trip for umrah that Imam Sulayman had planned for approximately \nforty Muslim community members.  Imam Sulayman does not know how the CBP officer was \naware of his upcoming umrah trip.   \n                                                        \n10 Umrah is a pilgrimage made by Muslims to Mecca.  Unlike hajj, which is an Islamic \npilgrimage that may only be performed at specific dates according to the Islamic lunar \ncalendar, umrah may be performed at any time during the year.   \n121 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 122 of 268\n676.  After the interrogation, Imam Sulayman and his family waited another forty-\nfive minutes before being allowed to leave.  At no point was Imam Sulayman provided any \ninformation as to why he was questioned or taken to secondary inspection.   \n677.  Imam Sulayman felt ashamed and humiliated that his family witnessed him \nbeing treated by the government as a criminal and a “known or suspected terrorist.”  \n678.  Moreover, Imam Sulayman felt ashamed and humiliated that his wife and \nchildren were also treated as criminals and “known or suspected terrorists” just because \nthey were traveling with him.   \n679.  Imam Sulayman, his wife, and four children made another trip to Canada the \nfollowing  month.    Upon  presenting  the  primary  CBP  officer  with  his  passport,  Imam \nSulayman heard an alarm as the CBP officer scanned his passport.  The CBP officer then \nordered Imam Sulayman and his family to secondary inspection.   \n680.  Once  again,  Imam  Sulayman’s  cell  phone  was  confiscated,  and  upon \ninformation and belief, Defendants made copies on his cell phone without his consent.   \n681.  On or about March 31, 2018, Imam Sulayman arrived at the Seattle-Tacoma \nInternational Airport to board his flight with 28 Muslim community members to umrah in \nSaudi Arabia.  Among the 28 community members were Imam Sulayman’s elderly mother, \nsister, brother-in-law, and two aunts.   \n682.  Imam Sulayman’s travel companions and family members were able to print \ntheir boarding passes from the airport kiosk or obtained their boarding passes without \ndelay.   \n683.  However, Imam Sulayman was unable to check-in online or at the kiosk.  \nInstead, he was directed to an airline representative for further assistance.   \n122 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 123 of 268\n684.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, \nImam Sulayman was delayed until the airline representative obtained clearance for Imam \nSulayman to board his flight.  Due to the significant delay in obtaining his boarding pass, \nImam Sulayman’s travel companions and family members proceeded to the TSA checkpoint \nand cleared screening without any issues.   \n685.  His boarding pass was stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he \nwas designated as a “known or suspected terrorist.”   \n686.  Even though his family members had already cleared TSA security and were \nwaiting for him at the gate, Imam Sulayman was informed that his family members were \nbeing forced to return to the TSA security checkpoint because they were traveling with him.   \n687.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents subjected Imam Sulayman to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of all his personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings at the TSA security \ncheckpoint in public view and in front of his family members. \n688.  Imam Sulayman was detained for an hour and interrogated about his studies \nand travel itinerary in front of his family members.   \n689.  Imam  Sulayman’s  family  members  including  his  seventy-eight-year  old \nmother who is handicapped and had to be escorted around the airport in a wheel chair had \ntheir boarding passes stamped with the “SSSS” designation indicating they were designated \nas “known or suspected terrorists.”  \n690.  Imam  Sulayman’s  family  members,  including  his  seventy-eight-year-old \nmother, were subjected to the same invasive and humiliating screening as Imam Sulayman \n123 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 124 of 268\nin public view.   Imam Sulayman felt ashamed and humiliated especially because his elderly \nmother in a wheelchair was treated like a criminal in public all because of his status on \nDefendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.  Imam Sulayman’s profusely apologized to his mother \nfor the humiliation and mistreatment she experienced.   \n691.  Imam Sulayman and his travel companions only made their flight because a \nfriendly airport employee held the boarding door until the 28 community members and \nImam Sulayman arrived.   \n692.  On  April  16,  2018,  Imam  Sulayman  and  his  28  travel  companions  were \nscheduled to return to the United States by air from Saudi Arabia to Dubai to Seattle, \nWashington.   \n693.  At the airport in Saudi Arabia, the boarding passes of his family members, \nincluding Imam Sulayman’s elderly mother, were stamped with the “SSSS” designation \nindicating that they were designated as “known or suspected terrorists.”  \n694.  When Imam Sulayman approached the ticket agent for his boarding pass, the \nairline representative was not able to print his boarding pass.  An airline supervisor was \ncalled and Imam Sulayman was informed that the airline had to “call America” to figure out \nwhat was happening.   \n695.  After  a  forty-five-minute  delay,  the  airline  representatives  only  received \nclearance to print Imam Sulayman’s boarding pass from Saudi Arabia to Dubai.  Imam \nSulayman’s boarding pass was stamped with the “SSSS” designation indicating that he is a \n“known or suspected terrorist.”  \n124 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 125 of 268\n696.  Once in Dubai, Imam Sulayman was delayed another forty-five-minutes before \nthe airline representative could print his boarding pass ,which was again stamped with the \n“SSSS” designation indicating that he is a “known or suspected terrorist.”  \n697.  When  Imam  Sulayman  landed  in  Seattle,  Washington,  CBP  officers  were \nplaneside asking passengers if they were Imam Sulayman.  Once Imam Sulayman identified \nhimself to the CBP officers, he was escorted along with his elderly mother in public view and \nin front of his travel companions to an interrogation room.   \n698.  To spare his elderly mother from further humiliation, heartache, and hassle, \nImam Sulayman begged CBP officers to let his elderly mother out of secondary inspection.  \nImam Sulayman pleaded with CBP officers and informed them “I know you want me not my \nmother.”   \n699.  The CBP officers interrogated Imam Sulayman about his studies, work, and \ntravel.  The CBP officers also asked Imam Sulayman if he knew certain individuals whose \nphotographs he was shown.   \n700.  Imam Sulayman was detained and interrogated for four-and-a-half hours.   \n701.  Imam Sulayman felt powerless to assist his elderly mother during this umrah \ntrip.  He felt ashamed and began to question whether he should ever travel with his elderly \nmother so that she would no longer be subjected to the above described travel experience \nbecause of her relation to him and his status on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.   \n125 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 126 of 268\n702.  On May 19, 2018, Imam Sulayman drove family members to the Islamic Center \nof Olympia so they could break their Ramadan11 fast.  Imam Sulayman could not break fast \nwith his family because he had a fundraiser in Seattle to attend.   \n703.  Since Imam Sulayman works as an Uber driver in his spare time, he decided to \npick up an Uber fare as he drove back to Seattle.  He accepted to pick up an Uber fare from \nthe Fort Lewis military base near Tacoma, Washington.  \n704.  When  Imam  Sulayman  arrived  at  the  military  base,  the  officer  at  the \ncheckpoint informed him that he needed to register his information.  Imam Sulayman \nproceeded to the registration area and provided his license, registration and insurance \ninformation.  He asked how long this would take and was informed that it was only a five to \nten-minute process.  He decided to wait for his fare instead of cancelling.   \n705.  After twenty minutes, an officer detained and placed handcuffs on Imam \nSulayman.  Imam Sulayman has no criminal record.  He was extremely frightened and did \nnot understand why he was been apprehended.   \n706.  Imam Sulayman asked the officer why he was handcuffed and detained.  The \nofficer stated that Imam Sulayman’s name popped up when his driving information was \nbeing inputted.  \n707.  Imam Sulayman asked the officer to read what was said when his name \nappeared.  Imam Sulayman was given three reasons.  \n708.  At first, the officer stated that there was an issue related to ICE.  After Imam \nSulayman informed the officer that he was a U.S. citizen.  The officer did not respond.  \n                                                        \n11 Ramadan is the Islamic holy month when Muslims fast, without food or water, from sunrise \nto sunset.   \n126 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 127 of 268\n709.  The second explanation provided by the officer was that Imam Sulayman was \na “threat.” Imam Sulayman asked why he was being labeled a “threat.” The officer did not \nprovide an explanation.  \n710.  The third explanation provided by the officer was that there was a warrant out \nfor Imam Sulayman’s arrest.  After he asked for more information about the outside arrest \nwarrant, the officer made at least two calls to obtain more information.   \n711.  After an hour of custodial detention, Imam Sulayman was released.  During his \ndetention, Imam Sulayman asked if the handcuffs could be removed and if he could stand up.  \nHe was told that neither are allowed because of standard procedure.   \n712.  Imam Sulayman was unable to pick up his Uber fare.  His income ability was \nhindered because of his status on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.   \n713.  Upon information and belief, Imam Sulayman was custodially detained and \nhandcuffed at Fort Lewis military base because of his status on Defendants’ federal terrorist \nwatchlist.   \n714.  Muslim community members have informed Imam Sulayman that FBI agents \nhave questioned them about him.  Upon information and belief, these community members \nhave been interviewed by the FBI because of their association with Imam Sulayman and \nbecause of his status on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.  \n715.  Since  Imam  Sulayman  is  a  religious  leader  in  his  community,  he  travels \nfrequently with large groups for umrah.  Due to the difficulty, hassle, and humiliation \nassociated with his travel experiences because of his status on Defendants’ federal terrorist \nwatchlist, Imam Sulayman is afraid to travel again.  Additionally, Imam Sulayman standing \nin his community has been greatly diminished since his travel companions, as described \n127 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 128 of 268\nabove, discovered he was on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.  Imam Sulayman is also \ndiscouraged from organizing and leading Muslim community members for umrah trips \nbecause of the above described treatment, and accompanying shame, fear, and humiliation, \nthat he experiences because of his status on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.  \n716.  Upon information and belief, Imam Sulayman remains on Defendants’ federal \nterrorist watchlist.   \nPlaintiff Fadi Suliman \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n717.  On January 11, 2018, Fadi Suliman arrived at a Miami area airport for a flight \nto Las Vegas, Nevada.   \n718.  Mr. Suliman was traveling to a business convention with his employees (one \nMuslim and one non-Muslim), a customer, and a vendor, each of whom witnessed the entire \ntreatment that Mr. Suliman was subjected to that day, described below.   \n719.  At first, Mr. Suliman was prevented from checking in online and at the airport \nkiosk.  Rather, he was directed to an airline representative for further assistance.   \n720.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, Mr. \nSuliman and his travel companions had to wait almost forty minutes before the airline \nrepresentative was able to obtain clearance from Defendants so that Mr. Suliman could \nboard his flight.   \n721.  While the airline representative was on the phone, Mr. Suliman overheard the \nrepresentative state “no, he doesn’t have any weapons on him.”  The airline representative \nthen asked Mr. Suliman if any of the individuals traveling with him had any weapons.   \n722.  All the boarding passes given to Mr. Suliman and his travel companions were \nstamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that they were all designated as “known or \n128 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 129 of 268\nsuspected terrorists,” except for one.  The only travel companion that did not have an “SSSS” \ndesignation on his boarding pass was the sole non-Muslim employee traveling with Mr. \nSuliman.    All  the  tickets  were  purchased  by  Mr.  Suliman’s  company  under  the  same \nreservation.   \n723.  Once Mr. Suliman and his travel companions arrived at the TSA security \ncheckpoint, they provided their boarding passes and identification documents to the TSA \nagent stationed at the entrance of the TSA security checkpoint.   \n724.  The boarding pass scanner indicated a red light when Mr. Suliman’s boarding \npass was scanned.  The TSA agent called over a supervisor and stated, “We have a house \nguest.”  \n725.  Mr. Suliman and his travel companions that were designated “SSSS” were \nescorted to a different line than the other travelers passing through the TSA security \ncheckpoint and subjected to enhanced screening.   The  non-Muslim employee was not \nsubjected to enhanced screening and went through normal screening.  \n726.  Mr. Suliman was subjected to an extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including a search of his groin area, in addition to a TSA male agent placing his \nfingers inside and around Mr. Suliman’s waist, an extensive search of all his personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings in public view and \nin front of his travel companions.  Mr. Suliman’s Muslim travel companions received the \nsame treatment.   \n727.  Meanwhile, a TSA agent was on the phone seeking clearance to allow Mr. \nSuliman to pass the security checkpoint.   \n129 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 130 of 268\n728.  Once Mr. Suliman and his Muslim travel companions finally arrived at the gate, \napproximately five TSA agents were waiting for Mr. Suliman to arrive. \n729.  The TSA agents had with them a cart with chemical testing machines.   \n730.  At the gate and before being allowed to board, in public view and in front of \nhis travel companions, Mr. Suliman was once again subjected to an invasive and lengthy pat \ndown; all of his personal belongings were searched again; and, he and his belongings were \nsubjected to another round of chemical residue testing despite the fact that he had just \ncleared security with no issues at the TSA security checkpoint. \n731.  Due to the additional enhanced screening at the gate, Mr. Suliman missed his \ndirect flight to Las Vegas.  As a result, Mr. Suliman was forced to rebook with a connecting \nflight to Dallas Fort Worth airport in Dallas, Texas and travel separately than his travel \ncompanions.   \n732.  When Mr. Suliman arrived at Dallas to board his flight to Las Vegas, the airline \nrepresentative scanned his boarding pass at the gate to board their flight and the scanner \nonce again indicated a red light. \n733.  Mr. Suliman was once again delayed until the airline representative at the gate \nfinally obtained clearance from Defendants to allow him to board his flight.   \n734.  Additionally, Mr. Suliman had to wait at the gate until TSA agents arrived and \nsubjected Mr. Suliman to another invasive and lengthy pat down, a search of all his personal \nbelongings, and another round of chemical residue testing for himself and his belongings \nalthough he had not left the secure, sterile area of the airport and was only on a connecting \nflight.  This was once again conducted in public view.   \n130 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 131 of 268\n735.  Mr. Suliman felt ashamed and humiliated, especially because he was treated \nas a “known or suspected terrorist” in public view and in front of his employees, customer, \nand vendor, and because his Muslim travel companions were also delayed, humiliated and \nsubjected to extensive screening just because they were traveling with Mr. Suliman. \n736.  Because of all the delays, it took Mr. Suliman 15 hours to arrive in Las Vegas \nfor the convention.  Mr. Suliman’s original flight schedule was scheduled for 5 hours.   \n737.  Because of all the delays resulting from his status on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist, Mr. Suliman missed two business meetings and was forced to reschedule a meeting \nwith a Hong Kong vendor.   \n738.  Mr.  Suliman’s  employees,  customer,  and  vendor  were  shocked  at  the \ntreatment they witnessed and endured while traveling with Mr. Suliman.   \n739.  On the return flight from Las Vegas to Miami, Mr. Suliman experienced the \nsame treatment as described above.  Mr. Suliman’s Muslim travel companions were once \nagain subjected to the same treatment.  The non-Muslim employee once again did not have \nan “SSSS” stamp on his boarding pass and did not experience any enhanced screening or \ndelays.   \n740.  After  their  travel  experience,  Mr.  Suliman’s  Muslim  travel  companions \ninformed him that they would not travel with him again because of the treatment they \nsuffered when traveling with him.   \n741.  Ever since that trip, every time Mr. Suliman travels by air, he is subjected to \nsubstantially similar treatment.  \n131 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 132 of 268\n742.  His boarding passes for his flights are routinely stamped with the “SSSS” \ndesignation, indicating that he has been designated by Defendants as a “known or suspected \nterrorist.” \n743.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass. \n744.  Rather Mr. Suliman is directed each time to an airline representative, who then \ncontacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that can \ntake a very long time. \n745.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it. \n746.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Mr. Suliman to substantially similar routine, extensive and lengthy \nscreening, an invasive pat down including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of \nall of his personal belongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings \n– twice – at the TSA security checkpoint and again at the gate, in public view and in front of \nhis travel companions. \n747.  He then must wait again at the gate for an airline representative to obtain \nclearance from Defendants a second time to board his flight, even though Defendants already \nprovided clearance for him to board his flight prior to his boarding pass being printed in the \nfirst place. \n748.  Moreover, oftentimes the people that Mr. Suliman travels with are also treated \nas “known or suspected terrorists” just because they are traveling with him. \n132 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 133 of 268\n749.  On May 2018, Mr. Suliman was forced to fly to China to meet with the Hong \nKong business vendor that he was originally scheduled to meet in Las Vegas on the trip \ndescribed above.  At New York’s JFK airport to connect for his flight to China, Mr. Suliman \nwas referred to by TSA as a “house guest” again at the TSA security checkpoint.   \n750.  A TSA agent instructed Mr. Suliman to have a seat and delayed him for 40 \nminutes until an airline representative came looking for Mr. Suliman and asked if TSA was \ngoing to clear him.  At this point, TSA cleared Mr. Suliman but another female TSA agent re-\ndetained Mr. Suliman and TSA agents called yet again for clearance.   \n751.  After being cleared again, Mr. Suliman rushed to the gate only to be delayed by \nTSA for another round of clearance checks.  The TSA agent at the gate took a picture of his \nboarding pass.   \n752.  Fortunately, the captain of his flight refused to take off until Mr. Suliman \nboarded, otherwise he would have missed his flight. \n753.  Mr. Suliman’s belongings did not make it to China.   \n754.  Because of his past screening experiences, Mr. Suliman had avoided taking a \ncarry-on and therefore had no clothes to change into for two days.  To minimize the screening \ndelays and humiliation, Mr. Suliman did not take a carry-on. \n755.  On May 11, 2018, Mr. Suliman was traveling from China to Miami with a \nconnecting flight in Los Angeles International Airport.  When Mr. Suliman arrived at the \nairport in China, the airline representative received a message that stated, “Passenger not \nallowed to board before clearance.”   \n756.  Supervisors for the airline were called over and Mr. Suliman was escorted to \nan office where the airline employees called Defendants to get clearance.   \n133 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 134 of 268\n757.  The airline employees took approximately 2 hours before Defendants gave \nthem a code to input into the system, which allowed them to assign Mr. Suliman a seat.  Mr. \nSuliman arrived four hours before takeoff and still almost missed his flight.   \n758.  When Mr. Suliman landed in Los Angeles, there were five armed CBP officers \nwaiting for him planeside.  They escorted Mr. Suliman in public view to get his luggage.   \n759.  Mr. Suliman was escorted to secondary inspection where he was detained and \ninterrogated about his travel, businesses, and business partners.  During the interrogation, \nMr. Suliman commented to an African-American CBP officer “Imagine if I was a black \nMuslim.” The CBP officer responded, “Lately, most of the people that come to this room are \nfrom your background.”  \n760.  The CBP officers forced Mr. Suliman to show them photographs of his trip to \nChina, his family, and employees.   \n761.  CBP officers also seized Mr. Suliman’s smartphone.  A CBP supervisor gave Mr. \nSuliman a document informing him that his phone was being seized.  As of this date, Mr. \nSuliman has not received his phone back. \n762.  Mr. Suliman was detained for approximately 2 hours.  As a result, Mr. Suliman \nmissed his flight to Miami and was forced to spend the night at the airport.   \n763.  Mr. Suliman applied to the TSA Pre✓ ® program, but his application was \ndenied without providing any explanation. \n764.  Upon information and belief, his application to participate in the TSA Pre✓ ® \nprogram was denied because of, upon information and belief, his status on the federal \nterrorist watchlist. \n134 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 135 of 268\n765.  Mr. Suliman has filed a DHS TRIP inquiry.  He has received a letter as described \nin Paragraph 217 and was assigned a redress control number.  \n766.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Suliman remains on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist. \nPlaintiff John Doe 2 \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n767.  Since approximately 2013, every time John Doe 2 travels by air, his boarding \npass is routinely stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he has been designated \nby Defendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.”  \n768.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass. \n769.  Rather John Doe 2 is directed each time to an airline representative, who then \ncontacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that can \ntake a very long time. \n770.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it. \n771.  When John Doe 2 scans his boarding pass at the entrance to the TSA security \ncheckpoint, the scanner indicates a red light. \n772.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject John Doe 2 to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive pat \ndown including, an extensive search of all of his personal belongings and chemical residue \n135 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 136 of 268\ntesting of his person and his belongings – twice – at the TSA security checkpoint and again \nat the gate, in public view and in front of his travel companions. \n773.  Oftentimes, John Doe 2’s name is called on the loudspeaker before he is \nsubjected to interrogation at the gate in public view.  \n774.  On one occasion, DHS officers interrogated John Doe 2 about whether he was \ngoing to Syria and whether he was going to fight in the country.  \n775.  Whenever John Doe 2 arrives in the United States from international trips, two \nCBP officers check everyone’s passports as they deplane until they find him. \n776.  The two CBP officers then escort him from the gate to an interrogation room \nwhere he is detained and interrogated by FBI agents.  All his personal belongings are also \nsearched. \n777.  Additionally, whenever John Doe 2 has electronics in his possession, CBP \nofficers  confiscate  his  electronics  and  upon  information  and  belief,  download  the \ninformation from them, including his laptop and his cell phone, without his consent. \n778.  On one occasion, CBP officers seized John Doe 2’s phone and searched through \nhis photos despite his objections.  \n779.  Upon arriving in the United States from an international flight in Saudi Arabia, \nCBP officers interrogated John Doe 2 about who he married, whether his wife was Syrian, \nwhether he and his wife visited Syria, whether John Doe 2 supported the Assad regime in \nSyria, and what his thoughts were about Syrian President Assad and ISIS.   \n780.  Upon returning to the United States on a flight from Turkey, CBP officers \ninterrogated John Doe 2 about where he traveled to, where he obtained the money to travel, \nand about his job managing an Islamic center.  \n136 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 137 of 268\n781.  Further, CBP officers interrogated John Doe 2 about a prayer book they found \namong his personal belongings, the content of the book and the specific details of his Islamic \nfaith.  \n782.  On another occasion, upon returning to the United States from a trip to Turkey, \na DHS agent called John Doe 2 after he exited the airport and told him that he had been \nscheduled for additional screening and interrogation and that he needed to return to the \nairport.  \n783.  The DHS agent further told John Doe 2 that he would be detained at his next \nflight if he did not return to the airport.  \n784.  After 15 minutes, a DHS supervisor called John Doe 2 and interrogated him \nabout his trip, the purpose of his trip, and who he stayed with during his trip.  \n785.  Because  of  his  watchlist  designation,  John  Doe  2  is  often  subjected  to \ninterrogations at international airports. \n786.  On one occasion, John Doe 2 was interrogated by a CBP officer at an airport in \nthe United Arab Emirates.  \n787.  John Doe 2 was interrogated about how he paid for his trip, the current \nlocations of his family members, his place of birth, and his place of citizenship.  \n788.  Because of the interrogation, John Doe 2 missed his flight.  \n789.  After returning to the airport the next day because he missed his flight, once \nagain, the same CBP officer interrogated John Doe 2.  \n790.  John Doe 2 has filed multiple DHS TRIP inquiries.  He has received multiple \nletters as described in Paragraph 217 and was assigned multiple redress control numbers. \n137 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 138 of 268\n791.  Further, shortly after John Doe 2 was designated on the federal watchlist, he \nwas subjected to FBI interrogations at his home. \n792.  On one occasion, FBI agents interrogated John Doe 2 about where his family is \nfrom, where they currently reside, whether he knows individuals who fight in Syria, what he \nknows about groups including ISIS and an anti-ISIS journalist group, and whether he sent \nmoney to Syria. \n793.  On another occasion, FBI agent James Fobert told John Doe 2, “You’re an asset. \nWe want to get information from you that can prevent people from joining ISIS.” \n794.  FBI agents offered to pay John Doe 2 in exchange for John Doe 2 agreeing to \nact as an informant.  \n795.  FBI agents told John Doe 2 that he would be taken off the watchlist if he agreed \nto act as an informant for the FBI.   \n796.  In order to act as an Informant for the FBI, John Doe 2 would have to associate \nwith members of his religious community under false pretenses, and lie to those members, \nincluding religious leaders.  \n797.  Engaging the religious community under false pretenses and lying to members \nof  his  religious  community,  including  religious  leaders,  goes  against  the  John  Doe  2’s \nreligious beliefs and interferes with his ability to practice his religion. \n798.  Upon information and belief, John Doe 2 remains on Defendants’ federal \nterrorist watchlist.   \nPlaintiff Baby Doe \n(A Family Member of a Watchlisted Individual) \n799.  Baby Doe is a 1-year-old toddler. \n138 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 139 of 268\n800.  He was four or five-months-old when his boarding pass was first stamped with \nthe  “SSSS”  designation,  indicating  that  he  was  designated  as  a  “known  or  suspected \nterrorist.”  \n801.  While passing through airport security, he was subjected to extensive searches \nand pat downs.  \n802.  Defendants subjected Baby Doe to chemical residue testing of is person and \nhis personal belongings were searched thoroughly, including his diapers and his diaper bag.   \n803.  Upon information and belief, Baby Doe received the “SSSS” designation and \nenhanced screening because of his relationship to his father, who is also on the federal \nterrorist watchlist.  \nPlaintiffs Child Doe and Child Doe 2 \n(Family Members of a Watchlisted Individual) \n804.  Because of Father Doe’s watchlist designation and treatment while traveling, \nwhen Child Doe (age 7) and Child Doe 2 (age 8) travel with him, they are regularly subjected \nto enhanced screening, which includes TSA agents pulling them aside and searching their \npersonal belongings. \n805.  Because of Father Doe’s watchlist designation and treatment while traveling, \nChild Doe and Child Doe 2, and their family travel separately from Father Doe to avoid similar \ntreatment.  \n806.  In early 2016, Child Doe and Child Doe 2 traveled separately from their father \nto avoid the travel delays and humiliation resulting from their father’s watchlist designation.  \n807.  After they went through security, a TSA agent discovered their relationship to \nFather Doe and asked him, “Are they with you?” When Father Doe confirmed the relation, \nChild Doe and Child Doe 2 were forced to go through the security checkpoint again.  \n139 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 140 of 268\n808.  When TSA agents attempted to force Child Doe to go through the metal \ndetector, Child Doe was four-years-old at the time, he began to sob uncontrollably and clung \nto his father’s leg.  His personal belongings were searched. \n809.  TSA agents also forced Child Doe 2 to go through the metal detector and they \nsearched her personal belongings.  They also subjected her to chemical residue testing.  Child \nDoe 2, who was only six-years-old at the time, also began to sob.  \nPlaintiff Hashem Nader Sehwail \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n810.  Hashem Nader Sehwail is a United States citizen who lives in Florida.  \n811.  Last year, Mr. Sehwail left the United States to visit and spend time with his \nfamily in Palestine. \n812.  On January 21, 2018, Mr. Sehwail appeared at Istanbul Atatürk Airport, in \norder to board his flight back home to the United States. \n813.  Mr. Sehwail had previously purchased a plane ticket for a Turkish Airlines \nflight from Istanbul, Turkey to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and on to \nMiami International Airport in Florida. \n814.  Mr. Sehwail presented himself at the Turkish Airlines counter with plenty of \ntime prior to his flight, when a Turkish Airlines representative informed Mr. Sehwail that he \nwas no longer allowed to board his flight.  \n815.  In response to an inquiry as to why he was being denied boarding, the Turkish \nAirlines representative directed Mr. Sehwail to the U.S. Embassy to obtain information as to \nwhy he is no longer permitted to board a flight back to his home in the United States.  \n140 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 141 of 268\n816.  Mr.  Sehwail  requested  information  from  the  United  States  Embassy  in \nIstanbul, Turkey regarding why he was denied boarding and being prevented from returning \nto his home in the United States.  \n817.  However, the United States Embassy informed Mr. Sehwail that they had no \ninformation regarding why he was being denied boarding.   \n818.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Sehwail was added to the No Fly List after he \nleft the United States, and accordingly he was unable to board a flight to return to his home \nin the United States. \n819.  Mr. Sehwail filed a federal lawsuit in the Middle District of Florida on January \n25, 2018.  The Florida judge subsequently transferred the case to the Eastern District of \nVirginia. \n820.  On January 30, 2018, counsel for Mr. Sehwail provided counsel at the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice a copy of the initial complaint and Mr. Sehwail’s itinerary for his \nFebruary 5, 2018 flight.     \n821.  On February 2, 2018,  counsel at the U.S. Department of Justice e-mailed \nPlaintiff’s counsel stating that Plaintiff’s flight was booked on a codeshare flight operated by \na foreign carrier.  According to the U.S. DOJ, Plaintiff’s flight must not be a codeshare flight \noperated by a foreign carrier.   \n822.  Mr. Sehwail did not receive any such correspondence from the U.S. Embassy \nprior to booking his February 5, 2018 flight back to the U.S.  \n823.  Notably, Mr. Sehwail could not find a flight out of Jordan that is not a codeshare \nflight operated by a foreign carrier.  Mr. Sehwail had no other means of leaving Jordan to \nreturn to his home in Florida.   \n141 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 142 of 268\n824.  On February 5, 2018, Mr. Sehwail attempted to return to the United States for \na second time.  Mr. Sehwail was scheduled to fly from Jordan to Jacksonville International \nAirport.   \n825.  When Mr. Sehwail arrived at the airport in Jordan to board his flight, he was \nonce again denied boarding.  \n826.  Mr. Sehwail had already spent significant sums on cancellation and rebooking \nfees caused by Defendants refusal to allow him to board a flight to his country of citizenship.   \n827.  Mr. Sehwail made a third attempt to return to the United States and rebooked \nhis flight from Amman, Jordan to Frankfurt, Germany, to New York, New York, to Jacksonville, \nFlorida on February 12, 2018.  \n828.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, Mr. \nSehwail had to wait while the airline representative obtained clearance from the Department \nof Homeland Security for Mr. Sehwail to board his flight. \n829.  The airline representative was unable to print his boarding passes to the \nUnited States. Mr. Sehwail only received a boarding pass to Frankfurt and was told to obtain \nhis boarding pass to the United States in Frankfurt, Germany.  \n830.  When Mr. Sehwail arrived in Frankfurt, he presented himself to the airline \nrepresentative at the ticket counter and had to wait once again for the airline representative \nto obtain clearance from the Department of Homeland Security so that Mr. Sehwail could \nboard his flight. \n831.  Upon providing Mr. Sehwail his boarding pass, the airline representative drew \na colored mark on the boarding pass.  \n142 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 143 of 268\n832.  When Mr. Sehwail arrived at Newark Liberty International Airport, he was met \nby two CBP officers at the gate who asked to look at his passport. The officers did not ask to \nlook at any other passengers’ passports. \n833.  The CBP officers escorted him to passport control. \n834.  Upon arriving at passport control, Mr. Sehwail was met by two more CBP \nofficers who escorted him to a room for interrogation.  \n835.  The CBP officers interrogated Mr. Sehwail about where his family was, what \nhe does for a living, and where he was traveling to. \n836.  The  CBP  officers  searched  through  Mr.  Sehwail’s  cell  phone,  and  upon \ninformation and belief, downloaded the data from it without his consent. \n837.  When Mr. Sehwail arrived at the gate to board his flight to Jacksonville, he was \nsubjected to an additional search in public view even though he had already cleared security. \n838.  When Mr. Sehwail arrived in Jacksonville, he purchased a plane ticket to Fort \nLauderdale.  \n839.  Upon presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, Mr. \nSehwail was told that he would not be allowed to board his flight.  \n840.  Mr. Sehwail was forced to drive from Jacksonville to Fort Lauderdale, which \nadded an additional five hours to his return trip to his home in the United States. \n841.  On August 14, 2018, Mr. Sehwail voluntarily dismissed his Eastern District of \nVirginia case without prejudice, in order to join this action. \n842.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Sehwail remains on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist. \n143 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 144 of 268\nPlaintiff Mohamad Albadawi \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n843.  Since approximately 2013, every time Mohamad Albadawi travels by air, his \nboarding pass is routinely stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he has been \ndesignated by Defendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.”  \n844.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass. \n845.  Rather Mr. Albadawi is directed each time to an airline representative, who \nthen contacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that \ncan take a very long time. \n846.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it. \n847.  When Mr. Albadawi scans his boarding pass at the entrance to the TSA security \ncheckpoint, the scanner indicates a red light. \n848.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Mr. Albadawi to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive pat \ndown  including  a  search  of  his  groin  area,  an  extensive  search  of  all  of his  personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings – twice – at the TSA \nsecurity  checkpoint  and  again  at  the  gate,  in  public  view  and  in  front  of  his  travel \ncompanions. \n144 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 145 of 268\n849.  At the gate, the second search described above is conducted by a minimum of \neight to twelve TSA agents, including a TSA supervisor after he scans his boarding pass to \nboard his flight. \n850.  Because of the treatment described above, Mr. Albadawi stopped traveling \nwith carry-on luggage. \n851.  Oftentimes, Mr. Albadawi’s name is called on the loudspeaker before he is \nsubjected to the second search at the gate. \n852.  Moreover, oftentimes the people that Mr. Albadawi travels with are also \ntreated as “known or suspected terrorists” just because they are traveling with him. \n853.  In 2013, upon arriving at an international airport in the United Arab Emirates, \nthe airline representative at the ticketing counter was unable to print his ticket and told Mr. \nAlbadawi that they needed to contact the United States government to obtain clearance for \nhim to board his flight back to his home in the United States. \n854.  The airline representative contacted Defendants, and after a delay, obtained \nclearance for Mr. Albadawi to board his flights to the United States and printed his boarding \npass. \n855.  Mr. Albadawi was then interrogated, upon information and belief, by CBP \nofficers in public view before he was allowed to board his flight. \n856.  Mr. Albadawi was subjected to similar treatment in connection with other \ninternational flights returning to the United States, including from the United Arab Emirates \nand Germany. \n857.  Because of the above-described treatment, Mr. Albadawi has missed several \ndomestic and international flights. \n145 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 146 of 268\n858.  For example, on July 31, 2018, Mr. Albadawi was returning to the United States \nfrom a trip to Turkey.  When Mr. Albadawi arrived at the ticket counter to check in for his \nconnecting flight to Amsterdam, Netherlands, the airline representative was unable to print \nhis boarding pass.  The airline representative contacted Defendants for clearance to allow \nMr. Albadawi to board his flight.  Mr. Albadawi waited for more than an hour and missed his \nflight because the airline representative could not get clearance from Defendants to board in \ntime.   \n859.  Eventually, Mr. Albadawi was rebooked on another flight and was allowed to \nboard a flight to Amsterdam. \n860.  However, when Mr. Albadawi arrived at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, he \npresented himself at the ticket counter for his boarding pass.  The airline representative \ncalled Defendants to obtain clearance but once again due to the delay, Mr. Albadawi missed \nhis flight to the United States.  \n861.  After  Mr.  Albadawi  rebooked  his  flight  to  the  United  States,  the  airline \nrepresentative once again contacted Defendants, and after another lengthy delay, obtained \nclearance for Mr. Albadawi to board his flight to the United States. The boarding pass was \nstamped with the “SSSS” designation indicating that Defendants have labeled him a “known \nor suspected terrorist.” \n862.  When  Mr.  Albadawi  arrived  at  Hartsfield-Jackson  Atlanta  International \nAirport, he went to an Automated Passport Control kiosk at customs. His declaration form \nhad an “X” printed on it with instructions to go to a customs agent.  Mr. Albadawi noticed a \nCBP officer looking at him.  Mr. Albadawi approached the CBP officer and asked if he was \nwaiting for him.  The CBP officer laughed and responded, “how did you know?”  \n146 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 147 of 268\n863.  Mr. Albadawi waited two hours for CBP to provide an approval code for him.  \nBecause of the delay, Mr. Albadawi missed his flight to Chicago.   \n864.  After  rebooking,  Mr.  Albadawi  went  to  a  TSA  security  checkpoint  and \nexperienced substantially similar enhanced screening experience as described above.   \n865.  When Mr. Albadawi finally arrived at the gate to board his rebooked flight, Mr. \nAlbadawi was told he could not board because he did not have approval and as a result, Mr. \nAlbadawi was forced to return to the TSA security checkpoint, go through the same invasive \nscreening and clearance he had just completed, and obtain approval to board his flight again.  \n866.  Once again, Mr. Albadawi missed his flight and he had to rebook his flight.  \n867.  When Mr. Albadawi finally arrived at the gate to board his flight, there were \nseveral TSA agents with chemical testing machines.  Mr. Albadawi was once again subjected \nto enhanced and invasive screening as described above in public view. \n868.  Because of his status on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist, Mr. Albadawi \nmissed four flights in the same trip and it took approximately 43 hours to return to the \nUnited States.  \n869.  Whenever Mr. Albadawi arrives in the United States from international trips, \ntwo CBP officers check everyone’s passports as they deplane until they identify him. \n870.  The two CBP officers then escort him from the gate to an interrogation room \nwhere he is detained and interrogated by FBI agents.  All his personal belongings are also \nsearched. \n871.  Additionally, whenever Mr. Albadawi has electronics in his possession, CBP \nofficers  confiscate  his  electronics  and  upon  information  and  belief,  download  the \ninformation from them, including his laptop and his cell phone, without his consent. \n147 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 148 of 268\n872.  As a result, Mr. Albadawi has stopped carrying his laptop when he travels. \n873.  Upon returning from an international flight from Turkey, Mr. Albadawi was \ninterrogated by FBI agents about Muslim religious leaders that he invited to participate in a \nconvention that he organized. \n874.  During many of the trips that Mr. Albadawi traveled with his wife, daughter, \nfriends and colleagues, they were subjected to substantially similar treatment as him. \n875.  Approximately one year ago, when Mr. Albadawi and his daughter had a \nconnecting flight in South Carolina and attempted to go to their connecting gate, they were \ntold they were both told to go through the TSA security checkpoint again before being \nallowed to board their flight.  \n876.  Additionally, if Mr. Albadawi purchases flight tickets for colleagues, those \ncolleagues are also subjected to substantially similar treatment as him and interrogated \nabout him, which has caused him to suffer from shame and embarrassment. \n877.  Approximately two years ago, when Mr. Albadawi’s daughter and her husband \nreturned from a  trip to Mexico and arrived  at customs,  Mr. Albadawi’s daughter was \ninterrogated about whether her father was Mohammad Albadawi, how often she visits him, \nhow far his home is from hers, and about the conversations they have with one another.  \n878.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Albadawi’s family and travel companions are \nsubjected to the above described treatment because of their relation to him and because of \nhis status on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.   \n879.  Mr. Albadawi has filed multiple DHS TRIP inquiries.  He has received multiple \nletters as described in Paragraph 217 and was assigned multiple redress control numbers. \n148 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 149 of 268\n880.  Further, shortly after Mr. Albadawi was designated on the federal watchlist, \nhis personal bank account he had open for 18 years was suddenly closed without notice or \nexplanation of the reasons why it was closed. \n881.  Upon information and belief, Defendants disseminated the stigmatizing label \nof “known or suspected terrorist” attached to Mr. Albadawi to his bank, and as a result, his \nbank account was closed without notice. \n882.  Because  of  the  above  described  treatment,  Mr.  Albadawi  is  routinely \nhumiliated in public and in front of his family, discouraged from flying, and stigmatized as a \ncriminal because of his status on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.   \n883.  In August 2018, Mr. Albadawi arrived at Kansas City International Airport for \na flight to Chicago where he planned to attend his daughter’s wedding. \n884.  Approximately 25-30 people on Mr. Albadawi’s flight were guests attending \nhis daughter’s wedding.  \n885.  Mr. Albadawi was unable to check in for his flight online or print his boarding \npass and was directed to an airline representative, who then contacted Defendants to obtain \nclearance to allow him to board his flight. His boarding pass was stamped with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it.  \n886.  Mr. Albadawi’s son, who booked his flight separately, also received a boarding \npass with the “SSSS” designation on it, indicating that he was designated as a “known or \nsuspected terrorist.” Mr. Albadawi’s son was subjected to the same treatment as his father.  \n887.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Mr.  Albadawi’s  son  received  the  “SSSS” \ndesignation on his boarding pass due to his relationship with his father and because he was \ntraveling with his father. \n149 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 150 of 268\n888.  When Mr. Albadawi and his son scanned their boarding passes at the entrance \nto the TSA security checkpoint, the scanner indicated a red light for each, and, as protocol, \nTSA agents then subjected Mr. Albadawi and his son to routine, extensive and lengthy \nscreenings, an invasive pat down including a search of their groin area, an extensive search \nof all of their personal belongings and chemical residue testing of their person and their \nbelongings – twice – at the TSA security checkpoint and again at the gate, in public view and \nin front of their travel companions. \n889.  When Mr. Albadawi’s travel companions arrived at the gate, approximately ten \nwedding guests were randomly selected for an additional search at the gate and in public \nview, despite having cleared the TSA security checkpoint with no issues. \n890.  The wedding guests were subjected to an extensive search of all their personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of their person and belongings.  \n891.  Since  this  incident,  to  avoid  enhanced  screening  and  humiliation  by \nDefendants, many of his family members and his friends have arranged to fly on separate \nflights from Mr. Albadawi. \n892.  Mr. Albadawi felt ashamed and humiliated in front of his friends and family \nbecause they were treated as “known or suspected terrorists” because of their relationship \nor association with him, and because they were traveling with him. \n893.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Albadawi remains on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist. \nPlaintiffs Hicham Hall and Faatimah Knight \n(Watchlisted Plaintiffs) \n894.  Hicham Hall and Faatimah Knight are husband and wife. \n150 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 151 of 268\n895.  Since approximately 2014, every time Mr. Hall travels by air, his boarding pass \nis routinely stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he has been designated by \nDefendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.”  \n896.  Since early 2018, after Mrs. Knight married Mr. Hall, every time Mrs. Knight \ntravels by air, her boarding pass is routinely stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating \nthat she has been designated by Defendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.” Upon \ninformation and belief, Mrs. Knight is subjected to the treatment described above and was \nadded to Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist because of her association and relations to \nher husband, Mr. Hall.   \n897.  The Hall Family is routinely unable to check in for their flights online or print \ntheir boarding passes at the airport kiosk. \n898.  Instead, the Hall Family is directed each time to an airline representative, who \nthen contacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow them to board their flight, a process \nthat can take a very long time. \n899.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nthem to board their flight, the airline representative prints their boarding passes with the \n“SSSS” designation on it. \n900.  When the Hall Family scans their boarding passes at the entrance to the TSA \nsecurity checkpoint, the scanner indicates a red light. \n901.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on their  boarding passes, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject the Hall Family to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including a search of their  groin area, an extensive search of all of their personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of their person and their belongings – twice – at the \n151 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 152 of 268\nTSA security checkpoint and again at the gate, in public view and in front of their travel \ncompanions. \n902.  Often, whenever the Hall Family arrives in the United States from international \ntrips, two CBP officers check everyone’s passports as they deplane until they identify them. \n903.  The two CBP officers then escort them from the gate to an interrogation room \nwhere they are detained and interrogated by FBI agents.  All their personal belongings are \nalso searched. \n904.  Sometimes,  whenever  the  Hall  Family  arrives  in  the  United  States  from \ninternational trips, upon scanning their passports in an Automated Passport Control kiosk \nat customs, their declaration forms have an “X” printed on them with instructions to go to a \ncustoms agent.  \n905.  Additionally, whenever the Hall Family has electronics in their possession, \nCBP officers confiscate their electronics and upon information and belief, download the \ninformation from them, including their laptop and their cell phone, without their consent. \n906.  In 2014, upon arriving at an international airport in Morocco, the airline \nrepresentative at the ticketing counter was unable to print his boarding pass and told Mr. \nHall that they needed to contact the United States government to obtain clearance for him to \nboard his flight back to his home in the United States. \n907.  The airline representative contacted Defendants, and after a delay, obtained \nclearance for Mr. Hall to board his flights to the United States and printed his boarding pass. \n908.  However, due to the delay, Mr. Hall missed his flight and had to spend a \nsignificant sum of money to rebook his flight.  \n152 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 153 of 268\n909.  Upon arrival at John F. Kennedy International Airport, the pilot made an \nannouncement on the loudspeaker asking all passengers to present their passports to the \ntwo officers waiting at the gate upon deplaning.  \n910.  Upon identifying Mr. Hall, the officers announced that “We got him.” This \noccurred in public view and Mr. Hall was humiliated because he was being treated like a \ncriminal in front of the rest of the passengers. \n911.  The CBP officers escorted Mr. Hall to passport control and into a private room \nwhere he was detained and interrogated. \n912.  Mr. Hall was interrogated about the location and purpose of his trip, why he \nchose to study Arabic in Morocco, and who he studied with.  \n913.  CBP officers made copies of Mr. Hall’s Arabic language books.  \n914.  CBP officers also confiscated Mr. Hall’s cell phone and laptop and took them \ninto a private room. Upon information and belief, CPB officers downloaded the information \nfrom him, without his consent.  \n915.  On August 4, 2018, the Hall Family arrived at Washington Dulles International \nAirport for an international trip to Morocco.  \n916.  The Hall Family was not able to check-in online or at the passport kiosk. \nInstead, they were directed to an airline representative for further assistance. \n917.  At the ticket counter, after a 30-to-40-minute delay, and after the airline \nrepresentative obtained clearance from Defendants, the Hall Family received their boarding \npasses. Mr. Hall’s boarding pass was stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he \nis designated as a “known or suspected” terrorist. \n153 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 154 of 268\n918.  Mrs. Knight’s boarding pass was also stamped with the “SSSS” designation, \nindicating that she is designated as a “known or suspected” terrorist.  \n919.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Hall received a boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation because he was traveling with Mrs. Knight. \n920.  Upon information and belief, Mrs. Knight received a boarding pass with the \n“SSSS” designation because she was traveling with Mr. Hall.  \n921.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on their boarding passes, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subjected the Hall family to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down, an extensive search of all their personal belongings and chemical residue testing \nof their persons and belongings at the TSA security checkpoint, and in public view.  \n922.  When the Hall Family finally arrived at the gate, several TSA agents were \nwaiting for them to arrive. The TSA agents had with them a cart with chemical testing \nmachines.   \n923.  At the gate and before being allowed to board, in public view, the Hall Family \nwas once again subjected to an invasive and lengthy pat down, all their personal belongings \nwere searched again, and they and their belongings were subjected to another round of \nchemical residue testing even though they had just cleared security with no issues at the TSA \nsecurity checkpoint. \n924.  Moreover, TSA agents took photographs of the Hall Family before they were \nallowed to board their plane.  \n925.  The Hall Family was mortified that they were treated like criminals in front of \nthe same passengers that they were going to board the flight with.   \n154 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 155 of 268\n926.  Mr. Hall was also ashamed and embarrassed that his wife was subjected to \nhumiliating treatment because of her traveling with him.   \n927.  Mrs. Knight was ashamed and embarrassed that her husband was subjected to \nhumiliating treatment because of traveling with her.  \n928.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Hall and travel companions are subjected to \nthe above described treatment because of their relation and association with him, because \nthey travel with him, and because of his status on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.   \n929.  Upon information and belief, Mrs. Knight and travel companions are subjected \nto the above described treatment because of their relation and association with her, because \nthey travel with her, and because of her status on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.   \n930.  Mr. Hall is ashamed and humiliated that his wife witnesses him being treated \nby Defendants as a criminal and a “known or suspected terrorist.” Moreover, Mr. Hall is \nashamed and humiliated that his travel companions are routinely made to suffer just because \nthey are traveling with him.   \n931.  Mrs. Knight is ashamed and humiliated that her husband witnesses her being \ntreated by Defendants as a criminal and a “known or suspected terrorist.” Moreover, Mrs. \nKnight is ashamed and humiliated that her travel companions are routinely made to suffer \njust because they are traveling with her.   \n932.  Because  of  the  above  described  treatment,  the  Hall  Family  is  routinely \nhumiliated in public and in front of their family, discouraged from flying, and stigmatized as \na criminal because of their status on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.   \n933.  The Hall Family is routinely subjected to FBI interrogations because of their \nwatchlist status.  \n155 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 156 of 268\n934.  In 2016, the Hall Family returned from an international trip to Germany when \nCBP officers escorted them from the gate to an interrogation room where FBI agents were \nwaiting to interrogate them. \n935.  FBI agents told Mr. Hall they would resolve his travel issues and remove him \nfrom the “list” if he agreed to become an informant.  \n936.   In order to act as an Informant for the FBI, Hall would have to associate with \nmembers of his religious community under false pretenses, and lie to those members, \nincluding religious leaders. \n937.  Engaging the religious community under false pretenses and lying to members \nof  his  religious  community,  including  religious  leaders,  goes  against  the  John  Doe  2’s \nreligious beliefs and interferes with his ability to practice his religion. \n938.  In January of 2017, the Hall Family arrived at Washington Dulles International \nAirport on their way back from an international trip from Tunisia.  \n939.  When the Hall Family went through customs and inserted their passports at \nthe kiosk, the kiosk displayed a red “X” and they were instructed to proceed to a CBP officer \nfor further processing.  \n940.  CBP officers escorted the Hall Family to secondary inspection where they were \ntaken to a private room for interrogation. \n941.  Mrs. Knight was interrogated about the purpose of her trip, the length of their \ntrip, what she and her husband studied in Tunisia, why she chose to study Arabic in Tunisia, \nwhat she was studying regarding religion, and how she and her husband spend their days in \nthe United States. \n156 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 157 of 268\n942.  Mrs. Knight was then escorted to a waiting area while FBI agents interrogated \nMr. Hall for almost one hour.  \n943.  Because of electronic searches caused by the Hall Family’s watchlist status, Mr. \nHall’s laptop was destroyed.  \n944.  In January or February 2015, Mr. Hall was returning from an international trip \nto Morocco.  CBP Officers escorted Mr. Hall to an interrogation room.   \n945.  CBP officers seized Mr. Hall’s laptop and took it into a separate room.  And \nupon information and belief, Defendants searched and copied the data and contents of his \nlaptop.   \n946.  Because of tampering with his laptop, Defendants corrupted his laptop and Mr. \nHall was forced to purchase a new laptop.   \n947.  As a result, Mr. Hall has stopped carrying his laptop when he travels. \n948.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Mr.  Hall  remains  on  the  federal  terrorist \nwatchlist. \n949.  Upon information and belief, Mrs. Knight remains on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist.  \nPlaintiff Khalil Thadi \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n950.  In March 2017, Khalil Thadi arrived at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall to \nprovide a carpet estimate at the request of a contractor.  \n951.  Mr.  Thadi  completed  the  appropriate  form  to  go  inside  the  base.  After \nsubmitting the form, security officers pulled Mr. Thadi aside  for  questioning.  Security \ninstructed Mr. Thadi to get out of his car.  \n157 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 158 of 268\n952.  Mr. Thadi was questioned about the purpose of his visit. He and his car were \nalso photographed.  This process lasted for 45 minutes. Mr. Thadi was ultimately denied \nentry to the base. \n953.   Upon information and belief, Mr. Thadi was denied entry to Joint Base Myer-\nHenderson Hall because of his status on the watchlist.  Thus, Mr. Thadi was unable to provide \na carpet estimate to the contractor; thus, he was not awarded a subcontract and lost out on \nan important business opportunity.   \n954.  Since 2004, every time Mr. Thadi travels he is subjected to substantially \nsimilar treatment.  His boarding passes for his flights are routinely stamped with the “SSSS” \ndesignation, indicating that he has been designated by Defendants as a “known or suspected \nterrorist.”  \n955.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass.  \n956.  Instead, Mr. Thadi is directed each time to an airline representative, who then \ncontacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that can \ntake a very long time. Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants \nallowing him to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the \n“SSSS” designation on it. \n957.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Mr. Thadi to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive pat \ndown including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of all his personal belongings \nand chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings at the TSA security checkpoint \nin public view. \n158 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 159 of 268\n958.  Whenever Mr. Thadi returns from an international flight into the United \nStates, he also experiences substantially similar mistreatment each time.   \n959.  Whenever Mr. Thadi arrives in the United States, he is routinely escorted to \nsecondary inspection where he is detained and subjected to lengthy interrogations by CBP \nofficers.  \n960.  The CBP officers search his luggage and seize and search his electronics.  Upon \ninformation and belief, Defendants downloaded and made copies of the information on his \nelectronic devices without his consent.  \n961.  Because of the above-described screening experiences, Mr. Thadi has missed \nmultiple flights.  \n962.  Since 2004, the FBI have repeatedly interrogated Mr. Thadi at his home about \na variety of issues including: the purpose of his trips to Morocco, when and where he and his \nfamily went, and whether individuals coerced Mr. Thadi’s family to leave the United States. \nAgents have also interrogated Mr. Thadi about specific individuals.  \n963.  Mr. Thadi has twice been subjected to irregularly long traffic stops. When Mr. \nThadi is pulled over by police, he is told that his name matches with a name within a list \naccessed by officers and is detained for long periods of time.  Upon information and belief, \nMr. Thadi’s long traffic stops occurred because of his status on Defendants’ federal terrorist \nwatchlist.   \n964.  Mr. Thadi has filed a DHS TRIP inquiry.  On March 13, 2018, Mr. Thadi received \na letter as described in Paragraph 217 and was assigned a redress control number.  \n965.  Because of being placed on the federal terrorist watchlist, Mr. Thadi has been \ndiscouraged from traveling in order to avoid the lengthy delays, enhanced screening and \n159 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 160 of 268\ninterrogations by Defendants and the humiliation and stigma associated with the above \ndescribed screening experiences.  \n966.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Mr.  Thadi  remains  on  the  federal  terrorist \nwatchlist. \nPlaintiff Esmaeel Paryavi \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n967.  Esmaeel Paryavi is the son of Mohammad Paryavi.  Upon information and \nbelief, Defendants have placed Mr. E. Paryavi on the federal terrorist watchlist because of his \nrelation to Mohammad Paryavi.   \n968.  On April 22, 2018, Mr. E. Paryavi was departing El Dorado International \nAirport in Bogota, Columbia, on his way back from an international trip to Columbia with \nfriends.  \n969.  He was prevented from checking in online or at the kiosk in the airport.  \nRather, he was directed to an airline representative for further assistance.   \n970.  The airline representative called Defendants in order to obtain clearance to \nprint his boarding pass and allow him to board his flight. \n971.  After  having  passed  through  the  security  checkpoint  without  incident, \nColumbian agents pulled Mr. E. Paryavi aside before he was told that he had been randomly \nselected for additional screening.  In public view and in front of his friends, Mr. E. Paryavi \nwas subjected to a pat down and a search of his personal belongings.   \n972.  Mr. E. Paryavi was a Global Entry Holder. Once he arrived at customs at \nDallas/Fort Worth International Airport, he scanned his fingerprints at a kiosk. He received \na receipt marked with an X.   \n160 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 161 of 268\n973.  Mr. E. Paryavi presented the receipt to a CBP officer, who explained that he \nhad been randomly selected for secondary screening.  Mr. E. Paryavi was escorted to a back \nwaiting area where he was met by two other CBP officers who escorted him to another room.  \n974.  Mr. E. Paryavi’s personal belongings were searched. The CBP officers required \nhim to count the money in his wallet. They searched through photos in Mr. E. Paryavi’s cell \nphone and made note of the model number and specifications of the phone.  \n975.   The  CBP  officers  required  Mr.  E.  Paryavi  to  fill  out  a  worksheet  with \ninformation about his place of residence, his place of work, his date of birth, and other \ninformation. \n976.  A CBP officer also required Mr. E. Paryavi to provide contact information for \nhis roommates, the friends he traveled with to Columbia, and immediate family members. \nHe was also required to provide the nationality, current place of residence, and date of birth \nfor all immediate family members.  \n977.  Mr. E. Paryavi was interrogated for approximately one hour.  \n978.  Five days later, Mr. E. Paryavi received an email explaining that his Global \nEntry had been revoked.  \n979.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Mr.  E.  Paryavi’s  Global  Entry  was  revoked \nbecause of his status on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.   \n980.  Moreover, upon information and belief, Mr. E. Paryavi’s TSA Pre✓ ® status has \nalso been revoked, because his boarding passes no longer contain the words, “TSA Precheck.” \n981.  Upon information and belief, Mr. E. Paryavi’s TSA Pre✓ ® was revoked because \nof his status on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.   \n161 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 162 of 268\n982.  Ever since that trip, when Mr. E. Paryavi travels by air, his boarding pass is \nroutinely stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he has been designated by \nDefendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.”  \n983.  He is routinely unable to check in online or print his boarding pass.  \n984.  Rather, Mr. E. Paryavi is routinely directed to an airline representative, who \nthen contacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that \ncan take a very long time.  \n985.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it.  \n986.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Mr. E. Paryavi to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down, an extensive search of all his personal belongings and chemical residue testing of \nhis person and his belongings at the TSA security checkpoint, in public view and in front of \nhis travel companions.  Mr. E. Paryavi is ashamed and humiliated that his friends witness \nhim being treated by Defendants as a criminal and a “known or  suspected terrorist.” \nMoreover, Mr. E. Paryavi is ashamed and humiliated that his travel companions are routinely \nmade to suffer just because they are traveling with him.   \n987.  On one occasion, while traveling domestically, an agent at the gate asked Mr. \nE.  Paryavi  to  approach  the  counter  and  notified  him  that  he  needed  to  verify  his \ndocumentation.  The  agent  told  Mr.  E.  Paryavi  that  the  system  required  his  passport. \nHowever, because it was a domestic flight, Mr. E. Paryavi did not have his passport with him. \nThe agent then called a supervisor. Eventually, the agent told Mr. E. Paryavi he would be able \n162 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 163 of 268\nto board his flight. When Mr. E. Paryavi attempted to board, the system rejected his boarding \npass. Again, an agent spoke with a supervisor to obtain clearance for him to board his flight.  \n988.  On or about May 28, 2018, Mr. E. Paryavi and his friends were stopped at a US-\nMexico port of entry on his way into the United States. They were directed to pull over and \nturn off the car ignition.  CBP officers confiscated the passports of Mr. E. Paryavi and his \ntravel companions.  A yellow sticker was placed in Mr. E. Paryavi’s passport.  \n989.  After two hours of waiting in the car, a CBP officer escorted Mr. E. Paryavi to a \nroom where he was interrogated about his travel history, his occupation, and his family.  \n990.  The CBP officer searched through Mr. E. Paryavi’s personal belongings and his \nphotos on his cell phone. \n991.  Mr. E. Paryavi has filed a DHS TRIP inquiry.  He has received a letter as \ndescribed in Paragraph 217 and was assigned a redress control number  \n992.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Paryavi remains on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist.  \nPlaintiff Faraz Siddiqui \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n993.  Since  approximately  2010,  every  time  Faraz  Siddiqui  travels  by  air,  his \nboarding pass is routinely stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he has been \ndesignated by Defendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n994.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass. \n163 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 164 of 268\n995.  Rather Mr. Siddiqui is directed each time to an airline representative, who then \ncontacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that can \ntake a very long time. \n996.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it. \n997.  When Mr. Siddiqui scans his boarding pass at the entrance to the TSA security \ncheckpoint, the scanner indicates a red light. \n998.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Mr. Siddiqui to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive pat \ndown, an extensive search of all his personal belongings and chemical residue testing of his \nperson and his belongings – twice – at the TSA security checkpoint and again at the gate, in \npublic view and in front of his travel companions. \n999.  Whenever Mr. Siddiqui arrives in the United States from international trips, \ntwo CBP officers check everyone’s passports as they deplane until they identify him. \n1000.  The two CBP officers then escort him from the gate to an interrogation room \nwhere he is detained and interrogated by FBI agents or CBP officers.  All his personal \nbelongings are also searched. \n1001.  Additionally, whenever Mr. Siddiqui has electronics in his possession, CBP \nofficers  confiscate  his  electronics  and  upon  information  and  belief,  download  the \ninformation from them, including his laptop and his cell phone, without his consent. \n164 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 165 of 268\n1002.  Upon returning on a flight from Saudi Arabia, Mr. Siddiqui was interrogated \nabout whether he ever crossed the border from Saudi Arabia to Yemen, whether he knew \nanyone who worked for Al Qaeda, and what his opinions are on foreign matters.  \n1003.  During many of the trips that Mr. Siddiqui traveled with his wife and children, \nthey were subjected to substantially similar treatment as him. \n1004.  On one occasion, Mr. Siddiqui’s two-months old daughter was screened.  \n1005.  In order to avoid being treated as “known or suspected terrorists” when they \ntravel, Mr. Siddiqui’s wife and children now travel separately from Mr. Siddiqui. \n1006.  On more than one occasion, FBI agents attempted to interrogate Mr. Siddiqui \nin his home.  Shortly after Mr. Siddiqui refused to speak with FBI agents without an attorney \npresent, FBI agents interrogated a relative of Mr. Siddiqui.  Upon information and belief, Mr. \nSiddiqui’s relative was subjected to an FBI interrogation because of his relation to Mr. \nSiddiqui and due to Mr. Siddiqui’s status on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.  \n1007.  Further, shortly after Mr. Siddiqui was designated on the federal watchlist, his \npersonal bank accounts were suddenly closed without notice or explanation of the reasons \nwhy they were closed. \n1008.  Upon information and belief, Defendants disseminated the stigmatizing label \nof “known or suspected terrorist” attached to Mr. Siddiqui to his bank, and as a result, his \nbank accounts were closed without notice.  \n1009.  Relatives who share a last name with Mr. Siddiqui also had personal bank \naccounts suddenly closed without notice or explanation of the reasons why they were closed.  \nUpon information and belief, this occurred because of their relation to Mr. Siddiqui and his \nstatus on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.  \n165 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 166 of 268\n1010.  Mr. Siddiqui has filed multiple DHS TRIP inquiries.  He has received multiple \nletters as described in Paragraph 217 and has been assigned multiple redress control \nnumbers. \n1011.  Because of his watchlist designation and his treatment while traveling, Mr. \nSiddiqui is unable to apply for jobs which require him to travel.  \n1012.  Further, Mr. Siddiqui desires to return to Saudi Arabia for Hajj, a religious \nobligation for Muslims, but has not done so out of fear of the treatment he would receive by \nDefendants.  \n1013.  Mr. Siddiqui has considered permanently moving his family outside the United \nStates to avoid the treatment he receives because of his watchlist designation. \n1014.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Siddiqui remains on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist.   \nPlaintiff Zijad Bosnic \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff)  \n \n1015.  Zijad Bosnic was originally born in Bosnia in 1972 and moved to the United \nStates in 1997.  Thereafter, Mr. Bosnic became a United States citizen.  \n1016.  Mr. Bosnic is a commercial truck driver.  He has been married for twenty-two \nyears. Together, Mr. Bosnic and his wife have three children, all of whom are United States \ncitizens.  \n1017.  Mr. Bosnic lives in Jacksonville, Florida, where he owns his home.   \n1018.  Because Mr. Bosnic’s wife and children live in Bosnia, he regularly travels from \nthe United States to Bosnia to spend time with his family. \n166 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 167 of 268\n1019.  On March 1, 2017, Mr. Bosnic appeared at Sarajevo International Airport to \nboard his flight back home to the United States. \n1020.  Mr. Bosnic had previously purchased a plane ticket for a Turkish Airlines flight \nto Istanbul, Turkey, and he was scheduled to fly to John F. Kennedy International Airport, \nand on to Jacksonville International Airport in Florida. \n1021.  Mr. Bosnic presented himself at the Turkish Airlines counter with plenty of \ntime prior to his flight. \n1022.  When  Mr.  Bosnic  first  arrived  at  the  ticketing  counter,  the  airline \nrepresentative printed his boarding passes and presented them to him.  \n1023.  However, as the Turkish Airlines representative started to tag his luggage, the \nrepresentative informed Mr. Bosnic that he was no longer allowed to board his flight.  \n1024.  The Turkish Airlines representative requested that Mr. Bosnic return his \nboarding passes, and his luggage was returned to him.  \n1025.  In response to an inquiry as to why he was being denied boarding, the Turkish \nAirlines representative directed Mr. Bosnic to the U.S. Embassy to obtain information as to \nwhy he is no longer permitted to board a flight back to his home in the United States.  \n1026.  The following morning, Mr. Bosnic went to the United States Embassy in \nSarajevo, Bosnia to inquire regarding why he was denied boarding and being prevented from \nreturning to his home in the United States.  \n1027.  The United States Embassy informed Mr. Bosnic that they had no information \nregarding why he was being denied boarding.  However, he was advised to fill out a DHS \nTRIP complaint.   \n1028.  Mr. Bosnic immediately filed a DHS TRIP complaint.  \n167 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 168 of 268\n1029.  Approximately one week after being denied boarding at the airport, two men \nwho identified themselves as being employed by the United States Embassy contacted Mr. \nBosnic’s brother and requested that Mr. Bosnic return to the Embassy.  They advised Mr. \nBosnic’s brother that they would help Mr. Bosnic return to his home in the United States. \n1030.  The two men did not leave contact information.  \n1031.  Mr. Bosnic’s brother contacted Mr. Bosnic, relayed what transpired, and told \nhim to return to the United States Embassy. \n1032.  After arriving at the United States Embassy, Mr. Bosnic was interviewed by \ntwo FBI agents, including FBI Agent Lopez. \n1033.  During the interview, the FBI agents asked Mr. Bosnic a series of routine \nquestions, including his name, where he worked, and what he did for a living.  \n1034.  The FBI agents interrogated Mr. Bosnic regarding whether he was a terrorist, \nwhether he believed that ISIS is the reason that he can’t fly, and whether he believed in \nterrorism.  \n1035.  The FBI agents advised Mr. Bosnic they were not certain why he could not fly, \nbut that they would help him fly again. \n1036.  Nearly two months later, on April 21, 2017, Mr. Bosnic received an email from \nDHS TRIP stating they had received his travel inquiry form and identity documentation, and \nfrom that point on he could continue to check the status of his inquiry online.  \n1037.  Approximately three months after being denied boarding and from returning \nto his home in the United States, Mr. Bosnic again arrived at Sarajevo International Airport \nto try to board another flight home. He reserved a ticket that connected in Turkey on his way \nback to his home in Jacksonville, Florida. \n168 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 169 of 268\n1038.  This time, Turkish Airlines personnel were unable to check Mr. Bosnic in for \nhis flight and did not issue him a boarding pass. \n1039.  On or before May 22, 2017, Mr. Bosnic checked the status of his DHS TRIP \ncomplaint on the DHS TRIP website provided. The website indicated that Mr. Bosnic was \nmissing documents that he had already provided when he initially filed his complaint on \nMarch 3, 2017.  \n1040.  Mr. Bosnic immediately emailed DHS TRIP and requested that they not delay \nhis complaint process any further and attached the alleged missing documents.  \n1041.  On May 24, 2017, DHS TRIP emailed Mr. Bosnic informing him they had made \na final determination of his case.  In the same email, a letter dated May 18, 2017 was attached, \nwhich confirmed that Mr. Bosnic was on Defendants’ No Fly List.  \n1042.  On or about June 19, 2017, TSA issued a letter that states in part “(TSA) has \ndetermined that you may pose a security threat warranting the immediate revocation of your \nTransportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) and unescorted access to secure \nareas.  The letter further stated that “your TWIC has been suspended until this matter is \nresolved.” \n1043.  The TSA determination to suspend Mr. Bosnic’s TWIC® card, as stated in the \nletter, was made “for reasons set forth in 49 C.F.R. § 1572.107” \n1044.  Section (a) of 49 C.F.R. § 1572.107 provides that “TSA may determine that an \napplicant poses a security threat based on a search of … (2) Terrorist watchlists and related \ndatabases” and “(3) Any other databases relevant to determining whether an applicant \nposes, or is suspected of posing, a security threat, or that confirm an applicant’s identity.” \n169 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 170 of 268\n1045.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Bosnic’s TWIC® card was suspended due to \nhis placement on the federal terrorist watchlist. \n1046.  Mr. Bosnic is a truck driver by trade and much of his livelihood derives from \ndriving to and from ports and other areas which require a TWIC® card. \n1047.  On June 14, 2017, Mr. Bosnic received a one-time waiver that allowed him to \nfinally return home in the United States.  \n1048.  Approximately  one  month  later  Mr.  Bosnic  arrived  at  Jacksonville \nInternational Airport for another international trip to Bosnia.  \n1049.  He was once again unable to check-in online or at the airport kiosk.  Rather, he \nwas directed to an airline representative for further assistance. \n1050.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, Mr. \nBosnic had to wait approximately 40 minutes before the airline representative obtained \nclearance for Mr. Bosnic to board his flight. \n1051.  His boarding pass was stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he \nwas still designated as a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n1052.  Once Mr. Bosnic arrived at the TSA security checkpoint, he provided his \nboarding pass and identification documents to the TSA agent stationed at the entrance to the \nTSA security checkpoint.   \n1053.  The boarding pass scanner indicated a red light when Mr. Bosnic’s boarding \npass was scanned.   \n1054.  Mr. Bosnic was escorted to a different line than the other travelers passing \nthrough the TSA security checkpoint and subjected to enhanced screening.   \n170 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 171 of 268\n1055.  Mr. Bosnic was subjected to an extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of all his personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings in public view at \nthe TSA checkpoint.   \n1056.  When Mr. Bosnic arrived at the gate, he was subjected to an additional search, \nwhich included a pat down and search of all his personal belongings, even though he had just \ncleared security with no issues at the TSA security checkpoint.  \n1057.  In August 2017, Mr. Bosnic arrived at Sarajevo International Airport for his \nreturn trip to the United States.  \n1058.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, Mr. \nBosnic had to wait approximately 40 minutes before the airline representative obtained \nclearance for Mr. Bosnic to board his flight. \n1059.  The airline representative was only able to print his boarding pass to Vienna, \nAustria. However, she was unable to print Mr. Bosnic’s boarding pass to the United States.  \n1060.  When Mr. Bosnic arrived in Austria, after presenting himself to the airline \nrepresentative at the ticket counter, Mr. Bosnic had to wait approximately 40 minutes before \nthe airline representative obtained clearance for Mr. Bosnic to board his flight. \n1061.  His boarding pass was stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he \nwas designated as a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n1062.   He was subjected to extra screening which included an invasive and lengthy \nsearch of his person and belongings.  \n1063.  When Mr. Bosnic arrived at passport control at Dulles International Airport, \nhe was questioned about whether he boarded any flights to the Middle East, whether he went \n171 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 172 of 268\nto Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, or other Muslim-majority countries, whether he was ever a \nmember of the military, whether he is a member of any movements, and whether he was \never arrested in Bosnia or the United States.  \n1064.  Mr.  Bosnic  was  subjected  to  an  additional  searched  of  his  person  and \nbelongings at the gate before he was allowed to board his flight to Jacksonville. \n1065.  His boarding pass was stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he \nwas designated as a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n1066.  Mr. Bosnic previously filed his claims in the Middle District of Florida; he \nvoluntarily  dismissed  that  action  without  prejudice  on  August  17,  2018  in  order  to \nconsolidate his claims with this case. \n1067.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Bosnic remains on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist.   \nPlaintiff Abdu Wakil Cyeef Din \n(A watchlisted Plaintiff) \n1068.  In 2013, Abdu Cyeef Din arrived at Miami International Airport from a trip to \nMorocco and Egypt.  \n1069.  He went to an Automated Passport Control kiosk at customs. His declaration \nform had an “X” printed on it with instructions to go to a customs agent. \n1070.  Upon presenting his declaration form to a customs agent, CBP officers escorted \nhim into a back room where they searched Mr. Cyeef Din’s belongings.   \n1071.  CBP officers interrogated Mr. Cyeef Din about whether he contacted anyone in \nEgypt,  including  non-governmental  organizations  (NGOs),  whether  he  had  drugs  and \n172 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 173 of 268\nwhether he contacted drug dealers, why he had a set of books written in Arabic, and whether \nhe was learning Arabic.  \n1072.  Ever since 2013, Mr. Cyeef Din is subjected to enhanced screening and lengthy \ndelays every time he travels by air.  \n1073.  His boarding passes for his flights are routinely stamped with the “SSSS” \ndesignation, indicating that he has been designated by Defendants as a “known or suspected \nterrorist.”  \n1074.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass. \n1075.  Rather, Mr. Cyeef Din is directed each time to an airline representative, who \nthen contacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that \ncan take a very long time. \n1076.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it. \n1077.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Mr. Cyeef Din to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive pat \ndown  including  a  search  of  his  groin  area,  an  extensive  search  of  all  of his  personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings – twice – at the TSA \nsecurity  checkpoint  and  again  at  the  gate,  in  public  view  and  in  front  of  his  travel \ncompanions. \n1078.  Moreover, oftentimes the people that Mr. Cyeef Din travels with are also \ntreated as “known or suspected terrorists” just because they are traveling with him. \n173 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 174 of 268\n1079.  On  or  about  September  2017,  Mr.  Cyeef  Din  arrived  at  Albuquerque \nInternational Airport to board his flight to Oregon with his wife. \n1080.  He and his wife were unable to check-in online or at the airport kiosk.  Rather, \nthey were directed to an airline representative for further assistance. \n1081.  After presenting themselves to the airline representative at the ticket counter, \nMr. Cyeef Din and his wife had to wait approximately forty-five minutes before the airline \nrepresentative obtained clearance for them to board their flight. \n1082.  Their boarding passes were stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating \nthat Mr. Cyeef Din and his wife were designated as a “known or suspected terrorists.” \n1083.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Cyeef Din’s wife received a boarding pass \nwith the “SSSS” designation because she was traveling with Mr. Cyeef Din.  \n1084.  Once Mr. Cyeef Din and his wife arrived at the TSA security checkpoint, they \nprovided their boarding passes and identification documents to the TSA agent stationed at \nthe entrance to the TSA security checkpoint.   \n1085.  Mr. Cyeef Din was escorted to a different line than the other travelers passing \nthrough the TSA security checkpoint and subjected to enhanced screening.   \n1086.  Mr. Cyeef Din was subjected to an extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of all his personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings in public view at \nthe TSA checkpoint.   \n1087.  TSA agents took Mr. Cyeef Din’s wife into a private room where they subjected \nher to a search.  \n174 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 175 of 268\n1088.  Once Mr. Cyeef Din finally arrived at the gate, two TSA agents and an unknown \nindividual in a suit were waiting for him to arrive.      \n1089.  At the gate and before being allowed to board, in public view, Mr. Cyeef Din \nand his wife were once again subjected to an invasive and lengthy pat down, all their \npersonal belongings were searched again, and their belongings were subjected to another \nround of chemical residue testing even though they had just cleared security with no issues \nat the TSA security checkpoint. \n1090.  Mr. Cyeef Din felt ashamed and humiliated, especially because he was treated \nas a “known or suspected terrorist” in public view.   \n1091.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Mr.  Cyeef  Din  and  travel  companions  are \nsubjected to the above described treatment because of their relation and association with \nhim, because they travel with him, and because of his status on Defendants’ federal terrorist \nwatchlist. \n1092.  Mr. Cyeef Din’s wife felt ashamed and humiliated, especially because she was \ntreated as a “known or suspected terrorist” in public view.   \n1093.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Cyeef Din remains on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist.  \nPlaintiff Mirrakhmat Muminov \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n1094.  Mirrakhmat Muminov is a refugee and green card holder from Uzbekistan.  \n1095.  Mr. Muminov has been subject to extensive searches and lengthy delays while \ntraveling since January 2013.   \n175 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 176 of 268\n1096.  On January 10, 2013, Mr. Muminov was returning from a brief business trip to \nCanada. \n1097.  Upon presenting the primary CBP officer with his passport, several armed CBP \nofficers immediately surrounded Mr. Muminov on all sides. \n1098.  The CBP officers pointed their guns at Mr. Muminov and ordered Mr. Muminov \nto exit his car slowly and show his hands.  \n1099.  CBP officers then handcuffed Mr. Muminov and escorted him to a holding cell \nwhere they detained him for several hours. \n1100.  CBP officers placed Mr. Muminov, who was wearing only a long-sleeve shirt \nand no jacket, in a cold cell, with only a metal seat, metal doors, and a small window used by \nCBP officers to monitor Mr. Muminov.  \n1101.  After approximately two and a half hours, a CBP officer escorted Mr. Muminov \ninto a separate room where he was interrogated about his background, his home-country, \nwhen he first came to the United States and how he arrived, and his religious views, including \nwhich mosque he attends.  \n1102.  Mr.  Muminov  was  subjected  to  an  invasive  pat  down  and  searched  and \ninterrogated for over four hours.  His belongings were also seized and searched. \n1103.  Mr. Muminov was also subjected to finger printing, forced to provide a piece \nof his hair, had the inside of his mouth swabbed, and forced to undergo an iris scan.   \n1104.  The CBP officers confiscated his cell phone and laptop, and upon information \nand belief, downloaded the information and data from his cell phone and laptop without his \nconsent.  \n176 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 177 of 268\n1105.  Mr. Muminov felt ashamed and humiliated because he was being treated by \nthe government as a criminal and a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n1106.  Ever since this encounter, Mr. Muminov stopped traveling to Canada and as a \nresult, has lost business opportunities in Canada.   \n1107.  In July 2014, Mr. Muminov arrived at O’Hare International Airport for a flight \nto Ohio.  \n1108.  He was unable to check-in online or at the airport kiosk. Rather, he was \ndirected to an airline representative for further assistance.  \n1109.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, Mr. \nMuminov had to wait until the airline representative obtained clearance for Mr. Muminov to \nboard his flight. \n1110.  The  boarding  pass  given  to  Mr.  Muminov  was  stamped  with  the  “SSSS” \ndesignation, indicating that he was designated as a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n1111.  Once Mr. Muminov arrived at the TSA security checkpoint, he provided his \nboarding pass and identification documents to the TSA agent stationed at the entrance to the \nTSA security checkpoint.   \n1112.  The TSA agent then used a microphone to announce a special security code \nsignaling three or four TSA agents to escort Mr. Muminov to a different line than the other \ntravelers  passing  through  the  TSA  security  checkpoint  and  subject  him  to  enhanced \nscreening.   \n1113.  Mr. Muminov was subjected to an extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of all his personal \n177 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 178 of 268\nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings in public view at \nthe TSA checkpoint.   \n1114.  When Mr. Muminov boarded his flight, an airline representative directed him \nto a seat in the first row.  \n1115.  Mr. Muminov noticed an individual seated near him who was watching him \nduring the entire flight. \n1116.  Upon information and belief, this individual watching Mr. Muminov was an \nundercover federal agent. \n1117.  Upon boarding his connecting flight from Charlotte, South Carolina to Akron, \nOhio, airline representatives directed Mr. Muminov to sit in the first few rows.  \n1118.  Again, Mr. Muminov noticed an individual seated near him who was watching \nhim during the entire flight.  \n1119.  Upon information and belief, this individual watching Mr. Muminov was also a \nfederal agent. \n1120.  Mr. Muminov felt ashamed and humiliated, especially because he was treated \nas a “known or suspected terrorist” in public view. \n1121.  Because of his experience, Mr. Muminov cancelled his return flight and drove \nback to Chicago, a drive that took approximately eight or nine hours.  \n1122.  Moreover, as a result his experience, Mr. Muminov stopped traveling by air. \n1123.  Because of his designation on the federal terrorist watchlist, Mr. Muminov has \nbeen subjected to citizenship application delays and denials.  \n1124.  On December 12, 2015, Mr. Muminov’s mother had her visitor visa revoked \nwithout explanation.  \n178 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 179 of 268\n1125.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Mr.  Muminov’s  mother’s  visa  was  revoked \nbecause of Mr. Muminov’s status on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.  \n1126.  Because of his designation on the federal terrorist watchlist, Mr. Muminov has \nbeen subjected to FBI interrogations.   \n1127.  Mr. Muminov filed a DHS TRIP Inquiry around approximately 2014.  He has \nreceived a letter as described in Paragraph 217 and was assigned a redress control number. \n1128.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Muminov remains on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist.   \nPlaintiff Anisa Mujanovic \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n1129.   Ever since 2015, every time Anisa Mujanovic travels by air, she is subjected to \nenhanced screening and lengthy delays.   \n1130.  Her boarding passes for her flights are routinely stamped with the “SSSS” \ndesignation, indicating that she has been designated by Defendants as a “known or suspected \nterrorist.” \n1131.  She is routinely unable to check in for her flights online or print her boarding \npass. \n1132.  Rather Ms. Mujanovic is directed each time to an airline representative, who \nthen contacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow her to board her flight, a process that \ncan take a very long time. \n1133.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nher to board her flight, the airline representative prints her boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it. \n179 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 180 of 268\n1134.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on her boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Ms. Mujanovic to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of all of her personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of her person and her belongings – twice – at the \nTSA security checkpoint and again at the gate, in public view and in front of her travel \ncompanions. \n1135.  Moreover, oftentimes the people that Mr. Mujanovic travels with are also \ntreated as “known or suspected terrorists” just because they are traveling with her. \n1136.  On June 16, 2017, Ms. Mujanovic and her husband arrived at Minneapolis-Saint \nPaul International Airport for an international flight to Bosnia.  \n1137.  Ms. Mujanovic and her husband were unable to check-in online or at the \nairport kiosk.  Rather, they were directed to an airline representative for further assistance. \n1138.  After presenting themselves to the airline representative at the ticket counter, \nMs. Mujanovic and her husband had to wait before the airline representative obtained \nclearance from Defendants for Ms. Mujanovic and her husband to board their flights. \n1139.  The boarding passes of both Ms. Mujanovic and her husband were stamped \nwith  the  “SSSS”  designation,  indicating  that  they  were  both  designated  as  “known  or \nsuspected terrorists.” \n1140.  Once Ms. Mujanovic and her husband arrived at the TSA security checkpoint, \nthey provided their boarding passes and identification documents to the officer stationed at \nthe entrance to the TSA security checkpoint.   \n1141.  The  boarding  pass  scanner  indicated  a  red  light  when  Ms.  Mujanovic’s \nboarding pass was scanned.   \n180 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 181 of 268\n1142.  Ms. Mujanovic and her husband were both escorted to a different line than the \nother travelers passing through the TSA security checkpoint and subjected to enhanced \nscreening.   \n1143.  Ms.  Mujanovic  was  subjected  to  an  extensive  and  lengthy  screening,  an \ninvasive pat down including a search of her groin area, an extensive search of all her personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of her person and her belongings in public view. \n1144.  Ms. Mujanovic’s husband received substantially similar treatment.  \n1145.  On August 19, 2017, Ms. Mujanovic and her husband re-entered the United \nStates at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport. \n1146.  Upon presenting their passports to CBP officers at the customs window, Ms. \nMujanovic  and  her  husband  were  escorted  to  secondary  inspection  where  they  were \ndetained and interrogated. All their personal belongings were also searched. \n1147.  Ms. Mujanovic was interrogated about the reasoning behind ISIS’ killing, \nwhether she knows any individuals involved with ISIS, whether she’s connected to ISIS, \ndifferences between Sunni and Shia Muslims, and how much money she gives to charities \nper year, including the reasons why.  \n1148.  When Ms. Mujanovic questioned the reasons for her detainment, a CBP officer \nresponded that she should remove her hijab when she travels to avoid travel delays and \nenhanced screening.  \n1149.  Ms. Mujanovic’s husband was interrogated about whether he sends money to \nBosnia, and whether his wife supports terrorism and terrorist groups including ISIS.  \n181 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 182 of 268\n1150.  Ms. Mujanovic’s husband was asked to provide his passwords for his social \nmedia accounts and interrogated about which social media platforms he utilizes, including \nInstagram, Viber, and WhatsApp.  \n1151.  Both Ms. Mujanovic and her husband’s cell phones were confiscated, and upon \ninformation and belief, Defendants downloaded the data from them without their consent.  \n1152.  Following this experience, Ms. Mujanovic was diagnosed with post-traumatic \nstress  disorder  (PTSD),  experienced  stress,  depression,  and  insomnia,  and  was  given \nmedication in connection with her symptoms.  \n1153.  On another occasion, CBP officers interrogated Ms. Mujanovic’s children upon \nre-entering the United States at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, one of whom \nwas a minor.  \n1154.  CBP officers interrogated Ms. Mujanovic’s son about whether his mom spends \na lot of time on the computer, whether his mom visits Islamist or Jihadist websites, which \nreligious scholars she listens to, and who she speaks with.  \n1155.  CBP  officers  interrogated  Ms.  Mujanovic’s  daughter.  However,  she  was \nsubjected to far less questioning and given favorable treatment when she informed CBP \nofficers that she intended to attend college at a private catholic university.  \n1156.  After that experience, Ms. Mujanovic’s children told their mother they never \nwanted to travel with her ever again.   \n1157.  Ms. Mujanovic felt ashamed and humiliated in front of her family because they \nwere treated as “known or suspected terrorists” because of their relationship or associated \nwith her, and because they were traveling with her.  \n182 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 183 of 268\n1158.  Ms.  Mujanovic  has  been  subjected  to  FBI  interrogations  because  of  her \nwatchlist status.  \n1159.  In August or September 2018, FBI agent Olen Freeman attempted to meet with \nMs. Mujanovic to conduct an FBI interrogation. \n1160.  Upon information and belief, the FBI attempted to interrogate Ms. Mujanovic \nbecause of her watchlist designation.   \n1161.  In 2015, Western Union notified Ms. Mujanovic that her account had been \nclosed for security reasons. No further explanation was provided.  \n1162.  Upon information and belief, Ms. Mujanovic’s account was closed because of \nher watchlist designation.  \n1163.  Because of the above described treatment, Ms. Mujanovic has been routinely \nhumiliated in public and in front of her family and stigmatized as a criminal because of her \nstatus on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist. \n1164.  Moreover, because of the above described treatment, Ms. Mujanovic has been \ndiscouraged from visiting her mother and sister in Bosnia, and no longer travels by air. \n1165.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Mujanovic remains on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist.     \nPlaintiff Mohamad Hachem \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n1166.  Mohamad Hachem is a successful businessman residing in Florida.  \n1167.  Since approximately 2007, every time Mr. Hachem travels by air, his boarding \npass is routinely stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he has been designated \nby Defendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n183 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 184 of 268\n1168.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass. \n1169.  Rather Mr. Hachem is directed each time to an airline representative, who then \ncontacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that can \ntake a very long time. \n1170.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it. \n1171.  When Mr. Hachem scans his boarding pass at the entrance to the TSA security \ncheckpoint, the scanner indicates a red light. \n1172.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Mr. Hachem to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive pat \ndown, an extensive search of all his personal belongings and chemical residue testing of his \nperson and his belongings – twice – at the TSA security checkpoint and again at the gate, in \npublic view and in front of his travel companions. \n1173.  Whenever Mr. Hachem arrives in the United States from international trips, \ntwo CBP officers check everyone’s passports as they deplane until they identify him. \n1174.  The two CBP officers then escort him from the gate to an interrogation room \nwhere he is detained and interrogated by FBI agents or CBP officers.  All his personal \nbelongings are also searched. \n1175.  Additionally, whenever Mr. Hachem has electronics in his possession, CBP \nofficers  confiscate  his  electronics  and  upon  information  and  belief,  download  the \ninformation from them, including his laptop and his cell phone, without his consent. \n184 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 185 of 268\n1176.  On February 10, 2019, Mr. Hachem arrived at Miami International Airport for \nan international trip to Panama.   \n1177.  Mr. Hachem was traveling with his cousin, a Lebanese colonel responsible for \nthe security of American and European embassies in Lebanon, and with his attorney, for \nbusiness purposes. Mr. Hachem’s companions witnessed the entire treatment that he was \nsubjected to that day, described below.   \n1178.  Mr. Hachem and his companions were prevented from checking in online and \nat the airport kiosk.  Instead, they were directed to an airline representative for further \nassistance.   \n1179.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, the \nairline representative informed Mr. Hachem that she could not issue boarding passes for him \nor his companions because the airline received an e-mail from Erich Miller, NTVC Watch \nManager informing them that Mr. Hachem was inhibited from flying without the airline first \ncalling the NTVC.   \n1180.  After a phone call to NTVC clearing Mr. Hachem for boarding, and after making \nsure TSA searched all of Mr. Hachem’s cousin’s checked-in luggage, the airline representative \nwas able to obtain clearance from Defendants so that Mr. Hachem and his companions could \nboard their flights.  \n1181.  This entire ordeal took approximately 90 minutes.    \n1182.  Mr. Hachem and his companions’ boarding passes were stamped with the \n“SSSS” designation indicating that they each have been labeled as “known or suspected \nterrorists.”  \n185 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 186 of 268\n1183.  Once Mr. Hachem and his companions arrived at the TSA security checkpoint, \nthey provided their boarding passes and identification documents to the TSA agent stationed \nat the entrance of the TSA security checkpoint.    \n1184.  Mr. Hachem and his companions were escorted to a different line than the \nother travelers passing through the TSA security checkpoint and subjected to enhanced \nscreening.   \n1185.  Mr. Hachem was subjected to an extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including a search of his groin area, in addition to a TSA male agent placing his \nfingers inside and around Mr. Hachem’s waist, an extensive search of all his personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings in public view and \nin front of his family.  Mr. Hachem’s companions received the same treatment.    \n1186.  The search lasted approximately 60-90 minutes.  \n1187.  When  Mr.  Hachem  and  his  travel  companions  arrived  at  Tocumen \nInternational Airport in Panama, they were escorted to the diplomatic welcome room in the \nairport to receive expedited processing. However, after Panamanian authorities processed \nMr. Hachem’s passport, Mr. Hachem and his travel companions were removed from the \ndiplomatic welcome room. \n1188.  Instead, several Panamanian officers escorted Mr. Hachem into another room \nwhere he was detained and interrogated.  \n1189.  Mr. Hachem was interrogated in a substantially similar manner he experiences \nwhen interrogated by CBP in the United States. \n186 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 187 of 268\n1190.  Upon information and belief, Defendants disseminated the federal terrorist \nwatchlist to the Panamanian government so that it subjects Mr. Hachem to substantially \nsimilar treatment he receives when he travels in the United States.  \n1191.  Further, Mr. Hachem was interrogated about his religious affiliation.  \n1192.  Mr. Hachem was traveling to Panama for a meeting with a successful and \ninfluential  Panamanian  business  leader  to  explore  business  opportunities.  When  the \nbusiness leader learned that Mr. Hachem and his companions would be late leaving the \nairport because of enhanced questioning due to Mr. Hachem’s placement on Defendants’ \nfederal terrorist watchlist, the business leader canceled all scheduled business meetings and \nrefused to meet with Mr. Hachem and his companions. Thus, as a direct result of Mr. \nHachem’s watchlist designation, Mr. Hachem lost significant business opportunities.  \n1193.  Mr. Hachem was ashamed and humiliated that a prominent business leader \nknew Mr. Hachem was treated as a criminal and a “known or suspected terrorist.” Moreover, \nMr. Hachem felt ashamed and humiliated that his travel companions were made to suffer just \nbecause they were traveling with him.  \n1194.  Upon their return to the United States, one of Mr. Hachem’s travel companions, \nthe respected colonel, chose to fly back to Lebanon as opposed to the United States, because \nhe felt unsafe returning to the United States given the treatment he was subjected to and that \nhe witnessed Mr. Hachem being subjected to. Thus, only Mr. Hachem and his attorney \nreturned to the United States.  \n1195.  Upon returning to Tocumen International Airport in Panama for their return \nflight to the United States, Mr. Hachem and his travel companion experienced substantially \nsimilar treatment they received at Miami International Airport when they departed.  \n187 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 188 of 268\n1196.  When Mr. Hachem and his attorney arrived at Miami International Airport, \nthey were escorted to secondary inspection. \n1197.  Mr. Hachem’s attorney was detained in a separate area, despite Mr. Hachem \ninforming  CBP  officers  that  he  wished  to  have  his  attorney  present  with  him  during \ninterrogations.  \n1198.  CBP officers informed Mr. Hachem’s attorney that Mr. Hachem would only be \nsearched, and not interrogated.  \n1199.  Despite these assurances, CBP officers attempted to interrogated Mr. Hachem. \nMr. Hachem refused to answer questions without the presence of his attorney.  \n1200.  CBP officers conducted a search of Mr. Hachem’s personal belongings.  \n1201.  After some time, Mr. Hachem’s attorney asked CBP officer Mahadeo about the \nstatus of his client. Officer Mahadeo informed Mr. Hachem’s attorney that he would be \nreunited  with  his  client  once  they  finished  interrogating  Mr.  Hachem,  despite  prior \nassurances that CBP officers would not interrogate Mr. Hachem. \n1202.  Mr. Hachem is routinely humiliated in public and in front of his business and \ntravel companions, discouraged from flying, and stigmatized as a criminal because of his \nstatus on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.   \n1203.  Mr. Hachem applied to Global Entry however, his application was denied \nwithout providing any explanation.  \n1204.  Upon information and belief, his application to participate in the Global Entry \nprogram was denied because of his status on the federal terrorist watchlist. \n1205.  Further, shortly after Mr. Hachem was designated on the federal watchlist, \nBank of America, Premier American Bank, and a third bank suddenly closed two or three of \n188 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 189 of 268\nhis business bank accounts without notice or explanation of the reasons why they were \nclosed. \n1206.  Upon information and belief, Defendants disseminated the stigmatizing label \nof “known or suspected terrorist” attached to Mr. Hachem to his banks; and as a result, his \nbank accounts were closed without notice. \n1207.  Mr. Hachem has filed a DHS TRIP inquiry.  He has received a letter as described \nin Paragraph 217 and was assigned a redress control number. \n1208.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Hachem remains on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist.  \nPlaintiff Ashraf Riad \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n1209.  Asraf  Riad  is  an  engineer  residing  in  Florida  and  frequently  travels  for \nbusiness.  \n1210.  For the past ten years, every time Mr. Riad travels by air, his boarding passes \nfor his flights are routinely stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he has been \ndesignated by Defendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n1211.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass. \n1212.  Rather Mr. Riad is directed each time to an airline representative, who then \ncontacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that can \ntake a very long time. \n189 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 190 of 268\n1213.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it. \n1214.  TSA agents then escort Mr. Riad to the TSA security checkpoint and upon \nseeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA agents then subject Mr. \nRiad to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive pat down including a search of \nhis groin area, an extensive search of all of his personal belongings and chemical residue \ntesting of his person and his belongings – twice – at the TSA security checkpoint and again \nat the gate, in public view and in front of his travel companions. \n1215.  He often must wait again at the gate for an airline representative to obtain \nclearance from Defendants a second time to board his flight, even though Defendants already \nprovided clearance for him to board his flight prior to his boarding pass being printed in the \nfirst place. \n1216.  Moreover, oftentimes the people that Mr. Riad travels with are also treated as \n“known or suspected terrorists” just because they are traveling with him. \n1217.  Whenever Mr. Riad arrives in the United States from international trips, CBP \nofficers check everyone’s passports as they deplane until they find him. \n1218.  The CBP officers then escort him from the gate to an interrogation room where \nhe is detained and interrogated.  All his personal belongings are also searched. \n1219.  Additionally, whenever Mr. Riad has electronics in his possession, CBP officers \nconfiscate his electronics and upon information and belief, download the information from \nthem, including his iPad and his cell phone, without his consent. \n190 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 191 of 268\n1220.  In December 2018, Mr. Riad and his wife arrived at Orlando International \nAirport for an international flight to Istanbul, Turkey.  \n1221.  Mr. Riad and his wife were unable to check-in online or at the airport kiosk.  \nRather, he was directed to an airline representative for further assistance. \n1222.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, Mr. \nRiad had to wait a significant amount of time until the airline representative obtained \nclearance for Mr. Riad and his wife to board their flight. \n1223.  Mr.  Riad  and  his  wife’s  boarding  passes  were  stamped  with  the  “SSSS” \ndesignation, indicating that they were designated as a “known or suspected terrorists.” \n1224.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Riad’s wife’s boarding pass was stamped \nwith the “SSSS” designation because of Mr. Riad’s status on Defendants’ federal terrorism \nwatchlist. \n1225.  Once Mr. Riad and his wife arrived at the TSA security checkpoint, they \nprovided their boarding passes and identification documents to the TSA agent stationed at \nthe entrance to the TSA security checkpoint.   \n1226.  The boarding pass scanner indicated a red light when both Mr. Riad and his \nwife’s boarding passes were scanned.   \n1227.

Mr. Soueidan was unable to check-in online or at the airport kiosk.  Rather, \nthey were directed to an airline representative for further assistance. \n1367.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, Mr. \nSoueidan had to wait approximately one hour before the airline representative obtained \nclearance for Soueidan to board his flight.  \n1368.  Mr.  Soueidan’s  boarding  pass  was  stamped  with  the  “SSSS”  designation, \nindicating that he was designated as a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n1369.  Once Mr. Soueidan arrived at the TSA security checkpoint, he provided his \nboarding pass and identification document to the TSA agent stationed at the entrance to the \nTSA security checkpoint.   \n1370.  The boarding pass scanner indicated a red light when Mr. Soueidan’s boarding \npass was scanned.   \n1371.  Mr. Soueidan was escorted to a different line than the other travelers passing \nthrough the TSA security checkpoint and subjected to enhanced screening.   \n1372.  Mr. Soueidan was subjected to an extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of all his personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings in public view at \nthe TSA checkpoint.    \n1373.  Once Mr. Soueidan arrived at the gate, approximately ten TSA agents were \nwaiting for him to arrive.   \n208 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 209 of 268\n1374.  At the gate and before being allowed to board, in public view, Mr. Soueidan \nwas once again subjected to an invasive and lengthy pat down, all his personal belongings \nwere searched again, and he and his belongings were subjected to another round of chemical \nresidue testing despite the fact that he had just cleared security with no issues at the TSA \nsecurity checkpoint.  \n1375.  Mr. Soueidan felt humiliated and ashamed that he was being treated by the \ngovernment as a criminal and a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n1376.  When Mr. Soueidan reentered the United States following his trip to Lebanon, \ntwo CBP officers were waiting at the gate to check everyone’s passports as they deplaned \nuntil they identified him. \n1377.  The two CBP officers then escorted him from the gate to an interrogation room \nwhere he was detained and interrogated.  All his personal belongings were also searched. \n1378.  Mr. Soueidan was interrogated about the names of individuals he met with in \nLebanon, how often he travels to Lebanon, and whether he knows any members of ISIS.  \n1379.  Mr. Soueidan’s cell phone was confiscated, and upon information and belief, \nDefendants downloaded the data from it without his consent.  \n1380.  On one occasion, due to unreasonably extensive searches and questioning, Mr. \nSoueidan missed his outbound flight to Lebanon and was forced to rebook his ticket for the \nnext day.  \n1381.  Because of the above-described treatment, Mr. Soueidan has been routinely \nhumiliated in public and in front of his family and stigmatized as a criminal because of his \nstatus on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist. \n209 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 210 of 268\n1382.  Moreover,  because  of  the  above-described  treatment,  Mr.  Soueidan,  a \nbusinessman,  has  cancelled  multiple  business  trips  causing  him  to  lose  business \nopportunities.  \n1383.  Mr. Soueidan has filed multiple DHS TRIP inquiries. He received multiple \nletters as described in Paragraph 217 and was assigned multiple redress control numbers. \n1384.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Soueidan remains on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist.  \nPlaintiff Abdelmoniem Elamin \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n1385.  Abdelmoniem Elamin has been subject to extensive searches and lengthy \ndelays while traveling since 2017.   \n1386.  Every time Mr. Elamin travels by air, his boarding passes for his flights are \nroutinely stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he has been designated by \nDefendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n1387.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass. \n1388.  Rather Mr. Elamin is directed each time to an airline representative, who then \ncontacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that can \ntake a very long time. \n1389.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it.  \n210 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 211 of 268\n1390.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Mr. Elamin to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive pat \ndown including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of all his personal belongings \nand chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings – twice – at the TSA security \ncheckpoint and again at the gate, in public view and in front of his travel companions. \n1391.  Moreover, oftentimes the people that Mr. Elamin travels with are also treated \nas “known or suspected terrorists” just because they are traveling with him. \n1392.  Whenever Mr. Elamin arrives in the United States from international trips, CBP \nofficers check everyone’s passports as they deplane until they find him. \n1393.  The CBP officers then escort him from the gate to an interrogation room where \nhe is detained and interrogated.  All his personal belongings are also searched. \n1394.  Additionally, whenever Mr. Elamin has electronics in his possession, CBP \nofficers  confiscate  his  electronics  and  upon  information  and  belief,  download  the \ninformation from them, including his laptop and his cell phone, without his consent. \n1395.  On October 2017, Mr. Elamin arrived at Dulles International Airport for an \nInternational Trip to Saudi Arabia to perform the Hajj pilgrimage.  \n1396.  Mr. Elamin was traveling with seven other travel companions, all of whom \nwitnessed the events that transpired that day described below.  \n1397.  He was unable to check-in online or at the airport kiosk. Rather, he was \ndirected to an airline representative for further assistance.  \n1398.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, he \nhad to wait until the airline representative obtained clearance for Mr. Elamin to board his \nflight. \n211 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 212 of 268\n1399.  The  boarding  pass  given  to  Mr.  Elamin  was  stamped  with  the  “SSSS” \ndesignation, indicating that he was designated as a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n1400.  Once Mr. Elamin arrived at the TSA security checkpoint, he provided his \nboarding pass and identification documents to the TSA agent stationed at the entrance to the \nTSA security checkpoint.   \n1401.  Mr. Elamin was subjected to an extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of all his personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings in public view at \nthe TSA checkpoint.   \n1402.  Mr. Elamin felt ashamed and humiliated, especially because he was treated as \na “known or suspected terrorist” in front of his travel companions and in public view.  \n1403.  Once Mr. Elamin arrived at the gate and before being allowed to board, Mr. \nElamin was once again subjected to an invasive and lengthy pat down, all of his personal \nbelongings were searched again, and he and his belongings were subjected to another round \nof chemical residue testing despite the fact that he had just cleared security with no issues at \nthe TSA security checkpoint. \n1404.  Upon his return to the United States, Mr. Elamin traveled by air from King \nAbdulaziz International Airport in Saudi Arabia to Istanbul Atatürk Airport in Turkey.  \n1405.  When Mr. Elamin arrived in Istanbul, upon presenting himself to the airline \nrepresentative at the ticket counter, he had to wait until the airline representative obtained \nclearance for Mr. Elamin to board his flight. \n1406.  As a result, Mr. Elamin missed his return flight to the United States and was \nforced to rebook another flight.  \n212 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 213 of 268\n1407.  When Mr. Elamin landed in Dulles International Airport, two CBP officers were \nwaiting for him at the gate and escorted him to secondary inspection where he was detained \nand interrogated for approximately two hours.  \n1408.  Mr. Elamin was interrogated about whether he traveled to cities other than \nMecca and Medina and whether he has relatives in Saudi Arabia.  \n1409.  The  CBP  officers  searched  his  luggage  and  seized  his  electronics.    Upon \ninformation and belief, Defendants downloaded and made copies of the information on his \nelectronic devices without his consent.  \n1410.  On  another  occasion,  at  Abu  Dhabi  International  Airport,  CBP  officers \ninterrogated Mr. Elamin about his family members in Sudan, including his brother, and asked \nfor all of their names, whether they have children, and whether they travel out of Sudan.  \n1411.  CBP officers also interrogated Mr. Elamin about which mosque he attends and \nasked about his activities at the mosque.  \n1412.  Mr. Elamin was interrogated for approximately two or more hours and he \nmissed his flight back to the United States.  CBP officers set up a video camera and recorded \nthe interrogation.  \n1413.  Oftentimes, Mr. Elamin’s travel companions receive the same treatment just \nbecause they are traveling with him.  \n1414.  On one occasion, Mr. Elamin arrived at Dulles International Airport for an \ninternational trip to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.  \n1415.  Mr. Elamin was traveling with six other travel companions.  \n213 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 214 of 268\n1416.  Upon  presenting  themselves  to  the  airline  representative  at  the  Turkish \nAirlines ticket country, the airline representative informed the group that they would all be \nsubjected to additional screening because of Mr. Elamin.  \n1417.  Once  Mr.  Elamin  and  his  travel  companions  arrived  at  the  TSA  security \ncheckpoint, they provided their boarding passes and identification documents to the TSA \nagent stationed at the entrance to the TSA security checkpoint.   \n1418.  Mr. Elamin and his travel companions were all subjected to an extensive and \nlengthy screening, an invasive pat down including a search of their groin area, an extensive \nsearch of all their personal belongings and chemical residue testing of their person and their \nbelongings in public view at the TSA checkpoint.   \n1419.  Mr. Elamin felt ashamed and humiliated in front of his travel companions \nbecause they were treated as “known or suspected terrorists” because of their relationship \nor association with him, and because they were traveling with him. \n1420.  As a result of the above-described experiences, Mr. Elamin ensures those \ntraveling with him, including his family members, have separate reservations so they are not \nsubjected to enhanced screening and lengthy delays.  \n1421.  Some of Mr. Elamin’s travel companions have also told him that they did not \nwant to reserve their tickets on the same reservation as Mr. Elamin to avoid the potential of \nbeing subjected to similar treatment by Defendants when they book their ticket on the same \nreservation as Mr. Elamin. \n1422.  Moreover, Mr. Elamin is discouraged from traveling because of his watchlist \ndesignation.  \n214 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 215 of 268\n1423.  Mr.  Elamin,  as  part  of  his  sincerely-held  religious  beliefs,  routinely \nvolunteered as a chaplain at Jessup Correctional Institution in Maryland (“Jessup”) where he \nled prayers and mentored Muslim inmates.   \n1424.  Around  three  or  four  years  ago,  Mr.  Elamin  reapplied  to  continue  these \nservices and was denied. \n1425.  Prison officials informed Mr. Elamin that they denied him in connection with \nhis travel issues.   \n1426.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Jessup  and  its  employees  have  access  to \ninformation on the TSDB, and upon filing his application to continue serving as a volunteer \nchaplain at the institution, Jessup officials learned about Mr. Elamin’s status in the TSDB as \na “known or suspected terrorist.”  \n1427.  Upon information and belief, based on the information that Jessup officials \nobtained  in  connection  with  Mr.  Elamin  from  the  TSDB,  Jessup  denied  Mr.  Elamin’s \napplication to continue volunteering as a chaplain at the facility. \n1428.  Mr. Elamin has filed a DHS TRIP inquiry.  He has received a letter as described \nin Paragraph 217 and was assigned a redress control number. \n1429.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Elamin remains on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist. \nPlaintiff Hassan Shirwa \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n1430.  Hassan Shirwa is a 71-year-old United States citizen who regularly travels to \nKenya to visit his family.  \n1431.  Since approximately 2016, because of Mr. Shirwa’s watchlist designation, he is \nregularly subjected to enhanced screening, unreasonable delays and interrogations.    \n215 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 216 of 268\n1432.  As of the date of this filing, Mr. Shirwa is on the No Fly List and as a result, he \nis prohibited from flying through United States airspace. \n1433.  As a result, he is currently stranded in Kenya, and unable to return home in \nthe United States. \n1434.  Mr. Shirwa was first denied boarding to the United States in June 2016.  \n1435.  Upon arrival at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Kenya, he was told by \nan airline representative that he was on the No Fly List and he was therefore not permitted \nto fly back to his home in the United States. \n1436.  Because of his designation as a “known or suspected terrorist” on the No Fly \nList, Mr. Shirwa was stranded abroad in Kenya for approximately one year. \n1437.  Mr. Shirwa was finally able to board a flight to return home in the United States \nin June 2017.  \n1438.  However, when Mr. Shirwa arrived at his connection in Frankfurt Airport, \nafter presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, Mr. Shirwa had to \nwait while the airline representative obtained clearance from DHS for Mr. Shirwa to board \nhis flight. \n1439.  His boarding pass was stamped with the “SSSS” designation on it, indicating \nthat, although it appeared that he may have been removed from the No Fly List, he was still \ndesignated by Defendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n1440.  When Mr. Shirwa finally arrived at Dulles International Airport, CBP officers \ndetained Mr. Shirwa for approximately one hour, searched his belongings, and forced him to \nmiss his flight to San Diego and spend the night.   \n216 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 217 of 268\n1441.  The next day, Mr. Shirwa returned to Dulles International Airport for his flight \nto San Diego International Airport.   \n1442.  Mr. Shirwa was not able to check-in online or at the passport kiosk.  Instead, \nhe was directed to an airline representative for further assistance. \n1443.  At  the  ticket  counter,  after  a  delay,  and  after  the  airline  representative \nobtained clearance from Defendants, Mr. Shirwa received his boarding pass. Mr. Shirwa’s \nboarding pass was stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he is designated as \na “known or suspected” terrorist. \n1444.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subjected Mr. Shirwa to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive pat \ndown, an extensive search of all his personal belongings and chemical residue testing of his \nperson and belongings at the TSA security checkpoint, and in public view.  \n1445.  On September 24, 2017, Mr. Shirwa arrived at San Diego International Airport \nfor an international trip to Kenya.  \n1446.  He was prevented from checking in online or at the kiosk in the airport.  \nRather, he was directed to an airline representative for further assistance.   \n1447.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, the \nairline representative was unable to print Mr. Shirwa’s boarding pass. \n1448.  Mr. Shirwa had to wait while the airline representative called Defendants in \norder to obtain clearance to print his boarding pass and allow him to board his flight. \n1449.  Mr. Shirwa was subjected to an extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of all his personal \n217 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 218 of 268\nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings in public view at \nthe TSA checkpoint.   \n1450.  Mr. Shirwa felt ashamed and humiliated, especially because he was treated as \na “known or suspected terrorist” in public view.  \n1451.  When Mr. Shirwa arrived at Dulles International Airport for his connecting \nflight, he was forced to exit the sterile area of the airport and go through the TSA security \ncheckpoint again, despite having cleared security in San Diego with no issues.  \n1452.  Mr. Shirwa experienced the same treatment at Dulles International Airport \nthat he received at San Diego International Airport.  \n1453.  On December 15, 2018, Mr. Shirwa attempted to check-in online for his return \nflight to the United States with Lufthansa.  \n1454.  When he was unable to check-in online, he called Lufthansa and the airline \nrepresentative informed Mr. Shirwa they did not know the reason why he was unable to \ncheck-in.  \n1455.  Mr. Shirwa then located an unread letter in his e-mail account from DHS, dated \nMay  9,  2017,  and  stated,  “It  has  been  determined  that  [Mr.  Shirwa]  is  on  the  U.S. \nGovernment’s No Fly List because [he] has been identified as an individual who ‘may be a \nthreat to civil aviation or national security.” \n1456.  Mr. Shirwa was forced to once again cancel his return flight to the United \nStates.  \n1457.  Since this ordeal, because of Mr. Shirwa’s watchlist designation and status on \nthe No Fly List, Mr. Shirwa is once again unable to return home in the United States and \nremains stranded abroad. \n218 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 219 of 268\n1458.  Mr. Shirwa’s attorneys contacted the United States embassy in Kenya and the \nOffice  of  Overseas  Citizen  Services  for  assistance.  However,  both  refused  to  assist  in \nrepatriation and referred his attorneys to TSA.  \n1459.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Shirwa was added to the No Fly List after he \nleft the United States, and accordingly he was unable to board a flight to return to his home \nin the United States. \n1460.  Mr. Shirwa has filed a DHS TRIP inquiry.  He has received a letter as described \nin Paragraph 217 and was assigned a redress control number.  \n1461.  Upon  information  and  belief, Mr.  Shirwa  remains  on  Defendants’ federal \nterrorist watchlist and the No Fly List.  \nPlaintiff Imad Kadoumi \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n1462.  Every time Imad Kadoumi travels by air, his boarding passes for his flights are \nroutinely stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he has been designated by \nDefendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n1463.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass. \n1464.

Moreover,  oftentimes the  people  that  Mr.  Kadoumi  travels  with  are  also \ntreated as “known or suspected terrorists” just because they are traveling with him. \n1468.  Whenever Mr. Kadoumi arrives in the United States from international trips, \nCBP officers check everyone’s passports as they deplane until they identify him. \n1469.  The CBP officers then escort him from the gate to an interrogation room where \nhe is detained and interrogated.  All of his personal belongings are also searched. \n1470.  Additionally, whenever Mr. Kadoumi has electronics in his possession, CBP \nofficers  confiscate  his  electronics  and  upon  information  and  belief,  download  the \ninformation from them, including his laptop and his cell phone, without his consent. \n1471.

Imam Al-Sahlani was prevented from checking in online or at the kiosk in the \nairport. Rather, he was directed to a representative at the airline check-in counter for \nfurther assistance. \n1502.  When he went to the airline representative at the counter to obtain his \nboarding pass, the airline representative was unable to print it. \n1503.  Imam Al-Sahlani had to wait until the airline representative called \nDefendants to obtain clearance to print his boarding pass and allow him to board his flight. \n1504.  When Imam Al-Sahlani finally received his boarding pass, it had the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it, indicating that Defendants have labeled him as a “known or suspected \nterrorist.” \n1505.  Once Imam Al-Sahlani reached the security line and upon seeing the “SSSS” \ndesignation on his boarding pass, TSA agents took him out of the line and required him to \nundergo an extra security check. \n1506.  Imam Al-Sahlani had to wait while TSA called a supervisor. \n1507.  After the supervisor was called, Imam Al-Sahlani was taken to a private room \nfor a search. There, Imam Al-Sahlani was subjected to an extensive and lengthy screening \nand an invasive full body pat down, including an extensive search of his person and \nchemical testing. \n1508.  This intensive screening caused Imam Al-Sahlani to experience humiliation \nand physical pain, especially given his age. \n224 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 225 of 268\n1509.  When Imam Al-Sahlani arrived at the gate, five or six TSA agents were \nwaiting for him. \n1510.  Imam Al-Sahlani was taken aside and required to undergo a similar search of \nhis person and belongings before being allowed to board the flight, even though he had \nalready cleared security. This screening was conducted in public view. \n1511.  Upon arrival in New York, before the passengers deplaned, the pilot \nannounced over the PA system that passengers should remain on the plane and stay seated. \n1512.  Imam Al-Sahlani was approached by multiple agents at his seat on the plane. \n1513.  After CBP agents confirmed Imam Al-Sahlani’s identity, the agents escorted \nhim out of the plane while all the plane passengers looked on. \n1514.  The agents took Imam Al-Sahlani to a private room, where he was detained \nfor approximately two to three hours. \n1515.  While in detention, the agents ordered Imam Al-Sahlani to give them the \npasswords to his phones and computer and took Imam Al-Sahlani’s unlocked phones out of \nhis sight. \n1516.  Defendants searched through Imam Al-Sahlani’s cell phones and other \nelectronics, and upon information and belief, downloaded the data from each device \nwithout his consent. \n1517.  The agents also made copies of all documents Imam Al-Sahlani had with him \nand held his passport for the remainder of the time he was detained. \n1518.  Prior to being released, Imam Al-Sahlani CBP officers interrogated him about \nhis Islamic religious beliefs and practices. \n225 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 226 of 268\n1519.  Imam Al-Sahlani is routinely questioned by CBP officers about his religion \nupon re-entering the country. These questions include questions about members of his \ncongregation, the funding sources for his religious foundation, and his work as an Imam \nproviding religious services. \n1520.  On at least one occasion when Imam Al-Sahlani was taken off the plane for an \ninterrogation by FBI agents after an international flight, an FBI agent identified themselves \nas an FBI agent and told Imam Al-Sahlani, “We know about you more than you know about \nyourself.” \n1521.  On at least one occasion when traveling internationally, Imam Al-Sahlani was \nnot permitted to walk to the TSA security line on his own and was required to be escorted \nby an airline representative. \n1522.  In or around 2018, Imam Al-Sahlani arrived at John F. Kennedy Airport for a \ndomestic flight to Detroit. \n1523.  Once again Imam Al-Sahlani was unable to check in online or at the kiosk in \nthe airport. Rather, he was directed to a representative at the airline check-in counter for \nfurther assistance. \n1524.  When he went to the airline representative at the counter to obtain his \nboarding pass, the airline representative was unable to print Imam Al-Sahlani’s boarding \npass. Instead, Imam Al-Sahlani was delayed until the airline representative called \nDefendants in order to obtain clearance to print his boarding pass and allow him to board \nhis flight. \n1525.  When Imam Al-Sahlani finally received his boarding pass, it had “SSSS” \nprinted on it. \n226 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 227 of 268\n1526.  Once Imam Al-Sahlani reached the security line, TSA agents took him out of \nthe line and required him to undergo an extra security check. \n1527.  Imam Al-Sahlani had to wait, in public view, until TSA called a supervisor. \n1528.  After the supervisor was called, Imam Al-Sahlani was taken aside. There, \nImam Al-Sahlani was required to undergo an invasive full-body pat-down and chemical test \nof his person and his belongings. \n1529.  When Imam Al-Sahlani arrived at the gate, multiple TSA agents were waiting \nfor him. \n1530.  Before being allowed to board the flight, Imam Al-Sahlani was taken aside \nand required to undergo a search of his person and luggage that used an Airport Police Dog \neven though he already cleared security.  This humiliating screening was done in public \nview.  \n1531.  When Imam Al-Sahlani arrived at Wayne County Airport for his return flight \non January 9, 2019, he experienced the same inability to obtain his boarding pass and had \nto again wait for the airline representative to make a call-in order to print his boarding \npass. \n1532.  Once he obtained his boarding pass, Imam Al-Sahlani was required to \nundergo a full search of his body and person by agents upon going to the TSA Security Line. \n1533.  Once he was allowed to go to the gate for his flight, he was required to \nundergo another search, in public, before being permitted to board his flight. \n1534.  Imam Al-Sahlani flies at least once a month to Detroit as part of his work as \nan Imam. Imam Al-Sahlani experiences anxiety before each trip in anticipation of \nheightened scrutiny because of his status on Defendant’s federal terrorist watchlist and is \n227 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 228 of 268\nrequired to arrive at the airport far in advance of his flight so that he does not miss it due to \ndelays. \n1535.  Imam Al-Sahlani applied for Global Entry and was denied. Upon information \nand belief, his application and request for reconsideration were both denied due to his \ninclusion on the federal terrorist watchlist. \n1536.  This heightened scrutiny has caused Imam Al-Sahlani to feel afraid and \nembarrassed to fly. \n1537.  As a prominent Imam, Imam Al-Sahlani receives invitations to travel to \nvarious countries but rejects such invitations, because he does not want to undergo delays, \ndetention, interrogation and public humiliation as he has in the past.  \n1538.  Imam Al-Sahlani has not performed hajj for six years, in large part because he \nis afraid of traveling and does not want to go through the humiliation and detention that is \ncaused because of his status on Defendants federal terrorist watchlist.   \n1539.  Imam Al-Sahlani wants to perform hajj to fulfill his sincerely-held religious \nbeliefs but is unable to do so because of Defendants.  \n1540.  Imam Al-Sahlani wants to accept international travel invitations but is unable \nto do so because of his status on Defendants’ federal terrorist watchlist.   \n1541.  Imam Al-Sahlani has been forced to miss multiple flights because of the \ndelays. \n1542.  In one instance flying back from Toronto with family members, the delays \ncaused Imam Al-Sahlani to be unable to take his return flight back to the United States until \nthree days later.  \n228 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 229 of 268\n1543.  During those three days, Imam Al-Sahlani had to pay for a hotel and rental \ncar out-of-pocket for himself and his family members. \n1544.  The later flight caused Imam Al-Sahlani to miss work, and members of his \ncongregation who sought his assistance were unable to do so for those three days. \n1545.  When Imam Al-Sahlani travels with his wife and teenage child, they are also \nunable to print their boarding passes and are forced to go through an intensive search of \ntheir person and luggage. His family travel companions are treated like “known or \nsuspected terrorists” and subjected to substantially-similar screening process that Imam \nAl-Sahlani receives.  \n1546.  Imam Al-Sahlani’s young children, including his child who has undergone \nsimilar scrutiny when traveling with Imam Al-Sahlani, no longer feel comfortable and avoid \ntraveling with him, because they do not want to witness or be subjected to similar scrutiny. \n1547.  In July 2014, Imam Al-Sahlani filed a DHS TRIP inquiry.  He received a letter \nin January 2015 as described in Paragraph 217 and was assigned a redress control number. \n1548.  Upon information and belief, Imam Al-Sahlani remains on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist \nCOUNT I \nVIOLATION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT – PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n \n1549.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n1550.  Defendants have placed Plaintiffs’ names in the Terrorist Screening Database. \n1551.  Defendants have placed Plaintiffs’ names in TSA and CBP watchlists generated \nby amorphous, unreliable, and high-risk targeting rules, such as the Quiet Skies or Silent \nPartner Selectee List. \n229 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 230 of 268\n1552.  As described above, Plaintiffs have experienced economic, reputational, and \nliberty harms due to  the “invasive additional screening and  other liberty-constraining \nactivities when they fly or reenter the country at a land border or port.”  Elhady v. Piehota, \n303 F. Supp. 3d 453, 464 (E.D. Va. 2017).  Plaintiffs have been “detained for hours while they \nare searched and questioned.”  Id.  This “screening has caused them to avoid travel.”  Id. \n1553.  As described above, Plaintiffs have experienced economic, reputational, and \nliberty harms due to Defendants’ placement of their names on the watchlist.  Plaintiffs’ \n“status in the TSDB has been disseminated to third parties outside the relevant federal \nagencies and airlines, including state and local authorities, courts, foreign governments, gun \nsellers, banks, and car dealers.”  Id. at 465.  In fact, “[d]issemination of the Watch List may be \nso widespread that it is tantamount to public disclosure, even if only distributed to other \ngovernment and private entities that need the information for official objectives.”  Id. at 465. \n1554.  As  described  above,  the  stigma  caused  by  Plaintiffs  being  placed  on  the \nwatchlist have caused Plaintiffs injury in the form of lost jobs and business opportunities, \nfailure to get approval for regulatory and employment licenses, the inability to obtain \napproval to purchase a handgun, injury to social and familial relationships, refusal to serve \nthem at restaurants, harm, delay to the immigration status of family members, loss of bank \nand Western Union accounts, and the inability to volunteer and provide religious education \nand ministry at prisons. \n1555.  Each  of  the  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful \npermanent residents, and foreign nationals only learned that he or she was placed on the \nfederal terrorist watchlist after  being added on the federal terrorist watchlist and suffering \nharm as a result. \n230 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 231 of 268\n1556.  Plaintiffs’  experiences  are  substantially  similar  to  thousands  of  other \nAmericans and foreign nationals on the No Fly, Selectee, Expanded Selectee, TSDB, Quiet \nSkies/Silent Partner Selectee, and other rules-based terrorist screening lists.  Plaintiffs \nexperiences  are  indictive  of  Defendants’  current  practices  and  policies.    Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs bring this procedural due process challenge both as-applied to themselves, and \nfacially to the category of watchlisted persons who have not been arrested, charged, or \nconvicted of a terrorism-related offense.  \n1557.  Defendants’ actions as described above in refusing to provide Plaintiffs and \nsimilarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals with \nany  notice  of  their  placement  has  deprived  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals of constitutionally protected \nliberty interests. \n1558.  Defendants’ actions in nominating Plaintiffs and similarly situated American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals to the federal terrorist watchlist \nblatantly violate the requirement that “nominations must not be solely based on race, \nethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment protected activities.”  49 \nU.S.C. § 114(h)(3). \n1559.  Even when a nomination is not “solely” based on race, ethnicity, national \norigin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment protected activities, Defendants consider \nand rely on those protected traits as factors supporting placement on federal terrorist \nwatchlists.  Defendants considered and relied upon one or more of these impermissible \nfactors in placing Plaintiffs and similarly American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and \nforeign nationals on federal terrorist watchlists. \n231 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 232 of 268\n1560.  Defendants  who  contributed  to  the  placement  of  Plaintiffs  and  similarly \nsituated American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals on the federal \nterrorist  watchlist  knew  that  their  actions  violated  clearly  established  federal  and \nconstitutional law. \n1561.  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful  permanent \nresidents, and foreign nationals have a liberty interest in traveling free from unreasonable \nburdens within, to, and from the United States, including through land border crossings and \nover U.S. air space.  Defendants have deprived Plaintiffs and similarly situated American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals of their right to travel on equal \nterms as other travelers.  Defendants have deprived Plaintiffs and other similarly situated \nindividuals of their liberty interest in traveling free from unreasonable burdens. \n1562.  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful  permanent \nresidents, and foreign nationals have a right to be free from false government stigmatization \nas  individuals  who  are  “known  or  suspected  to  be”  terrorists,  or  who  are  otherwise \nassociated with terrorist activity.   Defendants have officially imposed on Plaintiffs and \nsimilarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals the \nstigmatizing label of “known or suspected terrorists” without a constitutionally adequate \nlegal mechanism for doing so.  Defendants have then disseminated the stigmatizing label to \nforeign, state and local government entities and private partners. \n1563.  Even Plaintiffs who are neither United States citizens nor present in the United \nStates have liberty rights.  Ibrahim v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 669 F.3d 983, 995 (9th Cir. \n2012).  Likewise, United States citizens in the United States have a legally protected interest \n232 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 233 of 268\nin their immediate family’s ability to freely travel to the United States.  Trump v. Hawaii, 138 \nS. Ct. 2392, 2416 (2018). \n1564.  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful  permanent \nresidents, and foreign nationals have a liberty interest in nonattainder (i.e. the interest \nagainst being singled out for punishment without trial).  Defendants’ actions have singled \nout Plaintiffs and others similarly situated for punishments that include, but are not limited \nto, inability to travel by air, unreasonable burdens placed upon travel, false association with \na  list  of  individuals  suspected  of  terrorism,  handcuffing  and  detention  as  “prisoners,” \ndeprivation of the Second Amendment right to bear arms, unreasonable searches and \nseizures of electronic devices, and discriminatory targeting on the basis of race, ethnicity, \nnational origin, and religion. \n1565.  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful  permanent \nresidents,  and  foreign  nationals  have  been  burdened  or  prevented  from  boarding \ncommercial flights, have been burdened or prevented from entering the United States at land \nborder  crossings,  have  had  their  bank  or  Western  Union  accounts  closed,  have  been \nprevented from making wire transfers at financial institutions, have had their citizenship \napplications  delayed  indefinitely  due  to  an  “FBI  name  check,”  and  have  lost  lucrative \neconomic opportunities, credentials, and employment.  Plaintiffs have suffered from other \nforms of financial harm.  \n1566.  All  citizens,  lawful  permanent  residents,  and  foreign  nationals  adversely \naffected by the terrorist watchlist are entitled to a constitutionally adequate legal mechanism \nthat affords them full notice of the reasons and bases for their placement and a meaningful \nopportunity to contest their continued inclusion.  Yet Defendants have failed to provide the \n233 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 234 of 268\nmost basic ingredients of due process, which is notice and a meaningful opportunity to be \nheard.  \n1567.  Defendants shield their watchlist decisions from review, and do not provide \nPlaintiffs or any similarly affected individuals an impartial tribunal which can substantively \nevaluate the propriety of (a) the Defendants’ watchlist inclusion standards, (b) Defendants’ \nadherence to their own standards, (c) the facts purportedly justifying Plaintiffs’ placement \non  the  TSDB,  classification  within  the  TSDB,  or  placement  on  other  federal  terrorist \nwatchlists, (d) the lack of opportunity to offer any clarification or correction of those facts by \nPlaintiffs, or (e) the constitutionality of Defendants’ nomination or redress processes. \n1568.  By imposing on Plaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens, lawful \npermanent residents, and foreign nationals the stigmatizing label of “known or suspected \nterrorists” or “terrorists,” and by failing to provide Plaintiffs and others similarly situated \nwith a constitutionally adequate legal mechanism to challenge that designation, Defendants \nhave  deprived  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful  permanent \nresidents, and foreign nationals of their protected liberty interests.    \n1569.  These protected liberty interests include military base access, TWIC card \naccess, and TSA Precheck and Global Entry Access.  Although the Government claims that \nthese are non-reviewable security determinations, the reporting of information that informs \nthe security determination is not unreviewable and is actionable if done in an illegal or \ndiscriminatory manner.  Rattigan v. Holder, 689 F.3d 764, 767 (D.C. Cir. 2012).  Moreover, \nthe Supreme Court has stated that the power to exclude civilians from a military base is \n“limited by the Constitution and by the standard administrative requirement that ‘[the \n234 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 235 of 268\nGovernment] must not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner,’” United States v. Albertini, \n472 U.S. 675, 694 (1985).   \n1570.  Defendants  knew  at  the  time  they  acted  unlawfully  that  Supreme  Court \nprecedent required that, whenever a citizen is deprived of a liberty interest, the federal \ngovernment must at least provide the deprived with some form of notice that a deprivation \noccurred. \n1571.  Defendants have violated the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and similarly \nsituated  American  citizens,  lawful  permanent  residents,  and  foreign  nationals  without \naffording them due process of law.  Defendants will continue to do so into the future if \nPlaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign \nnationals are not afforded the relief demanded below. \n1572.  By  placing  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful \npermanent residents, and foreign nationals on the federal terrorist watchlist, Defendants \nhave caused them an actual, imminent and irreparable injury that cannot be undone through \nmonetary remedies. \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief \nthis Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT II \nVIOLATION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT – SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n \n1573.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n235 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 236 of 268\n1574.  Substantive  due  process  protects  Americans’  freedom  from  government \naction which infringes upon their fundamental constitutional rights.  Government action \nwhich infringes upon these rights cannot be arbitrary and must be narrowly tailored to serve \na compelling government interest. \n1575.  Defendants  have  placed  Plaintiffs  on  the  watchlist  despite  lacking  any \nreasonable suspicion that Plaintiffs are known, suspected, or potential terrorists. \n1576.  Plaintiffs’ experience is substantially similar to thousands of other Americans \nand foreign nationals on the watchlist and reflects Defendants’ current practices and policies. \n1577.  Defendants’ actions in nominating Plaintiffs and similarly situated American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals to the federal terrorist watchlist \nblatantly violate the requirement that “’nominations’ must not be solely based on race, \nethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment protected activities.”  49 \nU.S.C. § 114(h)(3). \n1578.  Even when a nomination is not “solely” based on race, ethnicity, national \norigin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment protected activities, Defendants consider \nand rely on those protected traits as factors supporting placement on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist.  Defendants considered and relied upon one or more of these impermissible \nfactors in placing Plaintiffs and similarly American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and \nforeign nationals on the federal terrorist watchlist. \n1579.  Defendants’ consideration of and reliance on the suspect classifications of \nrace, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, as well as First Amendment protected \nactivities, throughout the federal terrorist watchlisting system has placed an undue burden \non Plaintiffs’ fundamental rights to be free from discrimination. \n236 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 237 of 268\n1580.  Defendants’ dissemination of the watchlist to the gun market to hinder and \npreclude Plaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and \nforeign  nationals  from  purchasing  guns  has  placed  an  undue  burden  on  Plaintiffs’ \nfundamental right to keep and bear arms.  See McDonald v. City of Chicago, Ill., 561 U.S. 742, \n778 (2010). \n1581.  Defendants’ policy of subjecting Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated watchlisted \nAmerican citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals to has placed an undue \nburden on Plaintiffs’ fundamental right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.  \n1582.  By placing Plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist,  lawful  permanent  residents,  and  foreign  nationals  on  the  federal  terrorist \nwatchlist, Defendants have harmed them as explained in Count I, above. \n1583.  Defendants lack a compelling interest in placing innocent persons, particularly \nthose with no prior terrorism related criminal record and no probable cause for suspicion of \nterrorism related crimes, on the federal terrorist watchlist. \n1584.  Defendants’ watchlist lacks a compelling interest insofar as their true purpose \nis to provide law enforcement with a tool to harass and intimidate American Muslims, to \ntrack such persons, and coerce American Muslims into becoming informants. \n1585.  Defendants’ watchlists are also not narrowly tailored insofar as the federal \nterrorist watchlists are entirely and demonstrably ineffectual and obvious alternatives exist. \nThe Defendants, for example, have never placed a person who committed a violent act of \nterrorism inside the United States on the No Fly List prior to the terrorist act. \n1586.  Defendants’  actions  in  placing  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals on the federal terrorist watchlist, \n237 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 238 of 268\nofficially imposing on Plaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent \nresidents, and foreign nationals the stigmatizing label of “known or suspected terrorists,” \nand widely disseminating the stigmatizing label to numerous governmental and private \npartners, are arbitrary and capricious, shock the conscience, violate the decencies of civilized \nconduct and are so brutal and offensive that they do not comport with the traditional ideas \nof fair play and decency. \n1587.  Because Plaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent \nresidents, and foreign nationals have not been charged with any violent or terrorism-related \ncrimes and are United States citizens, Plaintiffs challenge their placement and the placement \nof others similarly situated individuals on the federal terrorist watchlist on a broad, as-\napplied basis. \n1588.  Plaintiffs’ substantive due process challenge is also facial. \n1589.  Defendants  have  thus  violated  Plaintiffs’  constitutional  rights  and  the \nconstitutional  rights  of  other  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful  permanent \nresidents and foreign nationals without affording them due process of law.  Defendants will \ncontinue to do so into the future if Plaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens, lawful \npermanent residents, and foreign nationals are not afforded the relief demanded below. \n1590.  By  placing  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful \npermanent residents, and foreign nationals on the federal watchlist, Defendants have caused \nthem an actual, imminent and irreparable injury that cannot be undone through monetary \nremedies. \n238 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 239 of 268\nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief \nthis Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT III \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. § 706 – DHS TRIP \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n \n1591.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n1592.  Defendants’ placement of Plaintiffs on the terrorist watchlist, placement of \nPlaintiffs  on  the  Quiet  Skies/Silent  Partner  Selectee  List  and  other  rules-based  terror \ntargeting lists, and subsequent DHS TRIP and TSC determinations regarding Plaintiffs’ \nwatchlist status, constitute agency actions. \n1593.  Plaintiffs and other similarly situated individuals are not required to exhaust \nthe DHS TRIP process in connection with any watchlist status, under the holding in Darby v. \nCisneros, 509 U.S. 137 (1993).  See Mohamed v. Holder, 995 F. Supp. 2d 520, 533-35 (E.D.

Admin., 323 F. Supp. 3d 148, 156 (D. Mass. 2018) (following Mohamed); \nKovac v. Wray, 3:18-cv-110, Dkt. No. 12, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2019 WL 1057935, at *12-14 (N. \nD. Tex. Mar. 5, 2019). \n1594.  Defendants’  actions  in  placing  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals on the federal terrorist watchlist, \nofficially imposing on Plaintiffs the stigmatizing label of “known or suspected terrorists,” \ndisseminating the stigmatizing label to governmental and private partners, and providing no \n239 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 240 of 268\nconstitutionally adequate avenue for redress, were and are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, otherwise not in accordance with law, and contrary to constitutional rights, \npower, privilege, or immunity, and should be set aside as unlawful pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n1595.  Defendants’ actions in nominating Plaintiffs and similarly situated American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals to the federal terrorist watchlist \nblatantly violate the requirement that “’nominations’ must not be solely based on race, \nethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment protected activities.”  49 \nU.S.C. § 114(h)(3). \n1596.  Even when a nomination is not “solely” based on race, ethnicity, national \norigin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment protected activities, Defendants consider \nand rely on those protected traits as factors supporting placement on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist.  Defendants considered and relied upon one or more of these impermissible \nfactors in placing Plaintiffs and similarly American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and \nforeign nationals on the federal terrorist watchlist. \n1597.  Defendants have failed to provide Plaintiffs and similarly situated American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals, who have been unreasonably \nburdened or denied boarding on commercial flights due to their placement on the federal \nterrorist watchlist, with a constitutionally adequate mechanism that (a) affords them notice \nof the reasons and bases for their placement on the federal terrorist watchlist and (b) \nprovides a meaningful opportunity to contest their continued inclusion on the federal \nterrorist  watchlist.   Defendants’ action is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, \notherwise not in accordance with law, and contrary to constitutional rights, power, privilege, \nor immunity, and should be set aside as unlawful pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n240 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 241 of 268\n1598.  Because Plaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent \nresidents, and foreign nationals do not present a security threat to commercial aviation, \nDefendants’ actions as described above in including Plaintiffs and other similarly situated \nindividuals on the federal terrorist watchlist unreasonably burdens or prevents them from \nboarding commercial flights or entering the United States across the border, are arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, otherwise not in accordance with law, and contrary to \nconstitutional rights, power, privilege, or immunity, and should be set aside as unlawful \npursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n1599.  By  placing  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful \npermanent residents, and foreign nationals on the federal watchlist, Defendants caused them \nan  actual,  imminent  and  irreparable  injury  that  cannot  be  undone  through  monetary \nremedies.  \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief \nthis Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT IV \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. §, 706 – NCIC \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n \n1600.   The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n1601.  Defendants share watchlist information, including Plaintiffs’ identities and \npersonal information, through the National Criminal Information Center (“NCIC”).  The \nGovernment’s purported authority for doing so is 28 C.F.R. § 20.20 and 28 U.S.C. § 534.   \n241 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 242 of 268\n1602.  Neither 28 C.F.R. § 20.20 and 28 U.S.C. § 534, nor any other provision, allows \nsharing non-criminal information such as watchlist information.  \n1603.  The  Government  lacks  the  statutory  and  regulatory  authority  to  share \nPlaintiffs’ information through the NCIC. \n1604.  The  Government’s  sharing  of  Plaintiffs’  information  is  contrary  to  rules \npromulgated through notice and comment. \n1605.   The Government’s sharing of Plaintiff’s authority is “arbitrary, capricious, an \nabuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” in violation of 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n1606.  The Government’s sharing of Plaintiff’s authority is “in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” in violation of 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n1607.  The Government’s sharing of Plaintiff’s authority is “without observance of \nprocedure required by law,” in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief \nthis Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT V \nVIOLATION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT – EQUAL PROTECTION \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n \n1608.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n1609.  Defendants’  actions  in  placing  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals on the federal terrorist watchlist, \n242 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 243 of 268\nofficially imposing on Plaintiffs the stigmatizing label of “known or suspected terrorists,” \ndisseminating the stigmatizing label to governmental and private partners, and providing no \nconstitutionally adequate avenue for redress, are discriminatory and constitute actions that \ntarget individuals for distinctive and adverse treatment on the basis of constitutionally \nprotected traits and activities.   \n1610.  As a matter of policy and official practice, Defendants consider at least the \nfollowing traits of Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent \nresidents, and foreign nationals origin as factors for designation as terrorists and inclusion \nin the TSDB and throughout the watchlisting system: national origination from Muslim-\nmajority countries, ethnic origination as Arab or Middle Eastern, travel to Muslim-majority \ncountries,  travel  on  religious  pilgrimages,  learning  Arabic,  attending  mosques,  zakat \ndonations to Muslim charities, the wearing of typical Muslim dress, the frequency of Muslim \nprayer, adherence to sharia law, affiliations with Muslim organizations, family relationships \nto other Muslims, and associations with other Muslims. \n1611.  Defendants selectively apply and enforce watchlist and screening policies to \nindividuals who appear to be or who are known or suspected to be Muslim or Middle Eastern.    \n1612.  The disparate treatment between Muslims and non-Muslims is the result of \nDefendants’ intentional and purposeful discrimination. \n1613.  Plaintiffs’  experiences  are  substantially  similar  to  thousands  of  other \nAmericans and foreign nationals on the watchlist and reflect Defendants’ current practices \nand policies.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs brings this equal protection challenge both as-applied to \nthemselves and facially.  \n243 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 244 of 268\n1614.  Defendants’ actions in nominating Plaintiffs and similarly situated American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals to the federal terrorist watchlist \nblatantly violate the requirement that “’nominations’ must not be solely based on race, \nethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment protected activities.”  49 \nU.S.C. § 114(h)(3). \n1615.  Even when a nomination is not “solely” based on race, ethnicity, national \norigin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment protected activities, Defendants consider \nand rely on those protected traits as factors supporting placement on federal terrorist \nwatchlists.  Defendants considered and relied upon one or more of these impermissible \nfactors in placing Plaintiffs and similarly American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and \nforeign nationals on federal terrorist watchlists. \n1616.  By  placing  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful \npermanent residents, and foreign nationals on federal terrorist watchlists, Defendants have \ntreated them like second-class citizens.   \n1617.  Many of the Watchlisted Plaintiffs have been subjected to interrogations \nabout their religious practices and beliefs, the answers of which, upon information and \nbelief, are factors that were considered in their inclusion to the federal terrorist watchlist. \n1618.  Defendants’ above-described actions were motivated by the race, ethnicity, \nnational origin, religious affiliation, religious exercise, gender, and associations of Plaintiffs \nand similarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals.  \n1619.  Defendants’ above-described actions have had a discriminatory effect upon \nand have disparately impacted Plaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens, lawful \npermanent residents, and foreign nationals who are or who are perceived as Muslim, Arab, \n244 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 245 of 268\nMiddle Eastern, or otherwise belonging to a racial, ethnic, or national origin class associated \nwith Muslim-majority regions of the world.  \n1620.  Defendants’ above-described actions, policies, course of conduct, or pattern of \npractice that mandate, permit, or consider the above-described discriminatory treatment of \nPlaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign \nnationals does not serve a compelling state interest or a legitimate or public purpose, nor are \nthey the least restrictive means or narrowly tailored to achieve any such interest. \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief \nthis Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT VI \nVIOLATION OF THE FOURTH AMENDMENT \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n1621.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n1622.  Plaintiffs assert this Claim against both the official capacity Defendants and \nagainst the Unidentified CBP and FBI Agents in their individual capacities who personally \ndirected  or  carried  out  the  seizure,  confiscation,  searching,  copying,  downloading,  or \nuploading of information from Plaintiffs’ electronic devices. \n1623.  On June 22, 2018, the Supreme Court recognized in Carpenter v. United States, \n138 S. Ct. 2206, 2214 (2018) that: “The Fourth Amendment protects ‘[t]he right of the people \nto be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and \nseizures.’ The basic purpose of this Amendment our cases have recognized, is to safeguard \nthe  privacy  and  security  of  individuals  against  arbitrary  invasions  by  governmental \nofficials....  The Founding generation crafted the Fourth Amendment as a response to the \n245 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 246 of 268\nreviled ‘general warrants' and ‘writs of assistance’ of the colonial era, which allowed British \nofficers to rummage through homes in an unrestrained search for evidence of criminal \nactivity.  Riley v. California, 134 S. Ct. 2473, 2494 (2014)….  Likewise in Riley, the Court \nrecognized the ‘immense storage capacity’ of modern cell phones in holding that police \nofficers must generally obtain a warrant before searching the contents of a phone.”  See also \nUnited States v. Kim, 103 F. Supp. 3d 32, 54 (D.D.C. 2015) (suggesting United States v. Ickes, \n393 F.3d 501 (4th Cir. 2005), holding that manual search of phone contents is not a border \nsearch, is no longer good law in light of Riley ); U.S. v. Kolsuz, 890 F.3d 133, 141 (4th Cir. 2018) \n(suggesting the question of manual searches is open and declining to reach it). \n1624.  As a matter of official policy and practice, and particularly at the border, \nDefendants seize and confiscate watchlisted individuals’ electronic devices.  Defendants \nroutinely do not return the electronic devices to the watchlisted individuals for weeks or \nmonths, if not longer.  See CBP Directive No. 3340-049A) (Ex. 6) \n1625.  As a matter of official policy and practice, and particularly at the border, \nDefendants download and copy the contents of watchlisted individuals’ electronic devices \nonto Defendants’ computers and upload those contents to Defendants’ watchlisting and \nintelligence databases.  Defendants then review that material in a manner which constitutes \na search for Fourth Amendment and other purposes. \n1626.   As a matter of official policy and practice, Defendants’ utilize the contents of \nwatchlisted individuals’ electronic devices as a source of intelligence.  Defendants’ utilize the \ncontents and contacts of watchlisted individuals’ electronic devices to launch investigations \ninto  and  nominate  associates  of  the  watchlisted  individual  for  rules-based  terrorist \nmonitoring and inclusion in the federal terrorist watchlist. \n246 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 247 of 268\n1627.  Defendants lack consent, reasonable suspicion, probable cause, or a warrant \nfor their seizures and searches of watchlisted individuals’ electronic devices.  See United \nStates v. Kolsuz, 185 F. Supp. 3d 843, 853 (E.D. Va. 2016), aff’d, 890 F.3d 133 (4th Cir. 2018), \nas  amended  (May  18,  2018)  (forensic  search  of  computer  is  border  search  requiring \nreasonable suspicion). \n1628.  Defendants lack reasonable suspicion, probable cause, or arrest warrants \nrelated to terrorism crimes that would justify Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated American \ncitizens,  permanent  residents,  and  foreign  nationals’  inclusion  on the  federal  terrorist \nwatchlist.   \n1629.  Defendants’ seizures and searches are unreasonable, unconstitutional, and \nviolate Plaintiffs and other watchlisted individuals’ reasonable expectations of privacy. \n1630.  Defendants and their officers and agents knew that their seizures and searches \nwere  unreasonable,  unconstitutional  under  settled  federal  and  constitutional  law,  and \nviolated Plaintiffs and other watchlisted individuals’ reasonable expectations of privacy at \nthe time they carried out the searches and seizures. \n1631.  Defendants have confiscated Plaintiffs’ electronic devices, copied the devices’ \ncontents,  and  searched  and  utilized  those  contents  for intelligence  and  investigations.  \nDefendants have engaged these seizures and searches solely because Plaintiffs and similarly \nsituated American citizens, permanent residents, and foreign nationals are listed on the \nfederal terrorist watchlist.  \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief \nthis Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \n247 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 248 of 268\nCOUNT VII \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n1632.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n1633.  The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging \nthe freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble.”  U.S. \nConst. amend. I.  These rights “are protected not only against heavy-handed frontal attack, \nbut also from being stifled by more subtle governmental interference.”  Bates v. City of Little \nRock, 361 U.S. 516, 523 (1960).  As the Supreme Court has explained, “associational rights . . \n. can be abridged even by government actions that do not directly restrict individuals' ability \nto associate freely.” Lyng v. Int'l Union, UAW, 485 U.S. 360, 367 n.5 (1988); see AFL-CIO v. FEC, \n333 F.3d 168, 175 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (explaining that compulsory “disclosure of political \naffiliations and activities can impose just as substantial a burden on First Amendment rights \nas can direct regulation”); Baird v. State Bar of Ariz., 401 U.S. 1, 6-7 (1971) (explaining that \n“[w]hen a State seeks to inquire about an individual’s beliefs and associations a heavy burden \nlies upon it to show that the inquiry is necessary to protect a legitimate state interest”). \n1634.  Defendants’ searches and copying are done in pursuit of intelligence and \ninformation about Plaintiffs and similarly situated watchlisted individuals’ communications, \nexpressions, social media activities, and associations.  Their searches through Plaintiffs’ \nphones specifically sought information about Plaintiffs’ expressed speech and personal \nassociations, which are protected by the First Amendment.  See Alasaad v. Nielsen, No. 17-\nCV-11730-DJC, 2018  WL 2170323, at  *23 (D.  Mass.  May 9, 2018) (watchlist plaintiffs \nproperly  asserted  First  Amendment  claim  related  to  border  searches  of  phones  for \nassociational or expressive content).    \n248 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 249 of 268\n1635.  Warrantless seizures and searches of the contents of Plaintiffs’ electronic \ndevices,  including  information  about  Plaintiffs’  associations  and  affiliations,  impose  a \nsignificant or substantial burden on watchlisted individuals’ First Amendment rights to \nexpression and association. \n1636.  Defendants also intend to use that intelligence and information to single out \nPlaintiffs’  and  similarly  situated  watchlisted  individuals’  families,  friends,  coworkers, \ncoreligionists, and other associates for investigation as potential terrorists.   \n1637.  The Government’s search thus “was carried out for the purpose of abridging \nFirst Amendment freedoms,” United States v. Mayer, 503 F.3d 740, 753 (9th Cir. 2007).   \n1638.  Defendants’ actions in burdening Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated watchlisted \nindividuals’ First Amendment rights to expression and association are not supported by a \ncompelling or legitimate state interest.  Defendants lack reasonable suspicion, probable \ncause,  or a  warrant indicating that  the watchlisted individuals are terrorist criminals.  \nIndeed,  Plaintiffs  were not being investigated for any specific reasons concerning any \nspecific threat or crime.  \n1639.  Defendants’ searching and seizing of electronic devices, along with other \npolicies  and  practices  that  Defendants  apply  to  individuals  on  the  watchlist,  make \nwatchlisted individuals’ associations, including family, coworkers, friends, and religious \ncongregants, the target of increased “known or suspected terrorist” scrutiny.  Association \nalone forms the basis for placement on rules-based terrorist monitoring lists, for subjecting \nto enhanced terrorist “SSSS” scrutiny at airports, for referring to secondary inspection and \ndetention at land borders, for delaying and denying visa and immigration benefits, for \ninterrogation about the watchlisted individuals’ practices, and for nomination to the TSDB. \n249 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 250 of 268\n1640.  Defendants have placed an undue burden on Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated \nindividuals’ First Amendment rights to expression and association. \n1641.  Defendants actions in burdening Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated watchlisted \nindividuals’ First Amendment rights to expression and association are not narrowly tailored, \nnot the least restrictive means, and not in furtherance of an appropriate form of means-end \nbalancing to achieve a government interest. \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief \nthis Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT VIII \nVIOLATION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT – SELF-INCRIMINATION  \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n1642.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n1643.  The Fifth Amendment protects the fundamental individual right against self-\nincrimination. \n1644.  Defendants, after seizing Plaintiffs’ electronic devices, have forced them to \nopen those devices, including by providing passwords and by using biometric means such as \nfacial recognition or fingerprints.   \n1645.  Even if the Government had the right to seize and search a device, that does \nnot allow the Government to infringe upon an individual’s other rights.  Matter of Residence \nin Oakland, California, 354 F. Supp. 3d 1010, 2019 WL 176937, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 10, 2019). \n1646.  Requiring the providing of passwords or the use of biometric means such as \nfacial recognition or fingerprints violates the Fifth Amendment.  Id. at *2-4. \n250 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 251 of 268\nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief \nthis Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT IX \nVIOLATION OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n1647.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n1648.  The Second Amendment protects the fundamental individual right to bear \narms. \n1649.  Defendants disseminate the federalist terrorist watchlist with the knowledge \nand intent that law enforcement agencies and providers of background checks will use the \nwatchlist to screen gun purchasers, and thereafter block, hinder, or burden watchlisted \nindividuals in their attempt to obtain guns. \n1650.  Even where a watchlisted individual possesses valid permits to possess and \ncarry firearms, their watchlist status is used as a basis to deny the purchase of firearms. \n1651.  Multiple states and government entities have adopted or considered laws and \npolicies which bar individuals listed on the federal terrorist watchlist from purchasing \nfirearms.   \n1652.  These laws and policies have been encouraged by Defendants.   \n1653.  Because of their watchlist status, Plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals \nhave been blocked, hindered, or burdened from exercising their right to bear arms. \n1654.  Defendants have placed an undue burden on Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated \nindividuals’ Second Amendment right to own firearms. \n251 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 252 of 268\n1655.  Defendants’ actions in burdening Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated watchlisted \nindividuals’ Second Amendment right to own firearms are not supported by a compelling or \nlegitimate state interest, because Defendants lack reasonable suspicion, probable cause, or a \nwarrant that watchlisted individuals are terrorist criminals. \n1656.  Defendants actions in burdening Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated watchlisted \nindividuals’ Second Amendment right to own firearms are not narrowly tailored, not the \nleast  restrictive  means,  and  not  in  furtherance  of  an  appropriate  form  of  means-end \nbalancing to achieve a government interest. \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief \nthis Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT X \nVIOLATION OF THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT –  \nGENERAL INTRUSION OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n1657.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n1658.  This Claim is asserted on behalf of all Plaintiffs against the official capacity \nDefendants,  as  well  as  Unidentified  FBI  Agents  and  Unidentified  CBP  Agents  in  their \nindividual capacities. \n1659.  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et. \nseq., provides that Defendants “shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion” \nunless that burden is the least restrictive means to further a compelling governmental \ninterest.  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb01(a) and (b). \n252 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 253 of 268\n1660.  An  individual’s  exercise  of  religion  is  substantially  burdened  when  the \ngovernment conducts an intrusive inquiry into a person’s religious beliefs as a component of \nofficial government action.  Such inquiries place pressure on the person to modify or violate \ntheir beliefs and singles them out for disfavored treatment.  As the Supreme Court once \nrecognized (with an analysis that applies with greater force post-RFRA), “It is not only the \nconclusions  that  may  be  reached  by  the  [Government]  which  may  impinge  on  rights \nguaranteed by the Religion Clauses, but also the very process of inquiry leading to findings \nand conclusions.”  N.L.R.B. v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U.S. 490, 502 (1979).  A Supreme \nCourt plurality later recognized that government action which requires “inquiry into the \nrecipient's religious views” including details of how “sectarian” those views are “is not only \nunnecessary but also offensive. It is well established, in numerous other contexts, that courts \nshould refrain from trolling through a person’s or institution’s religious beliefs.”  Mitchell v. \nHelms, 530 U.S. 793, 828 (2000). \n1661.  Defendants have policies and practices that require intrusive religious inquiry \nof individuals scooped up in watchlisting surveillance.  Plaintiffs have experienced recurrent \ninquiry into the details of their religious practices, including how religious they are, which \nsubdivision sects of Islam they adhere to, how often they pray, which mosque they attend, \nwho else worships at the mosque, what Islam-related charities they support, what they think \nof jihad, whether they follow sharia law, and other intrusive and detailed questions about \ntheir faith.  These lines of questioning have been conducted by Unidentified CBP and FBI \nofficers, pursuant to policies and practices promulgated by Defendants. \n1662.  Plaintiffs’ practice of Islam is substantially burdened by repeated and intrusive \nGovernment  inquiry into  their  beliefs,  their religious  communities,  and  their  religious \n253 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 254 of 268\npractices.  Plaintiffs are subjected to this disfavored treatment due to Defendants’ policies \nand practices that use the federal watchlisting system to target Muslim communities and \nrely, at least in part, on the details of Plaintiffs’ adherence to the Muslim faith as factors \nsupporting inclusion on the federal terrorist watchlist.  \n1663.  Plaintiffs are subjected to less harsh treatment when they act against their \nsincerely-held religious beliefs, such as by sending their children to Catholic school, or (as \none Plaintiff was specifically told by an unidentified CBP defendant), by declining to wear a \nhijab.  The result of this is that Plaintiffs are pressured by Defendants to go against their \nsincerely-held religious beliefs. \n1664.  Defendants’ placement of Plaintiffs on the federal terrorist watchlist or rules-\nbased lists based upon Plaintiffs’ answers to these lines of questions is not narrowly tailored \nto achieve any compelling governmental interest.   \n1665.  Defendants' unlawful actions have imposed and are imposing an immediate \nand ongoing harm on Plaintiffs and have deprived them of constitutional and statutory \nrights, resulting in damage to their reputations, and material and economic loss.   \n1666.  Absent injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief against the Defendants, \nPlaintiffs and similarly situated individuals have been and will continue to be harmed.  \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief, in addition to damages, in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, \nplus all such other relief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys' fees \nincurred in this action. \n254 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 255 of 268\nCOUNT XI \nVIOLATION OF THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT – UMRAH/HAJJ \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n(as to Plaintiffs Farid Sulayman and Faraz Siddiqui, only) \n1667.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n1668.  This Claim is asserted on behalf of Plaintiff Farid Sulayman and Plaintiff Faraz \nSiddiqui only. \n1669.  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et. \nseq., provides that Defendants \"shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion\" \nunless that burden is the least restrictive means to further a compelling governmental \ninterest.  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb01 (a) and(b). \n1670.  Plaintiff Farid Sulayman holds a sincere religious belief that he personally \nperforms umrah, a religious pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia.  See fn. 10, above.  As a \nreligious leader, it is also part of his sincerely held religious beliefs that lead Muslim pilgrims \nwho wish to perform umrah.  Plaintiff Farid Sulayman's compliance with these beliefs is a \nreligious exercise.   \n1671.  The Defendants’ actions in creating and then placing Plaintiff Farid Sulayman \non the federal terrorist watchlist imposes a substantial burden on Plaintiff Farid Sulayman's \nreligious  exercise  and  similarly  situated  individuals.    Defendants  have  imposed  a \nburdensome, stigmatizing, and public screening process that is discouraging Plaintiff Farid \nSulayman from engaging in umrah in order to avoid the treatment directed at him by \nDefendants.  Defendants' actions have also damaged Plaintiff Farid Sulayman's standing in \nhis community thereby jeopardizing his ability to lead congregations in the future.  Plaintiff \n255 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 256 of 268\nFarid Sulayman intends to lead umrah group in order to fulfill his sincerely held religious \nbeliefs.   \n1672.  Plaintiff Faraz Siddiqui desires to perform hajj, a different form of religious \npilgrimage to Mecca, see fn. 10, above, but has not done so out of fear of the terrorist scrutiny \nand treatment he would receive by Defendants. \n1673.  The federal terrorist watchlist chills Plaintiff Farid Sulayman's and Plaintiff \nFaraz Siddiqui’s religious exercise. \n1674.  The  federal  terrorist  watchlist  is  not  narrowly  tailored  to  achieve  any \ncompelling governmental interest.   \n1675.  The federal terrorist watchlist is not the least restrictive means of furthering \nDefendants' stated interests.   \n1676.  The  United  States  government  has  no  compelling  interest  in  restricting \nPlaintiff Farid Sulayman’s ability to lead pilgrims on a religious rite of passage, umrah.   \n1677.  The  United  States  government  has  no  compelling  interest  in  restricting \nPlaintiff Faraz Siddiqui’s ability to perform the Hajj pilgrimage.  \n1678.  Defendants' unlawful actions are imposing an immediate and ongoing harm \non Plaintiff Farid Sulayman and have caused Plaintiff Farid Sulayman emotional distress, \ndeprivation of his constitutional and statutory rights, damage to his reputation, and material \nand economic loss.   \n1679.  Defendants' unlawful actions are imposing an immediate and ongoing harm \non Plaintiff Faraz Siddiqui and have caused him emotional distress, deprivation of his \nconstitutional and statutory rights, and damage to his reputation. \n256 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 257 of 268\n1680.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Defendants and the federal \nterrorist watchlist, Plaintiff Farid Sulayman, Plaintiff Faraz Siddiqui, and similarly situated \nindividuals have been and will continue to be harmed.  So long as Defendants maintain the \nfederal terrorist watchlist, Plaintiff Farid Sulayman's and Faraz Siddiqui's exercise of their \nreligious  beliefs,  including  performing  hajj  and  leading  umrah,  will  be  substantially \nburdened. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Farid Sulayman and Plaintiff Faraz Siddiqui requests this \nHonorable Court grant declaratory and injunctive relief, in addition to damages, in the form \ndescribed in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief this Court deems just and \nproper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT XII \nVIOLATION OF THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT –  \nINFORMANT PRESSURE \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n(as to Plaintiffs John Doe 2 and Hicham Hall only) \n1681.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n1682.  This Claim is asserted on behalf of Plaintiffs John Doe 2 and Hicham Hall only, \nagainst both the official capacity Defendants and the Unidentified FBI Agents in  their \nindividual capacities. \n1683.  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et. \nseq., provides that Defendants “shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion” \nunless that burden is the least restrictive means to further a compelling governmental \ninterest.  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb01(a) and (b). \n257 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 258 of 268\n1684.  Defendants have placed Plaintiffs Doe 2 on the No Fly List and Hicham on a \nSelective Screening list, at least in part, because of their Muslim religious beliefs.  As \nexplained above, this has caused John Doe 2 and Mr. Hall harm.   \n1685.  As explained above, FBI agents have told John Doe 2 and Mr. Hall that if they \nagree to work as an FBI Informant, their travel issues (including respective watchlist status) \nwill be resolved.  \n1686.  As explained above, working as an informant for the FBI would require John \nDoe 2 and Mr. Hall to violate their sincerely-held religious beliefs. \n1687.  Defendants have forced John Doe 2 and Mr. Hall into an impermissible choice \nbetween  obeying  their  sincerely-held  religious  beliefs  or  continuing  to  experience \nGovernment interrogations related to the Government-imposed punishment of placing them \non the watchlist, which imposes harm on Doe and Hall.   \n1688.  Placing John Doe 2 and Mr. Hall on their respective watchlists, and the related \nrecruitment of Doe 2 and Hall as government informants against the Muslim community, \nimposes a substantial burden on and chills their religious exercise. \n1689.  Defendants’ placement of John Doe 2 and Mr. Hall on the No Fly List or on any \nsubset of the federal terrorist watchlist, is not narrowly tailored to achieve any compelling \ngovernmental interest.   \n1690.  Defendants’ recruitment of John Doe 2 and Mr. Hall as FBI informants is not \nnarrowly tailored to achieve any compelling governmental interest.   \n1691.  Defendants' unlawful actions have imposed and are imposing an immediate \nand ongoing harm on John Doe 2 and Mr. Hall and have deprived them of their constitutional \nand statutory rights, resulting in damage to his reputation, and material and economic loss.   \n258 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 259 of 268\n1692.  None of the Defendants' unlawful actions are narrowly tailored to serve a \ncompelling Government interest. \n1693.  Absent injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief against the Defendants, \nJohn Doe 2, Mr. Hall, and similarly situated individuals have been and will continue to be \nharmed. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs John Doe 2 and Hicham Hall request this Honorable Court \ngrant declaratory and injunctive relief, in addition to damages, in the form described in the \nPrayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief this Court deems just and proper including \ncosts and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT XIII \nVIOLATION OF THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT –  \nINABILITY TO VOLUNTEER AT PRISONS OR JAILS \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n(as to Plaintiff Abdelmoniem Elamin only) \n1694.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein.  \n1695.  This Claim is asserted on behalf of Plaintiff Abdelmoniem Elamin only, against \nonly the official capacity Defendants. \n1696.  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et. \nseq., provides that Defendants “shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion” \nunless that burden is the least restrictive means to further a compelling governmental \ninterest.  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb01(a) and (b). \n1697.  Defendants have placed Mr. Elamin on the national terrorist watchlist list, at \nleast in part, because of his Muslim religious beliefs.  As explained above, this has caused \nElamin harm. \n259 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 260 of 268\n1698.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have disclosed Mr. Elamin’s status on \nthe  national  terrorist  watchlist  to  third  party  prisons,  including  Jessup  Correctional \nInstitution. \n1699.  As the intended direct and proximate result of Defendants’ disclosure, Jessup \nCorrectional Institution no longer permits Mr. Elamin to volunteer and provide religious \nservices at the prison.   \n1700.  As explained above, these disclosures and the resulting inability for him to \nvolunteer at Jessup or other prisons or jails have interfered with Mr. Elamin’s sincerely-held \nreligious beliefs. \n1701.  Defendants’ placement of Mr. Elamin on the national terrorist watchlist list is \nnot narrowly tailored to achieve any compelling governmental interest.   \n1702.  Defendants’  disclosure  of  Mr.  Elamin’s  status  with  Jessup  Correctional \nInstitution is not narrowly tailored to achieve any compelling governmental interest. \n1703.  Defendants’ disclosure of Mr. Elamin’s status with other prisons and jails is not \nnarrowly tailored to achieve any compelling governmental interest.   \n1704.  Defendants' unlawful actions have imposed and are imposing an immediate \nand ongoing harm on Mr. Elamin and have deprived him of his constitutional and statutory \nrights. \n1705.  None of the Defendants' unlawful actions are narrowly tailored to serve a \ncompelling Government interest. \n1706.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Defendants, Mr. Elamin \nand similarly situated individuals have been and will continue to be harmed. \n260 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 261 of 268\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Abdelmoniem Elamin requests this Honorable Court grant \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all \nsuch other relief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys' fees \nincurred in this action. \nCOUNT XIV \nVIOLATION OF THE NON-DELEGATION DOCTRINE \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n1707.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n1708.  Congress has not provided the Executive Branch with intelligible principles \nfrom which the Executive can implement its watchlist schemes regarding civil aviation and \nnational security. \n1709.  Congress has not directed the Executive Branch to create the watchlisting \nsystem, the Quiet Skies and Silent Partner initiatives, or any other rules-based lists. \n1710.  Congress has not directed the Executive Branch to utilize the watchlisting \nsystem, Quiet Skies and Silent Partner initiatives, or any other rules-based lists to impose \nconsequences  upon  innocent  people,  their  family  members,  their  colleagues  or  other \nassociates. \n1711.  Congress has not authorized the Executive Branch to utilize the watchlisting \nsystem to encourage financial institutions to close bank accounts or ban wire transfers, to \nblock or revoke security or employment credentials, to hinder or bar the purchase of guns, \nto recruit informants, or to instruct state and local law enforcement to detain individuals \nbased on their watchlist status.  \n1712.  Congress has not authorized the Executive Branch to disseminate the TSDB to \ngovernmental and private partners. \n261 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 262 of 268\n1713.  Homeland  Security  Presidential  Directive  6  is  an  illegal  usurpation  of \nCongress’ legislative function and the executive order runs afoul of separation of powers \nprinciples.   \n1714.  The Executive Branch’s assignment of the watchlisting function to TSC violates \nCongress’  directive  that  the  TSA  should  determine  who  belongs  on  federal  terrorist \nwatchlists and the consequences that flow from being on those lists.   \n1715.  Congress has not delegated to TSA the authority to create a process that can \nculminate in the removal of individuals from the TSDB. \n1716.  In the alternative, Congress’s delegation to TSA to create a redress process is \ndefective because the Executive Branch has allocated watchlist authority in a manner that \nprevents TSA from creating a meaningful redress process. \n1717.  Congress  has  not  granted  the  WLAC  or  TSC  with  statutory  authority  to \npromulgate  decisions  regarding  all  policies,  procedures,  practices  and  instructions \npertaining to the federal terrorist watchlist, including, but not limited to: (1) watchlist \nnomination and removal procedures; (2) specific criteria used to nominate persons to the \nTSDB; (3) redress procedures; (4) vetting of information used to nominate persons to the \nTSDB; and, (5) dissemination of a person’s designation in the TSDB to state and local \nauthorities, courts, foreign governments, private corporations, private contractors, airlines, \ngun sellers, financial institutions, the captains of sea-faring vessels, and others.   \n1718.  As a result, Defendants have illegally acted beyond their authority. \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief \nthis Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action.  \n262 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 263 of 268\nPrayer for Relief \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request: \n1.  A  declaratory  judgment  that  Defendants’  policies,  practices,  and  customs \nrelated to the federal terrorist watchlisting system violate the First Amendment, Second \nAmendment, Fourth Amendment, and Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as \nwell as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Administrative Procedure Act; \n2.  A  declaratory  judgment  that  Defendants’  policies,  practices,  and  customs \nviolate the non-delegation doctrine of the United States Constitution; \n3.  A declaratory judgment that: \na.  Defendants’  policies  and  practices  violate  the  First  and  Fourth \nAmendments  by  authorizing  searches  of  Plaintiffs’  and  similarly \nsituated travelers’ electronic devices, absent a warrant supported by \nprobable cause that the devices contain contraband or evidence of a \nviolation of immigration or customs laws, and without particularly \ndescribing the information to be search;  \nb.  Defendants violated Plaintiffs’ First and Fourth Amendment rights by \nsearching  their  electronic  devices  absent  a  warrant  supported  by \nprobable cause that the devices contained contraband or evidence of a \nviolation of immigration or customs laws, and without particularity \ndescribing the information to be searched;  \nc.

Defendants violated the Fourth Amendment rights of Plaintiffs’ by \nconfiscating  their  electronic  devices  for  a  period  of  unreasonable \nduration.   \ne.  Defendants violated the Fifth Amendment by requiring Plaintiffs to \nprovide  passwords  or  biometric  information  for  the  purposes  of \nunlocking their electronic devices. \n4.  An injunction that: \na.  requires  Defendants  to  remedy  the  constitutional  and  statutory \nviolations identified above, including the removal of Plaintiffs from any \nwatchlist or database that burdens or prevents them from flying or \nentering the United States across the border;  \nb.  requires Defendants to provide individuals designated on the federal \nterrorist watchlist with a legal mechanism that affords them notice of \nthe reasons and bases for their placement on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist and a meaningful opportunity to contest their continued \ninclusion on the federal terrorist watchlist; \nc.  Enjoins Defendants from searching electronic devices absent a warrant \nsupported by probable cause;  \nd.  Enjoins Defendants (i) from confiscating travelers’ electronic devices, \nto effectuate searches of those devices after travelers leave the border, \n264 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 48   Filed 03/22/19   Page 265 of 268\nabsent probable cause that the devices contain contraband or evidence \nof a violation of immigration or customs laws, and (ii) in such cases, \npromptly to seek a warrant to search the device;  \ne.

The federal government has imposed a kind of second-class citizenship on the \nPlaintiffs.  Without charges, without arrests, without even an investigation sometimes—the \nagency defendants act in  concert to deprive thousands of innocent Americans,  mostly \nMuslim, of their right to be free from a government that extrajudicially designates them as \nworthy of permanent suspicion. \n2.  That permanent suspicion has sweeping consequences for the Plaintiffs  as \nwell as the more than one million others who bear it.  They are separated from their children, \ndenied employment opportunities, prevented from traveling by air to attend weddings and \nfunerals, and denied or delayed immigration benefits.  The rights of Plaintiffs to purchase \nfirearms, to wire money and keep a bank account, to receive their passports and be granted \nvisas to foreign countries are all constrained.  For one plaintiff, the Defendants’ actions have \ndiminished his standing and ability to provide religious leadership to his community.     \n3.  Through an interagency watchlisting system, led by Defendants’ Watchlisting \nAdvisory Council, the Defendants have identified the Plaintiffs  as worthy of permanent \nsuspicion, imposing burdens and disabilities on them in all aspects of their lives.   \n4.  In deciding to target the Plaintiffs, the watchlisting system behaves lawlessly, \nacting in the absence of and—in some ways—in opposition to what Congress requires of its \nagencies.    \n5.  To identify  its targets, some parts of the watchlisting  system, such as the \nTerrorism Screening Database (“TSDB”), utilize a nonsense-on-stilts standard that is always \nsatisfied.  Other parts, such as TSA’s Quiet Skies initiative,  do not use any standard and \n5 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 6 of 150\ninstead rely upon the inarticulate hunches of federal officials, rank profiling, and vulgar guilt-\nby-association practices. \n6.  Through their watchlisting system, the federal government makes it known—\nto every law enforcement agency in the country, every part of the federal government, more \nthan 60 foreign countries, an unknown number of private companies, international bodies, \nand other third parties—that the Plaintiffs should be treated as dangerous threats.  The \nPlaintiffs’ friends, family, and others with whom the Plaintiffs associate are punished for \ntheir relationship with a watchlisting system’s target.   \n7.  The Defendants know that their watchlisting system has never prevented an \nact of terrorism inside the United States and is completely ineffective, but they continue to \nexpand it anyways.   \n8.  Plaintiffs and almost all others targeted by the watchlisting system have never \nbeen arrested, charged, or convicted of any type of terrorism-related offense.  Nonetheless, \nthe federal government has designated them as “known or suspected terrorists,” wreaking \nhavoc on Plaintiffs’ personal, religious and professional lives.   \n9.  The  federal  government  uses  secret  and  automated  “rules”  to  monitor \nAmericans’ travel patterns and their associations.  Americans who travel to the Middle East, \nspeak  or  study  Arabic,  donate  to  Muslim  charities,  travel  with  already-watchlisted \nindividuals, or communicate with already-watchlisted individuals are routinely flagged for \nheightened scrutiny.  The government designates these individuals as “unknown or partially \nknown terrorists,” monitors and investigates them, and then uses any information learned \nto nominate them as “known or suspected terrorists.”   The Boston Globe unearthed one such \n“risk-based passenger targeting rules” program on July 28, 2018; it is called “Quiet Skies.” \n6 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 7 of 150\n10.  Leaked government documents as well as public governmental reports, reveal \nthat the federal government’s terrorist watchlisting system is discriminatory, standardless, \nand devoid of adequate procedures.  These documents include the March 2013 Watchlisting \nGuidance  (Exhibit  1),  the  Directorate  of  Terrorist  Identities  (DTI):  Strategic \nAccomplishments 2013 (Exhibit 2), the Department of Justice's March 2014 Audit of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation's Management of Terrorist Watchlist (Exhibit 3), and a 2018 \ninformational bulletin on the “Quiet Skies” program (Exhibit 4),   \n11.  Many Americans,  including  children,  end up  targeted by  the  watchlisting \nsystem based on who their mother or father is, what mosque their family attends, how they \nexercise their constitutional rights, where they travel, with whom they associate, or their \nperceived religious beliefs. \n12.  Speaking  Arabic,  traveling  to  Muslim-majority  countries,  and  even \nundertaking religious pilgrimages—activities that American Muslims are likely to engage \nin—qualify as bases for rules-based monitoring, Quiet Skies listing, watchlist nominations, \nand watchlist placements. \n13.  The federal government also uses guilt-by-association presumptions to place \nfamily  members, friends, traveling  companions, and associates  of listed  persons under \nintense surveillance and on the watchlist.   \n14.  The federal government adds many Americans to the watchlist or subjects \nthem to terrorist-level scrutiny due to typos, coincidentally similar  names and outright \nmistakes.  This happens as a result of the government employing few checks or quality \nassurance standards before permitting names to be added.   \n7 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 8 of 150\n15.  The federal government’s additions to the TSDB have dramatically increased \nover the last decade.  The number of individuals Defendants added to the TSDB in 2016 is \nmore than triple the number added in 2009.  Approximately 99% of all proposed additions \nare accepted each year.  There are now more than one million people in the TSDB.   \n16.  Although the Department of Homeland Security operates DHS TRIP, ostensibly \nto assist Americans in resolving travel complaints including those related to their watchlist \nstatus, the DHS TRIP is largely ineffective.  DHS TRIP refuses to discuss specific facts and \nrefuses to even process many redress complaints related to watchlistees or those subjected \nto rules-based “terrorist” monitoring.   Moreover, the DHS TRIP redress process often only \naffects air travel, not land border crossings or other watchlist consequences. Meanwhile, \ninnocent Americans suffer paralyzing consequences. \n17.  Each  of  the  Plaintiffs’  injuries  are  directly  attributable  to  Defendants’ \ncompilation, implementation and dissemination of the federal terrorist watchlisting system, \nincluding rules-based monitoring, Quiet Skies, and the TSDB.   \nPlaintiffs \n18.

In September 2003, Attorney General John Ashcroft established the Terrorist \nScreening Center (“TSC”) to consolidate the government’s approach to terrorism screening.  \nThe TSC, which is administered by the FBI, develops and maintains the federal government’s \nconsolidated Terrorism Screening Database (“TSDB” or “federal terrorist watchlist”).  TSC’s \nconsolidated  watchlist  is  the  federal  government’s  master  repository  for  suspected \ninternational and domestic terrorist records and is used for watchlist related screening.   \n70.  The Government publicly states that to be included in the TSDB, an individual \nmust be reasonably suspected of being a known or suspected terrorist.  More specifically,  \ngovernment nominator “must rely upon articulable intelligence or information which, based \non the totality of the circumstances and, taken together with rational inferences from those \nfacts, creates a reasonable suspicion that the individual is engaged, has been engaged, or \nintends to engage, in conduct constituting in preparation for, in aid or in furtherance of, or \nrelated to, terrorism and/or terrorist activities.”  See January 2018 Overview of the U.S. \nGovernment’s Watchlisting Process and Procedures (Exhibit 5.)   \n71.  The “totality of the circumstances” analysis for TSDB inclusion may include \nassessment of an individual’s race, ethnicity, country of origin, religion, religious practices, \nlanguages spoken,  family,  associations,  travel  history,  social  media  history,  and  other \nactivities protected by the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, and \nU.S. Constitution.1   \n                                                 \n1 1.  The TSA conducts a similar assessment of the associations and travel patterns of individuals in order \nto flag them as “unknown or partially known terrorists” and place them on the “Quiet Skies Selectee List,” which \n28 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 29 of 150\n72.  Anyone listed in the TSDB is a “TSDB Listee” subjected to varying forms of \nheightened scrutiny and adverse repercussions.  In addition, TSDB Listees may have their \nrecords annotated or categorized with additional sub-classifications subjecting them to \ndifferential treatment. \n73.  One set of TSDB sub-classifications is utilized primarily by the TSA, DHS, and \nTSC as relates to air travel.  It includes the No Fly List, the Selectee List, and the Expanded \nSelectee List.   \n74.  Since April 2011, persons nominated and added to the TSDB are placed on the \nExpanded Selectee List by default, provided their records contain a minimum  amount of \nname and birth date identifying information.   \n75.  TSDB Listees may also be categorized under the heightened Selectee List if \ntheir  records  contain  additional  “derogatory  information.”    According  to  the  2013 \nWatchlisting Guidance promulgated by the Watchlisting Advisory Council, TSDB Listees may \nbe designated as Selectees if the government suspects them of association or affiliation with \na foreign or domestic terrorist organization, or other association with terrorist activities.   \n76.  TSDB Listees may also be categorized under the heightened No Fly List if their \nrecords contain additional “derogatory information.”  According to information released by \nthe government (following 2015 No Fly List litigation), TSDB Listees may be placed on the \nNo Fly List if the government believes they pose a threat of committing an act of terrorism \nin the United States, against an international U.S. government facility, with respect to an \naircraft, or if they  are otherwise operationally capable of carrying out a violent  act of \n                                                 \noperates independently  of the TSDB.  Quiet Skies may, however, cross-reference  TSDB information and serve \nas a stepping stone in the process of identifying and investigating individuals which leads to TSDB nomination. \n29 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 30 of 150\nterrorism.  See January 2018 Overview of the U.S. Government’s Watchlisting Process and \nProcedures at 4 (Exhibit 5.)   \n77.  TSDB Listees sub-classified on either the Expanded Selectee List or Selectee \nList are systematically subjected to extra screening at airports, and often find “SSSS” printed \non  their  boarding passes.    “SSSS”  indicates  a  passenger’s  watchlist  status  to  airline \nemployees, airport employees, and screeners.  Persons on the No Fly List, including some of \nthe Watchlisted Plaintiffs, are prevented from boarding flights that fly into, out of, or even \nthrough United States airspace.  TSDB Listees who are not on the No Fly List may also be \nblocked from crossing U.S. land borders or from boarding international flights headed to the \nUnited States.  \n78.  Other screening agencies, including  CBP, screen TSDB Listees but do not \nregularly use the No Fly List, Selectee List, and Expanded Selectee classifications.  Instead, \nthe CBP designates TSDB Listees as “Armed and Dangerous,” refers them to secondary \ninspection, or otherwise automatically flags them as potential terrorists in automatic alerts \nsent to officers.  \n79.  Pursuant to official CBP policy adopted in January 2018, the CBP conducts \nsecondary inspection  including  advanced electronics  searches of the  electronics TSDB \nListees.   “An advanced search is any search in which an officer connects external equipment \nthrough a wired or wireless connection to an electronic device not merely to gain access to \nthe device, but to review, copy, and analyze its contents.”  “The presence of an individual on \na government operated and government vetted  terrorist watch  list,”  alone constitutes \ngrounds for the CBP to copy the contents of laptops, tablets, and smartphones, without \nrequesting or obtaining consent. \n30 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 31 of 150\n80.  Another set of TSDB sub-classifications is utilized  by DHS, NCIC, and other \nfederal, state, and local law enforcement officers to determine operational responses to \nTSDB Listees.  These are known as “Handling Codes,” which are set by the TSC and, upon \ninformation and belief, overseen by the Watchlisting Advisory Council and its participating \nagencies.  Four TSC handling codes have been published by Baltimore Police Department \nPolicy 802, Handling Codes: Terrorist Response (Sept. 8, 2016) (Exhibit 6), as well as other \nfederal, state, and local law enforcement guidebooks:   \n“Handling Code 1: The subject is confirmed to associate with terrorism, and \nthere is a valid, outstanding arrest warrant. \n \nHandling Code 2: The subject is of an “investigative interest” regarding their \nassociation with terrorism. \n \nHandling Code 3: This individual may have possible ties with terrorism. \n \nHandling Code 4: The identity provided by this individual may have possible \nties with terrorism.” \n \n81.  In 2005, according to an analysis done by the DOJ’s Office of the Inspector \nGeneral, less than 1% of all TSDB Listees were designated under either Handling Code 1 or \n2.  In other words, less than 1% of all TSDB Listees either had an outstanding arrest warrant \nor were under active investigation for terrorism.  The overwhelming majority of records, \nmore than 96%, were designated under Handling Codes 3 or 4, as maybe having possible ties \nto  terrorism.   Upon  information  and belief,  these ratios  continue  to  approximate the \nHandling Code subdivisions of TSDB Listees in 2018. \n82.  In addition to the various “terrorist” sub-classifications of TSDB Listees, the \nTSDB also lists foreign individuals under an exception to the TSDB’s ordinary ‘reasonable \nsuspicion of being a known or suspected terrorist’ standard.  Pursuant to this exception, the \nTSDB  includes  identifying  information  of  foreign individuals  who may  have  espoused \n31 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 32 of 150\nsupport for terrorist activities,  or who are related to TSDB listees.  The  Department of \nHomeland Security and the Department of State use this TSDB exception to screen foreign \nindividuals  for admissibility,  visas  and immigration.   TSDB “Exceptions” are separately \ncategorized by the TSC and disseminated to DHS and the State Department. \n83.  Even though they are not TSDB Listees, airplane passengers occasionally \nreceive boarding passes stamped with “SSSS”.  These designations are commonly the product \nof the TSA’s secretive and automated “risk-based targeting rules.”  These targeting rules \nexamine passengers’ itineraries, travel histories, travelling companions, associations with \nTSDB  Listees, and  numerous other undisclosed factors in  order to  flag  passengers as \n“unknown or partially known terrorists.”    Upon information and belief, the secretive and \nundisclosed factors include “totality of the circumstances” analysis related to passengers’ \nrace, ethnic origin, national origin, sex, and religion. \n84.  The TSA’s Quiet Skies program assembles the results of these “risk-based \ntargeting rules” onto a separate TSA watchlist known as the “Quiet Skies Selectee List,” and \nthen subjects the passengers to intense investigation and scrutiny.  Within the Quiet Skies \nprogram, Federal Air Marshalls and plainclothes TSA officers collect detailed behavioral and \nsurveillance information on Quiet Skies Selectees, including passengers’ bathroom usage, \nwardrobe changes, meals, conversations, whether they sleep on their flights, and reactions \nwhen they realize they are being stalked.  Based on their observations and investigations, \nthe TSA may nominate Quiet Skies Selectees to the TSDB. \n85.  CBP employs comparable risk-based targeting rules to the TSA in order to \nsingle out individuals at ports of entry for secondary inspection, detention, investigation and \ndeportation.   Upon  information and  belief,  CBP also  maintains  separate “unknown  or \n32 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 33 of 150\npartially known terrorist” watchlists independent of the TSDB in order to label and treat \nindividuals  presenting themselves at land borders as terrorists.  Upon information and \nbelief, CBP utilizes the results of high-risk targeting rules and resulting inspections and \ninvestigation as a factual predicate for nominating individuals to the TSDB. \n86.  Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs are all TSDB Listees or family members \nof TSDB Listees.  Upon information and belief and in addition, Plaintiffs and similarly-\nsituated Americans have also been designated by the TSA and/or CBP as potential terrorists \nas a result of the TSA and/or CBP’s automated high-risk targeting rules and creation of \nseparate “unknown or partially known terrorist” watchlists. \nNominations To The Federal Terrorist Watchlist \n87.  Although TSA, CBP, and other agencies may use the records provided by the \nTSC, it is the TSC that maintains and controls the database of suspected terrorists. \n88.  Two  government  entities  are  primarily  responsible  for  “nominating” \nindividuals for inclusion in the terrorist watchlist—NCTC  and FBI.  The NCTC, which is \nmanaged by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, relies on information from \nother  federal departments  and  agencies  when  including  alleged  known  or  suspected \ninternational terrorists in its Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (“TIDE”) database.  \nThe NCTC reviews TIDE entries and recommends specific entries to the TSC for inclusion in \nthe watchlist.  TIDE is the main source of all international terrorist information included in \nthe  watchlist.    The  FBI,  in  turn,  nominates  to  the  watchlist  individuals  with  what  it \ncharacterizes as suspected ties to domestic terrorism.   \n89.  Other government agencies, including DHS, TSA and CBP, also have the ability \nto nominate individuals for inclusion in the terrorist watchlist. \n33 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 34 of 150\n90.  All nominations to the TSDB must be approved and implemented by the TSC.  \nThe TSC makes the final decision on whether a nominated individual meets the minimum \nrequirements for inclusion into the watchlist as a known or suspected terrorist.  TSC also \ndecides which screening systems will receive the information about that individual. \n91.  Former Director of the Terrorism Screening Center Healy has testified that in \nevaluating  whether  an individual  meets  the criteria  for inclusion  on the  consolidated \nwatchlist, the TSC determines whether the nominated individual is “reasonably suspected” \nof having possible links to terrorism.  According to the TSC, “reasonable suspicion requires \narticulable facts which,  taken together with  rational inferences, reasonably warrant the \ndetermination that an individual is known or suspected to be or has been engaged in conduct \nconstituting, in preparation for, in and of or related to terrorism and terrorist activities.”   \n92.  Defendants have provided only limited information about and otherwise not \nstated publicly what standards or criteria are applied to determine whether an American \ncitizen will be placed on the TSDB, No Fly List, Selectee List, Expanded Selectee List, Quiet \nSkies Selectee List, or any other terrorist watchlist that is distributed to the TSA, CBP or other \nscreening agencies.   \n93.  The  standards  for watchlist  inclusion  do  not  evince  even  internal  logic.  \nDefendants define a “suspected terrorist” as an “individual who is reasonably suspected to \nbe, or have been, engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to \nterrorism and terrorist activities based on articulable and reasonable suspicion.”  In other \nwords, Defendants place American citizens on the federal terrorist watchlist based upon a \n“reasonable suspicion” that they are “reasonably suspected” of nefarious activities.  This \n34 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 35 of 150\nstandard falls far below the typical “reasonable suspicion” and “probable cause” standards \nrequired for criminal investigation. \n94.  The federal government utilizes guilt-by-association as a basis for watchlist \ninclusion.  For example, immediate relatives of listed persons can be listed without any \nderogatory information—other than the bonds of family.  Nonetheless, such designation \nsignals to screening agencies, officers, employers, and others that the immediate relative is \na violent threat engaged in nefarious activities.   \n95.  Being a known associate—a friend, colleague, fellow community member, \netc.—of a listed individual can also provide a basis for watchlist inclusion.   \n96.  Even if an American citizen is acquitted of terrorism charges or those charges \nare otherwise dismissed, the federal government retains for itself the authority to continue \nto include them in the watchlist.   \n97.  For reasons unknown, Defendants also place what they call “non-investigatory \nsubjects” on the federal terrorist watchlist, American citizens that they have chosen not to \ninvestigate. \n98.  Defendants place individuals on the federal terrorist watchlist without any \ninformation regarding an individual’s intended target.   \n99.  Defendants place individuals on the Selectee List without any information that \nthey pose a threat to aviation. \n100.  Defendants place individuals on the No Fly List without any information that \nthey pose a threat to aviation. \n101.  Under  these  practices  and  standards,  the  number  of  records  in  the \nconsolidated watchlist has swelled.  Over 1.1 million new names have been added to the \n35 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 36 of 150\nwatchlist  since  fiscal 2009.  More than 98% of the names nominated to the TSDB are \naccepted.  In 2013, TSC accepted 98.96 percent of all nominations made.  A 2007 GAO report \nfound that TSC rejects only approximately one percent of all nominations to the watchlist.2   \n102.  Because  of  these  loose  standards  and  practices,  the  federal  terrorist \nwatchlist’s rate of growth has dramatically increased.  In fiscal 2009, there were 58,999 new \nadditions to the watchlist.  In fiscal 2016, there were 176,014 new additions.   \n103.  Upon information and belief, in 2001, there were 16 people who the federal \ngovernment systematically  prevented from flying.    In 2013,  that  number increased to \napproximately 47,000. \n104.  Once an American citizen  has been placed on the  watchlist, the individual \nremains on the list until the agency that supplied the initial information in support of the \nnomination determines the individual should be removed. \n105.  At a March 10, 2010 Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing, Russel E. \nTravers, Deputy Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, stated that “[t]he entire \nfederal government is leaning very far forward on putting people on list,” and that the \nwatchlist is “getting bigger, and it will get even bigger.” \n106.  The federal terrorist watchlist’s inclusion standards are so permissive, pliable, \nand laden with discriminatory assessments of race, ethnicity, national origin, and religion, \nthat they bear at best a fleetingly marginal connection to actual terrorist activities.  The \ninclusion  standards  themselves  violate  the  Watchlisted  Plaintiffs’  procedural  and \nsubstantive due process. \n                                                 \n2 See United  States  Government  Accountability Office Report  to Congressional  Requesters  entitled  Terrorist \nWatchlist Screening:  Opportunities Exist to Enhance Management Oversight, Reduce Vulnerabilities in Agency \nScreening Processes, and Expand Use of the List, GAO-08-110, October 2007, at 22. \n36 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 37 of 150\nDissemination & Consequences Of The Terrorist Watchlist \n107.  Subsets of TSDB watchlist information is disseminated from the TSC across the \nfederal government, to state and local governments, and to more than 60 foreign countries, \nincluding all Visa Waiver Program countries. \n108.  TSC disseminates records from its terrorist watchlist  to other government \nagencies that in  turn use those records to identify  suspected terrorists.   For example, \napplicable TSC records are provided to TSA for use by airlines in pre-screening passengers \nand to CBP for use in screening travelers entering the United States at land borders, seaports, \nairports, and other ports of entry.   \n109.  Upon information and belief,  Defendants disseminated the records of  the \nWatchlisted Plaintiffs from the TSDB to other government agencies, including TSA for use by \nairlines  in  pre-screening the  Watchlisted  Plaintiffs,  and CBP  for  use in  screening  the \nWatchlisted Plaintiffs upon entering the United States. \n110.  Upon information and belief, Defendants disseminated the records pertaining \nto the Watchlisted Plaintiffs from their terrorist watchlist to foreign governments with the \npurpose and hope that those foreign governments will  constrain the movement of  the \nWatchlisted Plaintiffs in some manner.   \n111.  Upon information and belief, Defendants’ intention in disseminating watchlist \nrecords, including  those of  the  Watchlisted  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American \ncitizens, as widely as possible is to constrain and monitor their movements and activities, \nboth in the United States and abroad.  For example, some countries detain individuals listed \non the federal terrorist watchlist who enter their borders, question those individuals at the \n37 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 38 of 150\nbehest of United States officials, or altogether prevent those individuals from entering those \ncountries.   \n112.  Thus,  while  the  TSC  maintains  and  controls  the  database  of  suspected \nterrorists, it is the front-line agencies like the TSA, CBP, and law enforcement that carry out \nthe screening function.  These agencies and law enforcement entities cross-reference the \nnames and identities of individuals they encounter against the TSDB in order to determine \nwhether they are on the TSDB or are a potential match to the TSDB. \n113.  Agencies  throughout the  federal government  utilize  the  federal  terrorist \nwatchlist to conduct and promote screening, subjecting listed persons to a comprehensive \nportfolio of consequences that cover large aspects of their lives.   \n114.  Government agencies routinely cross-reference the TSDB in connection with \napplications for or audits of a wide range of government benefits.  The TSDB is referenced in \nconnection with  and used as a basis to deny federal government employment, security \nclearances (regardless of whether the individual needs that clearance for either government \nor private contractor employment), travel benefit programs like TSA PreCheck and Global \nEntry, and a wide variety of government licenses and credentials used in both public and \nprivate  employment,  including  FAA  licenses,  Hazmat  licenses,  Transportation  Worker \nIdentity Credentials, and security credentials needed for critical infrastructure projects like \npower plants. \n115.  Indeed,  Defendants  disseminated  the  federal  terrorist  watchlist  to \ngovernment authorities, private corporations and individuals with the purpose and hope \nthat  these  entities  and/or individuals  will  impose  consequences on  those individuals \nDefendants have listed, including the Watchlisted Plaintiffs. \n38 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 39 of 150\n116.  Upon information  and belief,  the status  of  the  Watchlisted  Plaintiffs  and \nsimilarly situated American citizens as known or suspected terrorists on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist diminishes and even imperils their ability to access and utilize the financial system.   \n117.  Defendants have provided  information  regarding TSDB  Listees to  banks, \nprompting banks to close the bank accounts of individuals listed on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist.  Financial institutions have also declined to allow some watchlisted individuals to \nmake wire transfers. \n118.  Moreover,  upon  information  and  belief,  family-based  immigration \napplications  filed  by  individuals  listed  on  the  federal  terrorist  watchlist  are  delayed \nindefinitely due to an “FBI name check” and not adjudicated, thereby denying and hindering \nthe Watchlisted Plaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens of the rights that flow \nfrom citizenship, including the ability to sponsor lawful permanent residency for immediate \nrelatives living abroad. \n119.  Among  the  entities  and  individuals  to  which  the  federal  government \ndisseminates  its  federal  terrorist  watchlist  are  state  and  local  authorities,  foreign \ngovernments, corporations, private contractors, airlines, gun sellers, financial institutions, \nand captains of sea-faring vessels, among others. \n120.  Upon information and belief, because the names of the Watchlisted Plaintiffs \nand similarly situated American citizens are included on the federal terrorist watchlist, their \nnames were disseminated to state and local authorities, foreign governments, corporations, \nprivate contractors, airlines,  gun sellers, financial institutions,  the captains of sea-faring \nvessels, among other official and private entities and individuals. \n39 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 40 of 150\n121.  In fact, in 2015, former Director of the Terrorist Screening Center Christopher \nPiehota gave an exclusive interview to CNN and stated the following, in relevant part: \nIt's concerning that our partners don't use all of our data. We \nprovide them with tools. We provide them with support, and I \nwould find it concerning that they don't use these tools to help \nscreen for their own aviation security, maritime security, border \nscreening, visas, things like that for travel.3 \n122.  Former TSC Director Piehota went on to state that the United States shares its \nfederal terrorist watchlist with the European Union, but that European Union countries don't \nsystematically utilize it to identify suspected terrorists or screen migrants coming. \n123.  Because the federal government disseminates its federal terrorist watchlist to \nforeign governments, listed  persons, including  the  Watchlisted  Plaintiffs  and  similarly \nsituated American citizens, are often not allowed to enter other nations.  This is because the \nUnited States is telling other nations, without any modicum of due process, that thousands \nof its own citizens and residents are “known or suspected terrorists.”   \n124.  The  federal  government,  through  Defendants,  disseminates  its  federal \nterrorist watchlist to state and local police officers which allows those officers to query the \nnames of persons, including the Watchlisted Plaintiffs, against the TSDB as disseminated \nthrough the NCIC.  Watchlisted Plaintiffs and similarly situated watchlisted individuals are \noften identified and treated as terrorists during routine police encounters including traffic \nstops.  \n125.  Disseminating the federal terrorist watchlist to state and local police officers \ncreates a dangerous situation insofar as the federal terrorist watchlist effectively directs \n                                                 \n3 First on CNN: Top U.S. intel official: Europe not taking advantage  of terror  tracking tools, CNN, available at: \nhttp://www.cnn.com/2016/04/07/politics/christopher-piehota-us-intel-europe-terror-tracking/ \n40 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 41 of 150\nstate and local officers to treat thousands of Americans, including the Watchlisted Plaintiffs, \ncharged with or convicted of no crime yet who are listed as a “known or suspected terrorist” \nas extremely dangerous.   \n126.  With the advent and deployment of automatic license plate readers by police \ndepartments across the country, federal, local and state authorities have relied heavily upon \na driver’s (or a car associated with a driver’s) watchlist status as the basis of a border or \ntraffic  stop.   Watchlisted  Plaintiffs  and similarly  situated  American citizens  have been \nsubjected to this treatment. \n127.  Being on the federal terrorist watchlist can prevent listed persons, including \nthe Watchlisted Plaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens and lawful permanent \nresidents, from purchasing a gun.  For example, New Jersey passed a law in 2013 that banned \npersons on the federal terrorist watchlist from owning guns.  Additionally, Connecticut is in \nthe process of setting up an institutional mechanism to prevent individuals whose names are \nincluded on the federal terrorist watchlist, such as the Watchlisted Plaintiffs, from being able \nto buy a gun in the state of Connecticut.  Accordingly, the Watchlisted Plaintiffs and similarly \nsituated American citizens are unable to purchase guns in states that ban persons on the \nfederal terrorist watchlist from owning guns. \n128.  There are perennial federal proposals to ban all TSDB Listees from purchasing \nguns, although none has yet been formally adopted.  Nonetheless, upon information and \nbelief, Defendants disseminate the TSDB (through the NCIC or otherwise) throughout the \ngun market.  Upon and information and belief, gun permitting and gun sale process often \ninvolve name cross-checks against the TSDB.  Upon information and belief, gun permits and \n41 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 42 of 150\nsales have been denied based on Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated American citizens’ status \nas TSDB Listees. \n129.  Because the federal government conducts a security risk assessment that \nincludes querying the federal terrorist watchlist  prior to issuing a license to commercial \ndrivers to transport hazardous materials, being on the federal terrorist watchlist can prevent \nlisted persons, including the Watchlisted Plaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens, \nfrom obtaining or renewing their Hazmat license.   \n130.  The federal government conducts a security risk assessment for private and \npublic transportation workers, including  those who enter airports and maritime  ports.  \nApproved individuals are issued Transportation Worker Identity Credentials (“TWIC”).  The \nTWIC credential process includes querying the federal terrorist watchlist.  Defendants have \nprevented TSDB Listees from obtaining or renewing their TWICs, thus depriving them of a \nrequirement for their employment.   \n131.  Being  on the  federal terrorist watchlist  can  also result  in  the  denial  or \nrevocation of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) license of individuals listed on the \nfederal  terrorist  watchlist,  including  the  Watchlisted  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated \nAmerican citizens. \n132.  Being  on the  federal  terrorist watchlist  can also  prevent  listed  persons, \nincluding  the  Watchlisted  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  from \naccompanying minors or passengers with disabilities  to their gate, from working at an \nairport, or working for an airline insofar as listed persons are not allowed to enter so-called \n“sterile areas” of airports. \n42 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 43 of 150\n133.  Being on the federal terrorist watchlist can also result in the listing of the false \nstigmatizing  label  of  “known  or  suspected”  terrorist  on  the  criminal  records  of  the \nWatchlisted  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens  and  lawful  permanent \nresidents.  Criminal record information is accessible to the general public. \n134.  Defendants make the federal terrorist watchlist available to municipal courts, \nwhich may make bail determinations based on an individual’s status on the watchlist. \n135.  The federal terrorist watchlist diminishes, rather than enhances, our national \nsecurity because the number of innocent Americans on the list is becoming so voluminous \nthat the purpose of having a list is significantly undermined as all are being treated as the \nsame. \n136.  The consequences of being on the federal terrorist watchlist are meted out \npublicly.  Members of the public can witness the extra and intrusive screening to which \nindividuals on the federal terrorist watchlist are subject.  This screening oftentimes occurs \nin front of family and colleagues, including TSDB Listees being pulled out of their cars at \ngunpoint, being ordered to leave their vehicles with their hands held above their head, being \nhandcuffed, being singled out and escorted first off of a plane by law enforcement officers, \nbeing subjected to lengthy detentions, and having their electronics confiscated and searched,  \namong other stigmatizing measures. \n137.  Because  travel  is  regularly  done  with  family,  friends,  community \nacquaintances, and professional contacts, a person’s watchlist status is revealed to travel \ncompanions.  Travel companions come to learn of a person’s watchlist status based on how \nscreeners treat TSDB Listees.  Moreover, travel companions are often treated the same as \nTSDB Listees by screeners. \n43 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 44 of 150\n138.  In practice, frontline screeners disclose the status of individuals on the federal \nterrorist  watchlist  to  federal,  state,  local,  and  foreign authorities,  as  well  as  private \nemployees of airports, airlines, and other transportation employees.  The operation of the \nfederal terrorist watchlist enlists air carriers to assist the federal government in tracking \npassengers on the federal terrorist watchlist. \n139.  Defendants who contributed to the placement of the Watchlisted Plaintiffs and \nsimilarly situated American citizens on the federal terrorist watchlist knew that their actions \nviolated clearly established federal and constitutional law. \n140.  Defendants knew  at  the  time  they  acted  unlawfully  that  Supreme Court \nprecedent required that, whenever a citizen  is deprived of a liberty interest, the federal \ngovernment must at least provide the deprived with some form of notice that a deprivation \noccurred, and an opportunity to contest or correct it. \nThe Federal Government’s Terrorist Watchlist \nIs No More Effective Than a List of Randomly Selected Individuals \n \n141.  Defendants’  ability  to  watchlist  persons  who  actually  pose  a  threat  of \nterrorism can be measured and described using a quantitative analysis based on factual \nallegations made in this Complaint as well as publicly available information describing the \ncurrent operation of the federal terrorist watchlist.   \n142.  The federal government has added approximately 1.1 million persons to the \nfederal terrorist watchlist over the last ten years.  These additions include thousands of U.S. \ncitizens and lawful permanent residents. \n143.  Moreover, based on the University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database, \na project funded in part by the Department of Homeland Security, there have been less than \n44 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 45 of 150\n250 terrorist acts inside the United States over the last decade.  These terrorist acts were \nperpetrated by less than 250 persons.  \n144.  Only  one  of  these  perpetrators was  designated  on  the  federal  terrorist \nwatchlist  by the federal government prior to their criminal conduct.  This single person \ndesignated on the  federal  terrorist watchlist,  however, was removed from the federal \nterrorist watchlist prior to perpetrating the terrorist attack. \n145.  Upon information and belief, in order to designate a person on the federal \nterrorist watchlist, the federal government must first have information about that person.  \nBecause the federal government does not possess information on every person in the world, \nexisting law enforcement and intelligence practices produce a subset of persons who the \nfederal government can  then  screen against  the  federal  terrorist  watchlist’s  inclusion \nstandards.   \n146.  The  precise  size  of  this  subset  is  unknown;  however,  a  survey  of  law \nenforcement and intelligence practices indicates that the size of this subset is greater than \n50 million people.   \n147.  Upon information and belief, the practices that produce this subset exclude \nsome persons who do pose a threat of terrorism and include some persons who do not pose \na threat of terrorism.   \n148.  Upon further information and belief, the federal government does not screen \nthe entire subset of people known to it.   Moreover, Defendants do not make individual \ndeterminations as to whether each person about whom they have information should be \nplaced on the federal terrorist watchlist.  Defendants utilized automated algorithms and risk-\n45 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 46 of 150\nbased targeting rules to select individuals for scrutiny, investigation, and nomination to one \nor more terrorist watchlists. \n149.  In order to designate a person on the federal terrorist watchlist,  a federal \ngovernment official must make a nomination and a TSC official must accept the nomination.   \nTSC officials accept nominations at a rate above 98 percent.    \n150.  Based on the facts alleged in this Complaint and the publicly known processes \nof the federal terrorist watchlist, a quantitative analysis can be constructed to measure and \ndescribe the performance and efficacy of the federal terrorist watchlist. \n151.  A  quantitative  analysis  requires that,  in  order to accomplish  the  federal \nterrorist watchlist’s stated objectives, Defendants must have at least some greater-than-\nrandom ability  to identify future terrorists.  This is due to the nature of the processes \nDefendants utilize to place persons on the federal terrorist watchlist  and the size of the \npopulation  Defendants  can—if  they  so  choose—screen against  the  federal  terrorist \nwatchlist’s inclusion standards. \n152.  A quantitative  analysis demonstrates that Defendants’ watchlisting  system \nwould perform similarly if inclusion on the watchlist was done via random selection instead \nof the existing inclusion standards Defendants utilize.   \n153.  A quantitative analysis therefore indicates that Defendants have no ability to \nwatchlist  persons whose placement on the  watchlist  would further Defendants’ stated \nobjectives. \nWatchlist Practices Target And Disproportionately Harm American Muslims \n154.  As of January 2018, the Pew Research Center estimates that there are 3.45 \nmillion Muslims living in the United States, accounting for 1.1% of the total U.S. population.  \n46 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 47 of 150\nParticularly robust Muslim populations live, inter alia, in Michigan, Illinois, Washington, D.C., \nNew Jersey, New York, and California. \n155.  Dearborn,  Michigan  is  a  suburb  of  Detroit  with  a  large  Arab-Muslim \ncommunity,  comprising 40%  of its  approximately 100,000-person population.    Due to \nDearborn’s significant Muslim population, it has earned a reputation as the “Muslim Capital \nof America.”  As of 2013, Dearborn was second only to New York City (population: 8.5 \nmillion) for the total number of residents listed on the federal terrorist watchlist.   \n156.  Defendants’  over-eager  practice  of  approving  watchlist  nominations  of \nrelatives or associates of already-listed individuals imposes overwhelming network effects \nin Muslim communities such as Dearborn.  One watchlist nomination, even if grounded in \nprobable cause or a preexisting criminal conviction, can rapidly spiral into the government \nclassifying nearly every member of an extended family or community mosque as a potential \nor suspected terrorist. \n157.  The federal terrorist watchlist and its inclusion standards disproportionately \ntarget and affect American Muslims.  Defendants use impermissible and inaccurate religious \nprofiles in order to nominate, accept, disseminate, and deploy the federal terrorist watchlist \nagainst American Muslims in a manner that is different from other faith backgrounds.    \n158.  Defendants consider origin from Muslim-majority countries, travel to Muslim-\nmajority countries, travel on religious pilgrimages,  learning Arabic, attending mosques, \nzakat donations to Muslim charities, the wearing of typical Muslim dress, the frequency of \nMuslim  prayer,  adherence  to  Islamic  religious  practices,  affiliations  with  Muslim \norganizations,  and  associations  with  other  Muslims  as  suspicious  factors  supporting \n47 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 48 of 150\ninclusion in the TSDB, on the Quiet Skies Selectee List, and on other high-risk-potential-\nterrorist watchlists. \n159.  In fact, almost all – if not, all – legal challenges regarding designations on the \nfederal terrorist watchlist have been filed by Muslims nationwide.4 \n160.  Upon information and belief, when Defendants review lists of social networks \nand known associates of a currently watchlisted individual, they routinely chose to nominate \nArab or Muslim names that cross their desk on the stereotyped basis of race, religion, or \nnational origin alone.  Meanwhile, Defendants gloss over any stereotypically white, Christian, \nEnglish, or Western-European names that may appear in the same network lists, such as \nclassmates or colleagues.   \n161.  Upon information and belief, Defendants dismiss mass violence perpetrated \nby white  Christians as “lone wolf” events unconnected to  “organized” terrorism, while \noverreacting to comparable or even less serious events perpetrated by Muslims.  This is \nfueled by a media  culture which, according to researchers at Georgia State  University, \ndedicates nearly five times as much reporting to Muslim perpetrators than to white ones.   \n162.  Upon information and belief, even though they facially satisfy the same known \nassociate  watchlist  criteria,  close  families  and  friends  of  convicted  white-nationalist \n                                                 \n4 See Rahman v. Chertoff, No. 05-cv-3761 (N.D. Ill.); Ibrahim v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., No. 06-cv-00545 (N.D. \nCal.); Scherfen v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, No. 3:08-cv-1554 (M.D. Pa.); Latif v.

Tx.).  \nMany of these legal challenges were filed by groups of multiple Muslim plaintiffs. \n48 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 49 of 150\ndomestic terrorists are not routinely added to the federal terrorist watchlist, while distant \nfamilies and friends of innocent Muslims often discover that their mere association with \nother watchlistees has caused them to be labeled potential terrorists.  \n163.  Defendants’ 2013 Watchlisting Guidance indicates that “[t]ravel for no known \nlawful or legitimate purpose to a locus of terrorist activity” can be a basis for being listed.  \nWhile a “locus of Terrorist Activity” is not defined by the document, upon information and \nbelief, it likely includes any place where many Muslims reside. \n164.  By emphasizing Arab origins or Islamic faith above all else, Defendants have \nutilized the watchlist far beyond its intended purpose.  Instead of serving as a targeted tool \nto enhance aviation and border security, the watchlist has become a bludgeon to coerce \neveryday American Muslims  into spying on their neighbors and becoming government \ninformants.  Presence on the watchlist is deployed as an intimidation tactic and used to \ncoercively justify the denial of American-Muslims’ civil rights, such as the right to have an \nattorney present during law enforcement questioning. \n165.  Public examples of this phenomenon abound.  See Latif v. Holder, 2014 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 85450, *19 (D. Or. June 24, 2014) (an FBI agent told Steven Washburn that he \n“would help remove Washburn's name from the No-Fly List if he agreed to speak to the FBI”); \nId. at *21-22 (FBI agents told Ibraheim Mashal that “his name would be removed from the \nNo-Fly List and he would receive compensation if  he helped the FBI by serving as an \ninformant.”): Id. at *22-23 (FBI agents offered Amir Meshal “the opportunity to serve as a \ngovernment informant in exchange for assistance in removing his name from the No-Fly \nList.”).  See also Fikre v. FBI, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73174 (D. Or. May 29, 2014) (Emirati \nofficials told Yonas Fikre that he “could not travel to the United States by air because he is on \n49 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 50 of 150\nthe No-Fly List” and an FBI agent told Fikre that “the FBI could take steps to remove [him] \nfrom the No-Fly List if he agreed to be an informant.”); Tanveer v. Holder, et. al., No. 13-cv-\n6951, Dkt. 15 (April 22, 2014) (Naveed Shinwari “declined to act as an informant for the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation and to spy on [his] own American Muslim communities and \nother innocent people.”). \n166.  The FBI has sought to recruit Plaintiffs, and similarly situated watchlisted \nAmericans, as informants. \n167.  To American Muslims, the watchlist  is an ever-present threat of increased \nscrutiny and adverse consequences which descends without notice, cannot be effectively \nredressed, and chills their constitutionally-protected exercise of speech and religion. \nInadequacy of the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program Process \n168.  Defendants have not provided travelers, including the Watchlisted Plaintiffs \nand similarly situated American citizens and foreign nationals, with a clear, fair, timely, or \neffective mechanism through which they can challenge the TSC’s decision to designate them \nas a potential terrorist and place them on the watchlist.  Nor can Watchlisted Plaintiffs and \nsimilarly  situated  American citizens  and foreign nationals challenge DHS’s inclusion  of \nPlaintiffs on separate but related high-risk potential-terrorist lists such as Quiet Skies. \n169.  No single government entity is responsible for removing an individual from \nthe TSDB.  The FBI administers the TSC and the  watchlist  but does not accept redress \ninquiries from the public.  The NCTC which manages the TIDE list (which in turn supplies \nnames to the TSC watchlist) also does not accept redress inquiries from the public.  Neither \nentity directly provides final disposition letters to individuals who have submitted redress \ninquiries.   \n50 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 51 of 150\n170.  The only redress “process” available to individuals included on the terrorist \nwatchlist is the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program.   Individuals who have been denied \nentry or boarding, subjected to additional screening, or who otherwise suspect that they may \nbe on the watchlist, may seek redress by submitting an inquiry to DHS TRIP.  At that time, \nDHS TRIP provides individuals with a “Redress Control Number.”     \n171.  The DHS TRIP Redress process primarily affects the TSA’s screening of airport \ntravelers and TSDB listees; it has limited (if any) impact on TSDB Listees’ overall TSDB status, \nincluding their screening at land borders by CBP, or their screening for immigration, visas, \nemployment, security clearances, or credentialing by other federal agencies. \n172.  DHS TRIP submits the traveler complaints of TSDB Listees to the TSC, which \ndetermines whether any action should be taken.  The TSC has not provided any publicly \navailable information about how it evaluates complaints or makes that decision.  The TSC is \nthe final  arbiter of whether an individual’s  name is  retained on or removed from the \nwatchlist,  including  those of the Watchlisted  Plaintiffs  and similarly  situated American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals.   \n173.  The TSA Administrator may provide input regarding whether a DHS TRIP \nRedress applicant listed on the TSDB should be removed, but as of December 2017, the TSA \nAdministrator had taken no action regarding the removal of TSDB Listees in two years. \n174.  Being removed from the No Fly List or the Selectee List does not mean that a \nindividual is also removed from the TSDB. \n175.  Being removed from the TSDB does not mean that an individual will cease to \nbe treated as a terrorist, as they may continue to be subjected to terrorist-level scrutiny \nthrough the operation of the TSA and CBP’s rules-based targeted terrorist monitoring lists.  \n51 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 52 of 150\n176.  The government does not provide an American citizen with  a meaningful \nopportunity to confront, or to rebut, the grounds for his or her possible inclusion on the \nwatchlist.  No information is available to the Watchlisted Plaintiffs and similarly situated \nAmerican citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals about what specific \nfacts the TSC considers during the redress process, and no opportunity is provided for the \nWatchlisted Plaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent residents, \nand foreign nationals to contest or correct those facts. \n177.  Once the TSC makes a determination regarding a particular individual’s status \non  the  watchlist,  including  the  Watchlisted  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals, it sends the result to DHS TRIP.  \nDHS TRIP in turn responds to the individual with a standard form letter that neither confirms \nnor denies the existence of any terrorist watchlist records relating to the individual.   \n178.  In  response to  prior  litigation,  DHS  TRIP  letters  are  now  required  to \naffirmatively state whether a U.S. complainee is presently on the No Fly List.  However, DHS \nTRIP does not disclose Selectee, Expanded Selectee, or Quiet Skies Selectee list status.   The \nDHS TRIP letters  continue to provide no information on historical  watchlist  status,  no \ninformation as to whether a person is included in the TSDB generally, no meaningful factual \nbasis for the individual’s inclusion on the watchlist, and no information as to whether the \ngovernment has resolved the specific complaint at issue. \n179.  As such, DHS TRIP offers no meaningful or substantive review of the watchlist \ndesignation and in effect shields the TSC’s actions with respect to the individual nominations \nor classes of nominations from meaningful review by any independent authority, including \nthe judiciary.   \n52 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 53 of 150\n180.  Instead, DHS TRIP operates as a mere middleman, forwarding complaints to \nthe TSC while shielding the TSC’s substantive determinations from individual, independent, \nor judicial review.  Thus, the only “process” available to individuals caught up in the federal \nterrorist watchlisting system is to submit their names and other identifying information to \nDHS TRIP, a government entity that itself has no authority to provide redress, and then hope \nthat some other unspecified government agency self-identifies an error or changes its mind. \n181.  Individuals are justifiably skeptical of Defendants’ willingness to engage in \nmeaningful  introspection  or  self-correction.    Famously,  in  Ibrahim  v.  Department  of \nHomeland Security, et al.,  06-CV-00545, ECF 701-1 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 6, 2014), Defendants \nvigorously contested a Muslim graduate student’s challenge to her No Fly List designation \nand subsequent revocation of her student visa.  Defendants’ actions had stranded her in \nMalaysia for nine years.  Following trial, it was ultimately revealed that her placement on the \nNo Fly List was the result of an FBI agent’s error in November 2004.  He had accidentally \nchecked the wrong box.  Id. at 9. \n182.  The government’s own internal audits of the watchlist system point to serious \nflaws.  For example, a March 2008 DOJ Office of the Inspector General report entitled Audit \nof the U.S. Department of Justice Terrorism Watchlist Nomination Processes found significant \nproblems with the nomination and removal process.  Rather than address those problems, \nDefendants’ approach since 2008 has been to double-down on questionable nomination and \nredress practices, exponentially increasing the watchlist’s size and adverse consequences. \n183.  A federal judge observed in Gulet Mohamed v. Eric R. Holder, Jr., et al., No. 11-\ncv-00050, Dkt. 70 at 19 (E.D. Va. 2011), that “[a] showing of past or ongoing unlawful conduct \ndoes not seem to be required,… But the Court has little, if any, ability to articulate what \n53 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 54 of 150\ninformation is viewed by TSC as sufficiently ‘derogatory’ beyond the labels it has provided \nthe Court.  In sum, the No Fly List assumes that there are some American citizens who are \nsimply too dangerous to be permitted to fly, no matter the level of pre-flight screening or on-\nflight  surveillance and restraint,  even though those citizens  cannot be legally arrested, \ndetained, or otherwise restricted in their movements or conduct.”   (Memorandum Opinion \nattached as Exhibit 7). \n184.  The Mohamed v. Holder court went on to find that “[i]nclusion on the No Fly \nList also labels an American citizen a disloyal American who is capable of, and disposed \ntoward committing war crimes, and one can easily imagine the broad range of consequences \nthat might be visited upon such a person if that stigmatizing designation were known by the \ngeneral public… The process of nomination to the No Fly List is based on a suspected level of \nfuture dangerousness that is not necessarily related to any unlawful conduct.”  See id. at 14, \n17. \n185.  Another federal judge has permitted a broad challenge to the federal terrorist \nwatchlist to proceed.  In Elhady, et al., v. Piehota, et al., No. 1:16-cv-375, Dkt. 47, (E.D. Va. \n2016) the court recently held that the “’central meaning of procedural due process’” is that \n“[p]arties whose rights are to be affected are entitled to be heard; and in order that they may \nenjoy that right they must first be notified.’” See id at 15 (Memorandum Opinion attached as \nExhibit  8).   The  Court went  on to state  that  the “Government’s ‘trust  us’ approach is \ninconsistent with the fundamental procedural protections applicable to the deprivation of a \nprotected liberty interest, including the right to be heard.”  See id. at 16. \n \n54 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 55 of 150\nThe Experiences of the Plaintiffs on the Federal Terrorist watchlist  \nBeing Treated as “Known or Suspected Terrorists” \nThe El Ali Family  \n \nPlaintiffs Rami Khaled El Ali and Mia Khaled El Ali \n(Family Members of a Watch Listed Plaintiff) \n \n186.  Rami Khaled El Ali (“Rami”) and Mia Khaled El Ali (“Mia”), by and through their \nmother and guardian Mariam Ahmad Ghaddar (“Ms. Ghaddar”), are United States citizens \nand practicing Muslims.   \n187.  Mia is 14-years-old and the daughter of Plaintiff Mr. El Ali.  \n188.  Rami is 11-years-old and the son of Plaintiff Mr. El Ali.  \n189.  In 2010, Mia and Rami relocated to Michigan and now live with their mother.  \nPrior to that, they lived with  their entire family,  including father, Plaintiff Mr.  El Ali, in \nBelgium.  \n190.  Mia is an active eighth grader with a passion for basketball and volleyball.  She \nhas been a part of her school’s basketball team for six years.  She’s played volleyball on and \noff for six years too.   \n191.  Rami is an active sixth grader with a love for basketball, baseball, soccer, and \nchess.     \n192.  Mia and Rami have a close relationship with their father.  Until Mr. El Ali was \nbarred from the United States, Mia and Rami had never celebrated a birthday without him.  \nEven though their father lives in Belgium, he would travel every single year to celebrate their \nbirthdays in Michigan.  \n193.  Mia’s and Rami’s father would visit them for approximately two weeks at a \ntime in March (to celebrate Mia’s birthday), in May (before school ends for summer), and in \n55 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 56 of 150\nNovember (to celebrate Rami’s birthday). Mr. El Ali would rent a condo and Mia and Rami \nwould stay with him during those visits.  \n194.  Since March 2017, Mia’s and Rami’s father has not been able to visit them in \nthe United States.  Instead, last year, they had to travel to and from Amsterdam, Netherlands \nalone on two occasions, so they could see and spend time with him.   \n195.  During one of Mia’s travels from Belgium to Michigan, Mia’s boarding pass was \nstamped  with  the  “SSSS” designation  indicating  that  she was  a  “known  or suspected \nterrorist.”  She was patted down at the security checkpoint.  Upon information and belief, \nMia received the “SSSS” designation and enhanced screening because of her relationship to \nher father, Mr. El Ali.   \n196.  At the gate and before being allowed to board, in public view and in front of \nher little brother, Rami, Mia was once again subjected to another round of screening.  Mia \nwas forced to remove her shoes and her laptop from her bag. Mia was subjected to chemical \nresidue testing on her laptop.  Additionally, Mia was questioned.   \n197.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Mia  was  subjected  to  enhanced  screening, \nchemical testing, and questioning by Belgium authorities due to her relationship to her \nfather,  Mr.  El  Ali  and  his  status  on  the  federal  terror watch  list  being  shared with \nNetherlandic authorities by Defendants.  \n198.  Because of Mr. El Ali’s status on Defendants’ watchlist and inability to enter \nthe United States, for the first time ever, Mia had to celebrate her birthday without her father \nin March 2018.  Her birthday had always been a happy and festive occasion for the family.  \nHowever, this year, Mia did not want to even have a birthday party.  She was angry, sad, and \nconfused as to why her father could not come spend time with her. Instead of celebrating her \n56 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 57 of 150\nbirthday with her father in person, she was only able to see him via a video phone call on \nFaceTime at which point she became extremely emotional and began to cry as he started to \ntalk.  \n199.  Mia is routinely asking her mother when she’s “going to see baba5?” Recently, \nshe expressed that she wants to move back to Belgium.  \n200.  Mia is a rising ninth grader.  She is excited for another year of volleyball and \nbasketball.  However, Mia wants to spend as much time with her father as possible this \nsummer.  Unfortunately, this upcoming year, volleyball  season starts weeks before the \nacademic school year.  Due to her father’s inability to travel to Michigan, Mia is forced to \nchoose between spending more time with her father in Belgium this summer or shortening \nher summer trip so she can return to Michigan and join her friends on the volleyball team. \nThis is a choice no 14-year-old should ever have to make.   \n201.  In May 2018, during a phone call with her father, Mia could not bring herself \nto discuss whether she would forgo part of her summer trip in Belgium to join the volleyball \nteam.  Feeling overwhelmed, she broke down and began to sob during the call.   \n202.  Because his father has not been able to visit,  Rami’s education has been \nadversely affected.  Rami’s grades have drastically taken a turn for the worse.   \n203.  Rami’s health is also being severely affected.  Rami is continuously depressed. \nEvery activity he participates in, Rami wishes his father was with him.  Whenever his father \nwould visit, they were inseparable; they would do everything together.   \n204.  To help with his education and depression, Rami’s mother has been forced to \nhire a tutor so that Rami can get more personal time to work on his emotions and grades.   \n                                                 \n5 Baba is an Arabic word of endearment  meaning “father” or “dad.”  \n57 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 58 of 150\n205.  Whenever Rami sees other children with their fathers, he routinely asks “when \nis baba gonna be able to come back?” It breaks his mother’s heart that she cannot provide \nhim with a concrete answer or reason for why his father cannot visit.   \n206.  Approximately every two weeks, Rami gets overwhelmed with the fact that his \nfather cannot visit him. When his mother asks him what’s wrong, Rami says that he misses \nhis father and begins to choke up and uncontrollably sob.   \n207.  While Rami excels in active sports, he is particularly fond of playing chess \nbecause his father taught him how to play.  Each time his father would visit, they would play \nchess together.  Nowadays, they are regulated to playing chess online.   \n208.   Rami’s father would visit and celebrate his birthday in November every year.  \nRami’s entire family—father, mother, and sister—would have a family dinner together.  They \nwould also have an extended family party at the house and a party for all of his friends at a \nkid-friendly place in Michigan.   \n209.  Because of his father’s inability to enter the United States, Rami’s father could \nnot attend his eleventh birthday.  As a result, Rami was depressed on his birthday.  He did \nnot want to have a birthday party without his dad.  Instead, Rami’s mom organized a small \nfamily gathering.  \n210.  Rami is a rising seventh grader. He is excited for another year of baseball and \nsoccer. Because Rami’s father cannot visit him in the United States, Rami is being forced to \nmiss the end of baseball season and the beginning of soccer so that he can go to Belgium and \nspend as much time with his father as possible.  This is a sacrifice no 11-year-old should ever \nhave to make.   \n58 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 59 of 150\n211.  Since her father has been barred from entering the United States, Mia has \nmissed out on many father-daughter moments that are instrumental in a young woman’s life.   \n212.  Since his father has been barred from entering the United States, Rami has \nmissed out on many father-son moments that are instrumental in a teenager’s life.   \n213.  Mia and Rami video chat on FaceTime with their father every day.   \n214.  Every young child needs a father figure in their life.  Mia and Rami need their \nfather; and, Defendants are the main cause that they are left without a father in the United \nStates.   \n215.  Because Defendants have improperly placed their father, Mr. El Ali, on the \nSelectee and/or No Fly List, which subsequently caused the revocation of his ESTA waiver \nand  placement  on  administrative  status  of  his  non-immigrant  visa,  Defendants  are \ninterfering with Mia’s and Rami’s liberty interest in their familial relations.  Defendants have \ndone so without providing Mia and Rami any due process.   \nPlaintiff Khaled El Ali \n(A Watch Listed Plaintiff) \n \n216.  Mr. El Ali is the father of Plaintiffs Mia Khaled El Ali (“Mia”) and Rami Khaled \nEl Ali (“Rami”).  \n217.  Pursuant to a custody agreement, Mia and Rami reside with their mother in \nthe United States year-round except for the summers and Christmas holidays which are \nspent in Belgium with their father, Mr. El Ali.   \n218.  In February 2017, Mr. El Ali traveled from Belgium to Michigan to celebrate \nMia’s 13th birthday.   \n59 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 60 of 150\n219.  Mr. El Ali’s flight into the U.S. originated from Amsterdam, Netherlands to \nDetroit Metropolitan Airport on Delta Airlines.   \n220.  While in Amsterdam, Mr. El Ali was not able to check-in online or at the airport \nkiosk.  Instead, he was directed to an airline representative for further assistance.   \n221.  At the ticket counter, after a delay, Mr. El Ali received his boarding pass.  Mr. \nEl Ali’s boarding passes was stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating  that he is \ndesignated as a “known or suspected” terrorist.   \n222.  At the gate, Mr. El Ali was selected for enhanced screening.  He was instructed \nto remove his shoes. Thereafter, chemical residue testing was conducted on his person and \ncarry-on in public view.  This was done even though Mr. El Ali had been cleared with no \nissues at the security checkpoint.   \n223.  Mr. El Ali felt ashamed and humiliated, especially because he was treated as a \n“known or suspected terrorist” in public view.   \n224.  Once Mr. El Ali landed in Detroit, Michigan, he went through customs and \ninserted his passport at the kiosk.  The kiosk displayed a red “X” and he was instructed to \nproceed to a CBP officer for further processing.   \n225.  The CBP officer took Mr. El Ali’s fingerprints and interrogated him.  Thereafter, \nhe was taken to secondary inspection and waited until  plain clothed  officers arrived to \ninterrogate him in a private room.  \n226.  The officers interrogated him about his past, work and travel history, and his \nfamily.  They interrogated him about where he grew up; what he does in Lebanon when he \nvisits; where he stays where he goes to Lebanon; and if he knows anyone that has any legal \nproblems.  \n60 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 61 of 150\n227.  Mr. El Ali was forced to unlock his phone.  The officers searched his cell phone \nand interrogated him about his contacts.  The officers also searched through his photographs \nfor approximately 40 minutes.   \n228.  Mr. El Ali was interrogated for almost 2 hours. Thereafter, he was allowed \nentry into the  United States.   Prior trips to the United  States  have resulted in  similar \ntreatment.   \n229.  Mr. El Ali entered the U.S. on an Electronic System for Travel Authorization \n(“ESTA”)  waiver.    The ESTA  program is  an  automated system  used to determine  the \neligibility of visitors to travel to the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program.  Approved ESTA \napplications are valid for a period of two years, or until the passport expires, whichever \ncomes first, and multiple trips to the United States may be made without the traveler having \nto re-apply for another ESTA waiver.    \n230.  On March 2, 2017, within days of entering the United States, Mr. El Ali received \nan email informing him that his ESTA Travel Authorization Status had changed.   \n231.  After celebrating Mia’s birthday, Mr. El Ali returned to Belgium on or about \nMarch 11, 2017.   \n232.  From 2002 to 2017, Mr. El Ali was subjected to substantially similar treatment \nas described above.  \n233.  His boarding passes for his flights are routinely stamped with  the “SSSS” \ndesignation, indicating that he has been designated by Defendants as a “known or suspected \nterrorist.”  \n234.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass.  \n61 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 62 of 150\n235.  Rather, Mr. El Ali is directed to an airline representative, who then contacts \nDefendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that can take a very \nlong time.  \n236.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it.  \n237.  Mr. El Ali is routinely subjected to enhanced screening. Mr. El Ali feels ashamed \nand humiliated, especially because he is routinely treated as a “known or suspected terrorist” \nin public view and in front of his children and former wife when they travel with him and \nbecause his family is delayed and humiliated because they are traveling with Mr. El Ali.  \n238.  On or about March 23, 2017, Mr. El Ali went to the U.S. Embassy in Brussels, \nBelgium to interview for a non-immigrant visa.  During the interview, Mr. El Ali was asked if \nhe had ever been to flight school, what he does for a living, and what he’ll be doing in the \nUnited States.   \n239.  At the U.S. Embassy, Mr. El Ali was informed that he was not approved for the \nvisa,  that  additional  security  checks  were  needed,  and  that  his  application  is  under \nadministrative processing.   \n240.  Mr. El Ali is a dedicated and committed father.  Since his children relocated to \nthe United States in 2010 after his divorce and up until February 2017, Mr. El Ali had visited \nhis children, Mia and Rami, every year during the following times:  \na.  March – for approximately two weeks  to visit  and celebrate Mia’s \nbirthday;  \n62 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 63 of 150\nb.  May – before Mia’s and Rami’s school year ends for summer vacation. \nMia and Rami would accompany Mr. El Ali to Belgium once the school year ended; and \nc.  November – to celebrate Rami’s birthday.  \n241.  Until February 2017 when Defendants revoked Mr. El Ali’s ESTA waiver and \nbarred him from the United States, Mr. El Ali had never missed his children’s birthdays.  \n242.  Upon information and belief, Mr. El Ali’s ESTA waiver was revoked because of \nhis status on the federal terror watch list.  \n243.  Upon information and belief, Mr. El Ali’s non-immigrant visa was not approved \nand instead has been placed on administrative processing since March 2017 because of his \nstatus on Defendants’ federal terror watch list.    \n244.  Recently, Mia visited Mr. El Ali in Amsterdam, Netherlands.  Her boarding pass \ncontained an “SSSS” designation indicating she is a “known or suspected terrorist.”  Upon \ninformation and belief, Mia was subjected to this designation because she is Mr. El Ali’s \ndaughter.  \n245.  Upon information and belief, Mr. El Ali remains on the federal terror watch list.   \nPlaintiff Mutasem Jardaneh \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n246.  On August 9, 2017, Mr. Jardaneh was returning from a brief trip to Canada \nthrough the Ambassador Bridge land port of entry in Michigan with his sister, brother-in-\nlaw, and four-year-old nephew.   \n247.  Upon presenting the primary CBP officer with  his passport card, the CBP \nofficer pressed a button to alert other CBP officers and instructed him to place his hands on \nthe steering wheel and look forward. \n63 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 64 of 150\n248.  Several armed CBP officers immediately  surrounded Mr. Jardaneh and his \nfamily on all sides with their hands on their hips near their guns. \n249.  The CBP officers ordered Mr. Jardaneh to exit the car, hands first, and to walk \nbackwards until instructed to stop.  Thereafter, he was detained.  \n250.  The CBP officers then ordered his brother-in-law out of the car, hands first, \nand to walk backwards until instructed to stop.   \n251.  Mr. Jardaneh’s sister and nephew were also forced to exit the vehicle and walk \nto the CBP officers.  \n252.  Then, Mr. Jardaneh was escorted by the CBP officers to a holding cell and \ndetained, where he was subjected to an invasive pat down, fingerprinted, searched and \ninterrogated for over four hours.  His belongings were also seized and searched. \n253.  Mr.  Jardaneh’s  brother-in-law  was  detained  in  a  separate  room  and \nthoroughly searched.   \n254.  While Mr. Jardaneh was being interrogated, Mr. Jardaneh requested to contact \nan attorney; however, the CBP officers denied his request, prevented him from contacting an \nattorney, and continued to interrogate him. \n255.  The CBP officers confiscated his cell phone, and upon information and belief, \ndownloaded the information and data from his cell phone without his consent. The CBP \nofficers temporarily  confiscated Mr.  Jardaneh’s brother-in-law’s cell  phone also.   Upon \ninformation  and  belief,  Defendants downloaded  the  information  from  Mr.  Jardaneh’s \nbrother-in-law’s cell phone.  \n64 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 65 of 150\n256.  Mr. Jardaneh had an anxiety attack as a result of the treatment he was being \nsubjected to.  An ambulance was called and paramedics arrived to take Mr. Jardaneh to an \nemergency room at a nearby hospital.   \n257.  The CBP officers handcuffed Mr. Jardaneh to the stretcher in the ambulance \nand accompanied him to the hospital where he received medical treatment.  The CBP officers \ntold the hospital that Mr. Jardaneh was a “prisoner.” \n258.  Defendants did not return Mr. Jardaneh’s cell phone until four or five days later \nvia mail.  \n259.  Mr. Jardaneh felt ashamed and humiliated that his family and the hospital staff \nwitnessed him being treated by the government as a criminal and a “known or suspected \nterrorist.” \n260.  Moreover, Mr.  Jardaneh also felt  ashamed and humiliated  that  his  family \nmembers that were traveling  with  him  were also treated as criminals  and “known or \nsuspected terrorists” just because they were traveling with him.  \n261.  Ever since this encounter, Mr. Jardaneh has suffered from anxiety and trauma \nand has been taking prescription medications to help him cope. \n262.  A few days later, Mr. Jardaneh arrived at Detroit Metropolitan Airport to board \nhis flight to Florida. \n263.  He was unable to check-in online or at the airport kiosk.   Rather, he was \ndirected to an airline representative for further assistance. \n264.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, Mr. \nJardaneh had to wait approximately an hour before the airline representative obtained \nclearance for Mr. Jardaneh to board his flight. \n65 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 66 of 150\n265.  His boarding pass was stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he \nwas designated as a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n266.  Once Mr. Jardaneh arrived at the TSA security checkpoint,  he provided his \nboarding pass and identification documents to the TSA agent stationed at the entrance to the \nTSA security checkpoint.   \n267.  The boarding pass scanner indicated a red light when Mr. Jardaneh’s boarding \npass was scanned.   \n268.  Mr. Jardaneh was escorted to a different line than the other travelers passing \nthrough the TSA security checkpoint and subjected to enhanced screening.   \n269.  Mr. Jardaneh was subjected to an extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including  a search of his groin area, an extensive search of all his  personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings in public view at \nthe TSA checkpoint.  Mr. Jardaneh felt the intense glares of other travelers staring at him \nwhile  he  was  being  screened.    A  TSA  agent  confiscated  Mr.  Jardaneh’s prescription \neyeglasses.  The TSA screening lasted forty-five minutes.  \n270.  Once Mr. Jardaneh finally arrived at the gate, several TSA agents were waiting \nfor him to arrive.  The TSA agents had with them a cart with chemical testing machines.   \n271.  While Mr. Jardaneh waited to board his flight, he noticed two air marshals \nfollowing him throughout the airport.   \n272.  At the gate and before being allowed to board, in public view, Mr. Jardaneh was \nonce again subjected to an invasive and lengthy pat down, all of his personal belongings were \nsearched again, and he and his belongings were subjected to another round of chemical \n66 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 67 of 150\nresidue testing despite the fact that he had just cleared security with no issues at the TSA \nsecurity checkpoint. \n273.  Once on the airplane, the two air marshals that were tailing him inside the \nairport sat near him, one of each side, and surveilled him during the flight.   \n274.  Mr. Jardaneh’s roommate and her ex-husband were both interrogated about \nMr. Jardaneh. \n275.  Mr. Jardaneh became terrified for his life and safety; and as a result of the \nabove-described experiences, he left the United States and applied for asylum in Canada \nseeking protection from the United States government. \n276.  Mr.  Jardaneh has lost  business  opportunities as  a  direct  result  of being \ndesignated on the federal terror watchlist. \n277.  Moreover, upon information and belief, Mr. Jardaneh’s movements and online \nactivities are being surveilled by Defendants without a warrant. \n278.  Mr. Jardaneh filed a redress application through DHS TRIP.  On September 29, \n2017, Mr. Jardaneh received a letter as described in paragraph 178 and was assigned a \nRedress Control Number.   \n279.  As a result of being placed on the federal terror watchlist, Mr. Jardaneh will be \nclosing two businesses that he has operated at or near the beginning of 2017.   \n280.  Mr. Jardaneh operates a real estate company and a consultant business.  Both \nbusiness ventures require significant travel.  Due to the difficult and hassle associated with \nhis  travel,  Mr.  Jardaneh has  not  been able  to  freely  travel  and  explore his  business \nopportunities.  \n67 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 68 of 150\n281.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Jardaneh remains on Defendants’ federal \nterror watchlist.  \nPlaintiff Bilal Abdurrashid \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n282.  Mr. Abdurrashid is a former executive of Lockheed Martin.  In his decades long \nservice in the Aerospace and Defense industry, Mr. Abdurrashid has held a Secret Security \nClearance.  Additionally,  Mr. Abdurrashid holds a Transportation Worker Identification \nCredential (“TWIC”).   \n283.  Mr. Abdurrashid is an avid outdoor sportsman.  He loves to camp and fish; and \nhe is routinely seen enjoying the outdoors on his boats.  In accordance with the Seafarers’ \nIdentity Documents Convention (Revised), 2003, of the International Labor Organization, \nMr. Abdurrashid operates his offshore boat pursuant to his Merchant Mariner Credential \nissued by the United States Coast Guard National Maritime Center.   \n284.  Mr. Abdurrashid is also a staunch believer in the Second Amendment and \nowns several guns.  He has a Florida Concealed Carry Permit.   \n285.  In  order to  obtain  the  above  licenses,  credentials,  and  clearances,  Mr. \nAbdurrashid was required to submit fingerprints that were checked against the Florida \nInformation Center database, the National Crime Information Center database and National \nInstant Criminal Background Check System for disqualifying offenses. \n286.  In June 2017, Mr. Abdurrashid arrived at an Orlando, Florida area airport for \na trip to Morocco.  His itinerary was Orlando to New York to Marrakech, Morocco.     \n287.  Mr. Abdurrashid was traveling to visit family with his wife and child.  Mr. \nAbdurrashid’s family  witnessed the entire treatment that he was subjected to that day, \ndescribed below.   \n68 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 69 of 150\n288.  At first, Mr. Abdurrashid was prevented from checking in online and at the \nairport kiosk.  Instead, he was directed to an airline representative for further assistance.   \n289.  Mr. Abdurrashid’s and his family’s boarding passes were stamped with the \n“SSSS” designation indicating  that they each have been labeled as “known or suspected \nterrorists.”  \n290.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, the \nairline representative informed Mr. Abdurrashid that she could not issue boarding passes \nfor him or his family.  Mr. Abdurrashid was told that he and his family were barred from \nchecking in.  After several phone calls and a long delay, the airline representative was able \nto obtain clearance from Defendants so that Mr. Abdurrashid and his family could board his \nflight.   \n291.  Once Mr. Abdurrashid and his family arrived at the TSA security checkpoint, \nthey provided their boarding passes and identification documents to the TSA agent stationed \nat the entrance of the TSA security checkpoint.    \n292.  Mr. Abdurrashid and his family were escorted to a different line than the other \ntravelers passing through the TSA security checkpoint and subjected to enhanced screening.   \n293.  Mr. Abdurrashid was subjected to an extensive and lengthy screening, an \ninvasive pat down including a search of his groin area, in addition to a TSA male agent placing \nhis fingers inside and around Mr. Abdurrashid’s waist, an extensive search of all his personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings in public view and \nin front of his family.  Mr. Abdurrashid’s wife and thirteen-year-old son received the same \ntreatment.    \n69 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 70 of 150\n294.  When Mr. Abdurrashid and his family arrived in New York’s JFK airport to \nboard their connecting flight to Morocco, they were forced to go through the entire TSA \nenhanced screening process, described above, all over again.   \n295.  On July 31, 2017, Mr. Abdurrashid and his family arrived at the airport in \nMarrakech, Morocco for their flights to New York with a stop at the Casablanca, Morocco \nairport.    \n296.  In  Marrakech, Mr. Abdurrashid’s wife  and son were able to  obtain their \nboarding passes.  However, the airline representative could not issue Mr. Abdurrashid a \nboarding  pass.    After  several  unanswered  calls,  the  airline  representative  gave  Mr. \nAbdurrashid a boarding pass but only to Casablanca.   \n297.  At the Casablanca airport, the airline representative made several calls to the \nUnited States before the airline representative could obtain clearance for Mr. Abdurrashid \nto board his flight to New York.   \n298.  Mr. Abdurrashid’s and his family’s boarding passes were stamped with the \n“SSSS”  designation  indicating  that  they  were  each  labeled  as  a  “known  or  suspected \nterrorist.”  \n299.  Mr. Abdurrashid and his family underwent enhanced screening, as described \nabove, before being allowed to board their flight.   \n300.  When they landed in New York, the airplane’s loudspeakers instructed the \npassengers to have their passports out.  Two armed plainclothes CBP officers checked the \npassengers’ passports as they stepped out of the airplane.  When Mr. Abdurrashid gave his \npassport to the CBP officers, they told him that he was the person they were looking for.    \nThey escorted Mr. Abdurrashid and his family in public view to get their luggage.   \n70 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 71 of 150\n301.  Mr. Abdurrashid was escorted to secondary inspection where he was detained \nand interrogated.  He was detained in a separate room from his wife and child.   \n302.  The CBP officers confiscated Mr. Abdurrashid’s cell phone.  They proceeded to \nsearch his cell phone and social media.  Mr. Abdurrashid also had his luggage searched.   \n303.  While he was detained, the CBP officers also interrogated Mr. Abdurrashid.  He \nwas questioned about his trip to Morocco and his social media usage. At the same time, Mr. \nAbdurrashid’s wife was interrogated about her background.  But for a weather delay, Mr. \nAbdurrashid and his family would have missed their flight from New York to Orlando.   \n304.  After being allowed to leave by CBP, Mr. Abdurrashid and his family rushed to \nget their boarding passes for their flight  to Orlando.  At first, his family received their \nboarding passes without an “SSSS” designation.  However, once the airline representative \nrealized that his family was traveling with Mr. Abdurrashid, his wife and son had their \nboarding passes stamped with the “SSSS” designation indicating that they each have been \nlabeled as a “known or suspected terrorist.”  Mr. Abdurrashid’s boarding pass was stamped \nwith the “SSSS” designation too.   \n305.  Mr.  Abdurrashid  and  his  family  were  again  subjected  to  the  enhanced \nscreening at the TSA security checkpoint in public view as described above.   \n306.  At the gate, Mr. Abdurrashid was allowed to board his flight.  However, as Mr. \nAbdurrashid was taking his seat inside the plane, he was informed that his wife and son were \nbeing prevented from boarding.  Mr. Abdurrashid returned to the gate area to speak with the \nairline representatives.   \n307.  After a lengthy delay, Mr. Abdurrashid’s family obtained clearance to board \nthe flight with him.   \n71 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 72 of 150\n308.  Mr. Abdurrashid has experienced similar enhanced screening and humiliation \nwhen traveling by air ever since 2014.  \n309.  His boarding passes for his flights are routinely stamped with  the “SSSS” \ndesignation, indicating that he has been designated by Defendants as a “known or suspected \nterrorist.” \n310.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass. \n311.  Rather, Mr. Abdurrashid is directed each time to an airline representative, who \nthen contacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that \ncan take a very long time. \n312.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it. \n313.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Mr. Abdurrashid to substantially similar routine, extensive and lengthy \nscreening, an invasive pat down including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of \nall of his personal belongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings \nat the TSA security checkpoint, in public view and in front of his family. \n314.  Moreover, when Mr. Abdurrashid’s family is traveling with him, they are also \ntreated as “known or suspected terrorists” just because they are traveling with him. \n315.  Mr. Abdurrashid minimizes his travel in order to avoid the humiliation and \nhassle associated with being labeled as a “known or suspected terrorist” by Defendants \nbecause of his status on Defendants’ federal terror watchlist.  As a result, Mr. Abdurrashid \n72 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 73 of 150\nand his family have missed several trips they would have gone on but for Mr. Abdurrashid’s \nstatus on Defendants’’ federal terror watchlist.  \n316.  For instance, in April 2018, Mr. Abdurrashid and his family were invited to his \nwife’s niece’s wedding in Washington, D.C.  However, they did not want to go through the \nhumiliation and hassle of travel.  Because the drive to Washington, D.C. from Orlando is \nthirteen hours, Mr. Abdurrashid and his family could not attend the wedding.   \n317.  On other occasions, Mr. Abdurrashid and his family have forgone skiing trips \nwith family friends and trips to see his adult children and grandchildren.   \n318.  As  a  result  of  his  status  on  Defendants’  federal  terror  watchlist,  Mr. \nAbdurrashid is only able to see his grandchildren if they travel to Orlando to visit him.  If he \nwas not on Defendants’ federal terror watchlist and subjected to humiliating and invasive \nenhanced screenings, he and his family would visit his adult children and grandchildren.  \n319.  Since he and his family are unable to travel unless they undergo humiliating \nand invasive public enhanced screenings, Mr. Abdurrashid’s thirteen-year-old son is not able \nto form a stronger bond with his adult brothers and sister and nieces and nephews.   \n320.  In February 2018, Mr. Abdurrashid purchased a Smith  and Wesson 9mm \nfirearm.  When Mr. Abdurrashid went to pick up the firearm from the dealer in Florida, he \ncompleted  the  Florida  Department of  Law  Enforcement Firearm  Purchase application \n(“FDLE Application”).   \n321.  After a three-day delay, the local gun dealer contacted Mr. Abdurrashid and \ninformed him that his FDLE Application was denied.  As a result, Mr. Abdurrashid was not \nable to complete his purchase of the Smith and Wesson firearm.  \n73 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 74 of 150\n322.  Mr. Abdurrashid contacted FDLE and requested the reasons why FDLE denied \nhis application.  The FDLE representative informed Mr. Abdurrashid that he could not inform \nhim  why his application  was denied but that  he would  inform Mr. Abdurrashid if Mr. \nAbdurrashid was able to guess the reason for his application’s denial.  \n323.  Mr. Abdurrashid was not able to guess the reason of his application’s denial.  \nThe FDLE representative refused to divulge any information to Mr. Abdurrashid as to why \nhis application was denied.   \n324.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Abdurrashid’s FDLE Application was denied \nbecause of his status on Defendants’ federal terror watchlist.   \n325.  Mr. Abdurrashid has filed a DHS TRIP inquiry.  He has since received a letter \nas described in paragraph 178 above and was assigned a Redress Control Number.  \n326.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Abdurrashid remains on the federal terror \nwatch list. \nPlaintiff Mohammad Paryavi \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n327.  On June 4, 2017, Mr. Paryavi arrived at a Washington, D.C. area airport for a \nflight to Houston, Texas.   \n328.  Mr. Paryavi was traveling with a co-worker for a business trip who witnessed \nthe entire treatment that Mr. Paryavi was subjected to that day, described below.   \n329.  At first, Mr. Paryavi was unable to check-in online or at the airport kiosk.  \nRather, he was directed to an airline representative for further assistance. \n74 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 75 of 150\n330.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, Mr. \nParyavi and his coworker had to wait almost forty minutes before the airline representative \nobtained clearance from Defendants for Mr. Paryavi to board his flight. \n331.  The boarding passes of both Mr. Paryavi and his coworker were stamped with \nthe “SSSS” designation, indicating that they were both designated as “known or suspected \nterrorists.” \n332.  Once Mr. Paryavi and his coworker arrived at the TSA security checkpoint, \nthey  provided  their  boarding passes  and  identification  documents to  the  CBP  officer \nstationed at the entrance to the TSA security checkpoint.   \n333.  The boarding pass scanner indicated a red light when Mr. Paryavi’s boarding \npass was scanned.   \n334.  Mr. Paryavi and his co-worker were both escorted to a different line than the \nother travelers passing through the TSA security checkpoint and subjected to enhanced \nscreening.   \n335.  Mr. Paryavi was subjected to an extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including  a search of his groin area, an extensive search of  all his  personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings in public view and \nin front of his coworker.   \n336.  Once Mr. Paryavi and his coworker finally arrived at the gate, approximately \nsix to ten TSA agents were waiting for Mr. Paryavi to arrive. \n337.  The TSA agents had with them a cart with chemical testing machines.   \n338.  At the gate and before being allowed to board, in public view and in front of \nhis coworker, Mr. Paryavi was once again subjected to an invasive and lengthy pat down, all \n75 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 76 of 150\nof his personal belongings were searched again, and he and his belongings were subjected to \nanother round of chemical residue testing despite the fact that he had just cleared security \nwith no issues at the TSA security checkpoint. \n339.  Then, when Mr. Paryavi scanned his boarding pass at the gate to board their \nflight, the scanner once again indicated a red light. \n340.  Mr.  Paryavi and  his  coworker were once again  delayed  until  the  airline \nrepresentative at the gate finally obtained clearance from Defendants to allow Mr. Paryavi to \nboard his flight. \n341.  Mr. Paryavi felt ashamed and humiliated, especially because he was treated as \na “known or suspected terrorist” in public view and in front of his coworker and because his \ncoworker was also delayed, humiliated and subjected to extensive screening just because he \nwas traveling with Mr. Paryavi. \n342.  Ever since that trip, every time Mr. Paryavi travels by air, he is subjected to \nsubstantially similar treatment.  \n343.  His boarding passes for his flights are routinely  stamped with  the “SSSS” \ndesignation, indicating that he has been designated by Defendants as a “known or suspected \nterrorist.” \n344.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass. \n345.  Rather Mr. Paryavi is directed each time to an airline representative, who then \ncontacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that can \ntake a very long time. \n76 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 77 of 150\n346.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it. \n347.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Mr. Paryavi to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive pat \ndown including  a search of his  groin area, an  extensive  search of all  of his  personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings – twice – at the TSA \nsecurity  checkpoint  and  again  at  the  gate,  in  public  view  and  in  front  of  his  travel \ncompanions. \n348.  He then has to wait again at the gate for an airline representative to obtain \nclearance from Defendants a second time to board his flight, even though Defendants already \nprovided clearance for him to board his flight prior to his boarding pass being printed in the \nfirst place. \n349.  Moreover, oftentimes the people that Mr. Paryavi travels with are also treated \nas “known or suspected terrorists” just because they are traveling with him. \n350.  On or about January 2018, Mr. Paryavi was re-entering the United States with \na business client, his wife and his daughter, all of whom witnessed the treatment he was \nsubjected to that day, described below. \n351.  Once his flight landed in Dulles International Airport in Virginia, there were \ntwo CBP officers waiting for him before he arrived at passport control.   \n352.  Mr. Paryavi was escorted from the gate to an interrogation room where he was \ndetained and interrogated by FBI agents about his travel and his work.  All of his personal \nbelongings were also searched. \n77 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 78 of 150\n353.  Mr.  Paryavi applied  to both  TSA  Pre✓ ® and  Global Entry,  TSA  and CBP \nprograms respectively that allow for expedited screening at ports of entry.  Both applications \nwere denied without providing any explanation. \n354.  Upon information and belief, his applications to participate in the TSA Pre✓ ® \nand Global Entry programs were denied because of, upon information and belief, his status \non the federal terror watch list. \n355.  Mr. Paryavi has been interrogated by FBI agents about his Islamic religious \nbeliefs and practices and political opinions, including but not limited to, questions about \nwhat mosque he belongs to, how far his mosque is, who the imam is at his mosque, and \ndetailed questions about his political opinions about Iran. \n356.  Upon information and belief, his answers to the questions asked by the FBI \nagents were factors that contributed to his designation on the federal terror watch list. \n357.  Mr. Paryavi has filed a DHS TRIP inquiry.  He has since received a letter as \ndescribed in paragraph 178 above and was assigned a Redress Control Number.  \n358.  Because of the travel issues resulting from his status on Defendants’ federal \nterror watchlist, Mr. Paryavi now experiences anxiety when traveling because he knows that \nhe will be subjected to the invasive and humiliating screenings described above.   \n359.  To ensure that his travel plans are not interrupted, Mr. Paryavi arrives at the \nairport four hours prior to takeoff.  \n360.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Paryavi remains on the federal terror watch \nlist. \n \n \n78 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 79 of 150\nThe Wehelie Family \nPlaintiff Hawa Wehelie \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n361.  Plaintiff Hawa Wehelie is the daughter of Plaintiffs Abdirizak Wehelie (“Mr. \nWehelie”) and Shamsa Hashi Noor’s (“Mrs. Noor”) and sister of Plaintiff Fatima Wehelie’s \n(“Ms. F. Wehelie”) (collectively referred to as “Wehelie Family”).   \n362.  On October 22, 2017, Ms. Hawa Wehelie and her family members were re-\nentering the United States through the Peace Bridge land port of entry in New York after a \ntrip to Canada.  \n363.  After Ms. Hawa Wehelie handed her identification information to the primary \ninspection officer, her vehicle was immediately surrounded by several armed CBP officers.  \nShe, along with her family members, were ordered to exit the vehicle and detained.  They \nwere instructed to leave their personal belongings in the vehicle.   \n364.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie and her family were escorted by the armed CBP officers to \nsecondary inspection.  They were also interrogated.   \n365.  CBP  confiscated  Ms.  Hawa  Wehelie’s  cell  phone and  laptop  without  her \nconsent.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s electronics were not returned to her until approximately two \nmonths later.  Upon information and belief, Defendants downloaded and made a copy of Ms. \nHawa Wehelie’s cell phone and laptop data and information without her consent.   \n366.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie was scared for her and her family’s safety.  Ms. Hawa \nWehelie was ashamed and humiliated because of the treatment she received.  Additionally, \nshe was  ashamed and humiliated  that her family  was treated as “known or suspected \nterrorists” because of their relation to her.  \n79 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 80 of 150\n367.  On January 7, 2018, Ms. Wehelie and her sister, Plaintiff Fatima Wehelie, were \nreturning to the United States through Pearson International Airport.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s \nboarding pass was stamped  with  the “SSSS” designation,  indicating  that she had been \ndesignated by Defendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n368.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on her boarding pass, as protocol, the \nagents then subjected Ms. Hawa Wehelie to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an \ninvasive pat down, and an extensive search of all of her personal belongings and chemical \nresidue testing of her person and his belongings in public view and in front of her sister.    \n369.  Upon information and belief, Ms. Hawa Wehelie was subjected to the above \ndescribed treatment by the Canadian authorities due to her status on the federal terror \nwatchlist being shared with Canadian authorities by Defendants.  \n370.  After going through the security checkpoint, and before boarding the plane, \nMs. Hawa Wehelie and her sister scanned their passports at the Automated Passport Control \nkiosk.  The printed declaration form contained an “X” over Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s and Ms. F. \nWehelie’s photos.  They were instructed to go to a Customs officer.   \n371.  When Ms. Hawa Wehelie and her sister presented their declaration forms to a \nCustoms officer, they were detained and interrogated.     \n372.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie and her sister were detained in separate rooms so that CBP \nofficers could interrogate them separately.   \n373.  The interrogation rooms are situated across the hallway from small holding \ncells that look like jail cells; and, upon seeing them, Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s sister felt faint and \nlight-headed.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie feared for her sister’s safety because she was afraid that \nthey would both be arrested and detained in the holding cells.  \n80 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 81 of 150\n374.  CBP Officer Bustamante interrogated Ms. Hawa Wehelie for approximately \none hour about whether she attended church, whether she is enrolled in religious courses, \nwhat organizations she belongs to, whether she financially supports her family members, \nwhether she has family in Somalia, where she traveled during the past 10 years, and why she \ndoes not practice as an attorney. \n375.  After the interrogation, Officer Bustamante confiscated Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s \ncell phone, and upon information and belief, downloaded the information from her cell \nphone without her consent. \n376.  The entire process lasted nearly four hours. As a result, Ms. Hawa Wehelie and \nher sister missed their flight and were forced to reschedule their flight for the next morning.  \n377.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie felt ashamed and humiliated, especially because she was \ntreated as a “known or suspected terrorist” in public view and in front of her sister, and \nbecause her sister was delayed, humiliated, subjected to detention and interrogation, and \nmissed her flight because of traveling with Ms. Hawa Wehelie and because of her relation to \nMs. Hawa Wehelie.   \n378.  The next morning, Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s boarding pass, again, contained the \n“SSSS” designation, indicating  that she had been designated as a “known  or suspected \nterrorist.”  \n379.  As the previous day, upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on her boarding pass, \nas protocol, the agents then subjected Ms. Hawa Wehelie to routine, extensive and lengthy \nscreening, an invasive pat down, and an extensive search of all of her personal belongings \nand chemical residue testing of her person and his belongings in public view and in front of \nher sister.    \n81 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 82 of 150\n380.  Upon information and belief, Ms. Hawa Wehelie was subjected to the above \ndescribed treatment by the Canadian authorities due to her status on the federal terror \nwatchlist being shared with Canadian authorities by Defendants.  \n381.  After going through the security checkpoint, and before boarding the plane, \nMs. Hawa Wehelie and her sister scanned their passports at the Automated Passport Control \nkiosk.  The printed declaration form contained an “X” over Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s and Ms. F. \nWehelie’s photos.  They were instructed to go to a Customs officer.   \n382.  While waiting in line at customs and before reaching the counter, and in public \nview, a CBP officer approached Ms. Hawa Wehelie and her sister and escorted them into a \nback room for interrogation.  \n383.  CBP officers interrogated Ms. Hawa Wehelie and her sister about where they \nstayed the night before and who had picked them up from the airport. \n384.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie and her sister were forced to write their responses to each \nquestion on a piece of paper.  \n385.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie felt ashamed and humiliated, especially because she was \ntreated as a “known or suspected terrorist” in public view and in front of her sister, and \nbecause her  sister  was  delayed,  humiliated,  subjected  to  detention  and  interrogation \nbecause of traveling  with  Ms. Hawa Wehelie and because of her relation to Ms. Hawa \nWehelie.   \n386.  On July 31, 2018, Ms. Hawa Wehelie and her parents were re-entering the \nUnited through the Peace Bridge land port of entry in New York.  \n82 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 83 of 150\n387.  Immediately  after they presented their passports to the CBP officer, their \nvehicle was surrounded by six or seven armed CBP officers.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie and her \nparents were ordered to exit the vehicle and detained.   \n388.  CBP Officer Tucker interrogated Ms. Hawa Wehelie and her father about the \nlocations of family members, where they traveled, where they stayed, where they worked, \nwhere they lived, and asked them to provide his phone number, e-mail address, and the \naddresses where they stayed in Canada.  \n389.  Thereafter, CBP confiscated Ms. Hawa Wehelie cell phone for approximately \n45 minutes, and upon information and belief, downloaded the information and data from her \ncell phone without her consent.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie and her family’s vehicle and belongings \nwere also searched.   \n390.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie felt ashamed and humiliated, especially because she was \ntreated as a “known or suspected terrorist” in front of her parents.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie was \nalso scared for her safety and her parents’ safety as she feared that an armed CBP officer may \nkill them if they made any sudden moves.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie suffered anxiety because of the \nabove described treatment.   \n391.   Ms. Hawa Wehelie also felt ashamed and humiliated that her parents were \ndelayed, humiliated, subjected to detention and interrogation because of traveling with Ms. \nHawa Wehelie and because of their relation to Ms. Hawa Wehelie.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s \nparents suffered from anxiety because of the above described treatment.   \n392.  Upon information and belief, Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s family members that travel \nwith her are subjected to the above described treatment because of their relation to her and \nbecause of her status on Defendants’ federal terror watchlist.   \n83 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 84 of 150\n393.  Upon information and belief, Ms. Hawa Wehelie remains on the federal terror \nwatchlist.  \nPlaintiffs Abdirizak Wehelie, Shamsa Hashi Noor, and Fatima Wehelie \n(Family Members of a Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n394.  Plaintiff Abdirizak Wehelie (“Mr. Wehelie”) is Plaintiffs Hawa Wehelie’s and \nFatima Wehelie’s (“F. Wehelie”) father and Plaintiff  Shamsa Hashi Noor’s (“Mrs. Noor”) \nhusband (collectively referred to as “Wehelie Family”).   \n395.  Plaintiff Mrs. Noor is Plaintiffs Hawa Wehelie’s and F. Wehelie’s mother and \nMr. Wehelie’s wife.  \n396.  Plaintiff F. Wehelie is Plaintiff Hawa Wehelie’s sister and daughter of Plaintiffs \nMr. Wehelie and Mrs. Noor.   \n397.  Since  approximately  2014,  as  a  result  of  Ms.  Hawa  Wehelie’s  watchlist \ndesignation, the Wehelie Family is regularly subjected to enhanced screening, unreasonable \ndelays, and interrogations.  \n398.  In May 2015, Mr. Wehelie, arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport \nin Virginia for an international trip to Somalia.   \n399.  When Mr. Wehelie arrived at the gate, two TSA agents and an FBI agent were \nwaiting for him.  \n400.  At the gate and before being allowed to board, in public view, an FBI agent \ninterrogated Mr. Wehelie about why he had purchased a one-way ticket,  why one of his \nchildren applied for a passport, and about his sons.  Mr. Wehelie was scared, confused, and \nhumiliated because he was interrogated by the FBI in public.  He was made to feel like a \ncriminal.   \n84 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 85 of 150\n401.  On January 7, 2018, Ms. Hawa Wehelie and Ms. F. Wehelie were returning to \nthe United  States through Toronto Pearson International Airport.   Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s \nboarding pass was stamped  with  the “SSSS” designation,  indicating  that she had been \ndesignated by Defendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.”  \n402.  After going through the CBP security checkpoint, and before boarding the \nplane, Ms. Hawa Wehelie and Ms. F. Wehelie scanned their passports at the Automated \nPassport Control kiosk.  The printed declaration form contained an “X” over Ms. Hawa \nWehelie’s and Ms. F. Wehelie’s photos.  They were instructed to go to a Customs officer.   \n403.  When Ms. Hawa Wehelie and Ms. F. Wehelie presented their declaration forms \nto a Customs officer, they were detained and interrogated.     \n404.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie and Ms. F.  Wehelie were detained in separate rooms so that \nCBP officers could interrogate them separately.   \n405.  The interrogation rooms are situated across the hallway from smallholding \ncells that look like jail cells; and, upon seeing them, Ms. F. Wehelie felt faint and light-headed. \nShe feared for her sister’s safety because she was afraid that they would both be arrested \nand detained in the holding cells.  \n406.  CBP officer Ramos interrogated Ms. F. Wehelie about where she stayed in \nToronto, who she traveled with, where she lived, what she does in Virginia, where she went \nto school, where she lives in Virginia, who she lives with and who her siblings are.  \n407.  After being subjected to lengthy interrogations, the Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s and \nMs. F. Wehelie’s luggage, which were pulled after being checked-in, were searched by CBP \nofficers.   Ms. Hawa Wehelie and Ms. F. Wehelie had to check in their luggage again. \n85 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 86 of 150\n408.  Officer Bustamante confiscated Ms. Hawa Wehelie and Ms. F. Wehelie’s cell \nphones and demanded the passwords to each phone.  \n409.  The phones were returned after one hour and, upon information and belief, \nCBP downloaded Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s and Ms. F. Wehelie’s data and content from their cell \nphones. \n410.  The entire process lasted nearly four hours and as a result, Ms. Hawa Wehelie \nand Ms. F. Wehelie missed their flight and were forced to reschedule for the next morning. \n411.  The next morning, Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s boarding pass, again, contained the \n“SSSS” designation, indicating  that she had been designated as a “known  or suspected \nterrorist.”  \n412.  After going through the CBP security checkpoint, and before boarding the \nplane, Ms. Hawa Wehelie and Ms. F. Wehelie scanned their passports at the Automated \nPassport Control the kiosk.  Once again, there declaration forms contained an “X” over their \nphotos. Once again, they were instructed to see a Customs officer for assistance.  \n413.  While waiting in line at customs and before reaching the counter, and in public \nview, a CBP officer approached Ms. Hawa Wehelie and Ms. F. Wehelie and escorted them into \na back room for interrogation.  \n414.  CBP officers interrogated Ms. Hawa Wehelie and Ms. F. Wehelie about where \nthey stayed the night before and who had picked them up from the airport. \n415.  Ms. Hawa Wehelie and Ms. F. Wehelie were forced to write their responses to \neach question on a piece of paper.  \n416.  On October 22, 2017, Mr. Wehelie, Mrs. Noor, and Ms. Hawa Wehelie were re-\nentering the United States through the Peace Bridge land port of entry in New York. \n86 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 87 of 150\n417.  CBP officers ordered Mr. Wehelie, Mrs. Noor, and Ms. Hawa Wehelie to pull \naside and enter the building for secondary inspection. \n418.  Mr. Wehelie was interrogated about his travels including where he was going, \nwhere he stayed in Canada, where he worked, where he had traveled, and why he previously \ntraveled to Somalia.  \n419.  Thereafter, Mr. Wehelie, Mrs. Noor, and Ms. Hawa Wehelie were detained in a \nprivate room.  Mr. Wehelie was interrogated by two CBP officers and an FBI agent.  \n420.  After Mr. Wehelie was interrogated, they were escorted back to the waiting \nroom where they waited for approximately two hours. \n421.   CBP officers then  searched their  personal belongings and person, which \ninvolved removing all items from their pockets, and removing their shoes \n422.  CBP Supervisor Marshman confiscated Mr. Wehelie’s, Mrs. Noor’s, and Ms. \nHawa Wehelie’s cell phones without their consent.  Also, Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s laptop was \nconfiscated without her consent. \n423.  CBP retained Mr. Wehelie’s, Mrs. Noor’s, and Ms. Hawa Wehelie’s electronics \nfor approximately two months.  \n424.  Upon information and belief, CBP downloaded Mr. Wehelie’s, Mrs. Noor’s, and \nMs. Hawa Wehelie’s data and content from their electronic devices without their consent.  \n425.  On July 31, 2018, Ms. Hawa Wehelie, Mr. Wehelie, and Mrs. Noor were re-\nentering the United through the Peace Bridge land port of entry.  \n426.  Immediately  after they presented their passports to the CBP officer, their \nvehicle was surrounded by six or seven armed CBP officers.  Mr. Wehelie, Mrs. Noor, and Ms. \nHawa Wehelie were ordered to exit the vehicle and detained.   \n87 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 88 of 150\n427.  CBP Officer Tucker interrogated Mr. Wehelie about the locations of his father \nand mother, where he traveled, where he stayed, where he worked, where he lived, and \nasked him to provide his phone number, e-mail address, and the addresses where he stayed \nin Canada.  \n428.  The  Wehelie  Family  is  also  regularly  subjected  to  extensive  searches, \nunreasonable delays and interrogations when returning from Canada to the United States \nthrough land ports of entry.  \n429.  Upon information  and belief,  the  Wehelie Family  is  subjected to  lengthy \ndetentions, searches, and interrogations by CBP officers at US-Canada land ports of entry due \nto their relation to Ms. Hawa Wehelie and because of her status on Defendants’ federal terror \nwatchlist.    \n430.  As  a  result of  the  above described  experiences, the  Wehelie Family  has \nsuffered severe anxiety, humiliation, and have been discouraged from traveling with Ms. \nHawa Wehelie.   \n431.  The Wehelie Family has also been subjected to FBI interrogations because of \ntheir relation to Ms. Hawa Wehelie and because of her status on Defendants’ federal terror \nwatchlist.   \n432.  Mr. Wehelie and Mrs. Noor have filed DHS Trip inquiries. They have since \nreceived letters as described in paragraph 178 above and were assigned redress control \nnumbers.   \n \n \n \n88 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 89 of 150\nPlaintiff Moustafa El-Shahat \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n433.  Sometime  in  2013  or  2014,  Mr.  El-Shahat  arrived  at  John  F.  Kennedy \nInternational Airport (“JFK”) in Queens, New York, from an international trip to Egypt.   \n434.  Once his flight landed in JFK, there were two CBP officers waiting  for him \nbefore he arrived at passport control. \n435.  Mr. El-Shahat was escorted to an interrogation room where he was detained \nand interrogated by FBI agents. \n436.  All of his personal belongings were searched, and his laptop, cellphone, and \ndocuments were confiscated by CBP officers. \n437.  Upon  information  and  belief,  his  documents  were  photocopied  and  the \ninformation on his electronic devices were downloaded without his consent. \n438.  Mr. El-Shahat was interrogated by the FBI agents for approximately three and \na half hours.   \n439.  He was interrogated about what he thinks of jihad6, what mosque he attends, \nhow religious he is, whether he teaches at a mosque, whether he is an imam (an Islamic \nreligious leader), among other invasive questions about his Islamic religious beliefs and \npractices. \n440.  Upon information and belief, his answers to the questions asked by the FBI \nagents were factors that contributed to his designation on the federal terror watch list.  \n441.  When he was finally released, a CBP officer escorted Mr. El-Shahat out of the \nairport to ensure he left the premises.   \n                                                 \n6 Jihad is an Arabic Islamic term that means “spiritual struggle.”   \n89 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 90 of 150\n442.  Ever since that  trip and subsequent FBI interrogation, every time Mr. El-\nShahat travels by air, his boarding pass is routinely stamped with the “SSSS” designation, \nindicating that he has been designated by Defendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n443.  He is routinely unable to check in online or print his boarding pass. \n444.  Rather Mr. El-Shahat is directed each time to an airline representative, who \nthen contacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that \ncan take a very long time. \n445.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it. \n446.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Mr. El-Shahat to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of all of his personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings – twice – at the TSA \nsecurity  checkpoint  and  again  at  the  gate,  in  public  view  and  in  front  of  his  travel \ncompanions. \n447.  He is also often interrogated at the gate in public view. \n448.  On one occasion, the TSA agent interrogating Mr. El-Shahat informed him that \nhe is subjected to enhanced screening because he frequently travels to countries in the \nMiddle East, because he travels alone, and because he is a Muslim male.   \n449.  On another occasion, an officer confirmed that he is designated on the federal \nterror watchlist. \n90 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 91 of 150\n450.  On another occasion, while at an airport in Abu Dhabi, a TSA agent made Mr. \nEl-Shahat stand with his hands against the wall, and then kicked Mr. Al-Shahat to force his \nlegs apart, causing him pain. \n451.  The TSA agent treated Mr. El-Shahat like a criminal, likely because of his status \non the federal terror watchlist. \n452.  Due to the above-described treatment, Mr. El-Shahat has missed at least three \nflights.   \n453.  Mr. El-Shahat avoids flying whenever possible and drives instead to avoid the \nabove-described treatment. \n454.  On or about five years ago, Mr. El-Shahat was stopped at a US-Canada port of \nentry on his way into Canada and escorted to secondary screening by two Canadian Border \nServices Officers. \n455.  He was detained and interrogated for a lengthy period of time while his car \nand personal belongings were searched. \n456.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Mr.  El-Shahat  was  subjected  to  a  lengthy \ndetention, search, and interrogation by the Canadian Border Services Officers due to his \nstatus on the federal terror watch list being shared with Canadian authorities by Defendants. \n457.  Mr. El-Shahat has filed multiple DHS TRIP inquiries.  He has since received \nmultiple letters as described in paragraph 178 above and was assigned multiple Redress \nControl Numbers in connection with those letters. \n458.  Further, as a result of his status on the federal terror watch list, his wife’s \nimmigration application was significantly delayed for over three years, and as a result has \nsuffered a painful prolonged separation from his wife and loss of consortium.  Mr. El-Shahat \n91 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 92 of 150\nalso suffered from shame and humiliation that his wife knew the reason that the processing \nof her immigration application was delayed significantly was because Defendants believe Mr. \nEl-Shahat is a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n459.  Upon information and belief, Mr. El-Shahat remains on the federal terror \nwatch list.  \nPlaintiff Farid Sulayman \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n460.  Imam Farid Sulayman is a local Imam7 in the Seattle, Washington area.  As a \nwell-known religious leader in his area and as part of his sincerely-held religious beliefs, \nImam Sulayman routinely leads large groups of American Muslim worshippers on an annual \nUmrah8 pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia.  \n461.  On February 24, 2018, Imam Sulayman was returning to the United States at \nthe U.S.-Canada land bordering crossing near Blaine, Washington, with his wife and four \nchildren.   \n462.  Upon presenting the primary CBP officer with his and his family’s passports, \nthe CBP officer escorted them to secondary inspection.  At this time, the CBP officer seized \nImam Sulayman’s cell phone.  Upon information and belief, Defendants made copies of the \ninformation on his cell phone without his consent.  \n463.  Imam Sulayman and his family waited in a waiting room for approximately \nthree hours before another CBP officer came to interrogate Imam Sulayman.  While waiting, \n                                                 \n7 Muslim religious leader.   \n8 Umrah is a pilgrimage made by Muslims to Mecca.  Unlike Hajj which is an Islamic pilgrimage that may only \nbe performed  at specific dates according to the Islamic lunar calendar, Umrah may be performed  at any time \nduring the year.   \n92 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 93 of 150\nImam Sulayman’s children began to cry, were scared, and kept asking why they could not go \nhome.   \n464.  Thereafter, Imam Sulayman was questioned by a CBP officer about his studies, \nwork, and an upcoming trip for Umrah that Imam Sulayman had planned for approximately \nforty Muslim community members.  Imam Sulayman does not know how the CBP officer was \naware of his upcoming Umrah trip.   \n465.  After the interrogation, Imam Sulayman and his family waited another forty-\nfive minutes before being allowed to leave.  At no point was Imam Sulayman provided any \ninformation as to why he was questioned or taken to secondary inspection.   \n466.  Imam Sulayman felt ashamed and humiliated that his family witnessed him \nbeing treated by the government as a criminal and a “known or suspected terrorist.”  \n467.  Moreover, Imam Sulayman felt ashamed and humiliated  that his wife and \nchildren were also treated as criminals and “known or suspected terrorists” just because \nthey were traveling with him.   \n468.  Imam Sulayman, his wife, and four children made another trip to Canada the \nfollowing  month.    Upon  presenting the  primary  CBP  officer with  his  passport,  Imam \nSulayman heard an alarm as the CBP officer scanned his passport.  The CBP officer then \nordered Imam Sulayman and his family to secondary inspection.   \n469.  Once  again,  Imam  Sulayman’s  cell  phone  was  confiscated,  and  upon \ninformation and belief, Defendants made copies on his cell phone without his consent.   \n470.  On or about March 31, 2018, Imam Sulayman arrived at the Seattle-Tacoma \nInternational Airport to board his flight with 28 Muslim community members to Umrah in \n93 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 94 of 150\nSaudi Arabia.  Among the 28 community members were Imam Sulayman’s elderly mother, \nsister, brother-in-law, and two aunts.   \n471.  Imam Sulayman’s travel companions and family members were able to print \ntheir boarding passes from the airport kiosk or obtained their boarding passes without \ndelay.   \n472.  However, Imam Sulayman was unable to check-in  online or at the  kiosk.  \nInstead, he was directed to an airline representative for further assistance.   \n473.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, \nImam Sulayman was delayed until the airline representative obtained clearance for Imam \nSulayman to board his flight.  Due to the significant delay in obtaining his boarding pass, \nImam Sulayman’s travel companions and family members proceeded to the TSA checkpoint \nand cleared screening without any issues.   \n474.  His boarding pass was stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he \nwas designated as a “known or suspected terrorist.”   \n475.  Even though his family members had already cleared TSA security and were \nwaiting for him at the gate, Imam Sulayman was informed that his family members were \nbeing forced to return to the TSA security checkpoint because they were traveling with him.   \n476.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents subjected Imam Sulayman to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of all of his personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings at the TSA security \ncheckpoint in public view and in front of his family members. \n94 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 95 of 150\n477.  Imam Sulayman was detained for an hour and interrogated about his studies \nand travel itinerary in front of his family members.   \n478.  Imam  Sulayman’s  family  members  including  his  seventy-eight-year  old \nmother who is handicapped and had to be escorted around the airport in a wheel chair had \ntheir boarding passes stamped with the “SSSS” designation indicating they were designated \nas “known or suspected terrorists.”  \n479.  Imam  Sulayman’s  family  members,  including  his  seventy-eight-year-old \nmother, were subjected to the same invasive and humiliating screening as Imam Sulayman \nin public view.   Imam Sulayman felt ashamed and humiliated especially because his elderly \nmother in a wheelchair was treated like a criminal in public all because of his status on \nDefendants’ federal terror watchlist.  Imam Sulayman’s profusely apologized to his mother \nfor the humiliation and mistreatment she experienced.   \n480.  Imam Sulayman and his travel companions only made their flight because a \nfriendly airport employee held the boarding door until the 28 community members and \nImam Sulayman arrived.   \n481.  On  April  16,  2018,  Imam  Sulayman  and  his  28  travel companions  were \nscheduled to return to the United  States by air from Saudi Arabia to Dubai to Seattle, \nWashington.   \n482.  At the airport in Saudi Arabia, the boarding passes of his family members, \nincluding  Imam  Sulayman’s elderly mother, were stamped with  the “SSSS” designation \nindicating that they were designated as “known or suspected terrorists.”  \n483.  When Imam Sulayman approached the ticket agent for his boarding pass, the \nairline representative was not able to print his boarding pass.  An airline supervisor was \n95 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 96 of 150\ncalled and Imam Sulayman was informed that the airline had to “call America” to figure out \nwhat was happening.   \n484.  After  a  forty-five-minute  delay,  the  airline  representatives  only  received \nclearance to print Imam Sulayman’s boarding pass from Saudi Arabia to Dubai.  Imam \nSulayman’s boarding pass was stamped with the “SSSS” designation indicating that he is a \n“known or suspected terrorist.”  \n485.  Once in Dubai, Imam Sulayman was delayed another forty-five-minutes for the \nairline  representative to  print  his  boarding pass  which  was  stamped  with  the  “SSSS” \ndesignation indicating that he is a “known or suspected terrorist.”  \n486.  When Imam  Sulayman  landed  in  Seattle,  Washington,  CBP  officers were \nplaneside asking passengers if they were Imam Sulayman.  Once Imam Sulayman identified \nhimself to the CBP officers, he was escorted along with his elderly mother in public view and \nin front of his travel companions to an interrogation room.   \n487.  To spare his elderly mother from further humiliation, heartache, and hassle, \nImam Sulayman begged CBP officers to let his elderly mother out of secondary inspection.  \nImam Sulayman pleaded with CBP officers and informed them “I know you want me not my \nmother.”   \n488.  The CBP officers interrogated Imam Sulayman about his studies, work, and \ntravel.  The CBP officers also asked Imam Sulayman if he knew certain individuals whose \nphotographs he was shown.   \n489.  Imam Sulayman was detained and interrogated for four-and-a-half hours.   \n490.  Imam Sulayman felt powerless to assist his elderly mother during this Umrah \ntrip.  He felt ashamed and began to question whether he should ever travel with his elderly \n96 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 97 of 150\nmother so that she would no longer be subjected to the above described travel experience \nbecause of her relation to him and his status on Defendants’ federal terror watchlist.   \n491.  On May 19, 2018, Imam Sulayman drove family members to the Islamic Center \nof Olympia so they could break their Ramadan9 fast.  Imam Sulayman could not break fast \nwith his family because he had a fundraiser in Seattle to attend.   \n492.  Since Imam Sulayman works as an Uber driver in his spare time, he decided to \npick up an Uber fare as he drove back to Seattle.  He accepted to pick up an Uber fare from \nFort Lewis military base near Tacoma, Washington.  \n493.  When  Imam  Sulayman  arrived  at  the  military  base,  the  officer  at  the \ncheckpoint informed him  that he needed to register his information.   Imam Sulayman \nproceeded to the registration area and provided his license, registration and insurance \ninformation.  He asked how long this would take and was informed that it was only a five to \nten-minute process.  He decided to wait for his fare instead of cancelling.   \n494.  After twenty  minutes,  an officer detained and placed handcuffs on Imam \nSulayman.  Imam Sulayman has no criminal record.  He was extremely frightened and did \nnot understand why he was been apprehended.   \n495.  Imam Sulayman asked the officer why he was handcuffed and detained.  The \nofficer stated that Imam Sulayman’s name popped up when his driving information was \nbeing inputted.  \n496.  Imam  Sulayman asked the officer to read what  was said when his name \nappeared.  Imam Sulayman was given three reasons.  \n                                                 \n9 Islamic holy month when Muslims fast, without food or water, from sunrise to sunset.   \n97 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 98 of 150\n497.  At first, the officer stated that there was an issue related to ICE.  After Imam \nSulayman informed the officer that he was a U.S. citizen.  The officer did not respond.  \n498.  The second explanation provided by the officer was that Imam Sulayman was \na “threat.” Imam Sulayman asked why he was being labeled a “threat.” The officer did not \nprovide an explanation.  \n499.  The third explanation provided by the officer was that there was a warrant out \nfor Imam Sulayman’s arrest.  After he asked for more information about the outside arrest \nwarrant, the officer made at least two calls to obtain more information.   \n500.  After an hour of custodial detention, Imam Sulayman was released.  During his \ndetention, Imam Sulayman asked if the handcuffs could be removed and if he could stand up.  \nHe was told that neither are allowed because of standard procedure.   \n501.  Imam Sulayman was unable to pick up his Uber fare.  His income ability was \nhindered because of his status on Defendants’ federal terror watchlist.   \n502.  Upon information and belief, Imam Sulayman was custodially detained and \nhandcuffed at Fort Lewis military base because of his status on Defendants’ federal terror \nwatchlist.   \n503.  Muslim community members have informed Imam Sulayman that FBI agents \nhave questioned them about him.  Upon information and belief, these community members \nhave been interviewed by the FBI because of their association with Imam Sulayman and \nbecause of his status on Defendants’ federal terror watch list.  \n504.  Since  Imam  Sulayman  is  a  religious leader in  his  community,  he travels \nfrequently with  large groups for Umrah.  Due to the difficulty, hassle, and humiliation \nassociated with his travel experiences because of his status on Defendants’ federal terror \n98 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 99 of 150\nwatchlist, Imam Sulayman is afraid to travel again.  Additionally, Imam Sulayman standing \nin his community has been greatly diminished since his travel companions, as described \nabove, discovered he was on Defendants’ federal terror watchlist.  Imam Sulayman is also \ndiscouraged from organizing and leading Muslim community  members for Umrah trips \nbecause of the above described treatment, and accompanying shame, fear, and humiliation, \nthat he experiences because of his status on Defendants’ federal terror watchlist.  \n505.  Upon information and belief, Imam Sulayman remains on Defendants’ federal \nterror watchlist.   \nPlaintiff Fadi Suliman \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n506.  On January 11, 2018, Mr. Suliman arrived at a Miami area airport for a flight to \nLas Vegas, Nevada.   \n507.  Mr. Suliman was traveling to a business convention with his employees (one \nMuslim and one non-Muslim), a customer, and a vendor, each of whom witnessed the entire \ntreatment that Mr. Suliman was subjected to that day, described below.   \n508.  At first, Mr. Suliman was prevented from checking in online and at the airport \nkiosk.  Rather, he was directed to an airline representative for further assistance.   \n509.  After presenting himself to the airline representative at the ticket counter, Mr. \nSuliman and his travel companions had to wait  almost forty minutes  before the airline \nrepresentative was able to obtain clearance from Defendants so that Mr. Suliman could \nboard his flight.   \n510.  While the airline representative was on the phone, Mr. Suliman overheard the \nrepresentative state “no, he doesn’t have any weapons on him.”  The airline representative \nthen asked Mr. Suliman if any of the individuals traveling with him have any weapons.   \n99 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 100 of 150\n511.  All the boarding passes given to Mr. Suliman and his travel companions were \nstamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that they were all designated as “known or \nsuspected terrorists,” with the exception of one.  The only travel companion that did not have \nan “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass was the sole non-Muslim employee traveling with \nMr. Suliman despite the fact that all the tickets were purchased by Mr. Suliman’s company \nunder the same reservation.   \n512.  Once Mr. Suliman  and his travel companions arrived at the  TSA security \ncheckpoint, they provided their boarding passes and identification documents to the TSA \nagent stationed at the entrance of the TSA security checkpoint.   \n513.  The boarding pass scanner indicated a red light when Mr. Suliman’s boarding \npass was scanned.  The TSA agent called over a supervisor and stated, “We have a house \nguest.”  \n514.  Mr. Suliman  and his travel companions that were designated “SSSS” were \nescorted to  a different line  than the other travelers passing through the TSA  security \ncheckpoint  and subjected to  enhanced screening.   The  non-Muslim  employee was not \nsubjected to enhanced screening and went through normal screening.  \n515.  Mr. Suliman was subjected to an extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \npat down including a search of his groin area, in addition to a TSA male agent placing his \nfingers inside and around Mr. Suliman’s  waist,  an extensive search of all  his  personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings in public view and \nin front of his travel companions.  Mr. Suliman’s Muslim travel companions received the \nsame treatment.   \n100 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 101 of 150\n516.  Meanwhile, a TSA agent was on the phone seeking clearance to allow Mr. \nSuliman to pass the security checkpoint.   \n517.  Once Mr. Suliman and his Muslim travel companions finally arrived at the gate, \napproximately five TSA agents were waiting for Mr. Suliman to arrive. \n518.  The TSA agents had with them a cart with chemical testing machines.   \n519.  At the gate and before being allowed to board, in public view and in front of \nhis travel companions, Mr. Suliman was once again subjected to an invasive and lengthy pat \ndown; all of his personal belongings were searched again; and, he and his belongings were \nsubjected to another round of chemical residue testing despite the fact that he had just \ncleared security with no issues at the TSA security checkpoint. \n520.  Due to the additional enhanced screening at the gate, Mr. Suliman missed his \ndirect flight to Las Vegas.  As a result, Mr. Suliman was forced to rebook with a connecting \nflight to Dallas Fort Worth airport in Dallas, Texas and travel separately than his travel \ncompanions.   \n521.  When Mr. Suliman arrived at Dallas to board his flight to Las Vegas, the airline \nrepresentative scanned his boarding pass at the gate to board their flight and the scanner \nonce again indicated a red light. \n522.  Mr. Suliman was once again delayed until the airline representative at the gate \nfinally obtained clearance from Defendants to allow him to board his flight.   \n523.  Additionally, Mr. Suliman had to wait at the gate until TSA agents arrived and \nsubjected Mr. Suliman to another invasive and lengthy pat down, a search of all his personal \nbelongings, and another round of chemical residue testing for himself and his belongings \n101 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 102 of 150\nalthough he had not left the secure, sterile area of the airport and was only on a connecting \nflight.  This was once again conducted in public view.   \n524.  Mr. Suliman felt ashamed and humiliated, especially because he was treated \nas a “known or suspected terrorist” in public view and in front of his employees, customer, \nand vendor, and because his Muslim travel companions were also delayed, humiliated and \nsubjected to extensive screening just because they were traveling with Mr. Suliman. \n525.  Because of all the delays, it took Mr. Suliman 15 hours to arrive in Las Vegas \nfor the convention.  Mr. Suliman’s original flight schedule was scheduled for 5 hours.   \n526.  Because of all  the delays  resulting  from his status  on the  federal terror \nwatchlist, Mr. Suliman missed two business meetings and was forced to reschedule a meeting \nwith a Hong Kong vendor.   \n527.  Mr.  Suliman’s  employees,  customer,  and  vendor  were  shocked  at  the \ntreatment they witnessed and endured while traveling with Mr. Suliman.   \n528.  On the return flight from Las Vegas to Miami, Mr. Suliman experienced the \nsame treatment as described above.  Mr. Suliman’s Muslim travel companions were once \nagain subjected to the same treatment.  The non-Muslim employee once again did not have \nan “SSSS” stamp on his boarding pass and did not experience any enhanced screening or \ndelays.   \n529.  After  their  travel  experience,  Mr.  Suliman’s  Muslim  travel  companions \ninformed him that they would not travel with him again because of the treatment they \nsuffered when traveling with him.   \n530.  Ever since that trip, every time Mr. Suliman travels by air, he is subjected to \nsubstantially similar treatment.  \n102 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 103 of 150\n531.  His boarding passes for his flights are routinely stamped with  the “SSSS” \ndesignation, indicating that he has been designated by Defendants as a “known or suspected \nterrorist.” \n532.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass. \n533.  Rather Mr. Suliman is directed each time to an airline representative, who then \ncontacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that can \ntake a very long time. \n534.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it. \n535.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Mr. Suliman  to substantially  similar  routine, extensive and lengthy \nscreening, an invasive pat down including a search of his groin area, an extensive search of \nall of his personal belongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings \n– twice – at the TSA security checkpoint and again at the gate, in public view and in front of \nhis travel companions. \n536.  He then has to wait again at the gate for an airline representative to obtain \nclearance from Defendants a second time to board his flight, even though Defendants already \nprovided clearance for him to board his flight prior to his boarding pass being printed in the \nfirst place. \n537.  Moreover, oftentimes the people that Mr. Suliman travels with are also treated \nas “known or suspected terrorists” just because they are traveling with him. \n103 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 104 of 150\n538.  On May 2018, Mr. Suliman was forced to fly to China to meet with the Hong \nKong business vendor that he was originally scheduled to meet in Las Vegas on the trip \ndescribed above.  At New York’s JFK airport to connect for his flight to China, Mr. Suliman \nwas referred to by TSA as a “house guest” again at the TSA security checkpoint.   \n539.  A TSA agent instructed Mr. Suliman to have a seat and delayed him for 40 \nminutes until an airline representative came looking for Mr. Suliman and asked if TSA was \ngoing to clear him.  At this point, TSA cleared Mr. Suliman but another female TSA agent re-\ndetained Mr. Suliman and TSA agents called yet again for clearance.   \n540.  After being cleared again, Mr. Suliman rushed to the gate only to be delayed by \nTSA for another round of clearance checks.  The TSA agent at the gate took a picture of his \nboarding pass.   \n541.  Fortunately, the captain of his flight refused to take off until  Mr. Suliman \nboarded, otherwise he would have missed his flight. \n542.  Mr. Suliman’s belongings did not make it to China.   \n543.  Because of his screening experiences, Mr. Suliman avoided taking carry-ons \nand therefore had no clothes to change into for two days.  Mr. Suliman did not take a carry-\non, so he could minimize the screening delays and humiliation.   \n544.  On May 11, 2018, Mr. Suliman was traveling from China to Miami with a \nconnecting flight in Los Angeles International Airport.  When Mr. Suliman arrived at the \nairport in China, the airline representative received a message that stated, “Passenger not \nallowed to board before clearance.”   \n545.  Supervisors for the airline were called over and Mr. Suliman was escorted to \nan office where the airline employees called Defendants to get clearance.   \n104 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 105 of 150\n546.  The airline employees took approximately 2 hours before Defendants gave \nthem a code to input into the system, which allowed them to assign Mr. Suliman a seat.  Mr. \nSuliman arrived four hours before takeoff and still almost missed his flight.   \n547.  When Mr. Suliman landed in Los Angeles, there were five armed CBP officers \nwaiting for him planeside.  They escorted Mr. Suliman in public view to get his luggage.   \n548.  Mr. Suliman was escorted to secondary inspection where he was detained and \ninterrogated about his travel, businesses, and business partners.  During the interrogation, \nMr. Suliman  commented to an African-American  CBP officer “Imagine  if I  was a black \nMuslim.” The CBP officer responded, “Lately, most of the people that come to this room are \nfrom your background.”  \n549.  The CBP officers forced Mr. Suliman to show them photographs of his trip to \nChina, his family, and employees.   \n550.  CBP officers also seized Mr. Suliman’s smartphone.  A CBP supervisor gave Mr. \nSuliman a document informing him that his phone was being seized.  As of this date, Mr. \nSuliman has not received his phone back. \n551.  Mr. Suliman was detained for approximately 2 hours.  As a result, Mr. Suliman \nmissed his flight to Miami and was forced to spend the night at the airport.   \n552.  Mr. Suliman  applied to the  TSA Pre✓ ® program, but his  application was \ndenied without providing any explanation. \n553.  Upon information and belief, his application to participate in the TSA Pre✓ ® \nprogram was denied because of, upon information and belief, his status on the federal terror \nwatch list. \n105 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 106 of 150\n554.  Mr. Suliman has filed a DHS TRIP inquiry.  He has since received a letter as \ndescribed in paragraph 178 above and was assigned a Redress Control Number.  \n555.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Suliman remains on the federal terror watch \nlist. \nPlaintiff John Doe \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n556.  Since approximately 2013, every time John Doe travels by air, his boarding \npass is routinely stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he has been designated \nby Defendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.”  \n557.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass. \n558.  Rather John Doe is directed each time to an airline representative, who then \ncontacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that can \ntake a very long time. \n559.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it. \n560.  When John Doe scans his boarding pass at the entrance to the TSA security \ncheckpoint, the scanner indicates a red light. \n561.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject John Doe to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive pat \ndown including, an extensive search of all of his personal belongings and chemical residue \n106 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 107 of 150\ntesting of his person and his belongings – twice – at the TSA security checkpoint and again \nat the gate, in public view and in front of his travel companions. \n562.  Oftentimes,  John  Doe’s name  is  called  on  the  loudspeaker  before he  is \nsubjected to interrogation at the gate in public view.  \n563.  On one occasion, DHS officers interrogated John Doe about whether he was \ngoing to Syria and whether he was going to fight in the country.  \n564.  Whenever John Doe arrives in the United States from international trips, two \nCBP officers check everyone’s passports as they deplane until they find him. \n565.  The two CBP officers then escort him from the gate to an interrogation room \nwhere he is detained and interrogated by FBI agents.  All of his personal belongings are also \nsearched. \n566.  Additionally,  whenever  John Doe  has  electronics  in  his  possession, CBP \nofficers  confiscate  his  electronics  and  upon  information  and  belief,  download  the \ninformation from them, including his laptop and his cell phone, without his consent. \n567.  On one occasion, CBP officers seized John Doe’s phone and searched through \nhis photos despite his objections.  \n568.  Upon arriving in the United States from an international flight in Saudi Arabia, \nCBP officers interrogated John Doe about who he married, whether his wife was Syrian, \nwhether he and his wife visited Syria, whether John Doe supported the Assad regime in Syria, \nand what his thoughts were about Syrian President Assad and ISIS.   \n569.  Upon returning to the United States on a flight from Turkey, CBP officers \ninterrogated John Doe about where he traveled to, where he obtained the money to travel, \nand about his job managing an Islamic center.  \n107 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 108 of 150\n570.  Further, CBP officers interrogated John Doe about a prayer book they found \namong his personal belongings, the content of the book and the specific details of his Islamic \nfaith.  \n571.  On another occasion, upon returning to the United States from a trip to Turkey, \na DHS agent called John Doe after he exited the airport and told him that he had been \nscheduled for additional screening and interrogation and that he needed to return to the \nairport.  \n572.  The DHS agent further told John Doe that he would be detained at his next \nflight if he did not return to the airport.  \n573.  After 15 minutes, a DHS supervisor called John Doe and interrogated him \nabout his trip, the purpose of his trip, and who he stayed with during his trip.  \n574.  As  a  result  of his  watchlist  designation,  John  Doe is  often  subjected  to \ninterrogations at international airports. \n575.  On one occasion, John Doe was interrogated by a CBP officer at an airport in \nthe United Arab Emirates.  \n576.  John Doe was interrogated about how he paid for his trip, the current locations \nof his family members, his place of birth, and his place of citizenship.  \n577.  As a result of the interrogation, John Doe missed his flight.  \n578.  After returning to the airport the next day because he missed his flight, once \nagain, the same CBP officer interrogated John Doe.  \n579.  John Doe has filed multiple DHS TRIP inquiries.  He has since received multiple \nletters as described in paragraph 178 above and was assigned multiple Redress Control \nNumbers in connection with those letters. \n108 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 109 of 150\n580.  Further, shortly after John Doe was designated on the federal watch list, he \nwas subjected to FBI interrogations at his home. \n581.  On one occasion, FBI agents interrogated John Doe about where his family is \nfrom, where they currently reside, whether he knows individuals who fight in Syria, what he \nknows about groups including ISIS and an anti-ISIS journalist group, and whether he sent \nmoney to Syria. \n582.  On another occasion, FBI agent James Fobert told John Doe, “You’re an asset. \nWe want to get information from you that can prevent people from joining ISIS.” \n583.  FBI agents offered to pay John Doe in exchange for information.   \n584.  Upon information and belief, John Doe remains on Defendants’ federal terror \nwatchlist.   \nPlaintiffs Child Doe and Child Doe 2 \n(Family Members of a Watchlisted Individual) \n585.  As  a  result  of  Father  Doe’s watchlist  designation  and  treatment  while \ntraveling, when Child Doe (age 7) and Child Doe 2 (age 8) travel with him, they are regularly \nsubjected  to  enhanced screening,  which  includes  TSA  agents  pulling  them  aside  and \nsearching their personal belongings. \n586.  As  a  result  of  Father  Doe’s watchlist  designation  and  treatment  while \ntraveling, Child Doe and Child Doe 2, and their family travel separately from Father Doe to \navoid similar treatment.  \n587.  In early 2016, Child Doe and Child Doe 2 traveled separately from their father \nto avoid the travel delays and humiliation resulting from their father’s watchlist designation.  \n109 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 110 of 150\n588.  After they went through security, a TSA agent discovered their relationship to \nFather Doe and asked him, “Are they with you?” When Father Doe confirmed the relation, \nChild Doe and Child Doe 2 were forced to go through the security checkpoint again.  \n589.  When TSA agents attempted  to force Child  Doe to go through the  metal \ndetector, Child Doe was four-years-old at the time, he began to sob uncontrollably and clung \nto his father’s leg.  His personal belongings were searched. \n590.  TSA agents also forced Child Doe 2 to go through the metal detector and they \nsearched her personal belongings.  They also subjected her to chemical residue testing.  Child \nDoe 2, who was only six-years-old at the time, also began to sob.  \nPlaintiff Mohamad Albadawi \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n591.  Since  approximately  2013,  every  time  Mr.  Albadawi  travels  by  air,  his \nboarding pass is routinely stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he has been \ndesignated by Defendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.”  \n592.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass. \n593.  Rather Mr. Albadawi is directed each time to an airline representative, who \nthen contacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that \ncan take a very long time. \n594.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it. \n110 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 111 of 150\n595.  When Mr. Albadawi scans his boarding pass at the entrance to the TSA security \ncheckpoint, the scanner indicates a red light. \n596.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Mr. Albadawi to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive pat \ndown including  a search of his  groin area, an  extensive  search of all  of his  personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings – twice – at the TSA \nsecurity  checkpoint  and  again  at  the  gate,  in  public  view  and  in  front  of  his  travel \ncompanions. \n597.  At the gate, the second search described in paragraph 210 above is conducted \nby a minimum of eight to twelve TSA agents, including a TSA supervisor after he scans his \nboarding pass to board his flight. \n598.  As a result of the treatment described above, Mr. Albadawi stopped traveling \nwith carry-on luggage. \n599.  Oftentimes,  Mr. Albadawi’s name is called on the loudspeaker before he is \nsubjected to the second search at the gate. \n600.  Moreover, oftentimes the  people that  Mr.  Albadawi travels  with  are also \ntreated as “known or suspected terrorists” just because they are traveling with him. \n601.  In 2013, upon arriving at an international airport in the United Arab Emirates, \nthe airline representative at the ticketing counter was unable to print his ticket and told Mr. \nAlbadawi that they needed to contact the United States government to obtain clearance for \nhim to board his flight back to his home in the United States. \n111 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 112 of 150\n602.  The airline representative contacted Defendants, and after a delay, obtained \nclearance for Mr. Albadawi to board his flights to the United States and printed his boarding \npass. \n603.  Mr. Albadawi was then interrogated, upon information and belief, by CBP \nofficers in public view before he was allowed to board his flight. \n604.  Mr. Albadawi was subjected to similar treatment in connection with other \ninternational flights returning to the United States, including from the United Arab Emirates \nand Germany. \n605.  As a result of the above-described treatment, Mr. Albadawi has missed several \ndomestic and international flights. \n606.  For example, on July 31, 2018, Mr. Albadawi was returning to the United States \nfrom a trip to Turkey.  When Mr. Albadawi arrived at the ticket counter to check in for his \nconnecting flight to Amsterdam, Netherlands, the airline representative was unable to print \nhis boarding pass.  The airline representative contacted Defendants for clearance to allow \nMr. Albadawi to board his flight.  Mr. Albadawi waited for more than an hour and missed his \nflight because the airline representative could not get clearance from Defendants to board in \ntime.   \n607.  Eventually, Mr. Albadawi was rebooked on another flight and was allowed to \nboard a flight to Amsterdam. \n608.  However, when Mr. Albadawi  arrived at Amsterdam  Airport Schiphol,  he \npresented himself at the ticket counter for his boarding pass.  The airline representative \ncalled Defendants to obtain clearance but once again due to the delay, Mr. Albadawi missed \nhis flight to the United States.  \n112 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 113 of 150\n609.  After  Mr.  Albadawi  rebooked his  flight  to  the  United  States,  the  airline \nrepresentative once again contacted Defendants, and after another lengthy delay, obtained \nclearance for Mr. Albadawi to board his flight to the United States. The boarding pass was \nstamped with the “SSSS” designation indicating that Defendants have labeled him a “known \nor suspected terrorist.” \n610.  When  Mr.  Albadawi  arrived  at  Hartsfield-Jackson  Atlanta  International \nAirport, he went to an Automated Passport Control kiosk at customs. His declaration form \nhad an “X” printed on it with instructions to go to a customs agent.  Mr. Albadawi notice a \nCBP officer looking at him.  Mr. Albadawi approached the CBP officer and asked if he was \nwaiting from him.  The CBP officer laughed and responded, “how did you know?”  \n611.  Mr. Albadawi waited two hours for CBP to provide an approval code for him.  \nBecause of the delay, Mr. Albadawi missed his flight to Chicago.   \n612.  After  rebooking,  Mr.  Albadawi  went  to  a  TSA  security  checkpoint  and \nexperienced substantially similar enhanced screening experience as described above.   \n613.  When Mr. Albadawi finally arrived at the gate to board his rebooked flight, Mr. \nAlbadawi was told he could not board because he did not have approval and as a result, Mr. \nAlbadawi was forced to return to the TSA security checkpoint, go through the same invasive \nscreening and clearance he had just completed, and obtain approval to board his flight again.  \n614.  Once again, Mr. Albadawi missed his flight and he had to rebook his flight.  \n615.  When Mr. Albadawi finally arrived at the gate to board his flight, there were \nseveral TSA agents with chemical testing machines.  Mr. Albadawi was once again subjected \nto enhanced and invasive screening as described above in public view. \n113 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 114 of 150\n616.  Because of his status on Defendants’ federal terror watchlist, Mr. Albadawi \nmissed four flights in the same trip and it took approximately 43 hours to return to the \nUnited States.  \n617.  Whenever Mr. Albadawi arrives in the United States from international trips, \ntwo CBP officers check everyone’s passports as they deplane until they identify him. \n618.  The two CBP officers then escort him from the gate to an interrogation room \nwhere he is detained and interrogated by FBI agents.  All of his personal belongings are also \nsearched. \n619.  Additionally, whenever Mr. Albadawi has electronics in his possession, CBP \nofficers  confiscate  his  electronics  and  upon  information  and  belief,  download  the \ninformation from them, including his laptop and his cell phone, without his consent. \n620.  As a result, Mr. Albadawi has stopped carrying his laptop when he travels. \n621.  Upon returning from an international flight from Turkey, Mr. Albadawi was \ninterrogated by FBI agents about Muslim religious leaders that he invited to participate in a \nconvention that he organized. \n622.  During many of the trips that Mr. Albadawi traveled with his wife, daughter, \nfriends and colleagues, they were subjected to substantially similar treatment as him. \n623.  Approximately one year ago, when Mr. Albadawi and his daughter had a \nconnecting flight in South Carolina and attempted to go to their connecting gate, they were \ntold they were both told to go through the TSA security checkpoint again before being \nallowed to board their flight.  \n114 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 115 of 150\n624.  Additionally,  in  the  event  that  Mr.  Albadawi  purchases flight  tickets  for \ncolleagues, those colleagues are also subjected to substantially similar treatment as him and \ninterrogated about him, which caused him to suffer from shame and embarrassment. \n625.  Approximately two years ago, when Mr. Albadawi’s daughter and her husband \nreturned from a  trip  to Mexico and arrived at  customs,  Mr. Albadawi’s  daughter was \ninterrogated about whether her father was Mohammad Albadawi, how often she visits him, \nhow far his home is from hers, and about the conversations they have with one another.  \n626.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Albadawi’s family and travel companions are \nsubjected to the above described treatment because of their relation to him and because of \nhis status on Defendants’ federal terror watchlist.   \n627.  Mr. Albadawi has filed multiple DHS TRIP inquiries.  He has since received \nmultiple letters as described in paragraph 128 above and was assigned multiple Redress \nControl Numbers in connection with those letters. \n628.  Further, shortly after Mr. Albadawi was designated on the federal watch list, \nhis personal bank account he had open for 18 years was suddenly closed without notice or \nexplanation of the reasons why it was closed. \n629.  Upon information and belief, Defendants disseminated the stigmatizing label \nof “known or suspected terrorist” attached to Mr. Albadawi to his bank, and as a result, his \nbank account was closed without notice. \n630.  Because  of  the  above  described  treatment,  Mr.  Albadawi  is  routinely \nhumiliated in public and in front of his family, discouraged from flying, and stigmatized as a \ncriminal because of his status on Defendants’ federal terror watchlist.   \n115 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 116 of 150\n631.  Upon information and belief,  Mr. Albadawi remains on the  federal terror \nwatch list. \nPlaintiff Khalil Thadi \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n632.  In  March 2017, Mr.  Thadi  arrived at  Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall  to \nprovide a carpet estimate at the request of a contractor.  \n633.  Mr.  Thadi  completed  the  appropriate form  to  go  inside  the  base.  After \nsubmitting  the  form, security officers pulled  Mr. Thadi  aside  for questioning.  Security \ninstructed Mr. Thadi to get out of his car.  \n634.  Mr. Thadi was questioned about the purpose of his visit. He and his car were \nalso photographed.  This process lasted for 45 minutes. Mr. Thadi was ultimately denied \nentry to the base. \n635.   Upon information and belief, Mr. Thadi was denied entry to Joint Base Myer-\nHenderson Hall because of his status on the watchlist.  As a consequence, Mr. Thadi was \nunable  to  provide a  carpet  estimate  to  the  contractor; thus,  he  was  not  awarded a \nsubcontract and lost out on an important business opportunity.   \n636.  Since 2004, every time  Mr. Thadi  travels he is subjected to  substantially \nsimilar treatment.  His boarding passes for his flights are routinely stamped with the “SSSS” \ndesignation, indicating that he has been designated by Defendants as a “known or suspected \nterrorist.”  \n637.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass.  \n116 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 117 of 150\n638.  Instead, Mr. Thadi is directed each time to an airline representative, who then \ncontacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that can \ntake a very long time. Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants \nallowing him to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the \n“SSSS” designation on it. \n639.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Mr. Thadi to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive pat \ndown including  a search of his  groin area, an  extensive  search of all  of his  personal \nbelongings and chemical residue testing of his person and his belongings at the TSA security \ncheckpoint in public view. \n640.  Whenever Mr. Thadi  returns from an international  flight  into  the  United \nStates, he also experiences substantially similar mistreatment each time.   \n641.  Whenever Mr. Thadi arrives in the United States, he is routinely escorted to \nsecondary inspection where he is detained and subjected to lengthy interrogations by CBP \nofficers.  \n642.  The CBP officers search his luggage and seize and search his electronics.  Upon \ninformation and belief, Defendants downloaded and made copies of the information on his \nelectronic devices without his consent.  \n643.  Because of the above-described screening experiences, Mr. Thadi has missed \nmultiple flights.  \n644.  Since 2004, the FBI have repeatedly interrogated Mr. Thadi at his home about \na variety of issues including: the purpose of his trips to Morocco, when and where he and his \n117 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 118 of 150\nfamily went, and whether individuals coerced Mr. Thadi’s family to leave the United States. \nAgents have also interrogated Mr. Thadi about specific individuals.  \n645.  Mr. Thadi has twice been subjected to irregularly long traffic stops. When Mr. \nThadi is pulled over by police, he is told that his name matches with a name within a list \naccessed by officers and is detained for long periods of time.  Upon information and belief, \nMr. Thadi’s long traffic stops occurred because of his status on Defendants’ federal terror \nwatchlist.   \n646.  Mr. Thadi filed a redress request through DHS TRIP.  On March 13, 2018, Mr. \nThadi received a letter, as described in paragraph 178 above and was assigned a Redress \nControl Number.  \n647.  As a result of being placed on the federal terror watchlist, Mr. Thadi has been \ndiscouraged from traveling in order to avoid the lengthy delays, enhanced screening and \ninterrogations by Defendants and the humiliation  and stigma associated with the above \ndescribed screening experiences.  \n648.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Thadi remains on the federal terror watchlist.  \nPlaintiff Esmaeel Paryavi \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n \n649.  Mr. Esameel Paryavi (“Mr. E.  Paryavi”) is  the son of Plaintiff  Mohammad \nParyavi.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have placed Mr. E. Paryavi on the federal \nterror watchlist because of his relation to Plaintiff Mohammad Paryavi.   \n650.  On  April 22, 2018, Mr. E.  Paryavi was departing El  Dorado International \nAirport in Bogota, Columbia, on his way back from an international trip to Columbia with \nfriends.  \n118 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 119 of 150\n651.  He was prevented from checking  in online or at the kiosk  in the airport.  \nRather, he was directed to an airline representative for further assistance.   \n652.  The airline representative called Defendants in order to obtain clearance to \nprint his boarding pass and allow him to board his flight. \n653.  After  having  passed  through  the  security  checkpoint  without  incident, \nColumbian agents pulled Mr. E. Paryavi aside before he was told that he had been randomly \nselected for additional screening.  In public view and in front of his friends, Mr. E. Paryavi \nwas subjected to a pat down and a search of his personal belongings.   \n654.  Mr. E. Paryavi was a Global Entry Holder. Once  he arrived at customs at \nDallas/Fort Worth International Airport, he scanned his fingerprints at a kiosk. He received \na receipt marked with an X.   \n655.  Mr. E. Paryavi presented the receipt to a CBP officer, who explained that he \nhad been randomly selected for secondary screening.  Mr. E. Paryavi was escorted to a back \nwaiting area where he was met by two other CBP officers who escorted him to another room.  \n656.  Mr. E. Paryavi’s personal belongings were searched. The CBP officers required \nhim to count the money in his wallet. They searched through photos in Mr. E. Paryavi’s cell \nphone and made note of the model number and specifications of the phone.  \n657.   The  CBP  officers  required  Mr.  E.  Paryavi  to  fill  out  a  worksheet  with \ninformation about his place of residence, his place of work, his date of birth, and other \ninformation. \n658.  A CBP officer also required Mr. E. Paryavi to provide contact information for \nhis roommates, the friends he traveled with to Columbia, and immediate family members. \n119 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 120 of 150\nHe was also required to provide the nationality, current place of residence, and date of birth \nfor all immediate family members.  \n659.  Mr. E. Paryavi was interrogated for approximately one hour.  \n660.  Five days later, Mr. E. Paryavi received an email explaining that his Global \nEntry had been revoked.  \n661.  Upon  information and  belief,  Mr.  E.  Paryavi’s Global  Entry  was  revoked \nbecause of his status on Defendants’ federal terror watchlist.   \n662.  Moreover, upon information and belief, Mr. E. Paryavi’s TSA Pre✓ ® status was \nrevoked because his boarding passes no longer contain the words, “TSA Precheck.” \n663.  Upon information and belief, Mr. E. Paryavi’s TSA Pre✓ ® was revoked because \nof his status on Defendants’ federal terror watchlist.   \n664.  Ever since that trip, when Mr. E. Paryavi travels by air, his boarding pass is \nroutinely stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he has been designated by \nDefendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.”  \n665.  He is routinely unable to check in online or print his boarding pass.  \n666.  Rather, Mr. E. Paryavi is routinely directed to an airline representative, who \nthen contacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that \ncan take a very long time.  \n667.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it.  \n668.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Mr. E. Paryavi to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive \n120 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 121 of 150\npat down, an extensive search of all of his personal belongings and chemical residue testing \nof his person and his belongings at the TSA security checkpoint, in public view and in front \nof his travel companions.  Mr. E. Paryavi is ashamed and humiliated that his friends witness \nhim  being  treated by Defendants as a criminal  and a “known  or suspected terrorist.” \nMoreover, Mr. E. Paryavi is ashamed and humiliated that his travel companions are routinely \nmade to suffer just because they are traveling with him.   \n669.  On one occasion, while traveling domestically, an agent at the gate asked Mr. \nE.  Paryavi  to  approach  the  counter  and  notified  him  that  he  needed  to  verify  his \ndocumentation.  The  agent  told  Mr.  E.  Paryavi  that  the  system  required his  passport. \nHowever, because it was a domestic flight, Mr. E. Paryavi did not have his passport with him. \nThe agent then called a supervisor. Eventually, the agent told Mr. E. Paryavi he would be able \nto board his flight. When Mr. E. Paryavi attempted to board, the system rejected his boarding \npass. Again, an agent spoke with a supervisor to obtain clearance for him to board his flight.  \n670.  On or about May 28, 2018, Mr. E. Paryavi and his friends were stopped at a US-\nMexico port of entry on his way into the United States. They were directed to pull over and \nturn off the car ignition.  CBP officers confiscated the passports of Mr. E. Paryavi and his \ntravel companions.  A yellow sticker was placed in Mr. E. Paryavi’s passport.  \n671.  After two hours of waiting in the car, a CBP officer escorted Mr. E. Paryavi to a \nroom where he was interrogated about his travel history, his occupation, and his family.  \n672.  The CBP officer searched through Mr. E. Paryavi’s personal belongings and his \nphotos on his cell phone. \n673.  Mr. E. Paryavi filed a DHS Trip inquiry. He received a letter as described in \nparagraph 178 and was assigned a Redress Control Number in connection with that latter. \n121 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 122 of 150\n674.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Paryavi remains on the federal terror watch \nlist.  \nPlaintiff Faraz Siddiqui \n(A Watchlisted Plaintiff) \n675.  Since approximately 2010, every time Mr. Siddiqui travels by air, his boarding \npass is routinely stamped with the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he has been designated \nby Defendants as a “known or suspected terrorist.” \n676.  He is routinely unable to check in for his flights online or print his boarding \npass. \n677.  Rather Mr. Siddiqui is directed each time to an airline representative, who then \ncontacts Defendants to obtain clearance to allow him to board his flight, a process that can \ntake a very long time. \n678.  Once the airline representative receives clearance from Defendants allowing \nhim to board his flight, the airline representative prints his boarding pass with the “SSSS” \ndesignation on it. \n679.  When Mr. Siddiqui scans his boarding pass at the entrance to the TSA security \ncheckpoint, the scanner indicates a red light. \n680.  Upon seeing the “SSSS” designation on his boarding pass, as protocol, TSA \nagents then subject Mr. Siddiqui to routine, extensive and lengthy screening, an invasive pat \ndown, an extensive search of all of his personal belongings and chemical residue testing of \nhis person and his belongings – twice – at the TSA security checkpoint and again at the gate, \nin public view and in front of his travel companions. \n122 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 123 of 150\n681.  Whenever Mr. Siddiqui arrives in the United States from international trips, \ntwo CBP officers check everyone’s passports as they deplane until they identify him. \n682.  The two CBP officers then escort him from the gate to an interrogation room \nwhere he is detained and interrogated by FBI agents or CBP officers.  All of his personal \nbelongings are also searched. \n683.  Additionally, whenever Mr. Siddiqui has electronics in his possession, CBP \nofficers  confiscate  his  electronics  and  upon  information  and  belief,  download  the \ninformation from them, including his laptop and his cell phone, without his consent. \n684.  Upon returning on a flight from Saudi Arabia, Mr. Siddiqui was interrogated \nabout whether he ever crossed the border from Saudi Arabia to Yemen, whether he knew \nanyone who worked for Al Qaeda, and what his opinions are on foreign matters.  \n685.  During many of the trips that Mr. Siddiqui traveled with his wife and children, \nthey were subjected to substantially similar treatment as him. \n686.  On one occasion, Mr. Siddiqui’s two-months old daughter was screened.  \n687.  In order to avoid being treated as “known or suspected terrorists” when they \ntravel, Mr. Siddiqui’s wife and children now travel separately from Mr. Siddiqui. \n688.  On more than one occasion, FBI agents attempted to interrogate Mr. Siddiqui \nin his home.  Shortly after Mr. Siddiqui refused to speak with FBI agents without an attorney \npresent, FBI agents interrogated a relative of Mr. Siddiqui.  Upon information and belief, Mr. \nSiddiqui’s relative was subjected to an FBI interrogation because of his relation to Mr. \nSiddiqui and due to Mr. Siddiqui’s status on Defendants’ federal terror watchlist.  \n123 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 124 of 150\n689.  Further, shortly after Mr. Siddiqui was designated on the federal watchlist, his \npersonal bank accounts were suddenly closed without notice or explanation of the reasons \nwhy they were closed. \n690.  Upon information and belief, Defendants disseminated the stigmatizing label \nof “known or suspected terrorist” attached to Mr. Siddiqui to his bank, and as a result, his \nbank accounts were closed without notice.  \n691.  Relatives who share a last name with Mr. Siddiqui also had personal bank \naccounts suddenly closed without notice or explanation of the reasons why they were closed.  \nUpon information and belief, this occurred because of their relation to Mr. Siddiqui and his \nstatus on Defendants’ federal terror watchlist.  \n692.  Mr. Siddiqui has filed multiple  DHS TRIP inquiries.  He has since received \nmultiple letters as described in paragraph 178 above and was assigned multiple Redress \nControl Numbers in connection with those letters. \n693.  As a result of his watchlist designation and his treatment while traveling, Mr. \nSiddiqui is unable to apply for jobs which require him to travel.  \n694.  Further, Mr. Siddiqui desires to return to Saudi Arabia for Hajj, a religious \nobligation for Muslims, but has not done so out of fear of the treatment he would receive by \nDefendants.  \n695.  Mr. Siddiqui has considered permanently moving his family outside the United \nStates to avoid the treatment he receives as a result of his watchlist designation. \n696.  Upon  information and  belief,  Mr. Siddiqui  remains  on the  federal terror \nwatchlist.   \n \n124 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 125 of 150\nCOUNT I \n \nFAILURE TO PROVIDE A HEARING AND PRE-DEPRIVATION NOTICE, OR \nALTERNATIVELY, POST-DEPRIVATION NOTICE IN VIOLATION OF THE FIFTH \nAMENDMENT RIGHT TO PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n \n697.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n698.  Defendants have placed Plaintiffs’ names in the Terrorist Screening Database. \n699.  Defendants have placed Plaintiffs’ names in TSA and CBP watchlists generated \nby high-risk targeting rules, such as the Quiet Skies Selectee List. \n700.  Plaintiffs have experienced economic, reputational, and liberty harms due to \nDefendants’ placement of their names on the watchlist.   \n701.  Each  of  the  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful \npermanent residents, and foreign nationals learned that he or she was placed on the federal \nterrorist watchlist subsequent to being added on the federal terrorist watchlist and seek to \nchallenge such placement. \n702.  Plaintiffs’  experiences  are  substantially  similar  to  thousands  of  other \nAmericans and foreign nationals on the No Fly, Selectee, Expanded Selectee, TSDB, and Quiet \nSkies Selectee lists.  Plaintiffs experiences are indictive of Defendants’ current practices and \npolicies.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs bring this procedural due process challenge both as-applied \nto themselves,  and facially  to the category of watchlisted  persons who have not been \narrested, charged, or convicted of a terrorism-related offense.  \n703.  Defendants’ actions as described above in refusing to provide Plaintiffs and \nsimilarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals with \nany  notice  of their  placement  has  deprived  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American \n125 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 126 of 150\ncitizens,  lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals of constitutionally  protected \nliberty interests. \n704.  Defendants’ actions in nominating Plaintiffs and similarly situated American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals to the federal terrorist watchlist \nblatantly  violate the  requirement that  “nominations must not be solely based on race, \nethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment protected activities.”  49 \nU.S.C. § 114(h)(3). \n705.  Even when a nomination is not “solely” based on race, ethnicity, national \norigin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment protected activities,  Defendants consider \nand rely on those protected traits as factors supporting placement on federal terrorist \nwatchlists.   Defendants considered and relied upon one or more of these impermissible \nfactors in placing Plaintiffs and similarly American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and \nforeign nationals on federal terrorist watchlists. \n706.  Defendants who  contributed to  the  placement  of Plaintiffs  and  similarly \nsituated American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals on the federal \nterrorist  watchlist  knew  that  their  actions  violated  clearly  established  federal  and \nconstitutional law. \n707.  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful  permanent \nresidents, and foreign nationals have a liberty interest in traveling free from unreasonable \nburdens within, to, and from the United States, including through land border crossings and \nover U.S. air space.  Defendants have deprived Plaintiffs and similarly situated American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals of their right to travel on equal \n126 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 127 of 150\nterms as other travelers.  Defendants have deprived Plaintiffs and other similarly situated \nAmerican citizens of their liberty interest in traveling free from unreasonable burdens. \n708.  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful  permanent \nresidents, and foreign nationals have a right to be free from false government stigmatization \nas  individuals  who are  “known  or suspected to  be”  terrorists, or  who are  otherwise \nassociated with terrorist activity.    Defendants have officially imposed on  Plaintiffs  and \nsimilarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals the \nstigmatizing  label of “known or suspected terrorists” without a constitutionally adequate \nlegal mechanism for doing so.  Defendants have them disseminated the stigmatizing label to \nforeign, state and local government entities and private partners. \n709.  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful  permanent \nresidents, and foreign nationals have a liberty interest in nonattainder (ie:  the interest \nagainst being singled out for punishment without trial).  Defendants’ actions have singled \nout Plaintiffs and others similarly situated for punishments that include, but are not limited \nto, inability to travel by air, unreasonable burdens placed upon travel, false association with \na list of individuals suspected of terrorism, deprivation of the Second Amendment right to \nbear arms, unreasonable searches and seizures of electronic devices, and discriminatory \ntargeting on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, and religion. \n710.  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful  permanent \nresidents,  and  foreign nationals  have  been burdened or prevented from  boarding on \ncommercial flights or entering the United States at land border crossings, have had their \nbank  accounts  closed,  have  been  prevented  from  making  wire  transfers  at  financial \ninstitutions, have had their citizenship applications delayed indefinitely due to an “FBI name \n127 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 128 of 150\ncheck,” have lost lucrative economic opportunities, credentials, and employment.  Plaintiffs \nhave suffered from other forms of financial harm.  \n711.  All  citizens,  lawful  permanent  residents,  and  foreign nationals  adversely \naffected by the terrorist watchlist are entitled to a constitutionally adequate legal mechanism \nthat affords them full notice of the reasons and bases for their placement and a meaningful \nopportunity to contest their continued inclusion.  Yet Defendants have failed to provide the \nmost basic ingredients of due process, which is notice and a meaningful opportunity to be \nheard.  \n712.  Defendants shield their watchlist decisions from review, and do not provide \nPlaintiffs or any similarly  affected citizens an impartial tribunal which can substantively \nevaluate the propriety of (a) the Defendants’ watchlist inclusion standards, (b) Defendants’ \nadherence to their own standards, (c) the facts purportedly justifying Plaintiffs’ placement \non  the  TSDB,  classification  within  the  TSDB,  or  placement  on  other  federal terrorist \nwatchlists, (d) the lack of opportunity to offer any clarification or correction of those facts by \nPlaintiffs, or (e) the constitutionality of Defendants’ nomination or redress processes. \n713.  By imposing on Plaintiffs  and similarly  situated American citizens,  lawful \npermanent residents, and foreign nationals the stigmatizing label of “known or suspected \nterrorists” or “terrorists,” and by failing to provide Plaintiffs and others similarly situated \nwith a constitutionally adequate legal mechanism to challenge that designation, Defendants \nhave  deprived  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful  permanent \nresidents, and foreign nationals of their protected liberty interests.   \n714.  Defendants knew  at  the  time  they  acted  unlawfully  that  Supreme Court \nprecedent required that, whenever a citizen  is deprived of a liberty interest, the federal \n128 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 129 of 150\ngovernment must at least provide the deprived with some form of notice that a deprivation \noccurred. \n715.  Defendants have violated the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and similarly \nsituated  American  citizens,  lawful  permanent residents,  and  foreign nationals  without \naffording them due process of law and will continue to do so into the future if Plaintiffs and \nsimilarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals are \nnot afforded the relief demanded below. \n716.  By  placing  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful \npermanent residents, and foreign nationals on the federal terrorist watchlist, Defendants \ncaused them an actual, imminent  and irreparable injury that cannot be undone through \nmonetary remedies. \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief \nthis Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT II \n \nDEPRIVATION OF PROTECTED LIBERTIES IN VIOLATION OF FIFTH AMENDMENT \nRIGHT TO SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n \n717.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n718.  Substantive  due  process protects  Americans’  freedom  from  government \naction which infringes upon their fundamental constitutional rights.  Government action \nwhich infringes upon these rights cannot be arbitrary and must be narrowly tailored to serve \na compelling government interest. \n129 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 130 of 150\n719.  Defendants  have  placed  Plaintiffs  on  the  watchlist  despite  lacking  any \nreasonable suspicion that Plaintiffs are known or potential terrorists. \n720.  Plaintiffs’ experience is substantially similar to thousands of other Americans \nand foreign nationals on the watchlist and reflects Defendants’ current practices and policies. \n721.  Defendants’ actions in nominating Plaintiffs and similarly situated American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals to the federal terrorist watchlist \nblatantly violate the requirement that “’nominations’ must not be solely based on race, \nethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment protected activities.”  49 \nU.S.C. § 114(h)(3). \n722.  Even when a nomination is not “solely” based on race, ethnicity, national \norigin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment protected activities,  Defendants consider \nand rely on those protected traits as factors supporting placement on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist.   Defendants considered and relied upon one or more of these impermissible \nfactors in placing Plaintiffs and similarly American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and \nforeign nationals on the federal terrorist watchlist. \n723.  Defendants’ consideration of and reliance on the suspect classifications of \nrace, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, as well as First Amendment protected \nactivities, throughout the federal terrorist watchlisting system has placed an undue burden \non Plaintiffs’ fundamental rights to be free from discrimination. \n724.  Defendants’ dissemination  of the watchlist  to the gun market in order to \npreclude Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent residents, \nand foreign nationals from purchasing guns has placed an undue burden on Plaintiffs’ \n130 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 131 of 150\nfundamental right to keep and bear arms.  See McDonald v. City of Chicago, Ill., 561 U.S. 742, \n778 (2010). \n725.  Defendants’ policy of subjecting Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated watchlisted \nAmerican citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals to has placed an undue \nburden on Plaintiffs’ fundamental right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.  \n726.  By  placing  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful \npermanent residents, and foreign nationals on the federal terrorist watchlist, Defendants \nhave placed an undue burden on their fundamental right to travel domestically. \n727.    By  placing  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful \npermanent residents, and foreign nationals on the federal terrorist watchlist, Defendants \nhave placed an undue burden on their fundamental right to travel internationally. \n728.  By  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful  permanent \nresidents, and foreign nationals on the federal terrorist watchlist, Defendants have treated \nPlaintiffs like second-class citizens.   \n729.  Defendants lack a compelling interest in placing innocent persons, particularly \nthose with no prior terrorism related criminal record and no probable cause for suspicion of \nterrorism related crimes, on the federal terrorist watchlist. \n730.  Defendants’ watchlist lacks a compelling interest insofar as their true purpose \nis to provide law enforcement with a tool to harass and intimidate American Muslims, to \ntrack such persons, and coerce American Muslims into becoming informants. \n731.  Defendants’ watchlists are also not narrowly tailored insofar as the federal \nterrorist watchlists are entirely and demonstrably ineffectual and obvious alternatives exist. \n131 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 132 of 150\nThe defendants, for example, have never placed a person who committed a violent act of \nterrorism inside the United States on the No Fly List prior to the terrorist act. \n732.  Defendants’ actions  in  placing  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals on the federal terrorist watchlist, \nofficially imposing on Plaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent \nresidents, and foreign nationals the stigmatizing label of “known or suspected terrorists,” \nand widely disseminating  the stigmatizing  label to numerous governmental and private \npartners, are arbitrary and capricious, shock the conscience, violate the decencies of civilized \nconduct and are so brutal and offensive that they do not comport with the traditional ideas \nof fair play and decency. \n733.  Because Plaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent \nresidents, and foreign nationals have not been charged with any violent or terrorism-related \ncrimes and are United States citizens, Plaintiffs challenge their placement and the placement \nof others similarly situated American citizens on the federal terrorist watchlist on a broad, \nas-applied basis. \n734.  Plaintiffs’ substantive due process challenge is also facial, as there are no \ncircumstances where their placement or the placement of others similarly situated on the \nfederal terrorist watchlist  is  narrowly tailored  to  achieve any  compelling  government \ninterest. \n735.  Defendants  have  thus  violated  Plaintiffs’  constitutional  rights  and  the \nconstitutional  rights  of  other  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful  permanent \nresidents and foreign nationals without affording them due process of law.  Defendants will \n132 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 133 of 150\ncontinue to do so into the future if Plaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens, lawful \npermanent residents, and foreign nationals are not afforded the relief demanded below. \n736.  By  placing  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful \npermanent residents, and foreign nationals on the federal watchlist, Defendants have caused \nthem an actual, imminent and irreparable injury that cannot be undone through monetary \nremedies. \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief \nthis Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT III \n \nUNLAWFUL AGENCY ACTION IN VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE \nACT, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706 \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n \n737.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n738.  Defendants’ placement of Plaintiffs on the terrorist watchlist, placement of \nPlaintiffs on the Quiet Skies Selectee List, and subsequent DHS TRIP and TSC determinations \nregarding Plaintiffs’ watchlist status, constitute agency actions. \n739.  Plaintiffs and other similarly situated American citizens are not required to \nexhaust the DHS TRIP process in connection with any watchlist status, under the holding in \nDarby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137 (1993).  See Gulet Mohamed v. Eric R. Holder, Jr., et al., Case No. \n11-cv-00050, Dkt. 70 at 22(E.D.V.A. 2011) (Exhibit 7). \n740.  Defendants’ actions  in  placing  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals on the federal terrorist watchlist, \nofficially imposing on Plaintiffs the stigmatizing label of “known or suspected terrorists,” \n133 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 134 of 150\ndisseminating the stigmatizing label to governmental and private partners, and providing no \nconstitutionally adequate avenue for redress, were and are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, otherwise not in accordance with  law,  and contrary to constitutional rights, \npower, privilege, or immunity, and should be set aside as unlawful pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n741.  Defendants’ actions in nominating Plaintiffs and similarly situated American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals to the federal terrorist watchlist \nblatantly violate the requirement that “’nominations’ must not be solely based on race, \nethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment protected activities.”  49 \nU.S.C. § 114(h)(3). \n742.  Even when a nomination is not “solely”  based on race, ethnicity, national \norigin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment protected activities,  Defendants consider \nand rely on those protected traits as factors supporting placement on the federal terrorist \nwatchlist.   Defendants considered and relied upon one or more of these impermissible \nfactors in placing Plaintiffs and similarly American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and \nforeign nationals on the federal terrorist watchlist. \n743.  Defendants’ have failed to provide Plaintiffs and similarly situated American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals, who have been unreasonably \nburdened or denied boarding on commercial flights due to their placement on the federal \nterrorist watchlist, with a constitutionally adequate mechanism that (a) affords them notice \nof the reasons and bases for their placement on the federal terrorist watchlist  and (b) \nprovides a  meaningful opportunity to contest  their continued inclusion  on the federal \nterrorist watchlist.    Defendants’ action  is  arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, \n134 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 135 of 150\notherwise not in accordance with law, and contrary to constitutional rights, power, privilege, \nor immunity, and should be set aside as unlawful pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n744.  Because Plaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent \nresidents, and foreign nationals do not present a security threat to commercial aviation, \nDefendants’ actions as described above in including Plaintiffs and other similarly situated \nAmerican citizens on the federal terrorist watchlist unreasonably burdens or prevents them \nfrom boarding commercial  flights  or entering the United  States across the border, are \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, otherwise not in accordance with  law, and \ncontrary to constitutional rights, power, privilege, or immunity, and should be set aside as \nunlawful pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n745.  By  placing  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful \npermanent residents, and foreign nationals on the federal watchlist, Defendants caused them \nan  actual,  imminent  and  irreparable injury  that  cannot be  undone through monetary \nremedies. \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief \nthis Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT IV \n \nVIOLATION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT (EQUAL PROTECTION)  \nTO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n \n746.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n747.  Defendants’ actions  in  placing  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals on the federal terrorist watchlist, \n135 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 136 of 150\nofficially imposing on Plaintiffs the stigmatizing label of “known or suspected terrorists,” \ndisseminating the stigmatizing label to governmental and private partners, and providing no \nconstitutionally adequate avenue for redress, are discriminatory and constitute actions that \ntarget individuals for distinctive  and adverse treatment on the basis of constitutionally \nprotected traits and activities.   \n748.  As a matter of policy and official practice, Defendants consider at least the \nfollowing traits of Plaintiffs’  and similarly situated American citizens,  lawful permanent \nresidents, and foreign nationals origin as factors for designation as terrorists and inclusion \nin the TSDB and throughout the watchlisting  system: national origination from Muslim-\nmajority countries, ethnic origination as Arab or Middle Eastern, travel to Muslim-majority \ncountries,  travel  on  religious  pilgrimages,  learning  Arabic,  attending  mosques,  zakat \ndonations to Muslim charities, the wearing of typical Muslim dress, the frequency of Muslim \nprayer, adherence to sharia law, affiliations with Muslim organizations, and associations \nwith other Muslims. \n749.  Defendants selectively apply and enforce watchlist and screening policies to \nindividuals who appear to be or who are known or suspected to be Muslim or Middle Eastern.  \n750.  Plaintiffs’  experiences  are  substantially  similar  to  thousands  of  other \nAmericans and foreign nationals on the watchlist and reflect Defendants’ current practices \nand policies.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs brings this equal protection challenge both as-applied to \nthemselves and facially.  \n751.  Defendants’ actions in nominating Plaintiffs and similarly situated American \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals to the federal terrorist watchlist \nblatantly violate the requirement that “’nominations’ must not be solely based on race, \n136 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 137 of 150\nethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment protected activities.”  49 \nU.S.C. § 114(h)(3). \n752.  Even when a nomination is not “solely” based on race, ethnicity, national \norigin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment protected activities,  Defendants consider \nand rely on those protected traits as factors supporting placement on federal terrorist \nwatchlists.   Defendants considered and relied upon one or more of these impermissible \nfactors in placing Plaintiffs and similarly American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and \nforeign nationals on federal terrorist watchlists. \n753.  By  placing  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  lawful \npermanent residents, and foreign nationals on the federal terrorist watchlist, Defendants \nhave treated them like second-class citizens.   \n754.  Defendants’ above-described actions were motivated by the race, ethnicity, \nnational origin, religious affiliation, religious exercise, and gender of Plaintiffs and similarly \nsituated American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals.  \n755.  Defendants’ above-described actions have had a discriminatory effect upon \nand have disparately impacted Plaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens,  lawful \npermanent residents, and foreign nationals who are or who are perceived as Muslim, Arab, \nMiddle Eastern, or otherwise belonging to a racial, ethnic, or national origin class associated \nwith Muslim-majority regions of the world.  \n756.  Defendants’ above-described actions, policies, course of conduct, or pattern of \npractice that mandate, permit, or consider the above-described discriminatory treatment of \nPlaintiffs and similarly situated American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign \n137 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 138 of 150\nnationals does not serve a compelling state interest or a legitimate or public purpose, nor are \nthey the least restrictive means or narrowly tailored to achieve any such interest. \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief \nthis Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT V \n \nVIOLATION OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION – FOURTH AMENDMENT \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n757.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n758.  On June 22, 2018, the Supreme Court recognized in Carpenter v. United States, \n138 S. Ct. 2206, 2214 (2018) that: “The Fourth Amendment protects ‘[t]he right of the people \nto be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and \nseizures.’ The ‘basic purpose of this Amendment,’ our cases have recognized, ‘is to safeguard \nthe privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.’ \nCamara v. Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco, 387 U.S. 523, 528 (1967). The \nFounding generation crafted the Fourth Amendment as a ‘response to the reviled ‘general \nwarrants' and ‘writs of assistance’ of the colonial era, which allowed British officers to \nrummage through homes in an unrestrained search for evidence of criminal activity.’ Riley v. \nCalifornia, 573 U.S. ––––, ––––, 134 S.Ct. 2473, 2494 (2014) … Likewise in Riley, the Court \nrecognized the ‘immense storage capacity’ of modern cell phones in holding that police \nofficers must generally obtain a warrant before searching the contents of a phone. 573 U.S., \nat ––––.” \n138 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 139 of 150\n759.  As a matter of official policy and practice, and particularly at the border, \nDefendants seize and confiscate watchlisted individuals’  electronic devices.  Defendants \nroutinely do not return the electronic devices to the watchlisted individuals for weeks or \nmonths, if not longer. \n760.  As a matter of official policy and practice, and particularly at the border, \nDefendants download and copy the contents of watchlisted individuals’ electronic devices \nonto Defendants’ computers and upload those contents to Defendants’ watchlisting  and \nintelligence databases. \n761.   As a matter of official policy and practice, Defendants’ utilize the contents of \nwatchlisted individuals’ electronic devices as a source of intelligence.  Defendants’ utilize the \ncontents and contacts of watchlisted  individuals’ electronic  devices in  order to launch \ninvestigations into and nominate associates of the watchlisted individual for rules-based \nterrorist monitoring and inclusion in the federal terrorist watchlist. \n762.  Defendants’ lack consent, reasonable suspicion, probable cause, or a warrant \nfor their seizures and searches of watchlistees’ electronic devices. \n763.  Defendants lack  reasonable suspicion,  probable cause, or arrest warrants \nrelated to terrorism crimes that would justify Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated American \ncitizens,  permanent residents,  and  foreign nationals  inclusion  on  the  federal terrorist \nwatchlist. \n764.  Defendants’ seizures and searches are unreasonable, unconstitutional,  and \nviolate Plaintiffs and other watchlistees’ reasonable expectations of privacy. \n765.  Defendants’ and  their  officers  and  agents  knew  that  their  seizures  and \nsearches were unreasonable, unconstitutional under settled federal and constitutional law, \n139 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 140 of 150\nand violated Plaintiffs and other watchlistees’ reasonable expectations of privacy at the time \nthey carried out the searches and seizures. \n766.  Defendants have confiscated Plaintiffs’ electronic devices, copied the devices’ \ncontents,  and searched and utilized  those contents  for  intelligence  and  investigations.  \nDefendants have engaged these seizures and searches solely because Plaintiffs and similarly \nsituated American citizens, permanent residents, and foreign nationals are listed on the \nfederal terrorist watchlist.  \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief \nthis Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT VI \n \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n767.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n768.  The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging \nthe freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble.”  U.S. \nConst. amend. I.  These rights “are protected not only against heavy-handed frontal attack, \nbut also from being stifled by more subtle governmental interference.”  Bates v. City of Little \nRock, 361 U.S. 516, 523 (1960).  As the Supreme Court has explained, “associational rights . . \n. can be abridged even by government actions that do not directly restrict individuals' ability \nto associate freely.” Lyng v. Int'l Union, UAW, 485 U.S. 360, 367 n.5(1988); see AFL-CIO v. FEC, \n333 F.3d 168, 175 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (explaining that compulsory “disclosure of political \naffiliations and activities can impose just as substantial a burden on First Amendment rights \n140 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 141 of 150\nas can direct regulation”); Baird v. State Bar of Ariz., 401 U.S. 1, 6-7 (1971) (explaining that \n“[w]hen a State seeks to inquire about an individual’s beliefs and associations a heavy burden \nlies upon it to show that the inquiry is necessary to protect a legitimate state interest”). \n769.  Defendants policies and practices broadly permit suspicionless searches and \ncopying  of  Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  watchlisted  individuals  electronic  devices.  \nDefendants searches and copying are done in pursuit of intelligence and information about \nPlaintiffs and similarly situated watchlisted individuals’ communications, expressions, social \nmedia  activities,  and  associations.    Defendants  intend  to  use  that  intelligence  and \ninformation in order to single out Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated watchlisted individuals’ \nfamilies, friends, coworkers, and other associates for investigation as potential terrorists. \n770.  The  seizure,  search,  and  copying  of  Plaintiffs’  and  similarly  situated \nwatchlisted individuals’ electronic devices gives the government possession of confidential \nlists  of memberships and associations. Such  “[c]ompulsory disclosure ...  ‘can seriously \ninfringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First Amendment,’ and can \n‘have ... a profound chilling effect.’” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 64 (1976); accord Perry v. \nSchwarzenegger, 591 F.3d 1126, 1135 (9th Cir. 2009).  \n771.  Defendants have placed an undue burden on Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated \nindividuals’ First Amendment rights to expression and association. \n772.  Warrantless seizures and searches of the contents of Plaintiffs’ electronic \ndevices,  including  information  about  Plaintiffs’  associations  and  affiliations,  impose  a \nsignificant  or substantial  burden on watchlisted  individuals’ First Amendment rights to \nexpression and association. \n141 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 142 of 150\n773.  Defendants’ actions in burdening Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated watchlisted \nindividuals’ First Amendment rights to expression and association are not supported by a \ncompelling  or legitimate  state  interest,  because Defendants lack  reasonable suspicion, \nprobable cause, or a warrant that watchlisted individuals are terrorist criminals. \n774.  Defendants actions in burdening Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated watchlisted \nindividuals’ First Amendment rights to expression and association are not narrowly tailored, \nnot the least restrictive means, and not in furtherance of an appropriate form of means-end \nbalancing to achieve a government interest. \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief \nthis Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT VII \n \nVIOLATION OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION – SECOND AMENDMENT \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n775.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n776.  The Second Amendment protects the fundamental individual  right to bear \narms. \n777.  Defendants disseminate the federalist terrorist watchlist with the knowledge \nand intent that law enforcement agencies and providers of background checks will use the \nwatchlist  to screen gun purchasers, and thereafter block, hinder, or burden watchlisted \nindividuals in their attempt to obtain guns. \n778.  Even where a watchlisted individual possesses valid permits to possess and \ncarry firearms, their watchlist status is used as a basis to deny the purchase of firearms. \n142 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 143 of 150\n779.  Multiple states and government entities have adopted or considered laws and \npolicies which  bar individuals  listed on the federal terrorist watchlist  from purchasing \nfirearms. \n780.  As a result of their watchlist status, Plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals \nhave been blocked, hindered, or burdened from exercising their right to bear arms. \n781.  Defendants have placed an undue burden on Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated \nindividuals’ Second Amendment right to own firearms. \n782.  Defendants’ actions in burdening Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated watchlisted \nindividuals’ Second Amendment right to own firearms are not supported by a compelling or \nlegitimate state interest, because Defendants lack reasonable suspicion, probable cause, or a \nwarrant that watchlisted individuals are terrorist criminals. \n783.  Defendants actions in burdening Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated watchlisted \nindividuals’ Second Amendment right to own firearms are not narrowly tailored, not the \nleast  restrictive  means,  and  not  in  furtherance of an  appropriate form of  means-end \nbalancing to achieve a government interest. \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief \nthis Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT VIII \n \nVIOLATION OF THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n784.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n143 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 144 of 150\n785.  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. 2000bb et. \nseq., provides that Defendants \"shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion\" \nunless that  burden is the least restrictive means to further a compelling governmental \ninterest.  42 U.S.C. 2000bb01(a) and(b). \n786.  Plaintiff  Farid Sulayman sincerely held religious beliefs that he personally \nperforms Umrah, a religious pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia.  As a religious leader, it is \nalso part of his sincerely held religious beliefs that lead Muslim pilgrims who wish to perform \nUmrah.  Plaintiff Farid Sulayman's compliance with these beliefs is a religious exercise.   \n787.  The Defendants’ actions in creating and then placing Plaintiff Farid Sulayman \non the federal terror watchlist imposes a substantial burden on Plaintiff Farid Sulayman's \nreligious  exercise  and  similarly  situated  individuals.    Defendants  have  imposed  a \nburdensome, stigmatizing, and public screening process that is discouraging Plaintiff Farid \nSulayman from engaging in Umrah in order to avoid the treatment  directed at him by \nDefendants.  Defendants' actions have also damaged Plaintiff Farid Sulayman's standing in \nhis community thereby jeopardizing his ability to lead congregations in the future.  Plaintiff \nFarid Sulayman intends to lead Umrah group in order to fulfill his sincerely held religious \nbeliefs.   \n788.  The federal terror watchlist chills Plaintiff Farid Sulayman's religious exercise. \n789.  The federal terror watchlist is not narrowly tailored to achieve any compelling \ngovernmental interest.   \n790.  The federal terror watchlist is not the least restrictive means of furthering \nDefendants' stated interests.   \n144 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 145 of 150\n791.  The  United  States  government  has  no  compelling  interest  in  restricting \nPlaintiff Farid Sulayman ability to lead pilgrims on a religious rite of passage, Umrah.   \n792.  Defendants' unlawful actions are imposing an immediate and ongoing harm \non Plaintiff Farid Sulayman and have caused Plaintiff Farid Sulayman emotional distress, \ndeprivation of his constitutional and statutory rights, damage to his reputation, and material \nand economic loss.   \n793.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Defendants and the federal \nterror watchlist, Plaintiff Farid Sulayman and similarly situated individuals have been and \nwill continue to be harmed.  So long as Defendants maintain the federal terror watchlist, \nPlaintiff Farid Sulayman's exercise of his religious beliefs, including performing and leading \nUmrah, will be substantially burdened. \n794.  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Farid Sulayman requests this Honorable Court grant \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, in addition to damages, in the form described in the Prayer \nfor Relief below, plus all such other relief this Court deems just and proper including costs \nand attorneys' fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT IX \n \nVIOLATION OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION – NON-DELEGATION \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n795.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n796.  Congress has not provided the Executive Branch with intelligible principles \nfrom which the Executive can implement its watchlist schemes regarding civil aviation and \nnational security. \n145 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 146 of 150\n797.  Congress has not directed the Executive Branch to create either a No Fly List \nor a Selectee List. \n798.  Congress has not  authorized  the  Executive  Branch to  utilize  the  federal \nterrorist watchlist to encourage financial institutions to close bank accounts or ban wire \ntransfers, to encourage car dealerships to restrict test drives or purchases of vehicles, or \nstate and local law enforcement to detain individuals based on their watchlist status.  \n799.  Congress has not authorized the Executive Branch to disseminate the terrorist \nwatchlist to governmental and private partners. \n800.  Homeland  Security  Presidential  Directive  6  is  an  illegal  usurpation  of \nCongress’ legislative function and the executive order runs afoul of separation of powers \nprinciples.   \n801.  The Executive Branch’s assignment of the watchlisting function to TSC violates \nCongress’ directive  that  the  TSA  should  determine  who  belongs  on  federal  terrorist \nwatchlists and the consequences that flow from being on those lists.   \n802.  Congress has not delegated to TSA the authority to create a process that can \nculminate in the removal of individuals from the TSDB. \n803.  In the alternative, Congress’s delegation to TSA to create a redress process is \ndefective because the Executive Branch has allocated watchlist authority in a manner that \nprevents TSA from creating a redress process. \n804.  As a result, Defendants have illegally acted beyond their authority. \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief \nthis Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action.  \n146 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 1   Filed 08/08/18   Page 147 of 150\nPrayer for Relief \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully requests: \n1.  A  declaratory judgment  that  Defendants’ policies,  practices,  and customs \nrelated to the federal terrorist watchlisting system violate the First Amendment, Second \nAmendment, Fourth Amendment, and Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as \nwell as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Administrative Procedure Act; \n2.

At that hearing, the Court indicated that it may need to better “understand[] \nhow . . . the Watch List Advisory Council [WLAC] works” in order to assess the question of Plaintiffs’ \nstanding to sue some of the defendants.1  Hearing Tr. at 9:6-9.  It consequently ordered the parties to \nmeet and confer regarding the parties “respective positions for expedited targeted discovery on \nstanding in advance of merits-based discovery.  (Dkt. 66).  The parties have now met and conferred \nwith respect to their positions on holding an evidentiary hearing (whether virtually or in person), or \ntargeted jurisdictional discovery.  Finding themselves unable to reach agreement, the Parties set forth \ntheir respective positions as follows: \n  Plaintiffs’ Position:  Plaintiffs believe  an evidentiary hearing would be illuminating for the \nCourt, but given the federal government’s propensity to mislead the public and courts about their \nwatchlisting system, a hearing would be most useful if it followed targeted, adversarial discovery. \nWithout this discovery, Defendants may be able to avoid liability for their actions by using national \nsecurity nondisclosure as both a sword and shield or otherwise misstate how their watchlisting system \n \n1 Defendants do not contest Plaintiffs’ standing against many Defendants.  “The only Defendants properly before \nthis Court on the claims alleged are TSA, FBI, TSC, NCTC, DHS, CBP, and ICE.”  Defendants’ Reply, Dkt. 53 at 4.   \n1 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 67   Filed 06/11/20   Page 2 of 10\nworks.  This possibility, underscored by the misleading declaration Defendants attach to this filing, is \nlikely what Defendants will use to base their demand to dismiss entities who help lead the watchlisting \nsystem and use it to injure Plaintiffs and others. \n  With regards to their secret watchlist that is disseminated all over the world, Defendants \nhave—unsurprisingly—a track record of obfuscation.  In a deposition two years ago, for example, the \nFBI testified that no private entity has access to watchlist information via the National Criminal \nInformation Center (NCIC).  Ex. B – Elhady FBI Dep. at 114.  This testimony, however, did not sway \nthe  Eastern  District  of  Virginia,  which  ordered  more  substantial  disclosures  regarding  private \ndissemination.  Those disclosures revealed that more than 1,400 private entities have access to \nwatchlist information.2   \n  On March 20, 2018, TSA testified during a deposition that it “does not perform intelligence \ncollection on passengers at the airport.”  Exhibit C - TSA Dep. at 185.  See also Id. at 181 (“I wouldn’t \nsay there’s a name for the different security measures…that may occur after the checkpoint.  There’s \nnot a name given for that.”).  Four months later, thanks to the Boston Globe’s Spotlight investigative \nteam, the public—and the Eastern District of Virginia—learned about TSA’s Quiet Skies3 program—\nan alarming, beyond-the-checkpoint intelligence-gathering operation that began on March 13, 2018, \njust a week before TSA testified deceptively.  There, Magistrate Judge Anderson ordered TSA to sit \nfor a subsequent deposition based on his concern that TSA’s testimony “really wasn’t accurate.”  \nExhibit D - El Hady Hearing Transcript at 79-80.   \n \n2 Matthew Barakat, Judge Orders Feds to List Private Groups Receiving Watchlist, Associated Press, (February 22, \n2019) https://apnews.com/be5c1138b2d3483db46cd311026ddb67 (“The government admitted earlier this month in \na court filing that private groups like universities and hospitals receive access to the list, after denying in previous \ncourt hearings and depositions that they do.”) \n3 Camila Domonoske, TSA’s ‘Quiet Skies’ Program Tracks, Observes Travelers in the Air, NPR (July 30, 2018) \nhttps://www.npr.org/2018/07/30/633980912/tsas-quiet-skies-program-tracks-observes-travelers-in-the-air \n2 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 67   Filed 06/11/20   Page 3 of 10\n  And now, Defendants submit a declaration claiming that the WLAC is nothing more than an \ninformal meeting.  But that is not how former TSC Director Timothy Groh characterized the WLAC.  \nOn March 1, 2018, TSC testified that officials made exceptions to their inclusion standard “[b]ecause \nwe were directed by the Watch Listing Advisory Council in certain instances for certain purposes to \napply a different standard.”  Exhibit E - TSC Dep. at 68.  TSC testified that the watchlisting system’s \n“policies and procedures are governed by whatever the current Watch Listing Guidance is, which is \npromulgated by…the Watch Listing Advisory Council.”  Id.  at 15.  Indeed, TSC made clear that the \nWLAC makes decisions “by unanimous consent.”  Id. at 28.   \n  Plaintiffs believe that written discovery to all defendants regarding (1) the WLAC and the \nDefendants’ roles in the WLAC, particularly their role in in creating, approving, and using Watchlist \nGuidance—the document that governs the entirety of the watchlisting system across all federal \nagencies and (2) Defendants’ access and use of watchlist information and their ability to remove or \nadd individuals to the TSDB. Plaintiffs also believe the following sixour depositions are appropriate: \n  1.  A 30(b)(6) deposition of the WLAC regarding how it operates, what it does, and how \nagencies participate in managing WLAC affairs.     \n2.  Jason V. Herring, Deputy Director of Operations of the Terrorist Screening Center, \nwho Defendants intend to call at the hearing. Plaintiffs would expect Deputy Director Herring to also \ntestify as a 30(b)(6) witness as to the TSC’s role as co-chair of the WLAC and what it knows about \nhow Defendants utilize TSDB information. \n  3.  A 30(b)(6) designee for the FBI, which is a primary leader of the watchlisting system \nacross the federal government, as to what the FBI knows about how other defendants and entities \nparticipate in the watchlisting system in addition to what watchlist information the FBI discloses to \nother Defendants when performing security investigations.for those Defendants. \n3 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 67   Filed 06/11/20   Page 4 of 10\n4.  The NCTC, who acts as the other co-chair of the WLAC, as to the WLAC and the \nNCTC’s role of co-chair of the WLAC. \n  5.  The Department of the Treasury, who, through itself or its subagency the Financial \nCrimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), use the watchlist to close listees’ bank accounts without \nnotice and blocking them from conducting wire. As the Second Amended Complaint details, plaintiffs \nAlbadawi, Siddiqui (and his family), Hachem, and Hijaz have had bank accounts terminated. Second \nAmended Complaint (Dkt. 44-1) at ¶¶ 881, 1008-09, 1205-06, 1350. Plaintiffs are also aware that \nFinCEN uses the watchlist to analyze listees’ financial records and nominate financial associates of \nthose listees to the watchlist.4 Plaintiffs need discovery from Treasury to more fully understand how \nTreasury uses the watchlist and what consequences Treasury imposes as a result of watchlist status.  \n  6.  USCIC, who uses the watchlist to deny those on it government benefits and impose \nconsequences, including indefinitely delaying or denying immigration benefits. Plaintiffs are aware that \nUSCIS has an express, yet secret, policy of delaying and denying applications for immigration benefits \nfrom those on the Watchlist that is currently the subject of active litigation. See Wagafe v. U.S. Citizenship \n& Immigration Servs.,17-cv-0009 (W.D. Wash. filed Jan. 23, 2017). This includes a program called the \nControlled Application Review and Resolution Program (CARRP), USCIS’s policy for “identifying \nand processing cases with national security (NS) concerns” and applies to “all applications and \npetitions that convey immigrant or nonimmigrant status.”5  CARRP is designed to “ensure that \nimmigration benefits are not granted to individuals and organizations that pose a threat to national \n \n4 Steve Hudak, FinCEN Awards Recognize Partnership Between Law Enforcement and Financial Institutions to Fight Financial Crime, \nFinCEN Press Release (May 10, 2016), https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-awards-recognize-\npartnership-between-law-enforcement-and-financial.  \n5 Jonathan R. Scharfen, Policy for Vetting and Adjudicating Cases with National Security Concerns, USCIS 1 & n.4 (Apr. 11, \n2008), \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/About%20Us/Electronic%20Reading%20Room/Policies_and_Man\nuals/CARRP_Guidance.pdf.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 67   Filed 06/11/20   Page 5 of 10\nsecurity.”6 CARRP creates significant hurdles for watchlistees to obtain immigration benefits that \ndelay those benefits and make them less likely to be granted.7 As a result, Plaintiffs have suffered delays \nin immigration benefits. Muminov’s mother had her visa revoked. Amended Complaint at ¶¶ 1124-\n25. Hijaz’s citizenship application has been stalled. Id. at ¶ 1351. The El Ali family has suffered as a \nresult of Khaled El Ali losing ESTA Travel Authorization and irregularities regarding his visa \nprocessing. Id. at ¶¶ 291 and 300. Plaintiffs require discovery to understand the connection between \nthe watchlist, CARRP process, and the delay or loss of immigration benefits, as well as USCIS’s \nconnections to Plaintiffs’ adverse consequences at land and air borders. \n  Written discovery, limited in scope, would not create an undue burden on Defendants. And \nallowing six targeted depositions is reasonable given how little the Government makes public about \nthe significant consequences caused by watchlist placement. \nPlaintiffs also believe they should be entitled to  seek additional depositions or  written \ndiscovery depending on the information (or lack thereof) that Defendants provide. And Plaintiffs are \naware  based  on  other  watchlist  litigation  that  Defendants  will  avoid  disclosure  of  pertinent \ninformation by purporting to rely on various security and deliberative privileges, which will inevitably \nrequire discovery motions practice. \n  If the Court is going to have an evidentiary hearing, Plaintiffs should also have the ability to \nenter into the evidence the results of any discovery as well as the record produced in Elhady v. Kable, \n16-cv-375 (E.D. Va.), to counter the Government’s evidence and provide their own as to why \njurisdiction is proper over each of the Defendants. \n \n \n6 U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., CARRP Officer Training: National Security Handouts 2 (Apr. 2009), \nhttps://www.aclusocal.org/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Guiance-for-Identifying-NS-Concerns-\nUSCIS-CARRPTraining-Mar.-2009.pdf.  \n7 See Jerome P. Bjelopera et al., The Terrorist Screening Database and Preventing Terrorist Travel, Congressional Research Serv. 4 \n(Nov. 7, 2016), https://fas.org/sgp/crs/terror/R44678.pdf, at 4 & 9, CARRP Office Training, at 2. \n5 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 67   Filed 06/11/20   Page 6 of 10\nDefendants’ Position:  Defendants recognize the Court’s desire to resolve any remaining \nquestions regarding the Plaintiffs’ standing to sue certain Defendant agencies as efficiently as \npossible.  To that end, Defendants respectfully provide the attached supplemental Declaration of \nJason V. Herring, Deputy Director for Operations of the Terrorist Screening Center, attached \nhereto as Defendants’ Exhibit 1, which describes in further detail the function and structure of the \nWLAC and its participant agencies, as well as information regarding “who controls and makes the \ndecisions with regard to the database,” Hearing Tr. at 15:1-2, with respect to nominations, \ngovernment information sharing, quality assurance, and removal.   Defendants provide this \ndeclaration to assist the Court in deciding whether Plaintiffs have standing against WLAC \nparticipant agencies.   \nIf the Court determines, after reviewing this supplemental declaration, that factual questions \nwith respect to the WLAC still remain, Defendants believe the best course of action would be to \nallow Deputy Director Herring to testify at a virtual evidentiary hearing on a set of topics to be \nidentified by the Court after the June 18, 2020 merits hearing.  Defendants request that any \nevidentiary hearing be held no earlier than 30 days after the issuance of an order setting such \nhearing, to allow Deputy Director Herring sufficient time to prepare while attending to the \nnumerous demanding and time-sensitive responsibilities of his position, and also to account for the \nimpact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on TSC’s normal staffing levels and operations. \nDefendants object to Plaintiffs’ extremely broad request for discovery prior to any \nevidentiary hearing.  Plaintiffs desire no fewer than six depositions, as well as unidentified and open-\nended “additional depositions or written discovery depending on the information (or lack thereof) \nthat Defendants provide.” See supra at 5.  Plaintiffs’ also propose deposition topics that make little \nsense:  Plaintiffs propose a deposition of FinCEN regarding “its use [of] the watchlist to close \nlistees’ bank accounts without notice and blocking them from conducting wire [transfers],” even \n6 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 67   Filed 06/11/20   Page 7 of 10\nthough neither FinCEN nor the Treasury Department has such authority, and Defendants informed \nPlaintiffs of this fact; and they propose a deposition of USCIS that includes a reference to a \npurported program that does not appear in their Amended Complaint, see supra ¶ 6, as well as to the \nESTA program, which is run through CBP, not USCIS.  See Defs’ MTD, ECF No. 49-1, at 23 n.13 \n(describing ESTA).  This Court should not allow Plaintiffs to obtain such discovery at this juncture \nwhere there are significantly more efficient and less burdensome options to answer any remaining \nquestions the Court may have as to standing. \nThe Court clearly indicated at the May 22, 2020 hearing that it would not “pull all of these \nagencies through a  . . . merits-based discovery on the surviving claims before understanding how . . . \nthe Watch List Advisory Council works.”  Hearing Tr. at 9:6-9.  Plaintiffs’ proposal does just that, \nand would impose a heavy burden on numerous federal agencies that are already operating at limited \ncapacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Particularly where the Court has already indicated it is \n“leaning strongly” toward eliminating a number of the defendant agencies from this suit, id. at 9:5, it \nshould not require those agencies to respond to burdensome jurisdictional discovery where a more \nefficient course of action is available.  In light of these concerns, if the Court has remaining \nquestions, Defendants request the Court hold an evidentiary hearing as described above. \nDefendants’ also object to Plaintiffs’ inclusion in this filing of numerous false allegations, \ncitations to news articles,8 and other irrelevant miscellany from prior litigation.  In particular, \nDefendants object to Plaintiffs’ allegations with respect to the NCIC and the TSA’s Quiet Skies \nprogram; both of these issues are nuanced, complex, and far afield from the standing question.  \nDefendants respectfully refer this Court to the Government’s declarations filed in Elhady for a \nfulsome picture on both issues.  See Elhady v. Piehota, No. 1:16-cv-375 (E.D. Va), ECF No. 239-1 \n \n8 The court may take judicial notice of the statements in the news articles Plaintiffs cite, but it may not use \nthem for the purpose of determining the truth of those statements.  See e.g. Shenwick v. Twitter, Inc., 282 F. \nSupp. 3d 1115, 1122-23 (N.D. Cal. 2017). \n7 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 67   Filed 06/11/20   Page 8 of 10\n(public redacted declaration of Hao-y Froemling describing the Quiet Skies program); id., ECF No. \n301-4 (declaration of Scott Rago, describing NCIC access to certain private entities for law \nenforcement purposes, and related protections).   \nDefendants object, as well, to Plaintiffs’ inclusion of various allegations regarding purported \nGovernment programs that do not appear in their Complaint.  See supra at 4-5.  Cf. CUMIS Ins. Soc., \nInc. v. Raines, No. CIV.A. 3:12-6277, 2013 WL 500305, at *2 (S.D.W. Va. Feb. 11, 2013) (holding that \nthe court would “not ascribe to a plaintiff a potential claim for relief which it has not pled,” where, \n“as master of the complaint, ‘[t]he plaintiff selects the claims that will be alleged.’”) (quoting United \nStates v. Jones, 125 F.3d 1418, 1428 (11th Cir. 1997)). If Plaintiffs wish to amend their Complaint they \nmay seek leave to do so, but they should not use this filing to add yet another aspect to a lawsuit \nalready bursting at the seams.  Furthermore, Defendants object to Plaintiffs’ request to enter \nunlimited evidence at an evidentiary hearing, if one is held, of “the results of any discovery as well as \nthe record produced in Elhady v. Kable, 16-cv-375 (E.D. Va.),” which was decided on summary \njudgement and includes reams of documents and other information irrelevant to the question of \nPlaintiffs’ standing against individual WLAC participant agencies.  Instead, as described above, \nDefendants request that the Court strictly limit the introduction of any such evidence to only \ninformation relevant to specific hearing topics to be identified by the Court. \nFinally, at the May 22, 2020 hearing, the Court requested that Defendants inform the Court \nbeforehand with respect to how counsel intend to split the argument between them.  To that end, \nDefendants’ counsel respectfully informs the Court that Antonia Konkoly will be handling the \njurisdictional questions related to the application of 49 U.S.C. § 46110 as well as the Plaintiffs’ \nstanding, the APA claim, the Fourth Amendment claims, and the Fifth Amendment Self-\nIncrimination claim.  Christopher Healy will address the Procedural and Substantive Due Process \nclaims, as well as the Equal Protection, First Amendment, RFRA, and Non-Delegation claims.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 8:18-cv-02415-PX   Document 67   Filed 06/11/20   Page 9 of 10\nAlthough this split does not align precisely with the order of arguments in the briefing, counsel \ndetermined such a division would best equalize the significant amount of preparation necessary \nbetween the two of them.  Defendants hope that this information will assist the Court in efficiently \nplanning the June 18, 2020 hearing. \nDated: June 11, 2020          Respectfully Submitted, \nJOSEPH H.
