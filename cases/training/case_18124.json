    "summary": "<p>This 2017 lawsuit challenged the FBI’s placement of a U.S. citizen on a terrorist watchlist; it was dismissed in 2019.</p><p>The Terrorism Screening DataBase, also known as the “terrorist watchlist,” is maintained by the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC), a division of the National Security Branch of the FBI. The watchlist includes sub-lists--a No Fly List and a Selectee List. People on the No Fly List are not allowed to fly on American airplanes or flights into the US. People included on the Selectee List are subject to additional screening by federal government officials at airports and land border crossings into the US. At airports, individuals on the Selectee List often have their boarding passes stamped with “SSSS” by airline agents.</p><p>In this case, the plaintiff claimed that he was subjected to extra security procedures at airports as early as 2014, perhaps because he was a cleric at his mosque (in Salt Lake City). The events more directly leading up to this litigation commenced in June 2017 when the plaintiff was denied boarding to a commercial flight bound for the U.S. by airport officials in Nairobi, Kenya. Though he was eventually allowed to board a flight the following day, he missed his connecting flight in Los Angeles because of a long screening process. The plaintiff flew domestically on three other instances in 2017 and each time the ticketing agent called the TSC and marked his boarding pass with the “SSSS” stamp. He filed this lawsuit on June 17, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, alleging constitutional violations. </p><p>In a final amended complaint filed November 2017, the plaintiff sued the Directors of the FBI and TSC, the Administrator of the TSA, and the Commissioner of the National Counterterrorism Center, all in their official capacities.</p><p>Represented by attorneys from the Council on American Islamic Relations and private counsel, the lawsuit sought injunctive and declaratory relief based on four main claims. First, the plaintiff argued that his placement on the Selectee List violated his Fifth Amendment rights to procedural and substantive due process. Second, he asserted that his inclusion on the selectee list was an unlawful agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. §§702, 706). Third, he argued that his inclusion on the watchlist violated his Fifth Amendment Right to equal protection. Fourth, he urged that the Executive branch’s implementation of the terrorist watchlist amounted to a violation of the Constitution’s non-delegation doctrine. </p><p>The Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and for lack of jurisdiction. In an order dated April 20, 2018, District Judge Dee Benson rejected the government’s jurisdictional arguments but granted its motion for failure to state a claim. For the procedural due process claim, Judge Benson found that the right to travel in a convenient or unimpeded fashion has not been recognized by the Supreme Court as a liberty interest protected by the Fifth Amendment and that the plaintiff failed to adequately allege reputational damage that satisfies a “stigma plus” standard. Judge Benson found the substantive due process claim unconvincing for similar reasons, writing that the plaintiff failed to provide case law supporting his contention that “freedom of movement” is protected by the Fifth Amendment. Likewise, because a constitutionally protected interest had not been identified by the plaintiff, the District Judge held that the APA claim similarly failed. For the equal protection claim, Judge Benson found that the plaintiff did not produce evidence of intentional discrimination against Muslims and refused to allow the claim to proceed on a disparate impact theory alone. Lastly, the non-delegation claim was dismissed because the Judge found that Congress charged the TSA with “overall responsibility for airline security” and that this is general policy establishes an “intelligible principle” that does not violate the doctrine of non-delegation. 2018 WL 1940411.</p><p>On appeal, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of all claims in an opinion by Circuit Judge David Ebel. 942 F. 3d 1019 (Nov. 12, 2019).</p>",

Abdi’s complaint \nasserts that, as a result of these alleged consequences, his placement on the Selectee \nList violates his Fifth Amendment rights to substantive and procedural due process and \nconsequently the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706.  Abdi seeks \ndeclarative and injunctive relief.  The district court dismissed Abdi’s complaint with \nprejudice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  For the reasons set forth \nbelow, we AFFIRM.   \nI.  BACKGROUND \nA. Factual Background \nThe relevant facts, as set out in Abdi’s First Amended Complaint, are as \nfollows.  Abdi is a United States citizen and resident of Salt Lake City, Utah.  Since \n2014, Abdi has experienced several delays and extended security screenings at \n2 \n\nairports, which has led him to believe that he is on the federal government’s \n“Selectee List,” a subset of the government’s Terrorist Screening Database \n(“TSDB”).  The TSDB is a master repository for suspected international and \ndomestic terrorist records.  The Terrorist Screening Center (“TSC”), which is \nadministered by the FBI, develops and maintains the TSDB.  The TSDB has two \nprimary components: the Selectee List and the No Fly List.  Persons on the No Fly \nList are prevented from boarding flights that intend to fly into, out of, or even \nthrough United States airspace.  By contrast, persons on the Selectee List are not \nbarred from flying but are systematically subject to extra screening at airports and \nland border crossings.  Abdi challenges his placement on the Selectee List. \nAbdi alleges that, since 2014, he has been subject to extended security \nscreenings each time he travels by air due to his placement on the Selectee List.  For \nexample, he is unable to check in for flights online or at the self-service kiosks at the \nairport.  Instead, he is directed to check in personally with an airline representative \nwho is required to obtain clearance from the Department of Homeland Security \nbefore he or she can give Abdi his boarding pass.  Abdi alleges that it takes about a \nhalf hour to obtain his boarding pass.  Once he does, the boarding pass is stamped \nwith an “SSSS” designation, which indicates that he is a “known or suspected \nterrorist.”  Compl. ¶ 30.  Then, at the airport security checkpoint, Abdi is routinely \nsubjected to secondary inspections, questioning, and prolonged searches of his person \nand luggage.  Sometimes, TSA agents shut down an entire screening line and require \n3 \n\nAbdi to proceed through the line by himself.  Finally, at the gate, Abdi is publicly \nsearched again by TSA agents before he is allowed to board his plane. \nIn addition to regularly experiencing these extra security screenings as a result \nof his placement on the Selectee List, Abdi alleges that, on one occasion, he was \nprevented from flying for several days because he was “upgraded” to the No Fly List.  \nCompl. ⁋ 40.  On June 14, 2017, Abdi appeared at an international airport in Nairobi, \nKenya, with his family, prepared to board a commercial flight back to the United \nStates.  Abdi was told by the ticketing agent that the United States would not allow \nhim to board his flight, although his wife and children were permitted to fly home.  \nTwo days later, on June 16, 2017, Abdi was allowed to fly back to the United States.  \nHowever, upon arriving at the Los Angeles International Airport’s port of entry, Abdi \nwas subjected to another lengthy screening that caused him to miss his connecting \nflight to Salt Lake City.  Abdi successfully flew home to Salt Lake City two days \nlater, on June 18. \nSince June 2017, Abdi has flown three times—twice domestically and once \ninternationally.  Each time, Abdi was permitted to fly, but he was subjected to the \nenhanced screening measures described above.  He has not missed any more flights \ndue to the length of his security screenings. \nFinally, Abdi alleges that, in addition to subjecting him to extra security \nscreenings, the defendant government officials have disseminated his status as a \n“known or suspected terrorist” to state and local authorities, foreign governments, \n4 \n\ncorporations, private contractors, airlines, gun sellers, car dealerships, financial \ninstitutions, among other official and private entities and individuals. Compl. ⁋ 57. \nB. Procedural History \nAbdi filed this lawsuit under the APA against the directors of the FBI, TSC, \nTSA, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and National Counterterrorism Center \n(“NCTC”), alleging that, by placing Abdi and other similarly situated American \ncitizens on the Selectee List, defendants violated his Fifth Amendment substantive \nand procedural due process rights.  Abdi requested a declaratory judgment that \ndefendants’ “policies, practices, and customs violate the Fifth Amendment” and an \ninjunction requiring defendants to remove him “from any watch list or database that \nburdens or prevents him from flying or entering the United States” and to notify all \nindividuals in the TSDB of “the reasons and bases for their placement” on the \ngovernment’s various watchlists and provide them with an opportunity to contest \ntheir continued inclusion.  Id. at 37–38.  To support his substantive due process \nclaim, Abdi alleged that the defendants’ decision to place him on the Selectee List \nunduly burdens his fundamental right of “movement” without a compelling \njustification.  The district court dismissed that claim by declining to recognize his \nasserted right of “movement” as a fundamental right.  To support his procedural due \nprocess claim, Abdi alleged that the defendants’ refusal to provide him with any \nnotice that he was placed on the Selectee List—placement that deprived him of his \nliberty interests in travel and reputation—violates the procedural due process clause.  \n5 \n\nThe district court dismissed that claim for failing plausibly to allege the deprivation \nof a constitutionally protected liberty interest. \nWe affirm the district court but on somewhat different grounds.  We affirm the \ndistrict court’s dismissal of Abdi’s substantive due process claim because, although \nAbdi’s rights to travel interstate and internationally are both potentially implicated by \nhis placement on the Selectee List, the government conduct alleged in the complaint \nhas not substantially interfered with either right.  Similarly, the district court’s \ndismissal of Abdi’s procedural due process claims was appropriate because Abdi has \nnot been deprived of either his liberty interest in travel or his reputation.   \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nWe review de novo the district court’s dismissal of Abdi’s claims under Rule \n12(b)(6).  “Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate only if the complaint, \nviewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, lacks enough facts to state a claim to \nrelief that is plausible on its face.”  United States ex rel. Reed v. KeyPoint Gov’t \nSolutions, 923 F.3d 729, 764 (10th Cir. 2019) (citations, internal quotation marks \nomitted).  “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content \nthat allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for \nthe misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  Importantly, \nalthough “a complaint need not provide ‘detailed factual allegations,’ it must give \njust enough factual detail to provide ‘fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the \ngrounds upon which it rests.’”  Warnick v. Cooley, 895 F.3d 746, 751 (10th Cir. \n2018) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)).  In deciding \n6 \n\nwhether the plaintiff has adequately stated a claim for relief, we view “the totality of \nthe circumstances as alleged in the complaint in the light most favorable to [the \nplaintiff],” Jones v. Hunt, 410 F.3d 1221, 1229 (10th Cir. 2005), accepting the \nplaintiff’s well-pled facts as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the non-\nmoving party’s favor, Sylvia v. Wisler, 875 F.3d 1307, 1313 (10th Cir. 2017).   \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nA. The complaint does not challenge Abdi’s placement on the No Fly List \n \nAbdi first argues that the district court erred by “ignoring” his “No Fly List \nclaims,” Aplt. Br. at 10.  Essentially, Abdi asserts that he adequately alleged a claim \nchallenging his placement on the No Fly List and that, even though his name has \nsince been removed from the No Fly List, that claim cannot be dismissed as moot \npursuant to the voluntary cessation doctrine because the government is free to place \nhim on the No Fly List again at any time.  We do not reach the question of mootness \nbecause the complaint failed to allege enough facts to place the defendants on notice \nthat Abdi was challenging his placement on the No Fly List.  Therefore, he waived \nthat argument, and the district court did not err in dismissing the complaint by \nignoring any supposed No Fly List claims. \nThe allegations in the complaint related to defendants’ wrongdoing can be \ncategorized into two groups.  First, the complaint includes allegations recounting the \ninconveniences that Abdi has experienced due to his placement on the Selectee List.  \nSee, e.g., Compl. ¶ 3 (“defendants’ rationale for placing Plaintiff Abdi on the \nSelectee List is arbitrary”), ¶ 4 (“The consequences of being on the Selectee List . . . \n7 \n\ninclude the burden of having to go through security with ticketing agents”), ¶ 27 \n(“Imam Abdi knows that he was on the Selectee List”), ¶ 49 (“Because the \ndefendants placed him on the Selectee List, [Abdi] could not print his boarding pass \nat a kiosk”), ¶ 57 (“because Imam Abdi is included on the federal terror watch list, \nand specifically the Selectee List, Defendants disseminated . . . his designation”), \n¶ 157 (“Defendants’ actions in nominating Plaintiff and other similarly situated \nAmerican citizens to the Selectee List blatantly violate [49 U.S.C. § 114(h)(3)]”).   \nSecond, the complaint includes allegations recounting the inconveniences that \nall people in the TSDB experience, regardless of whether their name appears on the \nNo Fly List or the Selectee List.  See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 61–65 (alleging that defendants \ndisseminate the names of everyone in the TSDB to government agencies and foreign \ngovernments), ¶ 68 (“Banks have closed the bank accounts of individuals listed on \nthe federal terror watch list”), ¶ 78 (“Being on the federal terror watch list can \nprevent listed persons . . . from purchasing a gun.”), ¶ 80 (TSDB listees can be \nprevented “from obtaining or renewing their Hazmat license”), ¶ 81 (TSDB listees \ncan be prevented “from working at an airport, or working for an airline”).  These \nalleged inconveniences apply to both people on the No Fly List and people on the \nSelectee List, and Abdi did not allege that he or anyone similarly situated \nexperienced any of these enumerated inconveniences because of their placement on \nthe No Fly List in particular.  Furthermore, Abdi did not allege that he in fact \nexperienced any of these inconveniences.  Instead, Abdi alleges only that he \n8 \n\npersonally has experienced various specific travel impediments because of his \ninclusion on the Selectee List.   \nThe complaint does allege that Abdi was placed on the No Fly List for a short \ntime.  In the facts section, the complaint states that Abdi was prevented from \nboarding a plane from Nairobi to the United States on one occasion on June 14, 2017, \nbecause he was “upgraded from the Selectee List to the No Fly List.”  Id. at ¶ 40.  \nHowever, the complaint then states that, two days later, Abdi was allowed to fly back \nto the United States and has since been allowed to fly.  Id. at ¶ 43–47.  Several dozen \nparagraphs later, the complaint alleges that defendants’ “have unduly deprived \nPlaintiff of constitutionally protected rights” by “including Plaintiff and other \nsimilarly situated American citizens on a watch list that unreasonably burdens or \nprevents them from boarding commercial flights.”  Id. at ¶ 156 (substantive due \nprocess claim).  At most, these allegations place the defendants on notice that Abdi \nwas challenging his temporary, forty-eight-hour placement on the No Fly List as \nhaving violated his constitutional rights.  The district court acknowledged that Abdi \nwas prevented from flying for forty-eight hours, Dist. Ct. Op. at 3 n.1, as do we in \nour analysis below.  However, Abdi’s complaint does not allege that he was \nprohibited from flying indefinitely due to his placement on the No Fly List or that he \nbelieved he would be prohibited from flying in the future under a voluntary cessation \ntheory.  Therefore, we reject Abdi’s contention that the district court overlooked any \nsuch claims, and we construe Abdi’s claims for relief to relate solely to his placement \non the Selectee List.     \n9 \n\nB. Abdi’s complaint failed to allege a plausible substantive due process claim \n \nAbdi argues that the district court erred in dismissing his substantive due \nprocess claim predicated upon his placement on the Selectee List.  Applying the \nfundamental-rights analysis from Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721–722 \n(1997), we affirm the district court’s dismissal of that claim because, although Abdi’s \nfundamental right to interstate travel and his right to international travel, whether \nfundamental or not, could potentially be implicated by placement on the Selectee \nList, the government conduct alleged in Abdi’s complaint has not violated those \nrights.  To reach that conclusion, we (1) identify the applicable law, (2) define the \nfundamental rights at issue, to the extent we need to do so, and (3) conclude that \nthose rights have not been infringed by the conduct alleged in the complaint.  \n1.  Applicable substantive due process analysis \n“Substantive due process bars ‘certain government actions regardless of the \nfairness of the procedures used to implement them.’”  Brown v. Montoya, 662 F.3d \n1152, 1172 (10th Cir. 2011) (quotation omitted).  It limits what the government may \ndo in both its legislative and executive capacities.  The Supreme Court has found \nsubstantive due process violations where government action has infringed a \n“fundamental” right without a “compelling” government purpose, Glucksberg, 521 \nU.S. at 721–722, as well as where government action deprives a person of life, \nliberty, or property in a manner so arbitrary it “shocks the conscience,” Cty. of \nSacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 846 (1998).  This court held in Halley v. \nHuckaby that “we apply the fundamental-rights approach when the plaintiff \n10 \n\nchallenges legislative action, and the shocks-the-conscience approach when the \nplaintiff seeks relief for tortious executive action,” 902 F.3d 1136, 1153 (10th Cir. \n2018).  Both Abdi and the government frame their substantive due process arguments \nin fundamental-rights terms, even though Abdi’s alleged harm stems from executive \nagency action rather than an Act of Congress.  For the following reasons, we agree \nthat the Glucksberg analysis governs the unique circumstances presented in this case. \nAbdi filed this lawsuit against the directors of the FBI, TSC, TSA, U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection, and NCTC, alleging that, “[b]y placing Plaintiff and \nother similarly situated American citizens on the federal terror watch list, Defendants \nhave placed an undue burden on their fundamental right of movement,” Compl. \n¶ 158, and seeking, in part, “[a] declaratory judgment that Defendants’ policies, \npractices, and customs violate the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution,” \nid. at 37.  Accordingly, Abdi does not challenge the tortious conduct of an individual \nagency officer, like the TSA agents that screen him, nor does he challenge legislative \naction, because the TSC, which develops and maintains the TSDB, was not created \nby Congress.  It was established by the Attorney General at the direction of the \nPresident through the issuance of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-6 \n(“HSPD-6”) on September 16, 2003, and it functions through the concerted efforts of \nseveral agency heads.  See Staff of H. Comm. on Homeland Sec., 110th Cong., \nCompilation of Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPD) (Updated \nThrough December 31, 2007) at 31 (Comm. Print 2008).   \n11 \n\nIn HSPD-6, the President mandated that the Attorney General “establish an \norganization to consolidate the Government’s approach to terrorism screening and \nprovide for the appropriate and lawful use of Terrorist Information in screening \nprocesses” and “implement appropriate procedures and safeguards with respect to all \nsuch information about United States persons” in “coordination with the Secretary of \nState, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of Central Intelligence,” \nall in an effort to “[t]o protect against terrorism.”  Id.  Thus, Abdi’s complaint, which \nchallenges his placement on the Selectee List, does not object to an independent, \n“specific act of a governmental officer,” Lewis, 523 U.S. at 846–49, which the \nSupreme Court has held should be analyzed under the shocks-the-conscience test, but \nto the concerted action of several agency employees, undertaken pursuant to broad \ngovernmental policies, that resulted in his name being included in the TSDB.  This \nchallenge is akin to a challenge to legislative action because, as with an act of a \nlawmaking body, the federal government here is attempting, through policy, to \nachieve a stated government purpose: to “protect against terrorism.”  Thus, it is most \nappropriate to analyze under the Glucksberg framework whether the defendants’ \nimplementation of the policies that govern their actions violates Abdi’s fundamental \nrights, and, if so, whether the policies are narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling \ngovernment purpose.1 \n                                              \n1 At least one other panel of this court has applied the fundamental-rights approach in \na case where, as here, a government entity’s implementation of its official policy is \nalleged to have caused a substantive due process violation.  Dawson v. Bd. of Cty. \nComm’rs, 732 F. App’x 624, 630 (10th Cir. 2018) (unpublished) (applying fundamental-\n12 \n\nSubstantive due-process analysis under Glucksberg proceeds in three steps.  \nFirst, the reviewing court must determine whether a fundamental right is at stake \neither because the Supreme Court or the Tenth Circuit has already determined that it \nexists or because the right claimed to have been infringed by the government is one \nthat is objectively among those “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” \nand “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty” such that it is “fundamental.”  \nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. at 720–21.  Second, the court must determine whether the \nclaimed right—fundamental or not—has been infringed through either total \nprohibition or “direct[] and substantial[]” interference.  Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. \n374, 387 (1978).  Third, if the right infringed is a fundamental right, the court must \ndetermine whether the government has met its burden to show that the law or \ngovernment action interfering with the right is narrowly tailored to achieve a \ncompelling government purpose.  Id. at 388.  If the right is not fundamental, we \napply rational basis review.  Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 305 (1993) (“[N]arrow \ntailoring is required only when fundamental rights are involved.”).  We agree with \nAbdi that both his fundamental right to interstate travel and his right to travel abroad, \nwhether fundamental or not, are at stake here (although we reject the novel “right of \nmovement” that Abdi asserts), but the government action he alleged in the complaint \nhas not substantially interfered with either right.  Thus, we need not and do not \nanalyze whether the government’s conduct passes the applicable level of scrutiny. \n                                              \nrights approach to assess the due process implications of a county jail’s pretrial detention \npolicies), cert. denied, Dawson v. Bd. of Cty. Comm’rs, 139 S. Ct. 862 (2019).   \n13 \n\n2.  Scope of the rights to travel interstate and internationally \nAbdi asserts that we are required by Glucksberg to examine this country’s \nhistorical foundational documents and international treaties anew to formulate the \ninterest at stake in this case and that, if we did, we would discover, rooted in our \nhistorical traditions, a “basic and far-reaching,” Aplt. Br. at 16., right of movement \nthat permits “movement between the states, as well as between this country and others,” \nAplt. Br. at 13.  However, the Supreme Court has already recognized the fundamental \nright to travel “throughout the United States,” Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 338 \n(1972), and has recognized a different right to travel “outside the United States,” \nHaig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 306 (1981) (“[T]he freedom to travel outside the United \nStates must be distinguished from the right to travel within the United States.”).  \nThrough several cases, the Court has defined the scope of these rights.  We are bound \nby the definitions established by those precedents, and, as a result, we cannot and do \nnot create a new, more expansive right to “movement” as Abdi suggests.  The \nSupreme Court has cautioned many times against creating new substantive due \nprocess rights.  See Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 720 (“[G]uideposts for responsible \ndecision[-]making in this unchartered area are scarce and open-ended.”); see also Moore \nv. City of E. Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 544 (1977) (White, J., dissenting) (“That the Court \nhas ample precedent for the creation of new constitutional rights should not lead it to \nrepeat the process at will.”).  Therefore, we rely on Supreme Court precedent to articulate \nthe rights to travel interstate and internationally that are at stake. \n14 \n\nAs for the right to travel interstate, the Supreme Court has held that the \n“[f]reedom to travel throughout the United States has long been recognized as a basic \nright under the Constitution,” Dunn, 405 U.S. at 338 (internal quotation omitted).  \nThe right protects, among other things, “the right of a citizen of one State to enter \nand to leave another State.”  Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489, 500 (1999).  Although the \ntextual source of the right has been the subject of some debate, the Supreme Court \nhas recognized that this right of “free ingress and regress to and from” neighboring \nStates was expressly mentioned in the Articles of Confederation and “may simply \nhave been ‘conceived from the beginning to be a necessary concomitant of the strong \nUnion the Constitution created.’”  Id. at 501 (citation omitted).   \nThe Supreme Court has distinguished between the right to travel interstate and \nthe right to travel internationally.  Whereas the “right of interstate travel is virtually \nunqualified,” the Court has stated that the right to travel abroad is an “aspect of the \n‘liberty’ protected by the Due Process Clause.”  Califano v. Torres, 435 U.S. 1, 4 n.6 \n(1978).  But the Supreme Court has also recognized that “[t]ravel abroad, like travel \nwithin the country, may be necessary for a livelihood . . . [and] may be as close to the \nheart of the individual as the choice of what he eats, or wears, or reads.”  Kent v. \nDulles, 357 U.S. 116, 126 (1958).  Because we conclude that Abdi’s placement on \nthe Selectee List does not infringe his interstate or international travel rights, we do \nnot need to determine here the scope of an individual’s right to international travel or \nthe applicable standard of review.   \n15 \n\nThe Supreme Court has made clear that the rights to interstate and \ninternational travel are not unlimited.  Although citizens have a right to travel \nthroughout the United States “uninhibited by statutes, rules, or regulations which \nunreasonably burden or restrict movement,” Saenz, 526 U.S. at 499 (emphasis \nadded), reasonable restrictions on the right to interstate travel are permissible.  For \nexample, when a “person has been convicted of a crime within a State[,] [h]e may be \ndetained within that State, and returned to it if he is found in another State.”  Jones v. \nHelms, 452 U.S 412, 419 (1981).  Other circuits have found impositions like gasoline \ntaxes and toll roads to be acceptable burdens on the right to travel interstate.  Kansas \nv. United States, 16 F.3d 436, 442 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  The Second Circuit has held that \nairport security that delays a traveler who checks a gun for “a little over one day” is \n“a minor restriction that d[oes] not result in a denial of the right to travel.”  Torraco \nv. Port Auth. of New York & New Jersey, 615 F.3d 129, 141 (2d Cir. 2010).  The \nNinth Circuit has also held that “burdens on a single mode of transportation do not \nimplicate the right to interstate travel.”  Miller v. Reed, 176 F.3d 1202, 1205 (9th Cir. \n1999).  In sum, government conduct that does not directly and substantially “impair \nthe exercise of the right to free interstate movement” does not amount to a \nconstitutional violation.  Saenz, 526 U.S. at 501.  \nLike the freedom to travel interstate, the freedom to travel abroad is “subject \nto reasonable government regulation.”  Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 306 (1981); see \nalso Kashem v. Barr, —F.3d—, 2019 WL 5303288, at *14 (9th Cir. Oct. 21, 2019).  \nFor example, in Haig, the Court held that the President could revoke the passport of a \n16 \n\nUnited States citizen if the passport-holder was engaging in activities abroad that \nwere likely to cause serious damage to the national security or the foreign policy of \nthe United States, such as divulging CIA secrets.  Haig, 453 U.S. at 282. \nOnly a few federal courts have considered whether placement on the Selectee \nList infringes a citizen’s rights to travel interstate or internationally.  In Beydoun v. \nSessions, 871 F.3d 459, 467 (6th Cir. 2017), the Sixth Circuit held that the plaintiff’s \nplacement on the Selectee List did not substantially interfere with his exercise of the \nright to travel interstate or internationally because the burdens that resulted from the \nplacement were “negligible or incidental.”  There, one plaintiff alleged that he had \nmissed “countless flights” after being subjected to lengthy secondary security \nscreenings and the delays deterred him from flying altogether.  Id.  A second plaintiff \nalleged that he had suffered delays of ten minutes and one hour and been deterred \nfrom flying once.  Id.  The Sixth Circuit held that “[w]hile Plaintiffs may have been \ninconvenienced by the extra security hurdles they endured in order to board an \nairplane, these burdens do not amount to a constitutional violation.”  Id. at 468.  The \nSixth Circuit also found that it was important that the plaintiffs had not been \nprevented from “flying altogether or from traveling by means other than an airplane” \nwhich distinguished its case from “those in which plaintiffs claimed they could not \nfly at all because they were on the No Fly List.”  Id.  In Mohamed v. Holder, a \nfederal district court held that the plaintiff’s allegation that he was prevented from \nboarding a plane from Kuwait to the United States due to his placement on the No \nFly List failed to state a claim that his constitutional right of reentry was violated \n17 \n\nbecause he was allowed to board a flight four days later.  995 F. Supp. 2d 520, 537 \n(E.D. Va. 2014).  The district court held that “the four to five-day delay that \nMohamed experienced . . . did not constitute a constitutional deprivation.”  Id.  Thus, \nUnited States citizens have a fundamental right to travel interstate and a right to \ntravel abroad, but neither is unlimited. \nHaving sufficiently defined the scope of the rights that are at stake, the final \nquestion before us is whether Abdi’s placement on the Selectee List substantially \ninterfered with those rights.  Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 388.   \n3.  Abdi’s placement on the Selectee List has not infringed his travel rights \n \nHere, Abdi asserts that his status as a listee “deprives his liberty interest in \ntravel—not because it absolutely prevents his ability to travel—but because it enacts \na substantial cost anytime he does choose to exercise that right.”  Aplt. Br. at 23.  \nHowever, as the district court found, the burdens and delays alleged by Abdi do not \nsubstantially interfere with his travel rights.  First, Abdi’s placement on the Selectee \nList affects only one mode of transportation throughout the country.  It places no \nrestrictions on Abdi’s ability to drive, bus, or otherwise commute interstate.  Second, \nwhen the government prevented Abdi from boarding his plane on June 14, 2017, he \nwas delayed for just two days before he was permitted to fly back to the United \nStates.  That delay is commensurate with the four-day delay in Mohamed and the \none-day delay in Torraco, both of which were upheld.  Third, the excessive security \nAbdi experiences is not unlike that of many air travelers.  Abdi has missed one flight \ndue to the length of his security screenings, but the Sixth Circuit upheld the use of \n18 \n\nsecurity screenings that caused the plaintiff in Beydoun to miss “countless flights.”  \n871 F.3d at 467.  Additionally, Abdi alleges that obtaining his boarding pass takes \nabout a half hour, but he does not indicate how long his screenings take in total.  \nAverage air travelers often spend more than one hour in TSA lines and sometimes \nmiss flights as a result of those delays.  Delays of a few hours are not uncommon for \nmany air travelers and do not amount to a substantial interference with the rights to \ntravel interstate or internationally.  Abdi has not alleged that his delays substantially \nexceed those experienced by many air travelers nor preclude his ability to travel. \nTherefore, we conclude that neither Abdi’s allegation that the government \nprevented him from boarding his plane in Nairobi nor his allegation that his \nplacement on the Selectee List subjects him to extra airport security states a \nsubstantive due process claim, because those impediments do not substantially \ninterfere with his ability to travel.  We affirm the district court’s dismissal of Abdi’s \nsubstantive due process claim. \nC. Abdi’s complaint failed to allege a plausible procedural due process claim \n \nAbdi also argues that the district court erred by dismissing his procedural due \nprocess claim.  The Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause forbids the federal \ngovernment from depriving any person “of life, liberty, or property, without due \nprocess of law.”  U.S. Const. amend. V.  “The requirements of procedural due process \napply only to the deprivations of interests encompassed by the [constitutional] protection \nof liberty and property.”  Al-Turki v. Tomsic, 926 F.3d 610, 614 (10th Cir. 2019).  \nTherefore, to state a procedural due process claim, a plaintiff must establish (1) the \n19 \n\ndeprivation of (2) a constitutionally cognizable liberty or property interest, (3) without \nadequate due process procedures.  Abdi asserts that he was deprived of two liberty \ninterests without due process.  First, Abdi contends that defendants prevented him \nfrom traveling free from unreasonable burdens when they placed him on the Selectee \nList.  Second, Abdi asserts under the stigma-plus doctrine that defendants deprived \nhim of his liberty interest in his reputation when they labeled him a “known or \nsuspected terrorist” on the Selectee List and when they disseminated that list to \npublic and private entities.  Abdi argues that both deprivations occurred in the \nabsence of any process, because the defendants did not notify him of either \noccurrence.2  The allegations in the complaint are insufficient to plausibly state a \nprocedural due process claim under either theory.    \n1.  Government has not deprived Abdi of his liberty interest in travel \nAssuming the rights to travel interstate and internationally are cognizable liberty \ninterests for purposes of procedural due process, Abdi was not deprived of those rights in \nthis case.  As explained above, the government may impose reasonable restrictions on \nboth a citizen’s right to travel throughout the United States and a citizen’s right to \ntravel internationally.  Neither the extra security measures that Abdi endured due to \n                                              \n2 Abdi stated at oral argument before the district court that he is not challenging the \nDepartment of Homeland Security Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (“DHS TRIP”), \na process that allows individuals who seek redress after having been included in the \nterrorist watch list to submit an inquiry about their listee status to DHS.  Dist. Ct. Op. \nat 4.  Abdi insisted instead that he challenges his placement on the watchlist in the \nfirst instance.  Id.  His brief to us emphasizes that it is only the government’s failure \nto notify him of his placement on the list that violates procedural due process.   \n \n20 \n\nhis placement on the Selectee List nor the forty-eight-hour delay he experienced \ntrying to fly home from Nairobi deprived him of a constitutional right; those \nimpediments merely reasonably encumbered his ability to travel interstate and \ninternationally and by only one mode of transportation.  We agree with the district \ncourt that the government’s conduct did not deprive Abdi of a liberty interest in \ntravel.3   \n \n2.  Government has not deprived Abdi of his liberty interest in reputation \nAbdi also alleges that the government defendants deprived him of his liberty \ninterest in his reputation without due process.  “Where a person’s good name, \nreputation, honor, or integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to \nhim, a protectable liberty interest may be implicated . . . .”  Martin Marietta \nMaterials, Inc. v. Kansas Dep’t of Transp., 810 F.3d 1161, 1184 (10th Cir. 2016) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  For a plaintiff to prevail on a \nreputation-based procedural due process claim, the plaintiff must satisfy the “stigma-\nplus” standard by demonstrating both “(1) governmental defamation and (2) an \n                                              \n3 A district court recently concluded that inclusion in the TSDB (but not as a listee on \nthe No Fly list) substantially interfered with the plaintiff’s rights to travel, resulting \nin the deprivation of a liberty interest.  See Elhady v. Kable, 391 F.Supp. 3d 562, \n571, 577-79 (E.D. Va. 2019).  In Elhady, the plaintiffs produced evidence of more \nsignificant travel obstacles than are at issue here—for example, being detained at \ngunpoint at a border check, handcuffed in public view, and interrogated for seven to \nten hours, on three separate occasions, see id. at 571-72—that actually deterred the \nplaintiffs from traveling at all, internationally or domestically, see id. at 577-79.  \nWithout expressing any views on the claims at issue in Elhady, we note that those \ncircumstances are distinguishable from the case we consider here.   \n21 \n\nalteration in legal status.”  Id. (citation omitted).  Even if Abdi’s complaint \nadequately pled governmental defamation, a conclusion we need not and do not \nreach, the complaint failed to allege facts that demonstrate the second element of the \nstigma-plus test, that he suffered a change in his legal status.   \nThe “plus factor” of the stigma-plus standard requires a plaintiff to allege that \nhe or she suffered the loss of a right or interest that has attained “constitutional status \nby virtue of the fact that [it was] initially recognized and protected by state law . . . \n[and] the State seeks to remove or significantly alter that protected status.”  Paul v. \nDavis, 424 U.S. 693, 710–11 (1976).  For example, in Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 \nU.S. 433, 434 (1971), a Wisconsin statute allowed local police to forbid the sale of liquor \nto any person that drinks alcohol excessively and as a result “misspend[s], waste[s] or \nlessen[s] his estate” or disturbs the peace.  Id. at 445.  The chief of police of Hartford, \nWisconsin, without notice or hearing to Norma Grace Constantineau, posted a notice in \nall retail liquor outlets that sales or gifts of liquor to Constantineau were forbidden for \none year.  The Supreme Court held that the statute violated Constantineau’s procedural \ndue process rights because—as the Court later explained in Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, \n708–09 (1976)—she was given no process by which to challenge the accusations that \nboth damaged her reputation and prevented her from engaging in an activity that is \notherwise allowed under state law, namely, purchasing alcohol.  Similarly, in Davis, 424 \nU.S. at 695, a local police chief distributed a list of “active shoplifters” that included \nEdward Charles Davis’s name and photo to local merchants without giving Davis notice \nor an opportunity to contest the accusations.  However, unlike the flyer in Constantineau \n22 \n\nthat prohibited merchants from selling liquor to Norma Grace, the flyer in Davis merely \ndefamed Davis, without mandating that any merchant refuse him service.  Id. at 707–09. \nThe Supreme Court held that the state’s “defamatory publications, however seriously \nthey may have harmed [Davis’s] reputation, did not deprive him of any ‘liberty’ or \n‘property’ interests protected by the Due Process Clause” because the defamation did not \n“alter[] or extinguish[]” a “right or status previously recognized by state law.”  Id. at 711-\n12. \nHere, Abdi’s Complaint asserts that the government violated his procedural \ndue process rights when it placed him on the Selectee list without notice, which \nimposed on him the stigmatizing label of “known or suspected terrorist” and then \n“disseminated the stigmatizing label . . . to state and local authorities, foreign \ngovernments, private corporations, private contractors, airlines, gun sellers, car \ndealerships, financial institutions, the captains of sea-faring vessels, among other \nofficial and private entities and individuals.”  Compl. ¶¶ 152–53.  The complaint \nalleges that, as a result of the wide dissemination of that stigmatizing label, Abdi \ncould, potentially, be prohibited from: \n1.  Accessing the financial system, \n2.  Opening or maintaining bank accounts, \n3.  Making wire transfers, \n4.  Sponsoring the permanent residency of immediate relatives, \n5.  Entering other nations,  \n6.  Purchasing a gun,  \n7.  Obtaining a commercial drivers’ license to transport hazardous \nmaterial, \n8.  Obtaining or renewing a Hazmat license,  \n9.  Working for an airport or an airline, or  \n10. Obtaining an FAA license.  \n23 \n\n \nId. at ¶¶ 67–83.  Abdi also alleges that his family’s visas were processed differently \nbecause of his placement on the Selectee List.  Id. at ¶ 36.    \n  The allegations in support of Abdi’s stigma-plus argument suffer from two \ninfirmities.  First, Abdi failed to specifically allege that he has actually been \nprevented from participating in any of the above activities.  His allegations are \nentirely speculative.  For example, he alleges that placement on the terrorist watchlist \n“can prevent listed persons . . . from purchasing a gun,” id. at ¶ 78 (emphasis added), \n“can prevent listed persons . . . from obtaining or renewing their Hazmat license,” id. \nat ¶ 80 (emphasis added), and “can also prevent listed persons . . . from working at an \nairport,” id. at ¶ 81 (emphasis added).  Abdi’s brief to us likewise argues, in the \nfuture tense, that local police “may” pull him over without reasonable suspicion due \nto his listee status and that, if he attempted to buy a gun in certain states, he “would \nbe” unable to do so.  Aplt. Br. at 25.  Furthermore, Abdi’s family’s alleged \nexperience with the United States visa system is not his own. \nSecond, Abdi failed to allege that, in addition to distributing the list of “known \nof suspected” terrorists on which his name appears, the government mandates that the \nprivate and public entities in receipt of the list refuse to offer service or employment \nto the listed individuals, as in Constantineau.  Abdi alleges that the government \ndisseminates the watchlist “with the purpose and hope” that the entities and individuals \n24 \n\nthat receive it “will impose consequences on those individuals.”  Compl. ¶ 66.  But a \n“purpose and hope” is not a mandate.4   \nFor these reasons, Abdi has failed to allege that he was actually deprived of \nany right conferred by state or federal law because of his status on the Selectee List.  \nAccordingly, we affirm the district court’s dismissal of Abdi’s procedural due \nprocess claim. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s dismissal of Abdi’s \ncomplaint with prejudice.  \n \n \n \n                                              \n4 The district court in Elhady held that being on the TSDB deprived the plaintiffs of \ntheir reputational interest but, in reaching that conclusion, did not address \nConstantineau’s requirement that the challenged government conduct must mandate \nothers’ action against the plaintiffs.

(“Council on American-Islamic Relations” or “CAIR”) and \nParker & McConkie, states as follows: \nIntroduction \n1.  Through  its  No  Fly  List,  the  federal  government  is  preventing  an \nAmerican citizen who is in Kenya now from returning to Utah where he lives.   \n2.  To make matters worse, by preventing this citizen—who is a religious \nleader of his community—from flying back to the United States, the Defendants are \npreventing him from providing religious services to Muslims in Utah during the holy \nmonth of Ramadan.  \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 3 of 225\n3.  These injuries are attributable to the Defendants systematically compiling \na terrorist watch list, inventing consequences to inflict on listees, and disseminating this \nlist to anyone willing to receive it. \n4.  It is why there is no exaggeration in stating that our federal government is \nimposing an injustice of historic proportions upon people such as Plaintiff Yusuf Awadir \nAbdi —who has not been arrested, charged, or convicted of any type of terrorism-related \noffense—as well as thousands of other Americans.  Through extra-judicial and secret \nmeans, the federal government is ensnaring innocent Americans into an invisible web of \nconsequences  that  are  imposed  indefinitely  and  without  recourse  because  of  the \nshockingly large federal terror watch list that now includes hundreds of thousands of \nindividuals. \n5.  Indeed, many Americans, including children, end up on this secret federal \nterror watch list – which the Defendants have named the Terrorist Screening Database \n(“TSDB”) – based on mere guesses, hunches, and conjecture, and even simply based on \nmatters of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion or the exercise of their constitutional \nrights. \n6.  These consequences include the inability to fly on airplanes, to go through \nsecurity without having all screeners receive a message for the remainder of a listee’s life \nthat he or she is a \"known or suspected terrorist,\" to obtain licenses, to exercise their \nSecond  Amendment  right  to  own  a  firearm,  and  to  be  free  from  the  unimaginable \nindignity  and real-life danger of having their own government communicate to hundreds \nof thousands of federal agents, private contractors, businesses, state and local police, the \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 4 of 225\ncaptains of sea-faring vessels, and foreign governments all across the world that they are \na violent menace. \n7.  And unfortunately, the federal government has designed its No Fly List to \nbe accountability-free.  Persons placed on the federal terror watch list have no means of \nchallenging the constitutionality of their listing.  Indeed, people on the federal terror \nwatch  lists  only  learn  of  their  placement  when  they  feel  the  web  of  consequences \nburdening their lives and aspirations, and they never learn the circumstances that led to \ntheir listing. \n8.  Media accounts have made clear that the secret federal terror watch list is \nthe product of bigotry and misguided, counterproductive zeal.  Americans are dumped \nonto the watch list without being charged, convicted, or in some stomach-churning cases, \neven subject to an ongoing investigation.   \n9.  Instead, two leaked government documents and a governmental report, \nwhich include the March 2013 Watchlisting Guidance (Exhibit 2), the Directorate of \nTerrorist  Identities  (DTI):  Strategic  Accomplishments  2013  (Exhibit  3),  and  the \nDepartment  of  Justice's  March  2014  Audit  of  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation's \nManagement  of  Terrorist  Watchlist  (Exhibit  4)  reveal  that  the  care  the  federal \ngovernment takes in creating its federal terror watch list is void of proper processing, \nwhich in turn results in life-altering consequences that flow from these illegal actions. \n10.  In fact, upon information and belief, Dearborn, a city of less than 100,000 \nand a place Arab Americans and Muslim Americans have called home for generations, \ncontains the second highest concentration of Americans on the federal government's \nwatch list.  Moreover, there have been more than 1.5 million nominations to the federal \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 5 of 225\nterror watch list since 2009 and that, in 2013 for example, the Terrorist Screening Center \nconverted 98.96 percent of those nominations into watch list placements. \n11.  Upon  information  and  belief,  evidence  also  shows  that  the  federal \ngovernment uses guilt-by-association presumptions to place family members and friends \nof listed persons on the watch list.   \n12.  Moreover,  travel  to  Muslim  majority  countries—travel  that  American \nMuslims are very likely to engage in—is also a basis for watch list placement.   \n13.  In 2009, the federal government made 227,932 nominations to its federal \nterror watch list.  In 2013, that number more than doubled at an alarming and dangerous \nrate to 468,749.   \n14.  Recently, a federal court judge observed in Gulet Mohamed v. Eric R. \nHolder, Jr., et al. (United States District Court, Eastern District of Virginia, Case No. 11-\ncv-00050 (2011)), that “[a] showing of past or ongoing unlawful conduct does not seem \nto be required,… But the Court has little, if any, ability to articulate what information is \nviewed by TSC as sufficiently ‘derogatory’ beyond the labels it has provided the Court.  \nIn sum, the No Fly List assumes that there are some American citizens who are simply \ntoo dangerous to be permitted to fly, no matter the level of pre-flight screening or on-\nflight surveillance and restraint, even though those citizens cannot be legally arrested, \ndetained, or otherwise restricted in their movements or conduct.”  See United States \nDistrict Court, Eastern District of Virginia, Case No. 11-cv-00050 (2011); Dkt. 70 at 19; \nattached as Memorandum Opinion (Exhibit 1). \n15.  Moreover, the Court went on to find that “[i]nclusion on the No Fly List \nalso labels an American citizen a disloyal American who is capable of, and disposed \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 6 of 225\ntoward  committing,  war  crimes,  and  one  can  easily  imagine  the  broad  range  of \nconsequences that might be visited upon such a person if that stigmatizing designation \nwere known by the general public… The process of nomination to the No Fly List is \nbased on a suspected level of future dangerousness that is not necessarily related to any \nunlawful conduct.”  See United States District Court, Eastern District of Virginia, Case \nNo. 11-cv-00050 (2011); Dkt. 70 at 14, 17; attached as Memorandum Opinion (Exhibit \n1). \nParties \n16.  Plaintiff Yusuf Awadir Abdi is a United States Citizen and a Muslim \nresiding in Salt Lake County, Utah.   \n17.  Defendant  Andrew  McCabe  is  the  Director  of  the  Federal  Bureau  of \nInvestigation (“FBI”).  Defendant McCabe is responsible for the nominations of Plaintiff \nand other similarly situated American citizens to the federal terror watch list.  Defendant \nMcCabe is being sued in his official capacity, only. \n18.  Defendant  Christopher  M.  Piehota  is  the  Director  of  the  Terrorist \nScreening Center (“TSC”).  Defendant Piehota was appointed in April, 2013.  Defendant \nPiehota  develops  and  maintains  the  federal  government’s  consolidated  Terrorism \nScreening Database (the “watch list”), and accepted the nominations of Plaintiff and \nother similarly situated American citizens to the federal terror watch list.  Defendant \nPiehota also oversees the dissemination of the stigmatizing label attached to Plaintiff and \nother similarly situated American citizens of “known or suspected terrorists” to state and \nlocal authorities, foreign governments, corporations, private contractors, airlines, gun \nsellers, car dealerships, financial institutions, the captains of sea-faring vessels, among \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 7 of 225\nother official and private entities and individuals.  Defendant Piehota is being sued in his \nofficial capacity, only. \n19.  Defendant  Huban  A.  Gowadia  is  Acting  Administrator  of  the \nTransportation  Security  Administration  (“TSA”).    Defendant  Gowadia  oversaw  the \ndissemination of the stigmatizing label attached to Plaintiff and other similarly situated \nAmerican  citizens  of  “known  or  suspected  terrorists”  to  state  and  local  authorities, \nforeign  governments,  corporations,  private  contractors,  airlines,  gun  sellers,  car \ndealerships, financial institutions, the captains of sea-faring vessels, among other official \nand private entities and individuals.  Defendant Gowadia is being sued in his official \ncapacity, only. \n20.  Defendant Kevin K. McCaleenan is Acting Commissioner of the National \nCounterterrorism  Center  (“NCTC”).    Defendant  McCaleena  is  responsible  for  the \nnominations  that  resulted  in  the  placement  of  Plaintiff  and  other  similarly  situated \nAmerican citizens on the federal terror watch list.  Defendant McCaleenan is being sued \nin his official capacity, only. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n21.  Under U.S. Const. Art. III §2, this Court has jurisdiction because the rights \nsought to be protected herein are secured by the United States Constitution.  Jurisdiction \nis proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal \nBureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), et seq., 5 U.S.C. § 702, 5 U.S.C. § 706, the \nUnited States Constitution, and federal common law. \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 8 of 225\n22.  This action seeks declaratory relief pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment \nAct, 28 U.S.C. § § 2201-02, Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and \npursuant to the general, legal, and equitable powers of this Court. \n23.  A substantial part of the unlawful acts alleged herein were committed \nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Utah. \n24.  Venue is proper under 42 U.S.C. § 1391(e) as to all Defendants because \nDefendants are officers or employees of agencies of the United States sued in their \nofficial capacities and because this judicial district is where Plaintiff resides and where a \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred.   \nFactual Background \nPlaintiff Yussuf Awadir Abdi’s Inability to Return to the United States \n25.  Plaintiff Yussuf Awadir Abdi (hereinafter “Imam Abdi”) is a Muslim \nreligious leader and Imam of Madina Masjid Mosque in Salt Lake City, Utah. \n26.  Some time in 2014, the federal government placed Imam Abdi on the \nSelectee List component of the federal terror watch list, having secretly concluded that \nofficials had a “reasonable suspicion” that Imam Abdi was “associated with terrorism.”  \nSee Exhibit 2. \n27.  Imam  Abdi  knows  that  he  was  on  the  Selectee  List  because,  for \napproximately the last three years, every time he travels by air, he is unable to check in to \nhis flights online or at the kiosks stationed at the airports. \n28.  Rather, he is directed to check in manually with an airline representative \nin order to print his boarding pass. \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 9 of 225\n29.  The airline representative, after pulling up his name on the  computer \nsystem, would contact the Department of Homeland Security in order to obtain clearance \nso that he could fly. \n30.  Once clearance from the Department of Homeland Security is obtained, \nthe airline representative would then print his boarding pass, which would be stamped \nwith the “SSSS” designation, indicating that he has been designated as a “known or \nsuspected terrorist.”  \n31.  Imam  Abdi  was  then  subjected  to  routine  secondary  inspections, \nprolonged searches and questioning every time he traveled by air. \n32.  Imam Abdi filed a redress request through DHS TRIP some time in 2016. \n33.  On May 22, 2017, Imam Abdi received a letter as described in paragraph \n133 below and was assigned a Redress Control Number.  While that letter contained \nmany words, it provided no information—not notice of his placement nor some means by \nwhich to challenge his designation—about Imam Abdi’s status as a listee.   \n34.  On June 14, 2017, Imam Abdi appeared at Jomo Kenyatta International \nAirport in Nairobi, Kenya to board a commercial flight back to his home in the United \nStates. \n35.  Because his visa petitions that he filed for his wife and two of his children \nhad just been approved, Imam Abdi had traveled to Kenya to bring his wife and five \nchildren with him to the United States.  His remaining three children are United States \nCitizens. \n36.  Imam Abdi tried to check in at a kiosk stationed at the airport, however, he \nwas directed to an airline representative to manually check him in for his flight. \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 10 of 225\n37.  Imam Abdi then presented himself at the Qatar Airlines ticket counter. \n38.  Although his wife and children were able to print their boarding passes, \nthe Qatar Airlines representative told Imam Abdi that the United States would not allow \nhim to board his flight in order to return to his home in the United States. \n39.  The following day, on June 15, 2017, Imam Abdi appeared at the United \nStates  Embassy  in  Nairobi,  Kenya  to  obtain  information  as  to  why  he  was  denied \nboarding and being prevented from returning to his home in the United States. \n40.  However,  the  United  States  Embassy  did  not  provide  him  with  any \ninformation. \n41.  Imam Abdi rescheduled his flight to the United States to leave later this \nevening on this date, June 16, 2017. \n42.  Upon information and belief, Imam Abdi was upgraded from the Selectee \nList to the No Fly List after he arrived in Kenya. \n43.  As a result, he was extrajudicially exiled from his country of citizenship, \nthe United States. \n44.  Moreover, in the event that Imam Abdi is not removed from the No Fly \nList, he will be unable to board his flight rescheduled for tonight back home to the United \nStates. \n45.  As a result of being denied boarding, Imam Abdi was unable to return \nhome in time for the last ten nights of the holy month of Ramadan, the most important \nand blessed nights of Ramadan, when he is expected to lead prayers throughout each \nnight at his mosque.  The last ten nights of Ramadan began on the night of June 15, 2017. \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 11 of 225\n46.  Ramadan  is  a  holy  month  of  spirituality  and  devotion  observed  by \nMuslims worldwide, whereby Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset. \n47.  Moreover,  Imam  Abdi  is  designated  to  lead  a  group  of  Muslims  to \nperform the Hajj, or religious pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, which is scheduled to begin on \nAugust 30, 2017. \n48.  In the event Imam Abdi is not removed from the No Fly List, he will be \nunable to travel to Saudi Arabia to perform the Hajj, nor will he be able to lead the group \nthat he is scheduled to lead. \n49.  At no time was  Imam  Abdi  given notice of the factual basis for his \nplacement on the federal terror watch list, and at no time was he offered a meaningful \nopportunity to contest his designation. \n50.  Moreover, at no time was Imam Abdi given notice of the deprivation of \nhis liberty interests or violation of his constitutional rights. \n51.  Upon information and belief, Imam Abdi’s nomination to and designation \non the federal terror watch list was made based solely upon a hunch (based upon his race, \nethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, guilt-by-association, or First Amendment \nprotected activities). \n52.  Upon  information  and  belief,  because  Imam  Abdi  is  included  on  the \nfederal terror watch list, and specifically the No Fly List, Defendants disseminated and \nare continuing to disseminate his designation as a “known or suspected terrorist” to state \nand local authorities (including the local police officers above), foreign governments, \ncorporations,  private  contractors,  airlines,  gun  sellers,  car  dealerships,  financial \ninstitutions, among other official and private entities and individuals. \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 12 of 225\n53.  Upon information and belief, because Imam Abdi is still included on the \nNo Fly List, he remains unable to board a flight and return to his home in the United \nStates. \nThe Federal Government’s Terrorist Watch List \n54.  In  September,  2003,  Attorney  General  John  Ashcroft  established  the \nTerrorist  Screening  Center  (“TSC”)  to  consolidate  the  government’s  approach  to \nterrorism screening.  The TSC, which is administered by the FBI, develops and maintains \nthe federal government’s consolidated Terrorism Screening Database (the “watch list”).  \nTSC’s consolidated watch list is the federal government’s master repository for suspected \ninternational and domestic terrorist records used for watch list related screening. \n55.  The watch list has two primary components: the Selectee List and the No \nFly List.  Persons on the Selectee List are systematically subject to extra screening at \nairports  and land  border crossings,  and often find  “SSSS” on their boarding passes \nprinted by airline employees which is marked to indicate a passenger’s watch list status to \nairline employees and screeners.  Persons on the No Fly List, including Plaintiff, are \nprevented from boarding flights that fly into, out of, or even through United States \nairspace. \n56.  Defendant TSC disseminates records from its terrorist watch list to other \ngovernment agencies that in turn use those records to identify suspected terrorists.  For \nexample, applicable TSC records are provided to TSA for use by airlines in pre-screening \npassengers and to CBP for use in screening travelers entering the United States by land.   \n57.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  disseminated  the  records  of \nPlaintiff from their terrorist watch list to other government agencies, including Defendant \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 13 of 225\nTSA  for  use  by  airlines  in  pre-screening  Plaintiff,  and  Defendant  CBP  for  use  in \nscreening Plaintiff upon entering the United States. \n58.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  disseminated  the  records \npertaining to Plaintiff from their terrorist watch list to foreign governments with the \npurpose and hope that those foreign governments will constrain the movement of Plaintiff \nin some manner.   \n59.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants’  intention  in  disseminating \nwatch list records, including those of Plaintiff and similarly situated American citizens, as \nwidely as possible is to constrain their movements, not only within the United States, but \nabroad as well.  For example, some countries detain individuals listed on the federal \nterror watch list who enter their borders, question those individuals at the behest of \nUnited States officials, or altogether prevent those individuals from even entering those \ncountries.   \n60.  Thus, while the TSC maintains and controls the database of suspected \nterrorists, it is the front-line agencies like the TSA that carry out the screening function.  \nIn the context of air travel, when individuals make airline reservations and check in at \nairports, the front-line screening agency, like TSA and CBP, conducts a name-based \nsearch of the individual, including that of Plaintiff, to determine whether he or she is on a \nwatch list. \n61.  While  agencies  throughout  the  federal  government  utilize  the  federal \nterror watch list to conduct screening, listed persons are subject to a comprehensive \nportfolio of consequences that cover large aspects of their lives.   \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 14 of 225\n62.  Indeed,  Defendants  disseminated  the  federal  terror  watch  list  to \ngovernment authorities, private corporations and individuals with the purpose and hope \nthat  these  entities  and/or  individuals  will  impose  consequences  on  those  individuals \nDefendants have listed, including Plaintiff. \n63.  Upon information and belief, the status of Plaintiff and similarly situated \nAmerican  citizens  as  known  or  suspected  terrorists  on  the  federal  terror  watch  list \ndiminishes and even imperils their ability to access the financial system.   \n64.  Banks have closed the bank accounts of individuals listed on the federal \nterror watch list and financial companies have declined to allow some listed individuals \nto make wire transfers. \n65.  Moreover,  upon  information  and  belief,  family-based  immigration \napplications  filed  by  Plaintiff  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens  are  delayed \nindefinitely due to an “FBI name check” and not adjudicated, thereby denying Plaintiff \nand  similarly  situated  American  citizens  of  the  rights  that  flow  from  citizenship, \nincluding the ability to sponsor for lawful permanent residency immediate relatives living \nabroad. \n66.  Among  the  entities  and  individuals  that  the  federal  government \ndisseminates  its  federal  terror  watch  list  are  state  and  local  authorities,  foreign \ngovernments,  corporations,  private  contractors,  airlines,  gun  sellers,  car  dealerships, \nfinancial institutions, the captains of sea-faring vessels, among others. \n67.  In fact, in 2015, Defendant Piehota, Director of the Terrorist Screening \nCenter, gave an exclusive interview to CNN and stated the following, in relevant part: \nIt's concerning that our partners don't use all of our data. \nWe  provide  them  with  tools.  We  provide  them  with \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 15 of 225\nsupport, and I would find it concerning that they don't use \nthese tools to help screen for their own aviation security, \nmaritime security, border screening, visas, things like that \nfor travel.1 \n \n68.  Defendant Piehota went on to state that the United States shares its federal \nterror watch list with the European Union, but that European Union countries do not \nsystematically utilize it to identify suspected terrorists or screen migrants coming. \n69.  Upon information and belief, because the names of Plaintiff and similarly \nsituated American citizens are included on the federal terror watch list, their names were \ndisseminated to state and local authorities, foreign governments, corporations, private \ncontractors, airlines, gun sellers, car dealerships, financial institutions, the captains of \nsea-faring vessels, among other official and private entities and individuals. \n70.  Because the federal government disseminates its federal terror watch list \nto  foreign  governments,  listed  persons,  including  Plaintiff  and  similarly  situated \nAmerican citizens, are often not allowed to enter other nations.  This is because the \nUnited  States  is  telling  other  nations,  without  any  modicum  of  due  process,  that \nthousands of its own citizens are “known or suspected terrorists.”   \n71.  The  federal  government,  through  Defendants,  disseminates  its  federal \nterror watch list to state and local police officers which allows those officers to query the \nnames of persons, including Plaintiff, if for example, the listed individual is pulled over \nfor routine traffic violations.   \n72.  Disseminating the federal terror watch list to state and local police officers \ncreates a dangerous situation insofar as the federal terror watch list effectively directs \n                                                           \n1 First on CNN: Top U.S. intel official: Europe not taking advantage of terror tracking tools, CNN, available \nat: http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/07/politics/christopher-piehota-us-intel-europe-terror-tracking/ \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 16 of 225\nstate and local officers to treat thousands of Americans, including Plaintiff, charged or \nconvicted with no crime yet listed as a “known or suspected terrorist” as extremely \ndangerous.   \n73.  With the advent and deployment of automatic license plate readers by \npolice departments across the country, local and state authorities have relied heavily upon \na driver’s watch list status as the basis of a traffic stop, including Plaintiff and similarly \nsituated American citizens. \n74.  Being on the federal terror watch list can prevent listed persons, including \nPlaintiff and similarly situated American citizens, from purchasing a gun.  For example, \nNew Jersey passed a law in 2013 that banned persons on the federal terror watch list from \nowning guns.   \n75.  Accordingly, Plaintiff and similarly situated American citizens are unable \nto purchase guns in states that ban persons on the federal terror watch list from owning \nguns. \n76.  Because the federal government conducts a security risk assessment that \nincludes querying the federal terror watch list prior to issuing a license to commercial \ndrivers to transport hazardous materials, being on the federal terror watch list can prevent \nlisted  persons,  including  Plaintiff  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  from \nobtaining or renewing their Hazmat license.   \n77.  Being on the federal terror watch list can also prevent listed persons, \nincluding Plaintiff and similarly situated American citizens, from accompanying minors \nor passengers with disabilities to their gate, from working at an airport, or working for an \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 17 of 225\nairline insofar as listed persons are not allowed to enter so-called “sterile areas” of \nairports. \n78.  Being on the federal terror watch list can also result in the listing of the \nfalse stigmatizing label of “known or suspected” terrorist on the criminal records of \nPlaintiff and similarly situated American citizens, information that is publicly accessible \nto the general public. \n79.  Being on the federal terror watch list can also result in the denial or \nrevocation of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) license of Plaintiff and similarly \nsituated American citizens. \n80.  Although TSA, CBP, and other agencies may use the records provided by \nthe TSC, it is the TSC that maintains and controls the database of suspected terrorists. \n81.  Two  government  entities  are  primarily  responsible  for  “nominating” \nindividuals for inclusion in the terrorist watch list—Defendants NCTC and FBI.  The \nNCTC, which is managed by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, relies on \ninformation from other federal departments and agencies when including alleged known \nor  suspected  international  terrorists  in  its  Terrorist  Identities  Datamart  Environment \n(“TIDE”) database.  The NCTC reviews TIDE entries and recommends specific entries to \nthe TSC for inclusion in the watch list.  TIDE is the main source of all international \nterrorist information included in the watch list. \n82.  Defendant FBI, in turn, nominates to the watch list individuals with what \nit characterizes as suspected ties to domestic terrorism.   \n83.  Defendant  TSC  makes  the  final  decision  on  whether  a  nominated \nindividual meets the minimum requirements for inclusion into the watch list as a known \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 18 of 225\nor  suspected  terrorist.    TSC  also  decides  which  screening  systems  will  receive  the \ninformation about that individual. \n84.  Former Director of the Terrorism Screening Center Healy has testified that \nin evaluating whether an individual meets the criteria for inclusion on the consolidated \nwatch  list,  the  TSC  determines  whether  the  nominated  individual  is  “reasonably \nsuspected” of having possible links to terrorism.  According to the TSC, “reasonable \nsuspicion  requires  articulable  facts  which,  taken  together  with  rational  inferences, \nreasonably warrant the determination that an individual is known or suspected to be or \nhas been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in and of or related to \nterrorism and terrorist activities.”   \n85.  Defendants have not stated publicly what standards or criteria are applied \nto determine whether an American citizen on the consolidated watch list will be placed \non the No Fly List, Selectee List (“SSSS”) or other list that is distributed to the TSA, \nCBP or other screening agencies.   \n86.  The standards for watch list inclusion do not evince even internal logic.  \nDefendants define a “suspected terrorist” as an “individual who is reasonably suspected \nto be, or have been, engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or \nrelated to terrorism and terrorist activities based on articulable and reasonable suspicion.”  \nIn other words, Defendants place American citizens on the federal terror watch list based \nupon  a  “reasonable  suspicion”  that  they  are  “reasonably  suspected”  of  nefarious \nactivities.  This “reasonable suspicion” based on a “reasonable suspicion” standard does \nnot even contain internal logic.   \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 19 of 225\n87.  The federal government utilizes guilt-by-association as a basis for watch \nlist inclusion.  For example, the immediate relative of listed persons can be listed without \nany  derogatory  information—other  than  the  bonds  of  family.    Nonetheless,  such \ndesignation suggests that the immediate relative is him or herself engaged in nefarious \nactivities.   \n88.  Being a known associate—a friend, colleague, fellow community member, \netc.—of a listed individual can also provide a basis for watch list inclusion.   \n89.  Even if an American citizen is acquitted of terrorism charges or those \ncharges are otherwise dismissed, the federal government retains for itself the authority to \ncontinue to include them in the watch list.   \n90.  For  reasons  unknown,  Defendants  also  place  what  they  call  “non-\ninvestigatory subjects” on the federal terror watch list, American citizens that they have \nchosen not to investigate. \n91.  Under  these  practices  and  standards,  the  number  of  records  in  the \nconsolidated watch list has swelled.  Over 1.5 million nominations to the watch list have \nbeen submitted by federal agencies since fiscal 2009. \n92.  In 2013, Defendant TSC accepted 98.96 percent of all nominations made. \n93.  Because of these loose standards and practices, the federal terror watch \nlist’s rate of growth has increased.  In fiscal 2009, there were 227,932 nominations to the \nwatch list.  In fiscal 2013, there were 468,749 nominations.   \n94.  Upon information  and  belief, in  2001, there  were 16 people who the \nfederal government systematically prevented from flying.  In 2013, that number increased \nto 47,000. \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 20 of 225\n95.  Once an American citizen has been placed on the watch list, the individual \nremains on the list until the agency that supplied the initial information in support of the \nnomination determines the individual should be removed. \n96.  A  2007  GAO  report  found  that  TSC  rejects  only  approximately  one \npercent of all nominations to the watch list.2  As such, the watch list is growing at a rate \nof approximately 20,000 entries per year. \n97.  At  a  March  10,  2010  Senate  Homeland  Security  Committee  hearing, \nRussel E. Travers, Deputy Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, stated that \n“[t]he entire federal government is leaning very far forward on putting people on list,” \nand that the watch list is “getting bigger, and it will get even bigger.” \n98.  The federal terror watch list disproportionately targets American Muslims. \n99.  Almost all publicly known instances of Americans being placed on the \nwatch list regard Muslims or persons who could be mistaken for Muslims.   \n100.  Defendants have utilized the watch list, not as a tool to enhance aviation \nand border security, but as a bludgeon to coerce American Muslims into becoming \ninformants or forgoing the exercise of their rights, such as the right to have an attorney \npresent during law enforcement questioning. \n101.  Public examples of this phenomenon abound.  See Latif v. Holder, 2014 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 85450, *19 (D. Or. June 24, 2014) (an FBI agent told Steven Washburn \nthat he “would help remove Washburn's name from the No Fly List if he agreed to speak \nto the FBI”); Id. at *21-22 (FBI agents told Ibraheim Mashal that “his name would be \n                                                           \n2 See United States Government Accountability Office Report to Congressional Requesters entitled \nTerrorist Watch List Screening:  Opportunities Exist to Enhance Management Oversight, Reduce \nVulnerabilities in Agency Screening Processes, and Expand Use of the List, GAO-08-110, October 2007, at \n22. \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 21 of 225\nremoved from the No Fly List and he would receive compensation if he helped the FBI \nby  serving  as  an  informant.”):  Id  at  *22-23  (FBI  agents  offered  Amir  Meshal  “the \nopportunity to serve as a government informant in exchange for assistance in removing \nhis name from the No Fly List.”).  See also Fikre v. FBI, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73174 \n(D. Or. May 29, 2014) (Emirati officials told Yonas Fikre that he “could not travel to the \nUnited States by air because he is on the No Fly List” and an FBI agent told Fikre that \n“the FBI could take steps to remove [him] from the No Fly List if he agreed to be an \ninformant.”);  Tanveer  v.  Holder,  et.  al.,  No.  13-cv-6951,  Dkt.  15  (April  22,  2014) \n(Naveed  Shinwari  “declined  to  act  as  an  informant  for  the  Federal  Bureau  of \nInvestigation and to spy on [his] own American Muslim communities and other innocent \npeople.”). \n102.  Additionally, government records show that Dearborn, Michigan—which \nis 40 percent Arab—is disproportionately represented on the federal terror watch list.  In \nfact, Dearborn is among the top five cities in the country, alongside Chicago, Houston, \nNew York, and San Diego, represented on the federal terror watch list.   \n103.  Due to  Dearborn’s significant  population  of Muslims, it has earned a \nreputation as the “Muslim Capital of America.”   \n104.  Defendants’ 2013 Watchlisting Guidance also indicates that “[t]ravel for \nno known lawful or legitimate purpose to a locus of terrorist activity” can be a basis for \nbeing listed.  While a “locus of Terrorist Activity” is not defined by the document, upon \ninformation and belief, it likely includes any place where many Muslims reside. \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 22 of 225\n105.  The federal terror watch list’s inclusion standards are so permissive and \npliable and the selectee list's efficacy is at best fleetingly marginal that the inclusion \nstandards themselves violate Plaintiff procedural and substantive due process. \n106.  The federal terror watch list diminishes, rather than enhances, our national \nsecurity  because  the  number  of  innocent  Americans  on  the  list  is  becoming  so \nvoluminous that the purpose of having a list is significantly undermined as all are being \ntreated as the same. \n107.  The consequences of being on the federal terror watch list are meted out \npublicly.  Members of the public can witness the extra screening to which individuals on \nthe federal terror watch list are subject, oftentimes in front of family and colleagues, \nincluding being pulled out of their car at gunpoint, being ordered to leave their vehicle \nwith their hands held above their head, among other stigmatizing measures. \n108.  In practice, frontline screeners disclose the status of individuals on the \nfederal terror watch list to state and local authorities, as well as airline employees. \n109.  The operation of the federal terror watch list enlists air carriers to assist \nthe federal government in tracking the passenger on the federal terror watch list. \n110.  Defendants apply the federal terror watch list against Muslim Americans \nin a manner that is different from how they use their list against people of other faith \nbackgrounds. \n111.  Defendants  use  impermissible  and  inaccurate  religious  profiles  in \ncompiling the federal terror watch list. \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 23 of 225\n112.  Defendants who contributed to the placement of Plaintiff and similarly \nsituated American citizens on the federal terror watch list knew that their actions violated \nclearly established federal law. \n113.  Defendants knew at the time they acted unlawfully that Supreme Court \nprecedent required that, whenever a citizen is deprived of a liberty interest, the federal \ngovernment  must  at  least  provide  the  deprived  with  some  form  of  notice  that  a \ndeprivation occurred. \nThe Federal Government’s Terrorist Watch List  \nIs No More Effective Than a List of Randomly Selected Individuals \n114.  Defendants’ ability to watch list persons who pose a threat of terrorism, \ncan be measured and described using a quantitative analysis based on factual allegations \nmade in this Complaint as well as publicly available information describing the current \noperation of the federal terror watch list.   \n115.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the  federal  government  has  placed \napproximately one million persons on the federal terror watch list over the last ten years.   \n116.  Moreover,  based  on  the  University  of  Maryland’s  Global  Terrorism \nDatabase, a project funded in part by the Department of Homeland Security, there have \nbeen less than 250 terrorist acts inside the United States over the last decade.  These \nterrorist acts were perpetrated by less than 250 persons.  \n117.  Only one of these perpetrators was designated on the federal terror watch \nlist  by  the  federal  government  prior  to  their  criminal  conduct.    This  single  person \ndesignated on the federal terror watch list, however, was removed from the federal terror \nwatch list prior to perpetrating the terrorist attack. \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 24 of 225\n118.  Upon information and belief, in order to designate a person on the federal \nterror watch list, the federal government must first have information about that person.  \nBecause the federal government does not possess information on every person in the \nworld, existing law enforcement and intelligence practices produce a subset of persons \nwho  the  federal  government  can  then  screen  against  the  federal  terror  watch  list’s \ninclusion standards.   \n119.  The precise size of this subset is unknown, however a survey of law \nenforcement and intelligence practices indicates that the size of this subset is greater than \n50 million people.   \n120.  Upon information and belief, the practices that produce this subset exclude \nsome persons who do pose a threat of terrorism and include some persons who do not \npose a threat of terrorism.   \n121.  Upon further information and belief, the federal  government  does not \nscreen the entire subset of people known to it.  Moreover, Defendants do not make \nindividual determinations as to whether each person about whom they know should be \nplaced on the federal terror watch list. \n122.  In order to designate a person on the federal terror watch list, a federal \ngovernment  official  must  make  a  nomination  and  a  TSC  official  must  accept  the \nnomination.   \n123.  Upon information and belief, TSC officials accept nominations at a rate \nabove 95 percent.    \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 25 of 225\n124.  Based on the facts  alleged in  this Complaint and the publicly known \nprocesses of the federal terror watch list, a quantitative analysis can be constructed to \nmeasure and describe the performance of the federal terror watch list. \n125.  A  quantitative  analysis  demonstrates  that,  in  order  to  accomplish  the \nfederal terror watch list’s stated objectives, Defendants must have at least some greater-\nthan-random ability to identify future terrorists.  This is due to the nature of the processes \nDefendants utilize to place persons on the federal terror watch list and the size of the \npopulation Defendants can—if they so choose—screen against the federal terror watch \nlist’s inclusion standards. \n126.  A quantitative analysis also demonstrates that Defendants’ watch listing \nsystem would perform similarly if inclusion on the watch list was done via random \nselection instead of the existing inclusion standards Defendants utilize.   \n127.  A quantitative analysis therefore indicates that Defendants have no ability \nto watch list persons whose placement on the watch list would further Defendants’ stated \nobjectives.   \nInadequacy of the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program Process \n128.  The  government  entities  and  individuals  involved  in  the  creation, \nmaintenance, support,  modification and enforcement of the federal  terror watch list, \nincluding  Defendants,  have  not  provided  travelers,  including  Plaintiff  and  similarly \nsituated American citizens, with a fair and effective mechanism through which they can \nchallenge the TSC’s decision to place them on the terrorist watch list. \n129.  An individual, including Plaintiff and similarly situated American citizens, \nwho has been prevented or hindered from travel by being placed on the federal terror \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 26 of 225\nwatch  list  has  no  clear  avenue  for  redress,  because  no  single  government  entity  is \nresponsible for removing an individual from the list.  The TSC, which is administered by \nthe FBI, does not accept redress inquiries from the public, nor does it directly provide \nfinal disposition letters to individuals on the selectee list or similarly situated American \ncitizens, who have submitted redress inquiries.  The NCTC which manages the TIDE list \ndoes not accept redress inquiries from the public. \n130.  Individuals who seek redress after having been included in the terrorist \nwatch list must submit an inquiry through the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program \n(“DHS TRIP”).  DHS TRIP provides individuals with a “Redress Control Number.”   \n131.  DHS TRIP is the only redress “process” available to individuals included \non the terrorist watch list.   \n132.  DHS TRIP submits traveler complaints to the TSC, which determines \nwhether any action should be taken.  The TSC has not provided any publicly available \ninformation about how it makes that decision.  The TSC is the final arbiter of whether an \nindividual’s name is retained on or removed from the watch list, including those of \nPlaintiff and similarly situated American citizens. \n133.  The TSC makes a determination regarding a particular individual’s status \non the watch list, including Plaintiff and similarly situated American citizens, and DHS in \nturn responds to the individual with a standard form letter that neither confirms nor \ndenies the existence of any terrorist watch list records relating to the individual.  The \nletters do not set forth any basis for inclusion in a terrorist watch list, do not state whether \nthe government has resolved the complaint at issue. \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 27 of 225\n134.  The  government  does  not  provide  an  American  citizen  with  any \nopportunity to confront, or to rebut, the grounds for his or her possible inclusion on the \nwatch list.  As such, DHS TRIP offers no meaningful review of the watch list designation \nand in effect shields the TSC’s actions with respect to the individual nominations or \nclasses of nominations from meaningful review by any independent authority. \n135.  Moreover, the government’s own internal audits of the system point to \nserious flaws.  For example, a March 2008 DOJ Office of the Inspector General report \nentitled  Audit  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  Terrorism  Watchlist  Nomination \nProcesses found significant problems with the nomination and removal process. \n136.  Thus, the only “process” available to such individuals is to submit their \nnames and other identifying information to a government entity that has no authority to \nprovide redress and to hope that an unspecified government agency corrects an error or \nchanges its mind. \n137.  Plaintiff is a United States citizen.   \n138.  Plaintiff has not been arrested, charged, nor convicted of a terrorism-\nrelated offense. \nCOUNT I \nFAILURE TO PROVIDE POST-DEPRIVATION NOTICE AND HEARING IN \nVIOLATION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO PROCEDURAL DUE \nPROCESS \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n \n139.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n140.  Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens learned that he was \nplaced on the federal terror watch list subsequent to being added on the federal terror \nwatch list and sought to challenge such placement. \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 28 of 225\n141.  Defendants’ actions as described above in refusing to provide Plaintiff and \nother similarly situated American citizens with any notice at all of their placement which \ndeprived  Plaintiff  and  other  similarly  situated  American  citizens  of  constitutionally \nprotected liberty interests. \n142.  Defendants’ actions in nominating Plaintiff and other similarly situated \nAmerican citizens to the federal terror watch list blatantly violate the requirement that \n“’nominations’ must not be solely based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religious \naffiliation, or First Amendment protected activities.”  49 U.S.C. § 114(h)(3). \n143.  Plaintiff  and  other  similarly  situated  American  citizens  have  a  liberty \ninterest in traveling free from unreasonable  burdens that are not reasonably tailored \nwithin, to, and from the United States, through land border crossings and over U.S. air \nspace. \n144.  Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens have a right to be \nfree from false government stigmatization as individuals who are “known or suspected to \nbe” terrorists, or who are otherwise associated with terrorist activity, when such harm \narises in conjunction with the additional consequences that follow from being listed as \nwell as the deprivation of their right to travel on the same terms as other travelers and/or \nthe deprivation of their liberty interest under the Fifth Amendment in travel free from \nunreasonable burdens. \n145.  Plaintiff  and  other  similarly  situated  American  citizens  have  a  liberty \ninterest in nonattainder (ie:  the interest against being singled out for punishment without \ntrial).  Defendants’ actions have singled out Plaintiff and others similarly situated for \npunishments  that  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  inability  to  travel  by  air  and \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 29 of 225\nunreasonable burdens placed upon traveling by air to and from the United States, over \nU.S. air space and at land border crossings, and false association with a list of individuals \nsuspected of terrorism. \n146.  Plaintiff  and  other  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  having  been \nburdened or prevented from boarding on commercial flights or entering the United States \nat land border crossings, having had their bank accounts closed, having been prevented \nfrom  making  wire  transfers  at  financial  institutions,  having  had  their  citizenship \napplications delayed indefinitely due to  an “FBI name check,” having lost lucrative \neconomic opportunities and suffering from other forms of financial harm, having been \nprevented from test driving or purchasing vehicles at a car dealership, and having sought \nto  challenge  their  placement  on  the  federal  terror  watch  list,  are  entitled  to  a \nconstitutionally adequate legal mechanism that affords them notice of the reasons and \nbases for their placement on the federal terror watch list and a meaningful opportunity to \ncontest their continued inclusion on the federal terror watch list.  Defendants have even \nfailed to provide the most basic ingredient of due process, which is notice that the \ngovernment has deprived a person of their protected rights. \n147.  Moreover,  Defendants  have  officially  imposed  on  Plaintiff  and  other \nsimilarly  situated  American  citizens  the  stigmatizing  label  of  “known  or  suspected \nterrorists” without a constitutionally adequate legal mechanism. \n148.  Further,  Defendants  disseminated  the  stigmatizing  label  attached  to \nPlaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens of “known or suspected terrorists” \nto  state  and  local  authorities,  foreign  governments,  private  corporations,  private \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 30 of 225\ncontractors, airlines, gun sellers, car dealerships, financial institutions, the captains of \nsea-faring vessels, among other official and private entities and individuals. \n149.  By imposing on Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens \nthe  stigmatizing  label  of  “known  or  suspected  terrorists”  and  by  failing  to  provide \nPlaintiff and others similarly situated with a constitutionally adequate legal mechanism, \nDefendants have deprived Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens of their \nprotected liberty interests, including but not limited to their liberty interests in traveling, \nfreedom from false stigmatization, and nonattainder, and thus violated the constitutional \nrights of Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens without affording them \ndue process of law and will continue to do so into the future if Plaintiff and other \nsimilarly situated American citizens are not afforded the relief demanded below. \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiff  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other \nrelief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this \naction. \nCOUNT II \nDEPRIVATION OF PROTECTED LIBERTIES IN VIOLATION OF FIFTH \nAMENDMENT RIGHT TO SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n \n150.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n151.  Because  Plaintiff  and  other  similarly  situated  American  citizens  were \nlisted  by  Defendants  in  a  manner  not  narrowly  tailored  to  a  compelling  interest, \nDefendants’ actions as described above in including Plaintiff and other similarly situated \nAmerican citizens on a watch list that unreasonably burdens or prevents them from \nboarding commercial flights or entering the United States at land border crossings, are \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 31 of 225\narbitrary and capricious, lack even a rational relationship to any legitimate government \ninterest, and have unduly deprived Plaintiff of constitutionally protected rights, including \nhis liberty interests in travel, freedom from false stigmatization, and nonattainder. \n152.  Defendants’ actions in nominating Plaintiff and other similarly situated \nAmerican citizens to the No Fly List blatantly violate the requirement that “’nominations’ \nmust not be solely based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, or First \nAmendment protected activities.”  49 U.S.C. § 114(h)(3). \n153.  By placing Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens on the \nfederal terror watch list, Defendants have placed an undue burden on their fundamental \nright of movement.   \n154.  By placing Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens on the \nfederal terror watch list, Defendants have treated them like second-class citizens.   \n155.  Defendants’ watch list lacks a compelling interest insofar as their true \npurpose is to provide law enforcement with a tool to coerce American Muslims into \nbecoming informants. \n156.  Defendants’ watch list is also not narrowly tailored insofar as the federal \nterror watch list are entirely and demonstrably ineffectual and obvious alternatives exist. \n157.  Defendants’  actions  in  placing  Plaintiff  and  other  similarly  situated \nAmerican citizens on the federal terror watch list, officially imposing on Plaintiff and \nother similarly situated American citizens the stigmatizing label of “known or suspected \nterrorists,” and disseminating the stigmatizing label to state and local authorities, foreign \ngovernments,  corporations,  private  contractors,  airlines,  gun  sellers,  car  dealerships, \nfinancial institutions, the captains of sea-faring vessels, among other official and private \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 32 of 225\nentities  and  individuals,  without  a  constitutionally  adequate  legal  mechanism,  are \narbitrary and capricious, shock the conscience, violate the decencies of civilized conduct \nand are so brutal and offensive that they do not comport with the traditional ideas of fair \nplay and decency. \n158.  Because Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens have not \nbeen charged with any crimes and are United States Citizens, Plaintiff challenges his \nplacement and the placement of others similarly situated American citizens on the federal \nterror watch list on a broad, as-applied basis. \n159.  Plaintiff’s substantive due process challenge is also facial, as there are no \ncircumstances where his placement or the placement of others similarly situated on the \nfederal  terror watch list  is  narrowly tailored to  achieve any compelling  government \ninterest. \n160.  Defendants  have  thus  violated  Plaintiff’s  constitutional  rights  and  the \nconstitutional rights of other similarly situated American citizens without affording them \ndue process of law and will continue to do so into the future if Plaintiff and other \nsimilarly situated American citizens are not afforded the relief demanded below. \n161.  By placing Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens on the \nfederal watch list, Defendants caused them an actual, imminent and irreparable injury that \ncannot be undone through monetary remedies. \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiff  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other \nrelief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this \naction. \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 33 of 225\nCOUNT III \nUNLAWFUL AGENCY ACTION IN VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE \nPROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706 \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n \n162.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n163.  Defendants’  actions  in  placing  Plaintiff  and  other  similarly  situated \nAmerican citizens on the federal terror watch list, officially imposing on Plaintiff and \nother similarly situated American citizens the stigmatizing label of “known or suspected \nterrorists,” and disseminating the stigmatizing label to state and local authorities, foreign \ngovernments,  corporations,  private  contractors,  airlines,  gun  sellers,  car  dealerships, \nfinancial institutions, the captains of sea-faring vessels, among other official and private \nentities and individuals, without a constitutionally adequate legal mechanism, were and \nare arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, otherwise not in accordance with law, \nand contrary to constitutional rights, power, privilege, or immunity, and should be set \naside as unlawful pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n164.  Defendants’ actions in nominating Plaintiff and other similarly situated \nAmerican citizens to the federal terror watch list blatantly violate the requirement that \n“’nominations’ must not be solely based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religious \naffiliation, or First Amendment protected activities.”  49 U.S.C. § 114(h)(3). \n165.  Defendants’  failure  to  provide  Plaintiff  and  other  similarly  situated \nAmerican  citizens,  who  have  been  unreasonably  burdened  or  denied  boarding  on \ncommercial  flights  or  entering  the  United  States  across  the  border  and  sought  to \nchallenge their placement on the federal terror watch list, with a constitutionally adequate \nmechanism that affords them notice of the reasons and bases for their placement on the \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 34 of 225\nfederal terror watch list and a meaningful opportunity to contest their continued inclusion \non the federal terror watch list is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, otherwise \nnot in accordance with law, and contrary to constitutional rights, power, privilege, or \nimmunity, and should be set aside as unlawful pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n166.  Because Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens do not \npresent a security threat to commercial aviation, Defendants’ actions as described above \nin including Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens on the federal terror \nwatch list that unreasonably burdens or prevents them from boarding commercial flights \nor entering the United States across the border, are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, otherwise not in accordance with law, and contrary to constitutional rights, \npower, privilege, or immunity, and should be set aside as unlawful pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § \n706. \n167.  By placing Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens on the \nfederal watch list, Defendants caused them an actual, imminent and irreparable injury that \ncannot be undone through monetary remedies. \n168.  Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens are not required to \nexhaust the DHS TRIP process, under the holding in Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137 \n(1993).  See United States District Court, Eastern District of Virginia, Case No. 11-cv-\n00050 (2011); Dkt. 70 at 22; attached as Memorandum Opinion (Exhibit 4). \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiff  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other \nrelief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this \naction. \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 35 of 225\nCOUNT IV \nVIOLATION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT  \nTO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n(Equal Protection) \n \n169.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n170.  Defendants’  actions  in  placing  Plaintiff  and  other  similarly  situated \nAmerican citizens on the federal terror watch list, officially imposing on Plaintiff and \nother similarly situated American citizens the stigmatizing label of “known or suspected \nterrorists,” and disseminating the stigmatizing label to state and local authorities, foreign \ngovernments,  private  corporations,  private  contractors,  airlines,  gun  sellers,  car \ndealerships, financial institutions, the captains of sea-faring vessels, among other official \nand private entities and individuals, without a constitutionally adequate legal mechanism \nare discriminatory and constitute an action that targets religious conduct for distinctive \ntreatment. \n171.  Defendants’ actions in nominating Plaintiff and other similarly situated \nAmerican citizens to the federal terror watch list blatantly violate the requirement that \n“’nominations’ must not be solely based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religious \naffiliation, or First Amendment protected activities.”  49 U.S.C. § 114(h)(3). \n172.  By placing Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens on the \nfederal terror watch list, Defendants have treated Plaintiff and other similarly situated \nAmerican citizens like second-class citizens.   \n173.  Defendants’  above-described  actions  were  motivated  by  the  religious \nstatus of Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens and on the basis of the \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 36 of 225\nconstitutionally-protected free exercise of religion of Plaintiff and other similarly situated \nAmerican citizens. \n174.  Defendants’  above-described  actions  have  had  a  discriminatory  effect \nupon  and  have  disparately  impacted  Plaintiff  and  other  similarly  situated  American \ncitizens who are Muslim American travelers, and not travelers of other faiths. \n175.  Defendants’  above-described  actions,  policies,  course  of  conduct,  or \npattern of practice that mandate or permit the above-described treatment of Plaintiff and \nother similarly situated American citizens does not serve a compelling state interest or a \nlegitimate or public purpose, nor are they the least restrictive means or narrowly tailored \nto achieve any such interest. \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiff  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other \nrelief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this \naction. \nCOUNT V \nVIOLATION OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n(Non-Delegation) \n \n176.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n177.  Congress  has  not  provided  the  Executive  Branch  with  intelligible \nprinciples from which the Executive can implement its watch list schemes regarding civil \naviation and national security. \n178.  Congress has not directed the Executive Branch to create either a No Fly \nList or a Selectee List. \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 37 of 225\n179.  Congress has not authorized the Executive Branch to utilize the federal \nterror watch list to encourage financial institutions to close bank accounts or ban wire \ntransfers, to encourage car dealerships to restrict test drives or purchases of vehicles, or \nstate and local law enforcement to detain individuals based on their watch list status.  \n180.  Congress  has  not  authorized  the  Executive  Branch  to  disseminate  the \nterror watch list to local and state authorities, foreign countries, private corporations, \nprivate  contractors,  airlines,  gun  sellers,  car  dealerships,  financial  institutions,  the \ncaptains of sea-faring vessels, among other official and private entities and individuals. \n181.  The Executive Branch’s assignment of the watch listing function to TSC \nviolates Congress’ directive that TSA determine who belongs on federal terror watch lists \nand the consequences that flow from being on those lists.   \n182.  Congress has not delegated to TSA the authority to create a process that \ncan culminate in the removal of individuals from the TSDB. \n183.  In the alternative, Congress’s delegation to TSA to create a redress process \nis defective because the Executive Branch has allocated watch list authority in a manner \nthat prevents TSA from creating a redress process. \n184.  As a result, Defendants have illegally acted beyond their authority. \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiff  requests  this  Honorable  Court  grant  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other \nrelief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this \naction. \n   \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 38 of 225\nPrayer for Relief \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests: \n1.  A  declaratory  judgment  that  Defendants’  policies,  practices,  and  customs \nviolate  the  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution  and  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act; \n2.  An injunction that: \na.  requires  Defendants  to  remedy  the  constitutional  and  statutory \nviolations identified above, including the removal of Plaintiff from any \nwatch list or database that burdens or prevents him from flying or \nentering the United States across the border; and, \nb.  requires Defendants to provide individuals designated on the federal \nterror watch list with a legal mechanism that affords them notice of the \nreasons and bases for their placement on the federal terror watch list \nand a meaningful opportunity to contest their continued inclusion on \nthe federal terror watch list; \n3.  A trial by jury; \n4.  An award of attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses of all litigation, pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 2412; and, \n5.  Such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \n \n   \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 2   Filed 06/16/17   Page 39 of 225\nDated June 16, 2017 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nPARKER & McCONKIE \n \nBY:    /s/ James W.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF UTAH \n \nYUSSUF AWADIR ABDI, \n  MEMORANDUM DECISION AND \nPlaintiff,   ORDER \n   \nv.    \n   \nCHRISTOPHER WRAY, Director of the   \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, in his  Case No. 2:17-cv-622-DB \nofficial capacity, et al.,   \n  District Judge Dee Benson \nDefendants. \n \n  Before the court is Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss First Amended Complaint. (Dkt. No. \n18.) The court held a hearing on the Motion on April 5, 2018. At the conclusion of the hearing, \nthe court took the Motion under advisement. Now being fully informed, the court issues this \nMemorandum Decision and Order. \nBackground \n  In June of 2017, Plaintiff—a United States citizen—flew to Kenya to bring his wife and \nchildren, who had recently received visa approval, with him to the United States. (First Amended \nComplaint at ¶¶ 34-35.) On June 14, 2017, Plaintiff appeared at Jomo Kenyatta International \nAirport in Nairobi, Kenya to board a commercial flight back to his home in the United States. \n(Id. at ¶ 34.) Plaintiff tried to check in at a kiosk stationed at the airport, but was directed to an \nairline representative to manually check him in for his flight. (Id. at ¶ 36.) Plaintiff’s wife and \nchildren printed their boarding passes without difficulty, but the Qatar Airlines representative \ntold Plaintiff that the United States would not allow him to board his flight. (Id. at ¶ 39.)  \n\n  The following day, Plaintiff went to the United States Embassy in Kenya to obtain \ninformation as to why he was denied boarding. (Id. at ¶ 41.) The representatives at the embassy \ndid not provide Plaintiff with any information. (Id. at ¶ 42.) Plaintiff rescheduled his flight for \nthe following day, June 16, 2017, on which he was allowed to board. (Id. at ¶¶ 43-44.) When \nPlaintiff arrived at the Los Angeles International Airport, he was subjected to a lengthy screening \nprocess, which caused him to miss his connecting flight to Salt Lake City. (Id. at ¶ 44.) Plaintiff \nrescheduled his flight to Salt Lake City for June 18, 2017, which he was allowed to board after \nanother lengthy screening process. (Id. at ¶ 45.) \n  Since then, Plaintiff has flown on three separate occasions: to San Jose, California in July \n2017; to and from Mecca Saudi Arabia in August 2017; and to and from Virginia in October \n2017. (Id. at ¶ 47.) On each trip, Plaintiff was required to obtain his boarding pass from a \nticketing agent rather than a kiosk. (Id. at ¶ 49.) Each time, it took about a half hour for Plaintiff \nto obtain his boarding pass, after the ticketing agent called the Terrorist Screening Center and \nstamped Plaintiff’s boarding pass with “SSSS”. (Id. at ¶¶ 49-50.) Each time, Plaintiff was \nsubjected to a lengthy screening process. (Id.at ¶ 51.) \nIn September of 2003, the Terrorist Screening Center (“TSC”) was established to \nconsolidate the government’s approach to terrorism screening. (Id. at ¶ 58.) The TSC, which is \nadministered by the FBI, develops and maintains the federal government’s consolidated \nTerrorism Screening Database (the “watchlist”). (Id.) The watchlist has two primary \ncomponents: the Selectee List and the No Fly List. (Id. at ¶ 59.) Those placed on the Selectee \nList are subject to extra screening at airports and land border crossings, and their boarding passes \n2 \n\nare often stamped with “SSSS”. (Id.) Those on the No Fly List are prevented from boarding \nflights that fly into, out of, or through United States airspace. (Id.)  \nPlaintiff believes that he has been on the Selectee List component of the watchlist since \n2014, because that is when he began to be subjected to extra security procedures when traveling \nby airplane.1 (Id. at ¶ 26.) Sometime in 2016, Plaintiff filed a redress request through the \nDepartment of Homeland Security Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (“DHS TRIP”). (Id. at ¶ \n32.) On May 22, 2017, Plaintiff received a standard form letter that neither confirmed nor denied \nthe existence of any watchlist records relating to him. (Id. at ¶¶ 33, 137.) The letter did not set \nforth any basis for inclusion on the watchlist, nor did it state whether the government had \nresolved the complaint at issue. (Id.) \nDiscussion \n  Plaintiff challenges his placement on the watchlist on several grounds: 1) procedural due \nprocess, 2) substantive due process, 3) agency action in violation of the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”), 4) equal protection, and 5) non-delegation. (Id. at ¶¶ 143-190.) To \nsurvive a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a complaint must \ncontain “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). In deciding a motion to dismiss, “courts must consider the \ncomplaint in its entirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Rule \n12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, in particular, documents incorporated into the complaint by \nreference, and matters of which a court may take judicial notice.” Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & \nRights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007). The court must accept all well-pleaded allegations in the \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiff also believes that he may have been upgraded to the No Fly List for a short time while he was in Kenya in \nJune of 2017. (Id. at ¶ 1.) \n3 \n\ncomplaint as true and “construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.” Williams v. \nMeese, 926 F.2d 994, 997 (10th Cir.1991). \n  Jurisdiction \n  As a threshold matter, Defendant argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to the extent \nPlaintiff challenges the adequacy of the DHS TRIP procedures. Counsel for Plaintiff stated at \noral argument that he is not challenging the DHS TRIP process, but rather the TSC determination \nto place him on the watchlist in the first instance. Based on Plaintiff’s assertion that he does not \nchallenge the DHS TRIP process (arguably an order of TSA), and Defendant’s \nacknowledgement that the TSC is not an agency covered by 49 U.S.C. § 46110, the court denies \nDefendant’s request for dismissal on those grounds. \n  Procedural Due Process \n  Plaintiff’s first claim alleges that Defendants violated his procedural due process rights \nby placing him on the watchlist without notice or a hearing. The Due Process Clause states that \n“No person shall be * * * deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law[.]” \nU.S. Const. amend. V. “The requirements of procedural due process apply only to the \ndeprivation of interests encompassed by the [Constitution’s] protection of liberty and property.” \nBd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569 (1972). To determine whether \nprocedural due process has been violated, courts consider three factors: (1) “the private interest \nthat will be affected by the official action;” (2) “the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such \ninterest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute \nprocedural safeguards;” and (3) “the Government's interest, including the function involved and \n4 \n\nthe fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement \nwould entail.” Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976). \n  Here, Plaintiff identifies two private interests that are affected by his placement on the \nwatchlist: 1) the right of movement and 2) his reputational interests. Plaintiff argues that the right \nof movement is “a fundamental right that can be traced back to the Magna Carta.” (Dkt. No. 23 \nat 21.) In support of his position that the freedom of movement is a constitutionally protected \nright, Plaintiff cites to an Eastern District of Virginia case, Mohamed v. Holder, 995 F. Supp. 2d \n520, 530 (E.D. Va. 2014), and general statements made by the Supreme Court in the context of \nthe right to travel in Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116, 126 (1958). Neither case supports the broad \nadoption of a general freedom of movement suggested by Plaintiff. \nThe right to travel has been recognized by the Supreme Court as a constitutionally \nprotected interest. See id. This court has not been provided with any authority to extend that right \nto travel to protect a right to movement generally. Plaintiff has been consistently inconvenienced \nin his travel by his status on the watchlist. But the Supreme Court has not recognized a right to \nconvenient or unimpeded travel. Plaintiff has failed to show that the right to movement is a \nliberty interest that is protected under the Constitution, particularly where, as here, Plaintiff has \nbeen able to travel, albeit inconveniently. \n  Plaintiff also fails to show that any recognized reputational interest has been harmed. \nInjury to reputation alone is “not a ‘liberty’ interest protected” under the Due Process Clause. \nSiegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 233 (1991). “For a plaintiff to prevail on a claim that the \ngovernment has violated the Due Process Clause by damaging its reputation, that plaintiff must \nsatisfy the ‘stigma-plus’ standard. That standard requires the plaintiff to demonstrate both “(1) \n5 \n\ngovernmental defamation and (2) an alteration in legal status.” Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. v. \nKansas Dep't of Transp., 810 F.3d 1161, 1184 (10th Cir. 2016). Plaintiff argues that the \npublication of the watchlist and the additional public screening required of him at airports is \nsufficient to satisfy this standard. The court disagrees.  \nEven assuming that Plaintiff has adequately alleged defamation, he has not suffered a \nchange of legal status. The types of deprivations which have been recognized under the “stigma-\nplus” standard include actions such as revocation of a driver’s license, Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. \n693, 711 (1976), being labeled as a sex offender and required to register as one, Gwinn v. \nAwmiller, 354 F.3d 1211, 1224 (10th Cir. 2004), and defamation upon termination of \nemployment. Guttman v. Khalsa, 669 F.3d 1101, 1125 (10th Cir. 2012). Plaintiff’s repeated \nscreening at airports, while no doubt frustrating to Plaintiff, do not rise to the level of a change in \nlegal status. Plaintiff has not identified any constitutionally protected liberty or property interest. \nAccordingly, Plaintiff’s procedural due process claim must be dismissed. \n  Substantive Due Process \n  Plaintiff’s substantive due process claim similarly fails. The Supreme Court has set forth \nan “established method of substantive-due process analysis” which has “two primary features.” \nWashington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721 (1997). First, a court must “carefully formulat[e] \nthe interest at stake.” Id. at 722. Second, the court must determine whether the interest at stake is \namong those “fundamental rights and liberties” rooted in our country’s history. Id. at 720-721.  \n  Plaintiff asserts that the right of movement is a fundamental right embedded as an \nunenumerated right in the Constitution. Plaintiff does not provide case law precedent that \nsupports his position. Rather, Plaintiff would have this court rely on quotes from the colonists \n6 \n\nand dicta from right to travel cases. This court is unwilling to create a new unenumerated right \nunder the Constitution. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s substantive due process claim fails. \n  Agency Action under the APA \n  Plaintiff’s APA claim alleges that he was stigmatized “without a constitutionally \nadequate legal mechanism” to challenge his placement on the watchlist. (Compl. at ¶ 169.) \nPlaintiff seems to have abandoned this claim by asserting that he is not challenging the adequacy \nof the DHS TRIP procedures. However, even if Plaintiff maintains this claim—and assuming \nthis court has jurisdiction to hear it—Plaintiff’s APA claim fails because he has failed to identify \na constitutionally protected interest, as discussed in the Procedural Due Process section above. \n  Equal Protection \n  The Equal Protection Clause prohibits the government from “deny[ing] to any person \nwithin its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, §1. To \ndemonstrate a deprivation of this constitutional guarantee, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the \nchallenged action “intentionally discriminates between groups of persons.” SECSYS, LLC v. \nVigil, 666 F.3d 678, 685 (10th Cir. 2012). Where, as here, the challenged action “is generally \napplicable to all persons, no presumption of intentional discrimination arises; proof is required.” \nId. It is insufficient to allege only disparate impact. Pers. Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. \n256, 274 (1979). The Plaintiff must show a discriminatory purpose, which “implies more than \nintent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences” and instead requires Plaintiff to show \nthat unequal treatment is “an intended consequence” of the government action. Vigil, 666 F.3d at \n685 (quoting Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279). \n7 \n\n  The Complaint with its attachments fails to demonstrate intentional discrimination by the \ngovernment. Plaintiff alleges a disparate impact on Muslim Americans, but disparate impact is \ninsufficient to establish intentional discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause \nunder Tenth Circuit precedent. Plaintiff also argues that the government uses “impermissible and \ninaccurate religious profiles in compiling the federal watch list.” (Dkt. No. 23 at 34.) Plaintiff’s \nconclusory statements lack factual support, even considering the purportedly leaked government \ndocuments attached to Plaintiff’s Complaint. Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege intentional \ndiscrimination by the government in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. \n  Non-Delegation \n   “Congress may not constitutionally delegate its legislative power to another branch of \nGovernment.” Touby v. United States, 500 U.S. 160, 165 (1991). But when Congress “lay[s] \ndown by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [act] is \ndirected to conform, such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of legislative power.’” \nMistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 (1989) (quoting J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United \nStates, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928)). To set forth a constitutionally permissible “intelligible \nprinciple” while delegating authority, Congress need only “clearly delineate[] the general policy, \nthe public agency which is to apply it, and the boundaries of this delegated authority.’” Mistretta, \n488 U.S. at 372–73 (quoting Am. Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. 90, 105 (1946)). \n  Here, Congress has charged TSA with overall responsibility for airline security. See 49 \nU.S.C. § 114(d). Together with the FBI, TSA must “assess current and potential threats to the \ndomestic air transportation system,” and “decide on and carry out the most effective method for \ncontinuous analysis and monitoring of security threats to that system.” 49 U.S.C. § 44904(a). In \n8 \n\nconsultation with other federal agencies, TSA must “establish policies and procedures requiring \nair carriers [to] … prevent the individual from boarding an aircraft, or take other appropriate \naction with respect to that individual.” 49 U.S.C. § 114(h)(1)–(3). This delegation of authority \nprovides a general policy, the agencies which are to apply it, and the bounds within which it is to \nbe applied. Accordingly, it sufficiently sets forth an “intelligible principle” and does not violate \nthe non-delegation doctrine.  \nConclusion \n  For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is hereby GRANTED. \n \n    DATED this 20th day of April, 2018. \n \nBY THE COURT: \n \n \n   \nDee Benson \nUnited States District Judge \n \n9 ",

(“Council  on  American-Islamic  Relations”  or  “CAIR”)  and  Parker  & \nMcConkie, states as follows: \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.663   Page 2 of 41\nIntroduction \n1.  Subsequent to the filing of this case, the federal government removed Plaintiff \nYussuf Abdi from the No Fly List.  But while the plaintiff is now able to fly, he is still in the \nTerrorist Screening Database and has been placed back on the Selectee list, which is simply \nanother subset of the government’s terrorist watchlist.   \n2.  Because he is on the Selectee List, Plaintiff Abdi—who has not been arrested, \ncharged,  or  convicted  of  any  type  of  terrorism-related  offense—has  been  subjected  to \nhumiliating searches at airports and ports of entry that leave other travelers fearful of him.  The \nscrutiny the plaintiff receives is stigmatizing insofar as it communicates to his fellow travelers \nthat Plaintiff Abdi is dangerous and somehow deserving of the invasive screening he receives.   \n3.  The  defendants’  rationale  for  placing  Plaintiff  Abdi  on  the  Selectee  List  is \narbitrary at best and discriminatory at worst.  Indeed, many Americans, including children, end \nup on this secret federal terror watch list based on mere guesses, hunches, and conjecture, and \neven simply based on matters of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion or the exercise of their \nconstitutional rights. \n4.  The consequences of being on the Selectee List to Plaintiff Abdi include the \nburden of having to go through security with ticketing agents and all screeners receiving a \nmessage for the remainder of a listee’s life that he or she is a \"known or suspected terrorist,\" an \ninability to obtain licenses, to exercise their Second Amendment right to own a firearm, and to be \nfree  from  the unimaginable indignity and  real-life danger of having their own  government \ncommunicate to hundreds of thousands of federal agents, private contractors, businesses, state \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.664   Page 3 of 41\nand local police, the captains of sea-faring vessels, and foreign governments all across the world \nthat they are a violent menace. \n5.  And unfortunately, the federal government has designed its Selectee List to be \naccountability-free.  Persons placed on the federal terror watch list have no means of challenging \nthe constitutionality of their listing.  Indeed, people on the federal terror watch lists only learn of \ntheir placement when they feel the web of consequences burdening their lives and aspirations, \nand they never learn the circumstances that led to their listing. \n6.  With  regards  to  the  Selectee  list,  the  federal  government  will  not,  via  the \nadministrative process called DHS TRIP, even confirm that a person has been listed.  \n7.  Media accounts have made clear that the secret federal terror watch list is the \nproduct of bigotry and misguided, counterproductive zeal.  Americans are dumped onto the \nwatch list without being charged, convicted, or in some stomach-churning cases, even subject to \nan ongoing investigation.   \n8.  Instead, two leaked government documents and a governmental report, which \ninclude the March 2013 Watchlisting Guidance (Exhibit 2), the Directorate of Terrorist Identities \n(DTI): Strategic Accomplishments 2013 (Exhibit 3), and the Department of Justice's March 2014 \nAudit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Management of Terrorist Watchlist (Exhibit 4) \nreveal that the care the federal government takes in creating its federal terror watch list is void of \nproper processing, which in turn results in life-altering consequences that flow from these illegal \nactions. \n9.  In fact, upon information and belief, Dearborn, a city of less than 100,000 and a \nplace Arab Americans and Muslim Americans have called home for generations, contains the \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.665   Page 4 of 41\nsecond highest concentration of Americans on the federal government's watch list.  Moreover, \nthere have been more than 1.5 million nominations to the federal terror watch list since 2009 and \nthat, in 2013 for example, the Terrorist Screening Center converted 98.96 percent of those \nnominations into watch list placements. \n10.  Upon information and belief, evidence also shows that the federal government \nuses guilt-by-association presumptions to place family members and friends of listed persons on \nthe watch list.   \n11.  Moreover, travel to Muslim majority countries—travel that American Muslims \nare very likely to engage in—is also a basis for watch list placement.   \n12.  In 2009, the federal government made 227,932 nominations to its federal terror \nwatch list.  In 2013, that number more than doubled at an alarming and dangerous rate to \n468,749.   \n13.  Recently, a federal court judge observed in Gulet Mohamed v. Eric R. Holder, Jr., \net al. (United States District Court, Eastern District of Virginia, Case No. 11-cv-00050 (2011)), \nthat “[a] showing of past or ongoing unlawful conduct does not seem to be required,… But the \nCourt has little, if any, ability to articulate what information is viewed by TSC as sufficiently \n‘derogatory’ beyond the labels it has provided the Court.  In sum, the No Fly List assumes that \nthere are some American citizens who are simply too dangerous to be permitted to fly, no matter \nthe level of pre-flight screening or on-flight surveillance and restraint, even though those citizens \ncannot be legally arrested, detained, or otherwise restricted in their movements or conduct.”  See \nUnited States District Court, Eastern District of Virginia, Case No. 11-cv-00050 (2011); Dkt. 70 \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.666   Page 5 of 41\nat 19; attached as Memorandum Opinion (Exhibit 1).  While Mohamed dealt with the No Fly \nList, its rationale is applicable to the Selectee List as well.   \n14.  In another case, a federal court held that the allegations similar to the ones made \nbelow “plausibly allege that the dissemination of the Watch List may be so widespread that it is \ntantamount to public disclosure, even if only distributed to other government and private entities \nthat need the information for official objectives.  See United States District Court, Eastern \nDistrict  of  Virginia,  Case  No.  1:16-cv-000375  (2017);  Dkt.  47  at  14-15,;  attached  as \nMemorandum Opinion (Exhibit 5). \nParties \n15.  Plaintiff Yusuf Awadir Abdi is a United States Citizen and a Muslim residing in \nSalt Lake County, Utah.   \n16.  Defendant Andrew McCabe is the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(“FBI”).  Defendant McCabe is responsible for the nominations of Plaintiff and other similarly \nsituated American citizens to the federal terror watch list.  Defendant McCabe is being sued in \nhis official capacity, only. \n17.  Defendant Christopher Wray is the Director of the Terrorist Screening Center \n(“TSC”).  Defendant Wray was appointed on August 2, 2017.  Defendant Wray develops and \nmaintains the federal  government’s consolidated Terrorism  Screening  Database (the  “watch \nlist”), and accepted the nominations of Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens to \nthe federal terror watch list.  Defendant Wray also oversees the dissemination of the stigmatizing \nlabel attached to Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens of “known or suspected \nterrorists” to state and local authorities, foreign governments, corporations, private contractors, \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.667   Page 6 of 41\nairlines, gun sellers, car dealerships, financial institutions, the captains of sea-faring vessels, \namong other official and private entities and individuals.  Defendant Wray is being sued in his \nofficial capacity, only. \n18.  Defendant  Huban  A.  Gowadia  is  Acting  Administrator  of  the  Transportation \nSecurity  Administration  (“TSA”).    Defendant  Gowadia  oversaw  the  dissemination  of  the \nstigmatizing label attached to Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens of “known \nor suspected terrorists” to state and local authorities, foreign governments, corporations, private \ncontractors, airlines, gun sellers, car dealerships, financial institutions, the captains of sea-faring \nvessels, among other official and private entities and individuals.  Defendant Gowadia is being \nsued in his official capacity, only. \n19.  Defendant Kevin K. McCaleenan is Acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection.  In this role, Defendant McCaleenam is responsible for the application of the \nwatch list to CBP agents at ports of entry, where a person’s watch list status determines how they \nare treated at the border.  Defendant McCaleenam is being sued in his official capacity, only. \n20.  Defendant Nicholas Rasmussen is the Director of the National Counterterrorism \nCenter  (“NCTC”).    Defendant  Rasmussen,  alongside  other  agencies,  is  responsible  for  the \nnominations that resulted in the placement of Plaintiff and other similarly situated American \ncitizens on the federal terror watch list.  Defendant Rasmussen is being sued in his official \ncapacity, only. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n21.  Under U.S. Const. Art. III §2, this Court has jurisdiction because the rights sought \nto be protected herein are secured by the United States Constitution.  Jurisdiction is proper \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.668   Page 7 of 41\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), et seq., 5 U.S.C. § 702, 5 U.S.C. § 706, the United States \nConstitution, and federal common law. \n22.  This action seeks declaratory relief pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 \nU.S.C. § § 2201-02, Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and pursuant to the \ngeneral, legal, and equitable powers of this Court. \n23.  A substantial part of the unlawful acts alleged herein were committed within the \njurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Utah. \n24.  Venue  is  proper  under  42  U.S.C.  §  1391(e)  as  to  all  Defendants  because \nDefendants are officers or employees of agencies of the United States sued in their official \ncapacities and because this judicial district is where Plaintiff resides and where a substantial part \nof the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred.   \nFactual Background \nPlaintiff Yussuf Awadir Abdi’s Inability to Return to the United States \n25.  Plaintiff Yussuf Awadir Abdi (hereinafter “Imam Abdi”) is a Muslim religious \nleader and Imam of Madina Masjid Mosque in Salt Lake City, Utah. \n26.  Sometime in 2014, the federal government placed Imam Abdi on the Selectee List \ncomponent  of  the  federal  terror  watch  list,  having  secretly  concluded  that  officials  had  a \n“reasonable suspicion” that Imam Abdi was “associated with terrorism.”  See Exhibit 2. \n27.  Imam Abdi knows that he was on the Selectee List because, for approximately the \nlast three years, every time he travels by air, he is unable to check in to his flights online or at the \nkiosks stationed at the airports. \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.669   Page 8 of 41\n28.  Rather, he is directed to check in manually with an airline representative in order \nto print his boarding pass. \n29.  The airline representative, after pulling up his name on the computer system, \nwould contact the Department of Homeland Security in order to obtain clearance so that he could \nfly. \n30.  Once clearance from the Department of Homeland Security is obtained, the airline \nrepresentative would then print his boarding pass, which would be stamped with the “SSSS” \ndesignation, indicating that he has been designated as a “known or suspected terrorist.”  \n31.  Imam  Abdi  was  then  subjected  to  routine  secondary  inspections,  prolonged \nsearches and questioning every time he traveled by air. \n32.  Imam Abdi filed a redress request through DHS TRIP some time in 2016. \n33.  On May 22, 2017, Imam Abdi received a letter as described in paragraph 133 \nbelow and was assigned a Redress Control Number.  While that letter contained many words, it \nprovided no information—not notice of his placement nor some means by which to challenge his \ndesignation—about Imam Abdi’s status as a listee.   \n34.  On June 14, 2017, Imam Abdi appeared at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in \nNairobi, Kenya to board a commercial flight back to his home in the United States. \n35.  Because his visa petitions that he filed for his wife and two of his children had \njust been approved, Imam Abdi had traveled to Kenya to bring his wife and five children with \nhim to the United States.  His remaining three children are United States Citizens. \n36.  Upon information and belief, the immigration application, submitted in 2012, that \nImam Abdi filed for his wife and two of his children was processed differently because of his \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.670   Page 9 of 41\nstatus on the terrorist watch list.  After that immigration application was approved in 2013, Imam \nAbdi’s family’s visas were not approved for several years—not until May 2017—an adjudication \nprocess that was also lengthened because of his status as a listee.     \n37.  Imam Abdi tried to check in at a kiosk stationed at the airport, however, he was \ndirected to an airline representative to manually check him in for his flight. \n38.  Imam Abdi then presented himself at the Qatar Airlines ticket counter. \n39.  Although his wife and children were able to print their boarding passes, the Qatar \nAirlines representative told Imam Abdi that the United States would not allow him to board his \nflight in order to return to his home in the United States. \n40.  Upon information and belief, Imam Abdi was upgraded from the Selectee List to \nthe No Fly List after he arrived in Kenya. \n41.  The following day, on June 15, 2017, Imam Abdi appeared at the United States \nEmbassy in Nairobi, Kenya to obtain information as to why he was denied boarding and being \nprevented from returning to his home in the United States. \n42.  However, the United States Embassy did not provide him with any information. \n43.  Imam Abdi rescheduled his flight to the United States to leave on June 16, 2017. \n44.  The federal government allowed him to board this flight to the United States.  \nHowever, upon arriving at the Los Angeles International Airport’s port of entry, the defendants \ndetained Imam Abdi for lengthy screening which forced him to miss his flight to Salt Lake City.   \n45.  On June 18, 2017, after another lengthy screening at Los Angeles International \nAirport, Imam Abdi again was almost prevented from boarding his flight.  The pilot, however, \nrefused to depart without the plaintiff and his family and they were allowed on the plane.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.671   Page 10 of 41\n46.  Imam Abdi and his family arrived in Salt Lake City on June 18, 2017 by plane.   \n47.  Since then, Imam Abdi has flown on three separate occasions: (i) to San Jose, \nCalifornia in July 2017 (ii) to and from Mecca Saudi Arabia in August 2017, and (iii) to and \nfrom Virginia in October 2017. \n48.  On each trip, though the plaintiff was allowed to fly, he confronted humiliating \nand stigmatizing treatment.   \n49.  Because the defendants placed him on the Selectee List, he could not print his \nboarding pass at a kiosk and instead would proceed to a ticketing agent.  The ticketing agent also \ncould not simply print his boarding pass, but instead had to call the Terrorist Screening Center to \nseek their permission to print the plaintiff’s boarding pass.  On each occasion, it would take the \nplaintiff about half an hour to obtain a boarding pass.   \n50.  Each boarding pass Imam Abdi has received since returning to the United States \nwas stamped with “SSSS,” a clear indication that he is on the Selectee List.   \n51.  When Imam Abdi would proceed to the security checkpoint with his boarding \npass, TSA officials would shut down an entire screening line and the plaintiff would proceed \nthrough the line by himself, several TSA officers would each check his luggage, and then TSA \nofficers would huddle amongst themselves and make a phone call prior to allowing Imam Abdi \nto proceed to his gate.   \n52.  When Imam Abdi would proceed to his gate, there would be about half a dozen \nTSA officers waiting for him and he would again be screened in front of everyone.   \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.672   Page 11 of 41\n53.  Each time the defendants caused Imam Abdi to be screened, he could see that this \ncaused other passengers to be fearful of him.  It was also stigmatizing to Imam Abdi that fellow \ntravelers would have to see differential treatment he faces at airports and ports of entry.   \n54.  At no time was Imam Abdi given notice of the factual basis for his placement on \nthe federal terror watch list, and at no time was he offered a meaningful opportunity to contest \nhis designation. \n55.  Moreover, at no time was Imam Abdi given notice of the deprivation of his liberty \ninterests or violation of his constitutional rights. \n56.  Upon information and belief, Imam Abdi’s nomination to and designation on the \nfederal terror watch list was made based solely upon a hunch (based upon his race, ethnicity, \nnational  origin,  religious  affiliation,  guilt-by-association,  or  First  Amendment  protected \nactivities). \n57.  Upon information and belief, because Imam Abdi is included on the federal terror \nwatch list, and specifically the Selectee List, Defendants disseminated and are continuing to \ndisseminate his designation as a “known or suspected terrorist” to state and local authorities \n(including  the  local  police  officers  above),  foreign  governments,  corporations,  private \ncontractors, airlines, gun sellers, car dealerships, financial institutions, among other official and \nprivate entities and individuals. \nThe Federal Government’s Terrorist Watch List \n58.  In September, 2003, Attorney General John Ashcroft established the Terrorist \nScreening Center (“TSC”) to consolidate the government’s approach to terrorism screening.  The \nTSC,  which  is  administered  by  the  FBI,  develops  and  maintains  the  federal  government’s \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.673   Page 12 of 41\nconsolidated Terrorism Screening Database (the “watch list”).  TSC’s consolidated watch list is \nthe federal government’s master repository for suspected international and domestic terrorist \nrecords used for watch list related screening. \n59.  The watch list has two primary components: the Selectee List and the No Fly List.  \nPersons on the Selectee List are systematically subject to extra screening at airports and land \nborder crossings, and often find “SSSS” on their boarding passes printed by airline employees \nwhich is marked to indicate a passenger’s watch list status to airline employees and screeners.  \nPersons on the No Fly List are prevented from boarding flights that fly into, out of, or even \nthrough United States airspace. \n60.  Defendant  TSC  disseminates  records  from  its  terrorist  watch  list  to  other \ngovernment agencies that in turn use those records to identify suspected terrorists.  For example, \napplicable TSC records are provided to TSA for use by airlines in pre-screening passengers and \nto CBP for use in screening travelers entering the United States by land.   \n61.  Upon information and belief, Defendants disseminated the records of Plaintiff \nfrom their terrorist watch list to other government agencies, including Defendant TSA for use by \nairlines  in  pre-screening  Plaintiff,  and  Defendant  CBP  for  use  in  screening  Plaintiff  upon \nentering the United States. \n62.  Upon information and belief, Defendants disseminated the records pertaining to \nPlaintiff from their terrorist watch list to foreign governments with the purpose and hope that \nthose foreign governments will constrain the movement of Plaintiff in some manner.   \n63.  Upon information and belief, Defendants’ intention in disseminating watch list \nrecords,  including  those  of  Plaintiff  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens,  as  widely  as \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.674   Page 13 of 41\npossible is to constrain their movements, not only within the United States, but abroad as well.  \nFor example, some countries detain individuals listed on the federal terror watch list who enter \ntheir borders, question those individuals at the behest of United States officials, or altogether \nprevent those individuals from even entering those countries.   \n64.  Thus, while the TSC maintains and controls the database of suspected terrorists, it \nis the front-line agencies like the TSA that carry out the screening function.  In the context of air \ntravel,  when  individuals  make  airline  reservations  and  check  in  at  airports,  the  front-line \nscreening agency, like TSA and CBP, conducts a name-based search of the individual, including \nthat of Plaintiff, to determine whether he or she is on a watch list. \n65.  While agencies throughout the federal government utilize the federal terror watch \nlist to conduct screening, listed persons are subject to a comprehensive portfolio of consequences \nthat cover large aspects of their lives.   \n66.  Indeed,  Defendants  disseminated  the  federal  terror  watch  list  to  government \nauthorities, private corporations and individuals with the purpose and hope that these entities \nand/or  individuals  will  impose  consequences  on  those  individuals  Defendants  have  listed, \nincluding Plaintiff. \n67.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the  status  of  Plaintiff  and  similarly  situated \nAmerican citizens as known or suspected terrorists on the federal terror watch list diminishes and \neven imperils their ability to access the financial system.   \n68.  Banks have closed the bank accounts of individuals listed on the federal terror \nwatch list and financial companies have declined to allow some listed individuals to make wire \ntransfers. \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.675   Page 14 of 41\n69.  Moreover, upon information and belief, family-based immigration applications \nfiled by Plaintiff and similarly situated American citizens are delayed indefinitely due to an “FBI \nname check” and not adjudicated, thereby denying Plaintiff and similarly situated American \ncitizens of the rights that flow from citizenship, including the ability to sponsor for lawful \npermanent residency immediate relatives living abroad. \n70.  Among the entities and individuals that the federal government disseminates its \nfederal terror watch list are state and local authorities, foreign governments, corporations, private \ncontractors, airlines, gun sellers, car dealerships, financial institutions, the captains of sea-faring \nvessels, among others. \n71.  In fact, in 2015, Christopher Piehota, then Director of the Terrorist Screening \nCenter, gave an exclusive interview to CNN and stated the following, in relevant part: \nIt's  concerning  that  our  partners  don't  use  all  of  our  data.  We \nprovide them with tools. We provide them with support, and I \nwould find it concerning that they don't use these tools to help \nscreen for their own aviation security, maritime security, border \nscreening, visas, things like that for travel.1 \n72.  Defendant Piehota went on to state that the United States shares its federal terror \nwatch list with the European Union, but that European Union countries do not systematically \nutilize it to identify suspected terrorists or screen migrants coming. \n                                                      \n1 First on CNN: Top U.S. intel official: Europe not taking advantage of terror tracking tools, \nCNN, available at: http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/07/politics/christopher-piehota-us-intel-europe-\nterror-tracking/ \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.676   Page 15 of 41\n73.  Upon information and belief, because the names of Plaintiff and similarly situated \nAmerican citizens are included on the federal terror watch list, their names were disseminated to \nstate and local authorities, foreign governments, corporations, private contractors, airlines, gun \nsellers, car dealerships, financial institutions, the captains of sea-faring vessels, among other \nofficial and private entities and individuals. \n74.  Because  the  federal  government  disseminates  its  federal  terror  watch  list  to \nforeign governments, listed persons, including Plaintiff and similarly situated American citizens, \nare often not allowed to enter other nations.  This is because the United States is telling other \nnations, without any modicum of due process, that thousands of its own citizens are “known or \nsuspected terrorists.”   \n75.  The federal government, through Defendants, disseminates its federal terror watch \nlist to state and local police officers which allows those officers to query the names of persons, \nincluding  Plaintiff,  if  for  example,  the  listed  individual  is  pulled  over  for  routine  traffic \nviolations.   \n76.  Disseminating the federal terror watch list to state and local police officers creates \na dangerous situation insofar as the federal terror watch list effectively directs state and local \nofficers to treat thousands of Americans, including Plaintiff, charged or convicted with no crime \nyet listed as a “known or suspected terrorist” as extremely dangerous.   \n77.  With the advent and deployment of automatic license plate readers by police \ndepartments across the country, local and state authorities have relied heavily upon a driver’s \nwatch list status as the basis of a traffic stop, including Plaintiff and similarly situated American \ncitizens. \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.677   Page 16 of 41\n78.  Being  on  the  federal  terror  watch  list  can  prevent  listed  persons,  including \nPlaintiff and similarly situated American citizens, from purchasing a gun.  For example, New \nJersey passed a law in 2013 that banned persons on the federal terror watch list from owning \nguns.   \n79.  Accordingly,  Plaintiff  and  similarly  situated  American  citizens  are  unable  to \npurchase guns in states that ban persons on the federal terror watch list from owning guns. \n80.  Because the federal government conducts a security risk assessment that includes \nquerying the federal terror watch list prior to issuing a license to commercial drivers to transport \nhazardous materials, being on the federal terror watch list can prevent listed persons, including \nPlaintiff and similarly situated American citizens, from obtaining or renewing their Hazmat \nlicense.   \n81.  Being on the federal terror watch list can also prevent listed persons, including \nPlaintiff and similarly situated American citizens, from accompanying minors or passengers with \ndisabilities to their gate, from working at an airport, or working for an airline insofar as listed \npersons are not allowed to enter so-called “sterile areas” of airports. \n82.  Being on the federal terror watch list can also result in the listing of the false \nstigmatizing label of “known or suspected” terrorist on the criminal records of Plaintiff and \nsimilarly situated American citizens, information that is publicly accessible to the general public. \n83.  Being on the federal terror watch list can also result in the denial or revocation of \na Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) license of Plaintiff and similarly situated American \ncitizens. \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.678   Page 17 of 41\n84.  Although TSA, CBP, and other agencies may use the records provided by the \nTSC, it is the TSC that maintains and controls the database of suspected terrorists. \n85.  Two government entities are primarily responsible for “nominating” individuals \nfor inclusion in the terrorist watch list—Defendants NCTC and FBI.  The NCTC, which is \nmanaged by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, relies on information from other \nfederal  departments  and  agencies  when  including  alleged  known  or  suspected  international \nterrorists  in  its  Terrorist  Identities  Datamart  Environment  (“TIDE”)  database.    The  NCTC \nreviews TIDE entries and recommends specific entries to the TSC for inclusion in the watch list.  \nTIDE is the main source of all international terrorist information included in the watch list. \n86.  Defendant  FBI, in  turn, nominates to the watch list individuals with what  it \ncharacterizes as suspected ties to domestic terrorism.   \n87.  Defendant TSC makes the final decision on whether a nominated individual meets \nthe minimum requirements for inclusion into the watch list as a known or suspected terrorist.  \nTSC also decides which screening systems will receive the information about that individual. \n88.  Former Director of the Terrorism Screening Center Healy has testified that in \nevaluating whether an individual meets the criteria for inclusion on the consolidated watch list, \nthe TSC determines whether the nominated individual  is  “reasonably suspected” of having \npossible links to terrorism.  According to the TSC, “reasonable suspicion requires articulable \nfacts which, taken together with rational inferences, reasonably warrant the determination that an \nindividual  is  known  or  suspected  to  be  or  has  been  engaged  in  conduct  constituting,  in \npreparation for, in and of or related to terrorism and terrorist activities.”   \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.679   Page 18 of 41\n89.  Defendants have not stated publicly what standards or criteria are applied to \ndetermine whether an American citizen on the consolidated watch list will be placed on the \nSelectee  List  (“SSSS”)  that  is  distributed  to  the  TSA,  CBP  or  other  screening  agencies.  \nHowever, there is some publicly available information regarding inclusion in the TSDB, of \nwhich the Selectee List is a subset. \n90.  The standards for TSDB inclusion do not evince even internal logic.  Defendants \ndefine a “suspected terrorist” as an “individual who is reasonably suspected to be, or have been, \nengaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism and terrorist \nactivities based on articulable and reasonable suspicion.”  In other words, Defendants place \nAmerican citizens on the federal terror watch list based upon a “reasonable suspicion” that they \nare “reasonably suspected” of nefarious activities.  This “reasonable suspicion” based on a \n“reasonable suspicion” standard does not even contain internal logic.   \n91.  The federal  government utilizes guilt-by-association  as a basis for watch list \ninclusion.  For example, the immediate relative of listed persons can be listed without any \nderogatory information—other than the bonds of family.  Nonetheless, such designation suggests \nthat the immediate relative is himself or herself engaged in nefarious activities.   \n92.  Being a known associate—a friend, colleague, fellow community member, etc.—\nof a listed individual can also provide a basis for watch list inclusion.   \n93.  Even if an American citizen is acquitted of terrorism charges or those charges are \notherwise dismissed, the federal government retains for itself the authority to continue to include \nthem in the watch list.   \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.680   Page 19 of 41\n94.  For reasons unknown, Defendants also place what they call “non-investigatory \nsubjects”  on  the  federal  terror  watch  list,  American  citizens  that  they  have  chosen  not  to \ninvestigate. \n95.  Under these practices and standards, the number of records in the consolidated \nwatch list has swelled.  Over 1.5 million nominations to the watch list have been submitted by \nfederal agencies since fiscal 2009. \n96.  In 2013, Defendant TSC accepted 98.96 percent of all nominations made. \n97.  Because of these loose standards and practices, the federal terror watch list’s rate \nof growth has increased.  In fiscal 2009, there were 227,932 nominations to the watch list.  In \nfiscal 2013, there were 468,749 nominations.   \n98.  Upon information and belief, in 2001, there were 16 people who the federal \ngovernment systematically prevented from flying.  In 2013, that number increased to 47,000. \n99.  Once  an  American  citizen  has  been  placed  on  the  watch  list,  the  individual \nremains on the list  until  the agency that supplied the initial  information  in  support of the \nnomination determines the individual should be removed. \n100.  A 2007 GAO report found that TSC rejects only approximately one percent of all \nnominations to the watch list.2  As such, the watch list is growing at a rate of approximately \n20,000 entries per year. \n101.  At a March 10, 2010 Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing, Russel E. \nTravers,  Deputy  Director  of  the  National  Counterterrorism  Center,  stated  that  “[t]he  entire \n                                                      \n2 See United States Government Accountability Office Report to Congressional Requesters \nentitled Terrorist Watch List Screening:  Opportunities Exist to Enhance Management Oversight, \nReduce Vulnerabilities in Agency Screening Processes, and Expand Use of the List, GAO-08-\n110, October 2007, at 22. \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.681   Page 20 of 41\nfederal government is leaning very far forward on putting people on list,” and that the watch list \nis “getting bigger, and it will get even bigger.” \n102.  The federal terror watch list disproportionately targets American Muslims. \n103.  Almost all publicly known instances of Americans being placed on the watch list \nregard Muslims or persons who could be mistaken for Muslims.   \n104.  Defendants have utilized the watch list, not as a tool to enhance aviation and \nborder security, but as a bludgeon to coerce American Muslims into becoming informants or \nforgoing the exercise of their rights, such as the right to have an attorney present during law \nenforcement questioning. \n105.  Public examples of this phenomenon abound.  See Latif v. Holder, 2014 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 85450, *19 (D. Or. June 24, 2014) (an FBI agent told Steven Washburn that he “would \nhelp remove Washburn's name from the No Fly List if he agreed to speak to the FBI”); Id. at \n*21-22 (FBI agents told Ibraheim Mashal that “his name would be removed from the No Fly List \nand he would receive compensation if he helped the FBI by serving as an informant.”): Id at *22-\n23 (FBI agents offered Amir Meshal “the opportunity to serve as a government informant in \nexchange for assistance in removing his name from the No Fly List.”).  See also Fikre v. FBI, \n2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73174 (D. Or. May 29, 2014) (Emirati officials told Yonas Fikre that he \n“could not travel to the United States by air because he is on the No Fly List” and an FBI agent \ntold Fikre that “the FBI could take steps to remove [him] from the No Fly List if he agreed to be \nan informant.”); Tanveer v. Holder, et. al., No. 13-cv-6951, Dkt. 15 (April 22, 2014) (Naveed \nShinwari “declined to act as an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and to spy on \n[his] own American Muslim communities and other innocent people.”). \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.682   Page 21 of 41\n106.  Additionally, government records show that Dearborn, Michigan—which is 40 \npercent  Arab—is  disproportionately  represented  on  the  federal  terror  watch  list.    In  fact, \nDearborn is among the top five cities in the country, alongside Chicago, Houston, New York, \nand San Diego, represented on the federal terror watch list.   \n107.  Due to Dearborn’s significant population of Muslims, it has earned a reputation as \nthe “Muslim Capital of America.”   \n108.  Defendants’  2013  Watchlisting  Guidance  also  indicates  that  “[t]ravel  for  no \nknown lawful or legitimate purpose to a locus of terrorist activity” can be a basis for being listed.  \nWhile a “locus of Terrorist Activity” is not defined by the document, upon information and \nbelief, it likely includes any place where many Muslims reside. \n109.  The federal terror watch list’s inclusion standards are so permissive and pliable \nand  the  selectee  list's  efficacy  is  at  best  fleetingly  marginal  that  the  inclusion  standards \nthemselves violate Plaintiff procedural and substantive due process. \n110.  The  federal  terror  watch  list  diminishes,  rather  than  enhances,  our  national \nsecurity because the number of innocent Americans on the list is becoming so voluminous that \nthe purpose of having a list is significantly undermined as all are being treated as the same. \n111.  The consequences of being on the federal terror watch list are meted out publicly.  \nMembers of the public can witness the extra screening to which individuals on the federal terror \nwatch list are subject, oftentimes in front of family and colleagues, including being pulled out of \ntheir car at gunpoint, being ordered to leave their vehicle with their hands held above their head, \namong other stigmatizing measures. \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.683   Page 22 of 41\n112.  In practice, frontline screeners disclose the status of individuals on the federal \nterror watch list to state and local authorities, as well as airline employees. \n113.  The operation of the federal terror watch list enlists air carriers to assist the \nfederal government in tracking the passenger on the federal terror watch list. \n114.  Defendants apply the federal terror watch list against Muslim Americans in a \nmanner that is different from how they use their list against people of other faith backgrounds. \n115.  Defendants use impermissible and inaccurate religious profiles in compiling the \nfederal terror watch list. \n116.  Defendants who contributed to the placement of Plaintiff and similarly situated \nAmerican  citizens  on  the  federal  terror  watch  list  knew  that  their  actions  violated  clearly \nestablished federal law. \n117.  Defendants knew at the time they acted unlawfully that Supreme Court precedent \nrequired that, whenever a citizen is deprived of a liberty interest, the federal government must at \nleast provide the deprived with some form of notice that a deprivation occurred. \nThe Federal Government’s Terrorist Watch List  \nIs No More Effective Than a List of Randomly Selected Individuals \n118.  Defendants’ ability to watch list persons who pose a threat of terrorism, can be \nmeasured and described using a quantitative analysis based on factual allegations made in this \nComplaint as well as publicly available information describing the current operation of the \nfederal terror watch list.   \n119.  Upon information and belief, the federal government has placed approximately \none million persons on the federal terror watch list over the last ten years.   \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.684   Page 23 of 41\n120.  Moreover, based on the University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database, a \nproject funded in part by the Department of Homeland Security, there have been less than 250 \nterrorist acts inside the United States over the last decade.  These terrorist acts were perpetrated \nby less than 250 persons.  \n121.  Only one of these perpetrators was designated on the federal terror watch list by \nthe federal government prior to their criminal conduct.  This single person designated on the \nfederal terror watch list, however, was removed from the federal terror watch list prior to \nperpetrating the terrorist attack. \n122.  Upon information and belief, in order to designate a person on the federal terror \nwatch list, the federal government must first have information about that person.  Because the \nfederal government does not possess information on every person in the world, existing law \nenforcement and intelligence practices produce a subset of persons who the federal government \ncan then screen against the federal terror watch list’s inclusion standards.   \n123.  The precise size of this subset is unknown, however a survey of law enforcement \nand intelligence practices indicates that the size of this subset is greater than 50 million people.   \n124.  Upon information and belief, the practices that produce this subset exclude some \npersons who do pose a threat of terrorism and include some persons who do not pose a threat of \nterrorism.   \n125.  Upon further information and belief, the federal government does not screen the \nentire  subset  of  people  known  to  it.    Moreover,  Defendants  do  not  make  individual \ndeterminations as to whether each person about whom they know should be placed on the federal \nterror watch list. \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.685   Page 24 of 41\n126.  In  order  to  designate  a  person  on  the  federal  terror  watch  list,  a  federal \ngovernment official must make a nomination and a TSC official must accept the nomination.   \n127.  Upon information and belief, TSC officials accept nominations at a rate above 95 \npercent.    \n128.  Based on the facts alleged in this Complaint and the publicly known processes of \nthe federal terror watch list, a quantitative analysis can be constructed to measure and describe \nthe performance of the federal terror watch list. \n129.  A quantitative analysis demonstrates that, in order to accomplish the federal terror \nwatch list’s stated objectives, Defendants must have at least some greater-than-random ability to \nidentify future terrorists.  This is due to the nature of the processes Defendants utilize to place \npersons on the federal terror watch list and the size of the population Defendants can—if they so \nchoose—screen against the federal terror watch list’s inclusion standards. \n130.  A quantitative analysis also demonstrates that Defendants’ watch listing system \nwould perform similarly if inclusion on the watch list was done via random selection instead of \nthe existing inclusion standards Defendants utilize.   \n131.  A quantitative analysis therefore indicates that Defendants have no ability to \nwatch  list  persons  whose  placement  on  the  watch  list  would  further  Defendants’  stated \nobjectives.   \nInadequacy of the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program Process \n132.  The government entities and individuals involved in the creation, maintenance, \nsupport, modification and enforcement of the federal terror watch list, including Defendants, \nhave not provided travelers, including Plaintiff and similarly situated American citizens, with a \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.686   Page 25 of 41\nfair and effective mechanism through which they can challenge the TSC’s decision to place them \non the terrorist watch list. \n133.  An individual, including Plaintiff and similarly situated American citizens, who \nhas been prevented or hindered from travel by being placed on the federal terror watch list has no \nclear avenue for redress, because no single government entity is responsible for removing an \nindividual from the list.  The TSC, which is administered by the FBI, does not accept redress \ninquiries from the public, nor does it directly provide final disposition letters to individuals on \nthe selectee list or similarly situated American citizens, who have submitted redress inquiries.  \nThe NCTC which manages the TIDE list does not accept redress inquiries from the public. \n134.  Individuals who seek redress after having been included in the terrorist watch list \nmust submit an inquiry through the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (“DHS TRIP”).  \nDHS TRIP provides individuals with a “Redress Control Number.”   \n135.  DHS TRIP is the only redress “process” available to individuals included on the \nterrorist watch list.   \n136.  DHS TRIP submits traveler complaints to the TSC, which determines whether \nany action should be taken.  The TSC has not provided any publicly available information about \nhow it makes that decision.  The TSC is the final arbiter of whether an individual’s name is \nretained on or removed from the watch list, including those of Plaintiff and similarly situated \nAmerican citizens. \n137.  The TSC makes a determination regarding a particular individual’s status on the \nwatch list, including Plaintiff and similarly situated American citizens, and DHS in turn responds \nto the individual with a standard form letter that neither confirms nor denies the existence of any \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.687   Page 26 of 41\nterrorist watch list records relating to the individual.  The letters do not set forth any basis for \ninclusion in a terrorist watch list, do not state whether the government has resolved the complaint \nat issue. \n138.  The government does not provide an American citizen with any opportunity to \nconfront, or to rebut, the grounds for his or her possible inclusion on the watch list.  As such, \nDHS TRIP offers no meaningful review of the watch list designation and in effect shields the \nTSC’s  actions  with  respect  to  the  individual  nominations  or  classes  of  nominations  from \nmeaningful review by any independent authority. \n139.  Moreover, the government’s own internal audits of the system point to serious \nflaws.  For example, a March 2008 DOJ Office of the Inspector General report entitled Audit of \nthe U.S. Department of Justice Terrorism Watchlist Nomination Processes found significant \nproblems with the nomination and removal process. \n140.  Thus, the only “process” available to such individuals is to submit their names \nand other identifying information to a government entity that has no authority to provide redress \nand to hope that an unspecified government agency corrects an error or changes its mind. \n141.  Plaintiff is a United States citizen.   \n142.  Plaintiff  has  not  been  arrested,  charged,  nor  convicted  of  a  terrorism-related \noffense. \nCOUNT I \nFAILURE TO PROVIDE POST-DEPRIVATION NOTICE AND HEARING IN \nVIOLATION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO PROCEDURAL DUE \nPROCESS \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.688   Page 27 of 41\n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n143.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n144.  Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens learned that he was placed \non the federal terror watch list subsequent to being added on the federal terror watch list and \nsought to challenge such placement. \n145.  Defendants’ actions as described above in refusing to provide Plaintiff and other \nsimilarly situated American citizens with any notice at all of their placement which deprived \nPlaintiff  and  other  similarly  situated  American  citizens  of  constitutionally  protected  liberty \ninterests. \n146.  Defendants’ actions in nominating Plaintiff and other similarly situated American \ncitizens to the federal terror watch list blatantly violate the requirement that “’nominations’ must \nnot be solely based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment \nprotected activities.”  49 U.S.C. § 114(h)(3). \n147.  Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens have a liberty interest in \ntraveling free from unreasonable burdens that are not reasonably tailored within, to, and from the \nUnited States, through land border crossings and over U.S. air space. \n148.  Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens have a right to be free \nfrom  false  government  stigmatization  as  individuals  who  are  “known  or  suspected  to  be” \nterrorists, or who are otherwise associated with terrorist activity, when such harm arises in \nconjunction  with  the  additional  consequences  that  follow  from  being  listed  as  well  as  the \ndeprivation of their right to travel on the same terms as other travelers and/or the deprivation of \ntheir liberty interest under the Fifth Amendment in travel free from unreasonable burdens. \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.689   Page 28 of 41\n149.  Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens have a liberty interest in \nnonattainder  (ie:    the  interest  against  being  singled  out  for  punishment  without  trial).  \nDefendants’ actions have singled out Plaintiff and others similarly situated for punishments that \ninclude, but are not limited to, inability to travel by air and unreasonable burdens placed upon \ntraveling by air to and from the United States, over U.S. air space and at land border crossings, \nand false association with a list of individuals suspected of terrorism. \n150.  Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens, having been burdened or \nprevented from boarding on commercial flights or entering the United States at land border \ncrossings, having had their bank accounts closed, having been prevented from making wire \ntransfers at financial institutions, having had their citizenship applications delayed indefinitely \ndue to an “FBI name check,” having lost lucrative economic opportunities and suffering from \nother forms of financial harm, having been prevented from test driving or purchasing vehicles at \na car dealership, and having sought to challenge their placement on the federal terror watch list, \nare entitled to a constitutionally  adequate legal mechanism that affords them notice of the \nreasons  and  bases  for  their  placement  on  the  federal  terror  watch  list  and  a  meaningful \nopportunity to contest their continued inclusion on the federal terror watch list.  Defendants have \neven  failed  to  provide  the  most  basic  ingredient  of  due  process,  which  is  notice  that  the \ngovernment has deprived a person of their protected rights. \n151.  The Selectee List’s inclusion standard, because it is so permissive and wildly \ninaccurate,  violates  the  plaintiff’s  procedural  due  process  rights  irrespective  of  the  post-\ndeprivation process the defendants create.   \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.690   Page 29 of 41\n152.  Moreover, Defendants have officially imposed on Plaintiff and other similarly \nsituated American citizens the stigmatizing label of “known or suspected terrorists” without a \nconstitutionally adequate legal mechanism. \n153.  Further, Defendants disseminated the stigmatizing label attached to Plaintiff and \nother similarly situated American citizens of “known or suspected terrorists” to state and local \nauthorities, foreign governments, private corporations, private contractors, airlines, gun sellers, \ncar dealerships, financial institutions, the captains of sea-faring vessels, among other official and \nprivate entities and individuals. \n154.  By  imposing  on  Plaintiff  and  other  similarly  situated  American  citizens  the \nstigmatizing label of “known or suspected terrorists” and by failing to provide Plaintiff and \nothers similarly situated with a constitutionally adequate legal mechanism, Defendants have \ndeprived  Plaintiff  and  other  similarly  situated  American  citizens  of  their  protected  liberty \ninterests, including but not limited to their liberty interests in traveling, freedom from false \nstigmatization, and nonattainder, and thus violated the constitutional rights of Plaintiff and other \nsimilarly situated American citizens without affording them due process of law and will continue \nto do so into the future if Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens are not afforded \nthe relief demanded below. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests this Honorable Court grant declaratory and injunctive \nrelief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief this Court \ndeems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT II \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.691   Page 30 of 41\nDEPRIVATION OF PROTECTED LIBERTIES IN VIOLATION OF FIFTH \nAMENDMENT RIGHT TO SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n155.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n156.  Because Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens were listed by \nDefendants in a manner not narrowly tailored to a compelling interest, Defendants’ actions as \ndescribed above in including Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens on a watch \nlist that unreasonably burdens or prevents them from boarding commercial flights or entering the \nUnited  States  at  land  border  crossings,  are  arbitrary  and  capricious,  lack  even  a  rational \nrelationship  to  any  legitimate  government  interest,  and  have  unduly  deprived  Plaintiff  of \nconstitutionally protected rights, including his liberty interests in travel, freedom from false \nstigmatization, and nonattainder. \n157.  Defendants’ actions in nominating Plaintiff and other similarly situated American \ncitizens to the Selectee List blatantly violate the requirement that “’nominations’ must not be \nsolely  based  on  race,  ethnicity,  national  origin,  religious  affiliation,  or  First  Amendment \nprotected activities.”  49 U.S.C. § 114(h)(3). \n158.  By placing Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens on the federal \nterror  watch  list,  Defendants  have  placed  an  undue  burden  on  their  fundamental  right  of \nmovement.   \n159.  By placing Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens on the federal \nterror watch list, Defendants have treated them like second-class citizens.   \n30 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.692   Page 31 of 41\n160.  Defendants’ watch list lacks a compelling interest insofar as their true purpose is \nto provide law enforcement with a tool to coerce American Muslims into becoming informants. \n161.  Defendants’ watch list is also not narrowly tailored insofar as the federal terror \nwatch list are entirely and demonstrably ineffectual and obvious alternatives exist. \n162.  Defendants have placed Imam Abdi on the Selectee List and distributed that list \ninternationally  for  the  purpose  of  deterring  and  constraining  foreign  travel.    Indeed,  the \ndefendants know and encourage foreign governments to deny entry and visas to listees and \ndisseminate the Selectee List to them in order for those foreign governments to do so.   \n163.  Defendants’ actions in placing Plaintiff and other similarly situated American \ncitizens on the federal terror watch list, officially imposing on Plaintiff and other similarly \nsituated  American  citizens  the  stigmatizing  label  of  “known  or  suspected  terrorists,”  and \ndisseminating  the  stigmatizing  label  to  state  and  local  authorities,  foreign  governments, \ncorporations, private contractors, airlines, gun sellers, car dealerships, financial institutions, the \ncaptains of sea-faring vessels, among other official and private entities and individuals, without a \nconstitutionally adequate legal mechanism, are arbitrary and capricious, shock the conscience, \nviolate the decencies of civilized conduct and are so brutal and offensive that they do not \ncomport with the traditional ideas of fair play and decency. \n164.  Because Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens have not been \ncharged with any crimes and are United States Citizens, Plaintiff challenges his placement and \nthe placement of others similarly situated American citizens on the federal terror watch list on a \nbroad, as-applied basis. \n31 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.693   Page 32 of 41\n165.  Plaintiff’s  substantive  due  process  challenge  is  also  facial,  as  there  are  no \ncircumstances where his placement or the placement of others similarly situated on the federal \nterror watch list is narrowly tailored to achieve any compelling government interest. \n166.  Defendants  have  thus  violated  Plaintiff’s  constitutional  rights  and  the \nconstitutional rights of other similarly situated American citizens without affording them due \nprocess of law and will continue to do so into the future if Plaintiff and other similarly situated \nAmerican citizens are not afforded the relief demanded below. \n167.  By placing Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens on the federal \nwatch list, Defendants caused them an actual, imminent and irreparable injury that cannot be \nundone through monetary remedies. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests this Honorable Court grant declaratory and injunctive \nrelief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief this Court \ndeems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT III \nUNLAWFUL AGENCY ACTION IN VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE \nPROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706 \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n168.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n169.  Defendants’ actions in placing Plaintiff and other similarly situated American \ncitizens on the federal terror watch list, officially imposing on Plaintiff and other similarly \nsituated  American  citizens  the  stigmatizing  label  of  “known  or  suspected  terrorists,”  and \ndisseminating  the  stigmatizing  label  to  state  and  local  authorities,  foreign  governments, \n32 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.694   Page 33 of 41\ncorporations, private contractors, airlines, gun sellers, car dealerships, financial institutions, the \ncaptains of sea-faring vessels, among other official and private entities and individuals, without a \nconstitutionally  adequate  legal  mechanism,  were  and  are  arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of \ndiscretion, otherwise not in accordance with law, and contrary to constitutional rights, power, \nprivilege, or immunity, and should be set aside as unlawful pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n170.  Defendants’ actions in nominating Plaintiff and other similarly situated American \ncitizens to the federal terror watch list blatantly violate the requirement that “’nominations’ must \nnot be solely based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment \nprotected activities.”  49 U.S.C. § 114(h)(3). \n171.  Defendants’ failure to provide Plaintiff and other similarly situated American \ncitizens, who have been unreasonably burdened or denied boarding on commercial flights or \nentering the United States across the border and sought to challenge their placement on the \nfederal terror watch list, with a constitutionally adequate mechanism that affords them notice of \nthe reasons and bases for their placement on the federal terror watch list and a meaningful \nopportunity to contest their continued inclusion on the federal terror watch list is arbitrary, \ncapricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  otherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law,  and  contrary  to \nconstitutional rights, power, privilege, or immunity, and should be set aside as unlawful pursuant \nto 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n172.  Because Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens do not present a \nsecurity threat to commercial aviation, Defendants’ actions as described above in including \nPlaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens on the federal terror watch list that \nunreasonably burdens or prevents them from boarding commercial flights or entering the United \n33 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.695   Page 34 of 41\nStates  across  the  border,  are  arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  otherwise  not  in \naccordance with law, and contrary to constitutional rights, power, privilege, or immunity, and \nshould be set aside as unlawful pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n173.  By placing Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens on the federal \nwatch list, Defendants caused them an actual, imminent and irreparable injury that cannot be \nundone through monetary remedies. \n174.  Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens are not required to exhaust \nthe DHS TRIP process, under the holding in Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137 (1993).  See \nUnited States District Court, Eastern District of Virginia, Case No. 11-cv-00050 (2011); Dkt. 70 \nat 22; attached as Memorandum Opinion (Exhibit 4). \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests this Honorable Court grant declaratory and injunctive \nrelief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief this Court \ndeems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT IV \nVIOLATION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES \nCONSTITUTION \n(Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702) \n(Equal Protection) \n175.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n176.  Defendants’ actions in placing Plaintiff and other similarly situated American \ncitizens on the federal terror watch list, officially imposing on Plaintiff and other similarly \nsituated  American  citizens  the  stigmatizing  label  of  “known  or  suspected  terrorists,”  and \n34 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.696   Page 35 of 41\ndisseminating the stigmatizing label to state and local authorities, foreign governments, private \ncorporations, private contractors, airlines, gun sellers, car dealerships, financial institutions, the \ncaptains of sea-faring vessels, among other official and private entities and individuals, without a \nconstitutionally adequate legal mechanism are discriminatory and constitute an action that targets \nreligious conduct for distinctive treatment. \n177.  Defendants’ actions in nominating Plaintiff and other similarly situated American \ncitizens to the federal terror watch list blatantly violate the requirement that “’nominations’ must \nnot be solely based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, or First Amendment \nprotected activities.”  49 U.S.C. § 114(h)(3). \n178.  By placing Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens on the federal \nterror watch list, Defendants have treated Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens \nlike second-class citizens.   \n179.  Defendants’ above-described actions were motivated by the religious status of \nPlaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens and on the basis of the constitutionally-\nprotected free exercise of religion of Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens. \n180.  Defendants’ above-described actions have had a discriminatory effect upon and \nhave  disparately  impacted  Plaintiff  and  other  similarly  situated  American  citizens  who  are \nMuslim American travelers, and not travelers of other faiths. \n181.  Defendants’ above-described actions, policies, course of conduct, or pattern of \npractice that mandate or permit the above-described treatment of Plaintiff and other similarly \nsituated American citizens does not serve a compelling state interest or a legitimate or public \npurpose, nor are they the least restrictive means or narrowly tailored to achieve any such interest. \n35 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.697   Page 36 of 41\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests this Honorable Court grant declaratory and injunctive \nrelief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief this Court \ndeems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nCOUNT V \nVIOLATION OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n(Non-Delegation) \n182.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n183.  Congress has not provided the Executive Branch with intelligible principles from \nwhich the Executive can implement its watch list schemes regarding civil aviation and national \nsecurity. \n184.  Congress has not directed the Executive Branch to create either a No Fly List or a \nSelectee List. \n185.  Congress has not authorized the Executive Branch to utilize the federal terror \nwatch list to encourage financial institutions to close bank accounts or ban wire transfers, to \nencourage car dealerships to restrict test drives or purchases of vehicles, or state and local law \nenforcement to detain individuals based on their watch list status.  \n186.  Congress has not authorized the Executive Branch to disseminate the terror watch \nlist to local and state authorities, foreign countries, private corporations, private contractors, \nairlines, gun sellers, car dealerships, financial institutions, the captains of sea-faring vessels, \namong other official and private entities and individuals. \n36 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.698   Page 37 of 41\n187.  The Executive Branch’s assignment of the watch listing function to TSC violates \nCongress’  directive  that  TSA  determine  who  belongs  on  federal  terror  watch  lists  and  the \nconsequences that flow from being on those lists.   \n188.  Congress has not delegated to TSA the authority to create a process that can \nculminate in the removal of individuals from the TSDB. \n189.  In the alternative, Congress’s delegation to TSA to create a redress process is \ndefective because the Executive Branch has allocated watch list authority in a manner that \nprevents TSA from creating a redress process. \n190.  As a result, Defendants have illegally acted beyond their authority. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests this Honorable Court grant declaratory and injunctive \nrelief in the form described in the Prayer for Relief below, plus all such other relief this Court \ndeems just and proper including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action. \nPrayer for Relief \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests: \n1.  A declaratory judgment that Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs violate the \nFifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Administrative Procedure \nAct; \n2.  An injunction that: \na.  requires  Defendants  to  remedy  the  constitutional  and  statutory  violations \nidentified above, including the removal of Plaintiff from any watch list or \ndatabase that burdens or prevents him from flying or  entering the United \nStates across the border; and, \n37 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00622-DB   Document 16   Filed 11/10/17   PageID.699   Page 38 of 41\nb.  requires Defendants to provide individuals designated on the federal terror \nwatch list with a legal mechanism that affords them notice of the reasons and \nbases for their placement on the federal terror watch list and a meaningful \nopportunity to contest their continued inclusion on the federal terror watch \nlist; \n3.  A trial by jury; \n4.  An award of attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses of all litigation, pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 2412; and, \n5.

PIEHOTA  , et al.,  ) \n) \nDefendants.  ) \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \nPlaintiffs are twenty-five United States citizens who claim they are included in the \nGovernment's Terrorism Screening Database, referred to colloquially as the Government's \nterrorist watch list (the \"TSDB\" or \"Watch List\").  They allege this status subjects them to \nadditional screening when traveling by air or entering the country at a land border or port, and \ncan impact other rights, such as the ability to buy a gun, to work in certain parts of an airport, or \nto obtain the necessary license to transport hazardous materials.  In this action, Plaintiffs \nchallenge their alleged inclusion in the TSDB on the grounds that it violates (1) procedural due \nprocess (Count I), (2) substantive due process (Count II), (3) the Administrative Procedure Act \n(Count III), (4) the Equal Protection Clause (Count IV), and (5) the non-delegation doctrine \n(Count V). Pending before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint \n[Doc. No. 28] (the \"Motion\"). Defendants contend that Plaintiffs' claims are not justiciable, and \nto the extent they are, Plaintiffs have failed to plead facts that make any of their claims plausible. \nFor the reasons below, the Motion will be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. \n\nCaCsaes e1 :21:61-7c-vc-v0-00307652-2A-JDTB-J  F DAo  c Dumoceunmt 1e6n-t 54 7   F  iFleidle d1 10/91/00/51/71 7   P  aPgaegIeD .28 9o9f  2  0P Pagaeg e4I Do#f  29249\nI. BACKGROUND\nBriefly summarized, Plaintiffs allege the following facts in their Amended Complaint, \nwhich, together with all reasonable inferences, are taken as true for the purposes of the Motion:1\nIn September 2003, the Attorney General, pursuant to a presidential directive, \nestablished the Terrorism Screening Center (the \"TSC\") as a multi-agency center for \ncoordinating infonnation pertaining to terrorist activity.  Am. Compl. (ECF No. 22), 51.  The \nTSC, which is administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (the \"FBI\"), manages the \nGovernment's consolidated Terrorism Screening Database, sometimes referred to as the \nGovernment's terrorist watch list (the \"TSDB\" or \"Watch List\"). Id.  The TSC determines \nwhether to place individuals in the TSDB based on \"nominations\" received from the National \nCounterterrorism Center (the \"NCTC\") and the FBI. Two subsets of the TSDB are known as the \nSelectee List and the No Fly List. Id. , 52.  Individuals on the No Fly List are prohibited from \nboarding commercial flights, whereas individuals on the Selectee List are required to undergo \nenhanced screening before doing so. Id.\nPlaintiffs are twenty-five United States citizens who are included in the TSDB.2\nPlaintiffs are all Muslim (or, in the case of Baby Doe 2, born to a Muslim family).  Id. ,i,i 13-37. \n1 Certain of these facts, panicularly some of the statutory and regulatory background, are supplemented, where \nappropriate, with matters of public record. Further background on statutory and regulatory framework is also found \nin the Mohamed opinions cited herein. \n2 \nAlthough the Amended Complaint contains claims and allegations based on the No Fly List, Plaintiffs do not\ncurrently contend that any Plaintiff is on the No Fly List. Plaintiff Mark Amri alleges that he was on the No Fly List \nin January 2016 but that following his request for a review of his status, he received a letter from OHS in September \n2016 stating, \"the U.S. Government knows of no reason, related to your inquiry, that you should be unable to fly.\" \nAm. Comp I. ,i,i 366-76. Plaintiffs also noti fled the Court on January 12, 2017, that the other three Plaintiffs alleged \nto be included on the No Fly List, Ausama Elhuzayel, Donald Thomas, and John Doe No. 4, have received similar \nletters since Plaintiffs filed the Amended Complaint. See Notice of Recent Factual Developments Pertaining to \nPlaintiffs Ausama Elhuzeyel, Donald Thomas, and John Doe No. 4 (ECF No. 43). All four of these Plaintiffs have \nalso been able to fly subsequently. Id. at 2 n.2; Am. Compl. ,r 375. It is plausible based on Plaintiffs' allegations in \nthe Amended Complaint, however, that they remain on the Selectee List and/or the Watch List. \n\nCaCsaes e1 :21:61-7c-vc-v0-00307652-2A-JDTB-J  F DAo  c Dumoceunmt 1e6n-t 54 7   F  iFleidle d1 10/91/00/51/71 7   P  aPgaegIeD .39 0o0f  2  0P Pagaeg e5I Do#f  29250\nAn indeterminate number of Plaintiffs are also on the Selectee List.3  Id.� 52.  Defendants are \nthe Principal Deputy Director of the TSC, the Deputy Director of Operations of the TSC, the \nAdministrator of the Department of Homeland Security's (\"OHS\") Transportation Security \nAdministration (the \"TSA\"), the Director of TSA's Office of Redress, the Director of the NCTC, \nthe Director of the FBI, and the Director of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\"CPB\"). \nId. �� 38-45. \nPlaintiffs, in general, are routinely subjected to additional screening when they fly on a \ncommercial airplane and when they enter the country at a land border or port, although the \nfrequency and invasiveness of that secondary screening varies.  For example, Plaintiff Anas \nElhady (\"Elhady\") is subject to secondary inspection \"every time\" he flies.  Id. 1 142.  Elhady \nalso \"is routinely referred to secondary inspection, handcuffed and detained by CBP at land \nborder crossings when he attempts to re-enter the United States from Canada,\" which can last \n\"approximately four to twelve hours.\"  Id. 1 159. Plaintiff Ahmad Al Halabi (\"Halabi\") is \nsubject to secondary screening \"every time\" he flies; \"is frequently unable to board his flights \nuntil he is 'cleared' by DHS,\" which \"oftentimes takes hours\"; and has missed flights due to \n\"prolonged searches and interrogations.\" Id. 11219-221.  Halabi was also handcuffed by CBP \nofficers when reentering the United States in 2014 through a land border following vacation in \nCanada and detained in a holding cell for approximately two to three hours, and in a waiting area \nfor another three to four hours, during which time the officers confiscated cell phone.  Id. �� 222-\n23. Because of this treatment, \"Halabi no longer travels by air nor does he travel to Canada by\n3 Plaintiffs' allegations include references to both the Watch List and the Selectee List and do not precisely allege \nthat each Plaintiff is on the Selectee List, although all Plaintiffs allege that they are on the Watch List and have had \nsimilar experiences when traveling. Given Plaintiffs' limited access to information concerning the Watch List and \nthe Selectee List, and the Court's obligation to construe the Plaintiffs' allegations in a light most favorable to them, \nthe Court will assume for the purposes of this Motion that all Plaintiffs are alleging the same constitutional \ndeprivations as a result of being included in the TSDB. \n\nCaCsaes e1 :21:61-7c-vc-v0-00307652-2A-JDTB-J  F DAo  c Dumoceunmt 1e6n-t 54 7   F  iFleidle d1 10/91/00/51/71 7   P  aPgaegIeD .49 0o1f  2  0P Pagaeg e6I Do#f  29251\nland unless absolutely necessary for business purposes.\" Id. , 225.  In April 2014, Plaintiff Wael \nHakmeh (\"'Hakmeh\") \"was referred to secondary screening and subjected to a prolonged \ninterrogation\" after his flight home from a business trip to Turkey. Id.,, 250-51.  Since then, \nHakmeh sometimes, but not always, has been subjected to secondary screening when he flies. \nId. ,1254-59.  In August 2016, a TSA agent removed Plaintiff Hassan Fares (\"Fares\") from the \nplane after boarding for his flight and required him to go through security again, even though he \nhad already gone through security, during which time he was ''subjected to extensive searches \nand pat downs.\" Id.  1� 454-56.  These actions caused Fares to miss his flight. Id.  1457. \nPlaintiff Zuhair El-Shwehdi (\"El-Shwehdi\") has been subjected to secondary screening every \ntime he flies since 2011 and \"is frequently unable to board his flights until he is 'cleared' by \nOHS,\" which \"can take hours.\" Id.  11464-65.  \"Frequently, upon returning from a flight,\" El­\nShwehdi \"is escorted from the gate or, on at least two occasions off of the plane from his seat, by \nFBI and/or TSA agents, before he is detained and subjected to prolonged questioning and \nsearches of his person and belongings,\" which has caused him to miss connecting flights. Id. ,, \n466-69.\nBased on their experiences, most of the Plaintiffs have submitted an inquiry with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security's Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (\"OHS TRIP\"), which is \nadministered by the TSA. See, e.g., id.  11226, 239,305.  Under OHS TRIP, travelers who have \nbeen referred for additional screening or delayed or denied airline boarding for any reason, \nincluding because he or she believes she was erroneously placed on the Watch List, can inform \nTSA and request that it review the situation. See 49 C.F.R. §§ 1560.201-207.  If the traveler's \nname is a match or near match with a name on the Watch List, \"TSA, in coordination with the \nTSC and other appropriate Federal law enforcement or intelligence agencies, if necessary, will \n\nCaCsaes e1 :21:61-7c-vc-v0-00307652-2A-JDTB-J  F DAo  c Dumoceunmt 1e6n-t 54 7   F  iFleidle d1 10/91/00/51/71 7   P  aPgaegIeD .59 0o2f  2  0P Pagaeg e7I Do#f  29252\nreview all the documentation and information requested from the individual, correct any \nerroneous information, and provide the individual with a timely written response.\" 49 C.F.R. § \n1560.205(d).  This process includes research and review of information on the Watch List and on \nrelated United States government information systems. At the conclusion of this review, DHS \nTRIP informs the traveler that the process has concluded. While the redress process can result in \nthe correction of erroneous information, the concluding letter neither confirms nor denies \nwhether the individual is on the Watch List or the Selectee List.  However, pursuant to court \norders requiring the Government to provide enhanced procedural protections for United States \nCitizens on the No Fly List, individuals can learn if they are on the No Fly List through the DHS \nTRIP process. Plaintiffs who have submitted DHS TRIP inquiries, other than those who have \nreceived letters informing them that there is no reason they should not be able to fly, have either \nreceived no response as of the filing of the Amended Complaint or have received \nacknowledgement letters neither confirming nor denying their status on the Watch List. See, \ne.g., id. ,i,i 187, 390.\nIn addition to enhanced screening, Plaintiffs have also experienced a number of other \nconsequences, which they have reason to believe are attributable to their inclusion on the Watch \nList. For example, Western Union does not allow Plaintiff Yaseen Kadura to conduct wire \ntransfers, which, on information and belief, is because the TSC informed Western Union that he \nwas on the Watch List. Id. 1 195. Plaintiff Doe 1 's accounts at JPMorgan Chase Bank, TCF \nBank, and PNC Bank were closed without explanation or notice soon after he was first subjected \nto secondary screening while flying, which he believes was based on the banks' being informed \nof his inclusion in the TSDB.  Id ,i1491-93.  On June 30, 2016, when Plaintiff Ibrahim Awad \n(\"Awad\") attempted to test drive a vehicle at a Chevrolet car dealership in Sterling Heights, \n\nCaCsaes e1 :21:61-7c-vc-v0-00307652-2A-JDTB-J  F DAo  c Dumoceunmt 1e6n-t 54 7   F  iFleidle d1 10/91/00/51/71 7   P  aPgaegIeD .69 0o3f  2  0P Pagaeg e8I Do#f  29253\n\"' \nMichigan, a sales associate infonned him that, \"although he was 'not supposed to tell Awad, \nAwad's \"name showed up as being designated on the federal terror watch list\" when the \nassociate input his infonnation in the dealership's system. Id.  11346-47. According to the sales \nassociate, \"Awad was not permitted to test drive or purchase any vehicles until the dealership \nobtain clearance from the FBI allowing him to do so.\" Id. , 348.  Around thirty minutes later, \nthe sales associate told Awad that the FBI sent an email clearing Awad to test drive the vehicle. \nId. ,i 350.  Plaintiff Osama Hussein Ahmed was \"unable to apply for employment at the airport \nwhere his brother was employed,\" as a result of being added to the No Fly List. Id. ,i 211. The \nlocal police treated Plaintiff John Doe 4 (\"Doe 4\") as threatening, which he believes was based \non the TSC disseminating his Watch List status to local police. In particular, Doe 4 saw a \ndenotation, \"Possible Terrorist,\" beside his name on a local police officer's screen when he was \ngiving the officer a witness statement following a minor traffic incident.  Id. ,r,r 540-42.  On two \nother occasions, police officers approached Doe 4's car on traffic stops with guns drawn.  Id. , \n543. Doe 4 was also detained in jail overnight after an officer found an airsoft gun in his car. Id.\n,r 546.  While being fingerprinted at the jail, Doe 4 saw that his paperwork said, \"FBI Hold\" and \n\"no phone,\" and the fingerprinting officer told him \"he must have 'done something really bad to \nget the FBI involved,' and that he 'thinks something is going down.\"' Id. 1 548-49. \nPlaintiffs also allege that inclusion in the Watch List impacts a number of other legal \nrights. For example, they note that under New Jersey law, individuals on the Watch List are \nprohibited from buying a gun, and other states are considering similar measures. Id. ,i 71. \nInclusion on the Watch List can also prevent an individual from obtaining the HAZMAT license \nnecessary to transport hazardous materials, as the Government's security screening includes a \nWatch List-cross reference.  Id.  173.  Similarly, Watch List status can prevent an individual \n\nCaCsaes e1 :21:61-7c-vc-v0-00307652-2A-JDTB-J  F DAo  c Dumoceunmt 1e6n-t 54 7   F  iFleidle d1 10/91/00/51/71 7   P  aPgaegIeD .79 0o4f  2  0P Pagaeg e9I Do#f  29254\nfrom obtaining a job at an airport or with an airline, as there are restrictions on the ability to enter \nthe \"sterile areas\" of airports. Id. ,r 74. Watch List status is also given to courts when making \nbail determinations and can result in the denial or revocation of a Federal Aviation \nAdministration license. Id. 176-77. \nFurthermore,b ased on Plaintiffs' personal experiences,t he publicly available legal \nconsequences of being on the Watch List,g overnment and other publications,a nd the public \nstatements of government officials, Plaintiffs believe their Watch List status is distributed \nbeyond just Defendants' agencies and airlines, including to other government agencies,s tate and \nlocal law enforcement, foreign governments,g un sellers,c ar dealers, financial institutions, and \ncourts. See, e.g., id ,r,r 62-77. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD\nA Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint. See \nRandall v. United States, 30 F.3d 518, 522 ( 4th Cir. 1994 ); Republican Party of NC. v. Martin, \n980 F .2d 943, 952 ( 4th Cir. 1994). A claim should be dismissed \"if, after accepting all well­\npleaded allegations in the plaintiffs complaint as true ... it appears certain that the plaintiff \ncannot prove any set of facts in support of his claim entitling him to relief.\"  Edwards v. City of \nGoldsboro, 178 F.3d 231,244 (4th Cir. 1999); see also Trulock v. Freeh, 275 F.3d 391,405 (4th \nCir. 2001) . In considering a motion to dismiss,\" the material allegations of the complaint are \ntaken as admitted,\" Jenkins v. McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411,4 21 ( 1969) ( citations omitted),a nd the \ncourt may consider exhibits attached to the complaint, Fayetteville Investors v. Commercial \nBuilders, Inc., 936 F. 2d 1462,1 465 (4th Cir. 1991). \nMoreover,\" the complaint is to be liberally construed in favor of plaintiff.\" Id.; see also \nBd. ofTrs. v.

R. Civ. P. 8. Nevertheless, while Rule 8 does not require \"detailed factual \nallegations,\" a plaintiff must still provide \"more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic \nrecitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\" Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \nU.S. 544, 555 (2007) (the complaint \"must be enough to raise a right to relief above the \nspeculative level\" to one that is ''plausible on its face\"); see also Giarratano v. Johnson, 521 \nv. \nF.3d 298. 302 (4th Cir. 2008).  As the Supreme Court stated in Ashcroft  Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,\n678 (2008), \"[a] claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows \nthe Court to draw a reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the conduct alleged.\" \nThe party invoking the court's jurisdiction typically bears the burden of proving the \nexistence of federal subject matter jurisdiction. See Ellenburg v. Spartan Motors Chassis, Inc., \n519 F .3d 192, 200 (4 th Cir. 2008). \"[W]hen a defendant asserts that the complaint fails to allege \nsufficient facts to support subject matter jurisdiction, the trial court must apply a standard \npatterned on Rule 12(b)(6) and assume the truthfulness of the facts alleged.\" Kerns v. United \nStates, 585 F.3d 187, 193 (4th Cir. 2009). \nIII. ANALYSIS\nA. Justiciability\n1. Lack of Jurisdiction\nDefendants contend that the Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims to the extent \nthat Plaintiffs challenge the adequacy of the OHS TRIP process, which Defendants contend \namounts to a TSA order that the courts of appeals have exclusive authority to review under 49 \nU.S.C. § 46110. The Fourth Circuit, however, has rejected this same contention in connection \n\nCCaasese 1 2:1:167-c-vc-v0-000367252-A-DJTB- J  FDAo c  uDmoecnutm 1e6n-t5 4  7 F  i leFdile 1d1 0/190/0/157/1  7 P  a PgaegIDe. 990 o6f   2 P0 aPgaeg 1e1ID o#f  92526\nwith a challenge to the No Fly List. See Order, Mohamed v. Holder, No. 11-1924 (4th Cir.M  ay \n28,  2013). The Court finds no reason not to apply that holding to Plaintiffs' challenge to the \nWatch List.  In that regard, the Fourth Circuit reasoned that placement on the No Fly List \n\"necessarily requires scrutiny of both the TSC's and the TSA's actions,\" and \"49 U.S.C. § 46110 \ngives [ the courts of appeals] broad powers of review over orders of the TSA\" but not \"similar \nindependent authority over the TSC.\" Id at 5. Plaintiffs' claims also \"challenge the inter­\nagency actions of the TSC and the TSA\" and are therefore within the scope of the Fourth \nCircuit's holding and reasoning. See id.; 49 C.F.R. § 1560.205(d) (\"TSA, in coordination with \nthe TSC and other appropriate Federal law enforcement or intelligence agencies, if necessary, \nwill review all the documentation and information requested from the individual, correct any \nerroneous information, and provide the individual with a timely written response.\"). \n2. Standing\nDefendants next contend that Plaintiffs have not adequately established their standing to \nbring these claims. In particular, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not adequately pleaded a \nreal and immediate threat of injury because the facts alleged in the Amended Complaint do not \ncontain sufficient detail from which to infer Plaintiffs' present status on the Watch List and the \nconsequences flowing therefrom (e .g., additional screening when flying or reentering the \ncountry). \nTo establish standing, a plaintiff must set forth specific facts to demonstrate that (1) he \nhas \"suffered an 'injury in fact' ... which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) 'actual or \nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical\"; ( 2) there exists \"a causal connection between the \ninjury and the conduct complained of'; and (3) \"it must be 'likely,' as opposed to merely \n'speculative,' that the injury will be 'redressed by a favorable decision.\"' Lujan v. Defenders of \n\nCaCsaes e1 :21:61-7c-vc-v0-00307652-2A-JDTB-J  F DAo  c Dumoceunmt 1e6n-t 54 7   F  iFleidle d1 10/91/00/51/71 7   P  aPgaegIeD .1900 7o f   2P0a Pgea g1e2I Do#f  29257\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1 992) ( citations and footnote omitted).  Plaintiffs must \ndemonstrate standing for every claim, but a claim is justiciable if even only one plaintiff has \nstanding to raise it. Bostic v. Schaefer, 760 F.3d 352, 370-71 (4th Cir. 2014).  Plaintiffs have \nadequately alleged a constitutional injury in fact.  The Amended Complaint contains sufficient \nfactual detail to infer at this stage that Plaintiffs are presently on the Watch List and face \nongoing, real-world consequences as a result, such as additional screening when they fly or enter \nthe country and the inability to obtain a job at an airport. Therefore, Plaintiffs have standing to \nassert their claims.4\nB. Count 1:  Plaintiffs' Procedural Due Process Claim\nThe Due Process Clause guarantees that \"[n]o person shall be .. . deprived ofl ife, liberty, \nor property, without due process oflaw.\" U.S. Const. amend. V. \"The procedural component of \ndue process imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals of \n'liberty' or 'property' interests within the meaning oft he Due Process Clause.\" D.B. v. Carda/I, \n826 F.3d 721, 741 (4th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). A procedural due process \nclaim requires a plaintiff to show \"( 1) a cognizable liberty or property interest; (2) the \ndeprivation of that interest by some form of state action; and (3) that the procedures employed \nwere constitutionally inadequate.\" Shirvinski v. U.S. Coast Guard, 673 F.3d 308, 314 (4th Cir. \n2012). As a threshold matter, therefore, the government action complained ofm  ust \"deprive \nindividuals of 'liberty' or 'property' interests within the meaning oft he Due Process Clause of \nthe Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment.\" Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332 (1976).  If \n4 The Court also finds that Plaintiffs have alleged facts that make their claims against the CBP plausible at this stage. \nPlaintiffs allege that the CBP enforces and implements the challenged actions of the other Defendants, including the \ndetention of persons on the Watch List for additional screening when they reenter the country at a land border or \nport. and accordingly that the CBP has engaged in the actions that Plaintiffs challenge as illegal. Thus, it is plausible \nthat the CBP may need to be included in any remedial orders. \n10 \n\nCaCsaes e1 :21:61-7c-vc-v0-00307652-2A-JDTB-J  F DAo  c Dumoceunmt 1e6n-t 54 7   F  iFleidle d1 10/91/00/51/71 7   P  aPgaegIeD .1910 8o f   2P0a Pgea g1e3I Do#f  29258\ngovernment deprivation concerns an interest protected by the Due Process Clause, a court must \nweigh three factors to determine what process is due: (I) \"the private interest that will be \naffected by the official action\"; (2) \"the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through \nthe procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural \nsafeguards\"; and (3) \"the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal \nand administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\" \nId. at 335; see also Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210,229 (1990) (\"The procedural \nprotections required by the Due Process Clause must be determined with reference to the rights \nand interests at stake in the particular case.\"). \n1. Government Deprivation of a Cognizable Liberty Interest\nPlaintiffs contend that their inclusion on the Watch List deprives them of the following \ninterests protected by procedural due process: (1) the right of movement, and (2) liberty interests \nunder the stigma-plus test.5  When the Due Process Clause is invoked, the inquiry begins \"with a \ndetermination of the precise nature of the private interest that is threatened.\" Lehr v. Robertson, \n463 U.S. 248, 256 (1983).  For that reason, and as an initial matter, Plaintiffs' broadly \ncharacterized \"right of movement\" fails to adequately describe the liberty interest at stake. \nRather, Plaintiffs' movement-related liberty interests involve the right to travel by airplane or \nreenter the United States without being detained for additional screening. \na. Movement-Related Liberty Interest\nWhile it is undisputed that procedural due process is applicable to certain liberty interests \ncreated by statute, there is no clear test to determine those procedurally protected liberty interests \ns The Amended Complaint also asserts that Plaintiffs have \"a liberty interest in nonattainder (ie: the interest against \nbeing singled out for punishment without trial).\" Am. Compl. � 565.  But Plaintiffs have abandoned nonattainder as \na liberty interest on which to base their procedural due process claim. \n11 \n\nCaCsaes e1 :21:61-7c-vc-v0-00307652-2A-JDTB-J  F DAo  c Dumoceunmt 1e6n-t 54 7   F  iFleidle d1 10/91/00/51/71 7   P  aPgaegIeD .1920 9o f   2P0a Pgea g1e4I Do#f  29259\nthat derive implicitly from the Due Process Clause itself. See Kerry v. Din, 135 S. Ct. 2128, \n6 \n2136 (2015) (Scalia, J. , plurality opinion); id. at 2142 (Breyer, J. dissenting).  The three-justice \nplurality in Din found that procedurally protected liberty interests are those within the historic \nunderstanding of the Due Process Clause and, at most, also include implied fundamental liberty \ninterests for the purposes of substantive due process. See id. at 2133-38.  In contrast, the four­\njustice dissent favored a comparative approach, finding that procedurally protected liberty \ninterests are those \"sufficiently important\" to \"flow 'implicit[ly]' from the design, object, and \nnature of the Due Process Clause.\" Id. at 2142 (alteration in original). One district court to \naddress whether inclusion on the Selectee List triggers procedural due process protections \nconcluded that \"[g]ovemment action implicates the right to travel under the Due Process Clause \nwhen it 'actually deters travel, when impeding travel is its primary objective, or when it uses a \nclassification that serves to penalize the exercise of the right.\"' Beydoun v. Lynch, No. 14-cv-\n13812, 2016 WL 3753561, at *4 (E.D. Mich. July 14, 2016) (quoting Attorney Gen. of N.Y. v. \nSoto-Lopez, 476 U.S. 898, 903 (1986) (Brennan, J., plurality opinion)) (holding that plaintiffs \nhad not adequately alleged a procedural due process claim because, among other reasons, they \nhad not alleged that they were deterred from travel). \nThe Court need not decide at this stage precisely which test determines whether the \ntravel-related liberty interest asserted here is entitled to procedural protection. No matter which \njudicially recognized test is used, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged a procedurally protected \nliberty interest.  In that regard, Plaintiffs allege that their placement on the Watch List or the \nSelectee List subjects them to invasive additional screening and other liberty-constraining \n6 The controlling concurrence in Din did not address this question but rather assumed a procedurally protected \nlibeny interest in finding that the procedures at issues were constitutionally adequate. See 135 S. Ct. at 2139-41 \n(Kennedy, J., concurring). \n12 \n\nCaCsaes e1 :21:61-7c-vc-v0-00307652-2A-JDTB-J  F DAo  c Dumoceunmt 1e6n-t 54 7   F  iFleidle d1 10/91/00/51/71 7   P  aPgaegIeD .1931 0o f   2P0a Pgea g1e5I Do#f  29260\nactivities when they fly or reenter the country at a land border or port. Based on their personal \nexperiences, Plaintiffs further allege that this additional screening can entail their being detained \nfor hours while they are searched and questioned, and that such screening has caused them to \navoid travel. \nTaking these allegations as true, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged at this stage that their \ninclusion in the Watch List or Selectee List caused them to suffer a deprivation of a liberty \ninterest as that term is historically understood. The invasion of that liberty interest is no less \ntangible or unanchored in historical recognition than other interests previously found to deserve \nprocedural protections. See, e.g., Din, 135 S. Ct. at 2143 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (listing \nprocedurally protected liberty interests, including, for example, a student's right not to be \nsuspended from class and a mentally ill prisoner's right not to take psychotropic drugs). \nPlaintiffs also allege that they have actually been deterred from traveling as a result of actual \ndetentions. See Beydoun, No. 14-cv-13812, 2016 WL 37  53561, at *4. Plaintiffs have therefore \nadequately alleged a cognizable liberty interest based on the consequences they suffer as a result \nof their travel. \nb. Stigma-Plus Reputational Interest\nProcedural due process protections also extend to certain reputational injuries under the \nso-called \"stigma-plus\" test. To state a cognizable procedural due process claim under that test, \n\"a plaintiff must demonstrate that his reputational injury was accompanied by a state action that \n\"distinctly altered or extinguished' his legal status.\" Shirvinski, 673 F.3d at 315 (citing Paul v. \nDavis, 424 U.S. 693, 711 (1976)). With respect to the \"stigma\" prong-the reputational injury­\nthe Court previously noted: \n13 \n\nCaCsaes e1 :21:61-7c-vc-v0-00307652-2A-JDTB-J  F DAo  c Dumoceunmt 1e6n-t 54 7   F  iFleidle d1 10/91/00/51/71 7   P  aPgaegIeD .1941 1o f   2P0a Pgea g1e6I Do#f  29261\nThe Fourth Circuit has recognized in at least one case a • constitutional harm' based on \nthe inclusion of defamatory information in a non-public government file if there is a \n'likelihood' of dissemination to the public. Sciolino v. City ofN  ewport News, 480 F.3d \n642,650 (4th Cir. 2007); but see Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341,384 (1976) (the due \nprocess clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not implicated 'when there is no public \ndisclosure' of the allegedly defamatory information and the defendant has no otherwise \nlegally recognized interest at stake).\" \nMohamed v. Holder, No. 1:11-cv-50, 2011 WL 3820711,a t *7 (E.D. Va. Aug. 26,2 011) \n(\"Mohamed f'). Here again, it is unsettled precisely how broadly defamatory information must \nbe disseminated by the government to satisfy the stigma prong. See, e.g., Palka v. Shelton, 623 \nF.3d 447, 454 (7th Cir. 2010) (\"The public-disclosure element requires that the defendant\nactually disseminate the stigmatizing comments in a way that would reach potential future \nemployers or the community at large.\"); Johnson v. Martin, 943 F.2d 15, 17 (7th Cir. 1991) \n(holding dissemination only within the proper chain of command does not constitute public \ndisclosure). The ''plus\" prong must be satisfied by a change in \"a right or status previously \nrecognized by ...l aw,\" Paul, 424 U.S. at 711,n ot simply damage that \"flows from injury caused \nby the defendant to a plaintiff's reputation.\" Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226,2 34 ( 1991) . For \nexample,t here is no stigma-plus claim where the government's actions \"may have affected [the \nplaintiff's] private employment prospects\" in the future but did not result in a changed legal \nstatus such as losing a government job or formally being barred from government contracting. \nSee Shirvinski, 673 F.3d at 315. \nHere,P  laintiffs allege, based on their personal experiences and government and other \npublic reports, that their status in the TSD B has been disseminated to third parties outside the \nrelevant federal agencies and airlines, including state and local authorities, courts,fo  reign \ngovernments,g un sellers, banks,a nd car dealers. Plaintiffs' factual allegations plausibly allege \nthat the dissemination of the Watch List may be so widespread that it is tantamount to public \n14 \n\nCaCsaes e1 :21:61-7c-vc-v0-00307652-2A-JDTB-J  F DAo  c Dumoceunmt 1e6n-t 54 7   F  iFleidle d1 10/91/00/51/71 7   P  aPgaegIeD .1951 2o f   2P0a Pgea g1e7I Do#f  29262\ndisclosure, even if only distributed to other government and private entities that need the \ninfonnation for official objectives.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have alleged facts that plausibly \nestablish the stigma prong.  Plaintiffs also plausibly allege that inclusion on the Watch List \ncauses or substantially contributes to a number of tangible consequences to their legal rights or \nstatus, including, inter a/ia, foreclosing their ability to buy certain guns in certain states, to \nobtain the necessary license to transport hazardous materials, and to obtain certain jobs at an \nai ort.  Plaintiffs have therefore adequately alleged a cognizable, protectable interest under the \nrp\nstigma-plus test. \n2. The Process Due\nThe '\"central meaning of procedural due process\" is that \"[p] arties whose rights are to be \naffected are entitled to be heard; and in order that they may enjoy that right they must first be \nnotified.\" Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 80 ( 1972) (internal quotation marks omitted); see \nMathews, 424 U.S. at 333 (\"The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be \nheard 'at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\"') (quoting Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 \nU.S. 545,552 (1965)); D.B. v. Cardal/, 826 F.3d 721, 741 (4th Cir. 2016) (\"And when the \ngovernment deprives a person of a protected liberty or property interest, it is obliged to provide \nnotice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.\") (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  Plaintiffs contend that because the Government refuses to notify individuals \nwhether they are included in the TSDB, and therefore denies them an opportunity to participate \nin challenging their status, there are effectively no procedural protections. The Government \nconcedes that '\"the existing process does not permit\" individuals \"to learn their status with \nrespect to a watchlist\" but contends that its internal process provides sufficient procedural \n15 \n\nCaCsaes e1 :21:61-7c-vc-v0-00307652-2A-JDTB-J  F DAo  c Dumoceunmt 1e6n-t 54 7   F  iFleidle d1 10/91/00/51/71 7   P  aPgaegIeD .1961 3o f   2P0a Pgea g1e8I Do#f  29263\nprotections from erroneous deprivations, without any opportunity to be heard.

It \"provides heightened protection against government \ninterference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests,\" which are held to a more \nexacting standard of strict scrutiny. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S.7 02,7 19 (1997).  To \nsurvive strict scrutiny,t he government must demonstrate that its interference is necessary to \nfurther a compelling governmental interest and has been narrowly tailored to achieve that \n16 \n\nCaCsaes e1 :21:61-7c-vc-v0-00307652-2A-JDTB-J  F DAo  c Dumoceunmt 1e6n-t 54 7   F  iFleidle d1 10/91/00/51/71 7   P  aPgaegIeD .1971 4o f   2P0a Pgea g1e9I Do#f  29264\ninterest.  Hawkins v. Freeman, 195 F.3d 732, 739 (4 th Cir. 1999).  But the government only \nneeds a rational basis for its interference with non-fundamental rights and liberty interests. Id.\nFor an asserted right to be deemed fundamental for the purposes of substantive due \nprocess, it must be \"objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition, and implicit \nin the concept of ordered liberty, such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were \nsacrificed.\" Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 721-22 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). As \nwith the procedural due process inquiry, \"a careful description of the asserted fundamental \nliberty interest\" is required to make that determination. Id. at 722 (internal quotation marks \nomitted); Flores, 507 U.S. at 302 (\"Substantive due process analysis must begin with a careful \ndescription of the asserted right, for the doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to exercise \nthe utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field.\") (internal quotation \nmarks and alteration omitted). \nWhile Plaintiffs also contend here that their substantive due process claim must be \nassessed based on the general \"right of movement,\" the analysis again calls for a more precise \narticulation of the right at issue. Here, Plaintiffs claim that as United States citizens who have \nnever been convicted of a crime and are not under indictment or subject to arrest for any \nidentifiable conduct, they have the right, anchored in the right to travel, and protected under \nsubstantive due process, to board a commercial airline and enter the country free of \npredetermined additional screening.  But however one characterizes the right at issue, the impact \nof enhanced screening upon that right does not make the government's action impermissible no \nmatter how rigorous the procedural protections for determining who is subjected to such \nscreening.  For these reasons, and those previously stated in Mohamed v.

Count 3:  Plaintiffs' Administrative Procedure Act Claim\nPlaintiffs claim that Defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),5 \nU.S.C. § 706, by placing them in the TSDB \"without a constitutionally adequate legal \nmechanism,\" which Plaintiffs contend was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law. The issues in this APA claim essentially conflate with \nPlaintiffs' constitutional claims, and for the reasons stated above with respect to Plaintiffs' \nprocedural due process claim, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' factual allegations make \nplausible their claim that Defendants' actions were arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. \nCount 4:  Plaintiffs' Equal Protection Claim\nE.\nThe Equal Protection  Clause prohibits the government from \"deny[ing] to any person\nwithin its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S. Const. amend.

To state a claim of unconstitutional \ndiscrimination based on a facially neutral law or policy, a plaintiff must allege facts that make it \nplausible that the law or policy \"has been applied in an intentionally discriminatory manner \" or \n\"has an adverse effect on a protected group, and ...t he adoption of the statute or policy was \nmotivated by discriminatory animus.\"  Williams v.

See Mohamed 11,995 F.S  upp. 2d at 525-26. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs contend that they \nhave plausibly pleaded intentional discrimination with respect to the TSDB based on the \ndisproportionate number of Muslims that are included in the Watch List. Plaintiffs only factual \nallegation in support of that contention is that persons living in Dearborn, Michigan, a town of \napproximately 100,000 residents with a high Arab and Muslim population, are disproportionately \nincluded in the Watch List. Even accepting as true this factual allegation, and recognizing that \ndisparate impact can evidence discriminatory intent in certain circumstances,s ee Sylvia Dev. \nCorp., 48 F .3d at 819, Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to plausibly allege that the \nWatch List was created based on,o r operates through, intentional discrimination. Therefore, \nPlaintiffs have failed to state claim for a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. \nF. Count 5: Plaintiffs' Non-Delegation Claim\nPlaintiffs finally contend that Congress violated the non-delegation doctrine and that TSA\nand TSC exceeded their authority by creating the Watch List. But Congress explicitly directed \nTSA, \"in consultation with other appropriate Federal agencies and air carriers,e stablish policies \nand procedures requiring air carriers ... to identify individuals on passenger lists who may be a \nthreat to civil aviation or national security,\" and ''take . ..a ppropriate action with respect to that \nindividual.\" 49 U.S.C. § 114(h)(3).

Therefore, Plaintiffs have failed \nto state a claim for a violation of the non-delegation doctrine. \nIV.  CONCLUSION\nFor these reasons, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' claims are justiciable, and that \nPlaintiffs have pleaded facts that make plausible their claims that Defendants violated their \nprocedural clue process rights (Count I) and the APA (Count IJI), but have not sufficiently \nalleged that Defendants violated their substantive due process rights (Count II), the Equal \nProtection Clause (Count IV), or the non-delegation doctrine (Count V).

No. 28) \nbe, and the same hereby is, GRANTED lN PART and DENIED IN PART; it is GRANTED as to \nPlaintiffs claims for a violation of substantive due process (Count III), the Equal Protection \nClause (Count TV), and the non-delegation doctrine (Count V), and these claims are hereby \nDTSM[SSED; and it is otherwise DENIED. \nThe Clerk is directed to forward copies of this Order to all counsel of record. \nAlexandria, Virginia \nSeptember 5, 2017 \n20 ",
