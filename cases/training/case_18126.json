    "summary": "<p>Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, 50 U.S.C. § 1881a, permits the Attorney General (AG) and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance targeting the communications of non-U.S. persons located abroad. The government need not establish probable cause that the target of electronic surveillance is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power, nor must the government specify the nature and location of the facilities or places that surveillance will occur. Communications of U.S. citizens and residents are frequently collected \"incidentally\" if those U.S. persons are communicating with or about a targeted foreigner.</p><p>Section 702 requires that the AG, through the Department of Justice (DOJ), and DNI, through the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), submit annual “certifications” that define the categories of foreign actors that may be appropriately targeted. By law, these certifications must include specific targeting and minimization procedures adopted by the AG in consultation with the DNI. These certifications must be approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) before Section 702 surveillance may be conducted. For a more in-depth overview of the certification process, see <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14411\">here</a>.</p><p>This entry describes the 2020 certification, which was assigned to Judge James E. Boasberg. The AG and DNI submitted their annual certifications on October 19, 2020. The court described the certifications as \"largely a status-quo replacement\" of the 2019 certifications. For more information on the 2019 certifications, see <a href=https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17964>here</a>. </p><p>The only \"noteworthy change\" to targeting procedures was that the FBI and NSA had to submit reports of noncompliance to the ODNI Office of Civil Liberties, Privacy, and Transparency rather than (as in prior years) ODNI's Civil Liberties Protection Officer. Judge Boasberg approved the change, noting it had \"no substantive impact\" on the reasonableness of the agencies' procedures. </p><p>The court approved stylistic changes to the government's minimization procedures. The NSA also agreed to restrict employees' access to information it collected that was protected by attorney-client privilege. </p><p>The court stated it would continue to review CIA and NSA reports about the criteria the agencies used to identify targets for surveillance. It also expressed concern that the FBI was using queries designed to retrieve evidence of crimes unrelated to foreign intelligence and had failed to keep proper records. </p><p>After reviewing the agencies' compliance, the court:<ul><li>Extended the 2019 requirements that the NSA limit the amount of data it shared with other agencies; that agencies describe how they use intercepted communications; and that agencies describe steps taken to remove reports that are recalled due to non-compliance with FISA; and</li><li>Imposed additional requirements that agencies report when they delegate authority to make minimization determinations and when they run bulk queries.</li></ul>Government reporting is ongoing, and the next evaluation will be conducted in 2021. </p>",

Authorized  _.no \nusers with access to uruninimized section 702-acquired information should process the results of \nan appropriate query of unminimized section 702-acquired information in accordance with CIA's \napplicable section 702 minimization procedures. \nII.  (U) If CIA determines that it must take action in apparent departure from these querying \nprocedures to protect against an immediate threat to human life (e.g., force protection or hostage \nsituations) and that it is not feasible to obtain a timely modification of these procedures, CIA \nmay take such action immediately. CIA will make a record of the action taken, to include any \nquery term(s) used, and report the action taken to the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence (\"ODNI\") and to the Department of Justice's National Security Division (\"NSD\"), \nwhich will promptly notify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\") of such activity. \nIII. (U) Definitions and Presumptions \nA. (u)  Definitions for purposes of these procedures \n(U)  These procedures adopt the definitions set forth in 50 U.S.C. § 1801 for the terms \n\"foreign intelligence information,\" \"person,\" \"United States,\" and \"United States person.\" \n-€s,ee4-F-)- When used to conduct a query, \"United States person query term\" means a term that \nis reasonably likely to identify one or more specific United States persons. United States \nperson query terms may be either a single item of information or information that, when \ncombined with other information, is reasonably likely to identify one or more specific United \nStates persons. Determining  whether information is reasonably likely to identify one or more \nspecific United States persons in a particular context may require a case-by-case assessment \nby a trained intelligence professional.  \"United States person query term\" is not limited to \nany single category of information or technology.

The term \n\"query\" does not include a user's query of a system that contains unminimized section 702- \nacquired information,  where the user does not receive unminimized  section 702-acquired \ninformation in response to the query either because the user has not been granted access to \nthe unminimized section 702-acquired information, or because a user who has been granted \nsuch access has limited the query such that it cannot retrieve unminimized section 702- \nacquired information.  The term \"query\" also does not include (1) a system user's actions \nsubsequent to conducting a query for purposes of sorting the results of that query based upon \nthe attributes of the information retrieved,2 (2) examining or manipulating, including by \ntechnical means, communications or documents for the purpose of minimizing  such \ncommunications or documents,3 or (3) searches conducted in user activity monitoring \nsystems, as described in CIA's section 702 minimization procedures, so long as the only \nunminimized section 702-acquired information that the searches run against are in records \ncaptured through user activity monitoring. \n(U)  The terms \"Central Intelligence Agency,\" \"CIA,\" and \"CIA personnel\" refer to any \nemployees of CIA and any other personnel acting under the direction, authority, or control of \nthe Director of the CIA, as well as to employees of other U.S. Government agencies who are \nphysically located at CIA and who are granted access to CIA systems to perform duties in \nsupport of CIA operations, but who retain the authorities and responsibilities of their parent \norganization. \nB. (U)  Presumptions for purposes of these procedures \n(U)  The following guidelines apply in determining whether a person whose status is \nunknown is a United States person: \n2 (U)  For example, the action of a system user to sort the results of a query (i.e., the infbrmation actually \nreturned to a system user from a query) by date, time, etc.  \n3 (U)  For example, an analyst might run a script against a spreadsheet that would find and replace all \ninstances of a known United States person's name with a generic term, such as \"U.S. Person l .\" \n* \n2 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page 2 of 5  CIA's Section 702 Quelling Procedures, Oct. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \n(I) (U)  A person known to be located in the United States will be treated as a United \nStates person unless the person is identified as an alien who has not been admitted for \npermanent residence, or the circumstances give rise to the reasonable belief that such \nperson is not a United States person. \n(2) (U)  A person known to be located outside the United States, or whose location is \nunknown, will be treated as a non-United States person unless the person is identified \nas a United States person or the circumstances give rise to the reasonable belief that \nsuch person is a United States person. \n(3) (U)  A person known to have been at any time an alien admitted for lawful permanent \nresidence is treated as a United States person, unless a determination that such person \nis no longer a United States person is made (a) in consultation with the CIA Office of \nGeneral Counsel after obtaining a copy of either an order revoking that person's \nUnited States person status issued by a U.S. federal court or a properly executed and \nfiled United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Form 1-407 (Record of \nAbandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status), or (b) in consultation with the \noffice of CIA Office of General Counsel and NSD. \n(4) (U)  An unincorporated association whose headquarters or primary office is located \noutside the United States is presumed not tO be a United States person unless there is \ninformation indicating that a substantial number of its members are citizens of the \nUnited States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. \nIV. (U) Querying Procedures \nA.  (U)  Query Standard. Each query of CIA systems containing unminimized content or \nnoncontent information acquired pursuant to section 702 of FISA must be reasonably \nlikely to retrieve foreign intelligence information, as defined by FISA, unless otherwise \nspecifically excepted in these procedures. \nB. (U)  Creation and Maintenance of Query Records. \nl.  (U)  CIA must generate and maintain an electronic record of each United States \nperson query term used for a query of unminimized information acquired pursuant to \nsection 702. Such electronic record must, at a minimum, include the following \ninformation: \na.  (U)  the query term(s) used; \nb.  (U)  the date of the query; and \nC.  (U) the identifier of the user who conducted the query. \n2.  (U)  Any use of a United States person query tenn also must be accompanied by a \nstatement of facts showing that the use of that query term is reasonably likely to \n* \n3 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page 3 of 5  CIA's Section 702 Quelling Procedures, Oct. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nretrieve foreign intelligence information, as defined by FISA. CIA shall maintain a \nrecord of each such statement of facts. \n3.  (U)  In the event it is impracticable for a CIA system to generate an electronic record, \nor in the event an unanticipated circumstance arises that prevents the generation of \nsuch an electronic record, CIA must generate and maintain a written record of each \nUnited States person query term that contains the same information required for \nelectronic records, as described above. Before conducting a query in a system that \ndoes not generate an electronic record of a query, CIA personnel must reasonably \ndetermine that conducting that query in a system that generates an electronic record \nwould be insufficient  for technical, analytical, operational, or security reasons. \n4.  (U)  CIA will maintain the query records required by this subsection in a manner that \nwill allow NSD and ODNI to conduct oversight and compliance in an effective \nmaimer. Such records (both electronic and written), to include the statements of facts, \nmust be maintained at least five years from the date the United States person query \nterm was used. NSD and ODNI will review ClA's queries of unminimized section \n702-acquired information using any such query terms to ensure that they were \nreasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information, or were otherwise \nconducted pursuant to one of the exceptions provided below. \nC. (U) Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsections IV.A and IV.B.2 above, nothing in these \nprocedures shall prohibit the lawful oversight functions of NSD or ODNI, or the \napplicable Offices of the Inspectors General, or restrict CIA from providing the \nassistance necessary for these entities to perform their lawful oversight functions, and \nr  nothing in these procedures shall prohibit CIA from conducting queries it determines are \nnecessary to: \n1.  (U)  CIA's performance of lawful training functions of its personnel regarding the \nproper implementation of section 702 and CIA's section 702 procedures. However, \nCIA shall use non-United States person identifiers to perform such queries, unless \nCIA determines that there is a particular need to use a United States person identifier \nin such a query to conduct training on the implementation of an aspect of CIA's \nsection 702 procedures, \n2.  (U)  create, test, or conduct technical maintenance of CIA syn ems that process or \nstore section 702-acquired information,. \n3.  (U)  comply with an order of a court within the United States or a specific \ncongressional mandate, such as a subpoena or similar process consistent with \ncongressional oversight, \n4.  (U)  comply with the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), \n5 U.S.C. § 552, or the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, \n4 \nAuthorized for Public Release Oni April 26, 2021  Page 4 of 5  ClA's Section 702 Querying Procedures, Oct. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \n5.  (U)  conduct vulnerability or network assessments using information acquired \npursuant to section 702 of the Act in order to ensure that its systems are not or have \nnot been compromised, \n6.  (U)  identify information that must be produced or preserved in connection with a \nlitigation matter; or \n7.  (U) perform the following lawful oversight functions of CIA's personnel or systems: \na.  (U) support CIA's investigation and remediation of a possible FISA \ncompliance incident; \nb.  (U) remediate a potential spill of classified FISA-acquired information in \nCIA systems, \nC.  (U) identify FISA-acquired information subject to destruction, including \nunder CIA's section 702 minimization procedures, \nd.  (U) ensure the effective application of marking or segregation requirements \nin CIA's FISA minimization procedures; or \ne.  (U) support CIA's audit or review, for quality control purposes, of work done \nrelated to FISA collection by CIA personnel. \n(U) Should CIA determine that it is necessary to deviate from an aspect of these \nprocedures to perform lawful oversight functions of its personnel or systems apart \nfrom those specified in this subsection (IV.C.'7), CIA shall consult with NSD and \nODNI prior to conducting such a query. NSD shall promptly report the deviation to \nthe FISC. Each such report shall describe the nature of the deviation from the \nprocedures and identify the specific oversight activity for which the deviation was \nnecessary. \n(U)  Consistent with the requirements set forth in subsections IV.B.l, 3, and 4 above, CIA \nmust keep a record of any United States person query term used for a query of unminimized \nsection 702-acquired information in support of the activities described in this subsection \nIV.C. \n41/4ll°I \nDa e  W1LL1.A:M F BARR \nAttorney General of the United States \n5 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page 5 of 5  CIA's Section 702 Queiying Procedures, Of. 19, 2020 ",

(U) These procedures apply to the querying of unminimized information, acquired pursuant \nto section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as amended (\"FISA\" or \"the \nAct\"), by the National Seciu'ity Agency (\"NSA\"), and apply in addition to separate minimization \nprocedures for NSA adopted pursuant to subsection $02(e) of the Act. These querying \nprocedures should be read and applied in conjunction with those minimization procedures, and \nnothing in these procedures permits any actions that would othewvise be prohibited by those \nminimization procedures. NSA personnel who have completed training in these procedures and \nNSA's section 702 minimization procedures may query NSA systems containing unminimized \ninformation acquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act. Authorized users with access to \nunminimized section 702-acquired information should process the results of an appropriate query \nof unminimized section 702-acquired information in accordance with NSA's applicable section \n702 minimization procedures. \nII.  (U) If NSA determines that it must take action in apparent departure from these querying \nprocedures to protect against an immediate threat to human life (e.g., force protection or hostage \nsituations) and that it is not feasible to obtain a timely modification of these procedures, NSA \nmay take such action immediately. NSA will make a record of the action taken, to include any \nquery term(s) used, and report the action taken to the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence (\"ODNI\") and to the Department of Justice's National Security Division (\"NSD\"), \nwhich will promptly notify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\") of such activity. \nIII. (U) Definitions and Presumptions \nA. (U) Definitions for purposes of these procedures \n(U)  These procedures adopt the definitions set forth in 50 U.S.C. § 1801 for the terms \n\"foreign intelligence information,\"  \"person,\" \"United States,\" and \"United States person.\" \n\\fo\"lnlfif\"wTlI 'I\\   When used to conduct a query, \"United States person query term\" means a term that \nis reasonably likely to identify one or more specific United States persons. United States \nperson query terms may be either a single item of information or information that, when \ncombined with other information, is reasonably likely to identify one or more specific United \nStates persons. Determining whether information is reasonably likely to identify one or more \nspecific United States persons in a particular context may require a case-by-case assessment \nby a trained intelligence professional. \"United States person query term\" .is not limited to \nany single category of information or technology.

(U)  Presumptions for purposes of these procedures \n(U) The following guidelines apply in determining whether a person whose status is \nunknown is a United States person:  \n1.  (U) A person known to be currently in the United States will be treated as a United \nStates person unless positively identified as an alien who has not been admitted for \npermanent residence or circumstances give rise to a reasonable belief that such person \nis not a United States person. \n2.  (U)  A person known to be currently outside the United States, or whose location is \nunknown, will not be treated as a United States person unless such person can be \npositively identified as such or circumstances give rise to a reasonable belief that such \nperson is a United States person. \n3.  (U) A person known to have been at any time an alien admitted for lawful permanent \nresidence is treated as a United States person, unless a determination that such person \nis no longer a United States person is made (a) in consultation with the NSA Office of \nGeneral Counsel after obtaining a copy of either an order revoking that person's \nUnited States person status issued by a U.S. federal court or a properly executed and \nfiled United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Form 1-407 (Record of \nAbandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status), or (b) in consultation with the \nNSA Office of General Counsel and NSD. \n4.  (U) An unincorporated association whose headquarters or primary office is located \noutside the United States is presumed not to be a United States person unless there is \ninformation indicating that a substantial number of its members are citizens of the \nUnited States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. \n(U) IV. Querying Procedures \nA.  (U) Query Standard \n(U) Each query of NSA systems containing unminimized content or noncontent \ninformation acquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act must be reasonably likely to \nretrieve foreign intelligence information, as defined by FISA, unless otherwise \nspecifically excepted in these procedures.  Any United States person query term used to \nidentify and select unminimized section 702-acquired content must first be approved by \nNSA's Office of General Counsel. NSA personnel seeking such an approval must \nprovide a statement of facts establishing that the use of any such identifier as a selection \nterm is reasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information, as defined by FISA. \nNSA may approve the use of a United States person query term to query unminimized \n3 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page 3 of 6  NSA's Section 702 Quelling Procedures, Of. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nsection 702-acquired content for no longer than a period of one year, such approvals may \nbe renewed for periods up to one year. Any use of a United States person query term to \nquery unminimized section 702-acquired metadata must be accompanied by a statement \nof facts showing that the use of any such query term is reasonably likely to retrieve \nforeign intelligence information, as defined by FISA. \nB.  (U) Creation and Maintenance of Query Records \n1.  (U) NSA must generate and maintain an electronic record of each United States \nperson query term used for a query of unminimized information acquired pursuant to \nsection 702. Such electronic record must, at a minimum, include the following \ninformation: \na.  (U)  the query term(s) used or approved; \nb.  (U) the date of the query or approval of query tem1(s), \nC.  (U) the identifier of the user who conducted the query or sought approval of \nthe query term(s); \nd.  (U) the statement of facts showing that the use of the query term(s) is \nreasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information, as defined by \nFISA; and \ne.  (U) in the case of content queries, the approving official in NSA's Office of \nGeneral Counsel and duration of the approval. \n2.  (U) In the event it is impracticable for an NSA system to generate an electronic \nrecord, or in the event an unanticipated circumstance arises that prevents the \ngeneration of such an electronic record, NSA must generate and maintain a written \nrecord of each United States person query term that contains the same information \nrequired for electronic records, as described above. Before conducting a query in a \nsystem that does not generate an electronic record of a query, NSA personnel must \nreasonably determine that conducting that query in a system that generates an \nelectronic record would be insufficient for technical, analytical, operational, or \nsecurity reasons. \n3.  (U) NSA will maintain the query records required by this subsection in a manner that \nwill allow NSD and ODNI to conduct oversight and compliance in an effective \nmanner. Such records (both electronic and written), including the statements of facts, \nmust be maintained at least five years from either the date of the query for queries of \nunminimized section 702-acquired metadata, or the date of the approval of the U.S. \nperson query term for queries of umninimized section 702-acquired content. NSD \nand ODNI will conduct oversight of NSA's activities with respect to United States \npersons that are conducted pursuant to these procedures. \n4 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page 4 of 6  NSA's Section 702 Querying Procedures, Oct. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Seclion 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \n5H,LRlLl))1\\IUl!Ul<U\\l \nC.

Notwithstanding subsections IV .A and IV.B. l .d-e above, nothing in \nthese procedures shall prohibit the lawful oversight functions of NSD or ODNI, or the \napplicable Offices of the Inspectors General, or restrict NSA from providing the \nassistance necessary for these entities to perform their law\"fi.1l oversight functions, and \nnothing in these procedures shall prohibit NSA from conducting queries it determines are \nnecessary to: \n1.  (U) NSA's performance of lawful training functions of its personnel regarding the \nproper implementation of section 702 and NSA's section 702 procedures. However, \nNSA shall use non-United States person identifiers to perform such queries, unless \nNSA determines that there is a particular need to use a United States person identifier \nin such a query to conduct training on the implementation of an aspect of NSA's \nsection 702 procedures, \n2.  (U) create, test, or conduct technical maintenance of NSA systems that process or \nstore section 702-acquired information, \n3.  (U) comply with an order of a court within the United States or a specific \ncongressional mandate, such as a subpoena or similar process consistent with \ncongressional oversight, \n4.  (U) conduct vulnerability or network assessments using information acquired \npursuant to section 702 of the Act in order to ensure that its systems are not or have \nnot been compromised, \n5.  (U) identify information that must be produced or preserved in connection with a \nlitigation matter, or \n6.  (U) perform the following lawful oversight functions orSA's  personnel or systems: \na.  (U) support NSA's investigation and remediation of a possible section 702 \ncompliance incident, \nb.  (U) remediate a potential spill of classified section 702-acquired information \nin NSA systems, \nc.

Before conducting a query in a \nsystem that does not generate an electronic record of a query, NCTC personnel must \nreasonably determine that conducting that query in a system that generates an \nelectronic record would be insufficient for technical, analytical, operational, or \nsecurity reasons. \n4.  (U) NCTC will maintain the query records required by this subsection in a manner \nthat will allow NSD and ODNI to conduct oversight and compliance in an effective \nmanner. Such records (both electronic and written), to include the statements of facts, \nmust be maintained at least five years from the date the United States person query \nterm was used.  NSD and ODNI will review NCTC's queries of unminimized section \n702-acquired information using any such query terms to ensure that they were \nreasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information, or were otherwise \nconducted pursuant to one of the exceptions provided below. \nC.  (U) Exceptions.  Notwithstanding subsections IV.A and IV.B.2 above, nothing in these \nprocedures shall prohibit the lawful oversight functions of NSD or ODNI, or the \napplicable Offices of the Inspectors General, or restrict NCTC from providing the \nassistance necessary for these entities to perform their lawful oversight functions, and \nnothing in these procedures shall prohibit NCTC from conducting queries it determines \nare necessary to: \nl.  (U) NCTC's performance of lawful training filnctions of its personnel regarding the \nproper implementation of section 702 and NCTC's section 702 procedures. \nHowever, NCTC shall use non-United States person identifiers to perform such \nqueries, unless NCTC determines that there is a particular need to use a United States \nperson identifier in such a query to conduct training on the implementation of an \naspect otlNCTC's section 702 procedures; \n2.  (U)  create, test, or conduct technical maintenance of NCTC systems that process or \nstore section 702-acquired information, \n3.  (U) comply with an order of a court within the United States or a specific \ncongressional mandate, such as a subpoena or similar process consistent with \ncongressional oversight, \n4.  (U) comply with the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), \n5 U.S.C. § 552, or the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, \n4 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page 4 of 5  NCTC's Section 702 Quelling Procedures, Of. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \n1  1r '\\  T \n5.  (U)  conduct vulnerability  or network assessments using information acquired \npursuant to section 702 of the Act in order to ensure that its systems are not or have \nnot been compromised, \n6.

(U) ensure the effective application of marking or segregation requirements \nin NCTC's FISA minimization procedures, or \ne.  (U) support NCTC's audit or review, for quality control purposes, of work \ndone related to FISA collection by NCTC personnel. \n(U) Should NCTC determine that it is necessary to deviate from an aspect of these \nprocedures to perform lawful oversight functions of its personnel or systems apart \nfrom those specified in this subsection (IV.C.7), NCTC shall consult with NSD and \nODNI prior to conducting such a query. NSD shall promptly report the deviation to \nthe FISC.  Each such report shall describe the nature of the deviation from the \nprocedures and identify the specific oversight activity for which the deviation was \nnecessary. \n(U)  Consistent with the requirements set forth in subsections IV.B.1, 3, and 4 above, NCTC \nmust keep a record of any United States person query term used for a query of unminimized \nsection 702-acquired information in support of the activities described in this subsection \nIV.C. \n,/.w \nDate  WILLIAM P.

See  Docket  Nos \n      \nThose  dockets, \ntogether  with  Docket  Numbers  are  collectively \nreferred  to  as  “the  Prior  702  Dockets.” \nThe  government  also  seeks  approval  of amendments  to  the  certifications  in  the  Prior  702 \nDockets,  such  that  NSA,  the  CIA,  the  FBI,  and  NCTC  henceforward  would  apply  the  same \nminimization  and  querying  procedures  to  information  obtained  under  prior  certifications  as  they \nwould  to  information  to  be  obtained  under  the  2020  Certifications.

See \nBA  The  statement  described  in  §  702(h)(2)(E)  is  not  required  because  there  was  no \n“exigent  circumstances”  determination  under  §  702(c)(2).) \nThe  Court,  accordingly,  concludes  that  the  2020  Certifications  contain  all  the  required \nstatutory  elements.  Similarly,  it  has  reviewed  the  certifications  in  the  Prior  702  Dockets,  as \namended  by  the  2020  Certifications,  and  finds  that  they  also  contain  all  the  elements  required  by \nthe  statute.  Those  amendments  have  the  same  effective  dates  as  the  2020  Certifications.  See \nThe  requisite  procedural  boxes  having  been  checked,  the  Court  moves  on  to  proposed \ntargeting,  querying,  and  minimization  procedures.  The  following  discussion  primarily  focuses  on \nproposed  changes  to  the  previously  approved  procedures,  but  the  procedures  as  a  whole  must  be \nconsistent  with  statutory  and  constitutional  requirements.  Some  technical,  conforming  edits  and \nother  changes  are  not  specifically  discussed  because  they  raise  no  issues  material  to  the  Court’s \n“FOP SECREFASTOREOHNOFORN  Page  6 \n  \n Authorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 6   of 67  FISC Opinion,  Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \n“FOP SECRET STOR CO  TW NOTOR \nreview  (to  include  changes  to  the  Executive  Branch’s  classification  determinations  with  respect \nto  certain  portions  of the  procedures). \nIf.  THE  TARGETING  PROCEDURES \nTargeting  procedures  must  be  “reasonably  designed”  to  “ensure  that  any  acquisition \nauthorized  under  [§  702(a)]  is  limited  to  targeting  persons  reasonably believed  to  be  located \noutside  the  United  States”  and  to  “prevent  the  intentional  acquisition  of any  communication  as  to \nwhich  the  sender  and  all  intended  recipients  are  known  at  the  time  of the  acquisition  to  be  located \nin  the  United  States.”  §  702(d)(1);  see  also  §  702(b)(1)  (acquisitions  “‘may  not  intentionally \n  \ntarget  any  person  known  at  the  time  of acquisition  to  be  located  in  the  United  States”);  § \n702(b)(4)  (acquisitions  “may  not  intentionally  acquire  any  communication  as  to  which  the  sender \nand  all  intended  recipients  are  known  at  the  time  of acquisition  to  be  located  in  the  United \nStates”).  Additionally,  the  government  uses  the  targeting  procedures  to  ensure  that  acquisitions \ndo  “not  intentionally  target  a  United  States  person  reasonably  believed  to  be  located  outside  the \nUnited  States.”  §  702(b)(3).  Pursuant  to  §  702(j)(2)(B),  the  Court  assesses  whether  the  targeting \nprocedures  satisfy  those  criteria.  It  must  also  determine  whether  such  procedures,  along  with  the \nquerying  and  minimization  procedures,  are  consistent  with  the  requirements  of the  Fourth \nAmendment.  See§   702(j)(3)(A)-(B). \nA,  Background  on  Acquisition  and  Targeting  Under  Section  702 \nThe  government  targets  a  person  under  Section  702  by  tasking  for \nacquisition  one  or  more  selectors  (e.g.,  identifiers  for  email  or  other \nelectronic-communication accounts) associated with that person.  Section  702 \nencompasses  different  forms  of acquisition.  The  government  may  acquire \ninformation  “upstream,”  as  it  transits  the  facilities  of an  Internet  backbone \n“FOP SECRET SH ORCOMNOTOR  Page  7 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 7 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re:  Section  702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nO“FORR SCECROET NSI NOTOR \ncarrier,  as  well  as  “downstream,”  from  systems  operated  by  providers  of \nservices     EE  (:aditional  telephone  communications \nmay  also  be  acquired  upstream... . \nem.  Op.  and  Order,  Oct.  18, \n2018,  at  11  (citation  omitted)  (“October  18,  2018,  Opinion”). \nNSA  is  the  lead  agency  in  making  targeting  decisions  under  Section  702.  It  may \nnot  task  a  selector  without  first  determining  that  the  target  is  reasonably  believed  to  be  a \nnon-U.S.  person  outside  the  United  States  (a  “foreignness  determination”).  In  making \nsuch  determinations,  NSA  reviews  certain  categories  of information  about  the  proposed \ntarget  and  evaluates  “the  totality  of the  circumstances  based  on  the  information  available \n     \nwith  respect  to  that  person, \n   \n     \nNSA  Targeting  Procedures  §  I  at  1.  An  NSA  targeting \ndecision  must  also  be  supported  by  a  “particularized  and  fact-based”  assessment  that  “the \ntarget  is  expected  to  possess,  receive,  and/or  is  likely  to  communicate  foreign  intelligence \ninformation”  relevant  to  the  subject  matter  of an  authorized  Section  702  certification.  Id. \nat  4. \nNSA  is  also  required  to  conduct  post-targeting  analysis  “to  detect  those  occasions \nwhen  a  person  who  when  targeted  was  reasonably  believed  to  be  located  outside  the \nUnited  States  is  located  in  the  United  States.”  NSA  Targeting  Procedures  §  II  at  7.  This \npost-targeting  analysis  involves  routinely  comparing  each  tasked  selector  against \nindependently  acquired  information  for  indications  that  a  tasked  selector  may  be  used \nFOR SECRETS HORECONROFORA—  Page  8 \n  \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 8 of 67  FISC Opinion,  Nov.  18, 2020\n  \nDocument re:  Section  702 2020 Certification  Authonzed for Public Release by ODNI \ninside  the  United  States,  and  examination  of the  content  of communications  obtained \nthrough  surveillance  ofa   tasked  selector  for  indications  that  a  targeted  person  is  now  in, \nor  may  enter,  the  United  States.

The  implementation of  those  revised  procedures \nis  discussed  in  Part  VI  below. \nB.  NSA  Targeting  Procedures \nOnly  one  noteworthy  change  is  proposed  to  NSA’s  Targeting  Procedures.  Certain \nnotices  that  were  previously  required  to  be  sent  by  NSA  to  the  Office  of  the  Director  of \nNational  Intelligence  Civil  Liberties  Protection  Officer  (ODNI  CLPO)  are  now  required \nto  be  sent  to  the  ODNI  Office  of Civil  Liberties,  Privacy  and  Transparency.  The  required \nreports  relate  to  certain  incidents  of noncompliance  and  incidents  in  which  a  person \nreasonably  believed  to  be  located  outside  the  United  States,  and  targeted  under \nSection  702,  is  later  determined  to  be  inside  the  United  States,  or  an  individual  reasonably \nbelieved  to  be  a  non-United  States  person  is  later  assessed  to  be  a  United  States  person. \nSee  NSA  Targeting  Procedures  §  IV  at  10. \ncma  anhalt  hasan  Page  10 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page  10 of 67   FISC Opinion ,  Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nFSOERC REFSHORCONMAOFORT— \nThe  government  states  that  this  change  was  merely  “to  make  clear  where  reporting \nwill  be  directed.”  Oct.  19,  2020,  Memorandum  at  5.

Thus,  as  the  Court  understands \nit,  there  is  no  actual  broadening  of the  universe  of people  who  would  have  access  to  the \nreports  at  issue.  The  procedures  simply  now  acknowledge  that  these  reports  are  made  to \nthe  office  within  ODNI  that  is  charged  with  the  protection  of privacy  and  civil  liberties, \nwhich  the  Court  finds  entirely  appropriate.  This  change  has  no  substantive  impact  on  the \noverall  reasonableness  of the  NSA  procedures. \nCc.  FBI  Targeting  Procedures \nLikewise,  the  only  noteworthy  change  to  the  FBI  Targeting  Procedures  is  that  the \nFBI  is  now  required  to  report  incidents  of noncompliance  with  its  targeting  procedures  to \nthe  ODN]  Office  of Civil  Liberties,  Privacy  and  Transparency,  rather than  the  ODNI \nCLPO.  See  FBI  Targeting  Procedures  §  III.15.  Again,  the  government  characterizes  this \nas  a  Clarifying  edit,  see  Oct.  19,  2020,  Memorandum  at  5,  and  the  Court  finds  that  it  has \nno  impact  on  the  overall  reasonableness  of the  FBI  procedures. \nD.  Conclusion \nThis  Court  has  previously  found  the  current  versions  of the  FBI  and  NSA’s \ntargeting  procedures  to  comply with  statutory requirements.  See  Dec.  6,  2019,  Opinion  at \n23,78.  The  modest  changes  to  those  procedures  discussed  above  have  no  substantive \nimpact  on  it’s  prior  conclusions  in  this  regard.  The  Court  concludes,  accordingly,  that  the \nafte  Page  11 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 11  of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \n—POR-SECREESHORCOMAGEOAR   \n2020  NSA  Targeting  Procedures  and  the  2020  FBI  Targeting  Procedures,  as  written,  are \nreasonably  designed,  as  required  by  Section  702(d)(1),  to:  (1)  ensure  that  any  acquisition \nauthorized  under  the  2020  Certifications  is  limited  to  targeting  persons  reasonably \nbelieved  to  be  located  outside  the  United  States,  and  (2)  prevent the  intentional \nacquisition  of any  communication  as  to  which  the  sender  and  all  intended  recipients  are \nknown  at  the  time  of the  acquisition  to  be  located  in  the  United  States.  For  the  reasons \nstated  above  and  in  the  Court’s  opinions  in  the  Prior  702  Dockets,  moreover,  it  concludes \nthat  the  NSA  and  FBI  Targeting  Procedures,  as  written,  are  reasonably  designed  to \nprevent  United  States  persons  from  being  targeted  for  acquisition  —  a  finding  that  is \nrelevant  to  the  Court’s  analysis  of whether  those  procedures  are  consistent  with  the \nrequirements  of the  Fourth  Amendment.  See  pages  31-35  infra. \nIV.  THE  MINIMIZATION  PROCEDURES  AND  QUERYING  PROCEDURES \nPursuant  to  §  702(j)(2)(C),  the  Court  must  also  assess  whether  the  minimization \nprocedures  comply  with  specified  statutory requirements.  Section  702(e)(1)  requires  that \nthe  procedures  “meet  the  definition  of minimization  procedures  under  [50  U.S.C. \n§  1801(h)  or  1821(4)].”  That  definition  requires \n(1)  specific  procedures  .  .  .  that  are  reasonably  designed  in  light  of  the \npurpose  and  technique  of the  particular surveillance  [or physical  search],  to \nminimize  the  acquisition  and  retention,  and  prohibit  the  dissemination,  of \nnonpublicly  available  information  concerning  unconsenting  United  States \npersons consistent with  the need of the United  States  to obtain,  produce,  and \ndisseminate  foreign  intelligence  information; \n(2)  procedures  that  require  that  nonpublicly  available  information,  which  is \nnot  foreign  intelligence  information,  as  defined  in  [50  U.S.C.  §  1801(e)(1)], \n“FOR SECREFSHORECONNOFORR—  Page  12 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 12 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nSORREEE O ER \nshall  not  be  disseminated  in  a  manner  that  identifies  any  United  States \nperson,  without  such  person’s  consent,  unless  such  person’s  identity  is \nnecessary  to  understand  foreign  intelligence  information  or  assess  its \nimportance;  [and] \n(3)  notwithstanding  paragraphs  (1)  and  (2),  procedures  that  allow  for  the \nretention and  dissemination of information  that is  evidence  of a crime which \nhas  been,  is  being,  or  is  about  to  be  committed  and  that  is  to  be  retained  or \ndisseminated  for  law  enforcement  purposes[.] \n§  1801(h).  The  definition  of “minimization  procedures”  at  §  1821(4)  is  substantively \nidentical  to  the  definition  at  §  1801(h)  (although  §  1821(4)(A)  refers  to  “the  purposes  ..  . \nof the  particular  physical  search”).  For  simplicity,  subsequent  citations  refer  only to \n§  1801(h). \nIn  applying  these  statutory requirements,  the  Court  is  mindful  that  Section  702 \nacquisitions  target  persons  reasonably believed  to  be  non-U.S.  persons  outside  the  United \nStates.  Although  such  targets  may  communicate  with  or  about  U.S.  persons,  Section  702 \nacquisitions,  as  a  general  matter,  are  less  likely to  acquire  information  about  U.S.  persons \nthat  is  unrelated  to  the  foreign-intelligence  purpose  of the  acquisition  than,  for  example, \nelectronic  surveillance  or physical  search  of a  home  or  workplace  within  the  United \nStates  that  a  target  shares  with  U.S.  persons.  Different  minimization  protections, \naccordingly,  may  be  appropriate  for  other  forms  of collection  that  are  directed  at  persons \nwithin  the  United  States. \nThe  AG,  in  consultation  with  the  DNI,  also  must  “adopt  querying  procedures \nconsistent  with  the  requirements  of the  fourth  amendment .  .  .  for  information  collected” \npursuant  to  a  Section  702  certification,  see  §  702(f)(1)(A),  and  must  “ensure”  that  those \ner  Page  13 \nAuthonized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 13 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nTOP SECRET STOR CONNOTORIN \nprocedures  “include  a  technical  procedure  whereby  a  record  is  kept  of each  United  States \nperson  query  term  used  for  a  query.”  §  702(f)(1)(B).  The  FISC  must  determine  whether \nquerying procedures  satisfy the  requirements  of §  702(f)(1).  See  §  702(j)(3)(A)-(B). \nEach  agency’s  procedures  make  clear  that  the  querying  and  minimization \nprocedures  are  to  be  read  and  applied  together.  See, e.g., NSA  Querying  Procedures  §  I \n(“These  querying  procedures  should be  read  and  applied  in  conjunction  with  [the \nseparate]  minimization  procedures,  and  nothing  in  these  procedures  permits  any  actions \nthat  would  otherwise  be  prohibited  by  those  minimization  procedures.”);  FBI  Querying \nProcedures  §  I  (same);  NSA  Minimization  Procedures  §  I  (“These  minimization \nprocedures  apply  in  addition  to  separate  querying  procedures.  .  .  .  [They]  should  be  read \nand  applied  in  conjunction  with  those  querying  procedures,  and  nothing  in  these \nprocedures  permits  any  actions  that  would  otherwise  be  prohibited  by  those  querying \nprocedures.”);  FB]  Minimization  Procedures  §  J.A  (same).  The  Court  will,  as  a  result, \nalso  assess  whether  each  agency’s  querying  procedures,  in  conjunction  with  the \nminimization  procedures,  satisfy  the  standard  of §  1801(h). \nA.  Background  on  Section  702  Minimization  and  Queryin \nEach  agency  with  access  to  “raw,”  or  unminimized,  information  obtained  under \nSection  702  (NSA,  FBI,  CIA,  and  NCTC)  is  governed  by  its  own  set  of minimization \nprocedures  in  handling  that  information.  This  opinion  uses  the  terms  “raw”  and \n“unminimized”  interchangeably.  The  NCTC  Minimization  Procedures  define  “raw” \ninformation  as: \nairline  eam  Page  14 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 14 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authonzed for Public Release by ODNI \n“FOR SFEREF SHOR CONMNOFO Re \nsection  702-acquired  information  that  (i)  is  in  the  same  or  substantially  the \nsame  format  as when  NSA  or FBI acquired  it,  or (ii)  has  been processed only \nas  necessary to render it  into a  form  in  which  it can be evaluated  to determine \nwhether  it reasonably appears  to  be  foreign  intelligence  information  or to  be \nnecessary  to  understand  foreign  intelligence  information  or  assess  its \nimportance. \nNCTC  Minimization  Procedures  §  A.3.d. \nThere  are  significant  differences  among  the  various  sets  of minimization \nprocedures  based  on  factors  such  as  the  agencies’  differing  missions,  legal  and  policy \nconstraints,  and  technical  infrastructure,  but they  share  several  important  features  in \ncommon.  Regarding  acquisition,  NSA  is  required  to  conduct  acquisitions  “in  a  manner \ndesigned,  to  the  greatest  extent  reasonably  feasible,  to  minimize  the  acquisition  of \ninformation  not  relevant  to  the  authorized  purpose  of the  acquisition.”  NSA \nMinimization  Procedures  §  4(a).  The  FBI  must  follow  its  targeting  procedures  in \nconducting  acquisitions.  See  FBI  Minimization  Procedures  §  II.A.1.  (As  discussed \nabove,  NSA  and  the  FBI  are  the  only  agencies  that conduct  Section  702  acquisitions,  and \nthe  FBI  applies  its  targeting  procedures  to,  and  acquires  data  for,  only  selectors  that  NSA \nhas  approved  for tasking  under  its  targeting  procedures.  See pages  7-10  supra). \nPost-acquisition,  in  broad  outline,  each  agency’s  procedures: \n°  set  criteria  for  the  indefinite  retention  of information  of or  concerning \nUnited  States  persons  and  generally  applicable  timetables  for  destroying \ninformation  that  does  not  meet  those  criteria,  see  NSA  Minimization \nProcedures  §  4;  FBI]  Minimization  Procedures  §§  III.C.1.b,  I1.D.4,  I.E.4; \nCIA  Minimization  Procedures  §§  2,  3;  NCTC  Minimization  Procedures  §§ \nB.2,  B.3; \nett  ttt ett  Page  15 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 15 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nretret iitt teetie \n°  provide  special  rules  for  protecting  attorney-client  communications,  see \nNSA  Minimization  Procedures  §  5;  FBI  Minimization  Procedures  §§ \nI1I.D.5,  [l.E.6;  CIA  Minimization  Procedures  §  7.a;  NCTC  Minimization \nProcedures  §  C.5; \n°  set  standards  and  procedures  for  disseminating  information,  see  NSA \nMinimization  Procedures  §§  6,  7(b);  FBI  Minimization  Procedures  §  IV; \nCIA  Minimization  Procedures  §§  5,  7.c;  NCTC  Minimization  Procedures \n§  D;  and \n°  prescribe  procedures  for  obtaining  technical  or  linguistic  assistance  from \nother  agencies  and/or  from  foreign  governments,  see  NSA  Minimization \nProcedures  §  9(b);  FBI  Minimization  Procedures  §  IV.D;  CIA \nMinimization  Procedures  §  7.b;  NCTC  Minimization  Procedures  §  D.5. \nThe  procedures  also  speak  to  situations  in  which  the  government  reasonably \nbelieved  at  the  time  of acquisition  that  the  target  was  a  non-U.S.  person  outside  the \nUnited  States,  but  when  the  target  was  in  fact  a  U.S.  person  or  was  inside  the  United \nStates.  The  Court  has  concluded  that  the  government  is  authorized  to  acquire  such \ncommunications  under  Section  702.  See  Sept.  4,  2008,  Opinion  at  25-27.  Nonetheless, \nthe  procedures  of each  agency  require  destruction  of information  obtained  under  those \ncircumstances,  unless  the  head  of the  agency  authorizes  its  retention  after  making  certain \nfindings  for  the  specific  information  to  be  retained.  See  NSA  Minimization  Procedures  § \n4(d);  FBI  Minimization  Procedures  §  II.A.3;  CLA  Minimization  Procedures  §  8;  NCTC \nMinimization  Procedures  §  B.4. \nIn  addition,  each  agency’s  querying procedures  contain  recordkeeping \nrequirements  for the  use  of U.S.-person  query terms  in  response  to  §  702(f)(1)(B).

Their  FBI  counterparts  may  conduct  such  queries  if \nthey  are  reasonably  likely  to  return  foreign-intelligence  information  or  evidence  of a \ncrime.

See  Oct.  19,  2020,  Memorandum  at  3  n.3.  Changes  to  the  FBI \nMinimization  Procedures  are  limited  to  an  updated  statutory  citation  and  classification \nmarkings.  Nothing  detracts  from  the  Court’s  earlier  findings  that  these  procedures  as \nwritten  are  statutorily  and  constitutionally  sufficient.  Proposed  substantive  changes  to  the \nNCTC  minimization  procedures  and  NCTC  and  NSA  querying  procedures  are  discussed \nin  the  following  sections  B,  C,  and  D,  respectively.  Section  E  addresses  clarifications \nmade  by  the  government  regarding  its  interpretation  of provisions  of the  NSA,  CIA,  and \nNCTC  minimization  procedures  relating  to  the  retention  and  internal  handling  of \nattorney-client  privileged  communications. \n— FOP SECREFHSHHORECONNOFORN——  Page  17 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 17 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nSOP  REESHOR EOF \nB.  NCT  inimization  ures \nThe  government  proposes  to  change  all  references  to  “NCTC  employees”  in \nNCTC’s  minimization  procedures  to  “NCTC  personnel.”  The  NCTC  procedures \npreviously  defined  the  term  “NCTC  employee”  to  include: \n(i)  individuals  directly employed by NCTC,  (ii) personnel  detailed  to  NCTC \nfrom other departments or agencies who work under NCTC management and \nsupervision  in  a  manner  substantially  the  same  as  individuals  directly \nemployed by NCTC, and (111) contractors working under NCTC  management \nand  supervision  who  are  authorized to perform  services  in  support of NCTC \non  FISA-related  matters. \n2019  NCTC  Minimization  Procedures  §  A.3.b. \nThe  proposed  new  definition  of “NCTC  personnel”  in  the  NCTC  procedures \nfaithfully tracks  the  prior  definition  of “NCTC  employees,”  with  the  exception  of \nsubstituting  the  word  “individuals”  for  “personnel”  in  part  (ii)  thereof,  presumably  to \navoid  circularity.  See  NCTC  Minimization  Procedures  §  A.3.b.  The  government \nexplains  that  this  change  in  terminology  “more  clearly reflect[s]  the  scope  of application, \nas  defined  therein  to  include  employees  as  well  as  certain  individuals  detailed  to  NCTC \nand  contractors  working  under NCTC  management  and  supervision.”  Oct.  19,  2020, \nMemorandum  at  7. \nThe  Court  views  this  as  a  change  of emphasis  rather  than  of substance.  The \neffective  scope  of the  operative  definition  remains  unchanged.  It  also  better  reflects  the \nnature  of NCTC’s  multifaceted  workforce.

The  former provision  allows  holders  of these  two  positions  to \nwaive  the  requirement  that  unreviewed  information  must  be  purged  from  NCTC  systems \nfive  years  after  the  expiration  date  of the  certification  authorizing  the  collection,  provided \ncertain  findings  are  made  by  one  of these  individuals.  The  latter provision  requires \napproval  from  a  holder  of one  of these  two  positions  to  access  data  that  has  been \nreviewed,  but  not  identified  as  meeting  the  standard  for  retention,  more  than  ten  years \nafter  the  expiration  of the  certification  authorizing  the  collection. \nFor  purposes  of these  provisions,  references  to  the  Deputy  Director  for \nIntelligence  are  replaced  with  the  Assistant  Director  for  Intelligence.  References  to  the \nDeputy  Director  of Terrorist  Identities  are  replaced  with  the  Assistant Director  for \nIdentity  Intelligence.  The  government  represents  that  the  proposed  substitutions  “reflect \ninternal  renaming  of the  positions  at  NCTC,”  and  that  the  “referenced  position[s]  and \nduties  of the  individuals  in  these  positions  remain  the  same.”  Oct.  19,  2020, \nMemorandum  at  8. \naah  tielh  hehehehehe aan  Page  19 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 19 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re: Section  702 2020 Certification  Authonzed for Public Release by ODNI \nFOR SE CRE  ORE  OE OH \nIn  contrast,  a  change  proposed  to  Section  D.3.b,  relating  to  disseminations, \nexpands  the  universe  of individuals  who  may,  in  coordination  with  the  office  of NCTC \nLegal  Counsel,  approve  disseminations  of Section  702-acquired  information  concerning \n     \n   \nUnited  States  persons  to \n      \nPreviously,  such  approval  had  to  come  from  the  NCTC \nDirector  “or  a  designee  who  shall  hold  a  position  no  lower  than  Group  Chief within  the \nNCTC  Directorate  of Intelligence.”  2019  NCTC  Minimization  Procedures  §  D.3.b.  The \nproposed  revised  procedures  would  extend  to  such  an  individual  within  the  separate \nDirectorate  of Identity  Intelligence.  See  NCTC  Minimization  Procedures  §  D.3.b. \nThe  government  represents  that  this  change  is  precipitated  by  an  “internal  NCTC \nrealignment  moving  an  analytic  group  responsible  for  identifying  and  locating  members \nof terrorist  networks  from  the  Directorate  of Intelligence  to  the  Directorate  of Identity \nIntelligence.

That  the  change  is  purportedly \nnecessitated  by  the  transfer  of one  analytic  group  to  another  directorate  does  not  mean \nthat  the  practical  effect  of the  proposed  change  would  be  limited  to  that  group. \nPresumably  there  are  other  groups  within  the  Directorate  of Identity Intelligence,  and,  on \nits  face,  this  change  would  allow  the  NCTC  Director  to  delegate  dissemination \nHO  He  Page  20 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 20 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \neraiedepceeepi eepdpnhom \ndeterminations  to  chiefs  of those  other  groups,  as  well  as  to  other,  more  senior  officials \nwithin  the  Directorate  of Identity  Intelligence,  none  of whom  currently  can  be  delegated \nsuch  authority. \nTo  be  sure,  the  Court  does  not  second-guess  internal  organizational  decisions \nmade  by  the  Executive.  The  Court,  moreover,  has  no  objection  in  principle  to  the \nmaintenance  of the  status  quo  vis-a-vis  the  group,  previously  within  the  Directorate  of \nIntelligence,  and  now  within  the  Directorate  of Identity  Intelligence,  that  is  “responsible \nfor  identifying  and  locating  members  of terrorist  networks.”  Id.  But  the  Court  has  not \nbeen  provided  enough  information  about  other  groups  within  the  Directorate  of Identity \nIntelligence  to  know  whether  extension  of delegated  authority  to  chiefs  of those  other \ngroups  to  i?  ican  is  equally  appropriate.  The  Court  will  approve \nthe  proposed  change,  but  require  the  government  to  report  in  the  future  on  the  exercise  of \nthe  delegation  authority  to  any  group  chief or  official  within  the  Directorate  of Identity \nIntelligence  other  than  the  one  specifically  discussed  in  the  government’s  submission. \nFinally,  another  change,  made  at  the  Court’s  suggestion,  is  now  reflected  in \nSection  B.3  of the  NCTC  Minimization  Procedures.  That  section  allows  essentially \nindefinite  retention  of information  concerning  a  U.S.  person  that  meets  specified \nstandards.  As  amended,  it  concludes  with  the  following  caveat:  “Information  that  is \nevidence  of a  crime.  .  .  but  is  not  foreign  intelligence  information,  may  only  be  retained \nand  disseminated  for  law  enforcement  purposes.””  NCTC  Minimization  Procedures  §  B.3 \n(emphasis  added).

The  revised  provision  makes  clear  that  NCTC,  which  has  no  law-enforcement \nmission  or  authority,  may  only  retain  “evidence-of-a-crime”  information  that  is  not \nforeign-intelligence  information  for  purposes  of disseminating  it  to  law-enforcement \nauthorities. \nThe  Court  has  examined  the  foregoing  provisions,  as  revised  in  the  NCTC \nMinimization  Procedures,  and  concludes  that  they  are  consistent  with  finding  that  the \nproposed  procedures  satisfy the  applicable  definition  of “minimization  procedures.” \nC.  NCTC  Querying  Procedures \nConsistent  with  its  revised  minimization  procedures,  and  for  the  same  reasons \ndiscussed  above,  NCTC  has  proposed  to  replace  references  to  “NCTC  employees”  in  its \nquerying  procedures  with  the  term  “NCTC  personnel.”  The  Court  concludes  that  the \nNCTC  querying  procedures,  with  this  change,  continue  to  comport with  the  statutory \nstandards  for  such  procedures. \nD.  NSA  Querying  Procedures \nA  single  change  is  proposed  to  NSA’s  querying procedures.  Those  procedures \nprovide  generally  that  queries  of unminimized  Section  702  information  contained  in  NSA \nsystems  must  be  reasonably  likely  to  return  foreign-intelligence  information  as  defined  by \nFISA,  unless  an  exception  specified  in  the  procedures  applies.  See NSA  Querying \nttre  Page  22 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 22 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re:  Section 702 2020 Certification  Authonzed for Public Release by ODNI \n—STOEPC RETSTTORCONNOFORN— \nProcedures  §  [V.A.  Among  the  exceptions  are  enumerated  circumstances  in  which  non- \nconforming  queries  may  be  necessary  to  perform  “lawful  oversight  functions  of NSA’s \npersonnel  or  systems.”  Id.§  IV.C.6.  Those  functions  include  remediating  compliance \nincidents,  remediating  spills  of classified  information,  identifying  data  subject  to  purge, \nand  performing  quality  control  and  auditing  functions.  Id.  NSA  is  also  permitted  to \ndeviate  from  the  procedures  to  perform  other  oversight  functions,  not  specifically \nenumerated  in  the  procedures,  provided  it  consults  with  NSD  and  ODNI  prior  to \nconducting  such  a  query.  NSD,  in  turn,  is  required  to  promptly  report  the  deviation  to  the \nCourt.  Id. \nIn  a  notice  filed  on  January  22,  2020,  the  government  informed  the  Court  that \nNSA  had  developed  a  method i  known  or  suspected \nchild-exploitation  material  (including  child  pornography),  to  identify  and  remove  such \nmaterial  from  NSA  systems.  To  test  this  methodology,  NSA  ran  ni \nPE. «0s:  a  sample  of FISA-acquired  information  in  NSA  systems.  The  government \nconcedes  that  queries  conducted  for  such  purposes  do  not  meet  the  generally  applicable \nguerying  standard;  nor  do  they  fall  within  one  of the  lawful  oversight  functions \nenumerated  in  the  existing  NSA  querying  procedures.  Nevertheless,  NSD/ODNI  opined \nthat  “the  identification  and  removal  of child  exploitation  material  .  .  .  from  NSA  systems \nis  a  lawful  oversight  function  under  section  IV.C.6,”  and  that  the  deviation  from  the \nquerying  procedures  was  “necessary  to  perform  this  lawful  oversight  function  of NSA \nett  Page  23 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 23 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nOEORRE  E H \nsystems.”  Notice  of Deviation  from  Querying  Procedures,  January  22,  2020,  at  3;  see \nOct.  19,  2020,  Memorandum  at  10. \nNSA  anticipates  using  such  queries  going  forward,  likely  on  a  recurring  basis,  to \nproactively  identify  and  remove  child-exploitation  material  from  its  systems.  The \ngovernment  submits  that  doing  so  is  necessary to  “prevent  [NSA]  personnel  from \nunneeded  exposure  to  highly  disturbing,  illegal  material.”  October  19,  2020, \nMemorandum  at  10.  The  Court  credits  this  suggestion  and  likewise  finds  that \nperformance  of these  queries  qualifies  as  a  lawful  oversight  function  for  NSA  systems. \nBut  the  Court  encouraged  the  government  to  memorialize  this  oversight  activity  in  § \nIV.C.6,  among  the  other  enumerated  lawful  oversight  functions  that  are  recognized \nexceptions  to  the  generally  applicable  querying  standards. \nThe  government  has  done  so.  Section  IV.C.6  now  includes  a  new  provision  for \n“identify[ing]  and  remov[ing]  child  exploitation  material,  including  child  pornography, \nfrom  NSA  systems.”  NSA  Querying  Procedures  §  IV.C.6.f.  The  Court  finds  that  the \naddition  of this  narrow  exception  has  no  material  impact  on  the  sufficiency  of the \nquerying  procedures  taken  as  a  whole. \nE.  Clarification  Regarding  Segregation  of Attorney-Client  Privileged \nCommunications  by  NSA,  CIA,  and NCTC \nNSA,  CIA,  and  NCTC’s  minimization  procedures  require  that  certain  attorney- \nclient  privileged  communications  acquired  pursuant  to  Section  702  be  “segregated”  by \nthe  respective  agency —  specifically,  those  pertaining  to  a  criminal  charge  in  the  United \nlen  hella  heshe nah lihe eee  Page  24 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 24 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re:  Section  702 2020 Certification  Authonzed for Public Release by ODNI \neae \n     \nSee  NSA  Minimization  Procedures  §  5(c) \nand  (e);  CIA  Minimization  Procedures  §  7.a.(3)  and  (5);  NCTC  Minimization  Procedures \n§  C.5.c.  and  e.  The  FBI,  as  a  law-enforcement  agency,  has  more  detailed  procedures  for \nhandling  attorney-client  privileged  communications,  including,  in  the  case  of an \nindividual  charged  with  a  crime  in  the  United  States,  a  requirement  that  the  FBI  sequester \nprivileged  communications  relating  to  the  charged  offense  with  the  Court.  See  FBI \nMinimization  Procedures  §  III.D.5.a  and  b. \nIn  response  to  questions  from  the  Court  about  the  manner  in  which  the  segregation \nrequirement  was  being  implemented  by  NSA,  CLA,  and  NCTC,  the  government  offered \nclarification  in  the  memorandum  accompanying  the  2019  Certifications.  It  reported  that \naccess  to  such  communications  at  CIA  is  limited  to  “personnel  who  require  access  in \norder  to  evaluate  and  process  the  communication  under the  attorney-client  provisions  of \nCIA’s  procedures.”  Sept.  17,  2019,  Memorandum  at  59.  The  government  later  clarified \nthat  the  same  was  true  with  respect  to  NCTC.  See  Government’s  Ex  Parte  Notice  of \nClarification  Regarding  NCTC’s  Minimization  Procedures,  Docket   —_— \n      \nAlthough  NCTC  analysts  would  be \nmade  aware  of the  existence  of  the  segregated  communication,  the  analysts  would  not  be \nable  to  view  the  contents  of the  communication.

In  connection  with  the  2019  Certifications,  the \ngovernment  represented  that \nwhen  communications  containing  information  protected  by  the  attorney- \nclient  privilege  are  segregated  at  NSA,  NSA  personnel  mark  the \ncommunications  for  quarantine  on  NSA’s  Master  Purge  List  (MPL). \nCommunications  that  are  marked  for  quarantine  on  the  MPL  remain \ndiscoverable  by  NSA  personnel  but  may  not  be  used  in  taskings  made \npursuant  to  section  702,  any  FISA  application  submitted  to  the  Court,  or \nany  reporting  product,  except  as  permitted  by  the  dissemination \nrestrictions  in  the  attorney-client  privilege  provisions  of the  procedures. \nSept.  17,  2019,  Memorandum  at  59. \nThe  Court  expressed  concern  that  this  construct,  in  which  the  attorney-client \nprivileged  communication  remained  accessible  to  all  NSA  analytic  personnel  who  were \notherwise  authorized  to  access  Section  702-acquired  information,  did  not  constitute \n“segregation”  as  that  term  was  used  in  the  procedures  and  was  insufficiently  protective  of \nthe  privilege  inherent  in  those  communications. \nIn  response  to  the  Court’s  concerns,  the  government  now  reports  that \nNSA  is  implementing  a  process,  which  will  be  in  place  no  later  than \nOctober  30,  2020,  adjusting  the  attorney-client  communication  segregation \nprocess  previously  described  to  the  Court,  which  restricted  authorized  use \nof attorney-client  privileged  communications.  This  new  process  will  limit \naccess  to  each  segregated  communication.

But  the  Court  also  notes  that  NSA  continues  to \ninterpret  the  segregation  requirement  differently  from  the  CIA  and  NCTC,  both  of  which \nforgo  analytic  use  of these  sensitive  categories  of communications  and  limit  access  to \ntechnical  and  compliance  personnel  charged  with  implementing  the  attorney-client \nprivilege  requirements  of their  respective  procedures. \nThe  government  does  little  by  way  of justifying  the  differing  treatment  of \nprivileged  communications  by  NSA.  The  Act  makes  clear  that  “‘no  otherwise  privileged \ncommunication  obtained  in  accordance  with”  its  provisions  “shall  lose  its  privileged \ncharacter.”  §1806(a).  Protections  for  attorney-client  privileged  communications  have \nlong  featured  prominently  in  FISA  minimization  procedures,  and  the  Court  relies  on  them \nin  assessing  the  overall  reasonableness  of those  procedures. \nOn  the  other  hand,  the  Court  has  previously  approved  the  dissemination \nprovisions  in  the  NSA  procedures  highlighted  above,  which  unambiguously  contemplate \nthe  dissemination  of attorney-client  privileged  communications  of the  types  being \n  \n——  FOP SECREPSHOREONNOFORN  Page  28 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 28 of 67  FISC Opinion,  Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authonzed for Public Release by ODNI \n“FOR SECRE TST ORCO  NOT Ontey \ndiscussed  «2:  to  certain  limitations \nand  requirements.  Implicit  in  those  dissemination  provisions  is  the  premise  that  NSA  can \nuse  privileged  communications  in  its  possession  for  analytic  purposes,  with  appropriate \nhandling  restrictions.  The  only  question  of moment  is  what  it  means  for  these \ncommunications  to  be  “segregated”  within  NSA  pursuant  to  its  procedures. \nFocusing  on  that  narrower  issue,  the  first  question  asks  what  the  law  requires. \nThere  is  no  statutory  bar  to  analytic  use  of attorney-client  privileged  communications  for \nvalid  foreign-intelligence  purposes.  Section  1806(a),  discussed  above,  was  included  in \nthe  statute  to  make  clear  that  a  privileged  communication  did  not  lose  its  character  as \nsuch  by  virtue  of having  been  overheard  by a  third  party  (in  this  case,  by  the  government, \nsurreptitiously).  See  H.R.  Rep.  No.  95-1283  part  I,  at  87  (1978)  (noting  that  this \nprovision  was  designed  “to  change  existing  law  as  to  the  scope  and  existence  of \nprivileged  communications  only  to  the  extent  that  it  provides  that  otherwise  privileged \ncommunications  do  not  lose  their  privileged  character  because  they  are  intercepted  by  a \nperson  not  a  party  to  the  conversation”).  The  government  does  not  challenge  the \nprivileged  character  of these  communications  by  virtue  of its  having  intercepted  them. \nMinimization  procedures,  in  turn,  need  only be  “reasonably  designed  in  light  of \nthe  purpose  and  technique  of the  particular  surveillance,  to  minimize  the  acquisition  and \nretention,  and  prohibit  the  dissemination,  of nonpublicly  available  information \nconcerning  unconsenting  United  States  persons  consistent with  the  need  of the  United \nStates  to  obtain,  produce,  and  disseminate  foreign  intelligence  information.”  §1801(h)(1) \nOne  eTor  Page  29 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 29 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nrR \n(emphasis  added).  As  noted  above,  there  are  meaningful  limitations  in  NSA’s  procedures \non  the  retention,  handling,  and  dissemination  of privileged  communications.  Those \nprocedures  have  been  found  to  be  constitutionally  and  statutorily  sufficient  on  numerous \nprior occasions. \nThe  further  restriction  of privileged  communications tof  enhances  the  privacy \nprotection  afforded  those  communications  under  NSA’s  procedures.  The  Court  again \nconcludes  that  NSA’s  procedures,  as  a  whole  and  as  applied  to  it,  an  agency  with  no  law- \nenforcement  mission  or  authority,  are  reasonably  designed  to  protect  the  substantial \nprivacy  interests  in  attorney-client  communications,  consistent  with  the  need  to  exploit \nthose  communications  for  legitimate  foreign-intelligence  purposes. \nThat  being  said,  the  government  is  admonished  to  guard  against  the  possibility \nthat  NSA,  in  compliance  with  its  procedures,  might  disseminate  to  FBI  a  report  based  on \na  privileged  communication  described  in  Section  5(c)  of the  NSA  procedures  (pertaining \nto  a  criminal  charge  in  the  United  States)  that,  had  the  FBI  obtained  it  through  its  own \ncollection  efforts,  the  FBI  would  be  required  to  sequester  with  the  Court  under  FBI \nMinimization  Procedures  §  IJI.D.5.a  and  b.  As  noted  above,  such  a  dissemination  could \nonly  be  made  by  NSA  with  the  approval  of the  AAG/NS. \nF.  Conclusion \nFor  the  reasons  stated  above  and  in  the  Court’s  opinions  in  the  Prior  702  Dockets, \nthe  Court  concludes  that,  as  written,  the  proposed  minimization  procedures  for  the  FBL \nNSA,  CIA,  and  NCTC,  in  conjunction  with  the  querying  procedures  for  those  agencies, \neal  ahhh  heshe bn  ahiha  te bem  Page  30 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 30 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nee \nsatisfy  the  definition  of minimization  procedures  at  50  U.S.C.  §  1801(h);  and  that  those \nquerying  procedures  satisfy  the  requirements  of Section  702(f)(1). \nV.  FOURTH  AMENDMENT  REQUIREMENTS \nThe  Court  must  also  assess  whether  the  proposed  targeting,  minimization,  and \nquerying  procedures  are  consistent  with  the  requirements  of the  Fourth  Amendment.  See \n§  702())(3)(A).  That  Amendment  states: \nThe  right  of  the  people  to  be  secure  in  their  persons,  houses,  papers,  and \neffects,  against unreasonable searches  and seizures, shall  not be violated,  and \nno  Warrants  shall  issue,  but  upon  probable  cause,  supported  by  Oath  or \naffirmation,  and  particularly  describing  the  place  to  be  searched,  and  the \npersons  or things  to  be  seized. \n“The  touchstone  of the  Fourth  Amendment  is  reasonableness.”  In  re  Certified \nQuestion  of  Law,  858  F.3d  591,  604  (FISA  Ct.  Rev.  2016)  (per  curiam)  (“In  re  Certified \nQuestion”).  Although  “[t]he  warrant  requirement  is  generally  a  tolerable  proxy  for \n‘reasonableness’  when  the  government  is  seeking  to  unearth  evidence  of criminal \nwrongdoing,  .  .  .  it  fails  properly  to  balance  the  interests  at  stake  when  the  government  is \ninstead  seeking  to  preserve  and  protect  the  nation’s  security  from  foreign  threat.”  Id.  at \n593.  A  warrant  is  not  required  therefore  to  conduct  surveillance  “to  obtain  foreign \nintelligence  for  national  security  purposes  .  .  .  directed  against  foreign  powers  or  agents  of \nforeign  powers  reasonably  believed  to  be  located  outside  the  United  States.” Irn e \nDirectives  Pursuant  to  Section  105B  of  FISA,  551  F.3d  1004,  1012  (FISA  Ct.

See, e.g.,  Nov.  6,  2015, \nOpinion  at  39  (assessing  “the  combined  effect”  of the  targeting  and  minimization \nprocedures  );  Oct.  18,  2018,  Opinion  at  85-88  (declining  invitation  of amici  curiae  to \nconduct  Fourth  Amendment  evaluation  of querying practices  in  isolation  ).  Restrictions \non  how  the  government  targets  acquisitions  under  Section  702  and  how  it  handles \ninformation  post-acquisition  limit  the  degree  of intrusion  on  individual  privacy  interests \nprotected  by  the  Fourth  Amendment.  For reasons  explained  above,  the  Court  has  found \nthat  the  proposed  targeting  procedures,  as  written,  are  reasonably  designed  to  limit \nacquisitions  to  those  targets  reasonably  believed  to  be  non-United  States  persons  located \noutside  the  United  States.  The  Fourth  Amendment  does  not  protect  the  privacy  interests \nof such  individuals. See, ¢.g.,  Nov.  6,  2015,  Opinion  at  38;  Sept.  4,  2008,  Opinion  at  37 \n(citing  United  States  v.  Verdugo-Urquidez,  494  U.S.  259,  274-75  (1990)). \nTo  the  extent  U.S.-person  information  is  acquired  under  Section  702  — e.g.,  when \na  communication  between  a  U.S.  person  and  a  Section  702  target  is  intercepted  —  the \ngovernment  can  reduce  the  intrusiveness  of the  acquisition  for  Fourth  Amendment \npurposes  by  restricting  use  or disclosure  of such  information.  See  In  re  Certified \nQuestion  at  609.  The  FISC  has  previously  found  that  “earlier  versions  of the  various \nagencies’  targeting  and  minimization  procedures  adequately  protected  the  substantial \nTee  Page  32 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 32 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re:  Section  702 2020 Certification  Authonzed for Public Release by ODNI \n—FOP-SEECREFSHORCONAOEGRA— \nFourth  Amendment  interests  that  are  implicated  by  the  acquisition  of communications  of \nsuch  United  States  persons.”  Nov.  6,  2015,  Opinion  at  38-39  (citing  Docket Nos \nem.

Specifically,  “‘the  combined \neffect  of these  procedures’”  was  “‘to  substantially  reduce  the  risk  that  non-target \ninformation  concerning  United  States  persons  or  persons  inside  the  United  States  will  be \nused  or  disseminated’  and  to  ensure  that  ‘non-target  information  that  is  subject  to \nprotection  under  FISA  or  the  Fourth  Amendment  is  not  retained  any  longer  than  is \nreasonably  necessary.’”  Nov.  6,  2015,  Opinion  at  39  (citing  Aug.  26,  2014,  Opinion  at \n40). \nThe  Court  takes  all  of these  factors  into  account  in  assessing  the  reasonableness  of \nthe  procedures  under  the  Fourth  Amendment.  Under  the  applicable  totality-of- \ncircumstances  approach,  it  must  balance  “‘the  degree  to  which  [governmental  action] \nintrudes  upon  an  individual’s  privacy’”  against  “‘the  degree  to  which  it  is  needed  for  the \npromotion  of legitimate  governmental  interests.’”  In  re  Certified  Question  at  604-05 \n(quoting  Wyoming  v.

Although  not  separately  quantified,  there  is  thus  presumably  a  substantial \namount  of information  of or  concerning  United  States  persons  acquired  under  Section \n702. \nOn  the  other  side  of the  constitutional  balance,  acquiring  “foreign  intelligence \nwith  an  eye  toward  safeguarding  the  nation’s  security  serves  .  .  .  a  particularly  intense \ninterest.” In re Certified Question  at  606  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  For  that \nreason,  the  FISCR  has  observed  that  “the  government’s  investigative  interest  in  cases \narising  under  FISA  is  at  the  highest  level  and  weighs  heavily  in  the  constitutional \nbalancing  process.”  Id.  at  608. \nMeasures  to  protect  individual  privacy  can  be  decisive  in  the  proper  balancing  of \nthese  interests: \nIf  the  protections  that  are  in  place  for  individual  privacy  interests  are \nsufficient  in  light  of  the  governmental  interest  at  stake,  the  constitutional \nscales  will  tilt  in  favor of upholding  the  government’s  actions.  If,  however, \nthose  protections  are  insufficient  to  alleviate  the  risks  of government  error \nand  abuse,  the  scales  will  tip  toward  a  finding  of unconstitutionality. \nIn  re  Directives  at  1012. \nIn  this  case,  the  Court  has  carefully  considered  how  the  proposed  procedures  seek \nto  protect  private  U.S.-person  information  from  misuse.

FBI  Querying  Issues \nIn  conjunction  with  the  2019  Certifications,  this  Court  approved  amended  FBI     \n   \nuerying  procedures  on  September  4,  2019.  See  Docket  Nos.  ee \nMem.  Op.  and  Order,  Sept.  4,  2019,  at  16-17  (\"September  4,  2019, \nOpinion\").  Those  procedures  require  the  FBI: \n(1)  to  keep  records  that  identify  which  terms  used  to  query  unminimized  Section \n702  information  are  U.S.-person  query  terms,  id.  at  7-8,  and \n(2)  to  document  in  writing  why  a  query  involving  a  U.S.-person  query  term \nsatisfies  the  querying  standard  before  accessing  the  contents  of communications \nretrieved  by the  query  (except  for  queries  that  are  subject  to  Section  702(f)(2)). \nId.  at  8-9.  (This  documentation  requirement  adopts  a  recommendation  made  by \namici  curiae.  See  Oct.  18,  2018,  Opinion  at  92-93,  96-97.) \nSee  Dec.  6,  2019,  Opinion  at  62;  FBI  Querying  Procedures  §  [V.B.  In  addition,  the \nCourt  modified  a  previously  imposed  reporting  requirement  to  require  the  government  to \nreport  to  the  Court  whenever the  FBI  conducted  a  query  that  did  not  relate  to  national \nsecurity  and  was  not  covered  by  Section  702(f)(2).  Id.  at  71-73. \nBecause  the  FBI  needed  time  to  make  necessary  changes  in  its  systems  to  comply \nwith  the  new  recordkeeping  and  documentation  requirements,  the  Court  ordered  periodic \nreporting  on  their  implementation.  See  Sept.  4,  2019,  Opinion  at  14-15,  17.  At  the  time \nthe  Court  approved  the  2019  Certifications,  the  government  had  filed  two  such  reports. \nFORRES HOR ERO  Page  38 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 38 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re:  Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \neterna \nSee  Dec.  6,  2019,  Opinion  at  64.  On  March  5,  2020,  it  informed  the  Court  that  the  FBI \nhad  concluded  implementation of its  amended  Section  702  Querying  Procedures, \nincluding  deploying  mandatory  training,  via  its  Virtual  Academy  platform,  for  all  FBI \npersonnel  with  access  to  unminimized  Section  702-acquired  information.  See  Report \nRegarding  the  FBI's  Implementation  of the  FBI's  Section  702  Querying  Procedures, \nDocket  Nos.  ar.  5,  2020,  (\"Query \nImplementation  Report,  March  5,  2020\").  For  the  reasons  discussed  below,  the  Court \ncontinues  to  be  concerned  about  FBI  querying  practices  involving  U.S.-person  query \nterms,  including  (1)  application  of the  substantive  standard  for  conducting  queries;  (2) \nqueries  that  are  designed  to  retrieve  evidence  of crime  that  is  not  foreign-intelligence \ninformation;  and  (3)  recordkeeping  and  documentation  requirements. \nl.  Violations  of the  Querying  Standard \nNSD  has  reported  a  number  of compliance  incidents  that  were  discovered  during \noversight  reviews  at  FBI  field  offices,  which  suggest  that  the  FBI’s  failure  to  properly \napply  its  querying  standard  when  searching  Section  702-acquired  information  was  more \npervasive  than  was  previously  believed.  For  example,  between  April  11,  2019,  and  July \n     \n8,  2019,  a  technical  information  specialist  in  th  ho  was  conducting \n“limited  background  investigations”  conducted  approximately  124  queries  of Section \n702-acquired  information  using  the  names  and  other  identifiers  of:  1)  individuals  who  had \nrequested  to  participate  in  FBI’s  “Citizens  Academy”  —  a  program  for  business,  religious, \ncivic,  and  community  leaders  designed  to  foster greater  understanding  of the  role  of \neae  eam  Page  39 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 39 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\n      \nDocument re:  Section  702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nfederal  law  enforcement  in  the  community;  2)  individuals  who  needed  to  enter  the  field \noffice  in  order  to  perform  a  particular  service,  such  as  a  repair;  and  3)  individuals  who \nentered  the  field  office  seeking  to  provide  a tip  or  to  report  that  they  were  victims  of a \ncrime.  See  Notice  of compliance  incidents  regarding  the  FBI’s  querying  of raw  FISA- \nacquired  information  Feb.  5,  2020,  at  2. \n   \nSimilarly,  between  August  1,  2019,  and  October  18,  2019,  a  task-force  officer  in \n     \nthe  FBI’s  onducted  approximately  69  queries  using  the  names  and \nidentifiers  of individuals \nthe  officer  conducted  queries  to  determine  whether  the  FBI  could  provide  additional \ninformation  on  those  persons.  Id. \nOther  reported  violations  apparently  resulted  from  the  failure  of FBI  personnel  to \nopt  out  of querying  raw  FISA-acquired  information.  See,  e.g.,  Quarterly  Report \nConcerning  Compliance  Matters  Under  Section  702,  Mar.  2020,  at  85-86  (Intelligence \n     \n        \nAnalyst  in  onducted  110  queries  for  analytic  paper  usin \nbut  did  not  intend  for \nqueries  to  run  against  all  raw  FISA-acquired  information);  see  also  Notice  of compliance \nincidents  regarding  the  i  _   0lU  of raw  FISA-acquired \ninformation,  June  1,  2020  (analyst  conducted  queries  for  purpose  of  ongoing  vetting  of \ngfe  tpn  ates  Page  40 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 40 of 67  FISC Opinion,  Nov.  18, 2020\n  \n     \n  \nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nmle eet \nconfidential  human  sources,  as  well  as  conducting  overly  broad  queries  (e.  _  and \nmistakenly  failed  to  opt  out  of querying  against  raw  FISA-acquired  information). \nThe  Court  acknowledges,  however,  that  the  majority  of these  queries  occurred \nprior to  the  implementation  of the  FBI's  system  changes  and  training  regarding  the \nrequirement  to  document  in  writing  why  a  query  involving  a  U.S.-person  query  term  is \nreasonably  likely  to  return  foreign-intelligence  information  or  evidence  of crime.  In \naddition,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  severely  limited  the  government’s  ability to  monitor \nthe  FBI’s  compliance  once  the  system  changes  were  implemented  and  users  received \ntraining  on  those  changes.  See  Quarterly  Report  concerning  compliance  matters  under \nSection  702,  June  2020,  at  2  n.  2  (“June  2020  Quarterly  Report”)  (NSD  and  ODNI \ntemporarily  suspended  all  onsite  reviews  at  NSA,  CLA,  NCTC,  and  FBI). \nThe  Court  has  previously  assessed  that  the  additional  documentation  requirements \nshould  “help  ensure  that  FBI  personnel  .  .  .  have  thought  about  the  querying  standard  and \narticulated  why  they  believe  it  has  been  met”  and  prompt  them  “to  recall  and  apply the \nguidance  and  training  they  have  received  on  the  querying  standard.”  Dec.  6,  2019, \nOpinion  at  68.  In  the  absence  of evidence  to  the  contrary,  and  under  these  unique \ncircumstances,  the  Court  is  willing  to  again  conclude  that  the  improper  queries  described \nabove  do  not  undermine  it's  prior  determination  that,  with  implementation  of the \ndocumentation  requirement,  the  FBI's  querying  and  minimization  procedures  meet \nstatutory  and  Fourth  Amendment  requirements. \n—FOPSECREFASHOREONNOFORN  Page  41 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 41  of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re:  Section  702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nne  os Oe 8 noe 0S  8s ene ener  eee \n2.  Failure  to  Get  FISC  Order  Before  Reviewing  Results  of Evidence-of- \nCrime  Queries \nOver  the  past  year,  the  government  has  reported  numerous  incidents  involving \nU.S.-person  queries  that  were  designed  to  return  evidence  of a  crime  unrelated  to  foreign- \nintelligence,  as  permitted  by  Section  IV.A.1  of the  FBI's  Query  Procedures.  The \ngovernment  has  never  applied  to  the  FISC  for  an  order  under  Section  702(f)(2).  But  the \nmanner  in  which  the  FBI's  systems  displayed  Section  702-acquired  information  returned \nin  response  to  such  queries  permitted  users  to  view  Section  702  contents  under \ncircumstances  in  which  they  were  required  to  first  obtain  an  order  in  accordance  with \nSection  702(f)(2),  or  to  report  to  the  Court  pursuant  to  the  modified  reporting \nrequirement.  See  Dec.  6,  2019,  Opinion  at  70,  81. \nFor  example,  during  an  oversight  review of the  oe the \ngovernment  discovered  40  queries  that  had  been  conducted  in  support  of predicated \ncriminal  investigations  relating  to  health-care  fraud,  transnational  organized  crime, \nviolent  gangs,  domestic  terrorism  involving  racially  motivated  violent  extremists,  as  well \nas  investigations  relating  to  public  corruption  and  bribery  pe \npe  None  of these  queries  was  related  to  national \nsecurity,  and  they  returned  numerous  Section  702-acquired  products  in  response.

Of the  reported  instances  in  each  field \noffice,  the  FBI  advised  that  none  of the  Section  702-acquired  information  returned  was \nused  in  a  criminal  or  civil  proceeding  or  otherwise  used  for  any  investigative  or \nevidentiary  purpose,  even  when  the  Section  702  product  displayed  had  been  opened  and \nreviewed.

But these  query  violations \nwere  discovered  during  a  limited  number  of oversight  reviews  that  occurred  before  NSD \nand  ODNI  suspended  on-site  reviews  at  FBI  field  offices  because  of the  COVID-19 \npandemic.  Therefore,  the  reported  violations  involved  queries  that  were  conducted  prior \nto  the  FBI's  implementation  of the  systems  changes  in  late  November  2019,  and  prior  to \ncompletion  of the  mandatory  training  on  these  new  features  or  the  Querying  Procedures \nas  amended. \n“TOP SECRET ISTVORCONMNOTOnRN  Page  43 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 43 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \npeter tment \nWhile  the  Court  is  concerned  about  the  apparent  widespread  violations  of the \nquerying  standard  ——  including  violations  of Section  702(f)(2)  —  it  lacks  sufficient \ninformation  at  this  time  to  assess  the  adequacy  of the  FB]  system  changes  and  training, \npost-implementation.  Under  these  unique  circumstances,  and  in  the  absence  of evidence \nto  the  contrary,  the  Court  is  willing  to  again  conclude  that  the  improper  queries  described \nabove  do  not  undermine  it's  prior  determination  that,  with  implementation  of the \ndocumentation  requirement,  the  FBI's  querying  and  minimization  procedures  meet \nstatutory  and  Fourth  Amendment  requirements.  The  number  and  nature  of the  reported \nquerying  violations  nonetheless  suggest  that  ongoing  monitoring  and  auditing  will  be \ncritical  to  evaluationg  whether  the  current  measures  are  adequate. \n3.  Recordkeeping  and  Documentation  Requirements  for  U.S.-Person \nQuery  Terms \nAs  noted  above,  on  March  5,  2020,  the  government  informed  the  Court  that  the \nFBI  had  concluded  implementation  of its  Section  702  Querying  Procedures,  including \ndeploying  training  to  FBI  personnel  with  access  to  unminimized  Section  702-acquired \ninformation.  See  Query  Implementation  Report,  Mar.  5,  2020.  The  report  explained  that \nwhen  a  user  is  prompted  to  indicate  whether  a  U.S.-person  query  is  conducted  to  find \nonly  evidence  of a  crime,  the  system’s  default  answer  is  \"No.\"  Unless  the  user  changes \nthe  answer  to  “Yes,”  the  system  will  permit  a  user  to  access  the  Section  702-acquired \ncontents  —  even  if a  non-foreign-intelligence  evidence-of-crime justification  is  entered. \nThis  sequencing  mechanism  differs  from  what  the  Court  understood  based  on  the \nORR EEO RCO  OER  Page  44 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 44 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re: Section  702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nReam \ngovernment's  earlier  representation  that  \"a  user  must  provide  both  a justification  for  the \nquery,  and  an  affirmative  indication  as  to  whether  the  query  is  an  evidence-of-a-crime \n  \nquery.\"  Query  Implementation  Report,  Mar.  5,  2020,  at  5-6  (emphasis  in  original). \nIn  response  to  questions  raised  at  a  hearing  conducted  by  secure  teleconference \non  October 28,  2020,  with  representatives  of the  NSD,  the  FBI,  and  the  ODNI,  the  FBI \n   \nprovided  the  Court  with  screenshots  taken  from  the  FBI’s \nsequence  involved  when  conductin \nov.  3,  2020  (“Nov.  3,  2020, \nletter”).

A  radio  button  is  displayed  for  each  option,  but  the \nsystem  defaults  to  include  Section  702  information.  If the  user  affirmatively  selects  to \nnot  include  Section  702  information,  the  system  will  exclude  such  information  from \nsubsequent  searches  for  30  minutes,  after  which  the  system  notifies  the  user  that  the \n“session”  has  expired,  and  it  reverts  to  the  default  that  includes  Section  702  information. \nId. \nWhen  Section  702  information  is  included,  a  pop-up  box  appears,  labeled  “702 \nQuery  Term,”  and  presents  a  drop-down  menu  requiring  a  user  to  select  whether  her \nquery  term  is  a  “USPER,  Presumed  USPER,  or  Other  (non-USPER  or  query  term  does \nnot  relate  to  a  person).”  Id.

An  information  icon  available  here  states:  “[I]f your \nquery  is  being  conducted  solely  to  identify  Evidence  of a  Crime  (not  Foreign  Intelligence \nInformation)  and  is  in  connection  with  a  predicated  criminal  investigation  that  does  not \nrelate  to  the  national  security  of the  United  States,  then  you  must  obtain  a  FISA  court \norder  or  have  exigent  circumstances  prior  to  viewing  the  content  of any  702  results.”  Id. \nIf a  user  accepts  the  default  “No,”  the  system  requires  her  to  provide  a \njustification  indicating  that  the  query was  reasonably  likely  to  retrieve  foreign-intelligence \ninformation  or  evidence  of a  crime.  This  is  done  by  selecting  from  a  pre-populated  list  of \noptions,  or by  selecting  \"other\"  and  typing  a justification  in  a  free-text  box.  Once a \njustification  is  provided,  the  system  will  give  the  user  access  to  the  Section  702-acquired \ninformation  even  if she  enters  a  non-foreign-intelligence  evidence-of-crime justification \nin  the  text  box.

At  the  hearing,  the  FBI  reported  that  this  alert  feature  was  put  into \neffect  in  late  July  2020;  since  then,  there  have  been  12  instances  in  which  users  had \ntoggled  to  \"Yes,\"  indicating  that  they  were  conducting  a  U.S.  person,  evidence-of-crime- \nonly  query,  and  were  nonetheless  permitted  access  to  view  Section  702-contents.  Based \non  its  subsequent  review,  however,  the  FBI  determined  that  none  of the  12  queries  was \n\"exclusively\"  conducted  to  find  evidence  of crime,  and  the  user  had  therefore  incorrectly \ntoggled  to  “yes.”’  So  far  no  one  has  selected  the  box  indicating  that  she  has  obtained  a \ncourt  order  to  review  the  information. \nIf \"Neither\"  is  selected,  the  system  blocks  access  to  any  responsive  Section \n702-acquired  content,  and  an  “Alert”  message  appears  on  the  screen  reminding  the  user \nthat  if “conducting  an  Evidence  of Crime  ONLY  query  against  Section  702  FISA- \nacquired  information  using  a  USPER  query  term  [she]  must  either  obtain  FISA  Court \nAuthorization  or have  exigent  circumstances  prior  to  reviewing  content.”  Nov.  3,  2020 \nletter. \nThe  government  assesses  that  this  system  design  will  prevent  a user  from \naccessing  the  contents  of Section  702-acquired  information  under  circumstances  that \nwould  require  a  report  to  the  Court  pursuant to  the  modified  reporting  requirement \nmaintained  in  the  December  6,  2019,  Opinion.

See supra  at  40-41.  In  particular, \nit  is  concerned  that  FBI  personnel,  when  conducting  queries  not  designed  to  find  and \nextract  foreign-intelligence  information,  may:  1)  mistakenly  accept  the  default  “No”;  2) \nenter  a justification  from  the  drop-down  menu,  or  select  “other”  as  the justification  and \nindicate  in  the  text  box  that  the  query  was  for  a  non-national-security-related  criminal \ninvestigation;  and  3)  proceed  to  review  the  results  returned  in  response.  This  would \nviolate  the  statute  in  cases  where  the  query was  conducted  in  connection  with  a  predicated \ncriminal  investigation,  and  it  could  hamper  the  government’s  ability to  gather  the \ninformation  needed  to  comply  with  the  modified  reporting  requirement  regarding  other \nevidence-of-crime-only  queries. \nThe  government  asserts  that  the  mandatory  FISA  training  provides  adequate \nassurance  that personnel  \"should  be  aware\"  of the  requirement  to  obtain  an  order  from  the \nCourt  for  queries  subject  to  Section  1881a(f)(2),  as  well  as  the  \"need  to  answer  the \n[ONLY  evidence  of a  crime]  question  correctly.\"  See  Query  Implementation  Report, \nMar.  5,  2020,  at  5  n.4.

See  Update  Regarding  the  FBI’s  Implementationn  of Section  702  Querying \nProcdures  for  i  Nov.  13,  2020,  at  4.  The  querying  process  described  for \n    \n=  to  be  similar  to  the  one  described  —  one  critical \ndifference.  When  the  user  is  asked  whether  the  query  was  conducted  to  find  only \nevidence  of a  crime,  she  must  select  either  “Yes”  or  “No”  because,  onic ll \nsystem  will  not  default  to  “No.”  Id.  This  should  provide  useful  data  and  may  enable  the \ngovernment  to  assess  whether  the  default  rule Pin F  3  in  a  different  error  rate \nAs  noted  above,  the  Court  lacks  sufficient  information  at  this  time  to  assess \nwhether  the  government’s  training  efforts  and  changes  to  its  system  are  having  the  desired \neffect.  It  is  also  not  this  Court’s  place  to  tell  the  government  how  to  design  its  computer \nsystems.  For  these  reasons,  the  Court  is  prepared  to  again  approve  the  FBI’s  Querying \nProcedures,  but  will  add  to  the  existing  reporting  obligations  regarding  evidence-of-a- \ncrime  (only)  queries.  The  Court  has  previously  found  that  querying,  when  conducted  to \nfind  evidence  of crime  at  earlier  stages  of a  criminal  investigation  that  is  unrelated  to \nnational  security,  likely  implicates  Fourth  Amendment  concerns.

See  §§  1881la(j),  (H(1). \nB.  Bulk  Queries  Revisited \nThe  government  has  reported  another  recordkeeping  issue  regarding  the  “bulk \nsearch”  feature  of  i  permits  users  to  conduct  \"batch\"  queries  using  multiple \nquery  terms.  See  Notice  of compliance  incident  involving  the  a \nae: 9,  20  to  record  whether  the  query  terms  were  U.S.-person \nquery  terms  and  allowed  users  to  view  the  content  of Section  702-acquired  information \nwithout  entering  a justification  in  the  system.  Id.  Apparently,  the  bulk-search  feature \noperated  in  this  manner  since  changes  a:  deployed  in  late  November  2019.  Id. \nThe  FBI  made  eof  to  correct  this  issue  on  October  7,  2020,  and  determined \nthat  approximately  92  users  had  conducted  approximately  353  bulk  queries  using  310 \nunique  query  terms.  Id.;  Nov.  3,  2020,  letter  at  3. \nThe  failure  to  require  a  written justification  for  a  bulk  query  involving  a  U.S.- \nperson  query  term  is  particularly  concerning  given  the  indiscriminate  nature  of such \nqueries.  Indeed,  the  Court  emphasized  the  importance  of this  documentation  requirement \nin  approving  the  FBI's  querying  procedures.  See  Dec.  6,  2019,  Opinion  at  68.  For \nexample,  in  considering  other  bulk  queries  that  the  FBI  had  previously  conducted  for \nrerson ii  Court  assessed  that  the  requirement  to  provide  a \nwritten justification  before  examining  the  contents  returned  by  a  U.S.-person  query \nshould  “help  ensure  that  FBI  personnel  .  .  .  have  thought  about  the  querying  standard  and \nFOP SECRET ST ORCO  eT  Oro.

(quoting  Oct.  18, \n2018,  Opinion  at  93). \nThe  fact  that  this  system  failure  went  undetected  or  unreported  for  nearly  a  year \nhighlights  the  ramifications  of technical  shortcomings  in  implementation  of the \nprocedures  — e.g.,  failing  to  detect  improper  queries  before  they  occur,  and  logging \nrequired  information  to  enable  proper  oversight.  The  automated  safeguards  built  into  a \nsystem  are  helpful,  but  not  foolproof,  and  training  alone  has  proven  to  be  an  insufficient \nbackstop.  For  these  reasons  and  given  the  broad,  suspicionless  nature  of past  bulk \nqueries,  the  Court  is  requiring  the  government  to  report  on  a  quarterly  basis  the  number  of \nbulk  queries  run  against  Section  702-acquired  information  using  U.S.-person  query  terms, \nthe  number  of written justifications  provided  for  such  queries  that  were  reviewed  by  OI, \nand  the  number  NSD  assessed  did  not  have  a  reasonable  basis  to  believe  that  queries  of \neach  individual  identifier  would  be  likely to  retrieve  foreign-intelligence  information  or \nre \nevidence  of a  crime  at  the  time  the  queries  were  conducted. \nThe  government  previously  advised  that,  in  order to  comply  with  the \nrecordkeeping  and  documentation  requirements  for  U.S.-person  queries  conducted  in  a \nsystem calcd  FBI  implemented  a  process  that  required  users  to  document  in \na  SharePoint  site  whether  the  query  satisfies  the  querying  standard  before  viewing  any \ncontents  returned  by  the  query.

The  FBI \ndisabled  this  feature  on  August  3,  2020.  ill  now  only  present  query  results  to \n     \nusers  once  the  full  query term(s)  has  been  entered  and  will  log  every  query.  This  should \n    \nprovide  a  better  means  for  comparin  tgainst  the  records  in  Sharepoint \nto  assist  in  evaluating  compliance  with  query-documentation  requirements  through  the \nuse  of the  FBI  Sharepoint  site.  This  change  in  implementation  provides  reason  to  expect \nimprovement  in  the  government’s  compliance  with  the  querying  procedures. \nC.

See  2019  FBI  Minimization  Procedures  §§  UI.F.5,  UI.F.6.  No  changes \nto  these  provisions  are  proposed  in  the  2020  certifications. \nThe  Court  approved  this  reporting  requirement  on  a  prospective  basis,  in  view  of \nthe  prohibition  against  putting  unminimized  Section  702  collection  in  classified  email  or \nIM  systems  as  approved  in  the  October  18,  2018,  Opinion,  but  did  not  excuse  the \ngovernment  from  its  obligation  to  report  instances  of retention  required  by  that  Opinion. \nIt  did  so  noting  that  the  government  had  “unjustifiably disregarded”  the  October  2018 \nreporting  requirement,  in  part,  by  taking  so  long  to  issue  guidance  to  its  personnel  on  the \nrequirement.  See  Dec.  6,  2019,  Opinion  at  44.  When  the  FBI  policy  was  issued  on \nDecember  14,  2019,  to  instruct  personnel  with  access  to  the  archival  systems  on  the \nrequirements  of section  IIJ.F.5,  Il.

Id. \nat  7. \n    \nAs  described,  the  FBI’s  ystem  appears  to  adhere  to  the  current \nsafeguards  for  archival  systems  required  by  Section  III.F.5  and  III.F.6  (including  the \nPage  55 \n  \nAuthorized for Public Release on A  pril 26, 2021  Page 55 of 67  FISC Opinion,  Nov.  18, 2020\n         \n  \nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authonized for Public Release by ODNI \nSaonRe  oO  eno r ore \nprohibition  on  placing  raw  FISA  in  these  systems,  access  restrictions,  limited  number  of \nauthorized  users,  and  purge  processes).  Given  that  searches  in  furtherance  of records \nmanagement  and  discovery  will  generally  not  be  formulated  to  retrieve  unminimized \ninformation  about  U.S.  persons  acquired  under  Section  702,  the  creation  of this  new \narchival  system  does  present  any new  cause  for  concern.  The  government  is  again \nadmonished,  however,  to  report  any  instance  of retention,  as  identified  by  FBI  personnel, \nof unminimized  Section  702-acquired  information  subject  to  the  reporting  requirement  in \nthe  October  18,  2018,  Opinion. \nD.  Retention/Searches  of  UAM  Systems \nSimilar  retention  and  reporting  requirements  apply  for  Section  702-acquired \ninformation  in  User-Activity  Monitoring  (UAM)  systems  under  Section  III.F.7  of the \n2019  FBI  Minimization  Procedures.  The  December  6,  2019,  Opinion  directed  the \ngovernment  to  update  its  descriptions  of these  UAM  systems  and  processes  employed  by \nthe  FBI,  CLA,  and  NSA  by no  later  than  March  26,  2021  — ie.,  two  years  from  the \ngovernment's  prior  UAM  submissions.  The  update  shall  describe  the  UAM  activities \nbeing  undertaken  by  each  agency  and  provide  an  assessment  as  to  whether  those  activities \nare  being  conducted  in  a  manner  consistent  with  applicable  Section  702  procedures.  See \nDec.  6,  2019,  Opinion  at  82-83.  This  reporting  requirement  shall  remain  in  effect. \nE.  Failure  to  Purge  Recalled  Reports \nIn  March  2019,  the  government  reported  that  NCTC  systems  did  not  purge  NSA \nreports  that  were  subsequently  recalled  by  NSA.  See  Preliminary  Notice  of Compliance \nbetter  Page  56 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 56 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re:  Section  702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nPSPO  SPOORE  RENOT  OTe \nIncident  Regarding  Incomplete  Purges  of Data  Acquired  Pursuant  to  FISA,  Mar.  13, \n2019.  Asaresult,  NCTC  analysts  continued  to  have  access  to  reports  that  potentially \ncontained  FISA  information  and  had  been  recalled  due  to  compliance  incidents.  Id.  at  2. \nSubsequent  investigation  revealed  that  the  CIA  and  NSA  also  had  systems  that  did \nnot  purge  reports  when  they  were  recalled,  including  for  FISA-compliance  reasons.  See \nDocket  lS ...:  in  Response  to  Order \nDated  Oct.  3,  2019,  Nov.  4,  2019,  at  4-7,  The  December  6,  2019,  Opinion  directed  the \ngovernment  to  report  by  February  28,  2020,  on:  1)  the  steps  taken  or  to  be  taken  by  the \nFBI,  NSA,  CIA,  and  NCTC  to  identify  to  recipient  agencies  when  reports  are  recalled  for \nFISA-compliance  reasons;  2)  other  steps  the  government  has  taken  or  will  take  to \nimprove  processes  for  identifying  and  removing  reports  that  are  recalled  for  FISA- \ncompliance  reasons;  and  3)  an  anticipated  timetable  for  completing  any  steps  that  remain \nto  be  taken.  See  Dec.6,  2019,  Opinion  at  82. \nThe  government’s  timely  filing  stated  that  ODNI  had  revised  its  DNI  Intelligence \nCommunity  policy  memorandum  to  add  a  new  category  under  which  intelligence \nproducts  could  be  recalled:  “FISA-compliance  recall.”  Docket  = \nee:  in  Response  to  Mem.

This  new  category  will  be  used  to  notify  recipients  that  a  product  has \nbeen  recalled  specifically  for  a  FISA-compliance  reason.  Id.  The  revised  IC  policy \nmemo  requires  a  FISA-compliance  recall  notice  to  “explicitly  state  the  product  is  being \nrecalled  for  a  FISA-compliance  reason  and  must  be  removed  with  steps  taken  to  prevent \n— FOP-SECREFHHSHORCONNOFORA—  Page  57 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 57 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18,    2020\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nmtnaitne eneeicp ntnhireechenpthehee  \nits  further  use  or disclosure.”  Id.  The  revised  DNIIC  policy  memo  also  requires  each \nrevision  or  recall  notice  to  specify  a  point  of contact  who  can  provide  additional  details \non  why  the  notice  was  issued.  Jd.  The  revised  DN]  policy  was  signed  and  issued  on \nFebruary  27,  2020,  but  the  government was  not  able  to  provide  an  estimated  timeline  for \nimplementation  of the  revised  policy.  Id.  at  5-6. \nAccording  to  the  September  2020  Quarterly  Report,  the  revised  policy  directs  all \nIC  elements  to  revise  their  internal  regulations  to  implement  the  new  procedures.  See \nQuarterly  Report  Concerning  Compliance  Matters  Under  Section  702,  Sept.  18,  2020,  at \n63  (“Sept.  2020  Quarterly  Report”).  FBI,  NSA,  CIA,  and  NCTC  will  review  their \ninternal  regulations  and  procedures  and  take  the  necessary  actions  to  comply  with  the \nrevised  policy to  include  system  modifications  to  create  the  new  FISA-compliance  recall \ncategory  in  the  reporting  process.  Id.  As  of that  report,  the  government  was  still  in  the \nprocess  of creating  a  timeline  for  implementation  based  upon  agencies’  review  of the \nrevised  policy  and  their  relevant  internal  regulations  and  procedures.  Id. \nWhile  the  Court  is  pleased  with  the  revisions  that  have  been  made  to  the  DNI  IC \npolicy  memo,  those  revisions  must  be  implemented  in  order  to  be  effective.  The  Court \naccordingly,  is  ordering  the  government  to  provide  regular  reports  on  the  status  of \nimplementation. \nF.  Other  Incidents  of Non-Compliance \nThe  government  has  reported  a  number  of other  incidents  of noncompliance  since \nthe  December  6,  2019,  Opinion.  For  example,  NSA  has  sometimes  erred  in  tasking \nFORE CREEHSEORCOIENOFORR  Page  58 \nAuthorized for Public Release on April 26, 2021  Page 58 of 67  FISC Opinion, Nov.  18, 2020\nDocument re:  Section  702 2020 Certification  Authonzed for Public Release by ODNI \nT“POTo STOrCK  ronOn  eOTOn  \nfacilities  for  acquisition  because of insufficient  or  incomplete  foreignness  checks, \nincorrect  processing  of requests  for  administrative  updates  on  a  facility  that  resulted  in \nNSA  retasking  the  facility  without  fully  applying  its  targeting  procedures;  or  because  the \nconnection  between  the  targeted  user  and  an  authorized  foreign  power  or  foreign  territory \nwas  sufficiently  attenuated.  See,  e.g.,  June  2020  Quarterly  Report  at  8-17;  Sept.  2020 \nQuarterly  Report  at  8-14.  In  other  incidents,  NSA  failed  to  timely  detask  facilities  when \nrequired  to  do  so  under  applicable  targeting  procedures  because  of human  error,  including \nreasons  such  as  misunderstanding  the  procedures  and  communication  failures  among \nagencies.  Some of  these  delays  have  been  exacerbated  from  reduced  staffing  as  a  result \nof the  ongoing  coronavirus  pandemic. See, e.g.,  June  2020  Quarterly  Report  at  17-26; \nSept.  2020  Quarterly  Report  at  16-21.  There  have  also  been  incidents  in  which  the  FBI \napproved  request  rior  to  completing  all  resuied \n         \nBI  sccciurs  See,  e.g.,  June  2020  Quarterly  Report  at  46;  Preliminary  Notice  of \nCompliance  Incidents  Regarding  Section  702-Tasked  Accounts,  July  6,  2020  (FBI- \napproved  inappropriate  for  tasking). \nIn  one  reported  instance,  the  FBI  failed  to  timely  establish  a  review-team  process \n   \nto  protect  attorney-client  communications  after  a  Section  702  target  had  been  charged \n    \nwith  a  federal  crime.

Id. \nAfter  considering  the  matters  discussed  above  and  other  incidents  reported  by  the \ngovernment  and  assessing  the  overall  state  of implementation  of the  current  targeting, \nquerying,  and  minimization  procedures,  the  Court  finds  that  the  proposed  procedures,  as \nreasonably  expected  to  be  implemented,  comply  with  applicable  statutory  and  Fourth \nAmendment  requirements.  It  will,  however,  continue  to  monitor  the  government’s \nimplementation  of the  procedures,  especially  regarding  U.S.-person  queries. \nVil.

(U)  GENERAL PROVISIONS\nA.  (U)  In accordance with 50 U.S.C. §§  1801(h), 1821(4), and 1881a(c)(l)(A), these\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) minimization procedures govern the acquisition, retention, \nand dissemination of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United States \npersons that is acquired by targeting non-United States persons reasonably believed to be located \noutside the United States pursuant to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n1978, as amended (FISA or \"the Act\"), 50 U.S.C. § 1881a.  The Attorney General, in \nconsultation with the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), has adopted these procedures after \nconcluding that they meet the requirements under 50 U.S.C. §§  1801(h) and 1821(4) because \nthey are specific procedures that are reasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique of \nthe particular surveillance or physical search to minimize the acquisition and retention, and \nprohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United \nStates persons consistent with the need of the United States to obtain, produce, and disseminate \nforeign intelligence information and otherwise comport with the statutory definition of \nminimization procedures.  In accordance with 50 U.S.C. § 3024(£)(6), the DNI has provided \nassistance to the Attorney General with respect to the dissemination procedures set forth herein \nso that FISA-acquired information may be used efficiently and effectively for foreign \nintelligence purposes.  These minimization procedures apply in addition to separate querying \nprocedures adopted pursuant to subsection 702(£)(1) of the Act.  These minimization procedures \nshould be read and applied in conjunction with those querying procedures, and nothing in these \nprocedures permits any actions that would otherwise be prohibited by those querying procedures. \nB.  (U)  For the purpose of these procedures:\n1.  the term \"applicable FISA authority\" refers to section 702 of the Act;\nSECRET//NOFORN \n1 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021 Page 6 of 54 FBI's Section 702 Minimization Procedures, Oct. 19, 2020\n\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Relg8ge by ODNI  \n2.  references to \"information acquired pursuant to FISA\" and \"FISA-acquired \ninformation\"  will be understood to mean communications and information  acquired pursuant to \nsection 702 of the Act, and \n3.  References to \"target\" will be understood to refer to the user(s) of a tasked facility. \nC.  (U) Pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §§ ]806(a), no information acquired pursuant to FISA may be \nused or disclosed by Federal officers or employees except for lawful purposes. Information \nacquired pursuant to section 702 concerning United States persons may be used and disclosed by \nFederal officers and employees without the consent of the United States persons only in \naccordance with these minimization procedures. These procedures do not apply to publicly \navailable information concerning United States persons, nor do they apply to information that is \nacquired, retained, or disseminated with a United States person's consent. In addition, except for \nthe provisions set forth below regarding the handling of information that is acquired in a manner \ninconsistent with certain of the limitations set forth in section $02(b), the use or disclosure of \ninformation as described in Section III.H.l of these procedures, attorney-client communications, \nthe use of FISA-acquired information in criminal proceedings in the United States and foreign \ncountries, and the disclosure of raw FISA-acquired information  to other agencies, these \nprocedures do not apply to information concerning non-United States persons. \nD.  (U) These procedures adopt the definitions set forth in 50 U.S.C. § 1801 , including those \nfor the terms \"foreign intelligence information\" and \"United States person.\" For purposes of \nthese procedures, if an individual is known to be located in the United States, he or she should be \npresumed to be a United States person unless the individual is identified as an alien who has not \nbeen admitted for permanent residence or circumstances give rise to the reasonable belief that the \nindividual is not a United States person. If an individual is known to be located outside the \nSECRET/»'T\\'(IFORN' \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page  of 54  FBI's Section 702 Minimization Procedures, Of. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI  \nSECRET//N0r0N:~4 \nUnited States, he or she should be presumed to be a non-United States person unless the \nindividual is identified as a United States person or circumstances give rise to the reasonable \nbelief that the individual is a United States person.  If it is not known whether an individual is \nlocated in or outside of the United States, he or she should be presumed to be a non-United \nStates person unless the individual is identified as a United States person or circumstances give \nrise to the reasonable belief that the individual is a United States person. A person known to have \nbeen at any time an alien admitted for lawful permanent residence is treated as a United States \nperson, unless a determination that such person is no longer a United States person is made (a) in \nconsultation with the FBI Office of General Counsel after obtaining a copy of either an order \nrevoking that person's United States person status issued by a U.S. federal court or a properly \nexecuted and filed United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Form 1-407 (Record of \nAbandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status), or (b) in consultation with the FBI Office \nof General Counsel and the National Security Division (NSD) of the Department of Justice. \nE.  (U) If FBI personnel, which, for the purposes of these procedures, includes all \ncontractors and others authorized to work under the direction and control of the FBI on FISA- \nrelated matters, encounter a situation that they believe requires them to act inconsistently with \nthese procedures in order to protect the national security of the United States, enforce the \ncriminal law, or protect life or property from serious harm, those personnel immediately should \ncontact FBI Headquarters and NSD's Office of Intelligence to request that these procedures be \nmodified.

(U) Access to FISA-acquired information retained in any form. The FBI must \nretain all FISA-acquired information under appropriately secure conditions that limit access to \nsuch information only to individuals who require access in order to perform their official duties \nor assist in a lawful and authorized governmental function.  FBI personnel with access to raw \nFISA-acquired information must receive training on these minimization procedures before \nreceiving access to raw FISA-acquired information. Access to FISA-acquired information \n(5) may not intentionally acquire communications that contain a reference to, but are not to or from a target \nof an acquisition authorized under subsection (a), except as provided under section l03(b) of the FISA \nAmendments Reauthorization Act of 2017, and \n(6) shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the fourth amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates.\" \n6 (U) In applying this provision, note that any user of a tasked facility is regarded as a person targeted for acquisition. \nSECllET.'fNOFORI'i \n7 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page 12 of 54  FBI's Section 702 Minimization Procedures, Of. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI  \nSECIlET1'.'NOl\"OIlN \ncontained within different systems shall be appropriately restricted, even when the systems are \nnot physically separated.

Notwithstanding the above, if any such information indicates that a \nperson targeted under section 702 has entered the United States, nothing in these procedures \nshall prevent the FBI from retaining and providing to the National Security Agency (NSA), \n§3 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page  of 54  FBI's Section 702 Minimization Procedures, Of. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI  \nSECIIETHNOFOIIN \nCentral Intelligence Agency (CIA), or National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) technical \ninformation derived from such information for collection avoidance purposes. \nB.  (U) Definitions.  For purposes of these procedures: \nl.  (U)  \"FISA-acquired information\" means all information that the FBI acquires \nfrom an acquisition conducted pursuant to section 702 of FISA. \n2.  (D,'.\"' IF) \"Raw FISA-acquired information\" is FISA-acquired information that (a) \nis in the same or substantially same format as when the FBI acquired it, or (b) has been \nprocessed only as necessary to render it into a fonn in which it can be evaluated. Illustrative \nexamples of raw FISA-acquired information include audio recordings of intercepted \ncommunications (including copies thereof), soft or hard copies of e-mails \nligital images obtained \nlectronic storage media, verbatim translations of documents or \ncommunications, and intercepted communications that have been processed into the form of \n\"tech cuts\" but have not been evaluated to determine whether the tech cuts reasonably appear to \nbe foreign intelligence information, to be necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation or to assess its importance, or to be evidence of a crime. Raw FISA-acquired \ninformation, however, does not include information the FBI has determined, in accordance with \nthese procedures, to reasonably appear to be foreign intelligence information, to be necessary to \nunderstand foreign intelligence information or to assess its importance, or to be evidence of a \ncrime. \n3.  (U)  An \"electronic and data storage system\" is any FBI application, program, \ndevice, or process that retains or provides access to raw FISA-acquired information in electronic \nform and meets the requirements in Sections III.C and III.D. An electronic and data storage \n9 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page 14 of 54  FBI's Section 702 Minimization Procedures, Of. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI  \nso; ERETHNOFOIIN \nsystem may reside on a server or network or may consist of a single stand-alone terminal or \ndevice. The FBI shall maintain and make widely available within FBI and to NSD a current list \nof all systems deemed to be electronic and data storage systems. \n4.  (U)  An \"ad hoc system\" is any FBI application, program, device, or process that \ndoes not meet the definition of electronic and data storage system above, that is not governed by \nSection III.F, and that retains or provides access to raw FISA-acquired information. Ad hoc \nsystems may only be used by FBI personnel who are engaged in or assisting with a particular \ninvestigation and when such FBI personnel have reasonably determined that for technical, \nanalytical, operational or security reasons they cannot fully, completely, efficiently or securely \nreview or analyze raw FISA-acquired information in an electronic and data storage system. An \nad hoc system may reside on a server or network or may consist of a single stand-alone terminal \ndevice. \nOI' \n5.  (U)  \"Query\" means the use of one or more terms9 to retrieve the unminimized \ncontents or noncontents (including metadata) of section 702-acquired information that is located \nin a covered agency's system. The term \"quell\" does not include a user's query of a system that \ncontains unminimized section 702-acquired information, where the user does not receive \nunminimized section 702-acquired information in response to the query either because the user \nhas not been granted access to the unminimized section 702-acquired information, or because a \nuser who has been granted such access has limited the query such that it cannot retrieve \nunminimized section 702-acquired information.

(U)  Additional Provisions Regarding Access, Review, and Use of FISA-Acquired \nInformation \n1.  (U) Review and use of FISA-acquired information retained in any form. \n3..  (U) General. The FBI may make raw FISA-acquired information \navailable to authorized personnel on a continuing basis for review, translation, analysis, and use \nin accordance with these procedures. Authorized personnel may continue to access raw FISA- \nacquired information to determine whether it reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence \ninformation, to be necessary to understand foreign intelligence information or to assess its \nimportance, or to be evidence of a crime notwithstanding the fact that other FBI personnel \npreviously may have reviewed such information and determined that it did not reasonably appear \nto be foreign intelligence information, to be necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation or to assess its importance, or to be evidence of a crime at the time of such review. \n(U)  FBI personnel with authorized access to raw FISA-acquired information may review, \ntranslate, copy, transcribe, analyze, summarize, and use all such information only in accordance \nwith these procedures and FISA and only as necessary for the purpose of evaluating or \ndetermining whether it reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information, to be necessary \nto understand foreign intelligence information or to assess its importance, or to be evidence of a \nlo (U)  For example, the action of a system user to sort the results of a query (i.e., the information actually returned \nto a system user from a query) by date, time, etc. \nII (U)  For example, an analyst might run a script against a spreadsheet that would find and replace all instances of a \nknown United States person's name with a generic term, such a \"U.S. Person I.\" \nJ \nl 1% \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page  of 54  FBI's Section 702 Minimization Procedures, Of. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI  \ncrime. Such personnel shall exercise reasonable judgment in making such evaluations or \ndeterminations. \n(U)  With respect to information acquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act, only those \nFBI personnel who have received training on these minimization procedures may be designated \nas case coordinators. All FBI personnel having access to information acquired pursuant to \nsection 702 of the Act will be informed of and provided access to these minimization procedures. \nb.  (U) Information  meeting criteria.  Once FBI personnel have assessed that \nraw FISA-acquired information reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information, to be \nnecessary to understand foreign intelligence information or to assess its importance, or to be \nevidence of a crime, the FBI may retain that information for further investigation and analysis \nand may disseminate it in accordance with these procedures.  Pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §§ l80l(h)(3) \nand l82l(4)(C), however, information that is assessed to be evidence of a crime but not to be \nforeign intelligence information or necessary to understand foreign intelligence information may \nonly be retained and disseminated for law enforcement purposes. \nc.  (U) United States person identities. Before using FISA-acquired \ninformation for further investigation, analysis, or dissemination, the FBI shall strike, or substitute \na characterization for, information of or concerning a United States person, including that \nperson's identity, if it does not reasonably appear to be foreign intelligence information, to be \nnecessary to understand or assess the importance of foreign intelligence information, or to be \nevidence of a crime. Processing or analyzing FISA-acquired information within an electronic \nand data storage system or ad hoc system does not trigger this requirement. This requirement is \nalso not triggered by transferring FISA-acquired information between or among electronic and \ndata storage systems, ad hoc systems, collection platforms, or systems used solely for audits and \nanbnu, l IILwurunul \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page1121 of 54  FBI's Section 702 Minimization Procedures, Of. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI  \n£`IECRETf/NOFORN \noversight.  However, when FBI transfers or copies FISA-acquired information from an electronic \nand data storage system, ad hoc system, or system used for transitory retention onto a medium, \ndevice, or system that is not an electronic and data storage system or ad hoc system as defined by \nthese procedures, any information of or concerning a U.S. person, including that person's \nidentity, that is being transferred that does not meet the retention standard (i.e., reasonably \nappears to be foreign intelligence information, to be necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation or assess its importance, or to be evidence of a crime) must be stricken or a \nsubstitution made prior to the transfer. \nd.  (U) Disclosure and dissemination. The FBI may disclose or disseminate \ncopies, transcriptions, summaries, and other documents containing FISA-acquired information \nonly in accordance with the disclosure and dissemination procedures set forth in Section IV \nbelow. \ne.  (U) Exculpatory, impeachment, and discoverable material.  The FBI shall \nretain FISA-acquired information that is not foreign intelligence information that has been \nreviewed and reasonably appears to be exculpatory or impeachment material for a criminal \nproceeding, or reasonably appears to be discoverable in a criminal proceeding, and shall treat \nthat information as if it were evidence of a crime. \nf.  (U) Sensitive information.  Particular care should be taken when \nreviewing information that is sensitive information, as defined below. No sensitive information \nmay be used in an analysis or report (such as an Electronic Communication (EC)) unless it is \nfirst determined that such information reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information, \nnecessary to understand foreign intelligence information or assess its importance, or evidence of \na crime.

Information that reasonably appears to be \nevidence of a crime may be retained, processed, and disseminated for law enforcement purposes \nin accordance with these procedures, even if it is sensitive information. Sensitive information \nconsists of: \n(a)  Religious activities of United States persons, including consultations with clergy; \n(b)  Educational and academic activities of United States persons, including \nconsultations among professors or other teachers and their students, \n(C)  Political activities of United States persons, including discussions with Members \nof Congress and their staff, and other elected officials, \n(d)  Activities of United States persons involving the press and other media, \n(e)  Sexual and other highly personal activities of United States persons, \n(D  Medical, psychiatric, or psychotherapeutic activities of United States persons, and \n(g)  Matters pertaining to United States minor children, including student requests for \ninformation to aid in academic endeavors. \n2.  (U) Procedures Regarding Access to FISA-acquired Information Retained in \nElectronic Form. \n(U) The FBI may grant access to FISA-acquired information to all authorized personnel \nin accordance with policies established by the Director, FBI, in consultation with the Attorney \nGeneral or a designee. The FBI's policies regarding access shall vary according to whether \naccess includes raw FISA-acquired information, shall be consistent with the FBI's foreign \nintelligence information-gathering and information-sharing responsibilities, and shall include \nprovisions: \n11 % \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page  of 54  FBI's Section 702 Minimization Procedures, Of. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Relg8ge by ODNI  \nSNCNNW/NOFOIIN \na.

Requiring training on these minimization procedures and the FBI's \npolicies regarding access to raw FISA-acquired information before \ngranting access to raw FISA-acquired information. \n(U) The FBI shall provide such policies to the Court when these procedures go into \neffect. Thereafter, the FBI shall provide any new policies or materially modified policies to the \nCourt on a semiannual basis. \nD.  (U) Electronic and Data Storage Systems \n1.  (U) Access to information and auditing requirement. The FBI shall maintain \naccurate records of all persons who have accessed FISA-acquired information in electronic and \ndata storage systems and audit its access records regularly to ensure that FISA-acquired \ninformation is only accessed by authorized individuals, including FBI personnel and the \nindividuals referenced in Sections III.H.4 and V.A of these procedures. \n2.  (U) Marking. The FBI shall require the primary case agent(s) and his/her/their \ndesignees (hereinafter \"case coordinaton(s)\") to control the marking of raw FISA-acquired \ninformation in a particular case that is maintained in an electronic and data storage system. A \nmarking, for example, would include an indication that the information is foreign intelligence \ninformation. The FBI shall identify FISA-acquired information in electronic and data storage \nsystems that has been reviewed and whether that information has been determined to reasonably \nappear to be foreign intelligence information, to be necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation or to assess its importance, or to be evidence of a crime. \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Pagelll of 54  FBI's Section 702 Minimization Procedures, Of. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI  \nSECRETHNOFOIIN \n3.

(U)  GENERAL PROVISIONS \n1.  (U) In accordance with 50 U.S.C. §§ l80l(h), l82l(4), and 188la(c)(1)(A), these NCTC \nminimization procedures govern the retention, processing, and dissemination of \ninformation acquired by targeting non-United States persons reasonably believed to be \nlocated outside the United States pursuant to section 702 ofFISA, 50 U.S.C. § l88la. \nThe Attorney General, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), \nhas adopted these procedures after concluding that they meet the definition of \nminimization procedures under 50 U.S.C. §§ l80l(h) and l82l(4), because they are \nspecific procedures that are reasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique of \nthe particular surveillance or physical search to minimize the retention, and prohibit the \ndissemination, of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United \nStates persons consistent with the need of the United States to obtain, produce, and \ndisseminate foreign intelligence information and otherwise comport with the statutory \ndefinition of minimization procedures. In accordance with 50 U.S.C. § 3024(t)(6), the \nDNI has provided assistance to the Attorney General with respect to the dissemination \nprocedures set forth herein so that section 702-acquired information may be used \nefficiently and effectively for foreign intelligence purposes. \n2.  (U) No information acquired pursuant to section 702 may be used or disclosed by NCTC \npersonnel except for lawful purposes. Information acquired pursuant to section 702 \nconcerning United States persons may be used and disclosed by NCTC personnel without \nthe consent of such United States persons only in accordance with these minimization \nprocedures. These procedures do not apply to publicly available information concerning \nUnited States persons, and do not apply to information that is acquired, retained, or \ndisseminated with a United States person's consent.

Except as specifically provided herein, all \ninformation acquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act and provided to NCTC in raw \nform shall be identified in NCTC records, systems, documents, disseminations, and other \nproducts as having been acquired pursuant to the Act. This requirement applies to \ninformation regardless of whether NCTC has subje cted it to minimization procedures. \nB.  (U)  RETENTION \nI.  (U) NCTC may maintain raw section 702-acquired information. Raw section 702- \nacquired information must be maintained in a manner that (a) clearly identifies it as raw \nsection 702 information acquired pursuant to the Act, (b) only permits such information \nto be accessed by NCTC personnel who have received training in applying these \nprocedures to raw section 702-acquired information, and (c) enables NCTC to mark or \notherwise identify communications or other information that meet the standard set forth \nin paragraph B(3) herein. Notwithstanding the access restriction above, NCTC personnel \nwho are undergoing, but have not yet completed, training regarding the proper \nimplementation of section 702 and NCTC's section 702 procedures, may have access to \nraw section 702-acquired information during the conduct of such training and insofar as \nreasonably necessary for it to be effective. The retention provisions herein apply \nnotwithstanding other Attorney General guidelines governing NCTC's retention of \ninformation. \n2.  (U)  Subject to the above: \na.  (U)  Raw section 702-acquired information in NCTC systems that NCTC does not \nreview shall be destroyed five years from the expiration date of the certification \nauthorizing the collection unless the Assistant Director for Intelligence or the \nAssistant Director for Identity Intelligence of NCTC determines that an extension is \nnecessary because the information is reasonably believed to contain significant \nforeign intelligence information, or evidence of a crime that has been, is being, or is \nabout to be committed. An extension under this paragraph may apply to a specific \nJ \n5 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page 5 of 16  NCTC's Section 702 Minimization Procedures, Oct. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Seclion 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \ncategory of information, and must be documented in writing, renewed on an annual \nbasis, and promptly reported to ODNI and NSD, which will promptly notify the FISC \nin writing of all such determinations. \nb.  (U) Raw section 702-acquired information that NCTC reviews, but does not mark or \notherwise identify as meeting the standard set forth in paragraph B(3) herein, may be \nretained and be fully accessible by authorized personnel for further review and \nanalysis for ten years from the expiration date of the certifi cation authorizing the \ncollection. No longer than ten years from the expiration date of the certification \nauthorizing the collection, access to such information in electronic and data storage \nsystems will be limited to search capabilities that would produce notice to an \nauthorized user that information responsive to a query exists. Approval from the \nAssistant Director for Intelligence or the Assistant Director for Identity Intelligence \nof NCTC or designee will be required to gain full access to the information. \nInformation that has not been marked or otherwise identified as meeting the standard \nset forth in paragraph B(3) shall be destroyed no later than fifteen years from the \nexpiration date of the certification authorizing the collection of the information unless \nspecific authority is obtained from the Director of NCTC and NSD to retain the \ninformation, and the FISC approves a new retention period upon a finding that such \nmodification is consistent with the applicable statutol'y definition of \"minimization \nprocedures.\" \nC.  (U) Any communications acquired pursuant to section 702 that contain a reference to, \nbut are not to or from, a person targeted in accordance with section 702 targeting \nprocedures are unauthorized acquisitions and therefore will be destroyed upon \nrecognition \n3.  (U) Nonpublicly available information concerning an unconsenting United States person \nthat the NCTC personnel responsible for applying these procedures has determined \nreasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information, to be necessary to understand \nforeign intelligence information or assess its importance, or to be evidence of a crime \nmay also be retained and used for  her analysis without the limitations set forth in \nparagraph B(l) above. Such information shall be clearly identified in NCTC systems and \nrecords as information that was acquired pursuant to FISA and that is subje ct to these \nprocedures. These procedures do not limit the time period for which NCTC may retain \nsuch information. Information that is evidence of a crime that has been, is being, or is \nabout to be committed, but is not foreign intelligence information, may only be retained \nand disseminated for law enforcement purposes. \n4.  (U) Any information received by NCTC that is acquired through the targeting of a \nperson who at the time of targeting was reasonably believed to be a non-United States \nperson located outside the United States but is in fact located inside the United States at \nthe time such information is acquired or is subsequently determined to be a United States \n2 (U)  In applying this provision, note that any user of a tasked selector is regarded as a person targeted for \nacquisition. \nJ  J \n6 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page 6of16  NCTC's Section 702 Minimizaiion Procedures, Of. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Seclion 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nJ \nperson will be promptly destroyed upon recognition, unless the Director of NCTC \nspecifically determines in writing that each specific item of acquired information to be \nretained is reasonably believed to contain significant foreign intelligence information or \nevidence of a crime that has been, is being, or is about to be committed. \n5.  (U)  NCTC may temporarily retain specific section 702-acquired information that would \nothewvise have to be destroyed under these procedures, if NSD determines that such \ninformation is reasonably believed to be necessary for, or potentially discoverable in, \nadministrative, civil, or criminal litigation. Such determination shall be made in writing \nand shall identify the specific information to be retained and the particular litigation for \nwhich it is retained. Personnel unconnected to the particular litigation matter shall not \naccess the raw section 702-acquired information that is being temporarily retained for \nsuch litigation matter. Personnel shall only access the information being retained for \nlitigation-related reasons on a case-by-case basis after consultation with NSD. Once \nsection 702-acquired information is no longer reasonably believed to be necessary for, or \npotentially discoverable in, such litigation matters, the information shall be promptly \ndestroyed pursuant to these procedures. Each year, NCTC will provide NSD with a \nsummary of: (a) all administrative, civil, or criminal litigation matters necessitating \npreservation of section 702-acquired information that would otherwise be subject to a \ndestruction requirement pursuant to these procedures, (b) a description of the section 702- \nacquired information preserved for each such litigation matter, and (c) if possible, based \non the information available to NCTC, a description of the status of each such litigation \nmatter. \n(U) NCTC may retain specific section 702-acquired information subje ct to a destruction \nrequirement other than those specified in these procedures if NSD determines that such \ninformation is reasonably believed to be necessary for, or potentially discoverable in, \nadministrative, civil, or criminal litigation. NCTC will provide NSD with a summary of: \n(a) all administrative, civil, or criminal litigation matters necessitating preservation of \nsection 702-acquired information that would otherwise be subject to a destruction \nrequirement other than those specified in these procedures, (b) a description of the section \n702-acquired information preserved for each such litigation matter, and (c) if possible, \nbased on the information available to NCTC, a description of the status of each such \nlitigation matter. NSD will promptly notify and subsequently seek authorization from the \nFISC to retain the information as appropriate and const stet with law. NCTC will restrict \naccess to and retain such information in the manner described in the paragraph above \nuntil either the FISC denies a government request for authorization to retain the \ninformation or the Department of Justice notifies NCTC in writing that such information \nis no longer required to be preserved for such litigation matters. After receiving such \nnotice, NCTC shall promptly destroy such section 702-acquired information. \nC.  (U) PROCESSING \nl.  (U) Queries of unminimized content or noncontent information acquired in accordance \nwith section 702 of the Act are governed by the Querying Procedures Used by the \nNational Counterterrorism Center in Connection with Acquisitions of Foreign \n7 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page 7of16  NCTC's Section 702 Minimizaiion Procedures, Of. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Seclion 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nJ  .r  J \nIntelligence Information Pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct of 1978, as Amended. All such queries conducted by NCTC personnel must be made \nin accordance with those procedures. Authorized NCTC users with access to \nunminimized section 702-acquired information should process the results of an \nappropriate query of unminimized section 702-acquired information in accordance with \nthese minimization procedures. \n2.  (U) NCTC may make raw section 702-acquired information available to authorized \nNCTC personnel on a continuing basis for review, translation, analysis, and use in \naccordance with these procedures. Authorized NCTC personnel may continue to access \nraw section 702-acquired information to determine whether it reasonably appears to be \nforeign intelligence information, necessary to understand foreign intelligence information, \nor necessary to assess the importance of foreign intelligence information, notwithstanding \nthe fact that other NCTC personnel may have previously evaluated such information. \n3.  (U)  NCTC personnel may query NCTC electronic and data storage systems that contain \nmetadata to find, extract, and analyze metadata pertaining to communications acquired \nunder section 702 of the Act, regardless of whether such communications are determined \nto satisfy the standards set forth in these procedures for retention or dissemination. Such \nqueries must be reasonably likely to return foreign intelligence information, as defined in \nFISA. NCTC may use such metadata to analyze communications and may upload or \ntransfer some or all of such metadata to NCTC electronic and data storage systems for \nauthorized foreign intelligence purposes. Section 702-acquired metadata shall be \nidentified as such in NCTC data repositories and shall be subject to the retention time \nperiods specified in paragraphs B(2) and B(3). Any dissemination outside of NCTC of \nmetadata from communications acquired under section 702 of the Act must be made in \naccordance with the applicable provisions of these procedures. \n4.  (U) Sensitive Information. Particular care should be taken when reviewing information \nthat is sensitive information, as defined below. No sensitive information may be used in \nan analysis or report unless it is first determined that such information reasonably appears \nto be foreign intelligence information, necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation or assess its importance, or evidence of a crime. Information that reasonably \nappears to be foreign intelligence information, necessary to understand foreign \nintelligence information, or necessary to assess the importance of foreign intelligence \ninformation may be retained, processed, and disseminated in accordance with these \nprocedures even if it is sensitive information. Information that reasonably appears to be \nevidence of a crime may be retained, processed, and disseminated for law enforcement \npurposes in accordance with these procedures, even if it is sensitive irNormation. \nSensitive information consists of: \na.

(U)  DISSEMINATION AND DISCLOSURE \n1.  (U) NCTC may disseminate to federal, state, local, territorial, or tribal agencies or \nofficials with responsibilities relating to national security that require access to foreign \nintelligence information any nonpublicly available information concerning an \nunconsenting United States person that reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence \ninformation, necessary to understand foreign intelligence information, or necessary to \nassess the importance of foreign intelligence information, if the United States person \nidentity is deleted or otherwise sanitized to prevent the search, retrieval, or review of the \nidentifying information.  A generic term may be substituted which does not identify the \nUnited States person in the context of the data.  If the information camiot be sanitized in \nsuch a manner because such person's identity is necessary to understand foreign \nintelligence information or assess its importance, NCTC may disseminate that identity. \nNCTC may only disclose section 702-acquired or section 702-derived information \nreceived from NSA or FBI in raw form as provided herein. \n2.  (U) Information that is evidence of a crime that has been, is being, or is about to be \ncommitted, but is not foreign intelligence information, may only be retained and \ndisseminated for law enforcement purposes. \n3.

(U) If NCTC ingests or transfers section 702-acquired information from FBI general \nindices into NCTC systems before reviewing such information, NCTC may presume that \nsuch information reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information, is necessary \nto understand or assess the importance of foreign intelligence information, or is evidence \nof a crime. If NCTC discovers any section 702-acquired information transferred from \nFBI general indices to NCTC systems that NCTC determines is evidence of a crime, but \ndoes not reasonably appear to be foreign intelligence information or necessary to \nunderstand or assess the importance of foreign intelligence information, NCTC shall \npromptly remove such information from all NCTC systems. \n4.  (U) NCTC personnel may only access FBI general indices, or review section 702- \nacquired information from FBI general indices that has been ingested or transferred into \nNCTC systems, if they first receive training regarding these limitations. \nF.

(U)  These procedures apply to the querying of unminimized information, acquired pursuant \nto section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as amended (\"FISA\" or \"the \nAct\"), by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"), and apply in addition to separate \nL' \nminimization  procedures for the FBI adopted pursuant to subsection $02(e) of the Act.  These \nquerying procedures should be read and applied in conjunction with those minirnizatioiif-  * \nprocedures, and nothing in these procedures permits any actions that would otherwiséylBé: \nprohibited by those minimization  procedures.

Authorized users with access to umninimized' \nsection 702-acquired information should process the results of an appropriate query of  K\" \nunminimized section 702-acquired information in accordance with the FBI's applicable section \n702 minimization procedures. \nII. (U) If the FBI determines that it must take action in apparent departure from these querying \nprocedures to protect against an immediate threat to human life (e.g., force protection or hostage \nsituations) and that it is not feasible to obtain a timely modification of these procedures, the FBI \nmay take such action immediately. The FBI will make a record of the action taken, to include \nany query term(s) used, and report the action taken to the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence (\"ODNl\") and to the Department of Justice's National Security Division (\"NSD\"), \nwhich will promptly notify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\") of such activity. \nIll. (U) Definitions and Presumptions \nA.  (U) Definitions for purposes of these procedures \n(U)  These procedures adopt the definitions set forth in 50 U.S.C. § 1801 for the terms \n\"foreign intelligence information,\"  \"person,\" \"United States,\" and \"United States person.\" \n.mm \n( S  When used to conduct a query, \"United States person query term\" means a term that \nis reasonably likely to identify one or more specific United States persons. United States \nperson query terms may be either a single item of information or information that, when \ncombined with other information, is reasonably likely to identify one or more specific United \nStates persons. Determining whether information is reasonably likely to identify one or more \nspecific United States persons in a particular context may require a case-by-case assessment \nslzclinwreor  ORN \nClussifiul Up.

Depending on the context, examples of \nUnited States person query terms may include: names or nninnp titles' **~*vpm\"\\e\"f- \nnal or corporate identification numbers \nd street address, telephone, and \nUnited States person query term does not include a reference to a product by brand or \nmanufacturer's name (or related nomenclature, including part numbers) or the use of a name \nin a descriptive sense, as, for example, \"Ford Crown Victoria\" or \"Boeing 737,\" so long as \nsuch term is not intended to retrieve information concerning a specific United States person \n(e.g., \"Ford Crown Victoria with License Plate Number CBA 32l\"). \n(U)  \"Query\" means the use of one or more termsI to retrieve the unminimized contents or \nnoncontents (including metadata) of section 702-acquired information that is located in an \nFBI system. The term \"query\" does not include a user's query of a system that contains \nunminimized section 702-acquired information, where the user does not receive unminimized \nsection '702-acquired information in response to the query either because the user has not \nbeen granted access to the unminimized section 702-acquired information, or because a user \nwho has been granted such access has limited the query such that it cannot retrieve \nunminimized section 702-acquired information.  The term \"query\" also does not include (1) a \nsystem user's actions subsequent to conducting a query for purposes of sorting the results of \nthat query based upon the attributes of the information retrieved,2 (2) examining or \nmanipulating, including by technical means, communications or documents for the purpose \nof minimizing such communications or documents,3 (3) searches done for UAM purposes in \nsystems or other repositories that contain UAM data, as defined in Section III.F.7 of the \nFBI's section 702 minimization procedures, so long as the only unminimized section 702- \nacquired information that the searches run against are in records captured through user \nactivity monitoring, or (4) searches conducted in the special purpose systems defined in  - \nSections IlI.F.5 and 6 of the FBI's section 702 minimization procedures in furtherance of an \nauthorized use specified in those provisions. \n(U) \"Contents\" means any information concerning the substance, puxport, or meaning of a \ncommunication. \n2 (U)  For example, the action of a system user to sort the results of a query (i.e., the in formation actually \nreturned to a system user from a query) by date, time, etc. \n3 (U)  For example, an analyst might run a script against a spreadsheet that would find and replace all \ninstances of a known United States person's name with a generic term, such as \"U.S. Person l.\" \nSEC IIETUN OFOIIN \n2 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page 2 of 6  FBI's Section 702 Quelling Procedures, Of. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Seclion 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \n(U)  \"Metadata\" means the dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information associated \nwith a communication, but does not include information concerning the substance, purport, \nor meaning of the communication. \n(U) The terms \"Federal Bureau of Investigation\" and \"FBI personnel\" refer to any \nemployees of the FBI, as well as all contractors and others authorized to work under the \ndirection and control of the FBI. \nB. (U) Presumptions for purposes of these procedures \n(U)  The following guidelines apply in determining whether a person whose status is \nunknown is a United States person: \nl.  (U)  A person known to be located in the United States will be treated as a United \nStates person unless the person is identified as an alien who has not been admitted for \npermanent residence or the circumstances give rise to the reasonable belief that such \nperson is not a United States person. \n2.  (U)  A person known to be located outside the United States, or whose location is \nunknown, will be treated as a non-United States person unless the person is identified \nas a United States person, or the circumstances give rise to the reasonable belief that \nsuch person is a United States person. \n3.  (U)  A person known to have been at any time an alien admitted for lawful permanent \nresidence is treated as a United States person, unless a determination that such person \nis no longer a United States person is made (a) in consultation with the FBI Office of \nGeneral Counsel after obtaining a copy of either an order revoking that person's \nUnited States person status issued by a U.S. federal court or a properly executed and \nfiled United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Form 1-407 (Record of \nAbandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status), or (b) in consultation with the \nFBI Office of General Counsel and NSD. \n4.  (U)  An unincorporated association whose headquarters or primary office is located \noutside the United States is presumed not to be a United States person unless there is \ninformation indicating that a substantial number Of its members are citizens of the \nUnited States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. \nIV. (U) Querying Procedures \nA. (U) Query Standard. \n1.  (U)  Each query of FBI systems containing unminimized contents or noncontents \n(including metadata) acquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act must be reasonably \nlikely to retrieve foreign intelligence information, as defined by FISA, or evidence of \na crime, unless otherwise specifically excepted in these procedures. \n3 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page 3 of 6  FBI's Section 702 Quelling Procedures, Of. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Seclion 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \n2.  (U)  For queries conducted using United States person query terms that are not \ndesigned to find and extract foreign intelligence information,  as defined by FISA, the \nFBI will follow the procedures in subsection 702(D(2) of FISA before accessing the \nuruninimized contents of communications retrieved by such queries in connection \nwith a predicated criminal investigation that does not relate to the national security of \nthe United States, unless there is a reasonable belief that such contents could assist in \nmitigating or eliminating a threat to life or serious bodily harm. Consistent with \nsubsections 702(f)(2)(F)(ii)-(iii)  of the Act, this restriction does not prohibit or limit \n(1) the FBI's ability to review, without a court order, the results of any query of \nsection 702-acquired information  that was reasonably designed to find and extract \nforeign intelligence information, regardless of whether such foreign intelligence \ninformation could also be considered evidence of a crime; and (2) the FBI's ability to \naccess the results of queries that were conducted when evaluating whether to open an \nassessment or predicated investigation related to the national security of the United \nStates. \n3.  (U)  Prior to reviewing the unminimized contents of section 702-acquired information \nretrieved using a United States person query term, FBI personnel will provide a \nwritten statement of facts showing that the query was reasonably likely to retrieve \nforeign intelligence information or evidence of a crime.4 Such written statement will \ncomply with the documentation requirements set forth in Section IV.B.4 below. \n(U)  This section does not apply to queries conducted using United States person \nquery terms that are not designed to find and extract foreign intelligence information \nand that are conducted in connection with a predicated criminal investigation.  Such \nqueries must comply with the requirements in Section IV.A.2.. \nB. (U) Creation and Maintenance of Query Records. \nl.  (U)  The FBI must generate and maintain an electronic record of each United States \nperson query term used for a query of uruninimized content or noncontent \ninformation acquired pursuant to section 702. Such electronic record must, at a \nminimum, include the following information; \na.  (U) the query term(s) used; \nb.  (U) the date of the query; and \nC.  (U) the identifier of the user who conducted the query. \n4 (U)  FBI personnel are not required to provide a written statement of facts before conducting any query \nor before reviewing the unminimized section 702-acquired noncontents (including metadata) retrieved \nusing a United States person query term. \n4 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page 4 of 6  FBI's Section 702 Quelling Procedures, Of. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Seclion 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \n2.  (U)  In the event it is impracticable for an FBI system to generate an electronic record \nof each United States person query term, or in the event an unanticipated circumstance \narises that prevents the generation of such an electronic record, the FBI must generate \nand maintain a written record of each United States person query term that contains \nthe same information required for electronic records, as described above. Before \nconducting a query in a system that does not generate an electronic record of a query, \nFBI personnel must reasonably determine that conducting that query in a system that \ngenerates an electronic record would be insufficient for technical, analytical, \noperational, or security reasons. \n3.  (U) The FBI will maintain the query records required by this subsection in a manner \nthat will allow NSD and ODNI to conduct oversight and compliance in an effective \nmanner. Such records (both electronic and written) must be maintained at least five \nyears from the date the United States person query term was used. NSD and ODNI \nwill review the FBI's queries of unminimized section 702-acquired information using \nany such query terms to ensure that they were reasonably likely to retrieve foreign \nintelligence information or evidence of a crime, or were otherwise conducted pursuant \nto one of the exceptions provided below. \n4.  (U)  The FBI shall maintain a record of each statement of facts required by Section \nIV.A.3 above in a manner that will enable oversight by NSD and ODNI. \nC.  (U) Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection IV.A above, nothing in these procedures \nshall prohibit the lawful oversight functions of NSD or ODNI, or the applicable Offices \nof the Inspectors General, or restrict the FBI from providing the assistance necessary for \nthese entities to perform their lawful oversight functions, and nothing in these procedures \nshall prohibit the FBI from conducting queries it determines are necessary to:  \n1.  (U)  the FBI's performance of lawful training functions of its personnel regarding the \nproper implementation of FISA and the FBI's FISA procedures, including its section \n702 procedures. However, the FBI shall use non-United States person query terms to \nperform such queries, unless the FBI determines that there is a particular need to use a \nUnited States person query term in such a query to conduct training on the \nimplementation of an aspect of the FBI's section 702 procedures, \n2.  (U)  create, test, or conduct technical maintenance of FBI systems that process or \nstore umninimized section 702-acquired information, \n3.  (U) comply with an order of a court within the United States or a specific \ncongressional mandate, such as a subpoena or similar process consistent with \ncongressional oversight,  . \n4.  (U)  comply with the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), \n5 U.S.C. § 552, or the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, \n5 \nAuthorized for Public Release on: April 26, 2021  Page 5 of 6  FBI's Section 702 Quelling Procedures, Of. 19, 2020 \n\nDocument re: Section 702 2020 Certification  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI \nSECRETf,'1'*IOll0IlN \n5.  (U) conduct vulnerability or network assessments  using unrninimized information \nacquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act in order to ensure that its systems are not \nor have not been compromised, \n6.  (U)  identify information that must be produced or preserved in connection with a \nlitigation matter, or \n7.  (U) perform the following lawful oversight functions of FBI's personnel or systems: \na.  (U) support the FBI's investigation and remediation of a possible FISA \ncompliance incident, \nb.  (U) remediate a potential spill of classified FISA-acquired information in FBI \nsystems,  '  . \nC.  (U) identify FISA-acquired information subje  t  to destruction, including \nunder the FBI's section 702 minimization procedures; \nd.  (U) ensure the effective application of marking or segregation requirements \nin the FBI's FISA minimization procedures, \ne.  (U) assess compliance with federal record-keeping requirements, where such \nqueries are conducted in audit and oversight systems, as defined in FBI's \nsection 702 minimization procedures, that contain FBI personnel e-mails and \ninstant messages that may contain unminimized section 702-acquired \ninformation, or \nf.  (U) support the FBI's audit or review, for quality control purposes, of work \n. \ndone related to FISA collection by FBI personnel. \n(U)  Should the FBI determine that it is necessary to deviate from an aspect of these \nprocedures to perform lawful oversight functions of its personnel or systems apart \nfrom those specified in this subsection (IV.C.7), the FBI shall consult with NSD and \nODNI prior to conducting such a query. NSD shall promptly report the deviation to \nthe FISC.» Each such report shall describe the nature of the deviation from the \nprocedures and identify the specific oversight activity for which the deviation was \nnecessary. \n(U)  Consistent with the requirements set forth in subsection IV.B above, the FBI must keep \na record of any United States person query term used for a query of unminimized section \n702-acquired information in support of the activities described in this subsection IV.C. \nl/ \n9 / 6   1'I \nDa e  WELLIAM p.
