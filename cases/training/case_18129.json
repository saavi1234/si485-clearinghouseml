A deadline for the production of all discovery served thus far is set for 10/28/21. Extensive argument took place regarding the Protective Order (PO) submitted by Defendants. The Court found that personnel and employment files, as well as OMI and similar reports should be covered by the PO. It clarified, however, that nothing could be filed under seal without court approval and this approval would be governed by the 3rd circuit decision in Avandia. If Defendants wanted something to be filed under seal, they would bear the burden of proof. The parties will confer and attempt to revise paragraphs 4 and 5 of the proposed order. Defendants will revise paragraph 1(v). There remains a dispute as to paragraph 3(a) and 6. Counsel will attempt to resolve this issue as well.

The Court will grant the motion to extend, which will cover only production of discovery already served and does not allow new discovery. There is no consensus as to a deadline for class certification and whether that should precede summary judgment. Counsel will confer and file a proposal as to deadlines no later than August 19. The parties would like to commence expert discovery, although the Court encourages settlement discussions while this is ongoing and offers its assistance if the parties so desire. The following deadlines are established: Plaintiffs' expert report due by 9/23/2022. Defendants' expert report due by 11/1/2022. Expert discovery deadline set for 12/9/2022. Telephonic status conference set for 12/16/2022 at 11:00 AM. Counsel for Plaintiff advised that the case was not a consent case due to an earlier Doe Defendant and suggested that the Court could send consent forms for discussion now that all Defendants have been identified.

The parties request until May 28, 2021 to mediate the case. Only written discovery will be needed. The Plaintiffs will make a demand, including monetary and non-monetary terms, 10 days prior to the mediation. Depending on the demand, Defendants will ensure that someone is present who can speak to any policy making issues as well as someone with complete settlement authority. The Mayor is excused from participating in the initial mediation but he or someone from his office may be required to participate at a later session. Counsel request additional time for class and fact discovery due to the complexity and to allow time for settlement discussions. The Court will allow this, given that both class and fact discovery will proceed in tandem. An Initial Scheduling Order will be entered. Following the conference, the Court realized that there is a John Doe Defendant and therefore, it cannot ask if the parties will consent to magistrate jurisdiction. This will impact whether the ruling on the Mayor's Motion to Dismiss will be via opinion or Report and Recommendation. A telephone conference will be scheduled for March 16, 2021 at 9:30 AM to discuss this. The same dial in numbers are to be used. Counsel are requested to confer to see if the identity of the Doe Defendant, described in the Complaint as the Tactical Commander of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police SWAT Unit during the events described, can be identified.

Expert discovery is complete, but Defendant has served a request for production for a document listed as reviewed by Plaintiff's expert. Plaintiff objects to the request on a number of grounds, including that the request, made on 1/13/23, was untimely. The Court will not disallow the request due to the timing. Plaintiff asks to be given the normal 30 days tor respond to the request and may respond with objections. If so, Defendant may file a motion to compel and brief the issue. The following deadlines are set: Plaintiffs response by 2/13/23; Motion to Compel by 2/23/23; Response by 3/9/23. Defendant intends to file summary judgment, but all agree that a judicial mediation after the discovery dispute is resolved and before summary judgment motions are filed would be of assistance. They do not agree to have the undersigned mediate due to the summary judgment potential but request another judicial settlement officer. The Court will see if someone is available and willing the mediate the case sometime in early April. A summary judgment deadline will be set for 30 days after a judicial mediation if the case does not resolve. (jmb) (Entered: 01/25/2023)"

    "summary": "<p>On June 29, 2020, six named plaintiffs filed this class-action lawsuit against the city of Pittsburgh and various elected and police officials in the Western District of Pennsylvania. The case was assigned to Judge Cathy Bissoon. The plaintiffs were non-violent protesters who gathered to protest police brutality in the wake of George Floyd's murder. Then the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police attacked them during these protests with flash-bang grenades, rubber bullets and tear gas. The plaintiffs argued that these actions violated their First Amendment right to freedom of speech and assembly and also constituted malicious prosecution in retaliation for constitutionally protected speech. Additionally, the plaintiffs argued that the defendants' actions violated their Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force and unlawful arrest. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief stating that these practices were unlawful as well as injunctive relief to prevent the defendants from continuing the practices in the future. The plaintiffs also sought compensatory damages, attorneys' fees and costs as appropriate.</p>\r\n<p>The case was referred to Magistrate Judge Lisa Pupo Lenihan. She recommended that the claims against the Mayor of Pittsburgh be dismissed, 2021 WL 1391761, and the court adopted this recommendation. 2021 WL 1390492. Magistrate Judge Lenihan then referred the case to mediation and appointed David B. White as the mediator on April 15, 2021.</p>\r\n<p>Parties filed a joint motion to extend the mediation deadline on May 19, 2021. The court granted an additional four months, setting September 27, 2021 as the deadline for dispute resolution. A month before the deadline, on August 30, plaintiffs filed motions to 1) extend the deadline once again and 2) request leave to file an amended complaint. The court granted both, setting March 31, 2022, as the new deadline, and giving plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint, which they filed on September 16, 2021. The complaint named three additional defendants; the Master Police Office for the PBP, the Commander of PBP&rdquo;s Special Deployment Division, and a PBP Lieutenant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 1, 2022, following the close of mediation, the mediator submitted a report stating the case had not been resolved. In a telephone conference before Magistrate Judge Lisa Pupo Lenihan ten days later, counsel for both parties stated they had reached an agreement regarding the injunctive relief, and intended to submit a proposed consent order. The order would detail the agreed upon process for addressing plaintiffs&rsquo; concerns, including a timeline. The parties were unable to reach an agreement as to an appropriate amount for damages.

They requested to continue with discovery while the policy review and settlement negotiations continued.</p>\r\n<p>The parties filed a joint motion for the proposed consent order on July 22, 2022, in which they agreed to develop a policy regarding 1) the use or prohibition of various munitions at protests, 2) methods of distinguishing between peaceful protestors and individuals engaged in criminal acts 3) circumstances under which a dispersal order is permissible, 4) contents of a permissible dispersal order; and 5) circumstances under which a protestor can be arrested for their failure to disperse. The parties agreed to first engage a third party expert and hold an intentional meeting with the expert and representatives of plaintiffs, the Mayor's Office, the PBP, and the Solicitor's Office. The City would then develop a proposed policy based on everyone&rsquo;s input. Any internal approval processes required for implementing the policy, such as review by the police union, would then be conducted. Finally, plaintiffs would determine if they approved of the proposed policy, and would either amend the complaint removing their request for injunctive relief, or notify the court that the process failed. The court entered the proposed order five days later, on July 27, 2022, setting a deadline of January 7, 2023 to complete the policy review.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 28, 2023, the court granted additional time for the policy review process, pushing the deadline back to March 17, 2023. On January 25, 2023, the parties concluded expert discovery and agreed to judicial mediation. The case was referred to Magistrate Judge Cynthia R. Eddy for settlement proceedings, and a hearing took place on March 23, 2023, in which the case was resolved. The parties agreed to a settlement amount of $275,000, to be divided among the plaintiffs. The case was closed administratively on March 24, 2023, with the court retaining jurisdiction to enforce the settlement.</p>",

See 95 S.Ct. 1443. \nOPINION OF THE COURT \nWEIS, Circuit Judge. \nA delicate balancing between the functions of the federal district court and the police \ndepartment of the City of Philadelphia is the essence of the controversy presented in this \nappeal. A finding by the trial court that a modification of internal procedures for handling \ncitizens' complaints is an adequate remedy for preventing future misconduct by a minority of \npolice officers is sufficiently supported by the record. But, an assessment of counsel fees in \nthis ยง 1983 case must be remanded for further proceedings. \nTwo separate cases were filed by different plaintiffs, all purporting, however, to represent \nessentially the same class of persons.[1] The defendants also were generally the same, \nbeing the Mayor and other city and police officials.[2] The two cases were consolidated by \nthe district judge for final disposition, and we therefore, as did he, treat this litigation as \nunitary. \nThe plaintiff produced evidence which the district court found adequate to establish a \npattern of violations of the legal and constitutional rights of citizens by Philadelphia police, \nparticularly in the areas of \"arrest for investigation, charges of resisting arrest when the \narrest was initially unlawful, extreme over-reaction to actual or reported assaults upon \npolicemen and in the treatment of people who question or criticize police activity in \nparticular instances.\" \nThe testimony was presented by victims of police misconduct or witnesses to it and \nencompassed more than thirty-five 545*545 incidents, not all of which were found to be \nexamples of improper activity on the part of the officers. The district judge summarized each \nincident in his voluminous findings of fact and concluded that, while misconduct is \nattributable to only a small percentage of the members of the police force, the violations \ntake place with such frequency that \"they cannot be dismissed as rare isolated instances; \nand that little or nothing is done by the city authorities to punish such infractions, or to \nprevent their recurrence.\"[3] \nThe existing police procedures for processing and adjudicating citizen complaints and for \nenforcing police discipline were evaluated, the court finding that the arrangements then \nexisting were totally inadequate because: \n1. The procedures were geared to handle infractions of police regulations but these rules \nwere not framed to cover specific violations of citizens' constitutional rights; \n2. Complaints were handled on a \"chain of command\" basis which discouraged civilian \ncomplaints; \n3. There was no adequate opportunity for the complainant to present his case to an \nobjective tribunal; \n\n4. The outcome of the proceedings were not disclosed; and \n5. There was a tendency to minimize consequences of proven police misconduct. \nAlthough the plaintiffs had asked for a sweeping equitable decree, including the \nappointment of a \"receiver\" to supervise the police department and the civilian review of \npolice activity, the trial court concluded that a much more limited form of relief was \nappropriate. It required the defendants to revise the procedures within the police \ndepartment for processing citizens' complaints against the police, including such matters as: \n1. Preparing and distributing appropriate forms for the submission of complaints; \n2. Prompt and adequate investigation; \n3. Adjudication by an impartial body insulated from command pressures; and \n4. Fair opportunity for both complainants and police officers to present their cases, followed \nby notification to the parties of the outcome. \nThe court stated that its guidelines pose no threat to vigorous law enforcement, are \nconsistent with generally recognized minimal standards, and impose no substantial burden \non the police department. The district court also concluded that an award of counsel fees \nand expenses to the plaintiffs was justified and assessed sums totalling $39,417.58 against \n\"the defendants.\" \nThe defendants appeal from the judgments in all respects. The plaintiffs COPPAR and \nGoode cross-appeal on the ground that the grant of counsel fees is inadequate, and \nCOPPAR cross-appeals from the denial of its request for the appointment of a receiver. \nI. \nWe first consider the defendants' challenge to the plaintiffs' standing to maintain this suit on \nthe ground that the requirements set out in O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 94 S.Ct. 669, \n38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974), have not been met. In that case the Supreme Court found a lack of \nstanding when the complaint did not allege injury on the part of any of the named plaintiffs \nand no class determination had been made. But, a few months later, in Allee v. Medrano, \n416 U.S. 802, 94 S.Ct. 2191, 2201, 40 L.Ed.2d 566 (May 21, 1974), the Court noted, \"... \nMoreover as, to this portion of the decree, directed at police misconduct generally rather \nthan to any particular state statute, named plaintiffs intimidated by misconduct may \nrepresent all others in the class of those similarly abused ...\" \n546*546 In the case sub judice, the named plaintiff, Gerald Goode, alleged in the complaint \nand established at the trial an incident where he was the victim of an illegal arrest and \nbeating by Philadelphia police.[4] Herbert Brown, another named plaintiff, alleged an illegal \nbeating by the police which presented an arguably constitutional violation. \nWhile the GOODE complaint is loosely drawn, a fair reading shows that the individual \nplaintiffs allege a series of illegal arrests and unauthorized entry into their homes by police \nofficers. Many of the named plaintiffs did not testify at the hearing. However, at the direction \nof the trial judge at a pretrial hearing, a list of other names and a description of the incidents \nin which they were involved were filed with the court. Although somewhat informal, this may \n\nproperly be considered an amendment to the complaint and was so treated by the district \ncourt. Many of these additional parties testified in the district court. \nAlthough more precision and attention to the appropriate procedural rules by the parties \nwould have been helpful, from a practical standpoint we conclude that the requisites for \nstanding have been met. \nThere is a distinction too between the underlying situation in the O'Shea case and the \ninstant litigation. In O'Shea v. Littleton, supra, the Court was concerned with the fact that the \ninjunction sought by the plaintiffs would affect events which would take place during state \ncriminal trials, thus violating the principles of Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, \n27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). Here, on the other hand, the plaintiffs were concerned with alleged \npolice practices which would not come to the attention of a state court in most instances \nbecause prosecutions were not instituted or were dismissed at a very early stage. \nFurthermore, unlike the O'Shea litigation, the Court did determine the applicable class to be \nall the citizens of Philadelphia and an included class of all black residents of the City.[5] \nII. \nThe trial court's conclusion that there were widespread violations of constitutional rights \nthrough police misconduct is attacked by the defendants as being inconsistent with the \nfinding that only a small percentage of the officers on the force are accountable for these \nactions. The defendants also assert that the number of separate incidents presented to the \ncourt formed an inadequate basis for a finding of a pattern or practice. \nThere is no mathematical formula which can be of assistance in determining how many \nwitnesses or how many incidents are needed to establish a pattern of conduct by any group \nin a community. The trial judge must work with the material that is presented to 547*547 him \nand must decide whether sufficient credible data are available to reach a conclusion. It is \nhis responsibility primarily, and an appellate court must accord great deference to that fact \nfinding process. In a case of this nature, too, we are conscious of the weight which must be \ngiven to the findings of a trial judge which are dependent upon and interwoven with \nintensely local conditions and circumstances. Mayor of Philadelphia v. Educational Equality \nLeague, 415 U.S. 605, 94 S.Ct. 1323, 39 L.Ed.2d 630 (1974); White v. Regester, 412 U.S. \n755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973).[6] \nWe have noted also, as did the district judge, that the police officials of Philadelphia entered \ninto a consent decree in Alexander v. Rizzo, supra,[7] agreeing to modify the procedures to \nbe followed when a person is to be interrogated in the course of a criminal investigation. \nCompliance with that decree will serve to prevent recurrence of some of the types of illegal \nconduct about which the plaintiffs here complained. We need not consider, nor did the \ndistrict court, whether this consent decree has any collateral estoppel effect as to the \nexistence of a pattern of misconduct by police officers. Nevertheless, it was a factor to \nwhich the trial judge could give some weight in arriving at his findings. \nOur review of the lengthy record in this case in addition to the contents of the appendix \nsubmitted by the parties does not reveal findings of fact which are clearly erroneous or \nconclusions which are not supported by reasonable interpretation of those underlying \n\nfacts. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 52; Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil ยงยง 2585, \n2587. \nWe conclude that there was an adequate evidentiary record to support the findings of the \ndistrict court that violations of constitutional rights by the Philadelphia police occurred in an \nunacceptably high number of instances and that in the absence of change in procedures \nsuch violations are likely to recur. \nThat we do not reverse the district court's conclusions, however, does not mean that we are \nunaware of the idealism and dedication of the vast majority of police officers. Their duties \nare difficult and dangerous, and the work which they perform is too often unheralded and \nunappreciated. Even a casual review of the record of the citations for bravery awarded to \nsome of the offending officers in this case cannot but impress the reader with the fact that \noften the most routine assignment may suddenly turn into one involving death or serious \ninjury to the policemen. And yet, we place upon these officers the additional burdens of \nalmost superhuman patience and forbearance in the face of hostile and provocative conduct \nand insist that they accord full legal protection and respect to those who would deny similar \ntreatment to the officers. But such high standards must be maintained because of the \ntremendous importance of police work to the maintenance of an orderly society without \nwhich no rights can survive. We would fail in the respect which we owe the vast majority of \npolicemen should we not fail to correct the derelictions of the few who do not meet the \ndifficult standards which the community requires. \nIII. \nThe district court's order granting relief is limited and moderate in tone indicating its faith in \nthe ability and willingness of the police department to investigate and correct the \ntransgressions of its errant members. Despite the assertions of the defendants, the court \nis 548*548 not thrusting itself into the day to day operations of the police departmentโa \nsituation which we agree would be inadvisable and inappropriate in the circumstances of \nthis case. Cf. Lankford v. Gelston, 364 F.2d 197 (4th Cir. 1966). Indeed, the procedures \nwhich the district court required be implemented by the police department for the receipt, \ninvestigation, and disposition of civilian complaints are fully in accord with the American Bar \nAssociation Standards Relating to the Urban Police Function, which were unanimously \napproved by the Executive Committee of the International Chiefs of Police in December, \n1972. \nWe agree with the district court in its refusal to appoint a \"receiver\" for the police \ndepartment as requested by COPPAR. Whether such action might ever be necessary in the \nmost extreme circumstances, we need not here consider because the factual situation in \nthis case would not warrant such action. See Build of Buffalo, Inc. v. Sedita, 441 F.2d 284 \n(2d Cir. 1971). \nWe emphasize that the district judge did not find that the plaintiffs were entitled to a change \nin the disciplinary procedures of the police department as a matter of constitutional right. \nThe decision on the necessity for relief was based upon violations of constitutional rights \nwhich had occurred and which he found would be recurring. It was only in the context of the \nproper remedy to be utilized that the district court reviewed the existing procedures and \n\nfound them inadequate. The revisions were one of the forms of relief available and were \nordered because they appeared to have the potential for prevention of future police \nmisconduct. Lewis v. Kugler, supra. See also The Federal Injunction as a Remedy for \nUnconstitutional Police Conduct, 78 Yale L.J. 143 (1968); Injunctive Relief for Violations of \nConstitutional Rights By the Police, 45 Colo.L.Rev. 91 (1973). \nIV. \nWhile we find no error in the injunctive relief decreed in this case, we do not believe that the \nrecord adequately explains the award of counsel fees to the plaintiffs. \nThe district court filed an order as follows: \n\"1. That the defendants shall pay to the plaintiffs in the Goode case, Civil Action No. 70-\n491, counsel fees in the sum of $25,000, plus disbursements and costs in the sum of \n$4,167.58. \n\"2. That the defendants shall pay to the plaintiffs in the COPPAR case, Civil Action No. 70-\n2430, counsel fees in the sum of $10,000, plus disbursements and costs in the sum of \n$250.\" \nThe accompanying memorandum recited that the court's discretion was exercised in favor \nof the award of counsel fees because \"[t]he cases were brought for the vindication of \nconstitutional rights, significant violations were established, and the plaintiffs succeeded in \nobtaining relief which should prove beneficial to all of the citizens of Philadelphia.\" The court \nalso noted that the parties had been unable to reach an amicable agreement, even after its \norder setting out guidelines had been filed, and that the results achieved could not have \noccurred without the need for litigation. Nevertheless, the memorandum concluded that \nwhile plaintiffs' counsel had performed a valuable public service,[8] punitive measures were \nnot called for. The memorandum and orders are ambiguous and leave us in doubt as to the \nbasis on which the court exercised its discretion and by whom the payments were to be \nmade. \n549*549 Even if statutory authority is lacking, in the exercise of their equitable powers \nfederal courts may award attorneys' fees when the interest of justice so requires. Hall v. \nCole, 412 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 1943, 36 L.Ed.2d 702 (1973). Although the rule is broadly stated, \nin application the power is generally exercised in three categories: \n1. Where there has been bad faith, vexation, or oppression. In this class of cases, the \npunitive aspects predominate. See e. g., Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, 390 U.S. 400, \n88 S.Ct. 964, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968); Monroe v. Board of Commissioners of City of \nJackson, 453 F.2d 259 (6th Cir. 1972). \n2. Where a common fund has been created, or closely analogous to this, where a definable \nclass benefits from the litigation and an award enables the court to spread the expense \namong all who benefit. E. g., Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., 396 U.S. 375, 90 S.Ct. 616, 24 \nL.Ed.2d 593 (1970). Cf. Brewer v. School Board of City of Norfolk, 456 F.2d 943 (4th \nCir.), cert. denied 406 U.S. 933, 92 S.Ct. 1778, 32 L.Ed.2d 136, sub nom. 409 U.S. 892, 93 \nS.Ct. 109, 34 L.Ed.2d 149 (1972). \n\n3. Where the private attorney general theory may have applicationโthat is, where the \nlitigation was instituted to vindicate a policy granted a high priority by a congressional \naction. See, e. g., Lee v. Southern Home Sites Corp., 444 F.2d 143 (5th Cir. 1971).[9] \nHowever, the equitable power may be circumscribed by Congress. Hall v. Cole, supra. \nAlthough 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 contains no language dealing with counsel fees, there have \nbeen awards under the general equitable power in some cases brought under the terms of \nthe statute. See Skehan v. Board of Trustees of Bloomsburg State College, 501 F.2d 31 \n(No. 73-1613, 3d Cir., May 3, 1974, amended June 11, 1974), and see the compilation of \ncases in Gates v. Collier, 489 F.2d 298 (5th Cir. 1973).[10] \nThe district court did not articulate the basis which it felt justified an award, and we think it \nimportant that this be done. Why the fees should be paid has significance in determining \nwho is liable, and we do not feel that we should engage in speculation as to the district \ncourt's rationale. \nWe have similar difficulty in divining the district court's intentions as to the source of funds to \nsatisfy the awards. There are two obvious alternatives: the defendants personally or the City \nof Philadelphia. Each choice, however, poses special problems which require examination \nby the district court, perhaps with additional fact finding for clarification. \nScheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974), makes clear that \nofficials in the executive department may be personally liable for damages in ยง 1983 cases. \nHowever, a qualified immunity is available as a defense when there is good faith on the part \nof the defendant. In Skehan v. 550*550 Board of Trustees, supra, we held that this immunity \nwould apply to assessments for counsel fees as well as to damages. \nIn the exercise of discretion, too, the district court should consider the fact that the \ndefendants apparently did not personally participate in the incidents which led to the \nnecessity of injunctive relief. Respondeat superior is not applicable in its traditional sense \nsince the defendant officials are not employers. Both subordinates and officials are \nemployees of the governmental unit. Jennings v. Davis, 476 F.2d 1271 (8th Cir. 1973). \nIn Bracey v. Grenoble, 494 F.2d 566 (3d Cir. 1974), this court assumed, arguendo, that no \ndamages for the actions of a subordinate could be imposed upon a governmental official in \nthe absence of his actual knowledge of, acquiescence in, or participation in the unlawful \nactivity. See also Vicarious Liability Under ยง 1983, 6 Ind.L.Rev. 509 (1973). \nFurthermore, we note that some of \"the defendants\" were not in office at the time the \nincidents arose and were substituted as parties only after the lawsuits were close to \nconclusion.[11] Similarly, some of the defendants who were officials during the period when \nthe incidents occurred were not included among those liable since they were not parties at \nthe time the order was entered.[12] \nTo summarize then, if it is the intention of the district court to find the defendants personally \nliable for an award of counsel fees, it will be necessary to consider the issues of: \n1. official immunity; \n\n2. vicarious liability; and \n3. identification of the individuals liable. \nAdditionally, if it is comtemplated that personal liability will be imposed, the equitable basis \nfor making any award will require analysis. For example, the equities involved in a private \nattorney general or spreading-the-cost theory are less apparent if individuals are being \nordered to reimburse the plaintiffs than if a large entity in which all claim membership is to \npay the assessment. Correspondingly, the traditional test of obduracy and intransigence \nmay have far more significance if individual liability is involved.[13] \nIf it is the thought that the City of Philadelphia, although not a party to this litigation, is to be \nthe source of the funds, then other issues must be passed upon by the district court with \nappropriate assistance from counsel. \nKenosha v. Bruno, 412 U.S. 507, 93 S. Ct. 2222, 37 L.Ed.2d 109 (1973), clarified some \nearlier uncertainty by holding that a city is outside the ambit of ยง 1983 \"for purposes of \nequitable relief as well as damages\" and may not be a named defendant in such a \ncase. Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), held that \nwhile an injunction could be issued against a state officer, damages or \"equitable restitution\" \ncould not be imposed when in fact they would come from the state. We held in Skehan v. \nBoard of Trustee, supra, that the prohibition of the Eleventh Amendment extends to an \naward of counsel fees from the state treasury, although that would not be so if the payment \nwere to be made by a college which was a subsidiary governmental unit.[14] \n551*551 The district court, therefore, should consider whether under the facts and \ncircumstances present in this case the rationale of Edelman as it deals with sovereign \nimmunity should apply to the statutory exclusion granted a city under ยง 1983.[15] \nAnother matter which may be of significance is whether any of the individual defendants \nwould have the power under the city charter or Pennsylvania law to authorize disbursement \nof funds in this situation. In exercising its discretion to award counsel fees, the district court \nwould no doubt be concerned with the efficacy of its pronouncement. \nThe issues which would be raised by an award of counsel fees in this case are broad and \ncomplex. We believe they should be resolved only upon a record which would clearly \nspecify the grounds upon which the district court relied. Of course, we take no position at \nthis time as to whether fees should be awarded or if so, against whom they should be \nassessed. \nThe judgment of the district court will be affirmed as to the injunctive relief granted but will \nbe vacated and remanded as to the award of counsel fees for further proceedings not \ninconsistent with this opinion. \n[1] The district court ordered that the Goode case could be maintained as a class action on behalf of all residents of \nthe City of Philadelphia and an included class of all black residents of Philadelphia. The complaint in \nthe COPPAR case alleged the class to be composed of the plaintiff and black and white persons in the City of \nPhiladelphia expressing political views contrary to defendants and advocating police responsibility to the \ncommunity. COPPAR is an acronym for the Council of Organization on Philadelphia Police Accountability and \nResponsibility. \n\n[2] The original complaint in the Goode case named the following defendants: \nJames H. J. Tate, Mayor, City of Philadelphia \nFred T. Corleto, Managing Director, City of Philadelphia \nFrank L. Rizzo, Commissioner of Police, City of Philadelphia \nRobert G. Selfridge, Deputy Commissioner of Police, City of Phila. \nWilliam Murphy, Captain, Police Department, City of Philadelphia \nBy Order of Court, dated September 11, 1973, the following defendants were substituted: \nFrank L. Rizzo, Mayor, City of Philadelphia \nHillel S. Levinson, Managing Director, City of Philadelphia \nJoseph F. O'Neill, Commissioner of Police, City of Philadelphia \nMorton B. Solomon, Deputy Commissioner of Police, City of Phila. \nWilliam Murphy, Captain, Police Department, City of Philadelphia \nIn COPPAR, the original named defendants were: \nHonorable James H. J. Tate; Frank L. \nRizzo; Fred T. Corletto; Arlen Spector. \nThe record does not reveal any substitution of the named defendants, despite the court's order of March 14, 1973, \ndirecting the plaintiffs to make appropriate amendments to the caption of the case to reflect changes in personnel. \n[3] COPPAR v. Rizzo, 357 F.Supp. 1289, 1319 (E.D.Pa.1973). \n[4] In a suit for damage in the state court against the individual police officers and the City of Philadelphia Goode was \ngiven a judgment by a board of arbitration against the City of Philadelphia although no finding was entered against \nthe policemen personally. That case was appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. \n[5] The designation of class was granted by the district court under the provisions of Rule 23(b)(2), which reads: \n\"An action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are satisfied, and in addition: ... \n(2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby \nmaking appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole ...\" \nThe defendants have not questioned the class designation on the basis of size or definition and therefore, we do not \nconsider those elements. Cf. Lewis v. Kugler, 446 F.2d 1343 (3d Cir. 1971). \nWe also note that the defendants in the case of Alexander v. Rizzo, Civil Action No. 70-992 (E.D.Pa.1972), entered \ninto a consent decree in which they stipulated that the final order was \"for the benefit of every member of the class of \nplaintiffs referred to in the Complaint ...\" The Alexander complaint reveals that the action was brought on behalf of all \nblack residents of the City of Philadelphia. (Complaint, para. 5) \n\n[6] It is not inappropriate to note that the same district judge decided the case of Hughes v. Rizzo, 282 F.Supp. 881 \n(E.D.Pa. 1968), where an injunction against alleged police misconduct was denied. That same judge is presently \nretaining jurisdiction of the case of Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Joseph F. O'Neill et al., 345 F.Supp. 305 \n(E.D.Pa.1972), involving the hiring practices of the Philadelphia police. \n[7] See note 5, supra. \n[8] In the Goode case, the court remarked that the efforts of plaintiffs' counsel were more nearly successful and their \nefforts were more directly devoted to attempting to obtain a rational solution but in the COPPAR litigation the plaintiffs \nwere \"somewhat less sensitive to the true public interest\" and were less inclined toward an amicable settlement along \nthe lines ultimately set out by the court. \n[9] The Supreme Court expressly declined to rule on this theory in Hall v. Cole, supra, although it discussed it \nin Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, supra, where the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000a-3(b) permitted \nan award of counsel fees in the court's discretion. See also Bradley v. Richmond School Board, 416 U.S. 696, 94 \nS.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (May 15, 1974), where the Court noted the high priority particularly accorded \ndesegregation matters. In North-cross v. Memphis Board of Education, 412 U.S. 427, 93 S.Ct. 2201, 37 L.Ed.2d 48 \n(1973), the Court expressly declined to consider whether and under what circumstances an award of attorneys' fees \nmight be permissible in ยง 1983 litigation. \n[10] Many of the cases fail to distinguish between awards made under ยงยง 1981, 1982 and 1983 even though these \nsections are derived from separate statutes and the rationale applicable to ยง 1982. for example, may not apply to ยง \n1983. See, e. g., Lee v. Southern Home Sites Corp., supra, where the court cites the absence of criminal sanctions to \nenforce ยง 1982 as one reason to encourage private attorney general actions. \n[11] See note 2, supra. \n[12] The former district attorney of Philadelphia would be liable under this order for a share of the counsel fees \nawarded the plaintiffs even though no member of the district attorney's staff was in any way involved in the incidents \nwhich convinced the court that injunctive relief was required. In Bauers v. Heisel, 361 F.2d 581 (3d Cir. 1966), this \ncourt held that the district attorney is not liable for damages under ยง 1983 because of judicial immunity. \n[13] In discussing fees, the district court did say that \"punitive measures are not called for\" and that \"no conscious \npolicy of permitting or encouraging widespread violations of constitutional rights by police officers\" existed. \n[14] The court's opinion noted that a cause of action under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 had been asserted and that therefore it \nwas not significant that the college was not a \"person\" under ยง 1983. Since the parties to the litigation sub \njudice argued only ยง 1983 jurisdiction, we consider only that theory. Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693, 696 n. \n4, 93 S.Ct. 1785, 36 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973). Convincing proof of the parties' intent is the COPPAR motion to add the City \nof Philadelphia as a defendant on the expectation that the Moor v. County of Alameda case, supra, which was then \npending in the Supreme Court, would result in a county being declared a \"person.\" The motion was not acted upon, \nand the city is a named defendant in neither case. Goode asserted only ยง 1983 and ยง 1988 claims. We leave open for \ndistrict court consideration the question of ยง 1331 jurisdiction which COPPAR alleged. As to whether Goode could \namend to allege such a jurisdictional ground, see 28 U.S.C. ยง 1653. Similarly, whether the City of Philadelphia could \nor should be joined under ยง 1331 is not before us, and in view of such problems as the statute of limitations, laches \nand respondeat superior, we do not pass upon it. \n[15] There are numerous cases in which counsel fees have been assessed against school boards without any \ndiscussion of whether those entities are \"persons\" under ยง 1983. The definition of \"person\" under this specific statute \nis far from clear, and there are inconsistencies in the case law. Contrast, for example, U. S. ex rel. Gittlemacker v. \nCounty of Philadelphia, 413 F.2d 84 (3d Cir. 1969), with Scher v. Board of Education of Town of West Orange, 424 \nF.2d 741 (3d Cir. 1970). For a resume of the cases in this circuit demonstrating the problem, see Thornberry, Suing \nPublic Entities Under the Federal Civil Rights Act: Monroe v. Pape Reconsidered, 43 U.Colo.L.Rev. 105 (1971). The \nSupreme Court has met the issue only in cases involving cities and counties. Kenosha v. Bruno, supra, Moor v. \nCounty of Alameda, supra, and Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961). Curiously, \ndespite the many cases before the Supreme Court in recent years in which school boards were among the named \ndefendants, the issue of whether the board is a \"person\" has never been decided by the Court. For the view that the \n\"person\" exclusion should be narrowly construed in order to carry out the purpose of the Civil Rights Act, see Kates \nand Kouba, Liability of Public Entities Under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act, 45 S.Cal.L.Rev. 131 (1972). \n\n ",

Depending on the demand, Defendants will ensure \nthat someone is present who can speak to any policy making issues as \nwell as someone with complete settlement authority. The Mayor is \nexcused from participating in the initial mediation but he or someone \nfrom his office may be required to participate at a later session. \nCounsel request additional time for class and fact discovery due to the \ncomplexity and to allow time for settlement discussions. The Court \nwill allow this, given that both class and fact discovery will proceed \nin tandem. An Initial Scheduling Order will be entered. Following the \nconference, the Court realized that there is a John Doe Defendant and \ntherefore, it cannot ask if the parties will consent to magistrate \njurisdiction.

The  following  numbered \nparagraphs correspond to the numbered allegations in Plaintiffsโ Complaint. ECF No. 1-2. \n \n  I)   INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Following the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis, \nMN  police officers on May 25, 2020, a wave of sustained, large-scale demonstrations \nagainst  racism and racialized police violence swept across the United States and spread \nthroughout many parts of the world. Protesters expressed their outrage and called for \njustice not only for George Floydโs murder, but also for Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 2 of 70\n \nand numerous other Black people, indigenous people, and people of color killed by police \nin the United States. Protesters have also called for changes to address systemic racism and \nreshape  the way matters of public safety are  addressed in this country and in their \ncommunities. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER:  \n  Answering Defendants admit that George Floyd, a black man was killed by \npolice officers in Minneapolis, MN on or about May 25, 2020. The determination of \nwhether Mr. Floydโs killing legally constitutes murder and the specific reasons of \neach  alleged  protestor  across  the  United  States  are  unknown  to  Answering \nDefendants, and thus, Answering Defendants deny the remaining allegations in this \nParagraph and demand strict proof at trial. Furthermore, Answering Defendants \ndeny any and all allegations of fact not expressly admitted in this Answer.  \n2.  On June 1, 2020, people from Pittsburgh and surrounding communities \nassembled in the East Liberty neighborhood of the City of Pittsburgh to add their voices \nto these nationwide protests and seek change locally. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police \n(โPBPโ) responded by escalating a peaceful protest into a scene of pandemonium, panic, \nviolence and bloodshed. The PBP deployed hundreds of officers to counter approximately \n150 protesters.  As the assembled protesters held their hands in the air and chanted, \nโThis is not a riot,โ and โHands up โ Donโt shoot,โ PBP ordered its officers to attack them \nwith explosives, chemical agents and ammunition which is known to seriously wound and \nsometimes kill its targets.  PBP officers drove ambulances past injured protesters without \nstopping. After ordering peaceful protesters to leave the area, PBP officers blocked their \nescape with chemical gas, riot police and mounted patrols. PBP then arrested several \nprotestors for failing to disperse, subjecting them to confinement in the midst of a global \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The PBP ordered tactical officers dressed in paramilitary garb to \npatrol a residential neighborhood in armored vehicles and arbitrarily throw canisters of \nchemical gas at and/or arrest anyone they encountered. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER:  \nAnswering Defendants admit only to the extent that there were demonstrations on \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 3 of 70\n \nJune 1, 2020, in the City of Pittsburgh, that Pittsburgh Bureau of Police (PBP) officers \nwere present at the demonstrations. Answering Defendants admit that PBP officers \ngave repeated, legal orders to those that were unlawfully assembled to disperse. \nAnswering Defendants further admit that some protestors chanted expressions like, \nโThis is not a riot,โ and โHands up โ Donโt shoot,โ however, it is denied that those \nstatements reflected the actions of those shouting.  \n \nAnswering Defendants further deny that PBP officers โexcalat[ed] a peaceful protest \ninto a scene of pandemonium, panic, violence and bloodshed.โ Answering Defendants \ndeny that โPBP ordered its officers to attack them  with explosives, chemical agents \nand ammunition.โ Answering Defendants further deny that any PBP officers drove \nambulances or that โPBP officers drove ambulances past injured protesters without \nstopping.โ Answering Defendants also deny that PBP officers intentionally โblocked \n[assemblees]  escape with chemical gas, riot police and mounted patrolsโ when and \nif those assembeled were leaving pursuant to the orders to disperse. Answering \nDefendants deny that โPBP ordered tactical officers dressed in paramilitary garb to \npatrol  a  residential  neighborhood  in  armored  vehicles  and  arbitrarily  throw \ncanisters of  chemical gas at and/or arrest anyone they encountered.โ For all of the \ndenied  allegations  in  this  paragraph  Answering  Defendants  demand  strict  proof \nthereof at trial.  \n \nThe remaining allegations in this paragraph are unknown to Answering Defendants, \nand thus, Answering Defendants deny the remaining allegations in this Paragraph \nand demand strict proof at trial. Furthermore, Answering Defendants deny any and \nall allegations of fact not expressly admitted in this Answer.  \n3.  Plaintiffs assembled in East Liberty to protest the routine covering up of \npolice misconduct and abuse. In response, City of Pittsburgh officials, including the \nMayor, Public Safety Director and Chief of Police, disseminated flagrant lies to conceal \nand/or  justify  the  PBPโs  shameless  use  of  force  against  peaceful  protesters.  These \nofficials accused protesters of hurling rocks and โvolleys of bricksโ at PBP officers, and \nvehemently  denied  using  chemical  agents. Numerous  videos  demonstrate  that  these \nstatements were patently false. \n  DEFENDANTSโ ANSWER:  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 4 of 70\n \n  Answering Defendants do not have information or knowledge regarding the \nreasons why individual Plaintiffs allegedly assembled in East Liberty, and thus, the \nallegations based on Plaintiffs individual intentions are denied and strict proof thereof \nis demanded at trial. Answering Defendants expressly denied that any Defendant \nโdisseminated flagrant liesโ or made statements that were โpatently falseโ. Answering \nDefendants further deny that the PBP used โshamelessโ force against alleged โpeaceful \nprotestors.โ Answering Defendants demand strict proof thereof at trial.  \n \n4.

Numerous  protesters  were \nseriously injured. The PBP arrested 46 people at the protests for โfailure to disperse.โ The \nAllegheny County District Attorney refused to pursue charges against at least 39 of these \narrestees because the PBPโs evidence was insufficient to support the charges. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER:  \nAnswering Defendants are without information or knowledge to respond to the \ntruthfulness of Plaintiffsโ allegations relating to the reasons why each individual \ngathered to protest, the exact amount of individuals who appeared to protest or the \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 12 of 70\n \nlocations of demonstrations outside the City of Pittsburgh, and thus, the same are \ndenied.

However, when an organize protest or demonstration ends with property \ndamage and the threat of injury the situation becomes an unlawful assembly.  \nAnswering Defendants are without knowledge or information to form belief as to the \ntruth  of  Plaintiffsโ  allegations  that  any  alleged  demonstrator  or  protestor  was \nโencouragedโ by the PBPโs cooperation with protestor organizers, and thus, the \nsame are denied and strict proof thereof is demanded at trial.  \n38.

To the extent that the Court deems a response necessary, these averments are \ndenied and strict proof thereof is requested at trial.  \nAnswering Defendants are without knowledge or information to form belief as to the truth of \nPlaintiffsโ allegations that any alleged demonstrator believed the PBP was โcommunicatingโ \nwith individual attendees, and thus, the same are denied and strict proof thereof is demanded \nat trial.  \n39.  At approximately 6:30 pm, the protesters congregated at the Target store \nlocated at the Corner of Penn Avenue and Centre Avenue. Many either remained at that \nlocation or left the area. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nAnswering Defendants admit the  many individuals  left the location because the \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 17 of 70\n \norganizers had ended  the  demonstration or  protest. Answering Defendants lack \ninformation or believe as to who Plaintiffs specifically refer to as โProtestorsโ at this \npoint as the organized protest had officially ended, and thus, the same is denied and \nstrict proof thereof is demanded at trial.  \n40.  Between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm, a much smaller group of 100 to 150 \nprotesters continued to march down Centre Avenue toward Negley Avenue (hereinafter \nโProtestersโ). \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nAnswering Defendants lack information or believe as to who Plaintiffs specifically \nrefer to as โProtestorsโ at this point as the organized protest had officially ended, and \nthus, the same is denied and strict proof thereof is demanded at trial.  \n41.

However, it is unclear what โother tactical gearโ Plaintiffs refer \nto,  and  thus,  Answering  Defendants  do  not  have  information  or  knowledge  to \ndetermine the truthfulness of the allegations in this paragraph. The same are denied \nand strict proof thereof is demanded at trial.  \n46.  At about the same time as the above described PBP officers blocked the \nProtestersโ path on Centre Avenue, other PBP officers and/or law enforcement officers \nacting under the direction of PBP, formed similar lines across other East Liberty streets. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated. Plaintiffsโ claims intentionally skew timeline of factual events. After \nnumerous warnings regarding potential arrests due to an unlawful assembly. PBP \nand other officers made arrest of individuals who failed to comply with repeated and \nprolonged orders near other parts of Center Avenue.  \n47.  The Protesters stopped on Centre Avenue approximately 30 feet from the \nline of police officers. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nAnswering Defendants lack information and knowledge to determine the truthfulness \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 19 of 70\n \nof who the individuals being called โprotestersโ were, what the intentions of those \nindividuals, and whether any of the named Plaintiffs were in this alleged group of \npeople. Answering Defendants also lack information and knowledge as to the exact \nlocations and distances Plaintiffs claims refer to, and thus, the same are denied and \nstrict proof thereof is demanded at trial.  \n48.  The Protesters were peaceful. \n \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied.  \n \n49.  The Protestersโ behavior was not materially different from the behavior \nof  the larger group of protesters earlier in the day, which the PBP openly approved \nand supported. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied.  \n50.  Groups of Protesters chanted, โHands up - Donโt Shoot,โ โThis is not a riot,โ \nโJoin us,โ and similar phrases. Some Protesters knelt on the ground with their hands in \nthe air. Link to Video 1; Link to Video 2  \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nAnswering Defendants lack information and knowledge to determine the truthfulness \nof  who  the  individuals  being  called  โprotestersโ  were,  the  intentions  of  those \nindividuals, and whether any of the named Plaintiffs were in this alleged group of \npeople. Answering Defendants deny that the alleged protestorsโ actions reflected the \nalleged  protestorsโ  actions.  Answering  Defendants  also  lack  information  and \nknowledge as to the truthfulness of whether the videos submitted to support these \nclaims accurately reflect the claims, and thus, Answering Defendants deny and strict \nproof thereof is demanded at trial.  \n51.  The Protesters did not damage public or private property. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied.  \n \n52.  The Protesters did not throw bricks or rocks at the PBP officers. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied.  \n \n53.

The Protesters did not present an imminent threat to public safety, peace or \norder; \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied.  \n55.  Nevertheless,  on  information  and  belief,  Defendant  Doe  and/or  other \nindividually named Defendants made the decision to declare the Protestersโ assembly \nunlawful and order the Protesters to disperse. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated2. When PBP ordered the individuals to disperse the gathering was an \nunlawful assembly.  \n56.  Defendantsโ Peduto, Hissrich and Schubert were either present during the \nabove-described events or were otherwise aware of them as they occurred.  These three \ndefendants either made the decision to declare the assembly unlawful, or approved of \nthat decision and the basis for that decision. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated. Answering Defendants deny that declaring an unlawful assembly \nwas unreasonable or violated any alleged constitutional right.  \n57.  At approximately 7:17 pm, a PBP officer (possibly Defendant Doe) made \nthe following announcement (hereinafter โunlawful assembly announcementโ): \nI am Officer [unintelligible] of the Pittsburgh Police.  I \nhereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly. I order \nall those assembled at this location to immediately disperse. \nYou must  leave this immediate vicinity.  If you remain in \nthis vicinity you  are  in  violation  of  the  Pennsylvania \ncrimes code. No matter  what your purpose is you must \nleave. If you do not disperse you will be arrested and/or \nsubject  to  other  police  action.  Other police action may \ninclude actual physical removal, the  use of riot control \nagents and/or less lethal munitions which could cause the \nrisk of injury for those who remain. You must immediately \nleave  outbound on Centre Avenue. [Unintelligible] \n \n                                                           \n2 Defendant John Doe is not included as an Answering Defendant in this filing and is not a \nparty currently identified or represented.  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 21 of 70\n \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated. There were multiple, audible announcements regarding the lawful command \nto disperse. The text, except for the portion regarding an officerโs name being โunintelligible,โ \nis an accurate depiction of the repeated announcements given to the individuals illegally \nassembled in the evening on June 1, 2020, after the organized protest was concluded.  \n  \n58.  At that time, Centre Avenue outbound was blocked by numerous police \nvehicles and/or riot control officers; \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated. By way of further answer arrests were made near other locations of \nCenter Avenue after individuals refused to disperse despite hearing, as Plaintiffs \nadmit they heard, multiple lawful commands to disperse.  \n59.  Shortly after the first โunlawful assembly announcementโ was made, PBP \ndeployed a Long Range Acoustic Device (โLRADโ) against the Protesters. A LRAD is \nmilitary-grade weapon that emits a โdeterrent  toneโ so loud it can cause permanent \nhearing loss. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated. It is admitted that the PBP used a hand-held amplification device, \nnot a weapon, to assure that those gathered could hear the orders to disperse. The \nequipment was used in a reasonable manner. It is denied any deterrent tone was \nemitted.  \n60.  Police warned the Protesters not to โadvanceโ on their line. However, nearly \nall of the Protesters were at least 30 feet away from the officers. At no time did any \nProtester โadvanceโ on the officers. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated. Multiple individuals refused to follow numerous lawful orders, \nincluding lawful orders to stop advancing into intersections and towards police.  \n61.  The PBP officer made more โunlawful assembly announcementsโ over the \nnext several minutes and continued to deploy the LRAD. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nAdmitted.  \n62.  An unknown PBP  officer discharged  a firearm  into the  crowd hitting \na Protester in the knee.  Other Protesters dragged the injured Protester to the sidewalk and \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 22 of 70\n \noffered him assistance.  Link to Video. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated. Officers deployed less lethal munitions in necessary response to \nactions of rioting protestors.  It is further denied that the above video cited accurately \ndepicts the allegations in this paragraph, and thus, the same is denied and strict proof \nthereof is demanded at trial.  \n63.  Despite  this  aggressive  action  by  the  PBP,  the  Protesters  remained \npeaceful. They continued chanting but did not disperse. The Protesters did not throw \nrocks, bricks or bottles. The Protesters did not destroy property or commit acts of violence \nor vandalism. The Protesters did not advance on the police. Link to Video 1. Link to Video \n2. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied. \n64.

To the extent that the Court deems and answer is \nrequired the same is denied and strict proof thereof is demanded at trial.  \n65.  The  PBP  and  Defendants  made  no  attempt  to  communicate  to  the \nProtesters why the assembly was declared unlawful. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated. PBP officers gave numerous warnings regarding the assembly being \ndeclared an unlawful assembly. The circumstances of why the assembly was unlawful \nwere open and obvious. \n66.  The  PBP  and  Defendants  made  no  attempt  to  communicate  to  the \nProtesters why they were being ordered to disperse. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated. PBP officers gave numerous warnings regarding the assembly being \ndeclared an unlawful assembly. The circumstances of why the assembly was unlawful \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 23 of 70\n \nwere open and obvious. \n67.  In the middle of an unlawful assembly announcement, a PBP police officer \nsuddenly threw a โflashbangโ grenade at the crowd. Link to Video 1; Link to Video 2; Link \nto Video 3. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nAnswering Defendants are without knowledge or information to form belief as to the \ntruthfulness of Plaintiffs allegations as to whether the item described in this paragraph \nand showed in the corresponding video was a โflashbang grenadeโ or whether the \nvideos support the full context of the circumstances officers were facing at the time the \nalleged device was used. Thus, the allegations of this paragraph are denied and strict \nproof thereof is demanded at trial.  \n68.  A โflashbangโ grenade is an explosive device designed to frighten and \ndisorient an enemy through a blinding flash of light and extremely loud explosive noise. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nAnswering Defendants are without knowledge or information to form belief as to the \ntruthfulness of Plaintiffs allegations, and thus, the same are denied and strict proof \nthereof is demanded at trial.  \n69.  Immediately following the detonation of the flashbang grenade, PBP officers \nbegan  firing  โrubber  bullets,โ  โbeanbags  roundsโ  and/or  โsponge  grenadesโ  at  the \nProtesters.  Link to Video. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nAnswering Defendants are without knowledge or information to form belief as to the \ntruthfulness of Plaintiffs allegations, and thus, the same are denied and strict proof \nthereof is demanded at trial. It is unclear when the video cited to support the above \nparagraph was taken, thus it is denied that the video supports the allegations of this \nparagraph and strict proof thereof is demanded at trial. \n70.  โRubber bulletsโ are large rubber coated metal cylinders which can be fired \nfrom standard firearms or dedicated โriot guns.โ โBeanbag roundsโ are cloth bags filled \nwith lead shot which are fired from a 12-gauge shotgun. โSponge grenadesโ are large \nplastic or metal bullets with dense foam rubber tips. They are typically fired from a 40mm \ngrenade launcher. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 24 of 70\n \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nAnswering Defendants are without knowledge or information to form belief as to the \ntruthfulness of Plaintiffs allegations, and thus, the same are denied and strict proof \nthereof is demanded at trial. By way of further answer, PBP officers do not use \nโRubber Bullets.โ Bean bag projectiles and sponges are utilized by the PBP and, if \nany were used, they were deployed in a reasonable and appropriate manner on June \n1, 2020.  \n71.  Although these items are often referred to as โless lethalโ munitions, they \nare fired with the force of a gun or grenade launcher and have the capability to cause \nserious  injury  and/or  death,  particularly  when  fired  at  close  range  or  when  fired  at \nvulnerable areas of the body. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nAdmitted to the extent that injuries can occur and accordingly officers are well \ntrained in the use of the above described munitions.  \n72.  PBP officers also threw and/or shot canisters into the crowd, some of which \nemitted smoke (โsmoke bombsโ) and some of which emitted chemical gas commonly \nreferred to as โtear gasโ (โchemical grenades.โ) \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nAdmitted to the extent that Answering Defendants are aware of smoke canisters \nbeing deployed. Answering Defendants are without information or knowledge as to \nhow many, if any, chemical gas canisters were deployed   \n73.  โTear gasโ generally refers to chemical agents that cause tearing, coughing, \ndifficulty breathing, skin irritation and/or vomiting.

PBP policy recognizes that, โThe use of kinetic energy impact projectiles \nare considered deadly force, if intentionally deployed to areas of the subjects [sic] body \nthat are recognized as likely to cause serious bodily injury or death (head, neck, throat, \nchest or solar plexus).โ PBP policy prohibits officers from targeting these  areas of  a \npersonโs body unless deadly force is justified. Nevertheless, PBP officers fired hundreds of \nrubber bullets, beanbags and/or sponge grenades indiscriminately into clouds of smoke, \nthrough which they could not see the Protestersโ bodies. As a result, Protesters  were hit \nwith projectiles in areas of their bodies likely to cause serious bodily injury and  were, in \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 57 of 70\n \nfact, seriously injured. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nThe allegations in this paragraph are admitted to the extent that there is a quote from \na PBP policy.

PBP did \nnot pre-arrange for medical care or transportation for injured Protesters, even though  it \nintended to use levels of force which were likely to cause serious injury or death to \nProtesters. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated. By way of further answer, the City of Pittsburgh has appropriate \nand constitutional policies on kinetic energy impact projectiles and has policies \nregarding  aid  when  such  items  are  used.  The  remaining  allegations  in  this \nparagraph are denied and strict proof thereof is demanded at trial.  \n209.

The  following  numbered \nparagraphs correspond to the numbered allegations in Plaintiffsโ Complaint. ECF No. 1-2. \n \n  I)   INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Following the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis, \nMN  police officers on May 25, 2020, a wave of sustained, large-scale demonstrations \nagainst  racism and racialized police violence swept across the United States and spread \nthroughout many parts of the world. Protesters expressed their outrage and called for \njustice not only for George Floydโs murder, but also for Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 2 of 70\n \nand numerous other Black people, indigenous people, and people of color killed by police \nin the United States. Protesters have also called for changes to address systemic racism and \nreshape  the way matters of public safety are  addressed in this country and in their \ncommunities. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER:  \n  Answering Defendants admit that George Floyd, a black man was killed by \npolice officers in Minneapolis, MN on or about May 25, 2020. The determination of \nwhether Mr. Floydโs killing legally constitutes murder and the specific reasons of \neach  alleged  protestor  across  the  United  States  are  unknown  to  Answering \nDefendants, and thus, Answering Defendants deny the remaining allegations in this \nParagraph and demand strict proof at trial. Furthermore, Answering Defendants \ndeny any and all allegations of fact not expressly admitted in this Answer.  \n2.  On June 1, 2020, people from Pittsburgh and surrounding communities \nassembled in the East Liberty neighborhood of the City of Pittsburgh to add their voices \nto these nationwide protests and seek change locally. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police \n(โPBPโ) responded by escalating a peaceful protest into a scene of pandemonium, panic, \nviolence and bloodshed. The PBP deployed hundreds of officers to counter approximately \n150 protesters.  As the assembled protesters held their hands in the air and chanted, \nโThis is not a riot,โ and โHands up โ Donโt shoot,โ PBP ordered its officers to attack them \nwith explosives, chemical agents and ammunition which is known to seriously wound and \nsometimes kill its targets.  PBP officers drove ambulances past injured protesters without \nstopping. After ordering peaceful protesters to leave the area, PBP officers blocked their \nescape with chemical gas, riot police and mounted patrols. PBP then arrested several \nprotestors for failing to disperse, subjecting them to confinement in the midst of a global \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The PBP ordered tactical officers dressed in paramilitary garb to \npatrol a residential neighborhood in armored vehicles and arbitrarily throw canisters of \nchemical gas at and/or arrest anyone they encountered. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER:  \nAnswering Defendants admit only to the extent that there were demonstrations on \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 3 of 70\n \nJune 1, 2020, in the City of Pittsburgh, that Pittsburgh Bureau of Police (PBP) officers \nwere present at the demonstrations. Answering Defendants admit that PBP officers \ngave repeated, legal orders to those that were unlawfully assembled to disperse. \nAnswering Defendants further admit that some protestors chanted expressions like, \nโThis is not a riot,โ and โHands up โ Donโt shoot,โ however, it is denied that those \nstatements reflected the actions of those shouting.  \n \nAnswering Defendants further deny that PBP officers โexcalat[ed] a peaceful protest \ninto a scene of pandemonium, panic, violence and bloodshed.โ Answering Defendants \ndeny that โPBP ordered its officers to attack them  with explosives, chemical agents \nand ammunition.โ Answering Defendants further deny that any PBP officers drove \nambulances or that โPBP officers drove ambulances past injured protesters without \nstopping.โ Answering Defendants also deny that PBP officers intentionally โblocked \n[assemblees]  escape with chemical gas, riot police and mounted patrolsโ when and \nif those assembeled were leaving pursuant to the orders to disperse. Answering \nDefendants deny that โPBP ordered tactical officers dressed in paramilitary garb to \npatrol  a  residential  neighborhood  in  armored  vehicles  and  arbitrarily  throw \ncanisters of  chemical gas at and/or arrest anyone they encountered.โ For all of the \ndenied  allegations  in  this  paragraph  Answering  Defendants  demand  strict  proof \nthereof at trial.  \n \nThe remaining allegations in this paragraph are unknown to Answering Defendants, \nand thus, Answering Defendants deny the remaining allegations in this Paragraph \nand demand strict proof at trial. Furthermore, Answering Defendants deny any and \nall allegations of fact not expressly admitted in this Answer.  \n3.  Plaintiffs assembled in East Liberty to protest the routine covering up of \npolice misconduct and abuse. In response, City of Pittsburgh officials, including the \nMayor, Public Safety Director and Chief of Police, disseminated flagrant lies to conceal \nand/or  justify  the  PBPโs  shameless  use  of  force  against  peaceful  protesters.  These \nofficials accused protesters of hurling rocks and โvolleys of bricksโ at PBP officers, and \nvehemently  denied  using  chemical  agents. Numerous  videos  demonstrate  that  these \nstatements were patently false. \n  DEFENDANTSโ ANSWER:  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 4 of 70\n \n  Answering Defendants do not have information or knowledge regarding the \nreasons why individual Plaintiffs allegedly assembled in East Liberty, and thus, the \nallegations based on Plaintiffs individual intentions are denied and strict proof thereof \nis demanded at trial. Answering Defendants expressly denied that any Defendant \nโdisseminated flagrant liesโ or made statements that were โpatently falseโ. Answering \nDefendants further deny that the PBP used โshamelessโ force against alleged โpeaceful \nprotestors.โ Answering Defendants demand strict proof thereof at trial.  \n \n4.

Numerous  protesters  were \nseriously injured. The PBP arrested 46 people at the protests for โfailure to disperse.โ The \nAllegheny County District Attorney refused to pursue charges against at least 39 of these \narrestees because the PBPโs evidence was insufficient to support the charges. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER:  \nAnswering Defendants are without information or knowledge to respond to the \ntruthfulness of Plaintiffsโ allegations relating to the reasons why each individual \ngathered to protest, the exact amount of individuals who appeared to protest or the \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 12 of 70\n \nlocations of demonstrations outside the City of Pittsburgh, and thus, the same are \ndenied.

However, when an organize protest or demonstration ends with property \ndamage and the threat of injury the situation becomes an unlawful assembly.  \n37.  Uniformed Pittsburgh Bureau of Police (PBP) officers approved and/or \nencouraged the protestersโ activities by, inter alia, marching with them, communicating \nwith organizers, blocking off streets and redirecting traffic. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER:  \nAnswering  Defendants,  Hissrich,  Schubert,  Vinansky,  and  Lando  admit  the \nallegations in this paragraph to the extent that individuals who want to organize a \ndemonstration  are  required  to  get  permits  and  in  many  situations,  even  when \ndemonstrators or protestors do not have proper permits, Answering Defendants take \nprecautions to ensure the safety of those involved in organized demonstrations and \nprotests. However, when an organize protest or demonstration ends with property \ndamage and the threat of injury the situation becomes an unlawful assembly.  \nAnswering Defendants are without knowledge or information to form belief as to the \ntruth  of  Plaintiffsโ  allegations  that  any  alleged  demonstrator  or  protestor  was \nโencouragedโ by the PBPโs cooperation with protestor organizers, and thus, the \nsame are denied and strict proof thereof is demanded at trial.  \n38.  By  attending,  approving,  encouraging,  and  assisting  the  protesters \nactivities,  Defendants  communicated  to  them  that  they  were  exercising  their  First \nAmendment rights in a time, place and manner that Defendants considered reasonable. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nThe averments set forth in this paragraph constitute conclusions of law to which no response \nis required. To the extent that the Court deems a response necessary, these averments are \ndenied and strict proof thereof is requested at trial.  \nAnswering Defendants are without knowledge or information to form belief as to the truth of \nPlaintiffsโ allegations that any alleged demonstrator believed the PBP was โcommunicatingโ \nwith individual attendees, and thus, the same are denied and strict proof thereof is demanded \nat trial.  \n39.  At approximately 6:30 pm, the protesters congregated at the Target store \nlocated at the Corner of Penn Avenue and Centre Avenue. Many either remained at that \nlocation or left the area. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nAnswering Defendants admit the  many individuals  left the location because the \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 17 of 70\n \norganizers had ended  the  demonstration or  protest. Answering Defendants lack \ninformation or believe as to who Plaintiffs specifically refer to as โProtestorsโ at this \npoint as the organized protest had officially ended, and thus, the same is denied and \nstrict proof thereof is demanded at trial.  \n40.  Between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm, a much smaller group of 100 to 150 \nprotesters continued to march down Centre Avenue toward Negley Avenue (hereinafter \nโProtestersโ). \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nAnswering Defendants lack information or believe as to who Plaintiffs specifically \nrefer to as โProtestorsโ at this point as the organized protest had officially ended, and \nthus, the same is denied and strict proof thereof is demanded at trial.  \n41.

As the Protesters marched, approximately 50 to 100 PBP officers formed a \nline across Centre Avenue at Negley Avenue, blocking the Protestersโ path. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nAnswering Defendants lack information and knowledge to determine the truthfulness \nof who the individuals being called โprotestersโ were, what the intentions of those \nindividuals, and whether any of the named Plaintiffs were in this alleged group of \npeople. Thus, the same are denied and strict proof thereof is demanded at trial.  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 18 of 70\n \nAnswering Defendants admit  that  PBP officers blocked  off a main intersection/ \nthoroughfare in the area of the intersection of Center and Negley Avenues. Any other \nfactual allegations in this paragraph are denied and strict proof thereof is demanded \nat trial.  \n44.  The officers wore helmets, face shields and gas masks. Every officer held \neither a baton or a firearm. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nAdmitted.

On information and belief, these officers were members of the PBP Special \nWeapons and Tactics (โSWATโ) Team. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated. By way of further answer, PBP officers from special units, like K9 \nofficers were present. However, it is unclear what โother tactical gearโ Plaintiffs refer \nto,  and  thus,  Answering  Defendants  do  not  have  information  or  knowledge  to \ndetermine the truthfulness of the allegations in this paragraph. The same are denied \nand strict proof thereof is demanded at trial.  \n46.  At about the same time as the above described PBP officers blocked the \nProtestersโ path on Centre Avenue, other PBP officers and/or law enforcement officers \nacting under the direction of PBP, formed similar lines across other East Liberty streets. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated. Plaintiffsโ claims intentionally skew timeline of factual events. After \nnumerous warnings regarding potential arrests due to an unlawful assembly. PBP \nand other officers made arrest of individuals who failed to comply with repeated and \nprolonged orders near other parts of Center Avenue.  \n47.  The Protesters stopped on Centre Avenue approximately 30 feet from the \nline of police officers. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nAnswering Defendants lack information and knowledge to determine the truthfulness \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 19 of 70\n \nof who the individuals being called โprotestersโ were, what the intentions of those \nindividuals, and whether any of the named Plaintiffs were in this alleged group of \npeople. Answering Defendants also lack information and knowledge as to the exact \nlocations and distances Plaintiffs claims refer to, and thus, the same are denied and \nstrict proof thereof is demanded at trial.  \n48.  The Protesters were peaceful. \n \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied.  \n \n49.  The Protestersโ behavior was not materially different from the behavior \nof  the larger group of protesters earlier in the day, which the PBP openly approved \nand supported. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied.  \n50.  Groups of Protesters chanted, โHands up - Donโt Shoot,โ โThis is not a riot,โ \nโJoin us,โ and similar phrases. Some Protesters knelt on the ground with their hands in \nthe air. Link to Video 1; Link to Video 2  \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nAnswering Defendants lack information and knowledge to determine the truthfulness \nof  who  the  individuals  being  called  โprotestersโ  were,  the  intentions  of  those \nindividuals, and whether any of the named Plaintiffs were in this alleged group of \npeople. Answering Defendants deny that the alleged protestorsโ actions reflected the \nalleged  protestorsโ  actions.  Answering  Defendants  also  lack  information  and \nknowledge as to the truthfulness of whether the videos submitted to support these \nclaims accurately reflect the claims, and thus, Answering Defendants deny and strict \nproof thereof is demanded at trial.  \n51.  The Protesters did not damage public or private property. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied.  \n \n52.  The Protesters did not throw bricks or rocks at the PBP officers. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied.  \n \n53.  The Protesters did not engage in any activity that could have given rise to \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 20 of 70\n \na  reasonable  belief  that  they  were  likely  to  cause  substantial  harm  or  serious \ninconvenience, annoyance or alarm. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied.  \n54.  The Protesters did not present an imminent threat to public safety, peace or \norder; \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied.  \n55.  Nevertheless,  on  information  and  belief,  Defendant  Doe  and/or  other \nindividually named Defendants made the decision to declare the Protestersโ assembly \nunlawful and order the Protesters to disperse. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated2. When PBP ordered the individuals to disperse the gathering was an \nunlawful assembly.  \n56.  Defendantsโ Peduto, Hissrich and Schubert were either present during the \nabove-described events or were otherwise aware of them as they occurred.  These three \ndefendants either made the decision to declare the assembly unlawful, or approved of \nthat decision and the basis for that decision. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated. Answering Defendants deny that declaring an unlawful assembly \nwas unreasonable or violated any alleged constitutional right.  \n57.  At approximately 7:17 pm, a PBP officer (possibly Defendant Doe) made \nthe following announcement (hereinafter โunlawful assembly announcementโ): \nI am Officer [unintelligible] of the Pittsburgh Police.  I \nhereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly. I order \nall those assembled at this location to immediately disperse. \nYou must  leave this immediate vicinity.  If you remain in \nthis vicinity you  are  in  violation  of  the  Pennsylvania \ncrimes code. No matter  what your purpose is you must \nleave. If you do not disperse you will be arrested and/or \nsubject  to  other  police  action.  Other police action may \ninclude actual physical removal, the  use of riot control \nagents and/or less lethal munitions which could cause the \nrisk of injury for those who remain. You must immediately \nleave  outbound on Centre Avenue. [Unintelligible] \n \n                                                           \n2 Defendant John Doe is not included as an Answering Defendant in this filing and is not a \nparty currently identified or represented.  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 21 of 70\n \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated. There were multiple, audible announcements regarding the lawful command \nto disperse. The text, except for the portion regarding an officerโs name being โunintelligible,โ \nis an accurate depiction of the repeated announcements given to the individuals illegally \nassembled in the evening on June 1, 2020, after the organized protest was concluded.  \n  \n58.  At that time, Centre Avenue outbound was blocked by numerous police \nvehicles and/or riot control officers; \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated. By way of further answer arrests were made near other locations of \nCenter Avenue after individuals refused to disperse despite hearing, as Plaintiffs \nadmit they heard, multiple lawful commands to disperse.  \n59.  Shortly after the first โunlawful assembly announcementโ was made, PBP \ndeployed a Long Range Acoustic Device (โLRADโ) against the Protesters. A LRAD is \nmilitary-grade weapon that emits a โdeterrent  toneโ so loud it can cause permanent \nhearing loss. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated. It is admitted that the PBP used a hand-held amplification device, \nnot a weapon, to assure that those gathered could hear the orders to disperse. The \nequipment was used in a reasonable manner. It is denied any deterrent tone was \nemitted.  \n60.  Police warned the Protesters not to โadvanceโ on their line. However, nearly \nall of the Protesters were at least 30 feet away from the officers. At no time did any \nProtester โadvanceโ on the officers. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated. Multiple individuals refused to follow numerous lawful orders, \nincluding lawful orders to stop advancing into intersections and towards police.  \n61.  The PBP officer made more โunlawful assembly announcementsโ over the \nnext several minutes and continued to deploy the LRAD. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nAdmitted.  \n62.  An unknown PBP  officer discharged  a firearm  into the  crowd hitting \na Protester in the knee.  Other Protesters dragged the injured Protester to the sidewalk and \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 17   Filed 09/29/20   Page 22 of 70\n \noffered him assistance.  Link to Video. \nDEFENDANTSโ ANSWER: \nDenied as stated. Officers deployed less lethal munitions in necessary response to \nactions of rioting protestors.

PBP policy recognizes that, โThe use of kinetic energy impact projectiles \nare considered deadly force, if intentionally deployed to areas of the subjects [sic] body \nthat are recognized as likely to cause serious bodily injury or death (head, neck, throat, \nchest or solar plexus).โ PBP policy prohibits officers from targeting these  areas of  a \npersonโs body unless deadly force is justified.

By way of further answer, the City of Pittsburgh has appropriate \nand constitutional policies on kinetic energy impact projectiles and has policies \nregarding  aid  when  such  items  are  used.  The  remaining  allegations  in  this \nparagraph are denied and strict proof thereof is demanded at trial.  \n209.

Following the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis, MN \npolice officers on May 25, 2020, a wave of sustained, large-scale demonstrations against \nracism  and  racialized  police  violence  swept  across  the  United  States  and  spread \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 2 of 44\nthroughout many parts of the world. Protesters expressed their outrage and called for \njustice not only for George Floydโs murder, but also for Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, \nand numerous other Black people, indigenous people, and people of color killed by police \nin the United States. Protesters have also called for changes to address systemic racism \nand reshape the way matters of public safety are addressed in this country and in their \ncommunities. \n2.  On June 1, 2020, people from Pittsburgh and surrounding communities \nassembled in the East Liberty neighborhood of the City of Pittsburgh to add their voices \nto these nationwide protests and seek change locally. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police \n(โPBPโ) responded by escalating a peaceful protest into a scene of pandemonium, panic, \nviolence and bloodshed. The PBP deployed hundreds of officers to counter approximately \n150 protesters.  As the assembled protesters held their hands in the air and chanted, \nโThis is not a riot,โ and โHands up โ Donโt shoot,โ PBP ordered its officers to attack them \nwith explosives, chemical agents and ammunition which is known to seriously wound and \nsometimes kill its targets.  PBP officers drove ambulances past injured protesters without \nstopping. After ordering peaceful protesters to leave the area, PBP officers blocked their \nescape with chemical gas, riot police and mounted patrols. PBP then arrested several \nprotestors for failing to disperse, subjecting them to confinement in the midst of a global \nCOVID-19 pandemic.  The PBP ordered tactical officers dressed in paramilitary garb to \npatrol a residential neighborhood in armored vehicles and arbitrarily throw canisters of \nchemical gas at and/or arrest anyone they encountered.  \n3.  Plaintiffs assembled in East Liberty to protest the routine covering up of \npolice misconduct and abuse. In response, City of Pittsburgh officials, including the \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 3 of 44\nMayor, Public Safety Director and Chief of Police, disseminated flagrant lies to conceal \nand/or justify the PBPโs shameless use of force against peaceful protesters. These \nofficials accused protesters of hurling rocks and โvolleys of bricksโ at PBP officers, and \nvehemently denied using chemical agents.  Numerous videos demonstrate that these \nstatements were patently false.  \n4.  Plaintiffs are peaceful protesters who were subjected to police violence \nwhile protesting police violence.   \nโข  Nicole Rulli and Charles Bryant brought Ms. Rulliโs thirteen-year-old son, \nA.F., to the protest to teach him about his First Amendment rights.  The \npolice gassed his family and taught him to fear political protests.  \n \nโข  Simon Phillips is a dance instructor who attended the protest for โthe chance \nto congregate with othersโ  and express his โfeelings of grief, frustration, \nand desperation for the Black community.โ  He was arrested near his East \nLiberty apartment after he complied with the PBPโs order to leave.   \n \nโข  Donovan  Hayden  does  public  service  work  for  a  local  non-profit.    He \nattended the protest to oppose the โdegrading, reckless and racist policingโ \nwhich he and other Black people experience on a daily basis.  PBP officers \ngassed him chased him a gunpoint as he left the protest.   \n \nโข  Jennifer โJayโ Yoder has a background in social justice and is a trained \npeacemaker. Yoder attended the protest to support the movement and aid \nother protesters.  Police gassed and pushed Yoder and arrested them1 as \nthey attempted to return to their car after the protest.  \n \nโข  Christopher Wilson Juring is a food service worker. He attended to protest \nviolence  and  racism  and  to  show  support  for  the  African  American \ncommunity.  PBP shot him in the back as he fled a cloud of tear gas and \nsmoke.  \n \n5.  Plaintiffs bring this class action on behalf of themselves and others similarly \nsituated. Plaintiffs allege that the Defendantsโ conduct violated their First Amendment \nrights to freedom of speech and assembly, their Fourth Amendment rights to be free from \n \n1 Yoder uses the pronouns โtheyโ and โthem.โ \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 4 of 44\nexcessive force and false arrest and their Fourteenth Amendment right not to be subject \nto official governmental policies which violate their constitutional rights.  \nII)  PARTIES \n6.

The PBP arrested 46 people at the protests for โfailure to disperse.โ The \nAllegheny County District Attorney refused to pursue charges against at least 39 of these \narrestees because the PBPโs evidence was insufficient to support the charges.  \n25.  As a result of the PBPโs actions on May 30, 2020, Defendants Hissrich and \nSchubert were on notice that PBP officers would use overwhelming and excessive force \nagainst peaceful protesters with little or no provocation.   \n26.  As a result of the PBPโs actions on May 30, 2020, Defendants Hissrich and \nSchubert were on notice that PBP officers would arrest and jail peaceful protesters with \nlittle or no evidence to support criminal charges.  \n27.  Defendants Hissrich and Schubert supported the PBP actions. \n28.  Defendants Hissrich and Schubert made no effort to ensure that such \nindiscriminate use of force did not occur at future protests.  \nb.  PBP used excessive force against peaceful protesters on June 1, 2020  \n29.  On  June  1,  2020  thousands  of  concerned  Pittsburgh  residents  again \ngathered to protest police racism and violence, this time in the East Liberty neighborhood \nof the City of Pittsburgh.  \n30.  Plaintiffs were among those protesters who gathered in East Liberty on \nJune 1, 2020. \n31.  Plaintiff Nicole Rulli attended the protest with her fiancรฉ Plaintiff Charles \nBryant,  Jr.  and  her  thirteen-year-old  son,  A.F.  (collectively  โRulli  familyโ).  Rulli  is \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 9 of 44\nCaucasian, Bryant is African-American, and A.F. is biracial. Bryant wrote of his decision \nto attend the protest: โAttending the protest on June 1st was the most patriotic act of my \nlife. I was exercising my 1st amendment rights.โ Rulli and Bryant brought A.F. to the \nprotest because they wanted to expose him to a peaceful political protest and teach him \nabout his constitutional rights.   \n32.  Plaintiff Simon Phillips is a dance instructor.  He is African American. Phillips \nwrote that he attended the protest for โthe chance to congregate with othersโ  and express \nhis โfeelings of grief, frustration, and desperation for the Black community.โ  \n33.  Plaintiff Donovan Hayden works for a local arts non-profit.  Hayden wrote of \nhis reasons for joining the protest: โThe recent killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, \nand George Floyd, reignited the anger that I share with many black people. The anger \nthat comes from being victims to degrading, reckless, and racist policing. I channeled and \nexpressed that anger through protesting on June 1st. I marched, sang, and listened with \nothers to mourn the lives lost and challenge the systems killing us.โ \n34.  Plaintiff Christoper Wilson Juring works in the food service industry.  He \nparticipated in the protest in order to exercise his First Amendment rights. Juring wrote \nthe following regarding his reasons for protesting: โOn Monday, June 1st, 2020 I attended \nthe Black Lives Matter protest in East Liberty to give my support to the fight against police \nbrutality and systemic racism. I feel that participating in such protests is a necessary step \nin demanding change. As a white person, I wanted to use my privilege and my voice when \nso many people canโt even walk down the street without fearing for their lives.โ \n35.  Plaintiff Jennifer โJayโ Yoder works for a non-profit that supports survivors \nof  sexual  violence.  Yoder  is  a  trained  international  human  rights  observer  and \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 10 of 44\npeacemaker and has observed and participated in protests involving international conflict. \nJay was at the protest to support racial justice and oppose police brutality, as well to \nobserve police conduct and assist protestors. \n36.  The protesters marched peacefully in the streets in the vicinity of Penn \nAvenue and Centre Avenue from approximately 3:30 pm until approximately 6:30 pm.   \n37.  Historically, Defendants Hissrich, Schubert, and City of Pittsburgh have \npermitted, approved and/or encouraged similar protests in Pittsburgh streets.   \n38.  Uniformed  Pittsburgh Bureau  of  Police  (PBP)  officers approved and/or \nencouraged the protestersโ activities by, inter alia, marching with them, communicating \nwith organizers, blocking off streets and redirecting traffic.  \n39.  By  attending,  approving,  encouraging,  and  assisting  the  protesters \nactivities,  Defendants  communicated  to  them  that  they  were  exercising  their  First \nAmendment rights in a time, place and manner that Defendants considered reasonable.  \n40.  At approximately 6:30 pm, the protesters congregated at the Target store \nlocated at the Corner of Penn Avenue and Centre Avenue. Many either remained at that \nlocation or left the area.  \n41.  Between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm, a much smaller group of 100 to 150  \nprotesters continued to march down Centre Avenue toward Negley Avenue (hereinafter \nโProtestersโ).   \n42.  The Protesters marched peacefully down Centre Avenue for over half a \nmile.   \n43.  Although the City of Pittsburgh had implemented a curfew for the City of \nPittsburgh, this curfew would not go into effect until 8:30 pm, nearly two hours later.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 11 of 44\n44.  As the Protesters marched, approximately 50 to 100 PBP officers formed a \nline across Centre Avenue at Negley Avenue, blocking the Protestersโ path.  \n45.  The officers wore helmets, face shields and gas masks. Every officer held \neither a baton or a firearm.   \n46.  Additional  officers  were  dressed  in  military  gear  including  camouflage, \nhelmets and gas masks.  These officers carried firearms and other tactical gear.  Some \nhad police dogs. On information and belief, these officers were members of the PBP \nSpecial Weapons and Tactics (โSWATโ) Team.   \n47.  At about the same time as the above described PBP officers blocked the \nProtestersโ path on Centre Avenue, other PBP officers and/or law enforcement officers \nacting under the direction of PBP, formed similar lines across other East Liberty streets.  \n48.  Defendants Trapp and Mescan ordered a โskirmish lineโ to be set up at the \ncorner of Center and Negley.  \n49.  Trapp placed Defendant Mercurio in charge of the skirmish line, and gave \nhim orders regarding the use of munitions and the announcement of dispersal orders.  \n50.  The Protesters stopped on Centre Avenue approximately 30 feet from the \nline of police officers.    \n51.  The Protesters were peaceful.   \n52.  The Protestersโ behavior was not materially different from the behavior of \nthe larger group of protesters earlier in the day, which the PBP openly approved and \nsupported.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 12 of 44\n53.  Groups of Protesters chanted, โHands up - Donโt Shoot,โ โThis is not a riot,โ \nโJoin us,โ and similar phrases. Some Protesters knelt on the ground with their hands in \nthe air. Link to Video 1; Link to Video 2 2 \n54.  The Protesters did not damage public or private property. \n55.  The Protesters did not throw bricks or rocks at the PBP officers.  \n56.  The Protesters did not engage in any activity that could have given rise to \na  reasonable  belief  that  they  were  likely  to  cause  substantial  harm  or  serious \ninconvenience, annoyance or alarm.  \n57.  The Protesters did not present an imminent threat to public safety, peace or \norder;  \n58.  Nevertheless, on information and belief, Defendant Trapp, Mescan, and \npossibly  other  individually  named  Defendants  made  the  decision  to  declare  the \nProtestersโ assembly unlawful and order the Protesters to disperse.  \n59.  Defendants Hissrich and Schubert were either present during the above-\ndescribed events or were otherwise aware of them as they occurred.  These Defendants \neither made the decision to declare the assembly unlawful, or approved of that decision \nand the basis for that decision.  \n60.  At approximately 7:17 pm, Officer Robert Monticelli, at the direction of \nDefendant Mercurio, made the following announcement (hereinafter โunlawful assembly \nannouncementโ):  \nI am Officer [unintelligible] of the Pittsburgh Police. I hereby \ndeclare this to be an unlawful assembly. I order all those \nassembled at this location to immediately disperse. You must \n \n2 All attachments can be viewed at the following link \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/hlnksjtotwpxs0a/AAC7A6p0dbTaMvxTwA8NArzYa?dl=0  \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 13 of 44\nleave this immediate vicinity.  If you remain in this vicinity you \nare in violation of the Pennsylvania crimes code. No matter \nwhat your purpose is you must leave. If you do not disperse \nyou will be arrested and/or subject to other police action. \nOther police action may include actual physical removal, the \nuse of riot control agents and/or less lethal munitions which \ncould cause the risk of injury for those who remain.  You must \nimmediately  leave  outbound  on  Centre  Avenue. \n[Unintelligible] \n \n61.  At that time, Centre Avenue outbound was blocked by numerous police \nvehicles and/or riot control officers; \n62.  Shortly after the first โunlawful assembly announcementโ was made, PBP \ndeployed a Long Range Acoustic Device (โLRADโ) against the Protesters.  A LRAD is \nmilitary-grade weapon that emits a โdeterrent toneโ so loud it can cause permanent \nhearing loss.   \n63.  Police warned the Protesters not to โadvanceโ on their line. However, nearly \nall of the Protesters were at least 30 feet away from the officers. At no time did any \nProtester โadvanceโ on the officers.  \n64.  Monticelli, at the direction of Defendant Mercurio, made more โunlawful \nassembly announcementsโ over the next several minutes and continued to deploy the \nLRAD.  \n65.  An unknown PBP officer discharged a firearm into the crowd hitting a \nProtester in the knee.  Other Protesters dragged the injured Protester to the sidewalk and \noffered him assistance.  Link to Video.   \n66.  Despite  this  aggressive  action  by  the  PBP,  the  Protesters  remained \npeaceful. They continued chanting but did not disperse. The Protesters did not throw \nrocks, bricks or bottles. The Protesters did not destroy property or commit acts of violence \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 14 of 44\nor vandalism. The Protesters did not advance on the police. Link to Video 1. Link to Video \n2.  \n67.  Despite the lack of any destruction, property damage or violent behavior by \nthe Protesters, on information and belief, Defendant Trappordered the PBP officers to \nuse force against the Protesters.  \n68.  The  PBP  and  Defendants  made  no  attempt  to  communicate  to  the \nProtesters why the assembly was declared unlawful. \n69.  The  PBP  and  Defendants  made  no  attempt  to  communicate  to  the \nProtesters why they were being ordered to disperse. \n70.  In the middle of an unlawful assembly announcement, a PBP police officer \nsuddenly threw a โflashbangโ grenade at the crowd.  Link to Video 1; Link to Video 2; Link \nto Video 3.   \n71.  A โflashbangโ grenade is an explosive device designed to frighten and \ndisorient an enemy through a blinding flash of light and extremely loud explosive noise.  \n72.  Defendant Mescan, as Tactical Commander of SWAT, authorized the use \nof flash bang grenades.  \n73.  Immediately following the detonation of the flashbang grenade, PBP officers \nbegan  firing  โrubber  bullets,โ  โbeanbags  roundsโ  and/or  โsponge  grenadesโ  at  the \nProtesters.  Link to Video.  \n74.  โRubber bullets,โ as used herein, refers to  12-gaugue super soc rounds \nmade out of Kevlar material and containing led pellets โBeanbag roundsโ are cloth bags \nfilled with lead shot which are fired from a 12-gauge shotgun.  โSponge grenadesโ are \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 15 of 44\nlarge plastic or metal bullets with dense foam rubber tips. They are typically fired from a \n40mm grenade launcher.  \n75.  Although these items are often referred to as โless lethalโ munitions, they \nare fired with the force of a gun or grenade launcher and have the capability to cause \nserious  injury  and/or death,  particularly  when fired at  close  range or  when fired  at \nvulnerable areas of the body.  \n76.  PBP officers also threw and/or shot canisters into the crowd, some of which \nemitted smoke (โsmoke bombsโ) and some of which emitted chemical gas commonly \nreferred to as โtear gasโ (โchemical grenades.โ)   \n77.  โTear gasโ generally refers to chemical agents that cause tearing, coughing, \ndifficulty breathing, skin irritation and/or vomiting.  Tear gas grenades can be thrown or \nfired from a grenade launcher.  \n78.  Tear  gas  can  cause  serious  complications  for  people  with  respiratory \nproblems.  Exposure to tear gas increases susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and/or \ncomplications.  \n79.  Numerous Protesters were injured by tear gas thrown into the crowd. Link \nto Video. Many Protesters were coughing, had tears streaming down their faces, and had \ndifficulty breathing and seeing. The tear gas caused some Protesters to vomit. \n80.  The explosions, gunfire, smoke and gas caused many of the Protesters to \npanic and run outbound on Centre Avenue and into nearby side streets. Link to Video.   \n81.  The PBP officers immediately began to march outbound on Centre Avenue, \ncontinuing  to  indiscriminately  shoot  rubber  bullets,  beanbag  rounds  and/or  sponge \ngrenades at the fleeing Protesters as they ran away. Link to Video.   \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 16 of 44\n82.   The  smoke  created  from  the  PBPโs  smoke  bombs  and  chemical  gas \ngrenades was so thick that the officers could not see what or who they were shooting.  \n83.  Videos show PBP officers shooting blindly into smoke-filled Centre Avenue \nas Protesters run away. Link to Video 1; Link to Video 2.  \n84.  Numerous Protesters were hit with rubber bullets, bean bag rounds and \nsponge grenades.  Some were seriously injured and required hospitalization. \n85.  One Protester was hit in the face with an unknown munition and knocked \nunconscious. He suffered serious injuries and began bleeding profusely. Other Protesters \ndragged him out of the street and attempted to render medical aid.  Link to Video ; Link \nto Photograph. As they did so a SWAT officer threw a chemical grenade at them.   \n86.  No ambulance arrived to treat or transport the protester, so other Protesters \neventually drove him to the hospital where, on information and belief, he was treated for \nmultiple facial fractures.  \n87.  The marching PBP officers were flanked on the sidewalks by PBP SWAT \nofficers who pointed their firearms at Protesters, shoved them and yelled at them. Link to \nVideo.   \n88.  As the PBP officers advanced, they continued to deploy chemical gas \ngrenades, sometimes throwing them at Protesters as they fled.  \n89.  PBP officers deployed oleoresin capsicum (โOCโ or โpepperโ) spray on \nfleeing and/or peaceful Protesters.  \n90.  Multiple video recordings from the scene show two Protesters in an alley as \nthe line of PBP officers approaches.  The Protesters are on their knees with their hands \nin the air.  An officer sprays an unknown substance, believed to be OC spray, into the \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 17 of 44\nProtestersโ faces multiple times from a distance of approximately five feet, causing them \nto run.  A SWAT officer then throws a cannister, believed to be a chemical gas grenade, \nat the fleeing Protesters as another officer shoots an unknown munition at them. Link to \nVideo 1; Link to Video 2.   \n91.  As the PBP officers advanced, they knowingly shot at peaceful Protesters \nfrom dangerously close range.  \n92.  Multiple video recordings from the scene depict a line of officers advancing \non three Protesters (two men and a woman).  The Protesters slowly walk backwards with \ntheir hands raised.  A SWAT officer shoots the female protester in the chest with an \nunknown munition from a distance of approximately 10 feet. Link to Video 1 ; Link to Video \n2.   \n93.  The PBP used advancing lines of officers and chemical gas to cut off \navenues of escape for fleeing Protesters.  As a result, Protesters were forced to choose \nbetween approaching a line of officers or retreating into clouds of chemical gas.  \n94.  Defendant Trapp directed officers in SRT and SWAT to perform โlightning \nstrikes,โ or targeting individuals for arrest.  \n95.  These โlightning strikesโ included following Protestors on camera to arrest \nthem after they had left the scene.  \n96.  PBP officers arrested trapped Protesters and falsely charged them with \nfailure to disperse and disorderly conduct. \n97.  PBP officers shot and threw chemical gas canisters at trapped Protesters. \n98.  PBP officers continued to deploy chemical gas and other munitions on \nProtesters, bystanders and passers-by throughout East Liberty long after the Protesters \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 18 of 44\nhad  dispersed  and  over  a  half  mile  away  from  where  the  Protesters  had  initially \nassembled. Link to Video 1 ; Link to video 2  Link to Video 3;  Link to Video 4.  \n99.  All Individual Defendants made and/or endorsed the decision to deploy \nchemical gas and other munitions at Protestors, bystanders, and passers-by. \n100.  PBP arrested and criminally charged 22 people on June 1 in relation to the \nprotest. \n101.  Despite a lack of probable cause for these arrests, the PBP transported the \n22 arrestees to the Allegheny County Jail where they were confined for hours in close \nquarters, in an area known to cause an increased risk of contracting COVID-19.  \n102.  On  June  18,  the  Allegheny  County  District  Attorneyโs  Office  withdrew \ncharges against all 22 people arrested and charged by PBP due to a lack of evidence.3 \nc.  PBP prevented injured Protesters from receiving medical treatment  \n103.  At all times relevant, at least one ambulance was at the scene and was \nescorted by an armored SWAT vehicle. This ambulance was not used to provide medical \ntreatment  or  transportation  to  injured  Protesters.  On  information  and  belief,  this \nambulance was requested by the PBP and was reserved to treat PBP personnel.   \n104.  On information and belief, the PBP made no effort to ensure that EMTs or \nother trained medical professionals were available to treat injured Protesters, despite \nknowing that the level of force they planned to use against Protesters was likely to cause \nserious injury or death.   \n105.  On information and belief, PBP officers prevented EMTs from entering the \narea and treating injured Protesters.  \n \n3 https://triblive.com/local/pittsburgh-allegheny/charged-dropped-for-22-protesters-arrested-in-east-liberty-\nmelee/ \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 19 of 44\n106.  Because  the  PBP  did  not  ensure  that  EMTs  were  available  to  treat \nProtesters and/or prevented EMTs from treating Protesters, injured Protesters received \nmedical assistance by untrained and unqualified individuals and were transported to the \nhospital in cars and pickup trucks.  \nd.  Plaintiffs Nicole Rulli, Charles Bryant, Jr. and A.F. (the โRulli familyโ) \n107.  The Rulli family left for the protest when Rulli got home from work.  They \narrived at the corner of Centre Avenue and Penn Avenue at approximately 6:15.  \n108.  The  Rulli  family  joined  the  Protesters  as  they  marched  down  Centre \nAvenue;  \n109.  The Rulli family did not participate in any vandalism, violence or destruction, \nnor did they witness any vandalism, violence or destruction before the PBP used force \nagainst the Protesters.   \n110.  The Rulli family did not throw any objects at PBP officers, nor did they \nwitness anyone else throwing objects at PBP officers before the PBP used force against \nthe Protesters. \n111.  The Rulli family did not disperse when ordered to do so because the \nProtesters were peaceful and they believed they had a First Amendment right to protest \npolice misconduct in that place, at that time and in that manner.  \n112.  After the PBP officers began shooting at them and gassing them, the Rulli \nfamily  ran  outbound  on  Centre  Avenue  as  directed  by  the  unlawful  assembly \nannouncement. \n113.  The Rulli family found that Centre Avenue outbound was blocked by PBP \npolice in riot gear. Link to Photograph.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 20 of 44\n114.  All of the side streets leading off of Centre Avenue were similarly blocked. \n115.  Unable  to  escape,  the  Rulli  family  ran  to  the  top  of  a  parking \nstructure/shopping center along Centre Avenue at Beatty Street.  \n116.  From the top of the parking garage they witnessed a Protester on a side \nstreet  below  who  was  bleeding  profusely  from  the  head.    Several  Protesters  were \nsurrounding the injured individual and attempting to render medical aid.  No PBP officers \nor City of Pittsburgh EMTs assisted. Link to Video. As the Rulli family watched, a PBP \nofficer threw a chemical grenade at the injured Protester and those trying to assist him.  \n117.  Eventually the PBP officers advanced far enough down Centre Avenue that \nthe Rulli family was able to exit the parking structure behind them and walk down the \nsidewalk on Centre Avenue toward their car, which was parked near the Target store.   \n118.  As the Rulli family walked down Centre Avenue toward its intersection with \nPenn Avenue, an armored vehicle full of SWAT officers stopped in the middle of the street. \nThe armored vehicle was followed by a City of Pittsburgh ambulance and several other \nPBP vehicles.  \n119.  The corner of Penn and Centre is well over a half mile from the location \nwhere the Protesters had gathered.   \n120.  Several SWAT Officers exited the armored vehicle. Without warning, one of \nthese SWAT officers threw a chemical gas grenade at the Rulli family.  Link to Video. \n121.  The grenade hit Rulliโs foot and immediately began spewing gas in her face; \nSWAT officers threw two more chemical gas grenades at the family.  \n122.  Rulli yelled to thirteen-year-old A.F., telling him to run as she collapsed, \nunable to breathe and in excruciating pain. \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 21 of 44\n123.  Bryant, who suffers from asthma, was similarly disabled by the chemical \ngas the PBP officer had thrown at them. \n124.  The ambulance which followed the armored tactical vehicle did not assist \nRulli or Bryant.  \n125.  A group of Protesters attempted to render aide to Rulli and Bryant.  \n126.  A legal observer called 9-1-1 and requested an ambulance.  She informed \nthe operator that Mr. Bryant suffered from asthma and had been tear gassed.  \n127.  Rulli and Bryant waited for approximately a half hour. No ambulance arrived \nto treat them.  \n128.  Bryant began searching for A.F.  He asked a PBP officer if he had seen a \nthirteen-year-old boy without his parents.  The PBP officer dismissively told him, โThatโs \non you.โ  \n129.  Upon being told by his mother to run, thirteen-year-old A.F. had run to the \nparking lot of the Giant Eagle grocery store located near Penn Avenue and Shady \nAvenue.  He was disoriented from the effects of the chemical gas and his phone battery \nwas dead, so he was unable to call Rulli or Bryant.  \n130.  A group of strangers found A.F. and attempted to clean the chemicals out \nof his eyes. One of them lent him a phone to call Rulli and Bryant.  These strangers stayed \nwith A.F. until Rulli and Bryant were able to get him.  \n131.  As a direct and proximate result of PBPโs actions, A.F. has become fearful \nof police officers.  \n132.  As a direct and proximate result of PBPโs actions, A.F. has become fearful \nof being separated from his parents.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 22 of 44\n133.  As a direct and proximate result of the PBPโs actions, A.F. has become \nfearful of protests.   \n134.  A.F.โs fears, particularly his fear of protests, has caused the Rulli family to \navoid attending protest events which they would otherwise have attended.  \n135.  As a direct and proximate result of PBPโs actions, Rulli, Bryant and A.F. \nhave suffered physical and emotional injuries. \ne.  Plaintiff Simon Phillips \n136.  Plaintiff Simon Phillips participated in the protest and march which began at \n3:30 at the Target store at the corner of Centre Avenue and Penn Avenue. Phillips left the \nprotest at 5:00 pm to teach a dance class.  \n137.  Phillips returned to the protest at approximately 6:30 pm and marched down \nCentre Avenue with the Protesters.  \n138.  Phillips did not participate in any vandalism, violence or destruction, nor did \nhe witness any vandalism, violence or destruction before the PBP used force against the \nProtesters.   \n139.  Phillips did not throw any objects at PBP officers, nor did he witness anyone \nelse throwing objects at PBP officers before the PBP used force against the Protesters.  \n140.  After the PBP made the first unlawful assembly announcement and before \nPBP officers began using force against the Protesters, Phillips left the area and tried to \nreturn to his apartment.  \n141.  Phillipsโ apartment is over a half mile from the Corner of Centre Avenue and \nNegley Avenue.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 23 of 44\n142.  When Phillips was approximately 200 yards from his apartment, an armored \nvehicle drove up behind him and several SWAT officers jumped out brandishing firearms.   \n143.  Another line of SWAT officers approached him from the other direction, \ntrapping him.  \n144.  Two women were also trapped by the encroaching SWAT officers.  \n145.  The SWAT team ordered Phillips and the women to put their hands up and \ndrop to the ground, which they did.  \n146.  The SWAT officers bound their hands with zip ties and dragged them to the \ncurb.   \n147.  The SWAT officers would not tell them why they were being arrested.  \n148.  As Phillips was being detained, PBP officers approached, tackled and \nforcibly arrested a woman as she complained about the arrests. The PBP officers then \nthrew  a  grenade  that  contained  either  smoke  or  chemical  gas  at  onlookers  who \nquestioned the officersโ actions and/or attempted to videotape them. Link to Video.   \n149.  An hour and a half after he was taken into custody, the officers lifted Phillips \nto put in him a police vehicle.  There was a pool of blood on the ground where he had \nbeen sitting. The zip ties had lacerated Phillipsโ left wrist.  \n150.  PBP officers transported Phillips to the hospital where he received multiple \nstitches in his left wrist. Link to Photograph. Phillips did not believe he needed stitches \nand requested not to get them. PBP officers told him he could not be jailed at the \nAllegheny County Jail without them. Phillips later received a bill from the University of \nPittsburgh Medical Center for $868. \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 24 of 44\n151.  PBP  officers  remained  with  Phillips  while  he  was  in  the  hospital  and \ntransported Phillips from the hospital to the Allegheny County Jail, where he was detained \novernight.   \n152.  Phillips was charged with disorderly conduct and failure to disperse.  \n153.  The officers who arrested Phillips had no probable cause to believe that he \nhad committed the crimes of disorderly conduct or failure to disperse.  \n154.  All of the charges against Phillips were withdrawn prior to his preliminary \nhearing due to a lack of evidence.  \n155.  As a direct and proximate result of the conduct of the PBP, Phillips suffered \nphysical and emotional injury.  \nf.  Plaintiff Jay Yoder  \n156.  Plaintiff Jay Yoder attended the June 1, 2020 protest to participate in the \nprotest, document the event and assist injured Protesters as needed.  \n157.  Yoder did not participate in any vandalism, violence or destruction, nor did \nthey witness any vandalism, violence or destruction before the PBP used force against \nthe Protesters.   \n158.  Yoder did not throw any objects at PBP officers, nor did they witness \nanyone else throwing objects at PBP officers before the PBP used force against the \nProtesters.  \n159.  Yoder did not leave when ordered to do so by the PBP because they \nbelieved they had a constitutionally protected right to continue to protest, as well as to \ndocument the PBPโs actions and assist Protesters. \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 25 of 44\n160.  Soon after PBP officers began shooting and gassing the Protesters, Yoder, \nwho was on the sidewalk, began to retreat;  \n161.  Because of a disability, Yoder was unable to move fast enough to satisfy \nthe officers. PBP SWAT officers yelled at and pushed Yoder.  Link to Video.  \n162.  Chemical gas burned Yoderโs eyes, nose, throat and skin. \n163.  The PBP fired munitions including rubber bullets, bean bag rounds and \nsponge grenades at Yoder.  \n164.  Yoder witnessed a SWAT officer shoot a female protester in the chest with \nan unknown munition which Yoder believed to be a tear gas grenade from a distance of \napproximately 10 feet. Link to Video.   \n165.  After the Protesters dispersed, Yoder attempted to leave the scene but was \nblocked by PBP officers.  \n166.  Yoder stated repeatedly to the officers, โMy car is over there,โ and โIโm just \ntrying to get to my car.โ  \n167.  Nevertheless, PBP officers ordered Yoder to the ground, arrested and \nfalsely charged them with failure to disperse and disorderly conduct.  Link to Video.   \n168.  PBP officers transported Yoder to Allegheny County Jail where they were \ndetained overnight.   \n169.  PBP  officers  did  not  have  probable  cause  to  believe  that  Yoder  had \ncommitted the crimes of failure to disperse or disorderly conduct.  \n170.  All of the charges against Yoder were withdrawn prior to their preliminary \nhearing.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 26 of 44\n171.  However, on or about January 20, 2021, more than seven months after the \nJune 1 protest, Yoder was recharged with failure to disperse and disorderly conduct.  \n172.  At least one other protestor was similarly recharged in January 2021.  \n173.  According to the Allegheny County District Attorneyโs office, the decision to \nrecharge Yoder and others was made by PBP.  \n174.  PBP officers continued to lack probable cause to believe Yoder and other \nprotestors committed the crimes of failure to disperse or disorderly conduct.  \n175.  As a direct and proximate result of PBPโs use of chemical gas against \nYoder, Yoder is at increased risk of contracting and/or suffering complications from \nCOVID-19.  \n176.  As the direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ actions, Yoder suffered \nphysical injuries and emotional distress. \n \n \ng.  Plaintiff Donovan Hayden \n177.  Plaintiff Donovan Hayden participated in the march which took place from \napproximately 3:30 pm to 6:30 pm and joined the smaller group of Protesters who \ncontinued marching down Centre Avenue. \n178.  Hayden did not participate in any vandalism, violence or destruction, nor did \nhe witness any vandalism, violence or destruction before the PBP used force against the \nProtesters. \n179.  Hayden did not throw any objects at PBP officers, nor did he witness anyone \nelse throwing objects at PBP officers before the PBP used force against the Protesters.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 27 of 44\n180.  Hayden did not leave when ordered to do so by the PBP because he \nbelieved he had a First Amendment right to peacefully protest and the order to disperse \nviolated the Constitution. \n181.  Chemical gas burned Haydenโs eyes, nose, throat and skin and Hayden \nnearly vomited from the effects of the gas.  \n182.  As a result of PBPโs use of chemical gas against Hayden, Hayden is at \nincreased risk of contracting and/or suffering complications from COVID-19.  \n183.  As  a  result  of  PBPโs  actions,  Hayden  suffered  physical  injuries  and \nemotional distress.  \nh.  Plaintiff Christopher Wilson Juring \n184.  Plaintiff Christopher Wilson Juring participated in the march which took \nplace from 3:30 pm to 6:30 pm and then joined the smaller group of Protesters who \nmarched down Centre Avenue at approximately 6:30.  \n185.  Juring did not participate in any vandalism, violence or destruction, nor did he \nwitness any vandalism, violence or destruction before the PBP used force against the \nProtesters.   \n186.  Juring did not throw any objects at PBP officers, nor did he witness anyone \nelse throwing objects at PBP officers before the PBP used force against the Protesters.  \n187.  Juring did not leave when ordered to do so by the PBP because he believed \nhe had a First Amendment right to peacefully protest and the order to disperse violated \nthe Constitution.  \n188.  When police began to fire munitions and tear gas into the crowd, Juring ran \noutbound on Centre Avenue in an attempt to leave the area.  \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 28 of 44\n189.  The PBP struck Juring with four rubber bullets in his lower back and the \nbacks of his legs as he ran away.  Link to Photograph 1; Link to Photograph 2; Link to \nPhotograph 3.  Link to Photograph 4.   \n190.  Chemical gas burned Juringโs eyes, nose, throat and skin. \n191.  As a result of PBPโs use of chemical gas against Juring, Juring is at \nincreased risk of contracting and/or suffering complications from COVID-19.  \n192.  As a result of PBPโs actions, Juring suffered physical injuries and emotional \ndistress.  \n \n \n \n \ni.  City of Pittsburgh Officials falsely accused the Protesters of misconduct and \nminimized the PBPโs use of force \n \n193.  At 11:00 on the evening of June 1, 2020 Individual Defendants Hissrich, \nSchubert, Vinansky, and Lando  along with City of Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto, held \na press conference. Link to Transcript.  \n194.  At the press conference,  Peduto, Hissrich and Schubert praised the actions \nof the PBP toward the Protesters in East Liberty that evening.   \n195.  Defendant Hissrich Stated: \nAnd I just want to mention that the work that was done by the \nofficers . . . tonight should be commended . . . I think we \nprevented businesses from being looted and possibly set \nafire. So I just want to commend all the public safety, the \ndifferent  law  enforcement  agencies  that  were  out  there \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 29 of 44\ntonight, and I think the public, they should be thanking the \npolice officers for the work that they have done. \n196.  Defendant Schubert stated: \nI give a lot of credit to the officers who were there because I \nwatched  them.  They  did  an  incredible  job.  They  did  an \nincredible job trying to keep the public safe while they were \nout there. \n \n197.  Peduto Stated: \n. . .  it was then that the officers escalated to the point of being \nable to break the crowd up, and that finally succeeded. What \nwe did not see is East Liberty is not on fire tonight. People \nfrom East Liberty are not harmed. Two protestors were taken \nfor  evaluation,  and  they  should  be  absolutely  fine.  Nine \nofficers were hurt by protestors. \n198.  In  order  to  justify  the  PBPโs  unwarranted  violence  against  peaceful \nProtesters,  Individual Defendants  falsely accused  the Protesters of  misconduct  and \nwrongdoing. These false accusations included:   \ni.  that Protesters vandalized buildings and broke glass windows; \n \nii.  that Protesters engaged in acts of violence and destruction;  \n \niii.  that Protesters attacked a KDKA television news crew; \n \niv.  that Protesters attacked Defendant Vinansky in his police vehicle.  \n \nv.  that Protesters were trying to or intended to โburn East Liberty down;โ \n \nvi.  that Protesters were โonly there to cause damage and to try to hurt \npolice officers.โ \n \nvii.  that the PBPโs use of force was precipitated by Protesters throwing \nrocks, bricks and water bottles at police officers;   \n \nviii.  that Protesters injured nine PBP officers by throwing rocks and bricks \nat their heads, chests, pelvis areas, knees and shoulders; \n \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 30 of 44\nix.  that PBP used force against the Protesters only after the Protesters \nthrew multiple โvolleys of bricksโ at officers; \n \n199.  Following the protests, Individual Defendants also attempted to minimize \nthe level of force PBP used by falsely claiming that:  \ni.  the only force PBP used against the Protesters was โsmoke;โ \n \nii.  PBP did not use chemical gas against Protesters; \n \niii.  PBP did not use, โcrowd munitionsโ against Protesters \n \niv.  PBP did not use โrubber bulletsโ against Protesters;  \n \nv.  Only two protesters were injured by PBP use of force; \n \nvi.  no Protesters were seriously injured by PBP use of force; \n \nvii.  City of Pittsburgh personnel treated all injured Protesters at the \nscene and transported them to hospitals. \nj.  Defendantsโ prior tolerance of more threatening protestors demonstrates \nthat Defendants did not reasonably believe Protestors posed a threat to \npublic safety, peace or order \n200.  On April 20, 2020 protesters congregated on Grant Street in Downtown \nPittsburgh to protest Governor Tom Wolfโs decision to close businesses due to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic.  \n201.  Many of the April 20 protesters openly carried tactical rifles and wore \nparamilitary outfits.  A group of these protesters referred to themselves as โThe Iron City \nResponse Guard.โ When asked by a reporter why they had armed themselves in this \nmanner for a peaceful protest, one belligerently responded, โWhy not?โ  \n202.  The June 1, 2020 Protesters were not carrying tactical rifles, or any other \nfirearms.  The June 1, protesters were not dressed in paramilitary outfits.  \n30 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 31 of 44\n203.  The unarmed and peaceful June 1, 2020 Protesters posed less of a threat \nof โsubstantial harm or serious inconvenience, annoyance or alarmโ to the residents of \nthe City of Pittsburgh than the heavily armed April 20 protesters.  \n204.  On information and belief, the PBP did not deploy SWAT units, armored \nvehicles, riot police and/or snipers to the April 20 protests.  \n205.  The PBP did not declare the April 20 protests to be unlawful, order the \nprotesters to disperse and/or use force to disperse them.  \nk.  City of Pittsburgh Officials were aware of, acquiesced in and/or failed to \nintervene to prevent the violation of the Protestersโ rights.  \n206.  Individual Defendants witnessed or were otherwise aware of the events \ndescribed herein as they unfolded. \n207.  Individual Defendants were aware that the Protesters were peaceful and \nwere engaged in constitutionally protected speech.  \n208.  Individual  Defendants  did  not  have  a  reasonable  expectation  that  the \nProtesters would cause substantial harm or serious inconvenience, annoyance or alarm; \n209.  Individual defendants did not have reason to believe that the Protesters \npresented an imminent threat to public safety, peace or order;  \n210.  Individual Defendants ordered, authorized and/or acquiesced in the order \nto declare the assembly unlawful;  \n211.   Individual Defendants ordered, authorized and/or acquiesced in the use of \nexcessive force against Protesters;  \n212.  Individual  Defendants  had  the  opportunity  to  intervene  to  prevent  the \nviolation of the Protestersโ constitutionally protected rights and failed or refused to do so;     \n31 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 32 of 44\nl.  The decision to use force constituted the official policy of the City of \nPittsburgh  \n \n213.  Defendants Hissrich and Schubert, jointly and/or individually, possessed \nfinal policymaking authority to make the decision to 1) declare Protestersโ assembly \nunlawful, 2) use force to disperse Protesters and 3) use noxious chemical gas and \nextremely  dangerous  and  painful  rubber  bullets,  beanbag  rounds  and/or  sponge \ngrenades against Protesters. \n214.  Hissrich and Schubert jointly and/or individually made, approved and/or \nacquiesced in these decisions to violate Protestersโ constitutional rights.  \n215.  The violation of Protestersโ rights was the direct result of the official policy \nof the City of Pittsburgh.  \nm. PBP violated its policy regarding discharge of less lethal munitions \n \n216.  PBPโs policy regarding discharge of less lethal munitions does not provide \nfor  the  use  of  rubber  bullets  or  sponge  grenades.  Nevertheless, PBP  officers  shot \nProtesters with rubber bullets and sponge grenades. \n217.  PBPโs Policy regarding discharge of less lethal munitions does not permit \ndischarge  from  less  than  20  feet.  Nevertheless,  officers  discharged  rubber  bullets, \nbeanbags and/or sponge grenades at Protesters from a distance of far less than 20 feet.  \n218.  PBP policy recognizes that, โThe use of kinetic energy impact projectiles \nare considered deadly force, if intentionally deployed to areas of the subjects [sic] body \nthat are recognized as likely to cause serious bodily injury or death (head, neck, throat, \nchest or solar plexus).โ  PBP policy prohibits officers from targeting these areas of a \npersonโs body unless deadly force is justified.  Nevertheless, PBP officers fired hundreds \n32 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 33 of 44\nof  rubber bullets,  beanbags  and/or  sponge grenades  indiscriminately  into  clouds  of \nsmoke, through which they could not see the Protestersโ bodies.  As a result, Protesters \nwere hit with projectiles in areas of their bodies likely to cause serious bodily injury and \nwere, in fact, seriously injured.   \n219.  PBP policy requires officers to transport persons subject to kinetic energy \nimpact projectiles to a medical facility for evaluation and treatment.  PBP did not transport \nProtesters injured by rubber bullets and bean bags to medical facilities, or render any \nmedical aid whatsoever, even though an ambulance accompanied police vehicles. PBP \ndid not pre-arrange for medical care or transportation for injured Protesters, even though \nit intended to use levels of force which were likely to cause serious injury or death to \nProtesters.  \n220.  PBPโs failure to follow its own policy regarding discharge of less lethal \nmunitions constituted deliberate indifference to the rights of Plaintiffs.  \n \n \nn.  PBP failed to adopt necessary policies and procedures regarding crowd \ncontrol \n221.  The PBP does not have a policy governing the declaration of assemblies as \nโunlawfulโ and the forced dispersal of protests, even though the need for such a policy is \nobvious.   \n222.  The  PBP does not have  a  policy  governing  the use  of  chemical gas, \nflashbang grenades and/or smoke bombs even though the need for such a policy is \nobvious.   \n33 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 34 of 44\n223.  PBPโs failure to adopt these policies constituted deliberate indifference to \nthe constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and other peaceful Protesters with whom PBP officers \ncome into contact.   \no.  PBPโs failed to properly train officers regarding crowd control  \n224.  PBPโs  use  of  force  training  curriculum  does  not  address,  or  does  not \nproperly address, crowd/riot control techniques, use of impact munitions, chemical gas, \nflashbang grenades and/or smoke bombs.  \n225.  PBP does not train, or does not properly train, officers in crowd/riot control \ntechniques;  \n226.  PBP  does  not  train,  or  does  not  properly  train,  officers  in  the  use  of \nmunitions such as rubber bullets, bean bag rounds and/or sponge grenades.  \n227.  PBP  does  not  train,  or  does  not  properly  train,  officers  in  the  use  of \nchemicals, such as โtear gasโ and/or OC spray for crowd control purposes.  \n228.  PBP  does  not  train,  or  does  not  properly  train,  officers  in  the  use  of \nflashbang devices and/or smoke bombs for crowd control purposes.  \n229.  PBPโs failure to train its officers, as hereinbefore described, constituted \ndeliberate indifference to the rights of Plaintiffs and other peaceful protesters with whom \nPBP officers come into contact.  \nV)  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n \n230.  Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure;  \n231.  Plaintiffs seek to represent a primary class and two subclasses. \n232.  The proposed primary class consists of the following: \n34 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 35 of 44\nEvery individual who was present at or near the intersection \nof  Centre  Avenue  and  Negley  Avenue  in  the  City  of \nPittsburgh on June 1, 2020 for the purpose of engaging in \nlawful protest and who was ordered to disperse by the City of \nPittsburgh Bureau of Police.  \n233.  The first proposed subclass (Subclass A) consists of the following: \nEvery member of the primary class who was subjected to \nforce by City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Officers, or law \nenforcement officers acting under the direction of the City of \nPittsburgh Bureau of Police.   \n234.  The second proposed subclass (Subclass B) consists of the following: \nEvery member of the primary class who was arrested and/or \nwho was criminally charged with disorderly conduct and/or \nfailure to disperse by City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police \nofficers or other officers acting under the direction of the City \nof Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.  \n235.  The requirements of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23(a)(1) are satisfied with regard to \nclasses and subclasses in that Plaintiff estimates that there are at least 100 class \nmembers in the primary class and subclass A, and at least 22 class members of subclass \nB, whose interests would be affected by any order of declaratory or injunctive relief.  The \nnumber of class members is so large that joinder of all its members is impracticable. \n236.  The requirements of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23(a)(2) are satisfied in that there are \nquestions of law and fact common to the classes, including but not limited to:  \ni.  Whether the Defendants violated the First Amendment \nto the United States Constitution when they declared \nthe  Protesters  peaceful  assembly  โunlawfulโ  and \nordered Protesters to disperse? \nii.  Whether the Defendants violated the First Amendment \nto the United States Constitution when they used force \nto  disperse  Protesters  who  were  peaceably \nassembled? \niii.  Whether  the  Defendants  violated  the  Fourth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution when \n35 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 36 of 44\nthey  used  force  to  disperse  Protesters  who  were \npeaceably assembled? \n \niv.  Whether the Defendants violated the Fourth and/or \nFourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution  by  using  unnecessary  and  excessive \nforce  to  disperse  Protesters  who  were  peaceably \nassembled? \n \nv.  Whether the Defendants violated the Fourth and/or \n14th Amendments to the United States Constitution by \nfailing to adequately train, supervise, regulate PBP \nofficers,  including  failure  to  promulgate  necessary \npolicies,  in  responding  to  individuals  exercising \nconstitutionally  protected  rights  to  protest  and/or \nassemble.  \n237.  The requirements of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23(a)(3) are satisfied in that Plaintiffsโ \nclaims are typical of the claims of the class.  Plaintiff and all class members are seeking \ninjunctive relief and damages under federal law. Any finding that that Defendantsโ conduct \nviolated Plaintiffsโ rights will be applicable to all class members.   \n238.  The requirements of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23(a)(4)  are satisfied in that Plaintiffsโ \nattorneys, Margaret S. Coleman, Esq., and the Law Offices of Timothy P. OโBrien; Quinn \nCozzens and the Abolitionist Law Center, and Christine T. Elzer and Elzer Law Firm, LLC,  \nwill fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class in that:  (i) they have done \nsignificant work in identifying and investigating potential claims prior to filing this action; \n(ii) they and their respective firms have extensive experience litigating class actions, other \ncomplex litigation and the types of claims asserted in the Class Action Complaint; (iii) they \nhave extensive knowledge of the applicable law; and (iv) they are advancing the costs of \nthe litigation.  \n239.  The  requirements  of  Fed.  R.  Civ.  Pro.  23(b)(1)  are  satisfied  in  that \nprosecuting  separate  actions  by  individual  class  members  would  create  a  risk  of  \n36 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 67   Filed 09/16/21   Page 37 of 44\ninconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual class members that would \nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class; and/or \nadjudications with respect to individual class members that, as a practical matter, would \nbe dispositive of the interests of other members not parties to the individual adjudications \nor would substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests. \n240.  The requirements of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23(b)(2) are satisfied in that the \nparties opposing the class have acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally \nto the class so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate \nrespecting the class as a whole. \n241.  The requirements of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23(b)(3) are satisfied in that common \nquestions of law and fact predominate over any questions affecting only individual class \nmembers.  \n242.  A class action is the superior method of fairly and efficiently adjudicating the \ncontroversy,  particularly  given  the  limited  resources  available  to  individual  class \nmembers.  \nVI)  CLAIMS \n \nCOUNT I \nNamed Plaintiffs and Primary Class Members v. Individual Defendants \nViolation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution \n243.

The minor plaintiffsโ date of birth is October 2, 2006.     \n  2.  The minor plaintiffโs allegations are as follows: A.F. is one of seven named \nplaintiffs in this action.  On June 1, 2020, A.F. (then 13 years old) attended a protest in the East \nLiberty section of Pittsburgh with his mother (Nicole Rulli) and her fiancรฉ (Charles Bryant). \nPittsburgh Police ordered A.F., Rulli, Bryant and approximately 150 other peaceful protesters to \ndisperse. Pittsburgh Police then forcibly dispersed the protesters by use of chemical gas and other \nโless lethalโ munitions.  As A.F. and Rulli and Bryant attempted to leave the area, Pittsburgh Police \nthrew a tear gas canister at the family, hitting Rulli in the foot.  A.F. was subjected to gas from the \ncontainer.  A.F. ran away from the scene and became separated from his mother and Bryant. A.F. \nalleges that the conduct of the Pittsburgh Police violated his First and Fourth Amendment rights. \nA.F. sustained ongoing emotional distress from the experience. \n3. A.F. did not sustain any injuries for which he sought medical treatment.  Therefore, there \nare no relevant statements of attending physicians.  \n4. Since this case was filed in June of 2020, counsel for Plaintiffs have conducted eleven \n(11) depositions (including two expert depositions) and defended eight (8) depositions (including \none expert deposition.)  Counsel for Plaintiffs have reviewed over 13,000 pages of documents and \nseveral hundred hours of video. Plaintiffsโ counselsโ billable fees, to date, are approximately \n$440,000.  Plaintiffsโ counsel have incurred $36,517 in costs which have not yet been reimbursed.  \n  5.  In accordance with ongoing settlement negotiations, of which this Court was \nnotified, the Parties have agreed to settle the claims asserted in this action for $275,000 inclusive \nof costs and fees, to be divided equally among the seven Plaintiffs.  Of this sum, $101,750 will be \npaid directly to Plaintiffsโ Counsel for fees.  Counselsโ fees represent 37% of the total settlement \nand a ยพ compromise of fees incurred.  In addition, $36,517 will be paid to Plaintiffsโ Counsel for \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-CB-LPL   Document 124   Filed 04/05/23   Page 3 of 3\nreimbursement of costs incurred in prosecuting this action.

However, both groups of plaintiffs purport to act on behalf of essentially the \nsame class of plaintiffs. Although the specific relief sought in each case is different, both \nsets of plaintiffs urge that a pattern of unconstitutional behavior on the part of the police is \nshown by their evidence of numerous specific instances of such alleged misconduct; each \n\ngroup relies upon a different set of specific instances as examples alleged to establish the \npattern. Since I have heard all of the evidence in both cases, it would be difficult, and in my \nopinion improper, in view of the nature of the claims, to dispose of each case separately, \nbased upon its own limited record. The defendants in both cases are essentially the same, \nand are represented by the same counsel in both cases. \n1291*1291 This Court's disposition of these cases has already been delayed too long. Much \nof this delay is squarely the responsibility of the Court, and is attributable to other pressing \ndemands of its case load. In partial justification for this unfortunate delay, it may be noted \nthat the records of the two cases are extremely complex, the issues involved are subtle and \nsomewhat novel, and the required decisions touch upon sensitive and emotion-filled \naspects of community life. \nAnother factor requires mention. During the pendency of these two actions before the \nundersigned, a third case filed by different plaintiffs on behalf of the same class of plaintiffs, \nseeking similar relief, was pending before another member of this Court. That case, which \nwas instituted after the Goode case but before the COPPAR case, eventuated in a consent \ndecree granting injunctive relief, dated December 18, 1972. The defendants in all three \ncases are essentially the same, and all have been represented throughout by the City \nSolicitor's office. Nevertheless, at no time have defense counsel meaningfully addressed \nthemselves to the class action issues involved, nor to questions of res judicata or collateral \nestoppel which may be involved. \nA brief summary of the issues in all three cases will provide a starting point for analysis: In \nthe Goode case, Civil Action No. 70-491, plaintiffs contend that certain police officers of the \nCity of Philadelphia are biased against Negroes and other minority groups, and habitually \nviolate their legal and constitutional rights in the course of carrying out their police duties; \nthat the proclivities of these officers are well known to their superiors in the Department; that \nthe persons in control of the supervision of the Police Department, by failing to take \nappropriate disciplinary action, have condoned these illegal and unconstitutional activities, \nas a matter of policy. Plaintiffs further contend that there is no adequate machinery for \ndealing with civilian complaints against the police, and that departmental resistance to the \ncreation or implementation of adequate complaint procedures justifies the conclusion that it \nis the policy of the Department to condone racially discriminatory actions by the police. \nPlaintiffs seek two kinds of relief in this action: removal or other appropriate disciplinary \naction in the cases of certain named policemen; and establishment of appropriate \nmachinery to deal with civilian complaints against police. \nThe COPPAR plaintiffs (Civil Action No. 70-2430) allege widespread and systematic \nviolations of the constitutional rights of Negroes and other citizens by the police in the \nroutine performance of their duties, with the express or tacit approval of their superiors. \nPlaintiffs ask the Court to appoint a \"receiver\" or similar official to supervise the Police \nDepartment (presumably, sweeping injunctive relief, and the appointment of a master to \nsupervise enforcement of the decree), to prevent further violations. This case was originally \nprecipitated by certain incidents involving police raids on buildings thought to be occupied \nby members of the \"Black Panther\" Party, threatened interference with a proposed \nconvention of that group of the City, and the alleged holding of certain black militants \nwithout probable cause and in excessive bail. At an earlier stage, this Court entered a \n\ntemporary restraining order which alleviated some of the immediate problems; eventually, \nthis order expired by its own terms, and has not been renewed. \nThe plaintiffs in Goode presented evidence of ten specific instances of alleged violations, \ntogether with a mass of evidence, including expert testimony, dealing with the alleged \ninadequacies of existing complaint procedures; the defendants produced some \ncountervailing evidence on both subjects. The COPPAR plaintiffs produced evidence \nrelating to some 30 additional specific instances of alleged misconduct, and a limited \namount of evidence challenging the complaint procedures; the defendants presented \nevidence to the contrary in most, if not all, of the instances alleged. \n1292*1292 In the third action, Alexander et al. v. Rizzo et al., Civil Action No. 70-992, the \nprincipal charge of discrimination against blacks alleged in the complaint was the practice of \nwidespread arrests \"for investigation,\" and incidental indignities related thereto, apparently \ntriggered by a particular incident involving the murder of a Philadelphia police officer. The \ninjunctive decree in that case, which was entered \"without hearing or trial and upon the \nstipulation of the parties\", embodies detailed provisions governing police contacts with \ncivilians based upon less than probable cause for arrest. \nThe Court's findings of fact are set forth below. They reflect evaluations of credibility which \ngive appropriate weight, on the one hand, to the anti-police bias of many of the complaining \nwitnesses, and their emotional involvement in the incidents, and, on the other hand, to the \nnatural reluctance of the accused officers to concede any misconduct on their part. \nWhenever the merits were substantially in doubt, the defendants were accorded the full \nbenefit of the presumption that the police officers acted properly. \nI. FINDINGS OF FACT \nA. General \nDuring the period covered by the evidence produced at the hearings in these cases, James \nH. J. Tate was Mayor of Philadelphia, and Frank L. Rizzo was Police Commissioner. Mr. \nRizzo is now the Mayor. \nDuring the same period, Fred T. Corleto, was Managing Director of the City of Philadelphia; \nHillel S. Levinson is now the Managing Director. Under ยง 5-100 of the Philadelphia Home \nRule Charter, the Managing Director is charged with responsibility for supervising all \nactivities of those departments the heads of which are appointed by him. Under ยง 3-206 of \nthe Charter, the Managing Director, with the approval of the Mayor, appoints the Police \nCommissioner. \nThe Police Commissioner, under Charter ยง 3-404, serves at the pleasure of the Managing \nDirector. He has responsibility for supervision and control over activities of the Police \nDepartment. Charter ยง 5-200(b) provides that the Police Department \"shall discipline the \nPhiladelphia police.\" \n\nDefendant Robert G. Selfridge is Deputy Police Commissioner in charge of the uniformed \nforces of the Police Department. Defendant William Murphy is Chief of the Highway Patrol \nand exercises supervision and control over its members. The chain of command within the \nHighway Patrol is: captain, lieutenant, sergeant, and patrolman. \nDuring the period covered by the evidence, Anthony DeFazio was a police officer of the City \nof Philadelphia, having been appointed on December 28, 1965. He served as a member of \nthe Highway Patrol. Shortly before the conclusion of the hearings in these cases, he was \nretired on disability, and is no longer an active policeman. \nJohn D'Amico is a Philadelphia police officer, a member of the Highway Patrol, having been \nappointed to the Department on June 26, 1967. \nB. Existing Complaint Procedures \nAs a general practice, no record is made by the Police Department of any civilian \ncomplaints, unless submitted in writing. There are no forms available to citizens for filing \nsuch complaints. When a written complaint is filed, it is supposed to be recorded by the \npolice on a \"complaint and incident report\" form (No. 75-48); but the general practice at the \ndistrict level is not to record such complaints. \nWhen a complaint has been recorded, an investigation is made by Police Department \ninspectors assigned to Staff Inspection Headquarters. The investigation includes obtaining a \nstatement of the complainant and the officers involved. The Police Department controls the \ninvestigation and does not assist the complainant in obtaining witnesses. 1293*1293 The \ntendency is to minimize, and seek avoidance or withdrawal of complaints. \nPolice officers accused of misconduct do not submit to interviews or give statements \nrelating to the charges to anyone other than the police investigators. \nPolice officers accused of misconduct never submit to polygraph tests. While there is no \ndepartmental regulation on the subject, the Fraternal Order of Police has a fixed policy of \nrefusing to lend its support or provide counsel for any police officer who submits to a \npolygraph test, and this policy is well-known to the Police Department. In consequence, as \nabove stated, police do not submit to such examination. Nevertheless, complainants against \npolice officers are frequently requested to, and do, submit to polygraph examinations, \nunaware that the accused officer will not be so examined. No records are kept of the \nmanner in which the polygraph test is administered; only a result is noted. \nWhen an officer is under investigation, his personnel file is usually examined. \nCommendations from the Commissioner and commendatory letters from citizens are always \nplaced in an officer's personnel file. Letters of complaint are not. If an officer has been \nbrought before a police board of inquiry, that fact is noted in his personnel file. If there are \nseveral such instances, some further investigation as to the basis for the previous board of \ninquiry contacts is usually made. \n\nThe investigators prepare a report for the Police Commissioner. Previous incidents of \nalleged misconduct are not mentioned in the report, unless there are several of them and \nthey have been investigated. \nThe Commissioner decides, in his sole discretion, whether an officer should face trial before \nthe Police Board of Inquiry for a violation of the Police Department Disciplinary Code. It is \ngenerally believed within the Department that the Commissioner refers cases to a board of \ninquiry for trial only if he is already convinced that the accused officer is guilty and should be \ndisciplined. \nA board of inquiry consists of three police officers. The complaint is presented by a police \n\"advocate\" at a trial-type hearing. Upon a finding of guilty, penalties (reprimand, suspension \nor dismissal) are recommended to the Commissioner. The final decision with respect to \nimposition of penalties rests with the Commissioner. Dismissals are reviewable by the \nPhiladelphia Civil Service Commission. \nCounsel for the complainant (other than the \"police advocate\") is not permitted to participate \nin the hearing before the Board of Inquiry. Accused police officers are represented by \ncounsel. \nThe entire departmental disciplinary procedure is directed primarily to violation of \ndepartmental rules and regulations, rather than to alleged violations of legal or constitutional \nrights of civilians. \nFor the most part, a civilian complainant against a police officer is not informed of the final \ndisposition of his complaint. \nC. Commission on Human Relations \nThe Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations is an independent commission \nestablished by ยง 3-100(e) of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter. Its powers and duties are \nto \". . . enforce all statutes and ordinances prohibiting discrimination against persons \nbecause of race, color, religion or national origin . . .\" and to \". . . conduct educational \nprograms to promote the equal rights and opportunities of all persons regardless of their \nrace, color, religion or national origin\" (Charter ยง 4-700). \nThe Commission receives complaints from citizens alleging misconduct by the Philadelphia \nPolice, but the Commission has no investigatory or enforcement powers with respect to \nsuch complaints. \nUntil mid-1969, the Commission would forward such complaints to the Police Department, \nthe Department would investigate 1294*1294 and report the results of its investigation to the \nCommission; and the Commission would advise the complainant of these results. Beginning \nin mid-1969, the Police Department terminated its practice of providing the Commission with \na report of the investigation; instead, a summary was provided. The Commission thereupon \nterminated its practice of handling citizen complaints against police. Instead, it directs \n\ncomplainants to other agencies, such as Philadelphians for Equal Justice, Community Legal \nServices, the American Civil Liberties Union, or the District Attorney's office. \nD. Police Advisory Board of Philadelphia \nThe Police Advisory Board of Philadelphia was an agency established in 1958 by the then \nMayor of Philadelphia, to hear complaints by citizens against Philadelphia police involving \nalleged violations of constitutional rights or other mistreatment. The Board then made \nrecommendation to the Mayor in each case. \nIn March of 1967, the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia enjoined the Board from \nfurther functioning, and the Board became inactive. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania \nreversed the lower court decision in June of 1969. On December 22, 1969, the Board was \ndissolved by Mayor Tate. During the period of its operations, the Board had no investigative \nresources, and relied primarily on the investigations made by the Police Department. \nBecause of uncertainty as to whether the Board had subpoena power, it never attempted to \nexercise such power. \nE. Criminal Prosecution of Police Through District \nAttorney's Office \nThe District Attorney is responsible for the prosecution of all persons charged with crimes, \nas defined by local and state law, within the City of Philadelphia. The Community Rights \nDivision of the District Attorney's office is responsible for prosecuting police officers charged \nwith having committed crimes against citizens. \nComplaints received by the District Attorney's office are sent to the Police Department for \ninvestigation. A report is returned to the District Attorney, who then decides whether or not \nto prosecute. \nIn many cases where a complaint is made against a police officer, criminal charges arising \nout of the same incident are pending against the complainant. The District Attorney also has \nresponsibility for prosecuting the complainant. In many cases, the same Assistant District \nAttorney may be responsible for some aspects of both prosecutions. \nProsecutions of police officers do not occur unless serious physical injury has been \nsustained by a citizen as a result of police action. Often, complaints against police are \ndropped in exchange for a dismissal of criminal charges against the complainant. \nThe District Attorney's office does not ordinarily communicate to the claimants its decision \nnot to prosecute the police officer. \nF. Goode Case \nThe plaintiffs in this case are black citizens of Philadelphia who claim that their \nconstitutional rights have been infringed by the conduct of Philadelphia police; they bring \n\ntheir action on behalf of themselves and all other citizens of Philadelphia whose \nconstitutional rights have been or are likely to be thus infringed. \nI make the following findings of fact concerning the specific instances alleged: \n1. Roy Lee Shaw. On March 10, 1969, Roy Lee Shaw, a 16-year old black male, was \narrested and charged with assault and battery on a police officer, resisting arrest and \ndisorderly conduct. \nOn that date, at about 2 p. m., Shaw walked out of a store located at the corner of 11th and \nSomerset Streets. Officer DeFazio of the Highway Patrol, who was patroling the area in an \nunmarked 1295*1295 car, observed Shaw. He drove around the block, proceeded south on \n11th Street (a one-way streeet for northbound traffic), parked his car adjacent to where \nShaw was walking, got out of his car and told Shaw to stop. Shaw turned and asked why he \nwas being stopped, whereupon DeFazio struck him on the head with a blackjack. Shaw \nthen struck DeFazio on the chin, and ran north on 11th Street. DeFazio drew his service \nrevolver and fired a shot in the general direction in which Shaw was running. Shaw then \nstopped, DeFazio placed one handcuff on him, and pulled him, struggling, back to the police \ncar. DeFazio shoved Shaw into the car and called for additional police help. Shaw was lying \nface down on the back seat of the police car, still struggling, and DeFazio then struck him \nwith his nightstick. Two other officers arrived on the scene, and additional blows were \nstruck, until they succeeded in placing both handcuffs on Shaw and placing him in a police \nwagon. \nA crowd, mostly blacks, was attracted to the scene by the commotion. As the officers left, \nDeFazio made various racially derogatory remarks to the crowd. \nShaw was transported to the headquarters of the 25th Police District, where he was again \nstruck by police nightsticks. His mother attempted to visit him, but was not permitted to see \nhim while he was at the district office. \nEventually, Shaw was transported to Episcopal Hospital and received medical treatment. A \ncut on his head required four stitches. After receiving medical treatment, Shaw was taken \nback to the 25th Police District and held for approximately two more hours, whereupon he \nwas released in the custody of his mother. \nOn June 11, 1969, Shaw was initially adjudicated delinquent in Juvenile Court proceedings, \nbut was released without probation. The next day, the disposition of the case was changed \nto \"discharge as to offense.\" \nThere was no basis for stopping Shaw in the first place, there was no probable cause to \narrest him, and his arrest was illegal. He did not assault DeFazio, nor was he guilty of \ndisorderly conduct; he merely made minimal efforts to defend himself and to protest the \nviolation of his rights. \nNeither Shaw nor any member of his family made any complaint to the Police Department \nor any other City official concerning this matter. Shaw did bring the matter to the attention of \nCommunity Legal Services; a staff attorney of that organization wrote to the Community \n\nRelations Service of the United States Department of Justice describing the incident, but \nreceived no reply. \n2. Gerald G. Goode. On December 1, 1969, at about 11 o'clock p. m. or midnight, Gerald G. \nGoode, a 25-year old black graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, six feet one \ninch tall and weighing approximately 200 pounds, was a passenger in an automobile driven \nby Mrs. Ruth Rotko, a white woman, the wife of an Assistant District Attorney of \nPhiladelphia. They were proceeding north on Broad Street. Mr. Goode was sitting in the \nright rear seat and was the only passenger. \nNear the intersection of Broad Street and Erie Avenue, while their car was stopped for a \ntraffic light, Mr. Goode noticed police officers DeFazio and D'Amico frisking a black man \nnearby. Mr. Goode rolled down the car window and called to the officers that they had no \nright to do what they were doing, and that they should leave the man alone. At that time, the \nofficers were approximately 25 feet away from the car, and within hearing range of Mr. \nGoode's remarks. Mr. Goode did not use profanity or make any personally derogatory \nremarks. \nThe traffic light then turned green, and the Rotko car proceeded north for several blocks, \nuntil overtaken and stopped by D'Amico and DeFazio, who gave chase in an unmarked \npolice car. Both officers proceeded to the passenger side of the Rotko car, and one of \nthem 1296*1296 called to Mrs. Rotko to produce her identification cards. DeFazio ordered \nGoode to get out of the car. When Goode did not promptly comply, DeFazio opened the \nunlocked front door of the car, reached through and unlocked the rear door, and opened it. \nHe struck Goode on the knee with a blackjack and yanked him out of the car by his coat. \nThe officers then turned Goode around against the car and patted him down. \nGoode demanded to know why he was being subjected to this treatment, but received no \nreply. The officers attempted to place handcuffs on him, and he swung his arms in an \nattempt to avoid the handcuffs. \nAs Goode was being pulled from the car and turned around, he stepped on the foot or \nbumped the leg of Officer D'Amico. \nAfter being frisked, Goode turned and again asked for an explanation for the police action, \nwhereupon Officer DeFazio struck him across the cheek and mouth with a blackjack, cutting \nhis lip. Angered by this treatment, Goode told the officers to \"get your fucking hands off me\". \nAfter handcuffing Mr. Goode and placing him in the police car, the officers returned to the \nRotko car and asked Mrs. Rotko for her driver's license and registration card. Officer \nD'Amico searched the back seat and rear interior portion of the car. Both officers inquired of \nMrs. Rotko as to the basis of her acquaintanceship with Mr. Goode. Mrs. Rotko was given a \nticket for failing to have her driver's license in her possession, and there was some \nsuggestion that they might arrest her too. \nIn explanation of their arrest of Mr. Goode, Officer D'Amico stated \"you can't use profanity \nwith an officer.\" \n\nMr. Goode was taken to a police station and detained in a cell for approximately two hours. \nHe was then taken to Episcopal Hospital, where he received several stitches in his lip and a \ntetanus shot. He was then returned to the police station and, at approximately 5 a. m., was \ntaken to the Police Administration Building at 8th and Race Streets, where he was \nfingerprinted and photographed. At approximately 9 a. m. the next day he was brought \nbefore a magistrate on charges of assault and battery on an officer, resisting arrest, and \nbreach of the peace, and was released on nominal bail. On February 11, 1970, all charges \nagainst Mr. Goode were dismissed, upon the joint motion of the Commonwealth and Mr. \nGoode's attorney. \nThe Police Department conducted an investigation into the conduct of D'Amico and \nDeFazio in this matter; the investigation was under the supervision of staff inspectors \nDitmer and Fragassi. \nStatements were taken from the persons directly involved and from five witnesses, and a \nreport summarizing the statements was compiled. The personnel records of the officers \nwere checked. DeFazio's personnel record at that time showed one previous suspension \nand two appearances before the Police Board of Inquiry. No further check into the \nbackgrounds of the officers was made, nor was DeFazio's prior record referred to in the \nreport. \nThe statements obtained by the investigating inspectors were essentially in accord with the \nfacts set forth above. The statements of Officers D'Amico and DeFazio (neither of whom \ntestified in the present case) asserted that Goode had used profanity in his initial comments \nto them and that he was unruly and boisterous after they stopped his car. \nThe inspectors expressed the conclusion that Mr. Goode's initial comments to the officers \nconstituted probable cause for his arrest; that only reasonable force was used; that the \nofficers were not unduly rude to Mrs. Rotko; and that, in summary, there was no basis for \ndisciplinary action against either officer. \nIn finding that there was probable cause for the arrest of Mr. Goode, the inspectors adopted \nthe interesting reasoning 1297*1297 that Mr. Goode's initial comments must have created \nprobable cause for his arrest, otherwise the officers would not have pursued the Rotko car \nso vigorously. \nOn the basis of the undisputed and admitted facts, it is entirely clear that there was no \nprobable cause for arresting Mr. Goode, and that the conduct of the police was in flagrant \nviolation of the law and the Constitution. \n3. The Ballow Incident. On June 20, 1970, at approximately 7:45 p. m., Officers Frederick \nMoorse and John D'Amico observed a black male operating a motorcycle which did not \nhave registration plates. The man refused to stop at their request, whereupon they gave \nchase in their police car. Eventually, the man fell off the motorcycle, and escaped on foot, \nthe officers in pursuit. \n\nThe officers concluded that the person sought had entered a house at 2337 N Howard \nStreet. As the officers arrived at that address, a crowd of approximately 20 people, mostly \nblack, gathered in the street. \nJuanita Ballow and one Carlos Edney resided at that address. Plaintiffs' testimony was to \nthe effect that Officer D'Amico ran into the house, passed Miss Ballow, went up to the \nsecond floor, came back downstairs and then told Miss Ballow that he was chasing \nsomeone. The defense version was that the two officers stopped at the door of the house, \nwhere they were confronted by Miss Ballow and Mr. Edney. For present purposes, this \ndiscrepancy need not be resolved. \nIt appears to be undisputed that, when Miss Ballow and Mr. Edney demanded to know what \nthe police wanted, Officer D'Amico drew his service revolver and threatened to shoot Miss \nBallow. Officer Moorse summoned assistance, and an additional police officer arrived. \nD'Amico broke the glass in the front door of the house with his nightstick, and the three \nofficers entered the house. Mr. Edney was standing inside in the hallway, with a wrench in \nhis hand. After a brief discussion with Officer D'Amico as to the officers' purpose, a scuffle \nensued. When D'Amico again threatened to use his revolver, Edney escaped out the back \ndoor. \nThe officers searched the upper floors of the house, but did not find the man they were \noriginally looking for. The officers emerged from the front of the house, and Carlos Edney, \nwho had come around from the back of the house, again asked what they were doing, and \nmade a derogatory remark to D'Amico. D'Amico pushed Edney against a parked car and \nhandcuffed him. \nAs Carlos Edney was being handcuffed, his brother, Frederick Edney, arrived on the scene, \nran up to D'Amico and asked him what Carlos was being arrested for. Allegedly because \nFrederick seemed to be reaching into his pocket as if to draw something from it, the officers \nphysically restrained him and handcuffed him as well. Frederick Edney had no weapon or \nanything else in his pocket. Both of the Edneys were taken into custody. On July 31, 1970, \nFrederick Edney was convicted in Municipal Court on a charge of interfering with a police \nofficer. \n4. Herbert Brown Incident. On December 1, 1969, at about 12:30 a. m., Herbert Brown and \nWesley Joiner, two black men, were walking along Atlantic Street near its intersection with \nOld York Road. There were automobiles parked along Atlantic Street near where they were \nwalking, and they were carrying a flashlight. \nOfficers DeFazio and D'Amico, who were patrolling the area in an unmarked car, stopped \nthe two men and pushed them up against a wall. Brown and Joiner were discovered to be \ncarrying a pair of pliers and a screwdriver, as well as a flashlight. DeFazio stated to Brown, \n\"Got you now, nigger,\" and accused him of attempting to steal a car battery. When Brown \nattempted to explain that his own disabled vehicle was parked about a block away, with two \ngirlfriends in it; and that he was looking 1298*1298 for a piece of wire with which to attempt to \nstart his car, DeFazio struck him in the face with his hand. \n\nThe two men were handcuffed, placed in the police car, and taken to the police station. \nTheir request for permission to inform their waiting female companions, and to give them \ncarfare so that they could get home, was denied. When Brown complained that his \nhandcuffs were too tight, DeFazio again used racially derogatory terms and did not loosen \nthe handcuffs until they arrived at the police station. Charges of attempted larceny against \nBrown and Joiner were ultimately dismissed, for lack of a prosecuting witness. \nGiving the police the benefit of the doubt, I shall assume for present purposes that the two \nmen were, or reasonably appeared to be, attempting to steal a battery. But this would not, \nof course, justify the racial slurs, the rough treatment, or the disregard of the plight of their \nstranded female companions. \n5. Bernard Sisco Incident. On October 31, 1969, at about 9:30 p. m., police patroling in the \n16th District were notified by radio that a rape had occurred in the area of 37th and Wallace \nStreets. Shortly thereafter, approximately six officers arrived at the scene. The complaining \nwitness stated that she had been raped by several males, and that she knew that one of \nthem was blind and lived at 3620 Wallace Street, a short distance away. \nBernard Sisco, a blind 20-year old black male, resided at the address stated. Officers \nDeFazio, Carroll and Brown proceeded to that address, and, without standing on ceremony, \nopened the door and entered the house, announcing simultaneously that they were police \nofficers. Bernard Sisco opened the vestibule door from the inside and stood there, with an \nopen knife in his hand. The police officers heard the victim of the rape, who had \naccompanied them, say something to the effect that Sisco was one of the rapists. \nThe police ordered Sisco to drop his knife, and he did so, whereupon the police wrestled \nhim to the floor. Lieutenant Taylor and Lieutenant McGaughrin came up onto the porch to \nhelp subdue Sisco. After a struggle, the officers succeeded in handcuffing Sisco, and pulled \nhim out of his house and into the street. While they were awaiting the arrival of a patrol \nwagon, Sisco spit on Officer Carroll, whereupon Officer Carroll lost control of his temper, \ngrabbed him by the collar, pushed him to the ground, and began beating him. A superior \nofficer ordered Carroll to go back to his police car, and he did so. \nWhen the officers were placing Sisco in the patrol wagon, he stumbled, whereupon Officer \nDeFazio pushed him violently into the wagon. \nSisco was taken to the West Detective Division Headquarters at 44th and Park-side, where \nhe remained for approximately four hours. He had been at the Detective Division \nHeadquarters for about two hours before his mother was permitted to see him for the first \ntime. She brought him a clean set of clothing, and observed that he was bleeding from his \nnose and mouth. \nThereafter, Sisco was taken to the Police Administration Building for processing. \nPhotographs, taken some time between 2:25 a. m. and 4:45 a. m., on November 1, 1969, \nreveal no visible signs of physical injury to his head, nor do they conclusively rule out the \npresence of injury. The medical records of the Philadelphia Detention Center, where Sisco \nwas held without bail pending preliminary hearing, do not reveal that he received any \n\ntreatment. He was kept in the prison hospital solely because of his blindness, and not for \nany other reason. \nAt a preliminary hearing on November 7, 1969, the rape charges were dismissed when the \nvictim was unable to identify Sisco positively as one of her assailants. He was, however, \nheld for court on charges of resisting arrest, assault and battery on an officer, and carrying a \nconcealed deadly weapon. \n1299*1299 After the preliminary hearing, a physician to whom Sisco was referred by his \nrehabilitation counsellor, examined him on November 11, 1969. The doctor found swelling \non the top of the head, and concluded that Sisco had suffered a cerebral concussion. \nThe evidence upon which the foregoing findings are based is sharply conflicting. According \nto Sisco, his sister, and his mother, Sisco never offered any resistance to the police, but \nwas nevertheless severely and monstrously abused, both at the scene of the arrest, and \nwhile in police custody thereafter. If their testimony were accepted at face value, the police \nacted with utter barbarity. If the testimony of the police and the victim of the alleged rape \nwere accepted as literally correct, Sisco was never struck at all by any of the police. Under \nthis version, any physical mistreatment of Sisco was self-inflicted, by reason of his rolling \naround on the ground and otherwise struggling against the handcuffs. \nGiven the fact that the police believed they were in \"hot pursuit,\" and the admitted \ncircumstances of their entry into the Sisco house and their initial observation of Sisco; and \ngiven the admitted fact that at least one officer became so angry that he had to be \nrestrained by his superior officer, I have no doubt that Sisco was struck, and that the officers \ndid not limit their use of force to the precise amount required to \"subdue\" a prisoner who \nwas, after all, both blind and handcuffed, and who had earlier relinquished his weapon when \nordered to do so. \nWhile I have concluded that the testimony of the complaining witnesses is undoubtedly \nexaggerated, I do not believe it is totally fictional. The exaggerations and embroidery sprang \nfrom a sincere and deeply held conviction that the conduct of the officers was totally \nunjustified. \nThe evidence was sharply in conflict as to whether the victim of the crime identified Sisco as \none of her assailants, before his arrest. I have accepted the defense testimony that she did. \nIt must be conceded, however, that the extent of her opportunity to make such an \nidentification before the initial scuffle is not altogether clear; and 10 days later she was \nunable to identify him at the preliminary hearing. \n6. Joseph Reas Incident. On the evening of May 2, 1969, Joseph Reas, a 16-year old white \nmale, was attending a carnival at Father Judge High School. At approximately 10 p. m., he \nand three other boys entered the school playground near the carnival area, and saw a girl \nwho was weeping and who had blood on her face. Police arrived at the scene and some of \nthe boys started to run away. Reas did not run. However, he was struck twice on the head \nwith a blackjack, fell to the ground, and was struck again on the back of the head. His head \nwas cut open, and he lost consciousness as he was being placed in a police wagon. \n\nOfficer DeFazio was one of several officers who arrested Reas and other teenagers on that \noccasion. \nReas was taken to Nazareth Hospital, where he regained consciousness and received \nseveral stitches to close his head wound. He remained in the hospital for two days. He was \ninitially charged with inciting to riot, but the charges were dropped while he was still in the \nhospital. \nThe boy's mother could obtain no information from the hospital as to what had occurred. \nThe next day she went to the 7th Police District Headquarters but no one there could give \nher any information as to the identity of the police officers involved, except that they were \nmembers of the Highway Patrol. \nIn some undisclosed fashion, Mrs. Reas was caused to believe that Officer DeFazio was \nprobably the one who had struck her son. She spoke to Captain Murphy, Commanding \nOfficer of the Highway Patrol, several times by telephone. She was discouraged from \nattempting to speak directly to Officer 1300*1300 DeFazio, but was advised that she had the \nright to press charges against him. \nMrs. Reas did not press charges against Officer DeFazio. Several months after the incident, \nDeFazio visited Mrs. Reas at her place of employment, and, among other things, told her: \n\"Highway patrolmen are known to be rough and tough, and I am a highway patrolman, and I \nam proud of it.\" \n7. Disciplinary Action. In none of the foregoing incidents was any disciplinary action taken \nagainst Officer DeFazio, D'Amico, or, so far as the record discloses, any of the other police \nofficers involved. In the following two instances, disciplinary action was taken against \nDeFazio: \n(a) Louise J. Reed. On October 3, 1967, Louise J. Reed, a black woman and the wife of a \nCommon Pleas judge, and Coleman Clark, a white man, were employed as teachers at the \nGeorge Washington Carver Elementary School, which is located in a predominately black \narea. \nOfficer DeFazio was patrolling the area in a police car. At about 4 p. m., Mr. Clark, who had \njust left a faculty meeting at the school, was driving his car nearby. Officer DeFazio stopped \nhim in front of the school; Mr. Clark did not know why he was being stopped, and DeFazio \ndid not tell him. A heated discussion followed. \nAt about that time, other faculty members were emerging from the school. Among other \nthings, DeFazio told Clark to shut up, and accused him of acting like \"the black pigs that live \naround here.\" Mrs. Reed remonstrated with DeFazio because of this remark, but was told to \nshut up. Mr. Clark rejoined the argument, and others became involved. At one point, \nDeFazio placed Clark under arrest, but the school principal intervened and restored calm. \nThe next day, 57 members of the faculty of the school complained in writing to DeFazio's \ncommanding officer, with copies to the Mayor and Police Commissioner. Ultimately, on \nNovember 8, 1967, DeFazio was tried by the Police Board of Inquiry on charges of using \n\nrude and insulting language, and conduct offensive to the public. Mr. Clark and DeFazio \nexchanged apologies. The Board found DeFazio guilty and recommended a two-day \nsuspension, with which the Police Commissioner concurred. Mr. Clark was informed of the \nBoard's decision. \n(b) Anti-Semitic Remarks. On the same date as the hearing referred to in the preceding \nparagraph, DeFazio was also tried by the Police Board of Inquiry on charges of \ninsubordination, neglect of duty and disobedience of orders. He was found guilty of having \nreferred to a member of the public as a \"Jew bastard\" in the presence of a Jewish police \nofficer; appearing at a court hearing in improper uniform, and refusing to submit a \nmemorandum to a superior officer. The Board of Inquiry recommended a 10-day \nsuspension; Police Commissioner Rizzo reduced this to three days' suspension. \nAs a result of the two incidents discussed above, DeFazio received a total suspension of \nfive days. However, this was \"served\" by deducting five days from his accrued vacation \ntime, and thus did not result in any actual pecuniary loss. \n8. Miscellaneous. There was a great deal of evidence concerning Officer DeFazio's off-duty \nconduct in his home neighborhood. This evidence, which is substantially uncontradicted, \nraises further serious questions about DeFazio's fitness for police work. However, since \nDeFazio is no longer on the force, no useful purpose would be served by detailing the \ncircumstances here. \nIt is clear that numerous oral complaints were received by DeFazio's superiors, relating to \nhis conduct both on and off duty, and that no written record of these complaints was made, \nand no action taken. These complaints had no appreciable effect upon DeFazio's official \nfitness ratings. \n G. COPPAR Case \n1301*1301\nThe Coalition of Organizations on Philadelphia Police Accountability and Responsibility \n(COPPAR) is an organization of some 32 constituent organizations with a common concern \nabout police conduct and police-citizen relations. The Co-Chairmen of the organization are \nMrs. Mary Rouse and Mr. Floyd Platton. The principal function of the organization is to \nreceive citizen complaints of police misconduct through its constituent organizations, and, \nwith the help of attorneys retained through these organizations, to bring the complaint to the \nattention of the Police Commissioner or other authorities in a position to remedy the conduct \nin question. Mrs. Rouse maintains an office at 124 W. Cumberland Street, Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania. \nCOPPAR, and the individual plaintiffs (all of who claim to have been the victims of \nunconstitutional police conduct), purport to bring this action on behalf of themselves and all \nothers in Philadelphia who are, or are likely to be, similarly mistreated. Additional plaintiffs \ninclude the Black Panther Party, a militant black organization; and the Young Lords Party, a \nmilitant organization of persons with Latin American ancestry. \n\nThe specific instances of alleged police misconduct are set forth in chronological order, in \nthe following findings: \n1. Charles Blackman. This incident evolved from an altercation between Charles Blackman, \na black male who resides at 1412 S. Fallon Street, and Officer Crawford McGerald, a black \npolice officer who was off duty at the time. \nMr. Blackman's house is apparently quite close to the street. In parking his car in front of the \nBlackman residence, McGerald apparently permitted the vehicle to come in contact with the \nhouse; at least, Mr. Blackman was convinced that he had done so. Blackman called the \npolice to report the incident, but the investigating officer, finding that McGerald's car was \nthen parked legally, and observing no damage, left the area. \nShortly thereafter, Blackman encountered McGerald and cursed at him because of the \nincident. McGerald pushed Blackman down in the street. Blackman struck McGerald a \nglancing blow on the side of his body with an ice pick which Blackman was carrying. \nThereupon McGerald pursued Blackman onto the porch of his house, drew his revolver and \nstruck Blackman on the side of the face with it. \nA patrol wagon, and the investigating officer referred to above, arrived at the scene. They \naccepted McGerald's version of the incident, took Blackman to a hospital and, after he \nrefused treatment, to the West Detective Division, where he was placed under arrest and \ncharged with aggravated assault and battery on a police officer. \nThis incident is of no significance in the present case. At most, it arguably demonstrates \nthat, in a case of a personal altercation between a civilian and an off-duty policeman, the \npolice are likely to side with their colleague. \n2. Robert Nicholas. Two Community Legal Services lawyers, engaged by a local community \norganization to represent two young men who had been arrested, were initially refused \npermission to see or talk to their clients. A high-ranking police officer, Inspector Shields, \nwas called to the station. He reiterated the view that it was the policy of the Police \nDepartment not to permit attorneys to talk to defendants unless they knew the names of \ntheir clients and had been retained by the clients' families, as distinguished from community \norganizations. The police made no attempt to verify the parents' wishes in the matter, \nalthough one or more of them was present in the vicinity. The police appeared to be \nsuspicious of the attorneys and antagonistic to the community organization which had \nengaged their services. \nThe defendants contend that the alleged police policy explained by \nInspector 1302*1302 Shields has since been discarded. I accept that representation. \n3. Raymond Ragland. On May 18, 1970, at about 11 p. m., Raymond Ragland, a black male \npharmacologist, was walking slowly on the sidewalk along Gowen Avenue near his home. \nThis is a racially mixed area. Ragland was neatly dressed. An unmarked police car, which \nhad been proceeding in the opposite direction, turned around a short distance up the street \nand came back towards Mr. Ragland. He looked at the car after it had completed this \nmaneuver. \n\nOfficers Rowe and Taylor, who were in the police car, stopped and asked Ragland if he was \nall right. They received no audible response. They then got out of the police car and asked \nfor identification. Ragland told them that he had none, although he did have a wallet on his \nperson. Ragland complained to the police about being stopped and asked for identification. \nThereafter, over the space of about 10 minutes, a spirited discussion ensued, during which \nthe officers continued to demand identification, and asked Ragland to take his right hand \nout of his pocket. Ragland continued to question their reason for stopping him, and told \nthem that if he was wanted for anything they should take him to a police station, otherwise \nthey should let him go. \nFinally, Officer Taylor reached for Ragland's right hand, and Ragland quickly pulled his \nhand out of his pocket. The officers then told Ragland he was under arrest, but did not say \nwhat for. \nRagland was then frisked. The officers pulled his arms behind his back for the purpose of \nhandcuffing him. Ragland pulled his left arm away. One officer thereupon told him that he \nwould \"twist your black arm off.\" Officer Taylor struck Ragland on the arms, spine and \nknuckles with his nightstick, and also jabbed him in the stomach with the stick. Ragland was \nhandcuffed, and taken in a patrol wagon to the 14th District Station, where he produced his \nidentification. He was told that he was being held \"for investigation.\" \nThereafter, Ragland was taken to Northwest Detective Headquarters, about three miles \naway. He was asked his name, address and occupation, and asked what organizations he \nbelonged to. He was also requested to make a statement. Ragland identified himself, but \nrefused to make any further statement. He was then told by a detective that he was being \ncharged with assault and battery on an officer, resisting arrest, and disturbing the peace. \nAbout an hour later, Ragland was transported to the Police Administration Building. He was \ngiven a preliminary hearing, and was released on his own recognizance at about 5 a. m. \nSeveral weeks later the charges were dismissed at a further hearing. \nRagland wrote a letter of complaint to the Police Commissioner. The latter responded, \nadvising that the complaint was being referred to the Highway Patrol. Several weeks later, a \nrepresentative of the Highway Patrol informed some of Ragland's fellow employees that \nnothing would be done with respect to the complaint. Ragland also gave a statement to the \nFBI concerning the incident, but never heard further from that agency. \nSeveral months later, a staff inspector of the Police Department requested Ragland to \nprovide a written statement of the incident, and Ragland complied. Three months later, \nhaving heard nothing further about the matter, Ragland's attorney telephoned Inspector \nKopsitz, and was then advised that no action would be taken. Except for this conversation, \nRagland has never received any information from the Police Department concerning the \ndisposition of his complaint. \n4. Howard Schwartz. On May 23, 1970, shortly after midnight, a black male teenager \nsnatched a set of car keys from a woman who had just parked her car near Rodney Street \nand Mt. Airy Avenue. The boy and three companions 1303*1303 then fled the scene. Two \npolice officers observed this incident and gave chase, but the boys escaped. Thereupon, \n\nthe two officers, together with other officers who had been called to the scene, proceeded \nthrough the area and picked up approximately eight teenage boys and brought them back to \nthe scene for possible identification by the victim. She did not identify any of the boys, and \nonly one of the boys was believed by the police to resemble the youth they had earlier seen \nfleeing. \nWhen one of the boys resisted the officers' efforts to have him confront the victim, Officer \nDuross pulled him from the police car and struck him in the face with his fist. All of the eight \nboys were taken away from the scene in police cars. Notwithstanding the victim's inability to \nidentify her assailants, the two boys who had been apprehended by Officer Duross were \ntaken to 14th District Headquarters. They were held until 8:30 a.m., when they were \ninterviewed by a juvenile aid officer. They were charged with robbery, and subsequently \nreleased in the custody of their parents. \nOne Howard Schwartz, a disinterested witness who resided nearby, observed the police \nconducting the on-the-spot confrontations. He was disturbed by what he regarded as \nimproper police conduct, and reported the incident to Mrs. Rouse of COPPAR. However, he \nmade no complaint to police officials, because he felt it would be pointless. \n5. Kenneth Lassiter. On June 6, 1970, at about 7 a.m., Kenneth Lassiter, a 16-year old \nblack male, at the request of his mother, was loading some packages into a car in front of \nhis home at 6th and Green Streets. He was dressed in a T-shirt, dungarees, and sneakers \nwith no socks. \nDetective McCaron was patrolling the area in an unmarked police car. Among other things, \nhe was investigating a rape which had taken place at a nearby school the previous week. \nHe had been furnished a description and a composite sketch of the alleged rapist. He \nconcluded that Kenneth Lassiter resembled the suspect. \nThe officer approached Lassiter and ascertained his name, age and address, and told \nLassiter that he was being taken into police custody for investigation in connection with \nsome streetcar robberies. \nLassiter did not object to accompanying the officer. The officer made no attempt to inform \nthe boy's family of the situation, until Lassiter's mother, who had observed the incident from \ninside the house, came out to protest. \nThe officer told her that Kenneth was being taken to the Central Detective Division, and he \nwas in fact transported there in a patrol wagon. \nAlthough the police apparently did not consider that Kenneth was under arrest, the fact is \nthat he was photographed, shown the composite sketch of the rapist and told the reason for \nthe investigation, warned of his right to remain silent and to have a lawyer, and questioned \nabout his school and social activities. At some point, he was requested to take a lie detector \ntest, and agreed to submit to this examination. \n\nIt is the policy of the Police Department, concurred in by the District Attorney's office, that \nany person 16 years of age or older may be submitted to a lie detector test, without \nnotification to or consent of his parents, if he consents. \nKenneth was taken to the Police Administration Building, and a polygraph test was \nadministered. As a result, the police concluded that Kenneth was innocent. One of the initial \nquestions asked of Kenneth during the test was, \"during the first 13 years of your life, do \nyou remember jerking off?\" \nKenneth was released at about noon on the day of his arrest. He had not been provided \nwith any food during his time in custody, and he was not provided with transportation home. \nImmediately after Kenneth was taken from his home by the police, his mother telephoned a \nrelative who worked for the Human Relations Commission. The latter 1304*1304 arrived at \nCentral Detective Division while Kenneth was still there, but was not permitted to see him. \nShe asked why he was being held, and was told that he was not under arrest, but was just \n\"under investigation.\" She asked that, in that case, he be released immediately; and she \nwas assured that Kenneth would be released in a few minutes. Instead, Kenneth was \nremoved to the Police Administration Building for the polygraph test, but the relative was not \ninformed of this until about 15 minutes later. She protested that he was too young for such a \ntest, but her protests were ignored. \nA written complaint in connection with this incident was made to the Police Commissioner. \nStaff inspectors interviewed Lieutenant McCaron, but no action was taken. \n5. Helen Peurifoy. On June 10, 1970, the police were required to deal with what was \napparently a potentially tense racial situation in Southwest Philadelphia (whether the \ntension was racial in origin, or stemmed from teenage gang disputes, is not altogether \nclear). Officers patrolling the area encountered a large group of persons, mostly blacks, in \nthe vicinity of 57th Street and Chester Avenue. Some children in the group were holding \nbottles. The officers proceeded to arrest some of these persons. \nMrs. Helen Peurifoy, a black woman, had been visiting friends nearby and came out to see \nwhat was happening. She questioned the police as to why the particular people were being \narrested, and urged the police to arrest some other persons who had escaped. She was \nimmediately placed under arrest for \"inciting to riot.\" She protested her arrest, and \nattempted to resist police efforts to handcuff her, by swinging her arms. \nOne Sergeant Simmons, Patrolman DiSalvatore, and two other police officers, subdued \nMrs. Peurifoy and succeeded in placing handcuffs upon her. She was pulled across the \nstreet and pushed into a patrol wagon, and transported to the district police station. \nUpon arrival at the police station, Mrs. Peurifoy did not willingly leave the patrol wagon, so \nshe was yanked out of the vehicle by Officer DiSalvatore, who also threatened her with his \nnightstick and called her a \"black bitch.\" \nInside the station, Mrs. Peurifoy requested a glass of water and some medication which she \nneeded, but this request was ignored. She was not permitted to make a telephone call. After \n\napproximately 45 minutes, she was again handcuffed and taken in a patrol wagon to West \nDetective Division Headquarters. \nDuring both of her trips in the patrol wagon, Mrs. Peurifoy was jostled extensively by the \nmotion of the vehicle; she is convinced to this day that the vehicles were intentionally \noperated in an erratic manner, swerving from side to side, stopping and starting suddenly, in \norder to increase her discomfort. \nAt West Detective Division Headquarters, Mr. Peurifoy was kept in a cell for about an hour, \nand again was denied water and medication. She was questioned by a detective as to what \nhad happened, and was not warned of her rights until after she has responded to his \nquestions. She complained to him of her illness and need for medication, and also about the \ntreatment which had been accorded her by the police. The detective then left the interview \nroom, and returned in about 15 minutes, informed Mrs. Peurifoy that she was being \ndischarged, and offered her a glass of water and the requested medication. She was then \nvisited by a staff inspector who offered to drop all charges against her if she would promise \nnot to file a complaint against the police officers. She was returned to the district police \nstation, where the officer in charge told her that he would write a note to the officer who had \nmistreated her. About three hours after her original arrest, Mrs. Peurifoy was released, and \nno charges were ever filed against her. \n1305*1305 6. Mary Blackwell. On July 23, 1970, at about 10 p.m., police were summoned to \nthe scene of a disturbance in the area of 24th and Moore Streets, where bottles and stones \nwere being thrown. There had been large-scale racial disturbances in that area in the past. \nAmong the other events of that evening, two police officers arriving at the 1700 block of \n24th Street observed two teenage boys, one white and one black, confronting each other in \nthe street, each with a belt wrapped around his hand. A crowd had gathered, and the \nofficers had difficulty reaching the boys. One of the officers, Sergeant Mangini, took the belt \naway from the white boy, and approached the black youth, one Vincent Blackwell, 17 years \nof age. As Blackwell backed away from the officer, Sergeant Mangini struck him on the arm \nwith his nightstick. Blackwell's 20-year-old sister attempted to intervene, and was jabbed in \nthe abdomen with the nightstick. \nBlackwell's mother, who had come down from her porch to try to get her boy back into the \nhouse, was nearby when this occurred. When the sergeant swung at her son, she grasped \nthe officer's shirt and tried to push him away. The officer struck her in the abdomen and \npushed her away from him. \nOther people gathered around, and the sergeant cleared the area by swinging his \nnightstick. All three Blackwells were placed under arrest and taken to a patrol wagon. No \none else was arrested on that occasion. \nMrs. Blackwell was dressed in a slip and blouse, and her daughter, who had been preparing \nfor bed, was wearing blue jeans and a pajama top. All three Blackwells were taken to South \nDetective Division Headquarters. The police did not inform Mrs. Blackwell of the nature of \nthe charges against her or her children. She was told that she did not have to make any \nstatement, however she did make a voluntary statement, and so did the children. \n\nWhile the Blackwells were being held in custody, the police were proceeding to investigate \nthe incident, by taking statements from residents in the area. All of the witnesses agreed \nthat Sergeant Mangini had not been attacked, and Sergeant Mangini had advised the \ndetectives that he had struck the Blackwells. All of these interviews were completed by 1:30 \na.m. \nAfter 1:30 a.m., the Blackwells were given food for the first time, and Mr. Blackwell, the \nhusband and father, was permitted to visit them and give them clothing. \nAt about 3 o'clock a.m., the three Blackwells were transported to the Police Administration \nBuilding, where they were fingerprinted and photographed. At about 4:30 p.m. on July 24, \nthey were arraigned, and were told for the first time that they were charged with assault and \nbattery on a police officer, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and inciting to riot. \nOn July 31, 1970, the Blackwells appeared at a preliminary hearing. The presiding \nmagistrate dismissed all charges, but emphatically told Mrs. Blackwell that if any charges \narising out of the arrests were brought against police officers, she would be rearrested and \nprosecuted. \n7. Jean Thomas. On August 11, 1970, at about 6:45 p.m., Officer Tullio Ioannucci was \nshutting off an open fire hydrant at 39th and Mt. Vernon Streets. Mrs. Jean Thomas, a black \nwoman, suggested to him that it would do no good to close the hydrant, because people \nwould simply open it again. The officer told her, in effect, not to bother him. The \nconversation became heated. The officer called Mrs. Thomas a nigger bitch, and she called \nhim a pig. Residents in the area began to gather about. \nThe officer advised Mrs. Thomas that he was going to arrest her for disorderly conduct, and \nproceeded to his nearby police car to call for a patrol wagon. Mrs. Thomas went into her \nhouse. \n1306*1306 Additional police officers and park guards arrived, in response to Officer \nIoannucci's call. He then attempted to enter Mrs. Thomas' house, but the doorway was \nblocked by her 17-year old daughter Cheryl. Two other children, James Thomas, 14, and \nBrenda Thomas, 18, also were at the door and told the police to stay away. Cheryl Thomas \nrefused to move out of the officer's way, and was arrested and placed in the patrol wagon. \nThe other two children tried to prevent this, and were also arrested and placed in the patrol \nwagon. Two officers then entered the house and conducted a thorough search, from \nbasement to attic, but did not find Mrs. Thomas. They then left and took the three children to \n16th District Headquarters. They were interviewed by a juvenile aid officer, but refused to \ngive information. Brenda was sent to West Detective Division headquarters to be treated as \nan adult offender; James and Cheryl were charged with disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, \nand assault and battery, and were taken to the Youth Study center and held overnight. The \nnext morning they were released, and all charges were dropped. \nA few days later, Brenda Thomas was released, having been found guilty of one of the \noffenses charged against her. Mrs. Thomas was never arrested or charged with any offense \narising out of this incident. \n\n8. Dennis Holland. On August 14, 1970, at about 2 p.m., a police officer observed Dennis \nHolland, a 25-year old black male, lying unconscious in a parking lot at 13th and Commerce \nStreets. He called for an emergency wagon, which transported Holland to Jefferson \nHospital. \nIn the emergency room, Holland regained consciousness, but did not respond sensibly to \nquestions asked of him, and proceeded to behave in a very erratic manner. He was \nthereupon placed under arrest and charged with disorderly conduct. Although police \nobtained his identification from his wallet, no member of his family was notified. He was \npromptly sentenced to 30 days in jail, in default of a $30 fine, and was taken to the House of \nCorrection. He continued to behave erratically, and was taken to the prison hospital. \nThroughout this entire series of events, Holland, who was a diabetic, had been suffering \nfrom a diabetic reaction, and was clearly not responsible for his actions. It was not until the \nfollowing day that his true condition became known, after which his relatives were \ncontacted, and he was released from prison that night. \nNo charge of actual police misconduct could properly be based upon this incident. The \npolice, the hospital staff, and the committing magistrate exhibited merely a regrettable lack \nof concern, and a willingness to jump to conclusions. \n9. Fernando WHITE. On August 15, 1970, at about 11:30 p.m., two highway patrolman got \nout of their police car in Germantown in order to investigate a person they believed to \nresemble a rape suspect. A group of persons were standing nearby. Upon completion of \ntheir investigation, the officers got back into their vehicle. A black youth, Fernando White, \nage 16 or 17, approached the vehicle on the passenger side, asked the officer for his name \nand badge number, and then spit upon him. The officers then emerged from the police car, \nsubdued and handcuffed White, after a brief struggle. \nWhite was taken to 14th District Headquarters, and a group of citizens followed him to that \noffice in order to protest his arrest. A police lieutenant spoke to this group, interviewed \nWhite, and decided to release him because he had no prior record, the incident was not \nserious, and White apologized to the officer. No charges were filed, and White was released \nat about 12:30 a.m. \n10. Adalberto Molinas. (This incident did not involve anything approaching misconduct by \nthe police, nor does it shed any light upon the issues in this litigation.) \n1307*1307 11. Raid on Black Panther Headquarters. On Saturday, August 29, 1970, two \npolice officers were shot, one of them fatally, while on duty at a police station. On August \n30, 1970, two more policemen were shot and wounded when they stopped a stolen car. \nThe Police Department apparently suspected that members of the Black Panther Party may \nhave been involved in these shootings. A convention, the Citizens Constitutional \nConvention, was scheduled to be held in Philadelphia on September 4, 1970; members of \nthe Black Panther Party were expected to attend that meeting. \n\nThe police planned massive raids on premises believed to be occupied by the Black \nPanther organization; the raids were carried out at about 6 a.m. on August 31, 1970. Raids \non premises at 3625 Wallace Street, 2935 Columbia Avenue, and 428 Queen Lane, were \nconducted simultaneously. \nThe raid on 3625 Wallace Street was conducted pursuant to a search warrant. Members of \nthe press were alerted in advance, and press photographers were present at the scene. \nInterpreting the evidence in the light most favorable to the police, it appears that \napproximately 20 police officers arrived at 3625 Wallace Street; that an inspector knocked \non the door and announced that he had a warrant to serve; and that thereafter some gun \nshots were fired from inside the building. The police fired about five rounds into the building, \nthen fired tear gas projectiles into the building. The occupants emerged, with their hands on \ntheir heads. Police spotlights illuminated the area. All of the occupants were lined up at \ngunpoint against a wall, and all except the one female present were required to disrobe \ncompletely. They were photographed in that condition, and the photographs received \nwidespread newspaper publicity. \nThe searches of the other premises were very vigorous and thorough. It does not appear \nwhether there were search warrants for the other properties (apparently, there was no \nsearch warrant for the Queen Lane property). The three buildings were totally ransacked by \nthe police. \nAs a result of the three raids, approximately 16 persons were arrested and charged with \nassault with intent to kill, violations of the Uniform Firearms Act, and conspiracy. All were \nheld without bail until 8 p.m., at which time bail was set in the amount of $100,000 each, by \na Common Pleas judge who, at the intervention of Police Commissioner Rizzo (now Mayor \nRizzo) went to the Police Administration Building for that purpose, superseding the regularly \nassigned magistrate. At the bail hearing, the judge refused to consider or apply the \nprescribed standards for fixing bail. On September 3, 1970, in the course of a hearing in this \nCourt on plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction directed, inter alia, to the bail issue, \nthe bail in each case was, with the consent of the District Attorney's office, reduced to \n$2,500. \nIn conjunction with these raids, Mr. Rizzo made various inflammatory outbursts, arguably \nracial in overtone, in the presence of newspaper reporters; these remarks were widely \npublished in the local press. \n12. 23rd and South Streets Incident. On August 30, 1970, at 5:45 p.m., a bus containing \napproximately 45 teenage males and 12 adults, all of whom were black, stopped near 27th \nand South Streets to pick up several black youths who were being pursued by a large group \nof white youths. Several passengers got off the bus, and fights erupted between whites and \nblacks; some of the participants were armed with sticks and bottles. A crowd, about evenly \ndivided between whites and blacks, congregated in the area. \nThere had been several racial confrontations in that area over a period of several weeks. \nThree police officers appeared on the scene and immediately attempted to disperse the \n\ncrowd and to 1308*1308 separate the blacks from the whites. The bus departed, with some \nof its occupants still on board; the remaining youths ran in all directions. \nA large group, containing approximately 50 persons, most of whom were black, proceeded \neast on South Street. One of the police officers was injured when he tripped over an \nexposed water pipe. Other police learned of this injury, and apparently were under the \nimpression that the police officer had been assaulted (it is agreed that he was not). \nAt 23rd and South Streets, two police officers halted the group mentioned above, and stood \nthem against a wall. Several patrol wagons and a bus load of policemen arrived at the \nscene, and some of the officers drew their guns. The persons halted were frisked, \nhandcuffed and placed in patrol wagons. A few youths who failed to halt were apprehended \nand brought back to the scene. \nAltogether, 29 persons were taken into custody. Two who had suffered injuries were taken \nto a hospital; the remaining 27 (10 juveniles and 17 adults) were taken to the 17th District \nHeadquarters. One youth was returned to the scene in an attempt to identify white persons \ninvolved in the incident, but no such identification occurred. \nAfter about an hour at the 17th District Headquarters, the arrestees were taken to the Police \nAdministration Building, where all were photographed and fingerprinted, and held in a cell \nroom. \nDetectives proceeded to interview the arrestees, in groups of five. The first five interviews \nwere completed at about 8 p.m., by which time the police had learned from other sources \nthat the injured officer had not been assaulted, but had sustained his injury by tripping and \nfalling. At about 8 p.m., a representative of the Human Relations Commission telephoned \nthe Police Administration Building to inquire about the situation. \nNevertheless, the interviews continued. A record check was run on each of the arrestees, \nand statements were taken from each. \nBy 9 p. m., the police had determined that no charges would be brought against any of the \npersons arrested. But the interviews continued. Ultimately, at about 11:30 p. m., the \narrestees were taken back to the 17th District, where a representative of the Human \nRelations Commission had arranged to have them picked up by relatives. \nThe police did not consider that any of these individuals was arrested on this occasion. The \nonly information given to the arrestees was that they were being held in custody to get them \noff the street. \nNo whites were arrested or detained in connection with this incident. The procedures \nactually followed by the police were totally inconsistent with the explanation ultimately \noffered, namely, that the police were attempting to protect the blacks arrested. \nWhile the evidence does not justify the conclusion that the police were unwilling to \nprosecute the whites involved in these skirmishes, (some attempt was made to identify \n\npossible white culprits), the fact remains that blacks were taken into custody \"for \ninvestigation\", whereas the whites were not. \n13. Wilfredo Rojas. On August 31, 1970, at about 11:30 a. m., police Officers Oliver and \nBrooks received word that two men had been stripping automobiles, and had been seen \nrunning west on American Street; and that one of the men was wearing a blue shirt. The \nofficers observed Wilfredo Rojas, an 18-year old Puerto Rican male, and a companion, \nwalking along Dauphin Street near American. The two youths stopped to converse with two \nindividuals seated in a parked Volkswagen automobile. \nBecause Rojas and his friend had blue shirts on, the officers stopped to question them. \nThereafter, one of the officers concluded that a female seated in the Volkswagen bore some \nphysical resemblance 1309*1309 to a person whose photograph he had seen on an FBI \nwanted poster. \nThe officers radioed for instructions, and a supervisor appeared on the scene. He told them \nthat the alleged car strippers had already been arrested, and that Rojas and his friend were \nnot involved in that offense. Nevertheless, all four persons were taken into custody and \ntransported to East Detective Headquarters. Police records were checked, and the police \nsatisfied themselves that the girl was not the person wanted by the FBI. \nOne of the males was wearing the insignia of the Young Lords Party. The police questioned \nall of the males about their involvement with that organization, and about a homicide with \nwhich the police suspected that the Young Lords Party had some connection. No charges \nwere filed against any of these persons; all were released that day. \n14. Stop and Frisk Incidents of September 1, 1970. On September 1, 1970, at about 9:30 p. \nm., a group of 16 police officers stopped a group of approximately 30 black teenage boys in \nthe area of 48th Street and Fairmount Avenue. Some of the officers drew their guns, and \nthe boys were ordered to line up against a wall, where they were searched. Finding no \nweapons, the police released the boys. At no time did the police give any indication as to \nthe reason for their actions. \nAfter proceeding approximately one-half block farther along the street, the same boys were \nstopped again by a different group of policemen, and the same search procedure was \nrepeated. This time, the boys were ordered to leave the scene in different directions. \nOn the same evening, two police officers stopped another group of 10 or 15 black boys \nwalking along Waylusing Avenue near Lancaster Avenue. The boys were searched, and \nwere allowed to leave the area in groups of four or five. \nThe area in which these incidents occurred is known to the police as one in which juvenile \ngang activity flourishes. However, the boys who were stopped were not in fact involved in \ngang activities at the time. \n15. Ronald Crampton. On September 3, 1970, two police officers at the scene of a fire saw \na car go through a red light, at what they considered to be a high speed. They gave chase \nin their police car. The operator of the pursued vehicle, Ronald Crampton, was not aware of \n\nthe police presence, and did not immediately respond. Ultimately, he became aware of the \npolice officers and stopped his car. The police shined a spotlight on him, drew their \nweapons and ordered him out of the car. After frisking him, and being satisfied that he was \nunarmed, they gave him a ticket for going through the traffic light and for a defective muffler. \nMr. Crampton is convinced that he was not guilty of any infraction. He demanded a hearing \nin Traffic Court, but was fined even though neither officer appeared at the hearing. \n16. Johnson and Simon. On September 8, 1970, at about 10 p. m., two black high school \nstudents, John Stanley Johnson and Herbert Simon, were walking along Chew Avenue in \nGermantown, immediately in front of Johnson's residence. Johnson was swinging a closed \numbrella. \nOfficers Winchester and Kochik drove past the boys in an unmarked police car, and heard \nJohnson make some comment which they could not decipher. The police turned around and \nreturned to the scene. They demanded to know what Johnson had said, frisked both boys \nand asked for identification. The boys denied making any comment, and told the police that \nJohnson lived at the house in front of which they were standing. The boys did not give the \npolice their names, but Johnson handed the police his wallet, which contained his \nidentification. \nThe boys were placed in the police car and transported to 14th District Headquarters. \nHowever, before they left the scene, Johnson's grandmother came out of the house and \ninquired as to where 1310*1310 they were being taken. The police gave her no reply. \nWhile the boys were at the district headquarters, Simon complained that the police were \nbeing too rough with another individual whom they had apprehended. A black police officer \npushed Simon away, and, when Johnson attempted to see what was happening, he pushed \nJohnson away and struck him on the chin with his fist, stating that he did not like the boys' \nattitudes. \nThe boys were then locked in a cell. Johnson's mother arrived at the station, but was not \npermitted to talk to him. After about an hour, the boys, handcuffed together, were taken in a \npatrol wagon to another police station at 22nd Street and Hunting Park Avenue. The police \ndid not inform Johnson's mother of his whereabouts until about an hour after the boys had \nleft. \nAt the 22nd Street and Hunting Park Station, the boys were interrogated as to their previous \npolice contacts, and their organizational affiliation. At about 1:30 a. m., Johnson's mother \nwas permitted to see them for the first time. After warning the boys of their constitutional \nrights, the police formally charged Johnson with disorderly conduct and interfering with a \npolice officer. No charges were lodged against Simon. \nMrs. Johnson was permitted to talk to the officer who had struck her son; the officer \nmaintained that he had acted properly. \nBoth boys were released in the custody of Mrs. Johnson at about 4 a. m. on September 9, \n1970. Later in the day, Johnson and his mother were interviewed by a juvenile court officer. \n\nBecause they disputed the charge that Johnson had struck the policeman, the case was \nreferred to juvenile court. \n17. Alaberti and Whelan Incident. On the evening of September 17, 1970, a white male was \nseverely beaten by several black males, in the vicinity of 22nd and Pierce Streets, a racially \ntense area. Several police cars arrived at the scene, and the victim was taken to a hospital. \nMany residents of the area, all of whom were white, were congregating in the street, \naroused by the incident. The police told them to disperse, but some of the residents refused \nto leave the scene and were vocal in their criticisms of the police handling the matter. \nOne of the residents, Mrs. Alaberti, was pushed against a police car and struck with a \nnightstick. A 17-year old white youth, James Whelan, protested the treatment she was \nreceiving. Several other persons loudly criticized the police. All were arrested, and held in \ncustody at the 17th District Station for about an hour and a half. All were then released \nwithout charges. \nNone of the persons arrested made any complaints about the conduct of the police, \nbecause they were told by a ward committeeman who was present that any such \ncomplaints might result in criminal charges being placed against them. \n18. Fred Brooks Incident. Two police officers stopped a 22-year old black male who was \nwalking near his home at about 2 o'clock a. m. He could not produce any verification of his \nidentity, but one of the officers recognized him as a resident of the neighborhood. They \nmade a note of his name and age, and, apparently, detained him briefly while they checked \nsome nearby parked cars for possible signs of criminal activity. \nUnder the circumstances, I am satisfied that the police acted reasonably in all respects on \nthis occasion. \n19. Locke and Perry. On September 20, 1970, at about 8:30 a. m., Officer Dennis Kirby was \nvisually inspecting the interior of an automobile parked in the 2500 block of Mascher Street \n(his explanation is that he believed the car might be stolen). However, (a) he had no \ninformation to that effect and made no attempt to learn whether it had been reported stolen; \nand (b) the age and physical condition of the vehicle would seem to have made it an \nunlikely candidate for theft. \nAs the officer was withdrawing from the automobile, he was struck by some 1311*1311 water \nthrown from a third floor window of the adjacent house. The officer testified that he saw \nOliver Locke throw the water. Oliver Locke, who resided at the house, denies having thrown \nthe water. For present purposes, I shall assume that Locke did in fact throw water on the \npolice officer. \nA heated verbal exchange followed, in the course of which Locke told the officer to stay \naway from the car (which was Locke's car) unless he had a warrant. \nOfficer Kirby radioed for assistance, and Lieutenant Smith and several other patrolmen and \na patrol wagon arrived a few minutes later. Locke remained at the open third-floor window \n\nof his house, and made several derogatory remarks to the police, including calling them \n\"pigs.\" The police told him to come down to the door, that he was under arrest, and that if \nhe did not come to the door they would come in and get him. Locke again stated \"fuck you, \npigs.\" What followed can only be described as a rather complete loss of control on the part \nof the police. \nThe police broke open the door to the house, and three of them ran up the stairs. Locke's \nwife, five months pregnant and dressed only in a nightgown, was standing on the second-\nfloor landing. Lieutenant Smith pushed her out of the way and ran up to the third floor, \nwhere he seized Oliver Locke and pulled him down the stairs. Officer Kirby struck Locke on \nthe head with a blackjack, causing an open wound. \nAs Locke was being dragged down the stairs, Lieutenant Smith again pushed Mrs. Locke \naside. She followed them down the stairs, screaming, and the officers pushed her away and \nstruck her body with their nightsticks. She was dragged by the hair, and fell down several \nsteps. \nMr. Locke, still struggling, was pushed into a patrol wagon. His wife followed, protesting; \nshe called the officers \"pigs\" and attempted to strike one of them on the back with her fists. \nThe officers called her a pig as well, and pushed her into a patrol wagon. \nMr. and Mrs. Locke were taken to East Detective Division Headquarters, and locked in cells. \nIn the course of this proceeding, Mrs. Locke, by reason of her condition and scanty attire, \nwas the target of rude and offensive remarks from some of the policemen present. Mr. and \nMrs. Locke remained at East Detective Division Headquarters until that evening, when \nadditional clothing was obtained for Mrs. Locke, and both were taken to a hospital. Mr. \nLocke received five stitches for his head wound, Mrs. Locke was found to have a bruised \nfoot, but no other medical problems developed. \nAfter receiving hospital treatment, Mr. and Mrs. Locke were taken to the Police \nAdministration Building and charged with assault and battery on a police officer, disorderly \nconduct, resisting arrest, threats to do bodily harm, and breach of the peace. They were \nreleased on bail. \nThe house in which the Lockes resided was shared with another couple, Mr. and Mrs. \nWilliam Perry. On September 23 and 24, police, armed with a search warrant, appeared at \nthe house to search for drugs. The search was very thorough. The officers removed clothing \nfrom bureau drawers, and emptied sugar bowls and soap cartons in the course of the \nsearch. No drugs were found. The officers made no attempt to straighten up the disorder \ntheir search had caused. \nOn November 24, 1970, at 2 a. m., Mr. Perry was arrested in South Philadelphia and held in \npolice custody until 11 p. m. The police informed him that he was being arrested for \n\"conspiracy to commit terroristic vandalism,\" but no formal charges were ever filed against \nhim. \n20. Thomas Lodico. On September 24, 1970, shortly before 9 a. m., Thomas Lodico parked \nhis car near Bartlett Junior High School at 11th and Christian Streets, and proceeded to \n\ndistribute to students several copies of the \"Plain Dealer,\" an underground \nnewspaper. 1312*1312 Mr. Lodico was 23 years of age, white, and had long hair, a \nmustache and beard. Bartlett Junior High School is located in a predominately black \nneighborhood. \nThe newspaper which Lodico was distributing contained an article entitled \"Fuck the \nSchools,\" and included a rather illegible cartoon which, arguably, depicts someone stabbing \nor otherwise assaulting a police officer. The text of the newspaper article included many \nwords generally regarded as obscene. \nTwo police officers stopped Lodico and asked for a copy of the paper. Lodico gave them \none. The officers expressed the view that the newspaper was \"trash.\" The officers then \nsummoned their supervisor, a sergeant, to the scene. The officers searched the back part of \nLodico's car, where there was a pile of these newspapers. \nA group of about 20 adults and children gathered at the scene. The adults complained \nabout the paper which Lodico was distributing. \nThe officers thereupon handcuffed Lodico, placed him in the patrol wagon, and transported \nhim to a district station. About 15 minutes later, he was taken to South Detective Division \nHeadquarters, where he was photographed. Lodico requested a lawyer and stated that he \ndid not wish to make any statement; nevertheless, he was questioned by various detectives \nabout his associations with another underground newspaper. He was held in custody until \nabout 12:30 p. m., when he was released. No charges were filed. He was not fed during his \ntime in custody. During this same period, Lodico's automobile was taken by the police to the \nSouth Detective Division Headquarters, and was searched further. \n21. Joseph Sterling. On September 24, 1970, at about 9:15 a. m., Joseph Sterling, who also \nworked for the Plain Dealer newspaper, drove his automobile slowly through the \nintersection of 11th and Christian Streets, and parked at an angle, whereupon he got out of \nhis car and looked about in a confused manner. Mr. Sterling was white, 20 years old, and \nhad long hair, a mustache and a beard. \nA police officer (Rouse), who had observed Sterling's activities, stopped him and asked if \nanything was wrong. He noticed that Sterling's eyes seemed bloodshot, and that copies of \nthe Plain Dealer were in Sterling's automobile. Officer Rouse then took Sterling into \ncustody, and transported him to the district station, where Sterling was told that he was \nunder arrest for driving while under the influence of narcotics. He was taken to the Police \nAdministration Building in a patrol wagon, was fingerprinted and photographed, and \nvoluntarily took a balloon test. \nSterling was permitted to make a phone call. He told the officers that he did not wish to \nmake any statement until he had consulted a lawyer. Nevertheless, several detectives \nengaged him in a discussion involving his views on police activities and on the Vietnam war. \nHe was interrogated about his use of drugs. He was not fed during his time in custody. At \nabout 1 p. m., he was brought before a magistrate and was discharged. \n\n22. Mark Soto and Jerry Serrano. On September 25, 1970, at approximately 10 p. m., police \nofficer Charles Smith was called to the scene of a fist fight at Howard and York Streets. \nApproaching the area, he radioed for assistance. As the officer approached the scene, two \nmales who appeared to have been engaged in a fight with each other stopped fighting, \nwalked down York Street toward Hope Street, and again confronted each other as if to \nrenew the fight. Officer Smith followed, and restrained one of the men against a parked car. \nAt this point, two other males grabbed Smith's arms and struck him with their fists, and one \nattempted to grab his gun. All three civilians then ran away. \nA 15-year old black male, Mark Soto, was standing behind the officer; Smith apparently \nbelieved that he had been involved in the assault. Using the butt of his gun, Officer Smith \nstruck Soto. 1313*1313 Soto tried to run away, but Smith caught him and wrestled with him, \nstriking Soto again with his weapon. \nAt this point, two other police officers arrived on the scene. One of them struck Soto on the \nhead with his night stick, and Soto fell to the ground. Two officers then held Soto down. \nSoto continued to struggle and was kicked in the head by a police officer. \nA crowd gathered. Some were shouting derogatory remarks, others merely pleaded with the \nofficers to stop treating Soto so roughly. Bottles and bricks were thrown in the general \nvicinity. \nSoto was taken in a patrol wagon to 26th District Headquarters, and was then taken to \nEpiscopal Hospital where he received stitches for a head wound. He was then taken to 25th \nDistrict Headquarters and held over night. During this period, various police called him a \nPanther and a \"black nigger.\" \nIn the course of the foregoing incident, two other officers saw a Puerto Rican male throw a \nbottle in the direction of their police vehicle. The culprit disappeared down Waterloo Street. \nShortly thereafter, the officers apprehended Jerry Serrano, a Puerto Rican male age 16, \nbelieving him to be the person who threw the bottle at them. Two other officers appeared to \nassist in the arrest. Serrano struggled to escape. The officers struck him approximately six \ntimes on his back and arms with nightsticks, and called him a \"Spic.\" \nSerrano was taken first to one police station then to another. Ultimately, he was charged \nwith assault and battery and disorderly conduct. He was released to his father at 5 a. m. the \nfollowing day. Serrano has consistently denied that he was guilty of any offense on the \noccasion in question. \nA delegation headed by Mrs. Mary Rouse, of the COPPAR organization, went to the 26th \nDistrict Headquarters to protest the treatment of Mark Soto. She asked to speak to the \ncaptain, but he was not present and the officer in charge refused to communicate with him. \nMrs. Rouse then telephoned Lieutenant George Fencl, head of the Civil Disobedience \nSquad, and he and the district captain soon arrived. After speaking briefly with the \nprotesting group, these officers then sent for a staff inspector. Arriving a short time later, the \nstaff inspector met with representatives of the protesting group and recorded their \n\ncomplaints and promised a thorough investigation. However, neither the complainants nor \nthe district captain ever heard anything further about the investigation. \n23. Ellis Steward. On October 1, 1970, at about 3:30 p. m., Ellis Steward, a 52-year black \nman, was driving in his car and picked up three young individuals. Sergeant Komada, \npatroling in a police car, saw these persons get into Steward's car. One of them resembled \na person known to Sergeant Komada as a narcotics user, and Sergeant Komada had been \ninformed that a Negro male was selling narcotics in the area. Accordingly, Komada followed \nthe Steward vehicle. \nAt Germantown Avenue, the three passengers got out of the car. Shortly thereafter, Mr. \nSteward stopped his car in response to Sergeant Komada's signals. Komada asked Mr. \nSteward for his vehicle registration, and advised him that the persons who had just been in \nhis car were narcotics users. The first card Steward showed to Sergeant Komada was not \nhis vehicle registration. Steward was ordered out of his car, and complied, and was frisked. \nThis occurred in front of a factory from which workers were emerging at the change of \nshifts. Steward loudly objected to the police procedure, especially in front of a large number \nof people in an area where he was known. He informed the officer that he was physically \ndisabled. Sergeant Komada then arrested Steward for disorderly conduct. \nAt that point a second officer (Flint) arrived on the scene, and the two policemen proceeded \nto handcuff Mr. Steward. Steward objected to being handcuffed and swung his arms about \nto evade the 1314*1314 handcuffs, whereupon Officer Flint struck Steward on the shoulder \nand head with his blackjack. Steward and both officers fell to the ground in the scuffle. \nSteward was handcuffed and placed in a patrol wagon. Upon arrival at the 35th District \nHeadquarters, Steward seemed to be unable to walk. He lay on the floor for about a half \nhour, and then was taken to a hospital, where a physician examined him and concluded that \nhe was all right. He was then returned to the police station and formally charged with \ndisorderly conduct and resisting arrest. He was eventually released from custody at 3:30 a. \nm. the following morning. During his 12 hours in police custody, he was not fed. On October \n21, 1970, he was convicted of the above charges in Philadelphia Municipal Court. \n24. Albert Boccuto and Anthony Dignetti. On October 6, 1970, at about 6 p. m., a group of \nabout 20 boys, ranging in age from 15 to 21, were playing football in a school yard at 3600 \nNorth Randolph Street. During the preceding two-year period, the police had received many \ncomplaints from residents of the area and from the Board of Education to the effect that the \nschool building was being vandalized and that young persons were drinking and breaking \nbottles in the school yard at night. \nOfficer Wells, patrolling nearby, knew of these earlier complaints. He went to the school \nyard and told the boys to leave. \nOne of the youths, Albert Boccuto, age 17, Caucasian, did not immediately leave, and \nprotested the validity of the officer's order. The officer radioed for assistance. Boccuto used \nobscene language to the officer, and the officer then told him that he was under arrest. The \nofficer pushed Boccuto against a chain fence and held him by the hair to prevent his \nescape. Nearby residents gathered to witness the encounter. \n\nAnother white male, Anthony Dignetti, age 22, protested the officer's treatment of Boccuto. \nThe officer told him that he also was under arrest. Both youths were then handcuffed and \ntaken in a patrol wagon to the 25th District Headquarters. Other officers arriving on the \nscene dispersed the remaining crowd by waving their nightsticks. \nNeither Boccuto nor Dignetti was told by the arresting officer why they were supposed to \nleave the school yard, nor why they were arrested. Boccuto was charged by juvenile officers \nwith disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. He was held in a cell for several hours and then \nreleased. The charges were dismissed the next day. Dignetti was charged with disorderly \nconduct. He was held for three hours and then released; the charges were dismissed the \nnext day. \nDignetti testified that, while being held at the police district headquarters, he was punched \nseveral times by a guard. The guard flatly denied any such incident. In the absence of any \nclear basis for assessing the relative credibility of these witnesses, I have concluded that \nthe evidence on this point is evenly balanced, and therefore make no finding that Dignetti \nwas beaten. \nAbout a month before the above incident, on September 4, 1970, at about 9 p. m., Albert \nBoccuto and a companion, Sammy Fabrizzo, were stopped by two police officers in the \nvicinity of 5th and Annsbury Streets. The officers held the boys at gunpoint, frisked them, \nasked them where they were going and what they were doing, and then permitted the boys \nto leave. It appears that the police had received numerous complaints from residents in the \narea, concerning groups of teenagers congregating on street corners and causing \ndisturbances. The police response to these complaints was to disperse any crowds they \nsaw on street corners, and to arrest anyone who failed to comply, on charges of \"corner \nlounging\" or disorderly conduct. \n25. Dwight Redding Byrd. On October 12, 1970, at 1:15 p. m., Officers Winchester and \nByrne observed one Dwight Redding Byrd, a Negro male, 1315*1315 holding in his hand a \n20-inch sword, partially removed from its wooden sheath. Several other Negro males, one \nof whom had a large stick in his hand, were walking away from Byrd. \nWinchester approached Byrd, took the sword away from him, examined it, and advised Byrd \nthat he was under arrest. He then attempted to place handcuffs on Byrd. Byrd pulled away, \nand the sword fell to the ground. In the meantime, Officer Byrne had stopped the other \nNegro males, and, with gun drawn, required them to lean against a wall, frisked them, and \nasked their identification. \nAs Byrd continued to struggle with Officer Winchester, flailing his arms and kicking, the \nunsheathed sword lay on the pavement about four feet away. Officer Byrne came to his \nfellow officer's assistance; neither officer picked up the sword. \nAfter about a minute, Byrd picked up the sword and began to swing it over his head. The \nofficers were standing in the street about five feet away from Byrd, backing away from him. \nBoth officers drew their guns. \n\nByrd was speaking in a foreign tongue (possibly Arabic). He faced the officers, swinging the \nsword in front of his face. He stepped toward the officers, but did not point the sword at \nthem or lunge at them. \nThe officers told Byrd to drop the sword. They repeated this instruction three or four times. \nWhen he failed to comply after about 30 seconds, Officer Byrne fired into Byrd's chest, and \nWinchester fired into Byrd's leg. Byrd fell to the sidewalk; 20 minutes later he was removed \nfrom the scene; he was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. \nThe District Attorney later ruled that the killing of Dwight Byrd was justifiable homicide. \n26. Mr. and Mrs. Leon Brown, and Edward Smalley. On October 18, 1970, a Sunday, at \nabout 2:30 p. m., four police officers assigned to the narcotics unit acted unreasonably in \nconducting a search of the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Leon Brown, 3943 North 10th Street, \npursuant to a search warrant. \nFor present purposes, I shall assume, without deciding, that the search warrant was valid. \nThe four officers, none of whom was in uniform, all of whom were casually dressed, \nknocked on the door, displayed their badges to Mrs. Brown's sister, who was looking out \nthrough the door window, and demanded entry. Without waiting for a response, they broke \ndown the door, breaking it off its hinges. They then thoroughly ransacked the entire house. \nThree officers invaded Mrs. Brown's bedroom on the second floor; she had just arisen from \na nap, and was clad only in her underwear. She was ordered to remain standing as the \nofficers searched the bedroom. After some delay, she eventually was provided with a \nhousecoat. \nThe officers emptied out drawers and closets in all of the rooms in the house, and \noverturned mattresses. They did not inform Mr. and Mrs. Brown the purpose of the search, \nuntil it had been in progress for several minutes. They then advised the Browns that they \nwere looking for drugs, and checked the Browns' arms for signs of needle marks. \nThe police found no drugs, and left the premises after about a half hour. Before leaving, \nthey put back some of the items which they had dumped from bureau drawers, but the \npremises were in considerable disorder after the police left. The front door was not repaired. \nAt about the same time that the above search was taking place, a similar search was \nconducted at 2619 West Lehigh Avenue, in which an Afro boutique shop occupied by a \nfriend of the Browns, one Leonard Smalley, was located. Although the affidavit in support of \nthe alleged search warrant indicated that the warrant was directed at the boutique shop, the \nofficers searched the second and third floors of the building first, before proceeding to \nsearch the boutique shop. 1316*1316 No one was present in the building when the police \narrived. They broke the lock on the building door, searched upstairs, then broke the door to \nthe boutique shop off its hinges and searched the shop. \nNo drugs were found, the merchandise was disarranged, and some items were stolen. The \nentire search took about a half hour. \n\nMr. Smalley learned of the search of his shop when, on behalf of the Browns, he inquired at \nthe 22nd and Hunting Park Avenue Station as to the purpose of the search of the Brown \nresidence. After observing the damage to his store, he returned to the police station on two \nor three occasions and asked to see the search warrant. No such warrant has ever been \nshown to him. \n27. Mrs. Irene Thompson. On October 23, 1970, at about 4 p. m., an 11-year old Negro boy \nwas caught shoplifting at a Woolworth Store on Chester Avenue. When he refused to give \nhis name and address, the manager called the police. \nOfficer Leon Burke responded to the call. Holding the boy by his belt, he escorted him to the \nsidewalk. The boy then attempted to escape, and bit the officer on the finger. The officer \nlost his temper. He wrestled the boy to the sidewalk, fell on top of him, and repeatedly \nbanged his head against the pavement. A crowd gathered, and complained of the officer's \ntreatment of the boy. \nMrs. Irene Thompson, a black woman, reasonably well educated and responsible, observed \nthe officer's conduct. She had not known any of the persons involved previously. She was \nvery disturbed at the incident, and made several attempts to complain about Officer Burke's \nconduct, and to inquire about what had happened to the boy. \nThe police were reluctant to listen to her; she was not permitted to talk to Officer Burke, \neven though he was present in the station house. \nWhen Mrs. Thompson insisted that she wished to make a complaint, it was finally arranged \nthat one of the police officers would listen to her. However, as she was explaining the \nincident to him, he kept defending the conduct of Officer Burke. Mrs. Thompson was told to \nreturn to the police station the following Monday. She did so, but was told that no one knew \nanything about the matter. \nMrs. Thompson has never received any information from any police or city source \nconcerning her complaint, or concerning the boy who had been mistreated. \nH. Statistics \nAt the request of the Court, certain statistical information has been furnished by the \ndefendants. The period covered by these statistics runs from January 1, 1968 to July 1, \n1970. During that period, 2,339 persons were arrested and charged with assault and battery \non a police officer or resisting arrest. In 1,451 of these cases (62 percent), either no other \ncharges were filed, or the other charges were limited to such crimes as disorderly conduct, \nbreach of the peace, interfering with an officer, intoxication, or incitement to riot. \nDuring the same period, 2,709 cases which included charges of resisting arrest or assault \nand battery on a police officer were disposed of. Seventy-eight percent of the defendants \nwere exonerated (67 percent before trial). Only 26 percent of these cases resulted in \nconvictions for disorderly conduct, breach of the peace, threats, or intoxication. \n\nBy way of comparison, there were a total of 97,688 arrests in 1968, of which 17,960 were \nfor serious offenses; there were 99,932 arrests in 1969, of which 18,103 were for serious \noffenses; and there were 101,552 arrests in 1970, of which 20,769 were for serious \noffenses. The term \"serious offenses\", as used in the foregoing statistics, means murder, \nrape, robbery, aggravated assault and battery, burglary, larceny of automobile, and larceny \ninvolving goods valued at more than $50. \n1317*1317 The COPPAR organization received approximately 200 complaints of police \nmisconduct during the first eight months of 1970.[1] \nII. DISCUSSION \nCareful evaluation of all of this mass of evidence leads inescapably, and perhaps not \nsurprisingly, to the conclusion that, while the overall situation is not as bad as the plaintiffs \ncontend, neither is it as acceptable as the defendants contend. \nAt the outset, it may be appropriate to register a few general observations about the difficult \nproblems of the police in our society, and the practical limitations upon the role of courts in \nresolving disputes of the kind represented by this litigation. It is a truism that the multitude of \nsocial ills afflicting our society bear most heavily upon the poor, and especially upon the \nblack poor. These same social ills spawn much of the activity which society regards as \ncriminal. Society as a whole, in the ghettos as well as in the suburbs, looks to the police for \nprotection against criminal activity. The policeman is not responsible for the deplorable \nconditions in which the underprivileged exist, but he is charged with responsibility for \ndealing at firsthand with the more egregious results of these conditions. To the deprived, he \ncan easily become the symbol of society's oppression, and the target for undifferentiated \nhostility generated by causes having no direct relationship to police conduct. \nPolice traditionally are trained and function as a quasi-military organization. Generally \nspeaking, they are required to enforce the law as it is written. They are required to obey \norders, and to exact obedience from others. The tactics of police enforcement involve a \nconsiderable measure of naked power. Dealing so frequently with persons who have no \nrespect for law or for the police function, the policeman cannot always rely upon peaceful \nand reasonable persuasion as the instrument of choice. \nThe hazards of police work are very real and pervasive. The conduct of individual officers in \nstress-filled situations should not be judged by the standards of armchair hindsight. \nAnd finally, departmental routine in a large police department is necessarily somewhat \ncumbersome and time-consuming. The record is replete with instances of this problem. \nTypically, an individual is stopped by a patrolling police officer and questioned briefly about \nsome actual or suspected misfeasance. If he does not give a satisfactory account of \nhimself, he is taken to the precinct office. After some delay and processing there, if further \nquestioning is desired, he is transported to the Detective Division for interrogation and \nfurther processing. Thereafter, he is transported to the Police Administration Building in \ncenter-city (\"The Round-house\") for further questioning and, perhaps, detention, formal \ncharges, and a preliminary hearing. Where there was probable cause for the original arrest, \n\nthe entire process would seem to be unobjectionable. But the record makes clear that this \npractice is not limited to probable cause situations. \nFrom the record as a whole, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that, in the absence of \nprobable cause for arrest, at least two classes of individuals are particularly likely to be \nsubjected to this kind of procedure: poor blacks, and individuals who question or protest the \ninitial police contact. It is apparent from this record that a substantial number of policemen \ngenuinely believe (a) that if an individual is freed without formal charges within 24 to 48 \nhours after his initial arrest, he should not object to the inconvenience involved; (b) that a \nperson 1318*1318 who questions the propriety of police conduct, or refuses to cooperate \nwith the police, should expect to be inconvenienced, or worse; and (c) that if it is ultimately \nestablished that there was probable reason to believe an individual guilty of an offense, his \ntreatment at the hands of the police should be judged by different standards than those \napplicable to the innocent. And, needless to say, such incidents are viewed by the police \nand the detainees from entirely different perspectives; a course of events which, to the \npoliceman, are merely routine \"police procedure\" often appear to the civilian involved to be \ndrastic and outrageous encroachments upon his liberty and privacy. \nProblems similar to those presented in this case have been the subject of a great deal of \nlearned commentary. See, for example, Skolnick: Justice without Trial, Law Enforcement in \na Democratic Society (1966); Westley: Violence and the Police: A Sociological Study of \nLaw, Custom, and Morality (1970); Chevigny: Police Power, Police Abuses in New York City \n(1969); Niederhoffer: Behind the Shield, the Police in Urban Society (1967). Two \npresidential commissions have addressed themselves extensively to these issues: The \nPresident's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, Task Force \nReport: The Police (1967), at pp. 178-207 (in which, incidentally, the Philadelphia Highway \nPatrol is described as a \"skull-cracking division\"); Report of the National Advisory \nCommission on Civil Disorders, Ch. 11 (1968). A review of this material suggests that the \nproblems disclosed by the record in the present case are not new, and are fairly typical of \nthe problems afflicting police departments in major urban areas. \nThe totality of the evidence in this case convincingly establishes the following general \nconclusions: \n1. Violations of the legal and constitutional rights of citizens are committed by only a small \npercentage of the members of the police force. \n2. Nevertheless, such violations do occur, entirely too frequently. \n3. The evidence does not disclose any conscious departmental policy of racial bias, or of \ndiscriminatory enforcement on racial lines. \n4. The presence of racial prejudice on the part of an individual police officer, manifested in \nthe performance of his police duties, is unlikely to be reflected adversely in the performance \nratings accorded him by his superiors. \n5. Existing procedures for handling civilian complaints and for enforcement of police \ndiscipline related to civilian complaints is totally inadequate. It is the policy of the \n\ndepartment to discourage the filing of such complaints, to avoid or minimize the \nconsequences of proven police misconduct, and to resist disclosure of the final disposition \nof such complaints. \nThe evidence discloses that violations of legal and constitutional rights of citizens by the \npolice are most widespread in the following areas of police activity: \n(1) Arrests \"for investigation\"; (2) Treatment of citizens who question or criticize what the \npolice are doing in a particular instance; (3) Charges of resisting arrest, when the arrest was \nunlawful in the first place; (4) Extreme overreaction to actual or reported assaults upon \npolicemen. \nBefore discussing the ultimate issue as to whether or not the plaintiffs are entitled to relief in \nthis proceeding, various legal issues must be resolved. \nThe defendants filed motions to dismiss in both cases, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 41(b), apparently on the theory that the Court lacks the power to grant injunctive \nrelief in situations of this kind. However, when a pattern of frequent police violations of rights \nis shown, the law is clear that injunctive relief may be granted. Lewis et al. v. Kugler et al., \n446 F.2d 1343 (3d Cir. 1971). \nDefendants in the Goode case also seek dismissal on the ground that indispensable parties \n(Officers De Fazio 1319*1319 and D'Amico) were not joined. I agree that, in the absence of \nthese individuals as parties to the lawsuit, no relief which directly affects them may properly \nbe granted. However, the evidence concerning these two officers is relevant, and may \nproperly be considered, in connection with the issues involving the remaining defendants. \nIn the COPPAR case, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it \nwas too vague and general to state a cause of action under ยง 1983. While the complaint is \nprobably insufficient on that ground, see Negrich v. Hohn, 379 F.2d 213 (3d Cir. 1967), this \ndefect was remedied by requiring the plaintiffs to provide a list of witnesses and a brief \ndescription of each incident charged, in advance of the hearings in this case. \nThe District Attorney has moved to dismiss the complaint in the COPPAR case. To the \nextent that some of the plaintiffs originally sought injunctions against pending criminal \nprosecutions, the motion clearly is meritorious. Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. \n747, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1972). However, this Court, early in the proceedings, declined to grant \nsuch relief, and the plaintiffs in question appeared to have abandoned this issue. In view of \nthe District Attorney's relationship to the handling of civilian complaints against police \nmisconduct, he was properly retained as a party to the litigation. \nAt an earlier stage of the proceedings, I informally granted the defense motion to dismiss \nthe case with respect to the Black Panther Party and the Young Lords Party, because of \ntheir refusal to submit to discovery. That ruling will now be formalized. Elimination of these \norganizations as parties plaintiff does not, of course, preclude consideration of the evidence \nrelating to these organizations or their members in connection with the issues raised by the \nother plaintiffs. \n\nDefendants in the COPPAR case have also argued that COPPAR has no standing to bring \nthis action, and is not a proper representative of the class of plaintiffs. I believe COPPAR \ndoes have the requisite standing. See N.A.A.C.P. v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 \nL.Ed.2d 405 (1963); Smith v. Board of Education of Morrilton School District, 365 F.2d 770 \n(8th Cir. 1966). \nOn September 4, 1970, I entered an injunction in the COPPAR case, restraining the police \nfrom violating the constitutional rights of citizens in certain enumerated respects. The Ellis \nSteward incident and the Johnson and Simon incident occurred while this injunction was in \neffect, and plaintiffs seek an adjudication of contempt. While it appears that the order of this \nCourt was violated, particularly in the Johnson and Simon case, this may have been due to \na lack of precision in the framing of the injunctive order. Although it is a close question, I am \nnot persuaded that the violation was willful. The police apparently were not aware that what \nthey did amounted to an arrest. \nIn both cases, the captions should be amended to designate Mr. Rizzo as the Mayor, and \nMr. Thomas O'Neill as the Police Commissioner, and to reflect such other personnel \nchanges as have occurred in the interim. \nAs noted earlier, the evidence in this case does not establish the existence of any overall \nPolice Department policy to violate the legal and constitutional rights of citizens, nor to \ndiscriminate on the basis of race. The record does establish, however, that such violations \ndo occur, with such frequency that they cannot be dismissed as rare, isolated instances; \nand that little or nothing is done by the city authorities to punish such infractions, or to \nprevent their recurrence. I am convinced that, except in cases of severe injuries, existing \nremedies are inadequate to protect the public interest involved. Private suits for damages \nare expensive, time-consuming, not readily available, and not notably successful; moreover, \nthey have no preventive effect. Except in extreme cases, 1320*1320 criminal prosecutions \nare unlikely; and, in any event, given the dual role of the District Attorney's staff, such \nprosecutions are a most unsatisfactory vehicle for vindication of the rights involved. \nRespect and admiration for the performance of the vast majority of police officers cannot \njustify refusal to confront the reality of the abuses which do exist. But deference to the \nessential role of the police in our society does mandate that intrusion by the courts into this \nsensitive area should be limited, and should be directed toward insuring that the police \nthemselves are encouraged to remedy the situation. \nIn the course of these proceedings, much of the argument has been directed toward the \nproposition that courts should not attempt to supervise the functioning of the police \ndepartment. Although, contrary to the defendants' assertions, the Court's legal power to do \njust that is firmly established, see for example, Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496, 59 S.Ct. 954, \n83 L.Ed. 1423 (1938); Lankford v. Gelston, 364 F.2d 197 (4th Cir. 1966); Belknap v. Leary, \n427 F.2d 496 (2d Cir. 1970); Lewis et al. v. Kugler et al., supra. And see The Federal \nInjunction as a Remedy for Unconstitutional Police Conduct, 78 Yale L.J. 143 (1968); \nand cf. Holt v. Sarver, 442 F.2d 304 (8th Cir. 1971) (prison conditions), I am not persuaded \nthat any such drastic remedy is called for, at least initially, in the present cases. \n\nTo a large extent, consideration of sweeping injunctive relief in the present cases has been \nobviated by the consent injunctive decree in the Alexander v. Rizzo case (C.A. No. 70-992). \nAlthough the point has not been raised by the parties, it would seem that this decree should \nbe accorded res judicata, or at least collateral estoppel, effect, at least with respect to the \nabuses inherent in initial police contacts and arrests \"for investigation.\" In any event, the \nentry of that decree should go far to eliminate many of the abuses complained of in the \npresent cases. \nWhile there are additional areas of police misconduct asserted in the present case, to which \na further injunctive decree might by directed, I am satisfied that the establishment of \nadequate procedures for handling and adjudicating civilian complaints against the police \nwould go far to prevent further abuses, and to reduce the friction which the existing \nprocedures, or lack of procedures, generate. \nThere are four principal defects in the present arrangement. (1) The departmental \nprocedures are geared to handle infractions of police rules and regulations, yet these rules \nand regulations are not framed to cover specific violations of the legal and constitutional \nrights of civilians; (2) Complaints are handled on a \"chain of command\" basis, and this \nresults in a tendency to minimize and discourage civilian complaints; (3) The existing \nprocedures do not provide adequate opportunity for the civilian complainant to present his \ncase, before a relatively objective tribunal; and (4) The outcome of the proceeding is not \ndisclosed. \nIn attempting to frame an appropriate remedy in this litigation, the existence of sharp \nphilosophical differences over the issue of civilian review of police activities cannot be \noverlooked. The defendants, and police generally, strongly oppose the entire concept of \ncivilian review. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, appear to contend that no other solution is \nfeasible. It is not the function of a court to attempt to resolve this doctrinal controversy; such \nissues are best resolved in the legislative and executive branches of government, and \nultimately in the polling places. But it is the obligation of a federal court, under the Civil \nRights Act, to take appropriate action to prevent recurring and otherwise predictable \nviolations of the constitutional rights of citizens. If this can be accomplished without \nimposing some form of civilian review, that course of action seems preferable, since it would \nrepresent the least drastic of possible alternatives. But if, after a reasonable opportunity for \nexperimentation, the police themselves prove unable to reduce the abuses complained of to \nan acceptable 1321*1321 minimum, then some form of civilian intervention, whether by a \ncivilian administrative agency, or by injunctive decree, may become necessary. \nIn conformity with the views expressed above, the defendants will be required to formulate \nand submit to this Court for approval, a comprehensive program for dealing adequately with \ncivilian complaints alleging police misconduct. It is suggested that the following guidelines \nshould be carefully considered in such formulation: (1) Appropriate revision of police \nmanuals and rules of procedure spelling out in some detail, in simple language, the \"dos \nand don'ts\" of permissible conduct in dealing with civilians (for example, manifestations of \nracial bias, derogatory remarks, offensive language, etc.; unnecessary damage to property \nand other unreasonable conduct in executing search warrants; limitations on pursuit of \npersons charged only with summary offenses; recording and processing civilian complaints, \netc.). (2) Revision of procedures for processing complaints against police, including (a) \n\nready availability of forms for use by civilians in lodging complaints against police officers; \n(b) a screening procedure for eliminating frivolous complaints; (c) prompt and adequate \ninvestigation of complaints; (d) adjudication of non-frivolous complaints by an impartial \nindividual or body, insulated so far as practicable from chain of command pressures, with a \nfair opportunity afforded the complainant to present his complaint, and to the police officer \nto present his defense; and (3) prompt notification to the concerned parties, informing them \nof the outcome. \nIn this connection, I note that the plaintiffs have contended that, so long as the final decision \nis reviewable by the Police Commissioner, any such procedure is likely to prove inadequate. \nI am not persuaded that this necessarily follows. Some worthwhile analogies may perhaps \nbe derived from the recent improvements in handling disciplinary matters in the military \nforces. It has apparently been feasible in the Armed Forces to provide relatively impartial \nadjudications, essentially unfettered by command pressures, while still retaining control by \nthe military. If, in notifying the complainant as to the disposition of his complaint, a brief \nstatement of the reasons for the disposition were also required, arbitrary or erroneous \nrejection of legitimate complaints would be unlikely. \nIt should be mentioned that the foregoing guidelines are consistent with generally \nrecognized minimal standards for improving police-community relations. They impose no \nsubstantial burdens on the Police Department, and pose no threat to vigorous law \nenforcement. They afford protection to the accused policeman, as well as to the \ncomplaining civilian. \nIn conclusion, it should perhaps be emphasized that this Court has not decided that the \nplaintiffs and the class they represent have a constitutional right to improved departmental \nprocedures for handling civilian complaints against police. What the Court has decided is \nthat, under existing circumstances, violations of constitutional rights by police do occur in an \nunacceptably high number of instances; that, in the absence of change in procedures, such \nviolations are likely to continue to occur; and that revision of procedures for handling civilian \ncomplaints is a necessary first step in attempting to prevent future abuses. \nAn appropriate order will be entered in each of the two cases. \nORDER IN NO. 72-2430 \nAnd now, this 14th day of March, 1973, it is ordered: \n1. The Black Panther Party and the Young Lords Party are stricken from the caption of the \ncase as plaintiffs, and as to those plaintiffs the complaint is dismissed. \n2. The remaining plaintiffs are directed to make appropriate amendments to the caption of \nthe case, to reflect changes in personnel which have occurred during the pendency of this \nlawsuit. \n1322*1322 3. The defendants, acting jointly or separately, as they may prefer, are directed, \nwithin thirty (30) days from the date of this Order, to submit to this Court for its approval a \n\ncomprehensive program for improving the handling of citizen complaints alleging police \nmisconduct, in conformity with the views expressed in the Opinion of this Court filed this \ndate. \nORDER IN NO. 7-491 \nAnd now, this 14th day of March, 1973, it is ordered: \n1. The plaintiffs are directed to make appropriate amendments to the caption of the case, to \nreflect changes in personnel which have occurred during the pendency of this lawsuit. \n2. The defendants, acting jointly or separately, as they may prefer, are directed, within thirty \n(30) days from the date of this Order, to submit to this Court for its approval a \ncomprehensive program for improving the handling of citizen complaints alleging police \nmisconduct, in conformity with the views expressed in the Opinion of this Court filed this \ndate. \n[1] At a post-hearing conference in January 1973, both sides were afforded an opportunity to reopen the hearings in \norder to produce evidence of any pertinent changes in procedures, or, other relevant circumstances, which may have \noccurred since the briefs were filed. In the absence of any request for reopening, the cases are being disposed of on \nthe existing record. \n ",

      "text": "423 U.S. 362 (1976) \nRIZZO, MAYOR OF PHILADELPHIA, ET AL. \nv. \nGOODE ET AL. \nNo. 74-942. \nSupreme Court of United States. \nArgued November 11, 1975. \nDecided January 21, 1976. \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD \nCIRCUIT. \n364*364 James M. Penny, Jr., argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs \nwas Stephen Arinson. \nPeter Hearn argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were Nancy J. \nGellman, Jack J. Levine, William Lee Akers, and Harry Lore.[*] \nMR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court. \nThe District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, after parallel trials of separate \nactions[1] filed 365*365 in 1970, entered an order in 1973 requiring petitioners \"to submit to \n[the District] Court for its approval a comprehensive program for improving the handling of \ncitizen complaints alleging police misconduct\" in accordance with a comprehensive opinion \nfiled together with the order. The proposed program, negotiated between petitioners and \nrespondents for the purpose of complying with the order, was incorporated six months later \ninto a final judgment. Petitioner City Police Commissioner was thereby required, inter \nalia, to put into force a directive governing the manner by which citizens' complaints against \npolice officers should henceforth be handled by the department.[2] The Court of Appeals \nfor 366*366 the Third Circuit, upholding the District Court's finding that the existing \nprocedures for handling citizen complaints were \"inadequate,\" affirmed the District Court's \nchoice of equitable relief: \"The revisions were . . . ordered because they appeared to have \nthe potential for prevention of future police misconduct.\" 506 F. 2d 542, 548 (1974). We \ngranted certiorari to consider petitioners' claims that the judgment of the District Court \nrepresents an unwarranted intrusion by the federal judiciary into the discretionary authority \ncommitted to them by state and local law to perform their official functions. We find \nourselves substantially in agreement with these claims, and we therefore reverse the \njudgment of the Court of Appeals. \nI \nThe central thrust of respondents' efforts in the two trials was to lay a foundation for \nequitable intervention, in one degree or another, because of an assertedly pervasive pattern \nof illegal and unconstitutional mistreatment by police officers. This mistreatment was said to \n\nhave been directed against minority citizens in particular 367*367 and against all \nPhiladelphia residents in general. The named individual and group respondents were \ncertified to represent these two classes. The principal petitioners hereโthe Mayor, the City \nManaging Director, and the Police Commissionerโwere charged with conduct ranging from \nexpress authorization or encouragement of this mistreatment to failure to act in a manner so \nas to assure that it would not recur in the future. \nHearing some 250 witnesses during 21 days of hearings, the District Court was faced with a \nstaggering amount of evidence; each of the 40-odd incidents might alone have been \nthe piece de resistance of a short, separate trial. The District Court carefully and \nconscientiously resolved often sharply conflicting testimony, and made detailed findings of \nfact,[3] which both sides now accept, with respect to eight of the incidents presented by \nthe Goode respondents and with respect to 28 of those presented by COPPAR.[4] \nThe principal antagonists in the eight incidents recounted in Goode were Officers DeFazio \nand D'Amico, members of the city's \"Highway Patrol\" force. They were not named as parties \nto the action. The District Court found the conduct of these officers to be violative of the \nconstitutional rights of the citizen complainants in three[5] of the incidents, and further found \nthat complaints to the police Board of Inquiry had resulted in one case in a relatively mild \nfive-day suspension and in another case a conclusion that there was no basis for \ndisciplinary action. \nIn only two of the 28 incidents recounted in COPPAR 368*368 (which ranged in time from \nOctober 1969 to October 1970) did the District Court draw an explicit conclusion that the \npolice conduct amounted to a deprivation of a federally secured right; it expressly found no \npolice misconduct whatsoever in four of the incidents; and in one other the departmental \npolicy complained of was subsequently changed. As to the remaining 21, the District Court \ndid not proffer a comment on the degree of misconduct that had occurred: whether simply \nimprovident, illegal under police regulations or state law, or actually violative of the \nindividual's constitutional rights. Respondents' brief asserts that of this latter group, the facts \nas found in 14 of them \"reveal [federal] violations.\"[6] While we think that somewhat of an \noverstatement, we accept it, arguendo, and thus take it as established that, insofar as \nthe COPPAR record reveals, there were 16 incidents occurring in the city of Philadelphia \nover a year's time in which numbers of police officers violated citizens' constitutional rights. \nAdditionally, the District Court made reference to citizens' complaints to the police in seven \nof those 16; in four of which, involving conduct of constitutional dimension, the police \ndepartment received complaints but ultimately took no action against the offending officers. \nThe District Court made a number of conclusions of law, not all of which are relevant to our \nanalysis. It found that the evidence did not establish the existence of any policy on the part \nof the named petitioners to violate the legal and constitutional rights of the plaintiff classes, \nbut it did find that evidence of departmental procedure indicated a tendency to discourage \nthe filing of civilian complaints and to minimize the consequences of \npolice 369*369 misconduct. It found that as to the larger plaintiff class, the residents of \nPhiladelphia, only a small percentage of policemen commit violations of their legal and \nconstitutional rights, but that the frequency with which such violations occur is such that \n\"they cannot be dismissed as rare, isolated instances.\" COPPAR v. Rizzo, 357 F. Supp. \n1289, 1319 (1973). In the course of its opinion, the District Court commented: \n\n\"In the course of these proceedings, much of the argument has been directed toward the \nproposition that courts should not attempt to supervise the functioning of the police \ndepartment. Although, contrary to the defendants' assertions, the Court's legal power to do \njust that is firmly established, . . . I am not persuaded that any such drastic remedy is called \nfor, at least initially, in the present cases.\" Id., at 1320. \nThe District Court concluded by directing petitioners to draft, for the court's approval, \"a \ncomprehensive program for dealing adequately with civilian complaints,\" to be formulated \nalong the following \"guidelines\" suggested by the court: \n\"(1) Appropriate revision of police manuals and rules of procedure spelling out in some \ndetail, in simple language, the `dos and don'ts' of permissible conduct in dealing with \ncivilians (for example, manifestations of racial bias, derogatory remarks, offensive language, \netc.; unnecessary damage to property and other unreasonable conduct in executing search \nwarrants; limitations on pursuit of persons charged only with summary offenses; recording \nand processing civilian complaints, etc.). (2) Revision of procedures for processing \ncomplaints against police, including (a) ready availability of forms for use by civilians in \nlodging complaints against police 370*370 officers; (b) a screening procedure for eliminating \nfrivolous complaints; (c) prompt and adequate investigation of complaints; (d) adjudication \nof nonfrivolous complaints by an impartial individual or body, insulated so far as practicable \nfrom chain of command pressures, with a fair opportunity afforded the complainant to \npresent his complaint, and to the police officer to present his defense; and (3) prompt \nnotification to the concerned parties, informing them of the outcome.\" Id., at 1321. \nWhile noting that the \"guidelines\" were consistent with \"generally recognized minimum \nstandards\" and imposed \"no substantial burdens\" on the police department, the District \nCourt emphasized that respondents had no constitutional right to improved police \nprocedures for handling civilian complaints. But given that violations of constitutional rights \nof citizens occur in \"unacceptably\" high numbers, and are likely to continue to occur, the \ncourt-mandated revision was a \"necessary first step\" in attempting to prevent future \nabuses. Ibid. On petitioners' appeal the Court of Appeals affirmed. \nII \nThese actions were brought, and the affirmative equitable relief fashioned, under the Civil \nRights Act of 1871, 42 U. S. C. ยง 1983. It provides that \"[e]very person who, under color of \n[law] subjects, or causes to be subjected, any . . . person within the jurisdiction [of the \nUnited States] to the deprivation of any rights . . . secured by the Constitution and laws, \nshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law [or] suit in equity . . . .\" The plain words \nof the statute impose liabilityโwhether in the form of payment of redressive damages or \nbeing placed under an injunctionโonly for conduct which \"subjects, or causes to be \nsubjected\" the 371*371 complainant to a deprivation of a right secured by the Constitution \nand laws. \nThe findings of fact made by the District Court at the conclusion of these two parallel trialsโ\nin sharp contrast to that which respondents sought to prove with respect to petitionersโ\ndisclose a central paradox which permeates that court's legal conclusions. Individual police \nofficers not named as parties to the action were found to have violated the constitutional \n\nrights of particular individuals, only a few of whom were parties plaintiff. As the facts \ndeveloped, there was no affirmative link between the occurrence of the various incidents of \npolice misconduct and the adoption of any plan or policy by petitioners โexpress or \notherwiseโshowing their authorization or approval of such misconduct. Instead, \nthe sole causal connection found by the District Court between petitioners and the individual \nrespondents was that in the absence of a change in police disciplinary procedures, the \nincidents were likely to continue to occur, not with respect to them, but as to the members of \nthe classes they represented. In sum, the genesis of this lawsuitโa heated dispute \nbetween individual citizens and certain policemenโhas evolved into an attempt by the \nfederal judiciary to resolve a \"controversy\" between the entire citizenry of Philadelphia and \nthe petitioning elected and appointed officials over what steps might, in the Court of \nAppeals' words, \"[appear] to have the potential for prevention of future police misconduct.\" \n506 F. 2d, at 548. The lower courts have, we think, overlooked several significant decisions \nof this Court in validating this type of litigation and the relief ultimately granted. \nA \nWe first of all entertain serious doubts whether on the facts as found there was made out \nthe requisite Art. III 372*372 case or controversy between the individually named \nrespondents and petitioners. In O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S. 488 (1974), the individual \nrespondents, plaintiffs in the District Court, alleged that petitioners, a county magistrate and \njudge, had embarked on a continuing, intentional practice of racially discriminatory bond \nsetting, sentencing, and assessing of jury fees. No specific instances involving the individual \nrespondents were set forth in the prayer for injunctive relief against the judicial officers. And \neven though respondents' counsel at oral argument had stated that some of the named \nrespondents had in fact \"suffered from the alleged unconstitutional practices,\" the Court \nconcluded that \"[p]ast exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or \ncontroversy regarding injunctive relief, however, if unaccompanied by any continuing, \npresent adverse effects.\" Id., at 495-496. The Court further recognized that while \"past \nwrongs are evidence bearing on whether there is a real and immediate threat of repeated \ninjury,\" the attempt to anticipate under what circumstances the respondents there would be \nmade to appear in the future before petitioners \"takes us into the area of speculation and \nconjecture.\" Id., at 496-497. These observations apply here with even more force, for the \nindividual respondents' claim to \"real and immediate\" injury rests not upon what the named \npetitioners might do to them in the futureโsuch as set a bond on the basis of raceโbut \nupon what one of a small, unnamed minority of policemen might do to them in the future \nbecause of that unknown policeman's perception of departmental disciplinary procedures. \nThis hypothesis is even more attenuated than those allegations of future injury found \ninsufficient in O'Shea to warrant invocation of federal jurisdiction. Thus, insofar as the \nindividual respondents were concerned, we think they lacked the requisite \n\"personal 373*373 stake in the outcome,\" Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 204 (1962), i. e., the \norder overhauling police disciplinary procedures. \nB \nThat conclusion alone might appear to end the matter, for O'Shea also noted that \"if none of \nthe named plaintiffs. . . establishes the requisite of a case or controversy with the \n\ndefendants, none may seek relief on behalf of himself or any other member of the class\" \nwhich they purport to represent. 414 U. S., at 494. But, unlike O'Shea, this case did not \narise on the pleadings. The District Court, having certified the plaintiff classes,[7] bridged the \ngap between the facts shown at trial and the classwide relief sought with an unprecedented \ntheory of ยง 1983 liability. It held that the classes' ยง 1983 actions for equitable relief against \npetitioners were made out on a showing of an \"unacceptably high\" number of those \nincidents of constitutional dimensionโsome 20 in allโoccurring at large in a city of three \nmillion inhabitants, with 7,500 policemen. \nNothing in Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S. 496 (1939), the only decision of this Court cited by the \nDistrict Court,[8] 374*374 or any other case from this Court, supports such an open-ended \nconstruction of ยง 1983. In Hague, the pattern of police misconduct upon which liability and \ninjunctive relief were grounded was the adoption and enforcement of deliberate policies by \nthe defendants there (including the Mayor and the Chief of Police) of excluding and \nremoving the plaintiff's labor organizers and forbidding peaceful communication of their \nviews to the citizens of Jersey City. These policies were implemented \"by force and \nviolence\" on the part of individual policemen. There was no mistaking that the defendants \nproposed to continue their unconstitutional policies against the members of this discrete \ngroup. \nLikewise, in Allee v. Medrano, 416 U. S. 802 (1974), relied upon by the Court of Appeals \nand respondents here, we noted: \n\"The complaint charged that the enjoined conduct was but one part of a single plan by the \ndefendants, and the District Court found a pervasive pattern of intimidation in which the law \nenforcement authorities sought to suppress appellees' constitutional rights. In this \nblunderbuss effort the police not only relied on statutes . . . found constitutionally deficient, \nbut concurrently exercised their authority 375*375 under valid laws in an unconstitutional \nmanner.\" Id., at 812 (emphasis added). \nThe numerous incidents of misconduct on the part of the named Texas Rangers, as found \nby the District Court and summarized in this Court's opinion, established beyond \nperadventure not only a \"persistent pattern\" but one which flowed from an intentional, \nconcerted, and indeed conspiratorial effort to deprive the organizers of their First \nAmendment rights and place them in fear of coming back. Id., at 814-815. \nRespondents stress that the District Court not only found an \"unacceptably high\" number of \nincidents but held, as did the Court of Appeals, that \"when a pattern of frequent police \nviolations of rights is shown, the law is clear that injunctive relief may be granted.\" 357 F. \nSupp., at 1318 (emphasis added). However, there was no showing that the behavior of the \nPhiladelphia police was different in kind or degree from that which exists elsewhere; indeed, \nthe District Court found \"that the problems disclosed by the record . . . are fairly typical of \n[those] afflicting police departments in major urban areas.\" Ibid. Thus, invocation of the \nword \"pattern\" in a case where, unlike Hague and Medrano, the defendants are not causally \nlinked to it, is but a distant echo of the findings in those cases. The focus \nin Hague and Medrano was not simply on the number of violations which occurred but on \nthe common thread running through them: a \"pervasive pattern of intimidation\" flowing from \na deliberate plan by the named defendants to crush the nascent labor \n\norganizations. Medrano, supra, at 812. The District Court's unadorned finding of a statistical \npattern is quite dissimilar to the factual settings of these two cases. \nThe theory of liability underlying the District Court's opinion, and urged upon us by \nrespondents, is that even 376*376 without a showing of direct responsibility for the actions of \na small percentage of the police force, petitioners' failure to act in the face of a statistical \npattern is indistinguishable from the active conduct enjoined \nin Hague and Medrano. Respondents posit a constitutional \"duty\" on the part of petitioners \n(and a corresponding \"right\" of the citizens of Philadelphia) to \"eliminate\" future police \nmisconduct; a \"default\" of that affirmative duty being shown by the statistical pattern, the \nDistrict Court is empowered to act in petitioners' stead and take whatever preventive \nmeasures are necessary, within its discretion, to secure the \"right\" at issue. Such reasoning, \nhowever, blurs accepted usages and meanings in the English language in a way which \nwould be quite inconsistent with the words Congress chose in ยง 1983. We have never \nsubscribed to these amorphous propositions, and we decline to do so now. \nRespondents claim that the theory of liability embodied in the District Court's opinion is \nsupported by desegregation cases such as Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of \nEducation, 402 U. S. 1 (1971). But this case, and the long line of precedents cited therein, \nsimply reaffirmed the body of law originally enunciated in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 \nU. S. 483 (1954): \n\"Nearly 17 years ago this Court held, in explicit terms, that state-imposed segregation by \nrace in public schools denies equal protection of the laws. At no time has the Court deviated \nin the slightest degree from that holding or its constitutional underpinnings. \n..... \n\"Once a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of a district court's equitable \npowers to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility 377*377 are inherent in \nequitable remedies.\" Swann, supra, at 11, 15. \nRespondents, in their effort to bring themselves within the language of Swann, ignore a \ncritical factual distinction between their case and the desegregation cases decided by this \nCourt. In the latter, segregation imposed by law had been implemented by state authorities \nfor varying periods of time, whereas in the instant case the District Court found that the \nresponsible authorities had played no affirmative part in depriving any members of the two \nrespondent classes of any constitutional rights. Those against whom injunctive relief was \ndirected in cases such as Swann and Brown were not administrators and school board \nmembers who had in their employ a small number of individuals, which latter on their own \ndeprived black students of their constitutional rights to a unitary school system. They were \nadministrators and school board members who were found by their own conduct in the \nadministration of the school system to have denied those rights. Here, the District Court \nfound that none of the petitioners had deprived the respondent classes of any rights \nsecured under the Constitution. Under the well-established rule that federal \"judicial powers \nmay be exercised only on the basis of a constitutional violation,\" Swann, supra, at 16, this \ncase presented no occasion for the District Court to grant equitable relief against \npetitioners. \nC \n\nGoing beyond considerations concerning the existence of a live controversy and threshold \nstatutory liability, we must address an additional and novel claim advanced by respondent \nclasses. They assert that given the citizenry's \"right\" to be protected from unconstitutional \nexercises of police power, and the \"need for protection from 378*378 such abuses,\" \nrespondents have a right to mandatory equitable relief in some form when those in \nsupervisory positions do not institute steps to reduce the incidence of unconstitutional police \nmisconduct.[9] The scope of federal equity power, it is proposed, should be extended to the \nfashioning of prophylactic procedures for a state agency designed to minimize this kind of \nmisconduct on the part of a handful of its employees. However, on the facts of this case, not \nonly is this novel claim quite at odds with the settled rule that in federal equity cases \"the \nnature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy,\" ibid., but important \nconsiderations of federalism are additional factors weighing against it. Where, as here, the \nexercise of authority by state officials is attacked, federal courts must be constantly mindful \nof the \"special delicacy of the adjustment to be preserved between federal equitable power \nand State administration of its own law.\" Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S. 117, 120 \n(1951), quoted in O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S., at 500. \nSection 1983 by its terms confers authority to grant equitable relief as well as damages, but \nits words \"allow a suit in equity only when that is the proper proceeding for redress, and \nthey refer to existing standards to determine what is a proper \nproceeding.\" Giles v. Harris, 189 U. S. 475, 486 (1903) (Holmes, J.). Even in an action \nbetween private individuals, it has long been held that an injunction is \"to be used sparingly, \nand only in a clear and plain case.\" Irwin v. Dixion, 9 How. 10, 33 (1850). When a plaintiff \nseeks to enjoin the activity of a government agency, even within a unitary court system, his \ncase must contend with \"the well-established rule that the Government has traditionally \nbeen granted the widest latitude in the `dispatch of its own internal 379*379 affairs,' Cafeteria \nWorkers v. McElroy, 367 U. S. 886, 896 (1961),\" quoted in Sampson v. Murray, 415 U. S. \n61, 83 (1974). The District Court's injunctive order here, significantly revising the internal \nprocedures of the Philadelphia police department, was indisputably a sharp limitation on the \ndepartment's \"latitude in the `dispatch of its own internal affairs.' \" \nWhen the frame of reference moves from a unitary court system, governed by the principles \njust stated, to a system of federal courts representing the Nation, subsisting side by side \nwith 50 state judicial, legislative, and executive branches, appropriate consideration must be \ngiven to principles of federalism in determining the availability and scope of equitable \nrelief. Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U. S. 922, 928 (1975). \nSo strongly has Congress weighted this factor of federalism in the case of a state criminal \nproceeding that it has enacted 28 U. S. C. ยง 2283 to actually deny to the district courts the \nauthority to issue injunctions against such proceedings unless the proceedings come within \nnarrowly specified exceptions. Even though an action brought under ยง 1983, as this was, is \nwithin those exceptions, Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U. S. 225 (1972), the underlying notions of \nfederalism which Congress has recognized in dealing with the relationships between federal \nand state courts still have weight. Where an injunction against a criminal proceeding is \nsought under ยง 1983, \"the principles of equity, comity, and federalism\" must nonetheless \nrestrain a federal court. 407 U. S., at 243. \n\nBut even where the prayer for injunctive relief does not seek to enjoin the state criminal \nproceedings themselves, we have held that the principles of equity nonetheless militate \nheavily against the grant of an injunction except in the most extraordinary circumstances. \nIn O'Shea v. Littleton, supra, at 502, we held that \"a major 380*380 continuing intrusion of \nthe equitable power of the federal courts into the daily conduct of state criminal proceedings \nis in sharp conflict with the principles of equitable restraint which this Court has recognized \nin the decisions previously noted.\" And the same principles of federalism may prevent the \ninjunction by a federal court of a state civil proceeding once begun. Huffman v. Pursue, \nLtd., 420 U. S. 592 (1975). \nThus the principles of federalism which play such an important part in governing the \nrelationship between federal courts and state governments, though initially expounded and \nperhaps entitled to their greatest weight in cases where it was sought to enjoin a criminal \nprosecution in progress, have not been limited either to that situation or indeed to a criminal \nproceeding itself. We think these principles likewise have applicability where injunctive relief \nis sought, not against the judicial branch of the state government, but against those in \ncharge of an executive branch of an agency of state or local governments such as \npetitioners here. Indeed, in the recent case of Mayor v. Educational Equality League, 415 U. \nS. 605 (1974), in which private individuals sought injunctive relief against the Mayor of \nPhiladelphia, we expressly noted the existence of such considerations, saying: \"There are \nalso delicate issues of federal-state relationships underlying this case.\" Id., at 615. \nContrary to the District Court's flat pronouncement that a federal court's legal power to \n\"supervise the functioning of the police department . . . is firmly established,\" it is the \nforegoing cases and principles that must govern consideration of the type of injunctive relief \ngranted here. When it injected itself by injunctive decree into the internal disciplinary affairs \nof this state agency, the District Court departed from these precepts. \nFor the foregoing reasons the judgment of the Court 381*381 of Appeals which affirmed the \ndecree of the District Court is \nReversed. \nMR. JUSTICE STEVENS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \nMR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN and MR. JUSTICE \nMARSHALL join, dissenting. \nTo be sure, federal-court intervention in the daily operation of a large city's police \ndepartment, as the Court intimates, is undesirable and to be avoided if at all possible. The \nCourt appropriately observes, however, ante, at 367, that what the Federal District Court did \nhere was to engage in a careful and conscientious resolution of often sharply conflicting \ntestimony and to make detailed findings of fact, now accepted by both sides, that attack the \nproblem that is the subject of the respondents' complaint. The remedy was one evolved with \nthe defendant officials' assent, reluctant though that assent may have been, and it was one \nthat the police department concededly could live with. Indeed, the District Court, in its \nmemorandum of December 18, 1973, stated that \"the resolution of all the disputed items \nwas more nearly in accord with the defendants' position than with the plaintiffs' position,\" \n\nand that the relief contemplated by the earlier orders of March 14, 1973, \nsee COPPAR v. Rizzo, 357 F. Supp. 1289 (ED Pa.), \"did not go beyond what the \ndefendants had always been willing to accept.\" App. 190a. No one, not even this Court's \nmajority, disputes the apparent efficacy of the relief or the fact that it effectuated a \nbetterment in the system and should serve to lessen the number of instances of deprival of \nconstitutional rights of members of the respondent classes. What is worrisome to the Court \nis abstract principle, and, of course, the Court has a right 382*382 to be concerned with \nabstract principle that, when extended to the limits of logic, may produce untoward results in \nother circumstances on a future day. See Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, 209 U. S. \n349, 355 (1908) (Holmes, J.). \nBut the District Court here, with detailed, careful, and sympathetic findings, ascertained the \nexistence of violations of citizens' constitutional rights, of a pattern of that type of activity, of \nits likely continuance and recurrence, and of an official indifference as to doing anything \nabout it. The case, accordingly, plainly fits the mold of Allee v. Medrano, 416 U. S. 802 \n(1974), and Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S. 496 (1939), despite the observation, 357 F. Supp., at \n1319, that the evidence \"does not establish the existence of any overall Police \nDepartment policy to violate the legal and constitutional rights of citizens, nor to discriminate \non the basis of race\" (emphasis supplied). I am not persuaded that the Court's attempt to \ndistinguish those cases from this one is at all successful. There must be federal relief \navailable against persistent deprival of federal constitutional rights even by (or, perhaps I \nshould say, particularly by) constituted authority on the state side. \nThe Court entertains \"serious doubts,\" ante, at 371-372, as to whether there is a case or \ncontroversy here, citing O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S. 488 (1974). O'Shea, however, \npresented quite different facts. There, the plaintiff-respondents had alleged a fear of injury \nfrom actions that would be subsequent to some future, valid arrest. The Court said: \n\"We assume that respondents will conduct their activities within the law and so avoid \nprosecution and conviction as well as exposure to the challenged course of conduct said to \nbe followed by petitioners. . . . Under these circumstances, where 383*383 respondents do \nnot claim any constitutional right to engage in conduct proscribed by therefore presumably \npermissible state laws, or indicate that it is otherwise their intention to so conduct \nthemselves, the threat of injury from the alleged course of conduct they attack is simply too \nremote to satisfy the case-or-controversy requirement and permit adjudication by a federal \ncourt.\" Id., at 497-498. \nHere, by contrast, plaintiff-respondents are persons injured by past unconstitutional conduct \n(an allegation not made in the O'Shea complaint) and fear injury at the hands of the police \nregardless of whether they have violated a valid law. \nTo the extent that Part II-A of the Court's opinion today indicates that some constitutional \nviolations might be spread so extremely thin as to prevent any individual from showing the \nrequisite case or controversy, I must agree. I do not agree, however, with the Court's \nsubstitution of its judgment for that of the District Court on what the evidence here shows. \nThe Court states that what was shown was minimal, involving only a few incidents out of \nthousands of arrests in a city of several million population. Small as the ratio of incidents to \narrests may be, the District Court nevertheless found a pattern of operation, even if no \n\npolicy, and one sufficiently significant that the violations \"cannot be dismissed as rare, \nisolated instances.\" 357 F. Supp., at 1319. Nothing the Court has said demonstrates for me \nthat there is no justification for that finding on this record. The Court's criticism about \nnumbers would be just as forceful, or would miss the mark just as much, with 100 incidents \nor 500 or even 3,000, when compared with the overall number of arrests made in the city of \nPhiladelphia. The pattern line will appear somewhere. The District Court drew it this side of \nthe number of 384*384 proved instances. One properly may wonder how many more \ninstances actually existed but were unproved because of the pressure of time upon the trial \ncourt, or because of reluctant. witnesses, or because of inherent fear to question constituted \nauthority in any degree, or because of a despairing belief, unfounded though it may be, that \nnothing can be done about it anyway and that it is not worth the effort. That it was worth the \neffort is convincingly demonstrated by the result in the District Court, by the affirmance, on \nthe issues before us, by a unanimous panel of the Third Circuit, and by the support given \nthe result below by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Bar Association, \nthe Greater Philadelphia Movement, and the other entities that have filed briefs as amici \ncuriae here in support of the respondents. \nThe Court today appears to assert that a state official is not subject to the strictures of 42 U. \nS. C. ยง 1983 unless he directs the deprivation of constitutional rights. Ante, at 375-377. In \nso holding, it seems to me, the Court ignores both the language of ยง 1983 and the case law \ninterpreting that language. Section 1983 provides a cause of action where a person acting \nunder color of state law \"subjects, or causes to be subjected,\" any other person to a \ndeprivation of rights secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States. By its very \nwords, ยง 1983 reaches not only the acts of an official, but also the acts of subordinates for \nwhom he is responsible. In Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 (1961), the court said that ยง \n1983 \"should be read against the background of tort liability that makes a man responsible \nfor the natural consequences of his actions,\" id., at 187, and: \n\"It is abundantly clear that one reason the legislation was passed was to afford a federal \nright in federal courts because, by reason of prejudice, passion, 385*385 neglect, intolerance \nor otherwise, state laws might not be enforced and the claims of citizens to the enjoyment of \nrights, privileges, and immunities guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment might be \ndenied by state agencies.\" Id., at 180. (Emphasis added.) \nI do not find it necessary to reach the question under what circumstances failure to \nsupervise will justify an award of money damages, or whether an injunction is authorized \nwhere the superior has no consciousness of the wrongs being perpetrated by his \nsubordinates.[1] It is clear that an official may be enjoined from consciously permitting his \nsubordinates, in the course of their duties, to violate the constitutional rights of persons with \nwhom they deal. In rejecting the concept that the official may be responsible under ยง 1983, \nthe Court today casts aside reasoned conclusions to the contrary reached by the Courts of \nAppeals of 10 Circuits.[2] \n386*386 In the instant case, the District Court found that although there was no departmental \npolicy of racial discrimination, \"such violations do occur, with such frequency that they \ncannot be dismissed as rare, isolated instances; and that little or nothing is done by the city \nauthorities to punish such infractions, or to prevent their recurrence,\" 357 F. Supp., at \n1319, and that it \"is the policy of the department to discourage the filing of such complaints, \n\nto avoid or minimize the consequences of proven police misconduct, and to resist \ndisclosure of the final disposition of such complaints.\" Id., at 1318. Needless to say, \npetitioners were under a statutory duty to supervise their subordinates. See Philadelphia \nHome Rule Charter, c. 2, ยง 5-200. I agree with the District Court that its findings are \nsufficient to bring petitioners within the ambit of ยง 1983. \nFurther, the applicability of ยง 1983 to controlling officers allows the district courts to avoid \nthe necessity of injunctions issued against individual officers and the consequent continuing \nsupervision by the federal courts of the day-to-day activities of the men on the street. The \nDistrict Court aptly stated: \n\"Respect and admiration for the performance of the vast majority of police officers cannot \njustify refusal to confront the reality of the abuses which 387*387 do exist. But deference to \nthe essential role of the police in our society does mandate that intrusion by the courts into \nthis sensitive area should be limited, and should be directed toward insuring that the police \nthemselves are encouraged to remedy the situation.\" 357 F. Supp., at 1320. \nI would regard what was accomplished in this case as one of those rightly rare but \nnevertheless justified instancesโjust as Allee and Hagueโof federal-court \"intervention\" in \na state or municipal executive area. The facts, the deprival of constitutional rights, and the \npattern are all proved in sufficient degree. And the remedy is carefully delineated, worked \nout within the administrative structure rather than superimposed by edict upon it, and \nessentially, and concededly, \"livable.\" In the City of Brotherly Loveโor in any other \nAmerican cityโno less should be expected. It is a matter of regret that the Court sees fit to \nnullify what so meticulously and thoughtfully has been evolved to satisfy an existing need \nrelating to constitutional rights that we cherish and hold dear. \n[*] Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed by Peter Van N. Lockwood, David Bonderman, J. Harold \nFlannery, Paul R. Dimond, William E. Caldwell, and Norman J. Chachkin for the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights \nunder Law; by Barry S. Kohn, Deputy Attorney General, Vincent X. Yakowicz, Solicitor General, and Robert P. \nKane, Attorney General, for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; by Jack Greenberg, James M. Nabrit III, Charles \nStephen Ralston, and Drew S. Days III for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.; by Robert M. \nLandis and Samuel T. Swansen for the Philadelphia Bar Association; by Anthony G. Amsterdam, Melvin L. Wulf, Joel \nM. Gora, and Sanford J. Rosen for the American Civil Liberties Union et al.; and by Frederic L. Ballard for the Greater \nPhiladelphia Movement. \n[1] The complaint in the first action, filed in February 1970 and styled Goode v. Rizzo, was brought by respondent \nGoode and two other individuals. The second, filed in September 1970 and styled COPPAR v. Tate, was brought by \n21 individuals and four organizations: the Council of Organizations on Philadelphia Police Accountability and \nResponsibility (COPPAR), an unincorporated association composed of some 32 constituent community \norganizations; the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, whose principal office is in Atlanta, Ga.; and the Black \nPanther Party and the Young Lords Party, unincorporated associations of black citizens and citizens of Spanish \norigin, respectively. The latter two groups, of which some of the individual complainants in COPPAR were members, \nwere ultimately dismissed as parties by the District Court for failure to submit to discovery. Both complaints named as \ndefendants those officials then occupying the offices of Mayor, City Managing Director (who supervises and, with the \nMayor's approval, appoints the Police Commissioner), and the Police Commissioner, who has direct supervisory \npower over the department. Two other police supervisors subordinate to the Commissioner were also named \ndefendants. Both actions were permitted to proceed as class actions, with the individual respondents representing all \nresidents of Philadelphia and an \"included\" class of all black residents of that city. For a thorough account of the \nprocedural background of this case, see the District Court's opinion. COPPAR v. Rizzo, 357 F. Supp. 1289 (1973). \n[2] A judgment of considerable detail was entered against petitioners, appropriate substitution having been made in \n1973 of the current officeholders, including petitioner Rizzo, by then Mayor. See n. 1, supra. The existing procedure \nfor handling complaints, embodied in the 2 1/2-page \"Directive 127\" (March 1967), was expanded to an all-\n\nencompassing 14-page document reflecting the revisions suggested by the District Court's \"guidelines.\" See infra, at \n369-370. Directive 127 as revised was ordered by the District Court to be promulgated as such by the Police \nCommissioner and posted in various public areas, with copies provided anyone who either requested one or inquired \ngenerally into the procedure for lodging complaints. A \"Citizen's Complaint Report\" was ordered drawn up in a format \ndesignated by the court, with copies to be printed and available in sufficient quantities to the public in several \nlocations. The department was further ordered to propose a police recruit training manual reflective of the court's \n\"guidelines,\" with respondents then having the chance to proffer alternative suggestions. Finally, the department was \ndirected to maintain adequate statistical records and annual summaries to provide a basis for the court's \"evaluation\" \nof the program as ordered; the court reserved jurisdiction to review petitioners' progress in these areas and to grant \nfurther relief as might be appropriate. Pet. for Cert. 20a-37a. \n[3] Each of the incidents in Goode and COPPAR is set out in full detail in the District Court's opinion. 357 F. Supp., at \n1294-1316. For present purposes we need only highlight those findings. \n[4] See n. 1, supra. \n[5] Incidents \"1\" through \"3\" 357 F. Supp., at 1294-1297. \n[6] This textual summary of the District Court's findings with respect to the COPPAR incidents is taken from the Brief \nfor Respondents 14-15, and n. 18 \n[7] The Court of Appeals noted that petitioners had in their appeal raised no question of the propriety of the class \ndesignation under Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23. That issue is therefore not before us, and we express no opinion upon it. \n[8] Lankford v. Gelston, 364 F. 2d 197 (CA4 1966), was also cited by the District Court for the proposition that federal \ncourts have the legal power to \"supervise the functioning of the police department.\" 357 F. Supp., at 1320. But the \ncourt in Lankford intimated no such power, and the facts which confronted it are obviously distinguishable. There, in \nexecuting an \"evil practice that has long and notoriously persisted in the Police Department,\" the police, searching \nover a 19-day period for two black men who murdered one of their ranks, conducted some 300 warrantless searches \nof private residences in a predominately Negro area \"at all hours of the day and night\" on nothing more than \n\"unverified anonymous [telephone] tips.\" 364 F. 2d, at 198, and 205 n. 9. This \"series of the most flagrant invasions of \nprivacy ever to come under the scrutiny of a federal court\" arose out of what several experienced police officers \ntestified was a \"routine practice\" in \"serious cases.\" Id., at 200-201. Injunctive relief under ยง 1983 was granted against \nthe defendant Police Commissioner because the wholesale raids were the \"effectuation of a plan conceived by high \nranking [police] officials,\" a practice which in the interim the defendant had \"renounced only obliquely, if at all,\" and as \nto which \"the danger of repetition has not been removed.\" Id., at 202, 204. \n[9] Brief for Respondents 34-35. \n[1] In this regard, however, this Court recently has approved the imposition of criminal liability without \"consciousness \nof wrong-doing\" for failure to supervise subordinates. United States v. Park, 421 U. S. 658 (1975). The concept, thus, \nis far from novel doctrine. \n[2] \"Under section 1983, equitable relief is appropriate in a situation where governmental officials have notice of the \nunconstitutional conduct of their subordinates and fail to prevent a recurrence of such misconduct. Hague v. CIO, 307 \nU. S. 496 . . . (1939). From a legal standpoint, it makes no difference whether the plaintiffs' constitutional rights are \nviolated as a result of police behavior which is the product of the active encouragement and direction of their \nsuperiors or as a result of the superiors' mere acquiescence in such behavior. In either situation, if the police officials \nhad a duty, as they admittedly had here, to prevent the officers under their direction from committing the acts which \nare alleged to have occurred during the Convention, they are proper defendants in this action.\" Schnell v. City of \nChicago, 407 F. 2d 1084, 1086 (CA7 1969). See also Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Eisenstadt, 494 F. 2d 1196, \n1199 (CA1), cert. denied, 419 U. S. 977 (1974), and Rozecki v.

Following the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis, MN\npolice officers on May 25, 2020, a wave of sustained, large-scale demonstrations against \nracism  and  racialized  police  violence  swept  across  the  United  States  and  spread \nthroughout many parts of the world. Protesters expressed their outrage and called for \n1 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 2 of 42\njustice not only for George Floydโs murder, but also for Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, \nand numerous other Black people, indigenous people, and people of color killed by police \nin the United States. Protesters have also called for changes to address systemic racism \nand reshape the way matters of public safety are addressed in this country and in their \ncommunities. \n2.  On June 1, 2020, people from Pittsburgh and surrounding communities \nassembled in the East Liberty neighborhood of the City of Pittsburgh to add their voices \nto these nationwide protests and seek change locally. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police \n(โPBPโ) responded by escalating a peaceful protest into a scene of pandemonium, panic, \nviolence and bloodshed. The PBP deployed hundreds of officers to counter approximately \n150 protesters.  As the assembled protesters held their hands in the air and chanted, \nโThis is not a riot,โ and โHands up โ Donโt shoot,โ PBP ordered its officers to attack them \nwith explosives, chemical agents and ammunition which is known to seriously wound and \nsometimes kill its targets.  PBP officers drove ambulances past injured protesters without \nstopping. After ordering peaceful protesters to leave the area, PBP officers blocked their \nescape with chemical gas, riot police and mounted patrols. PBP then arrested several \nprotestors for failing to disperse, subjecting them to confinement in the midst of a global \nCOVID-19 pandemic.  The PBP ordered tactical officers dressed in paramilitary garb to \npatrol a residential neighborhood in armored vehicles and arbitrarily throw canisters of \nchemical gas at and/or arrest anyone they encountered.  \n3.  Plaintiffs assembled in East Liberty to protest the routine covering up of \npolice misconduct and abuse. In response, City of Pittsburgh officials, including the \nMayor, Public Safety Director and Chief of Police, disseminated flagrant lies to conceal \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 3 of 42\nand/or justify the PBPโs shameless use of force against peaceful protesters. These \nofficials accused protesters of hurling rocks and โvolleys of bricksโ at PBP officers, and \nvehemently denied using chemical agents.  Numerous videos demonstrate that these \nstatements were patently false.  \n4.  Plaintiffs are peaceful protesters who were subjected to police violence \nwhile protesting police violence.   \nโข  Nicole Rulli and Charles Bryant brought Ms. Rulliโs thirteen-year-old son, \nA.F., to the protest to teach him about his First Amendment rights.  The \npolice gassed his family and taught him to fear political protests.  \n \nโข  Simon Phillips is a dance instructor who attended the protest for โthe chance \nto congregate with othersโ  and express his โfeelings of grief, frustration, \nand desperation for the Black community.โ  He was arrested near his East \nLiberty apartment after he complied with the PBPโs order to leave.   \n \nโข  Donovan  Hayden  does  public  service  work  for  a  local  non-profit.    He \nattended the protest to oppose the โdegrading, reckless and racist policingโ \nwhich he and other Black people experience on a daily basis.  PBP officers \ngassed him chased him a gunpoint as he left the protest.   \n \nโข  Jennifer โJayโ Yoder has a background in social justice and is a trained \npeacemaker. Yoder attended the protest to support the movement and aid \nother protesters.  Police gassed and pushed Yoder and arrested them1 as \nthey attempted to return to their car after the protest.  \n \nโข  Christopher Wilson Juring is a food service worker. He attended to protest \nviolence  and  racism  and  to  show  support  for  the  African  American \ncommunity.  PBP shot him in the back as he fled a cloud of tear gas and \nsmoke.  \n \n5.  Plaintiffs bring this class action on behalf of themselves and others similarly \nsituated. Plaintiffs allege that the Defendantsโ conduct violated their First Amendment \nrights to freedom of speech and assembly, their Fourth Amendment rights to be free from \n \n1 Yoder uses the pronouns โtheyโ and โthem.โ \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 4 of 42\nexcessive force and false arrest and their Fourteenth Amendment right not to be subject \nto official governmental policies which violate their constitutional rights.  \nII)  PARTIES \n6.

Venue is proper in this Court because the events described herein occurred \nin the Western District of Pennsylvania. \nIV)  FACTS \n \na.  City Officials were on notice that the PBP could and would indiscriminately \nuse excessive force against peaceful protesters.  \n \n21.  On May 25, 2020 Minneapolis police officers murdered George Floyd, an \nAfrican-American man, by kneeling on his neck and back until he suffocated. Video of the \nmurder sparked public outrage and weeks of protests against racism and police violence \nthroughout the United States that continue as of the filing of this Complaint.    \n22.  Numerous protests took place in and around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.   \n23.  On Saturday, May 30, 2020 thousands of concerned residents of the City \nof Pittsburgh and surrounding areas gathered in Pittsburghโs Downtown area to protest \npolice racism and violence. The vast majority of the attendees did not engage in any \nproperty damage or violence. However, following some reports of property damage, PBP \nofficers used chemical gas, rubber bullets and other projectiles, pepper spray, flashbang \ngrenades  and  other  riot  control  agents  indiscriminately  against  everyone  present, \nincluding peaceful protesters and nonviolent bystanders.  Numerous protesters were \nseriously injured. The PBP arrested 46 people at the protests for โfailure to disperse.โ The \nAllegheny County District Attorney refused to pursue charges against at least 39 of these \narrestees because the PBPโs evidence was insufficient to support the charges.  \n24.  As a result of the PBPโs actions on May 30, 2020, Defendants Peduto, \nHissrich and Schubert were on notice that PBP officers would use overwhelming and \nexcessive force against peaceful protesters with little or no provocation.   \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 8 of 42\n25.  As a result of the PBPโs actions on May 30, 2020, Defendants Peduto, \nHissrich and Schubert were on notice that PBP officers would arrest and jail peaceful \nprotesters with little or no evidence to support criminal charges.  \n26.  Defendants Peduto, Hissrich and Schubert supported the PBP actions. \n27.  Defendants Peduto, Hissrich and Schubert made no effort to ensure that \nsuch indiscriminate use of force did not occur at future protests.  \nb.  PBP used excessive force against peaceful protesters on June 1, 2020  \n28.  On  June  1,  2020  thousands  of  concerned  Pittsburgh  residents  again \ngathered to protest police racism and violence, this time in the East Liberty neighborhood \nof the City of Pittsburgh.  \n29.  Plaintiffs were among those protesters who gathered in East Liberty on \nJune 1, 2020. \n30.  Plaintiff Nicole Rulli attended the protest with her fiancรฉ Plaintiff Charles \nBryant,  Jr.  and  her  thirteen-year-old  son,  A.F.  (collectively  โRulli  familyโ).  Rulli  is \nCaucasian, Bryant is African-American and A.F. is biracial. Bryant wrote of his decision \nto attend the protest: โAttending the protest on June 1st was the most patriotic act of my \nlife. I was exercising my 1st amendment rights.โ Rulli and Bryant brought A.F. to the \nprotest because they wanted to expose him to a peaceful political protest and teach him \nabout his constitutional rights.   \n31.  Plaintiff Simon Phillips is a dance instructor.  He is African American. Phillips \nwrote that he attended the protest for โthe chance to congregate with othersโ  and express \nhis โfeelings of grief, frustration, and desperation for the Black community.โ  \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 9 of 42\n32.  Plaintiff Donovan Hayden works for a local arts non-profit.  Hayden wrote of \nhis reasons for joining the protest: โThe recent killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, \nand George Floyd, reignited the anger that I share with many black people. The anger \nthat comes from being victims to degrading, reckless, and racist policing. I channeled and \nexpressed that anger through protesting on June 1st. I marched, sang, and listened with \nothers to mourn the lives lost and challenge the systems killing us.โ \n33.  Plaintiff Christoper Wilson Juring works in the food service industry.  He \nparticipated in the protest in order to exercise his First Amendment rights. Juring wrote \nthe following regarding his reasons for protesting: โOn Monday, June 1st, 2020 I attended \nthe Black Lives Matter protest in East Liberty to give my support to the fight against police \nbrutality and systemic racism. I feel that participating in such protests is a necessary step \nin demanding change. As a white person, I wanted to use my privilege and my voice when \nso many people canโt even walk down the street without fearing for their lives.โ \n34.  Plaintiff Jennifer โJayโ Yoder works for a non-profit that supports survivors \nof  sexual  violence.  Yoder  is  a  trained  international  human  rights  observer  and \npeacemaker and has observed and participated in protests involving international conflict. \nJay was at the protest to support racial justice and oppose police brutality, as well to \nobserve police conduct and assist protestors. \n35.  The protesters marched peacefully in the streets in the vicinity of Penn \nAvenue and Centre Avenue from approximately 3:30 pm until approximately 6:30 pm.   \n36.  Historically, Defendants Peduto, Hissrich, Schubert and City of Pittsburgh \nhave permitted, approved and/or encouraged similar protests in Pittsburgh streets.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 10 of 42\n37.  Uniformed  Pittsburgh  Bureau  of  Police  (PBP)  officers  approved  and/or \nencouraged the protestersโ activities by, inter alia, marching with them, communicating \nwith organizers, blocking off streets and redirecting traffic.  \n38.  By  attending,  approving,  encouraging,  and  assisting  the  protesters \nactivities,  Defendants  communicated  to  them  that  they  were  exercising  their  First \nAmendment rights in a time, place and manner that Defendants considered reasonable.  \n39.  At approximately 6:30 pm, the protesters congregated at the Target store \nlocated at the Corner of Penn Avenue and Centre Avenue. Many either remained at that \nlocation or left the area.  \n40.  Between  6:30  pm and 7:00  pm, a  much smaller group  of 100 to  150  \nprotesters continued to march down Centre Avenue toward Negley Avenue (hereinafter \nโProtestersโ).   \n41.  The Protesters marched peacefully down Centre Avenue for over half a \nmile.   \n42.  Although  Defendant  Peduto  had  implemented  a  curfew  for  the  City  of \nPittsburgh, this curfew would not go into effect until 8:30 pm, nearly two hours later.  \n43.  As the Protesters marched, approximately 50 to 100 PBP officers formed a \nline across Centre Avenue at Negley Avenue, blocking the Protestersโ path.  \n44.  The officers wore helmets, face shields and gas masks. Every officer held \neither a baton or a firearm.   \n45.  Additional  officers  were  dressed  in  military  gear  including  camouflage, \nhelmets and gas masks.  These officers carried firearms and other tactical gear.  Some \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 11 of 42\nhad police dogs. On information and belief, these officers were members of the PBP \nSpecial Weapons and Tactics (โSWATโ) Team.   \n46.  At about the same time as the above described PBP officers blocked the \nProtestersโ path on Centre Avenue, other PBP officers and/or law enforcement officers \nacting under the direction of PBP, formed similar lines across other East Liberty streets.  \n47.  The Protesters stopped on Centre Avenue approximately 30 feet from the \nline of police officers.    \n48.  The Protesters were peaceful.   \n49.  The Protestersโ behavior was not materially different from the behavior of \nthe larger group of protesters earlier in the day, which the PBP openly approved and \nsupported.   \n50.  Groups of Protesters chanted, โHands up - Donโt Shoot,โ โThis is not a riot,โ \nโJoin us,โ and similar phrases. Some Protesters knelt on the ground with their hands in \nthe air. Link to Video 1; Link to Video 2 2 \n51.  The Protesters did not damage public or private property. \n52.  The Protesters did not throw bricks or rocks at the PBP officers.  \n53.  The Protesters did not engage in any activity that could have given rise to \na  reasonable  belief  that  they  were  likely  to  cause  substantial  harm  or  serious \ninconvenience, annoyance or alarm.  \n54.  The Protesters did not present an imminent threat to public safety, peace or \norder;  \n \n2 All attachments can be viewed at the following link \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/hlnksjtotwpxs0a/AAC7A6p0dbTaMvxTwA8NArzYa?dl=0  \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 12 of 42\n55.  Nevertheless,  on  information  and  belief,  Defendant  Doe  and/or  other \nindividually named Defendants made the decision to declare the Protestersโ assembly \nunlawful and order the Protesters to disperse.  \n56.  Defendantsโ Peduto, Hissrich and Schubert were either present during the \nabove-described events or were otherwise aware of them as they occurred.  These three \ndefendants either made the decision to declare the assembly unlawful, or approved of \nthat decision and the basis for that decision.  \n57.  At approximately 7:17 pm, a PBP officer (possibly Defendant Doe) made \nthe following announcement (hereinafter โunlawful assembly announcementโ):  \nI am Officer [unintelligible] of the Pittsburgh Police. I hereby \ndeclare this to be an unlawful assembly. I order all those \nassembled at this location to immediately disperse. You must \nleave this immediate vicinity.  If you remain in this vicinity you \nare in violation of the Pennsylvania crimes code. No matter \nwhat your purpose is you must leave. If you do not disperse \nyou will be arrested and/or subject to other police action. \nOther police action may include actual physical removal, the \nuse of riot control agents and/or less lethal munitions which \ncould cause the risk of injury for those who remain.  You must \nimmediately  leave  outbound  on  Centre  Avenue. \n[Unintelligible] \n \n58.  At that time, Centre Avenue outbound was blocked by numerous police \nvehicles and/or riot control officers; \n59.  Shortly after the first โunlawful assembly announcementโ was made, PBP \ndeployed a Long Range Acoustic Device (โLRADโ) against the Protesters.  A LRAD is \nmilitary-grade weapon that emits a โdeterrent toneโ so loud it can cause permanent \nhearing loss.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 13 of 42\n60.  Police warned the Protesters not to โadvanceโ on their line. However, nearly \nall of the Protesters were at least 30 feet away from the officers. At no time did any \nProtester โadvanceโ on the officers.  \n61.  The PBP officer made more โunlawful assembly announcementsโ over the \nnext several minutes and continued to deploy the LRAD.  \n62.  An unknown PBP officer discharged a firearm into the crowd hitting a \nProtester in the knee.  Other Protesters dragged the injured Protester to the sidewalk and \noffered him assistance.  Link to Video.   \n63.  Despite  this  aggressive  action  by  the  PBP,  the  Protesters  remained \npeaceful. They continued chanting but did not disperse. The Protesters did not throw \nrocks, bricks or bottles. The Protesters did not destroy property or commit acts of violence \nor vandalism. The Protesters did not advance on the police. Link to Video 1. Link to Video \n2.  \n64.  Despite the lack of any destruction, property damage or violent behavior by \nthe Protesters, on information and belief, Defendant Doe ordered the PBP officers to use \nforce against the Protesters.  \n65.  The  PBP  and  Defendants  made  no  attempt  to  communicate  to  the \nProtesters why the assembly was declared unlawful. \n66.  The  PBP  and  Defendants  made  no  attempt  to  communicate  to  the \nProtesters why they were being ordered to disperse. \n67.  In the middle of an unlawful assembly announcement, a PBP police officer \nsuddenly threw a โflashbangโ grenade at the crowd.  Link to Video 1; Link to Video 2; Link \nto Video 3.   \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 14 of 42\n68.  A โflashbangโ grenade is an explosive device designed to frighten and \ndisorient an enemy through a blinding flash of light and extremely loud explosive noise.  \n69.  Immediately following the detonation of the flashbang grenade, PBP officers \nbegan  firing  โrubber  bullets,โ  โbeanbags  roundsโ  and/or  โsponge  grenadesโ  at  the \nProtesters.  Link to Video.  \n70.  โRubber bulletsโ are large rubber coated metal cylinders which can be fired \nfrom standard firearms or dedicated โriot guns.โ  โBeanbag roundsโ are cloth bags filled \nwith lead shot which are fired from a 12-gauge shotgun.  โSponge grenadesโ are large \nplastic or metal bullets with dense foam rubber tips. They are typically fired from a 40mm \ngrenade launcher.  \n71.  Although these items are often referred to as โless lethalโ munitions, they \nare fired with the force of a gun or grenade launcher and have the capability to cause \nserious  injury  and/or  death,  particularly  when  fired  at  close  range  or  when  fired  at \nvulnerable areas of the body.  \n72.  PBP officers also threw and/or shot canisters into the crowd, some of which \nemitted smoke (โsmoke bombsโ) and some of which emitted chemical gas commonly \nreferred to as โtear gasโ (โchemical grenades.โ)   \n73.  โTear gasโ generally refers to chemical agents that cause tearing, coughing, \ndifficulty breathing, skin irritation and/or vomiting.  Tear gas grenades can be thrown or \nfired from a grenade launcher.  \n74.  Tear  gas  can  cause  serious  complications  for  people  with  respiratory \nproblems.  Exposure to tear gas increases susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and/or \ncomplications.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 15 of 42\n75.  Numerous Protesters were injured by tear gas thrown into the crowd. Link \nto Video. Many Protesters were coughing, had tears streaming down their faces, and had \ndifficulty breathing and seeing. The tear gas caused some Protesters to vomit. \n76.  The explosions, gunfire, smoke and gas caused many of the Protesters to \npanic and run outbound on Centre Avenue and into nearby side streets. Link to Video.   \n77.  The PBP officers immediately began to march outbound on Centre Avenue, \ncontinuing  to  indiscriminately  shoot  rubber  bullets,  beanbag  rounds  and/or  sponge \ngrenades at the fleeing Protesters as they ran away. Link to Video.   \n78.   The  smoke  created  from  the  PBPโs  smoke  bombs  and  chemical  gas \ngrenades was so thick that the officers could not see what or who they were shooting.  \n79.  Videos show PBP officers shooting blindly into smoke-filled Centre Avenue \nas Protesters run away. Link to Video 1; Link to Video 2.  \n80.  Numerous Protesters were hit with rubber bullets, bean bag rounds and \nsponge grenades.  Some were seriously injured and required hospitalization. \n81.  One Protester was hit in the face with an unknown munition and knocked \nunconscious. He suffered serious injuries and began bleeding profusely. Other Protesters \ndragged him out of the street and attempted to render medical aid.  Link to Video ; Link \nto Photograph. As they did so a SWAT officer threw a chemical grenade at them.   \n82.  No ambulance arrived to treat or transport the protester, so other Protesters \neventually drove him to the hospital where, on information and belief, he was treated for \nmultiple facial fractures.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 16 of 42\n83.  The marching PBP officers were flanked on the sidewalks by PBP SWAT \nofficers who pointed their firearms at Protesters, shoved them and yelled at them. Link to \nVideo.   \n84.  As the PBP officers advanced, they continued to deploy chemical gas \ngrenades, sometimes throwing them at Protesters as they fled.  \n85.  PBP officers deployed oleoresin capsicum (โOCโ or โpepperโ) spray on \nfleeing and/or peaceful Protesters.  \n86.  Multiple video recordings from the scene show two Protesters in an alley as \nthe line of PBP officers approaches.  The Protesters are on their knees with their hands \nin the air.  An officer sprays an unknown substance, believed to be OC spray, into the \nProtestersโ faces multiple times from a distance of approximately five feet, causing them \nto run.  A SWAT officer then throws a cannister, believed to be a chemical gas grenade, \nat the fleeing Protesters as another officer shoots an unknown munition at them. Link to \nVideo 1; Link to Video 2.   \n87.  As the PBP officers advanced, they knowingly shot at peaceful Protesters \nfrom dangerously close range.  \n88.  Multiple video recordings from the scene depict a line of officers advancing \non three Protesters (two men and a woman).  The Protesters slowly walk backwards with \ntheir hands raised.  A SWAT officer shoots the female protester in the chest with an \nunknown munition from a distance of approximately 10 feet.

The PBP used advancing lines of officers and chemical gas to cut off \navenues of escape for fleeing Protesters.  As a result, Protesters were forced to choose \nbetween approaching a line of officers or retreating into clouds of chemical gas.  \n90.  PBP officers arrested trapped Protesters and falsely charged them with \nfailure to disperse and disorderly conduct. \n91.  PBP officers shot and threw chemical gas canisters at trapped Protesters. \n92.  PBP officers continued to deploy chemical gas and other munitions on \nProtesters, bystanders and passers-by throughout East Liberty long after the Protesters \nhad  dispersed  and  over  a  half  mile  away  from  where  the  Protesters  had  initially \nassembled. Link to Video 1 ; Link to video 2  Link to Video 3;  Link to Video 4.  \n93.  PBP arrested and criminally charged 22 people on June 1 in relation to the \nprotest. \n94.  Despite a lack of probable cause for these arrests, the PBP transported the \n22 arrestees to the Allegheny County Jail where they were confined for hours in close \nquarters, in an area known to cause an increased risk of contracting COVID-19.  \n95.  On  June  18,  the  Allegheny  County  District  Attorneyโs  Office  withdrew \ncharges against all 22 people arrested and charged by PBP due to a lack of evidence.3 \nc.  PBP prevented injured Protesters from receiving medical treatment  \n96.  At all times relevant, at least one ambulance was at the scene and was \nescorted by an armored SWAT vehicle. This ambulance was not used to provide medical \ntreatment  or  transportation  to  injured  Protesters.  On  information  and  belief,  this \nambulance was requested by the PBP and was reserved to treat PBP personnel.   \n \n3 https://triblive.com/local/pittsburgh-allegheny/charged-dropped-for-22-protesters-arrested-in-east-liberty-\nmelee/ \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 18 of 42\n97.  On information and belief, the PBP made no effort to ensure that EMTs or \nother trained medical professionals were available to treat injured Protesters, despite \nknowing that the level of force they planned to use against Protesters was likely to cause \nserious injury or death.   \n98.  On information and belief, PBP officers prevented EMTs from entering the \narea and treating injured Protesters.  \n99.  Because  the  PBP  did  not  ensure  that  EMTs  were  available  to  treat \nProtesters and/or prevented EMTs from treating Protesters, injured Protesters received \nmedical assistance by untrained and unqualified individuals and were transported to the \nhospital in cars and pickup trucks.  \nd.  Plaintiffs Nicole Rulli, Charles Bryant, Jr. and A.F. (the โRulli familyโ) \n100.  The Rulli family left for the protest when Rulli got home from work.  They \narrived at the corner of Centre Avenue and Penn Avenue at approximately 6:15.  \n101.  The  Rulli  family  joined  the  Protesters  as  they  marched  down  Centre \nAvenue;  \n102.  The Rulli family did not participate in any vandalism, violence or destruction, \nnor did they witness any vandalism, violence or destruction before the PBP used force \nagainst the Protesters.   \n103.  The Rulli family did not throw any objects at PBP officers, nor did they \nwitness anyone else throwing objects at PBP officers before the PBP used force against \nthe Protesters. \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 19 of 42\n104.  The Rulli family did not disperse  when  ordered to do so  because the \nProtesters were peaceful and they believed they had a First Amendment right to protest \npolice misconduct in that place, at that time and in that manner.  \n105.  After the PBP officers began shooting at them and gassing them, the Rulli \nfamily  ran  outbound  on  Centre  Avenue  as  directed  by  the  unlawful  assembly \nannouncement. \n106.  The Rulli family found that Centre Avenue outbound was blocked by PBP \npolice in riot gear. Link to Photograph.  \n107.  All of the side streets leading off of Centre Avenue were similarly blocked. \n108.  Unable  to  escape,  the  Rulli  family  ran  to  the  top  of  a  parking \nstructure/shopping center along Centre Avenue at Beatty Street.  \n109.  From the top of the parking garage they witnessed a Protester on a side \nstreet  below  who  was  bleeding  profusely  from  the  head.    Several  Protesters  were \nsurrounding the injured individual and attempting to render medical aid.  No PBP officers \nor City of Pittsburgh EMTs assisted. Link to Video. As the Rulli family watched, a PBP \nofficer threw a chemical grenade at the injured Protester and those trying to assist him.  \n110.  Eventually the PBP officers advanced far enough down Centre Avenue that \nthe Rulli family was able to exit the parking structure behind them and walk down the \nsidewalk on Centre Avenue toward their car, which was parked near the Target store.   \n111.  As the Rulli family walked down Centre Avenue toward its intersection with \nPenn Avenue, an armored vehicle full of SWAT officers stopped in the middle of the street. \nThe armored vehicle was followed by a City of Pittsburgh ambulance and several other \nPBP vehicles.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 20 of 42\n112.  The corner of Penn and Centre is well over a half mile from the location \nwhere the Protesters had gathered.   \n113.  Several SWAT Officers exited the armored vehicle. Without warning, one of \nthese SWAT officers threw a chemical gas grenade at the Rulli family.  Link to Video. \n114.  The grenade hit Rulliโs foot and immediately began spewing gas in her face; \nSWAT officers threw two more chemical gas grenades at the family.  \n115.  Rulli yelled to thirteen-year-old A.F., telling him to run as she collapsed, \nunable to breathe and in excruciating pain. \n116.  Bryant, who suffers from asthma, was similarly disabled by the chemical \ngas the PBP officer had thrown at them. \n117.  The ambulance which followed the armored tactical vehicle did not assist \nRulli or Bryant.  \n118.  A group of Protesters attempted to render aide to Rulli and Bryant.  \n119.  A legal observer called 9-1-1 and requested an ambulance.  She informed \nthe operator that Mr. Bryant suffered from asthma and had been tear gassed.  \n120.  Rulli and Bryant waited for approximately a half hour. No ambulance arrived \nto treat them.  \n121.  Bryant began searching for A.F.  He asked a PBP officer if he had seen a \nthirteen-year-old boy without his parents.  The PBP officer dismissively told him, โThatโs \non you.โ  \n122.  Upon being told by his mother to run, thirteen-year-old A.F. had run to the \nparking lot of the Giant Eagle grocery store located near Penn Avenue and Shady \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 21 of 42\nAvenue.  He was disoriented from the effects of the chemical gas and his phone battery \nwas dead, so he was unable to call Rulli or Bryant.  \n123.  A group of strangers found A.F. and attempted to clean the chemicals out \nof his eyes. One of them lent him a phone to call Rulli and Bryant.  These strangers stayed \nwith A.F. until Rulli and Bryant were able to get him.  \n124.  As a direct and proximate result of PBPโs actions, A.F. has become fearful \nof police officers.  \n125.  As a direct and proximate result of PBPโs actions, A.F. has become fearful \nof being separated from his parents.  \n126.  As a direct and proximate result of the PBPโs actions, A.F. has become \nfearful of protests.   \n127.  A.F.โs fears, particularly his fear of protests, has caused the Rulli family to \navoid attending protest events which they would otherwise have attended.  \n128.  As a direct and proximate result of PBPโs actions, Rulli, Bryant and A.F. \nhave suffered physical and emotional injuries. \ne.  Plaintiff Simon Phillips \n129.  Plaintiff Simon Phillips participated in the protest and march which began at \n3:30 at the Target store at the corner of Centre Avenue and Penn Avenue. Phillips left the \nprotest at 5:00 pm to teach a dance class.  \n130.  Phillips returned to the protest at approximately 6:30 pm and marched down \nCentre Avenue with the Protesters.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 22 of 42\n131.  Phillips did not participate in any vandalism, violence or destruction, nor did \nhe witness any vandalism, violence or destruction before the PBP used force against the \nProtesters.   \n132.  Phillips did not throw any objects at PBP officers, nor did he witness anyone \nelse throwing objects at PBP officers before the PBP used force against the Protesters.  \n133.  After the PBP made the first unlawful assembly announcement and before \nPBP officers began using force against the Protesters, Phillips left the area and tried to \nreturn to his apartment.  \n134.  Phillipsโ apartment is over a half mile from the Corner of Centre Avenue and \nNegley Avenue.  \n135.  When Phillips was approximately 200 yards from his apartment, an armored \nvehicle drove up behind him and several SWAT officers jumped out brandishing firearms.   \n136.  Another line of SWAT officers approached him from the other direction, \ntrapping him.  \n137.  Two women were also trapped by the encroaching SWAT officers.  \n138.  The SWAT team ordered Phillips and the women to put their hands up and \ndrop to the ground, which they did.  \n139.  The SWAT officers bound their hands with zip ties and dragged them to the \ncurb.   \n140.  The SWAT officers would not tell them why they were being arrested.  \n141.  As  Phillips  was  being  detained,  PBP  officers  approached,  tackled  and \nforcibly arrested a woman as she complained about the arrests. The PBP officers then \nthrew  a  grenade  that  contained  either  smoke  or  chemical  gas  at  onlookers  who \nquestioned the officersโ actions and/or attempted to videotape them. Link to Video.   \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 23 of 42\n142.  An hour and a half after he was taken into custody, the officers lifted Phillips \nto put in him a police vehicle.  There was a pool of blood on the ground where he had \nbeen sitting. The zip ties had lacerated Phillipsโ left wrist.  \n143.  PBP officers transported Phillips to the hospital where he received multiple \nstitches in his left wrist. Link to Photograph. Phillips did not believe he needed stitches \nand requested not to get them. PBP officers told him he could not be jailed at the \nAllegheny County Jail without them. Phillips later received a bill from the University of \nPittsburgh Medical Center for $868. \n144.  PBP  officers  remained  with  Phillips  while  he  was  in  the  hospital  and \ntransported Phillips from the hospital to the Allegheny County Jail, where he was detained \novernight.   \n145.  Phillips was charged with disorderly conduct and failure to disperse.  \n146.  The officers who arrested Phillips had no probable cause to believe that he \nhad committed the crimes of disorderly conduct or failure to disperse.  \n147.  All of the charges against Phillips were withdrawn prior to his preliminary \nhearing due to a lack of evidence.  \n148.  As a direct and proximate result of the conduct of the PBP, Phillips suffered \nphysical and emotional injury.  \nf.  Plaintiff Jay Yoder  \n149.  Plaintiff Jay Yoder attended the June 1, 2020 protest to participate in the \nprotest, document the event and assist injured Protesters as needed.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 24 of 42\n150.  Yoder did not participate in any vandalism, violence or destruction, nor did \nthey witness any vandalism, violence or destruction before the PBP used force against \nthe Protesters.   \n151.  Yoder did not throw any objects at PBP officers, nor did they witness \nanyone else throwing objects at PBP officers before the PBP used force against the \nProtesters.  \n152.  Yoder did not leave when ordered to do so by the PBP because they \nbelieved they had a constitutionally protected right to continue to protest, as well as to \ndocument the PBPโs actions and assist Protesters. \n153.  Soon after PBP officers began shooting and gassing the Protesters, Yoder, \nwho was on the sidewalk, began to retreat;  \n154.  Because of a disability, Yoder was unable to move fast enough to satisfy \nthe officers. PBP SWAT officers yelled at and pushed Yoder.  Link to Video.  \n155.  Chemical gas burned Yoderโs eyes, nose, throat and skin. \n156.  The PBP fired munitions including rubber bullets, bean bag rounds and \nsponge grenades at Yoder.  \n157.  Yoder witnessed a SWAT officer shoot a female protester in the chest with \nan unknown munition which Yoder believed to be a tear gas grenade from a distance of \napproximately 10 feet. Link to Video.   \n158.  After the Protesters dispersed, Yoder attempted to leave the scene but was \nblocked by PBP officers.  \n159.  Yoder stated repeatedly to the officers, โMy car is over there,โ and โIโm just \ntrying to get to my car.โ  \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 25 of 42\n160.  Nevertheless, PBP officers ordered  Yoder to the ground, arrested and \nfalsely charged them with failure to disperse and disorderly conduct.  Link to Video.   \n161.  PBP officers transported Yoder to Allegheny County Jail where they were \ndetained overnight.   \n162.  PBP  officers  did  not  have  probable  cause  to  believe  that  Yoder  had \ncommitted the crimes of failure to disperse or disorderly conduct.  \n163.  All of the charges against Yoder were withdrawn prior to their preliminary \nhearing.  \n164.  As a direct and proximate result of PBPโs use of chemical gas against \nYoder, Yoder is at increased risk of contracting and/or suffering complications from \nCOVID-19.  \n165.  As the direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ actions, Yoder suffered \nphysical injuries and emotional distress. \ng.  Plaintiff Donovan Hayden \n166.  Plaintiff Donovan Hayden participated in the march which took place from \napproximately 3:30 pm to 6:30 pm and joined the smaller group of Protesters who \ncontinued marching down Centre Avenue. \n167.  Hayden did not participate in any vandalism, violence or destruction, nor did \nhe witness any vandalism, violence or destruction before the PBP used force against the \nProtesters. \n168.  Hayden did not throw any objects at PBP officers, nor did he witness anyone \nelse throwing objects at PBP officers before the PBP used force against the Protesters.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 26 of 42\n169.  Hayden did not leave when ordered to do so by the PBP because he \nbelieved he had a First Amendment right to peacefully protest and the order to disperse \nviolated the Constitution. \n170.  Chemical gas burned Haydenโs eyes, nose, throat and skin and Hayden \nnearly vomited from the effects of the gas.  \n171.  As a result of PBPโs use of chemical gas against Hayden, Hayden is at \nincreased risk of contracting and/or suffering complications from COVID-19.  \n172.  As  a  result  of  PBPโs  actions,  Hayden  suffered  physical  injuries  and \nemotional distress.  \nh.  Plaintiff Christopher Wilson Juring \n173.  Plaintiff Christopher Wilson Juring participated in the march which took \nplace from 3:30 pm to 6:30 pm and then joined the smaller group of Protesters who \nmarched down Centre Avenue at approximately 6:30.  \n174.  Juring did not did not participate in any vandalism, violence or destruction, nor \ndid he witness any vandalism, violence or destruction before the PBP used force against the \nProtesters.   \n175.  Juring did not throw any objects at PBP officers, nor did he witness anyone \nelse throwing objects at PBP officers before the PBP used force against the Protesters.  \n176.  Juring did not leave when ordered to do so by the PBP because he believed \nhe had a First Amendment right to peacefully protest and the order to disperse violated \nthe Constitution.  \n177.  When police began to fire munitions and tear gas into the crowd, Juring ran \noutbound on Centre Avenue in an attempt to leave the area.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 27 of 42\n178.  The PBP struck Juring with four rubber bullets in his lower back and the \nbacks of his legs as he ran away.  Link to Photograph 1; Link to Photograph 2; Link to \nPhotograph 3.  Link to Photograph 4.   \n179.  Chemical gas burned Juringโs eyes, nose, throat and skin. \n180.  As  a  result  of  PBPโs  use  of  chemical  gas  against  Juring,  Juring  is  at \nincreased risk of contracting and/or suffering complications from COVID-19.  \n181.  As a result of PBPโs actions, Juring suffered physical injuries and emotional \ndistress.  \ni.  City of Pittsburgh Officials falsely accused the Protesters of misconduct and \nminimized the PBPโs use of force \n \n182.  At 11:00 on the evening of June 1, 2020 Individual Defendants Peduto, \nHissrich, Schubert, Vinansky, Lando and Doe (hereinafter โIndividual Defendantsโ) held \na press conference. Link to Transcript.  \n183.  At the press conference defendants Peduto, Hissrich and Schubert praised \nthe actions of the PBP toward the Protesters in East Liberty that evening.   \n184.  Defendant Hissrich Stated: \nAnd I just want to mention that the work that was done by the \nofficers . . . tonight should be commended . . . I think we \nprevented businesses from being looted and possibly set \nafire. So I just want to commend all the public safety, the \ndifferent  law  enforcement  agencies  that  were  out  there \ntonight, and I think the public, they should be thanking the \npolice officers for the work that they have done. \n185.  Defendant Schubert stated: \nI give a lot of credit to the officers who were there because I \nwatched  them.  They  did  an  incredible  job.  They  did  an \nincredible job trying to keep the public safe while they were \nout there. \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 28 of 42\n \n186.  Defendant Peduto Stated: \n. . .  it was then that the officers escalated to the point of being \nable to break the crowd up, and that finally succeeded. What \nwe did not see is East Liberty is not on fire tonight. People \nfrom East Liberty are not harmed. Two protestors were taken \nfor  evaluation,  and  they  should  be  absolutely  fine.  Nine \nofficers were hurt by protestors. \n187.  In  order  to  justify  the  PBPโs  unwarranted  violence  against  peaceful \nProtesters,  Individual  Defendants  falsely  accused  the  Protesters  of  misconduct  and \nwrongdoing. These false accusations included:   \ni.  that Protesters vandalized buildings and broke glass windows; \n \nii.  that Protesters engaged in acts of violence and destruction;  \n \niii.  that Protesters attacked a KDKA television news crew; \n \niv.  that Protesters attacked Defendant Vinansky in his police vehicle.  \n \nv.  that Protesters were trying to or intended to โburn East Liberty down;โ \n \nvi.  that Protesters were โonly there to cause damage and to try to hurt \npolice officers.โ \n \nvii.  that the PBPโs use of force was precipitated by Protesters throwing \nrocks, bricks and water bottles at police officers;   \n \nviii.  that Protesters injured nine PBP officers by throwing rocks and bricks \nat their heads, chests, pelvis areas, knees and shoulders; \n \nix.  that PBP used force against the Protesters only after the Protesters \nthrew multiple โvolleys of bricksโ at officers; \n \n188.  Following the protests, Individual Defendants also attempted to minimize \nthe level of force PBP used by falsely claiming that:  \ni.  the only force PBP used against the Protesters was โsmoke;โ \n \nii.  PBP did not use chemical gas against Protesters; \n \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 29 of 42\niii.  PBP did not use, โcrowd munitionsโ against Protesters \n \niv.  PBP did not use โrubber bulletsโ against Protesters;  \n \nv.  Only two protesters were injured by PBP use of force; \n \nvi.  no Protesters were seriously injured by PBP use of force; \n \nvii.  City of Pittsburgh personnel treated all injured Protesters at the \nscene and transported them to hospitals. \nj.  Defendantsโ prior tolerance of more threatening protestors demonstrates \nthat Defendants did not reasonably believe Protestors posed a threat to \npublic safety, peace or order \n189.  On April 20, 2020 protesters congregated on Grant Street in Downtown \nPittsburgh to protest Governor Tom Wolfโs decision to close businesses due to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic.  \n190.  Many of the April 20 protesters openly carried tactical rifles and wore \nparamilitary outfits.  A group of these protesters referred to themselves as โThe Iron City \nResponse Guard.โ When asked by a reporter why they had armed themselves in this \nmanner for a peaceful protest, one belligerently responded, โWhy not?โ  \n191.  The June 1, 2020 Protesters were not carrying tactical rifles, or any other \nfirearms.  The June 1, protesters were not dressed in paramilitary outfits.  \n192.  The unarmed and peaceful June 1, 2020 Protesters posed less of a threat \nof โsubstantial harm or serious inconvenience, annoyance or alarmโ to the residents of \nthe City of Pittsburgh than the heavily armed April 20 protesters.  \n193.  On information and belief, the PBP did not deploy SWAT units, armored \nvehicles, riot police and/or snipers to the April 20 protests.  \n194.  The PBP did not declare the April 20 protests to be unlawful, order the \nprotesters to disperse and/or use force to disperse them.  \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 30 of 42\nk.  City of Pittsburgh Officials were aware of, acquiesced in and/or failed to \nintervene to prevent the violation of the Protestersโ rights.  \n \n195.  Individual Defendants witnessed or were otherwise aware of the events \ndescribed herein as they unfolded. \n196.  Individual Defendants were aware that the Protesters were peaceful and \nwere engaged in constitutionally protected speech.  \n197.  Individual  Defendants  did  not  have  a  reasonable  expectation  that  the \nProtesters would cause substantial harm or serious inconvenience, annoyance or alarm; \n198.  Individual defendants did not have reason to believe that the Protesters \npresented an imminent threat to public safety, peace or order;  \n199.  Individual Defendants ordered, authorized and/or acquiesced in the order \nto declare the assembly unlawful;  \n200.   Individual Defendants ordered, authorized and/or acquiesced in the use of \nexcessive force against Protesters;  \n201.  Individual  Defendants  had  the  opportunity  to  intervene  to  prevent  the \nviolation of the Protestersโ constitutionally protected rights and failed or refused to do so;     \nl.  The decision to use force constituted the official policy of the City of \nPittsburgh  \n \n202.  Defendants  Peduto,  Hissrich  and  Schubert,  jointly  and/or  individually, \npossessed final policymaking authority to make the decision to 1) declare Protestersโ \nassembly unlawful, 2) use force to disperse Protesters and 3) use noxious chemical gas \nand extremely dangerous and painful rubber bullets, beanbag rounds and/or sponge \ngrenades against Protesters. \n30 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 31 of 42\n203.  Peduto, Hissrich and Schubert jointly and/or individually made, approved \nand/or acquiesced in these decisions to violate Protestersโ constitutional rights.  \n204.  The violation of Protestersโ rights was the direct result of the official policy \nof the City of Pittsburgh.  \nm. PBP violated its policy regarding discharge of less lethal munitions \n \n205.  PBPโs policy regarding discharge of less lethal munitions does not provide \nfor  the  use  of  rubber  bullets  or  sponge  grenades.  Nevertheless,  PBP  officers  shot \nProtesters with rubber bullets and sponge grenades. \n206.  PBPโs Policy regarding discharge of less lethal munitions does not permit \ndischarge  from  less  than  20  feet.  Nevertheless,  officers  discharged  rubber  bullets, \nbeanbags and/or sponge grenades at Protesters from a distance of far less than 20 feet.  \n207.  PBP policy recognizes that, โThe use of kinetic energy impact projectiles \nare considered deadly force, if intentionally deployed to areas of the subjects [sic] body \nthat are recognized as likely to cause serious bodily injury or death (head, neck, throat, \nchest or solar plexus).โ  PBP policy prohibits officers from targeting these areas of a \npersonโs body unless deadly force is justified.  Nevertheless, PBP officers fired hundreds \nof  rubber  bullets,  beanbags  and/or  sponge  grenades  indiscriminately  into  clouds  of \nsmoke, through which they could not see the Protestersโ bodies.  As a result, Protesters \nwere hit with projectiles in areas of their bodies likely to cause serious bodily injury and \nwere, in fact, seriously injured.   \n208.  PBP policy requires officers to transport persons subject to kinetic energy \nimpact projectiles to a medical facility for evaluation and treatment.  PBP did not transport \nProtesters injured by rubber bullets and bean bags to medical facilities, or render any \n31 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 32 of 42\nmedical aid whatsoever, even though an ambulance accompanied police vehicles. PBP \ndid not pre-arrange for medical care or transportation for injured Protesters, even though \nit intended to use levels of force which were likely to cause serious injury or death to \nProtesters.  \n209.  PBPโs failure to follow its own policy regarding discharge of less lethal \nmunitions constituted deliberate indifference to the rights of Plaintiffs.  \nn.  PBP failed to adopt necessary policies and procedures regarding crowd \ncontrol \n210.  The PBP does not have a policy governing the declaration of assemblies as \nโunlawfulโ and the forced dispersal of protests, even though the need for such a policy is \nobvious.   \n211.  The  PBP  does  not  have  a  policy  governing  the  use  of  chemical  gas, \nflashbang grenades and/or smoke bombs even though the need for such a policy is \nobvious.   \n212.  PBPโs failure to adopt these policies constituted deliberate indifference to \nthe constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and other peaceful Protesters with whom PBP officers \ncome into contact.   \no.  PBPโs failed to properly train officers regarding crowd control  \n213.  PBPโs  use  of  force  training  curriculum  does  not  address,  or  does  not \nproperly address, crowd/riot control techniques, use of impact munitions, chemical gas, \nflashbang grenades and/or smoke bombs.  \n214.  PBP does not train, or does not properly train, officers in crowd/riot control \ntechniques;  \n32 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 33 of 42\n215.  PBP  does  not  train,  or  does  not  properly  train,  officers  in  the  use  of \nmunitions such as rubber bullets, bean bag rounds and/or sponge grenades.  \n216.  PBP  does  not  train,  or  does  not  properly  train,  officers  in  the  use  of \nchemicals, such as โtear gasโ and/or OC spray for crowd control purposes.  \n217.  PBP  does  not  train,  or  does  not  properly  train,  officers  in  the  use  of \nflashbang devices and/or smoke bombs for crowd control purposes.  \n218.  PBPโs failure to train its officers, as hereinbefore described, constituted \ndeliberate indifference to the rights of Plaintiffs and other peaceful protesters with whom \nPBP officers come into contact.  \nV)  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n \n219.  Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rule 26 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure;  \n220.  Plaintiffs seek to represent a primary class and two subclasses. \n221.  The proposed primary class consists of the following: \nEvery individual who was present at or near the intersection \nof  Centre  Avenue  and  Negley  Avenue  in  the  City  of \nPittsburgh on June 1, 2020 for the purpose of engaging in \nlawful protest and who was ordered to disperse by the City of \nPittsburgh Bureau of Police.  \n222.  The first proposed subclass (Subclass A) consists of the following: \nEvery member of the primary class who was subjected to \nforce by City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Officers, or law \nenforcement officers acting under the direction of the City of \nPittsburgh Bureau of Police.   \n223.  The second proposed subclass (Subclass B) consists of the following: \nEvery member of the primary class who was arrested and/or \nwho was criminally charged with disorderly conduct and/or \n33 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 34 of 42\nfailure to disperse by City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police \nofficers or other officers acting under the direction of the City \nof Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.  \n224.  The requirements of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23(a)(1) are satisfied with regard to \nclasses  and  subclasses  in  that  Plaintiff  estimates  that  there  are  at  least  100  class \nmembers in the primary class and subclass A, and at least 22 class members of subclass \nB, whose interests would be affected by any order of declaratory or injunctive relief.  The \nnumber of class members is so large that joinder of all its members is impracticable. \n225.  The requirements of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23(a)(2)  are satisfied in that there \nare questions of law and fact common to the classes, including but not limited to:  \ni.  Whether the Defendants violated the First Amendment \nto the United States Constitution when they declared \nthe  Protesters  peaceful  assembly  โunlawfulโ  and \nordered Protesters to disperse? \nii.  Whether the Defendants violated the First Amendment \nto the United States Constitution when they used force \nto  disperse  Protesters  who  were  peaceably \nassembled? \niii.  Whether  the  Defendants  violated  the  Fourth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution when \nthey  used  force  to  disperse  Protesters  who  were \npeaceably assembled? \n \niv.  Whether the Defendants violated the Fourth and/or \nFourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution  by  using  unnecessary  and  excessive \nforce  to  disperse  Protesters  who  were  peaceably \nassembled? \n \nv.  Whether the Defendants violated the Fourth and/or \n14th Amendments to the United States Constitution by \nfailing to adequately train, supervise, regulate PBP \nofficers,  including  failure  to  promulgate  necessary \npolicies,  in  responding  to  individuals  exercising \nconstitutionally  protected  rights  to  protest  and/or \nassemble.  \n34 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 35 of 42\n226.  The requirements of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23(a)(3) are satisfied in that Plaintiffsโ \nclaims are typical of the claims of the class.  Plaintiff and all class members are seeking \ninjunctive relief and damages under federal law. Any finding that that Defendantsโ conduct \nviolated Plaintiffsโ rights will be applicable to all class members.   \n227.  The requirements of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23(a)(4)  are satisfied in that Plaintiffsโ \nattorneys, Margaret S. Coleman, Esq., and the Law Offices of Timothy P. OโBrien, and \nQuinn Cozzens and the Abolitionist Law Center will fairly and adequately represent the \ninterests of the class in that:  (i) they have done significant work in identifying and \ninvestigating potential claims prior to filing this action; (ii) they and their respective firms \nhave extensive experience litigating class actions, other complex litigation and the types \nof claims asserted in the Class Action Complaint; (iii) they have extensive knowledge of \nthe applicable law; and (iv) they are advancing the costs of the litigation.  \n228.  The  requirements  of  Fed.  R.  Civ.  Pro.  23(b)(1)  are  satisfied  in  that \nprosecuting  separate  actions  by  individual  class  members  would  create  a  risk  of  \ninconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual class members that would \nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class; and/or \nadjudications with respect to individual class members that, as a practical matter, would \nbe dispositive of the interests of other members not parties to the individual adjudications \nor would substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests. \n229.  The requirements of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23(b)(2) are satisfied in that the \nparties opposing the class have acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally \nto the class so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate \nrespecting the class as a whole. \n35 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00965-LPL   Document 1   Filed 06/29/20   Page 36 of 42\nVI)  CLAIMS \n \nCOUNT I \nNamed Plaintiffs and Primary Class Members v.
